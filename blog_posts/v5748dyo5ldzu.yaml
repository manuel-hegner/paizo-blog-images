  description\">When I started playing Pathfinder Society more than 3 years ago, I\
  \ realized the more I gave to it, the more I got from it and the more valuable it\
  \ became to me. While it may not be a universal truth, I believe that when you work\
  \ for something, you value it more than if it was just given to you. Also, I find\
  \ that when you give back to your community, it too becomes stronger and more valuable.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Pathfinder Society Organized Play is a social, roleplaying game where\
  \ people come together in public to enjoy our favorite pastime. Pathfinder Society\
  \ is built upon this community. Even if you only play with friends at home, this\
  \ group is your local gaming community. </p> \n    <p>In Georgia, I realized very\
  \ quickly I couldn’t run Pathfinder Society on my own, especially if I wanted the\
  \ community to grow it and make it better. With a large area spread out across the\
  \ Atlanta metro area, I simply couldn’t make it to all the stores, meet all the\
  \ players and store owners, recruit the GMs needed, and grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ to the numbers I’d set as goals. This led me to being able to find a core group\
  \ of store liaisons (today we call them Venture-Lieutenants) to help the community\
  \ grow Pathfinder Society. Without the tireless efforts of Kyle and Nani Pratt,\
  \ Joseph Caubo, Nicholas Gray, and John Compton, the community in Georgia wouldn’\
  t be as strong as it is today. The first thing we did was work to get a website\
  \ in place so that all interested gamers had a place to gather and plan future game\
  \ days, chat about Pathfinder Society in general, and brag about their accomplishments.\
  \ In hindsight, this was the foundation of building a strong community. </p> \n\
  \    <p>I was going to expand on how my Venture-Lieutenants’ contributions helped\
  \ and were the foundation of one of the strongest player bases in the world, but\
  \ that would take many more words. Instead, I am going to invite them to come here\
  \ and share those experiences. They will do a much better job explaining their parts\
  \ than I ever could. I will instead leave it at a simple thank you. Without all\
  \ of their tireless efforts, we wouldn’t have a community in Georgia; we would just\
  \ have many splintered groups of gamers.</p> \n    <p>This blog post is an introduction\
  \ to a topic that I will be including in a future version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Guide to Organized Play</i></a>, under the heading of 'The\
  \ Pathfinder Society Community':</p> \n    <blockquote>\n     <p><i>\"The Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play Campaign is a global gaming community that exists because\
  \ of the efforts of volunteers just like you. In joining the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Community, your contributions—whether GMing, aiding in organizing events, helping\
  \ new players, or just sharing your enthusiasm—are an essential part of Pathfinder\
  \ Society membership. You are strongly encouraged to add your efforts to make this\
  \ campaign better. It cannot exist without you and together we can do great things.\"\
  </i></p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Our gaming communities would not continue to\
  \ exist without your contributions, which is why we are adding this to the <i>Guide</i>—\
  to highlight how vitally important it is that everyone gives back to his or her\
  \ local Pathfinder Society gaming community. Let me add, we at Paizo do not have\
  \ any expectations about how you give back; we only request that you do so. Your\
  \ local Pathfinder Society community might already have some ideas about what being\
  \ a member entails.</p> \n    <p>Many of the challenges that Pathfinder Society\
  \ communities face, such as a lack of GMs, can only be solved by the community members,\
  \ and the successes that happen are a result of many people working together toward\
  \ a common goal. You matter. Your ideas matter. Your contributions matter. Together\
  \ we make things happen.</p> \n    <p>Let’s look at common ways to contribute to\
  \ your Pathfinder Society community. This is in no way an exhaustive list. It is\
  \ simply a list of common ways to give back:</p>\n    <ul> \n     <li><b>Offer to\
  \ GM.</b> This one is first on the list because it is obviously the easiest and\
  \ most important. There is a reason why we stress GMing so much. It’s a great way\
  \ to give back to the community <i>and</i> become a better player while you do it.\
  \ We have established GM 101 training sessions to encourage quality GMing and we\
  \ hope that all of you will try spending some time behind the screen.</li> \n  \
  \   <li><b>Organize gamedays and local conventions.</b> Anyone can organize a gameday\
  \ or small convention, not just Venture Captains and Lieutenants. All you need is\
  \ to arrange the gaming space, secure the GMs, promote the event to get players,\
  \ and then report it. It’s easy and provides a valuable service. You can become\
  \ a local coordinator by coordinating a regular event, such as at a game store or\
  \ even at home. Setting up new spaces on a regular basis provides new locations\
  \ for players to play, and for new potential players to experience the community\
  \ that Pathfinder Society offers and creates.</li> \n     <li><p><b>Help find and\
  \ prepare new players for Pathfinder Society Organized Play. </b>New players are\
  \ the lifeblood of the Society. This very important as we will always have some\
  \ attrition in the ranks. Spreading your enthusiasm by finding and teaching new\
  \ Pathfinders what it means to be in the Society and helping promote your local\
  \ events are of vital importance. If all you do is introduce one new player a month\
  \ to the Society and your local playgroup, your Pathfinder Society community will\
  \ grow stronger, and perhaps even become one of the most vibrant in the world.</p>\
  \ <p>You might be surprised who could be interested in Pathfinder Society. It’s\
  \ the perfect vehicle for people who have busy working and home lives, and who can’\
  t commit to a regular schedule, to still get their gaming fix. Talk openly and honestly\
  \ about Pathfinder Society to people you come across, even if you don’t think they\
  \ fit the typical bill of a gamer. </p> <p>Some additional reading can be found\
  \ in Painlord’s post <a href=\"http://paizo.com/forums/dmtz47j7\">here.</a></p></li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>Other ways to contribute.</b> The Pathfinder Society runs best when\
  \ the environment is friendly and warm and people are recognized for their time\
  \ and efforts. If you’re the person who is always bringing pizza and sodas to thank\
  \ GMs, taking the time to help the local coordinator design flyers, offering to\
  \ do the reporting after the events, or printing materials for your local group,\
  \ you are doing your part. There are many ways to contribute.</li>\n    </ul>\n\
  \    <p></p> \n    <p>I believe that our Society will be stronger as more and more\
  \ of us give back to the Society. I have seen it happen in Georgia... the more voices\
  \ we had, the better we were together. </p> \n    <p>This is important to me and\
  \ our Society... and that’s why we are adding it to the <i>Guide</i>. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>On a final note, tell us how you contribute, or plan to contribute, in your\
  \ area’s lodge during Season 4. The more ideas we have to show people, the better\
  \ off Pathfinder Society will be as a whole.</p> \n    <p>If this blog receives\
  \ enough positive feedback, I think it could lead to a series of monthly blogs,\
  \ each one getting into the details of the bullet points above or other similar\
  \ topics. Let me know what you think and I look forward to reading your suggestions\
  \ on building a better Pathfinder Society community.</p> \n    <p>I want to thank\
  \ Eric Brittain (Venture Captain of San Diego), Nani Pratt (Co-Venture Captain of\
  \ Atlanta), Joshua Archer (Venture Lieutenant of San Francisco), Jeff Kokx (aka\
  \ Drogon), and Kyle Baird (as himself). Their feedback and help with this blog allowed\
  \ me to get the above thoughts and message out and were invaluable in this week’\
  s Pathfinder Society blog post. </p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society\
