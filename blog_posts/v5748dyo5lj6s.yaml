  \ Against the Crimson Throne, Part 1</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October\
  \ 13, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Now that copies of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\">hardcover edition of Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a> are shipping out and we've provided the players with\
  \ a mini player's guide to help create their characters, it's time to turn the attention\
  \ to the new content in this version of the classic Adventure Path. All of you who\
  \ are intending to play in this campaign, be warned, there be spoilers below!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Those GMs who ran Curse of the Crimson Throne in its first incarnation\
  \ will find a lot of new content in the hardcover edition, but most of this content\
  \ is relatively well-integrated into the text of the adventure. In some cases, this\
  \ new content is simply material that we had to cut from publication the first time\
  \ around, due to space limitations. But in others, it's brand new material that\
  \ I created during the project's development—new content that may have been suggested\
  \ by customer feedback, or may have simply been something that I was inspired to\
  \ include to make the campaign more exciting, fresh, and memorable. One such addition\
  \ was revealed last week—the Betrayed campaign trait gives players an option for\
  \ characters who might be a bit less reputable than the classic campaign traits\
  \ assume. But of course, that's only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Here's a\
  \ sampling of my favorite new additions to the first four chapters of Curse of the\
  \ Crimson Throne!</p> \n    <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n     <b>Chapter 1:\
  \ Edge of Anarchy</b> \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <h2>The\
  \ Lamm Legacy</h2> \n      <p>Folks were disappointed the first time around that\
  \ the villain built up by the Campaign Traits, Gaedren Lamm, didn't have a stronger\
  \ presence in the campaign overall. While the hardcover edition doesn't expand Gaedren's\
  \ role significantly (he was never meant to be a recurring villain, but a convenient\
  \ foil to help bring the party together in the first place), it does give him a\
  \ son—Rolth, the vile necromancer the PCs first learn about later in this chapter\
  \ and first encounter in Chapter 2. By making Rolth Gaedren's son, this villain\
  \ has a built-in reason to hate the PCs—he may not have loved his father, but he\
  \ can certainly ache for revenge against those who bring him to justice! Further\
  \ increasing Rolth's role in Korovsa, I decided to make him into the notorious Key-Lock\
  \ Killer, a murderer only barely mentioned in the \"Guide to Korvosa\" as being\
  \ the city's most prolific serial killer. The PCs will be able to find clues to\
  \ Rolth's connection to Gaedren, as well as to his secret life as a serial killer,\
  \ among the various treasures they can loot in Gaedren's den.</p> \n     </div>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n     <b>Chapter 2: Seven Days\
  \ to the Grave</b> \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <h2>A\
  \ Chance at Redemption</h2> \n      <p>In addition to expanding on Rolth's role\
  \ in the campaign, in this chapter I was able to expand a bit more on the role of\
  \ the crazy elf Jolistina. In the original, she wasn't much more than a lunatic\
  \ for the PCs to fight, but this time around, the PCs can do much more than just\
  \ fight her. If they're careful or caring, they might be able to get Jolistina on\
  \ their side and perhaps even help her along a path of redemption!</p> \n     </div>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n     <b>Chapter 3: Escape from\
  \ Old Korvosa</b> \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <h2>More\
  \ Rakshasas</h2> \n      <p>In the previous edition of Curse of the Crimson Throne,\
  \ the rakshasa had something of a glass jaw, and as such we were able to use a large\
  \ number of them in the adventure without worrying about overwhelming the PCs. But\
  \ with the publication of the Pathfinder Bestiary, we updated the basic rakshasa\
  \ so that it more properly filled its role as a CR 10 monster. Which was good for\
  \ the rakshasa, but not so good for Arkona Palace, which had a large number of these\
  \ foes spread throughout the manor. My solution wasn't to remove rakshasas, but\
  \ to swap some out for less powerful but still frightening marai rakshasas. Not\
  \ only does this keep the dungeon's original themes in place, but it gives it more\
  \ variety in the foes your players will face.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n     <b>Chapter 4: A History Of Ashes</b> \n\
  \     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\"\
  >\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <h2>Deathhead Vault</h2> \n      <p>While\
  \ the additions to the previous chapters were largely in the realm of bits and pieces\
  \ here and there to add flavor or clarify, we reach our first significant amount\
  \ of new content in chapter 4. Not only did I rebuild the format of the original\
  \ adventure to be less linear and more of a sandbox (without that distracting \"\
  Shoanti going to war\" subplot that ended up going nowhere), but I added an entire\
  \ new section. In large part spurred by customer feedback that players were disappointed\
  \ to leave Korvosa for two whole adventures, but also because I was never satisfied\
  \ with how the Gray Maiden's stronghold was handled \"off camera,\" I added a whole\
  \ new set of encounters as a third part to <em>A History Of Ashes</em>. Here, the\
  \ PCs return to Korvosa after their allies are contacted by Boule, the guildmaster\
  \ of Korvosa's thieves' guild, who has information on how the PCs can infiltrate\
  \ the stronghold of the Red Mantis assassins AND the Gray Maidens. Doing so will\
  \ not only allow the PCs to rescue Marcus Endrin from his fate, but explains exactly\
  \ why the Gray Maidens and Red Mantis assassins mysteriously relocate their headquarters\
  \ to Castle Korvosa in the campaign's climax. Of course, there's a lot more going\
  \ on in Deathhead Vault, the underground complex the assassins and maidens use as\
  \ their headquarters—pet catoblepases, creepy outsiders, and an undead arbiter are\
  \ only a few of the dangerous foes the PCs get to face off against in this significant\
  \ addition to the campaign!</p> \n     </div>\n    </div> \n    <h2>More Art!</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>And of course, I don't want to leave you without showing off some more\
  \ of the new art we ordered for the hardcover edition. Check out these new interpretations\
  \ of classic fights from the original adventures!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
