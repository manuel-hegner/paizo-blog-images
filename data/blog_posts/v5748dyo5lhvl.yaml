  \ 2.</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When people\
  \ find out I've been to 31 consecutive Gen Cons in the Midwest, they're always gobsmacked.\
  \ \"Mike, you must be so lucky,\" they say in unison, \"to get to go to such an\
  \ awesome show year after year!\" And I am. But every year, I am reminded that Gen\
  \ Con has a dirty little secret: It's a germageddon. If you're not lucky, you can\
  \ bring a nasty little bit of Gen Con back with you.</p> \n     <p>And what we learned\
  \ this year is that Tanis isn't a paladin.</p> \n     <p>See, in the RPG, a paladin\
  \ becomes immune to disease. That would make her the perfect Gen Con attendee! But\
  \ Tanis isn't a paladin, so she's real sick, and you should send her your best wishes.\
  \ And believe me, she'd want to be writing this <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu9\"><em>Paladin\
  \ Class Deck</em></a> preview blog for you, but I'm doing it instead so she gets\
  \ better. Because Healthy Tanis is Awesome Tanis.</p> \n     <p>So without further\
  \ heartstring tugging, let's talk about paladins!</p> \n     <h2>Seelah: \"Friend,\
  \ You Look a Little Worse for the Wear\"</h2> \n     <p>When we released the <i><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9a46?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Base-Set\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</a></i>, we made Seelah the front-and-center character.\
  \ That Seelah had her hair unbraided and her shield out, so demons beware. If you\
  \ want a Seelah that can punch an Abyssal pitspawn into next Thursday, Wrath Seelah\
  \ is your paladin.</p> \n     <p>But what if you want a Seelah who not only knows\
  \ how to mix it up melee-style, but is also the best friend anyone's ever had, you\
  \ want Paladin Deck Seelah. Let me show you why.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-SeelahFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-SeelahFront_180.jpeg\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-FaithHealer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-FaithHealer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This version of Seelah has a hunt-and-kill power similar\
  \ to the one on Rise of the Runelords Seelah, where she will shove aside boons to\
  \ get to the crunchy monsters hiding from her smiting. She also borrows a version\
  \ of Kyra's healing power, except instead of burning explorations to help her friends,\
  \ Seelah burns her own cards to make her companions healthier. And unlike the clerics,\
  \ she makes her friends healthier in a predictable manner. Seelah knows every time\
  \ that she can trade one card of hers for two or three of yours. That's every turn\
  \ she takes. With a single power feat, that's every turn <i>anybody</i> takes. But\
  \ what about characters at other locations? Check a box on the Faith Healer role,\
  \ and she can bring you to her and heal you, so you can get around to taking your\
  \ turn right then and there.</p> \n     <p>Keeping Seelah alive thus becomes the\
  \ party's primary goal. And lookie here, her Faith Healer role has the best way\
  \ to do just that. As long as she has a blessing or another Divine card in hand,\
  \ she can recharge any Healing card she plays. That Mass Cure? Seelah says, \"Don't\
  \ worry your pretty little head about it—it'll come back before you know it.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Speaking of awesome, here's a couple tricks from the Paladin deck that\
  \ Seelah likes a ton.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Renewal.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <h2>Koren: \"We Should Kill That Because It's Weird\"</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Now, a half-orc paladin may not be your average paladin, but Koren isn't\
  \ exactly average. He's got some orc in him, so despite being raised in a loving\
  \ home by two upstanding half-orcs, he explodes in righteous vengeance a couple\
  \ times a day.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-KorenFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-KorenFront_180.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"\

  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-GildedFist_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Koren starts out all about helping his friends. He uses armor\
  \ like Sue Storm uses force fields: Give him a shield, and he'll throw it in front\
  \ of his buddies to absorb their damage or power up their attacks. That's all well\
  \ and good.</p> \n     <p>But hey, select that Gilded Fist role, and all of a sudden\
  \ this likable half-orc is glaring at Undead and Aberrations and Outsiders with\
  \ all the fury of Sarenrae scorned. Bonus dice, Magic trait, recharging blessings—\
  Koren turns into a multi-tool of weird-monster crushing. He’s also the spell-heaviest\
  \ paladin in the deck, so that crushing is bolstered by spell and sword alike.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While we're at it, let's give Koren some more tools for that multi-tool.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Sunsword.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Raz: \"Who's a Good Griffon? You're a Good Griffon!\"\
  </h2> \n     <p>Raz is already your favorite gnome paladin ever. That armored riding\
  \ dog is just the cutest. And a two-foot-long lance! Adorbs!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Nah, she's gonna kick your skull in, and so's her little\
  \ dog, too. Raz (short for Razzmatazz, our playtest name for her) is the ultimate\
  \ mounted paladin, optimizing the deck's many cards that have the Mount trait. When\
  \ she starts out, she can recharge a Mount from the top of her deck to boost her\
  \ lance, and she can bury one to intercept another person's monster fight. One checkbox\
  \ in, she can do the latter just by discarding a Mount.</p> \n     <p>However, she\
  \ is subject to the mercy of her card draws... unless she's a Dog Rider Knight.\
  \ The Dog Rider Knight just says \"I would like a Mount please\" and—poof!—one appears.\
  \ What a faithful dog! And significantly, that role has the best flavor text Tanis\
  \ ever wrote. Admit it, you want to toss aside whatever you're playing and play\
  \ Raz right now.</p> \n     <p>Here's a couple of Raz's best friends. She's not\
  \ just good with dogs, natch. Sometimes, you just gotta fly.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
