  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello!<br> I’m Michael Sayre,\
  \ the design manager here at Paizo and one of the cover authors for <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Treasure Vault</em> alongside Mark Seifter and Kendra Leigh Speedling. I was the\
  \ voice for both the plucky kobold Purepurin and the mighty dragon Valashinaz, as\
  \ well as the writer for the new base weapons, story-based crafting, and a wide\
  \ variety of other items scattered throughout the book, like the new <em>thrower’\
  s bandolier</em> previewed in the “Varmints in the Vaults” blog.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ proud as I am of the work I did on <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I’m even more proud\
  \ of the freelancers whose contributions made this book possible, so we’re taking\
  \ this opportunity to let some of them tell you a little about themselves and the\
  \ work that they did on this book. Without further ado…</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ I'm Mark Seifter, Roll for Combat director of game design, and Paizo's former\
  \ design manager as well as one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition. In <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I wrote a variety of topics, but the\
  \ parts I'm most excited about are the crafting variant rules and nature crafting\
  \ sections, including the magic gardens! Check out Arcane Mark, my Twitch stream\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling</h3> \n     <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra\
  \ Leigh Speedling, and I'm one of the cover authors on <em>Treasure Vault</em>!\
  \ My sections were: alchemical foods, artifacts, cursed/intelligent items, grimoires,\
  \ missives (with Jessica Catalan), relics, spellhearts, staves, and wondrous consumables.\
  \ I love cool loot, so this book was awesome to work on! I can't pick a favorite\
  \ item, but the cooperative waffles have apparently been making a splash, so I'll\
  \ tell you I gave them that form to celebrate the return of the mithral waffle iron\
  \ in PF2. I played a PF1 sorcerer who not only bought one, but liked it so much\
  \ that he put one of his scant two skill ranks every level into Craft (waffle).\
  \ And he always made the party breakfast.</p> \n     <p><b>Twitter</b>: <a href=\"\

  \ Catalan</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone! My name's Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder\
  \ Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily writes for Pathfinder and\
  \ Starfinder. For <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I contributed to the wands and missives\
  \ sections. <em>Treasure Vault</em> was a delightful, collaborative book to work\
  \ on, and I look forward to seeing all the new tricks, treats, and treasures it\
  \ contains unleashed on gaming tables! Enjoy!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Andrew\
  \ Geels</h3> \n     <p>Hi there! I wrote for Treasure Vault’s specific magic shields,\
  \ alchemical bombs, and elixirs sections. This is the fourth Paizo book I’ve written\
  \ for, and probably the one I’m most excited to see get used! Magic shields were\
  \ a blast to write, especially with new shield types. The starfall shield in particular\
  \ is one of my favorites (turning into a meteor is cool), but I also love entries\
  \ like the warding escutcheon, and the door-themed stone tower shield that becomes\
  \ a door or a stone tower. Making new bombs and elixirs with weird niches was a\
  \ fun challenge. I can’t wait to hear stories of trueshape bombs turning the tide\
  \ against werewolves, or numbing and soothing tonics pulling parties through deadly\
  \ fights.</p> \n     <p><b>Twitter</b>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PinBarbarian\"\

  \  <p>Happy <em>Treasure Vault</em> Day everyone! This is Sen.H.H.S., you friendly\
  \ Taiwanese TTRPG writer, back again with-- you guessed it-- more fulus! You can\
  \ find the first set of fulus I wrote back in <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. After you've\
  \ showered <em>Treasure Vault</em> with love, don't forget to check on recent and\
  \ upcoming publications to which I have also contributed, such as <em>Lost Omens:\
  \ Firebrands</em>, <em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em>, and last but not least, <em>Rage\
  \ of Elements</em>! To see what else I'm hyping up these days, you can follow me\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Dustin Knight</h3> \n     <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! Since\
  \ writing weapon runes for <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I've become the Developer for\
  \ Starfinder. And while my focus has shifted to the other side of the Gap, I'm so\
  \ happy to keep busy as a freelancer and Pathfinder Infinite contributor during\
  \ what free time I can scrape together. Feel free to hit me up on twitter, where\
  \ I can't wait to hear about all the shenanigans caused by the nifty items in this\
  \ book (especially the authorized rune).</p> \n     <p><b>Twitter</b>: <a href=\"\

  \ Fillet of a fenny snake, In the caldron boil and bake; Eye of newt and toe of\
  \ frog, Wool of bat and tongue of dog.</p> \n     <p>Hi everyone, I'm Jacob W. Michaels,\
  \ and I'm hoping the potions I created for <em>Treasure Vault</em> won't lead you\
  \ to your doom, like the witches did Macbeth. It was a lot of fun adding some potions\
  \ to the mix, and playing with options outside the traditional spells-in-a-jar formula.\
  \ If you like these items, check out my work on Pathfinder Society or other rule\
  \ books, Adventure Paths and Lost Omen titles, and raise a glass—of <em>Cayden's\
  \ Brew</em> or some nonalcoholic potion of your choice—to Valashinaz and the wonders\
  \ of her hoard.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Matt Morris</h3> \n     <p>I’m Matt Morris,\
  \ and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including\
  \ Everybody Games and Rogue Genius Games. I was excited to trade some magic weapons\
  \ to the mighty Valashinaz! (I'm still waiting for the kobolds she promised would\
  \ clean out my garage, though.) I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo\
  \ profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to contact\
  \ me if you are looking for a reliable writer! When not writing, I’m teaching high\
  \ school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> \n     <p><b>Website</b>:\

  \ Jess, and I wrote some fun new catalysts for <em>Treasure Vault</em>. I hope you\
  \ have fun with them! My favorite is the Euphoric Loop, which lets you get a little\
  \ more out of charm during combat encounters where you know the spell can't last.\
  \ If you'd like to see more of my work, I also wrote the items in the Material Changes\
  \ shop of <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, and perhaps later this year you will\
  \ even see my name in, on, or generally just around <em>Rage of Elements</em>...?</p>\
