  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we kick off our\
  \ series of No-Prep Character blogs, which feature a ready-to-run NPC for busy Game\
  \ Masters. In most cases (but not all), we’ll use these blogs to showcase new rules\
  \ options available to players in upcoming releases, such as new ancestries, archetypes,\
  \ equipment, feats, and spells. Today’s NPC is Pr’rall, a catfolk dual-weapon warrior\
  \ based on a character that I played in one of James Jacobs’s office campaigns years\
  \ ago. Thanks to Vanessa Hoskins for converting him so wonderfully into Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition. You can find the rules for the catfolk ancestry and the dual-weapon\
  \ warrior archetype in the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, available\
  \ everywhere on July 30. </p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\

  \ \n      <p>A hunter at heart, Pr’rall takes bounties throughout Avistan and Garund\
  \ on anything from cockatrices to bandits. Gold pays the bills, but the thrill of\
  \ the hunt is the reason he always takes the next job. Lately, Pr’rall has found\
  \ the most satisfaction from hunting sapient creatures; he relishes the moment before\
  \ the final strike when he knows that he’s won and his prey will fall under his\
  \ blade. He’s begun to look into more than just bounty hunting, and is considering\
  \ joining a local assassin’s guild, though he’s not sure if he wants to fully embrace\
  \ his growing bloodlust.</p> \n      <table style=\"width:50%\"> \n       <tbody>\n\

  \ Blitz</b> [two-actions] <b>Requirements</b> Pr'rall is wielding two one-handed\
  \ melee weapons, each in a different hand; <b>Effect</b> Pr'rall attacks as he dashes\
  \ among foes. He Strides up to his Speed. At any point during this movement, he\
  \ can Strike once with each of the two required weapons. These Strikes can be against\
  \ the same or different targets, as he sees fit.<br> <b>Double Slice</b> [two-actions]</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Flensing Slice</b> [one-action] <b>Requirements</b> Pr'rall's last\
  \ action was a Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target; <b>Effect</b> When\
  \ Pr'rall hits with both attacks with Double Slice, he flenses the target, making\
  \ it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage,\
  \ becomes flat-footed, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced\
  \ by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of Pr’rall’s next turn.<br> <b>Light\
  \ Paws</b> [two-actions] Pr'rall can balance on his toes to step carefully over\
  \ obstructions. He Strides and then Steps, or Steps and then Strides, ignoring difficult\
  \ terrain during this movement.</p> \n      <h3>Plot Hooks</h3> \n      <p>Game\
  \ Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Pr’rall\
  \ into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>The heroes\
  \ need to take down a particularly difficult foe and hire Pr’rall to help them hunt\
  \ the target down.</li> \n       <li>Pr’rall’s ancestral temple sword is stolen\
  \ from him but he’s run out of leads in tracking it down. He asks the heroes to\
  \ help him find out who has it so he can hunt them down and ensure they never steal\
  \ from him again.</li> \n       <li>A rich and powerful noble has been thwarted\
  \ by the PCs too many times. He’s hired Pr’rall to hunt them down and bring them\
  \ back: alive if possible, dead if necessary. Given the catfolk’s growing proclivity\
  \ for killing, it’s likely he’ll find a way to force the PCs’ hands.</li> \n   \
