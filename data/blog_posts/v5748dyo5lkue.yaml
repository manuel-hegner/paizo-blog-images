  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Now that Stephen has explained Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition's skills and how they work, it's time to look at the goodies you can earn\
  \ as you level up: skill feats! Every character gets at least 10 skill feats, one\
  \ at every even-numbered level, though rogues get 20, and you can always take a\
  \ skill feat instead of a general feat. At their most basic level, skill feats allow\
  \ you to customize how you use skills in the game, from combat tricks to social\
  \ exploits, from risk-averse failure prevention to high-risk heroism. If you'd ever\
  \ rather just have more trained skills than special techniques with the skills you\
  \ already have, you can always take the Skill Training skill feat to do just that.\
  \ Otherwise, you're in for a ride full of options, depending on your proficiency\
  \ rank.</p> \n     <h2>Assurance and Other Shared Feats</h2> \n     <p>Some skill\
  \ feats are shared across multiple skills. One that will stand out to risk-averse\
  \ players is Assurance, which allows you to achieve a result of 10, 15, 20, or even\
  \ 30, depending on your proficiency rank, without rolling. Are you taking a huge\
  \ penalty or being forced to roll multiple times and use the lowest result? Doesn't\
  \ matter—with Assurance, you always get the listed result. It's perfect for when\
  \ you want to be able to automatically succeed at certain tasks, and the kinds of\
  \ things you can achieve with an automatic 30 are pretty significant, worthy of\
  \ legendary proficiency.</p> \n     <p>The other shared skill feats tend to be shared\
  \ between Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion, and sometimes Society and Lore. This\
  \ is because many of them are based on magic, like Trick Magic Item (allowing you\
  \ to use an item not meant for you, like a fighter using a wand) and Quick Identification,\
  \ which lets you identify magic items faster depending on your proficiency rank,\
  \ eventually requiring only 3 rounds of glancing at an item. The rest of the shared\
  \ skill feats are based on the Recall Knowledge action, including my favorite, Dubious\
  \ Knowledge, which gives you information even on a failed check—except some of it\
  \ is accurate, and some of it is wrong!</p> \n     <h2>Scaling Feats</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>You might have noticed that Assurance scales based on your proficiency rank\
  \ in the skill. In fact, many skill feats do, granting truly outstanding results\
  \ at legendary. For instance, let's look at the Cat Fall skill feat of Acrobatics:</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">CAT FALL <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">FEAT 1</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ trained in Acrobatics</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Your catlike aerial\
  \ acrobatics allow you to cushion your fall. Treat all falls as if you fell 10 fewer\
  \ feet. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you're\
  \ a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary in\
  \ Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of\
  \ the distance of the fall.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>As you can see above,\
  \ Cat Fall lets you treat all falls as 10 feet shorter, 25 feet shorter if you're\
  \ an expert, or 50 feet shorter if you're a master. If you're legendary? Yeah, you\
  \ can fall an unlimited distance and land on your feet, taking no damage. Similarly,\
  \ a legendary performer can fascinate an unlimited number of people with a Fascinating\
  \ Performance, scaling up from one person at the start. And these are just a few\
  \ of the scaling skill feats.</p> \n     <h2>Wondrous Crafters</h2> \n     <p>Want\
  \ to make a magic item? Great, take Magical Crafting and you can make any magic\
  \ item—doesn't matter which kind.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >MAGICAL CRAFTING <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">FEAT 2</span></p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> expert in Crafting</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >You can use the Craft activity to create magic items in addition to mundane ones.\
  \ Many magic items have special crafting requirements, such as access to certain\
  \ spells, as listed in the item entry in Chapter 11.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>Similarly, there's a skill feat to make alchemical items, and even one\
  \ to create quick-to-build improvised traps called snares!</p> \n     <h2>Legendary!</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Legendary characters can do all sorts of impressive things with their\
  \ skills, not just using scaling skill feats but also using inherently legendary\
  \ skill feats. If you're legendary, you can swim like a fish, survive indefinitely\
  \ in the void of space, steal a suit of full plate off a guard (see Legendary Thief\
  \ below), constantly sneak everywhere at full speed while performing other tasks\
  \ (Legendary Sneak, from <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkts?Learning-Takes-a-Lifetime\"\
  >Monday's blog</a>), give a speech that stops a war in the middle of the battlefield,\
  \ remove an affliction or permanent condition with a medical miracle (Legendary\
  \ Medic, also from <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkts?Learning-Takes-a-Lifetime\"\
  >Monday's blog</a>), speak to any creature with a language instantly through an\
  \ instinctual pidgin language, completely change your appearance and costume in\
  \ seconds (see Legendary Impersonator below), squeeze through a hole the size of\
  \ your head at your full walking speed, decipher codes with only a skim, and more!</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[A]][[A]][[A]]LEGENDARY\
  \ IMPERSONATOR <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">FEAT 15</span></p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> legendary in Deception, Quick Disguise</p> \n\
  \      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You set up a full disguise with which you can Impersonate\
  \ someone with incredible speed.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">LEGENDARY\
  \ THIEF <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">FEAT 15</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Prerequisites</b> legendary in Thievery, Pickpocket</p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Your ability to steal items defies belief. You can attempt to Steal\
  \ an Object that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming\
  \ to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending\
  \ at least 1 minute and significantly longer for items that are normally time-consuming\
  \ to remove (like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying\
  \ hidden, whether under cover of darkness or in a bustling crowd, for example. You\
  \ take a -5 penalty to your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is\
  \ extremely prominent, like a suit of full plate armor, onlookers will quickly notice\
  \ it's gone after you steal it.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>So what sorts\
  \ of feats are you most excited to perform with your skills? Let me know in the\
  \ comments section!</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n    </div>\
