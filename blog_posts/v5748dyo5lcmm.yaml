  \ Winners!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 15th, 2011</p> \n   <div\
  \ class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/PFCA_Vol2.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/PFCA_Vol2_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>It’\
  s that time again! After many sleepless nights combing through huge snowdrifts of\
  \ printouts, the good folks over at <a href=\"http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net\"\
  \ target=\"blank\">Pathfinder Chronicler</a> were able to whittle down this year’\
  s entries into the Second Annual Pathfinder Fanfiction Contest to the final five—\
  or rather, due to a tie, the final six:</p> \n   <p>“Gozreh Provides” by Laura Bowlby<br>\
  \ “Bend as the Willow” by Dawn Fischer<br> “Politics of Hell” by B. R. Bearden<br>\
  \ “The Grey Tern” by Andrew Crossett<br> “Completing the Circle” by Todd Stewart<br>\
  \ “Luck's Allegiance” by Alex Lindsay</p> \n   <p>As has now become tradition, the\
  \ judges were kind enough to invite me to step in as a guest judge for the last\
  \ round and cast the deciding vote. All of the candidates did an excellent job—\
  the caliber was truly top-notch, and all six do the fanfic genre proud—but ultimately,\
  \ only three people could take home the fabulous prizes of $100 in store credit\
  \ for first place, and $50 each for second and third. And this year’s winners are:</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>First Place:</b> Andrew Crossett for “The Grey Tern”</p> \n   <p><b>Second\
  \ Place:</b> Todd Stewart for “Completing the Circle”</p> \n   <p><b>Third Place:</b>\
  \ Dawn Fischer for “Bend as the Willow”</p> \n   <p><b>Honorable Mention:</b> Though\
  \ there’s no actual honorable mention prize, I wanted to call out “Luck’s Allegiance”\
  \ by Alex Lindsay. While the other stories ultimately won on the strength of their\
  \ writing, Alex really blew me away with his snappy dialogue and sense of adventure.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>For a complete list of the Top 20, as well as many more awesome Pathfinder\
  \ stories, head over to <a href=\"http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Pathfinder Chronicler</a>. And while we’re on the subject, I want to note\
  \ that each of the finalists will be appearing in the second Pathfinder Chronicler\
  \ print anthology. Ted Thompson and the rest of the Chronicler folks really knocked\
  \ us out last year with their lovingly crafted and high-quality anthology, which\
  \ included a gorgeous cover by Pathfinder artist Eva Widermann. Well, this year\
  \ they’ve decided to keep the tradition going with an equally stellar cover from\
  \ Pathfinder artist Carolina Eade, previewed here for the first time! Both covers\
  \ are beautiful, and I think I speak for all of us here at Paizo when I say that\
  \ these are the sorts of things that make us so unbelievably proud of the Pathfinder\
  \ community. (What’s more, I hear rumors that Ms. Eade will also be providing interior\
  \ illustrations this year...)</p> \n   <p>Congratulations to everyone who competed,\
  \ and I look forward to seeing you all again next year!</p> \n   <p>James Sutter<br>\
