  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 29, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">There are many ways to attempt to win at adventuring.\
  \ You can pry up every loose board in the dungeon to drain the local economy of\
  \ every last mote of gold dust. You can gather wild tales of that time you defeated\
  \ a Vulture Demon with nothing but a sharpened chicken bone. Or, if you don't like\
  \ your friends much, you can be the last one standing when the battle ends. But\
  \ wealth is hollow, tales can be fabricated, and standing alone is... well, lonely.\
  \ The true pathfinder of style wins by making it look good, period.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ takes a higher standard than a brown woolen cloak to make it as a character in\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>.\
  \ Live fast and make it through Adventure Deck 6, or die pretty.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ week, the PACG team struts their choices for best dressed character in a <a href=\"\
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8720XS-pquc\" target=\"_blank\">walk-off</a> of\
  \ lethal fashion.</p> \n    <h2>Liz Spain</h2> \n    <p>Swashbucklers are generally\
  \ a flouncy bunch, but <b>Jirelle</b> pulls off an outfit that elevates practicality\
  \ to fabulous. Eschewing the common brown or black, Her studded leather jerkin and\
  \ chaps are a sumptuous dark indigo trimmed in gold, giving the impression of stars\
  \ in a sea of midnight. Her tall boots, practical for charging through rough underbrush\
  \ or hiking rocky terrain, punctuate her lithe elvenesque silhouette with cuffs\
  \ that won't quit. Heck, even her buckler is painted to match.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Jirelle.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Jirelle_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Gorgeous but deadly.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>To top it all\
  \ off, Jirelle rakishly dons a crimson worsted wool cloak lined in gold silk. A\
  \ bold color choice for the battlefield, the cloak can be employed to distract enemies\
  \ and entrap their weapons. Better yet, the cloak, scarves, and long hair will flow\
  \ as she turns to look amazing in any duel while keeping enemy strikes from targeting\
  \ the important squishy parts. After all, clothing is a much a verb as a noun. Jirelle\
  \ makes it work.</p> \n    <h2>Mike Selinker</h2> \n    <p>As with all critical\
  \ decisions, it is de rigueur to approach the selection of the most fashionable\
  \ character scientifically, rather than through such fallible methods as \"personal\
  \ taste\" and \"saying anything to get the thumbscrews removed.\" I have devised\
  \ an unassailable four-part methodology:</p> \n    <ol>\n     <li>Eliminate all\
  \ monochrome outfits. Approximate percentage of candidates remaining: 50%.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Eliminate overuse of brown. Approximate percentage of candidates remaining:\
  \ 15%.</li> \n     <li>Eliminate visible belly buttons. Approximate percentage of\
  \ candidates remaining: 3%.</li> \n     <li>Of the remaining candidates, pick the\
  \ one that Liz Spain is most likely to dress as.</li>\n    </ol> \n    <p>Thus,\
  \ the only plausible answer is <b>Radillo</b>. Don't thank me. Thank science.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150929-RadillloLiz.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150929-RadillloLiz_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>When Radillo says jump, you say, \"Yes ma'am.\"</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <h2>John Compton</h2> \n    <p>A character with plenty of pockets, bells, whistles,\
  \ and doodads is all well and good, but what captures my imagination is a character\
  \ whose dedication to an in-world ideal is such that she tries to emulate it in\
  \ flesh. As someone who is playing a cleric of Nethys through the Mummy's Mask Adventure\
  \ Path (RPG-style), and as someone who really appreciates how our campaign setting\
  \ presents the god of magic, I love <b>Zarlova</b>'s personal sense of style.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-ZarlovaToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-ZarlovaToken_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Dedication to god, dedication to style.</i>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <p>Sure, plenty of Nethys's faithful worshippers dress in black and white, representing\
  \ the god's half-scorched, half-healthy body. Zarlova has taken it a step further\
  \ and paid someone to tattoo her right half in bone-white patterns, shaving that\
  \ side of her head just to show off the ink. I also like how she's tossed aside\
  \ the notion of a perfectly symmetrical black-and-white garment and instead embraced\
  \ diagonal swathes of color that are as unpredictable-yet-visually-appealing as\
  \ magic itself. Even her staff of two intertwined snakes shows off Nethys's dual\
  \ nature. When it comes to fashion, Zarlova's sensibilities are like her magical\
  \ prowess: unrivaled and the envy of all.</p> \n    <h2>Tanis O'Connor</h2> \n \
  \   <p>I'm going to cheat, unsurprisingly enough. My take is that the best-dressed\
  \ character in the game is the one wearing only his birthday suit.</p> \n    <p>Meet\
  \ <b>Gronk</b>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Gronk.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Gronk_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>He's... too sexy for his clothes...</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Though\
  \ he occasionally spends time as an elf, Gronk the druid knows his bark is better\
  \ than his bite when he's in his woodsiest form. No shirt, no shoes, no service\
  \ necessary for this hunk of forest manliness. Who needs a hat when your head can\
  \ double as a piercing weapon? And his oaken codpiece goes with everything!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You'll get the deets on the Gronky goodness in next month's <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9dyj\"><em>Druid Class Deck</em></a> preview.</p> \n    <h2>Brian\
  \ Campbell</h2> \n    <p>My choice is Wrathack. Wrathack has an axe that is actually\
  \ two axes, because her weapon has an axe at either end. Battleaxes deal a lot of\
  \ damage, and she has two of them forged together, which makes her double axe the\
  \ best fashion accessory a hero can have. Also, she's wearing bloody feathers that\
  \ she ripped off the wings of an angel, which is badass. And she's wearing armor,\
  \ which is obviously better than not wearing armor. I would like her outfit more\
  \ if she wore more black, or if it was stained with more blood, but the fact that\
  \ she has more axes than any other adventurer means that she wins.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6804-WrathackToken.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Hell yeah! That's badass... but it still needs more blood.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <h2>Vic Wertz</h2> \n    <p>Ranzak is the best-dressed character.\
  \ (Parrots count as \"attire,\" yes?)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \   <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-PR1_Ranzak.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>He definitely wins best appendages.</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Keith\
  \ Richmond</h2> \n    <p><b>Merisiel</b> is a true mistress of fashion, from her\
  \ peacock-like fan of shoulder knives down to her meticulously worked leather boots.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-Merisiel.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-Merisiel_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>You get a dagger! You get a dagger! Everybody gets a dagger!</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>What other character has so mastered the intricate accessorizing\
  \ of blades, incorporating a full dozen into her costume? Her dagger hilts even\
  \ match her studded leather armor.</p> \n    <p>Merisiel employs a full array of\
  \ colors, with rich red leather armor, blue garments, gold threading, silver studs,\
  \ black sheathes and straps, and a dashing accent of green and yellow to catch the\
  \ eye.</p> \n    <p>Those familiar with Merisiel's abilities know, however, that\
  \ her true strength is that she is only seen when and where she can steal the show.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Gaby Weidling</h2> \n    <p>Feet feats! Gaby here with my picks for\
  \ best footwear! If you know me, you'll know I have a small shoe problem. I love\
  \ shoes (particularly sneakers) and am inspired to buy shoes by the most random\
  \ stuff. Hopefully I'll escape this blog without ordering any new shoes. And because\
  \ I'm that kind of person, I'm going to show a picture and you'll have to guess\
  \ whose feet I've chosen. Ready, go!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Best Kicks!</h3>\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Can you recognize these sweet winged shoes? They belong\
  \ to none other than our beloved [redacted]! These shoes are intimidating and totally\
  \ badass. They may also finally push me over the edge to buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Adidas-Jeremy-Scott-Shark-Flames/dp/B00YTC4AJC\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">these shoes I've been eyeing for months</a>. Anyway, nobody\
  \ is messing with you when this is your footwear. </p>\n     <h3>Best Pointy Toes!</h3>\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I LOVE [redacted]'S BOOTS! They are shiny. They have\
  \ pointy toes. They have designs. These shoes might finally push me over the edge\
  \ to get a pair of poulaines. Here are <a href=\"http://www.outfit4events.com/czk/product/6042-poulaines-with-distinctive-curved-points/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">some extra whimsical ones I will probably impulse purchase later\
  \ today</a>: All I need is to add some shiny metal and I'll be, dare I say it, even\
  \ more stylin' than [redacted].</p> \n     <h3>Best in Shoe</h3> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The tail in this picture is sort of a giveaway but\
  \ these boots of [redacted]'s are my most favorite. I love that there's some color\
  \ here. Most of our people are just tromping around in brown boots...which is probably\
  \ practical but not necessarily the prettiest. These boots are a glorious green\
  \ and they have some nice silver detailing. Luckily (or unluckily) I don't have\
  \ my eye on any boots like these, so I guess I'm safe. Perhaps I'll have to commission\
  \ a pair. I could use them to cosplay [redacted] or a fancy-footed Slytherin!</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Answers!</h3> \n     <ol class=\"tiny\">\n      <li><b>Wrathack</b>\
  \ (you have no idea how many times I started typing \"Hatrack\" and had to start\
  \ over) won \"Best Kicks\" with her angel-skin boots.</li> \n      <li><b>Tontelizi</b>\
  \ won \"Best Pointy Toes\" with his shiny, stabby toes.</li> \n      <li><b>Lini</b>\
  \ won \"Best in Shoe\" because, seriously. Those boots.</li>\n     </ol> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <h2>Paul Peterson</h2> \n    <p>If we wish to have a discussion, then it\
  \ should really be about which character is the \"second-best dressed\" as the top\
  \ spot is unassailable.</p> \n    <p>You can point out the buckles or bows or boots\
  \ or what have you for other characters, and then nod and say \"Those are indeed\
  \ fine,\" but NONE of those baubles can compare to the majesty of <b>Balazar</b>'s\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\">Splendiferous Hat</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ upon it and marvel. What else could compare? Nothing even comes close. It is splendiferous,\
  \ after all. Look at how it completes Balazar's look. Gaze in wonder as it sets\
  \ off Padrig's scales. Truly it is the pinnacle of magical haberdashery.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And not only is it awesome in its majesty, but it is also said to be alive,\
  \ and to counsel wise Balazar in his many travels. What other mere accoutrements\
  \ listed by others here can equal that feat? None.</p> \n    <h2>Chad Brown</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Oddly enough, I picked first (as far as I know, anyway), but I'm adding\
  \ my section last. That's good for me, because it lets me take a look at what my\
  \ fellows have done. Let's see... hmm...</p> \n    <p>Sorry, everyone; hats are\
  \ great, but then you have to decide between Balazar and Alahazra. Just like in\
  \ Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, two good but very similar answers\
  \ cancel each other out. Likewise, all that footwear is awesome, but even Gaby can't\
  \ pick just one (or two). Also, despite what Tanis might try to tell you, \"wild\
  \ shaped\" is not the same thing as \"dressed.\" For all we know, Gronk is wearing\
  \ mustard yellow spats and white shoes—well into Lamashan, even!—underneath all\
  \ that bark. Automatic disqualification on account of not being dressed!</p> \n\
  \    <p>All that aside, there are several good criteria listed, and one character\
  \ who, in my opinion, excels across the board: Olenjack, dwarven guild leader and\
  \ pillar of the community. Awesome coat, great styling. Beard jewelry—tasteful yet\
  \ refined—alongside a respectable amount of stabby. Plus, while Ranzak may have\
  \ a parrot—excuse me, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhou\">a <i>Magic Bird</i></a>—\
  even he doesn't have have a screaming howler monkey <i>wearing a pirate hat</i>\
  \ for a belt buckle.</p> \n    <p>As Olenjack might say, \"Check and mate.\"</p>\
