  \      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Starfinders! Today, Jessica and I\
  \ are thrilled to officially announce <strong>Starfinder Society Second Edition</strong>,\
  \ launching at Gen Con 2025!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>What is Starfinder Society?</h2>\n\
  \      <p>Starfinder Society is our flagship Organized Play program for the Starfinder\
  \ roleplaying game. Our goal is to provide players with a fast, easy, and flexible\
  \ way to play Starfinder by offering games at local game stores, at conventions,\
  \ and online. You can even play at home with your friends! Every time you play an\
  \ adventure, you’ll earn rewards for your character such as credits and experience.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Organized Play allows you to take the same character from table to table\
  \ around the world and continue to level them up. No matter what your schedule is,\
  \ whether you’re a weekly player or a once-a-month-if-I’m-lucky gamer, Organized\
  \ Play provides a way for you to participate in the campaign!</p>\n      <p>By playing\
  \ Starfinder Society adventures, you’ll get involved with the Starfinder universe\
  \ and have a major impact. Each game’s results are reported back to us by your GM,\
  \ and your decisions will have major consequences. The Starfinder Society has been\
  \ front and center for many major events in the Pact Worlds including the hatching\
  \ of Aucturn, the liberation of Pulonis, the Data Scourge, and more!</p>\n     \
  \ <br>\n      <h2>The World of the Starfinder Society</h2>\n      <p>In the Starfinder\
  \ universe, the Starfinder Society is a famous organization of adventurers, explorers,\
  \ scholars, and xenoarchaeologists dedicated to discovering, exploring, and chronicling\
  \ all the corners of the galaxy and beyond. Starfinders are incredibly diverse,\
  \ with countless people, specialties, and life experiences represented. The motto\
  \ of the Starfinder Society is “explore, report, cooperate.” All of your Starfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play characters are members of the Starfinder Society.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Starfinder agents work in teams and perform missions as assigned by Starfinder\
  \ leadership, including First Seeker Sarmak, current elected leader of the Starfinder\
  \ Society. Starfinders record their findings, preserve discoveries, and share their\
  \ knowledge with the galaxy. Many Starfinders operate out of regional headquarters\
  \ called lodges, which are maintained by a venture-captain—an experienced Starfinder\
  \ who acts as a mentor and organizer. The Lorespire Complex is the main base of\
  \ operations for the Starfinder Society, which is located on Absalom Station, the\
  \ very heart of the Pact Worlds.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \

  \      <br>\n      <h2>Getting Started</h2>\n      <p>Our program officially launches\
  \ at Gen Con 2025 (July 31–August 3). The launch scenarios and adventures will be\
  \ available on paizo.com on August 1, and organizers may begin scheduling events\
  \ as soon as the convention ends on August 3. In the meantime, get started with\
  \ these three simple steps:</p>\n      <ol>\n       <li><strong>Get an Organized\
  \ Play ID number</strong> at <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount\"\
  >https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount</a>. Every time you play a Starfinder\
  \ Society game, you’ll give this number to your GM to report back to us.</li>\n\
  \       <li>Begin to <strong>create your character</strong>! We’ll talk about the\
  \ specifics of character creation in a future blog, but you can review the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\"><em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em></a>\
  \ as well as the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq07vsk?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em></a> (releasing next month) to get inspiration\
  \ for your first player character.</li>\n       <li><strong>Locate your gaming group</strong>!\
  \ Reach out to your friendly local game store to see if they have Organized Play\
  \ games, and if not, ask about how to run some! Join our online community at <a\
  \ href=\"http://pfschat.com/\">pfschat.com</a>, or check out the <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/indy\"\
  >Gen Con event catalog</a> to join one of our launch events.</li>\n      </ol>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>New Edition, New Program</h2>\n      <p>Since the summer\
  \ of 2023, we have been working as a team on the next iteration of Organized Play.\
  \ We knew that a new edition was going to provide us with a unique opportunity to\
  \ revitalize and revamp the program for a modern age, and we’re taking the opportunity\
  \ with all six of our skittermander arms. We’ve put every part of the program under\
  \ a microscope, from scenario structure to character creation and more, and evaluated\
  \ what it’s doing and how we can make it the best version of itself. The community’\
  s feedback has been critical to this. Whether you’ve spoken to us about OP at a\
  \ convention, answered last winter’s community survey, or written something about\
  \ the program online, we’ve taken your thoughts and input into account.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>In some ways, the program will look very familiar. In others, it will look\
  \ radically different. Whether you’re an Organized Play veteran or a brand-new Starfinder\
  \ fresh out of training, we encourage everyone to approach the program with an open\
  \ mind. Our primary goals have been to make the program easier to get into, simpler\
  \ to explain, and focus more on the fun at the table. We’re not doing things just\
  \ because we’ve always done them that way; we’re taking some risks and breaking\
  \ down some barriers to make a stronger program for all of you.</p>\n      <p>Narratively,\
  \ the Starfinder Society is always in the thick of things, uncovering secrets, witnessing\
  \ major events, averting disasters, driving change, and shaping the ongoing story\
  \ of the Pact Worlds with their actions. The future is no different. In fact, I\
  \ hear something big is coming to the Pact Worlds and, while we’re not going to\
  \ reveal our next major storyline today, we <em>can</em> shine a light on it...</p>\n\
