  >We're getting closer and closer to the mid-January release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures, and already the agents of\
  \ evil gather with sinister designs on your player characters!</span></p> \n   \
  \ <p>Presented here are five monstrous adversaries from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> that you'll want to add to your Abyssal\
  \ armies just in time to kick off the new year! </p> \n    <p>Let's take a look!</p>\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I admit it, sometimes I put minis on the list just\
  \ to see how far I can push WizKids to produce something that's never been done\
  \ before, and the Will-o-Wisp here is a great example of my Loki-ish tendencies\
  \ when deciding what figures to put into these sets. Here we have a very common\
  \ monster of fantasy that is, essentially, a glowing ball of energy—a tall order\
  \ when it comes to plastic miniatures. Our own Pathfinder Will-o-Wisp, from page\
  \ 277 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, adds a\
  \ bit of complexity in that it incorporates a ghostly skull visage at the center\
  \ of the luminescence. Sounds impossible to make as a plastic mini. Except that\
  \ it isn't. What we've done here is sculpt a skull and the light as two different\
  \ pieces. The skull is off-white, whereas the nimbus of energy is done in clear\
  \ plastic. Alas, this is one of those figures where the photo doesn't really do\
  \ justice to the final piece, because you've got to hold it in hand to, for example,\
  \ appreciate how skillfully WizKids hid the seams in the contours of the light.\
  \ I've had this figure in the hallway display case at Paizo for a couple of weeks\
  \ now, and folks here have been raving about it. I'm really pleased with how it\
  \ turned out, and it only took a half-dozen tries! The Will-o-Wisp is a Small figure\
  \ slated at the common rarity. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Demoniac_500.jpeg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Demoniac_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Worldwound armies are not made up\
  \ exclusively of demons, of course. They also throng with debased mortals who worship\
  \ demons, like this malevolent fellow. The Demoniac's stats appear on page 46 of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8hij\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Book of the Damned\
  \ Volume 2, Lords of Chaos</a>. The Demoniac easily doubles as any kind of knife-wielding\
  \ debased cultist, making it an extremely high-utility figure above and beyond the\
  \ context of the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> campaign.\
  \ The Demoniac is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>When mortal humanoids find themselves exposed to\
  \ profound, supernatural evil, a horrific, occult transformation can strip them\
  \ of their souls and damn them to the tortured existence of a Lost Soul. Changed\
  \ into a twisted, misanthropic husk, a Lost Soul wanders the endless tracts of evil-aligned\
  \ planes, periodically stumbling into other realms by passing through portals or\
  \ otherwise being conjured elsewhere. Possessing only fragmented memories of its\
  \ former existence, the Lost Soul is driven by profound emptiness, sorrowful longing,\
  \ and vengeful hatred of all life. The Lost Soul is found under a different name\
  \ on page 48 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</a>. And\
  \ you can adopt your very own as a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>A few weeks back <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfj7\"\
  >we revealed the Mongrel</a>, a bizarre amalgamation of animal parts twisted into\
  \ a humanoid form. Mongrels feature prominently in <a href=\"/products/btpy90q9\"\
  >the first Wrath of the Righteous adventure</a>, so we wanted to include a couple\
  \ of varieties in this set. This Mongrel Huntress is slightly less mutated than\
  \ her brother in this set, but (especially in hand) you can really see all of the\
  \ various bits that make up her somewhat twisted form. The Mongrel Huntress is a\
  \ Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_DominionInvader_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_DominionInvader_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is the figure I was bragging about\
  \ last week for really pushing the limits of the prepainted miniature format. The\
  \ Dominion Invader plays an important role late in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> where, among other activities, he is\
  \ no doubt interested in collecting the brains of your unsuspecting player characters.\
  \ And once he extracts them, he'll store them in the coolest feature of this figure—\
  several clear bubbles spaced all over his body, each of which contains its very\
  \ own brain! Think back to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8wta\">Alchemical Golem</a>\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a>, only bigger and in far\
  \ greater numbers. This thing is a joy (or perhaps a terror) to behold, and I absolutely\
  \ love it. I'm certain you will, too. The Dominion Invader is an enormous Large,\
  \ rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week! Come on back for more exciting\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> previews, and have a\
  \ great holiday week!</p> \n    <p>See you next Friday!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br\
