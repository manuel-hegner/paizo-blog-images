  /products/btpy9e42\">Beyond the Pool of Stars<i></i></a><i>, Mirian Raas comes from\
  \ a long line of salvagers—adventurers who use magic to dive for sunken ships off\
  \ the coast of tropical Sargava. With her father dead and her family in debt, Mirian\
  \ has no choice but to take over his last job: a dangerous expedition into deep\
  \ jungle pools, helping a tribe of lizardfolk reclaim the lost treasures of their\
  \ people. Yet this isn’t any ordinary dive, as the same colonial government that\
  \ looks down on Mirian for her half-native heritage has an interest in the treasure,\
  \ and the survival of the entire nation may depend on the outcome...</i></p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter One: Homecoming<br> <i>Mirian</i></h2> \n \
  \    <p>Every day, dozens of transport ships plied the waters between Sargava's\
  \ southern port and its capital, Eleder. Stacks of square-cut logs, crates of ivory,\
  \ and packets of dried medicinal plants came north. Baskets of luxury goods and\
  \ bright bales of Mulaa cloth went south.</p> \n     <p>These goods were shepherded\
  \ by folk who sailed the route several times each week, so accustomed to the trip\
  \ they scarcely came out from under the sun-bleached awnings or looked up from their\
  \ deck benches. Although the occasional wanderer, pilgrim, or explorer might admire\
  \ the rocky surf or the lush coastline, it was rare for the regulars to give much\
  \ heed to either, and unheard of for them to crowd the rails.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ then, it wasn't every day they saw a pirate ship. When the <i>Red Leopard</i>'s\
  \ lookout cried warning, the passengers surged for a view of the doom to come.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Mirian Raas pushed her way through the throng. Despite the more pressing\
  \ concerns, muted cries of outrage followed her wake. A pasty colonial woman openly\
  \ scowled at her.</p> \n     <p>Mirian ignored them. She reached the <i>Red Leopard</i>'s\
  \ starboard rail with the bulk of the mob to her right. She gripped it tight, searching\
  \ through the tattered mist hung above the uncharacteristically dull waves. The\
  \ fog had risen on the heels of afternoon rain, graying the turquoise waters and\
  \ throwing a smoky curtain across the horizon. It lent a more fearsome aspect to\
  \ the fast-moving raider astern—a two-master flying a snapping black banner with\
  \ a sword in a skeletal hand.</p> \n     <p>Mirian scanned the pirate vessel swiftly,\
  \ only to have her attention stolen by a startlingly familiar little ship beyond\
  \ it, just visible through the fog.</p> \n     <p>The pirate ship had swung out\
  \ from beyond the bluff, emerging only a quarter league aft, and the other passengers\
  \ hadn't the wit to see from its trajectory that its target wasn't the <i>Red Leopard</i>.\
  \ Mirian glanced back to the quarterdeck and read the same conclusion in the eyes\
  \ and activities of the crew there. The raider was aimed for the little caravel\
  \ flying Mirian's family pennant.</p> \n     <p>Mirian would have recognized the\
  \ lines of <i>The Daughter of the Mist</i> anywhere, even if the blue flag with\
  \ a golden swordfish weren't waving from its main mast. The ship's sails were reefed,\
  \ so Mirian knew the salvagers were below water searching for treasure, her brother\
  \ Kellic probably leading.</p> \n     <p>The <i>Daughter</i> was swift and nimble\
  \ when underway, but her crew was about to be caught flat-footed. They didn't stand\
  \ a chance against the surprise attack.</p> \n     <p>Not unless...</p> \n     <p>Mirian\
  \ turned and fought back through the frightened crowd. She'd spent long years inland,\
  \ but her sea legs were still good, and she had no trouble running the rolling deck\
  \ once clear. In moments she stood near the wheel and Captain Akimba.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The captain cocked a skeptical eyebrow at her arrival. He was a spare, dark-skinned\
  \ Ijo man with a blunt nose; he cut a rakish figure with his tricorne hat and well-tended\
  \ light blue coat. He'd struck Mirian as both perceptive and good-natured as they'd\
  \ traded pleasantries earlier that day.</p> \n     <p>She greeted him with a sharp\
  \ nod. \"Captain, we've got to help that ship.\"</p> \n     <p>Akimba shook his\
  \ head. \"We can't, Miss Raas.\"</p> \n     <p>The stubby helmsman beside him goggled\
  \ at the notion.</p> \n     <p>She continued her argument. \"Between the <i>Leopard</i>\
  \ and the <i>Daughter</i>, we'll have enough men to stop her. I'm sure there's a\
  \ bounty on that pirate—\"</p> \n     <p>Akimba's mellow voice held little warmth.\
  \ \"You can't know how many that pirate's fielding, or how many are on that caravel.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Fine. Just get me close, then.\"</p> \n     <p>His brows furrowed.\
  \ \"What?\"</p> \n     <p>They were running out of time. Mirian struggled to keep\
  \ her impatience checked. \"Damn it, Captain, tack a few degrees starboard! You'll\
  \ pass close enough for me to swim for it.\"</p> \n     <p>He blinked, dumbfounded,\
  \ his broad-voweled accent more pronounced. \"You want to go over the side? Alone?\"\

  Aye!\" And from the pouch at her side she withdrew a small emerald. She grabbed\
  \ his right hand and placed the gem in his calloused palm. \"For the risk.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He frowned, clearly weighing her sanity.</p> \n     <p>\"That's my family's\
  \ ship, Captain. My brother's aboard.\" He was probably <i>below</i>, but she was\
  \ striving to be succinct.</p> \n     <p>Understanding dawned on Akimba even as\
  \ his frown lines deepened. \"I'm sorry, Miss Raas.\" He sounded sincere. \"There's\
  \ nothing you can do.\"</p> \n     <p>\"There's little risk, and you're being well\
  \ compensated.\"</p> \n     <p>Akimba stared at the gem. His voice softened as he\
  \ met her eyes. \"I can't take this. Not in good conscience. You'd be killed.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She showed teeth in a mirthless grin. \"That's my look-out, Captain.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He stared at her only a moment longer before his fingers closed over\
  \ the emerald. His voice deepened as he roared an order. \"Helmsman, tack us four\
  \ points to starboard!\"</p> \n     <p>Even as the thickset man at the wheel growled\
  \ acknowledgment, Akimba was shouting orders to the men in the masts. The cluster\
  \ of passengers shifted along the deck and a handful advanced toward the helm, presumably\
  \ to protest at a course change that even they could see put them closer to the\
  \ pirate's line.</p> \n     <p>\"I've got to get my gear,\" Mirian said.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Make it fast,\" Akimba growled.</p> \n     <p>She dashed for the port\
  \ gangway, threw herself down the ladderlike stairs, and pushed through the tiny\
  \ door to her cabin. Precious seconds flew as she unlocked and opened the curved\
  \ lid of her sea chest.</p> \n     <p>Mirian withdrew the weathered sword belt and\
  \ the sheathed cutlass that hung from it. After a moment's hesitation she pulled\
  \ off her blouse, leaving her torso garbed only in a tight undershirt. She dropped\
  \ the garment into the chest.</p> \n     <p>She fumbled off her sandals, then slung\
  \ her sword belt over one shoulder, put the key to the lock, and bowed her head\
  \ briefly. Eyes closed, she asked for blessings—from Desna, goddess of luck, and\
  \ from her ancestors. For the first time, she realized the latter now included her\
  \ father. \"Guide my hand,\" she finished.</p> \n     <p>She dashed barefoot up\
  \ to the weather deck. Chilton, the handsome first mate, addressed a gaggle of middle-aged\
  \ colonial merchants and their families. Akimba was at the wheel, the air of immersion\
  \ in his duties shielding him from the protestations below. A steady wind belled\
  \ the sails and tore holes in the mist. The pirate was slowing as she neared the\
  \ <i>Daughter</i>. For a moment the view was clear enough that she saw marauders\
  \ readying swords along the pirate's taffrail. The numbers indeed looked daunting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Akimba glanced at her. \"Closer than I dare, Miss Raas.\" He looked\
  \ almost apologetic. \"You know my first duty is to the people and property entrusted\
  \ to the <i>Leopard</i>.\" He continued before she could thank him. \"I'm sure you\
  \ have some special salvaging gear, but think: what can one person do here?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Never underestimate the element of surprise, Captain. You'll ship\
  \ my dunnage to my mother at the Raas estate?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Aye, woman. You've\
  \ paid me for both shipping and your suicide. May Gozreh bless you. Go!\" He sounded\
  \ angry, but she touched his shoulder in gratitude, for he'd brought his ship to\
  \ within four cable lengths. She held off promising him a drink when next she saw\
  \ him. Like most Ijo, Akimba probably had a healthy belief in sea ghosts. She didn't\
  \ want to sound like she planned to haunt him.</p> \n     <p>Mirian felt the eyes\
  \ of the ship's crew and passengers as she ran for the rail, and heard them speculating\
  \ about the mad native woman.</p> \n     <p>She'd show them mad.</p> \n     <p>Mirian\
  \ dove neatly over the side and passed seamlessly into a white-capped wave with\
  \ the tiniest of splashes.</p> \n     <p>The water of Desperation Bay in the spring\
  \ was only a little cool. The salt in her eyes was the worst transition, though\
  \ one she'd expected. She kicked on, swimming steadily as her eyes adjusted.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Already the twin rings she wore had powered into effect. In appearance,\
  \ they were virtually identical—plain black bands etched with sharp-tipped waves.\
  \ Above water they seemed unremarkable. Below, they were something else entirely.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The ring on her right hand granted her the ability to move through water\
  \ with the same ease she moved through air. Though she could still push against\
  \ the water to swim, there was somehow no drag or delay in her actions.</p> \n \
  \    <p>More obvious were the magics activated by the ring on her left hand. The\
  \ moment she'd struck the water, yellow translucent gills had blossomed along her\
  \ neck. Matching flippers encased her naked calves, and glowing fins extended from\
  \ her elbow to her wrist, tapering as they went.</p> \n     <p>These rare items\
  \ were her heritage, one of two matched sets of arcane tools handed down from her\
  \ eccentric great-grandmother. When she'd last seen the other pair, they'd been\
  \ in her father's possession. She assumed they were now worn by her brother, likely\
  \ somewhere underwater nearby.</p> \n     <p>Mirian surfaced to get her bearings,\
  \ rising only far enough to see the <i>Daughter</i>'s hull, dead ahead.</p> \n \
  \    <p>She kicked onward, felt her curly hair streaming out to brush her shoulders.\
  \ A school of silver minnows darted past, pursued by a trio of hand-sized yellow\
  \ arrow fish. Far below, a sea turtle browsed in a patch of sea grass waving on\
  \ the edge of the drop-off to deeper waters</p> \n     <p>She spotted the pirate's\
  \ hull as it swept up beside the <i>Daughter</i>, a dark shape that blotted light.\
  \ Grimly, she kicked with her full strength, willing herself to swim with all her\
  \ might. Every moment she delayed might cost a life.</p> \n     <p>Agonizing minutes\
  \ later she reached the pirate ship's side. There were no sharks, the gods be praised.\
  \ Maybe these pirates weren't the sort who threw bloodied victims overboard.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Or maybe they just hadn't gotten started yet.</p> \n     <p>Mirian focused\
  \ on the pirate's hull, looking for weakness as she kicked along. It probably lost\
  \ a knot or two whenever it moved, owing to the barnacles encrusted everywhere.\
  \ Yards of seaweed dangled from the keel like weird undersea banners.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Mirian opened the stiff pouch that dangled from the left side of her belt\
  \ and grasped the haft of the third tool that was her family legacy. Here in the\
  \ shadows, the wand was only a slim dark stick the length of her forearm. In direct\
  \ sunlight it was a dull ivory banded in green. According to family record, her\
  \ great-grandmother Mellient had waded into battle with a sword in one hand and\
  \ her wand in the other. But Mirian Raas had little to no magical aptitude. Sometimes\
  \ the wand refused to work for her, even when she gave it her full concentration.\
  \ It was the most challenging of all her magical tools—and the most deadly. It was\
  \ also the only one that required maintenance. After that Bandu assault outside\
  \ Kalabuto, she had only seven charges remaining in the weapon. She'd have to make\
  \ every one count.</p> \n     <p>She leveled the wand and concentrated. A stream\
  \ of bubbles left her mouth as she said, \"Sterak.\"</p> \n     <p>A line of green\
  \ energy streamed from the wand's tip, striking the tarred planks with an audible\
  \ hiss, burning a head-sized hole through the port hull halfway between keel and\
  \ waterline. The rupture sent more bubbles streaming toward the surface. The expanding\
  \ edges glowed green as the acidic energy ate into the wood.</p> \n     <p>She swam\
  \ on. Three more times she struck. By the last she thought the ship might truly\
  \ be listing: an undeniable distraction.</p> \n     <p>Mirian swam straight on to\
  \ the smaller hull of the ship she knew so well. The <i>Daughter</i> showed little\
  \ sea growth, but then her father and Rendak always meticulously saw to her care.\
  \ Mirian had so often navigated to the starboard ladder that she could practically\
  \ reach it with her eyes closed. She hung suspended beneath it for an agonizing\
  \ minute to undo the jute knot securing her hilt, hoping her delay didn't mean people\
  \ were dying above. But there was no going forward until she had her sword free.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As the twine drifted, she saw a flash of movement from below the pirate\
  \ ship. A distant creature swam toward her with a glowing yellow eye.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>She readied the wand.</p> \n     <p>Only when she saw a second light behind\
  \ the man carrying the first did she understand. She was looking at salvagers returning\
  \ from the deeper water, each carrying a glowing, fist-sized stone. The man in front\
  \ was a shirtless, paunchy colonial with a black fringe beard and receding hair:\
  \ Rendak, the <i>Daughter</i>'s first mate and a seasoned salvager. His mouth enclosed\
  \ one end of a tube that stretched over one shoulder. Mirian knew it was attached\
  \ to one of the enchanted air bottles her grandfather had purchased when the salvaging\
  \ team grew larger.</p> \n     <p>Rendak halted a few yards from her, his expression\
  \ torn between pleasure and concern. He'd obviously noted the strange ship, as well\
  \ as Mirian. Perhaps he thought she'd arrived on it. The second figure swam up beside\
  \ him, his lips likewise about a tube that led to a shoulder pack—Gombe, the broad-shouldered\
  \ Mulaa salvager who'd joined the team a year before Mirian left. Where was Kellic?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Explanations and a reunion would have to wait.</p> \n     <p>She pointed\
  \ to the hull and gave the salvagers a hand sign that signified pirates. Rendak's\
  \ eyes widened. He was a little heavier, a little grayer than she remembered, but\
  \ he still looked more than capable. Bald Gombe was trim and fit.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ then pointed to the lights and brought her hands together. Rendak nodded and dimmed\
  \ the glowing stone. That was new equipment. Gombe hesitated before doing the same.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Three against forty or so was better than one against forty or so...\
  \ Mirian pushed the odds from her mind and focused her attention on the ship. She\
  \ thought she heard shouts above. Hopefully that was the pirates expressing outrage\
  \ at the calamity overtaking their foundering vessel.</p> \n     <p>She indicated\
  \ herself and the ladder, then pointed the salvagers toward the ship's prow. Rendak\
  \ gave a thumbs-up.</p> \n     <p>Mirian waited just below the surface, watching\
  \ as the two men swam for the <i>Daughter</i>'s prow. Despite the irk of additional\
  \ delay, she judged it best to time their attack to occur at the same moment as\
  \ her own.</p> \n     <p>She breathed out while still underwater, then took a slow\
  \ breath after breaching the surface. It was a hard fight not to cough. Magical\
  \ assistance or no, her lungs had to acclimatize once more to air. She steadied\
  \ herself with the ladder.</p> \n     <p>From the deck came the sounds of men shouting\
  \ for others to stand still, the clomp of boots.</p> \n     <p>There was no telling\
  \ how many pirates were really up there, or whether they'd actually been inconvenienced\
  \ by her attack on their ship's hull. She might have overestimated the damage, or\
  \ it might not yet have been noticed.</p> \n     <p>She supposed she'd find out.\
  \ She started stealthily up the ladder, through the mist.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
