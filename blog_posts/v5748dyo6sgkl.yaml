  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">An adventuring party is like a rock band, each\
  \ member bringing his or her own unique sound to the collective whole. A champion\
  \ or fighter may stand in front, her wailing axe cutting a line through the crowd.\
  \ A cleric or wizard might hide off to the side, out of the spotlight, but filling\
  \ the room with atmospheric effects, a veritable wall of sound. A witty rogue may\
  \ dart about the stage with precise choreography, delivering pointed accents to\
  \ her allies' riffs. But it's the bard that ties the entire ensemble together, the\
  \ drummer who keeps everyone on the beat, making each of his bandmates' parts shine.\
  \ Lem, the iconic bard, is Pathfinder's Ringo, and his friends certainly get by\
  \ with a little of his help!</p> \n    <p>Enjoy the following piece of short fiction\
  \ from James L. Sutter in the next entry into our series of Iconic Encounters—brief\
  \ vignettes of the iconic characters showcasing the myriad stories you can tell\
  \ with Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>The three harpies circled the ruins, raining threats,\
  \ darts, and excrement in equal measure.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh yeah?!\" Lem dodged\
  \ another grotesque barrage, releasing the knot of his whirling sling as he went.\
  \ The bullet shot from the pouch, smashing into the leader's jaw and dropping her\
  \ to the cobblestone plaza. \"Bring it, birdbrains!\"</p> \n     <p>The remaining\
  \ harpies—a male and a female—screeched and retreated as far as the crumbling arcade,\
  \ putting the ancient pillars between them and further slingstones. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>Valeros cursed as one of his few remaining arrows shattered against the masonry.\
  \ He nocked another. \"At least we've got them on the run.\"</p> \n     <p>And then,\
  \ like fetid angels, the harpies opened their mouths and began to sing. </p> \n\
  \     <p>The notes seemed too pure for the fanged maws that made them—high and clear,\
  \ without any trace of the harpies' usual hunting shriek. Their haunting refrain\
  \ echoed across the plaza.</p> \n     <p>Lem snorted. \"Ah yes, natural minor—very\
  \ spooky, very exotic. But you'll have to do better than that if—\"</p> \n     <p>Next\
  \ to him, Valeros took a staggering step forward, bow lowered and eyes rapturously\
  \ blank.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh come <em>on!</em>\" Lem grabbed at the warrior's wrist,\
  \ only to be shoved aside as Valeros broke into a stumbling run toward the grinning\
  \ harpies. \"<em>Seriously?!</em> They don't even have lyrics! What about rhyme\
  \ and meter? Clever wordplay?\"</p> \n     <p>Merisiel dodged in front of Valeros,\
  \ barely managing to parry a club swing that would have taken his head off. \"I\
  \ don't think he's interested in an artistic education right now, Lem!\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"What else is new?\" But Lem tucked his sling away. Drawing his flute,\
  \ he clambered up the side of the temple entrance and perched atop its crumbled\
  \ stones. Around him, the harpies' song filled the air, heavy with magic.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Lem pursed his lips. \"Not a bad riff,\" he conceded. \"A little simple,\
  \ but you've got to start somewhere.\" He raised the flute. \"Now let me try.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He played. At first, it was just notes—a quick trilling ascension\
  \ to make sure he had the right key—yet it was enough to kindle his own magic. The\
  \ spell swirled inside him as he found the groove, perfectly matching the harpies'\
  \ melody. </p> \n     <p>For a moment, he almost didn't want to follow through.\
  \ There was an infectious quality to the harpies' song—not the magical compulsion\
  \ pulling Valeros to his doom, but the familiar pleasure or playing with other talented\
  \ musicians. The harpies <em>were</em> talented, in their way. Under other circumstances,\
  \ he would have loved to lose himself in the collaboration, feeling their tones\
  \ resonating through his chest, their harmonies raising the hair on his arms and\
  \ toes. Instead, he let that desire feed his magic, swelling toward a vast, impending\
  \ crescendo. </p> \n     <p>Hearing their own song echoed back, the harpies looked\
  \ over at him in surprise. </p> \n     <p>Lem waggled his eyebrows and triggered\
  \ the spell.</p> \n     <p>Power flowed through him, surging into his lungs, coursing\
  \ down into his fingers. It was still him playing, but now it was as if he'd played\
  \ this particular piece a thousand times, his body moving through muscle memory,\
  \ faster than conscious thought. His flute dove away from the melody line, threading\
  \ through the piece like dolphins playing in the surf. And where he played, the\
  \ harpies' song changed: his tones altering their chords, his notes filling their\
  \ silences, each revision robbing their performance of its power. He blew harder,\
  \ and the magic found their song's most crucial notes and inverted them, playing\
  \ ghost notes that somehow crashed into the harpies' own and canceled them out,\
  \ sucking both tones from the air.</p> \n     <p>The harpies broke off their faltering\
  \ song. Screaming in outrage, they stooped and dove toward the bard, claws and clubs\
  \ extended.</p> \n     <p>Valeros's arrow caught the female in the shoulder, sending\
  \ her tumbling from the sky. Merisiel's dagger was a second slower but twice as\
  \ sure, lancing through the male's throat and killing him before he even had a chance\
  \ to fall.</p> \n     <p>Lem let the magic fade. Pulling the flute from his lips,\
  \ he stared down at the fallen harpies with genuine sadness.</p> \n     <p>\"Sorry,\"\
  \ he said. \"You were good, but my friends are kind of a tough crowd...\"</p> \n\
