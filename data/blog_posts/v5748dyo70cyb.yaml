  description\">Greetings, Gamers! In the April Tech Update blog, I promised to give\
  \ you a breakdown of how the upcoming loyalty program will work. Today, I’m here\
  \ to tell you that at its core, Paizo Plus operates similarly to the current program:\
  \ spend money with Paizo and unlock free products and discounts.</p>\n      <p>Under\
  \ today’s Paizo Advantage program, if you subscribe to 4 different lines, you unlock\
  \ either Starfinder Society or Pathfinder Society subscriptions for free; subscribe\
  \ to all 6, and you get both for free. Subscribing to 4 lines also unlocks a 15%\
  \ storewide discount on most Paizo products. Paizo Advantage will be replaced by\
  \ Paizo Plus when the new store launches.</p>\n      <p>The Paizo Advantage program\
  \ was designed to be laser-focused on subscriptions, and it has served Paizo subscribers\
  \ well for many years. However, as our product catalog has grown, we’ve realized\
  \ that we need a more robust system that better rewards all our shoppers for their\
  \ dedication in various ways. We needed a program that was more flexible and easy\
  \ to understand, as well as one that we could modify as we learned what consumers\
  \ valued most. That’s how Paizo Plus was born, and we can’t wait to share it with\
  \ you when we launch!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>The Basics</h2>\n      <p>When\
  \ the new store goes live, you’ll need to opt in to the new loyalty program to start\
  \ earning gold. If you’ve opted in to receive emails from Paizo, you’ll receive\
  \ an email about the new program when we launch. And you’ll be able to earn gold\
  \ right from the start:</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  \ in favor of the gold value for Society purchases, because we genuinely believe\
  \ that this is an essential program for our players and want to encourage more players\
  \ to participate.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>Our goal with the new Paizo Plus is to maintain\
  \ the same value as the Paizo Advantage program. Paizo Plus is slightly better than\
  \ Paizo Advantage, and these starting values allow us to monitor the program and\
  \ expand it in the future once we see how everyone is earning and spending their\

  \   <p>We adapted the proficiency system from Pathfinder Second Edition (and now\
  \ Starfinder Second Edition) and used it as the basis for the tiers that build the\
  \ programs around.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Legendary Loot:</strong> From time\
  \ to time, Paizo will release items that are exclusively available to Legendary\
  \ reward members. They might cost gold pieces, dollars, or a combination of both.\
  \ They will likely be available in very limited quantities and for short periods\
  \ of time.</p>\n      <p>We value our Experts and Masters and will ensure additional\
  \ rewards are available for all tiers that require both gold and a dollar cost,\
  \ as well as those that require only gold or other qualifying factors.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></h2>\n      <p>Here\
  \ are a few answers to some of the most common questions I anticipate. For the complete\
  \ legal rules (which take precedence over this Q&amp;A), you’ll need to wait until\
  \ we launch.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Will I keep my free subscriptions to Pathfinder\
  \ Society and Starfinder Society when Paizo Plus launches? <br></strong>No, but\
  \ you will be able to purchase Society scenarios for free using gold.</p>\n    \
  \  <p><strong>How is gold calculated?<br></strong>Paizo Plus takes the cart total\
  \ after all discounts have been applied (but before taxes and shipping) and multiplies\
  \ that amount by your gold multiplier (1, 1.25, or 1.5). For example, if you buy\
  \ a hardcover book for $60 and use a $20 off coupon, you’ll earn gold based on the\
  \ $40 purchase (40, 50, or 60 gold depending on your tier).&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Can\
  \ I spend the gold I would be earning from a purchase during that purchase?&nbsp;<br></strong>No,\
  \ you can only spend gold after it has been earned.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>How\
  \ long do I stay in a membership tier?&nbsp;<br></strong>When you achieve a new\
  \ tier, you stay in that tier for 12 months. At the end of 12 months, Paizo Plus\
  \ recalculates your tier.</p>\n      <p><strong>When I reach a new tier, do I need\
  \ to wait a year before I can advance to the next one?&nbsp;<br></strong>No, when\
  \ you reach a higher tier, you will be upgraded, and a new 12-month calculation\
  \ will begin.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Do I reach a new tier by accumulating\
  \ gold or spending money?<br></strong>Only by spending money. Gold and dollars are\
  \ two different pools.</p>\n      <p><strong>Does gold expire?<br></strong>Yes,\
  \ after 12 months. You always spend the gold with the closest expiration date first.\
  \ We’ll send an email to notify you about expiring gold if you’ve opted in to receive\
  \ emails from us.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Can I earn gold for past purchases?&nbsp;<br></strong>No.\
  \ Only purchases made after Paizo Plus goes live and you’ve opted in to the program\
  \ count. You can, however, write reviews for purchases over the last 5 years and\
  \ earn gold on those reviews.</p>\n      <p><strong>Will Paizo give away free gold?<br></strong>That\
  \ is a distinct possibility if you’re reading our fantastic emails and following\
  \ us on social media!</p>\n      <p><strong>What happens if I terminate my account?&nbsp;<br></strong>All\
  \ gold is removed and cannot be returned.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Can I give\
  \ gold to a friend?&nbsp;<br></strong>No. Gold is for your use only and is limited\
  \ to your account.</p>\n      <p><strong>Does gold have any cash value?<br></strong>No.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Do the discounts offered in Paizo Plus stack with store sale discounts?<br></strong>No.\
  \ You’ll receive the single highest discount available.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2><strong>Sneak\
  \ Peek of the Store</strong></h2>\n      <p>Here’s a brief look at what the team\
  \ has been working on in the new store. Still subject to change, of course. Isn’\
