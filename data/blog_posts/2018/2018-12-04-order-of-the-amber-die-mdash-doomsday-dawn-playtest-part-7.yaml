               <p itemprop="description">They've reached the end of Doomsday Dawn! The Order of the Amber Die is here to give a report of their experiences with the last chapter of the Playtest adventure after an exciting run through the whole thing. Did they survive or perish? Read below to find out. But! If you want to avoid spoilers, read this a bit later after you're done with the adventure.</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p><a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgdj?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Part six</a> was past us, part seven of the playtest had arrived, and our record was split at 3-3. This was it: game seven of the series. The prize for winning was nothing less than the salvation of Golarion itself. We had been working with the playtest for almost six months, and the atmosphere at the session felt like the ending of some of our previous projects for the Paizo blog. Players paced, our GM was in his zone, and there was the familiar blend of anticipation, anxiety, and nostalgia.</p>
                <p>On a windy autumn afternoon, we shared a feast for heroes with enough leftovers to keep us going until the sun came up. What we didn't know, was that our GM had purposely scheduled this scenario to be played throughout the night—the darkest part of night—the darkness between the stars. As we laid out our dice under the sheen of several black lights, the evidence we had acquired from the previous six scenarios started to become all too apparent: This chapter was almost certainly authored by James Jacobs. We were afraid to discuss it, but knew that we'd be probably be up against some kind of Lovecraftian finale that would not disappoint. To find our way through, we'd have to draw courage from our experiences in <a href="/products/btpy8tb0">The Enigma Vaults of Thornkeep</a>, level sixteen of <a href="/threads/rzs2r5jz&amp;page=5?The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon-Discussion-Thread#225">The Emerald Spire</a>, and <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lj2f?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Strange-Aeons">The Strange Aeons Experiment</a>.</p>
                <h2>The Party</h2>
                <p>This part of the playtest was designed to use the same characters as <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">parts one</a> and <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">four</a>. Initially, we had planned on using this party to discover if a lineup without major access to healing would be able thrive in the new edition. Now we would also get to see how well this non-traditional roster of iconics could hold up at very high levels. Thus far, these four had experienced both a nice win and a TPK. However, we felt good about the way they performed during the several fights involving hard-hitting enemies in part four. For playtest purposes, the same four OAD members played the exact same iconics as before. Also listed are the names of each player on the team and the year each became a member of the Order (when a player has reached 100 hours at our table).</p>

                <h2>Highlights From "When the Stars Go Dark"</h2>
                <p>Not long after entering the actual pages of a tome known as <em>The Last Theroem, </em>we were surrounded by malignant theorems that weren't out to welcome us. This became one of those rare moments when something happens on the table that looks just as scary inside the game. Not long in, were left watching helplessly as our goblin and halfling companions stood base-to-base with four gargantuan rune giant miniatures. See our data for how it ended.</p>
                <p>We expected to visit some strange places at this point in our journey, and we definitely got one: a demiplane which consisted of a desert in eternal twilight. It was empty, until a star-spawn of Cthulhu pulled itself from a pit of infinite depth we had approached. For the first time during the playtest, the alchemist hogged the highlight reel, pouring on the persistent damage with <em>acid splash</em> and timely dousings of alchemist's fire to shut down its regeneration.</p>
                <p>Jacobs provided an epic feel in this scenario from start to finish, and the size of the monsters repeatedly matched the occasion. Sajan went fist-and-claw with a gargantuan dragon, in a fight that deserved nothing less than slow-motion for its entirety. The fact that the clash took place inside of a workshop created a heck of a mess—of the dragon.</p>

                <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                <p>To win, we needed to sever the connection between Aucturn and Golarion, which meant desynchronizing an artifact known as the <em>Veinstone Pendulum</em>. Opposing us in the finale was the aberration that the wizard Ramlock had become, fully strapped with spells like <em>time stop </em>and <em>power word kill, </em>as well as adhesive tendrils that gave a 30-foot reach. We tried to trade points equally at first, but when our foe put down 186 damage on Seoni in a single round, we knew we were going to have to take some risks in order to win. Lem made the call, and tried to use one of the four <em>wishes </em>we were given against the pendulum itself. When it appeared to work, we capitalized on the opening, and two more of us followed suit.</p>
                <p>Final record? A winning one.</p>
