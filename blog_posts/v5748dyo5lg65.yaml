  \ amazing designers have prepared for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"><i>Emerald\
  \ Spire Superdungeon</i></a>, it might sound like GMs are going to have to spend\
  \ most of their time preparing these sixteen levels of deathtraps and ancient mystery.\
  \ Luckily, the largest Pathfinder Module ever is also associated with the largest\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8taz\">Flip Map Pack</a> ever!</span></p> \n    <p>Anyone\
  \ who wants to jump right into running this massive dungeon can pick up Pathfinder\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8taz\">Flip-Mat: The Emerald Spire Superdungeon Multi-Pack</a>.\
  \ This set of eight double-sided 24\" x 30\" maps details every nook and cranny\
  \ of the Emerald Spire, from the Tower Ruins on the surface down to The Emerald\
  \ Root itself!</p> \n    <p>And what kinds of things will PCs be encountering in\
  \ these 16 levels? For another sneak peek, this week we continue to talk to designers\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"><i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i></a>. We\
  \ talked to Chris Pramas (founder of Green Ronin Publishing and designer of level\
  \ 7) and F. Wesley Schneider (Editor-in-Chief here at Paizo and designer of level\
  \ 10) about how they approached their levels of the superdungeon, what they think\
  \ a \"superdungeon\" is, and a few teasers on what surprises they arranged for the\
  \ unsuspecting delvers of the Emerald Spire.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      <br>Illustration by Damien Mammoliti\n     </div> A superdungeon to me is\
  \ an adventure location that's going to be the centerpiece of a campaign. Characters\
  \ might go other places from time to time, but the Superdungeon is big enough and\
  \ interesting enough that it's the focus.\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>I designed my\
  \ first superdungeon when I was 12. My impetus was a game convention that was being\
  \ held at Hammond Castle in Gloucester, Massachusetts. It was the first con I ever\
  \ went to and I brought my dungeon with me and ran it there. Naturally, the characters\
  \ never got off the first level because it was a one day convention! Hammond Castle\
  \ was a great location though. I liked it so much I got married there 20 years later.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b><u>Wes</u></b><br> \"Superdungeon,\" \"megadungeon,\" \"ultraextremodungeon,\"\
  \ they're all buzzwords for \"giant frickin' dungeon.\" If a dungeon is the focuse\
  \ of one adventure, a superdungeon is a location (or tightly interlinked series\
  \ of locations) with multiple adventures worth of action. At some point this transcends\
  \ physical size and is more about plot. Scarwall in <a href=\"/products/btpy83yw\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #11: Skeletons of Scarwall</i></a>, for example, is\
  \ a massive dungeon, but the whole castle shares the same theme and plot. It's all\
  \ one adventure. With the Emerald Spire, though, the levels are linked by proximity,\
  \ but every floor still has its own distinctive story (or piece of a larger story).\
  \ For me, number of stories, number of adventures, not necessarily number of square\
  \ feet, distinguish dungeons from superdungeons.</p> \n     <p>As for my personal\
  \ favorites, well, I'm playing through <a href=\"/products/btpy8ypj\"><i>Gary Gygax's\
  \ Necropolis</i></a> with James Jacobs, Erik Mona, Jason Bulmahn, Rob McCreary,\
  \ and Tim Nightengale right now, so that's up there. I also had a very small part\
  \ in AEG's World's Largest Dungeon about a decade ago. But the megadungeon I have\
  \ the most experience with is Bruce R. Cordell's Return to the Tomb of Horrors.\
  \ I was too young to jump in the Tomb of Horrors meatgrinder the first time around,\
  \ so when this boxed set came out in 1998, all I knew were snippets of the legend.\
  \ It absolutely didn't disappoint, either, with its weighty adventure book, handouts,\
  \ illustration booklet, and monster supplement. Many of the encounters were beyond\
  \ twisted, like the gigantic bone-golem gate to Skull City, the twisted necromantic\
  \ experiments in the Black Academy, riding through the planes on the back of a phantom\
  \ flyer, updates of traps and puzzles from the classic adventure, and finally the\
  \ last battle with Acererak in front of his massive, soul-infused phylactery. It's\
  \ a roller coaster of sick, awesome stuff—and the beginning of my love affair with\
  \ winter wights. The art throughout also went beyond the call of duty. It didn't\
  \ just luridly reveal the dooms and denizens of Acererak's stronghold, but presented\
  \ a group of adventurers that persisted throughout the megadungeon—at least, until\
  \ each nameless character got killed off in turn. I scalped sections of the dungeon\
  \ for several personal games, but only attempted to run it as a whole twice... both\
  \ times to my players' terrible, untimely ends. </p> \n     <p>Which I suppose is\
  \ also a big factor of true megadungeons: lethality.</p> \n     <h2>What is your\
  \ level of the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i> called? What theme, if any, does\
  \ the level have?</h2> \n     <p><b><u>Chris</u></b><br> My level is called Shrine\
  \ of the Awakener. It is controlled by a demonic cult and I don't want to say much\
  \ more than that, as the nature of the cult is one of the secrets players will learn\
  \ when they play through.</p> \n     <p><b><u>Wes</u></b><br> I originally named\
  \ my section something melodramatic, like \"Hell of Obsessions\" or some such. In\
  \ the final accounting, it's called the Magma Vault. Totally a good change. Sounds\
  \ less like the afterlife for cheap perfume.</p> \n     <p>As for theme, I knew\
  \ mine from the beginning: I wanted to do the fire level. You know, the Fire Level.\
  \ Every game has a fire level! They're some of the most loathed levels in video\
  \ games because they have—duh—fire... or lava, or magma, or whatever that roiling\
  \ red stuff is that causes you to die as soon as you fall in. I'm talking Norfair\
  \ in Metroid, Heat Man's level from Mega Man II, Death Mountain in Ocarina of Time,\
  \ and the Underworld or Volcano Planet in a dozen other games. They're deadly places\
  \ that typically involve platforms and some daring leaps with deadly consequences.\
  \ If you still don't get it, check out \"Lethal Lava Land\" on TV Tropes.</p> \n\
  \     <p>So I did that...</p> \n     <p>Then threw in Hellknights.</p> \n     <h2>What\
  \ where the inspirations you drew on for your Emerald Spire level, and what are\
  \ you hoping players get out of it?</h2> \n     <p><b><u>Chris</u></b><br> The cult\
  \ actually comes from a home campaign I've been running the last couple of years.\
  \ I wanted my teenage stepdaughter to get a feel for what D&amp;D was like back\
  \ in the day, so I started running an AD&amp;D campaign set in Greyhawk for our\
  \ Monday night game group. The cult was one of the PCs' major enemies and I liked\
  \ the lore I had built up while creating adventures for the campaign. It was easy\
  \ enough to re-work the material to fit in Golarion. I hope the players like seeing\
  \ something that came straight from my game table to theirs!</p> \n     <p><b><u>Wes</u></b><br>\

  \ Well, I touched on my inspirations above, as the theme and inspiration are kind\
  \ of one and the same for my level. I also pulled in references to a lot of my work\
  \ with Hellknights—one of our established Hellknight lictors has a daughter who\
  \ features prominently here. There's also some serious moral ambiguity, a few lessons\
  \ about leaving well enough alone, two new monsters I created just for this level,\
  \ two distinct flavors of fiends, and... <sub>maybe the Emerald Spire's only dragon</sub>...\
  \ or two... or more! Or none! Who knows!? No spoilers.\n     <p></p> \n     <p>As\
  \ for what I hope players get out of it? A mysterious lockbox<sup>*</sup> and fiftieth\
  \ degree burns.<br> <sup>(* Ask Sutter.)</sup></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>We\
  \ really appreciate Chris and Wes taking the time to give us a hint of the horrors\
  \ they created for The Emerald Spire! But there are still many more levels to tease,\
  \ and even more tie-in products to help GMs make this superdungeon an experience\
  \ their players will never forget! Next week we'll look at a few more Emerald Spire\
  \ tie-ins GMs are sure to find useful, and talk about how themes of order and chaos,\
  \ and the Gamemastery Guide, influenced the superdungeon.</p> \n    <p>Owen K.C.\
