  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome back to the first 2015 installment\
  \ of my weekly Publisher's Preview blog! As diligent readers know, I've been eager\
  \ to share news of the next big Pathfinder Battles set with you, and I'm pleased\
  \ to say that the day has finally arrived! The next full set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> figures will be <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a>, a 51-figure set inspired by the deadly dungeon dwellers of the\
  \ Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! The all-new set is expected to debut in June 2015.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Unlike previous sets, Dungeons Deep features six non-creature figures\
  \ that we're calling \"dungeon dressing,\" an experiment we plan to continue with\
  \ future sets going forward. I'll have a lot more to say about dungeon dressing\
  \ in the next few weeks. I am SUPER excited about this development, and WizKids\
  \ has gone above and beyond to create some truly unique pieces I am sure you will\
  \ all enjoy.</p> \n     <p>Let's take a look at three digital sculpts for the set!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71815-Sasquatch.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71815-Sasquatch_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first is one of my favorite figures from the set,\
  \ the mighty Sasquatch! Sure, sasquatches are not known for living in dungeons,\
  \ but I chose this guy to preview first because he's one of my favorites from the\
  \ set and to illustrate that this theme is pretty looseâ€”don't expect every single\
  \ figure to be a literal dungeon dweller. Some stuff made it in simply because we\
  \ thought it was cool! The Sasquatch is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71815-DwarfBarbarian.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71815-DwarfBarbarian_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This is the Dwarf Barbarian, one of several dwarf figures\
  \ in this set. Dungeon denizens need heroes to slay, so we've included several in\
  \ this set as well. The Dwarf Barbarian has a great pose, and is based on the illustration\
  \ on page 10 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>. The Dwarf\
  \ Barbarian is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71815-Cauldron.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71815-Cauldron_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here is the first piece of dungeon dressing, the Bubbling\
  \ Cauldron. The cauldron features clear plastic fire and clear plastic goo, and\
  \ is a nice accompaniment to a witch or hag villain's lair, or a savage humanoid's\
  \ kitchen! I'll go into more depth on the rarity of the dungeon dressing in a future\
  \ post (because I've honestly forgotten how it will work), so please hold questions\
  \ on that until next week. I know at the least that there will be at least one of\
  \ each bit of dressing in a case, but I think there are more. I'll clarify next\
  \ week when I show off another one.</p> \n     <p>So that's it for this week. While\
  \ June is certainly a long time to wait for <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a>, WizKids plans to fill that time with monthly <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes</em></a> non-random sets, each of which features six premium-painted\
  \ iconic heroes and exclusive <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</a> cards to go with each one! Thanks to an overseas shipping\
  \ delay, the series is set to kick off with Valeros, Seoni, Sajan, Seelah, Lini,\
  \ and Droogami the Snow Leopard in February, and will continue with regular monthly\
  \ releases from that point forward. I've got the final versions of the first set\
  \ on my desk now, and they are gorgeous. They are going to blow you away with how\
  \ awesome they look!</p> \n     <p>Glad to be back in the swing of things in 2015!\
  \ We'll see you here next week for more reveals, more information, and more sweet\
  \ minis!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote>\
