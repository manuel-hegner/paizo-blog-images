  \   <blockquote> \n    <h1><br>Roots &amp; Beginnings: Book of the Damned (Part\
  \ 2)</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 24, 2009</p> \n    <p>As promised,\
  \ here is part 2 of \"Roots &amp; Beginnings: Book of the Damned\":</p> \n    <p><b>Wes</b>:\
  \ \"There are a lot of interesting stories about demons in Hebrew mysticism and\
  \ collections of angelology. Sean K Reynolds lent me a fantastic book, the <i>Dictionary\
  \ of Angels: Including the Fallen Angels</i>, by Gustav Davidson, which was a major\
  \ source of inspiration. Another interesting source was accounts from the <i>Book\
  \ of Tobit</i>, which features Asmodeus as the primary villain.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  There was also a lot of ancient Middle Eastern mythology that I tried to fit in.\
  \ It's interesting how in ancient history, when a large religion such as Christianity\
  \ gained prominence in an area, the old gods were demonized. Moloch and Beelzebub\
  \ are good examples of this. Moloch was a relatively benevolent deity in the Fertile\
  \ Crescent in ancient times. What's interesting is that the word 'Moloch' might\
  \ refer to the either the deity itself or to the method with which worshipers sacrificed\
  \ to it. Adherents possessed a kiln shaped like a bull, and put seven sacrifices\
  \ into seven slots in the oven—one was an amount of flour, there were several animals,\
  \ and the last was a human child. There was nothing inherently malevolent about\
  \ this—nor particularly uncommon for the age—it was just the way they practiced\
  \ their religion.</p> \n    <p>\"1st Edition portrays Moloch basically as a scary\
  \ devil with horns. Paizo's version of Moloch promotes him to the general of Hell's\
  \ legions; he is a monstrous suit of armor with a bull-like helm, beneath which\
  \ there is nothing but living fire. He's disciplined, severe, and merciless, but\
  \ aside from commanding Hell's war machine, he's also very mercenary in his recruitment\
  \ for his legions in that he's willing to provide services for those who honor him;\
  \ if people sacrifice to him, he fixes their problems. Should one burn offerings\
  \ to Moloch to stop a flood and save their village, he's probably more likely to\
  \ step in and stop the flood than most deities. The caveat, of course, is that Moloch\
  \ is an archdevil and whether one worships him as part of a militaristic cult, as\
  \ part of the traditions of one's people, or just because his standing offer of\
  \ aid is tempting, serving him damns a soul to his fortress realm in Malbolgia after\
  \ death. But when faced with dying at the hands of a foe, infernal intervention\
  \ for either benevolent or selfish reason might be worth the price of later damnation.\
  \ There's a lot of this throughout the book, evil disguised as goodness or at least\
  \ the right—or easy—choice for the moment. Sure, Asmodeus, the archdevils, and the\
  \ armies of Hell could easily murderer mortals and claim their souls, but why when,\
  \ with the proper nudging, most mortals will damn themselves.</p> \n    <p>Thanks\
  \ for reading \"Roots &amp; Beginnings: Book of the Damned\"!</p> \n    <p>David\
