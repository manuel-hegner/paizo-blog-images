  \ is here! This week we're unveiling some of the hidden secrets of the last five\
  \ remaining enigmatic organizations. Each one has its own mysteries and hidden agendas,\
  \ either hiding in the shadows or in plain sight beneath another facade.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Secret Society</h2> \n    <p>What could be more of an embodiment of secretive\
  \ villain groups than a literal secret society? The group in this chapter maintains\
  \ the facade of a harmless secret club for the wealthy and influential to engage\
  \ in wild parties, but underneath is something far more sinister. Let's see if the\
  \ High Talon, the group's official recruiter, can convince you to join the inner\
  \ circle:</p> \n    <p>\"Everyone who's anyone is, or was, a member, darling. I'm\
  \ so glad you accepted our open invitation. We've had our minds on you for quite\
  \ some time, you see, waiting for you to grow into the handsome young thing you've\
  \ become. Now, see before you this quivering lowlife. Oh, yes, you once considered\
  \ him your friend, I know. You must be pained to see him debased this way before\
  \ you. But such is the natural order of things. He is weak, and you are strong.\
  \ Do not consider this creature a person any longer. It is a base animal, and it\
  \ is only right that you treat it as such. Show us exactly what such a simpering\
  \ beast deserves. That's it! Yes, it's cowering now, so you can take your foot off\
  \ its throat—it's already lost and the hunt hasn't even begun. Oh, we're going to\
  \ have so much fun, my young friend. Take this—mind how sharp it is—a claw for you,\
  \ my beauty, a claw to catch a mouse. See how it runs.\"</p> \n    <p>That's right,\
  \ in secret, the society engages in hunts for the most dangerous game. But with\
  \ a twist: these ailurophiles use magic to transform their victims into humanoid\
  \ mice while hunting them in cat masks.</p> \n    <p>As the ritual commences, you\
  \ can see the child leader of the organization, the Grand Dam, sitting on her throne.\
  \ The society has three leaders: the High Sire, High Tom, and Grand Malkin. The\
  \ High Sire is the Master of the Hunt and keeper of the Great Black Sphynx, the\
  \ society's sacred beast and focus of many of its internal rites. The High Tom is\
  \ Master of the Lodge, the public face of the society, and its primary vector of\
  \ recruitment, propaganda, and internal control. The Grand Malkin is the Master\
  \ of the Rites and holder of its occult mysteries and arcane methods. Despite having\
  \ passed on several years ago, the Grand Malkin still jealously clings to power:\
  \ his phantom is tethered to his granddaughter, known as the Grand Dam. The Grand\
  \ Malkin's guidance has helped the Grand Dam become a powerful spiritualist early\
  \ in life, and though he's a shade of his former self, he retains extensive knowledge\
  \ of the society and guides the Grand Dam in the details of the society's tenets,\
  \ organization, and sacred rituals.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Grand Dam</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>The Grand Dam is the anchor by which the Grand Malkin, a dead sorcerer,\
  \ jealously clings to his leadership of the society.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \  <h2>Carnival Troupe</h2> \n    <p>\"Step right up and see the world—yes, ladies\
  \ and gentlemen, enjoy a show gathered from the disparate corners of the globe!\
  \ For just a few shiny coins, see bravado and oddities heretofore unknown in your\
  \ sleepy hamlet, too astonishing to speak of on public corners and within a sheriff's\
  \ earshot! These canvas walls hide marvels beyond reckoning. Freakish forms cursed\
  \ by nature! Toothsome young bodies guaranteed to delight! Within you'll find contortions\
  \ and conjurations, mysteries and mesmerism, and sights to bewitch and delight!\
  \ All that parts you from this life-changing extravaganza is the exchange of a cursory\
  \ fee! Pay no attention, my friends, to hurtful rumors of malfeasance here. Our\
  \ purpose is but to delight by bringing wonders, lessons, and dangers from across\
  \ the lands to your profitable and trusting little community! Step right up and\
  \ learn every conceivable meaning of awe!\" —The ringmaster, as her eyes glow so\
  \ hypnotically, so invitingly, so trustworthily…</p> \n    <h2>Fang Monastery</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>A secret martial arts dojo hidden in the mountains where initiates must\
  \ undergo rigorous physical and mental training? Sounds like part of a backstory\
  \ for a PC monk, where the monk met a wise master and trained in secret techniques.\
  \ But the Fang Monastery is more than just a training ground for martial arts; the\
  \ First Fang is obsessed with the ancient empire of the serpentfolk and seeks nothing\
  \ less than a return to a twisted order patterned off the serpentfolk of old.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Sinister Cult</h2> \n    <p>What could be crazier than a secret cult\
  \ so dedicated to the apocalypse that they worship daemons, or perhaps the Great\
  \ Old Ones? Why, an apocalyptic cult that worships daemons <i>and</i> the Great\
  \ Old Ones, of course! Of course, the Sinister Mastermind uses his powers of persuasion\
  \ and raw charisma to delude the lower ranks who just want to belong from realizing\
  \ this goal (yep, as the master of a cult, he's a cult master mesmerist!), but the\
  \ upper echelons are full of insane prophets, daemonic agents, and more. Note the\
  \ comedy mask on the front of the cult assassin's crossbow, the symbol of the cult.\
  \ Once you have the book, if you look closely you can find one on each picture,\
  \ and the Sinister Mastermind has the tragedy mask to complete the pair and usher\
  \ in an incomprehensible tragedy.</p> \n    <h2>Slayer's Guild</h2> \n    <p>Speaking\
  \ of assassins, last but not least is the slayer's guild, a religious order of assassins\
  \ who believe in one simple truth: any assassination is just as long as it's paid\
  \ for properly. There are assassins of all stripes, from those who use disguises\
  \ to those who focus on beatdowns, from a vishkanya deadly courtesan (the second\
  \ in command) to snipers of all stripes. The fact that several members use bows,\
  \ like the ninja zen archer pictured below, means that they also have strong representation\
  \ in the secret bonus groups (see below).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ and Florian Stitz</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Wait, did I just say secret bonus organizations?\
  \ I sure did! In the back of the book, there are 22 write-ups of organizations that\
  \ use members from across several of the chapters, either as an adventuring party\
  \ of members all around the same level, a themed group, or a different sort of group\
  \ entirely. Most of these are sort of alternate reality mix-ups of different ways\
  \ to use the NPCs, like The Furies (and all-female adventuring group named for the\
  \ erinyes), but some of my favorites are meta-groups that could exist in a world\
  \ that contains all the groups in the book. For instance, the Legion of Dominion\
  \ is a cabal of the most powerful villains in the book, banded together to help\
  \ share information and protect against heroes by the Eminent Spellqueen, and the\
  \ Chromatic College of the Atonal Arts is a bardic college where almost every faculty\
  \ member is a secret recruiter, advocate, or spy for a different evil group. My\
  \ favorite, however, is the Silent Oath, a sort of henchmen anonymous group, which\
  \ I've included here to close out our final blog:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n    \
  \ <p>An order of minions working across various evil organizations, the Silence\
  \ provides numerous benefits to its members, from a place to vent and share frustration\
  \ at their overlords' demands to an avenue for the organizations to coordinate through\
  \ even when their leaders are too publicly opposed to allow an official alliance.\
  \ With the threat of retribution from their organizations' commanders, members swear\
  \ a namesake oath of silence. The founder is a bearer who managed to find and reattune\
  \ a number of <i>society rings</i> that the Secret Society had forgotten through\
  \ the years. Other members include a cult librarian, the spellmaster, the stagecrafter,\
  \ a shadowcaster, a fang monastery ascendant, the Renewer, a royal bureaucrat, and\
  \ a guild operative.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I hope you enjoy <a href=\"\
