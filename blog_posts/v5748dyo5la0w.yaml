  \ Iconics: Lini</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, April 14, 2008</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>In her many explorations and journeys, Lini\
  \ encountered numerous large animal predators, with whom she seemed to possess a\
  \ certain affinity. More than once, Lini's traveling companions or enclave came\
  \ under threat from some great bear or razor-clawed cat, but with a series of soothing\
  \ noises and precise motions Lini always tamed the beast and sent it on its way.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Lini's success at calming animals came to an end one day when a\
  \ snow leopard bound out of the trees and pinned her to the ground before she could\
  \ react. Her friends scattered, leaving Lini alone to face the beast. Although fascinated\
  \ by the cat's power and speed, and appreciative of the animal's beauty, Lini trembled\
  \ under her massive paw and tears leaked from her eyes. She knew she faced her doom,\
  \ and she found it cruelly ironic how death came to claim her. </p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ the leopard did not strike. </p> \n    <p>\"Your friends have abandoned you,\"\
  \ a calm feminine voice intoned out of Lini's sight. \"Despite the times you saved\
  \ them, they left you to die.\" Although Lini could not see the woman, Lini knew\
  \ of the Norn of the forest and suspected she was one of them.</p> \n    <p>\"Please\
  \ help me,\" Lini whispered, her chest struggling to rise under the great cat's\
  \ crushing paw. </p> \n    <p>\"You do not need my help, little one. You need hers.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Lini looked at the snow leopard, deep into her eyes. She saw neither\
  \ hunger or malice. Still struggling just to breathe, Lini stared into the great\
  \ cat's eyes and asked, \"Will you help me?\"</p> \n    <p>Inexplicably, the snow\
  \ leopard lifted her paw from Lini's chest. A coughing fit then overcame the small\
  \ gnome, and when she finally recovered she looked around her. The snow leopard\
  \ was gone and Lini saw no sign of the Norn. She looked around frantically, suddenly\
  \ alone and scared. A small gnome in a large world. </p> \n    <p>\"Come back,\"\
  \ Lini cried. \"Don't go! Please don't go. Don't leave me alone.\" She sank to her\
  \ knees, tears afresh on her face, until she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The snow leopard had returned. With the delicateness of a mother tending\
  \ to her cubs, the great cat licked gently at Lini's face, whisking away her tears.\
  \ Lini threw her arms around the leopard's neck. \"You are my friend, aren't you?\
  \ I will call you Droogami. That is what we call good friends.\"</p> \n    <p>Lini\
  \ looked down then and picked up a stick from the forest floor before clambering\
  \ up the cat's side to perch on its back. </p> \n    <p>\"Let us go, then, Droogami.\
  \ We have no need for this place.\"</p> \n    <p>In the years since her departure\
  \ from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Lini has collected more than a dozen sticksâ€”\
  one from each forest or wood she visits. In her resting time after long days of\
  \ travel, she sits at Droogami's side and peels the bark from the sticks, smoothing\
  \ and polishing them incessantly. </p> \n    <p>Lini debuts as a pregenerated character\
  \ in volume 13 of <i>Pathfinder</i>. </p>\n    <p>Mike McArtor<br> Editor</p> \n\
