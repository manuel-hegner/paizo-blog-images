  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>When brainstorming a new hardcover bestiary,\
  \ we have many goals. These books give us an opportunity to support new Adventure\
  \ Paths and other products. A new 300-plus-page volume of monsters gives us a chance\
  \ to delve deep into the world’s mythologies and find new and interesting creatures\
  \ from stories around the world. We get to express our love for classic creatures,\
  \ exploring the genre’s rich history and smoothing out some of its wackiness. But\
  \ it also gives us the opportunity to be evil.</p> \n   <p>And we love us some evil.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Monsters have the potential to take on a number of roles in the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game. They can help a GM illuminate his or her campaign world. Monsters\
  \ can serve as the impetus for adventure, calling the characters to quests with\
  \ both words and actions. There is little doubt, though, that the chief job of monsters\
  \ is to bring the hurt. Some of the best monsters are unflinching in their evil,\
  \ and that’s the way we like them. While any monster has the potential for true\
  \ evil, few fill that role like undead. And <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8odu\"\
  ><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>has a large portion of undead. From the life-draining hollow\
  \ serpent, to the soul trapping demilich, to the ship-wreaking sea bonze, all of\
  \ these monsters have an all-consuming hatred for living things and the living world\
  \ that has forsaken them. Even on the rare occasions where diplomacy is employed\
  \ and parley is engaged, all but the most hopeful or deluded adventurer knows that\
  \ an encounter with undead is doomed to end in the destruction of that corrupt thing\
  \ or with character death. Their foul nature leaves little room for any middle ground.\
  \ Even the gun-toting pale stranger—a gunslinger risen from the grave to right some\
  \ past wrong—is corrupt, evil, and must eventually be put down to make the world\
  \ a better, safer place.</p> \n   <p>So if you are like me, you love your monsters\
  \ purely evil, and like to unleash hordes of unredeemable and creepy undead at your\
  \ party, you are going to like what you find when you crack open Bestiary 3. While\
  \ Halloween is long gone, consider celebrating a nightmarish holiday season with\
  \ the ghastly things you find within its pages. You can start with this one: the\
  \ tzitzimitl, and creature of apocalyptic evil, which exists only to blot out the\
  \ sun and end all life that dares come across its path.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ Anytime a tzitzimitl casts deeper darkness, any creatures in the area of darkness\
  \ when it is created take 8d6 points of cold damage (DC 31 Fortitude for half).\
  \ Any creature that takes damage from this effect becomes staggered as long as it\
  \ remains in the area of darkness and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves that area.\
  \ The save DC is Charisma-based.<br> <b>Eye Beam (Su)</b> As a standard action,\
  \ a tzitzimitl can fire a glowing beam of force from its eyes at a range of 100\
  \ feet as a ranged touch attack dealing 10d6 points of force damage and 10d6 points\
  \ of electricity damage.<br> <b>Light to Dark (Su)</b> As an immediate action up\
  \ to three times per day, a tzitzimitl can convert a positive energy effect that\
  \ affects it into negative energy. Doing so transforms the entire effect, such that\
  \ it affects other creatures as well. A tzitzimitl can transform channeled positive\
  \ energy in this way even if the positive energy would not otherwise harm it.</p>\
