  >former editors</a> Jason Keeley and Joe Pasini really are developers now. Of course,\
  \ whenever we're suddenly creating more content—like <a href=\"/starfinder\">a whole\
  \ new game</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">a new edition</a>—we also need\
  \ more editors to polish up all those words!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>James\
  \ Case, Editor</h2> \n     <p>Hi everyone! I'm James, and I'm a recent addition\
  \ to the editing team.</p> \n     <p>I just moved here to the Seattle area after\
  \ six years overseas in Tokyo, where I edited biomedical research. It's quite a\
  \ change being back stateside, but as a longtime player and GM who's been playing\
  \ Pathfinder since its playtest, I'm super excited to be in the editor's chair,\
  \ helping to make the games I love alongside the rest of the awesome people here\
  \ at Paizo.</p> \n     <p>When I'm not RPing, I can be usually be found translating\
  \ and reviewing Japanese music with my headphones in or blowing giant soap bubbles\
  \ in a park. Occasionally both at the same time!</p> \n     <h2>Leo Glass, Editor</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi! I'm Leo Glass, an editor at Paizo. I'm honored and humbled to be\
  \ a part of this amazing team.</p> \n     <p>I've worked as an editor or writer\
  \ for the last seven years. Most recently, I edited research grants at the University\
  \ of Nebraska-Lincoln. Before that, I worked as a writer/designer at an independent\
  \ PC game studio.</p> \n     <p>My passion for tabletop RPGs was born during college,\
  \ when my best friend invited me to play an adventure. While I loved fantasy and\
  \ science fiction, I didn't know a critical hit from a Fortitude save. Once my first\
  \ character, an elven monk, survived his first dungeon, I was hooked. Fifteen years\
  \ later, I've played in or GMed more than 25 different RPG systems. It's this hunger\
  \ for all things tabletop that inspired my love affair with Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Besides RPGs, I write short fiction and enjoy cycling, gaming, graphic\
  \ design, hiking, and reading. I also have a cat named Pixel. I recently moved to\
  \ Seattle from Nebraska, only to discover that I forgot my umbrella, so if you see\
  \ me around Redmond doing my best wet dog impression, now you know why.</p> \n \
  \    <h2>Adrian Ng, Editor</h2> \n     <p>Hi, everyone! My name's Adrian Ng. I grew\
  \ up in northwest Ohio, and I moved to Seattle in 2013. Prior to working at Paizo,\
  \ I was a game tester and copy editor at Nintendo of America. I began working at\
  \ Paizo about a year ago as a temporary editor and was hired on as a full-time editor\
  \ after PaizoCon 2017. When I'm not gaming, I enjoy making music, running and hiking,\
  \ and consuming speculative fiction in all forms. Glad to meet you all!</p> \n \
  \    <h2>Lacy Pellazar, Editor</h2> \n     <p>Hi! I'm Lacy, and I've actually been\
  \ at Paizo for a year now! After editing for a little over 4 years at Nintendo of\
  \ America, I joined Paizo last year to work on the Starfinder Core Rulebook, and\
  \ it's been a blast (get it? Like rockets?) ever since. Some of my favorite things\
  \ include: birds, bugs/arachnids (yes, even spiders. ESPECIALLY SPIDERS), cyberpunk,\
  \ horror/paranormal, and Pokémon. If you like video games, self-deprecating humor,\
  \ and some occasional art, feel free to follow me over on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mahousloth\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@mahousloth</a>!</p> \n     <h2>Jason Tondro,\
  \ Editor</h2> \n     <p>Hey everybody. I've spent the last five years as an English\
  \ professor at a small state college in Georgia, where I taught writing, film, British\
  \ Lit, and comics &amp; graphic novels. But I've been gaming since I was 11 and\
  \ freelancing in the RPG business for twenty years. Along the way I have written\
  \ for Hero System, Middle Earth Role Playing, Steve Jackson Games, Mutants &amp;\
  \ Masterminds, Icons, 3e, and most recently Fate Core.</p> \n     <p>But like some\
  \ others here at Paizo, I finally decided to turn my second job into my first job\
  \ and work with RPGs full time. I'm originally from California and moving back to\
  \ the West Coast—where I have many old friends and an amazing new job here at Paizo—\
  has turned out to be just what I needed. This is a fantastic, artistically inspiring,\
  \ community and coming here has felt like coming home.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
