  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">There's been a lot to follow, not only with\
  \ the twice-weekly preview blogs for Pathfinder's second edition, but also in the\
  \ many discussions about how these might affect <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/rpg\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. If didn't already see it, check out our\
  \ <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lklx?Pathfinder-Society-2-Expanding-on-the-FAQ\"\
  >earlier blog about Pathfinder Society in Second Edition</a>, where I laid out some\
  \ of our preliminary thoughts and inspirations with the invitation to give us feedback,\
  \ brainstorm ideas, and help build an even better campaign.</p> \n     <p>Over the\
  \ past few weeks, the team's been discussing some of the trickier topics with our\
  \ venture-officers, and I'd like to share some of the ideas we've been batting around\
  \ as well as some of the prospective challenges.</p> \n     <h2>Three Competing\
  \ Interests</h2> \n     <p>The transition to the second edition campaign has to\
  \ balance three competing interests: old player loyalty, new player accessibility,\
  \ and ease of implementation.</p> \n     <p><b>Established Player Loyalty</b>: People\
  \ have put a lot of effort into the first edition campaign, from building characters\
  \ to earning GM stars to seeking out rare race boons. There's a lot of investment,\
  \ and many have a strong desire to hold onto those investments indefinitely—or at\
  \ least have them mean something in the new edition.</p> \n     <p><b>New Player\
  \ Accessibility</b>: The announcement of second edition is driving a lot of interest.\
  \ With an outwardly easier level of entry (one book as opposed to hundreds) and\
  \ an opportunity to join a new campaign on equal footing, we can attract many new\
  \ players. The campaign needs to remain accessible to these players and GMs, and\
  \ that includes not locking a huge number of rewards behind having played in the\
  \ first edition.</p> \n     <p><b>Ease of Implementation</b>: Our team's larger\
  \ than ever before, and there's a lot of time between now and the second edition's\
  \ release, but we're not kidding ourselves; there's a lot of work ahead, and a lot\
  \ of that depends on the playtest and what the final version of the game looks like.\
  \ We have to consider the ease of implementing each change, including the resources\
  \ required from the development team, the technological requirements to implement\
  \ a solution, the burden placed on the venture-officers, and the effort required\
  \ of the individual players.</p> \n     <p>For some topics, these three interests\
  \ see largely eye-to-eye. For others, they're in opposition. Collectively, they\
  \ all contribute to the health of the campaign and are part of our assessment about\
  \ how to build the second edition organized play experience. With that, let's look\
  \ at some of the tougher decisions that lie ahead and what the team's currently\
  \ thinking.</p> \n     <h2>GM Stars</h2> \n     <p>When Starfinder Society started\
  \ up, we recognized that five GM stars wouldn't necessarily correspond to proficiency\
  \ with the Starfinder rules. Certainly GM stars conveyed dedication to organized\
  \ play as a whole and comfort \"behind the screen,\" yet we needed a separate means\
  \ of tracking one's Starfinder Society accomplishments. As we look toward the second\
  \ edition of Pathfinder RPG, we're seeing similar indicators.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ means a few things. First, it means that we're looking to introduce an additional\
  \ means of tracking GMs' efforts in second edition games. Second, it means that\
  \ first edition GM stars aren't disappearing; their principle impact is on the first\
  \ edition campaign, and they remain the celebrated badge of honor for a GM's contributions.\
  \ Third, we recognize that this may disappoint some folks, and we're looking at\
  \ ways to balance this by making players' experiences and GMs' ongoing efforts relevant\
  \ in the new campaign. We've been following the conversation in several places,\
  \ and we're opening another thread that focuses the discussion—let us know your\
  \ thoughts in this [https://secure.paizo.com/community/forums\"&gt;GM Stars thread.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Option 1—New Metric</b>: Everyone retains their GM stars, which correspond\
  \ to the first edition campaign. For the second edition campaign, we introduce another\
  \ 0–5 scale metric that's similar to stars/novas. We've tossed around several names\
  \ for these, including glyphs and sigils, but there's no final decision on this\
  \ matter. Glyphs/Sigils would have a fairly similar role to GM stars but be specific\
  \ to the second edition campaign.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 2—Subsidized Metric</b>:\
  \ This functions as Option 1, but the GMs stars reduce the number of games required\
  \ to earn glyphs/sigils. Two stars reduces the number of games run to earn one's\
  \ second glyph/sigil by 10. Likewise three stars reduces the number of games run\
  \ to earn the third and fourth glyphs/sigils by 10 respectively. Finally, a five-star\
  \ GM reduces the number of games needed to earn the fifth glyph/sigil by 20. It\
  \ ends up looking like this for a five-star GM.</p> \n     <ol style=\"list-style:\
  \ none;\">\n      <li>1st Glyph/Sigil: 10 games</li> \n      <li>2nd Glyph/Sigil:\
  \ 20 games (10 less than normal)</li> \n      <li>3rd Glyph/Sigil: 40 games (20\
  \ less than normal)</li> \n      <li>4th Glyph/Sigil: 70 games (30 less than normal)</li>\
  \ \n      <li>5th Glyph/Sigil: 100 games (50 less than normal)</li>\n     </ol>\
  \ \n     <p>Basically, having a bunch of GM stars conveys that you're already an\
  \ accomplished GM, so attaining a similar rank in the second edition would be easier.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Option 3—New Metric with Reward</b>: This functions as Option 1,\
  \ but the GM stars provide a carry-over benefit as a thank you for a GM's efforts\
  \ in the first edition campaign. Assume that the benefit is something interesting\
  \ and flavorful but not something that grants an overtly significant power boost.\
  \ This might be a special character background, fancy item, title, or the like.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Option 4—Something Else</b>: We can, of course, explore other options.\
  \ As noted in the \"Three Competing Interests\" section, there's a balancing act\
  \ between old player loyalty and new player accessibility—ensuring that GMs feel\
  \ they're getting their due without locking too much away from newer players who\
  \ never had the same opportunity.</p> \n     <p><b>Where We Are Now</b>: Our discussions\
  \ so far have brought up sundry variations on the Subsidized Metric and other models.\
  \ That's sparked ongoing conversations with our tech colleagues to assess what's\
  \ possible and with what required resources. We can cook up clever ways to connect\
  \ GM stars and the glyphs/sigils, but ultimately we need to ensure that our solutions\
  \ work for our co-workers. In the meantime, we're continuing to debate the merits\
  \ of each approach, and we're interested in your feedback.</p> \n     <h2>Character\
  \ Rebuilds</h2> \n     <p>As we stated in the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest/faq#v5748eaic9wfq\"\
  >Pathfinder Playtest FAQ</a>, we are not converting first edition characters into\
  \ second edition characters. This may be the toughest decision we've had to make.\
  \ There are a bunch of participants (like many of us, no doubt) who have tons of\
  \ character folders and Chronicle sheets, and that also translates to some characters\
  \ who won't reach especially high character levels.</p> \n     <p><b>Fresh Start</b>:\
  \ The news of a second edition is causing a lot of buzz, including in groups that\
  \ haven't tried Pathfinder before because of the large perceived buy-in. Avoiding\
  \ character conversions means everyone starts at (or very near—see the playtest\
  \ credit section) the same level, and that means that newer participants aren't\
  \ perceptibly \"punished\" for having joined now rather than years ago.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Conversion Options</b>: For practical purposes, the second edition <em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em> will have a limited number of pages, and that means that there's\
  \ space for only a fraction of the classes and races present in the entire corpus\
  \ of first edition books. While the <em>Core Rulebook</em> will contain lots of\
  \ cool options, it won't present contain the full breadth necessary to adapt a player's\
  \ ganzi bloodrager or merfolk kineticist. For some of those class + ancestry combinations,\
  \ those options might not even be available in the first year or two. On top of\
  \ that, there are plenty of character builds reliant on combos that might function\
  \ differently in second edition. Even with the characters who would convert into\
  \ the new edition fairly cleanly, there's a lot of messiness involved in making\
  \ these changes.</p> \n     <p><b>Publishing Schedule</b>: The odds are good that\
  \ Pathfinder Society's second edition release will look a lot like that for Starfinder\
  \ Society's first year, albeit with at least two scenarios per month. Namely, we're\
  \ hoping to provide a bunch of low-level scenarios right out of the gate and gradually\
  \ expand into higher and higher tiers over time. Allowing character conversion would\
  \ leave us with numerous characters ranging from levels 1–20. We'd either have nothing\
  \ for the higher level PCs to play for a long while, or we'd be releasing content\
  \ that's exclusively for first edition conversion characters (and that assumes that\
  \ everyone converted characters that fall in the same tier).</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO9269-Chronicler.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO9269-Chronicler_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>First Edition Boons</h2> \n     <p>There are a lot\
  \ of convention boons out there, and the common perception's that there's not enough\
  \ time left to use them all—much less provide much incentive for earning more of\
  \ them. There are a few approaches we've considered, and from that have spun at\
  \ least a dozen sub-variations.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 1—No Transfer</b>: In this\
  \ model, first edition boons would apply only to first edition. Use them now while\
  \ there's still a good opportunity. From the perspective of new player accessibility\
  \ and ease of implementation, this option's very good. The \"clean break\" nature\
  \ of it makes it tougher for established players.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 2—Boon\
  \ Currency</b>: In Season 4 there was a convention boon called Xenophobia that allowed\
  \ someone to irrevocably sacrifice race boons to it in order to gain favored enemy\
  \ benefits. We might be able to use this model to let players use First Edition\
  \ boons—perhaps only those of certain types—gain some kind of long-term reward based\
  \ on the number of boons used (for the sake of discussion, let's say 10 boons maximum).\
  \ This would allow someone who doesn't want to use her remaining boons in First\
  \ Edition to still enjoy some payoff in Second Edition. That's certainly nice for\
  \ an established player, particularly for someone who made it to lots of conventions.\
  \ It's not great for newer players, and it requires a modest amount of design work.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Option 2 Variant—Expanded Boon Currency</b>: This is really more\
  \ of a variation on the Boon Currency mechanism, not a new way to make use of first\
  \ edition boons. Specifically, the Expanded Boon Currency model takes everything\
  \ above and allows someone to trade in specific second edition boons to qualify\
  \ for whatever rewards we would present for this system. This variant could also\
  \ be applied to any of the other Boon Currency options that follow.</p> \n     <p><b>Option\
  \ 3—Rotating Boon Trade-In</b>: This model resembles the Boon Currency option. However,\
  \ instead of being able to use a pile of boons to purchase a variety of benefits,\
  \ the first year or two would have a few rotating second edition boons that one\
  \ could secure by expending any one first edition boon of a similar style—most likely\
  \ exchanging any race boon for an ancestry boon. This would let us keep any boon\
  \ conversion limited but interesting. It seems to strike a respectable intersection\
  \ between established players, newer folks, and staff resources—particularly if\
  \ boons available in this way were eventually released through other channels that\
  \ didn't require this exchange.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 4—Boons for Benefits</b>:\
  \ This model also riffs on the Boon Currency option. However, instead of opening\
  \ access to options that only established players can access, this allows players\
  \ to expend boons in order to secure temporary/instantaneous benefits that could\
  \ benefit any number of characters at the table. Conceptually, compare it to the\
  \ <a href=\"/organizedplay/policies\">Retail Incentive Program</a>, where rewards\
  \ focus more on giving everyone a little boost or averting a catastrophic stroke\
  \ of bad luck. The venture-captain who pitched this variant referenced the benefits\
  \ of breath of life at the cost of a first edition race boon, calling it \"Life\
  \ for a Life.\" This is a pretty charming approach because it allows players to\
  \ carry over some benefits to the new edition, but it does so in a way that nobody's\
  \ really holding exclusive options over newer participants.</p> \n     <p><b>Legacy\
  \ Boons</b>: During Seasons 9 and 10, we're including some legacy boons on Chronicle\
  \ sheets. Each of these presents some combination of a fun carry-over benefit and/or\
  \ a lasting narrative repercussion for having done something important. You've already\
  \ seen one in a Season 9 scenario, and we expect more in the coming months as appropriate.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When I presented this remark about the legacy boons to our venture-officers,\
  \ I received a few remarks that the one legacy boon so far seems underwhelming.\
  \ I can see where that comment's coming from; that particular boon is more a feel-good\
  \ acknowledgement of selfless action than it is an awe-inspiring boost in personal\
  \ power. I would keep one key thing in mind: the final Second Edition rules don't\
  \ exist yet, and they won't exist until after our community's been able to playtest\
  \ the system. While we're able to design some boons based on the current rules,\
  \ we're cautious about laying out boons that could prove incompatible or disproportionately\
  \ powerful, diminished, or even invalidated based on the Core Rulebook's final text.\
  \ That means that the more rule-oriented components of legacy boons would need to\
  \ appear in a supplemental document in the final days leading up to Second Edition's\
  \ launch at Gen Con 2019.</p> \n     <p><b>Where We Are Now</b>: As I mentioned\
  \ above, folks have pitched a lot of variations on these ideas, each of which aims\
  \ to balance our goals in different ways. Each one—including the No Transfer option—\
  has merits for the short-term and long-term health of the campaign. This topic really\
  \ brings another dynamic to the fore: cosmetic rewards (e.g. titles and fancy wayfinders)\
  \ vs. mechanical rewards (anything granting a notable edge, such as free gear, bonus\
  \ gold, or stat boosts). Just as we're examining the means by which to address first\
  \ edition boons, so too are we looking to what rewards feel the most worthwhile\
  \ and the impact of not having access to those rewards—either ever or at a later\
  \ opportunity—as would be the case for a newer participant. Let us know at our <a\
  \ href=\"/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest\">First Edition Boons thread</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Replay in First Edition</h2> \n     <p>We've seen several threads regarding\
  \ replay in the first edition campaign. This seems to stem from two different attitudes.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"There won't be enough new scenarios to finish my favorite characters'\
  \ stories.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Paizo has taken the stance that unfettered replay damages\
  \ campaigns. Once Paizo moves to Second Edition, they will have already ended the\
  \ first edition campaign. There's nothing to lose.\"</p> \n     <p>Even once Second\
  \ Edition launches, we're not interested in opening up unlimited replay. However,\
  \ we are interested in providing folks a chance to explore a favorite character's\
  \ story to its fullest. There are a few ways forward.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 1—\
  No Further Replay</b>: There are already some replay options out there, and everyone\
  \ would be able to fill out a new Expanded Narrative boon (i.e. \"recharge the GM\
  \ stars' replay\" boon) each year. However, there wouldn't be any additional allowances\
  \ for replaying beyond what already exist.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 2—Favored Character</b>:\
  \ This model allows each participant to select one Pathfinder Society PC to ignore\
  \ all replay restrictions. That could mean playing a new PC all the way from 1st\
  \ level to 20th, or you could make an 8th-level PC your favored character in order\
  \ to play through all of the Tier 7–11 and higher adventures. Whatever the case,\
  \ everyone would be able to fulfill that limitless story with another PC.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Option 3—Heightened GM Star Recharge</b>: In this model, the Expanded\
  \ Narrative opportunity continues but has some capacity for more recharging than\
  \ normal. That might mean someone could instantly begin a new Expanded Narrative\
  \ Chronicle sheet the moment she fills out the first one, not waiting for a new\
  \ season. It might instead mean that there's a limit of one sheet per season, but\
  \ the sheet grants more than one replay for each GM star. There are likely other\
  \ variations on this approach.</p> \n     <p><b>Option 4—Unlimited Replay</b>: As\
  \ noted above, we're unlikely to institute unlimited replay in First Edition, even\
  \ after the new campaign launches. If that's something you'd want to see anyway,\
  \ go ahead an say so, but please also convey what you'd want to see were unlimited\
  \ replay not selected.</p> \n     <p><b>Where We Are Now</b>: We're still in internal\
  \ discussions about the right way forward for replay, balancing the health of communities,\
  \ the desire to wrap up a few select characters' stories, and ways to transition\
  \ toward the second edition. We're interested in hearing your take on what replay\
  \ considerations would be best for the organized play campaigns and community at\
  \ our <a href=\"/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest\">First Edition Replay\
  \ thread</a>.</p> \n     <h2>Earning Playtest Credit</h2> \n     <p>We intend to\
  \ incentivize playtesting, much as we have incentivized playtesting new character\
  \ classes in the past. The especially tricky consideration in this endeavor is that\
  \ we won't have a finalized Chronicle sheet format, wealth-per-level expectation,\
  \ or any number of other key variables until after the playtesting has concluded.\
  \ As a result, you won't see a Chronicle sheet for each playtest scenario, as it\
  \ would be full of IOUs. What's more, the playtest scenarios and the printed playtest\
  \ adventure Doomsday Dawn cover a wide range of levels, which would be strange to\
  \ array in any meaningful way—much like assigning a new character a Tier 16–18 Chronicle\
  \ sheet.</p> \n     <p>Instead we're looking at more of a \"prize table\" model.\
  \ Much as one could redeem tickets at a pubic arcade for prizes, players and GMs\
  \ alike would earn points for special options in the second edition. Each quest\
  \ played or run would earn 1 point, and each time someone plays or runs either a\
  \ Doomsday Dawn chapter or one of the scenarios, they'd earn 4 points. Prizes might\
  \ include a special background, a special wayfinder, the ability to start the campaign\
  \ with a single character at 2nd, or the ability to start with a single character\
  \ at 3rd level. The catch? A player can only select each prize once.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>This comes with a few considerations. First, this does strain the Ease of Implementation\
  \ goal somewhat, as it represents another thing the organized play team would need\
  \ to design. Second, there is the possibility of giving everyone who earns a handful\
  \ of points (let's say up to 10 points) an additional one-time point boost equal\
  \ to (or double) their number of GM stars as a modest way of rewarding GMs in the\
  \ past campaign.</p> \n     <p>Where We Are Now: So far, this approach has been\
  \ going over well. There are still many details to work out, but the system is equipped\
  \ to advertise our playtesting incentives in a clear way, finalize the exact mechanics\
  \ for the rewards once we have the final game rules in hand, and let people playtest\
  \ as much or as little as they like and still have options for what they earn.</p>\
