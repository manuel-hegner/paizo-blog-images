  \ </p>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">June is Pride Month, a time\
  \ for the LGBTQ+ community to celebrate their lives, their struggles, and their\
  \ identities. It’s also a time to remind ourselves and those around us that the\
  \ fight for equality is not over. The first Pride celebrations were inspired by\
  \ the Stonewall riots, a six-day riot against police brutality, led by community\
  \ leaders including Marsha P. Johnson, a Black trans woman.</p> \n     <p>Pride\
  \ is important because LGBTQ+ individuals do not have equality in <em>any</em> country.\
  \ The <a href=\"http://internap.hrw.org/features/features/lgbt_laws/\">Human Rights\
  \ Watch</a> reports that 69 countries have national laws criminalizing same-sex\
  \ relations between consenting adults. At least nine countries have laws criminalizing\
  \ “forms of gender expression that target transgender and gender nonconforming people,”\
  \ and many more countries don’t need to pass laws to ensure their police forces\
  \ and militaries do the work of suppressing LGBTQ+ lives. Worldwide, gay, trans\
  \ and non-conforming individuals face legal and illegal discrimination, abuse, and\
  \ hatred. There are places in this world I will not travel with my fiancé because\
  \ I am worried we will face physical and verbal abuse, and some of those places\
  \ are within driving distance of where I live. Here in America, my rights are debated\
  \ on a daily basis in local, state and federal court. </p> \n     <p>My fellow contributors\
  \ to this blog and I are <em>lucky</em> that many of us live in a country that will\
  \ not arrest us, directly, in most places, for our sexuality or gender. We are <em>lucky</em>\
  \ that Paizo is a company that does not discourage us from expressing ourselves\
  \ in our personal lives, and that permits us to create beautiful and diverse worlds\
  \ that represent the world as we would like to see it. But we are <em>lucky</em>,\
  \ and every gamer knows that sometimes the dice run hot, and sometimes you roll\
  \ a 1. None of that is guaranteed to us, and it could be taken away in moments -\
  \ or slowly, over four years.</p> \n     <hr width=\"50%\"> \n     <p>I started\
  \ with the depressing stuff not because I wanted to, but because I didn’t want it\
  \ to get lost. But that’s not all of what Pride is. Pride is also about joy in who\
  \ we are, and in our community. It’s about gathering and celebrating our lives,\
  \ the freedoms we have fought to achieve, and to remind ourselves that it is all\
  \ worth it.</p> \n     <p>For this year’s Pride blog, I asked our staffers and contributors\
  \ to tell us about something they’re proud of from the past year. I told them that\
  \ it didn’t have to be gaming related; that, in fact, this was a chance to use the\
  \ platform we’re lucky to have to shout out the things that don’t get attention.\
  \ I’d like to thank them all for sharing themselves with me and with the Paizo community.\

  \ <em>Organized Play Associate</em></p> \n     <hr width=\"50%\"> \n     <h3>Alexander\
  \ Augunas, Paizo Freelancer</h3> \n     <p>I'm Alexander Augunas! I'm the Know Direction\
  \ Network's Everyman Gamer, publisher of Everybody Games, and a freelancer for Paizo\
  \ Inc. This past year has been a crazy year for us all, but I like to think that\
  \ I did some good work during the chaos and confusion of the global shutdown. In\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023gd?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Legends\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Legends</em></a>, I presented Golarion's most powerful sorceress,\
  \ Hao Jin (set to appear in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix\"\
  ><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</em></a>) as an asexual woman whose\
  \ experiences with asexuality I personally identify with, a prospect that I felt\
  \ was one of the most deeply empowering and important RPG articles I have ever written.\
  \ Second only, perhaps, to <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2020/07/guidance-the-rot-in-rpg-on-race-and-racism-in-tabletop-rpgs/\"\
  >The Rot in RPGs</a>, a blog article I did for the Know Direction Network where\
  \ I analyzed how systemic racism has impacted tabletop RPGs and offered some suggestions\
  \ on what we as a community should do to combat it. It's a deeply researched piece\
  \ that I wrote in response to the murder of George Floyd, and it's an article I\
  \ hope inspires gamers to keep doing better as a community for those who are marginalized.\
  \ Because I truly believe that if we try, we can change. Games have that kind of\
  \ power, and I firmly believe that as creators we have the responsibility to use\
  \ our power to better the world we've inherited.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Sonja\
  \ Morris (she/her), Managing Art Director</h3> \n     <p>On June 15th, my wife and\
  \ I celebrated 19 years of marriage (21 years of being together), of which I am\
  \ very proud.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Carlos Cabrera, Paizo Freelancer</h3> \n\
  \     <p>The thing I am most proud of this year is somehow finding a better work\
  \ and life balance over the course of it. I know this time has been hard for so\
  \ many of us, but what I discovered about myself getting through it is where my\
  \ healthier boundaries are and how to lay them down more confidently. When my pandemic\
  \ fatigue set in, I signed up for the Moderna trial. When I had to make big, life-altering\
  \ changes at home, I found a place where I can still be a part of my incredible\
  \ 4 year old's life.</p> \n     <p>I am proud I was able to do all of that on my\
  \ own terms. Creatively, this has led me down new paths of freelancing. I have a\
  \ coming project I can't wait to tell people more about—my first ever built and\
  \ pitched privately with the help of a new friend. I am also planning a return to\
  \ voice acting. There is a lot to look forward to, but you know what also helped\
  \ a great deal? My partners of more than one gender who made it a point (in a pandemic!)\
  \ to be in my company.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/14b28767-9cef-4407-abb4-9373651c4aa9/071620_haojin.jpg\"\

  \ (they/them), Paizo Freelancer</h3> \n     <p>I’m super proud that I’ve pushed\
  \ myself this year to accept projects that I would normally shy away from. I’ve\
  \ spent a long time turning things down because of a deep fear of being under qualified\
  \ or just the belief that I wouldn’t be good enough when compared to other people\
  \ who came before me. This year has been a rollercoaster ride, but I can look back\
  \ at it and actively point out my victories and places where I’ve excelled and grown\
  \ as a person. My partner, my friends, and I have watched me break out of my comfort\
  \ zone and restore my self-confidence in not just my writing and editing skills,\
  \ but also in myself and my ability to handle large projects. I look forward to\
  \ another year of accepting things and showing not just other people, but showing\
  \ <em>myself</em> that I can handle anything thrown my way.</p> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h3>James Jacobs, Pathfinder Creative Director</h3> \n     <p>Writing adventures\
  \ about ghosts and cultists and things that go bump in the night has long been something\
  \ I’ve enjoyed, but with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence\"\
  ><em>Malevolence</em></a>, an adventure I ran for several folks here at the office\
  \ last year before writing it up as a standalone adventure for Pathfinder, I finally\
  \ got to create that haunted house adventure I’ve been eager to write. Several of\
  \ the spooky, creepy events and encounters that I inflicted on my players made it\
  \ into the adventure, along with a few that I had planned but they never reached\
  \ and a few more that I made up specifically for the adventure. The in-depth mechanics\
  \ for how players can unravel the manor’s mystery by researching, investigating,\
  \ and interpreting haunted dreams is one of my favorite parts of the adventure,\
  \ and I can’t mention the other favorite part without spoiling something big. Still,\
  \ it’s exciting to get <em>Malevolence</em> out into the world after it spent a\
  \ few extra months in shipping delay hell, and I hope it does as good a job providing\
  \ your group with a bit of escape from the horrors of the past year as it did for\
  \ me to write it.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Amber Stewart (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>It has been a really awesome year for me, and I’m super proud of not\
  \ only having my first AP entry released with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026dr?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-162-Ruins-of-the-Radiant-Siege\"\
  ><em>Ruins of the Radiant Siege</em></a> (in which I’m thrilled to have included\
  \ an explicitly trans NPC Il’setsya Wyrmtouched) but for also finally, FINALLY finishing\
  \ with school and receiving my doctorate (Doctor of Pharmacy). I hope that this\
  \ next year can be just as great and even more productive!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/671e59b1-ed03-42ff-94fb-cfcfe7500fa9/062421_Dr\

  \ Speedling (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> \n     <p>Hey, all! I'm bi and demisexual,\
  \ and I've been freelancing for Paizo for a few years. It's been a tough year, globally\
  \ speaking, but I hit a few personal milestones that I'm proud of, the release of\
  \ my first AP volume (<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027jk?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-37-The-White-Glove-Affair\"\
  ><em>The White Glove Affair</em></a>) being one of them. What I'm focusing on here,\
  \ though, is a little more mundane: I've been talking to people.</p> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ not a very outgoing person, which has always made networking intimidating to me.\
  \ I'd talked to people off and on at PaizoCon, but until recently, I hadn't really\
  \ gotten to know anyone in the freelancing community too well. With the con's shift\
  \ to being online, though, I was more comfortable casually chatting. After that,\
  \ staying in touch with other freelancers seemed to flow naturally, and before I\
  \ knew it, I was in a community of talented writers and fun people, some of whom\
  \ I now count as friends as well as colleagues. I look forward to meeting them once\
  \ in-person cons are safe again! And...well, maybe you'll see me hanging out at\
  \ the hotel bar next PaizoCon. I promise not to flee if you come say hi. :-)</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> \n     <p>Hi\
  \ there, I’m a Paizo freelancer and am proudly BIPOC, queer, and transgender! I\
  \ do other things as well, including professional GMing and voice acting. Without\
  \ a doubt, my proudest accomplishment this past year was nailing my first freelancing\
  \ assignment with Paizo. It’s no secret that the book in question is <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and while I can’t spoil any of its content,\
  \ I think I can share that in the end I was able to write something deeply personal\
  \ that I hope will resonate just as powerfully with other people who share similar\
  \ experiences. In fact, I’m definitely going to be talking about it on Twitter once\
  \ the book is released, so if that sounds interesting then you can follow me there\
  \ at @MistressDanaRPG. Until next time, endless love and support for each and every\
  \ one of you who help to make our community a more inclusive, diverse, and welcoming\
  \ place!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Dustin Knight (he/him), Paizo Freelancer</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>The word I've used to describe this last year has been <em>surreal</em>.\
  \ I'd repeat again and again: <em>survive, not thrive</em>. And yet, I struggled\
  \ every day to do something I could be proud of, even if it meant fighting to convince\
  \ myself that I deserved to rest. But even as I write this, I find myself pondering\
  \ what it means to feel <em>pride</em>. It's tempting to drop names and links in\
  \ some hackneyed attempt to avoid today's undertaking, but it's one I've avoided\
  \ for too many years. Today I'm proud to publicly identify as asexual.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>And yet, I can't help but feel like I'm still avoiding the prompt. So I've\
  \ got to admit what I'm most proud of this surreal year has been my career. I've\
  \ passed so many milestones it's hard to believe any of this is real. Most surreal\
  \ of all was having aced the Paizo design test last fall. Proving myself in that\
  \ capacity and then getting my first hardcover book assignment has been a validating\
  \ experience unlike any other. So many friends have helped me on this journey, and\
  \ this year I hope I've made them proud. Thank you, my dear friends. And thank you,\
