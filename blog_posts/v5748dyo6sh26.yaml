  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It took less than a day\
  \ for the first seven worlds to end.</p> \n     <p>Before these seven planetary\
  \ deaths, before the Material Plane began its storied journey through the Ages,\
  \ the gods had not conceived that one of their own would wreak such ruin. The mortal\
  \ realm, after all, was intended to be a place for the faithful of all divinities\
  \ to learn and grow. Why, then, would a deity seek to destroy what was meant to\
  \ be for all? In those early times before days were days, it could be said that\
  \ even the gods were naive.</p> \n     <p>The glories and horrors of the outer sphere\
  \ had long since coalesced into the nine outer planes after Pharasma’s First Walk.\
  \ The Inner Sphere remained empty of mortal life for some time, a blank slate that\
  \ increasingly drew the curiosity of countless divine imaginations. The raising\
  \ of the First World was a wise choice, for it allowed the gods to practice the\
  \ complexities of creation, to rework and rewrite, and to finally settle on a method\
  \ for the crafting of the Myriad on the Material Plane. </p> \n     <p>When they\
  \ turned to the dark universe at the heart of the Inner Sphere, there were already\
  \ inhabitants—entities left over from other realities, but they were few and far\
  \ between and seemed content to slumber. The gods kept them in mind as they turned\
  \ their attention to the Work and were ready to react should these Outer Gods take\
  \ note of their creations.</p> \n     <p>The Speakers of the Depths could hardly\
  \ be concerned with aiding the work, but neither did they oppose the act of bringing\
  \ order from chaos within the Inner Sphere, and in such act, they provided what\
  \ aid they could. Desna lit the stars, so that their light could reach the skies\
  \ of the Myriad. Sarenrae gave life to the suns of those countless worlds where\
  \ creation would begin. Ihys and Asmodeus, not yet bickering brothers, set to work\
  \ creating the first mortal frames. Achaekek stood sentinel at the edge of the Spire,\
  \ an impartial arbiter to oversee reality’s spread. And the Bound Prince waited\
  \ in the darkest place to welcome mortal death into the world.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ when all was set in place, Pharasma touched the source of the River of Souls and\
  \ began the flow of mortal life into all worlds. Rovagug, the Rough Beast, who had\
  \ busied himself with the eternal task of burrowing through the Outer Rifts, took\
  \ note. He crawled from the rifts, scaled the Spire, and leapt from its edge to\
  \ hurtle across the Silver Sea. He cracked the Elemental Shell and invaded the Material\
  \ Plane and gloried in the banquet before him. He consumed seven worlds before they\
  \ saw their first sunsets but found the food flavorless. Worlds without names...\
  \ worlds without histories... worlds without anything to lose were unsatisfying\
  \ to the Rough Beast, and he did not fight hard when the gods, aghast at the destructive\
  \ assault, drove him back to the Outer Rifts. Desna raised Sevenfold Cynosure as\
  \ a memorial to the first seven worlds destroyed, and the gods vowed upon its steps\
  \ that, should the Rough Beast return, so too would they return to face him again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Much took place during that first age—the Age of Creation. New gods\
  \ like Calistria and Dou-Bral, Torag and Gorum, or Dahak and Apsu rose and began\
  \ the creation of their own domains. Life grew and evolved within the Material Plane,\
  \ and in time, so did sapience. At first, the most intelligent of life consisted\
  \ either of intrusions from elsewhere, such as the visitations of the xiomorns upon\
  \ many worlds, or the spread of alghollthu through the darkened seas they had always\
  \ ruled. But in time, mortals themselves discovered faith and free will, and sapience\
  \ became the spark that would burn the Age of Creation to ash. </p> \n     <p>It\
  \ was this spark that compelled Asmodeus to betray his brother Ihys, who had encouraged\
  \ the flow of free will through these hungry mortal minds. War spread as the rift\
  \ between Asmoedus and Ihys grew, and the first true conflict amid the gods saw\
  \ death and devastation on a scale the Great Beyond had never endured. Asmodeus’\
  s murder of Ihys would bring the war to an end, but not in a way any could predict,\
  \ for that final act would have repercussions. It was this betrayal that drew Rovagug’\
  s attention back to reality as well. As the Great Beyond reeled from war, Rovagug\
  \ slipped unseen back into the Material Plane and fed upon the world upon which\
  \ Asmodeus had first lured and then slain Ihys. The Rough Beast reveled in the flavor\
  \ of a planet that died screaming, its inhabitants agonizing at their apocalypse,\
  \ and so from world to world did Rovagug move, feeding and destroying with impunity.</p>\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>In these final eons of the Age of Creation, the gods suffered.\
  \ Groetus rose above the Boneyard for the first time. Achaekek went mad and consumed\
  \ his own impartiality to become little more than a mindless beast for many eons\
  \ to follow. The Bound Prince gnawed upon the despairing souls from those planetary\
  \ apocalypses and became the First Horseman. And Rovagug continued to feed, slouching\
  \ from world to world and leaving cataclysms in his wake. As world after world died,\
  \ devastation undid what the gods had wrought. It was Sarenrae who finally took\
  \ note, who called upon the gods to honor their ancient vow, who begged them to\
  \ join her again on the steps of Sevenfold Cynosure. Many, but not all, responded,\
  \ but at the final moment, even Asmodeus returned, perhaps hopeful to make amends\
  \ for his act, or perhaps seeing yet another opportunity for personal gain.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A new alliance was born that day as Rovagug turned his attention toward\
  \ three different worlds—Androffa, Golarion, Earth—and as his actions began devastations\
  \ therein, the gods began the work that would end the Age of Creation. Wily Calistria\
  \ distracted Rovagug from his feast, sparing the three worlds and focusing his gaze\
  \ around the least of them—Golarion, a younger world than its two imperiled sisters.\
  \ Torag and Gorum toiled together under Pharasma’s guidance within Golarion to craft\
  \ the Dead Vault, a demiplane metaphysically nested within that could hold the Rough\
  \ Beast. Abadar provided the perfect key and lock to hold the prison shut, a key\
  \ so cunning in construction that only Asmodeus could turn it. Dou-Bral placed the\
  \ Star Towers around Golarion and poised to strike when the time was right. And\
  \ when the Dead Vault was complete, Calistria lured Rovagug into the trap. There,\
  \ he was ambushed by Sarenrae and Desna, Apsu and Dahak, Erastil and Gozreh, and\
  \ many more who would fall in battle to Rovagug’s jaws and be forgotten forever.\
  \ But as Rovagug stepped fully into the trap, Sarenrae cut open the world and dealt\
  \ Rovagug a crippling blow, sending the Rough Beast hurtling into the Dead Vault.\
  \ Dou-Bral woke the Star Towers, and they lanced into the world, stitching Golarion\
  \ shut and piercing Rovagug within, stunning the rough beast long enough for Asmodeus\
  \ to turn the key in the lock.</p> \n     <p>And with that, the young world of Golarion\
  \ became the Cage. The Age of Creation ended, and the Ages that Followed began.\
  \ And as long as the Cage continues to spin, as long as the Rough Beast remains\
  \ within, may those Ages never again falter and die.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\

  \   <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there\
  \ at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that\
  \ world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses\
  \ and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon\
  \ first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’s home campaign\
  \ in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the\
  \ Pathfinder setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and\
  \ in some cases cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\">About the Windsong Testaments</p> \n    <p>On\
  \ the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for\
  \ interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy\
  \ of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered\
  \ as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked\
  \ Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the\
  \ gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of\
  \ these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts\
  \ may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to\
  \ the faithful to decide.</p> \n   </div> <!-- tags:  The Windsong Testaments, Web\
