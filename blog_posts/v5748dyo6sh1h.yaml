  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>The bite of the usqui,\
  \ a blood-loving fly native to the rainforests of Naleobaseq, delivers a parasite\
  \ that renders victims psychically mute and deaf. Its effects on telepathic races\
  \ are quite profound. The resulting silence, a cold psionic exile from kith and\
  \ kin, so shocks the infected that they’ve been found in fetal curls, talking to\
  \ themselves to keep from feeling so utterly alone. <br>—Entomological Survey of\
  \ the Vast, Vol. 131.7</i> </p> \n     <p>To kill time during the stakeout, Shaeon\
  \ composed psychic poetry for her beloved, Kiress. Not far away, vermilliath flowers\
  \ whorled in scarlet murmurations above the city’s defensive walls, and sometimes,\
  \ when the wind shifted, she heard the rush-water sound of fluttering blossoms.\
  \ Enthralled by the shivers it gave her, Shaeon grafted it synesthetically to the\
  \ sibilant where Kiress’s name appeared in the poem, along with petrichor scent\
  \ of the promenade</p> \n     <p>By the time Mataras kissed the horizon, the sky\
  \ blushing in reply, most of the basement shops fronting the curved street below\
  \ had closed. Some laborers trudging home past the fortune teller’s place bore the\
  \ telltale circular welts of animute infection, unaware a black-market cure beyond\
  \ their finances waited behind the door with the great eye sigil. Shaeon felt a\
  \ fleeting temptation to let them know, to watch them batter down that door. But,\
  \ since they weren’t receiving anymore, she’d have to yell the news down to them\
  \ with lungs and lips, with a tongue that always found speaking uncomfortable. Such\
  \ things, made for air and food and water, felt clumsy and inadequate for real communion.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Whatever Oryniri did with his stakeout time, tucked into the shadows\
  \ on the other side of the pedestrian bridge, he wasn't sharing. Taking this to\
  \ mean he might be bored, Shaeon telepathically sent him the newest line of her\
  \ poem.</p> \n     <p>He pathed back with a terse <i>nice</i>, and they spent the\
  \ next few minutes in psionic silence.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \    </div> \n     <p>With twilight there arrived two yaruks, which reared into\
  \ the sky to feast on the flying blossoms like whale through krill. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>The first telepathic alarms were rippling across the populace when one of the\
  \ mighty beasts came down hard with its forelegs to crack the surge wall, then clambered\
  \ onto the crumbling fortification, horned head darting from new heights to chase\
  \ a river of petals. </p> \n     <p>Guards raced from streets and minor walls to\
  \ defend the surge line. The steeple-high creatures weren’t carnivorous and feasted\
  \ on neither bone nor blood. But they got such a narcotic buzz from vermilliath\
  \ petals that most adults of the species were thoroughly addicted. Enough that they’\
  d cheerfully endure bullets and lasers to gorge on gardens of the stuff, careless\
  \ of what they trampled under their massive hooves.</p> \n     <p><i>Think our thief\
  \ will capitalize on this distraction?</i> Shaeon pathed.</p> \n     <p><i>Probably</i>,\
  \ Ory answered.</p> \n     <p>They stayed put, stayed quiet.</p> \n     <p>As the\
  \ yaruk on the wall charged bellowing through a phalanx of defenders, a young lashunta\
  \ urchin scurried past the fortune teller's storefront. Though the Face wasn’t a\
  \ telepath, she employed a few. Two days earlier, they’d marked this girl as one\
  \ of her messengers.</p> \n     <p><i>Any second</i></p> \n     <p>Inside, the Face\
  \ crouched to peer through the window of her shop, adjusted her mask (which today\
  \ resembled an impressionistic insect), and then passed through her door, hunching\
  \ so her head wouldn’t scrape the doorframe. From the middle of the street, she\
  \ watched the wall battle for several seconds before a passing man bumped into her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The bumper—a korasha lashunta, stocky and scarred—paid the scene on\
  \ the wall little heed and instead hurried into a narrow cut-through that zagged\
  \ up to Expatriate Highway.</p> \n     <p><i>Handoff</i>, Ory pathed.<i> I've got\
  \ the tail</i>.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p><i>On relay,</i> Shaeon answered, and\
  \ darted across the crushed-shell blocks of the Gyre.</p> \n     <p>She was rounding\
  \ the Gyre’s south bend when Oryniri’s mind blurted in alarm, then went silent.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Gods be still. No, dammit, no.</i></p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>Feet\
  \ a blur, Shaeon took the broad slabs of the Thirty-Four Steps two at a time. She\
  \ brushed past a stubbled, thimble-hat tourist gaping at the yaruk brawl and reached\
  \ the spot where the cut-through, the Steps, and highway met at odd angles.</p>\n\
  \     <p> </p>\n     <p>Oryniri’s crumpled form lay in the cut-through, blood seeping\
  \ into porous stone. A touch from her mind told her it was just fluids now, soul\
  \ already departed.</p> \n     <p>On the other side of Expatriate Highway, a stocky\
  \ shadow slipped into an opposing alley. Shaeon sprinted after him, arc pistol drawn.\
  \ The shrouded alley bent among buildings like a branch seeking sunlight before\
  \ opening into a cloistered courtyard.</p> \n     <p>There, a man waited, backdropped\
  \ by—</p> \n     <p>—the glittering tower of a lashunta corporation, reflections\
  \ of the fight on the wall playing out across its silvered surface. Each flash of\
  \ laser and cannon flare limned the tower's angles and protrusions, giving an impression\
  \ of—</p> \n     <p>Shaeon shook her head.</p> \n     <p>A gun pressed to her neck.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“On my wrist is a telepathic scanner,” said a voice by her ear. “If\
  \ you so much as bleat telepathically, it’ll show, and I’ll remove your head at\
  \ the neck.\"</p> \n     <p>Shaeon’s mind cleared. Someone had <i>diverted</i> her\
  \ with that tower imagery. Nice job, too. She guessed whoever did it was lashunta,\
  \ like herself. Lashuntas practiced diverting as children, squaring off like gunslingers.\
  \ Fastest mind wins. Slowest comes to in the middle of the quad, pants around his\
  \ ankles. She wasn’t used to being the slow one.</p> \n     <p>Across the courtyard,\
  \ the korasha raised one hand, pacifying, the other hovering near a gun on his belt.\
  \ “Come on, man. We don’t do this.”</p> \n     <p>“I do,” said the man behind her,\
  \ voice human, accent from off-world—Akiton, maybe. The tourist from the Steps,\
  \ she realized. “Already did her partner. Now drop the weapon.”</p> \n     <p>Shaeon\
  \ dropped her pistol before realizing the human might have been talking to his partner.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“She was diverted,” the korasha said, his hand unmoving. “I could have\
  \ escaped.”</p> \n     <p>“Yeah? And what was she gonna do when she recovered?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“I’m fast.”</p> \n     <p>“You ain’t faster than thought. You’d be\
  \ surrounded in no time. Come on, Romalo, you’re the telepath.” Romalo winced at\
  \ the disclosure of his name. Shaeon realized her chances of survival just dropped.\
  \ “What the hell were you thinking, going back to the fortune-teller?”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“One of the flies bit my cousin,” Romalo said, peacemaking hand extended,\
  \ two fingers and thumb loosely curled. “I had to do something.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  No you didn’t. You put all of us at risk, you monumental fool.”</p> \n     <p>Fair\
  \ critique. An alien disease, animute was hard to diagnose. After the first symptom,\
  \ a victim had maybe six hours to take labat before the affliction became permanent.\
  \ All of which meant anyone responding quickly to an animute infection was probably\
  \ in-the-know. After learning the Face obtained labat days before the heist, and\
  \ guessing she must have supplied the team, Ory and Shaeon had monitored the Face\
  \ in case the outbreak forced her customer back. Clearly the human was the sensible\
  \ one—but also the one immune to the disease’s worst symptom, telepathic isolation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Someone’s gonna see us,” the human continued. “We need to kill her.\
  \ Now.”</p> \n     <p>All of us, the human had said. Implying more than two operatives\
  \ on the heist. How many in this alley?</p> \n     <p>Romalo’s hand caught her eye.\
  \ Two fingers fully extended.</p> \n     <p>Shaeon had always been fast at diverting,\
  \ but she’d never tried to beat a mechanical sensor before. She counted down with\
  \ her left hand against her leg, <i>one two</i>—Romalo’s eyes twitched—<i>three</i>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She hit the human with her psychic poem.</p> \n     <p>Romalo drew,\
  \ fired, and the human slumped against her, tumbled to the ground, pushing Shaeon\
  \ down with his dead weight. </p> \n     <p>Then Romalo tried to flee. But, as he\
  \ reached the mouth of an alley, Shaeon pathed an image of her sighting his back\
  \ with her recovered arc pistol.</p> \n     <p>He stopped.</p> \n     <p><i>My cousin\
  \ needs me</i>, he begged.</p> \n     <p><i>Your fault</i>, she thought, getting\
  \ to her feet. <i>You brought the usqui flies. Released them.</i></p> \n     <p>He\
  \ slumped. <i>They were never supposed to spread, just disable the guards’ telepathic\
  \ alarms.</i> </p> \n     <p><i>But they did spread.</i> In the smugglers’ defense,\
  \ they’d sterilized the queen that they used to whip up the usqui swarm. But it\
  \ died, and they apparently had no idea that some warrior usqui mutate in the absence\
  \ of queen pheromones. Into queens. Now Qabarat had an invasive species and Shaeon\
  \ had a case to close.</p> \n     <p><i>I know. But my cousin— </i></p> \n     <p>She\
  \ shot him.</p> \n     <p>It was an arc. He’d recover. In a cell.</p> \n     <hr\
  \ width=\"50%\"> \n     <br> \n     <p>Quiet reigned in the villa, all its bustling\
  \ servants gone. </p> \n     <p>Shaeon frowned at the unwonted stillness.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In the reading room, Kiress's parents faced each other, tear-streaked,\
  \ locked in silent argument. Kiress was outside, staring at the courtyard wall,\
  \ back to the door. </p> \n     <p><i>Everything o—?</i> Shaeon started, and then\
  \ recoiled.</p> \n     <p>Where Kiress’s mind should have been, she’d found nothing.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>As she drew close, Kiress looked up and the cause was revealed.\
  \ Shaeon traced the telltale bumps on her neck.</p> \n     <p>“How long?” she asked.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Five hours.”</p> \n     <p><i>“Five?”</i></p> \n     <p>“It’s okay,”\
  \ Kiress answered. “He’ll be back soon.”</p> \n     <p>A shiver settled into Shaeon’\
  s spine.</p> \n     <p>“Pardon?”</p> \n     <p>“You haven’t met him, but my cousin’\
  s back on Castrovel now, and he’s gone to fetch a cure,” Kiress said, waving a hand\
  \ at the wall. “Sit with me and wait.”</p> \n     <p>Mind numb, unable to speak,\
  \ Shaeon sat.</p> \n     <p>“Any minute now,” Kiress continued. “You’ll see. He’\
  s never let me down.”</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\"\
