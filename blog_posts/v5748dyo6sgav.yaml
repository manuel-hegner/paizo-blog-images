  \ itemprop=\"description\">I just returned from Hurricon in Orlando, Florida. Two\
  \ weekends earlier found me in the Twin Cities attending SkalCon and in two weeks\
  \ I'll be on the Gold Coast of Australia attending PaizoCon Asia-Pacific. Lots of\
  \ travel, but after this I'll only have two shows left in 2018. Around this travel,\
  \ I'm still focused on catching up on the backlog of tasks and looking forward to\
  \ convention planning for 2019. Paizo organized play is still on target to attend\
  \ Origins, Gen Con, and PAX Unplugged 2019 in force, as well as support the multitude\
  \ of conventions arranged by local teams.</p> \n    <p>Some of you noted on Facebook\
  \ that we've been friends over social media for three years. September 28<sup>th</sup>\
  \ marked my three-year anniversary with Paizo. Reflecting over my time spent in\
  \ the OPC/OPM role, there've been some bumps in the journey, but my net sum is positive.\
  \ Part of the reason for that involves our community! The past three years offered\
  \ many chances to hang out with players and volunteers, meet new members of our\
  \ community, and engage in some positive debate on the future of organized play.\
  \ You energize me and help me look forward to the next three years. Here's to many\
  \ more exciting adventures together!</p> \n    <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n    <p>While\
  \ I travelled to Hurricon this past weekend and SkalCon a few weeks ago, I awarded\
  \ no new campaign coins! One of the criteria used by the team and I when evaluating\
  \ potential recipients are recommendations. For those individuals that submitted\
  \ recommendations that haven't been acted on, rest assured I have them in a file\
  \ and refer to them often.</p> \n    <p>If you know a deserving member of your community,\
  \ please email me at <u><a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a></u>\
  \ with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized\
  \ for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend\
  \ in 2018. This is especially helpful if they will be at an event with a member\
  \ of the organized play team (see further down the blog for that list of events.)</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> \n    <p>A new month brings new GM additions to\
  \ the 5-star roster. Huge congratulations to all those that achieved their fifth\
  \ star over the past month!</p> \n    <p>To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for\
  \ the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Kudos on your\
  \ achievement!</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Gerard van Konijnenburg</li> \n     <li>Geoffrey\
  \ Peart</li> \n     <li>Quinn Shannon</li> \n     <li>Alex Bielke</li> \n     <li>Nick\
  \ Oswald</li> \n     <li>Tristian Sullivan</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>The organized\
  \ play team formulated their first draft of the 5-nova qualifications and are soliciting\
  \ feedback from a variety of sources. We should have an update next month!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Looking forward to Pathfinder Society version 2, I've seen suggestions for\
  \ using either Glyphs (using the Symbol of the Open Road) or Sigils (using the Sihedrion)\
  \ for the GM designator. Vote in the poll at the end of this blog</p> \n    <h2>PAX\
  \ Unplugged</h2> \n    <p>Organized play is coming to PAX Unplugged! Led Venture-Captain\
  \ Quinn Shannon, a team of volunteer GMs offer up Pathfinder Society, Starfinder\
  \ Society, and Pathfinder Playtest for attendee enjoyment. We are doing warhorn.net\
  \ preregistration for the first 4 seats at every table, with seats 5&amp;6 available\
  \ for signup onsite daily from 8 am. We feel this is the best way for established\
  \ players to know there is something they can play, but also allows for recruitment\
  \ onsite. Registration opens October 26<sup>th</sup> at 10 am Pacific time. <a href=\"\
  https://warhorn.net/events/paizo-org-play-pax-unplugged\">Visit Warhorn</a> to register\
  \ for games.</p> \n    <p>We also have a Paizo Booth on the floor running demos\
  \ of Pathfinder Playtest! If you're at the event but not interested in a full game,\
  \ stop by and try it out. If you are already part of the Playtest, feel free to\
  \ come by and say hi!</p> \n    <p>Volunteers who completed the registration form,\
  \ look for acceptance emails and scenario assignments before I leave for Brisbane\
  \ mid-October. If you are interested in volunteering, we still have a few spaces\
  \ available. To sign up, complete <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/Winpf95cZt55SPJC2\"\
  >this questionnaire</a>.</p> \n    <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n    <p>Want to\
  \ attend a convention in the next few months? Check out the list below! The list\
  \ includes all the event support requests received to date. If you see one missing,\
  \ ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email\
  \ me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>to\
  \ discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of\
  \ web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you\
  \ are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact\
  \ the local venture-officer for more information!</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block\
