  /products/btpy9ckd\"></a></em><a href=\"/products/btpy9ckd\">Liar's Island<em></em></a><em>,\
  \ when Rodrick and his talking sword Hrym are summoned to the royal court of Jalmeray,\
  \ the con men—well, con man and con sword—sense the opportunity for easy money.\
  \ Yet while the legendary island is as fantastic as the stories tell, and the thakur's\
  \ treasury as full as either man or sword could hope, there's more to this summons\
  \ than a simple social visit. As intrigue mounts and the island's deadlier residents\
  \ begin revealing themselves, Rodrick and Hrym quickly realize that the most important\
  \ treasure they can escape with may be their own lives...</em></p>\n           \
  \  <blockquote>\n              <h2>Chapter One: Cornered</h2>\n              <p>Kresley\
  \ was head of the little lord's household guard, a position that seldom required\
  \ more than standing around looking good in a polished breastplate at interminable\
  \ balls and occasionally kicking priests, beggars, or solicitors who somehow made\
  \ it past the lord's gates back out into the streets of Absalom. Today, unfortunately,\
  \ he'd been sent on an errand that was really more the province of the city guards...\
  \ but the little lord wanted it handled personally, because the city guards were\
  \ interested more in the law than in allowing the lord to exact a terrible revenge.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Kresley cleared his throat and tried once more to do it the easy\
  \ way. \"Rodrick! Come out! None of us want to see blood spilled.\" This gray street\
  \ in a rough part of the city had probably seen plenty of blood spilled, though\
  \ the predominant scent was actually urine.</p>\n              <p>\"Especially our\
  \ blood,\" muttered Haverford, a grizzled veteran with a long scar down one cheek\
  \ who'd been hired onto the household guard because he'd once saved the little lord's\
  \ cousin from getting a crossbow bolt in the face on one battlefield or another.\
  \ Haverford was fond of wine and didn't respect Kresley's authority at all, even\
  \ though Kresley's breastplate always <em>far</em> outshone Haverford's own.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Kresley, Haverford, and three other men—and the wizard, but Kresley\
  \ didn't want to think about the wizard; they weren't the sort of people you wanted\
  \ standing <em>behind</em> you, because what if one of their spells went off by\
  \ accident?—were arrayed in a loose semicircle before an abandoned storehouse in\
  \ the Coins. The wizard had tracked their quarry this far, through the winding streets\
  \ of Absalom, and there was no doubt they'd found their prey, and that he was trapped.\
  \ Kresley had scouted for other exits, and this door was the only way out, since\
  \ the storehouse was built right up against the similarly dilapidated buildings\
  \ around it on all sides.</p>\n              <p>But the thief, Rodrick, wasn't acting\
  \ like he was trapped, and showed no interest at all in giving himself up. Kresley\
  \ wasn't keen to bash his way into a building full of who knew what, through a door\
  \ only large enough to admit one man at a time, against an enemy who'd had time\
  \ to set traps or an ambush.</p>\n              <p>Especially <em>this</em> enemy.\
  \ Kresley had seen the damage done by Rodrick's sword, the holes blasted in the\
  \ little lord's wall, ragged gaps still rimed with frost. He knew the wizard was\
  \ here to take that icy advantage away, but what if the man's magic <em>missed</em>?</p>\n\
  \              <p>The front door of the storehouse was even hanging askew, practically\
  \ an invitation to enter, which surely meant some terrible preparations had been\
  \ made beyond. Kresley had never served in any organized military force, but he\
  \ knew attacking an enemy on prepared ground was harder than kicking a beggar down\
  \ the little lord's front steps.</p>\n              <p>\"Why don't you come in?\"\
  \ Rodrick called, voice muffled. \"It's nice in here. Plenty of room. We can sit\
  \ and chat.\"</p>\n              <p>\"If we have to come in after you, there will\
  \ be violence!\" Kresley said. \"Give yourself up, and it will go easier on you!\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"I see,\" Rodrick called, but his voice seemed to come from\
  \ farther away. What was he <em>doing</em> in there? \"So, if I come out, you won't\
  \ harm me?\"</p>\n              <p>\"That's right!\"</p>\n              <p>\"But\
  \ you'll take me back to the little lord, who will harm me?\"</p>\n            \
  \  <p>\"He... hasn't told me his plans for you... \"</p>\n              <p>\"Oh?\"\
  \ Rodrick's voice was bright, and now sounded closer. \"He could want me for anything,\
  \ then. Perhaps I'm to be guest of honor at a feast, or he wants to play a game\
  \ of towers. Sit with me and sip brandy by the fire and discuss the peculiarities\
  \ of Osirian funeral rites or the philosophies of the Mammoth Lords, just us, two\
  \ men of the world. I suppose that's the sort of hospitality he offers thieves?\
  \ Though to be <em>accurate</em> I'm not a thief at all, because I was discovered\
  \ before I had a chance to steal anything. The indignity of fleeing the palace—\
  of running from <em>you</em>—isn't that punishment enough, especially considering\
  \ I made no profit off this endeavor at all?\"</p>\n              <p>\"You did get\
  \ your wages for serving as security at the ball,\" Kresley said. \"Those are ill-gotten\
  \ gains.\" Why was he arguing with the man? Oh, yes: Because it was better than\
  \ rushing someone who had a magical sword. Or indeed any kind of sword.</p>\n  \
  \            <div class=\"blurb360\">\n               <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Rodrick.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n               <br><em>Rodrick and Hrym are always up for a job, provided\
  \ it doesn't involve any actual </em>work. \n               <br>\n             \
  \   Illustration by Eric Belisle\n              </div>\n              <p>\"Are you\
  \ claiming I didn't provide adequate security?\" Rodrick sounded outraged. \"Was\
  \ the dance floor attacked by hordes of ravening demons? Did ogres overturn the\
  \ punch bowls? Did a bugbear eat the goose liver off a rich man's plate? Were the\
  \ musicians torn apart by werewolves? They were not, and I'm sure my presence made\
  \ all the difference. I gave good value for those meager coins.\"</p>\n        \
  \      <p>Haverford spat and, to Kresley's surprise, spoke up loudly enough for\
  \ Rodrick to hear: \"The little lord paid you for your loyalty, thief. Just for\
  \ one night, but you took the coin, and you made the deal, and so were bound by\
  \ it. You betrayed him, and a man who'd betray another is no man at all. Treachery's\
  \ a worse crime than theft.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Oh, in <em>that</em> case,\
  \ I'll be right out,\" Rodrick said. Something clattered, and someone else inside\
  \ the warehouse swore.</p>\n              <p>Kresley frowned and leaned over to\
  \ Haverford. \"Is that... is there someone else in there? Does he have an accomplice?\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"It's the <em>sword</em>.\" The wizard rolled his eyes.\
  \ He was fat and robed, but he wasn't old, and didn't look like a proper wizard\
  \ at all, being entirely beardless. \"You know, the whole reason I'm here? The reason\
  \ this Rodrick was hired to provide security at the ball in the first place? He's\
  \ just a man, but that Hrym is a wonder. A talking sword of living ice.\"</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"I knew about the ice,\" Kresley muttered. There'd been something\
  \ about the sword talking, too, but he'd dismissed it as exaggeration. The sword\
  \ certainly hadn't said anything back at the little lord's manor house.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>\"I can also sing!\" the second voice called. He—it?—sounded jovial\
  \ and curmudgeonly all at once, like a drunken grandfather at the wedding of a relative\
  \ he didn't like much.</p>\n              <p>\"No, Hrym, don't sing!\" Rodrick cried.\
  \ \"We want them to <em>leave</em>, not die!\"</p>\n              <p>Kresley pinched\
  \ the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. He was getting a headache,\
  \ and this street really did smell like every cat, dog, and vagrant in the Coins\
  \ used it as a latrine. \"All right. This is nonsense. We're going in. Rodrick,\
  \ this is your last chance—\"</p>\n              <p>\"Oh, well, if you really want\
  \ to die, I can't be blamed,\" Rodrick interrupted. \"But I have to wonder if you've\
  \ thought this through. Say one of your men manages to get a sword into my neck\
  \ before Hrym freezes him solid. What have you accomplished, really? You can kill\
  \ me, but you can't kill <em>Hrym</em>. He's a sword. And a magical one, at that—\
  you can't even melt him down. Believe me, many have tried.\"</p>\n             \
  \ <p>\"I daresay the lord would be pleased to have a... a talking sword... to add\
  \ to his collection.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Ha! You don't want <em>this</em>\
  \ sword.\" Rodrick's laugh was booming and hearty. \"He's cursed, you know.\"</p>\n\
  \              <p>Kresley blinked. \"I... what?\"</p>\n              <p>\"My sword.\
  \ Ooh, look, a magical sentient sword of living ice, everyone's always so impressed.\
  \ But, yes: he's cursed. Cursedly cursed.\"</p>\n              <p>\"You have, by\
  \ all accounts, traveled with this blade for many years,\" Kresley said. \"In what\
  \ way is it <em>cursed</em>?\"</p>\n              <p>\"What? Look where I am <em>now</em>,\"\
  \ Rodrick said. \"I'm about to be murdered by a bunch of household guards, of all\
  \ things! Hrym's <em>obviously</em> cursed. It's just a slow-acting curse.\"</p>\n\
  \              <p>The wizard sighed. \"The sword isn't cursed. Are we going to stand\
  \ around here much longer? It's only, I've got plans.\"</p>\n              <p>\"\
  Cursed or not, the very idea of Hrym languishing in your master's collection disgusts\
  \ me!\" Rodrick said. \"Hrym thrives on open air, long roads leading to nowhere\
  \ in particular, and a general life of adventure!\"</p>\n              <p>\"I wouldn't\
  \ mind resting on a pile of gold coins somewhere cool and dry, actually,\" Hrym\
  \ said. \"If anyone's asking me. Which no one ever does.\"</p>\n              <p>\"\
  Honestly!\" Rodrick said more loudly. \"Doesn't the thought of such waste, of turning\
  \ a majestic creature like Hrym into an ornament—doesn't it sicken you, Kelso?\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"It's Kresley,\" Kresley said automatically.</p>\n     \
  \         <p>A long pause. \"If you say so. I'm sure you know best. But your confusion\
  \ about your own name aside, doesn't it trouble you? The way your lord and master\
  \ keeps such wonders—none as wondrous as Hrym, but still, quite wondrous—locked\
  \ up, out of sight in a vault, made useless? Is it any wonder I wanted to take a\
  \ few of them away with me? Those relics deserve to be appreciated, not kept sealed\
  \ away for one rich man's pleasure.\"</p>\n              <p>\"You were just going\
  \ to sell them,\" Hrym said. \"And for sums only another rich man could afford.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"Yes, true, but I was going to sell them to <em>several</em>\
  \ rich men, to sort of spread the joy around, you see.\"</p>\n              <p>\"\
  I get the sense that Rodrick isn't taking us very seriously.\" Haverford looked\
  \ Kresley up and down. \"I can't imagine why.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Fine,\"\
  \ Kresley snapped. \"Men, let's go in.\"</p>\n              <p>\"The first man who\
  \ comes through that door,\" Rodrick called, \"will be frozen into an ice sculpture\
  \ of himself. The process is <em>generally</em> fatal, but at least you'll make\
  \ a beautiful decoration at your own funeral.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Don't worry\
  \ about it,\" the wizard said. He muttered something and made a series of complex\
  \ gestures. He stepped forward, tapping each man briefly on the back of the neck.\
  \ \"There,\" he said. \"Protection from ice, cast on all of you. Go forth and do\
  \ whatever it is people like you do. As you should have ten minutes ago.\"</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"Protection from ice won't help if they've got traps set up in\
  \ there,\" Haverford muttered.</p>\n              <p>The wizard rolled his eyes\
  \ again. \"I wouldn't worry about it. This Rodrick probably hasn't had to think\
  \ his way out of a problem since he first got his hands on that sword. This building,\
  \ it's just an old storehouse, not an armory. They might try to push a pile of crates\
  \ on top of you, but otherwise I wouldn't fret.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Did someone\
  \ out there say 'protection from ice'?\" Hrym said.</p>\n              <p>\"You're\
  \ still a <em>sword</em>,\" Rodrick said. \"We can, you know... cut them. Stab.\
  \ What have you.\"</p>\n              <p>\"But you're no swordsman,\" Hrym said.\
  \ \"No offense, but if it's just you against, what, three of them?\"</p>\n     \
  \         <p>\"Four!\" Haverford called, and drew his blade. \"Five, counting our\
  \ illustrious leader.\" Now he was smiling. \"Things are looking up. These are the\
  \ sort of odds you like, eh, Kelso?\"</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \        </div>\n              <p>\"Kresley,\" Kresley muttered. But, yes—he did\
  \ like these odds. He considered sending Haverford in first, in case there <em>were</em>\
  \ traps, but the man would look at him with even more scorn than usual if he did\
  \ that. Kresley strode forward and kicked the door off its hinges. The interior\
  \ of the storehouse was visible in light streaming through the dusty skylights,\
  \ and the space was almost entirely barren, apart from a few cobwebbed shelves near\
  \ the back.</p>\n              <p>Rodrick stood in the center of the space, sipping\
  \ from a flask and holding a crystalline longsword that shimmered like diamonds\
  \ and sent up faint curls of icy vapor all along its length. Rodrick lifted the\
  \ sword, and a blast of white wind spiraled toward the door. Kresley winced and\
  \ closed his eyes, but apart from a cool, damp breeze, he felt nothing, and when\
  \ he opened his eyes, Rodrick was making a face like he'd bitten a lemon.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Haverford shouldered in, followed by the other men. The wizard\
  \ seemed content to wait outside. \"How bad of a beating do we put on him before\
  \ we drag him back to the little lord?\" Haverford asked.</p>\n              <p>\"\
  Medium bad,\" Kresley said. \"Feel free to break his arms and hands, but leave the\
  \ legs and feet—otherwise we'll have to carry him the whole way back.\"</p>\n  \
  \            <p>\"You <em>are</em> cursed, Hrym,\" Rodrick said.</p>\n         \
  \     <p>\"<em>You're</em> cursed,\" the sword replied, voice emerging from the\
  \ empty air in the vicinity of the blade. \"Oh well. It's been a while since I was\
  \ owned by a nobleman. As I recall, they hardly ever sleep in ditches or haystacks.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>The guards advanced.</p>\n              <p>They were quite\
  \ surprised when a djinni appeared before them in a swirl of mist and wind, rising\
  \ nearly eleven feet tall, its lower body a swirling funnel of air, its upper body\
  \ that of a muscular dark-skinned man, with a very solid-looking scimitar gripped\
  \ in each hand.</p>\n              <p>\"You will not harm this man,\" the djinni\
  \ intoned, dust and filth swirling around in its whirlwind. Kresley stepped back,\
  \ and even Haverford retreated a few steps. Kresley looked at the sword in his hand.\
  \ He considered dropping it so the creature wouldn't mistake it for a threat.</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"Ha,\" Rodrick said from behind the genie. \"You didn't expect\
  \ that, did you, Kelso? I can summon djinns. Djinn. Djinnis? One of my many skills.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"No it's not,\" Hrym said. \"You've never even <em>seen</em>\
  \ a djinni before. The plural is djinn, by the way.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Shh,\"\
  \ Rodrick said. \"This is a marvelous opportunity to embellish my already considerable\
  \ legend.\"</p>\n              <p>Kresley swallowed. \"Ah... wizard? Do you... is\
  \ there such a thing as... protection from... djinn?\" He stole a glance through\
  \ the open door and saw the wizard running away as fast as his sandaled feet could\
  \ take him.</p>\n              <p>\"Guess not,\" Haverford said, and ran away too,\
  \ followed by the other guards.</p>\n              <p>Kresley waited a moment longer,\
  \ as befitted his position as head of the household guard, and then he ran away\
  \ as well.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n             <p style=\"text-align:\
