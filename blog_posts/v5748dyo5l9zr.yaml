  \ of the Pit</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 10, 2008</p> \n   <p>Over\
  \ the course of publishing the first two Kane of Old Mars novels, I've talked a\
  \ lot on this blog about Michael Moorcock. About how he's won more awards than you\
  \ can shake a stick at, and rightly so. How he was one of the pioneers of modern\
  \ fantasy, and created or popularized such fantasy tropes as the weakling antihero\
  \ warrior, the struggle between Law and Chaos, and the concept of the \"multiverse.\"\
  \ So this week, rather than prattling on, I thought I'd cut right to the chase and\
  \ give you a preview of the third and final Michael Kane book, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hq\"\
  ><i>Masters of the Pit</i></a>:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>They came in a howling\
  \ pack, bursting from the trees and running down the beach towards us; grotesque\
  \ parodies of human beings, waving clubs and crudely hammered swords, covered in\
  \ hair and completely naked. </p> \n    <p>I could not at first believe my eyes\
  \ as I drew my own sword without thinking and prepared to face them. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>Though they walked upright, they had the half-human faces of dogsâ€”bloodhounds\
  \ were the nearest species I could think of. </p> \n    <p>What was more, the noises\
  \ they made were indistinguishable from the baying of hounds. </p> \n    <p>So bizarre\
  \ was their appearance, so sudden was their assault, that I was almost off my guard\
  \ when the first club-brandishing dog-man came in to the attack. </p> \n    <p>I\
  \ blocked the blow with my blade and sheared off the creature's fingers, finishing\
  \ him cleanly with a thrust at his heart. </p> \n    <p>Another took his place,\
  \ and more besides. I saw that we were completely surrounded by the pack. Apart\
  \ from Hool Haji, Rokin and myself, there were probably only two other barbarians\
  \ in our party, and there were probably some fifty of the dog-men. </p> \n    <p>I\
  \ swung my sword in an arc, and it bit deep into the necks of two of the dog-men,\
  \ causing them to fall. </p> \n    <p>The hounds' faces were slobbering, and the\
  \ large eyes held a maniacal hatred which I had only previously seen in the eyes\
  \ of mad dogs. I had the impression that if they bit me I would be infected with\
  \ rabies. </p> \n    <p>Three more fell before my blade as all the old teachings\
  \ of M. Clarchet, my French fencing master since childhood, came back to me. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Once again I became cool. </p> \n    <p>Once again I became nothing more\
  \ than a fighting machine, concentrating entirely on defending myself against this\
  \ mad attack...</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p> James Sutter <br> <i>Planet Stories</i>\
