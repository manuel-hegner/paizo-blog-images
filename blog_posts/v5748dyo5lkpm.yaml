  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Overlooked and disrespected, halflings\
  \ and gnomes get by in their own way. Human society's misguided expectations don't\
  \ mean much when you know who you are and what you're about. Let's take a look at\
  \ the ancestry entries for these folks!</p> \n     <p>You might also want to take\
  \ a gander at the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkoy?Big-Beards-and-Pointy-Ears\"\
  >Big Beards and Pointy Ears blog</a> to see how dwarves and elves work if you're\
  \ a fan of ancestries that are entirely too tall and entirely too stuffy.</p> \n\

  > \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Halflings</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Living among taller folk gives halflings a good bit of perspective and\
  \ plenty of opportunities to make new friends—plenty of opportunities of all kinds,\
  \ really. Keep your eyes open and your heart brave, and you can accomplish anything!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Both halflings and gnomes get 8 Hit Points from their respective ancestries,\
  \ are Small, and have a speed of 20 feet. A halfling speaks Common and Halfling.\
  \ Halflings have nimble fingers, giving them an ability boost to Dexterity, and\
  \ are jovial, getting another ability boost in Charisma. They also get one free\
  \ ability boost to put in any score. Now, there's nothing wrong with how you're\
  \ made, but halflings do get an ability flaw to Strength. Seems like a better deal,\
  \ though. Goblins are a bit stronger, but they're not so wise, and good sense is\
  \ a good trade. (<a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkog?Goblins\">You can read\
  \ more about goblins here!</a>)</p> \n     <p>We've mentioned ability boosts and\
  \ flaws a few times now, so let's go into more detail about how those work! At 1st\
  \ level, your ability scores all start at 10. Your ancestry then gives you ability\
  \ boosts, each of which increases the score by 2. Most ancestries get three ability\
  \ boosts, two of which have to go into specific scores. The remaining free ability\
  \ boost can go into any score except the two set ones. Most ancestries also get\
  \ a flaw, which decreases a designated score by 2. You can put your free ability\
  \ boost in the same score as your flaw if you want to get back to 10. In later parts\
  \ of character creation, you'll get more ability boosts, which we'll cover in later\
  \ blogs! (And if you want to roll your ability scores randomly, we have an option\
  \ for that in the playtest so you can see how that might work, though we prefer\
  \ for characters used in the playtest to be generated in the standard way.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now, where was I? Halflings, right!</p> \n     <p>At 1st level and as\
  \ they level up, halflings can pick up halfling ancestry feats that take advantage\
  \ of their size, their gumption, and their fabled luck. Distracting Shadows lets\
  \ them sneak around by using larger creatures as cover. They might also pick up\
  \ Plucky to overcome fear and other detriments to their emotions. They can take\
  \ Titan Slinger to get a bonus to damage when using their slings against Large or\
  \ larger creatures. This bonus increases on critical hits, even before being doubled!\
  \ Additionally, the sling is now a more formidable weapon than in Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition—we've both increased its damage and done away with the difference in damage\
  \ die size between Small and Medium creatures. A halfling with a sling can be pretty\
  \ dangerous!</p> \n     <p>One feat we know will be popular is Lucky Halfling, which\
  \ lets you reroll one skill check or saving throw you fail or critically fail once\
  \ each day. Rules in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> list traits that\
  \ apply to feats, often indicating special rules. This one has the fortune trait,\
  \ which appears on all sorts of things that involve rerolls and manipulating dice\
  \ in your favor. You can benefit from fortune only once on a given roll, and misfortune\
  \ can cancel it out.</p> \n     <p>As mentioned in the blog post about dwarves and\
  \ elves, ancestry entries suggest some backgrounds you might choose that are common\
  \ for those of your ancestry. Halflings are often entertainers, acrobats, or street\
  \ urchins. Many come from hard lives as criminals or laborers.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Gnomes</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>What's THAT?!</p> \n     <p>A gnome's life is a constant barrage of\
  \ the curious, the compelling, the cacophonous, the colorful, and the chaotic. There's\
  \ always something new to discover. There... kind of has to be. See, gnomes who\
  \ don't take in enough novel experiences are stricken by the Bleaching—their colorful\
  \ hair turns white as their minds fall into despair. So let's not do that. Let's\
  \ explore!</p> \n     <p>Now, when you're exploring, it's good to be durable because\
  \ who knows what you might encounter. It helps that gnomes are tough and charming,\
  \ with ability boosts to Constitution and Charisma, plus their one free ability\
  \ boost to any other score. Gnomes have a flaw in Strength. Who needs it? Magic's\
  \ better. And alchemical bombs. Those look fun. Gnomes can speak Common, Gnome,\
  \ and Sylvan, but might want to study up on some other languages too. They can also\
  \ see in low light—all the better for exploring into the dusk.</p> \n     <p>Gnomes\
  \ came from the First World, the realm of the fey, long ago. Their ancestry feats\
  \ can reflect this, like Fey Fellowship, which makes a gnome more charismatic when\
  \ dealing with fey, or First World Magic, which gives the gnome a cantrip spell\
  \ chosen from a wide number of options (including <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>prestidigitation</i>,\
  \ and <i>tanglefoot</i>, to name a few).</p> \n     <p>Discerning Smell lets a gnome\
  \ truly appreciate peculiar food and drink, or sniff out that invisible orc who's\
  \ caked in the clay from a particular mountain pass, hasn't bathed in roughly 8\
  \ years, and recently ate a live bird. (A swallow, fittingly.) And, of course, you\
  \ can choose Animal Speaker so you can talk to all your favorite burrowing animals!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A gnome's younger years will no doubt be weird, so they could have any\
  \ kind of background—even a path they abandoned early on. A gnome might be an entertainer,\
  \ a merchant, a nomad, an animal whisperer, a barkeep, or a farmhand.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>How do these two ancestries stack up? (About 6 feet high, I'd say.) What sort\
  \ of halfling or gnome characters do you look forward to playing?</p> \n     <p>Logan\
