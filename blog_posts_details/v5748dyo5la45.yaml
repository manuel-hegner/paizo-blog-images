  artist: "the church of Abadar. The charges were too spurious to stick, and while\
    \ his father escaped excommunication, the damage had been done—his father's business\
    \ fell to pieces. Shocked, dismayed, and convinced that his father was innocent,\
    \ Ezren abandoned his future and spent his adult life trying to repair his father's\
    \ ruined reputation. So when Ezren finally uncovered irrefutable proof of his\
    \ father's guilt, and he realized he'd wasted his life on a lie, he turned his\
    \ evidence over to the church and said goodbye to his home, his family, and his\
    \ life. At the age of 42, Ezren is full aware that he's missed his adulthood,\
    \ yet at the same time he looks forward to discovering the world, and making a\
    \ difference for a cause that he believes in. His dissatisfaction with family,\
    \ religion, and government left him precious little to trust but his own intellect—\
    in fighting for his father's redemption, he had become a gifted researcher, scholar,\
    \ and intellectual. Lacking the spry limbs of youth, the trust in religion, the\
    \ strong arm of the soldier, or the way with words of the politician, Ezren felt\
    \ he had but one option open. He traveled to tarnished Oppara, capital of Taldor\
    \ and one of the oldest cities of the continent of Avistan, hoping to join one\
    \ of several prestigious schools of wizardry. Yet time and time again, he was\
    \ turned away due to his age. No wizard seemed to want an apprentice who, in many\
    \ cases, was older than them. So Ezren was forced to strike out on his own once\
    \ again. Over the next decade, as he traveled Avistan, Ezren studied where he\
    \ could, picking up tricks of the wizard's trade here and there. The combination\
    \ of arcane study mixed with his worldly first-hand experiences have given him\
    \ an edge over young wizards fresh out of apprenticeship and eager to make names\
    \ for themselves. Ezren knows about the many ways the world can trick and betray\
    \ you, but now he's finally begun to master the art of magic, giving him the tools\
    \ to fight back. Ezren is scheduled to make his debut as a pregenerated character\
    \ in volume 7 of Pathfinder and in GameMastery module U2: Hangman's Noose. James\
    \ Jacobs Editor-in-Chief, Pathfinder"
