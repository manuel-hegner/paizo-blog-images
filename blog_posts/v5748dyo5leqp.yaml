  PTales\"></span></a> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Stargazer</h1> \n   <p>by Chris\
  \ A. Jackson</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Venomous Friends</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Black sails tore out of the\
  \ moonless night, all but invisible as the corsair <i>Stargazer</i> swooped down\
  \ on her prey. Even as the merchant galleon's crew recognized the danger, three\
  \ ballistae cracked in perfect unison, and their steel heads bit into the planks\
  \ of the ship's hull.</span></p> \n    <p>\"Haul!\" bellowed a voice, and <i>Stargazer's</i>\
  \ capstan spun, hauling in the lines affixed to the ballistae bolts, pulling the\
  \ two ships together.</p> \n    <p>The two hulls met with a crack, and thirty seasoned\
  \ pirates leapt aboard the merchant ship in a wave of curses and flashing steel.\
  \ One stout sailor swung a boathook, cracking a burly pirate across the face. The\
  \ pirate responded with an anatomically impossible epithet and a sweeping blow of\
  \ his heavy axe that clove the sailor's skull like an overripe melon. The captain\
  \ and crew of the <i>Golden Griffin</i> dropped their weapons and backed against\
  \ the windward rail, pleading for mercy, hands raised.</p> \n    <p>\"Bosun Grogul!\"\
  \ The voice cut through the night like a knife, staying the burly pirate's hand\
  \ as he raised his axe above the merchant captain's head. \"Stand down! Secure their\
  \ weapons and start your search!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, Captain!\" The half-orc pirate\
  \ spat blood onto the deck. He glanced over his shoulder at his captain standing\
  \ on <i>Stargazer's</i> rail, and the rage in his eyes dimmed. \"Search party with\
  \ me! You others, secure this rabble!\"</p> \n    <p>Captain Torius Vin stepped\
  \ onto the deck of the merchant galleon with the preternatural agility of a born\
  \ seaman, one hand on the silver hilt of the cutlass at his hip. His confident swagger\
  \ was that of a man walking across a street instead of a lurching deck as he stepped\
  \ over the corpse of the dead sailor and confronted the captain of the <i>Golden\
  \ Griffin</i>.</p> \n    <p>\"Where is it, Captain Wayland?\" He stroked his carefully\
  \ groomed goatee, dark eyes narrowed.</p> \n    <p>\"Where's what?\" The merchant\
  \ captain's voice sounded harsh with fear. \"You're nothing but a damned pirate!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Torius grinned—he expected fear from his conquests, but not defiance—\
  and drew his cutlass. The flat of the blade slapped the captain's cheek, the edge\
  \ coming to rest beneath the man's ear. \"A pirate I am, Captain, and I may even\
  \ be damned one day. But not today, and not by the likes of you! If you hand over\
  \ the coffer you're delivering to Benrahi Ekhan of Azir, I'll spare the lives of\
  \ you and your crew. If you lie to me again, I'll feed you to the adaro a piece\
  \ at a time—your right ear first.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bugger yourself, pirate!\" the\
  \ captain spat. \"You'll kill us all anyway. You vermin have no honor!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Torius' wrist stiffened, and the razor edge of his cutlass drew a bead of\
  \ blood from the captain's ear. \"Have it your way,\" he said, but a soft voice\
  \ from behind him stayed his hand.</p> \n    <p>\"My captain!\" There was a rustle\
  \ of scales against wood. \"I can help, if you'll allow me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Celeste!\"\
  \ Torius lowered his sword and glanced over his shoulder to see... nothing. \"Is\
  \ there time?\"</p> \n    <p>\"There's always time, Captain Vin. It's what we do\
  \ with it that matters.\" The voice was as hauntingly beautiful as the night sky.\
  \ \"In this moment of it, I can find what you seek.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then by all\
  \ means proceed, my dear.\" Torius stepped back.</p> \n    <p>Undulating coils of\
  \ starlight flowed over the conjoined rails of the two ships as a huge serpent with\
  \ the head of a woman materialized from invisibility. The white waves of her hair\
  \ glowed in the starlight as she slithered to Torius's side, then smiled, her fangs\
  \ glistening with venom. Torius stifled a chuckle at the gasps of horror from the\
  \ <i>Golden Griffin</i>'s captain and crew; where they saw a monster, he saw magnificence.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Captain Wayland,\" she hissed as she bent close to the man's sweaty\
  \ face. Torius heard the whisper of her quietly murmured spell. \"If not to save\
  \ your own life, then for the lives of your crew: tell me where you have hidden\
  \ the coffer destined for Benrahi Ekhan.\"</p> \n    <p>The man paled nearly to\
  \ the naga's alabaster hue, swallowed, then answered. \"In a secret compartment\
  \ under the chart table in my quarters. This is the key.\" He fumbled a heavy brass\
  \ key from a pocket, and it floated out of his grasp and into Torius's hand.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Mister Caliel!\" Torius tossed the key to his first mate. \"Get that\
  \ coffer, double quick! Time is of the essence!\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \   <br> Celeste is an exceptional woman—in many senses.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  Aye, sir!\" The tall man, a half-elf by the gentle point of his ears, gathered two\
  \ men and hurried aft.</p> \n    <p>\"Celeste,\" Torius said more quietly, \"best\
  \ go below now. Thank you for your help.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Who am I to argue with\
  \ the stars, my captain?\" Her lips curved in a knowing smile. \"I await you in\
  \ your cabin.\" She slithered away with astonishing alacrity, gone by the time Torius\
  \ turned back to the captain of the <i>Golden Griffin</i>.</p> \n    <p>\"Now, Captain,\
  \ there are two possible outcomes to this night's events, and only one ends with\
  \ you still breathing.\" He reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew a large,\
  \ flat bottle. \"Outcome one is that you and your crew each take a single draught\
  \ from this bottle, and forget the last half-hour of your lives. Outcome two is\
  \ that you all die, right now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's a choice?\" the captain scoffed,\
  \ his defiance returning.</p> \n    <p>\"Life or death? Yes, I do believe that is\
  \ a choice, Captain.\" A door slammed, and Torius turned to see Caliel with a small\
  \ metal coffer, while his two companions hefted much larger bundles of finery. He\
  \ grinned. Pirates will be pirates, he thought, then turned back to the captain.\
  \ \"Choose now—live or die. Quickly! If you delay, your choices get cut in half.\"\
  \ He tapped the side of the man's neck with his cutlass.</p> \n    <p>The captain\
  \ cursed, but took the bottle, removed the cork and tilted it into his mouth, then\
  \ passed it to the next man in line. Torius watched carefully, making sure each\
  \ sailor took a mouthful of the precious potion and swallowed. It had cost him plenty,\
  \ but he gauged it worth the lives of fifteen men, given that he'd already taken\
  \ from them a prize fifty times the potion's value. When the last man in line drank,\
  \ he took the bottle back and smiled; the captain's eyes were already glassy with\
  \ forgetfulness.</p> \n    <p>\"Bosun Grogul! Anyone else aboard?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No, sir! Searched from stem to stern.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good! We're leaving. Gather\
  \ your men and get aboard <i>Stargazer</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, Captain!\" The\
  \ boatswain and his men, burdened with more armfuls of carefully selected spoils,\
  \ returned to the corsair.</p> \n    <p>\"Farewell, Captain.\" Torius gave a fluid\
  \ salute that ended with his cutlass snapping into the scabbard at his hip. He leapt\
  \ to the rail of his ship and doffed his hat in a sweeping bow as his men cast off\
  \ and the ships parted. \"May we do business again soon!\" </p> \n    <p>As <i>Stargazer</i>\
  \ heeled away, black sails vanishing into the cloak of night, Torius strode through\
  \ his grinning crew of pirates and shouted down the open main hatchway. \"All secure\
  \ below, Snick?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Secure as a half-orc's virginity, Captain!\" a\
  \ high-pitched feminine voice called back up.</p> \n    <p>The joke elicited a round\
  \ of giddy laughter from the crew, and a growl from the bosun, which was probably\
  \ what the gnome was aiming for. Others, however, seemed in a less humorous mood.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Besmara's boots, Captain, that was close,\" Caliel grumbled. \"You\
  \ put a lot of faith in that wizard's concoction, expecting it to keep our identity\
  \ a secret.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, we could'a took her like a cheap doxy, Captain,\"\
  \ Grogul said as he wiped his gore-streaked axe with a rag. \"Dead men don't talk,\
  \ and it would'a saved the cost of that potion and gained us a hold full of fine\
  \ Qadiran silk.\"</p> \n    <p>The bosun's boldness loosened the tongues of some\
  \ of the other crew, and Torius heard a rush of dark muttering. He shook his head\
  \ dismissively.</p> \n    <p>\"The potion was crafted by a priest, actually, Caliel,\
  \ and I tested it personally. Besides, this way we're free to plunder the <i>Golden\
  \ Griffin</i> at a later date. Set course for Katapesh, and don't spare the canvas.\
  \ I want twenty miles between us and the <i>Golden Griffin</i> before sunrise!\"\
  \ Torius pointed to the coffer. \"Grogul, bring that to my cabin. Now. It's worth\
  \ more than a dozen holds full of the finest silks in Golarion.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Aye, sir!\" The boatswain scooped up the coffer and followed.</p> \n    <p>In Torius's\
  \ dimly lit cabin, they were greeted by the disconcerting sight of several navigational\
  \ instruments, including an elaborate astrolabe, floating about the sinuous coils\
  \ of <i>Stargazer's</i> navigator. She lay beneath the open skylight, but turned\
  \ from her celestial observations as they entered, the tip of her tail twitching\
  \ in delight.</p> \n    <p>\"My Captain, I see that we're underway. I'll take my\
  \ instruments up to the quarterdeck presently to get a proper fix and plot our course.\
  \ Ah, Grogul, you bear the coffer of Gods' Tears.\" She cocked her head in concern.\
  \ \"And you're injured.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bah! Just a bloody lip, Miss Celeste.\"\
  \ The half-orc put the box down and nodded. \"I'll leave you to yer snake charmin',\
  \ Captain.\" He ducked out of the cabin with a tusky grin.</p> \n    <p>\"Pass the\
  \ word for Snick to come by when she's through mothering the ballistae, Grogul.\
  \ I'll need her to open this thing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, sir.\" The door clicked\
  \ closed.</p> \n    <p>\"You take a great risk in this endeavor, Torius.\" Celeste\
  \ turned to the astrolabe, rotating the discs more accurately with her magic than\
  \ most could with two hands. \"Such a valuable prize will not go unmissed.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Not such a great risk, Celeste. The Sword of Man himself would thank\
  \ me for keeping such a relic out of Rahadoum. The Gods' Tears will vanish in the\
  \ markets of Katapesh, and there'll be no trail leading back to us.\" He unbuckled\
  \ his sword and hung it on a peg near his bunk. \"Which was another reason for the\
  \ potion. Better to obliterate their memories than kill the crew of the <i>Golden\
  \ Griffin</i>. Contrary to what Grogul thinks, dead men <i>do</i> occasionally talk.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He stepped to where Celeste lay coiled, her torso swaying easily with\
  \ the roll of the ship as she gazed at a particularly bright star through her telescope.\
  \ A stylus on the chart table scratched down a series of numbers. Beneath the charts\
  \ lay several scrolls, mostly zodiacs of various cultures and lengthy scholars'\
  \ notes of celestial observations. He stood next to her and stared up at the star-filled\
  \ sky; this far from the lights of any city, they were so clear he felt as if he\
  \ could reach out and touch them.</p> \n    <p>\"It's a beautiful night.\" He brushed\
  \ a hand through her silvery hair.</p> \n    <p>\"Isn't it?\" The tip of her tail\
  \ shuddered as she turned to him. \"And speaking of potions.\"</p> \n    <p>A thin\
  \ drawer beneath the chart table opened and a small vial floated out. The stopper\
  \ twisted free and she quaffed the contents in a single gulp. Her shape shifted\
  \ with the potion's magic, her tail morphing into two long legs, two pale arms sprouting\
  \ from supple shoulders. In the time it took him to draw a deep breath, she stood\
  \ before him as a tall, willowy human woman with skin the luster of pearl and eyes\
  \ of midnight, her face and hair unchanged. He reached for a cloak and draped it\
  \ over her shoulders, though she was unabashed by her lack of raiment. Her fingers\
  \ fumbled with the buttons of his shirt, unaccustomed as she was to having digits.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Celeste, Snick will be coming by to open the coffer any minute.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"And the potion will only last a few minutes also.\" With a glance from\
  \ her, the door's bolt clicked closed. \"Time enough.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, hell,\"\
  \ he murmured as her hands explored beneath his shirt.</p> \n    <p>\"Besides,\"\
  \ she breathed, nuzzling his neck, \"it's been far too long since I've had arms\
  \ to hold you.\"</p> \n    <p>He felt the prick of her fangs, then the familiar\
  \ rush of weakness from her venom and the odd euphoria that accompanied it. He knew\
  \ the weakness would fade quickly; he'd become accustomed to Celeste's venom. In\
  \ fact, he'd become quite fond of it... and her.</p> \n    <p>\"And legs,\" he reminded\
  \ her. \"Don't forget your legs...\"</p> \n    <p>Neither of them noticed the soft\
  \ click at the door, or the shadow that passed below the lintel.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
