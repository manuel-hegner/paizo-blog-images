  \ it happened while Kyyduh was alone and on their security shift. <em>Of course</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While others were likely to gripe and moan, Kyyduh truly enjoyed their\
  \ security shifts during cryosleep. Long trip through the Drift? Perfect time to\
  \ read up on all sorts of interesting stuff around the galaxy. They were usually\
  \ bored and twitchy for about two days of their shift, but after that they’d fall\
  \ into an information hole on their datapad and bury themself into some new subject.\
  \ Security shifts were dull and slow, so everyone found their own methods of entertainment,\
  \ and Kyyduh’s was falling into research on a new, random topic each time. They\
  \ were supposed to be more vigilant, given the Drift Crash and everything. Supposed\
  \ to be keeping a close eye on the Drift monitors and the cameras that showed the\
  \ engine rooms and storage. <em>Supposed to</em>.</p> \n     <p>Instead, Kyyduh\
  \ had fallen into an information hole about the history of Eoxian bone lace. They’\
  d found a whole article and several online video examinations theorizing on the\
  \ history and origin of the craft and examining different techniques, and by the\
  \ time they realized an alarm was blaring, they couldn’t have told anyone what day\
  \ it was or what ship they were on. They swatted the button to reset the alarm,\
  \ eyes flicking between the various monitors as they absentmindedly tucked their\
  \ current weaving project (a tapestry of Meyel mid-battle dance) to the side of\
  \ the console. Engines, fine. Storage, a little messy. Looks like some boxes were\
  \ knocked over. Cryosleep—</p> \n     <p>Someone was in the cryosleep chamber. Kyyduh\
  \ stood immediately, temper flaring at the thought of someone, something, some <em>creature</em>,\
  \ interrupting their travels and preying on their buddies. And while they were sleeping\
  \ no less!</p> \n     <p>As the doors slid open, a wave of nausea hit Kyyduh and\
  \ they stumbled, grabbing onto a nearby container for support. They shook their\
  \ head, feeling the plants that made up part of their body start to shift within\
  \ their lungs and throat, allowing them to breathe more easily and fight off this\
  \ sickness. They glanced up and spotted the intruder who, strangely surrounded by\
  \ floating lights, was moving toward the life support systems.</p> \n     <p>“Hey!\
  \ Not quite!” Kyyduh’s temper returned tenfold, and they jerked their arm, reforming\
  \ it into a threatening cannon. “Turn around and hold still!” Their body vibrated\
  \ softly as it readied an explosive shot, taking aim to hit the intruder and not\
  \ any of the delicate support systems.</p> \n     <p>The intruder whipped around\
  \ and Kyyduh caught a surprise burst of energy in the chest, knocking the air from\
  \ their lungs, though the vines around their torso whipped together to form a bond\
  \ that shielded them from most of the damage. With a roar they fired off a wild\
  \ shot, missing the intruder but illuminating them enough to provide some more information.\
  \ Strange hair, strange symbols— Oh by Meyel’s whiskers, a <em>hesper</em>? Here?</p>\

  \     <p>They grit their teeth as the fey snarled at them, gathering energy around\
  \ his body. Kyyduh took a few breaths, unable to fully calm down before another\
  \ energy shot hit them in the chest, knocking them back against Raia’s chamber.\
  \ The safety glass cracked beneath them, and Kyyduh saw red. They lunged for the\
  \ hesper, shifting their arm into a claw just before they body-slammed into him,\
  \ kicking him out of his float and onto the ground. The hesper struggled against\
  \ Kyyduh’s weight, the denseness of his body working against him to keep him down.\
  \ Kyyduh moved to hit him with their claw, but stopped when the reflection of their\
  \ symbol of Meyel in the metal of a nearby chamber drew their eye to the expression\
  \ on the hesper’s face. He wore a look of struggle and desperation, his cheeks thinner\
  \ than they should be. Kyyduh forced themself to breathe, then gave the hesper a\
  \ good shake.</p> \n     <p>“Calm down and tell me what you’re doing!” they demanded,\
  \ dodging the hesper’s weak attempt to strike them once more. “Alright, enough with\
  \ the hitting, come on!” They gave him another shake, slightly swatting at his face\
  \ with their free hand. The swat seemed to startle the fey, at least enough that\
  \ their radiation field dropped, letting Kyyduh breathe comfortably and sit up,\
  \ dragging him with them. “Let’s start with the basics. What’s your name, bud?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Thakvine.” The hesper finally got out, calming down despite his\
  \ repeated glances back at the life support systems. “Please, the Drift guided me\
  \ here and I’m so <em>hungry</em>... Just a little bit of the power. <em>Please</em>.\
  \ I need some. It’s been so long...”</p> \n     <p>Kyyduh gave him an inquisitive\
  \ look, then a nod. “Don’t drain it dry. And you owe me.” They eased off, letting\
  \ Thakvine stand and following him to the systems. Thakvine nodded in eager agreement,\
  \ taking a moment as he pressed close to the machinery, absorbing the excess energy.\
  \ After a moment, he looked back at Kyyduh, reaching out his hand and shifting it,\
  \ making an exact copy of Kyyduh’s claw.</p> \n     <p>“You also change?” The fey\
  \ asked, watching them.</p> \n     <p>“Yeah. Couple of years now. Not mutations,\
  \ but plants and stuff. Doctors say I’m a natural at adaptation.” Kyyduh puffed\
  \ their chest out, looking proud.</p> \n     <p>“Can you show me more? Like the\
  \ gun, the cannon?” Thakvine, no longer gaunt looking, now wore a fascinated expression,\
  \ moving closer to examine the moving plant life on Kyyduh’s body and armor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The chitin on Kyyduh’s chest shifted, retracting, and they gave their\
  \ claw a shake, reforming into its usual conical shape. “Sure.” They shrugged, giving\
  \ Thakvine a smile. “<em>But</em> you’re a crew member now. Welcome to <em>Sunrise\
  \ Maiden</em>. Your job is to help keep us focused during security shifts. Deal?”\
  \ They held out their hand for a shake, laughing as Thakvine shook a single finger.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Deal.” He agreed, before mimicking Kyyduh’s claw again.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Kyyduh laughed, wrapping an arm around Thakvine’s shoulders and glancing back\
  \ as Raia’s chamber hissed open. “Hey! New crewmate!”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
