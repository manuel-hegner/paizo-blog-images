  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">In the Event of My\
  \ Untimely Demise</h1> \n   <p>by Robin D. Laws</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Old\
  \ Comrades</h2> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The trim, white-haired man\
  \ responded with seasoned stillness to Luma's knee and sickle. His foreign-accented\
  \ voice purred soothingly, with a hint of disarming irony. \"Who am I and why I\
  \ am I following you? I might equally ask whose blade caresses my jugular.\"</span></p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Depending on your answer,\" Luma replied, \"I might tell you.\" She\
  \ glanced at the alleyway's mouth. The street it jutted onto was not such a quiet\
  \ one. This was in Dockway, where most folk would note a waylaying in an alley and\
  \ keep going, unblinking. But trouble only took one busybody. </p> \n   <p>Prominent\
  \ veins ran like engorged streams across the man's papery, spotted hands. Around\
  \ his wrist coiled a silver chain bearing a charm—a rat perched on a raft. From\
  \ her reading, Luma vaguely recalled this as the symbol of an obscure river god\
  \ from the faraway River Kingdoms. The man was likely a priest, able to call down\
  \ magic from his deity, much as Luma did from the city itself.</p> \n   <p>\"What\
  \ would you say, young lady, if I told you I wasn't following you?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma\
  \ couldn't help finding him likeable—and resenting people who projected charm so\
  \ readily. \"I'm not that young, and a lady only by the skin of my nails.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"When you get to my age, you'll consider everyone young. And I wasn't\
  \ following you, I was following the dwarf.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Jordyar.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"You've met my truculent former colleague, then. Honestly, my dear, let me\
  \ up. We may discover common goals.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Introduce yourself first.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I am Rieslan, once known as Rieslan the Drowner, now sadly diminished.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Luma relaxed the pressure of her knee on his spine. \"And let me guess.\
  \ You went with Jordyar and Aruhal into the Demonsweald, in search of a valuable\
  \ reliquary.\"</p> \n   <p>Rieslan sighed. \"He told you about that, did he? Dear\
  \ fellow's grown talkative in his dotage.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm going to let you up,\
  \ Rieslan. Try anything and you'll—\"</p> \n   <p>\"No need to complete the threat,\"\
  \ said the river cleric. \"I've had a long career, and heard them all.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Luma got up, her sickle still ready. \"You shadowed him in case he was pursued?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Rieslan rose, brushing gravel from his leggings. \"That's what I thought\
  \ you were doing, my dear. Jordyar and I have had a falling out, shall we say, since\
  \ the old days. I know why I'm chasing him. Why are you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'll ask\
  \ the questions,\" Luma said, watching him rub his creaking finger joints. \"I suppose\
  \ you've heard that, too.\"</p> \n   <p>The old priest twinkled at her. \"Very well.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I care about the reliquary only insofar as it might have led to my\
  \ client's murder.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your client?\" Rieslan interjected. \"You work\
  \ for Aruhal's estate?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma nodded.</p> \n   <p>Rieslan steadied himself\
  \ against the wall. \"Someone might have hastened his demise for it. But it wouldn't\
  \ be me. Or Jordyar, for that matter.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Why not?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Haven't you found it notable that we waited till we got word of Aruhal's death to\
  \ come for it? He had a curse placed on himself. Whosoever slays Aruhal will himself\
  \ be slain.\" The priest studied Luma's expression. \"You look like someone who's\
  \ just had an epiphany.\"</p> \n   <p>Luma flushed. She hated it when others saw\
  \ through her. \"How did you hear of this curse?\"</p> \n   <p>\"He sent a messenger,\
  \ to warn us, back when we still stalked him for our share of the loot.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"He told you he had a curse placed on himself, and you accepted it as truth?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Rieslan held his hands together, as if in prayer. \"I asked my god,\
  \ Hanspur, and was told it was true.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But, as in the way of gods,\
  \ received no clearer details.\"</p> \n   <p>Rieslan winced.</p> \n   <p>\"What\
  \ is it?\" Luma asked.</p> \n   <p>He waved her question away. \"I get headaches.\
  \ It is nothing.\"</p> \n   <p>\"So you and your comrades—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Former\
  \ comrades,\" Rieslan said.</p> \n   <p>\"You all waited until you learned of his\
  \ death, then came for the treasure. How did you hear of it?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Naphrax\
  \ posted a spy, who sent word that Aruhal was sick. Jordyar had Naphrax's dogsbody\
  \ in his pay, and so learned that Naphrax had broken from his seclusion and was\
  \ bound for Magnimar. And of course I have been keeping an eye on Jordyar.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"This Naphrax, he's your party's other survivor? Let me guess—a wizard?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>A vein pulsed on Rieslan's forehead. \"Sorcerer, but let's not make\
  \ fine distinctions.\"</p> \n   <p>A spell-slinger complicated the possibilities.\
  \ He might have found a way to break the curse, and killed Aruhal off despite it.\
  \ But then, why wait until he was sick?</p> \n   <p>Luma caught herself playing\
  \ with her hair again and stopped. \"Let see where that leaves us. I don't care\
  \ about the treasure. You have no particular reason to protect Aruhal's killer—\
  if indeed he was killed at all. Does that about sum it up?\"</p> \n   <p>Rieslan\
  \ crinkled aged dimples at her. \"Much gold is at stake. You'll excuse me if I greet\
  \ your disinterest in it with a certain skepticism.\"</p> \n   <p>Luma, affronted,\
  \ tried to cover it up with a smile. \"Ask around about the Derexhi family. Our\
  \ reputation for honesty is worth more than your treasure.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \ \n   <p>\"A thousand pardons, my dear.\"</p> \n   <p>Don't call me dear, Luma\
  \ wanted to say. \"At any rate, we have each spoiled the other's attempt to follow\
  \ Jordyar. I suggest we part, with no hard feelings.\"</p> \n   <p>The priest bowed\
  \ deep, and went on his way.</p> \n   <p>Luma signaled to her brother Ontor, who\
  \ for several minutes had been standing across the way. He'd appeared in her peripheral\
  \ vision, sauntering down the street, looking for her. Seeing her occupied, he'd\
  \ dropped into a pose, engaging in conversation with loitering dockworkers. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>It never surprised Luma to see one of her siblings appear out of the blue\
  \ like this. Her sister Iskola could see from afar, and whisper into distant ears.\
  \ Wherever she was in Magnimar, one of the others could always find her.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Ontor required no further instructions. Adopting a languid lope, he pushed\
  \ off after Rieslan.</p> \n   <p>Iskola's spells didn't permit them to communicate\
  \ with one another, so Luma would find a rendezvous and wait. She ambled for the\
  \ closest of the Derexhi haunts, a spot named after its proprietor, Chanda, who\
  \ specialized in bream broth and walnut bread. Luma claimed the darkest corner,\
  \ where Chanda, unbidden, brought her soup, half a loaf of the bread, and a bowl\
  \ of sea snails in red garlic sauce. Luma paid Chanda the usual premium for a lengthy\
  \ stay and settled in.</p> \n   <p>An hour later, Ontor slid into the seat across\
  \ from her, a sea snail bowl already in one hand and a half-filled ale flagon in\
  \ the other. \"You'll be happy to hear I was also deemed too much a black sheep\
  \ for the Vitellus job.\"</p> \n   <p>Family politics could wait, Luma decided.\
  \ There was a mystery to solve. Even if the answer was that there was no mystery\
  \ at all. \"Where did he go?\"</p> \n   <p>Ontor threw his head back, dropped a\
  \ sea snail in, and swallowed, pleased with his show of downmarket manners. The\
  \ stevedores filling the restaurant ate the same way. \"He's staking out a hovel\
  \ down in Rag's End. Waiting for someone to show. Since I have no idea of the situation,\
  \ I figured I'd come and collect you, and we'd check the place out together.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Luma dunked a final bread crust into the remnants of her broth.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Ontor wiped ale-foam from his lips. \"That was a hint, by the way. A request\
  \ for context.\"</p> \n   <p>Luma briefed him on the case to date: the prearranged,\
  \ posthumous assignment; the widow and her pleurisy story; Jordyar the dwarf and\
  \ then Rieslan the river-cleric and their tangled, treacherous history with Aruhal.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ontor gobbled the rest of his food. \"So you reckon this Rieslan knows\
  \ where Jordyar is staying, and, having lost him in Dockway, has gone there to wait\
  \ for him?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma hadn't so reckoned, but would have, given one more\
  \ moment's thought. The two half-siblings set out for Rag's End.</p> \n   <p align=\"\
  center\">∗∗∗</p> \n   <p> As ramshackle as its name suggested, Rag's End stretched\
  \ out before them as an expanse of hovels and shanties. Luma and Ontor strode with\
  \ dispatch past a crowd gathered for an impromptu match between a mastiff and a\
  \ crab spider half again its size. Sensing a form of authority approaching, the\
  \ bettors hunched and turned their faces away. A jagged laneway sloped gently into\
  \ a depression. As Ontor led Luma down its length, a gathering fog grew from scattered\
  \ wisps to an obscuring mass. </p> \n   <p>At the end of the cul-de-sac a two-story\
  \ structure held itself with lordly remove from the surrounding shacks. To its left,\
  \ a cloud of flies buzzed around a heap of rotting trash. Piles of rubble, wood\
  \ and masonry mostly, formed an unintended fence around the building's right side.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"That's where your old duffer was waiting,\" Ontor said. </p> \n   <p>Luma\
  \ peered into the twilight. There was no immediate sign of Rieslan now. Lamplight\
  \ issued from an open window facing the debris wall.</p> \n   <p>\"He's either gone\
  \ in,\" Ontor whispered, \"or gone entirely. But someone must be in there.\" He\
  \ wasn't so much stating the obvious as asking: do we go in and see?</p> \n   <p>In\
  \ reply, Luma nodded. Hunching, the two of them covered the distance to the wall,\
  \ and then to the side of the house.</p> \n   <p>Luma let in the citysong, hearing\
  \ the whispers and shushes of the billowing fog. Cozened by her spell, it pooled\
  \ around them, its protective mantle blending naturally with the mist flowing through\
  \ the neighborhood. They could see into the house, while anyone looking out would\
  \ see only swirling vapor.</p> \n   <p>Inside Luma saw two familiar individuals,\
  \ and two unfamiliar. </p> \n   <p>Jordyar sat atop a wooden table, picking at his\
  \ rotting teeth with his fingers. Rieslan slumped in a chair, shoved in a corner.\
  \ Ropes bound his waist, arms, and ankles. Wet blood reddened his goatee. His divine\
  \ charm, with its rat and raft motif, swung from a rafter, a good twenty feet away.\
  \ Without it, Luma knew, he wouldn't be able to shape his appeals to the realms\
  \ beyond, and would receive no magic from his god.</p> \n   <p>A second, much younger\
  \ man was also tied to a chair, this one positioned in the center of the room. Muscular\
  \ and tanned, he would have been handsome, prior to the beating he'd taken. His\
  \ face swelled and purpled; scorched holes in his tunic revealed burned skin beneath.\
  \ Still conscious, the man seemed to be willing himself to pass out, and failing\
  \ at it.</p> \n   <p>Over him stood a creased, leathery man dressed in a suede robe\
  \ dotted with turquoise and agate beads. He wore a vest with no shirt beneath it,\
  \ showing off the puffy muscles of a fit but elderly man. Greasy black hair hung\
  \ straight from his scalp down to his shoulders. A long mustache drooped from his\
  \ upper lip to his protruding clavicles.</p> \n   <p>He grunted at Jordyar, who\
  \ approached him carrying a poker, which he held out at arm's length with the aid\
  \ of his thick hide glove. The mustached man spoke arcane syllables, evoking a cone-shape\
  \ blast of flame, which flew from his fingertips to the poker. The poker's iron\
  \ tip glowed red.</p> \n   <p>\"Please,\" the prisoner sobbed. \"I'm begging you.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Jordyar hefted the red-hot poker. \"You're doing to this yourself,\
  \ Gaval.\"</p> \n   <p>Gaval shuddered. \"I can't tell you anything about it. Seriza\
  \ never mentioned such a thing! And Aruhal—I barely spoke a hundred words to him\
  \ my entire life. I'm just an apothecary.\"</p> \n   <p>Jordyar's partner—who had\
  \ to be the sorcerer, Naphrax—turned to the terrified young man in the chair. \"\
  Tell us,\" he said.</p> \n   <p>The dwarf advanced with the poker.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Tell us,\" repeated Naphrax.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Revelations and\
