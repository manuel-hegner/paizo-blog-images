  \ plan, but at least get out of fireball radius.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Seoni’\

  \ will show them who’s boss.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Rise of the Runelords Seoni\
  \ could enjoy the fun of spellcasting without worrying about recharge checks, and\
  \ also had a backup power for when she was caught without an Attack spell in hand.\
  \ This made her a great starting character, which is handy since I remember her\
  \ being very popular for new groups picking characters before understanding the\
  \ mechanics.</p> \n     <p>With everything important based on Charisma, you’d get\
  \ to enjoy the excellent d12 most turns, and picking skill feats was a breeze. Card\
  \ selection and card feats could require more thought, though. After blithely ignoring\
  \ weapons and armor, Seoni loaded up on 5 blessings, 4 allies, and 3 each of spells\
  \ and items. This let her explore very well, but meant that you might quickly run\
  \ into some difficult choices about what spells to keep around. If you didn’t take\
  \ many Attack spells, you’d likely soon find out that her character power was a\
  \ great backup option, but a little anemic for important combats.</p> \n     <div\

  \ with more Class (Deck).</p> \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Sorcerer Class Deck</i>\
  \ Seoni adds Knowledge to her skill list, playing up a bit more of the detail-oriented\
  \ and planner side of her background. She also swaps her Attack power from Fire\
  \ to Force. This makes her less good at killing some monsters like Trolls, but a\
  \ whole lot better at fighting a number of Fire-immune monsters like Devils. She\
  \ also trades out her automatic spell recharging power for a bonus to acquire Magic\
  \ boons. If you’re used to playing other casters already, or you play in a large\
  \ group, that’s probably a decent trade.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Wrath of the Righteous Seoni went off in a different direction\
  \ from the previous two versions. She only recharges Attack spells (and items),\
  \ and doesn’t have the power to do an Attack spell whenever she wants. In trade,\
  \ she has an extremely nifty power to draw Arcane or Magic cards directly from her\
  \ discard pile and occasionally draws extra cards on acquires. She’ll want to make\
  \ sure to stock up on some good Attack spells; thankfully, Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ has a whole bunch of awesome ones, and she has 2 more spells in her deck. She’\
  s also swapped Diplomacy for Perception and can add armor to her deck. Probably\
  \ a decent call for ventures into the Worldwound.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \   </div> \n     <p>Of all the <i>Core Set</i> characters, Seoni follows most in\
  \ the footprints of her previous incarnations. Her Runelords powers just make her\
  \ the perfect choice for introducing new players to spellcasting. That said, we\
  \ can’t help but switch things up. Her Attack power is more reliable, especially\
  \ at high level, and a single power feat makes it a lot cheaper to use. Another\
  \ power feat lets her shuffle spells into her deck on recovery: a nice option once\
  \ you know which cards you want to force higher in your deck.</p> \n     <p>Seoni\
  \ is a bit more diverse in her skills than Runelords, starting with Knowledge and\
  \ able to pick up Perception in a role. Her art has always had a staff and dagger,\
  \ so she’s the first Seoni to start with a weapon. Thankfully, both the Dagger (assist\
  \ a local combat) and Quarterstaff (evade an Obstacle or Trap) are pretty solid\
  \ for her in Core and she can always convert them into an Arcane Attack.</p> \n\

  \ tool in the Sorcerer’s box.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Spells are her bread and\
  \ butter, and she doesn’t need too many Attack spells because of her power. This\
  \ lets her take protective, utility, and assisting spells if she wants, or choose\
  \ a greater variety of Attack options. With a single power feat, she can also pick\
  \ up some solid Arcane items like the Wand of Enervation.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ “Immune to Attack.”</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Seoni can safely load up on the\
  \ highest level difficult-to-recharge spells she can get her hands onto. Giant Form\
  \ and Scrying are fun and effective options that Ezren and Kyra might have real\
  \ difficulty consistently recharging. They also convert well with Seoni’s Attack\
  \ power.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRBlessingofPharasma.jpg\"\

  \ prophecy, rebirth, fighting undead, and making Seoni awesome at casting spells.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>In character, Seoni has always been devoted to Pharasma,\
  \ even leading us to adjust the Pharasman blessings in Rise of the Runelords to\
  \ make them a better fit for Seoni. In Core, both Pharasma’s Knowing and Lady of\
  \ Mysteries lean into the undead-fighting aspect of the Lady of Graves while also\
  \ being useful for Seoni, allowing her to cycle her deck around to have the right\
  \ cards in hand before pressing onward.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ light.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Seoni’s Celestial Runecaster role builds on\
  \ the concept that she <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/BloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Celestial\"\
  >draws her sorcerer power from a celestial origin</a>. This role builds on her Attack\
  \ power, both in effectiveness and in adding the ability to deal Divine damage (useful\
  \ for bypassing resistance or immunity). She gains bonuses when blessed and at thematically\
  \ Sacred locations. She gains occasional (end of turn) flight, and resistance to\
  \ damage like a celestial creature. All solid, effective options.</p> \n     <p>Her\
  \ Dreamweaver role embraces her Varisian background and devotion to Pharasma to\
  \ learn to see and pull the strings of fate. She becomes somewhat of a <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh09?Varian-Jeggare-Deckmaster\">deckmaster</a>,\
  \ with powers to cycle her deck and ensure she can get her favorite cards back into\
  \ hand. She can gain the Perception skill and assist her party against barriers.\
  \ It benefits from a little more thought and planning, and occasionally your friends\
  \ will screw up your plans. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni\"\
  >And that’s sometimes what being Seoni is about</a>.</p> \n     <p>That’s our new\
  \ Seoni! She’s still a straight-forward badass d12 chucker of energy magic and Diplomatic\
  \ ways, but she’s got some new cool options to add complexity as she gains levels.</p>\
