  >“Whoa, you’re here already? Are you the Magaambya delegation or the group from\
  \ the Pathfinder Society? Either way, one moment.”</p> \n       <p>The white-scaled\
  \ kobold snatches a bandolier off a nearby hook and hurriedly fills its pouches\
  \ with a variety of rune-covered daggers from a nearby weapons rack. </p> \n   \
  \    <p>“This is the weapons vault, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. Normally I’d have\
  \ greeted you before you got this far, but Ziik’s having a little bit of a rat problem\
  \ and the boss says if the ratcatcher can’t deal with the rats himself, then he\
  \ should probably just let the rats eat him so she can find a better ratcatcher.”\
  </p> \n       <p>With the bandolier filled with weapons slung over her shoulder,\
  \ the little kobold quickly tucks a variety of other items into her kilt pockets\
  \ before thrusting one tiny hand into the air seeking a handshake.</p> \n      \
  \ <p>“Name’s Purepurin. I’m the steward of the vaults, and it’s my job to keep the\
  \ items clean, the inventory logs up to date, and the ratcatchers uneaten. Please\
  \ follow me for the time being and, uh, stay about ten feet back and try really\
  \ hard not to step in front of me if it looks like I’m pointing at something.”</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Instructions complete, Purepurin quickly leads the way through a twisting\
  \ series of tunnels. The farther the little kobold gets from the weapons vault,\
  \ the louder and angrier a constant, chittering squeal becomes, a rising crescendo\
  \ of rodent clicks and cries. Purepurin holds up a hand as she reaches a sharp corner,\
  \ the dancing light of distant torches indicating a much larger room just around\
  \ it.</p> \n       <p>“Ziik really is a good ratcatcher, you know.” Purepurin calmly\
  \ runs her fingers across the hilts of the daggers sheathed in her bandolier until\
  \ her grip settles on a ghastly blade, its hilt wrapped in what appears to be the\
  \ dead gray skin of some humanoid creature. She draws it carefully. “The problem\
  \ is that sometimes one of the really smart rats nibbles through the protective\
  \ fulus and gets ahold of an item in the special vaults that turns it into something\
  \ that’s just a little bit too much for your average kobold. Case in point…”</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Purepurin’s gesture to peek around the corner leads to a truly horrific\
  \ sight: hundreds of black-furred, white-tailed, red-eyed rats swarm around a large\
  \ stone well with a wooden steeple. Perched atop the steeple is a lone elderly kobold,\
  \ desperately fending off the occasional encroaching rodent with a gnarled walking\
  \ stick. Seething through the furry hordes, a slick wet mass displaces rats like\
  \ a leviathan shedding water as a rodent of unprecedented size emerges. Still-smoking\
  \ scars and other remnants of recent battles indicate that the monstrous creature\
  \ has mounted several unsuccessful attempts to devour the stranded ratcatcher, whose\
  \ panicked expression seems to indicate that he has no more tricks sufficient to\
  \ stall the beast.</p> \n       <p>With a quick wink, Purepurin hurls her dagger\
  \ into the middle of the roiling mass of rats, skewering one with a single flick\
  \ of her wrist. The other rats around the skewered target begin to squeal and scatter\
  \ as a foul stench emanates from the slain rodent. As the smaller rats choke and\
  \ disperse, Purepurin calmly walks into the relatively clear space, drawing an item\
  \ from her pocket. The oversized rat turns toward the new challenger, placing its\
  \ back to the old kobold and the well upon which he perches. With a wicked grin,\
  \ Purepurin levels what looks to be an elaborate seashell at the rat.</p> \n   \
  \    <p>“Bang.”</p> \n       <p>A geyser of twisting water suddenly erupts from\
  \ the “seashell,” slamming into the rat monster with enough force to send the creature\
  \ up and over the edge of the well and down into its murky depths. Wasting no time,\
  \ Purepurin gestures furiously for assistance, chasing rats away from a heavy, steel-shod\
  \ wooden cover clearly intended for the well. With some assistance from Ziik and\
  \ the visitors, Purepurin seals the well, the rat monster apparently unable to climb\
  \ up quickly enough to secure its escape. The old ratcatcher, Ziik, grumbles about\
  \ needing to march all the way to vault 47 for clean water. As he places protective\
  \ paper talismans around the edge of the well, Purepurin recovers her thrown dagger\
  \ and smiles widely.</p> \n       <p>“Too much for the <em>average</em> kobold,\
  \ but not for yours truly!” Purepurin calmly waves a beckoning claw as she exits\
  \ the room through a different doorway than the one she used to enter. “If you think\
  \ that was scary, wait’ll you meet the boss!”</p> \n      </blockquote> \n     \
  \ <br> \n      <h3>Thrower’s Bandolier — Item 3</h3> \n      <p><b>Conjuration,\
  \ Invested, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 60 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> worn; <b>Bulk</b>\
  \ L</p> \n      <p>This bandolier is covered in straps and pouches capable of holding\
  \ up to 2 Bulk of one-handed thrown weapons. A <em>thrower's bandolier</em> has\
  \ a <em>+1 weapon potency rune</em> etched into it, and it can be etched with runes\
  \ as though it were a one-handed thrown weapon. When you invest the <em>thrower’\
  s bandolier</em>, you can attune it to all the weapons sheathed in it (this ends\
  \ any previous attunements made with the bandolier). Whenever you draw a weapon\
  \ from the bandolier, the bandolier's runes are replicated onto that weapon. Any\
  \ runes already on the weapon are suppressed, and any runes previously replicated\
  \ to a different weapon in this way are removed, returning it to normal.</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] envision, Interact; <b>Effect</b> All weapons\
  \ attuned to the bandolier, not including any weapons you're currently wielding,\
  \ return to the bandolier.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Ghast Stiletto — Item 3</h3>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Magical, Necromancy</b><br> <b>Price</b> 60 gp <br> <b>Usage</b>\
  \ held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n      <p>A ghast stiletto is a <em>+1 dagger</em>\
  \ wrapped in the still-undead skin of a ghast. While you wield the dagger, you gain\
  \ a +1 status bonus to all saves against paralysis.</p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b>\
  \ [one-action] command, Interact (divine, necromancy, olfactory); <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ once per hour; <b>Effect</b> The <em>ghast stiletto</em> afflicts the next living\
  \ target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of\
  \ the grave. For the next minute, the target creature, as well as any creatures\
  \ within a 10-foot emanation, must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened\
  \ 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within\
  \ the emanation, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease\
  \ and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save\
  \ is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p> \n      <p><b>Craft Requirements</b> The\
  \ initial raw materials must include skin from a ghast.</p> \n      <br> \n    \
  \  <h3>Torrent Spellgun (Lesser) — Item 3</h3> \n      <p><b>Attack, Consumable,\
  \ Evocation, Magical, Spellgun, Water</b><br> <b>Price</b> 12 gp<br> <b>Usage</b>\
  \ held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activate</b> [two-actions] Interact, Strike</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Carved of seashell, a <em>torrent spellgun</em> is damp to the touch,\
  \ and seaweed wraps around its grip. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one\
  \ creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll\
  \ against the target’s AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun\
  \ blasts a powerful jet of water that deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, then disintegrates\
  \ into sand.</p> \n      <p><b>Critical Success</b> The target takes double damage\
  \ and is knocked back 10 feet.</p> \n      <p><b>Success</b> The target takes full\
  \ damage and is knocked back 5 feet.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
