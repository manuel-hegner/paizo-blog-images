  artist: "popular request... Pathfinder desktop backgrounds! While a desktop is obviously\
    \ a totally different size than a book, and certain design elements are still\
    \ being finalized, these three images are perhaps the best preview to date of\
    \ what the first three Pathfinder covers (including the alternate cover for volume\
    \ 1) will actually look like. So while you're waiting for \"Burnt Offerings\"\
    \ to release, why not download one of these and throw it up as your wallpaper?\
    \ After all, as far as we're concerned, everyone could use a little more Wayne\
    \ Reynolds art in their lives... Desktop #1: 1024x768, 1280x960 Desktop #2: 1024x768,\
    \ 1280x960 Desktop #3: 1024x768, 1280x960 James Sutter Assistant Editor, Pathfinder"
