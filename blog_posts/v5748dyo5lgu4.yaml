  description\">Once upon a time, there was a girl who had to write a blog. And she\
  \ really didn't want to because she was sick and could only see out of one eye and\
  \ because it was Thanksgiving morning. She turned on the parade (because that would\
  \ help productivity, obvs) and things didn't get any better. Apparently \"parade\"\
  \ now means listening to the hosts attempt to make witty banter in between random\
  \ performances of Broadway songs. She had signed up for giant balloons and marching\
  \ bands, not this random showcase of songs from Broadway shows that paid money to\
  \ be featured. She had reached the point where she was a) angry at a parade and\
  \ b) had not actually written more of her blog because she was TOO BUSY BEING ANGRY\
  \ AT A PARADE. Great Googly Moogly! Just as she realized that the marching bands\
  \ and balloons probably hadn't reached the witty banter station and the performances\
  \ were just filler until then, the marching bands and balloons showed up. And she\
  \ lived happily ever after and kindly elves wrote her blog for her.</p> \n     <p>By\
  \ now you've probably figured out that I am the girl in that (mostly true) story.\
  \ And you're thinking, \"Surely you weren't sick on Thanksgiving or dividing your\
  \ attention between work and fun?! And surely-er, you wouldn't be the sort of person\
  \ who gets mad at parades?\" Sadly for me, the part about being sick and the part\
  \ about being a person who gets mad at parades is true and the part about kindly\
  \ elves finishing my writing is a complete fabrication.</p> \n     <p>Even with\
  \ many of these things being true (I mean, seriously, what kind of person yells\
  \ at their TV because the parade is wrong?!), it is still the holiday season and\
  \ there are still many things to be thankful for. I'm going to focus on things related\
  \ to the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Adventure Card Game</a> because\
  \ that's what we're here to talk about. I am extremely thankful that you are taking\
  \ some of your time to read this blog (even if you're only reading it to procrastinate\
  \ doing work). And I'm thankful that you love this game that we all work so hard\
  \ on (and I'm thankful I get to work on it!). I'm also thankful that it is my eye\
  \ that is not working properly and not my fingers because that would make typing\
  \ real tough. Enough with the warm fuzzies. Let's jump into the awesome stuff to\
  \ look forward to.</p> \n     <h2>Obligatory Shark Section</h2> \n     <p>Hold on\
  \ to your peg legs, kids—<a href=\"/products/btpy96yw\"><em>The Island of Empty\
  \ Eyes</em></a> has the biggest, baddest shark we've ever had!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>She's got more teeth than you've got... well, anything.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This shark is not going to put up with any of your nonsense.\
  \ None of it. And if you bring any nonsense, she's going to eat you and your ship.\
  \ Speaking of eating...</p> \n     <h2>Other Awesome Stuff Section</h2> \n     <p>These\
  \ are things to be thankful for. Even if some of them hurt you. And all of them\
  \ are delicious. Or they find you delicious. Small details.</p> \n     <p>You guys\
  \ ever listen to the Beach Boys? They actually put out a fantasy-themed album. It\
  \ featured a track called \"Koko, NO!\" Seriously. They did.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>(sing) Off the Fever Seeeeeeeeas, there's a tree called Koko,\
  \ no! For the love of Besmara, stop pelting me with coconuts!!!</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>So, I love Koko. Koko lobs first, and asks questions later. And if you\
  \ let her ask questions later, she'll just throw some more coconuts at you. It's\
  \ not the best for people who intrude on Koko and her domain. If you've managed\
  \ to keep your wits about you and have the wherewithal to use Fire against Koko,\
  \ that'll help. But you better knock her out or it's more coconuts to the noggin'\
  \ for you! When life, or Koko, gives you coconuts, there's only one thing to do.\
  \ <i>You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up...</i></p> \n     <p>I\
  \ don't know if you like dinosaurs as much as I do but if you're cool you probably\
  \ like dinosaurs at least a little bit. So check this out—an entire location ALL\
  \ ABOUT DINOSAURS! And a dinosaur Henchman!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Dinosaur Corral. Yee-haw!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>I hope you loaded up on Animal\
  \ allies. And hopefully, you haven't been burying very many cards. If you don't\
  \ have Animal allies to help you out and you've been burying cards left and right,\
  \ who cares? Sweet dinosaur cards will make up for that! Unless you get eaten because\
  \ that jolly little orange dinosaur finds you delectable. It's pretty hard to come\
  \ back from being devoured. Your fault for being tasty!</p> \n     <p>There are\
  \ also some good things in this set. I mean, I gotta give you some reasons to be\
  \ thankful for the game. Check out this Saltbox.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>A salty gun for a salty sea dog.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>As\
  \ you can imagine, this gun is similar to the Pepperbox (which is totally awesome,\
  \ right?) except it's even better against monsters with the Aquatic trait. Because,\
  \ just like a Pepperbox shoots pepper and makes things... um... sneeze, a Saltbox\
  \ shoots salt and gets water things all shrivelly. Nevermind that they live in saltwater.\
  \ That's none of your business.</p> \n     <p>Did I mention sweet dinosaur cards?\
  \ This one is even friendly!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6014-Pteranodon.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>This is my Pteranodon and I shall call him Pterrence.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>So, this flappy fellow will pick you up and drop you off\
  \ somewhere else and let you explore. Plus, there's a d6 in it for you if you have\
  \ to fight something. I'm pretty sure Pterrence's strategy is to make a loud, squawky\
  \ sort of sound to distract your opponent. He doesn't really look like a biter.\
  \ <i>[Ed: I don't see any teeth in there. He must be a gulper.]</i> Anyway, he's\
  \ adorable and he helps you win. AND HE'S A DINOSAUR! Be careful though, he'll probably\
  \ try to eat the pturkey at your Pthanksigiving dinner. His ptable manners leave\
  \ something to be desired.</p> \n     <p>There's something else that fits in the\
  \ category of awesome stuff, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. I don't use\
  \ this word lightly (or ever, except for right now) but seriously, it's amazeballs.\
  \ If things go well, it'll be the first thing you see when you open your boxes.\
  \ I so wish I could see people's faces when that happens.</p> \n     <h2>Scenario\
  \ Preview AKA The Important Stuff</h2> \n     <p>H'okay. So here we are in the part\
  \ of the blog that is supposed to give you useful information and not just the ramblings\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>These cards really make me want mustard.</i>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>By now you've realized that I'm going to walk you through The Feast of\
  \ Spoils, which really is a feast of spoils. So many plunders! And some pretty ridiculous\
  \ loot to boot. And all this food stuff is making me really hungry for our Thanksgiving\
  \ feast. Probably I'm going to stop writing until after I eat. Food-coma writing\
  \ is a little easier to understand than hunger-pang writing.</p> \n     <p><i>Some\
  \ time later...</i></p> \n     <p>If you haven't noticed already, the blessings\
  \ deck is a little wacky for this adventure. I am a big fan of messing with the\
  \ blessings deck so I'm particularly excited for this. The Shipwrecks also happen\
  \ to mostly be good things. You still get your turn (and who cares about any bad\
  \ lycanthropes you might encounter on that turn—there's no blessing on top of the\
  \ blessings discard pile to pump them up) and you get a chance to add some plunder\
  \ to your ship. In a six-player game, that's eight chances! You might not hit them\
  \ all if you burn through the game really fast, but you've got a good chance to\
  \ add a fair amount of goodies for your party at the end of the scenario. Of course,\
  \ if you don't succeed, you'll have to encounter The Pirate Council. You remember\
  \ them, right?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-PirateCouncil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-PirateCouncil_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>The Pirate Council, or as I like to call them, the plunder\
  \ plunderers.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Yeah, it's these guys again. Hopefully\
  \ you don't fail at repairing a ship, and if you fail at that hopefully you don't\
  \ fail at being charismatic or diplomatic. Just, don't fail. It's really that simple.\
  \ So, that's just the nonsense with the blessings deck. Let's take a peek at what's\
  \ actually happening in the rest of the locations.</p> \n     <p>The locations aren't\
  \ anything to be too preoccupied with, but they will contain a Ruffian henchman\
  \ or The Eel.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Ruffian.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>These guys are why we can't have nice things.</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Eventually you'll get a few of the Ruffians out of the way and be able\
  \ to finish off The Eel when you meet him. He clearly took lessons from Koko on\
  \ how to lob stuff at you and your ship. Except he's not throwing coconuts. He's\
  \ tossing bombs around like there's no tomorrow. If you aren't careful all that\
  \ hard-earned plunder will just float away. So, be careful... which is like telling\
  \ a triceratops not to rampage. Not as easy as it looks.</p> \n     <p>Anyway, here's\
  \ hoping that was a fun preview of <a href=\"/products/btpy96yw\"><em>The Island\
  \ of Empty Eyes</em></a> and I'm crossing my fingers that your brain won't melt\
  \ when you open it and see our special surprise for all of you. Oh, at the end of\
  \ this scenario you'll get a class 4 ship feat, so I might as well show you one\
  \ of the cool new ships.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6014-BloodMoon1.jpg\"\

  \ No, happy elves did not get me to finish this during the parade. I decided writing\

  \ way to sign off...I'm just going to leave this here.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
