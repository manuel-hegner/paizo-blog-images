  \ Space</em></a> releases this month, and to show off some of the new character\
  \ options available in the book, we present Sheevak Smoke-Eater, an NPC antagonist\
  \ and rival that you can use in your Starfinder campaigns. Among his many abilities,\
  \ Sheevak utilizes an alternate vesk racial trait and the battle leader archetype,\
  \ in addition to a new weapon in the form of the doshakari, all from <em>Near Space</em>.\
  \ While NPCs don’t normally use themes, we’ve given Sheevak the stormrunner theme\
  \ to give you a sneak peek at one of the new themes from the book as well. In addition,\
  \ we offer a brief look at Sheevak’s current base of operations, the gas giant Ulthel,\
  \ which is fully detailed in <em>Near Space</em>.</p> \n      <p>Content from other\
  \ Starfinder products is marked with the following abbreviations: NS (<em>Starfinder\
  \ Near Space</em>) and PW (<em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em>). These books are available\

  \      <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> \n      <hr> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\
  > \n       <li><b>Brawny</b> Sheevak takes pride in being as physically fit as possible.\
  \ He gains a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks. This alternate\
  \ racial trait replaces fearless.</li> \n       <li><b>Eye of the Storm</b> When\
  \ in stormy conditions, Sheevak is able to gather greater information about his\
  \ surroundings. His visibility range in a storm is reduced by only half, and he\
  \ takes a –4 penalty to Perception checks instead of –8. When he succeeds at a Survival\
  \ check to endure severe weather, he can move his full overland speed and still\
  \ receive the +2 bonus to Fortitude saves against severe weather. He suffers the\
  \ forced movement and takes damage from a failed Acrobatics check to fly in dangerous\
  \ wind conditions only if he fails the check by 10 or more, instead of by 5 or more.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Stormrunner Theme</b> Sheevak is trained to navigate the tumultuous\
  \ atmospheres of gas giants with grace, learning weather patterns and recognizing\
  \ the order in the apparent randomness of storms. Stormrunners gain an ability adjustment\
  \ of +1 to Dexterity at character creation.</li> \n       <li><b>Stormrunner Theme\
  \ Knowledge</b> The life of a stormrunner is about beating the odds in high-risk\
  \ situations. Reduce the DC of Survival checks to endure severe weather, orienteer,\
  \ and predict weather when in rainy, snowy, or windy conditions by 5.</li> \n  \
  \     <li><b>Tactical Doshakari</b> This punch dagger resembles a miniature doshko\
  \ extending from the knuckles, with one to four diamond‑shaped blades.</li> \n \
  \      <li><b>Victory Cry (Ex)</b> Followers of a tradition that originated in the\
  \ Veskarium among devout followers of Damoritosh, battle leaders are known for celebrating\
  \ victories as they happen. Sheevak knows how to capitalize on his allies’ successes\
  \ in battle, inspiring them to further incredible feats. As a reaction when Sheevak\
  \ or an ally scores a critical hit against a significant enemy with an attack or\
  \ drops a significant enemy to 0 Hit Points, he can issue a victory cry, choosing\
  \ one of the following and providing its benefits to all allies within 60 feet (but\
  \ not Sheevak himself):</li> \n       <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n  \
  \      <li><em>Got ’Em!</em>: Affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to damage rolls\
  \ until the end of their next turn.</li> \n        <li><em>Regroup</em>: The triggering\
  \ ally regains 10 Stamina Points.</li> \n        <li>These alternate class features\
  \ replace the operative exploit class features normally gained at 2nd and 4th level.</li>\
  \ \n       </ul> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Sheevak Smoke-Eater is a veteran stormrunner,\
  \ leading a team salvaging minerals and other valuable resources from the atmospheres\
  \ of gas giants. He’s currently working for Project Omega, a top secret research\
  \ facility in orbit around the Near Space gas giant Ulthel. Sheevak’s mission is\
  \ to take samples from ulthelim, the planet’s native species, for study by Project\
  \ Omega’s scientists. Project leader Dr. Holton-8 pays well, and ethical characters\
  \ who seek to shut down Sheevak and his employers are in for a fight. </p> \n  \
  \    <p>For members of Sheevak’s stormrunning team, you can use the stats for the\
  \ mercenary rookie on page 174 of <em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em>, but replace their\
  \ Stealth skill with Acrobatics +13 and add the Eye of the Storm and Stormrunner\
  \ Theme Knowledge special abilities from Sheevak’s stat block above.</p> \n    \
  \  <h3>ULTHEL</h3> \n      <p>Ulthel is a gas giant in Near Space with a toxic atmosphere,\
  \ home to a species of jellyfish-like creatures known as ulthelim. Early visitors\
  \ to Ulthel reported hearing mental pleas from the ulthelim, which begged the visitors\
  \ in a single cacophonous voice to partake of the planet’s wisdom, to merge with\
  \ the clouds of ulthelim, and to become one with the planet as a single entity.\
  \ These were always the last reports visitors logged before they themselves disappeared\
  \ without a trace. To some, visiting the planet is a surefire death sentence. But\
  \ to others, the transformative nature of the ulthelim represents a blueprint of\
  \ utopia. To still others, the gas giant holds a potential gold mine of riches and\
  \ scientific secrets that’s worth braving any risk.</p> \n      <p>For more character\
  \ options and more details about Ulthel and dozens of other Near Space Worlds, check\
