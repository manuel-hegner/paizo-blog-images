  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Wow. What a week! In a\
  \ typical year, this week would’ve been a trip to Reno for GAMA trade show. My days\
  \ at GAMA mean lots of meetings with industry folk, talking to retailers, and generally\
  \ spreading the word about Paizo’s organized play programs. But this year is anything\
  \ but typical. I’m not one to get flustered about epidemics – lived in England during\
  \ Mad Cow and in South Korea during the last SARS outbreak – but even I’m finding\
  \ the information overload surrounding Covid-19 overwhelming. This morning, half\
  \ my emails were from companies talking about the steps they are taking to contain\
  \ and protect from the virus. I’m glad everyone’s taking steps to minimize the footprint\
  \ and restrain the outbreak.</p> \n      <p>Which brings me to what organized play\
  \ is doing. Staff are practicing hygiene and social distancing techniques. We suspended\
  \ travel to events through the end of May, which caused us to withdraw from a number\
  \ of conventions. Paizo leadership is looking at PaizoCon and evaluating options.\
  \ Many of the conventions we withdrew from have now cancelled or postponed their\
  \ events and others are following suite. The Washington state government banned\
  \ gatherings over 250 people. This is the first governmental restriction in the\
  \ US, but I don’t expect it to be the last. Europeans in many countries have limited\
  \ travel and some are in lockdown status. I expect directives from other nations\
  \ as well as we all step in to combat the spread of the virus.</p> \n      <p>What\
  \ does this mean for our players and the communities that support the events? Fortunately\
  \ for us, several years ago we established an online region under the direction\
  \ of regional venture-coordinator Jesse Davis. We are working closely with Jesse\
  \ and the online team to look at moving physical games to online space. We ask that\
  \ any GM willing to run online games let their local coordinators know. We are still\
  \ processing event support for those events that have not cancelled. We ask organizers\
  \ to drop us a line to update their event status at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n      <p>These are trying times and we appreciate\
  \ our communities stepping up and doing their part to limit the spread of the virus.\
  \ We thank you for your assistance and will let you know more when we have the information.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n      <p style=\"\
