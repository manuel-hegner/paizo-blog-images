  description\">Shelyn smiles upon us! After a rigorous closed alpha test, open beta\
  \ is now live for Demiplane’s Pathfinder NEXUS Character Tools. The Character Builder\
  \ and Character Sheet are purpose-built tools tailored to help you weave thrilling\
  \ adventures as a GM, experiment with unusual character builds, and share the fun\
  \ of tabletop RPGs with friends new to the game.</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder NEXUS\
  \ Character Tools are designed to facilitate and accelerate the process of character\
  \ creation. Even for veteran players who've created countless characters, this tool\
  \ adds speed and convenience. It’s perfect for those moments when inspiration strikes,\
  \ allowing you to rapidly bring your ideas to life or even when you’re simply eager\
  \ to explore new character builds. Mobile optimization means you can do all this\
  \ while waiting in line for a hot brown morning potion (any <em>The Dragon Prince</em>\
  \ fans here?)</p> \n     <br> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1cd4e359-60d7-4cdc-9dc6-e6be57d96c2b/CharacterBuilder_GrippliDesktop_1200x675.png\"\

  \ Sheet, meanwhile, automates calculations and modifiers for your character's attributes\
  \ and abilities. It lets you focus more on the narrative and your character's actions,\
  \ as you no longer need to spend game time on mundane calculations or hunting down\
  \ misplaced modifiers. One-click access to rules related to everything on your sheet\
  \ streamlines gameplay, eliminating time-consuming rulebook searches. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>These tools offer significant advantages to seasoned players, especially\
  \ those taking on the role of Game Master. When introducing Pathfinder 2nd Edition\
  \ to new players or guiding fresh adventurers through Pathfinder Society events,\
  \ these digital assets can prove invaluable. The Online Character Builder demystifies\
  \ the initial steps of character creation for beginners, making the game more approachable\
  \ and allowing them to start their first adventure with confidence. As a GM, this\
  \ reduces the instructional burden on you, enabling you to focus more on the rich\
  \ narrative and engaging encounters that make Pathfinder so much fun.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Things you’ll discover in the initial open beta version of the tools:</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>An interface optimized for mobile, desktop, and tablet.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Online access available wherever you have data–no download or install\
  \ required.</li> \n      <li>Guided Character Builder that simplifies information\
  \ when you want to go fast <em>and</em> lets you deep-dive into the details when\
  \ you want to explore. You're in control.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <br> \n     <div\

  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <ul> \n \
  \     <li>Inclusion of every ancestry, heritage, background, class, feat, spell,\
  \ and item in official published Pathfinder 2nd Edition rulebooks, sourcebooks,\
  \ standalone adventures, and adventure paths.</li> \n      <li>7 free character\
  \ slots.</li> \n      <li>A <strong><em>Click-To-Know</em></strong> system that\
  \ makes nearly every element on the character sheet interactive. Think “crit success\
  \ on Recall Knowledge” any time you need to remember a rule while you’re playing.\
  \ Full rules (plus tooltips, cross-references, and more) for every skill, action,\
  \ feat, and attribute are just one click away.</li> \n      <li>Shareable character\
  \ sheets. This empowers you to help build a first-time character for a new player\
  \ and also to have access to all the obscure feats, spells, and items your players\
  \ bring to your table.</li> \n      <li>Calculations and automations. The more we\
  \ can help put math in the background, the more you can focus on your character\
  \ and the group story. If it’s a permanent value (how your Dexterity mod, armor\
  \ proficiency, equipment, and level affect AC, for example), expect the Character\
  \ Sheet to do the math for you. For situational, variable, or temporary values (Barbarian\
  \ rage, conditions, etc.) you'll see tools to help you track them, with automated\
  \ calculations arriving as open beta progresses.</li> \n      <li>Dice roller. Whether\
  \ you’re playing online or forgot your clacky math rocks, it’s a straightforward\
  \ way to roll.</li> \n      <li>Did drinking from that enchanted pool give you +5\
  \ speed until sunrise? You can make that modification and jot down a note on where\
  \ it came from.</li> \n      <li>A place for your Pathfinder Society Organized Play\
  \ ID #, naturally.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <br> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ it will be available free in Character Tools. For other character options, when\
  \ you have access to the book on Pathfinder NEXUS that a given ancestry, background,\
  \ class, feat, spell, etc. is from, it will be available to you in Character Tools.\
  \ \"Access\" includes when you own a Pathfinder NEXUS book yourself or someone has\
  \ shared it with you using the content-sharing benefit that's part of their Demiplane\
  \ Membership. This approach makes sure our devs and designers get fair compensation\
  \ for their work, and because we're an official licensee, a portion goes back to\
  \ support the Paizo team as well.</p> \n     <p>While we're excited to share Pathfinder\
  \ NEXUS Character Tools with you, this <em>is</em> an open beta, so we continue\
  \ to push hard in two important areas. First, we’re rapidly adding new features\
  \ and functions from our backlog. Second, we're now gathering feedback from an even\
  \ larger group of passionate players. We want to ensure that these tools continuously\
  \ improve and deliver on their mission: to make every game of Pathfinder you play\
  \ even more fun and satisfying.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags: \
