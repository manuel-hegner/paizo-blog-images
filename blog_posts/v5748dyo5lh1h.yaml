  ><em>Price of Infamy Adventure Deck</em></a> is treating you well? And by \"treating\
  \ you well,\" I of course mean thoroughly beating you up before you battle back\
  \ and achieve exciting victory.</p> \n    <p>We're most of the way through our inaugural\
  \ <a href=\"pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a> season, and the response has been\
  \ pretty positive. We've got a few changes and clarifications to make, and then\
  \ at the end you get pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your\
  \ meat?</p> \n    <h2>Your Meat</h2> \n    <p>In the original, bleeding-edge store\
  \ release of the season so far, players don't receive their role cards until the\
  \ end of Adventure 4. There was a reason for this, but for a few different reasons,\
  \ (cue millions of voices suddenly crying out in terror before suddenly being silenced),\
  \ we're changing this. Effective today, the rewards for Adventure 4 and Adventure\
  \ 3 are swapped, meaning that you get your role card (and your new power feat that\
  \ you can use on your role card) at the end of Adventure 3, and access to the Letter\
  \ of Marque and Pirate's Favor (as well as another feat) at the end of Adventure\
  \ 4. Blame the Empire.</p> \n    <p>We've also made some small tweaks to a few scenario\
  \ powers and rewards, as well as some templating changes. To wit:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Scenario 02-C Revenge of the Fishfolk</em>: Krelloort can no longer\
  \ attempt to hide forever behind the comforting bulk of Hirgenzosk, as Pinnacle\
  \ Atoll has been replaced by Raker Shoals. We've also clarified that everyone's\
  \ boon type choices are shuffled together to form the treasure stack.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><em>Scenario 04-A A Tale of Two Alchemists</em>: This scenario originally\
  \ gave out a loot card that allowed you to remove it from the game to gain a skill\
  \ feat. The idea behind giving that out as opposed to a skill feat is that in a\
  \ particular tight spot, you might choose a non-primary skill to improve. Maybe\
  \ Flenta reeeeeally wants to impress that Rogue Ape, so she gives up her loot for\
  \ a much-needed Charisma bump. Player feedback let us know that this overhead was\
  \ more trouble than it was worth and was also subject to serious abuse, so we've\
  \ simplified the reward. Now, once during an encounter, you can choose a skill feat.\
  \ Same idea, but simpler, with less overhead.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ I want to talk a bit about the Adventure Path reward and how it will work. After\
  \ you complete all six adventures, you'll unlock the loot item Councilor's Ring.\
  \ (No, you may not have a sneak peek at it. Where's the fun in that?) Anyway, you\
  \ will be able to assign that item to a new character in the upcoming Season 1,\
  \ Season of the Righteous. That character will be able to use it as if it came in\
  \ her Class Deck box. We're not sending all zillion ACG players a copy of the card—\
  sorry—but we will make sure that the PDF of the card is sized for easy printing\
  \ and sleeving.</p> \n    <p>I think of this style of boon as a legacy item. Editor\
  \ Brian Campbell likes to talk about the heirloom ring that his character's ancestor\
  \ passed down to his current character. Characters that unlock the ring might also\
  \ find other ways to use it in the future, but we'll save that for another day.</p>\
