  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">We're hard at work training for the\
  \ release of Pathfinder Second Edition, a task that requires precision of mind,\
  \ feats of endurance, and the patience of a coiled viper. The task would be next\
  \ to impossible if we didn't have such an inspiring example in Sajan, the iconic\
  \ monk, who strives every day to perfect himself and those around him. Enjoy the\
  \ following piece of short fiction from James L. Sutter in the next entry into our\
  \ series of Iconic Encounters—brief vignettes of the iconic characters showcasing\
  \ the myriad stories you can tell with Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n     <div\

  \     <blockquote> \n      <p>Claws large enough to take Sajan's head clean off\
  \ whispered past his shoulder, sliding through the air where he'd been a heartbeat\
  \ earlier. The troll caught himself, following up with a kidney strike that could\
  \ have eviscerated a horse, but too slowly. Sajan stepped inside the troll's guard,\
  \ the combination flowing smoothly. Gut, gut, face, throat—his arms pistoned as\
  \ he struck, the sound of each fist's impact blending with the others like raindrops\
  \ in a storm.</p> \n      <p>The troll staggered backward, pushing Sajan away with\
  \ a clumsy front kick, abandoning any attempt at grappling in order to put some\
  \ space between them.</p> \n      <p>It was the wrong move. Sajan took two steps\
  \ forward and launched himself into the air, rolling to his left. His chambered\
  \ right leg shot out, heel catching the troll in the cheek with all the force of\
  \ his momentum. Bone shattered.</p> \n      <p>Both Sajan and the troll dropped\
  \ to the ground, but only Sajan landed on his feet. The troll lay on the paving\
  \ stones, chest heaving as he blinked uncomprehendingly up at the hawks riding thermals\
  \ high above.</p> \n      <p>Sajan leaned down and extended a hand.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>\"Again?\"</p> \n      <p>\"With you?\" The troll accepted Sajan's hand, threating\
  \ to pull the monk off his feet as he lurched upright. He reached up and shoved\
  \ his broken jaw back into place with a crunch. \"If I enjoyed hurting myself, I\
  \ would have stayed in Kaer Maga and become an Augur.\"</p> \n      <p>Sajan grinned\
  \ and slapped the troll's enormous shoulder. \"Quit whining—some of us actually\
  \ have to live with our injuries. In ten minutes you won't even remember that I\
  \ hit you.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Not true.\" The troll led him across the practice\
  \ yard to the water barrel. Ignoring the dipper, the giant lifted the entire thing\
  \ and took a long drink before setting it down again. \"I won't be forgetting that\
  \ anytime soon.\" He shook his head. \"Tusks, Sajan—if that's how you fight when\
  \ it's all in good fun, I'd hate to see you angry.\"</p> \n      <p>Sajan lifted\
  \ the ladle, dribbling water over his shaved head. \"That's my secret, Jora: I never\
  \ fight angry. Anger clouds the mind, makes you stupid. Slow.\"</p> \n      <p>Jora\
  \ raised one bushy caterpillar of an eyebrow. \"Never?\"</p> \n      <p>Memories\
  \ rose unbidden: A battle. A lord. A hard woman with his own face.</p> \n      <p>Sajan\
  \ frowned. \"I—\"</p> \n      <p>A gong rang. Both Jora and Sajan spun, snapping\
  \ to attention. Across the yard, the temple's huge bronze doors swung open, unleashing\
  \ an orderly procession of monks. And behind them...</p> \n      <p>Sajan bowed\
  \ low, Jora only a heartbeat behind. \"Master! You honor us.\"</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ old woman approached. She was tiny, her silver hair bright against the deep blue\
  \ of her sari, yet her ancient feet made no sound as they crossed the weathered\
  \ stones. Her callused palm touched the back of Sajan's head, as gentle as a sparrow\
  \ alighting.</p> \n      <p>\"Sajan.\" Her voice was high and strong, forged on\
  \ countless battlefields. \"You've trained well in your time with us, yet the time\
  \ for study is past. I have seen the path that Irori has set for you, and it is\
  \ long—long before you came to us, and longer still once you leave. Yet before you\
  \ go, if you would be a full son of the Hidden Peaks School, you must pass one final\
  \ challenge.\"</p> \n      <p>Sajan closed his eyes.</p> \n      <p>\"Tell me what\
  \ I must do.\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>If you liked this week's Iconic\
  \ Encounter, be sure to check back next Thursday for another exciting entry in the\
  \ series. Until then, Pathfinders, keep your ki focused and your minds open.</p>\
