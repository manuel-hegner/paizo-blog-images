  \ Rulebook</em>: we’re talking, of course, about the witchwarper!</p>\n      <br>\n\

  \      <p>Witchwarpers are reality-bending spellcasters whose lives are defined\
  \ by a paradoxical event that forever warped their existence. Origins in an alternate\
  \ reality? A trip along a parallel timeline? A quantum experiment gone awry, or\
  \ a malfunctioning alien device? The Gap itself? Whatever the cause, each witchwarper’\
  s exposure to paradoxical reality has given them tremendous magic abilities.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Beyond affecting reality with mere spellcasting, witchwarpers can create\
  \ a reality-warping <strong>quantum field</strong>. In another reality (which is\
  \ to say, in Starfinder First Edition, insert wink emoji here), witchwarpers had\
  \ to expend spell slots to use their reality-altering infinite worlds ability. Witchwarpers\
  \ had to choose between altering reality through spells, or through infinite worlds.\
  \ Later, in Starfinder Enhanced, the enhanced witchwarper gained additional spell\
  \ slots to use for infinite worlds.</p>\n      <p>While a witchwarper’s spellcasting\
  \ and quantum field are still mechanically intertwined, we’ve taken a new approach.\
  \ In Starfinder Second Edition, witchwarpers can use the <strong>Warp Reality </strong>action\
  \ as often as they want. This brings their quantum field into existence, and the\
  \ effects of this quantum field depend on the <strong>paradox </strong>that defines\
  \ the witchwarper’s magic power. Witchwarpers gain additional abilities through\
  \ their paradox (and feat selections) that allow them to manipulate or interact\
  \ with their quantum field, whether by moving it, applying additional <strong>zone</strong>\
  \ effects to it, or targeting creatures inside it with reality-altering powers.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Of course, warping reality requires focus. While witchwarpers can create\
  \ their quantum field as often as they like, they must Sustain it if they want it\
  \ to stick around. Thankfully, witchwarpers have a new option at their disposal:\
  \ abilities with the <strong>anchoring</strong> trait, such as a witchwarper’s focus\
  \ spells, signature spells, and certain feats, automatically sustain the quantum\
  \ field in addition to any other effects they may have.</p>\n      <p>If you think\
  \ you’ve heard the concept of an “anchor” somewhere in Starfinder before—you’d be\
  \ correct! An anchor was an important part of the time-bending precog class from\
  \ Starfinder First Edition. Precog is part of the witchwarper class now—in fact,\
  \ precog is one of the paradoxes you can choose for your witchwarper character!\
  \ <strong>Anchors</strong> aren’t just for precogs anymore: every witchwarper has\
  \ an anchor, which is a memory, concept, or object that keeps them grounded in true\
  \ reality. A witchwarper can sustain their quantum field through a special “anchoring\
  \ action” granted by their anchor, granting them greater flexibility from round\
  \ to round, rather than forcing them to sustain their quantum field by casting specific\
  \ anchoring spells. Witchwarpers can even gain the ability to anchor their quantum\
  \ field through their Strikes!</p>\n      <p>Witchwarpers have a big impact. Conjuring\
  \ zones of otherworldly darkness. Infusing spells with energy from another reality,\
  \ or even borrowing spells and ancestry feats from other realities. Altering the\
  \ flow of time. Erasing enemies from existence. When every reality is at your disposal,\
  \ the possibilities are infinite.</p>\n      <p>We’re especially keen to receive\
  \ your feedback on the witchwarper class, as it’s gone through multiple different\
  \ realities during the course of development. The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\"\
  >Starfinder Playtest</a> site is the place to watch for news and info about the\
  \ playtest and feedback process, and we’ll have more Starfinder Second Edition news\
  \ at GenCon 2024. Which is to say—quite soon!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
