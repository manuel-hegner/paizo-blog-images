  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's no secret that I find Tim Pratt\
  \ hilarious. I first got a taste of his snarky humor back in 2012 in his first Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy8rkv\"><em>City of the Fallen Sky</em></a>—\
  and Skiver remains one of my favorite supporting characters—but it was in 2013's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1j\"><em>Liar's Blade</em></a> that he introduced the\
  \ charming con man Rodrick and his talking sword Hrym and won my heart forever.</p>\

  \  <br> <i>Illustration by Eric Belisle</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>See, humorous fantasy\
  \ is really, <i>really</i> difficult to do well. If you're not careful, it can end\
  \ up feeling juvenile or corny, or else become a farce—a wink-nudge pastiche that\
  \ is as much laughing <i>at</i> fantasy as <i>with</i> it. Tim's humor, on the other\
  \ hand, comes from the characters he creates. The world isn't designed to be humorous—\
  it's as serious as our own—but the characters find the humor inherent in even the\
  \ bleakest circumstances, often at their own expense. This is Fafhrd and the Grey\
  \ Mouser territory, as well as that of glorious 80s action-comedies like <em>Die\
  \ Hard</em> and <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, and the snappy self-aware dialogue of a\
  \ Tarantino or George Clooney character. It's bombastic action that understands\
  \ the frequent absurdity that goes hand in hand with being awesome.</p> \n    <p>Which\
  \ is why, when Tim pitched me on the idea of a new Rodrick and Hrym novel with the\
  \ phrase \"Rodrick and Hrym join the Suicide Squad,\" I was hooked. Where <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9ckd\"><em>Liar's Island</em></a> had been a chance for us to check\
  \ out Jalmeray in a way we hadn't since the module <a href=\"/products/btpy8ihu\"\
  ><em>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</em></a>, this book would focus on some of our\
  \ more familiar settings: Lastwall and Nirmathas. It'd also give Tim the chance\
  \ to invent a bunch of high-end criminals, and make them all try to work together,\
  \ which goes about as well as trapping a bunch of cats in a sack. (When Rodrick's\
  \ starting to sound like the reasonable one, you know you're in trouble.) Add in\
  \ a favorite monster from the very birth of Pathfinder, and I was sold.</p> \n \
  \   <p>I deeply enjoyed the chance to ride along with the Bickering Duo again in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9ip6\"><em>Liar's Bargain</em></a>, and I hope you will\
  \ as well!</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p>\
