  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When most people hear the name “Pathfinder\
  \ Society,” they likely associate it with Paizo's real-world organized play program.\
  \ Yet the Pathfinder Society is a long-established and influential organization\
  \ within the world of Golarion itself. Explorers from the Society have set foot\
  \ onto continents basically unknown to the Inner Sea, while the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>\
  \ have provided evening entertainment for some and inspiration into adventure for\
  \ others. They have brought distant and long-forgotten sites into the forefront\
  \ of cultural discussion, and hold some of the most complete libraries on certain\
  \ subjects as can be found on the planet. Their allies are varied and many, from\
  \ the crusaders who fought to close the Worldwound in Mendev and who now struggle\
  \ against the Whispering Tyrant's armies, to the powerful Blakros family of Absalom—\
  which was recently discovered to have gained its riches by sacrificing members of\
  \ its family to forces in the Shadow Plane. Their enemies are just as disparate,\
  \ from the exploitative Aspis Consortium to the Peacebuilders of Absalom, who are\
  \ nothing more than aggravated neighbors who have become collateral damage in the\
  \ Pathfinders' dealings one too many times.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ to say, the Pathfinder Society has a very complex and storied history.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The goal of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0233q?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a> is to provide a comprehensive\
  \ snapshot of the ins and outs of this organization, from the twists of its history\
  \ to its many everyday operations. For those interested in having their characters\
  \ join the Pathfinder Society, the first two chapters present a detailed look at\
  \ life in the Society as a whole, from daily routines and yearly holidays to the\
  \ many branches of training that Pathfinder recruits are expected to familiarize\
  \ themselves with. Even those adventurers with little interest in the Society might\
  \ find themselves picking up a useful trick or two from a Pathfinder ally or rival.\
  \ Might your character learn a bit of the Society's silent Napsu-Sign to quietly\
  \ communicate danger to allies (or communicate more accessibly to the deaf and mute)?\
  \ Could one find a weakness-seeking alignment ampoule useful on her adventures?\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Even those characters who find their calling elsewhere are likely\
  \ to encounter one of the Pathfinders' many lodges on their adventures! From the\
  \ frozen Lands of the Linnorm Kings to the impossible kingdom of Nex, Pathfinder\
  \ strongholds can be found, harboring dozens of agents as they prepare to explore\
  \ even more distant locales. These lodges are more than just a welcome spot of reprieve\
  \ and resupply for the weary hero—no matter how subtle, the works of the local Pathfinder\
  \ lodge always have an impact on local politics. From the political turmoil that\
  \ the seemingly ill-fated Exalted Lodge is causing in Razmiran to Starrise Spire's\
  \ increasingly tenuous claim to one of Mendev's grandest fortifications, the presence\
  \ of the Pathfinders provides multiple plot hooks for other heroes to become involved\
  \ in, be they allies, enemies, or entirely disinterested in the Pathfinder Society\
  \ itself!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c9c69e15-fa1a-4b5d-bb4d-a10656a30f0f/100520_PathfinderScholar.jpg\"\

  \  </div> \n     <p>Finally comes a host of adventuring gear, magic items, and even\
  \ companions that the Pathfinders commonly use and could provide—but that any hero\
  \ might desire! From mundane tools such as glass cutters to customized wayfinders\
  \ and unusual aeon stones, the Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide has many pieces\
  \ of exciting equipment that PCs can receive (or steal) in their interactions with\
  \ the Society. Specific Pathfinder teachers can offer lessons in special feats (and\
  \ who wouldn't want to learn Exploding Death Drop), while society agents might introduce\
  \ a character to special new familiars such as an aeon wyrd, a wicker poppet, or\
  \ even an adorable dweomercat cub!</p> \n     <p>Groups that aren’t part of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign can still have the Pathfinder Society\
  \ be a part of their campaigns with the help of this book. Groups could include\
  \ the Pathfinder Society as the core of their campaigns, assign the Society to a\
  \ supporting role, or even come in direct competition with Pathfinders as rivals.\
  \ This book is still a great resource for groups not interested in including the\
  \ Pathfinder Society in their campaigns as the new rules options are broad enough\
  \ for most adventuring parties to use any time!</p> \n     <p>The Pathfinder Society\
  \ is a group built by adventurers, for adventurers. Whether that makes you want\
  \ to join up or makes you want to run a Society-focused game, the result is sure\
  \ to make a great story!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\"\
