  \ itemprop=\"description\">Happy New Year, everyone! As we return from our holiday\
  \ vacations, John, Tonya, and I have been diving into some projects that have been\
  \ sitting on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ back burner for some time. We are happy to announce the release of the first of\
  \ these projects—the Pathfinder Society Campaign Clarifications Document.</p> \n\

  \ \n    <p>As anyone who has ever seen the official list of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources</a> knows, Pathfinder Society characters have many options.\
  \ As anyone who is a regular on our forums knows, some of these options can be interpreted\
  \ in different ways. When these rules ambiguities crop up in a home campaign, where\
  \ a player is likely to have only one GM, the GM and the player can work together\
  \ to find a satisfying solution. In the organized play campaign, where players are\
  \ likely to have many GMs over the course of each character’s adventures, these\
  \ ambiguities can lead to substantially different rules interpretations from table\
  \ to table. We created this document to help reach one of goals of organized play—\
  to provide an equitable gaming experience to players all over the world. The Clarifications\
  \ Document is a centralized place for us to offer official rulings for ambiguous\
  \ rules.</p> \n    <p>Many of these interpretations are the suggestions of the developers\
  \ who worked on the rules in the first place, which have until now been unofficial\
  \ posts on the messageboards. Others come out of Additional Resources, which we\
  \ will be trimming down a bit in the next update. The last source is a list of ambiguities\
  \ I’ve been saving until we had a clear plan for how to address them. I’m sure some\
  \ of you will notice a couple of rules elements mentioned in the Clarifications\
  \ Document that are not currently legal in Pathfinder Society. These elements will\
  \ appear in our next update of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources</a>.</p> \n    <p>While GMs are free to use clarifications\
  \ from this document in their home campaigns if they wish, these are not official\
  \ errata. The Clarifications Document principally addresses rules material that\
  \ appears in softcover sources such as the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/campaignSetting\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a> and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/companion\"\
  >Pathfinder Player Companion</a> lines, rather than the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a> hardcover books. As part of our Additional Resources\
  \ process, we plan to revisit this document each month and make changes if necessary.\
  \ What rules ambiguities have you seen in your Pathfinder Society games that you\
  \ would like to see resolved?</p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\
