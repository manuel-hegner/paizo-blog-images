  \ To the dunes!</i></p> \n   <p>Tef-Naju stirred within the walls of his great marble\
  \ prison. It was day, not that it mattered in this subterranean place, but he could\
  \ feel the element of fire heating the sands above. He did not sleep, not in the\
  \ way that human men had described the pastime as such. But his mind had been wandering,\
  \ dreamlike, through eon-old memories of the plane of earth and other shaitan he\
  \ had once known. He reached out to rouse Aiveria, but the stone maiden was not\
  \ beside him. She was practicing the motions of her kata. Over a thousand years\
  \ it had become a dance of strength and deadly grace that had once made him weep\
  \ to see. So, he waited and listened.</p> \n   <p>Movement sixteen—the swoosh of\
  \ her sword cutting the air, then the soft tinkling of the coins that dangled from\
  \ her hem as she placed her foot for the swift, jaw-smashing kick. She had come\
  \ to his bastion to save the once-legendary shaitan from his eternal servitude and,\
  \ finding the task impossible, chose to stay. In many ways, she had saved him. He\
  \ had found peace and companionship with her. Their routine had become timeless,\
  \ and the anger he once felt toward his captor had chipped away to a tiny flint\
  \ in his heart.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6035-TefNajusBastion.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>Yes, you can lose to Tef-Naju and still be rewarded with his trove.\
  \ Keep that in mind.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>Above, the sands skittered with the\
  \ rhythmic marching of feet. Not animals. These moved with the cadence of creatures\
  \ of hurried purpose. Not shaitan or oread, either. The footsteps were too light,\
  \ too fast. Humans, then. His suspicions were confirmed as the Elemental Trenches\
  \ above crackled to life. Suddenly, the vast tunnels below the trenches hummed anew—\
  arteries carrying vast elemental power, technology of the lost Shory people built\
  \ to be turned against them. Built by a pharaoh who thought himself a god. A pharaoh\
  \ who enslaved countless elementals and guarded his works with their corpses. The\
  \ genie had thought the pharaoh would die like other men. This way, Tef-Naju assumed\
  \ the contract would wither. And yet, still he had to protect this place. A genie\
  \ could no more break a contract than a cricket could pull down the sun.</p> \n\
  \   <p>And so Tef-Naju whispered through the sandstone floor to awaken the hanshepsu\
  \ nearest the entrance. Aiveria had taken it upon herself to repaint the guardian\
  \ constructs a century or two ago. The iridescent black-beetle wings of their heads\
  \ glimmered with a realism that would surely please Khepri, the craftsman god they\
  \ honored. Moreover, the hanshepsu were tough. With a little luck, the uninvited\
  \ guests would be stopped and he could join Aiveria on the balcony for conversation\
  \ and sculpting, as they so often spent their pleasant days.</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \   </div> \n   <p>But alas, the shaitan groaned as he felt a sand elemental, not\
  \ one of his own, envelop the hanshepsu, immobilizing it.</p> \n   <p>The smaller\
  \ of the interlopers set a chest upon the ground and drew a weapon—an artifact of\
  \ an ancient war between gods and elementals. The large stone rod animated and,\
  \ unhinging its massive jaw, swallowed the hanshepsu whole. The stone maiden who\
  \ had worked so lovingly to paint it would be unhappy. He would have to tell her\
  \ later.</p> \n   <p>The largest of the guests, an orc-blooded that wore the crest\
  \ of the tax-collector god walked through the massive doors to the tunnels and gathered\
  \ power around himself. Locks and traps would not stop a Gatekeeper, the shaitan\
  \ thought, his slate forehead cracking as it furrowed. He would have to slip by\
  \ Aiveria to take care of them himself. Surrounded by tombs of his master's many\
  \ other victims, Tef-Naju had lost the taste for death. And surely his lovely consort\
  \ would rage upon discovering a favorite sculpture lost.</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \ around the half-orc cleric, its power released to quickly race through the tunnels.\
  \ But it was a clumsy spell, the vision cracking a delicate seal upon one of the\
  \ nastier curses stored amongst canopic jars. The cleric clutched his eyes, screamed,\
  \ and sank his teeth into his armor, attempting to tear pieces away as his teeth\
  \ chipped then broke.</p> \n   <p>The smaller guest fumbled with her mighty rod,\
  \ startled as Tef-Naju rose from the floor.</p> \n   <p>\"You are not welcome in\

  And what if we kill the Forgotten Pharaoh? What then?\" The staff-wielder was clever,\
  \ it seemed.</p> \n   <p>\"Then I would be free,\" Tef-Naju replied. The word felt\
  \ hard on his tongue. \"But I am obliged to thwart you. I cannot let you pass.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>She set her jaw as they willed power around themselves. Another magus,\
  \ the genie thought. He had crushed a thousand elemental magi in his training a\
  \ hundred lifetimes ago. He would have to be careful. Flesh was so weak compared\
  \ to stone. He dodged and struck, the hard lines of the contract stopping him from\
  \ pulling back too much. Nevertheless, she persisted. The law was satisfied and\
  \ he could relent.</p> \n   <p>\"I have no tea or water,\" he said, helping her\
  \ panting form up from the painted stone floor. \"But I can show you a lovely view\
  \ of the sand waterfall and I'm sure my companion would be pleased to have someone\
  \ else to discuss her sculptures. Come to my trove. I have a gift for you, such\
  \ that your soft flesh might not tear when you stand before the pharaoh Hakotep.\"\
