  \ Alex Stone</p> \n     <h3>Alexi Greer</h3> \n     <p>\"Hello! My name is Alexi\
  \ and I wrote the technology section for the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>.\
  \ This book is full to the brim with worldbuilding deep-dives, and I had a blast\
  \ writing for such a fascinating subject. My other works for Paizo can be found\
  \ in the Starship Operations Manual and the upcoming Starfinder Society Quest Pack:\
  \ A Waltz Through Myriad Worlds.</p> \n     <p>I live in the wild, untamed lands\
  \ known as Orlando, Florida. When I’m not writing as a freelancer, I’m organizing\
  \ Society events and volunteering at local conventions. My other hobbies include\
  \ historical sword fighting, dice collecting, and reptile keeping. Despite all of\
  \ those things sounding suspiciously dragon-related, I am unfortunately human. Not-so-unfortunately,\
  \ I share my living space with two furry overlords: a tailless cat named Hecate,\
  \ and a tail-included cat named Mystique.</p> \n     <p>I’ve worn a lot of hats\
  \ in the tabletop industry, from game store management to card warehouse stocker.\
  \ Writing has been my favorite hat, though. It’s not just a chance to create something\
  \ new, but an opportunity to help readers do the same with their own games. I hope\
  \ when you read the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> you find new ideas and new\
  \ ways of viewing old topics. Should you ever see me at a convention, feel free\
  \ to say, “Hi” and tell me about your Starfinder adventures!\"</p> \n     <br> \n\
  \     <h3>John Curtin</h3> \n     <p>My name is John Curtin and I’m thrilled to\
  \ be making content for Paizo! Besides being part of the absolutely amazing team\
  \ that worked on the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, I’ve contributed the Opulus\
  \ Ambassador to Starfinder <em>Adventure Path #30: Puppets Without Strings</em>,\
  \ created the astriapi and ravenous drakes for <em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em>,\
  \ and co-wrote the repeatable <rm>\n       Starfinder Society Scenario #2-19: Truth\
  \ Keepers with Natalie Kertzner. I started playing TTRPGs on a middle school bus\
  \ ride where a friend introduced me to the idea of a story I could interact with,\
  \ and my bookish brain immediately latched on and hasn’t let go since! I’ve been\
  \ casually writing adventures and characters, off and on, for the 20-some-odd years\
  \ since, and love sharing stories with tables of fellow adventurers and story-tellers.\
  \ All of this culminated at PaizoCon 2019, where a highly goofy Twitter side project\
  \ and a chance introduction to Joe Pasini culminated in a follow-up message post-con\
  \ where I apologized for being an awkward dolt and suggested that I of course would\
  \ be thrilled to write for Starfinder, even if wasn’t the impression that spilled\
  \ out of my mouth while I was busy being starstruck from meeting a real Paizo employee\
  \ in the flesh. The rest, as they say, is history!\n      </rm></p> \n     <p>When\
  \ I’m not gaming or writing, my wife and I love to explore the outdoors, try new\
  \ cuisine, and check out museums and live performances of all stripes. You can follow\
  \ me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Curtin_Writes\" target=\"_blank\"\

  \ \n     <p>Hey, y’all! You may know me from my time at Paizo in various roles.\
  \ In the two years since I’ve become a substitute paraprofessional and have undergone\
  \ a total creative reset. With some encouragement from my friends and former coworkers,\
  \ I took the opportunity to contribute to <em>Alien Archive 4</em> and the <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em>. I have a deep love of the natural world and sharing all\
  \ I can about it with others. Writing up the desert biome entry prompted diving\
  \ into all I could find about the earth's own fantastic and weird arid ecosystems,\
  \ and if anyone ever wants to talk about those plants, rocks, and critters, I'm\
  \ 100% down! Lately, I get outside with my sweet pittie-lab mix, Sagan, maintain\
  \ more than 50 houseplants, take pictures and video, and work on my incredibly laggy\
  \ <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> island. You can find me at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisandmtns\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@chrisandmtns</a>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Solatra Lilac\
  \ Harvinkai (nov/nov)</h3> \n     <p>Hi, I'm Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, regularly\
  \ credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving (nov/nov), and I'm a freelance designer! I wrote\
  \ the mechanic, solarian, and vanguard class options you'll find in the <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em>. I'm also an active participant in Starfinder Society\
  \ as a four-nova GM, and a regular contributor to design work for several third-party\
  \ publishers. When I'm not writing for Paizo I'm usually working with Legendary\
  \ Games on their Stellar Options line (among other things), helping Storm Bunny\
  \ Studios with the Starfinder conversion of the World of Alessia campaign setting,\
  \ and advocating for queer liberation in the city of Chicago. If you enjoy my work,\
  \ you can find me on twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kingtheline\" target=\"\

  \ (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full time freelance\
  \ author. I started freelancing in 2019 with <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-03:\
  \ The Withering World</em> and over the last two years I have contributed to just\
  \ over 30 projects for Paizo, including the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>,\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Lost Omens Ancestry\
  \ Guide</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, <em>Starfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #39: The Gilded Cage</em> (volume 6 of the Fly Free or Die Adventure\
  \ Path), and seven organized play scenarios. For the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>\
  \ I wrote the technomancer and witchwarper class options, the alignment world attribute,\
  \ and (my personal favorite) the background section, which is a series of random\
  \ tables to help players create or further develop their character's backgrounds,\
  \ life experiences, and relationships. Contributing to the Galaxy Exploration Manual\
  \ was a wonderful experience and I couldn’t be prouder of the final product. I hope\
  \ you enjoy the book as much as I do. Follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/d20diaries\"\

  \ \n     <p>Hello! I'm Kendra, and I've been freelancing for Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ for about 5 years now. I wrote the airborne biome, mystic connections, operative\
  \ exploits, and the NPC toolbox for the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I really\
  \ enjoyed working on all those sections, but my favorite part was probably the food\
  \ sidebar of the airborne biome. Adding in little details like food, cultural traditions,\
  \ and aphorisms can make a setting come alive and feel like a living world outside\
  \ the game table, so I always try to work those in where possible, whether writing\
  \ or GMing.</p> \n     <p>Other Paizo projects I've worked on recently include <em>PFS\
  \ Scenario #2-15: A Dirge for Sarkoris</em>; the caligni, maftet and scalescribe\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>; and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #37: The\
  \ White Glove Affair</em> (volume 6 of the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path)—which\
  \ also involved some food research, funnily enough. I have a few other cool things\
  \ in the works as well, both in Pathfinder- and Starfinder-land, and will hopefully\
  \ be able to say more about those soon!</p> \n     <p>When I'm not writing or playing\
  \ TTRPGs, I can be found reading (current obsession: the October Daye books by Seanan\
  \ McGuire), playing video games (<em>Dishonored 2</em> right now, or <em>Animal\
  \ Crossing</em> when I need something relaxing), or baking in my very tiny kitchen.\

  \ \n     <p>Приветствую вас, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich\
  \ Rekun, and I’m a bit of a regular contributor to these blogs. You may recognize\
  \ me from past works such as <em>Lost Omen Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia), <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Scenario #1-15: Blooming Catastrophe</em>, and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #31:\
  \ Waking the Worldseed</em> (the Hibb Gazetteer). When not seeing how much I can\
  \ mix satiric comedy and cosmic horror, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator,\
  \ specializing in diplomatic history. I’ve published a book, even, which some people\
  \ have read.</p> \n     <p>For the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, I’m responsible\
  \ for the Starship Toolbox, most notably the <em>Known Variable</em> (working title:\
  \ <em>The N-1-MH</em>), and the Accord section, which means that if you ever want\
  \ to use Leadership in Starfinder, you may thank and/or blame me.</p> \n     <p>Today\
  \ though, I also want to mention another project I’m working on: <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum\
  \ of the Luminant Age</em> is a setting based around the idea of what happens when\
  \ a high-cyberpunk technological society collapses very, very thoroughly, and then\
  \ a thousand or so years later you have a nice, swashbuckling pseudo-Renaissance\
  \ city state built on the ruins (literally). Check out our Twitter at <a href=\"\

  \ and keep an eye out for upcoming product—our first kickstarter project (<a href=\"\

  \ \n     <p><em>Marhaba</em>/hello fellow Pathfinders and Starfinders! My name is\
  \ Shahreena. My works are often inspired by world languages, cultures, and traditions.\
  \ I’ve contributed to several projects for Starfinder; more recently, the Religion\
  \ section in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I was excited about contributing\
  \ to this section--especially, the adventure hooks--as some were inspired by the\
  \ zany interactions among characters of my local lodge. (Buckeye Lodge, y’all are\
  \ awesome!) In 2020–2021, besides playing online with many amazing inter/national\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder players and sharing my love of GIFs with nufriends,\
  \ I embarked on a new creative journey. I started adapting world languages, folktales,\
  \ and legends on YouTube. If you’re interested in seeing these works, please visit\

  \ honored to win the Hot Key Books' Young Writer's Prize. Writing for Starfinder\
