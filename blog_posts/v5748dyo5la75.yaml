  articleBody\"> \n   <p>Back by popular demand, the second in our line of Wayne-Reynolds-designed\
  \ iconic characters is the beautiful and mysterious sorceress Seoni.</p> \n   <p>Unlike\
  \ the barbarians-gone-native on the eastern plateau or the colonial Chelliaxian\
  \ immigrants of the south, Seoni is a native Varisian, a nomadic race whose closest\
  \ real-world cultural analogue is the Romani. Or at least, she's mostly Varisian—\
  as might be apparent from her otherworldly grace, there's something not quite human\
  \ in her ancestry. Though she doesn't have any hard facts, Seoni herself has picked\
  \ up on some of this, and is constantly pushed to search deeper into the mysteries\
  \ of her heritage by strange dreams that she doesn't understand.</p> \n   <p>More\
  \ than just ornamentation, Seoni's runic tattoos play a large role in her personality.\
  \ Coming from a people where tattoo magic maintains a strong following, hers are\
  \ simultaneously a manifestation of her power and a tool to aid in her castings.\
  \ The sheer number adorning her skin, as well as the similar patterns woven into\
  \ her clothes, are a mark of status among her tribe, though many of the so-called\
  \ \"civilized\" residents of Varisia look upon such body modification with distaste.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Despite being a consummate adventurer, Seoni is something of an enigma\
  \ to her compatriots. Quietly neutral on most matters, bound by codes and mandates\
  \ that she rarely feels compelled to explain, the sorceress keeps her emotions tightly\
  \ bottled. Extremely detail oriented—what the more pugnacious members of her party\
  \ call a \"control freak\"—Seoni is a careful and meticulous planner, a schemer\
  \ who frequently finds herself frustrated by the improvised plans of her more impulsive\
  \ companions. Despite all of this, Seoni has stuck by her comrades through numerous\
  \ tight spots, a fact that continues to amaze and confuse Valeros, who wonders loudly\
  \ (although not altogether unappreciatively) about \"the witch and her schemes.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>As with so many things, however, if Seoni understands her motivations,\
  \ she's keeping that knowledge to herself.</p> \n   <br> \n   <p>Seoni, along with\
  \ the rest of the first four iconics, makes her debut as a pregenerated character\
  \ in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpr\">volume 1 of <i>Pathfinder</i></a> and <a href=\"\
