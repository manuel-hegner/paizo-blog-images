  \ week I'm off to the great nation of France to celebrate the 10th anniversary of\
  \ our partners at Black Book Editions, who publish Pathfinder in French. I'll be\
  \ taking a little vacation at the end of the trip, so the Pathfinder Battles Preview\
  \ will go on a two-week hiatus following today's preview. I usually try to post\
  \ these updates from the road, but this time I'm going to let vacation be vacation.\
  \ I hope to come back to finish out the last few Reign of Winter figures, and that\
  \ should coincide with some previews (and heck, an announcement!) for the next set.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>But that's all in the future. Let's focus on today.</p> \n    <p>As I\
  \ mentioned in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg0m\">last week's blog</a>, we've\
  \ made some changes to the subscription benefits that will kick in with the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set, which is still scheduled for a late\
  \ May arrival. Going forward, customers with an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing\
  \ Case Subscription</a> will receive a 30% discount on their case purchases. The\
  \ comments thread to last week's blog contained a number of questions about <i>which</i>\
  \ price the discount applies to. In fact, this discount is applied to the final\
  \ price, not the MSRP. In the case of <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>,\
  \ subscribers will take the 30% discount off the $399.99 list price, bringing the\
  \ price of a case (before the incentive figure) to $279.99. We'll get paizo.com\
  \ updated shortly to reflect these new changes.</p> \n    <p>With that out of the\
  \ way, let's take a look at some miniatures!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a Goblin Alchemist, drawn\
  \ from the pages of the second <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a> adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy8wfl\">The\
  \ Shackled Hut</a>, by Jim Groves. In the adventure, the Goblin Alchemist is named\
  \ Grindtooth, and he leads a small gang of snow goblin bully-boys in the city of\
  \ Whitethrone. In your campaign, he makes a nice addition to the hordes of goblins\
  \ we've already produced, albeit this one is dressed for maximum warmth and his\
  \ skin is a bit more on the blue side of things. The Goblin Alchemist is a Small,\
  \ common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_CroneQueen_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_CroneQueen_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This chilly lady is a Crone Queen, a former leader\
  \ of the nation of Irrisen and a daughter of the immortal witch queen Baba Yaga.\
  \ When one of Baba Yaga's chosen daughters has served her 100-year tenure as Queen\
  \ of Irrisen, the Queen of Witches comes to replace her with another daughter. These\
  \ former queens never leave the confines of the witch's <i>Dancing Hut</i>. Drained\
  \ of their vitality and power by Baba Yaga and imprisoned deep inside the hut's\
  \ innermost chambers, these daughters become crone queens, undead mockeries of the\
  \ powerful witches they once were. Soiler alert: You fight a bunch of them in the\
  \ final <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> adventure. With a clear\
  \ \"ice\" staff and crown and a dynamic pose, this scary lady is a Medium-sized,\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_QueenElvanna_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_QueenElvanna_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of the final <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a> adventure, your PCs will also meet our next figure thereâ€”Queen\
  \ Elvanna, the current leader of Irrisen and the instigator of the events of the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter Adventure\
  \ Path</a>. The fewer words spent on her role, the less spoilerific this blog becomes,\
  \ so let's just leave it at this: You'll need a miniature of her. She's got a cool\
  \ (ha!) ice staff and crown, and a raven perched on her shoulder. (The same Raven\
  \ that is also a figure in this set? YOU decide!) Queen Elvanna is a beautifully\
  \ sculpted Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for\
  \ this week. I'm off to France. See you in two weeks!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br\
