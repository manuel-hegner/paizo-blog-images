  \ nicest things about being a Paizo fan is getting inspired to create things from\
  \ the world of Golarion, and before I was hired at Paizo, Hugo \"Butterfrog\" Solis\
  \ and I hatched a mad crazy scheme to produce something for the hard-working Paizo\
  \ staff—a fanzine, to capture that same sense of excitement when the latest Dragon\
  \ and Dungeon magazine got into your hot little hands. <a href=\"/companies/paizoFansUnited\"\
  ><i>Wayfinder</i></a> has been called a love letter to Paizo, which is probably\
  \ the best compliment I've ever gotten on anything I've ever helped come to fruition.\
  \ It was always a real treat to see how happy Paizo staff are when reading new Golarion\
  \ material that they didn't have a hand in making—now they were the ones waiting\
  \ for spoilers and new ideas!</span></p> \n    <p>But now the tables have turned,\
  \ and now I'm the one eagerly awaiting <a href=\"/companies/paizoFansUnited\"><i>Wayfinder</i></a>\
  \ to appear on my desk! With the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1h\">eighth issue</a>\
  \ now available, I'm just as excited to read it as I was to help make the first\
  \ four issues. But the very best part is that <a href=\"/companies/paizoFansUnited\"\
  ><i>Wayfinder</i></a> is completely FREE, and full of incredible art, maps, adventures,\
  \ NPCs, new magic items, and original fiction from authors familiar and new! The\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1h\">latest issue of <i>Wayfinder</i></a> takes a nautical\
  \ bent, with enough additional material for any coastal or seafaring campaign such\
  \ as the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, or anytime your game gets close to the water. It includes\
  \ a short adventure (suitable for a side trek for some additional XP), new prestige\
  \ classes like the Ulfen sea captain, new magic items like the grappling hook hand\
  \ or peg-leg of stability, archetypes like the argonaut and marine, new material\
  \ for kingdom-building rules from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\"\
  >Kingmaker Adventure Path</a>, how to properly pay obeisance to Father Dagon, how\
  \ to the run <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a> as an aquatic game...</p> \n    <p>Have\
  \ I mentioned yet that this is all completely FREE, made by fans just like you,\
  \ and all you gotta do is <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1h\">go download it</a>?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If this free fan-produced material has whetted your appetite to craft\
  \ some of your own, <i>Wayfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief Tim \"Timitius\" Nightengale\
  \ has <a href=\"/threads/rzs2pbms\">thrown down the gauntlet</a>! He wants to see\
  \ your submissions for Wayfinder #9, the theme of which is all about what dwells\
  \ in the dark caverns beneath the surface—the Darklands! Made by fans for fans and\
  \ with the same level of dedication and quality you would expect out of any professional\
  \ publication, this is a challenge to strut your game design stuff with the next\
  \ <a href=\"/companies/paizoFansUnited\"><i>Wayfinder</i></a>, which will debut\
  \ at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2013</a>! Check out the call for submissions\
  \ <a href=\"/threads/rzs2pbms\">here</a>, and check out all eight issues of <i>Wayfinder</i>\
  \ (and the Pathfinder Chronicler Anthology) <a href=\"/companies/paizoFansUnited\"\
