  \ \n     <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and\
  \ presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that are appearing\
  \ on this list for the first time. Because they’ve consistently topped the list,\
  \ and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and\
  \ “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers\
  \ lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention.\

  \ tarot, waiting to be discovered. Including three focus arcana subclasses, card-casting\
  \ capabilities, and many ways to manipulate your Major Arcana deck of spells, will\
  \ you control fate, or will fate control you? Includes over 50 class feats and a\
  \ multiclass dedication for those who wish to dabble only slightly in the tarot.\
  \ Includes 23 pages of content for the class, five of which include art for each\
  \ of the Major Arcana cards and information on spells associated with them.</p>\

  >Deep Space Adventures: Eldritch Emissaries (SF)*</a></b><br> Wielding ancient knowledge\
  \ and mystical power, eldritch emissaries are individuals who have made deals and\
  \ agreements with otherworldly forces that often stay hidden in the fabric of the\
  \ multiverse to fulfill their own ends—but they are in turn manipulated by those\
  \ same forces. This has all the rules needed to play an eldritch emissary, including\
  \ new weapon special properties, critical hit effects, fusions, aeon stones, and\
  \ other magical items. It also has rules for making NPC eldritch emissaries and\
  \ applying optional rules to them.</p> \n     <br> \n     <p><b><a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/400727/Everything-Shields?affiliate_id=2791261\"\

  \ <em>Everything Shields</em> Pathfinder Second Edition supplement, you can create\
  \ hundreds of customized shields and shield-focused characters. Do you want to play\
  \ a swashbuckling, targe-wielding duelist whose shield can exude darkness on command\
  \ when you get in a pinch? Or a mobile warrior who throws a mithral hoplon that\
  \ returns after each attack? How about a witch who has etched a hex onto the face\
  \ of their shield to make enemies falter when they attack? All of these options\
  \ and many more are possible with <em>Everything Shields</em>!</p> \n     <br> \n\

  \ Wizards construct new spells, druids befriend newly observed species, occultists\
  \ uncover secrets thought lost, and clerics receive novel blessings. This book explores\
  \ these lesser-known facets with new player options for Pathfinder Second Edition.\
  \ This 144-page supplement of player options includes two new classes (mesmerist\
  \ and shifter), 35 archetypes, new class options and feats for most spellcasting\
  \ classes, spell skill actions, and over 60 new spells (including consolation cantrips).</p>\

  \ different: to heal, to learn, to love, to escape, but the destination is always\
  \ the same. What Impossible Paths brought these folks together? This book details\
  \ the Clockwork Clinic and 11 new NPCs hailing from across the Impossible Lands,\

  \ minotaurs of Golarion are a powerful and brave people who have been overlooked\
  \ for years, considered by some to be violent monsters and worshippers of the demon\
  \ lord Baphomet. What many don’t know is that there are a number of diverse minotaur\
  \ cultures across Golarion that seek a different path and have long since forged\
  \ their own destiny. If you wish to play a powerful and cunning ancestry with a\
  \ complex and untold history, <em>Minotaurs Unleashed</em> is for you! In this book,\
  \ you’ll find the minotaur ancestry, with six heritages and 24 ancestry feats; lore\
  \ from the three major centers of minotaur civilization—the Isles of Kortos, Vudra,\
  \ and Iblydos; the new longhorn greataxe advanced weapon for the minotaur ancestry;\
  \ a conversion of the Iblydan hero god Iapholi from Pathfinder First Edition; and\

  \ and wizards! If you ever desired to play ancestors or lore oracles, or metamagical\
  \ experimentation wizards, without feeling that some other curses or theses might\
  \ have been more mechanically potent, look no further! <em>Revised Options: Curses\
  \ and Wizardry</em> includes errata for the oracle class aimed at removing some\
  \ feat taxes, such as Divine Access, as well as substantial empowerment of the less\

  \ is a simple encounter scenario designed for a single session, suitable for a 4th-level\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Infinite, Artificial Intelligence, and You</h3> \n    \
  \ <p>Last month, we discussed how potential changes to the Open Game License and\
  \ the forthcoming release of the Open Roleplaying Content license would affect publishers\
  \ on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite. Well, this month, I wanted to address some\
  \ questions from the community about Paizo's <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si91?Paizo-and-Artificial-Intelligence\"\
  >recent statement</a> on content created by artificial intelligence. Put simply,\
  \ Paizo’s “no AI” policy applies to works sold on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite,\
  \ too.</p> \n     <p>For those looking to get into publishing material on Infinite\
  \ who had planned to use AI-generated artwork, I recommend checking out some of\
  \ the community-run resources that exist to help people take those first steps into\
  \ community content publishing, like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pathfinderinfinite/\"\
  >r/pathfinderinfinite</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.infiknight.net/\">Infinite Possibilities\
  \ Discord</a>, or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/drivethrurpg\">DriveThru's own Discord</a>\
  \ where publishers can all help one another out, both for Infinite or more general\
  \ publishing. There are also Infinite publishers who make and sell stock art for\
  \ both Pathfinder and Starfinder that cost only a few dollars and give the purchaser\
  \ the right to reuse that art in their own Infinite publications. There are also\
  \ hundreds of pieces of official Paizo artwork that Infinite publishers can use\
  \ under the terms of the license.</p> \n     <p class=\"BodyCopy\">&nbsp;</p> \n\
  \     <p>There are lots of ways to get art made for your publications that both\
  \ support real live artists, help build up the community, and don't rely on tools\
  \ with currently questionable ethics or copyright ownership. If the tools and resources\
  \ above don’t meet your needs, you may consider releasing your work under the Pathfinder\
  \ Compatibility License instead of on Pathfinder Infinite in order to use AI-generated\
  \ art free of these restrictions, and please use the comments of this blog to let\
  \ me and the rest of the team know what other resources we can potentially direct\
  \ you to or provide to make those first steps into self-publishing that much easier.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Thanks for everything you do to make Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite\
  \ the thriving communities they are.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
