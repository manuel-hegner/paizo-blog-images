  \        Each year, the United States celebrates LGBTQ+ Pride Month in June in honor\
  \ of the protests that took place at the Stonewall Inn, a queer club in NYC. The\
  \ first Pride was a riot, and every Pride going forward is a protest. We’re here,\
  \ we’re queer, we have always existed, and we will always exist.</p>\n      <p>This\
  \ year’s theme for Pride Month is “Reflect. Empower. Unite.” with a focus on coming\
  \ together as a community, standing up for ourselves and each other, and learning\
  \ from the trials of our predecessors. Support has always been a central pillar\
  \ of queer communities, and as we face new waves of bigotry and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation,\
  \ lifting each other up is more important than ever.</p>\n      <p>We’ve invited\
  \ LGBTQIA+ Paizo employees and contributors to share their words with us for this\
  \ community blog!</p>\n      <p>Also, Paizo is proud to be participating in Seattle\

  \ all, I’m lead editor at Paizo and a nonbinary trans man. Being queer has been\
  \ part of my life for as long as I can remember, even if I didn’t have words for\
  \ it when I was young. As time has gone on, being queer exposed me to the world\
  \ of social justice and activism, and I am a firm believer that no one is free until\
  \ we all are free. Queer people are actively under attack in our current political\
  \ climate. This is why it’s so important to me to center queer experiences in my\
  \ work. At Paizo, we have the opportunity to spread awareness of queer identities\
  \ to a large number of people, as well as making queer people feel seen in our books.\
  \ So Paizo will continue to be queer as heck, and I’m proud to be part of that.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Basil Wright (he/they/xe)</h3>\n      <p>I know that the\
  \ fight for equality, freedom, and safety by my Indigenous community in the States\
  \ is being echoed elsewhere, whether it's in Palestine, the Congo, Sudan, or in\
  \ the United States of America. As Juneteenth goes by, I am reminded about the power\
  \ of community, of the strength of those who stand beside you and uplift you and\
  \ work towards a common cause. We are all stronger together. More often than not,\
  \ I have found community with Indigenous creators, with Black creators, with queer\
  \ creators (and many of us holding all these identities together, such as myself).\
  \ I want to continue to create games and stories that highlight the importance of\
  \ community, of belonging, of togetherness. We are better, together.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>If you'd like to support my work, two of my games best exemplify the theme\
  \ of community: Mouseia and Well Wishers, which you can find on my Itch.io page\
  \ (<a href=\"https://kobanya.itch.io/\">https://kobanya.itch.io</a>). I also have\

  \ I'm proud to be a contributor to those books, and to a world like Golarion where\

  \ you to all my fellow authors, our wonderful devs at Paizo, and the many gamers\
  \ I share tables with for coming together to show that diversity is natural and\
  \ equality is attainable. Our real-life magic may be the stories we tell together,\
  \ and our real-life dragons look more like bills and endless to-do lists, but the\
  \ possibility of a better world is not a fantasy. Sitting down to play (or run)\

  \ first-ever IN-STUDIO series, GODKILLER: LAST HOPE! LAST HOPE is a two-person,\
  \ eight-episode show about Litany, the titular Godkiller forged for a single purpose:\
  \ to slay the Immortal Emperor of Heaven—and their mother’s sister. After a monumental\
  \ failure, Litany teams up with a heroic cultivator and travels across a richly\

  \      <p>My most recent Paizo work has yet to be announced, but you can get the\

  \ but in the past year I’ve felt such a deep connection to these two ideas as I’\
  ve grown to learn more about what I am and what it means to be a part of both the\
  \ LGBT+ and Paizo community. You must learn to love yourself before you can properly\
  \ love another. And that means being proud of yourself and your accomplishments,\
  \ even though it feels like you are fighting a voice deep inside you that hates\
  \ you for what you are. All love is a valid form of protest. And learning to love\
  \ yourself despite what the world’s hate has planted deep inside is the ultimate\
  \ act of defiance, and one I have only been empowered to face thanks to the unity\
  \ of this incredible community.</p>\n      <p>Proud to Love Myself.</p>\n      <br>\n\

  \      <br>\n      <h3>James Jacobs (he/him), Pathfinder Narrative Creative Director</h3>\n\
  \      <p>The previous 12 months since last year’s&nbsp;Pride&nbsp;blog have been\
  \ busy as we’ve navigated the frenzied switchover of Pathfinder from OGL content\
  \ to the Remastered rules. That’s mostly all behind us now from an in-house production\
  \ standpoint, and it’s a relief to be back on track exploring brand new stories.\
  \ One of those tales I’m really delighted to see hit the shelves, though, isn’t\
  \ an adventure or even a game. I’m talking about Liane Merciel’s upcoming novel,&nbsp;<em>Godsrain</em>.\
  \ It’s the first novel Paizo’s published in a long time, and it’s helping to kick\
  \ off the War of Immortals plotline, but the part I’m delighted most by is that\
  \ my favorite iconic Merisiel and her wife Kyra are front and center to the plot.\
  \ Bisexual representation is something I’ve been passionate about since the start\
  \ of Pathfinder, with Merisiel being my chosen heroine for this quest. I can’t wait\
  \ for you all to see what adventures she and the others up to while they’re also\
  \ saving the world!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Katina Davis (she/her)</h3>\n   \
  \   <p>Representation is important year-round, but during Pride month I feel especially\
  \ compelled to step forth from the shadows like a bisexual vampire to celebrate\
  \ queer stories. I don’t always feel qualified to speak on queer topics because\
  \ I’m married to a man and could easily be mistaken for straight. Then I remember\
  \ how I once felt under-represented and less sure of my identity, and how isolating\
  \ that can be. It’s taken me years to understand myself enough to find peace and\
  \ joy in who I am. If I can reflect that queer joy back to even one person who might\
  \ feel lonely and confused, that’s worth it to me. Just imagine the power of entire\
  \ communities full of that energy!</p>\n      <p>My years working and freelancing\
  \ for Paizo have been instrumental to my queer identity because they’ve introduced\
  \ me to a diverse and supportive group of people that I’m incredibly grateful for.\
  \ It makes sense given that we’re all tied by our love of a cooperative game—this\
  \ community is one big adventuring party. We roll initiative together.</p>\n   \

  \ me a safe space to figure myself out and unpack years of comphet.</p>\n      <p>Icon\
  \ Marsha P. Johnson said, “No pride for some of us without liberation for all of\
  \ us.” This month, I’m part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itch.io/b/2506/queer-games-bundle-2024-with-10-option\"\
  >Queer Games Bundle 2024</a>—a bundle of nearly 500 games, software, and zines from\
  \ 271 queer creators across itch.io. The organizers put it best: this bundle is\
  \ a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing\
  \ way, and help nurture the diverse queer games community.</p>\n      <p>Find me\

  \ Over the last fifteen years, I’ve cycled through a variety of labels—nonbinary\
  \ lesbian, ace lesbian, nonbinary bisexual, trans man, nonbinary trans man, the\
  \ list goes on—but through all of that change, I have had the love and support of\
  \ my partners, my close friends and family, and my community. Queer community is\
  \ vital—in some cases, it is literal lifeblood when bigotry causes institutions\
  \ to abandon us.</p>\n      <p>Love is powerful. Love in a world that tries to shame\
  \ you and hide you away is a protest. And love is a fire that cannot be snuffed\
  \ out.</p>\n      <p>Last year’s Pride blog was one of the first projects I took\
  \ point of here at Paizo, and I’m proud and elated to have continued the tradition\
  \ through our various community and culture blogs full circle back to Pride. Even\
  \ “small” acts of solidarity like this give hope and voice to people who have historically\
  \ been silenced.</p>\n      <p>Keep up with me on the internet: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilananight13\"\

  \ have a sneak peek at one of the items coming in <em>Player Core 2</em>: the Elixir\

  \      <p><strong><em>Elixir of Gender Transformation Item 1+<br></em></strong><strong>Alchemical,\

  \ (manipulate)</p>\n      <p>This clear, bitter liquid can be ingested to change\
  \ certain secondary sex characteristics. Different formulations create different\
  \ changes—for example, one variety might cause the voice to deepen and promote body\
  \ and facial hair growth, while another might cause fat redistribution around the\
  \ hips and the growth of breasts. These changes tend to be accompanied by shifting\
  \ of the fat in the face, sometimes dramatically or sometimes more subtly changing\
  \ the user’s appearance. Changes from this elixir take place gradually over the\
  \ course of months or years, depending on the type.</p>\n      <p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;lesser;&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;1;&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;1\
  \ gp<br>\n        The elixir must be taken every week, and changes occur over the\
  \ course of a year or more.</p>\n      <p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;moderate;&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;3;&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;8\
  \ gp<br>\n        The elixir must be taken once a month, and changes occur over\
