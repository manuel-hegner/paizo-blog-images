  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The creature ripped out\
  \ the man’s throat with its claws, blood spraying across the leaf-littered forest\
  \ floor. Its furry bulk pinned the body to the ground. Lips pulled back from razor-sharp\
  \ teeth as a low, ripsaw growl rumbled deep in the thing’s throat.</p> \n     <p>Leaning\
  \ close, the lupine head sniffed at its victim’s pulsing neck. Then the beast threw\
  \ back its head, spine arching. Its shrill howl split the chill, nighttime air.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” </p> \n     <p>“Archie? Archie, stop!\
  \ Archibol Frigasson the Third!”</p> \n     <p>The creature’s howl stopped abruptly.\
  \ It blinked, looking around in confusion.</p> \n     <p>“Goria... what?” </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Stop. There could be more bandits, you little twit. Calm down.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Archie cleared his throat. “Ah. Of course. My apologies. I quite got carried\
  \ away.”</p> \n     <p>Archibol rose carefully to his feet. He was not particularly\
  \ tall, but his broad shoulders and thick arms gave him a hulking quality. His gray\
  \ fur shone almost white in the light of the full moon. For a moment, he looked\
  \ down on his blood-soaked hands with wonder, then blinked. He crouched and pulled\
  \ at the dead man’s cloak, gathering enough fabric to start meticulously cleaning\
  \ his claws and fur.</p> \n     <p>“Archie? We good?” Goria asked, her voice like\
  \ gravel rolling around in a dry bucket. The blades of her daggers flashed as she\
  \ twirled and pushed them into scabbards at her hips. Although the woman was both\
  \ preternaturally quick and strong, she looked neither. Long, stitched scars zig-zagged\
  \ everywhere across her flabby skin. It was as if someone had patched Goria together\
  \ from dozens of long-dead, mismatched bodies. </p> \n     <p>Which, of course,\
  \ is precisely what Archibol’s mad father had done, years before he had turned to\
  \ polymorph experiments upon his only son. The two oddities had clung to each other\
  \ ever since their escape.</p> \n     <p>“Of course, big sister, of course. Heh.\
  \ Nothing to fear. Merely lost in the moment.”</p> \n     <p>Goria watched him with\
  \ a milky, unblinking stare. An awkward moment of silence passed.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ wolf-man cleared his throat again. “Right. Everyone accounted for, then? Where’\
  s our lovely oracle?”</p> \n     <p>“I’m here, Archibol!”</p> \n     <p>He could\
  \ smell her before she emerged from the shadows, the scent of an open grave. Normally,\
  \ Ashka Midnighter was a young, doe-eyed kayal—a shadow person—her pale skin and\
  \ white hair seeming as if all color had drained from her and giving her an exotic\
  \ beauty. Now, however, her cheeks were sunken, her perfect smooth skin marred by\
  \ rot. She still moved gracefully, though, skipping gleefully through branches and\
  \ leaves and hardly making a sound.</p> \n     <p>“Ah, splendid. I say, Ashka. Do\
  \ these oracular powers of yours hurt you when they desiccate your body so?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Her cracked lips split into a wide grin. “Of course not! Oh, I feel\
  \ a bit tired, but I’m fine. Ready for more adventure!” She hopped on one foot and\
  \ thrust a fist into the air. </p> \n     <p>“Hrmph. As my new ward, my dear, I\
  \ must insist we do some investigation to determine any long-term negative effects\
  \ from putting your body through such an ordeal.”</p> \n     <p>Ashka looked down\
  \ at her exposed, decaying arms with glowing, white eyes. “It’s just the mystery\
  \ of the bones, Archibol. I get glimpses into death, and death reaches back out\
  \ to me. But it’s temporary, silly. Don’t worry.”</p> \n     <p>“Still, data is\
  \ knowledge, eh? I would be comforted with some empiricism behind your changes.\
  \ For now, though,” he grunted as he stood, hands cleaned. “We appear to have more\
  \ pressing concerns.”</p> \n     <p>The three of them looked around the clearing,\
  \ dappled by moonlight. </p> \n     <p>A dozen bodies lay scattered. </p> \n   \
  \  <p>“What a simply preposterous disaster,” Archibol grunted. “Alright, let us\
  \ begin with the facts.”</p> \n     <p>“Blast it, Archie...” Goria growled.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“How long have you known me? We must always begin with the facts.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She rolled her patchwork eyes but did not argue.</p> \n     <p>“Now,”\
  \ he began reciting, as if giving a university lecture, one clawed finger raised.\
  \ “Nobleman Cammack Guthor’s caravan left Caliphas at dusk this evening, headed\
  \ to a remote holiday estate. The nobleman traveled with,” Archibol’s eyes roamed\
  \ the clearing. “Two servants, one carriage driver, and... let’s see, one, no, two\
  \ armed guards. The carriage was led off the road to this clearing, where Guthor\
  \ and his entire party were slain. Their rather impressive store of valuables has\
  \ been gathered in sacks.”</p> \n     <p>Archibol began moving, stepping gingerly\
  \ between corpses.</p> \n     <p>“When we arrived, we found four men and two women\
  \ dressed in matching cloaks and leather armor, all armed, picking through the sacks.\
  \ Each wore a red mask painted with the visage of...” he leaned down and fingered\
  \ one of the wooden masks. Its bulbous nose and leering smile might have been comical\
  \ in a different setting. </p> \n     <p>Ashka appeared silently at his shoulder.\
  \ “Ooo! I know! Devil masks!” she clapped enthusiastically. “Like from a carnival.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Archibol nodded once. “Devils, yes. Some fanciful conceit in pursuit\
  \ of notoriety, I suppose. And calling themselves the Tricksters! As if they were\
  \ some famous band of villains instead of a two-copper band of thugs.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Goria nudged one of the bandits disdainfully with a boot. “Trying to sneak\
  \ wearing red in a forest. Idiots.” </p> \n     <p>Archibol grunted. “Indeed. Alright,\
  \ we have six dead victims, including our Ustalavic nobleman. However, thanks to\
  \ us, we also have six dead Tricksters.” He scratched at his chin, lost for a moment\
  \ in thought. “I say! How long do you suppose it would take to waylay the carriage,\
  \ lead it here, kill everyone, and pick through their belongings?”</p> \n     <p>Goria\
  \ shrugged one shoulder. “Hour?”</p> \n     <p>Archibol looked up to the full moon.\
  \ “And yet it’s before midnight. Blast! The scroll we intercepted correctly identified\
  \ Guthor as the target of the ambush, but why did the Tricksters strike early? We\
  \ should have left one of the bandits alive for questioning.”</p> \n     <p>“Yes,”\
  \ Goria frowned, the stitches on one cheek going taut. She looked at him pointedly.\
  \ “We definitely should have.”</p> \n     <p>Archibol avoided her gaze. “Well, then.\
  \ I propose we begin examining how the Tricksters arrived at the ambush point. Perhaps\
  \ we can track them back to—” </p> \n     <p>Someone nearby groaned.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>No sooner had Archibol’s wolf-like ears flicked at the sound, than he was bounding\
  \ across the clearing to a low bush. Goria followed protectively close behind. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Both pairs of eyes looked down on an older, pale-skinned human man in\
  \ an ornate breastplate, his legs tangled in the bush and the rest sprawled out\
  \ of sight of the clearing. A dented helm lay nearby. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Archibol exclaimed. “We have ourselves a thirteenth! One of Guthor’s guardsmen,\
  \ it seems. My dear fellow, it looks as if you’ve taken quite a blow to the head.\
  \ Please allow me to help you up. We have a number of questions as we pursue those\
  \ who waylaid you.”</p> \n     <p>The man groaned again and rolled onto his back.\
  \ He blinked once, twice.</p> \n     <p>“Yeaargh!” the man squealed. “Werewolf!”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Ah,” Archibol chuckled. “Honest mistake. Actually, you see, I am—\
  ”</p> \n     <p>The guard’s wild eyes swiveled to Goria. “M-monster!”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“Now listen here, good fellow. That’s hardly fair,” Archibol frowned. “I believe\

  \ approached. The man yelped, “Zombie!” before fainting dead away.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Bother,” Archibol sighed. “Not again.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
