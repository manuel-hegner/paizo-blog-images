  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">November's adventures fit two of the toughest\
  \ kinds of scenario to write. The first is the load-bearing adventure, one whose\
  \ contribution to the campaign's ongoing plotline is so central that it must work\
  \ properly. The second is the Tier 1-2 evergreen scenario, which far and away sees\
  \ the most play of any adventure during that season of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. I know that from replay alone, the latter\
  \ needs to be especially clean, effective, and fun because so many people will see\
  \ it—often again and again while taking characters from 1st to 2nd level. These\
  \ needed some especially capable authors.</p> \n    <p>It's especially fitting because\
  \ of the recent American Thanksgiving holiday that I give thanks for the consistently\
  \ excellent <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> finalists who have contributed\
  \ to the <a href=\"/products/btpy93m0\"><em>Destiny of the Sands</em></a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9am4\"><em>Scions of the Sky Key</em></a>, and the upcoming <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9huv\"><em>Faithless and Forgotten</em></a> series. I am consistently\
  \ impressed with the quality of their turnovers, and it's telling that their names\
  \ continue to appear in recent Pathfinder products. There were two authors that\
  \ quickly came to mind for these two tough projects: Mikko Kallio and Mike Kimmel,\
  \ finalists in <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> 2014 (the third finalist\
  \ Robert Brookes handled <a href=\"/products/btpy9gwx\">one of the adventures last\
  \ month</a> and recently concluded a Kickstarter for <a href=\"http://www.aetherarpg.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">a new campaign setting</a>).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9hgx\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-10: The Consortium\
  \ Compact</em></a> by Mike Kimmel, the organized play campaign publishes its third\
  \ evergreen Tier 1-2 scenario since the First Steps series. In <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li7w\"\
  >a recent blog</a>, assistant developer Linda Zayas-Palmer provides an initial preview\
  \ and explains what makes an evergreen scenario. This week I'd like to introduce\
  \ you to Magali Delroya, an informant with growing sympathies toward the Pathfinder\
  \ Society. Look forward to meeting her for this assignment in Diobel, on the western\
  \ coast of the Isle of Kortos. Get your new characters ready to stick it to the\
  \ Aspis Consortium!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0711E-VCRoderus.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p>Mikko Kallio had the tricky task of picking up the ongoing Scarab Sages\
  \ metaplot and continuing a story that goes back several seasons. <a href=\"/products/btpy9hgy\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-11: Ancients' Anguish</em></a> is (to the amusement\
  \ of many) a Tier 7-11 adventure that begins in Katapesh with Venture-Captain Roderus\
  \ and takes us to the desert of northern Nex, where a member of the Jeweled Sages\
  \ fled millennia ago. Recent divinations have picked up his trail, and the PCs brave\
  \ the stinging sands to uncover secrets from a rarely explored time period in a\
  \ rarely explored region. This is a story that I've had rolling around in my head\
  \ since we first introduced the sage jewels, and I'd hate to spoil the surprise\
  \ by saying much more. I am really happy with how this adventure turned out, and\
  \ Mikko not only respected the outline but also breathed some great flavor into\
  \ the adventure. To preview just one of those additional elements, take a look at\
  \ The Dark Iris.</p> \n    <p>As the end of the calendar year approaches, I'm spending\
  \ more and more time outlining and assigning scenarios for Spring 2016 and beyond—\
  including several really fun special events. I can hardly wait to share what's coming\
  \ up.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
