  \ Wicked</h1> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ September 21, 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>We're starting a new\
  \ monthly-ish Pathfinder Adventure Card Game series on the blog. Homebrew Special\
  \ will feature the finest in Pathfinder Adventure Card Game homebrew creations (often\
  \ made using the <a href=\" https://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">DriveThru Card Creator</a>), written by the homebrewers themselves.\
  \ If you have a homebrew creation that you'd like to spotlight, let us know!</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>My name is Francesco Silvestri; on the forums, you may know me as Doppelschwert.\
  \ Before I tell you a bit about a recent PACG homebrew project of mine, I'll tell\
  \ you a little bit about my gaming interests. When I'm playing a roleplaying game,\
  \ there are two narrative elements that I really enjoy:</p> \n    <p>The first element\
  \ is a setting where the stakes are high. It's a bit clichéd to be the chosen one\
  \ all the time, I give you that, but while everyone can save a kitten or two from\
  \ a tree or slay some rats in a cellar, few heroes are able to pull off such astonishing\
  \ feats that you might call them <i>mythic</i>. As such, I immediately fell in love\
  \ with the Wrath of the Righteous set when I got it last summer.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ second element is the inclusion of antiheroes. Don't get me wrong: I like to play\
  \ as Hero McRighteousface just as much as the next guy, but there is a special itch\
  \ that I can only scratch when the bad guys are doing the right thing for the wrong\
  \ reasons. In PACG, folks like Wrathack and Darago immediately come to mind as fitting\
  \ this role nicely.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh_180.jpeg\"></a> <a\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Epic adversaries—check. Pragmatic protagonists—check.</i></p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>So I wanted to make a homebrew PACG Adventure Path that combines\
  \ these things, with a focus on the bad guys being able to live up to their morally\
  \ grey standards. I proudly present the variant AP for Wrath of the Righteous that\
  \ I've been working on: Revenge of the Wicked, or RotW for short, is my personal\
  \ antithesis to WotR (see what I did there?).</p> \n    <p>You start RotW as a bunch\
  \ of shady characters of your choosing, and it doesn't take long for you to meet\
  \ the wrong people at the (seemingly) right time. One thing leads to another, and\
  \ before you know it, you've signed up with the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth\
  \ and are eager to become demoniacs—cultists of demon lords with the goal of turning\
  \ themselves partially into demons, just like their RPG counterparts from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8hij?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Book-of-the-Damned-Volume-2-Lords-of-Chaos\"\
  ><em>Lords of Chaos</em></a>. Of course, you'll eventually achieve this goal—the\
  \ end justifies the means, after all, and who's going to stop you?—but more on that\
  \ later.</p> \n    <p>This 33-scenario tale chronicles your rise to power that takes\
  \ you all over the Worldwound, the Abyss, and even into the Darklands! Along the\
  \ way, there are plenty of opportunities to live up to your bad reputation. And\
  \ while the forces of good will eventually try to stop you from doing exactly that,\
  \ there are some familiar faces to help you out as well.</p> \n    <p>I won't tell\
  \ you any more of the story, so you can go into it unspoiled. But who knows: you\
  \ might just end up doing the right thing in the end!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Your mount might have something to do with your cover being blown...</i></p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Let's talk a bit about what RotW has to offer in terms of game\
  \ mechanics. As you can see, there are custom cards—25 in total. Most are villains,\
  \ henchmen, and support cards, but there are also some boons to replace thematically\
  \ unfitting cards, as well as new barriers to replace some of the more infamous\
  \ barriers of WotR.</p> \n    <p>Thanks to Ludwig Orsingher, better known as user\
  \ LudwigO on the paizo forums, I'll be able to replace the current RotW cards with\
  \ the awesome preview pictures you can see on this blog for my next update, and\
  \ I am really grateful for all the work he put into making RotW a much prettier\
  \ experience for everyone.</p> \n    <p>While optional, you are also encouraged\
  \ to shuffle the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1\"\
  ><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-2\"\
  ><em>Deck 2</em></a> into the box. Not only will that enrich the atmosphere dramatically,\
  \ but it will also give you access to some pretty rad evil characters to play. You'll\
  \ hardly find a better place to let them loose on whoever dares to get in their\
  \ way!</p> \n    <p>You might be wondering what I've done with all the support cards\
  \ from WotR: mythic paths, cohorts, servitor demons, and the redemption table. In\
  \ RotW, almost all of those cards are either unused or replaced with new variants.\
  \ Since you play a bunch of cultists, you don't get a mythic power source or a redemption\
  \ table; instead, you become demoniacs and receive access to the patron table, which\
  \ memorializes the demon lords you've served well in the past!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Who needs redemption when you can summon a bunch of servants\
  \ to do the dirty work for you?</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Remember that annoying\
  \ Blackfire Cultist that always summoned those pesky servitor demons to get in your\
  \ way in WotR? I have good news for you: she won't be around this time... and you\
  \ get to summon those demons yourselves instead, thanks to the conjuration mechanic.\
  \ Basically, it works like Summon Monster, but you get to choose a monster from\
  \ the Conjuration table according to your number of mythic charges (while servants\
  \ that have the Undead trait get an additional 1d6).</p> \n    <p>While you lose\
  \ access to the constant bonus to skills and those shiny d20s from the original\
  \ mythic paths, you can instead spend mythic charges to help with any skill, and\
  \ you can utilize Corrupted cards to use and generate those charges. As a result,\
  \ the AP feels quite different from WotR. There might just be even more mythic paths\
  \ to unlock further into the AP (just don't tell the demon lords I told you that).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, the servitor demons are demons no more—righteous heroes have\
  \ arrived to thwart your plans instead, and they offer some interesting abilities\
  \ that interact with the new mythic path.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
