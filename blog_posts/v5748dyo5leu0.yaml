  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Ed Greenwood</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: In the House\
  \ of Blades</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"I do not waste time\
  \ dealing with slaves,\" the citizen in the splendid red doublet informed her. \"\
  Go and fetch your master. Now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Come back tomorrow,\" the halfling\
  \ said flatly, her eyes two flames of fury. She stood on the shop counter facing\
  \ him, chin thrust forward and hands on hips, as if she owned the place.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Which she didn't, of course. She was indeed a slave—and a halfling of shorter\
  \ stature than most halflings, to boot.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >The citizen looked down his nose at her, dubiously. It was unusual in splendid\
  \ and sprawling Canorate to see a slave openly armed, but this one had daggers that\
  \ looked like they'd serve her as swords strapped to her arms and legs.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yet this was Hroalund's House of Blades, a shop that sold knives and\
  \ daggers. The problem was, this arrogant little above-herself slave looked ready,\
  \ willing, and one angrily spitting moment away from using them.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Yes,\" she hissed, as if reading his mind, her hands suddenly stroking dagger-pommels.\
  \ \"I hit what I throw these at. Every time.\" Her voice became a menacing purr.\
  \ \"Would <i>sir</i> care for a demonstration?\"</p> \n    <p>The citizen opened\
  \ his mouth to say something sneering and dismissive—and then thought better of\
  \ it. \"Tomorrow, then!\" he snapped, then spun on one magnificently booted heel\
  \ and stormed out.</p> \n    <p>Through the shop window, Tantaerra Loroeva Klazra\
  \ watched the embroidered tail of the citizen's fine cloak swirl in his wake, and\
  \ sighed.</p> \n    <p>The Master steps out on business for the afternoon, and half\
  \ of Canorate comes in here to try to bully the shop slave into giving them things\
  \ for a quarter their worth—and a sixth of the asked price. It was hardly surprising—\
  she was, after all, an outlander and a little <i>child</i> of a creature, no doubt\
  \ untutored and naïve.</p> \n    <p><i>Pah</i>. Molthuni were such aggressively\
  \ arrogant <i>idiots</i>.</p> \n    <p>That went double for rich Canorate citizens\
  \ out adventuring beyond the walls of the gilded Sweet Orchard district, to where\
  \ the lungs of Canorate breathed, the real daily business of Molthune was done,\
  \ and shops that sold <i>useful</i> things crowded together along busy streets.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tantaerra plucked one of the mirror-bright sample knives from an upright\
  \ fan display of them atop the polished countertop, buffed it on her sleeve, then\
  \ turned her back on the now-empty shop and strode right off the countertop, tossing\
  \ the knife casually back over her shoulder as she started to fall.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/Tantaerra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/Tantaerra_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\
  \ \n     <br>Those who judge Tantaerra based on her size are fools indeed.\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>It <i>thunked</i> into the target even before her feet sank into\
  \ the heap of soft mats the Master had accumulated behind the counter as his gout\
  \ steadily worsened.</p> \n    <p>She did not have to look to know she'd struck\
  \ the target dead center. She was, after all, better at demonstrating the throwing\
  \ knives Argulk Hroalund was deservedly famous for than the Master was himself.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The shop guards watched her pad across the shop and leap up to retrieve\
  \ the blade, their faces as impassive as ever, but when she sighed loudly and told\
  \ the ceiling, \"If <i>one</i> more overblown scion of Canorate's elite comes in\
  \ here before we close...\" she saw the ghost of a smile pluck at the lips of one\
  \ of them, just for an instant.</p> \n    <p>As if her lament had been a cue, the\
  \ singing clash of crossing swords rang out, courtesy of the enchantment on the\
  \ shop door. Well, it was better than those annoying bells any day.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra\
  \ swallowed a sigh, fixed a professional smile on her face, and sprang atop the\
  \ stool behind the counter once more. After all, if the Master didn't eat, neither\
  \ would she, and Canorate wasn't the cheapest of places to—</p> \n    <p>Her smile\
  \ became genuine. It was the Master.</p> \n    <p>Yet the grin faded as quickly\
  \ as it came, and she found herself struggling to get the professional smile back\
  \ into place. The Master was worried.</p> \n    <p>And it took a lot to worry Argulk\
  \ Hroalund.</p> \n    <p>He was the best maker of throwing knives in five lands,\
  \ probably more, and offered the best stock of knives of all sorts—from tiny hide-in-your-hair\
  \ ladies' death-needles to joint-an-aurochs cleavers—in Molthune. And had been for\
  \ fifty years, perhaps sixty. Which meant he'd dealt with a <i>lot</i> of Molthuni.\
  \ And anyone who sold arms and armor had to be ready to defend themselves, as well\
  \ as tough as mountain stone against intimidation, or...</p> \n    <p>\"Braerand,\
  \ Luthkul, Orrlehm—have my thanks; this day's shift is done. Be off home with you.\
  \ The House is closing until the day after tomorrow. So tomorrow is yours, though\
  \ I'll pay you for it as if you were here.\"</p> \n    <p>The guards were surprised,\
  \ yet said not a word. They merely nodded and went.</p> \n    <p>As the Master shot\
  \ the bolts in their wake and reached to swing the metal doorbar down into place,\
  \ Tantaerra set the first trap, but he turned with a frown and held up a hand to\
  \ stop her.</p> \n    <p>Surprised, Tantaerra stood on the counter and watched him\
  \ shuffle back to her from the door and begin the routine of setting all the traps\
  \ himself.</p> \n    <p>He <i>was</i> worried.</p> \n    <p>Most shops had traps\
  \ against thieves, but the Master's were the best. Oh, a knife shop's traps almost\
  \ had to be, but even the Orchard-dwellers in Canorate hired Argulk Hroalund to\
  \ trap their homes.</p> \n    <p>He designed the most elaborate and best hidden\
  \ mechanical traps, from half a dozen for a small shop to scores of silently waiting\
  \ deadlinesses in a grand mansion; elaborate mechanical traps that could wound intruders\
  \ with \"knives or darts, launched or thrust.\" Tantaerra knew the Master's skill\
  \ well; because she was deft, supple, and small even for a halfling, she was often\
  \ set to work installing his creations in spaces too cramped for the Master himself.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The knives were the daily soup and cheese of the House of Blades, but\
  \ the trapping was big coin.</p> \n    <p>\"Anything I should know?\" he growled\
  \ at her as usual, as he checked the day's takings. Not too worried to entirely\
  \ abandon routine.</p> \n    <p>\"Two odd deliveries, both crates. The smaller from\
  \ Garldrake and Sarpent, the larger from no one who wants to share his name, and\
  \ who ships in crates that could double as coffins; it's labeled ‘To Be Opened By\
  \ Master Hroalund Only.' So I left it. I opened the other, though. Forty-six gorgets,\
  \ steel, all the same size—and utter slop. I bent some accidentally, between two\
  \ fingers, lifting them out. You <i>can't</i> sell them. You're being insulted.\
  \ Or set up for a fall, somehow.\"</p> \n    <p>The Master frowned and then sighed.\
  \ He looked old and tired—but not surprised. \"You left them in the back?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>At Tantaerra's nod, he set off for his private rooms, pinching the lamps\
  \ dark as he went. Tantaerra scampered after him. His abrupt and early closing meant\
  \ she hadn't even warmed the water atop the little stove, but she could rub oil\
  \ into his gouty feet while supper was cooking, rather than after...</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I'd like that,\" the Master grunted, and she froze. She must have said her thoughts\
  \ aloud.</p> \n    <p>Then he turned and proved again why he was the best Master\
  \ any slave could have. \"And we'll talk. My worries are bothering you, and I need\
  \ someone to talk to. I trust you, Little Firebrand. You've more sense than any\
  \ twenty Canorate shopkeepers—or any forty Sweet Orchard highcloaks—put together.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Flatterer,\" she told him affectionately. \"See if you can be as\
  \ complimentary about my supper—and I'll try not to burn it.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra's stomach was both full and warm; she was\
  \ finally getting the hang of hot savory pies. The Master belched and smiled, several\
  \ times each, then stopped smiling and told her, \"It seems Garldrake and Sarpent\
  \ may turn out to be difficult trading partners. At best.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh? Share?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Nothing to share but suspicions. Yet. Let's be looking at the larger\
  \ crate.\"</p> \n    <p>A few shuffling moments later and they were standing over\
  \ it, eyeing the crate that looked very like a coffin.</p> \n    <p><i>To Be Opened\
  \ By Master Hroalund Only</i>. That boldly lettered label was imperious enough.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Master looked at her.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra sighed. \"You want me\
  \ to open it, don't you?\"</p> \n    <p>Hroalund nodded, looking a little ashamed\
  \ and a little sad.</p> \n    <p>\"Not here,\" she said crisply. \"In the cellar.\
  \ Back corner, next to the big stack.\"</p> \n    <p>The big stack was the one fixture\
  \ in the cellar of the House of Blades. Hroalund's only deadwood; a six-crate-high\
  \ tower almost brushing the ceiling beams. Bigger crates than most carters made\
  \ these days, full of shields silently rusting away—shields the Master would never\
  \ be able to unload, now that Molthune's armies used a new design. Not without scouring\
  \ clean and reshaping every last one, and they just weren't worth the time and expense.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Master nodded and went for his cart.</p> \n    <p>One of Tantaerra's\
  \ tasks was keeping its side-ramp well greased, and she did tasks thoroughly. The\
  \ Master only grunted twice as he shoved the coffin-crate up onto the cart; its\
  \ journey was swift and easy.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra had improved the winch on the\
  \ pulley-lift so it rarely creaked, and gave off sighs rather than its former high,\
  \ raw groans. A few pumps of the handle and cart and burden were down in the cellar.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Master wheeled the cart to right beside the stack of crates and gave\
  \ his slave a questioning look.</p> \n    <p>She nodded, and he stepped back. She\
  \ pointed at the handle of the cart.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah,\" he said, after a moment.\
  \ \"Take the cart away. Good thinking.\"</p> \n    <p>He did that, then stopped\
  \ halfway across the cellar to watch. Tantaerra gave him an exasperated look, then\
  \ used the prybar she'd fetched down with her to point at the ceiling, then at him,\
  \ then at the ceiling again. Imperiously.</p> \n    <p>Hroalund nodded reluctantly\
  \ and set off up the stairs. She made sure he wasn't halting to turn and come back\
  \ down before she hastily downed breeches and emptied her bladder all over the polishing-rag\
  \ she'd brought with her.</p> \n    <p>She tied the damp result over her nose. A\
  \ feeble defense against poison gas, but better than nothing. She was still tightening\
  \ its knot behind her ears when the Master reappeared. He had a long length of cord\
  \ in his hands.</p> \n    <p>\"What're you—?\"</p> \n    <p>He tied it securely\
  \ around her waist. \"In case I need to drag you to safety.\"</p> \n    <p>He'd\
  \ brought the long reaching-pole from the shop with him, and used its jaws to thrust\
  \ the free end of the rope up through the open pulley-lift hatch in the ceiling.\
  \ When he started for the stairs again, Tantaerra caught hold of the reaching-pole.\
  \ \"Leave it.\"</p> \n    <p>The Master looked surprised, but relinquished it readily\
  \ enough.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra positioned it against the wall behind the stack\
  \ of crates. When she returned from behind them, Hroalund was upstairs and peering\
  \ down at her through the hatch, the cord tied to her waist hanging from it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She waved cheerily and set to work with her prybar.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ nails were few but secure. Tantaerra hauled and heaved, and it went swiftly enough;\
  \ this was work she did every day. As she finished one side and started around the\
  \ end of the crate—it <i>did</i> look like a coffin, to be sure—she caught sight\
  \ of her master watching her. He looked anxious.</p> \n    <p>When every nail was\
  \ out, she levered the lid up and hauled it back, keeping behind it as if it was\
  \ a shield.</p> \n    <p>Silence. Stillness.</p> \n    <p>And then, as she'd expected,\
  \ something erupted up out of the crate with a clatter and clang of ringing steel.\
  \ The Master shouted in alarm.</p> \n    <p>The thing emerging looked like a man's\
  \ skeleton sheathed in a metal cage-work—if, that is, human skeletons came with\
  \ eight arms, each of them ending in wicked-looking sword blades.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ stepped out of the box and toward her, blades reaching...</p> \n    <p align=\"\
