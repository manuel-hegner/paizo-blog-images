  \ and all! My name is Jay Loomis, and I'm one of the new editorial interns here\
  \ at Paizo HQ. I share a desk with Cassidy, whom you have already met (though I\
  \ haven't, due to a temporal displacement in our schedules).</span></p> \n    <p>I'm\
  \ a graduate student at the University of Washington, Bothell in the Master of Fine\
  \ Arts in Creative Writing and Poetics program. My path to grad school was long\
  \ and winding, and involved a ton of professional experience in technical and expository\
  \ writing, management and team dynamics, desktop publishing and a smidgeon of graphic\
  \ design, among many other areas. That's a roundabout way of saying that I'm kind\
  \ of old for an intern. I look forward to bringing my experience to bear as I learn\
  \ more about the world of RPG publishing. </p> \n    <p>Coming to Paizo is one step\
  \ in the fulfillment of a dream to make RPGs that started when I was 10. That was\
  \ a long time ago (here's a hint: that was the year that I got Star Frontiers, Marvel\
  \ Superheroes [the original in the yellow box], and The Adventures of Indiana Jones\
  \ Role-Playing Game, all published by TSR) so it feels really good. My interest\
  \ in design hasn't lain dormant in the intervening years. I'm always designing games\
  \ of one sort or another. I have accumulated a lot of theory, and have helped my\
  \ peers learn about designing games as the president of the Game Design Club at\
  \ school. Last year I was fortunate enough to be the editor of the critically acclaimed\
  \ Dungeon World, published by Sage Kobold designs.</p> \n    <p>In the rare moments\
  \ that I am not playing or talking about roleplaying games or doing homework (or\
  \ playing or talking about other tabletop games) I enjoy blacksmithing, stage combat\
  \ and European martial arts (swords!). I like making things with my hands and (when\
  \ time allows) walking in nature and relaxing at home with my wife and two cats.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I can't wait to dive deeper into the inner workings of Pathfinder and\
  \ to tell you about it here on the blog!</p> \n    <p>Jay Loomis<br> <i>Editorial\
  \ Intern</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Paizo, Interns --> \n\
