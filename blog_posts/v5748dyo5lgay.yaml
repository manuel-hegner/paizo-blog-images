  \ Iconics: Kess</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 17, 2014</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">She was raised\
  \ to be Lady Kessilandrie Anicia Vlastos, but the thousands of cheering fans that\
  \ fill the arena's seats when she fights shout her preferred name—Kess the Bull.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Kess never squared herself with the life of pomp and nobility. As a kid\
  \ growing up in an estate in the Westpark District of Oppara, she spent her time\
  \ in opulent gardens, tipping over rocks to look for bugs, climbing the massive\
  \ oaks, coordinating mock battles against imaginary monsters with her sisters and\
  \ brothers in the plum orchard, and generally getting into trouble.</p> \n    <div\

  \ by Wayne Reynolds\n    </div> \n    <p>It was during these pretend adventures\
  \ that she started learning how to fight. Her brothers and sisters were snobbish,\
  \ bullying brats that never left the awkward young girl alone. Never one to just\
  \ take abuse, Kess ended many of those make-believe bouts in flat-out fistfights.\
  \ It wasn't the wooden swords and staves the kids played with that she mastered\
  \ in these brawls, but rather a solid left jab, a well-placed kick, or a leg sweep.\
  \ Her height gave her good reach, letting her even get in a good strike at her oldest\
  \ brother to silence his bullying.</p> \n    <p>After too many busted lips and bloody\
  \ noses, Kess's parents tried to send her to dueling masters in order to teach her\
  \ the art of swordplay, hoping to channel her energy into a safe and respectable\
  \ form of combat—something of which nobles could be proud.</p> \n    <p>As far as\
  \ Kess was concerned, fencing was for dandies and duels were just tiresome ego dramas.\
  \ This affluent instruction just didn't stick. After losing too many matches by\
  \ dropping her training rapier and socking her opponent in the jaw, she was nearly\
  \ expelled. An older student, sympathetic to her fighting style, tipped her off\
  \ to an underground fighting ring in a seedy part of the city.</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ first night in the pit was exhilarating. The organizers paired her up with a brawny\
  \ farm boy whose jaw jutted out as far as his forehead sloped back. He hit hard,\
  \ but he didn't know a thing about technique. Using her skill and rangy frame to\
  \ her advantage, Kess had him mewling on the ground in less than a minute.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Using the ruse of attending fencing class, Kess made her way to the underground\
  \ rings every chance she could get. It was there that she discovered real honor—\
  not that bogus social contract she grew up under. In those pit fights, she learned\
  \ focus and found her calling. The roar of the crowd charged her, and she pushed\
  \ her body, testing herself.</p> \n    <p>Kess learned a multitude of styles and\
  \ forms from the various fighters and promoters that flowed through the ring, as\
  \ well as the worship of Kurgess, god of bravery, competition, and sports. She also\
  \ began to dream of bouts in the far-off nations from which many of her colleagues\
  \ hailed. In particular, she focused on the gladiator nation of Tymon in the River\
  \ Kingdoms, from which her coach had won a medal.</p> \n    <p>Yet everything came\
  \ apart the night her older brother—eager to gamble on the fights—stumbled into\
  \ the secret venue and noticed her in the ring. Her father was furious, and her\
  \ mother worried. This was no way for a proper, highborn lady to act. What if she\
  \ were hurt or killed? What would happen if other families were to find out? Which\
  \ of them already knew?</p> \n    <p>For her own safety—and to quash a scandal—\
  her parents threatened to send her off to their country estate, or even to a boarding\
  \ school. In no way eager to have her destiny decided for her by others, Kess beat\
  \ her parents to the punch and snuck down to the docks, boarding a Taldan merchant\
  \ vessel headed up the Sellen River. With her wits, her skill, and a purse bulging\
  \ with her winnings in the ring, she set off for Tymon. Once there, she fought enough\
  \ bouts in the arena to get noticed by the masters of the Valknar Gladiatorial College,\
  \ using the prize money from her Opparan fights to pay for tuition.</p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ Tymon is small, and Kess easily bored. While still one win shy of being considered\
  \ “bloodied,” she was lured away from the city by the call of new arenas in distant\
  \ locations, taking up the life of an adventurer not for treasure, but for the fun\
  \ of it. Every so often, Kess attempts to alleviate some of her mother's worry by\
  \ sending letters home telling of her adventures, yet has learned to obscure where\
  \ they're sent from, lest her father send agents to track her down and try to bring\
  \ her home.</p> \n    <p>Kess wears her bruises and scars as proudly as she wears\
  \ the medals adorning her outfit—prizes from various fights, as well as a short\
  \ stint with a mercenary company. Even though she tries to be positive and upbeat,\
  \ she knows that she's often aggressive and sarcastic. Kess isn't afraid to say\
  \ what's on her mind, especially when facing authorities who try to tell others\
  \ what to do. She doesn't pay much mind to complicated bureaucracies and outdated\
  \ social mores, and tends to live her life the way she wants. The only time Kess\
  \ shows a strong respect for rules is during a competition—she doesn't tolerate\
  \ cheaters. Kess is competitive, though she encourages others in their own tasks.\
  \ She keeps her body fit, and trains every chance she gets—a crucial counterbalance\
  \ to her love of good food, strong drink, and long nights of celebration after a\
  \ fight.</p> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
