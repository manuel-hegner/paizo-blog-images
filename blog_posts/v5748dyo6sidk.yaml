  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we’re ecstatic to\
  \ officially announce that Starfinder Second Edition is happening. Back in 2017\
  \ we released Starfinder, a new game system and setting to stand alongside Paizo’\
  s tried and true Pathfinder brand. Today we’re revealing the next evolution in Starfinder\
  \ as we announce its second edition and lay out our plans for the future.</p> \n\
  \     <p>This new edition of Starfinder is being designed to be fully compatible\
  \ with the upcoming release of the Pathfinder Remastered rulebooks and all future\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition products. This means that all your Pathfinder content\
  \ going forward will be compatible with the new edition of Starfinder, and that\
  \ all Starfinder Second Edition content will work in Pathfinder—with your GM’s permission,\
  \ of course!</p> \n     <p>We’ll be releasing a full playtest in Summer 2024, but\
  \ we wanted to announce the new edition early because it’s our intent to make Starfinder’\
  s playtest the most open playtest Paizo has released to date.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ all starts today with the release of our first <em>Starfinder</em> <em>Field Test</em>.\
  \ These documents are a little different than the playtest files we’ve released\
  \ in the past. Each Field Test is a snippet of ongoing design work drafted by the\
  \ Starfinder team and is intended to show what we’re working on and some of the\
  \ directions we’re exploring. Our first document focuses on the first five levels\
  \ of one of our new base classes: the soldier. Along with this, we’ve included some\
  \ rules for futuristic weaponry and a couple of creatures for you to toss into your\
  \ games.</p> \n     <p>Unlike other playtests, the Field Test documents will not\
  \ be accompanied by a feedback survey, as they are intended to be behind-the-scenes\
  \ looks at what is coming. Look forward to August 2024, when the full playtest launches\
  \ for your feedback!</p> \n     <p>Along with the first Field Test, we also wanted\
  \ to announce the first four classes to be included in the upcoming <em>Starfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em>.</p> \n     <p>The mystic is a spellcasting class that\
  \ focuses on the divine and primal traditions and has the unique ability to form\
  \ a bond with their closest allies. Using their bond to impart a variety of bonuses\
  \ on their allies, the mystic can also heal them through their shared bond. Once\
  \ represented by Keskodai, our iconic shirren, a new iconic has taken on the role\
  \ of the mystic. Chk Chk grew up in his father’s larval container, witnessing all\
  \ manner of traumatizing adventures in his childhood. Now an adult, Chk Chk has\
  \ become a devout worshipper of the amalgamate deity, Zon-Shelyn, and believes in\
  \ channeling suffering into artistic expression.</p> \n     <p>The soldier gets\
  \ its first preview in today’s Field Test and specializes in taking hits and unloading\
  \ with area of effect weapons. With different fighting styles at their disposal,\
  \ soldiers can focus on different areas of importance, like defense, ranged offense,\
  \ or even a bit of melee effectiveness. The iconic vesk soldier, Obozaya, returns\
  \ in all her glory. While she hasn’t turned over her doshko blades yet, age and\
  \ battle scars have forced Obo to turn her attention to heavy weapons and contributing\
  \ to the fight in a new way—but don’t worry, she still beats things up in melee!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Along with these two classes, we are also announcing the envoy and the\
  \ solarian. These classes are still undergoing some internal testing, so we’re going\
  \ to hold off on saying too much about them for now. What we will say is that the\
  \ iconic envoy, Navasi, is returning with many years of adventuring behind her.\
  \ Along with Navasi, we also have a new solarian iconic whose art we’re revealing;\
  \ we’ll be keeping the remaining details under wraps for the time being. Canny viewers\
  \ should notice that the art for this iconic is an ancestry that wasn’t in the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em>. That’s because the feline pahtra species are now a core ancestry\
  \ in Starfinder Second Edition!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
