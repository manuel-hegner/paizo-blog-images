  \ E. Vardeman</p> \n  <h2>Chapter One: Smoke on the Horizon</h2> \n  <blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>It took several minutes for the cougar's ululating screech to make Rorr\
  \ look up from his autumn plowing. The day was unseasonably warm for Neth, and sweat\
  \ trickled down his back. He knew the heat was an illusion—cutting through the dried\
  \ brown chaff remaining in his field and plowing it under for spring fertilizer\
  \ had to be completed soon, before snow buried the land. Already at night the wind\
  \ off the distant Lake of Mists and Veils cut through even a well-padded jacket\
  \ and brought tears to unprotected eyes. Soon enough a heavy doublet would be necessary\
  \ when venturing outside the comforting warmth of his small farmhouse.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>If he didn't complete the turning of the soil to provide composting, the thin,\
  \ rocky dirt would be worthless in Pharast and he would be forced to grow a cover\
  \ crop—perhaps oats—and let a valuable portion of his farm lie fallow if he wanted\
  \ cash crops another year. Rorr cursed himself for not undersowing, but too much\
  \ repair work had to be done on the barn to attend to every detail. After two of\
  \ his plow horses died of the wasting disease, there had scarcely been time to plow\
  \ the more productive of his two large fields. Even working his two stepsons until\
  \ they moaned, he hadn't accomplished enough.</p> \n   <p>He dragged his arm over\
  \ his forehead to mop sweat, then wanted to clap his hands over his battered ears—\
  or what remained of them. The cougar refused to be quiet. Rorr stretched to his\
  \ full height, but that was not enough by half to reveal the big cat that stayed\
  \ just beyond his sight at the edge of the woods.</p> \n   <p>He walked around his\
  \ remaining plow horse and patted the thick neck, noting how the coat had grown\
  \ matted and tangled. He'd have to curry the burrs out of the mane—or better yet,\
  \ have Fren or Rayallan do it. If either of his boys had shown any sign of slacking,\
  \ he would have demanded the chore of them immediately, but both worked sunup to\
  \ sundown, as he did.</p> \n   <p>It was going to be a cold winter.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ cougar's scream brought him around, all worry of the coming ice and frigid wind\
  \ forgotten.</p> \n   <p>Grumbling, he unhitched the horse and vaulted easily onto\
  \ its back. His bowed legs fit perfectly around the horse's bulging flanks. At least\
  \ one creature on his farm ate well, and why not? With its two companions dead,\
  \ there was no reason to withhold the horse's fodder.</p> \n   <p>\"You are our\
  \ salvation,\" he said, bending low and whispering in the horse's ear. The large\
  \ ear flicked as if a fly had buzzed near. The horse turned a huge brown eye back\
  \ and stared unblinking at him, as if wondering why he had mounted and didn't insist\
  \ on plowing still more. Half the field remained to be turned under.</p> \n   <p>Rorr\
  \ sat straight and used the added height to cast a sharp eye along the far line\
  \ of trees. One day he would cut those trees and expand the field, but taking out\
  \ stumps was tedious work, better left to days when the crops were growing and all\
  \ the work consisted of plucking bugs off the green leaves and listening to the\
  \ corn groan with the speed of its growth.</p> \n   <p>\"Fren!\" He looked around\
  \ for his older son. At the far side of the field, the youth of fifteen summers\
  \ leaned on the handle of a shovel. Rocks had migrated up during the past summer\
  \ and required removal. \"Fren, do you see it?\"</p> \n   <p>He pointed to the trees\
  \ and past.</p> \n   <p>\"Smoke,\" the boy called back. \"From the direction of\
  \ the Torvan farm.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Come on. We'll ride over to see if there's trouble.\"\
  \ The Torvans were good neighbors, generous with seed and advice to a man who had\
  \ long been away from the earth and growing. Rorr found Ganley Torvan, Thom's wife,\
  \ abrasive—but then, with only one arm, life couldn't be easy for her. Their children\
  \ were younger than even Rayallan's twelve years, and did little that he could see\
  \ to help either their father or mother. Rorr felt blessed by Shelyn for his two\
  \ boys, and for Beeah.</p> \n   <p>Fren ran, kicked hard, and vaulted up to land\
  \ behind his stepfather. Rorr had to reach back and grab to keep the boy from toppling\
  \ off the other side.</p> \n   <p>\"Hang on,\" Rorr said, snapping the reins and\
  \ putting his heels to the horse. It moved at a plow horse pace for a few yards,\
  \ then began to trot at its top speed.</p> \n   <p>\"You're not going to chastise\
  \ me for almost falling off?\" Fren hesitated to hold around Rorr's waist, though\
  \ he did not easily adapt to the uneven gait.</p> \n   <p>\"Some are natural horsemen.\
  \ Others learn. You'll be one of the latter.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Did you have to learn?\"\
  \ Fren asked. \"Or did you race a courser before you married Ma?\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr\
  \ laughed. \"Seldom have I ridden a horse better than this one, and always I was\
  \ glad for it. It takes less time than you might imagine to become footsore.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The boy's hold improved, and Rorr urged the horse to pick up speed. The\
  \ rising smoke was an ominous, greasy black.</p> \n   <p>They found the main road\
  \ and made better time, but Rorr slowed when he came to Torvan's gate. It lay in\
  \ the middle of the double-rutted road, ripped from the post. Several feet of fence\
  \ had been trampled.</p> \n   <p>\"Their cattle will get out,\" Fren said, not understanding\
  \ what he saw.</p> \n   <p>\"You should dismount, boy.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Why, Pa?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Rorr would normally have been pleased at hearing the term from his\
  \ stepson, but just now he had other concerns.</p> \n   <p>\"Do it.\" He swept his\
  \ arm back and slid the boy off the horse's rump. Fren landed hard but kept his\
  \ balance.</p> \n   <p>\"You have no right—!\" the boy began, but Fren was speaking\
  \ to his back. Rorr trotted forward, the quickest gait the plow horse could muster.</p>\

  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The main house was hidden from the road by a stand of\
  \ trees desperately harboring leaves against the encroaching winter, but the instant\
  \ he rode past their screen, heat from the burning house forced him to look away.\
  \ Throwing up his arm to shade his eyes, he turned back toward the inferno. The\
  \ building was already consumed—if anyone had been inside, they had found their\
  \ own funeral pyre.</p> \n   <p>Riding a safe distance from the house, he circle\
  \ around to the barn. A coldness settled in his belly when he saw the pigs and chickens\
  \ slaughtered on the ground. Insects crawled up to feast, and carrion birds had\
  \ already plucked delicate morsels from eye socket and haunch. The smell of death\
  \ was hidden by the acrid smoke billowing from behind.</p> \n   <p>\"Torvan!\" His\
  \ call was swallowed by the crackle and roar of the burning house. These flames\
  \ had not been lit by some carelessly placed oil lamp or spark from a pipe. He called\
  \ again, knowing there would be no reply but still hoping.</p> \n   <p>He slid his\
  \ leg over the horse's neck and hopped lightly to the ground. His bowed legs moved\
  \ with precision and resolve as he quickly looked into the barn. More slaughtered\
  \ animals. He let out a sigh when he saw how cruelly Torvan's plow horse had been\
  \ mutilated. It had been strong and of an age to last a dozen more seasons. A waste.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Cries from behind the barn sent him racing around the two-story building.\
  \ He stopped under a carefully painted hex sign supposed to turn away evil. If anything,\
  \ it had attracted it.</p> \n   <p>Four men astride warhorses worked to light a\
  \ torch, which they clearly intended to toss into the granary. None saw Rorr as\
  \ he moved forward. </p> \n   <p>Torvan wasn't a good farmer, but he had six sons\
  \ and twice the acreage Rorr did. Their harvest had been bountiful, yet these men\
  \ with their leather armor and short, businesslike swords intended to destroy what\
  \ could keep a family of eight alive through the cruel winter.</p> \n   <p>He reached\
  \ the hindmost rider, grabbed and caught leather straps fastening the armor around\
  \ his body. Powerful muscles bunched, and the warrior was lifted from the saddle\
  \ and hurled through the air. The clank of his sword hitting the ground was as loud\
  \ as the snapping of bones—almost.</p> \n   <p>The three remaining warriors turned\
  \ at the unexpected disturbance. For an instant they didn't understand what had\
  \ happened. Rorr stepped close to a second one—the warrior holding the torch—and\
  \ caught his foot as it rested in the stirrup. He twisted viciously and forced the\
  \ rider to the ground.</p> \n   <p>\"We missed a plowboy,\" another warrior said\
  \ sarcastically.</p> \n   <p>\"You set fire to the house. Where's the family that\
  \ lived there?\" Rorr spoke but continued to move with deceptive slowness. He caught\
  \ a third man's wrist as he reached to unsheathe his sword. That one joined his\
  \ two companions on the ground.</p> \n   <p>The one who had spoken backed his horse\
  \ from Rorr and swung a triangular shield about. Rorr didn't recognize the escutcheon,\
  \ but he did know better than to reach for this soldier. The bottom edge of the\
  \ shield had been honed like a razor, and could slice through flesh and bone easily.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Instead of attacking the rider, Rorr swept his leg about in a powerful\
  \ circle and kicked the horse's front leg just above the cannon bone. From the way\
  \ the horse reared, he had both frightened it and delivered great pain. It landed\
  \ heavily on its front legs and bucked, throwing the rider. His shield flew through\
  \ the air like a deadly silver blood kite and skidded in the dirt just shy of the\
  \ granary.</p> \n   <p>\"Where's the Torvan family?\"</p> \n   <p>He grabbed one\
  \ warrior as he struggled to stand and lifted him, fingers sliding expertly under\
  \ his gorget to dig into his throat. He repeated the question but received only\
  \ gurgles. Blood began trickling from the side of the man's mouth. Rorr tossed him\
  \ away—he wasn't likely to get answers when the man had bitten through his own tongue.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"You will die,\" the shield-man spat. \"No one attacks soldiers of our\
  \ liege and lives!\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr frowned. He knew of no lord holding sway over\
  \ this land. The ebb and flow of royalty meant little to anyone plowing the land,\
  \ fighting locusts and drought and wheat intermixed with water-hungry weeds.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The three who could still stand spread in front of him, drawing weapons\
  \ and advancing.</p> \n   <p>\"Does this lord of yours murder and pillage?\" Rorr\
  \ pointed to the still burning house.</p> \n   <p>\"They refused to pay the taxes\
  \ owed.\"</p> \n   <p>That settled it. Rorr had heard nothing of any lord demanding\
  \ taxes, and his farm adjoined the Torvan acreage. These were brigands and nothing\
  \ more. As they came closer, he studied their stance, how they held their weapons\
  \ and the set to their bodies. They had military training and were used to fighting\
  \ in unison. That elevated them above common highwaymen.</p> \n   <p>But not by\
  \ much.</p> \n   <p>The one on Rorr's left attacked, thinking to distract him. Rorr\
  \ knelt, used a leg sweep like the one that had brought down the horse and its rider,\
  \ but didn't stop after he felt his heel strike the back of the fighter's knee.\
  \ From his crouch, he launched himself at the man attacking from the right flank.\
  \ His shoulder caught the man in the belly and bowled him over. As they hit the\
  \ ground, locked together, Rorr clawed at the brawny wrist holding the sword and\
  \ wrested it away. A quick roll and he came to his feet with the sword up in time\
  \ to parry a two-handed overhead cut.</p> \n   <p>The blades collided and sent sparks\
  \ dancing away. The impact jarred his attacker; Rorr twisted about and dropped his\
  \ sword in favor of delivering a hard punch to the man's temple. Delicate bone crushed\
  \ and drove into brain. The fighter sagged to the ground.</p> \n   <p>\"Rorr!\"\
  \ Suddenly Fren was behind him, voice high and scared. \"What's happening? Who are\
  \ these men?\"</p> \n   <p>Damn it—the boy was supposed to stay clear. \"Get out\
  \ of here, Fren. They're brigands. They killed the Torvans.\"</p> \n   <p>A whistling\
  \ sound galvanized Rorr. He whirled and grabbed, fingers closing on an arrow in\
  \ midair.</p> \n   <p>Fren's eyes went wide. The arrowhead with its wicked barbs\
  \ had been halted only inches from his face.</p> \n   <p>Rorr broke the shaft and\
  \ flung it from him. He turned to interpose himself between his stepson and two\
  \ new combatants, these towering half-orcs.</p> \n   <p>\"What have we here?\" one\
  \ said mockingly. \"I thought we'd killed them all.\"</p> \n   <p>\"These are new.\"\
  \ The second half-orc nocked an arrow, drew back the bowstring, and let fly.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>His bow had a heavier pull, and the arrow sang through the air at a higher\
  \ pitch. There was no way Rorr could catch it before it spitted his stepson, but\
  \ his arm flew up to block. He winced as the arrow drove through the muscle in his\
  \ forearm. An involuntary reflex as he jerked away robbed the shaft of its power;\
  \ the arrow remained embedded in his arm.</p> \n   <p>\"Run, Fren. Go!\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Rorr lifted his right forearm and drew out the now-bloody arrow. He stabbed\
  \ it in the half-orcs' direction. \"You're not wanted here.\"</p> \n   <p>The pair\
  \ laughed. </p> \n   <p>Rorr spun in a full circle and flung the arrow as if it\
  \ were a spear. The broad head drove through one half-orc's eye.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Impressive,\" the surviving warrior said, no fear in his voice.</p> \n   <p>\"I\
  \ missed. I'd aimed for his throat.\"</p> \n   <p>The half-orc laughed and fired\
  \ another arrow, but Rorr drove hard, legs pumping furiously. He slid through the\
  \ dirt and grabbed the fallen shield with the knife-sharp edge. The arrow missed\
  \ him, but a new whistling sounded immediately. The half-orc was competent with\
  \ his weapon.</p> \n   <p>Rorr rolled and used the shield to deflect two more arrows,\
  \ then saw the half-orc had chosen a different attack. From a second quiver slung\
  \ across his broad back, he brought forth an arrow dripping with black, oily fluid.\
  \ The half-orc let fly. Rorr watched the arrow soar above him. As it passed, it\
  \ exploded into flame and continued on to drive itself into the wooden door of the\
  \ Torvan granary.</p> \n   <p>The brigand laughed again and reached for another.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Rorr gripped the upper edge of the shield and spun it outward in\
  \ a glinting arc, then let go.</p> \n   <p>The sharpened side cut through the half-orc.\
  \ The chest wound exploded in a bloody fountain, and the archer slid backward off\
  \ his horse.</p> \n   <p>Rorr felt no triumph. He bent over and took a few quick\
  \ steps away from the burning granary. The arrow and its black oil had ignited a\
  \ fire as fearsome as the one devouring the farmhouse. Nothing could stand against\
  \ it.</p> \n   <p>That was when he heard Fren's call for help—from inside the blazing\
  \ building.</p> \n   <p>Putting his head down, Rorr charged like a bull, crashing\
  \ through the door and into the inferno.</p> \n   <br> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
