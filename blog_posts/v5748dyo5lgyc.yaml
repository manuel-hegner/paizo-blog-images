  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">There are many central features of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign</a> that have changed\
  \ little if at all over the better part of a decade since it began. The amount earned\
  \ by a Day Job and the item value threshold unlocked by having a certain amount\
  \ of Fame remain the same, and I don't believe a single word has changed in the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em>'s</a>\
  \ entries about alignment and how to calculate one's hit point total (with the exception\
  \ of adding new classes to the list). Perhaps the most dramatic change over the\
  \ years beyond the extraordinary growth in the list of venture-captains and venture-lieutenants\
  \ is how the campaign has treated factions.</p> \n    <p>For a long time, five factions\
  \ vied for control of Absalom and sent their respective agents one or two tasks\
  \ to accomplish during each scenario. It was certainly nice to hear from one's faction\
  \ leader regularly, and many found it reassuring that they could try to contribute\
  \ in some small way to the faction's fortunes no matter where adventure took them.\
  \ Things started getting pretty tricky when another five factions joined the scene\
  \ at the start of Season 3. Not only was it unrealistic to provide a faction goal\
  \ for every scenario for every faction (e.g. Does the Lantern Lodge <i>really</i>\
  \ have an interest in this Azlanti observatory or Qadiran shipwreck?), but faction\
  \ missions were becoming more of a burden at the table as GMs printed and distributed\
  \ ten handouts. It became increasingly apparent that one could just complete his\
  \ faction mission(s), fail the main task the Society had assigned, and get away\
  \ with most of the rewards, which did not sit well with many. Were there some great\
  \ faction missions? Absolutely. Without a doubt, though, many faction missions proved\
  \ forgettable and inconsequential but for the reward they gave. I think many who\
  \ participated in the campaign a few years ago remember the all-too-common chorus\
  \ of \"I search this room for a [minor MacGuffin]. Is there one in here? I take\
  \ 20.\"</p> \n    <p>Something needed to change, and beginning in Season 5, faction\
  \ leaders stopped distributing faction missions during every scenario. Faction leaders\
  \ began sending letters several times over the course of the season to inform their\
  \ agents what the faction's short-term goals were and if there were any special\
  \ opportunities coming up. Each faction then had special opportunities—usually more\
  \ involved than a typical faction mission from past seasons—in a handful of scenarios\
  \ for that season, and accomplishing one of these earned the PC a special boon.\
  \ Of course, this encountered its own problems. Distributing the letters in a way\
  \ that was both reliable and not a burden on GMs was difficult. Introducing faction\
  \ ties in some scenarios inadvertently pushed some players to play <i>only</i> members\
  \ of that faction in those adventures, making it harder to muster tables. Not having\
  \ something to do more often than not made factions feel less important. What's\
  \ more, juggling which faction appeared how often, in what level ranges, and doing\
  \ suitably flashy things made outlining and developing scenarios more difficult.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Every campaign change upsets players' expectations and forces participants\
  \ to adapt to something new, and certainly after the fairly substantial changes\
  \ that occurred at the beginning of Season 5, the Pathfinder Society team is cognizant\
  \ of the effects of announcing another revision to operating procedure. On the other\
  \ hand there are numerous issues that have developed gradually that need our attention,\
  \ and we first announced those in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgqn\">a blog several\
  \ months ago</a>. If you have not taken the opportunity to read the Factions part\
  \ of that blog, I encourage you to take a few minutes to do so.</p> \n    <p>All\
  \ caught up? Let's take a look at a few of the Faction Journal card entries in the\
  \ works, starting with several of the goals for the Silver Crusade. This faction\
  \ is the iconic good-guy faction, so my aim is to ensure that the faction journal\
  \ rewards the PC for doing things that make a lot of good-guy sense. Even where\
  \ there are faction goals that might be a little strange, each card has a paragraph\
  \ or two describing the faction's aims in more detail to provide the necessary context.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>▢▢ Defeat an outsider that has the evil subtype and\
  \ whose Challenge Rating is at least equal to your character level.<br> ▢▢ Defeat\
  \ an undead creature whose Challenge Rating is at least equal to your character\
  \ level.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I think it's safe to say that both of\
  \ these fit the good-guy trope, and both of these are common enough that many scenarios\
  \ should give a Silver Crusade faction PC a fair opportunity to fulfill one or both\
  \ of these. Of course, it's important to be aware that with few exceptions, a PC\
  \ can only check one box per adventure—our way of stretching out the accomplishments\
  \ over multiple scenarios and preventing someone from earning the maximum rewards\
  \ before reaching 2nd-level. So why do these each have two checkboxes? Well, some\
  \ faction goals are more common or easier to accomplish than others, and your faction\
  \ is not suitably impressed by or improved by one such achievement. After all, killing\
  \ your first demon might have been incidental or a fluke; killing a second one in\
  \ a later adventure proves that you take fiend slaying seriously. Let's look at\
  \ something without multiple checkboxes.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>▢ Spend\
  \ an amount of gold equal to at least 100 times your character level on spellcasting\
  \ services used on spells with the healing descriptor for another PC. You may instead\
  \ purchase and expend material components or a single-use magic item that costs\
  \ the same amount for that PC.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Ah, now this is\
  \ a little tougher in part because it requires the faction PC to pay out of pocket—\
  for a good cause, admittedly. You shouldn't have to do that more than once in the\
  \ name of boons, but giving your friend a <i>potion of cure serious wounds</i> in\
  \ a time of need is something that makes Ollysta Zadrian smile. Of course there\
  \ are bound to be occasional goals that don't come up often enough or that you'd\
  \ rather not complete. For that, we have one special opportunity.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>▢▢▢▢▢ When you are the GM for any event that grants 1 or more XP, you\
  \ may check one of this boon's boxes. If you have multiple faction cards, you may\
  \ only check a box on one of them each time you are the GM. Once all five boxes\
  \ are checked, you receive faction rewards on this card as though you had completed\
  \ two additional faction goals.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Aha, flexibility\
  \ and a GM reward all rolled into one! So why are we doing this? What's the payoff?\
  \ There are three tiers of reward, acquired when one completes two, five, and eight\
  \ goals respectively. As I'm writing these, I'm aiming to have each reward reflect\
  \ the flavor of the faction and make somebody from that faction feel that she's\
  \ reaping the benefits of her affiliation—ideally during every scenario. For example,\
  \ the Exchange faction's rewards make it easier to make money and easier to receive\
  \ discounts on equipment; honestly, shouldn't the PCs belonging to the \"money faction\"\
  \ have felt a little more wealthy all along? What's more, each top-tier reward grants\
  \ benefits to the whole table, allowing a truly successful faction PC to flaunt\
  \ her accomplishments and share the wealth. Let's see what the Silver Crusade has\
  \ to offer.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Soldier of Peace</b> (two goals):\
  \ You reduce the penalty on attack rolls to deal nonlethal damage with lethal weapons\
  \ by 2; if you already suffer no penalty on such an attack, you instead deal 1 additional\
  \ point of nonlethal damage. Once per adventure before casting a spell, you may\
  \ choose to replace half of the lethal damage dealt with an equal amount of nonlethal\
  \ damage.</p> \n     <p><b>Anointed</b> (five goals): You gain a +2 sacred bonus\
  \ on Charisma-based checks made against good creatures and saving throws against\
  \ spells and effects with the evil descriptor. Once per scenario as a swift action,\
  \ you may grant a weapon you wield the benefits of <i>bless weapon</i> for one round.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Paragon</b> (eight goals): When you or an ally spends Prestige Points\
  \ to purchase the spellcasting service <i>raise dead, resurrection</i>, or <i>true\
  \ resurrection</i>, reduce the Prestige Point cost by 25% (rounded up). When you\
  \ cast any of these spells, you may reduce the cost of the material component by\
  \ 25%. When activating either the Soldier of Peace or Anointed boon, you may choose\
  \ to grant the benefit to one ally you can see instead of receiving it yourself.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Looking at these, the more Silver Crusade PCs act\
  \ like good guys and vanquishers of evil, the better they become at being good guys\
  \ and vanquishing evil. Most of the benefits are ones a PC might use in a typical\
  \ adventure, and many of the goals are likely to appear even when randomly selecting\
  \ which adventure to play next (even a module). Nice! The boons and goals above\
  \ are still in the works and may have to change to fit on the Faction Journal card,\
  \ but hopefully this gives you a good sense of where this project is going. We're\
  \ aiming to have these out in the wild in early February.</p> \n    <p>Are there\
  \ themes that you would like to see appear among your favorite faction's goals or\
  \ rewards? Tell me about it here!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <em>Developer</em></p>\
