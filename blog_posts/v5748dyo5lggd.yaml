  \ the interest of making it to my next panel on time and letting the Paizo web team\
  \ get to PAX, I’m going to keep things short and sweet this week.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>We've got three more minis to reveal, all from November's <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a> set.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"margin: 10px\

  ></a>\n     <br> <b>City Watch Sniper</b>\n    </div> \n    <p>This figure fulfills\
  \ a couple of items on my wishlist. Here we have another City Watch officer to go\
  \ with the two in our debut set, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8mq6?Pathfinder-Battles-Heroes-Monsters\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>. The Sniper also gives us a good crossbow figure, and\
  \ a female crossbow figure to boot. The colors don’t match the rank-and-file officers\
  \ exactly—the Sniper lacks the tan base color of the previous guards, but she’s\
  \ a cooler-looking figure in general and is more likely to match additional City\
  \ Watch figures in the future (there’s at least one more coming next year). The\
  \ City Watch Sniper is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <b>Firepelt Cougar</b>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Firepelt Cougar\
  \ is one of the first original Pathfinder animals ever invented, appearing way back\
  \ in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy7zkr?Pathfinder-1-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Chapter-1-Burnt-Offerings\"\
  >Pathfinder #1</a>. It’s also the animal companion of the goblin druid Gogmurt,\
  \ from the same issue. Accordingly, I’ve wanted it in the Pathfinder Battles line\
  \ from the beginning. In a way, it’s a slot-filler for a <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rqs?Pathfinder-Battles-Rise-of-the-Runelords\"\
  >Runelords figure</a> we missed the first time around, but given that it’s a pretty\
  \ basic great cat, the figure should see high utility all around. That said, I think\
  \ Pathfinder Battles probably has enough great cats for a few sets, so don’t expect\
  \ to see too many of them in the future. The Firepelt Cougar is a Medium, common\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140829-Pazuzu.jpg\"><img src=\" /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140829-Pazuzu_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <b>Pazuzu</b>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have Pazuzu, one of\
  \ the jaw-dropper minis in the set. When WizKids first brought in this demon lord\
  \ to the office, our very own James Jacobs—long a thrall of the Lord of the Lower\
  \ Aerial Kingdoms—prostrated himself on the conference room floor and immediately\
  \ began chanting Pazuzu’s name. He only said it three times before he disappeared\
  \ in a blast of black fire. We haven’t seen him since and really need his help to\
  \ finish the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, so if any of you are in the Abyss this weekend and see James, please\
  \ tell him we miss him. The Pazuzu figure is the perfect match for his consort,\
  \ Lamashtu, who also appears in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb\">The\
  \ Lost Coast</a> set. Pazuzu is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that’s it\
  \ for this week. I’m off to Dragon Con, where the gaming is fierce and the cosplay\
  \ is absolutely incredible. I have not seen so many Zardoz’s since the movie Zardoz.\
