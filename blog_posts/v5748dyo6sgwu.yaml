  \ </div> \n     <p>Zemir Solodan was born with a gift—but not everyone saw it that\
  \ way at first.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The only son of miners on\
  \ a remote planetoid called Pikora 317, tucked within the widest orbital ring of\
  \ the gas giant Preluria in Near Space, Zemir spent his earliest days exposed to\
  \ the harsh reality of life in a corporate labor colony. Determined to provide for\
  \ their son, Zemir’s parents eked out their existence in the Freugan Salvage Company’\
  s starmetal mines. The Solodans never went hungry, though the only delicacies young\
  \ Zemir enjoyed were occasional tastes of citrus-chocolate pastries, sweet-milk\
  \ custards, and savory meringues—gifts from the Freugan executives’ own ample stashes\
  \ of treats imported from Absalom Station.</p> \n     <p>Even as a toddler, Zemir’\
  s gaiety and thirst for new experiences were readily apparent. The vivacious boy\
  \ quickly became known for his curiosity around the sparse facilities of the salvage\
  \ company’s residential complex on Pikora 317. He developed many troublesome talents,\
  \ such as sneaking into seemingly inaccessible places, turning neat collections\
  \ of supplies into epic messes, and even finding ways to manipulate control panels\
  \ into colorful, sparking displays. In fact, whenever a commonplace utility malfunctioned\
  \ around the Solodan home, his parents joked that the “Zemir effect” had struck\
  \ again.</p> \n     <p>Around Zemir’s fifth birthday, it seemed that the boy’s body\
  \ began to betray him. Always known for eating anything with aplomb—especially new\
  \ foods—Zemir seemed to sicken overnight. His appetite was as strong as always,\
  \ but he gained weight, took on a sickly pallor, and grew weak. Despite his healthy\
  \ diet and robust physical activity, testing indicated that the boy was dangerously\
  \ malnourished. Even stranger, after every meal, Zemir’s breath smelled eerily similar\
  \ to his favorite sweet treats, perhaps an indication of a dangerous blood disease,\
  \ doctors speculated. </p> \n     <p>One by one, physicians ruled out all known\
  \ ailments. Though his spirit never dampened, Zemir’s condition continued to deteriorate,\
  \ even after his family sold most of their belongings to afford vitamin supplements,\
  \ pediatric medicinals, and batteries of experimental medical tests. Desperate,\
  \ and carrying news from the pediatricians that Zemir might eventually perish, his\
  \ parents took to posting details of their son’s strange condition on every related\
  \ infosphere portal they could find.</p> \n     <p>In just a few days, the Solodans’\
  \ pleas elicited a mysterious message from a Dr. Fainoro Corone, who said he suspected\
  \ a rare and unexplainable diagnosis and requested to observe the boy in person.\
  \ Dr. Corone’s long list of credentials indicated he was an expert in “exceptional\
  \ pediatric conditions.” He hailed from a facility on far-off Arkanen, a Liavaran\
  \ moon home to scientists, spellcasters, and—as Zemir’s parents believed—medical\
  \ doctors.</p> \n     <p>With no other options, Zemir’s parents readily welcomed\
  \ the quiet damaya lashunta doctor into their home. For a full day, Dr. Corone watched\
  \ Zemir’s every move, focusing on the boy’s behavior at meal times. As Zemir slurped\
  \ at his nutritional broth with surprising glee, Dr. Corone studied him closely.\
  \ Slight mumbling accompanied his look of suspicion, as if the doctor communed with\
  \ some internal eldritch knowledge. </p> \n     <p>On the second day, Dr. Corone\
  \ attended breakfast at the Solodan house wearing a pair of thick, circuitry-etched\
  \ bracers. Saying nothing, he watched Zemir’s father spoon broth into his pallid\
  \ son’s mouth. Just before the gleeful boy swallowed, Dr. Corone’s demand rang out:\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“Zemir, open your mouth now.”</p> \n     <p>The boy refused and\
  \ downed the broth quickly. But at his mother’s command, he sheepishly opened his\
  \ mouth. A thin film of custard clung to his baby teeth, and his breath smelled\
  \ like sweet milk.</p> \n     <p>Dr. Corone pointed this out, and then gently instructed\
  \ Zemir’s parents to continue feeding the boy. Saying nothing, he flipped a tiny\
  \ switch on his bracers, which thrummed and glowed with a strange technological\
  \ energy.</p> \n     <p>Immediately, Zemir’s eyes widened. His father fed him his\
  \ broth, and when Zemir drank it, he made a disgusted face.</p> \n     <p>Dr. Corone\
  \ nodded and explained: Zemir was not suffering from a physical ailment. The boy\
  \ was instead, in the subtlest of ways, warping the fabric of reality to suit his\
  \ childish preferences. For months, the boy had been turning all of his meals into\
  \ nutritionally empty sweets. Similarly, the messes and mischief he had caused around\
  \ the residential complex were the result of the boy’s ability to shift reality\
  \ ever-so-slightly for his own amusement.</p> \n     <p>Zemir was a witchwarper—\
  one who understands that the universe consists of infinite realities. What’s more,\
  \ witchwarpers possess the innate ability to peer into those worlds, and to mix\
  \ and manipulate them at will. Most witchwarpers’ abilities manifested in adulthood,\
  \ Dr. Corone explained. But Zemir was special, powerful even for a child, and unlike\
  \ anyone he had seen.</p> \n     <p>The doctor’s bracers—called reality stabilizers—\
  dampened Zemir’s nascent and unstable abilities and would allow the boy to have\
  \ a normal childhood. The lashunta was prepared to give the Solodans their own set\
  \ of reality stabilizers, but with his “diagnosis” came another offer. </p> \n \
  \    <p>Dr. Corone wanted to bring Zemir back to Arkanen with him. There, he’d enroll\
  \ the boy in the Institute for Extraordinary Minds, a facility that was effectively\
  \ a school for young witchwarpers. </p> \n     <p>The witchwarpers at the institute—\
  like Dr. Corone himself—could help Zemir learn control over his abilities, the doctor\
  \ explained. Dr. Corone offered full tuition for Zemir and unrestricted visitation\
  \ privileges for his family. Saddened but understanding the value of this offer,\
  \ Zemir’s parents agreed.</p> \n     <p>For the next twelve years, Zemir was Dr.\
  \ Corone’s protege. Zemir spent the time honing his ability to subtly manipulate\
  \ his surroundings, growing more delighted each time he created a new sound, smell—\
  and especially taste—that he’d never before experienced. He supplemented his training\
  \ with an insatiable appetite for learning about far-away cuisine and cultures,\
  \ dreaming of one day traveling throughout this reality and perhaps an infinite\
  \ number of others. During this time, Zemir also learned of Eloritu, the god of\
  \ magic and secrets, and came to view the infinite cosmos as a gift from this mysterious\
  \ deity.</p> \n     <p>However, as passionate as Zemir became about his talents\
  \ and studies, he also grew increasingly cocky and resentful of the reality stabilizers\
  \ the instructors used to rein his more dangerous experiments. </p> \n     <p>Near\
  \ Zemir’s eighteenth birthday, the young witchwarper began the early stages of his\
  \ final thesis project: an ambitious attempt to create a minute-long rift into a\
  \ reality adjacent to his own. The institute’s professors approved the project only\
  \ under their strict supervision, requiring the placement of several stabilizing\
  \ safeguards during all forms of research.</p> \n     <p>Zemir bristled at such\
  \ restrictions. And so, under the cover of night, the brash and charismatic young\
  \ man convinced three of his closest friends and fellow students to participate\
  \ in a dry-run of his experiment. With no safeguards in place, Zemir used his substantial\
  \ willpower to tear open a rift in reality. A primal scream rent his lips and a\
  \ shock of his hair whitened under the great mental strain. Ecstatic, terrified,\
  \ but trusting their brilliant friend, Zemir’s classmates stepped through the rift,\
  \ which immediately winked out. </p> \n     <p>The human Alena Nidaro, the half-elf\
  \ Tornil Lee, and the ysoki Smidge disappeared from this reality. Try as he might,\
  \ Zemir could not reopen the rift nor could he find any trace of his friends.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Panicked, Zemir ran from his lab to the institute’s docking bay, where\
  \ at least he could be alone and think. For a moment, he considered returning to\
  \ confess his horrific error to Dr. Corone, but then he saw a midnight supply shuttle\
  \ about to leave Arkanen for Absalom Station. And in that split second, Zemir decided\
  \ the course of his own existence. </p> \n     <p>Posing as a worker, Zemir fled\
  \ the Institute for Extraordinary Minds in the shuttle, and promptly lost himself\
  \ in the crowds of Absalom Station. Convinced his friends were gone and he was to\
  \ blame, Zemir wandered the station in a haze for weeks, performing minor tricks\
  \ of warped reality for the credits he needed to survive. Eventually, Zemir sent\
  \ a message to Dr. Corone to confess what he had done, then deactivated his institute\
  \ communications account. </p> \n     <p>Despite the institute’s best efforts to\
  \ track Zemir down and get some answers, Dr. Corone and his colleagues have always\
  \ remained one step behind him. Although his wits returned, Zemir’s scars are far\
  \ from healed. He now travels to all corners of this reality, as much seeking to\
  \ earn a living using his strange magic and indulge his love of new experiences\
  \ as he is running from a guilty conscience. </p> \n     <p>Growing ever more powerful\
  \ daily, Zemir is a mysterious and joyful—if occasionally morose—companion to those\
  \ who share his goals. He’s known for waxing eloquent about the tapestry of existence\
  \ and the dangers that other realities hold. The wise would heed the witchwarper’\
  s words, for Zemir has looked into infinite realities—and he’s vowed to never again\
  \ lose another to the fray.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Amanda Hamon<br> <i>Managing\
