  \  <p itemprop=\"description\"><b><a href=\"https://tabletopgaymers.org\">Tabletop\
  \ Gaymers</a></b> is proud just to get back into the swing of things! Last year\
  \ we attended all four of our planned conventions and started off this year being\
  \ able to join everyone at PaizoCon. It is wonderful seeing all the smiling eyes\
  \ (keep those face masks on, please)! We loved seeing everyone proudly wearing their\
  \ gaymer and ally badge ribbons and appreciated everyone visiting our table.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We're proud of a lot of other things too! In the past few months...\
  \ We've gone from a team of 4 overwhelmed directors to a booming team of 16 officers!\
  \ Having all the fresh souls on board has revitalized the organization and we've\
  \ already started on some great new things:</p> \n     <p>We are revved for Origins\
  \ next week to have our own booth in the exhibit hall. We are going to have our\
  \ own \"Gayme Room\" at Gen Con this year with nearly 100 events already planned.\
  \ We launched and debuted our \"Pride Flag Badge Ribbons\" at PaizoCon. We have\
  \ got some sweet new enamel pins and other pride swag coming out in the next few\
  \ months. Our Discord server finally hit the 500-user threshold. Our new Twitch\
  \ channel is picking up rapidly. And we're on the verge of launching a safe-space\
  \ program for friendly local game stores.</p> \n     <p>Last but certainly not least,\
  \ we are not proud but grateful and humbled to have Paizo select Tabletop Gaymers\
  \ as one of the beneficiaries of their \"Pathfinder Second Edition Beginners Bundle\"\
  \ alongside <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org\">The Trevor Project</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If you want to know more about Tabletop Gaymers, possibly get involved\
  \ and join the team, visit our website at TabletopGaymers.org or get in touch at\
  \ contact@TabletopGaymers.org. We would love to hear from you.</p> \n     <p>Happy\
  \ Pride Month!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\

  \   </div> \n     <br> \n     <h3>First Time at PaizoCon 2022</h3> \n     <p>This\
  \ Memorial Day weekend, I had the opportunity to volunteer at <b>PaizoCon 2022</b>\
  \ for <b>Tabletop Gaymers</b>. I joined as an officer in the beginning of the year\
  \ because I believed in the non-profit’s goal of promoting diversity, equity, and\
  \ inclusion by championing the visibility and recognition of the LGBTQIA+ community\
  \ through tabletop gaming. Paizo has been an active supporter of Tabletop Gaymers\
  \ and asked us if we’d like to come and run a table in the vendor area of the convention\
  \ in Seattle. </p> \n     <p>I had never been to an RPG convention before and honestly\
  \ felt somewhat lost in many conversations involving Pathfinder and Starfinder.\
  \ As a board game designer, I sadly have only dipped my toes into the water of RPGs.\
  \ Due to most RPGs needing a larger time commitment and a group being available\
  \ to consistently meet up, this just hasn’t been an area of the gaming world I’\
  ve had a chance to explore. But after coming to this Con and seeing the excitement\
  \ the attendees felt, I am remotivated to try and play! </p> \n     <p>According\
  \ to Carrie, an amazing volunteer we had, this year's convention was significantly\
  \ smaller than previous years thanks to covid. There were times when we just hung\
  \ out at the table and chatted or talked to the Paizo employees. Other times we\
  \ had people coming up to the booth to ask for our rainbow “gaymer” and “ally” ribbons\
  \ as well as our neon green pronoun ribbons. The amount of “thank you’s” I heard\
  \ from attendees filled my heart. It was amazing to see how many people donated\
  \ and shared their stories of realizing they were a gaymer or of having a friend\
  \ that was. </p> \n     <p>Over the past few years, I’ve become aware of how important\
  \ RPGs are in helping people explore their traumas, sexualities, and sexual orientations.\
  \ Roleplaying in a safe space allows players to create characters that are as similar\
  \ or different as they please. You can try on a new pronoun as your character. Using\
  \ Roll20 and other online sites players can add their character names and pronouns\
  \ to their signature. This helps remind players during the game, similar to how\
  \ our pronoun ribbons at conventions can help attendees appropriately identify themselves.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>While talking to attendees, I heard stories about men creating\
  \ female characters to allow them to help express their more feminine side. Their\
  \ characters charged into battle in a new outfit every time, screaming things like\
  \ “if I can wear this, you can too!”—promoting the body positivity of the cow people.\
  \ But also, I learned about the darker side of the online RPG space with people\
  \ propositioning players to go into different chat rooms to do questionable things\
  \ in exchange for valuables used in their games. One man I met told me that people\
  \ assumed he was a girl like the character he had created, but because his voice\
  \ function wasn’t working on his computer, he was unable to prove that he was a\
  \ male behind the mic. He experienced harassment and propositions until he finally\
  \ was able to get his audio working on his computer to prove his gender. The experience\
  \ was eye opening to him and made him feel for all the females that want to enter\
  \ the RPG space. </p> \n     <p>As a girl, I have felt uncomfortable at times in\
  \ new spaces, but I can say that this convention was incredibly welcoming to gaymers\
  \ and newbies to RPGs. Attendees were more than delighted to answer my questions\
  \ about how they create their characters, choose their campaigns, and build their\
  \ groups. One other vendor explained to me that RPGs are on the rise and they are\
  \ experiencing a shortage of Dungeon and Game Masters to the point of it becoming\
  \ a paid gig at some of his local game stores. One Paizo employee said the first\
  \ game of Pathfinder he ever played he GMed. He started too ambitious with a group\
  \ of 12 then broke them off into two smaller groups, and by the end of the year,\
  \ when both campaigns ended, he felt like he could conquer any challenge! I am doing\
  \ something similar by jumping into my first D&amp;D campaign in celebration of\
  \ Pride month with a three-episode live-stream hosted by WIGI (Women in Games International)\
  \ Tuesday nights starting June 14th.</p> \n     <p>It was amazing to have such detailed\
  \ conversations with strangers. Most were self-proclaimed introverts, but when they\
  \ were with their people, they blossomed into conversations about all things Paizo\
  \ and beyond. It was also really cool to see people’s excitement in Tabletop Gaymer’\
  s new Pride Flag ribbons. Attendees donated to collect ribbons that they felt described\
  \ them. The ribbons also caused interesting conversations of which ribbons were\
  \ collected the most. The answer was asexual, nonbinary, trans, and bi were a 4-way\
  \ tie, with others closely behind. I also had many people proclaim they were still\
  \ figuring it out. Which I get. I wear the “lesbian” ribbon but I don’t think anyone\
  \ is 100% anything. So sometimes I still struggle with choosing the appropriate\
  \ label for myself. In person I typically stick to the term “gay” until further\
  \ pressed. Then I use “lesbian”. But at gaming conventions, thanks to organizations\
  \ like Tabletop Gaymers, I feel more comfortable wearing these fun, colorful ribbons.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>I did have someone come up to the booth and ask about the ribbons.\
  \ After recognizing he wasn’t a gaymer, I offered him an ally ribbon. In response,\
  \ I was given a speech on how he didn’t feel comfortable labeling himself an ally.\
  \ That it felt fake in a way. I’ve heard this argument before and do understand\
  \ that “ally” is a term that should be given. But as a gay girl I can say that seeing\
  \ those ally ribbons on people makes me feel safe, supported and more comfortable\
  \ in a space with people I don’t know. I’m an extrovert but I still feel intimidated\
  \ at times wanting to sit down at a table of men. Seeing that rainbow ribbon really\
  \ does ease the tension, similar to when I see pride flags outside of different\
  \ shops. It makes me know that it is a safe and welcoming space. We all need a safe\
  \ space, and that’s what our organization works to do at conventions. I am so thankful\
  \ for Paizo promoting us and allowing us a chance to share our message with the\
  \ attendees of PaizoCon! </p> \n     <p>Also, I did get a chance to play one game\
  \ while I was here, and that was the Steve Jackson and Pazio crossover game “Pathfinder\
  \ Revolution,” the board game. I got to play the first game outside of development\
  \ and it was great! It’s officially added to my must-buy list. We played the 4-player\
  \ game but the game scales higher. I’m not sure how that goes, since the rules change,\
  \ but for the game I played, I really enjoyed the refresh on an old Steve Jackson\
  \ game. Apparently, this game was a surprise even for many of the Paizo employees\
  \ that saw the game appear in the glass case.</p> \n     <p>If you’re a fan of Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder I highly recommend checking out this very friendly small convention\
  \ hosted by Paizo in Seattle. This may not have been as large as GenCon, but the\
  \ stories attendees shared about how these games helped them learn about themselves\
  \ was amazing. I especially liked that Paizo updated their starter characters to\
  \ include lesbian characters; that honestly motivated me more to learn more about\
  \ the system and world. I would 100% attend again. So, thank you Paizo for having\
  \ us! And for anyone looking to find our ribbons, you can find us at Origins, GenCon,\
  \ DragonCon, and PAX Unplugged this year! Plus, our online store stocks up on all\
  \ things rainbow, so check it out and donate to a great cause that helps gaymers\
  \ like me feel safe and excited to be in this amazing community!</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ look forward to meeting more amazing people at future conventions!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Happy Pride Month!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
