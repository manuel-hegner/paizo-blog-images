  \ time for <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar 2014</a>! Every year, Paizo holds\
  \ an annual open-call RPG design competition to give the best and brightest aspiring\
  \ game designers a chance to show the world their talent. This year's winner will\
  \ receive a contract to write a Pathfinder Module to be published by Paizo.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Previous winning modules include Christine Schneider's <a href=\"/products/btpy86uz\"\
  ><i>Clash of the Kingslayers</i></a>, Neil Spicer's <a href=\"/products/btpy8d52\"\
  ><i>Realm of the Fellnight Queen</i></a>, Matthew Goodall's <a href=\"/products/btpy8ihu\"\
  ><i>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</i></a>, Sam Zeitlin's <a href=\"/products/btpy8rgj\"\
  ><i>The Midnight Mirror</i></a>, Mike Welham's <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc5\"><i>Doom\
  \ Comes to Dustpawn</i></a>, and Steven Helt’s <a href=\"/products/btpy8xss\"><i>Tears\
  \ at Bitter Manor</i></a>. We look forward to welcoming the next winner to the ranks\
  \ of published adventure designers!</p> \n    <p>Even if you don't win the grand\
  \ prize, RPG Superstar offers a number of different routes to getting your name\
  \ on a Paizo product. Runners-up will have their work critiqued by industry leaders,\
  \ and the three final-round runners-up will earn a contract to write a Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario, a downloadable adventure sanctioned for play in Paizo's worldwide\
  \ Pathfinder Society mega-campaign. Staff and audience favorite entries from RPG\
  \ Superstar's earlier rounds may show up in Paizo publications as well.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Getting noticed in RPG Superstar might be the start of a long-term professional\
  \ relationship with Paizo as one of our regular freelancers. Developer Rob McCreary\
  \ got his start with Paizo as a finalist in the first RPG Superstar. Even though\
  \ he didn't win the final challenge, his creativity and talent earned him a staff\
  \ position as one of the creative leads behind our flagship Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path line.</p> \n    <p>This year's competition begins today with an open call\
  \ to design an original wondrous item. Last year we introduced public voting by\
  \ fans for these initial entries, and the response was so great—over 500,000 votes\
  \ cast—we’re doing it again this year. Tell us about your magical treasure in 300\
  \ words or less by January 1, 2014, and you might just have started your RPG design\
  \ career! The top 32 will be picked by our guest judges and staff, and those 32\
  \ competitors will face other game design challenges in the remaining rounds of\
  \ the competition.</p> \n    <p>So loosen up your creative muscles and start crafting\
  \ a wondrous item, and get ready to be the next <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a>!</p>\
