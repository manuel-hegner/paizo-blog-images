  \ pack and placed it gently on the ground in front of her cot in the small barracks\
  \ near the Azlanti dig site. “Finally! Field work!” She thought to herself. Of course,\
  \ the field work was to be heavily supervised, and concerned a site that had been\
  \ stripped of all known dangers by actual agents—not initiates like she and her\
  \ companions. Still, training or not, it was a field assignment, her first time\
  \ spending significant time outside of the Grand Lodge in Absalom since she first\
  \ left the Sewer Dragon warrens to join the Society. Even if it wasn’t the real\
  \ type of field work she read about countless times in the Chronicles, it was still\
  \ one step closer to her Confirmation—and from there, her story could <em>really</em>\
  \ begin.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/810f2abd-56fa-40bf-99c3-da0a0fdd2c3a/PZOPFS05_NIXRET_1200x1500.png\"\

  \ exactly pleasant, given the extreme humidity, endless buzzing insects, and the\
  \ slight sulfurous odor making everything smell a bit like old eggs. The barracks\
  \ tent would be incredibly crowded, and her instructors had been sure to instill\
  \ in them that this wasn’t a vacation—if anything, they’d work harder than they\
  \ ever did in Absalom. Still, she couldn’t help but envision herself finding some\
  \ unnoticed Azlanti artifact during a training exercise and earning her place in\
  \ a chronicle then and there. And even if the Blackwood Swamp wasn’t the most comfortable\
  \ place to be doing field work, it could be far worse. The iruxi of the nearby Tskikha\
  \ enclave were incredibly welcoming, and one of their chief hunters, Kazuuk, had\
  \ even come out to meet them in Cassomir, ensuring the initiate’s safe arrival at\
  \ the dig site. The new Venture Captain out of Oppara, a kobold like her as she\
  \ was excited to discover, Lolly Adafish had set up a temporary office in Cassomir\
  \ and saw to it that the initiates wouldn’t want for provisions.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ the fact of the matter was, here there was no more busywork. No more lectures\
  \ dealing only with theory. No more cleaning up after a menagerie of birds as a\
  \ punishment for sneaking out. This was real field work. And even if other Pathfinders\
  \ had cleared the site years ago, it was still an Azlanti ruin, and she’d still\
  \ be exploring it. Even if that exploration was going to be heavily supervised,\
  \ she couldn’t help but look forward to what this training would show her, and what\
  \ she could show her instructors. Nixtret fell backwards into her cot, grinning\
  \ wildly, the sudden movement causing her companions to jump slightly in surprise.\
  \ “This is going to be our moment!” she exclaimed, more to herself than to any of\
  \ the other initiates. The others just shook their heads, glanced at one another,\
  \ and smiled. They all knew that, regardless of anything, no one could best Nixret\
  \ in a contest of daydreams.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/77706d74-79d0-4615-bf64-b78e088967cd/PZOPFS9902_KAZUUK_1200x1500.png\"\
