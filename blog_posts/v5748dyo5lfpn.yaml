  >We've only got two more minis to reveal for this month's <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted miniatures. Before I show off photos, however,\
  \ I need to make an important update to the set's actual release date. Due to inclement\
  \ weather across virtually the entire country last week, we've had to delay the\
  \ official release of the Wrath of the Righteous set to January 22. So update your\
  \ calendars (and your expectations) for this new release date, please.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>That out of the way, I'd also like to share with you that last night\
  \ I brought home and opened a case of <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous</a> figures. This case came directly from the warehouse, and directly\
  \ from the factory before that. So unlike the images I post here, which are generally\
  \ paint masters, I got a chance to see the actual production run figures and was\
  \ able to gauge the impact of some of the paint master changes we implemented with\
  \ this set.</p> \n    <p>As I've mentioned in a previous Friday blog, the production\
  \ run of the previous set, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>,\
  \ fell short of our expectations in regards to factory paint application. There\
  \ are still tons of great figures in that set, and it's certainly possible to get\
  \ excellent examples of each mini in the set depending on when in the production\
  \ run the mini in question was painted (and presumably by whom), there was more\
  \ inconsistency in that set than in any of the previous ones, so for <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> we attempted to make the factory's\
  \ job a little bit easier by toning down some of the color gradients, ink washes,\
  \ and minor details like zippers and belt buckles.</p> \n    <p>Speaking broadly,\
  \ after opening a case I'm pretty confident that this experiment was a success.\
  \ While there is of course the quality variance you might expect with any mass-produced\
  \ products, I can say with authority that <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of\
  \ the Righteous</a> contains several of the best-looking figures we've done to date.\
  \ Creatures like the Dominion Invader, Gibrileth Demon, Will-o'-Wisp, and especially\
  \ the fire demon Khorramzadah look just shy of perfect. I'm pretty excited by what\
  \ I saw last night, and while there remains room for improvement, I feel like we\
  \ are zeroing in on as close to ideal as one might reasonably expect. Lots and lots\
  \ of sweet figures in this one, folks.</p> \n    <p>With that being said, let's\
  \ take a look at the one remaining normal-sized figure in the set I accidentally\
  \ left off last week's preview, the Frost Drake!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_FrostDrake_500.jpeg\"> <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_FrostDrake_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Meet the Frost Drake, a CR 7 menace from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</a>. This creature is also heavily\
  \ featured in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, giving you plenty of opportunities to incorporate it into\
  \ play. Degenerate cousins of white dragons, Frost Drakes are ferocious predators\
  \ that haunt arctic wastelands and mountain heights. They breathe freezing mist\
  \ and generally like to eat adventurers (or anyone else). The Frost Drake is a Large,\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>And with that out of the way, let's take a close\
  \ look at the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set's limited\
  \ edition promotional miniature, Deskari, Lord of the Locust Host, a Gargantuan\
  \ demon lord sure to send your heroes into itchy fits. </p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71410_Deskari.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71410_Deskari_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Known as the Lord of the Locust Host and the Usher\
  \ of the Apocalypse, Deskari has long plagued the northlands of Golarion, where\
  \ the walls between the Abyss and the Material Plane have always been weak. Long\
  \ ago, one such foray into Golarion brought Deskari to the attention of the living\
  \ god Aroden, patron of humanity, who defeated him and sealed him away. When Aroden\
  \ died at the onset of the Age of Lost Omens about a century ago, Deskari emerged\
  \ with a vengeance, bringing the Abyss with him and tainting Golarion with the treacherous\
  \ landscape of the Worldwound, the setting of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>.</p> \n    <p>And now, he can bring that\
  \ same sort of hospitality to your game table. Here are some relevant statistics.\
  \ CR 29. 742 hit points. Regeneration 30 (epic and good or deific). SR 40. You're\
  \ welcome, Game Masters!</p> \n    <p>Deskari is a Gargantuan figure. He stands\
  \ much taller than the four-legged <a href=\"/products/btpy909h\">Gargantuan Green\
  \ Dragon</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>, and is\
  \ even a smidge taller than the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqo\">Rune Giant</a> from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>, making Deskari the largest\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> figure we've produced to date. </p> \n    <p>To purchase Deskari at\
  \ this time, you must purchase a <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Standard Booster Case</a>, either individually or as part of a <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>. Pathfinder Battles subscribers receive\
  \ 75% off our price ($39.99) for this enormous premium miniature.</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ that's it for this week, and for the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous</a> set. Remember to look for the set to release on January 22. Seek\
  \ it out at your local retailer or preorder here on paizo.com!</p> \n    <p>Next\
  \ week, I'll have something new and exciting to share with you. See you then!</p>\
