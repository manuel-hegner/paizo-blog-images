  >Mortil spun only just in time to let loose a spell. Colors ravaged Gull's eyes,\
  \ and he felt dizzy, as if a full drunken night were compressed into one heartbeat.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>When his senses returned, Mortil was gone, a crowd of people was combatting\
  \ the fire in the kitchen, and Tambour was speaking urgently.</p> \n    <p>\"She'll\
  \ be all right, Gull, but we must speak, now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Corvine...\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I'm telling you, your friend will be all right.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull\
  \ stumbled onto the veranda where Admiral Kasaba and Governor Bozbeyli themselves\
  \ were among those tending to Corvine Gale.</p> \n    <p>Not a mark was on her,\
  \ but Corvine looked as weak as Gull's elder brother the day a horse kicked him\
  \ and permanently scared Gull away from honest work.</p> \n    <p>\"Corvine...\"\

  \ gentleman adventurer... I saw...\" She handed him a crumpled piece of paper, patting\
  \ his hand. \"Take it, for luck...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Corvine...\"</p> \n    <p>He\

  ></a>\n     <br>Mortil, the governor's man, is more than he seems.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>\"I've seen this sort of injury before, Lion Blade,\" the admiral told Gull.\
  \ \"She should recover.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Go with Tambour,\" the governor said. He\
  \ passed a bejeweled ring to the corsair. \"You Lion Blades are authorized to do\
  \ anything necessary to hunt down this traitor.\"</p> \n    <p>\"'Lion Blades?'\"\
  \ Gideon said, rising.</p> \n    <p>Tambour took his arm. \"We'll talk as we walk.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The corsair steered Gull through garden and guards and gate, out into\
  \ the moonlit streets of Old Cassomir. They passed the public gallows called Pharasma's\
  \ Pulpit after the goddess of graves, and Gull was unhappy with the omen. He made\
  \ the sign of the antlers, but good Erastil seemed as far away as Andoran.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"There's no time to spare, so we'll plan as we go,\" Tambour said. \"Most\
  \ destinations in Cassomir are south of here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What plan?\" Gull\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>Tambour's response was a grim laugh. \"You aren't thinking\
  \ like a Lion Blade, my friend.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's because I'm not a... whatever\
  \ that is...\"</p> \n    <p>Tambour seemed not to hear him. \"We don't need a plan\
  \ of our own so much as we need to guess Mortil's. He spoke of a target, yes? I\
  \ don't think he could have meant the admiral. Mortil had enough opportunity, and\
  \ enough power, to kill her just now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But—\" Objections crowded\
  \ Gull's brain as thoroughly as rich houses crowded this walled section of the city.\
  \ The Admiral's Citadel rose ahead, its towers jabbing at the moon. Beyond, across\
  \ the harbor, lay the even larger edifice of Grayguard Castle. \"Isn't the admiral\
  \ key to all of Taldor's defenses?\" Gull said. \"She was vulnerable tonight. Why\
  \ else plan an assassination for now? Who else to kill?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah! Now\
  \ you're thinking, rather than mooning over your diva back there.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Shut up. She could have died.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Count yourself lucky. I've lost comrades\
  \ tonight. Rack your brains, gentleman adventurer. Did the dog Mortil specifically\
  \ speak of <i>killing</i>?\"</p> \n    <p>Gull thought. \"No,\" he admitted. \"\
  I don't think he did.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I fear he has another target in mind. Something\
  \ important, something less carefully guarded what with the admiral's party. Something\
  \ Mortil could still attack with his magic—and certainly will, now that he's exposed.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The shipyards?\" Gull guessed.</p> \n    <p>Tambour nodded. \"That's\
  \ my thought as well. We have magic-sniffers scattered throughout that district,\
  \ but as a governor's man, Mortil could bypass them. As ever, betrayal is the greatest\
  \ weapon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Magic-sniffers?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't have to tell\
  \ you everything, Gull. Come, let's be quick.\"</p> \n    <p>They ran through Old\
  \ Cassomir's gate and dashed near the looming ruins of Quickfall Abbey. To distract\
  \ himself from ghosts within and without, Gull said, \"If not magic-sniffers, can\
  \ you tell me of Lion Blades?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Why not? Since Lion Blades don't\
  \ officially exist. We serve in the shadows and the light. For it is a dark time\
  \ for Taldor. We Taldans are a mutinous crew on a sinking ship—at each other's throats\
  \ when we need to patch the hull and watch for sharks. Sometimes it's only those\
  \ who do not properly exist who can do what must be done.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Why did\
  \ the admiral and the governor call me a Lion Blade?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, it was\
  \ an understandable error. From their perspective you helped me, so you must be\
  \ one of us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Am I not obviously a minstrel—not a spy?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Tambour chuckled. \"My dear Gull, we recruit from the all the bardic schools\
  \ of this land. Most of us sing quite well. I am a rare exception.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull\
  \ laughed. They were approaching the shipyards, and the lights of the dens of ill-repute\
  \ lightened his spirits. \"If you wore this cloak,\" he said, \"you would no doubt\
  \ believe yourself a fine singer. Just as it made me think I was an adventurer.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Yes, that cloak... At first I thought it a strange tool for an infiltrator.\
  \ Why not a blade? Or something that makes one invisible? But I see now that the\
  \ cloak allows one to enter into any setting and be accepted—in its way, a greater\
  \ power than invisibility.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull said, \"That suggests the agent needed\
  \ to get very close to something... what's wrong?\"</p> \n    <p>Tambour had stopped.\
  \ \"Listen.\"</p> \n    <p>There was a lapping of waters, patter of conversation\
  \ in a nearby tavern, chirping from the marsh.</p> \n    <p>\"I hear nothing.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Exactly. No sound of assault.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Mortil may have fled\
  \ the city.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps... but what you said just now... the Chelish\
  \ agent wanted to get close to something. Perhaps it isn't a target as big as the\
  \ shipyards. Perhaps it's something enclosed. A treasure, a device. Can you think\
  \ of anything else Mortil said?\"</p> \n    <p>Gull could not. Yet his mind was\
  \ twisting something else, as he'd twisted the poem that lay now in his pocket.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>A river swells to spill, dark and rapid through the silent room—</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>He'd awakened that morning startled from a dream, a dream of the music\
  \ of the spheres...</p> \n    <p><i>What if I'd rolled it out, banquet-carpet, banner\
  \ unfolding?</i></p> \n    <p>And what awakened him was a sound of mechanical grinding,\
  \ stamping, booming...</p> \n    <p><i>Dancing dark, shadow-whisper, marked for\
  \ crumpling.</i></p> \n    <p>\"A device...\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Do you know of any mechanical device, Tambour, a large one, inside Grayguard Castle?\
  \ For I've heard such, from the Dog's Teeth.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I do not, Gull. But\
  \ I think we should be going there.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"This is most irregular,\" the castellan of Grayguard said, even as Tambour\
  \ flashed him the governor's ring and led Gull inside the vast grim fortress.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We've had no trouble here,\" the man continued, getting in the pair's\
  \ way.</p> \n    <p>\"We intend to keep it that way,\" Tambour said airily. \"Can\
  \ you point us to the machine?\"</p> \n    <p>Wariness entered the castellan's voice.\
  \ \"What machine?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The one that wakes up drunks in the Dog's Teeth,\"\
  \ put in Gull. When the castellan blinked, Gull added, \"Oh, yes. We have informants\
  \ everywhere.\"</p> \n    <p>Whether it was the cloak or Gull's voice or the governor's\
  \ ring, the castellan gave in. \"There's nothing about the apparatus that need worry\
  \ the crown, Lion Blades.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Show it to us,\" Tambour said.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The castellan muttered to himself, told a guard, \"Send a runner to the\
  \ governor,\" and led Gull and Tambour through a wide, soldier-lined passage into\
  \ the castle courtyard. After passing a magnificent temple dedicated to many gods\
  \ (none of them the being that Mortil had sworn by) they reached the far wall and\
  \ there entered a much smaller passage with a stairway snaking up.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You realize,\" the castellan said, \"the governor is entitled to his personal projects...\"\
  \ He stopped as he nearly stumbled over a dead guard, whose face was frozen in pain\
  \ though he bore no obvious wound.</p> \n    <p>\"No!\" the castellan cried.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Looking up the stairway, the trio beheld more armored corpses.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Summon help,\" Tambour said. \"I will deal with the wizard behind this.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The castle is my responsibility,\" said the man.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That's why you must summon help.\"</p> \n    <p>The castellan hesitated, but Gull\
  \ gave him a curt nod and the man turned and descended, bellowing for guards.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tambour motioned in the direction of the retreating man. \"You too, Gull.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Gull said. \"I'm finishing this.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Is that\
  \ you speaking, or the cloak?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Either way, I do this for Corvine\
  \ Gale.\"</p> \n    <p>Tambour grunted and led the way.</p> \n    <p>The torchlit\
  \ room at the top was stuffed with machinery—or rather with one single machine.\
  \ For a long disoriented moment Gull could not understand the sprawling steel mechanism's\
  \ purpose, but it came to him that the walls of the room were lined with paper and\
  \ books. He saw titles like <i>A True History of House Thrune</i> and <i>The Benefits\
  \ of Infernal Rule for All Chelaxians</i>.</p> \n    <p>\"It's a printing press,\"\
  \ Gull said. He'd seen them before, for his politically minded compatriots back\
  \ in Andoran grew ever more fond of posters and pamphlets and broadsheets. But this\
  \ machine was to a normal printing press as a hydra was to a newt. An octopus of\
  \ hinged arms terminated in presses that seemed poised to hammer out publications\
  \ at a blinding rate. The heart of the mechanism possessed a steel face with eyes\
  \ of blue crystal and a flat, determined expression. It reminded Gull of a bookplate.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yes,\" Mortil said from across the room. The man grasped a tome of\
  \ great thickness, bound in red leather, and Gull suspected no printing press had\
  \ ever touched it. This was surely the stern elder kindred of Corvine's gentle reference\
  \ works: a true book of spells.</p> \n    <p>Mortil continued, \"This <i>thing</i>,\
  \ this apparatus, this is the great weapon Taldor dares aim at Cheliax.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"But it's all merely <i>words</i>,\" Tambour answered, voice full of honest\
  \ confusion. As he spoke crept around the mechanism toward Mortil. \"For that matter,\
  \ it would seem to be words praising Cheliax and its masters.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  'Seems' is the correct term,\" Mortil answered. \"This printing press is producing\
  \ official-seeming works that are to be smuggled into Cheliax. But unlike the approved\
  \ works, these contain ideas that would plant the seeds of sedition.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"You mean,\" guessed Gull, sidling toward Mortil in the opposite direction,\
  \ \"they tell the truth.\"</p> \n    <p>\"'Truth' is hierarchical,\" answered Mortil.\
  \ \"Wizards all understand this, though some may deny the knowledge. Not all revelations\
  \ are appropriate for all people. The common folk need not know every detail about\
  \ the lives of their betters. Certain lies are, for them, better than truth. Only\
  \ Cheliax understands this reality and acts upon it. That's why Cheliax will triumph.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I don't understand,\" Tambour said. \"It's just a printing press.\
  \ With all this effort, you might have thrown our navy into chaos.\"</p> \n    <p>Mortil\
  \ laughed. \"You lack the immortal perspective of our patrons. To you, the struggle\
  \ is all about land and gold. We understand it is equally about thought. This weapon\
  \ here is more significant than any warship. And more insidious. The words it prints,\
  \ though brimming with Chelish pride and patriotism on the surface, magically imbue\
  \ the reader with sentiments quite the opposite. We need to discourage Taldor from\
  \ trying this tactic again. I would come no closer were I you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You're finished, Mortil,\" Gull said. \"You can't kill both of us and destroy the\
  \ printing press all at once.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't need to.\" Mortil cried out\
  \ in a strange tongue Gull did not understand, and the crystal eyes of the printing\
  \ press glowed as it rumbled to life.</p> \n    <p>Inert, it had allowed Gull and\
  \ Tambour just enough room to step around the perimeter; active, its gyrating arms—\
  grabbing paper and bindings, sinking stamps into ink buckets, pounding out text—\
  made hazardous any path to Mortil. The machine was so thunderous Gull could barely\
  \ think. He needed to hug the wall to avoid a concussion and at best could only\
  \ inch his way along.</p> \n    <p>Tambour was in worse shape, having been tripped\
  \ by a metal arm and now lying flat for fear of being beaten with the weight of\
  \ history.</p> \n    <p>Tambour shouted the strange words the wizard has used to\
  \ activate the machine.</p> \n    <p>\"Alas!\" Mortil cried, laughing. \"To shut\
  \ it down takes a different phrase!\"</p> \n    <p>Gull swore.</p> \n    <p>\"That's\
  \ not it!\" Mortil said. \"Now, you've cost me enough time and magic.\" The wizard\
  \ began incanting.</p> \n    <p>Unless the spell was absurdly convoluted, Gull doubted\
  \ he'd reach Mortil in time to stop its casting. However, his movements did bring\
  \ him near a bucket of red ink.</p> \n    <p>It was not so big he couldn't lift\
  \ it—</p> \n    <p>Gull ducked and grabbed and heaved, and red ink spilled across\
  \ the room. Most of it splashed the printing press or the floor, but enough of it\
  \ hit Mortil to distract the wizard and ruin his pages.</p> \n    <p>\"You!\" Spattered\
  \ with red, Mortil looked as though he bled from a thousand paper cuts. \"Whom do\
  \ you work for? Taldor? Andoran? Rebels in Cheliax?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I work for\
  \ a sad, sweet moment on a long winter's day.\" Gull shifted ever closer. \"I work\
  \ for the lumberjacks coming home with too little pay.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\"\
  \ Mortil began a spell, this time one from his own memory—perhaps nothing that could\
  \ destroy the magical press, but surely enough to slay one minstrel with delusions\
  \ of grandeur.</p> \n    <p>Gull kept going. \"I work for the child's laughter and\
  \ the lover's kiss. I work for weeks of sorrow and seconds of bliss.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"You're mad!\"</p> \n    <p>Gull laughed. \"I am Gideon Gull.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Then die, Gideon Gull.\" And Mortil began the words that would make his\
  \ spell complete.</p> \n    <p>And screamed.</p> \n    <p>Sebastian Tambour had\
  \ crawled beneath the swinging limbs of the machine and planted a dagger in Mortil's\
  \ foot.</p> \n    <p>Now Gull reached Mortil, knowing he had just moments to act.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He removed the cloak.</p> \n    <p>Standing there beside the contraption,\
  \ the corsair, and the traitor, Gull suddenly felt frail and foolish, like a mouse\
  \ chasing cats. But he did not falter.</p> \n    <p>He threw the cloak over Mortil's\
  \ head and shoved him into the works.</p> \n    <p>The wizard howled with the pain\
  \ and outrage of being pummeled with the very propaganda of his Chelish masters.\
  \ Yet amazingly, Mortil scrambled free of the machinery and on some blind instinct\
  \ dove for the window.</p> \n    <p>By the time Gull and Tambour could reach that\
  \ location there was only moonlight on the waters outside, and the silvered crags\
  \ of the Dog's Teeth, and no trace of Mortil.</p> \n    <p>The governor of Cassomir\
  \ appeared in the doorway and shouted something in a strange tongue.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ printing press slowed and ceased, and the light faded from its eyes.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"It seems I owe you a great debt, Lion Blades,\" Governor Bozbeyli said in\
  \ the silence that followed, lowering his scimitar. Armored guards beside him looked\
  \ around in wonder.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm just a singing drunk, Governor,\" Gull said,\
  \ looking again toward the Dog's Teeth. He shivered as his body recognized the danger\
  \ was over. \"Not a Lion Blade.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps we should fix that,\" said\
  \ Tambour.</p> \n    <p>\"At any rate,\" the governor said, \"I repay my debts.\
  \ You've exposed a traitor and preserved my little project. What might I do for\
  \ you?\"</p> \n    <p>Tambour smiled. \"I assign my prize to the captain of the\
  \ corsairs. I'm sure he'll think of something.\"</p> \n    <p>The governor frowned\
  \ a little, but eventually nodded. \"And you?\"</p> \n    <p>Gull began to refuse\
  \ any reward, but he withdrew Corvine's poem from his pocket, stared at it. \"This\
  \ printing press...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes?\"</p> \n    <p>Gull smiled and held out\
  \ Corvine's poem. \"What I ask is that you print enough copies to make the author\
  \ of this poem, one Corvine Gayle, well known in Cassomir and Oppara and beyond.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Governor Bozbeyli took the poem. \"Corvine Gayle. Ah, the young lady\
  \ from the birthday party. Yes, it shall be done.\"</p> \n    <p>As the minstrel\
  \ and the man in motley took their leave of the governor and walked through the\
  \ castle courtyard, Gull watched the constellations and heard Tambour's voice as\
  \ if from a great distance. \"I have two questions.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I was in earnest, Gull. You could join us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm no\
  \ corsair. I'm a singing—\"</p> \n    <p>\"A singing drunk.\" Tambour laughed. \"\
  Yes, I know. That's why we are visiting the Knotty Mermaid. But it's also why I\
  \ bring up the Lion Blades.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You know I'm no bard.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You could become one. We could ensure you are enrolled in an appropriate school...\
  \ and an appropriate Shadow School at the same time.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull did not\
  \ even bother to ask what that meant. \"I'm not a Taldan man, Tambour. I'm Andoren.\
  \ More so now than ever.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yet you've seen what Andoran and Taldor\
  \ face together. We have our differences. But if you stand with us, you'll stand\
  \ with civilization, against whatever it is that Cheliax represents.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Verses came to Gull's mind. He wondered if that would happen more and more,\
  \ now that he'd left the Dog's Teeth behind. He hoped so.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>I'm halfway down the road to dead</i><br> <i>But woman you have cleared\
  \ my head</i><br> <i>And now the best that I can see</i><br> <i>Is to make me worthy\
  \ of thee.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p></p> \n    <p>\"The college,\" Gull\
  \ said. \"Just the college, for now. We can speak again about the rest. In a year.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Tambour nodded.</p> \n    <p><i>And I'm busy with the living</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They left the castle, passed the barbershop, entered the muddy streets\
  \ of Admiral's Fen. Gull said, \"You said you had two questions.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Will you see her again?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ask that also in a year, Tambour. For now,\
  \ I am not worthy, or ready.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Much can happen in a year. She may\
  \ be someone else's then.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull shot him a look. \"You?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Tambour shrugged.</p> \n    <p>\"Love is risk, sir,\" Gull said stiffly.\
  \ \"I would not burden her with the man I am now. But the man who returns in a year—\
  perhaps.\"</p> \n    <p><i>To the wild corners of the page and back again.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tambour laughed as they reached the threshold of the Knotty Mermaid.\
  \ \"You are ever the hopeless romantic, aren't you, Gideon Gull?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No. There is always hope.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
