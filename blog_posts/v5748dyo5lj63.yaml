  description\">After what seems to be some harrowing experiences, the Order of the\
  \ Amber Die completed the second adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy9l3g\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #110: The Thrushmoor Terror</em></a>, in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> in yet another marathon session. I'm going to\
  \ keep this short and let them tell their tales. Be sure to check out the links\
  \ at the bottom of this post to read more about their experience with this Adventure\
  \ Path. Beware, players! Spoilers below!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The second\
  \ adventure in an Adventure Path is always an important one, as patterns begin to\
  \ emerge in the way the party performs, and we look to build momentum early in the\
  \ AP. We spent the marathon as amnesiacs slowly piecing together the clues of a\
  \ mystery while working alongside investigators from the Sleepless Agency, and we\
  \ dabbled into the <em>True Detective</em> soundtrack to give us ambiance throughout\
  \ 67 hours of play. Since there was so much role-playing involved, our GM brought\
  \ one of the best actors in the Order down from NYC to play some of the slick-tongued\
  \ cultists we encountered, and also tapped another member for the role of Winter\
  \ Klaczka where appropriate.</p> \n     <p>As the facts surrounding our amnesia\
  \ were uncovered, it turned out that each of us had a nefarious past. Erasmus had\
  \ shady friends showing up who expected us to recognize them, while Quinn had once\
  \ started a bar fight defending the honor of his boyfriend. Even securing lodging\
  \ was a challenge in this adventure. To thoroughly immerse ourselves in the stormy\
  \ town of Thrushmoor, we mixed fog machines with a 24-square-foot setup of 3D buildings,\
  \ and some structures were even specific to the town itself. We also had a couple\
  \ of Lazzaretti's maps remastered by <a href=\"http://www.axionstudio.com/#about\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Axion Studios</a> and printed for play.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \  <ul>\n      <li>We're clicking as a unit more than many other parties we've had.\
  \ The players all selected a teamwork feat to suit their needs in this path: Shake\
  \ It Off. In our standard 2-by-2 formation, everyone gets a +3 to all saving throws,\
  \ and it's made the difference on 12 saves already.</li> \n      <li>Our GM doesn't\
  \ pull punches. Travelling back from Caliphas, he rolled up a marsh giant as a random\
  \ encounter at a waterlogged farmstead—and threw it at a 4th level party. We are\
  \ veterans of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer\">Giantslayer</a>\
  \ after all.</li> \n      <li>They say defense wins championships. During a 2-hour\
  \ grinder against an evil druid and her fungal wolves, our 5th level party healed\
  \ over 200 hit points, with 36 of those coming from Erasmus's seance boon alone—\
  and defense prevailed.</li> \n      <li>We awarded Daji the MVP for this module.\
  \ The fox was on fire from the opening minutes: He picked up his sixth kill of the\
  \ campaign, used his knowledge skills to identify the critical weakness of a foe\
  \ that would likely have defeated us, located the secret door that led us to the\
  \ final encounter early, The crowning moment was when the fox leaped onto an abomination\
  \ known as a byakhee and engaged it with everything he had, despite the creature\
  \ biting Daji into negative hit points.</li> \n      <li>Something is wrong with\
  \ Quinn, and it's stacking more horror onto this already scary AP. In the asylum\
  \ he suffered horribly at the hands of ghouls—and despite being raised twice—he\
  \ possesses an insatiable hunger. Quinn's skin is becoming thicker, and he smells\
  \ so much like rot that it sickens anyone around him. Our companion has torn through\
  \ our food reserves, and we sometimes catch him eating when he should be sleeping.\
  \ We've tried everything from <i>remove curse</i> to <i>remove disease</i>, yet\
  \ nothing works.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>The Experiment</h2> \n     <ul>\n      <li>We already\
  \ track a lot of data across each Adventure Path, but we've had to add a new category\
  \ that is very unfamiliar to us: Battles Run From. Ten so far. The team doesn't\
  \ like to talk about it.</li> \n      <li>One of our strangest moments in this module\
  \ involved an interaction with something called an \"Elder Thing.\" Two of them\
  \ actually, and our GM swears that's the real name. They weren't immediately hostile,\
  \ but we couldn't tell whether we should introduce ourselves or slay them. Then\
  \ they spoke!</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <ul>\n  \
  \    <li>An assassin, Risi Nairgon, stalked the party around Thrushmoor, seizing\
  \ our vulnerable moments to strike and get away. After tailing us to a safehouse,\
  \ she patiently waited on a rooftop for the party to emerge the next morning—sans\
  \ buffs. Despite sniper's fatigue, she scored a direct hit with a Death Attack on\
  \ Alahazra: one shot, one kill.</li> \n      <li>Three natural 1s on fear saving\
  \ throws left Quinn alone facing a Manananggal—a vampiric horror we had yet to see\
  \ in 138 modules. We could hear his screams while we ran.</li>\n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 2</h2> \n     <p><i>Cesadia Wrentz</i> (lead detective):\
  \ \"How many people saw you carrying a body through town?\"<br> <i>Feiya</i>: \"\
  Now? Or ever?\"</p> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <p>Quinn's affliction\
  \ doesn't bode well, but we'll keep trying for a cure. Good detective work has us\
  \ hot on the heels of our quarry and headed south to piece together what our memories\
  \ cannot. Alahazra and Quinn are a bit behind in XP, but this is made up for with\
  \ author Tito Leati's generous amount of treasure awarded to those with the patience\
  \ to look.</p> \n     <h2>More Content</h2> \n     <p>Read through the entirety\
