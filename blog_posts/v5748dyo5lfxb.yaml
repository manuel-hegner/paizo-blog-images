  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Wendy N. Wagner</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Up the Mountain</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Jendara\
  \ moved through the dense forest, following Irlu as the tracker floated through\
  \ the bracken and brush. Jendara was an able tracker; the dark-haired Blackraven\
  \ made her look like a novice. Despite the hill giant's size and ungainly burden—\
  Lugh stood six and a half feet tall—the creature had left little spoor. It might\
  \ be huge and ungainly, but the giant clearly knew the woods.</span></p> \n    <p>\"\
  Irlu will find him.\" Grotnir's voice was a soft rumble from behind Jendara. She\
  \ glanced over her shoulder to see his face. She hadn't noticed the gray in his\
  \ beard earlier.</p> \n    <p>Jendara watched the woman pick a flake of lichen off\
  \ a branch and look closely at it. \"She's a great tracker.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The\
  \ best I've ever worked with. And she doesn't give up. She'll comb these hills all\
  \ night, if that's what it takes. He's Caul's brother, so he's as good as her own.\"\
  </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_WintersWolves_WinterWolf.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_WintersWolves_WinterWolf_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>There's nothing natural about white wolves.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p> </p>\n    <p>He caught the questioning look on Jendara's face. \"Irlu's\
  \ family was killed when she was just a little girl. She's never said what happened\
  \ to them. A Blackraven patrol found her in the woods, surviving on her own.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>No wonder Irlu had joined the prestigious border guard. And to have survived\
  \ at such a young age in these woods—here, so close to the Irriseni border, where\
  \ creatures like giants and white wolves were a constant threat—only made Jendara's\
  \ admiration for the woman grow.</p> \n    <p>They moved through the forest in silence\
  \ for a few minutes, crossing a stream at the bottom of a steep ravine and then\
  \ climbing up again. They'd left behind any trace of loggers or hunters long ago:\
  \ this was wild country, a rough and uninviting wilderness. Even the trees looked\
  \ shorter here, their trunks twisted and wind-battered.</p> \n    <p>\"I have a\
  \ son a little younger than Lugh,\" Grotnir said, suddenly. He leaned against a\
  \ tree for a moment. \"He wants to join the Blackravens.\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara\
  \ caught something in his tone. \"And you don't want him to?\"</p> \n    <p>He shook\
  \ his head. \"He's a good man, but no warrior. He'd make a fine smith or farmer,\
  \ but I can't tell him that. Not after hearing Blackraven stories all his life.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jendara picked a bit of moss out of the end of her braided hair. \"\
  I have a son myself. He's ten.\"</p> \n    <p>He reached out and caught her hand,\
  \ pulling it close to study the tattoo. \"And do you want him to follow in your\
  \ footsteps?\" He tapped the inked spot. \"Besmara is a cruel goddess.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She pulled her hand away. \"You know her sign.\"</p> \n    <p>He shrugged.\
  \ \"I've known a pirate or two. Bad men, all of them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We'll lose\
  \ Irlu if we don't get a move on.\" She pushed past him without making eye contact.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He was right, of course. There were good reasons she wasn't a pirate\
  \ anymore, and her boy was only one of them. But that didn't mean she'd apologize\
  \ for it.</p> \n    <p>Irlu picked up her pace, and after a few moments, Jendara\
  \ understood why. They were following some kind of game trail that snaked up the\
  \ steep hillside. There was very little ground cover here, and bits of broken rock\
  \ and debris marked the paths of long-ago landslides. The trail ran between little\
  \ heaps of scree and dead leaves, looking well used.</p> \n    <p>Irlu hesitated\
  \ and looked back over her shoulder. \"I don't like this.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\"\
  \ Grotnir asked.</p> \n    <p>\"There's no sign of the giant anymore. I don't know\
  \ how she lost us, but she has. We're only following the wolf.\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara\
  \ frowned. \"But the wolf didn't have Lugh.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I think it does now.\"\
  \ Irlu squatted. \"I've seen a couple of scrape marks alongside the trail. I think\
  \ it's probably Lugh's boots, dragging as the wolf carries him. I don't know when\
  \ they switched off. Before they left the tree cover, certainly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Why didn't you say something sooner?\" Jendara snapped.</p> \n    <p>\"I wasn't\
  \ sure.\" Irlu paused to cough. This walk uphill after breathing as much smoke as\
  \ she had—it couldn't be good for her. She cleared her throat. \"They're planning\
  \ something.\"</p> \n    <p>A sudden rumble made them all turn to stare up the hill.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Move!\" Grotnir bellowed. A massive boulder bounced down the rocky\
  \ slope, stirring up clouds of dust.</p> \n    <p>Jendara grabbed Irlu's hand and\
  \ pulled her off the trail. They skidded for a second before Irlu caught a scraggly\
  \ brush and stopped their descent. The boulder careened past them, hitting a stony\
  \ outcropping and exploding into shards.</p> \n    <p>\"Merciful Desna,\" Irlu breathed.\
  \ Then she doubled over in a coughing fit.</p> \n    <p>\"Too much dust.\" Jendara\
  \ fumbled in her belt pouch for a handkerchief and offered it to the tracker. \"\
  We can probably expect more of that.\"</p> \n    <p>Another boulder, much smaller,\
  \ soared out over their heads, landing a few feet beyond the remains of the other.\
  \ It bounced down the hillside and disappeared into the trees.</p> \n    <p>\"Now\
  \ we know where the giant went,\" Grotnir said. \"How the hell are we going to make\
  \ it up to the top of this hill? Except for this game trail, it's all rock ahead.\
  \ Not a bit of cover.\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara studied the terrain, then pointed out\
  \ a thin, tall larch that somehow clung to the steep rocks of the hill. The game\
  \ trail ran away from the tree as it headed up the hill's soft flank on the other\
  \ side. \"There's a chimney in the rock about halfway up the slope. If I shinny\
  \ up that tree, I can jump to it and make my way to the top. That's got to be where\
  \ the giant is.\"</p> \n    <p>Irlu's eyes widened. \"Climb that? You're crazy.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jendara grinned. \"I'm a sailor. Climbing is what I do.\" She eyed\
  \ the vertical crevice again and took off her sword—she didn't want to risk getting\
  \ caught in the narrow gap. \"Just give me a few minutes' head start.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Keeping low to the ground, she ran to the larch and scrambled up into its\
  \ branches, which were thin, weak, and few. Despite her bravado, she felt her stomach\
  \ twist. It was one thing to climb a stout oak mast, but this tree wasn't much thicker\
  \ than her ankle. She'd better hope her luck held.</p> \n    <p>The trunk narrowed\
  \ and began to lean. Jendara bit down on the inside of her cheek and eyed the rocks.\
  \ There was a sequence of ledges leading up to the chimney—she ought to be able\
  \ to jump onto one. She closed her eyes for a second and leaped.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ caught the rock with her fingertips and felt her boots skid before she steadied.\
  \ She grunted. It would have been a nervous shriek if she didn't know the giant\
  \ was someplace over her head. But after a moment, she pulled herself up to the\
  \ next ledge and slipped into the jagged crack. She was glad she'd left her sword\
  \ behind. The rocks pressed tight against her body—but that actually helped her.\
  \ She braced her palms against the rock and pushed herself upward.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ ribbon of sunlight ran down the narrow gap between the rocks. Jendara felt as\
  \ if the light itself pulled her up the tiny space. She kept her eyes fixed on the\
  \ glittering bit of sunshine, filling her mind with its brilliance and not her precarious\
  \ position.</p> \n    <p>Suddenly, the ribbon of light went dark.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ guttural voice boomed down the tube. Jendara craned her neck. Something blocked\
  \ the top of the crevice. The giant, peering down at her. She could smell its filthy\
  \ stink. Her heart thudded in her chest.</p> \n    <p>The giant pulled back and\
  \ Jendara climbed faster. Then suddenly the huge voice bellowed in pain. Jendara\
  \ threw herself up out of the crevice just as volley of arrows peppered the stones.\
  \ Jendara pressed herself to the ground. Irlu must have raced up that hill while\
  \ Jendara was in the tree.</p> \n    <p>The arrow storm paused. Down below, a cold\
  \ voice shouted. Jendara couldn't make out the words, but she knew that voice. They'd\
  \ found the wolf.</p> \n    <p>The giant was peering over the edge of the hilltop\
  \ once more. The ground here was wind-scoured rock, dotted here and there with lichen-dappled\
  \ boulders and rocks—the perfect lookout for an ambush.</p> \n    <p>Jendara got\
  \ to her feet and drew her handaxe just as the giant spun around to face her. An\
  \ arrow jutted out of the creature's arm, but it didn't seem to notice anymore.\
  \ Its piggy eyes narrowed and it roared in rage, then pulled back its leg and kicked\
  \ a chunk of rock at Jendara.</p> \n    <p>She threw herself aside, but the rock\
  \ still hit her shoulder, jolting her hard enough to make her teeth rattle. The\
  \ giant snatched up another rock.</p> \n    <p>Anger boiled up inside her. She charged\
  \ the creature, dropping low at the last second and chopping into its kneecap with\
  \ a crunch. The giant screamed. Jendara wrenched the axe free and shoved against\
  \ the thing's hip. It stumbled backward.</p> \n    <p>For a second, its arms windmilled\
  \ and it balanced at the very edge of the cliff. Then it flew backward. There was\
  \ a thud as it hit the ground, just missing Grotnir as he rushed the white wolf.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The wolf bit into his hand, and Grotnir bellowed in pain. He wrenched\
  \ himself free and stumbled away. Arrows streaked toward the wolf, and the creature\
  \ retreated beyond Jendara's limited view. She glanced around herself. She had to\
  \ get down off this hilltop, and she didn't have time to risk the crevice.</p> \n\
  \    <p>A mound of dirt caught her eye, and she hurried toward it. This side of\
  \ the hill wasn't half as steep, and she could see the giant's footprints in the\
  \ dirt. She followed them down and around the hillside. A few feet ahead, Grotnir's\
  \ green cloak stood out against the rocky outcropping he was sheltering behind.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jendara sank down behind a larch sapling. A few dozen yards beyond Grotnir,\
  \ Irlu was creeping uphill. Jendara followed Irlu's gaze up the hill, beyond the\
  \ sprawled corpse of the giant. A dark slit stood out against the rocks making up\
  \ the hill, a horizontal version of the crevice Jendara climbed up. That had to\
  \ be the wolf's den.</p> \n    <p>If Lugh was still alive, he was almost certainly\
  \ in that cave.</p> \n    <p>She sprang up from her cover and burst into a run.\
  \ It wouldn't be expecting a head-on charge, not from her, and this would distract\
  \ from Irlu's stealthy approach. She realized she was bellowing like a berserk raider,\
  \ but couldn't make herself stop.</p> \n    <p>The wolf burst out of the cave, snarling.\
  \ Its teeth flashed as it lunged toward her, and for a second she feared its ice\
  \ breath attack, but her handaxe was already slamming down on its face. The blade\
  \ bit into fur and meat. The creature twisted aside, ripping the blade free with\
  \ a splatter of blood.</p> \n    <p>But Jendara hadn't lost her grip on the weapon.\
  \ She rolled under the beast's counterattack, her knees grinding into the broken\
  \ gravel of the cave's entrance. The white wolf shrieked in sudden desperate pain.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She didn't pause to wonder why, just pushed herself up, slamming into\
  \ the beast's belly and sending it flying. It fell on the rocks beside the dead\
  \ giant. Blood trickled out of its mouth, and an arrow jutted out of its ribs. Irlu\
  \ crept toward it.</p> \n    <p>\"Finish me, Blackraven,\" it gurgled. \"Like you\
  \ finished my mate.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm no Blackraven,\" Jendara spat.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"But I am.\" Irlu jammed her knife into the wolf's blue eye. The wolf convulsed\
  \ once and went still. Irlu grinned savagely, and then a coughing fit made her double\
  \ up as well.</p> \n    <p>\"Irlu! Are you all right?\" Grotnir ran to her. His\
  \ arm hung limply at his side, blood running down his fingers.</p> \n    <p>Jendara\
  \ turned away from them and hurried inside the shallow cave. \"Lugh?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>A groan answered her. She couldn't make out his face in the dim light, but\
  \ the sound was comforting. \"You okay?\"</p> \n    <p>\"My head hurts.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"At least you didn't hurt anything important.\" She found his shoulders\
  \ and began dragging him out into the light. He chuckled once, then groaned with\
  \ pain again. When he was out of the cave, his skull bloody and knotted but still\
  \ intact, Jendara sat down beside him and stretched out her legs.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You know,\" she said, \"you have a lot more of this to look forward to once you\
  \ become a Blackraven.\"</p> \n    <p>Lugh chuckled again, then touched his head.\
  \ \"Like you said, no one ever said my brain is my best feature.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Still,\" Jendara said, \"you have to admit this was more interesting than hunting\
  \ a bunch of ducks.\"</p> \n    <p>At the entrance of the cave, Irlu laughed. \"\
  Jendara, are you <i>sure</i> you're not a Blackraven?\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara grinned.\
  \ She was pretty sure that was a compliment.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want\
