  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Each wave of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/deepCuts\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles Deep Cuts</em></a> unpainted plastic miniatures comes with\
  \ both monsters and player character-appropriate figures, usually around a shared\
  \ theme. Each blister pack of characters comes with two figures—one low- and one\
  \ high-level—which can either represent the same character across his or her career\
  \ or two completely different adventurers. The ancestry featured in July's release\
  \ wave is none other than gnomes, specifically gnome spellcasters.</p> \n    <p>Gnomes\
  \ are a miniature painter's dream, in no small part because they're small minis,\
  \ so they don't use up a lot of paint, but also because they come in every color\
  \ you can imagine. The sample painted renders depicted below are pretty conservative\
  \ with their hair color choices, but you can paint them whatever hue catches your\
  \ fancy, and repaint them when the gnome's mercurial fey blood leads them to change\
  \ that hair color mid-campaign. First we have the <a href=\"/products/btpya154?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Male-Bard\"\
  >male gnome bard</a>. A world-renowned musician, this character has a version with\
  \ and without his short sword (and different armor), but he never goes anywhere\
  \ without his harp!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180430-MaleGnomeBard.jpg\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180430-MaleGnomeBard2.jpg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>Joining the bard is the fellow arcane caster, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya153?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Female-Sorcerer\"\
  >female gnome sorcerer</a>. She’s got two spell effects sculpted into her figures,\
  \ which can be customized to be flames, lightning, acid, or whatever you need them\
  \ to be with a simple ink wash. If you’re fine with her clothes changing, she could\
  \ even represent the same character casting two different spells, getting swapped\
  \ out for one another in the middle of combat.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >\n    </div> \n    <p>Turning to a more natural set of spellcasters, we have the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpya152?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Male-Druid\"\
  >male</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpya14v?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Gnome-Female-Druid\"\
  >female gnome druids</a>. Like the sorcerer, they all have clear plastic spell effects\
  \ (including <i>call lightning</i> and <i>produce flame</i>, it looks like). One\
  \ of my favorite aspects of the druids and sorcerer is that they could also serve\
  \ as members of just about any spellcasting class, from arcanist to wizard. There's\
  \ no reason you can't use the sorcerer above as a druid (just put her in a green\
  \ robe; that's what makes someone a druid, right?) or the druids below as sorcerers.</p>\
