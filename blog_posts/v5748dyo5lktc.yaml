  \ to Paizo's 2018 team for the Gauntlet charity tournament. Team Paizo fought hard\
  \ in Tak, but a catastrophic Valeria round tumbled us towards the bottom, and we\
  \ clawed our way back up to 11th, and almost as high as 8th, with an awesome performance\
  \ on the final Puzzle Hunt round. Thanks to all of you, including an incredible\
  \ last-minute donation over $1,000, we also unlocked an astonishing number of blog\
  \ segments revealing further secrets about previously blogged classes. This will\
  \ be a monster-length blog, so strap in for a long ride!</p> \n    <h2>Fighter Combos:\
  \ Randyll and Solveig<br> <small><i>Luis Loza</i></small></h2> \n    <p>I've always\
  \ been a big fan of martial characters, which was fully solidified by one of my\
  \ favorite characters, who happened to be a fighter. One of the big things I love\
  \ about the fighter in Pathfinder is his ability to do just about anything in combat.\
  \ With the right set of feats, a fighter can be anything from a typical sword and\
  \ shield-wielding knight, to a spear master who leaps across the battlefield to\
  \ defend his allies, to a light-footed master of the rapier. When I got a chance\
  \ to join one of the playtest games here in the office, my first thought was to\
  \ put this new fighter to the test. A lot of it felt the same, as the fighter was\
  \ gaining lots of feats, but it turns out there was much more to the fighter this\
  \ time around.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkm9?Fighter-Class-Preview\"\
  >Fighter Class Preview</a> previewed several fighter feats and class features, but\
  \ one thing it didn't mention was fighters' ability to string together attacks to\
  \ make powerful combinations. They do this through abilities that let them Fan attack\
  \ or press the offensive—abilities with the open trait must come before any other\
  \ attacks, and those with the press trait must come after you've already made an\
  \ attack. Fighters can also enter stances, which are one of the most common types\
  \ of open abilities, and grant various powerful benefits for the duration of the\
  \ encounter or until you enter another stance. A bastard sword switch-hitter can\
  \ appreciate the debuff potential of following up an Intimidating Strike (which\
  \ is neither an open nor a press ability) with Shatter Defenses, a press ability\
  \ that stacks various penalties on an intimidated foe, or Combat Grab, a press ability\
  \ that uses your open hand to grab a foe and simultaneously attack with the weapon\
  \ in the other hand. Between those options and your ability to make your opponents\
  \ flat-footed with critical hits, you can significantly reduce the AC of monsters\
  \ so your lower-accuracy allies can take them down. With all of these new abilities\
  \ in mind, I created my first fighter, Randyll. He was a master of the bastard sword\
  \ with a penchant for yelling and rushing into combat. He would use the versatility\
  \ of his bastard sword to his advantage, switching between a one-handed grip and\
  \ a two-handed grip to use whichever feat was best for the situation, granting him\
  \ a surprising amount of versatility.</p> \n    <p>Unfortunately, due to his recklessness,\
  \ Randyll was not long for Golarion. In his place, I created Solveig, an Ulfen shield\
  \ maiden entirely dedicated to defending her allies. She's fared even better. A\
  \ shield fighter with a flail is all about careful tactical placement on the battlefield.\
  \ If you're standing in the right spot, you can block for your allies with Shield\
  \ Warden, and the flail critical specialization effect of knocking enemies prone\
  \ can keep enemies right where you want them, even on an open battlefield. With\
  \ Shielded Stride, you can even Stride at half speed with your shield up, ignoring\
  \ reactions that trigger off your movement. The Shield Paragon stance is an open\
  \ ability that gives you the benefit of a raised shield for the rest of the battle,\
  \ an extremely powerful advantage. Solveig is a complete shift from Randyll's combat\
  \ style. Her movement is calculated and her defense is unmatched (at least by the\
  \ rest of the party!). By the time she had avoided close to 10 attacks in a row,\
  \ I was in love with the fighter. I had found that same feeling that I had in Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition and I could tell that there were so many possibilities with different\
  \ weapons, armor types, and of course, all the new fighter feats. But there are\
  \ so many amazing feats—how can your fighter take all the ones he wants? And how\
  \ do you make sure you have the one you need for the day's adventure? The fighter's\
  \ 9th-level Flexibility feat grants a different feat each day, and that increases\
  \ to two flexible feats with Improved Flexibility at 15th level. This also means\
  \ that, counting those two flexible feats, fighters have the most class feats in\
  \ the game! Let me just say that playing the fighter in the playtest has only further\
  \ solidified my love for the class. The fighter is awesome and continues to be awesome\
  \ in Pathfinder Second Edition. In fact, if I were told I could play only fighters\
  \ for the duration of the playtest, I would be happy. There's so much the fighter\
  \ can do that I don't see myself running out of ideas any time soon!</p> \n    <h2>Cleric\
  \ Domains of the Mox Gauntlet<br> <small><i>Andrew White</i></small></h2> \n   \
  \ <p>Thanks so much to everyone who helped us get this far! Your generosity is hugely\
  \ appreciated, and we did our best to represent you accordingly at this weekend's\
  \ showdown. And as a special reward to those of you who made your donations in the\
  \ name of Team Cleric, here's a sneak peek at more of what's coming for everyone's\
  \ favorite energy channelling, undead-neutralizing, wound-healing bludgeon enthusiasts!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If the Mox Gauntlet was a deity, what domains would it have? A gauntlet\
  \ is a symbol of Might, the donations are a form of Wealth, the charity this year\
  \ helps Families, and each year there's usually a final round shrouded in Secrecy.\
  \ So let's talk about the domain powers that a cleric of the Gauntlet might be able\
  \ to cast. The <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkqb?Cleric-Class-Preview\">Cleric\
  \ Class Preview</a> already included <i>unity</i>, but the Family domain also has\
  \ the basic power <i>soothing words</i>, which dispels emotion effects on a target;\
  \ this is actually extremely strong because as a power, it's always heightened to\
  \ your highest possible level. This means it's quite tricky to keep up emotion effects\
  \ on a Family cleric's allies, and you'll probably never need to prepare <i>remove\
  \ fear</i>. Might has two options that are really good for heavily armored and high-Strength\
  \ clerics. The basic power <i>athletic exploit </i>lets you ignore your armor's\
  \ check penalty and movement speed reduction when you really need to, and <i>enduring\
  \ might </i>is a reaction that reduces damage based on your Strength modifier and\
  \ your cleric level. The Secrecy domain has <i>forced quiet</i>, which limits the\
  \ target's voice to a hoarse whisper, making it much harder to raise an alarm. Even\
  \ a successful save against <i>forced quiet </i>still affects the target for 1 round\
  \ (though the effect might last as long as 10 minutes on a critical failure!). Secrecy's\
  \ advanced domain power, <i>safeguard secret</i>, has a 1-minute casting time but\
  \ thereafter grants you and all willing allies in range an enormous conditional\
  \ bonus to skill checks (almost always Deception) to conceal a specific secret you\
  \ pick, and to saving throws against spells that seek to ferret out that specific\
  \ secret. These benefits last indefinitely until you use the spell again. Finally,\
  \ Wealth's basic power, <i>acquisitive's fortune</i>, is sure to make you popular\
  \ with every business owner in the city and with allies who like to make money during\
  \ downtime. Once cast, it allows the target to reroll any critical failure on their\
  \ check to Perform a Trade in the next 24 hours. As the name implies, it's a fortune\
  \ effect. The domain's advanced power, <i>money talks</i>, allows you to substitute\
  \ coin currency for any sort of cost with a value measured in monetary value. So\
  \ for instance, if you needed a vase worth 100 gp, you could just use 100 gp. This\
  \ is particularly handy when you're away from a settlement and suddenly need a bizarre\
  \ item for a cost that you wouldn't have thought to bring along; the Wealth cleric\
  \ has you covered.</p> \n    <h2>The Rogue's Hidden Tricks<br> <small><i>Katina\
  \ Davis</i></small></h2> \n    <p>Although I'm not particularly stealthy in real\
  \ life, I've always enjoyed rogues and their stealthy ways because I figured they\
  \ were most like how I would actually behave in an adventure setting. Instead of\
  \ barreling headfirst into a fight and counting on being able to chug a bunch of\
  \ potions afterward, the rogue is more calm, calculated, and precise. What's the\
  \ point in drawing attention (and attacks) to yourself when you can tiptoe in, get\
  \ the job done, and sneak away unscathed? Never let your opponents know how strong\
  \ you are, and they will always underestimate you.</p> \n    <p>Even after the <a\
  \ href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkn4?Rogue-Class-Preview\">Rogue Class Preview</a>,\
  \ the rogue was hiding some of her sneakiest tricks. What did you expect? One thing\
  \ about the rogue that's different than in Pathfinder First Edition is the rogue's\
  \ focus on slippery mental defenses. In addition to the Cognitive Loophole feat\
  \ mentioned in her preview blog, the rogue gains the slippery mind ability, which\
  \ makes her a master at Will saves. Add in double debilitation, the ability to apply\
  \ two debilitations to a foe at once, and you have a good sense of the rogue's odd-level\
  \ features. But there are so many feats still hiding in the shadows. While the first\
  \ blog focused on ways to get sneak attack, the rogue also has some fun ways to\
  \ play with the action economy, including drawing and attacking with a weapon as\
  \ a single action, or Stepping and Striking at a -1 penalty with the same action\
  \ (in either order, perfect for flanking, entering reach, or forcing your foe to\
  \ take an action to reach you). The rogue also has a pair of feats that allow her\
  \ to poison weapons more easily, keep her poisons from being wasted, and create\
  \ a bunch of doses of a very simple poison for free each day (this also works great\
  \ with an alchemist on the team to make some really powerful poison for free every\
  \ day). For those interested in traps, you can gain Trap Finder, which makes finding\
  \ even the most devious traps easier and protects you against them, and Delay Trap,\
  \ which can give you the time you need to escape the area when you accidentally\
  \ set off a trap. However, unlike in Pathfinder First Edition, engaging with traps\
  \ as a rogue is your choice.</p> \n    <p>All right, those feats were cool, but\
  \ what about some high-level options? Sense the Unseen is a reaction you can use\
  \ when you Seek that lets you automatically learn the location of unseen creatures\
  \ in the area, no matter how well they were hidden. You still can't see them, but\
  \ it's a good start! Cloud Step allows you to step so lightly that you are essentially\
  \ weightless when you are Striding, allowing you to walk over water or air and avoiding\
  \ pressure plates until you finish moving. Perfect Distraction allows you to use\
  \ smoke and mirrors, decoys, and other tactics to make it seem like you are somewhere\
  \ you aren't, perfect for leaving a decoy right after you hide. If you have Legendary\
  \ Deception, you can even gain Reactive Distraction and use the decoy as a reaction\
  \ to avoid an enemy's attack or other ability. Afterward, it takes a bit of time\
  \ to set up your next decoy, but it's worth it! Trickster's Ace lets you jury-rig\
  \ magic item resonance and stolen magical energy to set up your own magical contingency\
  \ each day, similar to the spell. And finally, Hidden Paragon lets you go completely\
  \ invisible, even beyond the sight of <i>true seeing</i>, <i>see invisibility </i>and\
  \ the like and impossible to outline with even <i>glitterdust</i>, <i>faerie fire</i>,\
  \ or similar magic!</p> \n    <h2>Take That, Evil!<br> <small><i>Mark Seifter</i></small></h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkrq?Paladin-Class-Preview\">Paladin\
  \ Class Preview</a> was centered around alignment and the paladin code, with some\
  \ extra helpings of spells, healing, and defenses, but there's more to paladin options\
  \ than that. Sometimes you just want to put on your Gauntlet and beat evil down.\
  \ So, this section is all about offense. Retributive Strike, first mentioned in\
  \ the paladin blog, is a good way to add onto your damage while enfeebling enemies\
  \ that dare to attack your allies, and all paladins have access to it at 1st level.\
  \ Another ability all paladins receive is the righteous ally, a holy spirit that\
  \ assists you from 3rd level on. There are three righteous allies to choose from\
  \ (and you can take the Second Ally feat to gain another): blade, shield, and mount.\
  \ Naturally, the blade righteous ally is the most offense-focused of the three,\
  \ inhabiting your weapon (which you are free to change each day), and giving it\
  \ the benefits of a property rune for the whole day. This starts with some simple\
  \ properties like <i>disrupting </i>and <i>ghost touch</i>, but you can use feats\
  \ to gain the benefits of more powerful runes; for instance, you can make your weapon\
  \ <i>dancing</i>, allowing the spirit in your blade to attack on its own. The first\
  \ major blade righteous ally feat is Blade of Justice, which is parallel to the\
  \ Pathfinder First Edition paladin's smite evil—you declare a target to face judgment\
  \ and deal extra damage to evil foes. Although Blade of Justice deals less damage\
  \ than smite evil, it can be used as many times as you like as long as you have\
  \ the actions for it. And the real kicker is that this extra damage is good damage,\
  \ which means that creatures like fiends that are weak against good abilities are\
  \ going to take a lot more damage.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of how offense-focused\
  \ paladins can wreck fiends, there's also Aura of Faith, a feat that makes nearby\
  \ good allies' first attacks each turn deal 1 extra good damage against evil creatures\
  \ (and of course, this can become quite a bit higher when applying a fiend's weakness!).\
  \ But there's also a smiting ability every paladin gets that can ruin a fiend's\
  \ day. Holy Smite deals persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier to\
  \ evil creatures you hit with any Retributive Strike, which can apply extra damage\
  \ round after round if the creature has a weakness to good. Instrument of Zeal is\
  \ the last in the series of badass offensive abilities for the blade righteous ally:\
  \ when you score a critical hit with your weapon, either with a Retributive Strike\
  \ or against your Blade of Justice target, you gain an additional die of damage\
  \ and the target is slowed 1 on its next turn, which can put it in a really tight\
  \ spot! There's another fun way every paladin can increase a party's offense, particularly\
  \ if the group stands in a tactical formation. Aura of justice is a class feature\
  \ all paladins get that allows you to take a penalty to any Retributive Strike in\
  \ order to allow all allies within 10 feet and in reach of the monster to make Retributive\
  \ Strikes of their own! If you find your group often uses this to create a mega-chain\
  \ reaction, you can later take the Aura of Vengeance feat to remove that extra penalty\
  \ when you use aura of justice.</p> \n    <h3>Behold the Gauntlet!</h3> \n    <p>The\
  \ <i>Gauntlet</i> is a powerful magic item fought over by champions since ages long\
  \ past. We will now reveal the powers of the <i>Gauntlet</i> in a Pathfinder Playtest-compatible\
  \ form. Behold, the <i>Gauntlet</i>!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >The Gauntlet <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item 18</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Invested</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Magical</p> \n    \

  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p>This mighty adamantine gauntlet was forged by the\
  \ legendary artisans of Mox from the Card Kingdom and is inscribed with hidden runes\
  \ of great power. The <i>Gauntlet</i> boosts your might and enhances your strategy\
  \ to a razor's edge. You gain a +5 item bonus to Athletics checks and Warfare Lore\
  \ checks. When you invest the <i>Gauntlet</i>, you either increase your Strength\
  \ score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While wearing the <i>Gauntlet</i>, you gain a +2 conditional bonus to\
  \ damage rolls on unarmed attacks against minotaurs.</p> \n     <p>When you activate\
  \ the <i>Gauntlet</i>, you slam the ground, creating the same effects as an 8th-level\
  \ <i>earthquake</i>.</p> \n     <p>While you have invested the <i>Gauntlet</i>,\
  \ if anyone offers you a challenge for the <i>Gauntlet</i> and the challenge is\
  \ fair, you must accept that challenge, though you can finish any life-threatening\
  \ or time-critical task before doing so. Once someone has won the <i>Gauntlet</i>\
  \ from you in a challenge, you must wait 1 year before you can challenge them again\
  \ to regain the <i>Gauntlet</i>. If the <i>Gauntlet</i> is stolen, sold, traded,\
  \ looted from a corpse, or obtained in any way other than being won in a fair challenge,\
  \ it vanishes instead, perhaps returning to the vaults of Mox.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <h3>A Familiar Disguise</h3> \n    <p>Familiars, the traditional fuzzy friends\
  \ of wizards and witches, are extremely popular in Pathfinder, especially among\
  \ those who are fans of animals or cute things. While many classes gained access\
  \ to familiars in later books, including the archetypes I wrote for <i>Familiar\
  \ Folio</i> (my first-ever author credit for Paizo), plenty of characters have access\
  \ to familiars from the outset of Pathfinder Second Edition's playtest. Not only\
  \ can wizards take a feat to gain a familiar even if they also have an arcane bond,\
  \ but alchemists can also gain an alchemically created familiar, and druids can\
  \ gain a leshy familiar. But the most surprising and awesome feature might send\
  \ our fans who love both gnomes and familiars (hmm, who could that be?) into a spiral\
  \ of gnomes: there is a gnome ancestry feat to gain a familiar regardless of your\
  \ class.</p> \n    <p>So enough about who can get familiars—how do they work? As\
  \ someone who loves building familiars and getting exactly the type of animal that\
  \ fits my concept, I was sometimes stymied when my ability to choose a familiar\
  \ was locked behind how many low-power creatures that would be useful mostly only\
  \ as familiars could be fit into the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary schedule. In the playtest,\
  \ you won't have to wait for <i>Bestiary 5 </i>to have a flying fox. Familiars have\
  \ always been magical creatures forever altered by your magic, so why not capitalize\
  \ on that to allow for more variety and flexibility than ever before?</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In the playtest's familiar system, you get to pick from a variety of powers\
  \ that either allow the familiar to gain special abilities, like flight or speech\
  \ (yes, you can have a talking cat, or a talking winged cat) or that grant special\
  \ benefits to you, including extra spells and delivering your touch spells at a\
  \ distance. You can normally swap those powers each day as part of your daily preparations,\
  \ which allows you some awesome flexibility for your familiar, though a familiar\
  \ that would naturally have any of these special abilities (like an owl's flight)\
  \ always has that ability locked in. So if you need your rabbit to be able to swim\
  \ for the next day's adventure, you can do that, or you can grant your leshy wings\
  \ of flower blossoms. For the playtest, we started with around 10 different powers,\
  \ but I imagine the list will expand over time and we might create feats for familiar-friendly\
  \ characters to gain more powers than usual or to unlock particularly strong powers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So we know about powers, but what about a familiar's base statistics?\
  \ Your familiar uses your full saving throw modifiers and AC, with a set 4 HP per\
  \ level, so it has better defenses than familiars had before. Familiars are adept\
  \ at Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth, counting as trained characters of your\
  \ level and adding your spellcasting key ability modifier (this is Charisma if you\
  \ have only innate spells, like the aforementioned gnome non-spellcaster). For other\
  \ skills, they have the modifier of an untrained character of your level, meaning\
  \ that after a few levels, their skills are far beyond what a simple animal could\
  \ achieve.</p> \n    <p>Whew, that was an epic-length blog. Thanks again to everyone\
  \ who donated to the Gauntlet to support Wellspring in their efforts to assist the\
  \ homeless, and if you liked how much content was in this blog, be sure to post\
  \ and thank all the donors as well!</p> \n   </div> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Playtest,\
