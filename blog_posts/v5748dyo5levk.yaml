  \ I'm pleased to announce the latest release in the Pathfinder Battles line of prepainted\
  \ plastic fantasy gaming figures: the <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde\
  \ Builder Series</a>! Our first Builder Series release, <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\"\
  >We Be Goblins</a>, just came out this week, and has been receiving positive reviews\
  \ both online and here at the Origins Game Fair, where I'm writing today's blog.\
  \ In September, we plan to follow up this week's set with a new release packed with\
  \ 12 sculpts of classic undead creatures, including four all-new sculpts and new\
  \ paintjobs for popular undead figures from previous sets.</span></p> \n     <p><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde</a> figures come one to a pack, in both\
  \ common and rare varieties. Gamers who pick up a full \"gravity feed\" display\
  \ box of 24 figures should receive a complete set (although with all randomly packed\
  \ product, collation is not guaranteed). A full display should include one each\
  \ of the six rare figures and three each of the six common figures. Each single-figure\
  \ pack has a retail price of $2.99.</p> \n     <p>This week I'd like to preview\
  \ half of the figures in the set. Next week I'll show off the other half, and then\
  \ we'll get back to our regularly scheduled reveals of August's 55-figure <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Skeleton.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Skeleton_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first we have the Skeleton, an old\
  \ friend from our very first release, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a>. This figure's all-new paint scheme presents a more bleached, older\
  \ skeleton. When our partners at WizKids brought this figure to our office a couple\
  \ of weeks ago, all of us agreed that the new paint scheme is an improvement on\
  \ the original. And since all of us liked <a href=\"/products/btpy8qiu\">the original\
  \ Skeleton</a>, that's really saying something. The Skeleton is a common figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Wight.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Wight_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   \
  \  </div> \n     <p>Here we have a brand new sculpt of a classic undead horror—\
  the Wight! Drawn from the creature's illustration in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, this Wight has a bit of nautical flair, making him\
  \ a good match for several of the figures in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set. The Wight is a common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Zombie.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/WZK71174Zombie_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Here's another amazing new sculpt culled straight from the pages of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>. Many of you probably\
  \ remember our <a href=\"/products/btpy8qiy\">original Zombie</a> from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>. That figure already got a repaint\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qsa\">Champions of Evil Encounter Pack</a>, so\
  \ I didn't think it was appropriate to include that sculpt in this new set. But\
  \ come on, the set is called <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde</a>! It's\
  \ got to have a zombie! Anyway, I figure most GMs need as many interesting Zombie\
  \ sculpts as possible, and with arrows and spears sticking through this one, I thought\
  \ it made for a perfect fit. The Zombie is a common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Mummy.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/WZK71174Mummy_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n \
  \    <p>Here we have the Mummy Lord, an alternative paint scheme of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8wse\">Mummy Cleric</a> from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered\
  \ Star</a> set. We've given him a red cloak and tabard, and we think he looks just\
  \ as menacing as ever—and perhaps more so! The Mummy Lord is a rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Lich.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Lich_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    \
  \ </div> \n     <p>The Lich was always one of my favorite figures in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> set. He looks like a serious badass,\
  \ especially with his new <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde</a> paint\
  \ scheme. The new version turns up the contrast to a chilling effect. This was another\
  \ one that everyone in the room when it came in agreed was an improvement on an\
  \ already awesome original. The Lich is a rare figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Graveknight.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/WZK71174Graveknight_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>Last up this week we've got another rare figure, perhaps the\
  \ coolest in the whole set. I give you the Grave Knight, star of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a> cover and one of the most popular\
  \ monsters in the entire book. WizKids' sculptors did a great job combining details\
  \ from the cover painting and interior illustration to bring us an imposing figure\
  \ in a suit of haunted full plate armor. This figure is sure to inspire a ton of\
  \ horrible ideas about how you can use it to scare the pants off of your player\
  \ characters. I know I can't wait to drop it on mine!</p> \n     <p>All figures\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde Builder Series</a> set are\
  \ Medium. </p> \n     <p>I suspect you are going to love them. I do.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>At this point it's probably not surprising to hear that we are already plotting\
  \ with WizKids to develop the NEXT Builder Series release. I can't tell you what\
  \ it is yet, but I can tell you that we have big expectations for this product format.\
  \ It's a great way to add some cool new figures while offering a chance to build\
  \ up large groups of key monsters at a reasonable per-figure price. I'd love to\
  \ hear what sorts of Builder Series releases YOU would like to see in the comments\
  \ to this post.</p> \n     <p>Set up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing Pathfinder\
  \ Battles subscription</a> today to make sure you don't miss a single figure! The\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde Builder Series</a> is not formally\
  \ part of the subscription, but subscribers can use their Encounter Pack/Builder\
  \ Series discount codes to receive a 20% discount on display boxes (the code does\
  \ not apply to single pack purchases).</p> \n     <p>That's it for this week. Next\
  \ week I'll reveal six more figures. After that, we're back to revealing the rest\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set!</p> \n   \
  \  <p>See you then! I'm off to get in some gaming here at Origins!</p> \n     <p>Erik\
