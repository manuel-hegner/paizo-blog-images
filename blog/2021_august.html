                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Lumusi Yao, by Vlada Hladkova</p> 
                <p><b>Lumusi Yao (NG female human chef 5)</b>: Head of the campus cooks, Lumusi is in charge of serving the masses of hungry students and professors two meals a day. Lumusi stresses the importance of a healthy menu over unhealthier items—though there are few who’d complain about her goat pepper soup or spicy peanut curry. Lumusi also tries to keep the diversity of the campus in mind, ensuring that catfolk researchers can avoid onions and iruxi scholars get plenty of calcium. Despite her considerate demeanor, the chef is something of a recluse, and it's an event among students whenever someone spots her outside of the kitchens. Staff in the know whisper that Lumusi's skills came from constantly cooking to care for her dying husband in his final days.</p> 
                <p><b>Thema (CG female elf gardener 6)</b>: An elf from a nearby Ekujae clan, Thema helps tend to the many trees, plants, and gardens on the Magaambya campus. While not the academy’s only gardener, she's the oldest and most experienced. Thema can be seen in the late evening and early morning, silently tending the grounds, leaving some to wonder if she ever rests or sleeps. She lets parts of the grounds remain wild, but keeps the rest scrupulously tended. To most students who casually interact with her, Thema is the picture of poise and grace—though this evaporates outside of a natural setting, as students have caught her wildly and elaborately cursing at sticky door-hinges or accidentally banging her shin on university furniture. </p> 
                <p><b>Xhokan (LN male kobold inventory manager 9)</b>: The ever-smiling Xhokan runs the student supply store, affectionately referred to by Magaambya residents as “the Powderpile” for its large collection of alchemical and magical powders. A rust-colored kobold with flecks of bright orange on his scales, Xhokan is friendly but has a very wry sense of humor that leaves some people unsure of what he actually means or feels. Xhokan ensures that every student gets the supplies they need in order to complete their studies. Xhokan also ensures no one gets any of these provided magical supplies off the record—he has faced down the finest manipulators, beggars, and wheedlers the Magaambya has to offer without budging on this point. Some students gossip they've spotted the kobold doing inventory check after inventory check in the evening hours to ensure nothing has vanished from his stores.</p>

                 <h3>Defeat Monsters. Craft Gear. Imbue Magic.</h3>
                </center> 
                <p><b>Mark Seifter, Author of the Monster Parts System &amp; Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</b></p> 
                <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here, talking to you today, not in my role at Paizo, but as the author of a brand new system for treasure you’ll find in the upcoming <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, which you can get at <a href="http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/" target="_blank">http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/</a>. With monster part crafting, you can replace or enhance the default treasure distribution system for Pathfinder with an all-new take that allows you to upgrade your items with monster parts from the creatures you defeat so that they level up along with your character and gain new powers. </p> 
                <p>Whether you want to use the new system exclusively, just a little, or somewhere in between, I built out three different variations so you can choose the one that’s right for your group—and I did all the math, so you don’t have to! I generated new tables that let the GM know how to hand out monster parts in a way that allows plenty of cool upgrades but is also fully balanced with Pathfinder under the normal rules. I also included sidebars if you want to combine the system with other variant rules that alter treasure, like relics and automatic bonus progression. For a sneak peek, check out this quick start guide for players, taken from the book itself:</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <br> 
                <p>As if that’s not cool enough, there are also a few neat rules options for characters who use monster parts to power their abilities, which you can use in your game whether or not you’re using the monster part system. The big ones are the monster mage archetype, which lets you learn and cast spells from defeated monsters, and the vestige hunter archetype, which enables you to take feats to gain special abilities used by the monsters you’ve defeated. The vestige hunter can incorporate the defeated monster’s vestige into their equipment or into their own body. For instance, if you took the feat to gain a breath weapon from a defeated monster, you could bathe in the dragon’s blood to gain a breath weapon or build a dragon head onto your shield so that it can unleash a breath weapon... and that’s not a random example! You can actually see the iconic monster mage in her blue robes and the iconic vestige hunter with his dragon head shield on the cover of <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3820ea7e-5d29-436b-8060-4b30f278a3e4/083121_Campfire-Square.jpg"><img width="350" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3820ea7e-5d29-436b-8060-4b30f278a3e4/083121_Campfire-Square.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Adventurers sitting with a dragon around a small campfire, working on their crafts"></a>

                <p>So what types of items are you thinking of refining out of monster parts? A sharp blade made from a tyrannosaurus’s teeth? Resilient armor forged from the slag of a defeated iron golem? Let us know in the comments below!</p> 
                <h3>Play a Dragon, a Real Dragon!</h3> 
                <p>I’m also writing <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</em>, which will allow you to play dragons as PCs. I know allowing dragon PCs in the game sounds like it could be overpowered, but I’ve carefully balanced them with other options using archetypes to allow you to spend both class feats and ancestry feats to unlock additional draconic abilities. I’m so sure that the dragons won’t be disruptive that if that isn’t the case, you can contact me on my Arcane Mark Twitch channel or Discord, and we’ll figure out how to make it work. Players, you can tell your GMs that too if they’re uncertain! So come along with me on this journey as I pursue my passion project to bring the dragon ancestry to life and explore the myriad possibilities with 40 different dragon heritages based on the 39 true dragons of Pathfinder and one brand new dragon native to the Indigo Isles!</p>

                <p><b>Patrick Renie, author of book #1, Search for the Missing Map (for levels 1-3)</b></p> 
                <p>One of my favorite movies growing up was <em>Hook</em>, Steven Spielberg’s wonderful rendition of the story of Peter Pan. The movie seemed readymade for nostalgia tripping—nearly every millennial of a certain age can vividly recall the scene in which Peter must use his imagination to conjure the neon-colored “neverfood” at the Lost Boys’ banquet dinner. Rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPCzjHPS--U" target="_blank">the scene</a>, I was pleased with how accurately I’d remembered the radioactive hues of the fantastical goop, which the boys raucously fling at one another in a food fight for the ages.</p> 
                <p>The g’mayun, Jeffrey Anderson’s prize-winning entry to the 2020 RPG Superstar competition, evoked the same feelings of boisterous bonhomie and motley mayhem I experienced while watching <em>Hook</em> all those years ago. Like the Lost Boys, g’mayuns are merrymaking pirates of a benign yet bacchanalian bent, unwilling to “grow up” or submit to the rigid rules of other societies. The cultural legacy of g’mayuns—a history of demonic corruption and divine redemption—is both tragic and triumphant, similar to the bittersweet story of the grown-up Peter Pan. Yet, their parrot-like bodies, rainbow-hued irises, and carefree way of life are as delightful as Spielberg’s technicolor neverfood and the Lost Boys’ jubilation.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bafe2c2a-76da-490e-af2a-6ee451dfdcae/083121_02.Gmayun.png"><img width="300" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bafe2c2a-76da-490e-af2a-6ee451dfdcae/083121_02.Gmayun.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Gmayun, a humanoid, parot ,bird-folk with bright blue feathers.

                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>After developing the g’mayun for Roll For Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, I could hardly resist devising a Pathfinder campaign populated with these beautiful bird-folk. Brainstorming the series’ story and setting with Stephen, Linda, and Ron, I had as much fun as a kid at a food fight. The result, the Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path, is everything a Hook-loving mischief-maker could ask for: a thrilling journey of grand adventure, high-stakes challenges, and bountiful buried treasures. The characters start their adventure with a seemingly simple goal—find the missing fortune of the famous pirate Poppy von Barnacle—but they soon find themselves at the center of an epic swashbuckling tale spanning the tropical Indigo Isles. All the while, the party will meet countless monstrous foes and unusual friends, each drawn from the 100+ new monsters in the Battlezoo Bestiary, along with a horde of new creatures we’ve written specifically for this campaign.</p> 
                <p>Jewel of the Indigo Isles is the kind of fun, colorful story that makes me feel like a kid again, and I can’t wait to share it with you. I hope you find this series as rejuvenating as I do and that, above all, it ignites your imagination.</p> 
                <p><b>Ron Lundeen, author of book #2, Voyage to Runaway Reef (for levels 4-6)</b></p> 
                <p>Greetings! I’m Ron Lundeen, and I have the pleasure of writing the second adventure in this campaign, “Voyage to Runaway Reef.” I love having an adventure that calls back to the classic stories of sailing through dangerous waters in search of a greater prize, like Homer’s Odyssey and the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor. I’m old enough to have run the D&amp;D adventure <em>M1: Into the Maelstrom</em>, which was, I later realized, mostly a fantasy reworking of the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p> 
                <p>In these classic tales, the excitement is in the fanciful places the heroes visit, and “Voyage to Runaway Reef” is no different. The heroes visit Bluebell Island, which contains the town of Seaview and the lively orpoks, a new ancestry that I know people are going to love. The heroes must also visit other islands, including the ominous Moonshadow Island and, of course, Runaway Reef, populated by another new ancestry, the chochori. The adventure contains a lot of island-hopping fun, but I get to provide even more of it in the volume’s gazetteer showcasing the Indigo Isles. Time to set sail for adventure!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/75264d6e-a610-46ea-a87c-24ca5cb776db/083121_Orpok_FINAL.png"><img width="300" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/75264d6e-a610-46ea-a87c-24ca5cb776db/083121_Orpok_FINAL.png" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Orpok; A humanoid pig-folk dressed in a red jackets and striped pants"></a>

                <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer, author of book #3, Battle at Barnacle Bay (for levels 7-10)</b></p> 
                <p>I’m excited to be working on the third volume of the Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path. Without getting into spoiler territory, I can say that this part will be full of cinematic adventure and opportunities for your motley band of characters to show off just how strong they’ve become. My experience as a GM and author up to this point has mostly been in the world of Golarion, so it’s fun to be part of building a setting from the ground up. In this new world of Alacar, all gods are part of a paradigm known as the Balance.</p> 
                <p>Through the Balance, gods exist in groups, usually pairs, representing connected concepts such as Life and Death or Fire and Water. Though these gods of opposing forces may come into conflict, they must also ensure that their counterparts’ strength does not dwindle too much. Whenever a god dies, their partner in the Balance dies as well. Among mortals, the Balance is more than just a matter of discussion for theological scholars; the ideology also helps define how people interact with the divine. For just as the god of Water could not extinguish the god of Fire, so too do the followers of the god of Water know that nothing good can come of attempts to quench the god of Fire’s influence.</p>

                <p>Finally, all of the adventure authors have the chance to create new monsters, lore, and player-facing rules. I could hardly pass up a chance to expand upon my favorite ancestry. As a part of my section, I'm making new leshy content, including the wildfire leshy, a new heritage in the Battlezoo Bestiary, along with a pack of leshy ancestry feats.</p>

                <p>That’s an excerpt from the foreword Viola Davis wrote in the <em>NIOBE: She is Life</em> hardcover. This was just before Niobe and her entire world of ASUNDA was optioned by HBO a couple of years ago, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/03/asunda-drama-series-based-epic-fantasy-comics-hbo-sebastian-a-jones-1202581186/">where we are in development</a>.</p> 
                <p>Now, after several graphic novels in Niobe’s world, we are launching her next comic series titled <em>NIOBE &amp; DURA: Wrath of the Ancient</em>, which I cowrote with Prentice Penny. I had the honor of working with Prentice at HBO. The comic drops August 28th on Kickstarter at 10 a.m., where you can also get the incredible <em>Pathfinder: Niobe</em> Pathfinder First Edition module, plus a model mini (by Mythic) and LARP swords (by Calimacil), and beautiful art by David Mack (Daredevil), Jae Lee (The Dark Tower), and Hyoung Taek Nam (The Last of Us). <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sebastianajones/niobe-and-dura-wrath-of-the-ancient-1?ref=7r1ufe&amp;token=a3066303">CLICK HERE</a> for the Kickstarter!</p>

                <p><em>So how did we get here? </em></p> 
                <p>Sometimes you have to paint your dreams into existence. I first fell in love with fantasy by painting little miniatures for my war games, back when they were made of lead, and I was 8 years old and still living in England. Shortly after, I fell in love with tabletop roleplaying and soon after LARP, much to the annoyance of my Mum, as I would constantly raid her wardrobe to hack up something to fashion some horrendous ranger attire or wizard rags… and they were raggedy. Since I was a kid, I was a gamer telling stories, but it wasn’t until I was in my mid thirties that they were voiced into something other than my weekly roleplaying sessions. With a couple of pals, I formed Stranger Comics.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>The stories themselves are rooted in themes that reflect our own truths, and the lies we tell ourselves. Our struggles, our fears and hopes, our love… and second chances. The first tale, <em>THE UNTAMED</em>, is about a sinner who makes a deal with the devil to return from hell to avenge his family—seven days for seven souls. But even he can find redemption, and that’s when he meets Niobe. As for Niobe herself, she is always battling her own doubts about who she is, and who we want her to be—something we can all relate to. She is not only Half-Elven but also half-angel and half-demon to reflect the duality of spirit we all share and battle with.</p> 
                <p>With several books in Niobe’s world of Asunda out, our new NIOBE &amp; DURA tale threads much of her story together, and it starts to reveal how the world was created by the great shaman DURA and her (now evil and undead brother) VASTAR, first child of the Devil. I couldn’t be more excited to share this with folks who love that stuff—worldbuilding—to you guys, the gaming community. Especially as the character class OMDAR/OMDURA in the Pathfinder module is literally derived from the character Dura, who trains Niobe for a period in her life. </p> 
                <p>So, if you are into fantasy tales and games, which I can only guess you are if you’re reading this, I hope you get a chance to check out our campaign. There are opportunities to get the new stuff but also every other book in our world, plus the amazing module created in partnership with Paizo. </p> 
                <p>Thanks and much love!<br> <b>Seb</b></p>

                 <p><em>A young Niobe is in the care of the great shaman Dura. They are fleeing the first undead, Vastar, Dura’s own brother returned from hell as the Devil’s horseman. He has just decimated the tribe that has raised Niobe, and now Dura must teach Niobe who she can be all the while knowing WHAT she could become if she falls into Vastar's hands. If Vastar can get to Niobe, Dura will have to make the ultimate choice. </em></p> 
                 <p><em>Niobe is half-human, half-elven and direct heir to the thrones of both realms who are at war. But Niobe is also half-angel and half-demon. For within her lies the spirit of the Goddess and the Devil, and both will move heaven and hell to make her their champion.</em></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Months ago, as we were preparing for the Jasper’s Game Week 2021 charity fundraiser, we received an email from Anne “Hearthsinger” Richmond (on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/annerichmond">@annerichmond</a>) saying that <a href="https://jaspersgameday.com/" target="_blank">Jasper’s Game Day’s</a> usual Twitch overlay volunteer wasn’t available. She knew that our art department put together some <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh8k?Stream-Overlays-for-Pathfinder-2E-Starfinder">overlays for Pathfinder Second Edition and Starfinder</a>, but they had a few more players at each table than those overlays could hold. They needed overlays for a GM, plus five or six players, for some of the virtual tabletops for the event. </p> 
                <p>Well, one thing led to another, and we ended up making simple overlays for tables of up to seven players, plus the GM! We’ve bundled the overlays for four to seven players, a Game Master, some stats, and a space for the virtual tabletop together into free downloads for you. These are 1920 x 1080 PNG and PSD files with transparencies (i.e., blank holes) for the frames that go over the windows for the guests. They will soon find a permanent home in the Community Use Package. Enjoy! </p>

                <p>The <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em> is the long-awaited effort of the 2020 RPG Superstar contest, in which hundreds of Pathfinder fans and aspiring designers submitted their most creative creature ideas for Pathfinder Second Edition. Following the competition’s extended hiatus, Paizo licensed the maker of the long-running Roll For Combat actual play podcast to run this hallowed contest. Now, after more than a year of developing, editing, illustrating, and designing, the 172-page book based on the winning entries is ready to be released along with two other companion volumes: <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</em> by Mark Seifter and the <em>Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path</em> by myself, Ron Lundeen, and Linda Zayas-Palmer!</p> 
                <p>Along with Roll For Combat’s showrunner Stephen Glicker and Paizo’s own design manager Mark Seifter, I had the great joy of working on this book to expand the contest’s winning entries into an awesome tome of monsters. You can read the full story of how Stephen resurrected the beloved RPG Superstar contest in the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary's</em> introduction, so I’ll spare you the details. Suffice it to say, a lot of love went into this grand effort, and we are all incredibly proud of the final result!</p> 
                <p>Choosing a favorite monster from the many in this book would be like choosing my favorite horrifying child. From butcher booths (living, breathing, people-eating buildings) to g’mayuns (rainbow-eyed parrot-pirates), the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em> boasts enough potential baddies and buddies to populate multiple Pathfinder campaigns. Even with a hundred blog posts, I couldn’t do the magnificent monsters in this bestiary justice. They just have to be seen to be believed.</p> 
                <p>Only one could reign supreme among the hundreds of monsters submitted to the RPG Superstar contest, however, and this year’s Grand Prize went to the shale spitter, a perhaps unassuming mountain-dwelling critter created by Brant Vallier. Brant’s entry even included a sketch of what he thought the shale spitter might look like—a sketch that I think it’s fair to say artist Sebastian Rodriguez turned up to 11.</p>

                <p>We asked Brant to show us what the evolution of shale spitters might look like, and the resulting varieties of this versatile vermin left us astounded. The most impressive specimen is the shale behemoth, a crystal-covered horror of titanic proportions. (This one was so cool that it burst its way onto the book’s cover, as well!)</p>

                <p>As if a boatload of new beasts weren’t enough for this epic volume, the <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em> also features the brand-new <b>Monster Parts system</b>—a set of rules that Game Masters and players can use to transform loot from their slain foes into custom equipment and gear! Bundled with these new rules are two new archetypes (the vestige hunter and the monster mage), new character backgrounds, and new items, all perfect for those special slayers in your party.</p>

She had hoped, briefly, that getting away from her home and clan would ease the burden, but if anything, arriving at the Magaambya had only made things worse. Each project, assignment, or presentation was just another expectation on top of an already precarious tower of expectations she had been trying to climb since birth.</p> 
                <p>All that to say, it wasn’t all that surprising when an unexpected knock at her door nearly sent her jumping out of her fur.</p> 
                <p>“Uh… j-just a minute,” she called out, hurrying to tidy the books and papers in front of her. </p> 
                <p>“I just came to deliver a message,” Esi shouted through the door. “Teacher Ot says he wants to see you.”</p> 
                <p>Anchor Root’s heart raced. <em>Ba-bump. Ba-bump. Ba-bump.</em> “Did he say why?”</p> 
                <p>“No. But he said that I should tell you that you’re not in trouble, you didn’t do anything wrong, you can take as long as you need, it isn’t an emergency, and he’s not mad at you.” </p> 
                <p>Well. That only made it half as nerve-wracking at least.</p> 
                <p>“Oh, there was one other thing. He said to bring an instrument.” </p>

                </div> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <br> 
                <p>Anchor Root found Takulu Ot in the courtyard, relaxing under one of the smaller trees. He sat with his eyes closed and held his mbira in his lap, lazily plucking out a scale on the metal tines. The soft, metallic strumming was a familiar sound to any student who knew the man. It was a somewhat popular instrument in Nantambu, but those from farther abroad usually found it odd. Something about the way certain notes wouldn’t play the way you expected, and would distract from the melody. </p> 
                <p>Takulu hadn’t noticed Anchor Root yet, and she briefly considered turning around and returning to her room before he did. But that would only prolong her worry in the end. Better to simply get it over with. “Teacher Ot?” she called over instead. </p> 
                <p>His hands paused as he looked up. “Ah, just the student I wanted to see,” he said with an easy smile. He seemed to smile more often than he made every other facial expression put together. “Did Esi deliver my message?” </p> 
                <p>Anchor Root reached into her bag and withdrew an ivory flute. </p> 
                <p>“Perfect! Now, I’m sure you’re wondering why I called you out here. You see, I feel I have been remiss in my approach to teaching certain elements of arcane spellcasting. I have a passion for mathematics, and I find them to be an excellent parallel to arcana. Each with a unique formula that can be broken down into its component parts, solved and calculated and—” Takulu glanced over just in time to see Anchor Root’s ears flatten, and cleared his throat. “Well, anyway, all of those things also apply to music, and Esi tells me that you are a talented musician. So why don’t we play together for a bit?”</p> 
                <p>“What? Esi said that? About me?” Anchor Root asked in shock. “I mean no, I wouldn’t say that I’m talented or anything, Esi is the one who’s really talented, I just sort of play along from time to time but I’m really only just okay, or I guess ‘okay’ might be putting it too strongly, I guess I’m really just… sorry, I’m talking too much.” </p> 
                <p>“You are not talking too much,” Takulu reassured her. “And ‘just sort of playing along’ is fine for now, as long as you don’t mind me talking while we play.” </p> 
                <p>Anchor Root nodded and collapsed on the ground in a motion that some might charitably call sitting down. Takulu began plucking at his mbira again, and after listening for a moment to catch the melody, Anchor Root began to play along as well. As Takulu gradually increased the tempo, she sped up to match. As he slowly shifted the melody, she moved into a complementary harmony. </p> 
                <p>“You know, many people find the mbira strange to listen to. They think the notes are too discordant, and they aren’t entirely wrong. It is an instrument that is not meant to be played alone. It is best with accompaniment,” he said.</p> 
                <p>Anchor Root lowered her flute to respond, “But you play alone all the time.”</p> 
                <p>Takulu looked over with that glint in his eye that he always got when he was nearing the heart of a lesson. “Do I? I don’t think I’ve ever heard an mbira played by itself. My grandfather built this mbira, so his hands are always next to mine when I hold it. My mother taught me how to play, so her song always harmonizes with mine. I don’t know much about bone keeping, but I imagine it must be similar. You are always carrying a little of history with you, in your music and your magic. When you stand on the shoulders of your ancestors, you can reach much greater heights than you do alone.” </p> 
                <p>The young gnoll put down her flute to consider his words. “The thousands who have come before you,” she muttered.</p> 
                <p>Takulu nodded. “With that said, why don’t we try that spell from class the other day? You got quite close the last time you tried, and I think you could do it with just a little more effort.” </p> 
                <p>“Yes, Teacher Ot,” Anchor Root said. She didn’t mention that she had practiced the spell over a dozen times since she failed to conjure a simple illusion in front of her classmates. If she mentioned that, then her teacher would be expecting her to do it easily, and if she failed when he was expecting her to do it easily, that would be way worse than failing when he wasn’t expecting her to succeed at all, right? So without saying anything more, she reached out a hand and created a perfect illusory copy of her familiar. </p> 
                <p>The illusory chicken moved around the courtyard, pecked the ground looking for bugs, and squawked intermittently. Takulu clapped softly and said, “Very well done. I couldn’t have made a more believable chicken. Pulling from your own experiences is an excellent way to reinforce your illusions, but you shouldn’t rely too heavily on them. So I wonder, could you try something bigger? Maybe something louder?”</p> 
                <p>“Uh… I-I don’t know about that…”</p> 
                <p>“Let’s at least give it a try. It’s okay if you don’t do it perfectly,” Takulu said. He stood, brushed the grass and dirt from his clothes, and began walking. “I’m going to go stand on the far side of the courtyard. Try and make something I can see from over there.”</p> 
                <p>Right. Something big. What counted as big? Everything was big to an ant gnoll, but Teacher Ot was a tall man, she thought. A gorilla? A giraffe? A dog? An angry dog that barks whenever you walk past and it always catches you by surprise even though you walk that way every day and you’ve really thought about telling its owner that he should train his dog not to bark at strangers but he has a very angry dog and you have a chicken and—</p> 
                <p>“Whenever you’re ready, Anchor Root,” Takulu shouted from the other side of the courtyard.</p> 
                <p>In a moment of panic, she clutched one of the bones on her necklace and cast the spell. “Big and loud. Big and loud,” she whispered. She could barely hear her own voice over the sound of her heart pounding. In a swirl of light, a stomping, trumpeting, stampeding elephant appeared between the trees, charging toward Takulu. He smiled easily as it crashed through him and disappeared.</p> 
                <p>“Yes! Excellent! You’ve got it!” Takulu cheered. He walked back over to the tree and knelt to pick up his instrument. “I knew that you had it in you. You sell yourself sh—you don’t give yourself enough credit, but you are an amazing talent. If you just keep up with your studies, I know that you’ll do amazing things. You might even get to teach your own students one of these day—</p> 
                <p>“Anchor Root? Huh. How does she manage to run so fast?”</p>

               <p>In the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands">Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</a>, the players take on the roles of students at the Magaambya, the oldest and most prestigious magic academy in the world, an ancient institution founded by the greatest wizard the world has ever known. This wizard vanished long ago, but his sinister enemies plot against his school and those who attend it. Over their long academic career, the heroes rise from humble students to become teachers, and they ultimately hold the fate of the Magaambya in their hands. Graduates of the Magaambya are among the greatest wardens of the world, but if the heroes can't marshal the strength of thousands who have come before them, the venerable Magaambya might fall!</p>

                <p>We wanted to share the news a bit ahead of time so you can assemble your groups and plan some games. If you’re a member of our organized play community, you can earn credit for a Pathfinder Society character at the same time that you playtest one of the new classes, using the normal <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Playtest-Rules" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society rules for class playtests</a></p> 
                <p>Are you interested in helping test and shape the newest Pathfinder classes, but you need help finding a group or game? The <a href="http://paizo.events">Paizo Events Discord server</a>, where our Gen Con Online events will be taking place, will have a channel for you to look for other gamers to playtest with. You can also check out warhorn.net or our VTT partners (Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, or Astral) for games. If you need a pre-made adventure, try playing a <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/society">Pathfinder Society scenario</a> or one or more <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/bounties">Pathfinder Bounties</a>!</p> 
                <p>Tune in to our Gen Con 2021 streams for more information on the new classes (and the book they’ll be appearing in), and be the first to play them right after the convention! We hope to see you there!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Earlier this year, Digital Dragon Studios unveiled the official Pathfinder 2nd Edition Combat Tracker App for everyone to try, and we've had a great deal of fun listening to all the ways folks are using it! Thanks to your feedback, we’ve made quite a few alterations over the last few months, from two new systems to a variety of in-app improvements, and we’re excited to share them with you!</p> 
                <p>While the Combat Tracker App is meant to be used by your whole party, with each person joining via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and thus always remaining on reset, many of our users also operate it solo. This means that some GMs are performing the time-consuming tasks of entering each party member in every battle. We’ve made some tweaks to make that just a bit easier by allowing the GM to save manually entered combatants from one round to the next. This means when you hit the reset button, only the non-saved characters are removed from combat, leaving the party together for the next encounter and eliminating the need to re-enter consistent characters. </p> 
                <p>Other oft-requested features have been the bulk adding of combatants and the ability to delete a character during battle. We’re happy to report you can now add as many zombies as you like to any combat with just one entry, and it auto-populates each of their tabs! If you leave the dice setting on random, it even rolls different initiatives for them all. Just to make game life a teeny bit better, we also added a long press menu for each combatant on the combat screen. Pressing for a few seconds on a tab now brings up a menu allowing you to change an initiative, save newfound party members, and delete those lost in battle all in one place. </p> 
                <p>Not enough? We also found time to adapt two other game systems, creating combat tracking apps for the many fans of Pathfinder 1st First Edition and the space-faring Starfinders! Whichever game you prefer, we hope you have fun with it, and we can’t wait to share our next updates with you. </p>

                <h3>The Worldwound Opens!</h3> 
                <p>At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, a massive rift in reality destroyed the nation of Sarkoris and left a permanent portal between Golarion and the Abyss. Known as the Worldwound, this extraplanar chasm left the world vulnerable to invasion by ravenous demonic hordes. An alliance of knights, barbarians, and other heroes stemmed the demon army and contained it within the Worldwound, and for the next century, crusade after crusade tried to defeat the demons only to fail time and time again. Their greatest success, the line of magical artifacts known as wardstones that stand sentinel along the Worldwound's border, barely manages to contain the demons. When one of the wardstones is sabotaged, the demons within surge out in a massive assault like none before. Even before the Fifth Crusade has begun, fiends have brought down a city and slayed some of the crusaders' greatest defenders and heroes. </p> 
                <h3>Unleash the Wrath of the Righteous</h3> 
                <p>In the <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> computer RPG, you take on the role of the Commander, who witnesses the tragic events that precipitate Golarion’s final stand against the invading demon armies. Over the course of the game, the Commander will assemble a band of loyal companions, from the redeemed succubus Arueshalae to the aasimar noble Daeran; marshal the armies of the crusade and command them in battle; and tap into mythic power to alter the very fabric of reality.</p> 
                <h3>The Perfect Companions</h3> 
                <p>Each companion offers a rich background and side plots to flesh out their history, relationship to the Commander, and role within the crusade. Companions both make up the adventuring party you’ll take through the game and serve as advisors, lieutenants in the ongoing war, and in some cases, even romantic partners. Your choices, alignment, and mythic path selection all impact the companions’ relationships with the Commander, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique experience! Check out the shaman Camellia; the ranger Lann, one possible Commander; the Hellknight Regill; and Seelah, our own iconic paladin—just four of more than a dozen companions available to augment your game.</p>

                <h3>Take Command</h3> 
                <p>You’ll feel the scale of the conflict in Wrath of the Righteous with the Crusade system, a new strategic layer of gameplay built specifically for this adventure. At a certain point in the game, you will be granted command of the Fifth Crusade: a grand push against the demons. From that point on, you venture forth not only with your party but by recruiting troops and their leaders. Gradually, you will build up armies of thousands and march them across the Worldwound to seize back the territories and their treasures from the enemy.</p> 
                <h3>With Mythic Power…</h3> 
                <p>Further customizing the story to your choices, the mythic path you select grants your character a unique set of skills that push the limits of the Pathfinder RPG. It also presents a distinct narrative arc, ultimately leading to your mythic transformation into a being of unmatched power! As Commander, you can become a celestial angel, a raging demon, a powerful lich, a cunning trickster, an otherworldly aeon, a rebellious azata, a wise gold dragon, or an insatiable swarm-that-walks; you can even remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living legend. With mythic transformations, you can increase the rank of your chosen path to earn new skills and abilities while also having a great impact on the world around you.</p>

                <p>We have two new missions available for you starting this month. First, we’ll follow up our earlier trip into the Veskarium with an exclusive invitation to a cultural gala aboard a luxury concert ship. Society leadership is aware that some agents share our concerns about supporting the vesk imperialist agenda, and we hope to empower you to make your own choices regarding this matter in future dealings with the Veskarium—starting now. You won’t want to miss the stellar performance and political intrigue in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027tt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-406-Combatants-Concerto-Prelude-to-Revolution"><em>Combatants’ Concerto: Prelude to Revolution</em></a>, written by Shay Snow. </p> 
                <p>Our more seasoned agents are needed to scout a mysterious robotics facility in the Vast with suspected ties to the Data Scourge attacks. The First Seeker asks that you travel to the facility, infiltrate it, and discover whatever you can about the robotic attackers that marched on Absalom Station. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027tu?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-407-A-Haven-for-Scourged-Machines">A Haven for Scourged Machines</a> by Nicholas Wasko is another exciting installment in the Data Scourge metaplot. </p> 
                <p>I’m counting on you, Starfinders. Be safe out there and watch each other’s backs. </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Raia crouched behind a stack of crates, camouflage membrane turned to full power, focused on powering up the warehouse’s maintenance terminal. Once her enchantments opened up the interface, she plugged the jack into her custom wrist mount and said into her comm, “I’m in.” </p> 
                <p>“You know,” answered Navasi. “I’ve never heard anyone say that on a job. Outside of an action holovid, anyway.”</p> 
                <p>“Those soap writers wish they wrote plots as good as my life,” Raia answered. “About to go virtual. Stay put until you get my beacon. After I trip security, I’m going to need a fast exit.”</p> 
                <p>“‘After’ you trip security?” said Navasi. “Don’t you mean ‘if’? Say you mean ‘if,’ Raia.”</p> 
                <p>Raia laughed and said, “Going virtual.” </p> 
                <p>The world around her vanished. Raia could still see, hear, and even feel and taste, but in this glowing, in-between world, meant to represent the digital flow of the local infosphere, sensation was different. Here, she was different. And much more powerful. </p> 
                <p>Raia had been hired by a politician to expose a cult. She’d taken the job, not for money, but for a favor. Months ago, Starfinder Society probes had discovered yet another inhabited planet along the edges of Near Space, which ancient star charts named Sigerro. Preliminary scans indicated Sigerro’s inhabitants possessed a rich culture and advanced technology. Many interested parties hoped to be on the first diplomatic team sent to meet their people, but such assignments would be determined by the Directorate in accordance with Pact World protocol. </p> 
                <p>Luckily, Elxur Droj, the verthani politician in charge of the Directorate’s diplomatic corp, was also a Seeker in his spare time—one of a group of infosphere conspiracists hoping to expose the wide-spread religion called the Disciples of Grace. Instead of helping the poor and sick, Seekers believed the Disciples were secretly corrupt slavers bent on taking over the Pact Worlds. Elxur not only believed this, he hoped to use their exposure to run for higher political office.</p> 
                <p>After approaching Elxur through her usual aliases, Raia had managed to secure a deal. If she could procure evidence of corrupt Disciple activity, Elxur would approve her request to be part of the diplomatic team on Sigerro.</p> 
                <p>The Disciples of Grace certainly weren’t spending all their credits on charity, no matter how well they laundered their donations. Raia had been able to locate a warehouse on Verces used by one of their shell companies for off-the-books shipments. If she could acquire shipping manifests, Elxur should grant her a place on the diplomatic mission.</p> 
                <p>Now, Raia stood on a floating platform in seemingly endless digital chasm. Once she leapt, there was no turning back. Checking to make all her defenses and countermeasures were in place, she dove into digital void.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>It was like freefall, glorious freefall, except instead of wind, breezes of bytes and floods of information cascaded all around her.</p> 
                <p>As long as Raia kept falling, standard security measures shouldn’t be able to track her presence, so fast was she moving from one node to the next. Yet this also made acquiring the right data hard.</p> 
                <p>Everywhere she looked, she saw secure files as floating screens—and each image they depicted was disturbing. People being led away in chains. Priests changing form in private. These weren’t shipping manifests, but they might be better. Like a hungry child in an orchard, Raia plucked as many files as she could into her avatar for later study. She didn’t have much time before the system’s internal security caught on to her falling simulation and—</p> 
                <p><em>VHHT VHHHT VHHHHHT</em></p> 
                <p>Suddenly, instead of descending down an endless void, Raia was approaching hard ground fast. A digital wall of spiky security code had manifested—which could shatter Raia’s persona on impact. They’d detected her more quickly than anticipated. Upgraded security. Definitely more cutting edge than a charitable religion should have access to. </p> 
                <p>Instead of smashing into the wall of code, Raia activated another program, buffering her processors through the node, her digital persona appearing to float gently to the ground. </p> 
                <p>Where she was instantly surrounded by glowing-red virtual security countermeasures. Vicious, cutting-edge anti-hacker programs, which in the virtual resembled crimson piranhas coated in blood-red razor wire, swirling in on themselves. </p> 
                <p>“Aren’t you just the cutest things,” she muttered. They rushed at her, but Raia had come ready for something like this.</p> 
                <p>With the grace of an acrobat, she dodged their serrated tentacles—prodding counterhacks trying to penetrate her avatar and learn her identity. Just when it seemed the countermeasures might be too numerous to evade, Raia pulled her next trick. In a flash of green, two digital versions of Raia stood surrounded by the menacing security programs. Both fled in different directions. The security countermeasures, momentarily confused, split up to chase both.</p> 
                <p>While her decoy fled, Raia dove behind a digital gleaming column and amped up her camouflage code, similar to the weave she’d been using in the real world. She blended completely into the digital wall around her. As the last security countermeasure flew past, Raia pounced, landing atop it, clawing both hands inside its glowing carapace.</p> 
                <p>With the precision of a surgeon, she copied its access privileges and modified its instructions. Once finished, the drone glowed the same green as her persona’s glowing functions. It sped off to fight its former companions, while Raia used its security clearance to copy the shipping manifests she’d originally been hoping to “borrow.” </p> 
                <p>A crackle and a beep indicated a message coming over her comm in the real world. “Raia? Things are getting pretty hot. Alarms everywhere and bots are summoning private security teams to your location.”</p> 
                <p>Time to rabbit. Raia exited the hacking sequence, copied data securely stored in her rig. She turned on her beacon and sprinted toward the street, already spotting Navasi’s hovercar blasting around the corner. </p> 
                <p>As she prepared to leap onto the vehicle, Raia wondered what she’d been able to acquire. She didn’t know exactly what was on those files, but it should be enough to get her on the diplomatic team. Either way, she’d make sure never to donate to Disciples of Grace in the future.</p>

                <h3>Clark Valentine (he/him)</h3> 
                <p>I’ve been a part-time freelance designer and writer of tabletop RPGs for over 15 years, and I love fantasy adventure games like Pathfinder. I’m a big believer in setting design and worldbuilding through small details; what services people sell, what specialized gear a toolkit contains, and what capabilities people put into a magic item tells you a lot about how people live in the world. I’m really excited to be contributing to Pathfinder’s worldbuilding through this sort of design work. In addition to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, you can also find my work in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em> and <em>Bestiary 3</em> for Pathfinder Second Edition and in lots of games from numerous publishers across the tabletop RPG scene such as Fate Accelerated Edition, Tachyon Squadron, and Sentinel Comics RPG. Making games is a family activity for me; my wife and daughter are both award-winning RPG writers and editors. My son is an award-winning robot builder which, while not games, is pretty awesome. Our cats have not yet won any awards, to the whole family’s bewilderment. You can find me on Twitter under my name, <a href="https://twitter.com/clarkvalentine" target="_blank">@clarkvalentine</a>.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Sen H.H.S. (she/her)</h3> 
                <p>Hello, Paizo fans and supporters! I’m Sen H.H.S., a TTRPG freelance writer based on the other side of the Pacific, who often specializes in Chinese-inspired TTRPG content. You might have seen my work in Bestiary 3, as well as the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix’s second volume, “Ready? Fight!”. In addition to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, you’ll find more of my work in upcoming publications such as <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, and <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>. You can follow me on Twitter @SenHHS, where you’ll get the latest news on what I’m up do, be it projects for other systems or my self-publications. In addition, starting on the 28th of August, I’ll be joining a biweekly stream of a Fists of the Ruby Phoenix liveplay as a player. Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/TrailMixTales" target="_blank">@TrailMixTales</a> on Twitter to be notified when we’re on!</p>

                <h3>Ron Lundeen (he/him) – Paizo Development Manager</h3> 
                <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, development manager of Pathfinder here at Paizo. I wrote up several spells for this book, including a few involving gravity—for which I used quite a bit of "what do I like that my Starfinder characters can do that I want to do in Pathfinder?" thinking! You can check out my RPG advice, including an entire free Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Path I wrote, on my blog at <a href="http://runamokgames.com/">RunAmokGames.com</a>. I’m available for freelance for any number of game systems at <a href="mailto:rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com">rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com</a>.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Mari Tokuda (she/her)</h3> 
                <p>Mari Tokuda is both a writer and a big, old nerd. You can find her work in the Dishonored and Dune RPGs alongside <em>Secrets of Magic</em>... with many more projects in the works! She has also written short fiction for the most recent version of the tabletop skirmish game Malifaux.</p> 
                <p>She has a retired racing greyhound who is totally spoiled and totally deserves to be. She believes Seattle is the best city in the world, that the Civilization games are the best videogames ever, and that anthropomorphized food is super creepy.</p> 
                <p>You can find her on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/maritokuda" target="_blank">@maritokuda</a> and on her website at <a href="https://www.maritokuda.com/" target="_blank">maritokuda.com</a>. You can also hear her chat about all things Asian American on her podcast, the Yellow Ranger Fanclub.</p> 
                <p>Finally, she finds writing about herself in the third person really weird and uncomfortable.</p>

                <h3>Logan Bonner (he/him) – Pathfinder Lead Designer</h3> 
                <p>Hi, there! I'm Logan Bonner, the Pathfinder Lead Designer and also the design lead on <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. As you might guess from that, this book is a big one for me and a chance to show off the vision we have for how further rulebooks look now that the core tools for GMs and players are out there. The plan was to make a book that's fun to read—not just useful for its mechanics—that you'll want to have on your shelf for years and years. I put a lot of time into this book and worked with all these other amazing authors (it's a big author pool compared to most books!) to get their fun ideas in there. Thanks to all these cool people for their contributions! For my part, I wrote the magus, magical tattoos, and spellhearts, and created things to fill blanks during development. I've been at Paizo for 9 years, first arriving to edit on Ultimate Equipment, and have been in RPGs since 2006, working on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the Spectaculars superhero RPG, the Mistborn Adventure Game, Dragon Age, and lots more. I've kept myself busy during the pandemic with weekly RPG nights (including a long-running Star Trek Adventures game), an online comic book club with some friends, and way too much sitting around watching YouTube. I can be found on Twitter, where I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/loganbonner">@loganbonner</a>.</p>

                <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3> 
                <p><em>Secrets of Magic</em> might be my favorite author project to date! I'm so grateful for the opportunity to contribute to several sections that meant a lot to me. I'm always happiest in nature, so it was a joy to draw on that reverence for the primal treatise. And while space is always limited, I had a lot of background ideas that went into the witch's journey and I hope you enjoy the peek into her story!</p> 
                <p>My writing has also appeared in <em>Bestiary 3</em> (arboreals and kokogiak), <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (arctic biome), the upcoming <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> (REDACTED), and more, but you'll see my name with far more regularity (sometimes credited as Simone Dietzler) alongside Paizo's incredible crew of editors. When I'm not editing or writing, I'm—you guessed it—reading, gaming, or soaking up that primal magic on walks in the woods.

                <h3>David N. Ross (he/him)</h3> 
                <p>It was my pleasure to devise some new cantrips and other magic for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, my twelfth contribution to Pathfinder Second Edition. I drew a fair bit of inspiration from superhero cartoons and games I loved when I was a little gay kid, which I hope will bring the same joy to players. When I'm not writing for Paizo, I'm a prolific freelance writer, designer, and developer of third-party products compatible with Pathfinder (first and second editions), Starfinder, and D&amp;D. My recent releases include the second volume of Fists of the Ruby Phoenix, a small part of the unapologetic original cyberpunk game <em>Hard Wired Island</em> from Weird Age Games, and <em>Legendary Sorcerers</em> from Legendary Games (compatible with Pathfinder First Edition). You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds">@DavidRossWorlds</a>.</p>

                <h3>Tonya Woldridge (she/her) – Paizo Organized Play Manager</h3> 
                <p>While writing papers in college, I never envisioned earning author bylines for my words. While my focus at Paizo is more coordination than book creation, I’ve enjoyed the opportunities I’ve had to “cross over” and try something new. My biggest assignment so far was <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a>, which included the history of the Pathfinder Society, several lodges, a faction, and designing the lodge heraldry. For <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, my contribution included non-magical backgrounds. I’ve got no other upcoming projects releasing, as I’ve taken a hiatus from writing during the pandemic. But keep an eye out for me writing for future publications.</p> 
                <p>In my off time, I like spending time in the kitchen, most often baking. I love reading cookbooks and have several shelves of a bookcase dedicated to volumes from medieval times to present. Right now, I’m enjoying making Korean cuisine for dinners and refining my cream clotting &amp; scone baking techniques so I can enjoy a proper English cream tea. You can find me on Facebook (PaizoOrgPlay), Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/PaizoOrgPlay">@PaizoOPM</a>) and Discord (TonyaOPM#6396). We’ve got PaizoCon Online Europe coming up this weekend – consider dropping by the <a href="http://paizo.events/">Paizo Events</a> server and say hi or join us for a game!</p>

                <h3>Tan Shao Han (he/him)</h3> 
                <p>I'm an indie RPG designer and co-founder of the Curious Chimeras, an indie RPG design house in Singapore. I'm also part of #RPGSEA (<a href="https://across-rpgsea.com/">https://across-rpgsea.com</a>) a movement and allyship of RPG creators who feel and work with an affinity with diverse Southeast Asian RPG communities. My work for Paizo includes freelancing for several Pathfinder Second Edition projects; I enjoy designing spells, equipment, and otherworldly beings which can enrich players' experiences through hinting at the existence of larger, richer worlds behind the scenes. For example, I've had the opportunity to work on two different undead beings recently for Pathfinder: the new jiang-shi in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #167: Ready? Fight!</em>, and the abandoned zealot in Bestiary 3. These creatures are both supporting characters for players to interact with, as well as characters in their own right, with identities, desires, and anxieties rooted in their places in Golarion's milieu; I hope players and GMs will enjoy weaving these beings into their own campaigns and emergent stories.</p> 
                <p>You can find my design work for the Curious Chimeras at <a href="https://curiouschimeras.itch.io/">https://curiouschimeras.itch.io</a>, and check us out at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curiouschimeras/">https://www.instagram.com/curiouschimeras</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/curiouschimeras">https://twitter.com/curiouschimeras</a>.</p>

                <h3>Vanessa Hoskins</h3> 
                <p>Hello! I'm the author behind the Cathartic Magic and Thassilonian Rune Magic sections of the book, bringing you all the emotional powered goodness. As a long-time lover of all things Thassilonian, and someone who almost got herself a real Sihedron tattoo, I hope you get as much enjoyment playing those dedications as much as I had writing them. While you're contemplating your next emotionally fueled spellcaster, consider rolling one up for Abomination Vaults! I had the honor to write “Hands of the Devil,” book 2 of 3 in that Adventure path.

                <h3>John Compton (he/him) – Paizo Senior Developer</h3> 
                <p>I’m John Compton, Starfinder senior developer and longtime Pathfinder author. On my first day at Paizo, colleagues encouraged me to pick a custom avatar for use on our website, and thanks to the physical resemblance, Djavin Vhrest, Curator of Apocrypha at the Forae Logos library became my visual signature. Especially as I worked on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4d?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Concordance-of-Rivals"><em>Concordance of Rivals</em></a> I quickly connected with the character’s voice, mannerisms, and subtle barbs as we explored fictitious occultism. When the bard became the archetypical occult spellcaster in Pathfinder’s second edition, I found myself struggling to understand that new association forged between eclectic, storytelling musicians and the spooky, weird magic. Through the lens of Djavin Vhrest, I found an answer, and it’s my delight to have explored the nature of occult spellcasting in <em>Secrets of Magic</em>.</p> 
                <p>If you’d like to hear more from me, I frequent Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/Archaeotagh">@archaeotagh</a>), as well as the Pathfinder RPG and Starfinder RPG servers on Discord. Definitely check out my more recent works like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution"><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em></a> (nanocyte, mechs, drones, demolitions, and more), <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024x2?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Vast-Experiment-Falling-into-Deliverance"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #3-04: Falling Into Deliverance</em></a>, and recent fiction featuring the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shqu?Meet-the-Iconics-Veerkea">iconic nanocyte</a>. I love writing about our setting, its history, its cosmology, and its cultures, and it’s my pleasure to have contributed to those through works like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, as well as upcoming books like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>!</p>

                <p>Hello there! I’m Ruvaid, a Pakistani-American writer who’s been playing Pathfinder Second Edition since release. I’m super stoked to have been a part of this great book alongside so many amazing people. I wrote a bunch of magic items that made it into both the consumable and permanent item sections. I’m excited to see what you all think, and to see those items used in action. You can find more of my work for Paizo in Bestiary 3, as well as books 2 and 3 of the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path, and hopefully in more future books! If you’d like to try out any of the awesome new options from this book with me, I run a discord channel that hosts Pathfinder Society games every Saturday morning at 9am EST, and I would love to have you in it! You can also find me playing a Pathfinder Second Edition homebrew campaign, The Longstriders, on Wednesday nights at 9pm EST with a group of awesome people on Twitch at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/codygarettwells" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/codygarettwells</a>. I’m also on Twitter @Darth_Ruvaider, where I talk about my work, Pathfinder as a whole, FFXIV, and whatever else comes to mind. I’m always looking for interesting projects or even just people to talk games with, so feel free to send me a message! I hope you all enjoy this book, and I will perhaps catch you on another blog some time again, someday – cheers!

                <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her)</h3> 
                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full-time freelance author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo since I started freelancing two years ago, including seven organized play scenarios, Pathfinder’s <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, and <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, and Starfinder’s <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, and <em>The Gilded Cage</em> (book 6 of the <em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Path). Some of my upcoming releases include Guns &amp; Gears, Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, Tech Revolution, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>! For <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I wrote Elementalism and a bunch of new spells. </p> 
                <p><em>Secrets of Magic</em> is a really unique book, and I desperately look forward to cracking open a copy. I hope you enjoy <em>Secrets of Magic</em> as much as I do! You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/d20diaries" target="_blank">@d20diaries</a>.<br> Until next time, <br> Jessica</p>

                <h3>Andrew White (He/Him) – Paizo Front End Engineering Lead</h3> 
                <p>Hello! I'm Andrew White, Paizo's front-end engineering lead and occasional contributor to various Pathfinder and Starfinder projects, including <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, <em>Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, and a handful of super secret, as-yet unannounced things. <em>Secrets of Magic</em> was a blast to work on; I wrote a bunch of luck-focused and miscellaneous utility spells and a couple of rituals, and I am unreasonably happy that my weird spell that makes inanimate objects sentient without giving them the ability to move or communicate made it into the final product. Hope you have fun with it!</p>

                <h3>Minty Belmont of the Belmont System (She/her and Dae/Daem)</h3> 
                <p>I’m Minty! I’m a plural polyamorous trans woman. You may know me from my work on a little series called “Hot or Not”, a series I run on @rpgegirl on twitter where we rate TTRPG monsters (and aliens) as to whether they are hot or not! We dive into the lore, the way monsters are built, and the general artwork for it! I’m also something of a Twitch streamer at <a href="http://twitch.tv/shineychariot" target="_blank">twitch.tv/shineychariot</a> on Monday–Thursday nights, and I do moderation work for Twitch streamers in my free time. I’ve been playing Tabletop RPGs for over half my life now. Currently, I’m just obsessed with the Paizo family of products, but previously I’ve played D&amp;D 3.5, a little bit of 4e, D20 modern, D&amp;D 5e, Numenera, Zombie Survivalist second edition, Interstitial, and a little bit of Pathfinder first edition. In the past I’ve made an entire TTRPG myself that’s on hiatus for development and have written a few homebrew classes for 5e and mini homebrew adventures for Pathfinder 2e! My favorite monster for Pathfinder Second Edition is the Cacodaemon, and for Starfinder it’s the Calecor and literally any undead creature. If you had a gun to my head asking what my favorite ice cream was, first I’d ask you to put the gun down and then tell you it’s birthday cake and you could have just asked. </p>

                <p>In <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I wrote a variety of different sections, including a few items and spells like <em>scorching ray</em> and the flexible preparation section of the Book of Unlimited Magic. But my favorite contribution was the treatise on magical essences. I’ve been excited to expand on the philosophical underpinnings of those essences with all of you for a while, and I hope you enjoy the treatise!</p>

                <p>Hello, I’m Shay and I wrote the sympathetic rituals for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>! I’ve been freelance writing and editing for Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder lines for over a year now, and they’ve definitely kept me busy with work. My next available piece of work is the Starfinder Society Scenario 4-06, which I wrote on my own and I’m both excited and nervous to have it out there for everyone! You can also keep an eye out for my contributions in the upcoming <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>!

                <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> 
                <p>Дорогие читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you might remember me from <em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, and <em>PFS #1-15: Blooming Catastrophe</em> and <em>PFS #2-08: A Frosty Mug</em>. Yes, I am the winter wolf hockey person!</p> 
                <p>For <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I did a passel of spells and rites, including our very own Elizabeth Báthory-themed immortality rite (bring a towel) and <em>mystic panoply</em>, for when your wizard simply must look <em>fabulous</em>. But I’m most proud of the Arcane Treatise. I’ve always wondered, what exactly does magic feel like, how do you actually learn it, how do all of these highly intelligent wizards understand their own spellcasting? Getting a chance to try and answer those questions was an absolute treat.</p> 
                <p>But let’s talk about my other big project for a moment. <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is an upcoming PF2 Campaign Setting, a swashbuckling city of intrigue and weirdness built atop the ruins of a very different world. How does magic work when compared to the grandeur of the Preboreal Age, or to the alien omnipotence of the Angels? You’ll need to wait for a bit to find out, but in the meantime you can check out our twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>, and keep an eye out for our second Kickstarter, coming soon (<em>Armaments of the Luminant Age</em>)!</p>

                <p>Liane Merciel has written for numerous fantasy and gaming shared worlds, including Pathfinder, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Bioware's Dragon Age universe, and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. She lives in Philadelphia with her family, which recently expanded to include Catherine the Great, aka "the Grub," who at two months old has already expressed an appreciation for Norwegian gothic metal and skull-festooned demons. Truly, a fine family tradition carries on.</p>

                <h3>Michael Sayre (He/Him) – Paizo Designer</h3> 
                <p>Yo! I'm Michael Sayre and I worked on the shadow magic section of Secrets of Magic. I've also worked on quite a few other products for Paizo, including acting as design lead for the upcoming <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> book, as well as working with a number of third-party publishers supporting Pathfinder first and second editions, D&amp;D 5E, and more. <em>Secrets of Magic</em> was an exciting book to work on as it represents the first book looking at new and interesting ways we can advance the game and introduce new options in innovative and unique formats. As the game continues to grow beyond the core foundation of the game represented by the CRB, APG, GMG, and Bestiaries, I'm really looking forward to more books like <em>Secrets of Magic</em> that can make both the world of Golarion and the rules of the game evolve in exciting ways! You can find some of my third-party work on DriveThruRPG at <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?author=Michael%20Sayre" target="_blank">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?author=Michael%20Sayre</a> and you can find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJSayre1">@MichaelJSayre1</a></p>

                <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> 
                <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I've been freelancing for about five years, doing both Pathfinder and Starfinder. For Secrets of Magic, I did some spells, including the incarnate spells previewed in an earlier blog. Coming up with super-powerful entities you can summon—but only keep hold of briefly—was a lot of fun, and I look forward to seeing what new incarnate spells might pop up in the future!</p> 
                <p>As for my most recent Paizo projects, I'm an author on the upcoming <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> and the recently released <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> for Starfinder. I've got some other cool things in the works, but nothing I can talk about yet! When I'm not freelancing game stuff, I can usually be found writing fiction, reading, playing various video games, or baking in my very tiny Boston kitchen. I've just started up an ongoing blog series on my website where I make a new, fully statted NPC every couple weeks, alternating between Pathfinder and Starfinder. If you're looking for some NPCs to pop into your games, you can check that out at <a href="https://klspeedling.com/" target="_blank">klspeedling.com</a>. You can also find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a>, where I'm making a valiant attempt to be slightly more active. (Fun side note: this blog is scheduled to come out on my birthday!)</p>

                <h3>Jason Tondro (he/him) – Paizo Developer</h3> 
                <p>ason is a developer on the Starfinder RPG, where he helps to create Adventure Path volumes and stand-alone modules; when there’s three Jasons in the same Paizo meeting and it gets confusing, you can call him Jake. Jake was a college professor for many years, teaching writing, film, and world literature—especially from the medieval and Renaissance periods. He earned his PhD at the University of California Riverside—focusing on superhero stories across comics, film, and television—and that’s where he was given the nickname “Doctor Comics.” These days, however, he works with tabletop RPGs much more than with comics. Jake joined Paizo over three years ago as part of the editorial team, just as Pathfinder Second Edition was announced, and learned much from his colleagues over a year and a half. His first big project as a Starfinder developer was Fly Free or Die, a 6-volume adventure path about working class heroes trying to make ends meet in a cruel and greedy universe; the final volume to that AP came out in April, and while he assists Jason (see!) Keeley on Horizons of the Vast, he’s working on unannounced future projects. He lives in Seattle with Miss Tessmacher and Otis, his rescue dogs. He’s on social media—<a href="https://twitter.com/doctorcomics">@doctorcomics</a> (Twitter); Jason’s “Starfinder Developer Diary” videos walking through every aspect of AP development can be found on YouTube at the BAMF Podcast channel.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029ul">Legendary Monks II (PFRPG) PDF</a></h3> 
                <p><em>Legendary Monks II</em> is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements! This volume is centered on the wise and capable masters of combat and mysticism, those paragons of insight known as monks. This new version of the base class introduced in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em> was designed to be an agile combatant specialized in unarmed fighting, honing their body into a force that could rival weapons and armor forged by the most capable of smiths. This book is intended to build upon that promise, as well as expand the class with flavorful and potent character-building options that fully explore the many paths to perfection. This legendary monk class is intended to allow the monk to further specialize their combat through several new and redesigned class features such as Path of Mastery, which provides a strong foundation for a monk's journey, whether based on strength, agility, or mysticism; Monk Arts, which grant them several means of using their new Qi resource; and Combo Strikes, which reward legendary monks for taking full advantage of their rapid-fire style of fighting. Furthermore, brand new archetypes provide further opportunities to construct unique characters, such as the black powder-fueled Combustion Knuckle and their special firearm-based combat, the gregarious Champion of the People who supports and inspires their comrades-in-arms, and the fierce Yaksha Disciple who channels the dread-inducing abilities of terrifying guardian spirits.

                <p><em>Legendary Sorcerers</em> is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements, this time focused on those spellcasters gifted with magical power beyond their own comprehension. These mystical savants are arcane spellcasters, but the form of their magic is altered by the origin of their power. The legendary sorcerer is a fully redesigned version of the core caster class, with a unique class feature that grants spellcasting flexibility, makes cantrips more useful, and expands bloodlines to allow customization of your inherent powers rather than fixed advancement. No matter the quest, the legendary sorcerer is ready for adventure, with 13 bloodlines including the Aberrant Sorcerer, who mutates with each spell cast; the Draconic Sorcerer, who can exhale spells; the Elemental Sorcerer, who combines physical strength with the summoning of energy; and the Undead Sorcerer, whose magic curses those they touch. You'll also find six spectacular archetypes like the arcane seeker, impulsive mage, and disciple of violence, alongside nearly two dozen sensational spells and feats perfect for unleashing your arcane power with fantastic flair.

                <p>The Cartomancer is a brand-new class for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>, a spellcaster dabbling in every magical tradition as they draw power from a card deck that is equal parts weapon and magical focus. Mystical gamblers and masters of chance, cartomancers use their cards as tools for weaving spells with decks that may focus on divination, illusion, and mental manipulation through occult magic; flora, fauna, and the elements with a primal deck; the raw power of life and death with a divine deck; or the diverse and balanced options of an arcane deck, along with over 50 class feats, from Combination Discard and Pass the Deal to Aces and Eights and Three Card Monte, plus a dozen more feats, traits, and backgrounds. You'll also find a complete system of Card Casting, with unique spells like arcane erosion, untouchable ward, gambler's guise, and bend nature for every card in a standard deck that you can heighten and empower by varying the number of cards you devote to their power from your mystic hand. You'll also get focus spells like cartomancy and dead man's hand and a bestiary with nearly a dozen specialized card constructs to unleash on your enemies.

                <h3>Pathfinder Society (second edition)</h3> 
                <p>The following Adventures now award 24 days of Downtime: </p> 
                <ul>

                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes"><em>Age of Ashes Adventure Path</em></a></li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse"><em>Extinction Curse Adventure Path</em></a></li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>The following Adventures now award 8 days of Downtime:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Each level of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dx?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box"><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box: Menace Under Otari</em></a></li> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024ys?Pathfinder-Adventure-Little-Trouble-in-Big-Absalom"><em>Little Trouble in Big Absalom</em></a> (initially awarded 2)</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Players who have already played these adventures may treat the Downtime as if they succeeded (but did not critically succeed) at an <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=23">Earn Income activity</a> appropriate to the level at which they applied the Chronicle Sheet (so a 3rd-level character would earn 5 sp per day of Downtime). Mark the gold earned on your most recent Chronicle Sheet with a note about its source.</p> 
                <p>The following Adventures now award 4 Reputation with your chosen Faction:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027oe?Pathfinder-OneShot-1-Sundered-Waves"><em>Pathfinder One-Shot #1: Sundered Waves</em></a></li>

                 <li><em>Little Trouble in Big Absalom</em> (initially awarded 1)</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Make a note on your most recent Chronicle Sheet to reflect the increased Reputation. We’ve already updated these Reputation values in the reporting system and applied them to your character’s default faction. If you see any errors, please email <a href="mailto:orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com">orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com</a> to have them corrected.</p> 
                <p><b>A note on Little Trouble in Big Absalom:</b> This adventure, despite taking 3-4 hours to run, currently awards credit as though it were about half that length. <b>This was an error on our part, and we apologize for it.</b> We can’t retroactively fix the XP now, because that would have cascading effects upon your characters, but we want you to know that we regret the error and our failure to fix it quickly, and that it’s not our intent going forward. If an adventure takes 4 hours to play, it will award credit as if it were a scenario.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> 
                <p>The following Adventures now grant Day Job rolls:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot"><em>Skitter Shot</em></a></li>

                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024yr?Starfinder-Adventure-Skitter-Home"><em>Skitter Home</em></a></li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/deadSuns"><em>Dead Suns</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/againsttheaeonthrone"><em>Against the Aeon Throne</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/signalofscreams"><em>Signal of Screams</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/dawnofflame"><em>Dawn of Flame</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm"><em>Attack of the Swarm!</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> 
                 <li>Each volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy"><em>The Threefold Conspiracy</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Players who have already played these adventures may treat the Day Job rolls as if they earned credits equal to 10x the level at which the chronicle was applied (so a 4th-level character would earn 40 credits per Day Job roll). This applies only if the character had at least one rank in the Profession skill at the time; characters who wouldn’t have made a Day Job roll don’t earn these credits. Make a note of these credits on your most recent Chronicle Sheet along with a note explaining their source.</p> 
                <p>The following Adventure now awards 2 Reputation with your chosen Faction:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uo/discuss?Starfinder-OneShot-1-Band-on-the-Run"><em>Starfinder One-Shot #1: Band on the Run</em></a></li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Additionally, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029vf?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight"><em>Starfinder Adventure: Junker’s Delight</em></a> is now sanctioned for play! The sanctioning documents for Junker’s Delight follow our new format and model for rewards, so you shouldn’t have any issues applying credit to your characters. If you see any errors, do let us know so we can correct them and the template moving forward.</p> 
                <p>We are working to update the sanctioning documents for all sanctioned adventures; we hoped to have them for this blog, but doing so turned into a larger series of tasks than we expected. We’re aiming to have them all updated in the next two weeks and will let you know with a comment on this blog once they are completed. You don’t need to wait for the updated documents to get the corrected rewards. We just want to make sure the information isn’t buried in a blog post, making it difficult to find easily. </p> 
                <p>Going forward, our intention is that all sanctioned Adventures will award XP, Reputation and Downtime or Day Job rolls, as well as a level-appropriate amount of gold or credits. We’re updating our internal templates now to avoid variations in the future. If we missed an adventure that isn’t giving out rewards properly, please let us know!</p> 
                <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And keep good records!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Oooh!” chirped Barsala, folding her goggles down over her eyes. She peered at the man’s leg, an image of the limb’s internal circuitry magnifying in her goggle’s lens. “The quality on your inner gyros is excellent. Liquid carbide receptors?”</p> 
                <p>“Can I see?” asked Keskodai. With a soft clicking of his mandibles, he leaned over to get a closer look. “Chhk-chhk, look! See the pistons! Look at the little energy regulators, aren’t they pretty?”</p> 
                <p>Raising one hand, Barsala waved at the shirren. “Kes, please hun, you’re in my light.”</p> 
                <p>“But you can see the problem, right?” asked Amril. Twitching nervously, the young man drummed his fingers against the arm of the chair. “I mean, is it the regulators? I hope it’s not the regulators. They should still be under warranty. Do you think it’s the compression circuits?”</p> 
                <p>“Calm down,” said Barsala. The words felt hollow in the face of her own burgeoning excitement. “It’ll be—”</p> 
                <p>Abruptly, his leg kicked. Trembling abruptly, the servos within whirred energetically. “Look!” yelped Amril, the lashunta’s antenna shivering, “It’s doing it again!”</p> 
                <p>“Fascinating... Kes, could you hand me the capacitor over there?”</p> 
                <p>Inhaling, Amril turned his eyes toward the ceiling of Barsala’s laboratory. “I knew I shouldn’t have got it cut rate. Stupid counterfeit augments. The price was just too good. But then it started acting up. I checked the actual prosthetic parts. I mean, I had it checked—an engineer. One of the mechanics down at the junk races said its fine...”</p> 
                <p>“They’re right,” commented Barsala, carefully separating two metal plates with two of her hands while magnifying her lenses with another. “In as far as the hardware is in working order. Whatever the problem is, it’s with the... Kes, please, you’re in my light again... it’s with the software.”</p> 
                <p>Another juddering tremor flew through Amril’s leg. He leaned up in the chair, excitedly. “I knew it! I mean, I knew you’d be able to figure it out. The moment I saw your vids, I knew Dr. B was the right person for the job! What are you going to do?”</p> 
                <p>“Did you hear that, Chhk-chhk? Our friend Barsala’s an expert.”</p> 
                <p>“I am hardly an expert on <em>this</em> particular subject, Chhk-Chhk, but,” she slid a glove free from her lowleft hand, exposing the chrome fingers beneath, “I do have some personal experience with cybernetic prosthetics.” Flexing her fingers, she slid back a thumb-sized port on the back of her palm. “Rudimentary system scan,” she explained. “My prosthetic has a proprietary Helix Computing interface, I’ll log into your software, give it a quick scan, and check the integration files to your wetware.”</p>

                <br> 
                <p>Glancing up at Keskodai, Amril asked “What does that mean?”</p> 
                <p>The shirren gave a soft shrug, his multifaceted insectile eyes seeming to widen in wonder.</p> 
                <p>Carefully, Barsala unwound a small connector cable from one of her many pockets, sliding one end into the port on her hand. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. I’ll go for a manual interface, so it’ll be more secure. Your internal firewall’s up to date?”</p> 
                <p>“I... think so?” tried the lashunta, hesitantly, as the biohacker slid the cable into his leg’s interface port. “I had a new one installed last week, after the twitching started.”</p> 
                <p>“Fascinating,” murmured the kasatha, drumming her fingers across a set of hard-light keys on her holographic display. “There’s some redundant files here. I can’t see any function for them. Do you have anything stored in them?”</p> 
                <p>“Couple of vid shows.” replied Amril. “Don’t look in the download section, please. I might have downloaded them illegally.”</p> 
                <p>With a few more taps from her three non-interfaced hands, Barsala announced, “Scanning now. Wait.” A sharp pause cut her voice silent. Then, glancing at the man’s cybernetic leg, she said “This is odd. The files are duplicating.” A second hard-light window appeared on the biohacker’s display—quickly joined by another. Then another.</p> 
                <p>“Chhk-chhk wants to know if that’s bad.” enquired Keskodai. “It looks bad.”</p> 
                <p>A series of digital windows blazed into life around Barsala, flaring like a cradle of stars. As they did, Amril’s leg shuddered violently, its pistons whirring at a fanatical speed, showering crackling sparks across the floor. “We’ve got exponential duplication!” yelled Barsala. “These aren’t redundant files—someone’s using them as a back door! Kes, quick—”</p> 
                <p>Abruptly, Barsala’s hand twisted upward, violently pulling her trailing cable from Amril’s port. The biohacker gave a sharp yelp as her cybernetic fingers tensed into claws and turned toward her. Violently, her rogue hand lashed out, clawing and swiping at her face.</p> 
                <p>“My! This is exciting!” chittered Keskodai. “I knew this would be a thrilling field trip. Do you need one of the inhibitors?” He asked nonchalantly, scanning a wide array which hung from the wall.</p> 
                <p>“The blue one!” called Barsala, latching two free hands around her rebellious prosthetic. Her cybernetic hand continued to flail, lashing out with her fingertips. She staggered back, wrestling frantically with her hand.</p> 
                <p>Quickly, Keskodai scooped up a sturdy metal cylinder marked with a blue label and hurled it over to the biohacker. Catching it deftly with her last free hand, Barsala wrestled her cybernetic hand down onto a cluttered workbench with the other two, scattering small vials and tubes. Holding her thrashing, violent hand down, she tugged open the interface port once again. “Okay,” she muttered, “that should override my biological systems long enough to isolate this thing...”</p> 
                <p>“What is it?” cried Amril, eyes wide in shock.</p> 
                <p>“Offensive countermeasure” replied Barsala. “Someone left a sentient computer virus in your prosthetic’s firmware.”</p> 
                <p>Amril sat bolt upright, looking down at his leg in panic. “A virus?”</p> 
                <p>Rolling up her sleeve, Barsala pushed the canister containing the inhibitor against her upper arm. It gave a soft hiss as the contents discharged, filling her bloodstream. “It was protecting a backdoor into your augment.” She explained, dropping the canister. Her arteries radiated a momentary glow. “Know anyone who’d want to hack your systems?” she asked.</p> 
                <p>“Hacking?” spat Amril. “No! Definitely not! I don’t have any enemies!” he paused. “Actually, wait, maybe it might be...”</p> 
                <p>With a series of thuds, Barsala’s augmented hand forced itself up from was held. Gritting her teeth in agitation, she grunted and grabbed a micro-welding torch. “Right!” she declared, crackling it to life. “Time for some surgical reprogramming!”</p> 
                <p>As she began to rewire the hand’s circuitry in deft, sharp moves, Keskodai watched in fascination. “Hmm,” he pondered, tapping a thin claw-tip against his chin. “Chhk-chhk wants to know if you can simply eject the hardware.” he asked. “If it’s trying to kill you, that is. Perhaps we can take it off and put it in a box for now?”</p> 
                <p>“Don’t need to” replied Barsala, her eyes focused intently on the work. A small shower of sparks flew from her hand. “I’ve confined the virus to a partition of the limb’s memory, which should let me get root access to... wait, Chhk-chhk wants to know?”</p> 
                <p>“Ah, yes,” trilled the shirren cheerfully. “You see, at this stage in larval development, we’ve formed a telepathic bond that’s strong enough for in-depth conversation. In fact, I’d be quite happy to discuss—”</p> 
                <p>“Maybe later.” she interrupted, dropping the torch onto the workbench, and opening another section of the limb. “I think... yes, let me just finish this scan... okay, system’s clear.”</p> 
                <p>Amril rubbed his head, his antennas drooping. “Is that it?” he asked. “The virus is gone?”</p> 
                <p>The biohacker slowly let go of her hand and bent each finger to test her control of her prosthetic, looking carefully for signs of any malicious intent. For a few moments she held her breath. Then, slowly, she gave a sigh of relief. “Scan’s clear,” she said. “Virus is gone. I’ve kept a log of if you want to watch it. In either case, your leg should be fine now.”</p> 
                <p>Whirling around to face her, Amril rubbed his eyes. “That’s... that’s amazing.” he muttered. “Thank you. Thank you so much. It feels a lot better.”</p> 
                <p>Flexing her fingers once more, Barsala reached into her pocket to recover her surgical glove. “We’ll still need to find out who hacked the limb.” She announced. “You’re quite sure you don’t have any enemies?”</p> 
                <p>Clapping his hands together, Amril inhaled. “Well, maybe that wasn’t quite true. Y’see...”</p> 
                <p>A heavy thud echoed through the laboratory. Somewhere in the distance, the ever-present hum of the power systems fell abruptly silent. The lab’s internal lights shuddered to darkness, replaced with the ghostly glow of emergency red illumination. “What?” snapped the biohacker.</p> 
                <p>“Okay,” admitted Amril, “so, I didn’t want to mention it, but I’m part of a group of hackers...”</p> 
                <p>Keskodai held up a hand. “Don’t want to interrupt” he said, “but I can sense six minds moving towards us. They seem... hostile. Friends of yours?”</p> 
                <p>“No!” yelled Amril, glancing around the room. “Okay, look, so we were sniffing around some corporate files, and...”</p> 
                <p>A heavy thud echoed from the other side of the laboratory’s door.</p> 
                <p>Barsala sighed, shaking her head, and calmly started to load her needler pistol. “And this was meant to be my weekend off.”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Lini held her palms out, and water encased the skeletons instantly. She winced from the effort of throwing the spell so fast. The casting’s sparkling light illuminated the skeletons’ silhouettes slowly wading through the wall of water she’d created. It wouldn’t hold for long, but it would buy them time.</p> 
                <p>“Droo, let’s—” the words died on her lips.</p> 
                <p>Droogami, Lini’s leopard companion, clutched another skeleton in his formidable jaws, slamming down it into the newly created mud. Bones crunched as Droo wrestled with their enemy. The skeleton must have been just inside Lini’s spell. She drew her sling, then loaded it and let fly in one easy motion. Bone dust plumed in the air as her missile hit the undead creature’s skull with a satisfying crack. With well-practiced movements, Droo and Lini spread out, flanking their enemy, forcing it to divide its attention between them. When its bones finally collapsed into a truly dead pile in the mud, Lini sighed in relief.</p> 
                <p>A bony hand burst from the wall of water and clasped her throat. Lini desperately kicked up water and rocks as she fought to pry the clawed fingers from her neck. That’s what she got for letting her attention wander. She looked straight into the empty sockets of the undead monster choking her. The skeleton’s arm and head poked through the wall of water, and she saw more coming. The world wavered around the edges as she twisted as hard as she could. Droo took that opportunity to leap forward, breaking the monster’s hold. The leopard roared and crouched on his mud-caked haunches, ready to attack the rest.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>“No! Droo! Let’s go!” They couldn’t take this many on.</p> 
                <p>Lini had known dangerous undead lurked throughout the Gravelands, but she hadn’t realized they were so many of them. Instead of attacking, Droogami leapt to her side, and she clambered onto the leopard’s spotted back. They took off down the ravine. Her watery spell wouldn’t last for much longer, and she meant to be as far away from here as possible.</p> 
                <p>Mud and water flew as Droo sprinted down the path. Lini took a chance to look over her shoulder. They were gaining a little distance. Some of the skeletons were out of the water and shambling toward them, faster than Lini would have liked. More skeletons were still pulling themselves out of the wall.</p> 
                <p>In front of them, another kind of wall, one made of rock and loose dirt loomed. It seemed steep but clambering up it looked to be their only way out. Lini lowered herself closer to Droo’s fur and peeked over his head as the ravine wall grew closer. Seconds later, Droo’s muscles rippled, and Lini steadied herself for the great cat’s leap. They had done this many times, and her stomach still dropped to the bottom of her feet every time. Droogami hit the ravine wall and dug his ragged claws into the dirt. They started to slide, and Droo’s muscles bulged with the effort of keeping them in place. Slowly, the leopard scrabbled up, and they ascended the ravine.</p> 
                <p>Behind them, the spell creating the water reached the end of its duration, and the liquid wall collapsed, knocking most of the skeletons off their feet.</p> 
                <p>Silence greeted the pair as they clambered onto the ledge. Lini dismounted Droogami and peered down into the ravine. They’d been crossing its bed when the skeletons had begun rising from the dirt. The corruption here was much worse than she previously believed. She could taste it on her tongue, feel it all the way from her head to her toes. Lini had a horrible feeling there were more undead out there, much worse than skeletons.</p> 
                <p>Screams echoed around them and both Lini and Droogami crouched into ready positions. The cries had come from the other side of the ravine where smoke rose over a small holdfast on the horizon. Lini’s heart pounded. Many people had abandoned this land after the return of the Whispering Tyrant, but some still held on. They’d lived here for as long as they could remember; their ancestors knew this place as Lastwall. Lini and Droo had stayed with them to gather information before they crossed the ravine. The people had treated them fairly and shared what little they had. Lini remembered the hopeful face of the young girl who curled up next to Droo and fell asleep listening to tales of adventure.</p> 
                <p>Lini scanned the whole area. There was no way they could make it around the ravine in time. She looked back down to the ravine floor. The skeletons had fully recovered now and were trudging toward them.</p> 
                <p>“We have to go back, Droo,” Lini said.</p> 
                <p>The leopard looked at her and gave a soft growl.</p> 
                <p>“I know, but it’s the quickest way, and they need our help.” Lini looked into the leopard’s eyes, hoping her companion would feel what she felt.</p> 
                <p>Droo chuffed softly after a moment and crouched down with a determined look.</p> 
                <p>“I knew you’d understand, old friend,” Lini said.</p> 
                <p>Lini climbed up onto her companion’s back once again. She sat straight and squeezed Droogami's ribs with her knees, tightly enough to keep her in place. She held her hands up to the sky and they started to glow. Lini took a deep breath and narrowed her eyes. She thought of the people to steel her nerves.</p> 
                <p>“Let’s go.”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">I’m excited to share that Paizo will once again be participating in the Mox Gauntlet charity game tournament, and it’s coming up this Sunday!</p> 
                <p>The Gauntlet has become an annual tradition for us at Paizo, and we’ve been participating since our victory at the very first event. Every year the folks from <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&amp;eventID=500" target="_blank">Gamers Engaged</a>— the charitable giving arm of Card Kingdom, Inc.—put together a fantastic gaming tournament to raise funds for a local charity. This year, proceeds are going to <a href="https://youngwomenempowered.org/" target="_blank">Young Women Empowered</a>, an organization whose mission is to cultivate the power of diverse young women to be creative leaders and courageous changemakers. They offer various camps, workshops, partnerships, and public events to help these young women connect, learn, and grow. </p> 
                <p>You can support us on our <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/team/paizo" target="_blank">team donation page</a> or by donating to the team members individually. Our roster has some familiar faces this year, as well as some newer folks. I’m thrilled to be captain of Team Paizo for the 3rd event in a row and participating in the Gauntlet for my fifth time. I’ve pledged to send out a punny space postcard as an optional incentive for $25 donations made direct to my <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=1048">donation page</a>. Aboard the Paizo rocket ship we’ve also got Organized Play Associate Alex Speidel, who promised a plethora of intriguing incentives on <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/participant/Alex-Speidel" target="_blank">his donation page</a>; Customer Service Representative Austin Phillips (<a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/participant/1050" target="_blank">donate here</a>); and our new VP of Sales and E-Commerce, Mike Webb (<a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/participant/Michael-Webb" target="_blank">donation link</a>). Starfinder Lead Designer Joe Pasini (<a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=1058" target="_blank">donate to Joe</a>) rounds things out as an alternate in case someone gets pushed out the airlock at the last minute. </p> 
                <p>This year’s theme is Cosmos, so we’ll be taking on a slew of space-based challenges. Firstly, we’ll be split up into separate games of Space Park, then reunited as a team in the second round for cosmos-themed trivia. As usual, the organizers have kept the third-round finale a secret, so we’ll all be on the dark side of the moon until the big reveal on Sunday! </p> 
                <p>The Gauntlet will be held virtually this year, and the entire thing will be streamed through the <a href="https://www.gamersengaged.com/" target="_blank">Gamers Engaged website</a>. Be sure to tune in to watch our progress and cheer us on! Donations are being accepted until the end of the event and not only do these funds go to a great cause, but our team can gain power-ups to use in the tournament based on how much we raise. You can help us launch our fundraising goals into orbit! We appreciate every single donation and share on social media—every bit helps. Thanks so much for being a part of our tremendously supportive gaming community. We’ll see you at noon Pacific Daylight Time on August 15th!</p>

                <a href="/image/content/Blog/080621_UrbanBiomePreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/080621_UrbanBiomePreview_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">The skittermander at the counter flexed his fingers and grinned. “What’ll it be, nufriend?”</p> 
                <p>“Nufriend?” Tono smirked. “Every night I come here and order the same thing, and suddenly you ain’t know me, Henig?” </p> 
                <p>Henig let out a deep chortle, as if it were emerging from his feet and rising out of his body. “No, no! It’s just that…” He leaned over the counter, inches from Tono’s face. “You know how the streets can be,” he whispered. “Funny business afoot, and all that. Don’t want anybody making off with your whereabouts, gree?”</p> 
                <p>Tono gave a gentle nod, the neon of the night glancing off her chrome dermal plate. She had been working on this side of the surface for only eight months, and even she had made enough enemies to know better than for any of them to know where she slept. If just one of their associates ever knew she also was willing to drive this far into the city just for a bowl of noodles and a conversation in the middle of the night, she’d be face down in the alley beside the shop with a fist-sized gap in her belly. Tono winced at the thought—she hadn’t scrounged enough recent work to pay for another check-up, let alone replace a cybernetic augmentation.</p> 
                <p>Strangely, her justification for habitually returning was twofold. For one thing, this part of the city was where all her informants were. For another, she grinned wide at the chef and said what she always said whenever he worried about her getting in trouble because of him. “You ain’t gotta worry ‘bout me, Hen… only nice people come by your shop.” </p>

                </div> 
                <p>“Is that right?” He chuckled again. “Then how come you’re here so often?” </p> 
                <p>Tono nodded in amused agreement before ordering a large bowl of the house special. She tried not to bring her work—or her difficult demeanor—to Henig’s shop whenever she could avoid it, but she knew she wasn’t easy to deal with. He probably didn’t know what she did, but word got around quickly. Which is why she regretted having to ask her next question. “Have you seen Mirai about?” </p> 
                <p>Henig raised an eyebrow. “Mirai? She in some kind o’ trouble?” </p> 
                <p>The apertures in Tono’s eyes tensed. She noticed it right away. She always trusted that Henig was smarter than the goofy, kindhearted cook he presented as. “You know something.” </p> 
                <p>Henig’s lower limbs continued pulling dough into thick noodles as he spoke. He glanced down pensively, and then toward the street, as if worried someone would find him. “Two folks in black came up the block asking for her, but I hadn’t actually seen her come out to the market in days. Made it sound like they’d been to her apartment… didn’t find nothing. If you’re asking for her…” He frowned. “Gotta think she’s on the run for some reason, gree?”</p> 
                <p>“But why?” </p> 
                <p>“You really askin’ me?” Henig shot her a wicked glare. “The same reasons you’d run. Is she in trouble?” </p> 
                <p>“I don’t know. I asked her to check something for me. Just a chat with some folks at Fythe Dynamics for a client… a routine interview with Sepp Yolen. I thought it was nothing…”</p> 
                <p>“Politely, I’ll ask.” Henig looked right at her. “Is it ever <em>nothing</em> with either of you?” </p> 
                <p>Tono struggled for the next words and resigned herself to just a shake of the head. </p> 
                <p>“Exactly.” He lit the stove behind him without looking. “I wish I had more to give you. Just… black suits, cold eyes, no manners. And one of ‘em, a lashunta woman, had a scar across the lip like so.” He made a diagonal downward motion across his own face, then shrugged. “Mean folks. Don’t want to see those two in a hurry again.”</p> 
                <p>Tono tilted her head. “The suits… d’you figure they were top-notch?” </p> 
                <p>“Maybe some of the most drift threads I’ve ever seen,” he said, finally casting an eye on the simmering stock pot behind him. “Probably thought I couldn’t tell the duds concealed armor. Figured they were well-paid hired hands of some sort.”</p> 
                <p>“Any insignias on the clothes?”</p> 
                <p>“No patches. Just a silver pin on the collar.” He wiped a large blue ceramic bowl and placed it in front of her. “Why?” </p> 
                <p>Tono smirked. “No reason at all. I’ll be back in a bit. And my food better be waiting.” </p> 
                <p>“Whatever you say, friend.”</p> 
                <p>Tono got up and stretched before strolling back down the busy market street beside the shop. This part had to be done carefully, she thought. </p> 
                <p>People tended to be very alert when they were tailing someone, after all. </p> 
                <p>Tono was paranoid, to be sure, but the more precisely Henig described this lashunta woman, the more obvious her presence became, just a few dozen feet away, watching them talk the entire time. She may have followed Tono the whole way, in fact, or even watched her leave her apartment. Without making eye contact, Tono sized the woman up. Slim, tall, lithe—the kind she figured made her coin in close combat rather than a gunfight. Even more careful, then.</p> 
                <p>Tono strolled toward where the agent stood—against the wall of a nearby bookstore—and squinted against the window. The lashunta didn’t flinch, but Tono knew better. Silence lingered in the air between them, mere inches apart. In that moment she knew they were both playing a calmness that would ready them for conflict at any moment. From that close, she could make out the vague imprint of a pair of blades under her jacket. She knew her appearance gave away her own game, as well: the quickdraw pocket in the right leg of her pants, wide enough for a sidearm, stored a static arc pistol specifically for moments like these. </p> 
                <p>“See something you like?” the lashunta said casually. </p> 
                <p>Tono didn’t even glance up at her. “So far, nothing seems especially interesting.” </p> 
                <p>“Oh, yeah?” The lashunta’s voice rose—the telltale sign that Tono had the slightest upper hand. “Hoping to find something in particular?” </p> 
                <p>“A challenge would be nice.” </p> 
                <p>Before the agent could react, Tono reached for the agent’s arm and twisted it behind her back, pinning the lashunta against the wall. Tono drew her pistol and aimed it at the small of the agent’s back, right beneath where her trapped fingers curled into a fist. </p> 
                <p>“What is wrong with y—”</p> 
                <p>“A great deal, actually,” Tono said. “But at the moment, the fact that I’m being tailed has me particularly on edge.”</p> 
                <p>“You’re being silly, lady!” </p> 
                <p>“Yeah?” Tono only needed to lift the agent’s arm for the tension and pain to increase. “Let’s check, then. Walk.” </p> 
                <p>They slowly made their way back to Henig’s counter, their demeanors strangely calm for the circumstances. When Henig saw her again, his eyes widened. “Yeah…” he said meekly. “That’s one of ‘em.”</p> 
                <p>“Was she nice to you?” </p> 
                <p>It took him only beat to pick up on the game Tono was playing. “Not one bit,” he said.</p> 
                <p>“See, my friend Henig here seems mild-mannered,” Tono said, nearly as low as a whisper. “But people tend to forget that he cuts his meat with the same sword that sears it, so I wouldn’t annoy him.” </p> 
                <p>“And what happens if I annoy you?” the agent said with a smirk. </p> 
                <p>“Scary part is, even I don’t know yet. Now talk.” </p> 
                <p>“I got nothing to—” </p> 
                <p>Henig slowly drew a skyfire sword from a drawer beneath the counter and brought it an inch from the lashunta’s face, just beneath the eyebrow. “Fine by us either way,” he said, igniting it just enough for a brief flicker of heat to grace her skin. “I hope you hate your face as much as we do…”</p> 
                <p>“Wait.” Tono sensed the faintest shift in the agent’s mood from composure to fear and back, but Henig would never see it. </p> 
                <p>“Fythe sent you?” </p> 
                <p>The agent hesitated before nodding. “The girl. She asks too many questions. We just had to nab her, make her afraid, you know? But…” </p> 
                <p>“You haven’t seen her either. So why are you following me?” </p> 
                <p>“Because…” The agent sighed. “The chairman asks us to do his wetwork when he doesn’t want to think about something. When he wants it to disappear. But Mirai? He won’t stop asking about her. He wants a meeting now, to ask for a job.” </p> 
                <p>It was Tono’s turn to be afraid. If Sepp Yolen wanted to meet, it could only mean trouble.</p> 
                <p>“You have a cruiser?” Tono growled in the agent’s ear. </p> 
                <p>The lashunta nodded. </p> 
                <p>“Good. We’re gonna take a ride. But first…” Tono reached into the woman’s jacket pocket, pulled out a credstick, and tossed it on the counter. “You’re gonna pay for my dinner.”</p> 
                <p>“That would be the nice thing to do, gree?” Henig said. “And only nice people come here.”</p>

                <h2>OPA Musings</h2> 
                <p itemprop="description">The news last week about reduced scenario production is, of course, disappointing. We’re saddened that we won’t be bringing as much new Pathfinder and Starfinder Society content to your tables, but we hope you will take this opportunity to try out some of our other sanctioned content for both programs. I myself am starting to plan for a <em>Strength of Thousands</em> run with some of our local players, and I’m very excited for it!</p> 
                <p>I did want to address a couple of points that we heard from the community in response to the announcement, which was a request for additional replay options as well as an update to the rewards given out by some of our sanctioned Adventures. To the replays, I know this has been a widely-requested option, and we’re working with tech on how we can best make the system work with the desire to replay adventures for credit. This will be a longer-term project, but we will keep you posted as we have news, it’s definitely something I want to see happen as much as the community. For the sanctioned content rewards, we’re finishing up an audit to update some of the rewards for older adventures and make sure everything is working the same going forward. Stay tuned for news on that front very soon!</p> 
                <p>Finally, one thing that I don’t want to get lost: with the release of our newest Humble Bundle, featuring <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds"><em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/beginnerbox"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a> at the physical tier, we’re excited to let you know that we’ve sanctioned the adventure in the Beginner Box, Steel Talon’s Lair! You can find the sanctioning on the product page; it awards one scenario’s worth of XP and credits, along with <b>double the Achievement Points</b>, to encourage you all to give the simplified rules of my favorite science-fantasy universe a shot. (OPM Note: The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026dl?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box"><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a> also awards <b>double the Achievement Points</b>).</p>

                <h2>Starfinder Playtest</h2> 
                <p>On Monday, the <a href="http://starfinderplaytest.com/">playtest for the new evolutionist class</a> began. This playtest is legal for games that take place during the playtest period, using the <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Playtest-Rules">rules in the Guide to Organized Play</a>. Play-by-post games may use these rules as long as the game begins prior to the conclusion of the playtest, though keep in mind that the playtest survey will close on September 24th. After the playtest concludes, evolutionist characters may not be played until the final publication of the class. We look forward to seeing the new agents in the field!</p> 
                <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>With a big month of releases comes an equally large month of sanctioning! This month, <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">we sanctioned the options</a> from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em></a> AP and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a>. For Starfinder, we also got the rules options for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual"><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie"><em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Path</a> onto the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>, as well as sanctioning the adventure included in the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/beginnerbox"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a>.</p> 
                <p>Looking ahead, we’re starting work on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic"><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, and working through the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk"><em>Devastation Ark</em> Adventure Path’s</a> options. On the horizon are <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029vf?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight"><em>Junker’s Delight</em></a>, as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/horizonsOfTheVast"><em>Horizons of the Vast</em></a> Adventure Paths once more volumes of both are released. </p> 
                <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                <p>At PAX Online, we awarded a new Campaign Service Coin. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                <p>Congratulations to <b>Betsy Nold</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID# <b>846</b>!</p> 
                <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                <p>This month, one GM earned their 5th Star for Pathfinder Society (first edition).</p> 
                <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Tommi Ketonen</p> 
                <p>If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                <p>Our remaining major conventions are <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-europe-2021"><b>PaizoCon Online Europe</b></a>, August 19-22, and <a href="https://www.gencon.com/online"><b>Gen Con Online</b></a>, September 16-19. PaizoCon Online Europe’s player signups are open now, and Gen Con Online registration will open August 15.</p> 
                <p>Remember that you can always check out the list of upcoming events at the new <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions calendar</a>!</p> 
                <h2>Gen Con Online</h2> 
                <p>The Gen Con Online catalog opens tomorrow for viewing and player registration begins at noon Eastern time on August 15. Paizo has over 450 events listed for Pathfinder Society (both first and second edition), Starfinder Society and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.</p> 
                <p>The Gen Con Online badge is free; session prices this year are as follows:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Two-hour Bounties and PACS sessions: $2</li> 
                 <li>Five-hour Scenarios: $4</li> 
                 <li>PACS Interactive Special: $6</li> 
                 <li>PFS2 and SFS Interactive Specials: $8</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Gen Con Online has a minimum price of $2 per event, regardless of length. We added a bit more to the longer/premium sessions. While online events do not have the same infrastructure costs as physical shows, there are still associated expenses we need to cover. Monies received from ticket sales at Gen Con help offset volunteer rewards, such as GM vouchers and book rewards, and pay for Discord boosts to ensure server stability during the event. We expect that when we return to Gen Con Indy, prices will be set similarly based on their pricing structure. </p> 
                <p>We look forward to player signups; if you have questions about our events, please email genconleads@gmail.com. If you are interested in volunteering, visit the Organized Play Foundation <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/popvo/" target="_blank">volunteer opportunities page</a> for more information. </p> 
                <p>Until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get ready for the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“We can take it.”</p> 
                <p>“But we don’t <em>have</em> to take it.”</p> 
                <p>Coiling an arm around the vesk’s shoulder, Veerkea gently pulled her friend into a crouch behind the fallen tree they used for cover, directing the vesk to look at her lower eyes. “It’s not about ability, Obo. It’s about need. You,” she observed, tapping Obozaya’s armor, “are a mighty vesk warrior. But that over there is a living creature that’s done nothing to offend you.” All seven of Veerkea’s eyes shimmered with empathy as the 5-foot-tall land squid pleaded with her scaly companion. “Focus on the mission, Obo.”</p> 
                <p>“I am! Look…” Obozaya stood up and glowered toward the clearing. “We came here looking for a crashed starship, right?” Veerkea extended her legs, raising her upper eyes high enough to peer over the fallen tree. The vesk gestured with her metallic staff as she kept talking, pointing out features. “How many rocks—big rocks—have you seen out here? Not many, right? But suddenly this clearing’s full of big slabs, and I’m figuring that’s no mistake.”</p> 
                <p>Veerkea alternated between peeking over the massive trunk with her upper eyes and squatting to peer under it with her lowers before glancing to Obozaya with renewed respect. “Good eye! In fact, those might not be rocks at all, but metal plates. And that might mean we’re standing atop the starship and the power core we need.” Peering over the trunk again, she wondered, “But what might have drawn this creature here?”</p> 
                <p>They both gazed at the beast perched atop the clearing’s highest point. Easily 12 feet long from snout to tail, the creature resembled a ponderous lizard with eight legs, a barrel-like body, a forest of spikes running along its back, and throat scales that occasionally glowed faintly as though the creature had swallowed a flashlight that was desperately signaling for help. Throughout the ijtikri and vesk’s hushed discussion, the beast had lazily watched them with a half-lidded eye, apparently unimpressed by its visitors and more interested in dozing in the errant sunbeam that peeked through the forest canopy here. As if to signal its nonchalant contentment, it issued a sloppy, snoring sigh and shuffled its body slightly to scratch an itch.</p> 
                <p>With wide eyes and her voice hushed with uncertainty and awe, Veerkea asked, “Maybe we—"</p> 
                <p>“—No.” The ijtikri flinched at Obozaya’s interjection. “No. You’re going to say ‘maybe we can talk to it,’ and no. It’s a glowy lizard. You got to sing happy songs with those peace-loving slugs earlier. But with big beasts, we do things my way!” Veerkea raised her arms to protest, but Obozaya waved her off. “No arguing with my scalesense, Vee. Let’s go!” Pushing off the ground with her feet and staff, Obozaya vaulted the fallen tree in a single bound.</p> 
                <p>The flustered ijtikri called after her. “But I think that’s a plasmalisk, so we need to—”</p>

                <br> 
                <p>“—Fight fire with fire, got it!” Obozaya barked confidently, as she landed in a controlled somersault. Knocking the butt of her staff against the ground as she rolled to her feet, she activated the weapon, causing a trio of plasma blades to flare to life and transform the shaft into an axe-like doshko. <em>That</em> got the lizard’s attention. Roaring with delight, Obozaya charged forward and drove the doshko’s energy blades deep into the surprised plasmalisk’s flank. The beast staggered under the impact, but it seemed unhurt. On the contrary, the creature’s flesh seemed to drink in the energy, simultaneously shorting out the doshko and causing its body to incandesce with power. The vesk barely voiced her shocked profanity before the beast moved with impossible speed that belied its bulk, twisting and slamming its tail into Obozaya’s chest and sending her flying back toward the fallen tree.</p> 
                <p>Veerkea squeaked in alarm as the vesk hurled overhead. Acting fast, she whipped her main arms upward, awakening a multitude of symbiotic nanites that spilled from her body in a torrent. The living cloud wrapped around Obozaya, cushioning her impact as she collided with a nearby tree. Yet the plasmalisk had energy to spare. Before the vesk hit the ground, it spat a fist-sized fiery globule toward the intruders. Predicting the blast, Veerkea folded her body against the ground and propelled herself under the fallen tree, surfing atop the leaf litter to the other side before the projectile shattered against a low-hanging branch, enveloping the forest in flames. Even as fiery splinters rained around her, her nanites snagged the debris, rapidly breaking it down and using it to build more tiny machines to replace the ones she’d lost in the explosion. The flames had devastated the nanites around Obozaya, but their improvised shield was enough; though groaning in pain, her friend was clearly alive.</p> 
                <p>The plasmalisk’s roar drowned out Obozaya’s groans as the beast trampled toward the ijtikri. Nanites whirled to life in a blinding fog, obscuring Veerkea’s form as the beast bit at her in vain. With each attack, the ijtikri sidestepped, her body partly discorporating into nanomachines with each defensive leap that carried her several body lengths out of harm’s way. As she reformed each time, she made a desperate attempt to defuse hostilities. “Excuse me! Please pardon my friend’s aggression, she—! Perhaps we could—oh no!” At last, the plasmalisk cornered her, cutting off her escape with its broad tail. But rather than bite her, it stared, its eyes glowing with radioactive intensity.</p> 
                <p>Veerkea’s body exploded in pain as she began blazing with the same heat raging in those eyes, her very cells boiling from the gaze’s energy. As the plasmalisk watched the ijtikri hungrily, the nanite cloud stirred. Millions of the airborne machines seeped back into their host’s body, diagnosing the ijtikri’s distress and isolating the misbehaving tissues to limit their damage. Aided by her myriad medics, Veerkea averted her eyes and suppressed the inner flames before they consumed her. The plasmalisk seemed far less impressed. Seeing that its prey hadn’t succumbed to its gaze, it closed in to finish her off with fangs alone.</p> 
                <p>A projectile slammed into the beast’s eye, deflecting its jaws as they narrowly missed the ijtikri. As Veerkea scrambled to safety, she nearly tripped over the deactivated plasma doshko that Obozaya had just thrown like a javelin. “Hey!” shouted the bristling vesk from atop one of the rocky outcroppings. “No plasma? No problem!” As if to punctuate her challenge, Obozaya splayed her claws threateningly and growled. Intrigued by this new prey, the beast obliged, hissing angrily as it lumbered toward and collided with the vesk. The two slashed and bit each other, but with twice the size and twice the claws, the plasmalisk quickly gained the advantage. </p> 
                <p>“Something cold, please!” Veerkea called out to her nanites as she leapt atop another outcropping. She tossed a battery into the air as she pivoted toward the melee, and her myriad machines complied, neatly enveloping the battery and assembling themselves into an energy rifle that landed in her hands. “Nicely done, friends,” the ijtikri chimed as she felt the rifle chilling the air even before it had been fired. She trained it on the plasmalisk, which had pinned Obozaya’s head in place, forcing the vesk to stare into its burning eyes.</p> 
                <p>Even as Obozaya roared in pain, Veerkea fired. Bolts of bright energy impacted the giant lizard’s haunches, instantaneously draining the target’s body heat and riming the targets with scale-shattering ice. A reflexive shiver forced the plasmalisk to drop Obozaya, and another two shots from Veerkea dimmed the glowing heat deep within the beast’s body. Panicked, the plasmalisk stumbled away, crashing through the foliage to escape the painful onslaught.</p> 
                <p>But Obozaya’s wounded roar drowned out the beast’s. Veerkea rushed over the where her friend knelt on the ground, pink mist steaming from her body as Obozaya desperately tore off pieces of armor to escape the heat building internally. The ijtikri tackled the vesk, bracing her head and pinning her flailing claws against the moss while channeling nanites into Obozaya’s body to arrest the ionizing affliction. For agonizing moments, the vesk reflexively fought both the fires and the ijtikri, but gradually her thrashing slowed as her natural fortitude prevailed. Obozaya coughed smoke as she came to her senses, blinking in confusion at the ijtikri pinning her before shrugging and drinking a healing serum. “So, ah… did we win?”</p> 
                <p>Flustered, Veerkea clambered off the vesk and searched the area. “We did, yes, we won. Ah…” As the adrenaline subsided, she began piecing together the puzzle. “The plasmalisk seemed to be basking, but it was clearly drinking in strong energy sources. If this the starship and power core we’re looking for, maybe the creature was drawing energy not from above, but from below?”</p> 
                <p>“Like a heated rock?” Obozaya had regained her feet, picked up her dented doshko, and staggered over. </p> 
                <p>“Exactly,” confirmed Veerkea as she continued her examination. “To a plasmalisk, this probably seemed like an oasis, perfect for warming up or… oh…” Confused by the ijtikri’s sudden silence, Obozaya came over to investigate. The beast hadn’t just been basking atop the buried starship’s hatch; it had been incubating. Several shells littered the concave hatch, atop which hissed a foot-long plasmalisk, puffing its body in a feeble threat display.</p> 
                <p>Spreading her arms to loom over the infant, Obozaya silenced the creature through her presence alone. She grunted dismissively. “Runt of the litter, last to hatch. Well, hope its instincts are good. C’mon, run off to wherever your siblings scampered.” She nudged it with the butt of her doshko to clear the way to the hatch.</p> 
                <p>Veerkea pulled the doshko to one side. “That’s not how this works, Obo,” she chided. “You picked this fight. Needlessly. If you’re so ready to take a life, you need to be ready to save a life.” The vesk let her head loll to one side in exasperation, like a toddler suffering a lecture. “And it’s not a runt. They were,” observed the ijtikri, pointing to the other shells.</p> 
                <p>“Wait.” Obozaya’s attention had snapped back to the nest. "So the clutchmates hatch and fight, with the victor eating its siblings?"</p> 
                <p>Veerkea bobbed sadly. "I know, nature can be cruel."</p> 
                <p>But Obozaya shook her head with newfound respect. "No, I'm hearing that this is a born, blooded warrior.” She scooped up the eight-legged lizard that wriggled in protest. “My scalesense doesn’t lie. This is a survivor! A worthy companion! A—ow!" Instinctively wary of large predators and displeased with being handled, the baby plasmalisk latched onto Obozaya's finger with its needle-like teeth.</p> 
                <p>"Hylax rejoices, Obo," laughed Veerkea as she helped disentangle the creature's teeth and eight legs. "You just made first contact."</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Alright Tuku. Today you’re going to teach me about water spirits!” Ija turned toward her companion and gave a fierce grin.</p> 
                <p>“Water <em>elementals</em>, you mean?” Tuku replied. The pink dragon’s wings fluttered as he glided from one tree limb perch to another. “I see the stretch of shore we’re looking for. It’s just ahead. When we pass the tree line, they’ll see us.”</p> 
                <p>“Elementals, spirits; what’s the difference? They’re relatives of yours, right?” Ija asked. She knew they weren’t, but it was fun to tease Tuku a little.</p> 
                <p>“They most certainly are not. I am a dragon!” he bristled slightly, though not truly annoyed.</p> 
                <p>Ija’s eyes lit up. “I heard elementals can take any shape. They could be dogs, or bats, or <em>dragons</em>…” </p> 
                <p>“So you <em>did</em> read the books from the Magaambya before we headed out here?” Tuku asked, surprised at her studiousness.</p> 
                <p>“Well, I... definitely looked at the pictures,” she admitted, though, yes, she had read many of the words, too—eventually.</p> 
                <p>“Water elementals are embodiments of the essence of matter, from the Plane of Water. They’re basically pure water. I am pure dragon.” Ija threw her eidolon a sidelong glance, and he sighed, repeating the fact she never let him forget: “Though, yes, without you to give me a body, I’m just formless mental essence from the Astral Plane. Thank you for giving me this <em>glorious manifestation</em>.”</p> 
                <p>Ija snorted and rolled her eyes. “If they have no mind, does that mean we can outthink them? Like I always outthink <em>you</em>?” This was how they worked out their strategies, and ultimately how Tuku guided her to better use her power—teasing insults and playful banter.</p> 
                <p>Tuku continued. “Oh, these aren’t just mindless puddles. These things are powerful in the water and they know it. They’ll try to drag us underwater.” He wasn’t kidding now, and Ija took the warning with the seriousness it deserved.</p> 
                <p>“But they’re causing trouble for the fishers, so they’re coming out of the water for that,” Ija mused, “So let’s bait them into attacking us on land, too. I can’t swim after them if they retreat back to the water, but you can, and—I know! D’you want <em>gills</em>?” The eidolon matched her hopeful grin with as straight and nonplussed an expression as his draconic face could muster. “Don’t worry! If they catch you in a trap, I’ll call you back, or let the bond snap if I have to. But c’mon, let’s see how well you can breathe underwater!”</p> 
                <p>Ija held the rune medallion she wore around her neck in one hand and held the other out in Tuku’s direction. The medallion, the matching rune on Ija’s headband, and the one emblazoned on her eidolon’s forehead all pulsed as their magical connection surged. Tuku felt an itch on both sides of his neck, just below his ears, and knew that he’d grown gills—at least temporarily. It wasn’t the plan he’d have suggested, but what was the harm?</p> 
                <p>“Is that it? Gills? Anything else we should be prepared for, or am I just going to <em>swim</em> the water to death?”</p> 
                <p>“Oh, I’m not done yet!” Ija’s excitement was palpable. She often had trouble focusing, but when she found something that captured her attention, her enthusiasm was contagious. “So! Water conducts electricity, right? I mean, yeah, it’s not actually the <em>water</em>, but the salts and stuff <em>in</em> the water. So as long as these aren’t made of pure water and are made of <em>ocean</em> water, then I should have just the thing.”</p> 
                <p>Before Tuku could respond, Ija dashed toward the edge of the trees, leaving her dragon companion nodding approvingly to himself.</p> 
                <p>“Hold on, short-stuff! Not so eager, or you might tip them off that something’s happening. Let’s either sneak up, or if we’re going to use your plan and bait them out, then pretend you don’t know they’re there,” Tuku suggested.</p> 
                <p>“So... I’m not sure we can convince them we’re just normal fishers they can terrorize. Do you think they’re going to be, I don’t know, <em>put off</em> by the whole you-being-a-dragon thing?”</p> 
                <p>“I’ll have you know that dragons are excellent at fishing. But you do have a point. Call me to your side when the time comes?” Tuku wondered aloud.</p> 
                <p>“Too slow. You sneak, I bait,” Ija decided, “There’s not a lot of cover, so try to use the seaweed. And your new gills!”</p> 
                <p>Tuku nodded his assent and disappeared into the water, though Ija knew exactly where he had gone. She wandered along the shore toward a rocky outcropping where the fishers had reported the most recent elemental attacks, seemingly lost in thought. It wasn’t hard to appear distracted, after all, because she <em>did</em> have an awful lot of things on her mind right then, but mostly she was thinking about shocking some water elementals. </p> 
                <p>She avoided glancing toward the water so as not to give herself away, but instead connected her senses to Tuku’s, so every so often she could peer through his eyes. That’s how she noticed the elementals slowly rising from the water to ambush her. Five huge, indistinct humanoid forms, almost the same color as the water itself. Two coming in close, one circling around, and another backing them up. The last one lurked in the distance to her left.</p> 
                <p>She turned her body away from them to further the deception, all the while glaring at them from Tuku’s position nearly completely submerged among the thick kelp nearby. </p> 
                <p>She waited... waited... That one on the left was still too far. Waiting... OK—now! </p> 
                <p>Ija’s senses rushed back into her own body, and she spun on her heel, already starting to cast her spell. Only from this perspective could she see that she’d misjudged their distance from Tuku’s vantage point; she had let them get too close! Ija might have fooled them, but it the nearest elemental was still close enough to slam its watery fist in her direction as she dropped her guard. Her concentration faltered—</p> 
                <p>“Look out!” While she’d been focusing on her own part in the ambush, Tuku was singularly occupied with keeping her safe. Realizing the threat, the dragon rose from the water and bolted toward her. Arriving just in time, Tuku spread his wings to shield his summoner, taking the brunt of the force as the warm, brackish water of the elemental’s slam fell clear of Ija.</p> 
                <p>Grinning mischievously and winking at her protector, Ija spread her hands, and unleashed a chain of lightning toward her attackers. Forks of electricity arced from figure to figure, jolting the elementals and causing their forms to lose cohesion. Wherever the lightning touched, water leaked from their bodies like the contents of a bucket seeping from uncaulked seams. Either the water <em>had</em> picked up sediments, or everything she and Tuku had been thinking had been wrong; maybe both. It didn’t matter either way.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>One of the elementals created a vortex of water just onto the shore. The moving eddy surged forward and back like a rushing tide, threatening to batter Ija and Tuku onto the rocks and deliver them into the depths. Ija tried to dodge, but her foot slipped on the wet sand. The incoming vortex was unavoidable.</p> 
                <p>But again, Tuku was vigilant; the dragon eidolon had been in a perfect position to notice and dodge the vortex. This time it was he who called upon their protective bond, swooping in to grab Ija, fluttering slightly off the ground for an instant, and setting her back down when the danger had passed.</p> 
                <p>This unlikely maneuver gave Ija room to dodge more oncoming blows from the nearest elementals. She backed up to a safer distance as Tuku went into a draconic frenzy, tearing apart the elemental that took the brunt of her lightning spell. The elementals responded in kind, surrounding the dragon and pummeling him with waves. Due to their bond, Ija felt every impact like a hit to her own body, but she knew they could last a little while longer. </p> 
                <p>“Ija, again!” Tuku shouted over the sound of crashing waves.</p> 
                <p>Ija called the lightning once more, and the sharp scent of ozone manifested as the magic sprang from her hands and arced into the elementals’ bodies. One of the remaining elementals was slain outright, or perhaps banished back to the Plane of Water—she honestly wasn’t sure what happened to these things when you destroyed them. Tuku noticed another that was leaking its essence from several places, and he used his jaws and claws to tear the holes wider, ripping the towering figure apart until it too collapsed into a splash of mundane water. Ija didn’t see any shining or shimmering like when a summoning spell ended; probably dead then. </p>
                <p>The remaining two elementals began to flee in terror, finally realizing how dangerous Ija and Tuku were as a team. The dragon snapped at the nearest of them and looked back toward Ija, awaiting her approval. She quickly raised one eyebrow, as if to say, “go on,” and as quickly as that, Tuku was off beneath the waves. </p> 
                <p>A few minutes later, the dragon emerged from the water with a wide, goofy smile filling his toothy muzzle. “I told you dragons were good fishers,” Tuku said. Ija squeezed her hair to rid it of at least some of the water that now weighed heavily on her head. Her eyes widened, expectantly. </p> 
                <p>“And yeah,” Tuku continued begrudgingly, “I guess the gills didn’t hurt.”</p>

                <p>This playtest is your chance to get a look at an early version of this new class and have a hand in its development before it hits shelves in an upcoming book!</p> 
                <h3>Playtesting the Evolutionist</h3> 
                <p>The evolutionist playtest launches today, <b>August 2</b>, and runs through <b>September 24</b>. So how can you help playtest this new class? First, you’ll want to download the free PDF of the playtest from <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">starfinderplaytest.com</a>. Then you can create a brand new evolutionist of any level using the new rules. We're most interested in feedback from actual play, so it's best if you can get some friends together and play a few sessions using your new character. If possible, make up characters at different levels to get a sense of how they work at different points in their career. </p> 
                <p>There's no accompanying playtest adventure—you can use the new class in existing adventures like Starfinder Society scenarios or Starfinder Adventure Paths, or even in mock combats that you create yourself using the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>’s encounter-creation rules. It might be helpful to take some notes during play, so you can remember your thoughts on the experience after the game session. To gather the most useful data for this playtest, we ask that you avoid using house rules and play these characters using only published rules from the Starfinder RPG.</p> 
                <h3>Playtesting in the Starfinder Society</h3> 
                <p>Players participating in <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety">Starfinder Society Organized Play</a> can also join in the worldwide playtest to test the evolutionist class. From today until the playtest's completion, players can create custom evolutionist characters of levels 1, 4 and 8. For more information, click <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Playtest-Rules">here</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Survey</h3> 
                <p>Our primary means of collecting feedback for the playtest is through a survey that we would like everyone participating in the playtest to complete. A link to the survey is available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">playtest page</a>. Please make sure you've filled out your survey by <b>September 24, 2021</b>.</p> 
                <p>In addition to responding via the official survey, you can engage with other players and designers on the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/playtest/evolutionistClass">playtest forum</a> to discuss the evolutionist and possibilities for the future. While we want to focus on actual-play feedback, we're interested in hearing all your ideas about the class.</p> 
                <p>What are your thoughts about the playtest? Are you excited? Do you have any questions about the playtest process? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
