  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 13, 2010</p> \n   <p>Last week, with\
  \ the first installment of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/golarionThursdays\">Golarion\
  \ Day</a>, I put out a call for everyone to start sending in ideas for future blog\
  \ posts. Those requests are pouring in, but it's gonna take a few weeks for us to\
  \ sort through them and match requests to the right content and all that. But keep\
  \ the suggestions coming!</p> \n   <p>This week, though, I thought I'd show off\
  \ a bit of my office Sandpoint campaign. This game's one of the largest I've ever\
  \ run—the initial goal was to have it be a game that the entire editorial pit could\
  \ take part in as a team-building exercise. But as we've hired more folks, and as\
  \ friends of current players have joined, the size of the group has exploded into\
  \ an intimidating group of nine players. The campaign itself is called <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/tags/shadowUnderSandpoint\">The Shadow Under Sandpoint</a>. You can\
  \ check out the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/community/gaming/campaignJournals/theShadowUnderSandpoint\"\
  >campaign journal</a> over on our boards—it's generally only a few game sessions\
  \ behind where we're at.</p> \n   <div align=\"right\">\n    <table align=\"right\"\
  \ border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" hspace=\"9\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n     <tbody>\n\
  \      <tr>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/PZO9002-Crows.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/PZO9002-Crows_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td align=\"center\" class=\"\
  tiny\">Illustration by John Gravato</td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>One of the tricky things about such a large group, of course,\
  \ is designing encounters that challenge the group. You can't just boost the CR\
  \ of the bad guys and make them individually tougher, because that'll only mean\
  \ that the bad guy will have a much better chance to kill a few PCs before he's\
  \ defeated—you don't want to kill PCs in every fight, since that's a downward spiral.\
  \ Instead, I've found that having one particularly tough boss monster surrounded\
  \ by lots of less powerful minions works really well—gives everyone in the party\
  \ someone to face off against, but also lets me have big key encounters with major\
  \ bad guys.</p> \n   <p>Such was the case several months ago, when I knew the PCs\
  \ were going up against the ghost of an infamous local murderer named Jervis Stoot.\
  \ Old Stoot (known as Chopper back during the height of his murdering days) is part\
  \ of Sandpoint's history, and those who've played in \"Rise of the Runelords\" have\
  \ probably heard his name. He was never a villain in that Adventure Path, though,\
  \ so that made him a perfect source for a logical foe for the PCs to face in this\
  \ campaign.</p> \n   <p>So when I designed Stoot, I made him a ghost that would\
  \ provide a challenge to the party (they were all about 4th or 5th level at the\
  \ time), but who also had some built-in options to call upon allies. Giving him\
  \ a new ghost ability that allows him to summon birds and command avians made sense\
  \ (he was a Pazuzu cultist back in the day, after all!). The fight ended up playing\
  \ out over two sessions—one atop the old light while Stoot had possessed the town\
  \ sheriff, and then a second after they defeated the possessed sheriff and chased\
  \ the ghost back to his island den to finish him off. In both cases, I threw in\
  \ some bird swarms to help amp up the terror and mayhem, resulting in what normally\
  \ would have been a CR 8 encounter, but when you have nine players, that's what\
  \ you gotta do!</p> \n   <p>(And don't tell my players, but they've not seen the\
  \ last of old Stoot's ghost yet! That's why I'm not listing the way in which you\
  \ can permanently put Stoot to rest, after all...)</p> \n   <p>In any event, if\
  \ any of you are playing a game set in Sandpoint, or if you're looking for a cool,\
  \ flavorful ghost to use, I thought for today that I'd throw Stoot's stat block\
  \ in for folks to check out. You'll note I did something a little weird with this\
  \ ghost—he should normally only have two special ghost abilities, but I gave him\
  \ three—corrupting touch, avian mastery, and malevolence. In order to balance things,\
  \ I also gave him an additional weakness and nerfed his malevolence ability. In\
  \ other words, feel free when you're making villains up for your home game to fiddle\
  \ with the rules!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>JERVAS STOOT CR 6</b><br> <b>XP\
