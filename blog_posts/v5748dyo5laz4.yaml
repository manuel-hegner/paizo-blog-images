  >Tuesday, May 11, 2010</p> \n   <p>Working at Paizo is awesome—there can be no question\
  \ about that. Most days—those days when I'm in my happy-hippie, all-is-right-with-the-world\
  \ mood—I show up to work and think, \"Wow, we're all so lucky to be editing RPGs\
  \ all day! How did we ever get so lucky?\" That's most days.</p> \n   <p>And some\
  \ days, we *&amp;#@ing earn it.</p> \n   <p>Last Saturday was one of those days.\
  \ Every year around this time, we start to reach the mission critical phase on our\
  \ Gen Con products, and it's all hands on deck trying to get them out the door in\
  \ time for the do-or-die ship date which will allow them to be at Gen Con. This\
  \ year is no exception, and while most of the big products (such as <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction/v5748btpy8dds\"\
  >Dave Gross's <i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>—more on that soon!) have already been\
  \ put to bed, the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i></a> is still in the last, messy phases of its birth. Thus it was that\
  \ Saturday found me, Rob McCreary, Judy Bauer, Sarah Robinson, Wes Schneider, James\
  \ Jacobs, and Erik Mona in here for more than 11 hours on Saturday to try and get\
  \ things handled. (It should be noted that Chris Carey was in his Fortress of Editorial\
  \ Solitude, having been saddled with the final proofing of <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy8b8p\"\
  ><i>Before They Were Giants</i></a>, and Sean was busy moving. I'm pretty sure Jason\
  \ was in a coma somewhere.)</p> \n   <p>Even with most of the Editorial Pit on hand,\
  \ weekend workdays still feel different than normal ones. Everything's a little\
  \ looser, and what professionalism we cultivate tends to get abandoned (though I\
  \ did not, as originally planned, wear my jammie pants).</p> \n   <p>All of this\
  \ is necessary to explain the photographs, I promise.</p> \n   <p>You see, when\
  \ we moved into our new office last September, it was immediately noted that the\
  \ otherwise normal-looking office building is bordered on two sides by a big field\
  \ of brambles (reportedly haunted by vagabonds and feral corgis) and a big grassy\
  \ ridge. At several points since the move, Wes and I have looked up at the ridge\
  \ and wondered what mysteries might lie, Narnia-like, just over its crest.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Around 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, having just finished editing chunks of the\
  \ classes chapter of the APG until my eyes were ready to bleed, I decided I needed\
  \ something stronger than caffeine to keep me going, and stormed into Wes's office.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Wes,\" I said, in my most inspiring voice, \"It is time. We're going\
  \ <i>over the mountain</i>.\"</p> \n   <p>Wes looked at me for a moment.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Yeah, okay,\" he said.</p> \n   <p>Thus it was that everyone save Erik\
  \ and Sarah (who had left for the evening) and Jacobs (who's too old and wise for\
  \ such things) trooped outside on our Voyage of Discovery. Leaping over the drainage\
  \ ditch, we scrabbled up the steep, grassy rise and came out into a magical wonderland!</p>\

  \ \n   <p>Well, okay, maybe it was a gravel pit. But the point was, we had gone\
  \ <i>over the mountain</i>! And for what it's worth, the gravel pit was pretty cool.\
  \ Wes and I spent a few minutes running up the mountain of rubble to get a view\
  \ of the surrounding countryside, then noticed the idling dump trucks and realized\
  \ it was an <i>active</i> gravel pit—one which might not appreciate a bunch of trespassing\
  \ nerds—and beat a hasty retreat to recommence editing.</p> \n   <p>And there you\
  \ have it—the wild excitement of a Saturday at the Paizo offices!</p> \n   <p class=\"\
