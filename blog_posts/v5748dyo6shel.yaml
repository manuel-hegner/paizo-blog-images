  \ Scenario designed for levels 1-4.<br> A retired Starfinder reaches out to the\
  \ Society in search of assistance when the local fauna of a moon in Near Space begins\
  \ to act erratically. The Society dispatches the PCs to investigate and contact\
  \ the retired Starfinder and their companions. Soon enough it becomes clear that\
  \ something insidious is at work nearby, and it's up to the PCs to step in and stop\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p>Content in Frozen Ambitions is an ongoing series of adventures\
  \ set in the Year of Exploration's Edge. These lower-level adventures are the perfect\
  \ starting point for any new Starfinder character, and can be integrated into almost\
  \ any ongoing campaign with little extra effort. While it is encouraged to begin\
  \ with this adventure, the adventures in the Frozen Ambitions series can be played\
