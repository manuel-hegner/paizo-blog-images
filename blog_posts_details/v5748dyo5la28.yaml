  artist: "thinking minds, and not the oft-random tragedies wrought by Nature. All\
    \ is not lost, however, when the Cyclone appears in your reading. At times, when\
    \ it appears in specific places of the spread, this card of chaos and evil actually\
    \ signifies renewal and rebirth after a blustery, trying ordeal. You must still\
    \ endure suffering and tragedy, for the Cyclone never portends good tidings, but\
    \ you shall survive the challenge put before you. What other dark omens await\
    \ you in the Harrow deck? Only time will tell... Mike McArtor GameMastery Editor"
