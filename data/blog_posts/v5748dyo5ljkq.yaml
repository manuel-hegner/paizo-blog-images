  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\" style=\"width:\
  \ 250px;\">\n      <a href=\"/paizocon\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/PaizoCon2017.jpg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Writing this blog made me\
  \ reflect upon last year and trying to plan a convention I hadn't had the fortune\
  \ to attend. Fortunately, I had two leads, Bob Jonquet and Todd Morgan, who knew\
  \ the ropes and helped me out. Alas, this year Bob is not part of the team. But\
  \ in this case, despair is fleeting, as we recruited Walter Sheppard to be co-lead\
  \ with Todd. Walter brings enthusiasm, energy, and new eyes to <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon 2017</a>. And since this is the 10th PaizoCon, the pressue is on to make\
  \ it bigger and shinier than ever. We've got industry superstars, we've got leadership,\
  \ and now we need you, the volunteers, to help make the event a success!</p> \n\
  \     <p>While there's more events and exciting <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>\
  \ happenings up our sleeves, I'll leave that to Sara Marie to announce as we get\
  \ closer to the show. For now, I'll give you a hint of what's in store for Pathfinder\
  \ Society events run out of the HUGE ballroom on the main floor, full of gaming\
  \ goodness.</p> \n     <p>The <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Roleplaying Guild</a>\
  \ tables will be offering the later portion of Season 8 <a href=\"/pathfinder/pfsScenarios/season8\"\
  >Year of the Stolen Storm</a> scenarios, starting with <a href=\"/products/btpy9oij?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-806-Reaping-What-We-Sow\"\
  ><em>#8-06: Reaping What You Sow</em></a> (and maybe we can even tempt Linda into\
  \ offering a table or two of this adventure she wrote). When scheduling games, we\
  \ try to balance the focus on the season's metaplot while also offering a variety\
  \ of games for our players. Sunday evening, we'll be debuting a new special: <em>#8-99:\
  \ The Solstice Star</em>. This news is <i>so</i> new, that there isn't even a product\
  \ page ready for it yet!</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</a> returns with <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season3\">Season of Plundered\
  \ Tombs</a>. We will start at the beginning and offer all published scenarios, which\
  \ should take you most of the way through the series. We will also offer back seasons,\
  \ such as <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season2\">Season of the Runelords</a>, available\
  \ on demand. We still have a few weeks to finalize the schedule, so expect to hear\
  \ more about ACG offerings.</p> \n     <p>One big change this year is the handling\
  \ of games in the midday slot. In the past, this slot was unofficially overseen\
  \ by Venture-Captain Louis Manko Levite (yep, he got promoted!). Unfortunately,\
  \ this caused some logistical issues as well as confusion for attendees, and this\
  \ year we will be closing the ballroom during this slot. Instead of unofficial games\
  \ and paper-based signups at the show, if a GM wants to run a game in this slot,\
  \ they will need to submit the information to our open call for events. Submitted\
  \ events will be put up as part of our overall event schedule so that PaizoCon attendees\
  \ may sign up as they would any other during event registration. Keep an eye out\
  \ on the blog, as Sara Marie will be putting the call out for event submission soon!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Additionally, we will not be scheduling separate Core Roleplaying Guild\
  \ tables. If you wish to play a Core session, find a table of like-minded friends\
  \ and sign up during event registration. When you sit down to play, let your GM\
  \ know that you wish the play a Core game.</p> \n     <p>We estimate needing over\
  \ fifty GMs and Card Guild volunteers to ensure Pathfinder Society at PaizoCon runs\
  \ smoothly. We also have a very limited number of HQ slots available. Due to the\
  \ limited number of places, space fills up quickly, so I recommend signing up as\
  \ soon as you know you can commit to the event.</p> \n     <p>Volunteer slots are\
  \ scheduled as follows:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"callout-block\"\
