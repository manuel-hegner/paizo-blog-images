  \    </div> \n    <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: One More Look at the Bad Guys</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, January 6, 2012</p> \n    <p>January 11th is the\
  \ official release date for Pathfinder Battles: <a href=\"/-btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a>, our first big set of prepainted miniatures produced in cooperation\
  \ with WizKids! That means we have only two more chances to show off the final sculpts\
  \ of minis we've previously revealed only as digital renders or pre-production samples.\
  \ A few commenters on last week's preview blog also suggested some size comparison\
  \ shots, which we've thrown together below.</p> \n    <p>Two weeks from today, we'll\
  \ begin to reveal some of the amazing miniatures in store for our next set, Rise\
  \ of the Runelords. We now have photos of paint masters for about half of that set,\
  \ so you can expect to see some amazing, full-color images pretty much immediately.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But that's the future, and the first set isn't even out yet. It deserves\
  \ just a little bit more time in the sun.</p> \n    <p>Once again, these are photos\
  \ of actual miniatures from the <a href=\"/-btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>\
  \ set. Enjoy!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Zombie_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Zombie_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>Up first we have the Zombie, a common menace that can't wait to\
  \ sink its teeth into your player characters. As I chronicled several preview blogs\
  \ ago, this guy started out with a kind of goofy \"dancing\" pose, but his revised\
  \ look is more of an undead lunge, and I'm really pleased with how he turned out.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Werewolf_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Werewolf_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>This rare Werewolf retains very little of his original clothing,\
  \ and almost none of his humanity. The black paint scheme perfectly matches the\
  \ common Wolf in this same set, giving you both bestial forms of a lycanthropic\
  \ menace.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Spectre_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Spectre_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>This haunting fellow, the rare Spectre, is enormously spooky.\
  \ The detailed sculpt of his wispy bottom half looks really great in-hand, as many\
  \ of you will no doubt discover only a few days from now.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Snake_360.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Snake_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Here we have the uncommon Venomous Snake, looking like it's slithered\
  \ directly off the page of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  >Pathfinder Bestiary</a>. Ssssssweet!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \   <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Medusa_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Medusa_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of snakes, who better to accompany\
  \ the Venomous Snake than the rare Medusa, one of the best sculpts in the set? WizKids\
  \ did a great job capturing the likeness of this iconic creature, and I'm willing\
  \ to bet she becomes one of the break-out favorites of the set.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Ettin_360.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-Ettin_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>And here's my absolute favorite of the bunch, the rare Ettin. I don't\
  \ think there's ever been a better prepainted mini of this two-headed giant, who\
  \ absolutely towers over the other figures in this set. </p> \n    <p>Don't believe\
  \ me? Check this out:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-MedusaEttin_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-MedusaEttin_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>See what I mean? This guy is huuuuuge. Ok, he's actually Large,\
  \ in game terms, but he really pushes the envelope, and is sure to elicit gasps\
  \ from your players when you plunk him on the table!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/010512-DragonMedusa_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/010512-DragonMedusa_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, the special promotional Huge Black Dragon (who actually is\
  \ Huge) is the real masterpiece of the set. Here he is standing next to the Medusa,\
  \ who really ought to start fast-talking soon. Acid breath cuts right through stone,\
  \ so I imagine it does a good number of filmy white cloth and slightly scaly skin...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That's it! The final look at the monsters of <a href=\"/-btpy8mq6\">Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</a>. Next week, we'll take one more look at the heroes, and after\
  \ that, we're off to Varisia to take a very early peek at the Rise of the Runelords!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Only five days until the official release of <a href=\"/-btpy8mq6\">Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</a>! Order your copies today before they are gone forever (something\
  \ I suspect will be happening sooner rather than later)!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
