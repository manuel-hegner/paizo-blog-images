  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">My very first PaizoCon, and\
  \ the only one I've been at as an attendee and not an employee, was in 2009. It\
  \ was an amazing experience to be surrounded by so many gamers and gaming professionals\
  \ excited to share their knowledge and sit down and game as a community. One particular\
  \ highlight came on the last day as things were winding down. Employees and fans\
  \ started informally gathering in the lobby area of the hotel and it provided a\
  \ unique experience getting to ask questions and listen to expertise from not only\
  \ the game designers and developers, but operational staff as well. I had a unique\
  \ experience getting to learn about some of the aspects of what keeps the amazing\
  \ RPG books I loved in print and shipping out. When a customer service position\
  \ opened at Paizo a few months later, I had no hesitation to apply since this casual\
  \ networking had let me know that the people I was hoping to work with were fantastic,\
  \ friendly people. As the convention has grown and moved hotels around, sometimes\
  \ without a good central lobby space, that kind of connecting atmosphere has been\
  \ harder to figure out how to facilitate.</p> \n    <p>A few years ago we moved\
  \ to Memorial Day weekend, turning PaizoCon into a 4 day convention. Monday's have\
  \ always been a bit difficult day to predict for scheduling as many folks use this\
  \ day as a travel day and are worrying about checking out of the hotel, thus making\
  \ attendance for Monday events much lower than those same events would traditionally\
  \ pull on one of the other days. Thinking about both of these puzzles together,\
  \ we've decided to try a bit of an experiment with PaizoCon Monday's schedule.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There will be the traditional 50 tables of organized play Monday morning\
  \ and Delves-two Playtest and one Starfinder. But this year we're only putting one\
  \ panel on the schedule, a Playtest feedback seminar where attendees can talk with\
  \ the designers about how their Playtest experiences at PaizoCon went, and we have\
  \ no scheduled individual games. Instead, from 10am to 1pm we have over 30 Paizo\
  \ employees from all departments who will be up in the Evergreen Rooms ready to\
  \ play our favorite casual board &amp; card games. I'll be there with one of my\
  \ favorites, Settlers of Catan and I've heard from other folks that games like Dice\
  \ Forge, One Deck Dungeon, Sentinels of the Multi-Verse, Undercity/Widower's Wood,\
  \ Island of Dreams, Munchkin Nightmare Before Christmas, Munchkin Rick and Morty,\
  \ and variations of Fluxx might all make appearances. If you have young kids I'll\
  \ also be bringing copies of Dinosaur Escape and Spookies. There will also be two\
  \ employees in Olympic 1 who will be hooking up video games to play on the the seminar\
  \ projector and bringing a Switch to battle in Mario Kart. For those who are still\
  \ hoping to play pick up games with other attendees, all of the Cascade rooms will\
  \ be open for use.</p> \n    <p>My hope is that the more casual aspect of gaming\
  \ will help facilitate both PaizoCon attendees and employees getting an opportunity\
  \ to interact and have fun together in a semi structured environment. As this is\
  \ an experiment this year, if you have any feedback, please let us know at <a href=\"\
  mailto:paizocon@paizo.com\">paizocon@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n    <p>See you next week!</p>\
