  description\">As we approach the end of the year, it's tradition to look back on\
  \ the year that was. There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized\
  \ Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on. In some ways we have made\
  \ progress from where we were last year: physical games are slowly starting up in\
  \ some areas, we've got piles of new content for our players, and we've produced\
  \ another full year of scenarios. By the same token, there are still many areas\
  \ that haven't changed: conventions are mostly still online, and we're not sure\
  \ what the future of large-scale shows will look like.</p> \n     <p>One certainty\
  \ for me in all of this is the community. No matter what, you're all out there playing\
  \ games, having a good time and enjoying our stories, I've got the table data to\
  \ prove it. It's exciting to know that the work we're doing is bringing some joy\
  \ to your lives. I hope that this holiday season (for those of you who celebrate),\
  \ you're able to get together with your biological and chosen families, as appropriate,\
  \ and throw some dice together. You never know, Grandma might get really into playing\
  \ Kyra from the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! If you're looking for some festive\
  \ cheer this season, definitely check out this month's new Starfinder Society release,\
  \ A <em>Festive Operation</em>; I think it'll be a staple of December schedules\
  \ for the next few years.</p> \n     <p>Does your gaming group have holiday traditions?\
  \ Are you giving your GMs something special for the season? Let me know in the comments\
  \ down below!</p> \n     <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> \n     <p>Here are\
  \ this month's digital releases, available December 15, 2021:</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder</h3>\
  \ \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</a>*<br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</a>*<br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories\"\
  >Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</a></p> \n     <h3>Starfinder</h3> \n   \
  \  <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-412-A-Festive-Operation\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</a>*</p> \n     <p><em>*part\
  \ of a subscription</em></p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n     <p>For those of\
  \ you who have not already noticed, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page contains sanctioning for both <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"><em>Guns &amp;\
  \ Gears</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>! These two books had a lot of tricky\
  \ elements, especially <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and we're thankful for your patience\
  \ while we sorted through them. I'd especially like to thank Linda Zayas-Palmer\
  \ and Mark Seifter for spending a <em>lot</em> of time with me in the week before\
  \ Thanksgiving working to get them out before the holiday, Pathfinders, go forth\
  \ and enjoy your new content!</p> \n     <p>For my fellow Starfinders, we've also\
  \ sanctioned the most recent standalone adventure, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xs?Starfinder-Adventure-The-Liberation-of-Locus1\"\
  ><em>The Liberation of Locus-1</em></a>, for credit, and its rules options are also\
  \ available on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a>. We hope you enjoy this new adventure!</p> \n     <p>Looking\
  \ forward, there are two Pathfinder rulebooks coming out in December: <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02aoy?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth\"><em>Lost\
  \ Omens: Monsters of Myth</em></a> and the long-awaited <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens\"\
  ><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>. We hope to have the sanctioning for both\
  \ of these ready for street date; they're a pretty light lift, so I'm very hopeful.\
  \ On the Adventures front, we're also starting to work through the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands\"\
  ><em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</em></a>, and hope to have more to share\
  \ on that soon.</p> \n     <h2>Nova Update</h2> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfs?Nova-Qualifications-Update\"\
  >Last year, we announced</a> that we’d be adding one high-level scenario per year\
  \ to the qualifying scenarios for Nova credit. We intended for this to be our end-of-year\
  \ scenario each year; however, in looking at the plan for this year, the final scenario\
  \ of the Data Scourge metaplot is (spoilers!) a 5-8, which is not quite high enough\
  \ level to qualify for our requirements. As a result, we are adding the Nova tag\
  \ to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm\"\
  ><b><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></b></a>. All\
  \ previous and future runs (up to three) of this scenario will count towards the\
  \ 10-scenario requirement for Nova qualification. Thanks to the VOs who pointed\
  \ out this potential snag to me!</p> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <p></p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n     <h4>Campaign Service Coins</h4> \n\
  \     <p>At SkålCon at the end of October, we awarded two new Campaign Service Coins.\
  \ These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer\
  \ duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always\
  \ accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with\
  \ their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to\
  \ physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know\
  \ what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> \n     <p>Congratulations\
  \ to:<br> <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play\
  \ ID #850<br> <b>Sean Pearson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play\
  \ ID #851</p> \n     <p>It also came to my attention that we never formally announced\
  \ the two recipients from last year’s SkålCon Online, so I would like to formally\
  \ recognize:<br> <b>James Anderson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized\
  \ Play ID #840<br> <b>Tineke Bolleman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized\
  \ Play ID #841</p> \n     <h4>GM Ranks</h4> \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs,\
  \ achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To\
  \ achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must\
  \ be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three\
  \ games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the\
  \ time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>This month,\
  \ we had two GMs earn their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition), and\
  \ one GM earned their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> \n     <p><b>5th Star</b>:\
  \ Idaho, Joshua Blazej<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Hilary Moon Murphy</p> \n     <p>Congratulations\
  \ to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have\
  \ achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com\
  \ .</p> \n     <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the holiday\
  \ season!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
