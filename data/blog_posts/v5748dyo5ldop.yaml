  \   </div> \n    <p>This past year has seen many additions to the Pathfinder brand,\
  \ including Pathfinder miniatures and the <i>Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</i>.\
  \ The Pathfinder Tales line has grown three times what it was a year ago. And, we\
  \ saw the conclusion of the tenth Adventure Path! There has been so much Pathfinder\
  \ goodness, it amazes me to look at my bookshelf and see it able to hold against\
  \ the strain of all the new, awesome products that have been added.</p> \n    <p>Next\
  \ year will see an even greater increase not only in our current product lines,\
  \ but expanding into other areas such as comic books and online games. The goblin\
  \ will be brought to life, so to speak, in the form of a plush toy. And, there are\
  \ other secrets I, and many other Paizo staff, would love to tell you about, but\
  \ you will have to attend our expanded seminars schedule at Gen Con to get the lowdown\
  \ on these.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">At Gen Con 2011, we had\
  \ 7–8 seminars that touched on future products, secrets of Golarion, and the like.\
  \ With this being Paizo's tenth anniversary as a company, and the 5-year anniversary\
  \ of the release of the first Adventure Path, there was simply no way for us to\
  \ fit everything we wanted to tell you and show you in those few seminars. So, after\
  \ much discussion, we decided to double the number of seminars offered at Gen Con\
  \ this year. The following is a listing of seminars, a short description of what\
  \ each will entail, and the guests that highlight each.</span></p> \n    <blockquote>\
