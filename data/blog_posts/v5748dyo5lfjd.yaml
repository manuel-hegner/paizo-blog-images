  \ Class Guide Playtest is Live!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 19,\
  \ 2013</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>Greetings, and welcome\
  \ to the Advanced Class Guide Playtest!</p> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Next summer we will be releasing the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</i>,\
  \ a meaty 256-page rulebook filled with new options for players of any class. In\
  \ addition, the book also contains 10 brand new classes! In the design pit, we call\
  \ these \"hybrid classes\" because each one takes elements from two existing base\
  \ classes and blends them together to create a novel play experience. To make sure\
  \ that these classes get rigorously testing and fit seamlessly into the Pathfinder\
  \ experience, we're turning to you, the fans, to playtest them.</span></p> \n  \
  \   <p>Starting today, <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/advancedClassGuide\">you can download\
  \ the Advanced Class Guide Playtest PDF right here at <b>paizo.com</b></a>. The\
  \ PDF contains all 10 of the new classes, ready to become a part of your game, either\
  \ as a player character or NPC. Give these classes a read, build a character or\
  \ two, and use them in your game. Once you've had a chance to try them out, hop\
  \ on to the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/advancedClassGuide\">playtest messageboards</a>\
  \ and let us know what you think. You'll find a bunch of other playtesters there,\
  \ also giving feedback on the classes. Hop into the discussion and add your thoughts.\
  \ The playtest will remain open until <b>December 17th, 2013</b>.</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ addition, there will be a survey for each of the classes, allowing us to gain\
  \ some basic information on your reactions to them. These will be available on Tuesday,\
  \ November 24th, and remain open until the end of the playtest. You can even change\
  \ your answers as the playtest progresses, but though on December 17th we'll close\
  \ those surveys. Please share your input before then!</p> \n     <p>Finally, I want\
  \ to take a moment to talk about the playtest process itself. Although we find all\
  \ feedback useful, thoughts and comments based on actual play experience is by far\
  \ the most valuable. Please try to fit these classes into your game, or even just\
  \ run a few mock encounters. When posting to the playtest forums, look for existing\
  \ threads on your topic before starting a new one—this will help us to better absorb\
  \ and respond to feedback. While discussions can become heated, remember that every\
  \ game is different and every poster is trying to make the game better for everyone.\
  \ Be polite and respectful of the ideas others' posts.</p> \n     <p>That wraps\
  \ it up for now. Expect blog posts with thoughts and updates each week throughout\
  \ the playtest. Thanks for participating—now grab that PDF and start reading!</p>\
