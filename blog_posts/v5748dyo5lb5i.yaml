  \ Preview Banquet Recap</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 22, 2010</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With PaizoCon 2010 officially in the books, it's time to start looking\
  \ forward to the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>,\
  \ which releases in early August at Gen Con. On Saturday night, during the banquet,\
  \ I gave a nice long preview of the book, and wanted to make sure that everyone\
  \ who was not able to attend also had a chance to hear about some of the exciting\
  \ new rules and features in this mighty tome.</p> \n    <p>First off, we took a\
  \ look at the races chapter, which includes a two-page spread of information on\
  \ each of the seven core races. Each one includes new alternate racial class features\
  \ for you to choose from and new favored class options. The latter gives you another\
  \ thing to choose from when you take a level in a class favored by your race. For\
  \ example, dwarven barbarians can choose to gain 1 additional round of rage per\
  \ day instead of an additional hit point or skill rank.</p> \n    <p>Next comes\
  \ the classes chapter, which starts off with the six new base classes and then continues\
  \ on with new rules and material for the 11 core classes from the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>. The base classes have received a host of updates since\
  \ the playtest, but still primarily function much in the same way as they did before.\
  \ For the core classes, we added scores of new rules. Most of the classes contain\
  \ numerous archetypes, or different takes on the class, which includes a number\
  \ of alternate abilities that you can take as a package. For example, rogues can\
  \ select the sniper archetype which grants them increased range with their sneak\
  \ attack and reduces their penalties for making attacks at long range.</p> \n  \

  \    </table>\n   </div>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Although this chapter has a little\
  \ something for everyone, one of the things I was most excited to reveal was the\
  \ antipaladin class. This alternate paladin is sure to keep your players up at night.\
  \ His smite good attack deals double damage to paladins and good-aligned clerics\
  \ on the first successful attack. His touch of corruption deals damage and can inflict\
  \ terrible cruelties on hapless PCs. He can be a carrier of disease and can radiate\
  \ an aura of sin. He is a tough, tough customer. But my favorite part of putting\
  \ together the entire book was writing his code of conduct. Here is an excerpt:</p>\n\
  \    <blockquote> <i>Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with\
  \ good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks.</i>\n\
  \    </blockquote>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>After classes is a meaty feats chapter,\
  \ containing 163 feats that range from metamagic feats, combat feats, and even a\
  \ host of racial feats. This chapter even includes a number of high-level feats\
  \ that duplicate a number of powers of the old 3.5 archmage prestige class. One\
  \ feat of note is Shadow Strike, which allows a character to deal precision damage,\
  \ even if the target has concealment, allowing rogues to finally be able to sneak\
  \ attack a foe in a dark alley.</p> \n    <p>After feats comes equipment, which\
  \ contains new tools, useable by nearly any PC, and a lengthy chapter full of spells.\
  \ There are spells in this book for every spellcasting character, including new\
  \ spell lists for elementalist wizards. All told, 57 pages of spells with new choices\
  \ at every level of play. After spells comes the prestige class chapter, which includes\
  \ 8 new classes. I previewed the Stalwart Defender during the banquet, which is\
  \ an update of the 3.5 Dwarven Defender. The name change stems from the fact that\
  \ you no longer need to be a dwarf to take levels in this class. The class also\
  \ grants many new abilities that the defender can choose from as he gains levels.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The book is rounded out with a large magic items chapter, including new\
  \ items from virtually every category. It starts with armor and weapons and wraps\
  \ up with cursed items and artifacts. That chapter is followed up with the new rules\
  \ chapter, which includes info on four new combat maneuvers (dirty trick, drag,\
  \ reposition, and steal), an optional hero point system, and the entire traits system\
  \ used by the Pathfinder Adventure Paths.</p> \n    <p>All of that, crammed into\
  \ 336 pages between two beautiful covers. A detailed preview of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"\
  ><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> will start very soon. Keep your eyes here on\
  \ the Paizo blog for more information on this exciting book.</p> \n    <p>Jason\
