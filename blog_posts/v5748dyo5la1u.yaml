  \ Blow A-Comin'!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 26, 2008</p> \n \
  \  <p>Now that we have copies of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7ymg\">Key Largo</a>\
  \ in stock, I thought I'd show you how to play the game. It's 1899, and ten days\
  \ till a mighty hurricane roars ashore (we had great weather-predicting machinery\
  \ in 1899). So, before that hurricane arrives, you want to get as much gold and\
  \ jewels as you can out of the many pirate shipwrecks sunk deep in the coastal waters.\
  \ You start with a little wooden boat, $100, and a diver. Your goal is to become\
  \ the richest salvager on the island in those ten short days.</p> \n   <p>You have\
  \ five cards which allow you to go to places around the isle. You play two of them\
  \ per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. You can: </p>\n   <ul> \n\
  \    <li>Go to the Tavern to hire more divers</li> \n    <li>Go to the Equipment\
  \ Shop to buy those divers hoses, tridents, and weights</li> \n    <li>Search a\
  \ wreck for treasure</li> \n    <li>Sell your treasures at the Market</li> \n  \
  \  <li>Take tourists dolphin watching at Dolphin Cove</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Those are all good choices, but <i>when</i> you do these actions is critical.\
  \ Everyone acts at once, and the number of people wanting to do each action can\
  \ alter the prices for those action. For example, if three people want to hire divers,\
  \ the divers know they can charge more. So you spend your time trying to guess what\
  \ everyone else is going to do and surprising them with what you're going to do.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Oh, and watch out for sea monsters! If you don't have a pointy trident\
  \ to fend off the monsters, your divers might become monster chow.</p> \n   <p>At\
  \ the end, as the hurricane is bearing down, you sell off everything you have left,\
  \ count your cash, and declare a winner as you ride the winds out of <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7ymg\">Key Largo</a>. And when you come back, that hurricane will\
  \ have made sure there are plenty more wrecks for you to search...</p> \n   <p>Mike\
