  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Now, mister, why\
  \ would you bother yourself with questions like those?” </p> \n     <p>Quinn put\
  \ down the brass cup he was drinking from and closed the open journal in front of\
  \ him. “It’s unfortunately my job, ma’am.” </p> \n     <p>“And it’s a terrible job\
  \ indeed, for such a handsome fellow,” the waitress mused. She tilted her pitcher\
  \ of wine over his cup, and while the man was sure he’d had enough, he didn’t protest.\
  \ “It’s such a gruesome thing for you to busy yourself with.” </p> \n     <p>“Someone’\
  s got to be so busy.” He smirked, reaching into his pocket for a handful of coins\
  \ and placing them in the waitress’s free hand. “Thank you for your assistance.”\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The woman blushed at his touch, bowing as she stepped away. Quinn\
  \ sipped from the now brimming cup of alcohol as he turned his attention back to\
  \ his notes, the ones he had taken in his mind carefully as she spoke. This would\
  \ be the eleventh body so far. He hadn’t seen it yet, but it was still fresh, and\
  \ nearby—in an alley beside the rented homes at the docks, barely minutes of walking\
  \ from the tavern he sat in. If the city’s own guards hadn’t moved it—and he was\
  \ confident they wouldn’t, not until daylight had burned away most of their fear—\
  then tonight was a good chance to get a look of his own. </p> \n     <p>The grim\
  \ crime occurred near Augustana’s thriving docks, and Quinn knew which alley the\
  \ victim lay in when the smell of rum and saltwater gave way to the overpowering\
  \ stench of death as he approached. He held a torch above his head as he stepped\
  \ into the dark toward the body. The corpse itself was as all the others, at least\
  \ at first blush. It was dressed in the robes of the Skinsaw Cult, laying spread-eagle\
  \ at the center of the scene. They had been exsanguinated, one clean deep cut to\
  \ the neck letting all of their precious lifeblood out into a receptacle that was\
  \ no longer at the scene, but left its round red ring of blood on the cobblestones\
  \ as evidence.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072120_Investigating.jpg\"\

  \     <p>The one difference between this scene and the others had been the first\
  \ thing that Quinn saw, but he wanted to save his assessment of it for last. On\
  \ the wall behind the body lay concentric painted circles of blood making a crude\
  \ clock, skeletal arms pointing at the twelve and thirteen numerals. It was peculiar\
  \ in ways that ultimately felt distracting. These cultists loved their gaudy death\
  \ imagery—the skulls and bones and blood and exquisitely mannequined carcasses—\
  all meant to elicit terror and leave those who witnessed their handiwork unable\
  \ to shake the thought of the gruesome scene. As a rule, however, there was always\
  \ something more meaningful beneath the theater, some misstep of a lazy mind, a\
  \ revelation to be uncovered by the quick-witted. </p> \n     <p>Quinn stared at\
  \ the macabre clock, waiting for it to reveal something deeper the its obvious message\
  \ of intimidation and horror. It went up to thirteen hours—that would have been\
  \ simple enough to dismiss as over-relying on superstition, but then why point at\
  \ twelve? There were also the bones themselves. The body did have its arms split\
  \ lengthwise, the skeleton severed at the joints for the bones to slip out as much\
  \ as possible without disturbing the muscle beyond them. The arms nailed to the\
  \ wall, however, did not belong to this victim. It took barely a moment of Quinn’\
  s forensic acumen to tell. For one thing, there was a short hand, as all clocks\
  \ were wont to have, but both limbs were still longer than the corpse’s. Each of\
  \ these arms, then, must be another victim’s injury. </p> \n     <p>He paused to\
  \ consider if that would be a useful hunch. That was where they pointed: to the\
  \ twelfth and thirteenth bodies, somewhere waiting to be found among the ports of\
  \ the Inner Sea. But why hint at them now? The murderer had so far never left any\
  \ clues to a further kill. Perhaps he had learned that he was being followed, and\
  \ the thrill had changed from the lust for blood to the game of not being caught.\
  \ Quinn winced. “Please, don’t be one of the clever ones,” he muttered. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Quinn knelt and turned over the opened arms of the corpse with the tip\
  \ of his cane, to check the rest of the man’s skin. The corpse’s nails were clean\
  \ and manicured, and there were the clear tan lines of a bracelet and a ring around\
  \ the wrist and fourth finger of the right hand. Nothing else about the person bore\
  \ the kind of dazed, hungry demeanor of a cultist of the Skinsaw Man. Quinn sized\
  \ up the man’s muscular build, sun-worn skin, and the pair of ornate anchor tattoos\
  \ on each bicep—one in the Taldan or Andoren style he would expect of a citizen\
  \ of Augustana, the other similar but with flourishes that appeared more Garundi,\
  \ possibly Rahadoumi. This man must have been a sailor. This expanded his investigation\
  \ quite a bit, and he sighed at the notion. </p> \n     <p>He endeavored to ask\
  \ his questions in the morning, then. Sailors tend to be their most volatile at\
  \ night.</p> \n     <p>At first light, Quinn awoke and took a moment to consider\
  \ what he knew so far about the victims. The Skinsaw Cult garb was a ruse—but whose?\
  \ Did a cultist find enough forethought to hide their latest body in their own robes?\
  \ It was doubtful compared to the alternative: someone attempted to infiltrate the\
  \ cult. It was highly unlikely that they were on the same path that he himself was.\
  \ Still, what the poor soul may have found might be relevant, he thought. He hoped\
  \ that the man may have shared some part of his plan with a crewmate. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>Yes, he knew that would mean forcing the answers out of a sailor, the bulk\
  \ of whom Quinn’s experience told him would be loyal to their oaths of secrecy,\
  \ even those sworn to the dead. It’d be hard going, but at least there would be\
  \ someone with answers. </p> \n     <p>Quinn spent the morning combing the Fleet\
  \ District, listening and watching for any indication of what ship last night’s\
  \ victim may have served on. If his theory were correct, if the victim truly was\
  \ tracking the cult across the northern coast of the Inner Sea, then it’d be a ship\
  \ recently arrived from Almas, after having put in at both Oppara and Cassomir,\
  \ though not in that order. That narrowed the possible number of vessels to four.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was early afternoon before he’d further winnowed the possibilities\
  \ to a single ship, Oasis, which employed a Taldan crew but called Azir, Rahadoum’\
  s so-called Port Godless, her home port. Oasis had arrived just two nights hence,\
  \ and its crew were holed up in one of the sailor’s flophouses not far from the\
  \ scene of the crime. When he found the home, Quinn lifted the head of his cane\
  \ and rapped on the door three times with rhythmic precision, with the force of\
  \ conviction but not malice. Just as he drew breath to call out his name and intention,\
  \ the door slowly creaked open, and the stern face of a blond man in his forties\
  \ glared at him. “What can I do for you, friend?”</p> \n     <p>“I may have a bit\
  \ more to offer,” Quinn replied, smiling. “But first, do you know a tan-skinned\
  \ man, around your height and build, maybe a bit younger, darker of hair, with twin\
  \ anchor tattoos on the arms, of a kind but likely done by different needles in\
  \ ports far from one another?”</p> \n     <p>“Er… I mean, I know lots of guys,”\
  \ the man started, his eyes darting quickly from Quinn’s face to the head of his\
  \ cane and back. “Why?” Quinn noticed that the man didn’t inhale at the end of the\
  \ inquiry, nervously, subconsciously holding his breath.</p> \n     <p>Surely you\
  \ heard tell of the murder last night, the ritual killing? I have reason to believe\
  \ someone who’d been bunking here with the other members of his crew was involved.”\
  \ Quinn drew his journal from a coat pocket now, making a show of checking it for\
  \ the ship’s name. “Yes, the victim was most assuredly a sailor on the Oasis—strange\
  \ name for a ship, no? You know it?”</p> \n     <p>“Victim?” the man said somberly,\
  \ releasing his held breath and letting the door swing open wide enough for Quinn\
  \ to enter. “Jassa, one of my mates…” His eyes opened wide, as if he were searching\
  \ the floor between them both for something to make sense of his sudden grief. “\
  I’m bosun of Oasis. I can’t imagine why Jassa’d be a target of a slaying that brutal.\
  \ If what I heard is true, course.” When he finally found himself, he put his hand\
  \ out to greet the detective. “Randall. Thank you for letting me know.” </p> \n\
  \     <p>Quinn shook the man’s hand firmly. There was the formality Quinn expected,\
  \ the apprehension against opening up to anyone—especially non-sailors—who seemed\
  \ to know more about a given situation. Experience told him that he just had to\
  \ push a few buttons first. “Why would a man serving on a ship out of Azir be involved\
  \ with religious zealots, cultists?”</p> \n     <p>“Cultists? You think one of those\
  \ flesh-peeling Skinsaws did that to him?” Randall’s eyes flared with rage, but\
  \ he caught himself suddenly. </p> \n     <p>There it was. Quinn had him now. “\
  He told you something.”</p> \n     <p>“Like what, sir?” </p> \n     <p>“You didn’\
  t even hesitate. Jumped straight from ‘cultist’ to ‘Skinsaws’. Your man Jassa was\
  \ looking into something, and he let you know what. So now you’re going to tell\
  \ me.” He walked past the man and toward the corner of the room that served as a\
  \ kitchen and continued. “So, how do you like your tea?” </p> \n     <p>“… tea?\
  \ What are you on about, man?” </p> \n     <p>Quinn peered into a kettle to ensure\
  \ its cleanliness and began filling it with water, then turned to Randall and smirked.\
  \ “When someone’s about to tell me a long story, I like to have something to drink.”\
