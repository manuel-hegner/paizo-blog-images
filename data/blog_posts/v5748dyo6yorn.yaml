  \ in the Impossible Playtest! We’ve received a ton of feedback and we’re ready to\
  \ dive back into the metaphorical pool that is the <strong>necromancer</strong>\
  \ and the <strong>runesmith</strong>. As always, your response to the playtest is\
  \ invaluable, and we’re ready to give a glimpse of what’s to come! First, I’ll talk\
  \ about the necromancer, and then James Case will talk about the runesmith.</p>\n\

  \      <p>We got a lot of great feedback from all of you about the new mechanics\
  \ this class implemented. This proved to be a very popular class fantasy, with playtest\
  \ necromancers even briefly beating out “human fighter” in Demiplane characters\
  \ made over the course of the playtest. Many of you found that thralls were a fresh,\
  \ fun take on battlefield control while also evoking the feeling of controlling\
  \ an undead army. However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Moving Thralls<br></strong> The largest amount of feedback we\
  \ got was requests for an easy way to move thralls. We’re conscious of the potential\
  \ for mass minion control to slow down gameplay and thus did not include many thrall\
  \ movement options. We’re exploring this further moving forward.</p>\n      <p><strong>Martial\
  \ Necromancers<br></strong> One of the options we wanted to gauge in this playtest\
  \ was player interest in martial options for the necromancer. From the responses,\
  \ we found that many people were interested in a more martial-leaning necromancer\
  \ but ultimately were disappointed with the current options. While we intend to\
  \ keep the necromancer firmly as a spellcaster rather than pushing it to “gish”\
  \ territory, we will be looking into ways to make the occasional scythe attack more\
  \ engaging.</p>\n      <p><strong>Spell List<br></strong> Choosing a spell list\
  \ for the necromancer was not an easy task, as many of the core elements of necromancy\
  \ were separated into many spell lists. We are ultimately happy with the choice\
  \ of the occult list. However, we’ll be implementing options to gain access to some\
  \ iconic necromancy-themed spells that are not normally available to occult casters\
  \ to ensure the necromancer feels like a true master of life and death magic.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Pets<br></strong> During the playtest, we primarily wanted to\
  \ test the thrall mechanics and thus left out options we already had plenty of play\
  \ data on, like familiars. We do plan on including some undead familiar options\
  \ in the final release of the necromancer</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Huerta (right).</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>The Runesmith</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Since this class uses a brand-new approach to magic, the playtest runesmith\
  \ was focused on testing a few different options to see which ones were most engaging\
  \ in play. Many people enjoyed the runesmith’s core fantasy and the tactics of setting\
  \ up a number of runes before activating them, but there were a few kinks to work\
  \ out with this system.</p>\n      <p><strong>Tracing &amp; Etching <br></strong>\
  \ In our team’s internal playtest of runesmith concepts, we realized pretty early\
  \ that we didn’t want the runesmith to exhaust all their decisions during daily\
  \ preparations, and that they’d need a way to dynamically make runes in combat as\
  \ well. Most respondents stated that they found the balance of “pre-combat” etched\
  \ runes and “in-combat” traced runes to be satisfying, so we’ll be fine-tuning rather\
  \ than reworking this distribution moving forward.</p>\n      <p><strong>Rune List\
  \ <br></strong> Since this was a playtest, we were focused on collecting data on\
  \ a smaller number of runes as test cases for various play styles (damage rune,\
  \ defense rune, movement rune, etc.) rather than creating an exhaustive list of\
  \ options. As always, we’ll have a wider list of runes in the final version of the\
  \ class. Though we don’t intend to do away with direct-damage runes like <em>atryl,\
  \ rune of fire</em> altogether, we do intend to rebalance <em>some</em> (<strong>some</strong>)\
  \ of the runes’ power away from direct-damage effects, having your runesmith increase\
  \ the team’s damage output through buffs and support instead.</p>\n      <p><strong>Diacritic\
  \ Runes &amp; Composite Invocations<br></strong> These presented two ways to combine\
  \ your runes to sum up to a unique effect. Both of these options were seen as very\
  \ interesting, with many people feeling like this gave you the ability to freely\
  \ script/sculpt your magic. However, they were noticeably complex, and many respondents\
  \ felt that it was too difficult to get satisfying combos off in play. We’ll be\
  \ looking at ways to keep the fantasy of personalizing or combining your runic effects\
  \ while keeping the benefit worth it to set up. We also expect a fuller list of\
  \ runes to give a greater number of ways to set up combo effects.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <p>There will be of course other tweaks, changes, and additions made as these\
  \ classes go through post-playtest revisions. I hope you’re all as excited as we\
  \ are for their eventual release in 2026!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
