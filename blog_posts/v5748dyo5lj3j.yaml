  >Six years ago</a>, Paizo welcomed prolific Pathfinder super-fan, <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a> and <em>Wayfinder</em> co-champion, and overall badass Liz Courts\
  \ to our offices. Today, Liz treks on to her next adventure—pursuing her creative\
  \ passions and leaving her trademark gninja style on whatever she sets her mind\
  \ to. We are so proud to have been able to work side-by-side with her, and are just\
  \ as excited to see what she does next. Because while in that blog post all that\
  \ time ago, she hoped that the \"awesomeness\" would rub off on her, her \"awesomness\"\
  \ has more than made it's mark on everyone in our office, our conventions, and the\
  \ community.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120719-2009.jpg\"\

  \    <tbody>\n       <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\"> <p>Liz is\
  \ one of the reasons that I'm here at Paizo. We had been friends online since the\
  \ magazine days and way back then I proposed the idea of making a chat room for\
  \ a group of fans to be able to chat off the messageboards, which we were on all\
  \ the time anyway. After making the post, Liz stepped up and built it. Back in the\
  \ early days of the chatroom she, along with a few other folks, first encouraged\
  \ me to get into freelancing. After I decided to do so, I booked a trip to GenCon\
  \ where I'd finally meet Liz and a couple other close friends in person for the\
  \ first time.</p> <p>Liz didn't just make a chatroom for Paizo fans and make the\
  \ messageboards a fun place, she also started <em>Wayfinder</em> with Hugo Solis.\
  \ I was happy to be around for that magazine's infancy and help out with editing\
  \ for the first half-dozen issues. Liz is also responsible for wrangling me into\
  \ the secret project where she and I and a couple of other Werecabbages got a credit\
  \ in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>!</p> <p>With such a commitment to the community,\
  \ it's no surprise that six years ago, Liz got picked up by the big purple golem.\
  \ We were so happy for her and knew that she would kick ass there and it was great\
  \ to see her making a positive change in her life exploring a new career. Starting\
  \ off in Customer Service, she went to Webstore Specialist to Community Manager\
  \ (and wore a bunch of other hats along the way).</p> <p>A few years later, Liz\
  \ was one of the first people I got in touch with when I was offered a job here,\
  \ because I knew that she'd give it to me straight about what it was like at Paizo.</p>\
  \ <p>Even though we don't work in the same department, I've greatly enjoyed working\
  \ with Liz. We get to work side by side at conventions (where she has frequently\
  \ taken pictures of me in boxes and posted them to the blog). Liz has always been\
  \ a hard worker who gives a damn about what she's doing. I'm going to miss having\
  \ her here as someone to talk to and rely on for a solid opinion on something. She\
  \ always has a level head and makes good calls. It's going to be tough to fill her\
  \ shoes. I'm gonna miss you, Liz!</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Adam Daigle<br>\
  \ <i>Developer</i></p> <p>It's hard to imagine the Paizo office without Liz because\
  \ she was already such an integral part of it by the time I showed up. Her influence\
  \ in the Pathfinder community stretches so far and wide, that I admit I was a bit\
  \ intimidated when I first met her. I had heard tales of her fiercely loyal friendship\
  \ and delicious baked goods, and Liz wasted no time in extending that sense of community\
  \ and family to me when I stepped in the door.</p> <p>Since that day she has been\
  \ a fount of knowledge, advice, creativity, inspiration, and encouragement. She's\
  \ not one to sit idly by and watch a peer suffer. She'll give you all the tricks\
  \ she has up her sleeve to help, and if that doesn't do it she'll know which direction\
  \ to point you. She spreads such joy and enthusiasm about the game, about art, and\
  \ about life, and has always been the first to encourage those around her to do\
  \ what they love. I know that I'm not alone in feeling that the time I've been honored\
  \ to work with her has had a deep impact on me, both personally and professionally.\
  \ As selfishly sad as I am that I won't be able to see her every day at work, I\
  \ am beyond thrilled for the future that lies in pursuing her craft. I know that\
  \ wherever there are rooms full of gamers sharing laughs and rolling dice, Liz won't\
  \ ever be too far away.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Katina Davis<br> <i>Customer\
  \ Service Representative</i></p> <p>Liz was my friend before I ever started at Paizo,\
  \ and was the bedrock of the Paizo fan community when I first started getting into\
  \ Golarion. She was also a kickass roommate for many years, even if we did argue\
  \ constantly over cat-rearing philosophies. It was amazing when we ended up coworkers.\
  \ She's been so smart and passionate and friendly at every turn. The office is going\
  \ to feel a lot emptier without her here, but I'm thrilled that she's moving on\
  \ to bigger and better things!</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Crystal Frasier<br>\
  \ <i>Developer</i></p> </td>\n        <td> <p>I first interacted with Liz as a third-party\
  \ publisher of Pathfinder-compatible material. I wasn't joking when I dubbed her\
  \ Paizo's Patron Saint of 3PP. Her professionalism, vast knowledge base, and friendly\
  \ assistance with any issue or question I had as publisher of Rogue Genius Games\
  \ had a major impact on our success, and on the success of Pathfinder-compatible\
  \ third-party efforts in general. A endless round of thanks and applause, Liz!</p>\
  \ <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p> <p>LIZ!\
  \ Thank you so much for helping keep Paizo fans happy, and for keeping Paizo employees\
  \ happy! You will be missed, but hopefully this means you'll have LOTS of free time\
  \ now to draw me LOTS more Merisiel pictures, right? Well... even if you don't,\
  \ have fun and good luck and keep gaming!</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">James\
  \ Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> <p>My very first experience with Liz was\
  \ at Gen Con 2014. It was my first Gen Con and I was a bit starstruck seeing all\
  \ these people who make the game I love. I went to the Paizo booth a few times,\
  \ and ended up at the register Liz was running more than once. When I went to pickup\
  \ my subscription was one of those times. I told her I was picking up my subs and\
  \ gave her my name. She then, without looking anything up, said my email address\
  \ and asked if that was me. Liz Courts liked my email address and had remembered\
  \ it! LIZ COURTS liked my email address and remembered it! I spent what was probably\
  \ a few hours making starstruck fanboy squeals at my friends. There were even more\
  \ of those squeals this past Christmas. I love Star Wars. I love Pathfinder. Amiri\
  \ is my favorite iconic. On my desk right now is a wonderful piece of Liz art (Liz\
  \ is a wonderful artist!) of Amiri as an X-Wing pilot that she gave me for Christmas!</p>\
  \ <p>Liz, I feel very fortunate for having been able to work with you, and more\
  \ importantly be friends with you. It has always amazed me how much information\
  \ you have hanging out in your head. That you remember every single item on our\
  \ website is amazing. That you remember every single fandom of everyone around you\
  \ is also amazing (and it makes every wallet attack you make a critical hit!)! I\
  \ would wish you luck with your future endeavors but you are such a talented writer\
  \ and artist that I know you don't need luck. The work you have put in to your craft\
  \ will take you wherever you want to go. I will miss talking about Mass Effect,\
  \ Dragon Age, and all of the fandoms. Thank you for everything, Liz! Peace and long\
  \ life!</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Diego Valdez<br> <i>Customer Service\
  \ Representative</i></p> <p>When I think of Liz, I immediately think of the Gen\
  \ Con many years ago when she somehow got a hold of a creepy dolphin puppet, which\
  \ she proceeded to wield like Pam from the cartoon Archer. A whole crew of us spent\
  \ that last night of the show hanging around someone's hotel room, shooting the\
  \ breeze while she made the dolphin puppet leer at us, turning every innocent comment\
  \ into innuendo by virtue of its smarmy, knows-too-much smile. So while I could\
  \ say all sorts of things about how awesome Liz has been for the company and the\
  \ community, or how talented she is in a variety of fields, I'd be lying if I didn't\
  \ say my first association with the name Liz Courts is \"raunchy dolphin puppet.\"\
  </p> <p>And I think that, in itself, may be the greatest praise.</p> <p style=\"\
  text-align: right;\">James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> <p>I met Liz\
  \ for the first time at PaizoCon 2009 where she GM'd my very first convention game.\
  \ Since then she has been an enthusiastic, supportive and amazing coworker, officemate\
  \ and friend. I've been lucky enough to get to witness her growth as an artist and\
  \ author and while I'm excited to see where her talent and dedication and love of\
  \ gaming leads her, I'm going to miss the heck out of seeing her smile every time\
  \ I peak over my computer.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Sara Marie<br> <i>Customer\
  \ Service Manager</i></p> <p>I will miss that Liz always has a relevant gif handy\
  \ to help bring humor or sympathy to situations. And will I miss things like delicious\
  \ brownies from the Department of Morale Adjustment. However, my wallet will NOT\
  \ miss sneaky wallet gninja attacks, that are perfectly relevant-to-interests™.</p>\
