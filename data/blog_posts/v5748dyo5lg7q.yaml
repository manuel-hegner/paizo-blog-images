  \ itemprop=\"description\">Many years ago, back in the days of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>, there were plans to open up the paladin class\
  \ to characters of any alignment. Unfortunately, the constraints of the class and\
  \ its many alignment-based abilities made it too much of a challenge to fit in the\
  \ pages of that book. Fortunately, the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</i></a> gave us the opportunity to revisit the idea in the form of\
  \ the Warpriest.</span></p> \n     <p>Blending together the powers of the fighter\
  \ and the cleric, the warpriest is a class that allows you to represent the ideals\
  \ of your deity, but to back them up with cold, hard steel. The class had 6 levels\
  \ of divine spellcasting, combined with an ability called blessings that work like\
  \ domains, but grant combat focused abilities. It seemed like a perfect blend, but\
  \ the first version of the class that we put forth to playtest did not go over very\
  \ well. The powers and abilities, as initially designed, just did not give the player\
  \ enough martial ability to get the job done. It had some the spellcasting and some\
  \ of the combat skill, but the two just did not work well together as initially\
  \ presented. Fortunately, in round 2 of the playtest, we got it right (or maybe\
  \ a bit too right). We added an ability called fervor that allows the warpriest\
  \ to channel energy to heal his allies similar to a paladin's lay on hands, but\
  \ it also could be spent to cast warpriest spells as a swift action, as long as\
  \ those spells only targeted the warpriest. We also changed an ability called sacred\
  \ weapon, which allows the warpriest to designate a weapon (or the favored weapon\
  \ of his deity) and use that weapon to greater effect, increasing the damage and\
  \ attack bonus.</p> \n     <p>Unfortunately, that caused a bit of a problem. The\
  \ class was a bit too good.</p> \n     <p>The second round of playtest showed us\
  \ some really interesting data. Everyone seemed in love with the class, which is\
  \ certainly good, but our surveys also showed us that the class was now at the top\
  \ of the power curve. After a number of internal playtests, it became clear that\
  \ attacking with the full attack bonus of a fighter, combined with swift-casting\
  \ a number of \"buff\" spells made the class a juggernaut. Since we really liked\
  \ how the fervor mechanic worked, the sacred weapon rules had to change. Sacred\
  \ weapon still increases the damage of weapons and it can still be used to grant\
  \ special abilities to the weapon, but it no longer increases the attack bonus of\
  \ the warpriest when using the designated weapon. Just like that, everything seemed\
  \ to fit. </p> \n     <p>We also took another look at a wide number of the blessings,\
  \ bringing them all in line with one another and making them a more seamless part\
  \ of the class. Take the community blessing for example. The major version of the\
  \ blessing did not fit really well and was outright useless to a warpriest of Erastil.\
  \ It got changed to the following.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Fight as\
  \ One (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can rally your allies to fight together. For\
  \ 1 minute, whenever you make a successful melee or ranged attack against a foe,\
  \ allies within 10 feet of you gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks of the same type\
  \ you made against that foeâ€”melee attacks if you made a melee attack, or ranged\
  \ attacks if you made a ranged attack. If you score a critical hit, this bonus increases\
  \ to +4 until the start of your next turn.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>There\
  \ are a lot of other exciting changes in the blessings as well, but for those, you\
  \ will have to wait until the book arrives in stores and at Gencon in mid-August.\
  \ Come back on Thursday to unleash your inner rage, now improved with magic!</p>\
