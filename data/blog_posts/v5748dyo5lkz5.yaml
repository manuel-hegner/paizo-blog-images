  \ <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/againstTheAeonThrone\">Against the Aeon\
  \ Throne</a> Adventure Path releases this month, marking several changes to the\
  \ Starfinder Adventure Path format, some permanent, some more experimental. Firstly,\
  \ as many of you know by now, Starfinder Adventure Path is becoming a monthly product!\
  \ We'll be delivering new adventures, new articles, and new creatures to you every\
  \ 30 days or so until someone makes us stop. Heck, it's worked pretty well for Pathfinder\
  \ all these years, so I think we'll probably be fine. We have a lot of exciting\
  \ campaigns and stories that we want to share with you, so we hope you'll join us\
  \ for this journey among the stars.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  \ <p><i>Illustration by David Melvin</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Secondly is\
  \ our exploration of a shorter campaign length. Both Against the Aeon Throne and\
  \ the following Adventure Path, <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams\"\
  >Signal of Screams</a>, are presented in just three volumes, giving groups a chance\
  \ for a somewhat extended experience in the Starfinder universe without having to\
  \ commit to a full six-volume campaign, which can usually take at least a year to\
  \ play. When we decided to double our production of adventures, we also thought\
  \ the change would be a good opportunity to experiment a bit with the format. And\
  \ the plots and themes we wanted to work with at the time seemed to lend themselves\
  \ to shorter arcs. Thus, the three-volume campaign was born!</p> \n     <p>These\
  \ shorter campaigns let us explore a slightly more focused narrative, much in the\
  \ same way a Pathfinder Module tells a complete, self-contained story. We can really\
  \ hit the most important plot points with big, splashy encounters and not have to\
  \ worry about sustaining that level of energy over six adventures. While the six-volume\
  \ campaign is great for telling epic, sweeping tales, these shorter adventures allow\
  \ us delve into moments that might affect the characters on a more personal level.\
  \ However, that doesn't mean the fate of the galaxy won't be at stake!</p> \n  \
  \   <p>That isn't all we're trying out over the next several months. While the beginning\
  \ of Against the Aeon Throne is for new 1st-level characters, the first adventure\
  \ of Signal of Screams is for 7th-level characters. This will mark the first time\
  \ an Adventure Path won't begin at 1st level! That being said, if your group isn't\
  \ comfortable with starting at 7th level, then we made sure that the two Adventure\
  \ Paths dovetail nicely into one another. Once you've finished with Against the\
  \ Aeon Throne, you can transition right into Signal of Screams. Sure, there will\
  \ be a slight change of tone in the adventures, but if your group doesn't mind the\
  \ shift, then you should go for it!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  \ these adventures get released, we are very interested in hearing your feedback\
  \ about the changes. How do you like the three-volume format? Are six-volume Adventure\
  \ Paths too long for your group? Would you like to see more content that starts\
  \ at higher levels? Or do you prefer the dangerous thrill of those first few levels?\
  \ Let us know!</p> \n     <p>And don't worry, the Starfinder Adventure Path line\
  \ returns to the usual six-volume campaign in February of 2019 with Dawn of Flame!</p>\
