  \ </p> \n      <p>Yup, that’s exactly what we were shouting at the end of this marathon,\
  \ since our party of gunslingers was somehow, someway, still alive. Not only that,\
  \ the Black Powder Cadre is coming off a clean run in this latest marathon, where\
  \ we rifled out enough critical hits to make clutch situations look easy. In case\
  \ you need to catch up on Order of the Amber Die’s project, here’s a good place\

  \ the schedules of the teachers in our group, so we had a little more time off between\
  \ sessions this time around. This gave us a chance to catch up with Rob Pontious\
  \ of <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/\">Know Direction</a>, who put together\
  \ a <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2023/04/investing-in-order-of-the-amber-dies-abomination-arsenal/\"\
  >closer look</a> at the project so far. Since Rob is also an OAD member, he delved\
  \ into some of the big questions surrounding our project, including this one: why\
  \ did we choose to play all gunslingers? Give it a read and find out! In the meantime,\
  \ here are the stats on the latest marathon:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><strong>Adventures:</strong>\
  \ <em>Ruins of Gauntlight </em>and <em>Hands of the Devil</em></li> \n       <li><strong>Marathon\
  \ Length:</strong> 56hrs, 35min</li> \n       <li><strong>Session Hours:</strong>\
  \ 35hrs, 30min</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>As this was our third marathon, our\
  \ goal was to finish up <em>Ruins of Gauntlight </em>and head down into the middle\
  \ levels of the Abomination Vaults. On levels five through seven of the megadungeon,\
  \ we entered the next volume of the Adventure Path, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024ur?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-164-Hands-of-the-Devil\"\
  ><em>Hands of the Devil</em></a>. Most importantly for us, though, was that we squared\
  \ off against Vanessa Hoskins, an author we hadn’t faced before. After playing more\
  \ than 150 published adventures by dozens of writers over the years, it’s a fresh\
  \ treat when we encounter someone whose work we aren’t extensively familiar with.\
  \ We still have a chunk of the adventure to play through, but here’s one thing that\
  \ even our most jaded dungeon crawlers agreed on: Vanessa will surprise you, so\
  \ expect anything.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/35faf8ad-48da-4e4b-9a40-66dae1c95940/OoTAD3_MapwCRB.png\"\

  \      </div> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Highlights from Marathon 3</h3> \n      <ul>\
  \ \n       <li>Just because this Adventure Path focuses on a massive dungeon doesn’\
  t mean that everything takes place there, and it certainly doesn’t mean that there\
  \ aren’t great opportunities for roleplaying. In search of a Roseguard icon known\
  \ as the Cooperative Blade, we pursued the slighted blacksmith, Carman Rajani, to\
  \ a forest cave outside of town. The smith got the jump on us and was able to do\
  \ to an overconfident Tess what no man had done thus far—maim her with one of the\
  \ biggest hits of the campaign! Carman had the party’s attention, and Tess listened\
  \ with bated breath as he talked about being the new, rightful mayor of Otari. She\
  \ brashly offered the party’s aid—as the future Mrs. Rajani, of course. Carman found\
  \ his way to Tess’s heart and helped the Black Powder Cadre find their way to a\
  \ deeper level of the megadungeon.</li> \n       <li>In case you can’t tell, we\
  \ like to test RPG absolutes. This time, we tackled the adage “never split the party.”\
  \ Two characters became separated when they were shoved down a chute by an invisible\
  \ creature on level four. One of them was Maloika, and goblin curiosity being what\
  \ it is, he led Zoric on a foray of their own. What happened next was a cinematic\
  \ moment that will stand out long after our project is over—reminiscent of the first\
  \ time we saw the pirate ship in <em>The Goonies</em>. As the pair waded through\
  \ a watery passage of unworked stone, into view came the long-sought remains of\
  \ the rogue Otari himself—one of the original members of the Roseguard!</li> \n\
  \       <li>Our old buddy, Joe O’Brien from the <a href=\"https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/\"\
  >Glass Cannon Network</a>, joined us on our third day of dungeon-crawling while\
  \ rocking the Beast Gunner archetype. We welcomed this new gunslinger into the Cadre\
  \ by aiming straight for his head, after several characters became confused by a\
  \ gibbering mouther accompanied by grothlut fleshwarps. Big props, though! Joe survived\
  \ a precarious PvP shootout and then offered up his Hit Point total for the last\
  \ few rounds: one!</li> \n       <li>We’ve got a bunch of soccer fans in the Order\
  \ who are eager for the Women’s World Cup this summer, and we’re also known to grab\
  \ seats together for Philly Union matches. Many thanks to Vanessa, who gave us something\
  \ we’ve always wanted: our first VIP box, complete with a screen showing the best\
  \ camera angles! The only problem was that the box overlooked a creepy arena instead\
  \ of a soccer field, and that a couple of poltergeists wouldn’t give up their chairs\
  \ from the last match. Instead of fighting them for the best spot in the house,\
  \ we simply showed them what they had been struggling to find for the past 500 years:\
  \ a way out of the megadungeon.</li> \n       <li>While exploring some old holding\
  \ cells in the Vaults, we came across several disgusting amalgamations of aged flesh\
  \ and bone known as shanrigols. These unused remnants of fleshwarping experiments\
  \ seemed like they could be dangerous, but we were just too tempted by a key that\
  \ gleamed inside one of the heaps. Since they didn’t attack immediately, we seized\
  \ an opportunity unique to a party of gunslingers. Our front characters knelt, the\
  \ back ones stood, and we created a perfect two-rank line formation that would have\
  \ made the Duke of Wellington proud. Weapons aimed, we waited for Vlai’s order.\
  \ FIRE!</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n      <h3>The Arsenal</h3> \n      <p>We’\
  ve tried to describe our GM’s style a few different ways over the years, but for\
  \ this campaign, just imagine yourself in the bullet ballet of a John Woo film.\
  \ Think muzzle flashes in the dark, black powder cartridges falling in slow motion\
  \ to the dungeon floor, the distinctive crack of a ricochet as it mars a statue,\
  \ and the crunching sound that wood makes when a door gets splintered open with\
  \ a scattergun. Oh, and there are plenty of “click-clicks” around the table, because\
  \ reloading is just plain fun and it happens A LOT. Adam loves to make sound effects,\
  \ and for this campaign we all join in. Toss in some of Zack Hemsey’s “Nice to Meet\
  \ Me” in the background, and you’ve got a feel for what it’s like at our table.\
  \ </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Character Deaths</h3> \n      <p>Zero. We might\
  \ be getting cocky.</p> \n      <h3>Best Quote from Marathon 3</h3> \n      <p>(Maloika,\
  \ being severely mauled by Jaul Mezmin, a werewolf)</p> \n      <p>Sean: “Dude,\
  \ please, I can’t die to this guy; it’s part of my character’s story. I have to\
  \ defeat him and tell Keleeno.”<br> Adam: (stands, picks up the Amber Die) “Forget\
  \ your PC’s story. The Amber Die writes the stories here! (throws it across the\
  \ entire table) NATURAL 20, BABY!”</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  s dragon-mouth pistol and Vlai’s scattergun helped us get past Volluk, the swarmy\
  \ mini-boss on level four. We proceeded to shoot through level five, but when we\
  \ said author Vanessa Hoskins will surprise you, we meant it. We eventually found\
  \ ourselves on a balcony overlooking an arena, and down on the floor—lying dormant—\
  was a reddish, gargantuan-sized mound of discarded fleshwarping materials. Better\
  \ yet, behind this monstrosity was a 15ft. diameter gong, suspended by sturdy chains.\
  \ What red-blooded adventurer could resist the temptation to shoot a patio-sized\
  \ gong with the biggest firearm in <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears? </em>Thus, a\
  \ harmona gun was loaded, shouldered, and discharged. The gong shuddered loud enough\
  \ to be heard over in the Emerald Spire. Then, the behemoth shuddered.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>We’re about to blow open a whole new meaning for pink mist. </p> \n    \
