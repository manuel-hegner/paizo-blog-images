  \ by Remko Troost</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Raia Danviri\
  \ was born and raised in the lashunta city-state of Komena, near the southern tip\
  \ of the continent of Asana on Castrovel. Komena's proximity to the formian-inhabited\
  \ continent of the Colonies has made it a center of military activity for millennia,\
  \ but to the Danviris, it was a home filled with hope and promise. Raia's parents\
  \ were diplomats, and devoted their lives to brokering a peace between the lashuntas\
  \ and the formians, a goal that spanned decades. They taught their daughter the\
  \ value of all sentient life, for even among creatures like the insectile formians,\
  \ who were so unlike lashuntas and had been enemies for so long, one can find similarities\
  \ like culture, society, and civilization. But even more important are the differences.\
  \ The details that separate one species from another are not only what make them\
  \ interesting, but also teach one new things, and inspire one to question and re-examine\
  \ one's own assumptions and beliefs.</p> \n     <p>The fact that Raia's parents\
  \ actually succeeded in helping to negotiate peace with the Colonies only reinforced\
  \ their teachings in the young lashunta's mind. Raia became almost obsessed with\
  \ alien life forms. She devoured any texts she could find that described the myriad\
  \ species that inhabited the worlds beyond Castrovel, and dreamed of someday traveling\
  \ among the stars and meeting new species. When she reached puberty, Raia chose\
  \ to develop into the tall, intellectual damaya subspecies, following the example\
  \ of her parents, both of whom are damaya.</p> \n     <p>When she was old enough,\
  \ Raia applied to and was accepted into one of Qabarat's famed universities. Her\
  \ aptitude exams showed a talent for both technology and spellcasting, so she studied\
  \ the discipline of technomancy, using experimentation to blend science and magic\
  \ together. At the same time, however, she also excelled in xenobiology and xenoanthropology,\
  \ applying academic rigor to her childhood passion. During this time, Raia discovered\
  \ Yaraesa, the lashunta goddess of knowledge and wisdom, whose faith was more akin\
  \ to the scientific method. Raia wholeheartedly embraced Yaraesa's teachings, seeking\
  \ self-perfection through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of one's\
  \ mind and intellect.</p> \n     <p>It was also at university that Raia met Danese,\
  \ an exchange student from Triaxus. Raia was immediately enthralled with the exotic\
  \ ryphorian and his silky white fur, but it was Danese's quick wit and keen intellect\
  \ that turned the initial attraction into something more. Danese was the first real\
  \ \"alien” that Raia befriended, and their friendship eventually blossomed into\
  \ love. Raia and Danese were inseparable during their time at university, but knew\
  \ they would need to reassess their relationship when their studies were complete.\
  \ Danese had already accepted a commission in the Skyfire Legion and had to return\
  \ to Triaxus after graduation, while Raia had been accepted into a graduate program\
  \ on Absalom Station. Danese offered to resign his commission, but Raia refused.\
  \ In her opinion, neither of them should have to sacrifice their own advancement\
  \ and improvement for the sake of the other; instead, each of them should follow\
  \ Yaraesa's example and figure things out for themselves—intellectually and spiritually,\
  \ as well as romantically. They bid each other a tearful farewell, and promised\
  \ to reunite whenever circumstances allowed.</p> \n     <p>After completing her\
  \ studies, Raia realized that her passion for studying alien life-forms was actually\
  \ a calling, and her technomantic abilities were the currency she could use to fund\
  \ her life's work, exchanging her skills as a scientist and technomancer for berths\
  \ on ships heading out to undiscovered regions of the Vast. Raia believes there\
  \ is a certain nobility in contacting an alien species for the first time and working\
  \ to ensure that both they and the peoples of the Pact Worlds advance and improve\
  \ from the relationship. She seeks out new technology and alternative magical techniques\
  \ from the aliens she encounters, trading her own knowledge in exchange. Raia doesn't\
  \ hold to any unrealistic expectation of non-interference in alien cultures, but\
  \ believes strongly in doing the right thing, and in always striving for honor,\
  \ compassion, and justice.</p> \n     <p>Despite her love of exploration, Raia remains\
  \ firmly tied to the Pact Worlds. Besides her parents and friends on Castrovel,\
  \ Raia still loves Danese, and the two remain committed to one another, even across\
  \ the vast distances involved in interstellar travel. They stay in regular communication,\
  \ and treasure the infrequent times when their paths bring them physically close\
  \ to one another. Some day, they might choose to settle down and build a life together,\
  \ but for now Raia is content. She knows love, her life has purpose and meaning,\
  \ and the galaxy is filled with an endless number of aliens to discover, befriend,\
  \ and study—one species at a time.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Robert G. McCreary<br>\
