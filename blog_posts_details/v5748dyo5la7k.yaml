    \ History: I'm sure that by now you're probably getting the general gist of the\
    \ Pathfinder ideology, but the history of a game world is just as important—and\
    \ potentially inspiring—as it's geography. A chance for us (not to mention some\
    \ of the biggest names in the RPG business) to shade in the historical background\
    \ of our world? Yes, please! Pre-generated Characters: Never again will you have\
    \ to worry about players forgetting their character sheets at home. Each volume\
    \ of Pathfinder will feature pre-generated characters based on Wayne Reynolds's\
    \ stunning depictions of the Paizo iconics, allowing you and your party to grab\
    \ the book and jump straight into the adventure with a minimum of prep time. Whew!\
    \ Keep in mind that those are only a few of the broad categories you might find\
    \ in each volume—as I mentioned before, one of the things that excites me most\
    \ about Pathfinder personally is our freedom to run the pieces that need to be\
    \ run, regardless of whether or not they fit in with an established section. To\
    \ build something"
