  \ I am a Seattle boy and love the ocean. My time is now split helping create the\

  \ Paizo is my first full-time job after graduating from college, and prior to that\
  \ I had a year and a half of internships, two of which were in Los Angeles. When\
  \ I’m not designing, you’ll find me at any random coffee shop in the Seattle area,\
  \ hiking, camping, shopping, and traveling! Happy to be a part of the team!”</p>\

  \ drew to a close and we were sorting out when our new Customer Service Representative\
  \ could come in for her first day of work at Paizo, I realized with dismay that\
  \ her start date was going to fall on the first day of Gen Con and the launch of\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition—a day we anticipated would be one of the busiest days\
  \ of the year for customer service. But I also knew that based on what I saw in\
  \ her interview, if anyone could handle the challenge, it would be Joan!</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Joan comes to Paizo with a wealth of knowledge and skills from her experiences\
  \ in the nonprofit sector, including her volunteer work as Co-Founder and Social\
  \ Media Manager for Outdoor Asian. In the two months she’s been a part of our customer\
  \ service team, I’ve been impressed with the speed at which she’s picked up Paizo’\
  s complex custom software and her ability to remain even-keeled and steadfast, even\
  \ in the face of a service request backlog mounting into quadruple digits. As we\
  \ get ready to gear up for PaizoCon 2020, I’m looking forward to seeing what her\
  \ experience as an event planner will bring to the team.</p> \n     <p>“Joan joins\

  Sara Marie, Customer Service and Community Manager</i></p> \n     <p>“I have three\
  \ great loves in my life: food, gaming and the outdoors. There's never a shortage\
  \ of great food around here and I volunteer outdoors, so landing a position at Paizo\
  \ was the perfect way to complete my trifecta!</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder’s Shattered\
  \ Star Adventure Path was my first TTRPG adventure back in college, so I am especially\
  \ thrilled to be immersed in the action here. Already, I have learned so much and\
  \ have had so many new and exciting opportunities open up for me. It has been such\
  \ an absolute joy working with Virginia, Diego, Sam and Sara Marie in CS thus far,\
  \ and I’m grateful to be part of such a fun, compassionate and incredibly talented\
  \ work family.”</p> \n     <p><i>—Joan Hong, Customer Service Representative</i></p>\

  \ the creation of the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook serving as both an\
  \ editor and a developer, and we are thrilled to have her as a part of the team\
  \ full time, helping us to create new and exciting rules for the game. Lyz has been\
  \ working with Paizo for several years now, first as a freelance editor, then as\
  \ a full-time member of the staff, and while she has already been <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgn5?Welcome-to-Lyz-Liddell\"\

  \ this new opportunity!”</p> \n     <p><i>—Jason Bulmahn, Director of Game Design</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>“What a strange road this has been! I came to RPGs as a player, and\
  \ I came to Paizo as an editor. I love games and I love working with them, but it\
  \ wasn’t until I got the chance to work on Starfinder that I realized how much I\
  \ love working with games as they’re being built. It wasn’t until the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest that I realized how much I have to offer during that process (I still\
  \ have my sheaf of development notes!), and it wasn’t until the production of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition that I realized how much I love really digging into the rules of\
  \ a game. I hadn’t ever considered myself a designer—or even a potential designer—\
  until this position opened up and my coworkers starting saying I should apply for\
  \ it. That got my gears turning, and from there I realized how much I enjoy this\
  \ aspect of my work and how good I can be at it.</p> \n     <p>“I’m very excited\
  \ to be at the leading edge of the new edition of Pathfinder. I love how streamlined\
  \ and elegant the game is at its core: it’s fun for Pathfinder veterans and accessible\
  \ to new gamers. I’m looking forward to expanding the core ruleset to make more\
  \ options available—after all, that’s a huge part of what makes Pathfinder the game\
  \ it is! I’m also hopeful that I can help inspire others who never imagined themselves\
  \ in a particular creative role to step up and go for it”.</p> \n     <p><i>Lyz\

  \ is absolutely perfect for Starfinder’s Lead Designer role. In the weeks since\
  \ he’s been promoted into that position—and even before he officially got word—\
  Joe has been firing on all cylinders to make the Starfinder RPG the absolute best\
  \ that it can be, from looking at sticky rules questions to considering the major\
  \ mechanical direction of the game to everything in between. The Starfinder team\
  \ and all of its fans are much better for having Joe’s careful and conscientious\

  \ Star Chamber’s developer chairs. And from his very first day at Paizo, everything\
  \ from Jake’s love of editing Starfinder to his work to publish third-party Starfinder\
  \ RPG products has always been energizing. What’s more, that work gave him the demonstrated\
  \ experience, skill, and insight to be ready for this hectic gig from day one. It’\
  s been so exciting to have Jake on our team, where his passion, enthusiasm, and\

  \ \n     <p>“Here’s a true story: When I was recruited onto the editing team, they\
  \ asked me what product line I was most looking forward to working on. “Starfinder!”\
  \ was my reply. The game had just come out, and I could get in on the ground floor.\
  \ Soon after I moved to Seattle, I started a regular Starfinder campaign with old\
  \ friends, which I used to test ideas I published through a third party press. Mentored\
  \ by Chris Sims, who sat at the desk I sit at now, I wrote two Starfinder AP volumes,\
  \ two Starfinder Society scenarios, and a bunch of back matter articles. What I’\
  m trying to say is, when the chance came to join the Star Chamber, I was positioned.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“And I was on the job for one week when I was told to pitch my first\
  \ Starfinder Adventure Path! What I came up with, my colleagues are calling “ambitious,”\

  \ and one of Paizo’s most veteran developers, John has an incredible amount to offer\
  \ the Star Chamber (you can thank former Starfinder Design Lead Owen K.C. Stephens\
  \ for that moniker!). Finally, in August, the science-fantasy stars aligned, and\
  \ John accepted a promotion to Starfinder Senior Developer. Now, every day he demonstrates\
  \ the incredible value to Starfinder of his general sensibilities for what’s cool,\
