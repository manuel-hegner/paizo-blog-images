  \ Musings</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Sighing, Janira puts her quill\
  \ down, reaching for the cup of tea sitting next to her on the desk. Cautiously\
  \ she takes a sip, testing the temperature before settling back into her seat and\
  \ finishing the cup. “Well, that’s done,” she murmurs at the papers before her,\
  \ before glancing at the stack sitting neatly on the back corner of the desk. She\
  \ sets the empty cup back on its saucer, then picks up her quill and retrieves the\
  \ top paper from the stack. “Once more into the breach, old friend. Let’s get this\
  \ wrapped quickly, so that we can go see how the newest initiates fared on the obstacle\
  \ course. I bet Marcos the newest Envoy’s would get through fastest and I want to\
  \ see if I won.” </p> \n     <h2>AcP and GM Credits</h2> \n     <p>We made great\
  \ strides on resolving the issues in the AcP program. The quests are now giving\
  \ the correct number of points – 1 per player and 2 per GM – as well as reflecting\
  \ any bumps for Premier and Premier Plus events. Those multiplier bumps levelled\
  \ out at 1.25 for a Premier event and 1.5 for a Premier Plus event. This multiplier\
  \ goes with the base points for the type of adventure being run. So, playing a scenario\
  \ is usually 4, becomes 5 at a Premier event and 6 at a Premier Plus event. Running\
  \ a scenario earns a GM 8 points, with 10 points at a Premier event and 12 at a\
  \ Premier Plus. When you look at your My Organized Play page, you will see AcP listed\
  \ in two columns. The first is the base points that type of game earns. The second,\
  \ on the far right, notes the amount of points you earned, ie base times any event\
  \ multipliers. </p> \n     <p>What does this mean for launch? It is imminent. We\
  \ found one small bug – all boons sheets generated by the program awarded them to\
  \ Org Play #8. We’re pretty sure Linda needs ALL the boons and are working to fix\
  \ the code so that it populates a purchaser’s org play number. Once that change\
  \ is made, we should be good to launch the purchasing.</p> \n     <p>This also means\
  \ we are REMOVING the free rebuild boon from those available. At this point, we\
  \ plan to remove that boon <b>2 weeks</b> after we launch AcP purchases. We will\
  \ include a rebuild boon on the AcP reward chart, but it will cost. If you are planning\
  \ on doing any character rebuilds, I highly encourage you to do so now!</p> \n \
  \    <p>For those watching, you’ve also seen GM credit appear for Starfinder Society\
  \ games – it was listing 0 for a long time – and for Pathfinder Society (second\
  \ edition) tables. We fixed the Nova image display a bit ago and just uploaded the\
  \ Glyph. Those should be showing up on accounts shortly. The new rating system is\
  \ built and we’re getting trained on how to implement it so that we can get five\
  \ stars/nova (and soon glyph) status updated via the new method. We will catch up\
  \ all those who earned the status but haven’t seen their fifth star appear, so that\
  \ should be resolved shortly as well.</p> \n     <p>There is one outstanding issue\
  \ with Glyph GM credit that we need to resolve. That is Quests are currently awarding\
  \ 1 table credit. It is not our intention that a GM can run Quests as a way to reach\
  \ their 5th Glyph faster than a GM who runs scenarios. Thus, we are changing Glyps\
  \ to award award partial credit - .25 as they are one-quarter of a scenario. At\
  \ the same time, we are looking at modules and adventure paths and what an appropriate\
  \ GM credit would be for the longer form adventures. We anticipate this will lead\
  \ to several bands of GM credit based on the size/length of the adventure. These\
  \ changes are ongoing and should be resolved shortly.</p> \n     <p>Whew – that\
  \ was a bit of information. But there’s still more topics to cover.</p> \n     <h2>Origins/ConCurrent</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>PaizoCon Online resulted in running over 1200 games – many more than\
  \ we would run at a traditional PaizoCon. Knowing the demand for online games, we\
  \ submitted 450ish to Origins Online. Unfortunately, they were only able to accept\
  \ 100 of our tables. This accounts for 10% of all Origins programming, which is\
  \ a large portion. But what to do with the other 350ish tables? Seeing the demand\
  \ for PaizoCon, we didn’t want to cancel the tables. Instead of cancelling, we decided\
  \ to run ConCurrent. It will function as a Premier Plus Con with all the associated\
  \ benefits. The only difference is that we are providing HQ and admin support via\
  \ our online discord server, same as we did for PaizoCon.</p> \n     <p>While we\
  \ aren’t going to reopen GM signups or add more RPG games, we do have a few vacancies\
  \ for GMs as well as space in our on-call pool, which will allow us to cover GM\
  \ illness or those that don’t show for their tables without stress. If you are interested\
  \ in assisting, please join the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG\" target=\"\
  _blank\">OPF Major Conventions discord</a>, join the Origins Online channel and\
  \ post in the #gm-waitlist thread.</p> \n     <p>A bit of oversight on our part\
  \ led to us not listing PACS games/taking PACS organizer registrations at the same\
  \ time we did the RPG GM registrations. We added the PACS tables to our schedule\
  \ and are asking anyone interested in running PACS at Origins Online/ConCurrant\
  \ to join the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG\" target=\"_blank\">OPF\
  \ Major Conventions discord</a> and visit the #gm-selection tab to register to be\
  \ table organizer for games.</p> \n     <h2>Gen Con</h2> \n     <p>Gen Con released\
  \ information about getting our events on their schedule, so we are moving forward\
  \ with requesting OPF for GMs for Gen Con. Once again, we will do registration through\
  \ the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG\" target=\"_blank\">OPF Major\
  \ Conventions discord</a> starting Saturday, June 6th at 1 PM. We post the schedule\
  \ on the server and GMs may claim games on a first come, first served registration.\
  \ The current plan is to offer tables of all our programs – Pathfinder Society (both\
  \ editions), Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. Once we\
  \ have our schedule, we will upload it to Gen Con systems so that they can put tickets\
  \ on sale. For players interested in attending Gen Con, register to attend and view\
  \ events on the <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con website</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n     <p>We awarded a number of coins at the end\
  \ of PaizoCon Online. Congratulations to the newest recipients and thank you for\
