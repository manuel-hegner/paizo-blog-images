  \ Adventure Card Game character that I hadn’t played much, mainly because I considered\
  \ him simple, especially in his <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> form, where his main\
  \ power was just to not discard. He’s become a bit more interesting over the years,\
  \ and I love the fact that the new <em><a href=\"https://store.paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  >Core Set</a></em> abstraction converts him into a <em>sword and shield</em> fighter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As always, I suggest checking out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh4m?Core-Design-Valeros\"\
  >the related Core Design article</a>, which discusses how Valeros evolved in the\
  \ <em>Core Set</em>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg\"\

  \ \"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Core\
  \ Set Valeros</h3> \n     <p><b>Best Skill:</b> Strength (d10)<br> <b>Character\
  \ Type:</b> Warrior, Melee</p> \n     <p><b><em>Skills</em></b>. Valeros doesn’\
  t have the Strength of Amiri, but d10 isn’t bad. Overall, it’s pretty easy to remember\
  \ his strengths and weaknesses: physical stats are good, mental stats are bad. Valeros\
  \ makes up for his d10 die with four different subskills. He can choose to fight\
  \ hand-to-hand (Melee: Strength +2) or from afar (Ranged: Dexterity +1). Melee is\
  \ on average two points better, but Ranged is a slight rarity, shared by just two\
  \ other Core Set characters: Fumbus and Harsk. So Valeros might go in that direction\
  \ just to have a protected niche. Otherwise, Valeros’ subskills are all common as\
  \ dirt: Diplomacy, Fortitude, and Melee are shared by five different characters\
  \ each!</p> \n     <p><em>Weaknesses</em>. Valeros’s d4 is in Intelligence. He probably\
  \ doesn’t care.</p> \n     <p><b><em>Cards</em></b>. Valeros’s focus is obviously\
  \ on combat, with weapons (4) and armors (3) taking up almost half of his card slots.\
  \ Valeros also has a good count of allies (3) and blessings (3), which gives him\
  \ plenty of opportunity to take additional turns. Besides his total lack of spells\
  \ (0), Valeros is also somewhat limited in items (2), which gives him slightly less\
  \ variability. Unlike some versions of Valeros, the Core Set character won’t get\
  \ his hand clogged with weapons, as he can cycle them for local combat bonuses.\
  \ Nonetheless, he’ll probably want to increase his counts of weapons, items, allies,\
  \ and blessings in tandem, to remain a balanced character. Valeros is a great example\
  \ of how to build a balanced character without a lot of complexity, which is what\
  \ makes him (still) a simple character. </p>\n     <p><em>Allies</em>. If you’re\
  \ planning to pick the Compatriot role for Valeros, allies are especially important.\
  \ Allies with local powers are especially complementary for Valeros, as he should\
  \ be teaming up with other people, so take a look at cards like the Bodyguard, the\
  \ Crow, or the Soldier. Compatriot Valeros will also be able to recover allies from\
  \ the discard pile, so don’t be afraid of those scant allies that have discard-only\
  \ abilities (like the Merchant in <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>).</p> \n\
  \     <p><em>Armor</em>. Because Valeros is proficient with armor, he’ll want the\
  \ good stuff that requires proficiencies for full usage. Spiked Half-Plate gives\
  \ some nice combat bonuses, while Chain Mail can be buried to fully resist damage\
  \ (and maybe even recharged). There are many others. Though most characters don’\
  t like shields because they have no display power and so tend to get stuck in the\
  \ hand, that’s not a problem for Valeros since he can choose to recharge or reload\
  \ one at the end of his turn. Something like the Covering Heavy Shield, which can\
  \ be used to protect others, is particularly nice for a low-level Valeros (though\
  \ a higher-level Valeros Compatriot can get a similar power on every shield).</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Blessings</em>. Valeros is sometimes a follower of Cayden Cailean,\
  \ but he might also want blessings from Gorum (which tend to help physical combat),\
  \ Torag (which tend to boost Strength and Constitution), or Lamashtu (for killing\
  \ monsters).</p> \n     <p><em>Items</em>. If you’re planning for the Drunken Avenger\
  \ role, you might want to stock up on Liquids. This tends to mean Alchemical items,\
  \ although there are a few exceptions, including Holy Water and Liquid Courage in\
  \ Curse of the Crimson Throne. To hold on to these items, Valeros will have to take\
  \ the Liquid proficiency power feat (which will also give him a 1d12 bonus to the\
  \ various Craft or Divine roles needed to recharge).</p> \n     <p><em>Weapons</em>.\
  \ Valeros is a sword-and-board fighter, so he’ll want to grab all the Sword weapons,\
  \ right? Not necessarily. In the Core Set, Sword weapons tend to activate their\
  \ special powers when they reload, but since Valeros can recharge or reload weapons\
  \ from his discard pile, he may want to consider grabbing more powerful non-Sword\
  \ weapons that discard for their main ability, such as the Battleaxe or Mace, or\
  \ even ranged weapons like the ever-popular Deathbane Light Crossbow. Obviously,\
  \ Sword weapons that discard, like the Dogslicer, are great choices too. And since\
  \ Valeros’ favored card is specifically Sword weapons, you may want to limit yourself\
  \ to just one favorite one, ensuring you start every game with it in hand. (And\
  \ that does suggest that all of this strategy goes against Valeros’ intended theming,\
  \ but so be it: mechanics rule.) Just be sure not to grab Two-Handed weapons unless\
  \ you’re explicitly avoiding shields.</p> \n     <h3>The Power of Fighting</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Valeros’ combat-focused feats are all pretty easy to use, but there’\
  s nonetheless some subtlety in them too.</p> \n     <p><em><b>Stick with Your Fellows</b></em>.\
  \ Valeros has always been a team player, and that remains the case in his Core Set\
  \ incarnation. Not only can he add to local combat checks by temporarily giving\
  \ up his weapons and armor, but his roles have some additional team-up powers, and\
  \ he’s also a cheap avenge (more on which momentarily). So, the simplest rule for\
  \ Valeros is: hang with your buds. You might stay with another character who can\
  \ support local characters (creating a synergistic relationship) or you might support\
  \ someone who’s not a fighter. Of course, you could team up with someone who meets\
  \ both of those criteria: Lem is a particularly great fellow for Valeros.</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote>\n      <p><em>Clarification: What is a local check?</em> Local\
  \ means “at your location” (see page 6 of the Core Set rules), so a local check\
  \ is a check by a character at your location—including yourself. The important thing\
  \ to remember about Valeros’s ability to add a bonus to local combat checks is that\
  \ he can help his friends or <em>himself</em>(!).</p>\n     </blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p><b><em>Use Swords (and Armor) as Damage</em></b>. Because of Valeros’ ability\
  \ to recharge discarded weapons and armor, you should discard those cards when you\
  \ take damage, because you can put one back into his deck each turn. Make sure you\
  \ don’t empty your hand of weapons, but if you have extras, you can toss them into\
  \ the discards. Armor will more often be used to <em>reduce</em> damage than discarded\
  \ as damage, but when an armor just doesn’t protect from the right sort of damage\
  \ (or alternatively, when it might have to be buried or banished otherwise), then\
  \ it should be thrown out, to later be recovered.</p> \n     <blockquote>\n    \
  \  <p><em>Clarification: Can you discard displayed armor as damage? </em> No. When\
  \ you display a card, it is “not part of [your] hand, deck, or discards” (see page\
  \ 7 of the <em>Core Set</em> rules). But that also means that you get to keep your\
  \ displayed armor, even when you empty your hand due to damage. There are times\
  \ when you might make that decision!</p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <p><b><em>Avenge\
  \ Your Friends</em></b>. One of the reasons that Valeros should stick with his friends\
  \ is so that he can avenge them. For most characters, avenging is expensive, requiring\
  \ them to bury a card), but Valeros can make the cost more bearable (by discarding,\
  \ which he can recover if it’s a weapon or armor) or even cheap (if he buys the\
  \ “recharge to avenge” feat). Though avenging doesn’t save the original character\
  \ from the bad effects of losing an encounter, it usually saves an exploration’\
  s worth of time (presuming that Valeros doesn’t expend a card that would otherwise\
  \ give him another exploration) and it’s particularly helpful when fighting a villain\
  \ that would otherwise escape.</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <p><em>Clarification:\
  \ What can you avenge?</em> A “local” character can avenge “an undefeated bane”\
  \ (see page 10 of the Core Set rules). This typically means they can fight a monster\
  \ or a barrier that a local character failed to beat. This can include a summoned\
  \ bane, which can be used to good effect. (For example, a local character might\
  \ have drawn a Warband barrier, which causes everyone to fight a monster. If the\
  \ local character lost their own fight against the monster, Valeros could choose\
  \ to avenge the original Warband card, which would cause everyone to fight again,\
  \ but he’d do better to avenge the monster fight.) It can also include avenging\
  \ a villain, because you are “ignoring steps and effects that would cause the bane\
  \ to go anywhere.” Note, however, that you can’t avenge most location closing attempts,\
  \ because they’re typically just die rolls, not banes. The exception, obviously,\
  \ is when closing summons a bane that must be defeated!</p>\n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b><em>Take Your Choice of Power Feats</em></b>. Most characters have\
  \ a power feat that goes straight to the heart of their character powers, and is\
  \ thus a pretty obvious first choice. For Valeros, the closest is the ability to\
  \ increase his local combat help from +1d4 to +1d6, an average of a +1 increase\
  \ on every local combat roll. But his 4 hand size is brutally low, and should be\
  \ increased to 5 quickly—especially since providing help requires him to have cards\
  \ in his hand—so that’s another strong first choice. Finally, a Diplomacy scarcity\
  \ in the party might cause him to go in that direction. (The ability to avenge with\
  \ a recharge is perhaps the least compelling as a first power feat.)</p> \n    \
  \ <h3>The Power of Cycling</h3> \n     <p>Valeros isn’t one of the legendary cyclers\
  \ like Lem and Seoni, but in the Core Set, he can do a solid job of keeping his\
  \ cards flowing.</p> \n     <p><b><em>Cycle Your Deck</em></b>. Cycling your deck—\
  drawing new cards into your hand and putting old cards back into your draw pile—\
  is a particularly important aspect of the game. It ensures your hand doesn’t get\
  \ clogged with cards you don’t use and it digs through your deck to the good stuff.\
  \ Fortunately, Valeros has multiple ways to cycle. He can choose to either reload\
  \ or recharge armors or weapons to grant combat bonuses, so he should do so in a\
  \ way that spreads each type of card out over the entirety of his deck. Sometimes,\
  \ Valeros will want to provide a bonus in combat even when the odds are already\
  \ pretty good, just to clear his hand. And don’t forget about his power to recharge\
  \ at the end of the turn: though the best use is to recharge a card from Valeros’\
  s discard pile (providing a bit of healing), you can also recharge from Valeros’\
  s hand to help clear it, especially if he didn’t have a combat encounter on his\
  \ turn.</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <p><em>Clarification: Can you reload or recharge\
  \ a displayed armor? </em>No, because it’s not in your hand. Valeros’ end-of-the-turn\
  \ recharge power clearly says that the card has to be in his hand or discard. His\
  \ help-a-local power isn’t as specific, but the rules (see page 8) clarify this\
  \ situation: “If you are instructed to play, reveal, display, reload, discard, recharge,\
  \ bury, banish, or otherwise manipulate a card, that card must come from your hand\
  \ unless you are activating a power on a displayed card.” So, if you want to be\
  \ able to use one of Valeros’ armors to help someone out, don’t display it. (Usually,\
  \ this means you should display your armor just before you draw cards, to have it\
  \ available up to that minute.)</p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <h3>The Valeros Roles</h3>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Valeros’ two roles are clearly segregated: the Compatriot is all\
  \ about allies and the Drunken Avenger is all about Liquid boons. Choose the one\
  \ that suits your play and Valeros’ deck better—though if you’re playing the Core\
  \ Set that’s likely to be Compatriot just because of the paucity of Liquids in that\
  \ set.</em></p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p><em><b>Compatriot</b></em>.\
  \ This lets Valeros easily acquire allies and use them to fuel his powers. The ability\
  \ to acquire an ally that a local character missed is one of his best powers, and\
  \ almost always worth it, as you’re usually trading a so-so card for a go-again.\
  \ This role also makes Valeros’ shields better than ever. Generally, take this role\
  \ if you’ve collected shields or allies or if you’re focused on Valeros’ supportive\
  \ role.</p> \n     <p><em><b>Drunken Avenger</b></em>. Similarly, this role lets\
  \ Valeros easily acquire Liquids and use them to fuel his powers. That might be\
  \ a little weak currently just because of the limited number of Liquids in the <em>Core\
  \ Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>, but it’s a lot of fun. The\
  \ role also offers some powers to make Valeros’s avenging more powerful, plus what\
  \ may be the worst power in the game: one that forces Valeros to move randomly,\
  \ but lets him heal when he does so. Since most games are won or lost on character\
  \ positioning, this can be horrible—but somewhat resolvable if you also have Amiri\
  \ in your party. Generally, take this role if you’ve collected Liquids, if you’\
  ve focused on Valeros’s avenging role, or if you just want something that’s funny\
  \ and fun.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
