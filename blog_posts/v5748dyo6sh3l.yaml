  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Axel wasn’t his real name.\
  \ He’d wanted a name that echoed in the big top, and something that sounded good\
  \ in front of “Amazing Aviary.” So now he was Axel, of Axel’s Amazing Aviary, and\
  \ no one knew who he’d been before he came to the Circus of Wayward Wonders. He\
  \ was certain his new name would lead to his first real, actual performance.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Except it hadn’t.</p> \n     <p>The ringmaster and circus manager went\
  \ by the name “Thunder” and, like his namesake, he could silence the largest crowd,\
  \ rolling over them as they hung on his every word. He was like that in person as\
  \ well, pronouncing all his words deliberately and forcefully. Axel thought the\
  \ Thunder was the most intense, serious, forthright person he’d ever met. This made\
  \ it especially frustrating that Axel hadn’t been able to get a straight answer\
  \ from the man in five days. Would Axel be able to perform on opening night? Could\
  \ he practice in one of the three rings beneath the big top? Could he see the order\
  \ of the acts, to find out where his bird act would best fit? </p> \n     <p>Yes,\
  \ but also no, and also perhaps yes. </p> \n     <p>Soon. </p> \n     <p>Axel left\
  \ every discussion feeling that he’d finally received the ringmaster’s answers,\
  \ but as soon as the Thunder had moved on to talk to someone else, Axel realized\
  \ he hadn’t gotten any answers at all.</p> \n     <p>With little else to do, Axel\
  \ turned back to his doves. He’d set up a lightweight stand in a corner of the darkened\
  \ big top, out of the way of the genuine performers practicing their circus tricks.\
  \ He gave a low whistle, and one of the doves darted from its perch to take a wrapped\
  \ pebble from his hand, swooping around Axel’s head with it.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ James.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>“Is that <i>candy</i>?”</p> \n     <p>Axel\
  \ turned at the question, following the bird with his gaze as it swooped to drop\
  \ the pebble into the outstretched hand of a young girl wearing a tight white leotard.\
  \ She was no older than twelve—not much younger than Axel himself—but she held herself\
  \ with the confidence of one with two, three times that many years behind her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“No, sorry. It’s just a rock,” said Axel quickly. Then, as if the warning\
  \ were necessary, he added, “Please don’t eat it.” He quickly glanced over her shoulder\
  \ where her parents and two older siblings practiced their high-wire acrobatics\
  \ routine. They didn’t seem to notice him or his young friend.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ girl—Odvi Kanbali, Axel remembered—looked curiously at the prize that the dove\
  \ had delivered. “Why would you wrap a rock up to look like candy?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  It’ll be actual candy during a performance, but candy’s expensive to use during\
  \ training,” Axel explained. “I taught the doves to give them to children in the\
  \ audience.” </p> \n     <p>“I’m not in the audience,” Odvi huffed, “and I’m not\
  \ a child. I’m a performer. One of the Flying Kanbalis…although that was our name\
  \ back in Escadar. We’re the Feather-Fall Five now. Papa says it’s because we won’\
  t have to risk a hard fall ever again.”</p> \n     <p>“You were in Escadar?” Axel\
  \ asked enthusiastically, wholly forgetting to maintain his facade of jaded professionalism.\
  \ He saw Odvi’s face twist in a grimace and regretted sounding excited about it.\
  \ “Then you worked for… her,” Axel finished flatly.</p> \n     <p>“Mistress Dusklight,”\
  \ Odvi said slowly, nodding. The rest of her words came in a rush, as though they’\
  d been bottled up for a long time. “She’s beautiful and graceful, and she knows\
  \ more about the circus than even Professor K does, and he’s <i>ancient</i>. But\
  \ she’s really a monster! Her circus isn’t ‘The Delights of the Heavens,’ it’s a\
  \ prison. Or worse, an executioner’s block. Nobody in the audience realizes she\
  \ doesn’t care if her performers are hurt or worse, so long as she keeps up the\
  \ sparkly illusion she’s selling her crowds. I hated it. I hated <i>her</i>. Papa\
  \ always said we’d get away, and when a bunch of us decided to leave Dusklight’\
  s circus, we came here to start up our own. Wayward wonders, all of us. Now my family\
  \ never has to perform without a safety net. I think it’s very exciting—there are\
  \ lots of new people joining, too, and it feels like…I don’t know. Like the start\
  \ of something really <i>important</i>.”</p> \n     <p>Axel stepped toward her to\
  \ collect his bird and his wrapped pebble, wincing as his weight fell awkwardly\
  \ on his left foot.</p> \n     <p>Odvi frowned. “You’re hurt.” </p> \n     <p>“\
  I bumped my leg last night. I’m fine.”</p> \n     <p>“It’s a stake bite.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Axel looked over where Mistress Elizia, the snake charmer, was poking around\
  \ in the mouth of her enormous anaconda. “A snakebite?”</p> \n     <p>Odvi giggled.\
  \ “No, a stake bite. Circus talk. It comes from old stakes. We had to make do with\
  \ parts we could scavenge, and that meant used tent stakes. When stakes get pounded\
  \ into the dirt again and again, their tops eventually split. If you don’t step\
  \ carefully when outside the tent at night, their frayed tops can cut your leg.\
  \ Newcomers get stake bites all the time. Take off your shoe and I’ll wrap your\
  \ ankle. I learned a <i>lot</i> about wrapping injuries in Mistress Dusklight’s\
  \ circus.” The girl unwound one of her chalk-dusted handwraps to use as a makeshift\
  \ bandage.</p> \n     <p>As Axel bent to roll up his trouser leg, Odvi glanced at\
  \ his doves, clustered together on their perch. “Your bird rack is empty in the\
  \ middle.”</p> \n     <p>“That’s where I go,” explained Axel. “The harness doesn’\
  t stand on the ground like that during a performance. It goes over my shoulders,\
  \ and under my cloak. That’s how I hide the birds before unveiling them for their\
  \ tricks.”</p> \n     <p>“Your wire’s too thick,” interjected a flat-faced, simple-looking\
  \ boy walking by with a metal spar over one shoulder.</p> \n     <p>“Hod can…talk?”\
  \ gasped Odvi, surprised.</p> \n     <p>The boy scowled. “Don’t talk a lot. Doesn’\
  t mean I don’t talk.”</p> \n     <p>Odvi leaned in to Axel, whispering. “Hod’s the\
  \ assistant to the magician.”</p> \n     <p>Axel nodded. “I’ve seen her around.\
  \ Mordaine the Magician, right? Apparently, she’s really, really good.”</p> \n \
  \    <p>The acrobat rolled her eyes. “<i>Mordaine</i> says that Mordaine is really\
  \ good. And that we’re lucky to have her. And that she should be the big number\
  \ in the center ring on opening night. And so on. The Thunder isn’t so sure.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While Axel and Odvi spoke among themselves of his mistress, Hod set\
  \ down his spar and picked up Axel’s cloak. He turned it inside out with a careful\
  \ motion and pointed to several small tears. “Wire’s wrecking your lining. After\
  \ a show or two, it’ll tear and spoil the illusion. Use thinner wire. And loop the\
  \ ends.”</p> \n     <p>“Thanks, Hod,” Axel replied, genuinely grateful for the boy’\
  s advice. “I’m lucky you stopped by.” He paused, unsure whether to speak his next\
  \ thought aloud. “<i>Is</i> Mordaine all that she says?”</p> \n     <p>Hod considered,\
  \ his brow furrowing. Then his face split into a smile. “At least she has a good\
  \ assistant.”</p> \n     <p>Odvi laughed, slipping Axel’s shoe back on and helping\
  \ him to his feet. Hod’s face grew suddenly solemn and he picked up his spar. “\
  She told the Thunder that we already have a magician, and we already have animal\
  \ acts, so there’s no place for you.”</p> \n     <p>Axel was torn between shock\
  \ and outrage. “No place? How is it even her decision? She’s as new to this circus\
  \ as I am! I thought the Thunder ran this show.”</p> \n     <p>Hod grinned again,\
  \ “That’s what the Thunder told her. Said he was already considering a place for\
  \ you.”</p> \n     <p>“Oh, that’s good news,” interjected Odvi, “I’d heard he was\
  \ going to say no, because of how obvious it was that you’d never performed in front\
  \ of a crowd before. But I think you’ll fit in well. We were all novices once. Except\
  \ me. I’ve been on the high wire since before I can remember.”</p> \n     <p>“I’\
  d better get back to training, then.” Axel said, preparing to run through his trick\
  \ again. “I feel like this opening night is going to be the beginning of something\
  \ wonderful.”</p> \n     <p>“Yes,” the children said in unison before returning\
  \ to their own duties.</p> \n     <p>Hod turned back, smiling over his spar and\
  \ looking intently at Axel’s outstretched hand. “Is that candy?”</p> \n    </blockquote>\
