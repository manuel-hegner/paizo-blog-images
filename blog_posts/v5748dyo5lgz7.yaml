  \ meeting for June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures,\
  \ and my jaw still hasn't come up from the floor.</p> \n     <p>We reviewed 28 figures\
  \ today, including the breathtaking <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc5\">Gargantuan Red\
  \ Dragon</a> limited-edition \"case incentive\" figure, and I'm prepared to make\
  \ the prediction that this will be our best set yet.</p> \n     <p>I've already\
  \ extolled the virtues of WizKids's digital sculpting process for releases like\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set #1</em></a>, but this is\
  \ the first time we've been able to implement the process within the context of\
  \ a large set. All I can say, after handling and reviewing all those figures today,\
  \ is that the difference is palpable and significant. Not only has the process allowed\
  \ us tighter control during the sculpt approval phase, but it's also resulted in\
  \ generally better-looking, more detailed figures across the board. I am SO EXCITED\
  \ for this set I can't even handle it. I wanted to steal the paint masters and use\
  \ them in my own games immediately, but somehow made my saving throw against abject\
  \ greed.</p> \n     <p>Wow, wow, wow.</p> \n     <p>Let's start with the Frost Giant.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150123-FrostGiant.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150123-FrostGiant_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>To be totally honest, this is the figure I was most\
  \ worried about in this set. Conceptually, I love her. It's long been a personal\
  \ goal to produce a male and female of every major giant race in the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG, so the figure definitely hits the mark there. The original illustration—\
  and even to some extent the digital sculpt shown of above—always struck me as a\
  \ little top-heavy. I was, I must say, a little worried. Having just held the final\
  \ miniature in my hand, I can say that all of my concerns evaporated. Some of the\
  \ other members of our approval team (I won't name names, but it rhymes with Meesa\
  \ Shmeevins) audibly gasped as the figure hit the table. So, so awesome. The Frost\
  \ Giant is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \    <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150123-Gnoll.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150123-Gnoll_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>A few weeks back, I mentioned that <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> contains a creature type that we have not yet done in\
  \ previous <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets. I should\
  \ have said \"sub-type,\" really, but at last I can officially reveal that that\
  \ creature type is GNOLLS. Here we have the first in the set, the Gnoll Warrior.\
  \ I'm very, very happy with how this guy turned out. I'm also happy that he will\
  \ have several gnoll brothers and sisters elsewhere in the set. The Gnoll Warrior\
  \ is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150123-Sarcophagus.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150123-SarcophagusFull_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And because I am as giddy as a schoolgirl, I've decided\
  \ to go ahead and reveal my absolute favorite piece of dungeon dressing that will\
  \ be included in the set: the Sarcophagus. Oh. My. God, this thing is amazing. For\
  \ starters, we're looking at a three-piece figure, here. Sarcophagus, lid, and an\
  \ actual MUMMY that easily comes in and out of the tomb. Best of all, the mummy\
  \ has entirely flat feet, so you can easily use him as a genuine figure. Bonus!\
  \ There are six pieces of dungeon dressing in the set. They'll be randomly inserted\
  \ into eight boosters in every case (so <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">case subscribers</a>\
  \ can be sure to get a full set). Trust me, you do not want to miss this figure.\
  \ It is one of the most amazing miniatures we've produced so far!</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ lastly, before I leave you for this week, I'd like to make one more push for our\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Ongoing Case Subscription</a> service. We'll deliver\
  \ a factory-sealed case direct to you at a substantial discount over the full retail\
  \ price. The sub also comes with other benefits like an across-the-board discount\
  \ on singles and other Pathfinder Battles releases (like our forthcoming <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> sets). We've seen a nice, steady\
  \ increase in subscribers since the last set, but I'm hoping we can increase those\
  \ numbers significantly. Retailers are getting increasingly choosy with the large\
  \ number of prepainted fantasty miniatures on the market at the moment, and a healthy\
  \ number of subscribers is the best way to ensure the line's future by providing\
  \ a core group of customers who we can count on to support each release. If you\
  \ appreciate what we're doing with Pathfinder Battles and want to help us continue\
  \ well into the future, please consider \n      <link>setting up an Ongoing Case\
  \ Subscription today. It really is the best thing you can do to keep the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures goodness coming!</p> \n \
  \    <p>I'm on vacation (in Maui!) next Friday. I MAY pre-load a preview blog for\
  \ next week if I can carve out the time early next week. Otherwise, I'll see you\
  \ guys in February!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div>\
