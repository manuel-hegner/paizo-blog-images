  \ Weapon Special Features</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 27, 2011</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1118-Goblin.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Page 199 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> says,\
  \ “When you attempt to perform a combat maneuver, make an attack roll and add your\
  \ CMB in place of your normal attack bonus. Add any bonuses you currently have on\
  \ attack rolls due to spells, feats, and other effects. <i>These bonuses must be\
  \ applicable to the weapon or attack used to perform the maneuver</i>.” That last\
  \ sentence implies that some weapons apply their bonuses on combat maneuver checks,\
  \ and some do not. So how do you know which weapons do? The answer depends on what\
  \ kind of combat maneuver you’re attempting, and in some cases what kind of weapon\
  \ you’re using.</p> \n   <p><b>Disarm</b>, <b>sunder</b>, and <b>trip</b> are normally\
  \ the only kinds of combat maneuvers in which you’re actually using a weapon (natural\
  \ weapons and unarmed strikes are considered weapons for this purpose) to perform\
  \ the maneuver, and therefore the weapon’s bonuses (enhancement bonuses, feats such\
  \ as Weapon Focus, fighter weapon training, and so on) apply to the roll.</p> \n\
  \   <p>For other maneuvers, either you’re not using a weapon at all, or the weapon\
  \ is incidental to making the maneuver and its bonuses shouldn’t make you better\
  \ at attempting the maneuver. For example, just because you have a <i>+5 greatsword</i>\
  \ doesn’t mean it gives you a +5 bonus on dirty trick checks (<i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Advanced Player’s Guide</i> 320), and just because you have a <i>+5 dagger</i>\
  \ doesn’t mean it gives you a +5 bonus on grapple checks. Of course, the GM is free\
  \ to rule that in certain circumstances, a creature can apply weapon bonuses for\
  \ these maneuvers, such as when using a sap in a dirty trick maneuver to hit an\
  \ opponent in a sensitive spot.</p> \n   <p>There is a special exception to the\
  \ above rules. If you’re using a weapon with the trip special feature, and you’\
  re attempting a drag or reposition combat maneuver (<i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i>\
  \ 321–322), you may apply the weapon’s bonuses to the roll because trip weapons\
  \ are also suitable for dragging and repositioning (this also means we don’t have\
  \ to add “drag” and “reposition” weapon properties to existing weapons).</p> \n\
  \   <p>Additionally, the polearm master fighter archetype (<i>Advanced Player’s\
  \ Guide</i> 106) has an ability called sweeping fend that allows the fighter to\
  \ use any spear or polearm to make bull rush or trip maneuvers. For the bull rush,\
  \ this is a specific exception that overrides the general rule of “weapon bonuses\
  \ don’t apply on bull rushes.” For the trip, the text as written is redundant because\
  \ <i>anyone</i> can already use a weapon as part of a trip attempt, so giving the\
  \ polearm master this ability has no effect. This ability needs to be updated as\
  \ follows.</p> \n   <p><b>Update:</b> On page 106 of the Advanced Player’s Guide,\
  \ Polearm Master, Sweeping Fend ability, delete the second sentence. Replace the\
  \ first sentence with “At 13th level, a polearm master can use any spear or polearm\
  \ to make bull rush maneuvers, though he takes a –4 penalty on combat maneuver checks\
  \ when making such attempts. When using a spear or polearm to make a trip maneuver,\
  \ he treats these weapons as if they had the trip weapon feature.”</p> \n   <p>Sean\
