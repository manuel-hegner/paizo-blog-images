  description\">While co-managing an organized play campaign that touches upon nearly\
  \ everything that Paizo publishes in one way or another, Linda and I spend a lot\
  \ of our off-time reading, catching up on the latest publications, and thinking\
  \ about how to incorporate them in the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. Today, we bring you more sanctioned content for\
  \ your enjoyment both at and away from the gaming table!</p> \n    <p>One of my\
  \ favorite projects is sanctioning the <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder\
  \ Tales</a> novels, which continue to impress me with the authors' insight into\
  \ our shared campaign setting, fun characters, and subtle incorporation of game\
  \ mechanics into the narratives. This latest round of reading began with Michael\
  \ A. Stackpole's <a href=\"/products/btpy8xth\"><em>The Crusader Road</em></a>,\
  \ a story of frontier survival in the River Kingdoms, and concluded with Tim Pratt's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9ckd\"><em>Liar's Island</em></a>, a tale of mischief,\
  \ humor, and opportunistic heroism in Jalmeray. If you're a fan of the Darklands—\
  especially if you enjoyed the recently released <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6s\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Blood of Shadows</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9j72\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Darklands Revisited</em></a>—you'll love <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9dz2\"><em>Forge of Ashes</em></a> by Paizo's own Josh Vogt, who shows\
  \ us how cool an oread can be and how delightfully bizarre the Darklands' residents\
  \ are. Check out both Pathfinder Tales, Volume VI and Pathfinder Tales, Volume VII\
  \ for all eight of the newest sanctioned novels.</p> \n    <p>On a related note,\
  \ remember that <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/mt/Pathfinder\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Audible</a> now produces audiobook versions of the Pathfinder Tales novels, letting\
  \ you experience the stories wherever you go. Our partnership with TOR also means\
  \ that these novels are available in ebook form through a variety of online retailers.\
  \ In light of the new digital formats available, showing a GM the audiobook or ebook\
  \ file on your phone, laptop, or even printed out screenshot now qualifies for activating\
  \ any of the Pathfinder Tales boons.</p> \n    <p>But that's not all! Linda has\
  \ also composed the sanctioning document for <a href=\"/products/btpy9au7\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Module: Daughters of Fury</em></a>, opening up new adventure content for character\
  \ levels 2-6. As with many of our sanctioned 64-page modules, this adventure is\
  \ broken into three chapters, each with its own Chronicle sheet. Play the whole\
  \ adventure with the same character to qualify for a bonus Chronicle sheet at the\
  \ end, helping to either boost your PC's Prestige Point total or gain additional\
  \ experience points and wealth.</p> \n    <p>You can download all of the sanctioning\
  \ document files from their respective product pages. These documents will be added\
  \ to the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\">Additional Resources\
  \ page</a> next week, along with the rest of the monthly update.</p> \n    <p>We're\
  \ busily looking ahead to other sanctioned content in the Module, Adventure Path,\
  \ and Tales lines, so don't worry if you don't see the next publication's Chronicle\
  \ sheets here; they're in the pipeline. We'll see you next week for a preview of\
  \ March's new scenarios.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Lead\
