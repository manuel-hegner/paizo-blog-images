  \ Launched on Kickstarter\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n  \
  \    </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Hail and well-met Pathfinders! I’m Alan Miranda,\
  \ CEO of Ossian Studios, and I am excited to introduce you to our new Paizo-licensed\
  \ RPG video game, <em>Pathfinder: The Dragon’s Demand</em>. Over a year in the making,\
  \ it’s a single-player, turn-based game that features deep character customization,\
  \ a faithful adaptation of the remastered Pathfinder Second Edition Core rules,\
  \ and an enhanced tabletop minis-style play. It's all about miniatures in a tabletop-style\
  \ world—the world of Pathfinder!</p>\n      <p>Playing tabletop many years ago made\
  \ a huge impact on me. It was the most exciting time I’d ever had with a game, like\
  \ a fantasy book coming alive from my own choices and dice rolls. It felt magical.\
  \ It’s those memories that inspired me to work at BioWare as a producer on the <em>Baldur’\
  s Gate</em> and <em>Neverwinter Nights</em> games. And that’s when I realized I\
  \ was always trying to recreate that same pen-and-paper magic in the RPGs I worked\
  \ on.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/09a523a2-e1a2-4cb8-9104-473a77e67dce/PF_TheDragonsDemand_ExplodingZombies.gif\"\

  ></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n   \
  \   <p>So that’s what we’re doing with <em>The Dragon’s Demand</em>: going back\
  \ to our tabletop roots to recreate that magic in a single-player, turn-based video\
  \ game, with miniatures. It looks like a beautiful tabletop diorama but does all\
  \ the things that aren’t possible to show on a physical tabletop, so it’s like an\
  \ “enhanced tabletop.” And it uses a faithful adaptation of Pathfinder’s Second\
  \ Edition rules for players to interact with the world in some very refreshing ways.</p>\n\
  \      <p>We’ve been building a prototype of this enhanced tabletop game for over\
  \ a year. That includes nailing down the right art style on a solid technical framework,\
  \ as well as integrating the remastered ruleset in an ongoing process.</p>\n   \

  ></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>So, what are some of the cool things you’\
  ll see in <em>The Dragon’s Demand</em>? Well, when it comes to miniatures, we have\
  \ adaptive poses based on actions, including grab poses, dynamic body postures for\
  \ different inclines, but most importantly, a 3D grid system. Instead of grid squares,\
  \ we’ll be using grid cubes, which give characters the incredible freedom of movement\
  \ to climb ropes, walls, and trees, levitate, fly, swim deep underwater, and more.</p>\n\
  \      <p>And our environments will have dynamic weather that impacts the world,\
  \ visual effects that obscure visibility, and a ton of skill-based environmental\
  \ interactions like taking cover and sneaking, squeezing through really tight spots,\
  \ throwing your own ropes to climb, and forcing open doors and windows with a crowbar.</p>\n\

  \   </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The CRPG will be based on 2013’s Pathfinder adventure<em>\
  \ The Dragon's Demand</em>, a Pathfinder First Edition dungeon and wilderness adventure\
  \ for 1<sup>st</sup> level characters. Written by Mike Shel, it delves into the\
  \ Dark Tapestry—the darkness between the stars where powerful entities and madness\
  \ lurk. We’ll be expanding that adventure with new areas to explore, lots of intriguing\
  \ side quests, and a brand new, personal story for player characters that delves\
  \ into the darkness of the Dark Tapestry.</p>\n      <p>The return of a legendary\
  \ dragon long vanquished sees the town of Belhaim once again under dire threat.\
  \ The game will present a huge, interactive world to explore, with hundreds of characters\
  \ and dozens of quests that react to the player’s choices. A cast of colorful companions,\
  \ including iconic characters such as the goblin alchemist Fumbus, will be on hand\
  \ to join the player’s party, each featuring their own motivations and backstory.</p>\n\
