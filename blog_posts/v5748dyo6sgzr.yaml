  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Since sanctioning <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0q?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone\"\
  ><i>Fall of Plaguestone</i></a>, the team received feedback from the community.\
  \ Reading the commentary made us realize we hadn’t communicated the basis of our\
  \ sanctioning process and that doing so would clarify some of the issues. So here\
  \ goes!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/102219_FallOfPlaguestoneSanctioning.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Cover art from the 'Fall of Plaguestone' adventure: Ezren and Amiri, the\
  \ Pathfinder iconic wizard and barbarian, face off against a pack of snarling wolves.\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>A key principle of sanctioning involves the relationship\
  \ of Society to Paizo product lines. We wish to support all products, but at a level\
  \ that makes sense to the ongoing Pathfinder Society campaign. Our goal is to get\
  \ 95%+ of materials into the hands of players. This includes sanctioning the Lost\
  \ Omens line (more on that in a minute) as well as other upcoming rules supplements.\
  \ For modules and adventure paths, we wish to encourage players to try them out\
  \ or play them as home games. Depending on the scope and content of the adventure,\
  \ they may not fit well within the organized play environment. As a thank you for\
  \ trying out other Paizo products, we’ve created chronicles that do fit within the\
  \ campaign and may be applied to your Pathfinder Society character.</p> \n     <p>Just\
  \ as certain adventures don’t necessarily fit well within the organized play environment,\
  \ static rewards don’t work well for sanctioning non-Society content. We decided\
  \ not to utilize the previous one size fits all model and its blanket statements\
  \ that modules get X and adventure paths earn Y. Instead, we use a sliding scale\
  \ of rewards, looking at the estimated play time/length of the adventure and comparing\
  \ it to known quantities such as scenarios and quests. Using a flexible scale allows\
  \ us to act on feedback received on current sanctioned adventures and explore what\
  \ options a new edition of Pathfinder supports.</p> \n     <p>In summary, Fall of\
  \ Plaguestone is the first module sanctioned. We continue to listen to feedback\
  \ and will evolve the process over time to support both Paizo products and the Organized\
  \ Play program.</p> \n     <p>For Lost Omens sanctioning, we have completed our\
  \ pass on the World Guide and hope to post it to the Character Options section of\
  \ the Guide to Play in the next few weeks. We are currently working on the Character\
  \ Guide and estimate that it will follow shortly. We queued the Age of Ashes adventure\
  \ path for the next available sanctioning timeslot.</p> \n     <h2>Starfinder Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>With convention season and then a vacancy on the organized play team,\
  \ we fell behind on sanctioning content for Starfinder Society. Catching up is on\
  \ the team’s radar and is next in line behind getting scenarios ready, but we are\
  \ hampered by being a developer short. Will update more as we have news.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>Achievement Points</h2> \n     <p>We built the Playtest Point (PtP) system,\
  \ and then used it as the framework to build the Achievement Point (AcP) program.\
  \ Building a new program came with many hurdles. Unfortunately, we fell down at\
  \ the beginning of the track and that led to delays in the project. As many of you\
  \ noted, the cost of PtP wasn’t behaving the way the boons listed, resulting in\
  \ hurdle one. Attaching a customized pdf copy of the boon, instead of just an online\
  \ list, resulted in hurdle two. PtP awarded automatically, based on the number of\
  \ Pathfinder Playtest scenarios reported for a player/GM. With the tiered structure\
  \ of AcP, we needed new tools for organizers/GMs. The implementation came with a\
  \ bit of an issue, so there is hurdle three. Determining the reward chart, while\
  \ down a developer and in the middle of edition transfer, was hurdle four. Getting\
  \ the rewards built in our system was hurdle five. There have been others, but those\
  \ are the key roadblocks encountered in our process.</p> \n     <p>The positive\
  \ news is we’ve passed many of these hurdles. We reconfigured the calculation codes\
  \ for PtP purchases and how to designate premier events. These need review by quality\
  \ assurance before we can roll them out. We have the boons ready for hurdle two,\
  \ and I’m in contact with our tech developer to get them attached to user accounts\
  \ when purchased. Our awesome developers finished the reward chart and made the\
  \ boons, which passes hurdle four. By the time you read this, we should have input\
  \ the chart into the system, removing hurdle five.</p> \n     <p>It is our intention\
  \ that we have resolutions for all hurdles in place in the next month. By releasing\
  \ the chart early, players can plan what purchases they want to make when the project\
  \ goes online. We wish that we wouldn’t have encountered so many issues and that\
  \ AcP would have rolled at launch, but we would rather take a few extra weeks than\
  \ rush this out the door and have issues in perpetuity.</p> \n     <h2>Nova/Glyph\
  \ implementation</h2> \n     <p>We found some limitations in our current site display\
  \ that keeps the stars/novas/glyphs from displaying correctly. We’ve filed a tech\
  \ support request for this issue, but have it prioritized behind getting AcP out\
  \ the gate. The update that fixes premier events also should fix evaluation game\
  \ recording so Venture-Captains will have a means to enter results that is not sending\
  \ emails to the organized play inbox.</p> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society/Starfinder\
  \ Society Webpages</h2> \n     <p>We know these haven’t seen an update in some time.\
  \ The departure of Robot led to a vacancy and without someone to update those pages,\
  \ we are left in a holding pattern. We hope to have more updates soon.</p> \n  \
  \   <h2>Pathfinder Society Guide to Play</h2> \n     <p>The team working on this\
  \ project have the wiki version made in a test environment so that they can put\
  \ it through its paces and ensure its functionality before revealing it to the public.\
  \ The organized play team currently has a list of questions we need to resolve and\
  \ get the answers to them. As we are approaching full development strength, having\
  \ filled the vacancy that came with John’s departure, we have capacity to do more\
  \ than produce the monthly scenario/quest quota and hope to catch up on this very\
  \ soon.</p> \n     <p>We appreciate our community’s appetite for all things organized\
  \ play! Ensuring scenarios publish on time is our number one priority. The organized\
  \ play team works to capacity with a goal of delivering the best program possible.\
  \ We welcome your understanding as we work towards reducing the backlog of tasks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I’ve pulled back the curtain a bit. I hope it helps our community and\
  \ that we can continue the tradition of awesome Organized Play.</p> \n     <p>Tune\
  \ in next week for the first of the month Spotlights, Cons, and Bits blog.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Until then, Explore-Report-Cooperate!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p\
