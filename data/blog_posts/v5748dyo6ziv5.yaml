  \      <p>Hi! I’m Jenny, Starfinder’s Creative Manager, which means I’m the captain\
  \ of this starship. I’m one part creative director, leading the creative vision\
  \ for Starfinder as a game and brand; one part manager, coordinating the efforts\
  \ of the badass crew of designers and developers who call ourselves the StarFriends;\
  \ and one part developer, concepting, creating, outlining, and writing content for\
  \ Starfinder, plus upgrading work done by talented freelance contributors.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p>I’ve written a ton of adventures for various tabletop games over the years,\
  \ and I’ve contributed to many Paizo books, but we’re not here to tally my credits.\
  \ I’m really proud of my latest long-form adventures, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq047uk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday\"\
  >A Cosmic Birthday</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq09jzk\">Murder\
  \ in Metal City</a>, and I can’t wait for you to get a taste of my (our!) setting\
  \ work in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0aipb?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide\"\
  >Galaxy Guide</a>. You can reach me at <a href=\"mailto:jenny.jarzabski@paizo.com\"\
  >jenny.jarzabski@paizo.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>But now it’s time to introduce\
  \ you to the fantastic team helping me bring the galaxy of Desna’s Path to life.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3><strong>Jessica Catalan<br>\n        Senior Developer</strong></h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hello everyone! I’m Jessica Catalan (she/her), senior developer on the\
  \ Starfinder Team and head of the Starfinder Society. This month we’re releasing\
  \ the final Starfinder Society Scenario for first edition, and in a few short months,\
  \ we’re launching a brand-new program for Starfinder Society second edition! I hope\
  \ you join us as we bring first edition to a close and embark on this exciting new\
  \ adventure into the future!</p>\n      <p>In addition to working at Paizo full\
  \ time, I’m a frequent freelance author for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs,\
  \ with over 50 writing credits for Paizo, and many more for other companies and\
  \ games.</p>\n      <p>I’m Metis and I live in wonderful Winnipeg, Canada. I spend\
  \ my free time with my family: my husband, daughter, son, and pet rabbit. I love\
  \ to play TTRPGs, TCGs, and board games, collect far too many sets of dice, and\
  \ read. (Yes, of course I’ll read all those books on the shelf one day, and yes,\
  \ I definitely need more…).</p>\n      <p>You can find me on most social media and\
  \ Discords as d20diaries. If you’re interested in writing a Starfinder Society Scenario,\
  \ reach out to me at jessica.catalan@paizo.com.</p>\n      <p>All the best, folks!\
  \ Take care of each other out there.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3><strong>Mike Kimmel<br>\n\
  \        Senior Developer</strong></h3>\n      <p>Hello! I’m Mike Kimmel (he/him),\
  \ Senior Developer for Starfinder Second Edition. You may recognize me from my prior\
  \ work as an Organized Play Line Developer for Pathfinder Society, from my freelance\
  \ contributions to Pathfinder and Starfinder, or as the founder of the Freelance\
  \ Forge forum community. I’m a proud father, former educator, and author of many\
  \ adventures. Since joining the Starfinder team in 2023, I’ve been hard at work\
  \ on our core rulebooks, creating playtest adventures, items, classes, spells, new\
  \ rules, lots of aliens, and all the other things a science-fantasy game might need.\
  \ I’ve also taken the lead on some exciting adventure content that we’ve got planned\
  \ for the new edition. I’m sure you’re already looking forward to the release of\
  \ our premium box set module, Murder in Metal City, as well as our Free RPG Day\
  \ adventure, Battle for Nova Rush—I know I am. If possible, I’m even more excited\
  \ about the other adventures I’m working on, but I’m not allowed to say much on\
  \ that front yet. We’ll have to keep it a secret… for now.</p>\n      <br>\n   \
  \   <h3><strong>Dustin Knight <br>\n        Designer</strong></h3>\n      <p><br>\n\
  \       Greetings Starfinders! I’m Dustin Knight, Starfinder designer! I’ve always\
  \ wanted to be a tabletop game designer, so being able to announce that I’m now\
  \ officially one is literally a dream come true! That said, in the process of becoming\
  \ one I’ve learned the only real requisite is designing a game, so I do fervently\
  \ implore anyone reading this who wants to pursue the same career path to start\
  \ writing now! Wait, let’s read the rest of the blog first! Then make some tea.\
  \ Then go write.</p>\n      <p>My career really took off with Organized Play. You\
  \ may have played my first game, <em>Wayfinder Origins</em>, a repeatable scenario\
  \ that opens with a boat. Or <em>Sundered Waves</em>, a repeatable scenario that\
  \ opens with a boat. I’m still writing the occasional adventure, like <em>Wheel\
  \ of Monsters</em>, a repeatable scenario that opens with a boat. But my specialty\
  \ and focus lie in player-facing mechanics like ancestries, backgrounds, and classes.\
  \ I love the back and forth conversation between mechanics and lore in a class and\
  \ level driven game that both inspires and develops multifaceted characters and\
  \ adventures to create these immersive moments between friends where we play out\
  \ these fantastic stories. Please feel free to tell me about your characters and\
  \ the incredible moments, because those memories are worth more than anything I\
  \ can graph out in excel.<br><br>\n       Outside of work I’m often described as\
  \ exactly the kind of nerd you’d expect with my job title. I spend my free time\
  \ sorting tens of thousands of Magic cards into grossly organized binders. I play\
  \ TCGs online using official apps and Discord. I watch at least five or six new\
  \ anime a season, on top of trying to tackle my ever-growing watch list. And I love\
  \ to cook, with my favorite dish still being okonomiyaki. My world travels and conventions\
  \ have been on hiatus for the past five years, but I’m looking forward to hanging\
  \ out virtually with everyone during PaizoCon and Gen Con. I’m in an ongoing Starfinder\
  \ campaign and working to restart my personal Pathfinder campaign. And realizing\
  \ with each sentence I’m inching closer and closer to talking about Paizo again!</p>\n\
  \      <p>You can catch me on any number of social media platforms as Dustin Knight\
  \ or kitsunewarlock, including Discord and Bluesky. You can also email me at <a\
  \ href=\"mailto:dustin.knight@paizo.com\">dustin.knight@paizo.com</a>. Thank you\
  \ all for continuing to play our game, and I wish you all love and peace.</p>\n\
  \      <p>And last but not least, allow me to introduce our newest StarFriend!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Aras Yazgan (he/him)<br>\n       Designer</h3>\n      <p>Hello\
  \ everyone! I’m Aras Yazgan, a Turkish-American game designer by vocation, computer\
  \ engineer by training, artist by dedication, and forever GM by choice. Gosh, there’\
  s an awful lot of you reading this, huh…? I think I might have page fright! I haven’\
  t had the chance to publish much of anything thus far, but I’ve been working on\
  \ little else other than TTRPG design for the last two years. My training arc is\
  \ over and I’m ready to show off the results!</p>\n      <p>It’s difficult to express\
  \ how excited I am to be working with the incredible Starfinder team. We’ve got\
  \ some tantalizing projects in the pipeline that I can’t wait to get my mitts on…\
  !</p>\n      <p>You can find my art on Cara @Sketching101. You can reach me at aras.yazgan@paizo.com!</p>\n\
  \      <p>From all of us, thanks again for playing Starfinder. We can’t wait to\
  \ hear about all your adventures in spaaaaaaaaace!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
