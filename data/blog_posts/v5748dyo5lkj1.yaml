  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">By now, you've had a look at the rules governing\
  \ the Starfinder universe in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>. Perhaps you've created a character or two\
  \ and played in a few sessions of the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/deadSuns\"\
  >Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>! You've also gotten a glimpse of many of the weird\
  \ and wonderful beings found in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>. But, in my opinion, an RPG really begins\
  \ to blossom with an exciting and vibrant campaign setting. Luckily, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds\"><em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em></a>\
  \ is right around the corner!</p> \n     <p>The Pact Worlds is a unified coalition\
  \ of worlds within the same star system who have banded together for mutual protection\
  \ against larger threats. These 14 worlds and celestial bodies are the heart of\
  \ the Starfinder campaign setting, providing a home base (or several home bases)\
  \ for starship crews and other groups to blast off for adventures among the distant\
  \ stars. But that doesn't mean the Pact Worlds are safe and boring. Far from it!\
  \ Intrigue and danger abound in the varied environments and settlements. In fact,\
  \ the planets of the Pact Worlds boast everything from sun-blasted deserts to frozen\
  \ mountaintops and from massive space stations to untamed jungles.</p> \n     <p>Chapter\
  \ One of <em>Pact Worlds</em> details these planets and celestial bodies, providing\
  \ descriptions of the geography, residents, society, and political landscape, as\
  \ well as an extensive list of notable locations. In addition, each entry is accompanied\
  \ by a full-page map of the entire world—or, in some cases, a map of the most important\
  \ area. Finally, a new theme inspired by that world rounds out the section.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Let's take a look at a few highlights of the book.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ chapter begins with a description of what is arguably the most important celestial\
  \ body in the system: the Sun. Though it may seem to be just a burning mass of incandescent\
  \ plasma that provides heat and light to all other worlds, it is so much more. A\
  \ strange settlement actually exists floating inside this churning furnace. Discovered\
  \ by worshipers of the sun goddess Sarenrae over a century ago, this collection\
  \ of force bubbles of various sizes—dubbed the Burning Archipelago by its first\
  \ pioneers—now houses a sizeable population. Corporations harnessing the ambient\
  \ radiation, Xenowardens tending a series of lush gardens, solarian monasteries,\
  \ a marketplace staffed by efreet and other denizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire,\
  \ and a huge metal cathedral to the Dawnflower all exist in close proximity in this\
  \ diverse metropolis.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-TheSun.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-TheSun_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>From the heat of the sun, we turn to the wandering planet\
  \ of Triaxus, which is currently in the throes of one of its centuries-long winters.\
  \ The planet's eccentric orbit around the sun stretches out its more extreme seasons,\
  \ but life has adapted to these climates, with some flora and fauna hibernating\
  \ until their time to thrive draws close once again. Triaxus's two largest landmasses\
  \ are home to the planet's main species: dragons, dragonkin, and ryphorians. These\
  \ ancient cultures warred in the time before the Gap, clashing mainly on the bridge\
  \ of land between the two continents, but are now in a state of peace. Some individual\
  \ realms within these areas—the Allied Territories and the Drakelands—still look\
  \ outward with expansionistic eyes. One such domain is Dretchnyl, run by the powerful\
  \ green dragon Dretchnyliax, who recently emerged from hiding after being attacked\
  \ by a contingent of good-aligned metallic dragons. She is now more machine than\
  \ flesh-and-bone dragon, bristling with cybernetic augmentations and gun-bearing\
  \ prosthetics.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Triaxus.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Triaxus_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>While dragons and ryphorians have existed in the Pact\
  \ Worlds system since before the system garnered that name, some denizens are slightly\
  \ more recent emigrates. The kasathas of the generation ship the Idari are such\
  \ a civilization, having fled their dying home planet on a slow migration centuries\
  \ ago. The kasathas bring facets of their own culture to the melting pot of the\
  \ Pact Worlds, as represented by the tempered pilgrim theme. In their adolescence,\
  \ kasathas undertake a yearlong walkabout known as the Tempering, in which they\
  \ are encouraged to experience as much as possible. Some members of other races\
  \ have adopted this practice as well, and they are represented with the tempered\
  \ pilgrim theme. They have extended the philosophy to their everyday lives, and\
  \ learn about new cultures very easily and can draw on the diverse array of experiences\
  \ they have already had. They consider themselves students of the universe, always\
  \ ready to learn more.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Idari.jpg\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Idari_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Like any other spacefarer, these tempered pilgrims\
  \ need a way to get from planet to planet or from star system to star system. Pact\
  \ Worlds includes a handful of new starship options and example starships, focusing\
  \ on groups such as the Hellknights and the Xenowardens. The most impressive of\
  \ these vessels is the Iomedaean Cathedralship, a gargantuan carrier designed to\
  \ look a soaring marble edifice. The Cathedralships come complete with soaring buttresses\
  \ and artificial stained glass windows. The sight of such a ship usually evokes\
  \ pride in the faithful and fear in the hearts of their enemies.</p> \n     <div\

  \ Worlds</em>! Stay tuned for more preview blogs in the coming weeks!</p> \n   \
