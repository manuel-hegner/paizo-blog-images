  ><p>We've finally revealed all 55 figures in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures. It seems like only a few\
  \ short months ago that we raised the sails on the first reveal and set out upon\
  \ the open seas, and yet here we are at our final destination, with the set's formal\
  \ release at Gen Con Indy less than two weeks away. Time really does fly when you're\
  \ keelhauling scallywags!</p></span> \n     <p>Before we move on to showing off\
  \ figures from our exciting NEXT set, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of\
  \ Golarion</a>, I want to take one more quick tour of some of cool bits from <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> to put it all into perspective.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>First up, let's take a closer look at the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xrp\"\
  >Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a> limited-edition case incentive figure. Customers\
  \ who subscribe or preorder a case get the right to purchase this very rare sculpture\
  \ at a rate of one per case ordered. Here he is in all his treacherous glory.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71157_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71157_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy8xrp\">Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a>\
  \ cuts an imposing figure on the tabletop. Here's a close-up to get a nice view\
  \ of some of the sculpt's details.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \  <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71157-CloseUp_500.jpeg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71157-CloseUp_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71157-Fight.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71157-Fight_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And for size comparison purposes, I decided\
  \ to pit the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xrp\">Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a> against\
  \ our iconic heroes Valeros, Seoni, and Kyra. I'm glad they brought the cleric along,\
  \ because they could use a good prayer right now.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71155-Grindylows.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71155-Grindylows_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>One of my favorite things about building the set\
  \ lists for Pathfinder Battles is when I get a chance to do affiliated sculpts in\
  \ batches. Above we see the set's three grindylow figures. From left to right they\
  \ are the Brinebrood Queen, the Whale, and the standard Grindylow. The first two\
  \ are rare, and the last is common, meaning that folks who pick up a case should\
  \ get one of each rare and a small handful of Grindylows to bulk up their undersea\
  \ encounters.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71155-SeaDevils.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71155-SeaDevils_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Speaking of bulk, get a load of The Matron, the\
  \ rare leader of the Sea Devil “faction” in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</a> set. As both the Sea Devil and Sea Devil Champion are commons,\
  \ case buyers can expect to get a good number of each. I think they look great together,\
  \ and are a good starting point for any Sea Devil-themed encounter or adventure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71155-Trolls.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71155-Trolls_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I've said it before in this space, but getting the\
  \ scaling right on these creatures is probably the most difficult aspect of producing\
  \ miniatures, especially when like creatures are spread out over several sets. Nowhere\
  \ has this been more apparent than with trolls. Our very first Troll, from the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> set, came out quite small,\
  \ and didn't quite cut the imposing figure we were hoping for. With the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set, we swung the pendulum far in the other\
  \ direction with the incredibly imposing Troll Champion, who towers over most of\
  \ the true giants we've released in the line so far. That's all well and good for\
  \ a champion, after all, but it didn't really solve the sweet spot of the average\
  \ height of the average troll. For that, we've got the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set's Sea Troll, pictured in the middle here, which is\
  \ a good representation of an “average sized” troll. Expect future rank-and-file\
  \ trolls in upcoming sets to fall closer to the Sea Troll in size than the other\
  \ two, who are outliers.</p> \n     <p>That's it for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set! Looking over the full set here on my desk, I'm enormously\
  \ proud of the work we and our partners at WizKids put into these wonderful figures.\
  \ The set gave us a chance to fill in some gaps that have never been produced in\
  \ prepainted plastic, which is something we will continue as the line moves forward.\
  \ I'd also like to thank YOU, the Pathfinder Battles faithful. Your suggestions,\
  \ criticisms, and requests help to guide the decisions we make on these figures\
  \ every day. If you think our miniatures are cool, there's a good chance you or\
  \ a gamer just like you is responsible for their awesomeness just as much as those\
  \ of us who work on them every day. We couldn't do it without you!</p> \n     <p>There's\
  \ still time to set up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Ongoing Case Subscription</a>\
  \ to make sure you don't miss a single figure! Make sure to put your name on the\
  \ crew list for <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> before we\
  \ unfurl the sails and leave port, potentially never to return!</p> \n     <p>See\
  \ you next week for some brand new <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>\
  \ reveals!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> Publisher</p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote>\
