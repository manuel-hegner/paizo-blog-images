  \    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 19, 2008</p> \n    <p>Gen Con was a great\
  \ success! We saw nearly 400 characters made for Pathfinder Society and handed out\
  \ 600 registration cards for new players and Game Masters. Our fine volunteers rocked\
  \ the Pathfinder Society room in ICC 101-102 and all of the players were enthusiastic,\
  \ excited, and fun. The room was filled with laughter, chaos, and the roar of critical\
  \ successes. Nick and I had a good time and everyone's positive and negative feedback\
  \ was heard, written down, and (in many cases) will be incorporated in the next\
  \ version of the guide. Season 0 is our playtest seasonâ€”we're happy folks are helping\
  \ us test it.</p> \n    <p>We learned a few lessons at Gen Con, both from the organization\
  \ standpoint and from the standpoint of GMs and players. We know a little more about\
  \ how to organize the event, how many tickets to sell for each slot, and how many\
  \ GMs to gather to run it smoothly. We learned that a bull horn (thank you, Lou)\
  \ is the most valuable asset of the room and we learned that people really DO want\
  \ to sport the colors of their faction and wear their shirts with pride (and free\
  \ re-rolls).</p> \n    <p>Thanks everyone who was there for making it a great success.\
  \ We'll see you next year. Until then, found your local chapter of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society and hook another bunch of recruits into becoming Pathfinders. We know\
  \ they'll love it.</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost<br> Director of Marketing</p> \n\
