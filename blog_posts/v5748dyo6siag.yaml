  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This morning,\
  \ at the annual GAMA EXPO game industry trade show, Paizo publisher Erik Mona unveiled\
  \ the sketches of the just-announced <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> and <em>Pathfinder\
  \ GM Core</em> hardcovers to hobby game retailers and distributors. We will update\
  \ the product pages for the new books when the final full-color pieces arrive in\
  \ the coming weeks, but Pathfinder cover artist Wayne Reynolds’s illustrations have\
  \ us so excited we couldn’t wait to show them off to you in all their glory. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Receiving a new cover sketch from Wayne is one of the true highlights\
  \ of life behind the scenes at Paizo. Whenever they arrive, the creative staff gathers\
  \ around to marvel at their beauty and pick out all the fun little details Wayne\
  \ always adds above and beyond the simple descriptions we provide him. Wayne Reynolds\
  \ has been one of the most important contributors to Pathfinder since the very beginning,\
  \ and it’s a pity that his pencil sketches are not often seen outside the building.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So, we decided to change that this time around—not just by showing off\
  \ his sketches here on the blog, but also on your own game tables.</p> \n     <div\

  \     <br> \n     <p>For the first time, we’re bringing Wayne’s sketches to your\
  \ game table with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6siae?Pathfinder-Second-Edition-Remaster-Project\"\
  >Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster Project</a>. This November, in addition to the\
  \ standard fully painted covers for the <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> and <em>Pathfinder\
  \ GM Core</em>, we’ll also be offering unique Sketch Cover editions of the rulebooks,\
  \ only with a catch.</p> \n     <p>For the first four months of their release, Pathfinder\
  \ Sketch Cover versions of the new core rulebooks will be available EXCLUSIVELY\
  \ at hobby retailers worldwide. We will not be offering these editions to online\
  \ or bookstore retailers, ever! We also do not intend to reprint these editions\
  \ beyond our modest initial print run. We’ll retain a small number to sell on paizo.com\
  \ after the 120-day exclusivity period for folks who do not have access to a local\
  \ game store, but these special editions are intended to support our local game\
  \ store partners who have been such a big part of Pathfinder’s success since the\
  \ very beginning. We urge you to communicate your interest in these special books\
  \ to your local store, so that they can be sure to stock appropriately. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Lastly, take another look at those cover sketches. Each debuts a brand\
  \ new type of official Pathfinder dragon that will appear in March 2024’s <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Monster Core</em>. Wayne developed the dragons from concept art by Paizo’s very\
  \ own in-house concept artist, Kent Hamilton.</p> \n     <p>Very soon, we’ll return\
  \ here to show off some of Kent’s preliminary dragon concept designs and learn a\
  \ bit more about Pathfinder’s new core dragons!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div>\
