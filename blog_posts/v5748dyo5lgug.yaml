  ></a></i><a href=\"/products/btpy9aon\">Pirate's Promise<i></i></a><i>, Torius Vin\
  \ is perfectly happy with his life as a pirate captain, sailing the Inner Sea with\
  \ a bold crew of buccaneers and Celeste, his snake-bodied navigator and one true\
  \ love. Yet all that changes when his sometimes-friend Vreva Jhafae—a high-powered\
  \ courtesan and abolitionist spy in the slaver stronghold of Okeno—draws him into\
  \ her shadowy network of secret agents. Caught between the slavers he hates and\
  \ a navy that sees him as a criminal, can Torius continue to choose the path of\
  \ piracy? Or will he sign on as a privateer, bringing freedom to others—at the price\
  \ of his own?</i></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>Chapter One: Auspicious Arrivals</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Raucous laughter shook every cup and tankard in the bar. Windy Kate\
  \ wiped ale from her chin and handed over a silver coin, having just lost a bet\
  \ that she could drink a tankard without touching it with her hands or spilling\
  \ any. Torius Vin leaned comfortably against the bar, close enough for a good view,\
  \ but far enough to avoid getting wet.</p> \n      <p>\"They're a noisy lot.\" The\
  \ barkeep scowled as he refilled Torius's glass.</p> \n      <p>\"Just a little\
  \ well-deserved celebration.\" Torius sipped the fine spiced rum. The barkeep might\
  \ not like <i>Stargazer</i>'s boisterous crew, but he couldn't complain about the\
  \ coin they were spending.</p> \n      <p>\"We might be noisy, but we smell good!\"\
  \ Grogul drained his tankard and thumped it down on the bar, grinning at his captain.\
  \ \"Damn near forgot what it was like to be really <i>clean</i>. Thanks again, Captain.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"The least I could do.\" After a month at sea, springing for a\
  \ stint at Trillia's Bathhouse for his entire crew had been worth every scarab.\
  \ Besides, he could afford it.</p> \n      <p>Torius sipped, surveyed the well-mannered\
  \ debauchery, and sighed in contentment. The scam they had just pulled off had been\
  \ a near thing, but even after subtracting Vreva Jhafae's cut and the crew's shares,\
  \ he had more gold than he could imagine spending. He could buy another ship and\
  \ still have enough to live handsomely for years.</p> \n      <p>\"A shame Celeste\
  \ couldn't join us.\" Grogul accepted his refilled tankard and quaffed a third of\
  \ it.</p> \n      <p>Torius doubted that Celeste regretted using all her daily transformation\
  \ spells on the trip to Trillia's. Lunar nagas didn't sweat, and a quick swipe with\
  \ a damp cloth was enough to cleanse her scales of dust and dirt, so their trip\
  \ to the bathhouse had been a novel experience. He smiled as he recalled her look\
  \ of delight as she immersed her human form into the hot, sudsy water, reveling\
  \ in the luxury.</p> \n      <p>\"She's busy planning our trip to the Observatory\
  \ anyway.\"</p> \n      <p>More laughter rang from the betting circle. One of the\
  \ caravan guards with whom the Stargazers were competing had spilled ale all over\
  \ himself, and good-naturedly handed a silver back to Windy Kate. She wiped the\
  \ ale from his chin with a sultry gleam in her eye amid the hoots of the onlookers.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"When you leavin'?\" Grogul asked.</p> \n      <p>\"Oh, not for a\
  \ few days, at least. I need to discuss the alterations to <i>Stargazer</i> with\
  \ Snick, and set up an account that she and Thillion can draw on for the work.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Grogul snorted. \"Give that gnome free rein, and she'll spend you\
  \ into the poorhouse.\" </p> \n      <p>Torius couldn't deny the truth of that.\
  \ He'd already ordered Thillion to keep Snick's modifications under close supervision.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"And how long's this little vacation gonna take?\" Grogul sipped his\
  \ ale and narrowed his eyes at his captain, but Torius just grinned.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>\"A few weeks at least, more likely a month. Why? Are you bored already?\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Just thinkin' about the crew sittin' in Katapesh for so long with\
  \ nothin' to do. Boredom and money are a dangerous combination.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Once <i>Stargazer</i>'s back to her old self, Thillion could run a load of cargo\
  \ up to Absalom or Sothis.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Aye, that might keep 'em out of trouble.\"\
  \ Grogul scratched his chin in thought. \"Fenric should be able to handle the crew\
  \ for a simple cargo run.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Fenric?\" Torius cocked an eyebrow.\
  \ \"And where will you be?\"</p> \n      <p>\"With you, of course. The desert's\
  \ a dangerous place! Got a few others picked out to—\"</p> \n      <p>A harsh shout\
  \ and a crash brought the festivities to an abrupt halt.</p> \n      <p>\"Uh-oh.\"\
  \ Grogul slammed his tankard down, his eyes suddenly as sharp as the two kukris\
  \ tucked through his sash.</p> \n      <p>Torius followed his bosun's gaze and saw\
  \ Fenric with a bared cutlass in his hand. The Stargazers and caravan guards glared\
  \ at one another across the tankard-littered table. Between them, Windy Kate slumped\
  \ in a chair, spilled ale dampening her lap. Two more Stargazers sprawled in similar\
  \ conditions nearby.</p> \n      <p>The hairs stood up on the back of Torius's neck.\
  \ Something was wrong. Later in the evening, after much more drinking, passed-out\
  \ crew members would not have been an untoward occurrence. But this early? Not a\
  \ chance.</p> \n      <p>\"No fighting!\" the barkeep bellowed over the growls of\
  \ the crowd.</p> \n      <p>\"I'll handle this.\" Torius strode forward, Grogul\
  \ at his flank. \"What's going on here, Fenric?\"</p> \n      <p>The bosun's mate\
  \ pointed his cutlass at one of the caravan guards, a swarthy man with short-cropped\
  \ hair and a long, angular jaw. \"That motherless son of a scrub slipped somethin'\
  \ in Kate's ale! She's out like yesterday's bilge water! Troy and Fenthis, too!\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"That's a load of camel dung!\" the man protested. \"They just\
  \ can't hold their booze!\"</p> \n      <p>One glance and Torius knew the man was\
  \ lying. But why would they be drugging his sailors? He bristled with rage when\
  \ he considered that they might be slavers out to supplement their stock by preying\
  \ on the unwary. Whatever they were, they were outnumbered. Though Torius had no\
  \ doubt that his score of pirates would prevail over a dozen caravan guards, a fight\
  \ would be bad. Katapesh was their home port, and the Zephyr Guard enforced the\
  \ laws of the Pactmasters with unwavering efficiency. A little diplomacy was called\
  \ for.</p> \n      <p>\"Stow your blade, Fenric.\" The man dutifully slid his cutlass\
  \ into its sheath. Torius nodded toward the door as he glared at the caravan guards.\
  \ \"Now, you all move on to another bar. We don't like your tricks and we're not\
  \ going to play your games.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You move on! We were here first!\"\
  \ Spittle flew from the leader's bared teeth, and his hand edged closer to the hilt\
  \ of the gleaming axe at his hip.</p> \n      <p>\"Now friend, you really don't\
  \ want to start something you can't finish.\" Torius nodded to his grim-faced crew.\
  \ \"We don't want trouble, but—\"</p> \n      <p>Six more Stargazers suddenly crumpled\
  \ to the floor, taking the pirates' numerical advantage with them. Torius's stomach\
  \ clenched, and as he reached for his cutlass, he realized just how much trouble\
  \ they were in.</p> \n      <p>The leader's eyes gleamed with malice as his face\
  \ and form changed. His jaw elongated and opened wide, baring prominent canines\
  \ dripping with saliva. Thick fur sprouted from his skin, and his legs bent backward\
  \ into the limbs of a bipedal canine.</p> \n      <p>\"What in the name of Gozreh?\"\
  \ Torius doubted if even the sea god could give him an answer. He recognized the\
  \ features and coloration of the jackals he'd seen in the wildlands around Katapesh.\
  \ Only those were much smaller and didn't clutch weapons in claw-tipped hands.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The leader's axe flashed as the werejackal lunged at Torius.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Stargazers!\" As Torius drew his cutlass to parry, a kukri flashed past\
  \ his ear to cut a deep line in the werejackal's neck, ruining the creature's aim.\
  \ Torius turned his parry into a slash that opened the other side of his assailant's\
  \ neck, and the beast went down in a spray of blood.</p> \n      <p>The barkeep's\
  \ high-pitched shouts rose over the din, but none paid heed. Accustomed to fighting\
  \ in tight quarters and on uneven footing, the pirates reacted as a single unit.\
  \ Fenric kicked the table into two more charging werejackals and fought off a third,\
  \ while the remaining Stargazers formed up to protect their unconscious comrades.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Grogul snatched up the fallen werejackal's axe and stepped to Torius's\
  \ side. \"Come on!\" His bellow shook the walls and, from the sudden doubt in the\
  \ eyes of the leaderless werejackals, their morale as well.</p> \n      <p>In the\
  \ brief lull, Torius considered reining in his pirates, but the werejackals had\
  \ obviously been trying to kidnap some of his people, either to sell as slaves or\
  \ to have for dinner. To let them go without a proper lesson simply wouldn't do.\
  \ Torius grinned at the snarling creatures. \"It's time we taught these curs how\
  \ to heel! Have at 'em, Stargazers!\"</p> \n      <p>The pirates leapt to the attack,\
  \ battle cries rising from their throats. The werejackals met the assault with blades\
  \ and gnashing teeth. Torius's new opponent was a quick creature wielding a jagged\
  \ scimitar and a set of fangs capped with sharpened steel. Parrying the scimitar\
  \ with his cutlass, Torius drew his fighting dagger and plunged the blade into the\
  \ toothy maw. Teeth like sabers raked the back of his hand, but the tip of the blade\
  \ pierced the back of the creature's throat. Hot blood gushed out over Torius's\
  \ hand and the werejackal fell twitching to the floor. To his left, Grogul's axe\
  \ reduced his opponent's skull to a spray of shattered bone and meat, while to his\
  \ right, Fenric scored a deep gash in his adversary's arm.</p> \n      <p>In no\
  \ time, half of the werejackals were on the floor, either bleeding or dead. The\
  \ survivors disengaged and dashed for the exits. The Stargazers let them go, chasing\
  \ them only with a resounding cheer of victory.</p> \n      <p>\"For <i>Stargazer</i>!\"\
  \ Torius thrust his cutlass high in the air. </p> \n      <p>His crew cheered and\
  \ waved their weapons in menacing arcs, more inebriated by their victory than the\
  \ ale and rum they'd imbibed. Only two Stargazers had taken wounds, neither serious.\
  \ Torius wiped his sword clean on the tattered shirt of the werejackal leader, snapped\
  \ it into its scabbard, and bellowed for a round of drinks. The barkeep was nowhere\
  \ to be found, however, so Torius took the liberty of grabbing a bottle of rum from\
  \ behind the bar and emptying it into the cups and tankards of his cheering crew.\
  \ The ones who had fallen unconscious roused easily enough, though they were upset\
  \ at having missed the fun. Windy Kate, Troy, and Fenthis blinked in confusion,\
  \ unsure of what had happened.</p> \n      <p>Torius raised his cup high and shouted\
  \ for silence. \"To the crew of <i>Stargazer</i>! Best damn buccaneers in the whole\
  \ Inner Sea!\"</p> \n      <p>Torius quaffed his rum amid the cheers of his crew\
  \ and started pouring the next round, but their celebration was interrupted by a\
  \ hard-toned shout from the tavern's entrance.</p> \n      <p>\"Drop your weapons\
  \ in the name of the Zephyr Guard!\"</p> \n      <p>As one, the Stargazers turned\
  \ toward this new threat. Torius heard a low growl from his bosun's throat, but\
  \ he knew instantly that this was not a fight they could win. A half-dozen troops\
  \ flanked the Zephyr Guard squad leader, who had not even drawn her sword. She had\
  \ no need to. The monstrous aluum that ducked low to enter the tavern ensured her\
  \ safety. Humanoid in shape, but twice the height of Grogul, the aluum eyed them\
  \ passionlessly. Created and controlled by the Pactmasters, the virtually indestructible\
  \ magical constructs were powered by the bound souls of executed slaves and prisoners,\
  \ and knew no mercy.</p> \n      <p>\"Stand down, Stargazers.\" Torius waved his\
  \ crew back and strode forward, executing a respectful bow to the squad leader.\
  \ She wore no badge of rank other than the gleaming blue gem dangling around her\
  \ neck. She needed no other badge, for that trinket commanded the hulking aluum.\
  \ \"I'm glad you arrived. We were beset by these creatures and had just managed\
  \ to fight them off.\" He waved a hand at the dead werejackals.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  He wrecked my bar!\" The barkeep advanced from behind the Zephyrs. He pointed at\
  \ the broken furniture, blood, and gore that littered the floor. \"I'm ruined!\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Oh, you're not <i>ruined</i>, man,\" Torius argued. \"Nothing\
  \ that a carpenter and a little soap and water won't fix! And we didn't do any of\
  \ the wrecking! Three of my people were drugged, several more rendered unconscious,\
  \ and we were attacked. You saw it happen!\"</p> \n      <p>\"I saw nothing of the\
  \ kind!\" A gleam of avarice outshone the despondency in the bartender's eyes for\
  \ just a moment, but long enough to show Torius the game he would play. The werejackals\
  \ were long gone, so the only source of gold left was Torius. \"These ruffians were\
  \ loud and drunk and looking for a fight!\"</p> \n      <p>\"We were <i>not</i>.\"\
  \ Torius turned to the Zephyr Guard squad leader. \"Please, ma'am, my name is Captain\
  \ Torius Vin. I'm a guildsman in good standing, and these are my crew. Ruffians\
  \ we are not! We were simply celebrating our arrival in port, and ended up defending\
  \ ourselves from these creatures. This was not our fault, but since the guilty parties\
  \ have fled, I'll be happy to pay for the damages.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I'm pressing\
  \ charges!\" The barkeep folded his arms over his skinny chest in defiance. \"It'll\
  \ take a month to put this place to rights, and I'll lose my lease if I can't bring\
  \ in customers. My livelihood is ruined!\"</p> \n      <p>Torius refused to even\
  \ look at the man for fear that he couldn't keep his hands from around his lying\
  \ throat. \"That's a complete fabrication. My crew can have this place spit and\
  \ polish by tomorrow evening, and I'm willing to do so out of my own pocket. He's\
  \ after more than his due.\"</p> \n      <p>\"And what about the rumors? My business\
  \ will be ruined when the whole city finds out that there were murders here!\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Nobody's been murdered!\" Torius rounded on the man, so furious at\
  \ the accusations that his hand slipped unthinkingly to the hilt of his sword. \"\
  You're lying just to get more money out of me, and I won't stand here and—\"</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurb360\">\n       <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8524-Vreva.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8524-Vreva_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n       <br>There’s far more to Vreva than meets the eye.\n      </div> \n\
  \      <p>\"Enough!\" The Zephyr Guard squad leader's shout rivaled Grogul's. Everyone\
  \ fell silent. \"Master Helwek, Captain Vin has offered to pay for damages and repair\
  \ your establishment out of his own pocket. That sounds fair to me. Will you not\
  \ have an end to this without bringing the guard into it?\"</p> \n      <p>\"I'm\
  \ pressing charges!\" the bartender repeated, his face red. \"Disorderly conduct,\
  \ public drunkenness, destruction of property, and loss of livelihood due to wanton\
  \ negligence.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Public drunkenness? Gozreh's guts, man, it's a\
  \ tavern!\"</p> \n      <p>\"Arrest this man! I insist!\" He pointed a shaking finger\
  \ at Torius.</p> \n      <p>Torius seethed, but managed to compose his face before\
  \ turning to the squad leader. \"My people want no trouble with the Zephyr Guard,\
  \ ma'am. We'll go quietly, but you better add one more charge to that list.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The woman's brow wrinkled in confusion. \"What charge might that be,\
  \ Captain Vin?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Assault.\"</p> \n      <p>Now it was the bartender's\
  \ turn to look confused. \"But I wasn't—\"</p> \n      <p>Torius doubled up his\
  \ fist and cut the bartender's protest short by laying him flat out on the floor.\
  \ Turning back to the Zephyr Guard squad leader, he dusted off his hands and smiled.\
  \ \"Lead on to the gaol! I hope you've got room for all of us, because Stargazers\
  \ stick together! Grogul, get Windy Kate and the others.\"</p> \n      <p>Amid another\
  \ round of cheers, the boisterous pirates hoisted their still-woozy mates onto their\
  \ shoulders.</p> \n      <p>The squad leader only shook her head and said, \"This\
  \ way, Captain.\"</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Vreva paused for a moment at the second landing, just out of sight of the\
  \ room below, and took a deep breath to still her pounding heart.</p> \n      <p>*You\
  \ ready for this? You seem nervous,* Saffron said from the crook of her arm, keeping\
  \ his meows low.</p> \n      <p>She looked into the bright yellow eyes of her friend\
  \ and familiar and smiled. \"You're such a worrier,\" she whispered back. \"Of course\
  \ I'm ready.\" </p> \n      <p>She took another breath, and her body responded to\
  \ the long-practiced technique, calming her singing nerves. Raising her head and\
  \ moving with majestic grace, she continued down the sweeping marble stair that\
  \ led to the opulent entry hall of the Inn of the Eighth Sin.</p> \n      <p> A\
  \ joyful shout brought all eyes to her, and impromptu applause rose from the crowd.\
  \ Vreva beamed in the light of their adoration, sweeping an appreciative gaze across\
  \ the crowd as if astounded that all this fuss was for her. At least fifty Okeno\
  \ notables—some clients, some not—and a scattering of unknowns crowded the room.\
  \ It was enough to turn any woman's head, if that woman wasn't more worried about\
  \ her head ending up in a noose.</p> \n      <p>\"Quopek, you sly dear.\" At the\
  \ bottom of the stairs, Vreva playfully slapped the innkeeper's shoulder. \"A surprise\
  \ welcome-home party for me? How sweet of you!\"</p> \n      <p>\"Nothing but the\
  \ best for Okeno's foremost courtesan!\" The fat man quivered with excitement. Of\
  \ course he was happy to see her; he earned ten percent of her profits, and her\
  \ long absence had undoubtedly cut into his cash flow.</p> \n      <p>Vreva curtsied\
  \ with consummate grace and waded into the throng, accepting kisses from those she\
  \ knew, and proffering her hand to those she did not. Everyone jostled to catch\
  \ her eye. Her reputation, it seemed, had grown during her sabbatical.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>\"Absence apparently does make hearts grow fonder,\" Vreva whispered so\
  \ quietly that only Saffron could have heard her. None could understand their secret\
  \ language, but talking to a cat could draw attention. They'd long practiced the\
  \ art of conversing covertly, even in crowds, her whispers seeming nothing more\
  \ than an owner's senseless endearments to a beloved pet. </p> \n      <p>A callused\
  \ hand caressed the curve of her buttocks, and she barely suppressed the urge to\
  \ slap it away.</p> \n      <p>*Absence evidently makes the heart grow randy, too.*\
  \ Saffron's hiss at the slaver captain needed no interpreter.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Oh, be civil, Saffron!\" Vreva chided. She kissed her familiar on the head, then\
  \ whispered, \"You forget yourself! Now scout the room and report back!\" Dropping\
  \ the cat to the floor, she turned to her groper with a smile. \"My apologies, Captain.\
  \ We've been aboard ship for the better part of a week, and my poor kitty is in\
  \ a snit.\" </p> \n      <p>\"No offense taken, Mistress Jhafae,\" the slaver gushed,\
  \ giddy with her attention. \"We've got cats aboard <i>Hell's Razor</i>, you know.\
  \ Keeps the rats from chewing up the merchandise!\"</p> \n      <p>Vreva laughed\
  \ at the supposed witticism, bestowed a smile and subtle caress sufficient to leave\
  \ him dazzled and momentarily speechless, and continued circulating through the\
  \ crowd.</p> \n      <p>\"You look gorgeous, my dear. Absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>!\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Where <i>have</i> you been? It seems like you've been gone for\
  \ <i>ages</i>!\"</p> \n      <p>\"Mistress Jhafae, you simply <i>must</i> put me\
  \ at the top of your calendar. Even my wife has complained about how edgy I've been,\
  \ and only you ...\"</p> \n      <p>Compliments, promises, pleas, and questions\
  \ battered her like waves against a rocky shore, but Vreva responded with the glib\
  \ dissemblance she had perfected long ago. The physical contact, however, set her\
  \ teeth on edge. A hand on her arm or a kiss on the cheek roiled her stomach, while\
  \ the more intimate caresses forced her to suppress violent reprisals. Weeks among\
  \ pleasanter company had dulled her ability to block the revulsion she felt for\
  \ these people.</p> \n      <p><i>I never thought I'd miss Torius and his boatload\
  \ of pirates so much</i>!</p> \n      <p>Vreva caught an empathic flush of urgency,\
  \ then a flash of delight, and the flavor of seasoned meat flooded her mouth. Someone\
  \ had dropped a tidbit, and Saffron had pounced. Quashing the sensation with a sip\
  \ of wine, she broadcasted a thought of stern disapproval.</p> \n      <p><i>You\
  \ have a job to do. Do it!</i> He couldn't actually hear her thoughts, but would\
  \ get the gist.</p> \n      <p>\"I hope you are quite finished traipsing all around\
  \ the Inner Sea, Mistress Jhafae.\"</p> \n      <p>Vreva recognized the voice and\
  \ turned to the rotund slave merchant behind her.</p> \n      <p>\"It was just a\
  \ little holiday, Master Werreg.\" She accepted his kiss of greeting and did not\
  \ flinch as his pudgy fingers caressed her hip. Werreg might be a fat lecher, but\
  \ he was also an important member of the local merchants' council, and a font of\
  \ information.</p> \n      <p>\"I heard that you were spirited away by the Ruby\
  \ Prince himself!\" Looking pleased by his attempt at flattery, Werreg gave her\
  \ an ingratiating smile. \"I was worried that you'd succumbed to his charms and\
  \ gone away for good!\"</p> \n      <p>\"How could I <i>ever</i> leave my dear friends\
  \ here?\" Vreva caressed his sweaty cheek, tracing the nerve along his jaw. \"It\
  \ was not the Ruby Prince whose company I kept. Just a ...special friend who asked\
  \ a favor.\" That was true enough. Torius was a friend, or as close to one as she\
  \ had. And Quetaal, the commander of the Sothis Guard, with whom she'd kept company\
  \ there, had been like a breath of fresh air compared to these sniveling traders\
  \ in human flesh.</p> \n      <p>\"A toast to your favors.\" Werreg raised his glass,\
  \ leering openly at her. \"May they never run short of supply!\"</p> \n      <p>Laughing,\
  \ Vreva lifted her own glass in acknowledgment, but as her lips touched the rim,\
  \ panic surged through her. Then a jolt of pain between her shoulders snapped her\
  \ head back.</p> \n      <p><i>Saffron!</i> The glass trembled in her grasp, and\
  \ her vision glazed over as she concentrated on Saffron's mental cries. <i>Rage,\
  \ panic, fear </i><i>...</i><i>trapped!</i></p> \n      <p>\"Are you all right,\
  \ Vreva?\" Werreg's voice snapped her attention back to a circle of concerned guests.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>\"Yes, I ...I'm fine. Just a moment's fatigue.\" Sipping her wine,\
  \ she attempted to quell the emotional onslaught from her familiar before it overwhelmed\
  \ her. Considering her arsenal of spells, she silently cursed. Her magic was subtle,\
  \ tailored to the boudoir, not the battlefield, and certainly not a room full of\
  \ people. She had to disengage herself from this crowd and find Saffron. Vreva handed\
  \ off her glass and made her excuses. \"I've yet to recover from my voyage. The\
  \ wine, I'm afraid, is going to my—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Is this <i>yours</i>?\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Vreva turned to the unknown man. He wore a snug headscarf in the Keleshite\
  \ manner, and his beard was trimmed to a neat point. His clothes were rich, and\
  \ the long whip at one hip and the scimitar at the other gave him a rakish appearance.\
  \ She might have thought him handsome, except that he dangled Saffron by the scruff\
  \ in one large, callused hand. The sight sent a surge of ice water through her veins.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"I caught it running loose.\" He held the cat out, sneering as if\
  \ he'd just as soon wring the feline's neck.</p> \n      <p>\"Saffron!\" The familiar's\
  \ relief echoed her own as she took the panicked cat in her arms. The ice water\
  \ turned to fury, and Vreva glared at the man. \"I don't know you, sir, but molesting\
  \ my pet is not a means to garner my favor.\"</p> \n      <p>*He smells like blood!*\
  \ Saffron spat and hissed, mewing dangerously. *His boots and that snake at his\
  \ belt stink of it! I only sniffed, and he grabbed me!*</p> \n      <p>\"My pardon,\
  \ Mistress Jhafae.\" The man nodded and touched his forehead with a flourish. \"\
  I am Captain Heclech, master of <i>Sovereign Chain </i>out of Katheer. You must\
  \ forgive my reaction, but where I'm from, animals belong in cages or on <i>plates</i>,\
  \ not running free to soil a man's boots.\"</p> \n      <p> \"<i>My</i> pardon,\
  \ Captain Heclech, but I must <i>not</i> forgive you.\" Vreva was dismayed at the\
  \ harsh words and acerbic tone that tumbled from her lips, attributing them to the\
  \ waves of rage from Saffron that surged through her mind. \"This is <i>not</i>\
  \ your home, but mine, and in my home, my pet is afforded the same regard as <i>any</i>\
  \ guest.\" </p> \n      <p>*‘Pet' my pink, puckered ass!* Saffron hissed.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Shhh.\" She stroked his chin to ease his temper.</p> \n      <p>\"<i>Your</i>\
  \ home?\" Heclech looked around the inn's opulent hall. \"I was under the impression\
  \ that this was Master Quopek's establishment. He keeps many men and women of your\
  \ sort, does he not?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Master Quopek does not <i>keep</i> me, Captain.\
  \ I come and go as I please.\" She tried to keep her tone civil, but could not disguise\
  \ her dislike for the man.</p> \n      <p>\"A fact that has left us all pining for\
  \ the last many weeks, Captain,\" Werreg interjected from beside her.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>\"Yes.\" Heclech's eyes flicked to the merchant with a sneer of distaste.\
  \ \"This is why I came here, to see this woman who commands such obedience from\
  \ <i>men</i>.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I do not <i>command</i> anything, Captain Heclech.\"\
  \ Vreva regained her composure and gave him a sultry smile. \"They offer their respects\
  \ willingly.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Along with a good bit of gold.\" Werreg laughed,\
  \ obviously trying to diffuse the situation. \"I daresay we're all a bit richer\
  \ for her recent absence, but I for one intend to pay my respects to her as soon\
  \ as she'll have me.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Where I'm from, women of her ilk do not\
  \ <i>have</i> the respect of men.\" Heclech turned his eyes to Werreg and grinned\
  \ a challenge. \"And men who curry the favor of such women are little better than\
  \ dogs.\"</p> \n      <p>Werreg paled, his blubbery chins quivering with rage, but\
  \ he obviously knew better than to take up the man's challenge.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  And in <i>this</i> city, Captain, it's considered rude to insult a lady.\" The voice\
  \ over Vreva's shoulder was low with a slight rasp, like well-oiled steel sliding\
  \ across a fine whetstone.</p> \n      <p>She recognized the speaker even before\
  \ Saffron said, *The wine man's behind you.* </p> \n      <p>Vreva felt a hand settle\
  \ onto the small of her back and urge her aside. She didn't know whether to be relieved\
  \ or agitated.</p> \n      <p>\"And this <i>particular</i> lady has friends in very\
  \ high places.\" Her champion stepped forward. His dark hair, pale complexion, and\
  \ richly brocaded clothing marked him as Chelish, while the hand on the gleaming\
  \ rapier at his hip marked him as a swordsman. Vreva knew that he was neither, but\
  \ something else entirely.</p> \n      <p>\"If you wish to do business in Okeno,\
  \ Captain Heclech, and not be shunned like a plague-carrying rodent, you should\
  \ apologize, and reconsider your opinion of Mistress Jhafae.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  And you are?\" Heclech's hand drifted to the scimitar at his waist.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>\"Captain Fieson Templeton of <i>Devil's Dawn</i>.\" He made a short, courtly\
  \ bow, and nodded to Vreva. \"Chelish merchant and <i>close</i> personal friend\
  \ of the lady.\"</p> \n      <p>\"And by whose authority do you threaten me?\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Threaten?\" Fieson laughed, but his mirth didn't reach his eyes,\
  \ and his gaze never left Heclech. \"Oh, that was no threat, Captain, just a bit\
  \ of advice. If you treat the lady with contempt, her friends will see to it that\
  \ you do no business here. It's that simple.\" He shrugged. \"Insult her again and\
  \ I will personally feed you your own testicles. Now<i> that</i>,\" he added in\
  \ a helpful tone, \"was a threat.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Gentlemen, please, you mustn't—\
  \"</p> \n      <p>\"She's nothing but a high-priced prostitute!\" Heclech stepped\
  \ aggressively forward, and Vreva eased back a step, realizing the futility of attempting\
  \ to placate the two men. \"And you <i>pay</i> for her favors because you could\
  \ never earn the attention of—\"</p> \n      <p>The sounds of tearing silk and a\
  \ wet plop on the marble floor interrupted his tirade.</p> \n      <p>Heclech's\
  \ eyes flung wide, his voice caught in a strangled cry. Fieson stepped back as the\
  \ larger man collapsed to his knees, hands clutching at the flood of crimson down\
  \ his legs. The crowd gasped, and Vreva turned away, pressing a hand to her mouth\
  \ in feigned shock. She knew Fieson did not threaten idly and, while he might not\
  \ be skilled with a sword, he was entirely apt with the stiletto he wore strapped\
  \ to his forearm beneath his sleeve. His cut had both gelded the man and severed\
  \ one of the large arteries in his leg.</p> \n      <p>*Good!* Saffron purred as\
  \ the man fell into the spreading crimson pool. *Now he smells like his <i>own</i>\
  \ blood!*</p> \n      <p>\"Captain Templeton! What is the meaning of—\" Quopek stepped\
  \ through the onlookers and gaped. \"Abadar's key, man, what have you done?\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"The man insulted our guest of honor.\" Fieson casually cleaned and\
  \ sheathed his blade. \"After I warned him about his conduct, he insulted me with\
  \ his hand on his sword. With Mistress Jhafae so near, I had no choice but to carry\
  \ through with my warning. For <i>her</i> safety, of course.\" He bowed to Vreva,\
  \ then the innkeeper. \"My apologies to Mistress Jhafae, and to you, Master Quopek,\
  \ for the mess. I'll be more than happy to pay for the cleanup.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Well!\" Quopek assessed the dead man, the stained marble floor, and the crowd. \"\
  I really should call the city guard about—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Please, Master Quopek.\"\
  \ Vreva stepped forward, fanning herself with her hand as if she might faint. The\
  \ blood affected her not one bit, but she had a façade to maintain, and needed to\
  \ avoid calling official attention to the incident. \"Captain Templeton was only\
  \ defending my honor. I've never seen this man before, and I wonder at his motives\
  \ for coming here. He picked the fight, sir, and he picked it with the wrong man.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>A buzz of confirmatory assertions swept through the crowd, lauding\
  \ Captain Templeton. In the end, Quopek merely called for a flock of slaves to clean\
  \ up the mess, and shifted the reception to the common room. Vreva sighed with relief\
  \ as she allowed Templeton to escort her to the new venue. Envious glances followed\
  \ them as the captain leaned in close.</p> \n      <p>\"I have a present for you,\
  \ Vreva.\"</p> \n      <p>She beamed up at him. \"How <i>sweet</i> of you, Captain.\
  \ And in gratitude for your gallant defense of my honor, you shall have my first\
  \ appointment. Is tomorrow afternoon good for you?\"</p> \n      <p>\"I am at your\
  \ disposal, my lady,\" he said with a satisfied smile.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
