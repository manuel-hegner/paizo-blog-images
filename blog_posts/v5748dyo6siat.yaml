  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The <em>CRAAAACK</em> of\
  \ the shattering vase echoed off the walls of the tiny house. Near the shards on\
  \ the stone floor, a boy stood frozen.</p> \n     <p>“Baranthet, what’s that?” Grandmother’\
  s voice came around the corner a bit before she did, wobbling slightly to avoid\
  \ too much pressure on her hip.</p> \n     <p>“I’m sorry,” the boy mumbled, “I was\
  \ trying to get the maps down and…”</p> \n     <p>Grandmother stopped in front of\
  \ the vase’s remains. “Oh, this old thing? Don’t worry. Auntie Nashan got it for\
  \ me before I moved here to the city all those years ago, but honestly, it’s a bit\
  \ flashy, and I’ve never known quite where to put it. Still, she said it was something\
  \ to—” Grandmother stopped as her eyes fell on four pieces of clay, or perhaps they\
  \ were stone, or perhaps they were bone, lying among what was once a rather gaudy\
  \ vase, “—something to remember home by.”</p> \n     <p>Grandmother picked up one\
  \ of the stones, rolling it around in her hand as she rolled some memories around\
  \ in her head. “Baranthet, if you clean this up and wash up, I’ll tell you a story,\
  \ one my grandmother once told me. <em>The Wardens of the Wild</em>.”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The boy’s eyes widened. He knew every one of Grandmother’s stories—<em>The\
  \ Tale of the Liar King</em>, <em>The Queen of Bees</em>, <em>The Whispering Parrot</em>—\
  but he didn’t know this one. In a blink, the vase was tidied, his face was clean,\
  \ and he was under the covers.</p> \n     <p>The curtains blew in the warm autumn\
  \ air.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6940bbac-f65e-4907-a89c-da899a91dafa/EmblemofForestsandMeadows_1500.png\"\

  \ epochs and days ago, there was a young elephant. She was quite small for an elephant\
  \ (though this meant she was still quite large for any other animal), and so she\
  \ usually played with the other animals of the plains and grasslands and forests,\
  \ those that scamper through the brush and chase through the trees, like the elk\
  \ or the hooplamander or the wolf. She enjoyed nothing more than sweet tree fruits,\
  \ like papayas—”</p> \n     <p>“But they have so many seeds!”</p> \n     <p>“—like\
  \ mangos,” Grandmother pivoted, smooth as a maple seed in freefall. “And she shared\
  \ them with her smaller friends. But one day, there were no mangos to be found.\
  \ The little elephant and her friends grew hungrier, and they searched far and wide,\
  \ until eventually they found where all the food had gone. A greedy sloth had taken\
  \ them all.”</p> \n     <p>“Mean sloth!”</p> \n     <p>“No matter how much the little\
  \ elephant asked, the greedy sloth wouldn’t give the food back, and he was a very\
  \ big sloth, like you hear about from the merchants sometimes up in the Kaava Lands,\
  \ the ones as big as a house, and the little elephant was very little. She decided\
  \ to ask an even bigger animal for help, the biggest one, the Warden of Forests\
  \ and Meadows, for it is the duty of a warden to advise the creatures under their\
  \ charge and settle their disputes.</p> \n     <p>“But the Warden of Forests and\
  \ Meadows saw something in the little elephant. Rather than settle the problem himself,\
  \ which he could have done easily, he asked the little elephant why she had come\
  \ to him. ‘Why, because you’re the biggest creature around,’ she said. And so the\
  \ warden responded, ‘Then surely all you need to do is become even bigger than I\
  \ am.</p> \n     <p>“The little elephant didn’t know how to do that, but she thought\
  \ and thought, and she had an idea. She waited until evening, when the sun was very\
  \ tired and near the horizon, and she went to the greedy sloth’s den. She flared\
  \ up her ears, and stuck out her trunk, and bellowed with all her might. And even\
  \ though the elephant was very little, her sunset shadow was bigger than any other\
  \ creature, even the warden. The greedy sloth took one look at it, and seeing such\
  \ a big creature, he ran away so fast that he left all the delicious food behind,\
  \ and the little elephant and her friends never went hungry again.</p> \n     <p>“\
  And ever since that day, after every Migration, the Warden of Forests and Meadows\
  \ has always been a clever sort, one who always thinks around a problem rather than\
  \ barreling through it. Remember, Baranthet, that the animals of nature are far\
  \ from dumb beasts, but are just as clever as us, and often more so.”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The boy, transfixed, nodded so hard his eyelids started to droop. “Wait, what’\
  s the Migration? And there were four tiles, does that mean there’s four wardens?”\
  \ His voice was sleepy as he tried to get a peep at the remaining tiles (to no avail;\
  \ they had disappeared to wherever it is that grandmothers keep such things from\
  \ prying eyes). But Grandmother had already placed a dollop of honey in the blown-glass\
  \ jar near the bed, and the firebugs in it had already begun to softly glow, as\
  \ they would until Baranthet was safely asleep. She moved to the door.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“That, my little explorer, is a story for another day.”</p> \n     <br> \
