  \ by Remko Troost</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Altronus\
  \ Barasul Dovenayan was born into House Holdare, a traditional and respected family\
  \ on the kasatha generation-ship-turned-homeland <i>Idari</i>. The Holdare trace\
  \ their lineage to Great Families already well respected when the <i>Idari</i> left\
  \ Kasath for their centuries-long trip to the Pact Worlds, and have maintained strong\
  \ connections with both the houses that rose to prominence on the ship while crew\
  \ functions were paramount, and younger houses risen to prominence since the <i>Idari</i>\
  \ became an enormous space station. Much of the influence of House Holdare comes\
  \ from their renown for producing skilled adata—scholar-priests who oversee the\
  \ removal and preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasatha in technomagical\
  \ temples called <i>adats</i>. Even in times when ships officers, pilots, and navigators\
  \ find their social relevance waning, the adata remain highly respected in kasatha\
  \ society. </p> \n     <p>The eldest living member of House Holdare, Barasul Naedarin\
  \ Allar of Clan Allar, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts and doyen of the ship's adata,\
  \ took a special interest in Altronus shortly after his birth, though he was but\
  \ a distant nephew to her. Of course the attention of so great a clan elder comes\
  \ with more responsibility and expectation than comfort, and though Altronus was\
  \ raised with significant prestige and resources as a youth, he was also pushed\
  \ to begin adata training very early, his family even going so far as to name him\
  \ after famous adata doyens.</p> \n     <p>While Altronus did not excel at his studies\
  \ the way his family had hoped, neither did he do poorly, and most people chalked\
  \ his merely adequate results up to his relative youth. In truth, Altronus was indeed\
  \ an excellent scholar, simply one who had trouble focusing on a single topic for\
  \ long. Inevitably, some interesting fact in his studies would pique his interest\
  \ and draw his research off into unrelated sidetracks. This broad, self-directed\
  \ education made him adept at making connections between disparate fields, yet earned\
  \ him little love from traditionalist teachers who saw his scattered studies as\
  \ a failure to focus and a deliberate rejection of tried-and-true scholarly practices.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Though his close family were dedicated worshipers of Talavet, the Storyteller\
  \ deity, one of Altronus's more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could\
  \ be better brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, which\
  \ teaches that existence is an endless, connected series of events as stars are\
  \ born, die, and born again. Though the Cycle is the guiding philosophy of the solarians,\
  \ contemplative warriors with a tradition stretching far back into the history of\
  \ Kasath, it's also seen as a useful tool for training body and mind in preparation\
  \ for the rigors of other vocations. </p> \n     <p>Altronus was accepted as a student\
  \ into a prestigious cosmonastery on the <i>Idari</i>, and taught to focus his thoughts\
  \ on the forces of the universe around him, to draw strength and guidance from the\
  \ endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training\
  \ immediately, and soon was among the most advanced students, most of whom sought\
  \ not just to understand the lessons of the Cycle, but to embody them in the path\
  \ of the solarian. Altronus, however, was still slated for a career as an adata.\
  \ This preordained path didn't bother him—as he approached adulthood and the yearlong\
  \ ritual walkabout of the Tempering, he was allowed to take on guard shifts at the\
  \ ship's famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms of stasis pods where adata\
  \ connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of\
  \ memories from archived kasatha brains could be experienced, sorted, and analyzed.\
  \ On rare occasions, he was even allowed to experience ancient Sensorium memories\
  \ himself, and it was these glimpses of lives and secrets long lost that most drove\
  \ Altronus to complete his studies and become a full adata.</p> \n     <p>During\
  \ one of his last scheduled shifts as an adata student, Altronus was assigned to\
  \ an inactive Sensorium access node—one rarely used, but like all Sensorium access\
  \ points still important enough to be protected by force fields and a round-the-clock\
  \ guard. Though most such shifts were uneventful, on that night Altronus was surprised\
  \ by the appearance of a fully cloaked and apparently rushed senior adata, Remura\
  \ Esolla Kaiban of Clan Senthen, flashing a warrant to allow unscheduled access\
  \ to the memory of a recently deceased citizen. Thanks to his tendency to collect\
  \ trivia, Altronus knew Remura was scheduled to be giving a lecture at the far end\
  \ of the <i>Idari</i>. What, he wondered, could be of such great importance that\
  \ the revered adat would end the lecture early, not to mention need an emergency\
  \ Sensorium warrant? </p> \n     <p>Altronus knew he should mind his own business,\
  \ but again curiosity overrode his training. Altronus contacted a friend at the\
  \ far end of the ship, who informed him that not only had Adata Kaiban not left\
  \ the lecture early—she was still on the stage.</p> \n     <p>Immediately Altronus\
  \ sounded an intruder alert, and rushed into the Sensorium access node to confront\
  \ the false adata. To his surprise, Altronus discovered not a kasatha, but a small,\
  \ sickly gray humanoid standing in a pile of robes and strange machinery, with long\
  \ wires and humming crystals latched onto the Sensorium feed and hundreds of images\
  \ flashing from the access node to the gray creature's alien devices. Altronus leapt\
  \ to activate the Sensorium emergency disconnect, but the bulbous creature struck\
  \ him with a taclash, ripping the pulsecaster from his grip, then shot him with\
  \ a pistol that fired a searing green ray. Through the resulting haze of pain, Altronus\
  \ managed to seal the access node's security force fields, trapping himself and\
  \ the gray intruder inside.</p> \n     <p>With a shock, Altronus realized the severity\
  \ of the situation. Any response to his alarm would take precious moments to arrive,\
  \ and still more to disable the force field. Unarmed, Altronus had little chance\
  \ of holding the intruder at bay. He had no way of healing the wound from the creature's\
  \ pistol. For the first time in his life, Altronus truly confronted the fact that\
  \ he was going to die. Like the stars themselves, he too would be extinguished,\
  \ his body breaking down and eventually being reincorporated over millennia into\
  \ new entities, new worlds, new stars. At last, he truly understood the Cycle. With\
  \ his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ the universe answered.</p> \n     <p>Altronus was as surprised as the strange\
  \ gray alien to find a long, shining golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower\
  \ right forearm. Yet he had seen enough of solarian training to recognize the blade\
  \ of stellar energy for what it was, and leapt to put it to use, placing himself\
  \ between the creature and the node's access panels. The two fought in grim silence,\
  \ and though it was clear the gray invader was the more skilled, Altronus stood\
  \ his ground, putting to use every scrap of training he'd gained. He didn't need\
  \ to win—only buy time, keeping the creature from finishing its infiltration of\
  \ the Sensorium until help arrived.</p> \n     <p>Blow after blow fell upon Altronus,\
  \ and the pistol's strange green rays continued to singe and scale his flesh, but\
  \ Altronus would not fall. His blade scored many fewer hits, and at times seemed\
  \ to pass cleanly through his foe to no effect, but he pressed the attack as best\
  \ he could. As he did, a fierce joy welled up in him, a sense of the rightness of\
  \ the path that had led him to this moment. This cosmic contentment continued to\
  \ expand until he had no choice but to release it, unleashing a burst of searing\
  \ stellar flame in all direction.</p> \n     <p>At last, ship security arrived,\
  \ using their command bypasses to deactivate the access node's force fields and\
  \ dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Yet upon seeing that it was outnumbered,\
  \ the bulbous-headed alien didn't continue to fight, or attempt to escape. Rather,\
  \ it paused to take stock of the situation, toggled a device on its arm—and detonated\
  \ its own head like a bomb.</p> \n     <p>The security team secured the body and\
  \ questioned Altronus. When several true adata arrived, they immediately attempted\
  \ to preserve part of the horrid gray thing's exploded brain. While their efforts\
  \ to pull meaning from the splatter were greatly hindered, two ideas were recovered.\
  \ The first was that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds. The second\
  \ was that the time of something important called \"Phase Three\" was coming soon.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Doyenate of the Idari was informed, and additional security added\
  \ to Sensorium access nodes. While the matter of gray infiltrators was officially\
  \ left open to investigation, with no more solid leads and no further incidents,\
  \ official attention quickly turned elsewhere.</p> \n     <p>But Altronus couldn't\
  \ let the issue lie.</p> \n     <p>Questions filled his mind. How thoroughly had\
  \ grays infiltrated the Pact Worlds? Had they successfully infiltrated the <i>Idari</i>?\
  \ What did this gray seek to learn from the Sensorium? Why had it sought to destroy\
  \ its own brain when capture became inevitable? And, most importantly, what was\
  \ Phase Three, and how soon would it arrive? Altronus tried to quiet his mind with\
  \ further solarian training, but while his powers grew, his sense of calm did not.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As it came time for Altronus to begin his Tempering, he realized he\
  \ could never accept a role as an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung\
  \ over him. He sought, and received, approval from his house doyen to abandon the\
  \ path he had long trod, and informed his family that he was leaving the <i>Idari</i>.\
  \ He had no firm idea of where he would go, nor how his investigation would advance,\
  \ only a vow to chase down every strange occurrence that might mark a potential\
  \ gray incursion within the Pact Worlds. While many of these events had other—sometimes\
  \ equally strange—explanations, he found enough potential connections to the grays\
  \ to support his growing suspicion that secret conspiracies indeed existed just\
  \ out of sight. Still a rigorous scholar, he began to accept that he'd need to give\
  \ more credence to outrageous claims and unlikely stories if he ever wanted to uncover\
  \ the truth.</p> \n     <p>Now inarguably an adult, Altronus has nevertheless remained\
  \ on his Tempering for much longer than the traditional year, and still sees himself\
  \ as working to form the traditions that will guide him through his later life.\
  \ He often signs on with freelancers and adventuring companies as a guard, scout,\
  \ or researcher in order to support himself—especially if their activities align\
  \ with his obsession—yet his primary goal always remains researching the shadowy\
  \ web of plots he first glimpsed that night in the access node. Ironically, while\
  \ he comes across to many kasatha as overly impetuous and offbeat, his natural kasatha\
  \ love of traditions, his devotion to the Cycle, and his scholar's desire to monologue\
  \ about admittedly unconventional research often causes members of other races to\
  \ see him as an eccentric professor or addled conspiracy theorist. Any skepticism\
  \ as to his usefulness, however, disappears in the first firefight, as Altronus\
  \ launches himself into the fray and \"lets the cosmos take control,\" slicing through\
  \ hordes of enemies with terrifying calm.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Owen\
