  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've just recently\
  \ begun to recover from an amazing, whirlwind Gen Con 2015. While we're getting\
  \ back to our normal routines, we have some news to share about the fantastic show\
  \ this year!</p> \n    <p>Demos of <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> ran at all hours\
  \ of the Exhibitor Hall were a big hit. More exact numbers will have to wait for\
  \ some of our records to arrive, but we know that over a thousand people played\
  \ <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> with the help of a dedicated and talented cadre\
  \ of PFS volunteers, along with Brian, Chad, Gaby, Keith, Mike, Tanis, and Vic.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Meanwhile, Pathfinders took over the Sagamore Ballroom for the second\
  \ year in a row. The <a href=\"pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a> ran over a dozen\
  \ tables from morning to night, ably managed by a crew of amazing purple-, orange-,\
  \ and axe-wielding volunteers. Both <em>Season of the Shackles</em> and <em>Season\
  \ of the Righteous</em> were available for ACG play, alongside a sneak preview of\
  \ the brand-new, yet-to-be-released Paladin, Druid, and Monk class decks!</p> \n\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, we had one more special event for Gen Con 2015:\
  \ the first-ever <b><i>PACG Open Tournament</i></b>! For the inaugural year, we\
  \ kept the event to a manageable size (and yes, we definitely heard <b>many</b>\
  \ requests to expand it in the future!), and ran the three rounds of demonically\
  \ difficult scenarios over the four days of the convention. Combining elements of\
  \ <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, <em>Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous</em>, and the Class Decks, the Open Tournament was a blast to create\
  \ and run, and many battered but victorious players declared it a delight to play.\
  \ Each round allowed only a few select teams to advance, ending with a head-to-head\
  \ competition against an angry, insane, watery demon lord.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ <i>Tanis: Here, I got you a present!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The excellently-named\
  \ team \"Don't Trust Tanis\" did extremely well in the first round, but ran into\
  \ some bad luck in the second round, and ended the tournament in third place. The\
  \ doughty members of \"Don't Trust Tanis\" were Eric, Rob, Rand, and Joe. They have\
  \ pledged to return next year, and to continue not trusting Tanis!</p> \n    <div\
