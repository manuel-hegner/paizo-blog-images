  \ align=\"right\" border=\"0\"></a> \n   <h1>Plow and Sword</h1> \n   <p>by Robert\
  \ E. Vardeman</p> \n   <h2> Chapter Three: Relics of the Past</h2> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Rorr used the shovel to turn dirt amid the tree roots until he struck\
  \ the buried packages. He dropped to his knees and used his hands to brush away\
  \ the remaining dirt, revealing several small packets and one larger one. That last\
  \ one he ignored, instead pulling the oilcloth wrappings free from one of the smaller\
  \ bundles.</p> \n    <p>Inside lay bronze wrist guards. He ran his fingers over\
  \ their nicked, rough surfaces. At one time they had been smooth. Proper care demanded\
  \ that he smooth down the deep cuts and curls peeled back from the surface.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Rorr settled them on his forearms without further consideration of proper\
  \ appearance. They would do. Greaves followed. He sat with his legs thrust out as\
  \ he adjusted them. A long-bladed knife came next, its keen edge gleaming in the\
  \ starlight. Rorr had always taken better care of it than his wrist guards. The\
  \ final package he drew forth, blowing off dust and dirt, was a small buckler. The\
  \ faded sigil couldn't be discerned. </p> \n    <p>At one time, that would have\
  \ bothered him. No longer.</p> \n    <p>Settling the strap around his left wrist,\
  \ Rorr turned the buckler this way and that, feeling the strain on muscles unused\
  \ for a year and longer. He picked up the knife and sheathed it behind the buckler,\
  \ then stood.</p> \n    <p>The greaves felt awkward on his legs, and the right wrist\
  \ guard chafed. If he had worn it earlier, the half-orc's arrow wouldn't have penetrated\
  \ his flesh. More than once, the brass guards had safely turned away arrows or sword\
  \ thrusts. They might have to again.</p> \n    <p>He returned to the bodies of Lord\
  \ Suvarian's brigands. No matter that they claimed to be on a royal mission—Rorr\
  \ knew them for what they were. Killers. Thieves. Highwaymen, and nothing more.\
  \ He dragging the bodies out to the field where he had already plowed, laying them\
  \ heel to head, then covered that row with dirt. It provided a sorry grave for the\
  \ soldiers, and animals would come to dine on the carrion. Rorr wanted only to keep\
  \ the corpses out of sight from his wife and children.</p> \n    <p>Soon enough\
  \ they would see death. Of that he was certain, but until then he would shield them\
  \ however he could. </p> \n    <p>With long strides, he went to the nearby coppice\
  \ most likely to shelter the soldiers' horses. A small smile came to his lips when\
  \ he saw the steeds. It took only a few minutes for the horses to accept him. Rorr\
  \ selected one and mounted. The other would serve as a second plow horse afterward.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Afterward.</p> \n    <p>Rorr couldn't find the trail taken by the two\
  \ soldiers, so he simply relaxed his hold on the reins and let the horse have its\
  \ head. It would return to the camp it had left. If not, he suspected it would take\
  \ him in the proper general direction. As he bounced along, he half slept, letting\
  \ his mind settle. There had been other battles, and he knew the need to be rested.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yet in those other battles, his wife and their children had not been\
  \ at risk. This bored into Rorr's brain and rooted around, turning him uneasy. Some\
  \ might say marrying his brother's widow was wrong, but he had known Beeah long\
  \ before Ulane wed her, and he would not leave his brother's wife to starve, or\
  \ take up with a lesser man. Their sons were strong and smart and would make good\
  \ farmers one day. Ulane was the better farmer, but Rorr had not been a poor student.\
  \ Life on their childhood farm near Gralton had been easier, with better soil, longer\
  \ seasons, and access to irrigation. But for all the challenges here, Rorr knew\
  \ this farm could be proved, and they would all flourish.</p> \n    <p>Asmodeus\
  \ take upstarts like Suvarian, who thought to steal what he could not otherwise\
  \ own.</p> \n    <p>Rorr perked up when he saw a pair of low campfires in the distance.\
  \ Dawn was still two hours from arriving, fresh and cold. Again, he resented Lord\
  \ Suvarian's intrusion on his schedule. The fields had to be properly prepared,\
  \ and winter cover planted to ready them for spring.</p> \n    <p>As sharp as his\
  \ eyesight was, he saw no movement in the camp. No dim shape passed in front of\
  \ the glowing coals in the fire pits. Those in the camp slept. Did they follow military\
  \ procedure enough to post sentries? What of warding spells? It wasn't unusual for\
  \ a minor sorcerer or priest to travel with a war party and cast simple spells or\
  \ offer healing. Putting out a simple ward spell was a moment's work, even for an\
  \ apprentice.</p> \n    <p>The closer he rode, the more he doubted any magic had\
  \ been employed. They thought they were safe in their numbers. Force of arms against\
  \ dirt farmers was enough to correct any small misjudgment in that respect. What\
  \ did they fear a man armed only with a pitchfork, when they had bows and arrows,\
  \ swords and shields?</p> \n    <p>He slipped from horseback and grabbed the reins,\
  \ leading the reluctant horse away from the rude corral at the far side of the camp.\
  \ Undoubtedly the horse remembered being fed and watered there. Rorr secured the\
  \ reins in such a way that the horse could nibble at tough grass and dying plants,\
  \ then advanced on foot.</p> \n    <p>Buckler kept low and away from the fire to\
  \ prevent a warning reflection, he moved to within a few paces of the sleeping men.\
  \ A slow count of dark blanket-covered lumps told Rorr that six men slept. He backed\
  \ away, circled the camp, and counted horses.</p> \n    <p>Eight.</p> \n    <p>Two\
  \ sentries had been posted away from the camp, but neither had spotted him as he\
  \ approached. Rorr considered his route to the camp and decided that the guards\
  \ either slept on duty—a crime punishable by twenty lashes in most armies—or he\
  \ had inadvertently chosen the proper direction where each picket thought the other\
  \ had returned to camp.</p> \n    <p>If each sentry made a half circuit of the camp,\
  \ he decided that the first had to be some distance from the camp amid a tangle\
  \ of thorn bushes. No soldier waited at such a place. Rorr looked up into the tree\
  \ above the thicket. A slow smile came to his lips. A dark knot lodged in the crook\
  \ of the trunk and first limb could only be a large hunting cat—or a sleeping soldier.</p>\

  \  </table> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Rorr slowly paced in the opposite direction.\
  \ Pulling a guard from the tree was easy enough, but the noise would alert the others.\
  \ Better to deal with the second guard, if he had remained on the ground.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He almost stumbled over the sleeping sentry. The man sat with his back against\
  \ a tree trunk, legs drawn up and head resting on his knees. His sword lay at his\
  \ right side where he could grab it in an instant.</p> \n    <p>If he were awake.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Rorr moved like a disembodied spirit, bent and silently lifted the sword\
  \ from the ground. The guard stirred, sneezed and then returned to his dreams. Rorr\
  \ backed from him, the captured sword gripped tightly. It fit his hand poorly. The\
  \ guard's fingers were shorter, stubbier, the breadth of his hand far less than\
  \ that Rorr's. Not the hand of a swordsman, but of a craftsman.</p> \n    <p>Suvarian\
  \ sent pot-throwers to fight farmers. Rorr couldn't help sneering. He was about\
  \ to throw the sword away when the guard sneezed again and looked up.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The man died on the point of his own sword, thrashing about noisily before\
  \ having the good grace to die. Rorr left him impaled on the sword and returned\
  \ to the camp. None of the soldiers had stirred from the commotion, but that didn't\
  \ mean the other sentry hadn't been alerted. He circled the camp once more, approaching\
  \ the distant picket high in the tree.</p> \n    <p>He heard snoring before he got\
  \ close enough to reach up and grab the man's ankle. With a quick jerk, he dislodged\
  \ the man, who fell heavily to land belly-down. Rorr dropped so his knee drove into\
  \ the small of the man's back, pinning him. With a quick move, he reached around\
  \ the struggling man's throat, caught his chin, and twisted hard to the side. The\
  \ man died immediately.</p> \n    <p>Rorr stepped back, panting with the exertion.\
  \ He felt a little sick to his stomach at the deaths, then remembered what these\
  \ brigands had done to the Torvans. The entire family might have been murdered.\
  \ If they hadn't, they had been driven away from their land and harvest. It was\
  \ not a choice he would want to make.</p> \n    <p>He sighed. He knew how he would\
  \ respond if it came to that. He would leave the homestead behind to save Beeah\
  \ and the boys. Cursing Thom Torvan for making a similar decision did no good.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He looked through the trees and saw the first hint of dawn—it was likely\
  \ false dawn, the lightening before a deeper darkness followed by the sun creeping\
  \ above the horizon. Time crushed down on him as surely as he had thrust his knee\
  \ into the dead soldier's back.</p> \n    <p>Moving faster, making more noise, he\
  \ returned to the camp. Most of the sleeping men held their swords or lay alongside\
  \ them, making removal difficult. He poked through the contents of their gear, taking\
  \ each bowstring he found. The knife slid from its sheath on the back of his buckler\
  \ and chopped the strings into short pieces. He found the longbows and similarly\
  \ tended to their strings. Then he began sawing and hacking at the arrows in quivers.\
  \ A hundred arrows he broke or cut the fletching off.</p> \n    <p>Only one arrow\
  \ had been dipped in the oily black substance that had ignited Torvan's granary.\
  \ Rorr lifted it from a separate quiver and peered at it in the darkness. A skin\
  \ sheath prevented air from touching the incendiary liquid. He slung the quiver\
  \ over his shoulder and settled the arrow, not sure how he could use it.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He took one last look around the camp and knew he had destroyed what he\
  \ could. The remaining six fighters began to stir as daylight filtered through the\
  \ trees. Rorr walked steadily to the horses tethered to a rope. His knife rose and\
  \ came down, its sharp edge slicing through the restraining rope. He waved his arms\
  \ and spooked the horses.</p> \n    <p>As they ran off, the men in camp realized\
  \ something was seriously wrong. They drew swords and reached for bows.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Rorr laughed at the archers' impotence, but the swordsmen came for him, yelling\
  \ to be sure all their companions were awake and alert to the danger.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>He swung, used his buckler to deflect the nearest soldier's thrust, then stepped\
  \ close and drove his blade up under the lowest rib and into a beating heart. Before\
  \ he yanked the blade free, that heart ceased throbbing. The warrior fell to the\
  \ ground.</p> \n    <p>He saw the other five note his expertise, coming to the realization\
  \ that only through united action might they continue to live.</p> \n    <p>\"To\
  \ his flanks! Move, damn your eyes!\" The soldier bellowing orders from the center\
  \ was either an officer or someone the others obeyed without question.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Rorr reached into the quiver and used the edge of his blade to peel away the\
  \ skin sheath around the fire arrow. He waved it around above his head until it\
  \ ignited. For a moment, the fighters retreated.</p> \n    <p>He laughed loudly.\
  \ The light from the fire arrow cast shadows on his face, turning him into something\
  \ less than human. The instant of their hesitation would be short. He flung the\
  \ arrow directly at the officer, forcing him to dance back.</p> \n    <p>In the\
  \ confusion, Rorr stepped into the forest, found a trail, and fell into a ground-devouring\
  \ stride. The brigands were slower following, giving him the chance to pop into\
  \ a clearing, get his bearings off the rising sun, then strike out directly for\
  \ his own horse.</p> \n    <p>He stepped up into the saddle and wheeled the mount\
  \ around just as three pursuers burst out of the woods after him. Rorr had no reason\
  \ to fight them. They were without horses, at least until they tracked them down.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>His heels raked the horse's flanks and set it galloping in the direction\
  \ of his farm.</p> \n    <p>This skirmish was not a battle. The true battle would\
  \ come when Lord Suvarian learned of his men's failure. Rorr had to prepare his\
  \ family for the final fracas. Either they would defeat Suvarian, or Rorr and his\
  \ family would die.</p> \n    <p>He put his head down and rode faster for his farm.</p>\
