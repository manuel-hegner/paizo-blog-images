| summary  = Dond Oom is a half elf of Garundi descent. He has warm brown skin, pointed ears that protrude from the loose curls of his jet black hair, and brown eyes. He’s dressed in elaborate, finely tailored clothing, including a finely made tunic under an embroidered vest as well as well-made trousers tucked neatly into mid-calve boots. Over his vest, he has a navy blue long-coat. In one hand, he has a fan of playing cards (he’s a gambler by trade), and in the other, he has a wide-bladed shortsword that has a hint of magic running up and down the blade, flowing from his hand.
