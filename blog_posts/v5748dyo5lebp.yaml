  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Wow, it's 2013 already! The past year\
  \ has been a good one for Pathfinder Society Orgainzed Play in many regards. With\
  \ all the changes that have taken place, as well as the goals set for the future,\
  \ I thought it was important to give a report of how last year has played out.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>First, and most importantly, I want to thank all of the Venture-Captains\
  \ and Venture-Lieutenants, regional and convention coordinators, GMs, and people\
  \ I use as sounding boards (you know who you are). Without all of you, I would not\
  \ be able to achieve everything listed below and make Pathfinder Society as great\
  \ as it is. I also want to thank all of our players and fans. Without you, I wouldn't\
  \ have an awesome job to come to each morning. So, thank you from the bottom of\
  \ my heart for all of your efforts and support.</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign has already seen numerous positive improvements and changes. Here is\
  \ a short list of things we've accomplished together in 2012:</p> \n    <ul>\n \
  \    <li>The recruitment and assignment of more than 175 new <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants</a> to help us grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ by having a Paizo 'face' in many local areas. These include new regions in new\
  \ countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,\
  \ South Africa, and Turkey. </li> \n     <li>A complete overhaul to the <a href=\"\

  \ to <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/faq\">the FAQ (red updates!)</a> and <a href=\"\

  \ updates. The complete list of updates can be downloaded with the new version of\
  \ the Guide or found on the messageboards. A few highlights include:</li> \n   \
  \  <ul>\n      <li>Page 10: Added the following under the religion entry: \"Druids,\
  \ oracles, and rangers are the exception to this rule. The list is not exhaustive,\
  \ and divine spellcasters of any future classes whose sources are added as additional\
  \ resources to the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign will be required to\
  \ choose a deity unless otherwise specified.\"</li> \n      <li>Page 22: Reworded\
  \ the note regarding First Steps for clarity, and added a sentence advising that\
  \ Prestige Points be awarded after playing each part of the First Steps series.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Pages 27—28: Changed the name of the section \"Retirement and Beyond\"\
  \ to \"Beyond Level 11.\" Reworded the section for clarity and added the special\
  \ title of Seeker for any Pathfinder agent who has achieved 12th level.</li> \n\
  \      <li>Page 28: Added Campaign Service Award Coins to the items that offer free\
  \ rerolls.</li> \n      <li>Pages 35: Changed the text in the Table Variance section\
  \ to allow GMs more flexibility and better adjudication at their tables.</li> \n\
  \      <li>Page 47: Added an index.</li>\n     </ul>\n    </ul> \n    <p>We've addressed\
  \ our leadership, our organization, our ground game, and our rules. And we couldn't\
  \ have done any of it without all of you.</p> \n    <p>All that is great, but it's\
  \ not enough. We're not done yet (which means that we all have more work to do).\
  \ I'm excited about the future of the Society. In particular, the following items\
  \ on my now-less-than-secret to-do list excite me:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ <li>Continuing to highlight international Pathfinder Society play through monthly\
  \ blog posts.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>The last year has been a great learning experience\
  \ for me as Pathfinder Society continually evolves and improves. There have been\
  \ some bumps in the road, but nothing that has proven insurmountable. I already\
  \ knew that the Pathfinder Society community is smart, diverse, and very passionate.\
  \ It is amazing how much energy and enthusiasm you all have for the game and it\
  \ is very inspiring. Likewise, the people here at Paizo are some of the most creative\
  \ and different-thinking people I've ever met. It's as amazing as you'd think it\
  \ was.</p> \n    <p>I will finish with letting everyone know that I will continue\
  \ to do the best job I possibly can to help Pathfinder Society grow and improve.\
  \ Sometimes I will make mistakes. But, if I do make a mistake, I will own up to\
  \ it. As always, I am available for all of you to reach out to me with concerns,\
  \ criticisms, thoughts, suggestions, venting, and ideas via email, private message,\
  \ Skype, phone call, carrier pigeon, written letter, <i>message</i> spell, pony\
  \ express, <i>contact other plane</i> spell, or <i>sending</i> spell.</p> \n   \
