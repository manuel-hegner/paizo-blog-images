  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Unveiling the Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition Gamemastery Guide!</p> \n     <p>As the Game Master of a Pathfinder campaign,\
  \ you’re the architect of your players’ adventures—a rewarding but sometimes challenging\
  \ responsibility. With this book, your job just got a whole lot easier! Whether\
  \ you’re building your own monsters and adventures, looking for new subsystems to\
  \ play out cinematic chases or tense infiltrations, or simply want to speed up your\
  \ game with scores of NPCs ready for action, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide\"\
  ><i>Gamemastery Guide</i></a> has you covered!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"Pathfinder second edition gamemastery guide\"></a> \n     </div> \n    \
  \ <p>The focus of every Pathfinder game is the players—their characters are the\
  \ stars of the show and appear in every scene that plays out in game. But what about\
  \ those scenes? What stories are being told? What old legends are being discovered,\
  \ and what new ones are being forged? Who are the villains, the allies, the traitors,\
  \ the lovers, the monsters, and the gods? Who runs the world? When you’re the Game\
  \ Master, that’s all up to you!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <h2>Chapter 1: Gamemastery Basics</h2> \n     <p>The role\
  \ of a GM can be complex, challenging, and sometimes difficult, but ultimately rewarding.\
  \ Luckily, you’re not on your own! Not only will the other players at your game\
  \ table help you tell collaborative stories, but you can use the advice here to\
  \ make your games run more smoothly and feel more exciting.</p> \n     <p>Inside\
  \ you’ll find guidance on Running Encounters, Running Exploration, Running Downtime,\
  \ Adjudicating Rules, Resolving Problems, Narrative Collaboration, Special Circumstances,\
  \ Rarity in Your Game, Campaign Structure, Adventure Design, Encounter Design, and\
  \ Drawing Maps.</p> \n     <h2>Chapter 2: Tools</h2> \n     <p>While the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>\
  \ provides all the tools you need to be a Game Master, you may want resources to\
  \ create original game content, whether it be new items, unique creatures, or a\
  \ sprawling new world for adventurers to explore.</p> \n     <p>Inside you’ll find\
  \ tools for Building Creatures, Building Hazards, Building Items, Item Quirks, Intelligent\
  \ Items, Cursed Items, Relics, Artifacts, Gems and Art Objects, Afflictions, Building\
  \ Worlds, Nations, Settlements, and Planes.</p> \n     <h2>Chapter 3: Subsystems</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>When your game goes into uncharted territory or you want to emphasize\
  \ an element of gameplay that usually gets overlooked or condensed into a single\
  \ check, you can use a subsystem. As the name implies, subsystems are extensions\
  \ of the main rules system that allow you to explore a particular topic or style\
  \ of play at your table.</p> \n     <p>You’ll find subsystems for Victory Points,\
  \ Influence, Research, Chases, Infiltration, Reputation, Duels, Leadership, Hexploration,\
  \ and Vehicles</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022420_GMGToC02.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022420_GMGToC02.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Chapter 4: Variant Rules</h2> \n     <p>While\
  \ the rules presented in the Core Rulebook are designed to give you and your group\
  \ a baseline experience that’s easy to learn and fun to play, sometimes you’re looking\
  \ for more customizable options. That’s where variant rules come in: options to\
  \ alter the game’s rules to fit your needs. This chapter adds a collection of variant\
  \ rules to your toolbox, often with additional options for how to use them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You’ll find variant rules on Ability Score Variants, Alignment Variants,\
  \ Deep Backgrounds, Feats and Features, Level 0 Characters, Magic Item Variants,\
  \ Proficiency without Level Skill Points, and Stamina.</p> \n     <h2>Chapter 5:\
  \ NPC Gallery</h2> \n     <p>Monsters and PCs aren’t the only inhabitants of your\
  \ world. Though they might not be heroes, NPCs can play various roles in your game,\
  \ such as calling PCs to adventure, serving as obstacles in social encounters, or\
  \ opposing PCs in battle. This chapter presents almost a hundred NPCs for your game,\
  \ plus rules to modify them to fit any particular niche.</p> \n     <p>You’ll find\
  \ a gallery of Courtiers, Criminals, Devotees, Downtrodden, Explorers, Foresters,\
  \ Healers, Laborers, Magistrates, Mercenaries, Mystics, Officers, Performers, Publicans,\
  \ Scholars, Seafarers, Tradespeople, and Villains.</p> \n     <p><b>To learn more,\
