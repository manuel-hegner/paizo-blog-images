  description\"><p>The release of <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywe\"><i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Mythic Adventures</i></a> is looming ever nearer, and I know a lot of you are\
  \ champing at the bit to get your hands on this tome of unearthly powers and epic\
  \ storytelling! But we at Paizo knew you wouldn’t be satisfied with just one book\
  \ on mythic power—even a 256-page behemoth like this will only sate the diehard\
  \ Pathfinder fan’s hunger for so long. That is why, esteemed reader, we are also\
  \ giving you <a href=\"/products/btpy90q7\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Mythic\
  \ Realms</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy90qd\"><i>Pathfinder Player Companion:\
  \ Mythic Origins</i></a>, which bring the majesty of mythic might off of the page\
  \ and into the world of Golarion!</p></span> \n     <p>I’ll let Mark tell you all\
  \ about <i>Mythic Realms</i> in another blog post—what I’m here to tell you about\
  \ is <i>Mythic Origins</i>, the book designed to provide your player character with\
  \ the mighty powers and abilities of such storied figures as Old-Mage Jatembe, the\
  \ Whispering Tyrant, and even the God-Kings of Ancient Osirion! This Player Companion\
  \ is full of all sorts of information pertinent to mythic heroes, including details\
  \ on what it means to be the son or daughter of one of Golarion’s deities, new mythic\
  \ versions of Inner Sea-specific spells, and entirely new mythic spells and magic\
  \ items. But I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the path abilities—oh, the path\
  \ abilities! No matter your character’s creed, call, or code, there a power for\
  \ everyone in this volume, with abilities that allow archmages to travel the void\
  \ of space in a giant bubble and hierophants to leave entire fields of flora wherever\
  \ they walk. One of my personal favorites, however, is one that belongs to the champion—\
  the seven-league leap!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Seven-League Leap (Ex)</b>:\
  \ Your leap is so mighty that you defy gravity. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks\
  \ made to jump. The distance you can jump in a round is not limited by your movement\
  \ speed. If you are carrying no more than a light load, you can expend one use of\
  \ mythic power to make a powerful jump that lets you sail through the air. In order\
  \ to use this ability, you must be able to run in a straight line for 1 minute.\
  \ Any obstacles or impediments that prevent you from completing this sprint uninterrupted\
  \ prevent you from being able to use this ability, though the expenditure of mythic\
  \ power is not wasted. At the end of your 1-minute sprint, you attempt an Acrobatics\
  \ check and leap a distance up to half the check’s result in miles, rounded down\
  \ to the nearest mile (for example, an Acrobatics check result of 29 would allow\
  \ you to jump 14 miles). This trip takes 1 round per mile, and you reach a maximum\
  \ height at the apex of your arc equal to half the distance traveled. You do not\
  \ take falling damage from using this ability. You must have a clear arc of travel\
  \ to complete this jump; if you strike an obstacle mid-jump, you and the obstacle\
  \ each take a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 × the number of miles you\
  \ have left to travel. If this damage destroys the obstacle, you continue your jump;\
  \ otherwise, your jump comes to an end and you fall, taking falling damage as appropriate.\
  \ You cannot aim this leap accurately, and always land 50 to 5,000 feet (5d%) from\
  \ your intended destination.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Oh, and did I mention\
  \ that <i>Mythic Origins</i> is packed full of art for the mythic versions of our\
  \ most popular iconics? I’m talking about a fully steampunked-out Lirianne, battle-hardened\
  \ Alain, and a vulpine familiar who gets a fearsome makeover. Maybe it’s best if\
  \ I just let the art speak for itself. Check out Balazar riding his eidolon toward\
  \ the great and unknowable Mordant Spire in this illustration by Greg Opalinski!</p>\
