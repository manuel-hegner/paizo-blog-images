  \ \n   <p>In <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b7s\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Lords of Chaos</i></a>, James Jacobs describes the Abyss, its demon lords, and\
  \ special powers mortal characters can gain if they worship these evil beings. These\
  \ latter are called boons, the weakest of which are spell-like abilities, though\
  \ those powerful mortals who delve deep into this evil gain even stranger powers.\
  \ Access to the boons requires taking the Demonic Obedience feat.</p> \n   <p><b>Demonic\
  \ Obedience</b><br> You physically defile yourself, others, or holy objects in order\
  \ to prove your blasphemous devotion to a demon lord and gain special boons.<br>\
  \ <b>Prerequisites</b>: 3 ranks in Knowledge (planes), must worship a demon lord.<br>\
  \ <b>Benefit</b>: Each demon lord requires a different obedience, but all obediences\
  \ take only an hour to perform. Once the obedience has been performed, you gain\
  \ the benefit of a resistance to some element or attack associated with your demon\
  \ lord, as indicated in the \"Obedience\" entry for the demon lord.<br> If you have\
  \ at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your demon lord\
  \ upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain\
  \ the demon lord's second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the\
  \ demon lord's third and final boon. Unless a specific duration is listed, a boon's\
  \ effects are constant.<br> If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose\
  \ all access to resistances and boons granted by this feat until you next perform\
  \ the obedience.<br></p> \n   <p>Here are just a couple of boons from the more than\
  \ 30 demon lords presented in the book.</p> \n   <p><b>Abraxus</b>:<br> <b>1st boon:\
  \ Secret Lore (Sp)</b> <i>identify</i> 3/day, <i>augury</i> 2/day, or <i>illusory\
  \ script</i> 1/day<br> <b>2nd boon: Heretical Revelation (Su)</b> Up to three times\
  \ per day, you can whisper terrible secrets to an adjacent target as a standard\
  \ action. The target can resist with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma\
  \ modifier). If the target fails its save, it is stunned for 1 round, then confused\
  \ for 1d4 rounds, and then nauseated for 2d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br>\
  \ <b>3rd boon: Penultimate Incantation (Sp)</b> Up to three times per day, you can\
  \ affect a single creature within 60 feet with a targeted greater dispel magic.\
  \ Each spell or effect dispelled inflicts fire damage to the target equal to the\
  \ result of your caster level check made to dispel that effect.</p> \n   <p><b>Pazuzu</b>:<br>\
  \ <b>1st boon: Whispers on the Wind (Sp)</b> <i>charm person</i> 3/day, <i>enthrall</i>\
  \ 2/day, or <i>fly</i> 1/day<br> <b>2nd boon: Possession (Sp)</b> You can cast <i>magic\
  \ jar</i> once per day as a spell-like ability. You can use a holy symbol of Pazuzu\
  \ or a statue of Pazuzu as your receptacle—if you do so, you can determine the exact\
  \ creature type and position of all potential life forces you're capable of possessing.<br>\
  \ <b>3rd boon: True Temptation (Sp)</b> If any creature speaks Pazuzu's name aloud\
  \ three times with a single breath, and that creature is within 60 feet of you,\
  \ you can cast quickened <i>charm monster</i> on that creature as an immediate action.\
  \ You can use this power up to three times per day. Creatures with fly speeds take\
  \ a –4 penalty on saves against this effect. If a creature that fails its save against\
  \ this effect has <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar effect activated, that\
  \ effect is immediately and automatically dispelled.</p> \n   <p>As for what the\
  \ actual obediences are, you'll have to just wait and see....</p> \n   <p>Sean K\
