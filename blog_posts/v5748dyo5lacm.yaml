  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 11, 2009</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PAIZOCON</a> is tomorrow! The massive <a href=\"/paizocon/events\">event schedule</a>\
  \ lists all of the awesome activities attendees can expect to take part in, but\
  \ here are some of the real gems that I'm looking forward to:</p> \n   <p>As I mentioned\
  \ in Tuesday's \"Countdown to PAIZOCON\" blog, guests and Paizo staff will have\
  \ the opportunity to wine and dine together during Saturday's banquet. One of the\
  \ reasons I'm most excited about the banquet is the opportunity to meet fellow Paizonians.\
  \ Having gotten to know so many of you on the messageboards, it will be fun to finally\
  \ meet some of you face-to-face! In addition to Publisher Erik Mona's preview of\
  \ upcoming Pathfinder products and CEO Lisa Steven's keynote address, attendees\
  \ can expect one very special surprise. I can't say what it is (under pain of death),\
  \ but you all should be very excited!</p> \n   <p>One of the neatest things about\
  \ PAIZOCON is the myriad opportunities to get the inside scoop on Pathfinder, Paizo,\
  \ and the old days at TSR. Between “The Pathfinder RPG and the Future of Paizo\"\
  \ on Friday, and \"What's New with Pathfinder?\", \"Secrets of TSR Revealed!\",\
  \ and the \"Pathfinder Fiction Discussion\" on Saturday, guests should expect to\
  \ get firsthand knowledge about the juicy details of the publishing industry, as\
  \ well as an exciting look at all of the goodies (and there are many!) that Paizo\
  \ will be working on in the near future. I plan on attending as many of these seminars\
  \ as I can!</p> \n   <p>Speaking of seminars, there are a <i>ton</i> about how to\
  \ begin writing for RPGs and break into the game industry. Here's a brief list of\
  \ some of the seminars that I hope to attend myself: \"How To Break Into Print in\
  \ Kobold Quarterly,\" \"Designing Dungeons with Monte Cook,\" \"Secrets of the Publishing\
  \ Industry—Your Questions Answered,\" \"Pathfinder Society Open Call Workshop,\"\
  \ \"Build a Pathfinder Society Scenario with Sue Cook and Joshua J. Frost,\" and\
  \ \"Game Design Self-Editing Workshop by Sue Cook.\"</p> \n   <p>Finally (and perhaps\
  \ best of all) expect to play lots and lots of games. Pathfinder Society scenarios\
  \ will be run every day throughout the convention, and special events such as Sean\
  \ K Reynold's \"Into the Scarlet Monastery\" (a Pathfinder RPG rendition of one\
  \ of the most iconic dungeons of the most iconic MMO), Jason Bulmahn's \"Fight Club\"\
  \ (wherein you characters will be brutally savaged by monsters), and master of horror\
  \ James Jacobs's \"Unspeakable Futures\" (a Pathfinder RPG variant set in an apocalyptic\
  \ earth ravaged by the Elder Mythos) are sure to be crowd pleasers. I might even\
  \ have to sit in and watch some of these games being played—they sound that awesome.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I've quickly run out of space in my excitement to tell you about the ridiculously\
  \ fun things to expect at PAIZOCON, so I'll end with this:</p> \n   <p>PAIZOCON\
  \ is tomorrow baby! WOOT!</p> \n   <p>David Eitelbach <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n\
