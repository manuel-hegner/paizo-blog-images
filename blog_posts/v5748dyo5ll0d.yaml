  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">So we've put a wrap on Gen Con 2018 and are\
  \ already talking about 2019! Once again the Sagamore Ballroom rang to the sound\
  \ of games, this time in three different systems - Pathfinder, Starfinder, and Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest. We had a special during each evening slot, accompanied by awesome visual\
  \ maps put together by Paizonian Andrew White. The presentation for <a href=\"/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</i></a> by Mike Kimmel,\
  \ featured the vocal talents of editor Jason Keely and customer service rep Sam\
  \ Phelan blended together through the mastery of Ben Loomes of Syrinscape. I highly\
  \ recommend checking it out!</p> \n    <p>If you prefer your interactives traveling\
  \ to distant star systems, I recommend <a href=\"/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a>, by Mikko\
  \ Kallio. Debuting at Origins and with repeat runs at PaizoCon UK and Gen Con, it\
  \ mixes ship combat and tactical adventure in a must-play story that pivots the\
  \ action from Season 1 and sets up the events of Season 1A.</p> \n    <p>John departs\
  \ in a couple weeks for DragonCon in Atlanta, while I have a week longer at home\
  \ base and then am off for SkalCon. We are currently looking at travel for 2019\
  \ and setting up the shows we will attend. If you are an organizer who wishes for\
  \ an organized play staffer to attend your show, please send an email to <a href=\"\
  mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with the show particulars,\
  \ including if you are able to assist with airfare/hotels/badges/meals. We are working\
  \ on a short timeline and need requests by <b>1 September 2018</b>.</p> \n    <h2>Volunteers</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>A huge thank you to all the GMs and HQ staffers who volunteered for our\
  \ conventions this year, both for the large scale shows like PaizoCon, Origins,\
  \ and Gen Con and the local events. Without you, there would be no Society, no game\
  \ rooms, and possibly no conventions. We appreciate your continued support and offer\
  \ up three cheers for your continued generosity of time and energy!</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ few final details need working out before we put out a call for PAX Unplugged,\
  \ but we will be looking for some assistance with that show.</p> \n    <h2>Pathfinder\
  \ Society GM Stars</h2> \n    <p>A cornerstone of the Pathfinder Society is the\
  \ Game Masters who To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which\
  \ at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as\
  \ run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach\
  \ 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time\
  \ and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly\
  \ appreciated.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Snowy Brierley</li> \n     <li>Brent Gass</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Kevin Baumann</li> \n     <li>Francis Webb</li> \n     <li>Stefan Rohde</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Matt Proctor</li> \n     <li>Geoffrey Peart</li> \n    </ul> \n   \
  \ <h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2> \n    <p>My travels over the past six weeks afforded\
  \ me several opportunities to award members of our community for going above and\
  \ beyond in their dedication and service to the Society. Each of these members has\
  \ been part of the venture officer community at some point, in some cases multiple\
  \ times. They founded areas, setting up games where there were none. Mentorship,\
  \ convention volunteer, organizer...just a few titles they've worn over the years.\
  \ A huge thank you to the following volunteers. We recognized their effort with\
  \ a coin and a new Organized Play number. For their effort and service on behalf\
  \ of their local communities and the Society at large, vivat!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \   </div> \n    <h2>Order of the Wayfinder</h2> \n    <p>Two years ago, we founded\
  \ a new award that recognized a top volunteer in the Organized Play community. Called\
  \ the Order of the Wayfinder, it is handed out once each year in recognition of\
  \ exceptional service to the Society as a whole. This year, we did not award a Paizo\
  \ volunteer of the year, choosing instead to wrap that award into the Order of the\
  \ Wayfinder, as many of the Volunteer of the Year recipients were also organized\
  \ play volunteers. The first recipient was <i>Bob Jonquet</i> for being a long term\
  \ Venture-Captain/Regional Venture-Coordinator and Gen Con lead. Last year, we recognized\
  \ <i>Alistair Rigg</i> for being a long term Venture-Captain (on two continents)\
  \ and maintaining the Warhorn catalog for both Pathfinder and Starfinder scenarios.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This year, during the Venture-Captain dinner at Gen Con, we announced\
  \ the third winner. Unfortunately, the recipient wasn't able to join us, so I swore\
  \ the room to secrecy until I could contact them. Several hours later, after a late\
  \ night (for them) Messenger conversation, I could announce the newest inductee\
  \ to the Order of the Wayfinder: <i>Auke Teeninga</i>!</p> \n    <p>Besides being\
  \ a Regional Venture-Captain, having joined the ranks of VC as part of the original\
  \ 13, Auke has spent hours behind the scenes streamlining event support, boon distribution,\
  \ and scenario requisition. His work, while not as visible as some volunteers, enables\
  \ thousands of events to receive their support in a timely manner. He watches over\
  \ the requests and makes sure they do not fall through the cracks. In addition,\
  \ he participates in a variety of Task Forces and liaisons with the other RVCs to\
  \ deliver a quality program. Thank you Auke, for all your efforts on behalf of Organized\
  \ Play!</p> \n    <h2>Starfinder Society Second Seekers</h2> \n    <p>Over the past\
  \ few months we've received emails about several characters achieving fame with\
  \ the Second Seekers [Luwasi Elsebo] faction. As Rising Stars in their faction,\
  \ they hope to achieve some level of renown. If you have such a character and are\
  \ interested in their continued ascension within the Starfinder Society, please\
  \ send their name, class, and a brief write-up, along with your organized play number\
  \ and their character number, to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Conventions</h2> \n    <p>The summer con rush is wrapping up, but the\
  \ list below shows there are still plenty of opportunities to attend conventions\
  \ and play Society games! All of the conventions on the list maintain some type\
  \ of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you\
  \ are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact\
  \ the local venture-officer for more information! If you know of a convention running\
  \ Society games that is not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me\
  \ at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss\
  \ their event.</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block indent\" style=\"width: 650px;\"\
