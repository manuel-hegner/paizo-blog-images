  \ Gods: Divine Servitors</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 22, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Well,\
  \ we've previously looked at the <a link to art blog>art</a>, <a link to deities\
  \ blog>deities</a>, and <a link to character options>character options</a> featured\
  \ in <i><a product page>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods</a></i>, and\
  \ now it's time to summon up our final preview blogâ€”a look at the 40 divine servitors\
  \ available to the faithful of the core deities via a number of calling spells.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Each of the core 20 deities receives two statblocks in the final chapter\
  \ of <i>Inner Sea Gods</i>, one its herald, and the other a lower-level outsider.\
  \ First let's look at a few of the new outsiders, shall we?</p> \n    <p>Up first\
  \ is the dapsara, a new angel closely tied to Shelyn, goddess of love, beauty, and\
  \ art. This CR 4 angel has bardic abilities, including bardic performance and versatile\
  \ performance, and should serve those who venerate the arts well.</p> \n    <div\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Diana Martinez \n    </div> \n  \
  \  <p>What could be more opposed to art and beauty than the qlippoth, the proto-demons\
  \ of the Abyss from which Rovagug ascended. Thognorok qlippoth, like the one depicted\
  \ here, are considered servitors of the Rough Beast, but are actually sentient symbiotes\
  \ that once had the misfortune of dining on Rovagug's flesh. As with all the lower-level\
  \ servitors in the book, Thognoroks are CR 4, has 6 HD, and can therefor be called\
  \ with <i>lesser planar ally</i> and/or <i>lesser planar binding</i>. Though I would\
  \ caution against trying with this guy.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Ben Wootten \n    </div> \n    <p>If a CR 4\
  \ outsider just isn't going to cut it for you, there's always each deity's herald.\
  \ <i>Inner Sea Gods</i> presents the herald subtype, which grant a uniform array\
  \ of abilities to these unique outsiders who serve as envoys and agents of their\
  \ patrons. Heralds generally have 18 or fewer Hit Dice, come in around CR 15, and\
  \ can be summoned with <i>greater planar ally</i>. Each of the heralds received\
  \ a new development pass, standardizing their abilities and upgrading those released\
  \ prior to the Pathfinder RPG up to the current rules set. Here's Asmodeus's herald,\
  \ the sinister and deadly Basiles, for your viewing pleasure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9267_Basileus.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Emeliano Petrozzi \n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>This fella, however, breaks the herald mold, which is befitting of the herald\
  \ of the god who motivated Sarenrae and Asmodeus to work together to imprison him.\
  \ I'm talking, of course, about the Tarrasque, also known as the Armageddon Engine,\
  \ herald of Rovagug. Not only does the version presented in <i>Inner Sea Gods</i>\
  \ include the herald and spawn of Rovagug subtypes (resulting in different stats\
  \ than the world-neutral version in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>), it keeps\
  \ the original's CR 25, making it by far the most dangerous of the heralds presented\
  \ in the book.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9267_Terrasque.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Ben Wootten \n    </div> \n    <p>And\
  \ there you have it, folks! By the time another one of these previews would go up,\
  \ most of you will have your copies of the book, so I'll move on to previewing other\
  \ forthcoming books. <i>Inner Sea Gods</i> is available in game stores everywhere\
  \ and can be purchased as a hardcover or PDF download right <a link to product page>here</a>.</p>\
