  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s strange\
  \ how quickly a life-changing period spanning years can be replaced by what was\
  \ once normal. Droven was certainly happy to be back in the field undertaking a\
  \ Pathfinder mission again, and even happier to have an opportunity to deploy some\
  \ of the gadgets and weaponry he’d created during his long exodus in Arcadia. He’\
  d even lent his latest weapon, a gun that could create portals, to his partner for\
  \ the exercise, a clever halfling freelancer from Cheliax who’d come highly recommended\
  \ by a fellow Pathfinder.</p> \n      <p>The mission itself was fairly simple. There\
  \ were reports of a large wolf or canine monster attacking travelers and caravans\
  \ on the road between Absalom and Otari, a small port town on the western half of\
  \ the Isle of Kortos. It was almost too simple, and in another place and time, the\
  \ Pathfinder Society likely wouldn’t have sent a veteran agent still settling in\
  \ after a long and dangerous journey abroad, but Otari was home to several friends\
  \ of the Society, and perhaps just as relevant, it often served as a secondary destination\
  \ for shipments too valuable to the wrong people to bring in through Absalom’s more\
  \ closely watched ports.</p> \n      <p>So here Droven found himself, his entertaining\
  \ companion playing a tune as they walked the forested highway on their way to Otari.\
  \ As always, Whirp accompanied him, the quirky construct mostly doing what it was\
  \ designed to do, staying by Droven’s side so the half-orc could readily access\
  \ the tools it carried, but occasionally wandering off to examine a flower or dew\
  \ drop on a leaf. Droven had disassembled, reassembled, and repaired the goblin-shaped\
  \ construct countless times over the years, and he still had no explanation for\
  \ Whirp’s strange moments of seeming sapience, curiosity, and self-direction. There\
  \ was some magic interwoven with the clockwork devices that powered Whirp. Perhaps\
  \ over the years of journeying through Arcadia, Droven’s one-sided conversations\
  \ with the construct had made some impact on these arcane forces, granting Whirp\
  \ a tiny spark of personality. Droven still carried on these conversations. While\
  \ they drew the occasional odd look (once convincing a passing goblin to join in\
  \ and look to their mechanical counterpart for a response that came in the form\
  \ of an awkward hug and offered crowbar) most of Droven’s friends and peers had\
  \ grown used to them and occasionally spoke to Whirp themselves.</p> \n      <center>\n\
  \       <hr width=\"50%\">\n      </center> \n      <br> \n      <p>On the evening\
  \ of their second day out from Absalom, they finally encountered the creature they’\
  d been sent to deal with. Droven was dozing by the fire, Whirp standing at his side\
  \ and staring intently at an owl perched in the branches above, when their halfling\
  \ companion whispered magically into his ear from his own hiding spot. “Barghest!”\
  </p> \n      <p>Droven snapped awake; those years traveling on his own had sharpened\
  \ his mind and reflexes. Drawing his hammer and putting his back against a nearby\
  \ tree, he whispered back. “So not a wolf? Unfortunate.”</p> \n      <p>The same\
  \ calm that always accompanied moments of stress descended once more over Droven.\
  \ Later, when the fighting was done, his knees would shake and his eyes would water,\
  \ but for now he was fully in the moment, the fire of his orcish blood fueling his\
  \ analytical mind and sharpening his thoughts for the task at hand.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The barghest lurked just beyond the range of the firelight, its batlike ears\
  \ and hunched shoulders faintly backlit by the leaf-shrouded moon. Droven made a\
  \ mental note to recommend the halfling for future work; even his own eyes, capable\
  \ of navigating lightless tunnels and moonless nights with relative ease, could\
  \ barely make out the creature. Droven doubted he would have noticed the monster\
  \ had he been on watch, let alone correctly identified it under these conditions.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>He hoped their plan worked. Whirp was to leap in front of the\
  \ threat, then scurry through a portal created by the experimental gun he’d given\
  \ the halfling. Hopefully, the beast would follow Whirp through the portal, putting\
  \ itself right in line for a thunderous blow from Droven’s hammer. Of course, they’\
  d made the plan expecting a creature of animal intelligence, not a deadly fiend\
  \ capable of critical thought with its own repertoire of magic.</p> \n      <p>Before\
  \ Droven could propose a new tactic, Whirp began acting on the original plan Droven\
  \ had modified the little construct to perform.</p> \n      <p>“Whirrrrrp!”</p>\

  \ d'Alessandro from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a></h3>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n   \
  \   <p>Whether it was an intentional battle cry or merely the sound of the clockwork\
  \ gears rattling throughout his small frame, it nonetheless signaled the start of\
  \ the fight. Whirp’s body sparked for a moment before an explosive gout of flame\
  \ vented from his chassis, launching the construct directly in front of the barghest.\
  \ For Droven, an eternity seemed to pass as construct and barghest stared at one\
  \ another, though it was likely no more than a few seconds. With a second “Whirrrrrp,”\
  \ Droven’s clockwork companion lurched away, dashing through the woods as tools\
  \ clattered out of the compartment on its back. Droven made a mental note to add\
  \ a leather flap to the top of Whirp’s built-in toolbox even as he pressed tighter\
  \ against the tree, hoping the barghest had failed to notice him or had forgotten\
  \ him chasing after Whirp.</p> \n      <p>The plan worked to perfection. The halfling\
  \ opened a portal next to Droven’s hiding spot before opening another in front of\
  \ Whirp. As Whirp dashed through the eldritch opening, the barghest sped right behind\
  \ it. As Whirp exited, Droven swung, his hammer whistling above the construct’s\
  \ head even as the barghest’s snout cleared the portal. With a thunderous crunch,\
  \ the barghest popped back out of the entry portal, its head lolling weirdly on\
  \ a broken neck. Droven looked away from the barghest’s death throes, uninterested\
  \ in exposing himself to another creature’s agonized final moments, and nodded to\
  \ his halfling companion. A good plan, or at least an effective one, cleanly executed\
  \ without injury. As much as Droven would have liked to say, “without negative consequences,”\
  \ he realized that would be an inaccurate assessment. Somewhere scattered among\
  \ the leaves and roots of the roadside forest, Whirp had lost an expensive and worrisome\
  \ number of the inventor’s favorite tools.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"\
