  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Invisible and as silent as a church\
  \ fart, Twilp Farfan slipped through the sparse midday crowds of Sothis's Malhitu\
  \ Bazaar. Skulking in broad daylight always freaked the halfling out, but if he\
  \ didn't stir up too much dust or bump into anyone, his passage would go unnoticed.\
  \ Sothans tended to close up shop and nap in the blazing heat of the day, so there\
  \ weren't many people about.</p> \n     <p><em>All good for me.</em> He paused in\
  \ the shade of an awning and wiped his face. <em>All except the heat.</em></p> \n\
  \     <p>Twilp studied the blue-domed cupolas across the square and found the right\
  \ building. Two burly guards stood beside the beaded doorway of Kepeshka's Antiquities\
  \ Emporium. Sweat glistened on their ebony skin, their eyelids sagging, but each\
  \ rested a hand on a khopesh at his belt.</p> \n     <p><em>Nobody trusts anyone\
  \ these days.</em> Of course, that included Twilp. He didn't care who he stole for\
  \ or from, as long as the gold was yellow. In Sothis, gold was all that mattered,\
  \ and after the fall of the pyramids, there had been a glut of expensive antiquities\
  \ on the market, ripe for the picking. The halfling's gaze drifted up to Sothis's\
  \ looming Black Dome and the recently fallen pyramid beyond. The instant it hit\
  \ the ground, grave robbers had swarmed like ants over a fallen elephant. The very\
  \ trinket he was being paid to steal had come from that megalithic monstrosity.\
  \ Twilp didn't know what was so important about this particular bauble anyway; a\
  \ dagger was a dagger as far as he was concerned. But gold...</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ ground-floor windows were girded with ornate iron latticework, and the sheer walls\
  \ defied even the deftest climber. Twilp edged around the square and up to the bead-curtained\
  \ doorway. The guards blinked lazily, half asleep. The burglar eased down to the\
  \ ground and squirmed quietly beneath the curtain.</p> \n     <p>Good thing I'm\
  \ skinny. He rose up inside and scanned the showroom. A woman sat behind a counter,\
  \ idly polishing a lamp. Twilp grinned. Now for the prize.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     <p>Upstairs, he found the merchant's bedroom. Two more guards stood at\
  \ the door, which gaped to allow the breeze to circulate. They didn't even twitch\
  \ when he slipped past them. Gauzy curtains billowed, the Black Dome and pyramid\
  \ looming beyond. Some said everything from the inside of the fallen pyramid was\
  \ cursed, but Twilp didn't believe it. Gold was the only thing he believed in.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Twilp tore his eyes away from the view, and skulked over to the merchant's\
  \ bed. Big enough for six, it currently accommodated only three: the merchant, Lorisi\
  \ Kepeshka, and two comely men, husbands or toys. Sweat glistened on their skin\
  \ like the luster of precious metal. <em>Like gold</em>... The dagger hung from\
  \ the headboard above Kepeshka's tousled black hair, worth enough to keep Twilp\
  \ happy for months.</p> \n     <p>The halfling examined the serpent hilt and pommel,\
  \ its fanged head and ruby eyes. Gaudy. As his fingers curled around the scaled\
  \ hilt, however, the dagger's eyes came alight.</p> \n     <p>\"Hello, little thief.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Twilp jerked his hand away, unsure for a moment if he'd heard the\
  \ voice with his ears or in his head. His client, Lady Nikiri, hadn't told him it\
  \ was haunted. <em>Doesn't matter.</em> As he reached again, a bead of sweat fell\
  \ from his brow and plopped down right between Lorisi Kepeshka's eyes.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Twilp froze.</p> \n     <p>She stirred, one hand reaching up to wipe the\
  \ drop away, her eyes blinking open. She stared right through the invisible burglar\
  \ for a moment, then looked up to the dagger. She sighed, smiled, and reached for\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p><em>Oh, no you don't!</em> Twilp grabbed for it, and their hands\
  \ touched the scabbarded weapon at the same instant.</p> \n     <p>\"Well, this\
  \ should be interesting,\" the voice said in his mind.</p> \n     <p>Lorisi Kepeshka's\
  \ eyes flung wide. \"Thief!\"</p> \n     <p>Crap! Twilp jerked the dagger out of\
  \ her grasp, and the weapon became invisible.</p> \n     <p>\"The dagger! Thief!\"\
  \ Kepeshka's bedmates lurched up, and the door guards burst in, swords drawn.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Kill her!\" the voice said in Twilp's head. \"Use me!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p><em>Bugger off!</em> Twilp backed away.</p> \n     <p>\"Someone took the dagger!\"\
  \ Kepeshka vaulted out of bed. \"They're invisible! Block the door and sweep the\
  \ room!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Is that any way to talk to someone who can make you a\
  \ god?\" the voice of the dagger asked.</p> \n     <p><em>You can hear my thoughts?</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Yes, and read your greedy little soul, Twilp Farfan.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p><em>Great. Now shut up; I'm busy!</em> He clipped the dagger to his belt and\
  \ dashed for the window.</p> \n     <p>\"Wait! Aren't you going to kill her? You\
  \ really should, you know.\"</p> \n     <p><em>I'm a burglar, not an assassin.</em>\
  \ Twilp leapt and tore through the gauzy curtains.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, but her life\
  \ force can be yours! I can give it to you!\"</p> \n     <p><em>I don't want it.</em>\
  \ The burglar hit a canvas awning and slid. Anyone heavier would have torn right\
  \ through, but Twilp didn't. \"But it'll make you powerful, invulnerable, immortal!\"\
  </p> \n     <p><em>Don't particularly want those either.</em> He flipped off the\
  \ awning into the street, bowling down a man carrying a basket of flatbread.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What kind of mortal are you?\" The dagger sounded incredulous.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>The kind who likes his life the way it is. Now shut up.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Thief!\" Kepeshka screeched from the window, pointing right at him.\
  \ \"Guards! After that thief!\"</p> \n     <p>The two ground-floor guards drew their\
  \ swords and advanced.</p> \n     <p>Twilp now understood why Lady Nikiri wanted\
  \ the dagger. Denied the political power of her elder siblings, married to a lesser\
  \ house, and now aging and bitter, the lure of power and immortality would be irresistible\
  \ to her.</p> \n     <p><em>I'll settle for gold.</em> Twilp dashed up the street.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Coward,\" the dagger chided.</p> \n     <p>Twilp ignored it and ran.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"There!\" one of the guards bellowed.</p> \n     <p>Twilp glanced back\
  \ and saw the puffs of dust where his feet touched the street. They'd spotted him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The burglar dodged under awnings, over, around, and under displays of\
  \ goods, but they were hot on his heels, their longer legs doubling his best speed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Kill them! I'll make you a god!\"</p> \n     <p><em>And deal with\
  \ all that religion crap? No thanks!</em> Twilp sprinted past the auction houses\
  \ and into the Rose Quarter, trying to keep the dust of his passage down, but to\
  \ no avail.</p> \n     <p>\"There!\" The guards were right on him.</p> \n     <p>Desperate,\
  \ Twilp dodged into Wimiri's Bathhouse.</p> \n     <p>\"Look! Footprints!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Twilp glanced back at his dusty tracks on the otherwise spotless tile\
  \ floor. Damn!</p> \n     <p>\"Kill them!\" the dagger screamed.</p> \n     <p><em>Shut\
  \ up!</em> The halfling dodged through a doorway and skidded to a stop inches before\
  \ falling into a sunken bath crowded with chatting women sipping cool drinks. The\
  \ guard chasing him wasn't so dexterous.</p> \n     <p>The man slammed into Twilp's\
  \ back, and they both plunged into the bath. Twilp's head cracked the bottom of\
  \ the shallow pool hard enough to stun him. He thrashed to the surface, women screaming,\
  \ and a meaty fist closed on the neck of his jerkin.</p> \n     <p>\"Got you, little\
  \ thief!\" The guard lifted him, raising his khopesh.</p> \n     <p>\"Kill him!\"\
  \ the dagger bellowed in his mind. \"Use me! It's your only chance!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>For once, Twilp agreed. He had to get free, and the blade hung at his belt.\
  \ He drew it and stabbed the man's elbow.</p> \n     <p>\"YES!\"</p> \n     <p>Crimson\
  \ light flooded the bath. The dagger's blade shone like a flaming ruby, pulsing\
  \ with life as it pierced the guard's arm. The man drew a startled breath, eyes\
  \ wide, not in pain, but in terror.</p> \n     <p>Flesh shriveled on the guard's\
  \ bones, blood, life, and for all Twilp knew, his soul sucked away into the blade...and\
  \ into Twilp. The dried husk of flesh crumbled, and the halfling hit the water.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The bathers erupted in panic, thrashing to get away from the spreading\
  \ pall of ashes in the water.</p> \n     <p>\"There, now.\" The dagger sounded satisfied.\
  \ \"Feel better?\"</p> \n     <p>Twilp <em>did</em> feel better, his pain gone,\
  \ his head clear, and he fairly bristled with energy. He felt like he could do anything,\
  \ like he would live forever.</p> \n     <p>\"And you can,\" the dagger assured\
  \ him. \"Every life you take with me will make you greater.\"</p> \n     <p>Twilp\
  \ thought of it, immortality, power, riches, the helpless bathers fleeing around\
  \ him, and almost puked. He thrashed out of the water and invoked the magic of his\
  \ ring again, blinking into invisibility. Sheathing the dagger and snatching up\
  \ a towel, he slipped out of the bathing room, avoiding the panicked patrons. The\
  \ voice of the dagger rang in his head, urging him to sheath it in flesh, to drink\
  \ their lives.</p> \n     <p>Quelling the temptation to become a god, Twilp crept\
  \ into another wing of the establishment. Sheltered alcoves, each with a lidded\
  \ commode, lined a wall beneath narrow windows.</p> \n     <p><em>Perfect!</em>\
  \ Twilp hopped up onto a bench and lifted the lid at his feet.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  What are you <em>doing</em>?\"</p> \n     <p>He thought about what the dagger had\
  \ promised him, and what someone like Lady Nikiri would do with it. The gold she\
  \ had promised him suddenly seemed stained with blood.</p> \n     <p>Twilp drew\
  \ the dagger.</p> \n     <p>\"What are you doing?!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Saving my soul,\
  \ you filthy piece of crap.\" Twilp held it over the dark pit.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  DON'T!\"</p> \n     <p>Twilp released his grip and watched the blade's red glow\
  \ vanish into the depths. With a wet plop, the crimson light winked out. Hundreds\
  \ of patrons would bury the weapon deeper. Nobody would ever dig it up.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Some treasures are better left buried.\" Twilp clambered up the wall to\
  \ slip through the narrow window into the fresh air. \"And some things are worth\
  \ more than gold.\"</p> \n     <p>Chris A. Jackson<br> <i>Contributing Author</i></p>\
