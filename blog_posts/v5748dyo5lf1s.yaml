  \ 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>In\
  \ another week we will see the newest version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  ><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i></a>, the document that lays out\
  \ the baseline rules, assumptions, and adjustments for playing in the organized\
  \ play campaign. Over the past few months, whether by podcast, convention panel,\
  \ or cryptic response to a forum post, Mike and I have hinted at many of the updates.\
  \ By now, for example, practically everyone knows about the disappearance of the\
  \ Lantern Lodge and Shadow Lodge. The new format for Pathfinder Tales novel boons\
  \ has been available for download for several months. We even spoiled the new system\
  \ for wealth and \"playing up\" during a panel at PaizoCon a few weeks ago. There\
  \ is, however, at least one thing that we have not teased: Replay.</p></span> \n\
  \    <p>Already I can hear the hissed intake of breath from some worried readers.\
  \ We've read, heard, and sometimes even personally made the argument that replay\
  \ opens the door to myriad forms of abuse. I agree that unlimited replay of more\
  \ than just Tier 1 scenarios and Tier 1-2 modules would be disruptive. I still remember\
  \ meeting a Pathfinder Society player who proudly boasted that he and his group\
  \ had just run through <i>The Godsmouth Heresy</i> six times in the course of a\
  \ weekend simply to level-grind a host of characters to 2nd level. Campaign leadership\
  \ has been very careful in exploring replay so that we might avoid classic pitfalls.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What tipped the balance for us was realizing that replay might also address\
  \ an ongoing push to expand rewards for GMs who have dedicated their time to the\
  \ campaign. In my estimation, most GMs who have at least one star have had to \"\
  eat\" a scenario by preparing and GMing it before having the chance to play it.\
  \ In my experience, those who habitually GM for organized play also have considerable\
  \ practice when it comes to suppressing personal knowledge. In my time as a volunteer\
  \ and employee, I find that those who GM first and play later are also among the\
  \ most dedicated to wanting the whole group to have fun and enjoy experiencing a\
  \ scenario without spoilers. That got the gears turning.</p> \n    <p>When Version\
  \ 5.0 of the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i> goes live, campaign\
  \ participants who have been recognized for their efforts as a GM by receiving GM\
  \ stars will be able to replay or \"re-GM\" a limited number of scenarios—specifically\
  \ one scenario for each star earned. In this way a participant may earn a third\
  \ Chronicle sheet from a given scenario: one for playing, one for GMing, and one\
  \ for either playing or GMing that scenario a second time. No character may ever\
  \ have two of the same Chronicle sheet, so one must apply each sheet to a different\
  \ character each time. When earning a third Chronicle in this way, the GM should\
  \ write \"GM Star Replay Credit\" on the Chronicle sheet.</p> \n    <p>Let's say\
  \ you're a two-star GM—thank you for your help, by the way. You can now replay or\
  \ re-GM (for credit, that is) two scenarios once each. Perhaps you thought <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #3–14159: Death by Pie</i> was amazing when you played it the\
  \ first time, but you are sad to have missed the opportunity to play it with your\
  \ pastry totem barbarian who took the mathematical prodigy trait. You replay it\
  \ for credit using one of your replay credits, and now you have one replay left.\
  \ If you later use that to replay <i>#5–513: The Doppelganger's Prey</i>, you are\
  \ now out of replays until you earn that third star. Only then would you be able\
  \ to replay <i>#4–117: All the Doors are Trapped</i> for credit.</p> \n    <p>At\
  \ this time, the Guide does not say anything about gaining more replay credits each\
  \ season. For now that's alright by me; let's see how this works for one season\
  \ before making promises about what will happen a year from now. As many as five\
  \ replays won't be enough to make a character completely unbalanced. Instead I envision\
  \ this being for those who have played/GMed almost everything, managed tables for\
  \ most of a convention, and saved the last slot to just play.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ may be other rewards tied to GM ties in the Guide, but we'll just have to wait\
  \ to see those when the new document goes live next week.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ and our iconic barbarian is trying to remind the wizard not to spoil what's about\
  \ to happen next for the other players. Ezren is just aghast that all of the other\
  \ characters put on the masks without first discovering the black lotus extract\
  \ smeared on the interiors. What a great (nonexistent) scenario...\n    </div> \n\
