  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>“Hey. You\
  \ up?” </em></p>\n      <p>Chk Chk’s antenna vibrated as he sent a telepathic message\
  \ to the group. He could have sensed Dae and Obozaya through their linked vitals,\
  \ but the whirl of the protection-class security robot’s gripper arm demanded his\
  \ focus. One moment he’d been chattering with Dae while feeling for secret panels\
  \ and inscriptions along the wall. The next thing he knew, a robot was waving mechanical\
  \ pincers in his face.</p>\n      <p>Chk Chk drew his painglaive and repositioned\
  \ himself further down the cramped corridor, away from the door. He wasn’t ready\
  \ for another battle. There had been no time to rest since Dae blasted the last\
  \ of the swarm of observer-class security robots that had chased them through the\
  \ (allegedly) abandoned space station’s corridors. Less than a minute ago, Obozaya\
  \ had slammed the butt of her rifle against an escape pod’s electronic lock. Percussive\
  \ maintenance, she’d said. Then the wall popped open and revealed two robots nestled\
  \ among the wiring—dormant, then jerking to life. Now one robot blocked Chk Chk’\
  s view of his friends with its hulking white chassis.</p>\n      <p>He stepped back\
  \ and thrust the painglaive between the machine and his body. The robot’s gripper\
  \ rhythmically spread and shut, a blunt claw smooth and heavy with thousands of\
  \ pounds of reserved force. Reserved for his delicate bones. His heel hit a wall,\
  \ bending polymer with his weight. Not stable enough to push off from, but solid\
  \ enough to pin him as that claw came for his throat.</p>\n      <p><em>“Chk Chk,\
  \ you can’t ask that! What will my fans think if this chat leaks?” </em>Dae’s lighthearted\
  \ response interrupted as he dodged to the side and away from the attack. Suddenly\
  \ Dae cut the theatrics: <em>“I’m up. Obo’s not.”</em></p>\n      <p>The answer\
  \ was obvious once Chk Chk took a second to scan their interconnected vital signs.\
  \ Dae pulsed with the rise and fall of the sun, while Obozaya’s vitality signs had\
  \ dulled and slowed. Still alive, but unconscious and wounded. He focused on Obozaya—\
  and the claw crushed his shoulder.</p>\n      <p>He tried to pull away, but it held\
  \ tight and squeezed. Pain exploded and pulsed down his upper arm. The robot stopped\
  \ crunching his carapace and raised him into the air. The mechanical groans deepened\
  \ with the effort of lifting him, but his path up remained smooth and constant.\
  \ As his feet left the ground, he kicked wildly at the robot’s metal chassis, hoping\
  \ to break something. Even in danger, the grunts of the machine reminded him of\
  \ a deep bass line somebody could dance to. Before he knew it, his foot was kicking\
  \ in time to the beat.</p>\n      <p>The pain in his shoulder escalated every moment\
  \ the claw grabbed him, spiking when he swung in its grasp. A crunch came from his\
  \ back. He screamed.</p>\n      <p>“Chk Chk!” screamed Dae’s outside voice. Their\
  \ pitch warbled higher and louder than normal, as though they were moving toward\
  \ them from far away at incredible speed.</p>\n      <p>And they were!</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Dae flew across the tiled floor at the speed of a meteorite impact, crashing\
  \ down in a halo of sparks and broken tile. Their sun-etched arm slammed into the\
  \ robot’s back. Hydraulics released with a hiss as Dae dragged it backward in an\
  \ explosion of gravity, ripping the air around Chk Chk and popping the sensors in\
  \ all his auxiliary antennae at once. The claw opened. Chk Chk fell. He grabbed\
  \ for a pipe jutting from the wall and missed, scrabbling at smooth metal with his\
  \ own weak claw, another keeping hold of his weapon.</p>\n      <p>He landed on\
  \ his back and floundered for a moment. If Dae kept this footage, he swore he’d\
  \ delete this scene later. But he was out of the robot’s agonizing grip, and at\
  \ last he could help. Obozaya, slumped in her armor, draped over the twitching body\
  \ of the other robot. Dae ripped the arm that had just crushed Chk Chk’s shoulder\
  \ out of his attacker in a spray of sparks, then waved it at the camera drone floating\
  \ overhead with a cheeky grin.</p>\n      <p>Chk Chk felt for Obo’s vitals. She\
  \ was safe and stable, but she still needed help. As he scrambled over tiles now\
  \ slippery with leaking oil, he popped his crumpled shoulder back into place. No\
  \ time to worry about that. A second shadow was forming under Obozaya where her\
  \ blood had pooled. Chk Chk’s bond showed him her injuries as though they had been\
  \ inflicted upon his own body.</p>\n      <p><em>Blunt force to the head</em>, he\
  \ assessed, <em>laceration on the forehead and possible concussion. </em></p>\n\
  \      <p>The edges of Obozaya’s shadow stretched toward him as he pulled her pain\
  \ into himself. His forehead stung until it felt wet with blood, though it was only\
  \ the transference of her suffering to him. The wound wasn’t real, but the pain\
  \ was. Meanwhile, Obozaya’s shadow trickled into her wounds. Flesh grew into scabs\
  \ and bone fused. Chk Chk sensed her pain vanish, felt the blood returning to her\
  \ numb limbs. His pain would heal his friend, so he could take it.</p>\n      <p>Obozaya’\
  s eyes shot open.</p>\n      <p>Her lungs opened with a gasp.</p>\n      <p>Chk\
  \ Chk held her gaze as the dull ache of a head injury melted away from her and into\
  \ him. Obozaya shifted upward, stood, and walked toward him. She loomed tall as\
  \ ever, but now he could sense her body was full of pain. Old injuries. New injuries.\
  \ But she always kept going. So would he.</p>\n      <p>“Chk Chk, you’re getting\
  \ sloppy,” she bellowed, though she ended with laugh. “Try to keep up!”</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Chk Chk smiled. He released the pain, laughing weakly at Obozaya’s cheerful\
  \ bravado. Time began again for him. During the fight, the world hung suspended.\
  \ No thoughts, no time to process his adrenaline response, nothing. Now, the exhaustion\
  \ crept into him, deeper than he expected.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;<em>“I’ll make it\
  \ up to you,” </em>he responded, too winded to speak.<em> “How about coffee?”</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>&nbsp;“Deal.” She said.</p>\n      <p>“Don’t forget me!” Dae added, barely\
  \ looking up from the robot they were assessing. “Remember, I drink graviton style.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Chk Chk smiled as he pulled his setup from his bag. Dae liked their\
  \ beans darker than a black hole with zero sweetness or additives, while Obo’s drink\
  \ of choice was a pepper-and-honey latte, heavy on the honey and steamed milk. As\
  \ he pulled out his gear, he tested his shoulder by rotating it in the socket. Sore,\
  \ but not unbearable. He’d apply a medpatch first, enjoy its anesthetic numbness\
  \ and sharp scent of peppercorns, then he could get to grinding.</p>\n      <p>Brewing\
  \ coffee in his tiny field press was one of his favorite tasks. He didn’t need to\
  \ perfectly execute the string of commands Raia taught him to jailbreak the deluxe\
  \ nanopress machines favored by most cafés. Here, he could tune out and slip into\
  \ the elegant simplicity of the ritual. Dae and Obozaya had already launched into\
  \ a post-mortem discussion of their break-in, analyzing the successful approach\
  \ followed by the accidental activation of hidden security robots, and ending in\
  \ a blow-by-blow commentary about the fight.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The\
  \ grinder growled as Chk Chk inhaled, halfway hearing their talk, which was more\
  \ technical than he ever wanted to delve. Why spend so much time trying to avoid\
  \ pain? He didn’t get it, but then again, Obozaya didn’t understand why he sought\
  \ out mosh pits. And after the dance, or the fight, his calming ritual was to unspool\
  \ the grinder, measure out and place the beans, then grind any excess adrenaline\
  \ into fine coffee for the press.</p>\n      <p>Brewing coffee contained the rhythm\
  \ of a song, with its precise timing and variety of sounds. Growls, plinks, and\
  \ drips kept the brew moving. Kept his friends going.</p>\n      <p>“Hey, Chk Chk.”\
  \ Obozaya interrupted his thoughts again, just as he started to visualize how this\
  \ moment would fit into a music video. “What happened back there? Did you get lost\
  \ or something?”</p>\n      <p><em>“I was distracted,” </em>he responded telepathically.\
  \ His throbbing shoulder grated at his attention, making speech undesirable. <em>“\
  It’s my fault. I ended up on the wrong side when the robots ambushed us.”</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>Dae cleared their throat, then looked down. Yeah, he had been too busy\
  \ joking with them to notice the robots lunge at him and Obozaya. A few more seconds\
  \ and they would’ve been a unified team when the robots popped out from their hiding\
  \ place.</p>\n      <p>No time to dwell on it. He tipped the beans into the press\
  \ and activated a quick-heat pouch of water. Perfect temperature in seconds. As\
  \ it warmed, he placed it over the med patch.</p>\n      <p>“I thought you priest\
  \ types were good at paying attention,” Obo kept talking, though her eyes were fixed\
  \ on the waiting press and its steady drip of coffee. “Try to keep that from happening\
  \ again.”</p>\n      <p>He nodded. The water was warm enough now, though he let\
  \ it linger on his shoulder for just a second longer. It poured into the upper chamber\
  \ of the coffee maker, then slowly dripped downward. He unscrewed the metal cups\
  \ from his mess set, added instant milk to one, and set them to self-heat. At the\
  \ bottom of his pouch was the bottle of syrup he made before setting out. An ounce\
  \ into the milk, and all that was left was to wait.</p>\n      <p>“Look at this,\
  \ bestie!” Dae said, interrupting his reverie by waving the robot arm in his face\
  \ to show off its twisting knotted snake logo. “Aspis parts.”</p>\n      <p>“You’\
  ll be Aspis parts if you knock the coffee over,” Obozaya grunted. “Good find, Dae.”\
  </p>\n      <p>The press pinged, quieting Dae and Obo with the promise it was finished.\
  \ Chk Chk poured two drinks, before he set to making his own. Black with a pinch\
  \ of glitter magically coaxed into color by the drinker’s current mood. It was his\
  \ favorite barista trick learned in Takoris. He brewed his coffee Fulldark black\
  \ with extra syrup, the surface swirled with shifting opalescent fire—the sheen\
  \ of Zon-Shelyn’s sacred gown, and the myriad colors of the Drift, or the colors\
  \ of his changing heart.</p>\n      <p>He sighed at the bitter aroma and sipped\
  \ sweet, warm comfort. Soon, they would all be back on their feet and charging through\
  \ the next door as a team. Until then, coffee.</p>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n\
