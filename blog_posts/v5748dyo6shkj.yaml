  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The <em>Pathfinder</em>\
  \ core rules contain 289 spells by our count. <em>Savage World Adventure Edition</em>\
  \ includes 54 powers. When it came time to figure out how to translate the expansive,\
  \ robust <em>Pathfinder</em> magic system to work in the smaller, dynamic <em>Savage\
  \ Worlds</em> power system, we had to boil everything down to their core.</p> \n\
  \     <p>As designers, one of the most useful tools we have is constraining the\
  \ problem. When you’re staring down the barrel of holding nearly three hundred spells\
  \ in your head all at once to figure out how to combine and represent them, it’\
  s too much for anyone to handle. But if we categorize these items and constrain\
  \ them to a pre-defined structure, they’re much more manageable.</p> \n     <p>What\
  \ do spells in Pathfinder accomplish? In general terms, we can assign all Pathfinder\
  \ spells up to three of the following trait categories (in order of how core that\
  \ trait is to the spell) and effectively summarize what they do: </p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>Deal Damage</li> \n      <li>Deal Damage in an Area</li> \n      <li>Heal</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Heal in an Area</li> \n      <li>Buff an Ally</li> \n      <li>Buff\
  \ Allies in an Area</li> \n      <li>Debuff an Enemy</li> \n      <li>Debuff Enemies\
  \ in an Area</li> \n      <li>Remove an Effect</li> \n      <li>Remove Effects in\
  \ an Area</li> \n      <li>Cause a Social Effect</li> \n      <li>Cause Social Effects\
  \ in an Area</li> \n      <li>Mimic the Usage of a Skill</li> \n      <li>An Impossible\
  \ Effect </li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Now that we’ve got everything grouped, we\
  \ can organize the spells into buckets. If we look at the spells that “Deal Damage”\
  \ or “Deal Damage in an Area,” the list trims down to 31 spells:</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5105298d-b7be-4b01-bf49-bad24c45829a/020921_31Damage\

  \ spells in an excel spreadsheet that deal damage or damage in an area\"></a>\n\
  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>That’s a lot less\
  \ to think about all at once! We grouped both damage traits because we know that\
  \ in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, our direct damage powers either damage everything in\
  \ an area already (<em>blast, burst, &amp; damage field</em>) or have a way to hit\
  \ multiple targets at once (<em>bolt</em>). Our next step is to figure out which\
  \ of those spells we can reproduce the effect of using our existing powers.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We need to understand our toolset to finish our work, so let us digress\
  \ for a moment and describe how powers work in <em>Savage Worlds</em>. Instead of\
  \ having spell slots of different levels, you have a pool of Power Points. Each\
  \ power has a listed cost you spend when you successfully activate that power (a\
  \ roll of four or greater on your arcane skill). In addition to the base cost, most\
  \ powers also have Power Modifiers that increase the power’s cost to give it extra\
  \ effects. They also have trappings: the narrative description of how the power\
  \ functions that the player defines when they gain the power.</p> \n     <p>For\
  \ example, the bread-and-butter direct damage power in <em>Savage Worlds</em> is\
  \ bolt. It costs one Power Point, shoots out at range, and deals a base of 2d6 damage.\
  \ It also has the Damage Power Modifier that increases our base damage by 1d6. Remember,\
  \ we don’t have hit points in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, so doing an extra d6 damage\
  \ at any point is a pretty good damage bump.</p> \n     <p>With trappings alone,\
  \ we can use bolt to mimic <em>call lightning, lightning bolt, magic missile</em>,\
  \ and <em>scorching ray</em>. Magic missile has many additional rules that tie into\
  \ Pathfinder’s specific systems, but otherwise is just like <em>bolt</em>; it’s\
  \ a ranged attack that hits a target to deal damage.</p> \n     <p><em>Scorching\
  \ ray</em> is more or less <em>bolt</em> with a fire trapping. Suppose we wanted\
  \ to fire multiple rays in a single round. Instead of using the baked-in rays per\
  \ four levels mechanic of <em>Pathfinder</em>, we’d leverage the Multi-Action economy\
  \ of <em>Savage Worlds</em> to cast our fire-trapping <em>bolt</em> up to three\
  \ times in a single round. And that’s before we use any new Power Modifiers from\
  \ our work-in-progress <em>Fantasy Companion</em>. Like Onslaught, that lets us\
  \ fire two <em>bolts</em> per activation. In the end, the list looked like this:</p>\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p><em>Cloudkill</em> is an\
  \ excellent example of how a mechanically complex spell can be re-created in <em>Savage\
  \ Worlds</em> using our Power Modifiers and trappings. It’s based on <em>damage\
  \ field</em>, which deals 2d4 damage to everyone adjacent to the caster by default.\
  \ Well, to start, <em>cloudkill</em> automatically kills creatures below three hit\
  \ dice, kills creatures from four to six hit dice on a failed save, and deals constitution\
  \ damage to anything with more than six hit dice.</p> \n     <p>In <em>Savage Worlds</em>,\
  \ 2d4 isn’t going to wipe out a lot of folks outright, so let’s up the damage to\
  \ 3d6 Heavy Damage using the new exalted Power Modifier, Greater Damage Field. Against\
  \ most Extras (minor NPCs like most goblins that tend to die quickly), that’s going\
  \ to be vicious, while our Wild Cards (player characters and tougher creatures)\
  \ will have a chance to get out unharmed.</p> \n     <p>The next piece of the puzzle\
  \ is the size of <em>cloudkill</em>. It’s a 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high cloud. The\
  \ Radius modifier expands our damage field to a Small Blast Template (that’s a 4-yard\
  \ diameter in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, about 12 feet across). Well, that’s smaller\
  \ than its <em>Pathfinder</em> cousin, so we can pause a moment and consider if\
  \ <em>damage field</em> needs an edited version of Radius that lets us use a Large\
  \ Blast Template (12 yards diameter, or 36 feet across). Given that taking damage\
  \ every round is much more lethal in <em>Savage Worlds</em> than <em>Pathfinder</em>,\
  \ probably say not. Even Wild Cards will start to wither and die if they’re in a\
  \ 3d6 Heavy Damage field for a few turns, so constraining our <em>cloudkill</em>\
  \ to a smaller size works better for our game.</p> \n     <p>Next, we need to address\
  \ how <em>cloudkill</em> can be placed anywhere within 100 ft. + 10ft./level in\
  \ <em>Pathfinder</em> and moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. First,\
  \ we must accept a difference in the presumption of scales between our two games.\
  \ In <em>Savage Worlds</em>, we generally assume you use your powers within the\
  \ scope of an encounter instead of at long distances, limiting the ranges of our\
  \ powers. That said, by using Mobile we can let the caster move their <em>damage\
  \ field</em> up to their arcane skill on each of their turns. That means we take\
  \ the maximum number from their arcane skill die (anywhere from a d4 to a d12+#),\
  \ and the cloud moves that far. That’s between 8 and 24 yards (24 to 72 feet). We\
  \ trade a higher range for the cloud’s starting location for the ability to move\
  \ it to a specific spot on each of our turns. On average, the two balance out so\
  \ we can move on.</p> \n     <p>As Mike Barbeau (the chief designer on the <em>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords</em> conversion) pointed out, one of the things GMs love to do\
  \ with <em>cloudkill</em> is block line of sight for their players. Taking damage\
  \ in a cloud is one thing; not finding your way out is another level of pain. To\
  \ that end, we can use the universal modifier (these are available to almost every\
  \ power in <em>Savage Worlds</em>) Shroud to mimic this effect. It doesn’t completely\
  \ block line of sight in the same way, but given that the Savage <em>cloudkill</em>\
  \ is more lethal to our player characters, that’s preferred.</p> \n     <p>We describe\
  \ our <em>damage field</em> as a noxious, yellow cloud to assign its trapping, and\
  \ we have our <em>Savage Worlds</em> version of <em>cloudkill</em> ready to <strike>murder</strike>\
  \ encounter player characters everywhere! Sometimes, however, our existing toolkit\
  \ isn’t large enough to encompass everything we want a power to do in <em>Pathfinder®\
  \ for Savage Worlds</em>. A great example of this is <em>disintegrate</em>! It’\
  s an iconic spell with an effect that doesn’t have a strong translation in the existing\
  \ powers, so we get to have some fun and create something new. If we look at the\
  \ other effects of <em>disintegrate</em>, we can see it fits mostly under <em>bolt</em>,\
  \ so we can get away with just adding a new Power Modifier that looks like this:</p>\

  \ anew in <em>Savage Pathfinder</em>, we follow the existing principles behind our\
  \ system to expand our powers and their modifiers to capture the spell’s essence.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Without a doubt, the category that resulted in the most new powers was\
  \ the “An Impossible Effect.” This was the catch-all category for spells that had\
  \ effects you couldn’t replicate without the usage of magic.</p> \n     <p>We don’\
  t want to give too much away, but we grouped these spells to inspire some of our\
  \ new powers for <em>Savage Pathfinder</em>:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
