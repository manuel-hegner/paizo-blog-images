  \ <h1>A Passage to Absalom</h1>\n            <p>by Dave Gross</p>\n            <h2>Chapter\
  \ One: Mulled Wine</h2>\n            <p>The first blush of dawn cast the Imperial\
  \ Shipyards into stark silhouette, a forest of black cranes and masts standing on\
  \ the eastern docks of Cassomir. Along the strand, gulls vied with ravens for the\
  \ shellfish buried beneath a thin blanket of midwinter snow. The lapping waves left\
  \ a sensuous border of sand at the edge of the snowfall, like the impression of\
  \ a woman's lips upon a crystal goblet. Soon the tide would recede, and the <i>Sea\
  \ Lion</i> would set sail for Absalom.</p>\n            <p>The cost of passage on\
  \ the converted freighter had been dear, but I felt anxious to return to the City\
  \ at the Center of the World. Among its hundred wonders was the Grand Lodge of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society, to whose secret masters I would soon report. Our expedition\
  \ to Ustalav had met with mixed success, but now I returned with an unforeseen treasure:\
  \ a copy of the lost <i>Lacuna Codex</i>. Within its pages lay magics so fell that\
  \ even the Whispering Tyrant had feared their discovery.</p>\n            <p>A return\
  \ to Absalom might also assuage the disappointments of our visit to Greengold, where\
  \ traders and diplomats treat with the elves of Kyonin. There I had hoped to employ\
  \ a craftsman to repair my beloved Red Carriage, the sole legacy from my elven father.\
  \ After days of fruitless negotiations with the sheep-faced bureaucrats, I realized\
  \ my half-elven heritage was no advantage to gaining entrance. Thus I entrusted\
  \ my vehicle to storage and chartered a riverboat to Cassomir, where I secured passage\
  \ to Absalom.</p>\n            <p>Beside me, Arnisant sat as still as a gargoyle.\
  \ The stone of the quay must have been cold beneath his haunches, but the Ustalavic\
  \ wolfhound was proving an obedient guardian. I sensed his gaze on me but did not\
  \ return it. It was his part to look to me for instruction without expectation of\
  \ reward. It fell to me to dispense those rewards when they would serve to reinforce\
  \ his training, not simply to cultivate his affection.</p>\n            <p>My own\
  \ seat was scarcely more comfortable than Arnisant's. The entrepreneur who had established\
  \ this refreshments pavilion for departing passengers warmed his guests with enormous\
  \ coal braziers, but the furniture consisted of the rough benches and communal tables\
  \ one might expect in a barracks. To deter others from sitting too close, I repositioned\
  \ our luggage on the seats beside and opposite my own. Only my most precious satchel,\
  \ that containing my spellcasting materials and the <i>Lacuna Codex</i>, remained\
  \ by my side.</p>\n            <p>Radovan returned from the serving cart with a\
  \ cup in either hand. One smelled of strong tea. From the other rose the scent of\
  \ cheap wine smothered in clove and cinnamon. He set the latter on the table and\
  \ glanced back to wink at the buxom barmaid, who returned his leer.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>\"How much time we got, boss?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Insufficient for\
  \ dalliance.\"</p>\n            <p>Radovan sighed, but I doubted his sincerity.\
  \ No doubt he wished to maintain his reputation as a ladies' man, but I sensed an\
  \ air of melancholy about him since we departed Caliphas. There he had left behind\
  \ a Varisian hedge-witch for whom I suspected he harbored a lingering devotion.</p>\n\
  \            <p>The morning air had already cooled the wine, which filled barely\
  \ more than half of the glazed clay cup. I peered at Radovan, who had lately assumed\
  \ an inappropriate custodianship of my consumption of wine and spirits. Considering\
  \ the other evidence, however, it was equally likely that the vendor employed a\
  \ stingy ladle. My first sip of the sour wine confirmed my expectation that, despite\
  \ the high prices, it was the cheapest available.</p>\n            <p>\"Dreadful\
  \ stuff, isn't it? At least it's hot.\" A corpulent man from a nearby table toasted\
  \ me with his own cup before draining it. He winced, his chins wagging as the dregs\
  \ hit the back of his throat. I took him for a merchant, noting that the high quality\
  \ of his furs and jewels belied his coarse manners.</p>\n            <p>So did the\
  \ woman at his side, who sat with the poise of a Qadiran cat. Whatever beauty age\
  \ had stolen from her she had won back in elegance. Her high cheekbones and thin\
  \ nose marked her as a descendant of an old Taldan family. If she were wed to the\
  \ merchant, I deduced that theirs was yet another expeditious marriage between ambitious\
  \ wealth and impoverished nobility.</p>\n            <p>Lest I appear uncivil before\
  \ the lady, I raised my cup to return her husband's salute. The wine was less disagreeable\
  \ on second sip, more for the wine's fortification than for its quality. I drained\
  \ the cup, careful to avoid the sediment, and signaled Radovan to fetch me another.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Hot this time,\" I said. \"And full to the brim.\"</p>\n     \
  \       <p>As I turned to give him the cup, Radovan pretended to study the ceiling\
  \ of the tent. I knew at once I'd caught him at mischief. Arnisant's drooling jowls\
  \ confirmed my suspicion.</p>\n            <p>\"How many times must I tell you not\
  \ to feed my hound?\"</p>\n            <p>Radovan shrugged. \"Somebody must have\
  \ dropped something on the floor.\"</p>\n            <p>I saw Arnisant swallow before\
  \ resuming his stoic posture, which I now realized was a ruse born of natural cunning\
  \ rather than the fruit of my instruction.</p>\n            <p>\"It is imperative\
  \ to his training that I alone dispense rewards, and then only—\"</p>\n        \
  \    <p>\"Looks like last call,\" said Radovan. \"Better hurry.\" He returned to\
  \ the wine cart, where the barmaid greeted him with a lascivious wetting of her\
  \ lips.</p>\n            <p>I checked my impulse to scold Arnisant. Negative reinforcement\
  \ is effective in the short term, but it would only muddle the more potent accumulation\
  \ of reward-for-behavior training. Still, I disliked the notion that Arnisant might\
  \ divide his loyalties. I was the dog's master, not Radovan.</p>\n            <p>I\
  \ showed Arnisant the sign to lie down. When he obeyed, I bade him roll over, rise,\
  \ stand, and return to his seated vigil. Only then did I reward him with a sliver\
  \ of beef liver sausage from a pouch among the many in which I had secured my riffle\
  \ scrolls.</p>\n            <p>Wiping my hands upon a fresh linen handkerchief from\
  \ my sleeve, I saw the merchant rising from his table. For a moment I feared he\
  \ might introduce himself, but instead he bustled past me to visit the wine cart.\
  \ On his way he stumbled into a young Qadiran woman whose snug winter clothes failed\
  \ to conceal the rich curves of her figure. I wondered how she had escaped Radovan's\
  \ attentions until I saw the barmaid's finger hooked into my bodyguard's collar,\
  \ pulling him close to whisper in his ear.</p>\n            <p>I resigned myself\
  \ to the prospect of another cup of tepid wine.</p>\n            <p>The sun had\
  \ risen high enough to reveal the details of the harbor. Across the bay to the north,\
  \ the triple towers of Harbor Watch stood vigil over the docks. Ballistas, catapults,\
  \ and trebuchets fairly bristled on their many platforms, promising doom to any\
  \ vessel so rash as to assault the shipyards. A great rusty chain descended into\
  \ the water from the southernmost tower, but I had read more than one report suggesting\
  \ this hull-breaking chain had never been completed, its appearance merely a stratagem\
  \ to deter ambitious armadas.</p>\n            <p>\"Quite a sight, isn't it?\" The\
  \ young elf pacing the perimeter of the pavilion blew at the steam rising from his\
  \ cup. His sallow complexion and nervous gaze lent him the aspect of a scholar.\
  \ Upon his shoulders he bore a tall woven backpack that sagged with the weight of\
  \ its contents. I knew him at once, not as an individual but as one of a breed of\
  \ optimistic youngsters I had encountered year after year via the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ No doubt he dreamed of traveling Golarion and uncovering ancient secrets, beginning\
  \ his apprenticeship in Absalom.</p>\n            <p>As I turned to speak with him,\
  \ however, the boy shied away like a colt. If that was the extent of his spirit,\
  \ his over-stuffed pack would seem all the heavier for his disappointment when he\
  \ was turned away from the Grand Lodge.</p>\n            <p>The remaining occupants\
  \ of the wine tent were a pair of dwarves. They were obviously traveling companions,\
  \ one scowling as he observed the porters loading crates onto the ship, the other\
  \ distracting his companion with jests at the expense of their fellow passengers.\
  \ When his gaze fell upon me, the jocular dwarf sketched a bow that seemed more\
  \ friendly than insolent. I returned the courtesy with a scant nod.</p>\n      \
  \      <div class=\"blurb360\">\n             <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Pickpocket.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Pickpocket_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n             <br>\n              \"Pretty or not, she needs to keep her\
  \ \n             <br>\n              hands off other people's purses.\"\n      \
  \      </div>\n            <p>The merchant's wife favored me with a bright smile,\
  \ which I returned with as little encouragement as possible. Her expression faltered\
  \ somewhat as she understood that I wished to be left alone, but she masked her\
  \ disappointment with the practiced grace of noble breeding.</p>\n            <p>The\
  \ shadow of Grayguard Castle crept toward us by the time Radovan disentangled himself\
  \ from the barmaid, who clutched his coins with more ardor than she put into her\
  \ smile. Yet perhaps I do him an injustice. Despite his infernal ancestry, Radovan's\
  \ knack for enchanting women verges on the uncanny.</p>\n            <p>That was\
  \ an interesting thought. Among the benefits of his tainted blood were an ability\
  \ to see in total darkness and a certain resistance to the effects of heat and flame,\
  \ which lately seemed to have evolved into a remarkable transformation triggered\
  \ by great fire. Unfortunately, he rebuffed my proposal to study his metamorphosis.\
  \ A few simple experiments might determine whether heat or flame was the true catalyst,\
  \ and whether time or tranquility caused him to revert to his half-human self. Was\
  \ his unlikely charm another quality of his unusual condition?</p>\n           \
  \ <p>The woman fell upon me before I could react. By the time I heard Arnisant growl\
  \ a warning, she clutched at my neck and shoulder. My own arms instinctively encircled\
  \ her body, pulling her close to prevent her head from striking the table. For an\
  \ instant I thought it was the merchant's wife who had tripped over the satchel\
  \ at my feet, but it was the young Qadiran woman.</p>\n            <p>Her momentary\
  \ struggle before settling on my lap evoked an involuntary reaction that she could\
  \ not fail to notice. In the private company of a gentlewoman of certain charms,\
  \ I should have welcomed the phenomenon. Yet we stood exposed to the public eye,\
  \ and she was no lady.</p>\n            <p>The young woman smothered a giggle with\
  \ her gloved fingers.</p>\n            <p>\"I beg your pardon,\" I said, although\
  \ I was hardly responsible for our collision.</p>\n            <p>\"That's quite\
  \ a tower you've erected.\" She did not refer to the luggage.</p>\n            <p>Not\
  \ six feet away, the talkative dwarf guffawed. Behind him, his companion frowned\
  \ at the disturbance, while the young elf ceased pacing, frozen and staring like\
  \ a startled hare. Near them, the merchant's wife covered her blush with a lace\
  \ fan, while her husband bit his knuckles to stop his own laughter.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>\"Nice try, sister.\" Radovan pulled the woman from my lap. She struggled\
  \ to escape, but he held tight to her arm while slipping a hand beneath her cloak.\
  \ Before she could scream, he removed his hand and dangled my purse before her eyes.</p>\n\
  \            <p>This time the merchant could not help but laugh. \"That's very good,\
  \ don't you think, my dear?\"</p>\n            <p>His wife nodded, but her eyes\
  \ lingered on Radovan as he favored the pickpocket with the lopsided leer he calls\
  \ \"the little smile.\"</p>\n            <p>\"What's your name, sweetheart?\" Radovan\
  \ asked.</p>\n            <p>Her hesitation was almost imperceptible. \"Shadya.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"What are we going to do about this little incident? If I\
  \ call the guards, we're going to miss our boat.\"</p>\n            <p>Shadya slipped\
  \ out of his grip. She raised a defiant chin and glared back at him, rubbing her\
  \ arm where he'd bruised her. \"What do you want?\"</p>\n            <p>Quick as\
  \ an adder, Radovan slipped an arm around her waist and bent her low for a kiss.\
  \ She struggled briefly while his fingers explored every contour of her body.</p>\n\
  \            <p>The merchant's wife was the first to turn away. A moment later,\
  \ she prodded her husband with the fan, and he cast his gaze to the floor. The elf\
  \ and the cheerful dwarf stared, one gaping, the other grinning. The dour dwarf\
  \ cleared his throat.</p>\n            <p>I could bear it no longer. \"That is quite\
  \ enough, Radovan.\"</p>\n            <p>He released the woman and returned to my\
  \ side. She retreated, her expression wavering between confusion and outrage.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Radovan returned my purse. \"That's all she got.\"</p>\n       \
  \     <p>While no doubt he enjoyed the pretense of collecting a kiss, I knew its\
  \ true purpose was to search the woman for any other items she might have stolen.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Passengers aboard!\" the burly captain bellowed from the edge\
  \ of the gangplank. The ship's mates arrived to transfer our luggage to our cabins.</p>\n\
  \            <p>As a spindly sailor approached to take our bags, I noticed that\
