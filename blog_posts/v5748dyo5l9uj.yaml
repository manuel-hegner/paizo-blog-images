  \ Style</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 3, 2009</p> \n    <p>I'm going\
  \ to talk a little bit about writing style today—not only because it's something\
  \ that all of us should think about when reading in general, but in particular since\
  \ it's something I think we should mull over when reading classics from <a href=\"\
  /planetStories\">the Planet Stories library</a>. Writing styles change over time,\
  \ some of them seemingly eternal, others appearing one moment only to flitter into\
  \ oblivion in the next as the winds of fashion shift. A thousand cultural variables\
  \ account for such changes, and its my view that no single stylistic element is\
  \ by itself better or worse than another. It all depends on how that element adds\
  \ to the story being told.</p> \n    <p>I have a graduate background in writing\
  \ fiction, but I was lucky enough to be in one of the few programs out there that\
  \ didn't turn up its nose at genre. And while I was in school, we talked a lot about\
  \ what it took to make a classic. Why was one book considered a classic, and another\
  \ not? The best answer I heard was Time. Because Dickens and Twain certainly weren't\
  \ thinking of writing literary masterpieces, at least no more than any author takes\
  \ pride in the crafting of words. No, they wrote for a popular audience, their works\
  \ by-and-large considered entertainment fiction by their contemporaries. </p>\n\
  \    <p>Now the classic science fiction and fantasy adventures we gleefully resurrect\
  \ at Planet Stories aren't written in today's styles. But there's a life in them,\
  \ a sheer exuberance of derring-do, that I often find missing in contemporary fiction.\
  \ Not that there isn't amazing stuff being written today—there will be as many classics\
  \ written this year as there were in 1939. But I think as we go through these turbulent\
  \ times of ours, we can benefit from the experience of another time of troubles,\
  \ a time when rocket ships roared out of spaceports of the imagination, or when\
  \ a rapier, quick wit, and a smile might win freedom for an entire planet. So try\
  \ out some <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x9\">Brackett</a>, some <a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy83x8\">Kline</a>, or some <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdo\"\
  >Moore</a> and join us on our adventure. After all, adventure is part of the human\
  \ spirit—it never goes out of style.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Christopher Carey\
