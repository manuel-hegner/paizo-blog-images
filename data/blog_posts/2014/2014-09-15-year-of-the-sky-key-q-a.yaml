              <div itemprop="articleBody">
               <p><span itemprop="description">The start of the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg7j">Year of the Sky Key</a> has spawned many questions thanks to the faction changes, the release of the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>, and the use of <a href="/products/btpy98i0"><em>Technology Guide</em></a>. In preparation for today's blog, I compiled my list of known questions, polled venture-officers about unanswered questions still at large on the messageboards, filtered out the ones that weren't specific to the organized play campaign (saved to pass along to their associated designers and developers), and wrote out answers and updates to everything that was left.</span></p>
               <h2>Warpriest Retraining</h2>
               <blockquote>
                <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to adjust their ability scores based on the fervor class ability's new dependence on Wisdom?</b><br>
                  Yes, page 28 of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4"><em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em></a> states that "if a class, prestige class or class feature-dependent ability score is altered," the character qualifies for a rebuild, maintaining the same equipment. That means a character's class choices, feats, skill ranks, spells known, et cetera can change.</p>
                <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to adjust character features tied to these ability scores (e.g. losing ranks in Diplomacy to instead put them in Sense Motive)?</b><br>
                  Yes, see above.</p>
                <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to alter any other character choices/options (e.g. feats) as part of any rebuilding process?</b><br>
                  Yes, see above.</p>
                <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to take archetypes as part of any rebuilding process?</b><br>
                  Yes, see above.</p>
                <p><b>What are the warpriest's retraining synergies (as per <a href="/products/btpy8x64"><em>Ultimate Campaign's</em></a> <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCampaign/campaignSystems/retraining.html">retraining rules</a> on page 190)?</b><br>
                  In Pathfinder Society Organized Play, determine the retraining synergies for the <em>Advanced Class Guide</em> classes by substituting one class name for an existing class on the table. For example, an arcanist has the same retraining synergies as a wizard, and any class that lists the wizard as a retraining synergy also has the arcanist as a retraining synergy.</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>Substitute the term "arcanist" anywhere the term "wizard" appears.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "bloodrager" anywhere the term "barbarian" appears. Bloodragers have retraining synergy with sorcerers and vice versa.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "brawler" anywhere the term "fighter" appears.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "hunter" anywhere the term "ranger" appears.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "investigator" anywhere the term "alchemist" appears.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "shaman" anywhere the term "druid" appears.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "skald" anywhere the term "bard" appears. Skalds have retraining synergy with barbarians and vice versa.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "slayer" anywhere the term "ranger" appears. Slayers have retraining synergy with rogues and vice versa.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "swashbuckler" anywhere the term "fighter" appears.</li>
                 <li>Substitute the term "warpriest" anywhere the term "paladin" appears.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>What is the intended interaction between the <em>Guide's</em> and the Additional Resources' entries about retraining for the warpriest? Should one or both be revised based on any of the above rulings?</b><br>
                  The <a href="/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources">Additional Resources page</a> and <em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em> principally conflict regarding warpriest retraining, as no other class's associated ability scores changed between the playtest and final versions of the classes. The Additional Resources page's wording in an important reminder that most classes and most characters do not qualify for comprehensive rebuilds based on the final version of the <em>Advanced Class Guide</em>.</p>
                <p><b>During the playtest, the shaman's spell list had access to summon nature's ally. Is there any rebuilding allowed for those who selected character options that modify summoning such as Augment Summoning?</b><br>
                  Shaman characters that selected character options that modify summoning abilities they no longer possess may retrain those features and any immediate prerequisites for those features. For example, such a shaman could retrain Augment Summoning, Superior Summoning, and Spell Focus (conjuration), but not Spell Penetration, Combat Casting, or Improved Initiative. A character can sell back any items that specifically modify summoning abilities, use <em>summon nature's ally</em>, or use <em>summon monster</em> (such as scrolls).</p>
               </blockquote>
               <h2>Faction Changes</h2>
               <blockquote>
                <p><b>Does one automatically switch to the successor faction, or is that treated as the one faction change per season?</b><br>
                  The change to a successor faction is automatic and does not count as the one free faction change. If your character was a member of the Cheliax faction, she is now part of the Dark Archives faction for free. Try out a scenario as part of that faction, then decide if you want to stick with it or use the free change.</p>
                <p><b>When the five nation-based factions (Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira, and Taldor) changed into ideological factions, how many faction-specific features and rewards could a PC retain?</b><br>
                  As noted on pages 17-18 of the <em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em>, a member of a retiring faction retains "any faction-specific vanities, titles, traits, prestige items, or other purchases made while the character was a member of the retired faction." As a result, a Cheliax faction PC who purchased the Hellknight prestige award would retain it no matter which faction she ended up joining at the start of Season 6.</p>
                <p><b>Do I also keep any of the faction-specific boons earned on Season 5 Chronicle sheets?</b><br>
                  Yes, you keep any of these boons that you earned during Season 5. However, remember that you might not qualify for other faction-specific boons from that faction once you have switched allegiances; page 18 of the <em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em> covers which current factions correspond to earlier nation-based factions for the purposes of earning these rewards.</p>
                <p><b>Is a character benefiting from The Risen faction prestige award required to stay with the Scarab Sages faction as the natural evolution of the Osirion faction?</b><br>
                  This is a special case, given the enduring consequences of purchasing that particular prestige award. A character who possessed this prestige award prior to August 14th, 2014 does not qualify for the free faction change. He can, however, pay 3 Prestige Points per character level to change factions, as described on page 17 of the <em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em>. A member of the Scarab Sages faction who acquires The Risen prestige award [on or after August 14th, 2014] is bound to that faction and cannot change factions.</p>
               </blockquote>
               <h2>Technology Guide</h2>
               <blockquote>
                <p><b>Is the Technologist feat in <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide</em> required to attempt any skill checks regarding technology?</b><br>
                  The following text will appear in an updated version of the <em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em>:<br>
                  "The otherworldly technology associated with Numeria is very different from the rest of the technology available on Golarion,and so far advanced that any comprehensive understanding requires the Technologist feat (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide</em> 7). However, scenarios that include Numerian technology are designed in a way that characters with the Technologist feat have an advantage, yet those without are still able to succeed at the mission. Clever Pathfinders might operate a device by trial and error, infer a device's use by its placement (such as a keypad on a door acting as a lock), or draw logical if crude associations between known items and Numerian technology (such as a laser pistol having the same shape and features as a hand crossbow or Alkenstar firearm)."</p>
                <p><b>How does hardness work for creatures? Does energy damage such as cold deal half damage to creatures with hardness (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 173-174) even before applying the flat numerical reduction?</b><br>
                  When a creature with hardness sustains damage, subtract its hardness from the damage dealt. The rules for halving damage, doubling damage, dealing damage with ineffective tools, immunities, and the like only apply to damaging inanimate objects.<br><em>(This is apparently a question the Design Team has received a few times during the development of <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods">Iron Gods</a>, so they were ready to go with an answer!)</em></p>
               </blockquote>
               <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
               <blockquote>
                <p><b>Investigators have an alchemy class ability similar to that of an alchemist. Are investigators also able to craft alchemical items in Pathfinder Society Organized Play?</b><br>
                  Investigators are able to craft alchemical items and poisons as if they were alchemists. This information will appear in an upcoming update to the Pathfinder Society FAQ, both in the poisons section (which will also include the investigator's poison lore class ability) and the alchemist crafting section.</p>
                <p><b>I received a ratfolk or samsaran race boon for volunteering at a recent convention, but the Additional Resources page still says that ratfolk and samsaran options in <a href="/products/btpy8rv2"><em>Advanced Race Guide</em></a> are not legal for play. Is this ever going to change?</b><br>
                  All ratfolk and samsaran alternate racial traits, favored class bonuses, archetypes, equipment, feats, and spells are legal for play. Note that most of these options are limited to ratfolk and samsaran characters respectively following the Advanced Race Guide entry's second paragraph on the Additional Resources page. The next Additional Resources update is set to revise the entry.</p>
                <p><b>What deities can a warpriest worship? The Additional Resources page suggests that only the core 20 deities are legal choices.</b><br>
                  This is not the intended interpretation, and the next Additional Resources update is set to revise the entry to read as follows. "To select a blessing, a warpriest must worship a deity that offers the domain of the same name." A warpriest in the organized play campaign is able to select from among any of the legal deity choices.</p>
                <p><b>Can one purchase a ring of eloquence (<a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</em></a> 216) with any combination of languages? Are restricted or banned languages such as Druidic or Androffan options?</b><br>
                  At this time, only two configurations of the ring of eloquence exist in the organized play campaign. The first grants the ability to speak and understand Common, Dwarven, Elven, and Gnome. The second grants the ability to speak and understand Giant, Goblin, Orc, and Undercommon. Rings with other configurations may appear as treasure on Chronicle sheets.</p>
