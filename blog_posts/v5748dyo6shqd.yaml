  ><em>Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</em></a> is out today, coming out hot just before\
  \ the Strength of Thousands adventure path invites you in for an extended stay.\
  \ Within these pages you’ll find never-before-revealed secrets and information on\
  \ the people, history, geography, and major cities of the Expanse, brought to you\

  \ \n     <p>Don’t miss the introduction on this book! Written by the stellar Jabari\
  \ Weathers, you may have seen snippets from this section floating around Twitter\
  \ and other wilds of the internet. This section offers prompts to consider when\
  \ building your character—whether you’re a visitor to the Expanse or were born and\
  \ raised there—as well as advice on how to venture into the setting respectfully\
  \ if you’re not sure how to approach it. After that we delve into the major social\
  \ aspects of Mwangi: the history of the land, the people who live in it, and the\
  \ gods who hold heavy influence over the region.</p> \n     <p>The Expanse is still\
  \ a world of adventure, however, and as we move into more specifics, we get into\
  \ the geography of the region. We’ll trek across mountains, savannahs, and jungles\
  \ of the Mwangi before finally reaching nine of the region’s greatest nations and\
  \ cities. Risk pirate havens, explore mysterious cities with dangerous histories,\
  \ catch fish in the Hurricane Harvest when the tides rush through the streets, or\
  \ try to find a legendary paradise in the mortal realms! But beware, the final pages\
  \ of this book contain a bestiary of monsters that lurk, waiting for adventurers\
  \ to blunder into their lairs!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3cb78374-4780-4f9a-88c3-a407b93cc388/20210707-paulus.png\"\

  font-size: 13px;\">Art by Valeria Lutfullina</p> \n     <h3>COVID Sucks</h3> \n\
  \     <p>About two months before the final drafts for the Mwangi Expanse were due,\
  \ the COVID shutdown hit the United States in full force. As you can imagine, it\
  \ wreaked havoc with book production.</p> \n     <p>I was one of the luckiest ones.\
  \ I kept my job, my immediate family was safe, and Paizo gracefully pivoted to work\
  \ from home. Completing the book was still an unmitigated nightmare, one that caused\
  \ multiple sleepless nights and minor mental breakdowns over the course of the year.\
  \ For many of the freelancers on the project, it meant sudden financial insecurity,\
  \ unexpected full-time childcare, family emergencies or deaths, and even worse.\
  \ The government response at the time was deliberately inadequate and--yes, I will\
  \ say it--racist, and was combined with the absolute despair of the constant police\
  \ brutality that was highlighted during this time.</p> \n     <p>I’m not saying\
  \ this to invoke pity, encourage token platitudes, or glorify the heroic effort\
  \ the authors went through to get this book done--even those who had to bow out\
  \ in the end. It was heroic, but what happened shouldn’t be glorified. I’m saying\
  \ that so when everyone sees the final product, they understand just how incredible\
  \ the people who worked on it are.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <h3>We Messed\
  \ Up</h3> \n     <p>No matter how much time and effort we put into developing and\
  \ editing a book, something wrong always manages to slip through. Some are annoying\
  \ but mild, like spelling “uncommon” wrong a dozen times in a row. Some are just\
  \ funny, like the sarcesian in First Contact that dealt 1d810+5 damage with a sniper\
  \ rifle. And some we can only stare and ask, “how the <censored>\n        did we\
  \ miss that??”\n      </censored></p> \n     <p>Mwangi has one of those <censored>\n\
  \        moments.\n      </censored></p> \n     <p>We fixed the errors in the PDF\
  \ versions but didn’t spot them in time to alter the printed books. Gripplis have\
  \ the wrong ancestry bonuses in the printed copies. As a result, they lack the correct\
  \ ability score boosts (Dexterity, Wisdom, and a Free boost, plus their Strength\
  \ penalty). The ancestry also has a line noting “others probably assume [gripplis]\
  \ are savage, simple-minded, or both.” It was meant as a note that such assumptions\
  \ were flawed but didn’t convey enough context to be appropriate in any sense. Moreover,\
  \ that language specifically violates our own guidelines on how we talk about people.\
  \ Our developers and editors know to remove those words on sight to avoid situations\
  \ like this. However, due to a process issue, this was flagged during production\
  \ but not actually removed. We’ve instituted new procedures to prevent words like\
  \ this from ever making it to print.</p> \n     <p>We’re sorry and will continue\
  \ trying to do better.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
