  \ Evil</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 10, 2008 </p> \n   <p> We've always\
  \ kind of known what role devils and demons play in the game. In Pathfinder we'll\
  \ be using the classic categories for the evil outsiders. Lawful evil outsiders\
  \ are devils—these are the monsters interested in corrupting and destroying the\
  \ mind. They infect faith, politics, and scholastic pursuits, and strive to turn\
  \ mortals into traitors and heretics against their own nature. Chaotic evil outsiders\
  \ are demons—creatures of primal destruction and ruin who have existed as long as\
  \ life itself. They seek to destroy and savage the world, forces of entropy that\
  \ exist to bring about the end of the world itself. </p> \n   <p>But that's just\
  \ 2/3 of the equation. But what about the neutral evil fiends? They always seem\
  \ to get left behind. Once you have groups out to corrupt the mind and corrupt the\
  \ body... what else is left? In <a href=\" /pathfinder/v5748btpy7zdd\">\"Seven Days\
  \ to the Grave\"</a>, we've got the first new daemon to grace the <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ Bestiary, the diseased leukodaemon (pictured here). We also reveal a bit more\
  \ about the role of fiends in the <b>Pathfinder Chronicles</b> Campaign Setting.</p>\
  \ \n   <p></p>For our neutral evil fiends, the daemons, they are embodiments of\
  \ death. They care little about the physical world or pleasures and torments of\
  \ the flesh, nor are they particularly interested in corrupting mortal life to serve\
  \ their needs or to betray its kin. Daemons have perhaps the simplest desire—to\
  \ feed on the soul. In many ways, the daemons are perhaps the most dangerous of\
  \ the three, since you can continue to live even if your body and mind are broken\
  \ after the demons and devils are done with you. When a daemon is done with you...\
  \ you're just dead. \n   <p></p> \n   <p> Actually, maybe that makes the daemons\
  \ the most humane of the three fiends. At least they don't torment you as much.</p>\
