  ><i>Seven Swords of Sin</i></a> now out the door and arriving in mailboxes everywhere,\
  \ it's time to start looking at September's new GameMastery Module. This month we\
  \ are releasing <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x6k\"><i>U1: Gallery of Evil</i></a>.\
  \ This module is our first urban adventure (hence the U code), so we thought we\
  \ would start out proper by exploring one section of Golarion's most important city:\
  \ Absalom. This vast metropolis sits on the isle of Kortos in the great Inner Sea,\
  \ making it of vital importance to the region.</p> \n    <p><i>Gallery of Evil</i>\
  \ specifically focuses on the Ivy District, known as being home to many of the city's\
  \ most influential artists and craftsmen. It's only natural, then, that the adventure\
  \ focuses on the darker side of art, with one crazed master turning his works loose\
  \ on his unsuspecting critics. Over the next few weeks, we will explore some of\
  \ this module with a bit more depth, but for now, here's one of our favorite art\
  \ pieces and the teaser text from the back of the module. </p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Art for Murder's Sake</b></p> \n     <p>The great city of Absalom\
  \ is known as a center for trade, education, and art. Inside the Ivy District reside\
  \ dozens of famous artists, but one has the talent to bring his paintings to life\
  \ and uses paint to conjure terrible monsters bent on destruction. Can the player\
  \ characters stop the mad painter before he perfects his art? </p> \n     <p><i>Gallery\
  \ of Evil</i> is an urban adventure for 8th-level characters, compatible with the\
  \ world's most popular fantasy roleplaying game. This adventure includes details\
  \ on the metropolis of Absalom's Ivy District, as well as the home of the diabolical\
  \ artist and his twisted works. The PCs must track down the deadly paintings and\
  \ discover the true identity of the artist behind it all. </p> \n     <p>This adventure\
  \ is the first to feature information on the metropolis of Absalom, one of the largest\
  \ cities in the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting. </p> \n    </blockquote>\
