  \ very close to the launch of the new Paizo store, so I wanted to give everyone\

  \ store, check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6zs4c?Paizo-Tech-Update\"\

  \ width=\"90%\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"A screenshot of the new Paizo store\
  \ navigation and welcome banner. the navigation features the pazio logo, a search\
  \ bar, an iconic to sign in to your account, an a cart icon. Below that is a blue\
  \ car with the store category navigation; subscriptions, pathfinder, starfinder,\
  \ virtual tabletop, accessories, other games, and merch. Under the full navigation\
  \ is a banner showing off a wave of art from pathfinder and starfinder including\
  \ locations, and dragons, overlayed over the banner art is text that says Welcome\
  \ Adventurers.\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Categories</h2>\n      <p>We’ve looked through logs examining\
  \ page hits and website traffic and had many internal discussions to create the\
  \ primary means of navigation for the new store. We’ll continue to update the interface\
  \ as we learn more from all of you about how to better organize the store to make\
  \ the products you’re looking for easier to find. Now, let’s take a look at the\
  \ Pathfinder section of the new store.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ width=\"90%\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Pathfinder Store\
  \ Pathfinder Categories Page. The page features a banner image with the pathfinder\
  \ logo on the left over a red textured background and an image of a red dragon on\
  \ the right. The main part of the page is taken up by thumbnails each with a different\
  \ sub category of the pathfinder store. left to right, Coming Soon, New to roleplaying,\
  \ rulebooks, adventures, lost omens campaign setting, fiction and comics, pathfinder\
  \ society, pathfinder first edition, and pathfinder partners.\"></a>\n       <p\
  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p><strong>Coming\
  \ Soon</strong> showcases all announced products that are not yet available for\
  \ sale for each brand. For example, you won’t find upcoming Starfinder products\
  \ in the Coming Soon folder in the Pathfinder section, but anything with a Pathfinder\
  \ logo will be visible here.</p>\n      <p><strong>New to Roleplaying</strong> displays\
  \ introductory products like the Pathfinder Beginner Box and the Pathfinder Player\
  \ Core and makes it easier for new players to find the things they might be looking\
  \ for.</p>\n      <p>The others are self-explanatory, though one thing to note though\
  \ is that with the new store, products can appear in more than one place. This is\
  \ especially true of <strong>Pathfinder Partners</strong>, who are licensed partners\
  \ whose products will appear next to the products they are built for (like the Foundry\
  \ VTT version of an Adventure Path showing up alongside the Adventure Path).</p>\n\
  \      <p>Each section also has its own filters. You can refine products visible\
  \ to you on a page by clicking a radio button and it will then hide the products\
  \ that don’t match your search. For example, there is a Brand filter that lets you\
  \ choose between Pathfinder First Edition, Pathfinder Second Edition, and Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition Remaster. There is also one for just Pathfinder, which shows Pathfinder\
  \ products regardless of what edition you are playing (like pawns, miniatures, etc.).Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures has filters for Level Ranges; Miniatures has filters for Creature Type\
  \ (Aberration, Beast, etc.), Material (metal or plastic), Painted (yes/no), Player\
  \ Character, Rarity, and Size. As you move into specific product categories (like\
  \ Adventures), the filters change to show only the filter options that exist in\
  \ that category.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>New Product Detail Pages</h2>\n    \

  \      <br>\n      <p><strong>Presentation</strong>: New releases for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition and Starfinder Second Edition have extra previews associated with\
  \ them. Our goal is to provide previews of the covers, table of contents, and a\
  \ 2-page spread with every release. Each page will also have a “stat block” at the\
  \ bottom that lists the weight, dimensions, Paizo SKU#, UPC, and page count for\
  \ the selected product.</p>\n      <p><strong>Variants on the Same Page:</strong>\
  \ Hardcover, Sketch, Special Edition, and Pocket Edition books will all live on\
  \ the same page. Clicking the button will change the image that’s displayed as well\
  \ as change the cost for that book. This makes it easier to show the entirety of\
  \ the product’s formats in one place and ensure you’re getting exactly the version\
  \ you want to get. The exception to that are PDFs, which live in a separate <strong>Digital\
  \ Editions</strong> folder under each category.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>What\
  \ to Expect/What’s Changing</h2>\n      <p>The Paizo ecommerce store has been built\
  \ over the decades to be very flexible, and we’re going to lose some of that flexibility\
  \ as we transition to a new store. Here are some changes that are coming directly\
  \ as a result of the new store.</p>\n      <p><strong>Site Downtime:</strong> Paizo.com\
  \ will go dark for roughly two days when we start the conversion. During this time,\
  \ the tech team will be squaring up the data we have in the old store and making\
  \ sure it’s updated in the new store. That includes things like balancing gift cards,\
  \ vouchers, Humble Bundle codes, purchase history, subscriptions, your downloads,\
  \ and a bunch of other data.</p>\n      <p><strong>Sidecart</strong>: The process\
  \ by which you add items to future subscription orders is changing. We’ll cover\
  \ that in the subscription blog.</p>\n      <p><strong>Wishlists</strong>: Your\
  \ current wishlists will be going away with the launch of the new store. If there\
  \ are lists you want to retain, please copy them all down in the next week or so.\
  \ You can create multiple wishlists in BigCommerce, such as one for Holiday Gifts,\
  \ My Next Campaign, or Revenge of the Runelords. You can share a wishlist to make\
  \ it public for friends and family or keep it private.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div\

  \ title, the price: $24.99, the expected release date: Nov 5th 2025, an Add To Wishlist\
  \ button, including a Dropdown that has the options to \" add to my wishlist and\
  \ create new wish list, the products text description, shopping information.></a>\n\
  \       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p><strong>Foundry\
  \ VTT:</strong> We’ve been offering two different versions of Foundry VTT products:\
  \ one that includes the PDF and the code together, and one that offers just the\
  \ code at a discount for customers who already owned the PDF. The new store unfortunately\
  \ can’t support gating a product behind PDF ownership, so we’ll be offering our\
  \ Foundry modules exclusively as code-only items and pricing them similarly to the\
  \ code-only Paizo products already available for purchase on the official Foundry\
  \ storefront.</p>\n      <p>While that does mean that our existing PDF + Foundry\
  \ bundles and discounts for PDF ownership will be going away with the launch of\
  \ the new store, we fully plan to explore new options in the near future that can\
  \ offer a similar combined value to customers who invest deeply into digital content.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The existing PDF discounts will remain in place until the launch of the\
  \ new store, so if you already own the PDFs for any FVTT products you've been planning\
  \ to pick up, you still have a chance to get them at a substantial discount!</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Preorders</strong>: The preorder window for future products is\
  \ now limited to 7 days prior to street date. You’ll see the release date under\
  \ the title, and it won’t give you an option to select any format to make a purchase\
  \ until the 7-day window opens. If you’re one of the few customers who use preorders\
  \ (bless you!), we encourage you to subscribe instead. That will grant you the free\
  \ PDF and allow it to ship early.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ again for your continued support as we make this big move to a new platform!</p>\n\
