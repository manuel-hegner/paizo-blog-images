  \      </div> \n      <p>Four esteemed graduates from the College of Mysteries in\
  \ Absalom are sent to a tiny desert village in eastern Thuvia along the banks of\
  \ the Junira River. Rumor has it that everyone in this small community has suddenly\
  \ developed magical abilities. Power that, if left unchecked, might spell their\
  \ doom. Perhaps even more troubling, even those who just visit the town receive\
  \ powers as well! Can these four spellslinging scholars work together to get to\
  \ the bottom of this mystery before rogue magic tears the place apart?</p> \n  \
