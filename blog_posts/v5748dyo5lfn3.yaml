  \ itemprop=\"description\">Part of what initially attracted me to Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play was the archaeological background, which resonated with my academic\
  \ training and love of traveling abroad. Playing scenarios that explored ancient\
  \ structures, visited dig sites, or required the PCs to understand a foreign culture\
  \ made me really get what the Pathfinder Society was all about, so when I began\
  \ writing support material as a volunteer—in particular the convention boons for\
  \ Season 4—I made sure to highlight some of the archaeological feel in boons such\
  \ as Expedition Manager.</span></p> \n    <p>Let be honest, though. Even though\
  \ archaeology has an alluring mystique and can be both enjoyable and rewarding,\
  \ its virtues don't always translate well in a four-hour time slot. Perhaps one\
  \ day I'll develop an engaging, short challenge that features the joys of excavation\
  \ and systematic discovery without boring the socks off of the players. A developer\
  \ can dream!</p> \n    <p>Well, let's instead take a look at that other feature\
  \ of Pathfinder Society: travel. With about 40 countries in the Inner Sea region\
  \ alone, there's a lot to take in and explore—and only so many scenarios each season\
  \ to see it all. Ever since Season 3, we've focused on a particular part of the\
  \ world and explored it in depth. What we haven't done quite as much as a result\
  \ is travel widely to less understood, less frequented locales to explore, report,\
  \ and cooperate.</p> \n    <p>I'm feeling the itch to send Pathfinders to a few\
  \ exciting places, and I would love to hear your feedback about what regions deserve\
  \ more attention. Have you always wanted to travel to an island in the Shackles?\
  \ How about a return to Jalmeray? Does Lastwall call to you? These could be places\
  \ we've visited before but haven't seen for a long time, or they could be places\
  \ where no PC Pathfinder has ever set foot.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
