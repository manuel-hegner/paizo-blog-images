  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey! It’s your fledgling and\
  \ greenhorn Rulelord Pete here. If there’s three things to know about me, they’\
  re that I am a consummate GM, I think the next iconic should be a shoony, and I\
  \ want people to try new games! However, it’s not always that easy. Branching out\
  \ in our collective hobby requires many people to commit time, money, and energy\
  \ to sit at a table and engage with unfamiliar rules. There are many who might want\
  \ to try something new but aren’t able to because they can’t find anyone to play\
  \ with. If this sounds like you, then there’s hope.</p>\n      <p>The mods at r/Pathfinder2e\
  \ saw a need to help bring Pathfinder to new players, and thus Beginner Box Days\
  \ were born! This year, events will be running <strong>between April 13th and April\
  \ 21st</strong>. Using the power of the internet, we have been able to connect new\
  \ players hungry to try Pathfinder Second Edition with experienced GMs. So, how\
  \ can you get involved?</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \    </div>\n      <br>\n      <p><strong>RUN A GAME!</strong> GMs can register\
  \ their game at RPGChronicles.net using event code <strong>2716006</strong>. Once\
  \ you set up events for both the Upper and Lower levels, players will be able to\
  \ join your game starting TODAY! You can run games in your local time zone or even\
  \ in a non-English language to help introduce the next generation of Pathfinder\
  \ players to the game. Just make sure to get a Beginner Box module version for your\
  \ VTT of choice or request a FREE PDF copy from Paizo through our form at <strong>BeginPF2.com</strong>.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>PLAY A GAME!</strong> Starting TODAY players can register themselves\
  \ for both levels of Paizo’s remastered Beginner Box adventure: <em>Menace under\
  \ Otari</em>! Each level is designed to slowly introduce the player to important\
  \ aspects of the game, from combat to skills to puzzles! The Upper Level is the\
  \ starter level, where you’ll investigate Tamily Tanderveil’s basement to investigate\
  \ who (or what) is stealing her fish. This level is best for people who are brand\
  \ new to playing Pathfinder or any TTRPG. The Lower level introduces more challenges\
  \ as you begin to uncover the menace under the logging town of Otari, putting your\
  \ new skills to the ultimate test! Players can play one level, or both, by finding\
  \ a slot that matches their availability and signing up on <strong>BeginPF2.com</strong>.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>EARN SOCIETY CREDIT!</strong> Both GMs and players can earn society\
  \ credit that you can use on your first official character. The Beginner Box is\
  \ played in Adventure Mode so you can try any class or ancestry that your GM will\
  \ allow, or play any of Paizo’s remastered pregenerated characters if you just want\
  \ to get rolling! To earn society credit, simply add your Paizo Organized Play number\
  \ on RPGChronicles when you create or sign up to a game. We will be reporting all\
  \ sessions, but it is not necessary to join Pathfinder Society to participate in\
  \ Beginner Box Days.</p>\n      <p>Paizo has also given us a stack of vouchers we’\
  ll be raffling off to players and GMs, which we’ll distribute after all games are\
  \ reported. Also, <em>Rise of the Rulelords</em> podcast <em>and </em>Team + Publishing\
  \ are giving away 3 physical remastered Beginner Boxes, and Team + will be raffling\
  \ away bundles of their best-selling class expansions! <strong>So don’t wait! Begin\
  \ your next adventure, or help someone start their own at BeginPF2.com!</strong></p>\n\
