  \  <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Among the Dead</h2> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Tossing aside\
  \ her blanket, Kagur sat up and looked where Eovath was gazing, but though she had\
  \ keen eyes, he generally fared better in the dark. \"I don't see anything.\"</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Eovath stood up. \"Neither do I, now. It was just a shadow, and it's\
  \ shuffled back around the next bend. But whatever it was, it had two arms and two\
  \ legs and was bent over like it was hurt. Dron, maybe, if he escaped.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Or the bait in a trap.\" Kagur smiled. \"There's one way to find out.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Her longbow was of little use when she couldn't see targets at a distance.\
  \ She left it unstrung and leaning against the canyon wall and drew her longsword\
  \ instead. The straight steel blade made a faint hissing sound as it cleared the\
  \ pewter mouth of the scabbard.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, Eovath likewise forsook\
  \ his pair of javelins in favor of his battleaxe. Jorn Blacklion had pulled the\
  \ enormous double-bitted implement from the grip of a giant he'd slain in battle,\
  \ and it fit the hands of his adopted son better than any little human weapon could.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Ready?\" Kagur whispered.</p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\" Eovath replied, and\
  \ they advanced.</p> \n    <p>The night was as silent as it was dark. Kagur's pulse\
  \ beat in her neck.</p> \n    <p>She told herself she wasn't nervous. She was a\
  \ Blacklion warrior, well schooled in the use of the sword and tested in fights\
  \ with orcs, wolves, and saber-toothed cats. Still, a ghost... or a demon...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She sneered her anxiety away. Her father had taught her that if something\
  \ could hurt her, she could hurt it back. That only made sense, and it meant a warrior\
  \ need never be afraid.</p> \n    <p>When she and Eovath stalked around the turn,\
  \ it was only to behold another stretch of gorge that, as best she could judge with\
  \ only starlight to see by, was as empty as the one behind her. But as she peered\
  \ about, she caught a whiff of decay hanging in the chill night air.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Smell that?\" she whispered.</p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\" Eovath replied. \"You were right.\
  \ This is a trap.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Dron could still be here.\" Kagur raised her\
  \ voice: \"Dron! It's Eovath and Kagur! We came to help you!\" The shout echoed\
  \ away, the sound bouncing off the canyon walls.</p> \n    <p>In response, a dark\
  \ form staggered away from the wall of the gorge. As Eovath had said, it was shaped\
  \ like a person, hunched over, and had its back to the Blacklions. When Kagur squinted,\
  \ she could just make out variations in the texture of it that might indicate the\
  \ layered fur and leather garments of a Kellid hunter. She shifted her grip on the\
  \ hilt of her sword, and she and Eovath headed for the shadow. </p> \n    <p>A second\
  \ black shape plummeted down onto the giant's back.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> The dead were not meant to walk.\n    </div> \n    <p>Clinging\
  \ to the giant like a child riding his father's shoulders, his assailant ripped\
  \ at him, maybe with a dagger, maybe with something else. In the darkness, Kagur\
  \ couldn't tell.</p> \n    <p>She sprang forward to cut at the attacker, but Eovath\
  \ reeled around and inadvertently shielded the thing clinging to his back with his\
  \ own towering body. He dropped his axe to clank on stones on the canyon floor,\
  \ reached back over his shoulder, and yanked his foe from his perch, smashing it\
  \ down onto the ground with a bellow.</p> \n    <p>Kagur's belly tightened in loathing,\
  \ not because the creature was hideous—although it was—but because she suspected\
  \ it had once been human. It still had the general form of a man and wore a man's\
  \ garments. But it was so withered and shriveled that by rights, it should have\
  \ had no strength at all, and its nails and teeth alike had grown long and jagged-sharp.\
  \ The dark, slanted eyes in its pale face were featureless, without differentiated\
  \ whites, irises, or pupils, and its ears were pointed. The carrion stench Kagur\
  \ had smelled at the site of the massacre and at intervals along the trail emanated\
  \ from its body.</p> \n    <p>To her surprise, the creature wrenched itself free\
  \ of Eovath's grip and started to roll to its feet. She lashed out, cutting through\
  \ the side of its neck until steel grated against spine. It flopped back down onto\
  \ the ground, thrashed, and then lay still.</p> \n    <p>Eovath was swaying, and\
  \ blood from his claw wounds stained his tunic. \"How badly are you hurt?\" Kagur\
  \ asked him.</p> \n    <p>Nearly pitching forward in the process, he stooped and\
  \ fumbled for his battleaxe. \"Behind you!\" he croaked.</p> \n    <p>She whirled.\
  \ More shadows were rearing up from the creek. She hadn't realized it was deep enough\
  \ to hide something the size of a man, but it evidently was.</p> \n    <p>The things\
  \ rushed her. So did their comrade farther up the gorge, the lure that she and Eovath\
  \ had hoped was Dron.</p> \n    <p>Hoping to surprise them, she charged the gaunt,\
  \ pale things splashing out of the water. One surprised her instead by throwing\
  \ a dagger, but she saw the gleam of metal just in time to twitch aside. The blade\
  \ spun past her.</p> \n    <p>A creature sprang at her with outstretched claws,\
  \ and she cut at its head and sliced half its face away. It fell, but as she pivoted\
  \ to meet the next one, it started to stand back up.</p> \n    <p>No living man\
  \ or beast could have shaken off the effects of a wound like that. She realized\
  \ that if she and Eovath hadn't found ghosts, they'd at least come close. For the\
  \ foes rushing at her were almost certainly some manner of undead, perhaps the skulking,\
  \ corpse-eating brutes called ghouls.</p> \n    <p>She cut into the next one's chest,\
  \ and it snarled and lunged, driving her sword deeper into itself in its frenzy\
  \ to reach her. She tried to jump back and yank the blade free, but the ghoul was\
  \ quick and prevented her from opening up the distance. Its clawed fingers grabbed\
  \ her leather-clad forearm, and it leaned forward and opened its fanged jaws wide.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Using her off hand, she snatched a dirk from her belt and drove it into\
  \ the middle of the living dead man's forehead. The creature collapsed with her\
  \ longsword still embedded in its torso.</p> \n    <p>She yanked the sword free\
  \ and cut in a single motion, barely in time to hold back another onrushing ghoul,\
  \ this one discernibly female by virtue of its bouncing, withered breasts and swinging\
  \ amber necklace. Without pausing, Kagur turned and slashed again at the one with\
  \ half a face, which had by now regained its feet. It recoiled, and the attack fell\
  \ short.</p> \n    <p>Kagur had always imagined the walking dead to be slow and\
  \ clumsy, but the ghouls were nimble and inhumanly resilient. As she struck repeatedly,\
  \ whirling and dodging all the while in an effort to keep her foes from surrounding\
  \ and swarming over her as a group, she came to the uncomfortable realization that\
  \ they might well overwhelm her.</p> \n    <p>Particularly if she had to go on fighting\
  \ alone. Somehow, despite the incessant pressure exerted by the ghouls and the need\
  \ to respond to the threat after threat, she managed to cast about and spot Eovath\
  \ in the darkness.</p> \n    <p>His head bowed, the giant was down on one knee.\
  \ Plainly not dead, thank Gorum! But why wasn't he fighting? Had the first ghoul\
  \ wounded him that severely?</p> \n    <p>Suddenly, Kagur glimpsed a shadow, a ghoul\
  \ apparently seeking easier prey than she was proving to be, darting in on the giant's\
  \ flank. She couldn't have reached it in time even if she hadn't had her own foes\
  \ blocking the way. She could only gasp in a breath and shout, \"Look out!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The frost giant lifted his head, cast about, and swatted the ghoul away\
  \ with the back of his hand. As it fell and rolled back to its feet, he groped to\
  \ reclaim his axe.</p> \n    <p>At the same moment, a charging ghoul forced Kagur\
  \ to refocus on her own situation. She slashed the clawed white fingers from her\
  \ assailant's hand and crippled one leg with a cut to the knee. When it fell headlong,\
  \ she scrambled right over the top of it and cut at the undead brute behind it.\
  \ The stroke ripped open the ghoul's neck, but that only made it bare its fangs\
  \ and gather itself to spring.</p> \n    <p>Eovath fared better. Looming up behind\
  \ the ghoul, he chopped down at the top of its skull and split the creature all\
  \ the way down to the breastbone.</p> \n    <p>Freeing the battleaxe and dumping\
  \ the ghoul's remains to the ground with a flick of his wrists, he panted, \"Don't\
  \ let them scratch you! It steals your strength!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I wasn't... planning\
  \ on it.\" Kagur feinted high and cut low, but her target sprang aside from the\
  \ true attack. \"Let's fight back to back!\"</p> \n    <p>Once they did, things\
  \ seemed less frantic. Kagur had instants when she could consider tactics, not simply\
  \ react, and her sword struck home more often. She had little doubt that behind\
  \ her, Eovath's axe was chopping and smashing to similar murderous effect.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Blacklion!\" she shouted. \"Blacklion!\" Then her brother took up the\
  \ battle cry as well, their twin roars reverberating off the canyon walls.</p> \n\
  \    <p>After several more exchanges, and another ghoul sprawled maimed and motionless\
  \ in the sand and stones on the canyon floor, it became clear the undead were attacking\
  \ less relentlessly than before. It seemed likely they would soon retreat, and,\
  \ grinning, Kagur resolved to give chase when they did. She wanted to slaughter\
  \ all the filthy things.</p> \n    <p>Then, however, two whistled notes, the first\
  \ short and the second sustained, shrilled down from the sky. Whereupon the ghouls\
  \ did fall back, but plainly not of their own choosing. </p> \n    <p>A signal!\
  \ Judging that locating the ghouls' hitherto unsuspected leader was more important\
  \ than cutting the creatures down from behind, Kagur held her position. Struggling\
  \ to control her breathing, sweat stinging in her eyes, she peered upward.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Leathery wings flapped, and a shape swooped down from on high. For a moment,\
  \ Kagur couldn't make out anything to distinguish it from a gigantic bat. Once it\
  \ lit on an outcropping partway up one of the walls, however, it was easier to distinguish\
  \ other features. Though tufted with bristles, its body was mostly hairless and\
  \ scaly like a snake's, and it had arms as well as wings. Its legs were as long\
  \ as a man's but bent backward like a goat's and ended in feet with three splayed\
  \ toes.</p> \n    <p>\"Well,\" Kagur panted, \"you wanted to see a demon.\" She\
  \ had little doubt they were seeing one now. The thing certainly looked demonic.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I didn't ask for a flying one.\" Moving slowly, Eovath stooped and\
  \ picked up a stone. Giants were notorious for their ability to throw rocks, and\
  \ unless the demon descended to the canyon floor, they would have no other way of\
  \ striking at it.</p> \n    <p>Although maybe they wouldn't need to, for the fiend\
  \ appeared to be paying them little heed. Instead, it raked its gaze over its followers,\
  \ the ones still whole—or mostly so—that had gathered beneath its perch, as well\
  \ as the crippled ones struggling to crawl in the same direction, and the inert\
  \ forms Kagur and Eovath had dispatched outright.</p> \n    <p>When it had glared\
  \ its fill, it bared its needle fangs and hissed. \"Disobedient!\"</p> \n    <p>Most\
  \ of the ghouls cringed, but one glowered back. \"Hungry!\" it growled. \"Starving!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The demon sprang from its perch. The defiant ghoul tried to dodge\
  \ out from underneath, but it was far too slow. The fiend slammed down on top of\
  \ it, smashed it to the ground, and, stooping, beheaded it with two sweeps of the\
  \ dagger-long talons on the fingertips of its oversized hands.</p> \n    <p>Kagur\
  \ watched to see if the other ghouls would protest the fate of their fellow. But\
  \ even if they felt any such impulse, their master had them too thoroughly cowed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The fiend then pivoted and glared squarely at Kagur and her foster brother\
  \ for the first time. Eovath immediately flung the rock. The missile caught the\
  \ demon just above its batlike snout, but despite the force with which the giant\
  \ had hurled it, the stone glanced away without doing any apparent harm. Ignoring\
  \ the attack, the creature locked eyes with Kagur.</p> \n    <p>Her vision shifted.\
  \ Though Kagur could see that the demon was still crouching over the headless ghoul,\
  \ part of her suddenly had the feeling that it was springing at her. Or perhaps\
  \ she was plummeting toward it, falling sideways in defiance of nature, into eyes\
  \ that yawned like pits to swallow her. Cold pain shot through her, and her heart\
  \ stuttered in her chest.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Demons and the dead\
