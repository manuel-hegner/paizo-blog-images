  \ into a musty cellar crowded with alchemical glassware, stone crucibles, and the\
  \ occasional metal antenna crackling with electricity. Strange-colored fluids in\
  \ uncovered beakers bubble and smoke near jars that hold the remnants of failed\
  \ experiments floating in formaldehyde. A man stands in the center of the room,\
  \ hunched over a table. His hair is wild, and his once-white lab coat has been stained\
  \ with various chemicals. He looks up as you approach, and you can see that his\
  \ table is strewn with papers splotched with ink. He barks out an overexcited laugh,\
  \ followed by a half-choked cry of “The Remaster! Is Finished!”</em></p>\n     \
  \ <p>Hello! Pay no attention to the man in the intro. He was laughed out of the\
  \ university for his unorthodox research. But his theories—and some healthy doses\
  \ of mutagenic mixtures—have led the way for a Remastered version of the alchemist\
  \ class coming in <em>Player Core 2</em>!</p>\n      <p>The alchemist can craft\
  \ chemical concoctions that can aid in all manner of situations. From deadly poisons\
  \ to life-saving elixirs to explosive bombs, an alchemist can whip up the perfect\
  \ item, provided they have the formula. The <em>Core Rulebook</em> version of the\
  \ class had limited resources each day that could be used in multiple ways. However,\
  \ while this was flexible, it created very complex decisions based on guesswork,\
  \ which often ended up disappointing. We wanted to smooth out these choices while\
  \ retaining the core functions of the class.</p>\n      <p>To that end, instead\
  \ of having a large batch of infused reagents at the start of the day that require\
  \ the alchemist to choose how many they are using with advanced alchemy and how\
  \ many to save for Quick Alchemy, these two resources are now separate. Infused\
  \ reagents are gone! At the start of each day, an alchemist makes a certain number\
  \ of alchemical items that they can keep for themself or hand off to friends; remember\
  \ that these items are only good for 24 hours, so be sure to use them!</p>\n   \

  \ alchemist, blows stuff up real good.<br>\n         Art by Federico Musetti</p>\n\
  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>In addition, an alchemist also has a number\
  \ of what we’re calling versatile vials, which are small mixtures of fast-acting\
  \ chemicals that can be easily turned into other consumables. On their own, versatile\
  \ vials can be thrown as acidic bombs, and with the Quick Alchemy action, an alchemist\
  \ can turn a versatile vial into an alchemical consumable they know the formula\
  \ for; this item remains potent until the start of the alchemist’s next turn. Each\
  \ research field presents a unique way for the alchemist to use their versatile\
  \ vials. For example, a mutagenist can drink one of their versatile vials to temporarily\
  \ suppress the drawback of one mutagen they are under the effects of. And a chirurgeon\
  \ can hurl a versatile vial at a willing ally within 20 feet for some distance healing!</p>\n\
  \      <p>The number of versatile vials an alchemist has isn’t a finite daily resource.\
  \ They can replenish their vials over time as they gather alchemical ingredients\
  \ during exploration mode. If things start going poorly, an alchemist can also whip\
  \ up a temporary versatile vial using Quick Alchemy, though it can’t be used to\
  \ make a different kind of item. And the 2nd-level Improvise Admixture feat allows\
  \ the alchemist to scrounge together enough materials for a few extra ready-to-use\
  \ versatile vials once per day as a single action.</p>\n      <p>We found the space\
  \ in this book for toxicology, a research field that was introduced in the <em>Advanced\
  \ Player’s Guide</em>. It’s included here in all its noxious glory, and poisons\
  \ created by such an alchemist deal acid damage instead of poison damage if that\
  \ would be more detrimental. The toxicologist’s 13th-level greater field discovery\
  \ causes a victim of one of their injury poisons to spray that toxin onto an adjacent\
  \ creature, exposing them to the same poison. Not a fun time for the toxicologist’\
  s enemies!</p>\n      <p>Finally, we know a lot of you are curious to hear more\
  \ about the alchemist’s attack proficiencies. Some of the other designers didn’\
  t want me to tell you this, but I’ve slipped some soporifics in their morning coffees,\
  \ so they won’t even notice. Alchemists are still getting their alchemical weapon\
  \ expertise at 7th level, but they now also receive alchemical weapon mastery at\
  \ 15th level. Get those bombs ready!</p>\n      <p>We are very excited for you to\
  \ see the class when <em>Player Core 2</em> releases… soon! So soon, it’s making\
  \ me a little anxious. Perhaps one of these mysterious elixirs left behind by that\
  \ scientist will calm me down… Oh no, what have I done? I feel… What is happening\
  \ to me?!?</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Regurgitate Mutagen [one-action] Feat 4</h3>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Alchemist, Manipulate</strong><br><strong>Requirements</strong>\
  \ You are under the effects of a mutagen.</p>\n      <p>You redirect a mutagen within\
  \ your body to spit a stream of stomach acid at a foe. A creature within 30 feet\
  \ takes 1d6 acid damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex save against\
  \ your class DC. On a failure, the creature is also sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on\
  \ a critical failure). The mutagen’s duration immediately ends.</p>\n      <p style=\"\
