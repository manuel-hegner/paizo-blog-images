  description\">With a cry, Nekhtep kicked his heels into the camel's sides and swung\
  \ the beast toward the ghastly soldier on their left, charging down the dune's face.\
  \ The move seemed to take the skeletal thing by surprise. Moldering flesh hanging\
  \ in loose patches from its skull, the creature raised a longsword only to see the\
  \ weapon driven out of its hands by a powerful blow from Nekhtep's khopesh. The\
  \ Risen Guard's next swing lopped off the unliving soldier's head, which rolled\
  \ down the dune's side, leaving behind shreds of rotting skin on the baking sand.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>As Nekhtep swung the camel around to face the other soldiers, Jasilia\
  \ pried herself free from his grasp and flung herself onto the sand. She tumbled\
  \ down the dune's face, for a moment out of control. She thrust out a leg and dug\
  \ a foot into the sand, sliding to a halt beneath a man-sized shadow.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>A putrid stench wafted over her. She looked up to find a skeletal form looming,\
  \ the desert sun glinting through the thing's partially exposed ribcage. Jasilia\
  \ kicked with all her might, her boot heel slamming into the creature's shin. The\
  \ thing stumbled and fell on top of her. She gagged on the nauseating smell even\
  \ as her sword's point scraped along the unliving soldier's lacquered-leather breastplate\
  \ and lodged somewhere in its bony neck.</p> \n    <p>The skeleton screeched like\
  \ something out of a nightmare, its bony frame shuddering violently, and then was\
  \ still.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia heaved the loose assemblage of bones and armor to\
  \ one side and leapt to her feet. Another wailing skeleton was running at her, an\
  \ ancient-looking axe of black iron raised over its head in two gauntleted hands.\
  \ She turned a shoulder and hurled herself at the thing, her sword angled forward.\
  \ The collision knocked the air from her lungs. It took a few moments to realize\
  \ she had succeeded in thrusting her sword beneath the creature's jaw, completely\
  \ skewering its skull.</p> \n    <p>She leapt to her feet, casting about for her\
  \ next attacker, only to find Nekhtep hacking the sharp edge of his khopesh into\
  \ the face of the last skeleton still standing. The thing fell at his feet.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Nekhtep brought the camel to Jasilia's side and made to dismount, but\
  \ Yamala bleated when it neared the rotting corpse at her feet and refused to let\
  \ him down. Nekhtep circled his mount around her, dark eyes filled with concern.\
  \ Apparently satisfied that she was unhurt, he nodded for Jasilia to follow while\
  \ he strutted Yamala some distance from the corpses and finally managed to bring\
  \ the beast to a halt. Though Yamala's large brown eyes still seemed uneasy, she\
  \ lowered to her knees and allowed Nekhtep to dismount.</p> \n    <p>\"With any\
  \ luck, no one saw what just happened.\" Nekhtep motioned to the dune that blocked\
  \ their view of the bulwarked military garrison and the hordes of unliving soldiers\
  \ that were digging it from the sands.</p> \n    <p>Panting from the exertion of\
  \ battle, Jasilia scabbarded her sword and fell to her knees on the hot sand. \"\
  Those soldiers,\" she said, trying to regain her breath. \"They—\"</p> \n    <div\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Not all skeletons are created equal\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Nekhtep's stare cut off her words.</p> \n    <p>\"What is it?\" she asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Risen Guard said nothing. Instead, he signaled for Yamala to rise\
  \ and walked the camel to Jasilia's side. His face was solemn, almost mournful.\
  \ \"Wait here.\"</p> \n    <p>Jasilia did as instructed, eyeing the man quizzically\
  \ as he passed her the reins.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep walked back over to the corpses\
  \ while Jasilia tried to soothe the skittish camel. She watched as Nekhtep knelt\
  \ beside one of the skeletons and wrenched something free from its neck. Then he\
  \ took a bag from the corpse's hip and shook out its contents, kneeling over the\
  \ scattering of coins that had fallen onto the sand. A few moments later he was\
  \ back at Jasilia's side, a silver medallion dangling from a chain that he held\
  \ in his hand with a kerchief, as if he didn't want to defile the object with his\
  \ touch.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia gasped, her stomach roiling with fear and sickness.\
  \ The royal seal of the Forthbringers stamped upon the medallion's face.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Don't worry, that's not Ojan back there,\" Nekhtep said as if reading\
  \ her thoughts. \"I'd thought it might be, but I was wrong. Here, take a look.\"\
  \ He dropped the medallion and chain to the sand and thumbed a gold coin from the\
  \ folds of his kerchief.</p> \n    <p>\"Stamped in Thuvia over five thousand years\
  \ ago, like all the rest in the thing's possession.\" Nekhtep twirled the coin and\
  \ presented its face to Jasilia. \"These soldiers lived—and died—during the reign\
  \ of Yafeha I.\"</p> \n    <p>\"My brother... None of those <i>things</i> is...\"\
  \ Jasilia began to choke up, then steeled her will and began again. \"My brother\
  \ isn't among the corpses, then?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No. But if this was the group\
  \ that captured him and he isn't among them, it can mean only one of two things.\"\
  \ Nekhtep left his statement hanging.</p> \n    <p>\"That he's dead, or that they\
  \ brought him <i>there</i>.\" Jasilia pointed through the dune that stood between\
  \ them and Mekshir.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep nodded. \"I'm sorry. I should have insisted\
  \ that we go to Shiman-Sekh for help. But I've never been able to say no to you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jasilia knelt on the scalding sand and began rifling through her sack.\
  \ \"You've never been able to say <i>anything</i> these past six months. But now's\
  \ not the time to get sentimental, guardsman.\" She dug deeper into the bag. \"\
  Now where is it? Ah, here we go.\"</p> \n    <p>From the depths of her sack she\
  \ pulled out a small bundle of crimson linen.</p> \n    <p>\"What is it?\" Nekhtep\
  \ asked.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia smiled grimly up at him. \"Our ticket into Mekshir.\
  \ I hope.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Jasilia drew Yamala\
  \ close and whispered in her ear, then clapped the beast on the rear. Instantly,\
  \ the camel took off, heading away from the fortress until she was lost from sight\
  \ among the dunes.</p> \n    <p>With great care, Jasilia unwrapped the little bundle\
  \ she had removed from her bag until she exposed the treasure swaddled within the\
  \ cloth: a dried and neatly pressed desert rose shot with the colors of a spectacular\
  \ Osirian sunset. She placed the flower on her open palm and began tracing the air\
  \ with her other hand, outlining the archaic hieroglyph for Ra, the ancient sun\
  \ god. As her hand continued to sketch the invisible character, she began to mutter\
  \ in low tones the tongue of her long-dead ancestors. She was thankful she had forced\
  \ herself to pause long enough at the outset of their journey to prepare the spell.\
  \ The hope it gave her was faint, but she had to try.</p> \n    <p>She concentrated,\
  \ forcing every thought from her mind. Just as she succeeded in losing herself in\
  \ the antiquated words and phrasings, a flame roared up from the desert a half-dozen\
  \ yards before her. A gust of hot air swept over her as the flame took on a fiery,\
  \ snakelike form, vacillating in size from three to four feet tall as it undulated,\
  \ coiling and uncoiling like an agitated asp.</p> \n    <p>\"You've been practicing,\
  \ I see.\" Nekhtep took a step back from the elemental being, as if unsure of her\
  \ ability to keep it under her command.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia ignored him and addressed\
  \ the fiery creature in Ancient Osiriani, her voice charged with regal authority.\
  \ \"I am the holy heir to Osirion's throne. Obey me, servitor.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ being's serpentine head lowered in obeisance.</p> \n    <p>She gave the creature\
  \ its instructions while Nekhtep looked on in awed silence. She finished her behest\
  \ by jabbing a finger to the northeast. A mouth formed out of the reddish-orange\
  \ flames of the elemental's ophidian face, a smoldering tongue of fire flitting\
  \ out of the orifice as if to taste her words. Then the thing sped off in the direction\
  \ Jasilia had indicated, slithering along the scalding sands toward its goal.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Now follow me and do exactly as I do,\" Jasilia said.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep\
  \ nodded curtly, and Jasilia took off into the dunes without looking back to see\
  \ whether the Risen Guard was behind her. She knew Nekhtep would follow her to the\
  \ ends of the earth—not because of any lingering sentiment, but because the pharaoh\
  \ had commanded him to protect her at all costs. So be it. Anything that helped\
  \ her save Ojan was good enough for her.</p> \n    <p>She ran on, drawing on many\
  \ years of desert living to choose the best route through the dunes that would keep\
  \ them from being seen. Nekhtep's bootfalls thudded softly in the sands behind her,\
  \ his breaths becoming increasingly heavier. Though the guard was much stronger\
  \ than she, the desert had taught her endurance, and Jasilia only felt barely winded\
  \ by the time they emerged from a little valley of sand and found the fortress's\
  \ western wall looming a couple hundred yards away.</p> \n    <p>All along the steep\
  \ bank of sand rising up to Mekshir's half-buried walls, the undead soldiers had\
  \ risen from their tasks and were shambling off to the east. High on the wall walks\
  \ the soldiers were also moving to get a glimpse of the elemental burning its way\
  \ across the sands below the eastern ramparts. Though the nearest skeletons were\
  \ still but a few dozen yards away, Jasilia motioned for Nekhtep to follow. The\
  \ spell would only buy them so much time.</p> \n    <p>They ran up the dune toward\
  \ the western wall, leg muscles straining. When they reached the wall, they sprinted\
  \ along it until they reached the southwestern corner.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia cursed\
  \ softly when Nekhtep grabbed her by the arm and pushed her roughly behind him,\
  \ holding her back as he peered around the corner. She struggled in his grip to\
  \ no avail; he was simply too strong. But not too nimble, she thought, and drove\
  \ her heel into the back of his knee.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep thrust a hand against\
  \ the wall's rough red stone to keep from falling, and Jasilia broke free from his\
  \ grasp.</p> \n    <p>She clucked her tongue as if she were chiding a small child.\
  \ \"Now, now, we'll have none of that.\" She stepped around him and gazed along\
  \ the southern wall. To the east she could see a tiny flame in the distance, scorching\
  \ its way across the sand at great speed as the legion of unliving soldiers swarmed\
  \ after it. The elemental was doing exactly as she had commanded, slithering in\
  \ among the soldiers and then slithering quickly out, taunting them with its proximity.\
  \ The fiery being from another plane sped along at almost twice the speed of the\
  \ soldiers, zipping off after each brief penetration of their ranks and drawing\
  \ them ever farther to the southeast.</p> \n    <p>She punched Nekhtep hard in the\
  \ shoulder. \"Now cut out the chivalry bit, all right?\" Then she sprinted along\
  \ the wall for the nearest ladder the undead had been using to clean sand from parapets.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When she reached it, she jumped up and began climbing, Nekhtep close\
  \ at her heels. Only a short distance up, she lost her grip as she placed her hand\
  \ upon a slick board. She managed to grab another board and cling to it, but found\
  \ it was also wet to the touch.</p> \n    <p>A violent retch threatened to surge\
  \ up as she realized the reason for the boards' slickness. Spongy patches of rotting\
  \ flesh, bits of internal organs, and various bodily fluids spattered the ladder's\
  \ wooden steps. She clamped her teeth together and tried to swallow back the rising\
  \ bile, focusing her thoughts on her mission—to rescue her brother from the horrific\
  \ things that inhabited the fortress—and resumed her climb.</p> \n    <p>Her hands\
  \ filthy and her once-white burnoose now streaked with the detritus of undeath,\
  \ she could finally see the rim of the wall walk just above. She pulled herself\
  \ up, hand over hand, driven only by the thought of getting off the disgusting ladder\
  \ as quickly as possible. When at last she reached her goal, she pulled her head\
  \ up over the ledge—and gazed into the face of her worst nightmare.</p> \n    <p>\"\
