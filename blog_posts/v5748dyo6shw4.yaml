  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“I don’\
  t like the look of that <em>sloop</em>,” said Daker, punctuating the last word with\
  \ his ever-present sneer.</p> \n     <p>Callum extended his spyglass and directed\
  \ it at the little vessel, a little less than two hundred feet to port. Its crew\
  \ scurried about their duties as the sun reached for the golden edge of the western\
  \ horizon.</p> \n     <p>“A fisherman,” said Callum, still scanning the deck of\
  \ the other vessel, “returning home. Not everyone’s a pirate, Gaius.”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“We’re in the Shackles, Orrin,” answered Daker, still sneering at the smaller\
  \ ship. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re all pirates, ‘til they prove otherwise.”\
  </p> \n     <p>They had the poopdeck of the <em>Madam Diabola</em> to themselves,\
  \ a sleek Chelish warship armed with the latest in cannon technology, each devil-mouthed\
  \ barrel etched with a magic sigil which promised every shot they fired would fly\
  \ deadly and true. The <em>Madam</em> was given the honor of watching this insignificant\
  \ settlement’s harbor while Admiral Lecarnas and the rest of the punitive fleet\
  \ sailed off to lay siege to Drenchport that very morning. Callum didn’t even know\
  \ the town’s name, but he also didn’t care.</p> \n     <p>“I grant you, she’s a\
  \ bold one,” Callum answered, watching as the sloop slowly moved in their direction.\
  \ “Must’ve sailed out early morning, before we sealed the harbor. We could just\
  \ warn her off with a hazard flag.”</p> \n     <p>Gaius Daker was too bloodthirsty\
  \ in Callum’s opinion, even if he was his oldest friend from his Fort Gorthoklek\
  \ days. Too enthusiastic with the sap when leading a press gang, too ready to—</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Fire a bit of iron across her bow with that pretty new swivel gun,”\
  \ said Daker, eyeing the polished little cannon mounted on the port rail. “And beat\
  \ to quarters. Lads and ladies need a bit of exercise, to keep ‘em on their toes.”\
  </p> \n     <p><em>Madam Diabola</em> was one of three vessels in the fleet outfitted\
  \ with the new weapons, swivel guns similar to smaller versions of the black iron\
  \ cannons on the decks below, tended by scurrying halfling prisoners the crew had\
  \ taken to calling “powder rats.” Gaius Daker wanted to hear the cannon roar. Callum\
  \ thought such impulse foolish. Would the captain approve of such actions?</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Gaius,” began Callum, but swallowed the rest of his words when he caught\
  \ Daker’s glare. He knew that look well. Daker was senior midshipman of the watch,\
  \ and his words were no mere suggestion. That dark look made it an order.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Beat to quarters!” Callum shouted, turning to the swivel gun.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Sailors across the vessel leapt into action and the sound of martial drums\
  \ filled the air. Callum couldn’t help but admire the artistry of the little bronze\
  \ cannon, mounted on the gunwale, its mouth fashioned like a dragon’s maw, fangs\
  \ bent outward. He checked the breech, pleased to find it properly loaded and ready.\
  \ Captain Hecata was fond of the lash, and her newly trained gun crews knew this\
  \ better than most. They tended Madam’s newfangled weapons of war well, out of fear\
  \ if not pride.</p> \n     <p>The sloop was much closer now, turning to port so\
  \ that it showed Madam her broad side. Callum, ready at the gunwale, turned to look\
  \ at Gaius Daker, who he caught tugging at his officer’s jacket to sharpen the lines\
  \ of his uniform.</p> \n     <p>“They’re giving us a fat target, Gaius,” Callum\
  \ said, a bit of pleading in his voice. “Maybe a signal flag’ll do the trick.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“A signal flag, Mister Callum?” came the lilting alto of Captain Hecata\
  \ as she climbed up onto the poopdeck. “Perhaps I should prepare tea for these Shackles\
  \ scum while you wave silk at them? What have we here, Mister Daker?”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Gaius, eyes alight with bloodlust and just plan lust, grinned at the captain\
  \ and saluted. </p> \n     <p>“Suspicious vessel off the port, Captain! I ordered\
  \ Midshipman Callum to fire a warning shot across her bow!”</p> \n     <p>Callum\
  \ grimaced. Just like Gaius to throw him overboard if it made him shine a bit brighter\
  \ in Hecata’s emerald eyes. Daker offered the captain his spyglass and she took\
  \ it, rewarding him with one of her unreadable smiles that could as easily portend\
  \ divine preferment as utter doom. She looked through Daker’s brass device and within\
  \ a heartbeat repeated the midshipman’s order.</p> \n     <p>“Mister Callum, fire\
  \ that shot. And I wouldn’t be cross with you if that shot puts a crimson part in\
  \ someone’s hair.”</p> \n     <p>Callum nodded and turned the swivel gun in the\
  \ direction the sloop’s starboard bow. He angled the shot as low as he dared—Hecata\
  \ might not care if he took off some poor bastard’s head, but he did. He asked a\
  \ blessing from Abadar and fired the cannon. The shot ripped a hole low in the sloop’\
  s staysail and a cry of fear washed across the space between the vessels, announcing\
  \ the sloop crew’s shock.</p> \n     <p>A woman in a long coat came to the starboard\
  \ rail of the sloop, waving both arms frantically.</p> \n     <p>“Ahoy, Chelish\
  \ warship!” the woman cried, long brown locks freed as she added her hat to her\
  \ call for mercy. “We’re honest fishermen, bringing a bellyful to our little island!\
  \ See how low we ride?”</p> \n     <p>Callum noted the ship was indeed running awfully\
  \ low in the water.</p> \n     <p>“You feed pirates then?” shouted Captain Hecata\
  \ with a contemptuous air, hands on her hips.</p> \n     <p>“Nay! Settlers, eking\
  \ out a life in these hard islands! Shelly is a free port, and we give no allegiance\
  \ to any pirate lord!”</p> \n     <p>“Our intelligence says otherwise,” said the\
  \ captain, and Callum saw she wore that same smile she had given to Gaius. Those\
  \ fishermen had best say their prayers. It was clear now where this encounter was\
  \ headed.</p> \n     <p>Callum joined the naval academy in Hinji when it became\
  \ clear his mercurial father would favor his younger brother when the inheritance\
  \ was doled out. He had been fed tales of high adventure on the open seas, contending\
  \ with the elements and wild creatures, bloodthirsty pirates and rebels intent on\
  \ bringing Cheliax to its knees. Instead, he found himself part of an instrument\
  \ of intimidation. Well-armed nautical bullies.</p> \n     <p>“There are a dozen\
  \ innocent souls on this ship, captain!” the brown-haired mariner in the sloop called\
  \ out across the water. “We bring back the bounty of the sea to feed hungry bellies.\
  \ Men, women, and children. No more, no less. I beg you let us pass!”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The woman’s last words were made with hands clasped together, as if offering\
  \ up a prayer.</p> \n     <p>“Prepare to be boarded,” sang Captain Hecata, drawing\
  \ her cutlass and nodding to Midshipman Daker, who wore a giddy grin on his face.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Callum looked back at the sloop, the long-haired fisherwoman, hands\
  \ still clasped like a supplicant…and then his eyes caught a shimmer, as though\
  \ he looked at a painting behind glass, tilted to catch the sun’s rays. A warning\
  \ tingled at the base of his spine. He turned to share his misgivings with the captain,\
  \ when the unmistakable sound of a cannon report, several in fact, sent him instinctively\
  \ to the deck, prostrate with his arms cradling his head. The first ball struck\
  \ the portside railing on the quarterdeck below, obliterating wood and sending deadly\
  \ splinters in all directions. The second tore through Gaius Daker, reducing him\
  \ to an ugly spray of red.</p> \n     <p>In the next moment Callum was helping the\
  \ captain up from the deck, one side of her smart Chelish uniform painted with Daker’\
  s blood. </p> \n     <p>“Return fire!” she roared, shaking off Callum’s assistance.\
  \ “By all the tines in Hell, that’s no bloody fisherman!”</p> \n     <p>Callum glanced\
  \ to his left—the sloop was gone. In its place was a black-sailed brigantine, the\
  \ iron mouths of cannon protruding from open gun ports, its main deck alive with\
  \ surly-looking sailors brandishing weapons.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ he thought as <em>Madam Diabola’s</em> new guns answered the brigantine’s attack.\
  \ But it was as if the wind took the iron hurled at their enemy away like fallen\
  \ leaves. Of its sixteen guns, only a single cannonball connected with their chameleon\
  \ foe. What sorcery did these brigands have at their disposal? Illusion to disguise\
  \ a warship? Elemental servants to carry away iron shot? </p> \n     <p>It was then\
  \ that Callum caught sight of the brown-haired woman again. He could swear she was\
  \ smiling at him directly, and as if to confirm it, she gave him a jovial wave and\
  \ held her hands up to her mouth to trumpet her words across the now-smoky distance.</p>\
