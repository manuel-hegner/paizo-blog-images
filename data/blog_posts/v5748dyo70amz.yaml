  ></a>\n     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The village\
  \ was scared, that much Grimmyr could sense. While by now he was used to many of\
  \ the peoples of Golarion being intimidated by his towering form, this fear had\
  \ nothing to do with him. It had clearly seeped into the community long before he\
  \ arrived. The faces of the townsfolk were pale and tired. Their movements were\
  \ slow and languid, as if a heavy weight pressed down upon them. It even seemed\
  \ to affect the atmosphere—dark clouds gathered overhead, and the flowers ringing\
  \ the small stone plinth at the center of the village green were wilted and dying.\
  \ Grimmyr’s heart ached to see such distress.</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr ducked under\
  \ a hanging sign painted with a tankard of ale and opened the door to what he hoped\
  \ was a tavern or inn. While his people had no such formal meeting spaces in the\
  \ Fray, he had learned that these businesses were good places to gather information.\
  \ Inside, he drew the stares of several residents and a pair of individuals who\
  \ were as armed and armored as himself.</p>\n      <p>“A fellow mercenary!” shouted\
  \ the taller of the two, waving over to Grimmyr. Her skin was tanned from long hours\
  \ in the sun, her blonde hair was cut roughly, and her friendly grin showed more\
  \ than one missing tooth. “Come to protect the fine people of Northfork from the\
  \ monsters?” she asked.</p>\n      <p>“Of course he is, Aliss,” said the other.\
  \ He was stout and bearded, the long reddish hairs twisted into two neat braids.\
  \ His eyebrows were less groomed, as if left to cover the missing hair on his head.\
  \ “Look at the size of ‘im.”</p>\n      <p>“Monsters?” Grimmyr asked, his voice\
  \ surprisingly soft.</p>\n      <p>“Aye,” said the one named Aliss. “Scaly buggers\
  \ that crawl up out of the well just outside of town from time to time. No one knows\
  \ what’s drivin’ them into a frenzy, but his holiness Mordruk and me are only gettin’\
  \ paid to kill them.” She winked at a scowling Mordruk.</p>\n      <p>“Only been\
  \ here about a week,” said Mordruk. “But it’s been getting worse and—” he was cut\
  \ off by the ringing of a bell outside and shouts of “They’re here!”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>With a chuckle, Aliss picked up the longsword leaning against the wall and\
  \ strode toward the door. “Best hold your breath, new guy,” she said. Mordruk raised\
  \ the hood of his white cloak and followed without offering an explanation.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Outside, panic gripped the town. From behind closed doors, Grimmyr could\
  \ hear children crying and furniture being moved to form makeshift barricades. Aliss\
  \ and Mordruk hurried eastward, alongside farmers armed with pitchforks and shovels,\
  \ toward the sound of guttural snarls. As Grimmyr passed by the plinth, the sight\
  \ of the dying flora sent a foreboding chill down his spine.</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr\
  \ smelled the creatures before he saw them. It was a terrible, musty odor of sweat\
  \ and stale air that crept into the nostrils and down the back of the throat. He\
  \ gagged briefly but pushed through the nausea. Some of the farmers weren’t so fortunate,\
  \ as they stopped to retch. Aliss and Mordruk had already rounded a corner ahead\
  \ of him, and as Grimmyr followed, he was taken aback by the number of creatures\
  \ emerging from the well past the edge of town. <em>Will there be no end to them?</em>\
  \ he thought. Mordruk uttered a desperate prayer under his breath, and Grimmyr sensed\
  \ that he and Aliss had not yet faced a force of such size here.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ creatures were reptilian humanoids with mottled gray scaly hides and bony protrusions\
  \ the length of their spines made more prominent by their hunching posture. Their\
  \ heads and tails resembled those of cave lizards, and they wore rudimentary hides\
  \ and wielded simple clubs, if they carried any weapons at all. Each and every one\
  \ of them exuded that earthy stench. Many wore necklaces of stone chunks on leather\
  \ cords; Grimmyr found them familiar but couldn’t place why.</p>\n      <p>The next\
  \ hour was a grueling struggle against the odds. The townsfolk fought the best they\
  \ could, holding back the monstrous tide, but it was clear they would eventually\
  \ be overwhelmed. Aliss cleaved through torsos with her blade, smirking all the\
  \ while until Grimmyr could see her arms growing weary. Mordruk called down divine\
  \ magic to keep her and the farmers standing, though even Grimmyr knew such power\
  \ would not last forever. For his part, Grimmyr waded into the throng of creatures,\
  \ swinging his flail in wide sweeps and relying on his armor to turn aside claw,\
  \ tooth, and club. The field became littered with piles of corpses of the creatures…\
  \ and sadly, more than a few villagers.</p>\n      <p>A bellow drew everyone’s attention\
  \ back to the well, where something struggled to emerge. Though this new creature\
  \ shared some similarities to the ones they had been fighting, its hide was the\
  \ red of fresh clay and it towered over the others, only a foot or two shorter than\
  \ Grimmyr. It dragged a stone maul behind as it stomped toward a villager.</p>\n\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>“No! Face me!” bellowed Grimmyr, knowing a strike\
  \ from that hammer could crush a skull. That got the creature’s attention, and it\
  \ came charging toward him. He blocked the first blow with the haft of his own weapon,\
  \ but the second hit him square in the chest, almost winding him. With a grunt,\
  \ Grimmyr swung his flail in an upward motion against the creature’s chin, snapping\
  \ its neck. The maul fell to the ground, and the grass around the weapon’s head\
  \ began to turn brown almost instantly.</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr knew what he needed\
  \ to do next.</p>\n      <p>He sprinted back into town, toward the village green.\
  \ With a mighty strike from his flail, he shattered the stone plinth. A small explosion\
  \ of force sent him stumbling backward. He lost his balance and fell, hitting his\
  \ head against a tree stump and knocking him out.</p>\n      <p>When he awoke, Aliss\
  \ and Mordruk were standing above him. “What did you do, new guy?” Aliss asked.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“The stone. It was calling to them.”</p>\n      <p>“The fight left ‘em\
  \ as soon as you smashed it,” Mordruk said. “The townsfolk must have dredged it\
  \ up out of the well. How did you know?”</p>\n      <p>Grimmyr smiled weakly, the\
  \ aches and pains of the battle catching up to him. “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I’m\
  \ here to keep you all safe.”</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
