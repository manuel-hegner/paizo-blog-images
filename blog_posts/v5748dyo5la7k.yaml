  \ To Detail: The Story Behind Pathfinder's Supporting Material</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Saturday, April 21, 2007</p> \n   <p>When coming up with the format for <i>Pathfinder</i>,\
  \ one of the biggest questions we faced as a team was, \"Okay, adventure path, check—\
  but what <i>else</i> is going to be in there?\" While we knew that the adventure\
  \ that is the heart of each volume would grab people, that only accounts for a bit\
  \ over half of each book. Something that's hard to grasp until you're actually staring\
  \ down the barrel of a pagination is just how <i>massive</i> each one of these books\
  \ is going to be—without in-text ads to eat up space, almost a hundred pages is\
  \ a daunting amount of white space. What were we going to put there? </p>\n   <p>Ideas\
  \ flowed fast and furious, and many of them quickly crashed and burned. Everything\
  \ from familiar content like appendices of magic items and reports on current gaming\
  \ news to outlandish proposals like a miniature Adventure-Path-related comic book\
  \ in every issue (my own misguided suggestion, and an undertaking only slightly\
  \ less expensive than putting a man on Mars). In the end, however, we came up with\
  \ two guiding principles for all \"back matter\" (as we've taken to calling the\
  \ supplementary pieces). </p>\n   <p>1. Everything in an issue of <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ must be actively useful to a DM running the Adventure Path. </p>\n   <p>2. At\
  \ least some of it needs to be fun and useful for players as well as DMs. </p>\n\
  \   <p>While one of the nice things about the <i>Pathfinder</i> format is that supplementary\
  \ pieces have the luxury of being more free-form with their structure, much of the\
  \ back matter in Pathfinder falls into one of the following general categories.\
  \ </p>\n   <p><b>Cities and Regions:</b> One of the strongest selling points of\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i>, in my mind, is that it gives you literally EVERYTHING you need\
  \ to run a campaign. While we of course encourage people to adapt the Adventure\
  \ Path to their own homebrew campaign worlds—some of us at the office are doing\
  \ the same thing—we also think it's important to make the setting itself as compelling\
  \ as the plot. In Rise of the Runelords alone, we have three extensive city write-ups\
  \ detailing cities that the PCs will visit in the course of their travels—Sandpoint,\
  \ Magnimar, and Xin-Shalast. These aren't just town stat blocks—these are massive\
  \ affairs filled with locations, NPCs, backstory, encounters, and maps of surpassing\
  \ intricacy and beauty. (You'd think I was exaggerating, but when Wes Schneider\
  \ brought in the map he'd drawn of the city of Magnimar, site of the second adventure,\
  \ I would have sworn he'd traced it off of Google Maps... there was simply too much\
  \ detail. When asked how he managed it, he shrugged and replied, \"latent obsessive-compulsive\
  \ tendencies, I suppose.\") In addition, we'll also have a large-scale map of the\
  \ entire region of Varisia, in which Rise of the Runelords takes place, with write-ups\
  \ for dozens of locations that simultaneously help flesh out the world and give\
  \ you instant story starters for additional adventures. (I don't know about you,\
  \ but I'm always a huge fan of provocative regional maps that give you just enough\
  \ flavor to get your mind going, then turn you loose.) </p>\n   <p><b>Ecological\
  \ Write-ups:</b> Designing a new setting and working under the OGL means that we\
  \ have the opportunity to introduce new monsters and re-imagine classic ones. (If\
  \ you want a taste of where we're headed, scroll down to the last blog post on the\
  \ goblins in our world.) In Rise of the Runelords, we plan to reveal our vision\
  \ for stone giants and dragons in depth, taking things beyond a mere MM entry and\
  \ showing you their society, their beliefs, their insides... in short, everything\
  \ that makes them tick. Because while a good illustration can make a monster intriguing,\
  \ it's how they think (and how you play them) that makes them great adversaries.\
  \ </p>\n   <p><b>Gods and Demons:</b> Similar to my feelings on monsters, I think\
  \ that gods and demons (somewhat interchangeable terms in our world) are the most\
  \ fun when they have engaging stories. Several times in each Adventure Path, we'll\
  \ pick one of the gods or demons from our campaign setting and give you an in-depth\
  \ look at everything about them, from their story and stats to their worshippers\
  \ and heralds. For the first path, that'll be Desna, Song of the Spheres and patron\
  \ of gypsies, and Lamashtu, the Goddess of Monstrous Birth. </p>\n   <p><b>Additional\
  \ Encounters:</b> What if your party skipped half the encounters in part of an adventure,\
  \ or heads off in a direction you hadn't expected? Additional encounters in the\
  \ region, conveniently tied to the Adventure Path, can help save you a lot of scrambling.\
  \ </p>\n   <p><b>Bestiary:</b> One of the few supplementary sections guaranteed\
  \ to be in each issue, the <i>Pathfinder</i> bestiary will contain a number of brand-new\
  \ monsters each month, both actively involved in the adventure and unrelated but\
  \ thematically tied. For a sneak preview of what sorts of creatures you can expect\
  \ to see in the first volume, keep watching this blog! </p>\n   <p><b>NPCs:</b>\
  \ It takes more than just a stat block to make a fun NPC, and whenever possible,\
  \ Pathfinder will present the supporting cast—both heroes and villains—in an expanded\
  \ format designed to be easily to cut-and-pasted into other adventures. </p>\n \
  \  <p><b>Pathfinder Journal:</b> One of the other constants in the back matter,\
  \ the Pathfinder Journal will explore a new aspect of our campaign setting each\
  \ month and help tie together elements of both <i>Pathfinder</i> and the 32-page\
  \ GameMastery Modules, helping to increase cohesion and give you even more options\
  \ for expansion. </p>\n   <p><b>Miscellaneous Crunch:</b> Ah, the joy of the miscellaneous\
  \ category! Here you'll find everything from new spells, rules, and feats tied to\
  \ sin magic (a magic system tied to the seven deadly sins and utilized by the Runelords)\
  \ to pieces on how to run and maintain your own keep or castle. </p>\n   <p><b>History:</b>\
  \ I'm sure that by now you're probably getting the general gist of the <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ ideology, but the history of a game world is just as important—and potentially\
  \ inspiring—as it's geography. A chance for us (not to mention some of the biggest\
  \ names in the RPG business) to shade in the historical background of our world?\
  \ Yes, please! </p>\n   <p><b>Pre-generated Characters:</b> Never again will you\
  \ have to worry about players forgetting their character sheets at home. Each volume\
  \ of <i>Pathfinder</i> will feature pre-generated characters based on Wayne Reynolds's\
  \ stunning depictions of the Paizo iconics, allowing you and your party to grab\
  \ the book and jump straight into the adventure with a minimum of prep time. </p>\n\
  \   <p>Whew! Keep in mind that those are only a few of the broad categories you\
  \ might find in each volume—as I mentioned before, one of the things that excites\
  \ me most about <i>Pathfinder</i> personally is our freedom to run the pieces that\
  \ need to be run, regardless of whether or not they fit in with an established section.\
  \ To build something from the ground up and have the authority to experiment is\
  \ a glorious thing, and I believe strongly that when an author says, \"how detailed\
  \ should section XXX be?\" and we can answer, \"as much as it needs to be,\" everyone\
  \ wins... especially the reader. </p>\n   <p>James Sutter <br>Assistant Editor,\
