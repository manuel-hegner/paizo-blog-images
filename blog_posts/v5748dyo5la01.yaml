  \ Taking Back Escapism</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 27, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p>Well, here we are—the final installment in Michael Moorcock's Kane of Old\
  \ Mars trilogy. In <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8c\">City of the Beast</a></i>,\
  \ Moorcock first introduced us to the steely-eyed physicist and swordsman Michael\
  \ Kane, a man catapulted across space and time by a chance invention, who hit the\
  \ ground running and managed to make himself a prince of the violent, vibrant world\
  \ that is ancient Mars. Moorcock himself has said that, in the early days of his\
  \ career, he would sometimes only give himself a few days to write a book, and in\
  \ that seminal Michael Kane tale, we felt that breathless pace—the prose light and\
  \ quick, the images coming in fast succession as Kane fought blue giants, cities\
  \ of thieves, and vast subterranean monsters. In its sequel, <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdp\"\
  >Lord of the Spiders</a></i>, Michael Kane—yanked cruelly back to Earth by his fellow\
  \ scientists—manages to return to his adopted world, only to find himself in a place\
  \ (and perhaps time!) far removed from his beloved green city of Varnal and the\
  \ gorgeous princess waiting there. With Lord of the Spiders, Moorcock keeps the\
  \ same breakneck pace, but the story as a whole feels darker, as Kane's adventures\
  \ become colored by his despair and deal with darker subject matter—genocide, revolution,\
  \ and assassination.</p> \n   <p>In <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hq\">Masters\
  \ of the Pit</a></i>, Moorcock returns a final time to the familiar characters of\
  \ Mars, who by this point feel like old friends—Hool Haji the blue giant, steadfast\
  \ Princess Shizala, and of course Michael Kane. Yet rather than rehashing either\
  \ of the book's predecessors, Moorcock takes the story in yet another new direction,\
  \ this time with a more philosophical bent. While much of the story deals with Kane\
  \ and Hool Haji traveling (and frequently battling their way) across the world in\
  \ search of a cure for a deadly plague, the focus of the story seems to be not on\
  \ the violent struggle, but on the moral one. By far the stars of the show in my\
  \ mind are the citizens of Cend-Amrid, who in their attempt to survive through machine-like\
  \ efficiency have succeeded in killing everything that made them human. Adding to\
  \ the theme are the dog-men of Hahg, degenerate mutants that continue to cowardly\
  \ serve the evil, winged First Masters even though freedom lies easily within their\
  \ grasp. Or there's always the barbaric horde of Rokin the Gold—crude, lowbrow raiders\
  \ who Kane nevertheless comes to respect for the sheer passion with which they live.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>As with much of Robert E. Howard's work—and, honestly, most of the early\
  \ pulp masters—it's this respect for the individual, the enshrining of action and\
  \ free will as the ultimate good, that permeates Moorcock's last adventure in this\
  \ series. It is, at its heart, a rebellion against the modern world where—much like\
  \ the men of Cend-Amrid—many of us feel trapped as tiny cogs in a vast machine,\
  \ one whose function we have little control over. And if there's anything that Moorcock's\
  \ writing offers us, it's freedom. In a world where \"escapist\" is often a derogatory\
  \ term, Moorcock stands up and wears the label proudly, and <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hq\"\
  >Masters of the Pit</a></i> is a shining example.</p> \n   <p>I don't know about\
  \ you, but I'm with him.</p> \n   <p> James Sutter <br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
