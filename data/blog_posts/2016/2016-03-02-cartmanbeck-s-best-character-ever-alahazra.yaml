              <h1 itemprop="headline">Cartmanbeck's Best Character Ever—Alahazra</h1>
              <p class="date">Tuesday, March 1, 2016</p>
              <div itemprop="articlebody">
               <p>Hello all! I've been reading the "Best Character Ever" blogs for a while. Watching. Waiting. Biding my time until I got the perfect chance to explain why every one of them has been completely and utterly wrong (except Tanis's: goblins are pretty cool, after all.) <em>[I did not add that aside, but I applaud the author's good sense. -Tanis]</em> But even goblins do not compare to the awesome might that is Alahazra.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraFront.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraFront_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>If those white and red robes remind you of a certain classic video game character... trust me, she's not quite so forgiving.</em>
               </div>
               <p itemprop="description">Alahazra, the iconic oracle, made her first <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Adventure Card Game</a> appearance in the <a href="/products/btpy92zj"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</em></a>. She may look weak at first, with her paltry d4s for Strength and Dexterity, but she sees things that others can't, and uses that information to beat down on enemies, acquire cards, and close locations like a <em>boss</em>. You see, S&amp;S Alahazra has a d12 for her Charisma, and she also uses that for her Divine checks. This means that when it's time to cast an offensive spell, she's often going to deal a ton of damage, especially with her final power giving her an extra +2 on all spells that have the Attack trait. She also has a great chance of recharging her spells with that high Divine check... but even when she fails a recharge check, she gets to trade any discarded card with the Divine trait for any other one (so a blessing for a spell, perhaps?) at the end of her turn.</p>
               <p>Alahazra's other main power is the ability to recharge a card with the Divine trait to examine the top card of any location. This means that Alahazra can scout for everyone as long as she has a few blessings or spells in her hand that she doesn't mind recharging. (And she starts with 2/3 of her deck being spells and blessings!) In my playthrough of <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, I found that a perfect turn for Alahazra entailed recharging enough cards to look at the top card of every location deck, leaving just a spell in her hand, and then exploring and hopefully killing a monster with that spell.</p>
               <p>Now, I'm not going to try to act like Alahazra has no weaknesses. If she's dealt damage, since she starts with no armor, she'll usually be taking all of that damage from her large hand size. With her ability to fish Cure spells back out of her discard pile, though, this generally doesn't end up being a huge problem. Our S&amp;S Damiel was at risk of dying way more often than my Alahazra was. (Though our Damiel player was a fan of living dangerously... this might be an Alchemist trait.)</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraTempest.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraTempest_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraStargazer.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraStargazer_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>If Alahazra isn't gazing into the stars, she might as well be destroying them.</em>
               </div>
               <p>For roles, I'm going to start with the Tempest. This role is all about damaging enemies with her spells. In fact, she likes spells that have the Attack trait so much, she can even cast Arcane spells as long as they have that trait! She also adds up to 4 to each of her combat checks when using the Attack trait, so she can dole out some serious punishment.</p>
               <p>But while Alahazra's Tempest role is great, her Stargazer role is absolutely <em>amazing</em>! This role gives her several powers that build upon her examine ability, allowing her to recharge cards for other characters or—and this is the important one—<em>encounter</em> boons that she examines at any location! This means that, for the price of recharging a blessing or a Divine spell, Alahazra can examine a card at another location, and if it's a boon, she can attempt to acquire it. If she makes the check, awesome, new boon for her! But even if she fails the check, she has just removed a card from the top of another location deck without risking fighting a monster. By the end of <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, my Alahazra was spending her whole turn recharging blessings to rip boons off the top of every deck, leaving all the monsters for other combatants to face.</p>
               <p>The <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> version of Alahazra was amazing, the best character I've ever played... and now in the <a href=""><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>, we're getting a NEW version of her! This Alahazra is tougher and more combat-oriented than the S&amp;S version, so I imagine she'll appeal to a different group of players. Don't worry, though, she still has the ability to examine cards and scout ahead.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraFront.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraBack.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraBack_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>Just as beautiful, and even more deadly.</em>
               </div>
               <p>This new version of Alahazra still has paltry d4s for her Strength and Dexterity, but her Constitution is a respectable d8, as is her Intelligence. She still has a bonus to Knowledge, which will be very helpful if you play her through Season of the Righteous, and her awesome d12 Charisma with +2 Divine bonus is still there in all its glory. However, this time Alahazra can shirk other Attack spells to use her own holy fire on enemies, getting a respectable 1d12 + 2d4+2 right off the bat by discarding the top card of her deck. This means you can feel free to load her deck up with Cure spells to get all those discarded cards back without worrying about whether you have the resources to fight.</p>
               <p>Oracle Deck Alahazra still has a power that involves examining cards, and in this case it lets her examine an extra card whenever she examines. This pairs incredibly nicely with the promo card that came with the Alahazra mini in <a href="/products/btpy99z3"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes Set 3</em></a>, allowing her to examine yet another extra card. Make sure to pick up an Augury spell!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-SeersHeaddress.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-SeersHeaddress_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>It may not be comfortable, but at least it's lighter than <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgcn">Shardra's</a>!</em>
               </div>
               <p>The last power listed on Alahazra's card uses a new term you might not have seen before: "invokes". The term will be familiar to those playtesting the upcoming Mummy's Mask Base Set, but this is the first time a card bearing the word is seeing the light of day. A check invokes a trait if it has or is against a card that has that trait, so if either your check or the card you're encountering has the trait, you're good. A bane invokes a trait if it has that trait or if it deals only damage of the type that matches that trait.</p>
               <p>As you can see, this "invokes" power applies to Alahazra's first power, letting her burn evil away with her holy fire and then move away afterward. Perhaps you examined the top three cards of your current location, saw a monster that you could easily destroy, but then found an important boon that Alahazra just doesn't have the correct skill to acquire? Just kill off that pesky monster and move away to another location to explore some more, leaving that sweet magic pistol for Lirianne to pick up on her turn instead.</p>
               <p>Before I leave you, let's examine one of Class Deck Alahazra's roles. This happens to be my favorite of her two new roles: the Wandering Prophet.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraWanderingProphet.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraWanderingProphet_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>When Alahazra shows up in your village, you should probably ask her about your future. It might just save your life.</em>
               </div>
               <p>Why do I like this role? Well, mostly because it brings back some of that seer-y goodness that I loved so much about her in <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>. First off, you don't always have to discard a card to use your holy fire anymore—if it's a spell or a blessing, you get to recharge it instead (and let's face it, most of her deck is going to be made up of spells and blessings). She also gets to move other characters when she invokes the Fire trait, which is useful. But it's those new powers at the bottom that I'm most excited about. First, you get to evade barriers, which are in all honesty a challenge for both incarnations of Alahazra. You can even let other characters evade barriers eventually.</p>
               <p>My favorite new power, though, is that examine power. You get to examine the top card of your location deck, at the end and eventually <em>also</em> the start of your turn, at no cost. Combine this with her earlier power (and her headdress!), and you're examining most of the deck in just a few turns. You can plan out every step of your turn before encountering a single card!</p>
               <p>Now I know you can agree that Alahazra is the best character ever. She doesn't need brute strength, fancy weapons, or armor. She knows what's coming before it arrives, and can prepare herself accordingly. She can look into the future and see the answer to a question before it is asked... and when necessary, she can rain down some serious divine wrath on an enemy or two. As much as I love <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li9y">Lini</a>, and as much as I'm looking forward to seeing <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lid6">Ramexes</a> in action, the best character ever released (so far) for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is, without question, Alahazra.</p>
