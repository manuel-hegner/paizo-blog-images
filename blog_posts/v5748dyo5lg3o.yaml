  description\">Bors stepped between Roshad and the warriors. \"This man is no thief,\
  \ Erzhan. I go with him of my own free will.\"</span></p> \n    <p>The captain—\
  Erzhan, presumably—chuckled without humor. \"This sorcerer has cast a spell on you,\
  \ my prince. Your father warned us of as much.\"</p> \n    <p>Bors glared. \"Do\
  \ I look enchanted to you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Running off with some street thief?\
  \ Abandoning your tribe?\" Erzhan snorted. Roshad got the feeling the man did that\
  \ a lot. \"But it doesn't matter what I think. Your father tasked us with bringing\
  \ you back, and that's what we're doing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not while I live!\" Roshad\
  \ stepped out from behind Bors's armored bulk. </p> \n    <p>Erzhan shrugged. \"\
  That was always an option.\" He turned to his archers.</p> \n    <p>Metal sang as\
  \ Bors's sword flew free from its sheath. In three steps he was across the intervening\
  \ distance, the long, straight blade hovering still and horizontal an inch from\
  \ Erzhan's throat. The captain blanched.</p> \n    <p>Bors's voice was the rumble\
  \ of a distant storm. \"You overreach yourself, Captain.\" He lifted his gaze to\
  \ the other warriors. \"If any of you touch this man behind me, you die. Either\
  \ here, by my blade, or dragged by your heels across the stones of the steppes until\
  \ your own mothers won't recognize you. I will not repeat myself.\"</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ was a tense pause, and then bows lowered and hands moved from hilts. Heads bowed.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Good.\" Bors looked down at the captain. \"And you, Erzhan?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Erzhan was sweating from more than just heat now, but he managed to\
  \ keep his voice from cracking. \"All respect, my prince, but you're not hakan yet.\
  \ Your father still holds the Horse Throne. And it's from his lips that this order\
  \ came. We must bring you back or die in the attempt.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know which\
  \ option I prefer,\" Roshad suggested.</p> \n    <p>Bors didn't answer, just stared\
  \ expressionlessly down at the soldier. At last he stepped back and sheathed his\
  \ sword. </p> \n    <p>\"Then you'll bring us back,\" he said. \"Both of us.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>They rode north from the Gate of\
  \ Winds, the red sandstone walls of Karazh's capital shrinking rapidly behind them.\
  \ Ahead, the steppe rolled off into eternity, the bunching hills like waves, giving\
  \ the Grass Sea its name. It was still early summer, and everywhere was a carpet\
  \ of green.</p> \n    <p>They road in silence, Bors and Roshad riding double on\
  \ a mare commandeered from one of the warriors. Beneath his veils, Roshad did his\
  \ best to match Bors's calm, to give nothing away to their captors, but inside his\
  \ emotions roiled. All he'd ever wanted was to ride away from the city with Bors's\
  \ arms locked tight around him, but not like this. Never like this.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ road curved around a low hill, and the camp came into view. Hundreds of tents\
  \ and round-walled gers spread back through the shallow valley, their white felt\
  \ walls gleaming. Long streams of colorful pennants flapped from every roof's apex\
  \ like helmet plumes. </p> \n    <p>Between them moved horses—whole herds of them,\
  \ of every color and description. Many were in use by the tribespeople, being groomed\
  \ or trained or used to haul goods, but still more wandered seemingly unattended.\
  \ Several came to investigate the new arrivals, and Roshad watched in fascination\
  \ as the soldiers nodded to the animals as if they were sentries.</p> \n    <p>No\
  \ one dismounted as they rode through the settlement. Several curious onlookers—\
  humans, this time—stopped what they were doing to watch the procession, and Roshad\
  \ felt their eyes on him. Bors's armor was similar enough to the soldiers' that\
  \ he likely wouldn't have attracted attention even if these hadn't been his people,\
  \ but Roshad's face-veil and wrappings were unmistakable. Even backwater nomads\
  \ knew about the Iridian Fold. He searched the watching eyes for judgment, but found\
  \ only that expressionless regard that so infuriated him on Bors.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ the center of the encampment, a small stone curtain wall six feet high marked\
  \ the edge of the smaller tents and the beginning of a large ring of open space,\
  \ bare save for the ubiquitous wandering horses. In its center stood a structure\
  \ that Roshad couldn't properly call a tent, or even a pavilion. Walls of stone\
  \ twenty feet high were capped by conical felt roofs, and smaller fabric outbuildings\
  \ clustered around its sides in an amorphous explosion of canvas. </p> \n    <p>Erzhan\
  \ must have caught his widened eyes, because he snickered. \"Like that, city man?\
  \ A gift from your Water Lords, who know how to pay proper respect to the horse\
  \ tribes.\" He dismounted.</p> \n    <p>Bors and Roshad followed suit. Several of\
  \ the soldiers looked like they might take hold of the prisoners, but Bors's glare\
  \ drove them back, and they settled for spreading out ahead of and behind them.\
  \ Erzhan took the lead, speaking to the two guards at the front door, who saluted\
  \ with fists to chests and stood aside.</p> \n    <p>Inside, Roshad couldn't help\
  \ but rubberneck. The hall they walked through might have been in any conventional\
  \ castle or fortress, yet while some arches led off to similar corridors, others\
  \ led into canvas tent-rooms, or simply out onto open grass, without so much as\
  \ an awning. </p> \n    <p>\"The Trade Palace is shared by all the horse tribes,\"\
  \ Bors murmured. \"The stone foundation came from the city, but your lords knew\
  \ better than to presume what the tribes desire, or to build to any single han's\
  \ specifications—even my father's. Whichever tribe resides here completes it as\
  \ it sees fit, then breaks it down when they move on.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad only\
  \ nodded. </p> \n    <p>The corridor ended in a set of bronze doors, each embossed\
  \ with a rearing stallion. Two more guards stood at attention there, but before\
  \ Erzhan could speak, they caught sight of Bors and swung the doors wide.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Roshad expected a great hall, tall and dourly majestic, or perhaps a cushioned\
  \ seraglio. Instead, he found himself in a tent—a stone-floored one, to be sure,\
  \ but still little more than a larger version of the gers they'd passed on the way\
  \ in. One wall was open, its canvas drawn back like curtains to reveal the sunlit\
  \ grass of a parade ground where several people were at work training horses.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A wooden throne stood on a raised platform against the far wall, its\
  \ arms and back carved into the shapes of horses. A man sat on that chair, facing\
  \ out at the training yard. As the warriors entered, he turned.</p> \n    <p>Roshad\
  \ froze, and might have taken a step back if not for Bors's hand on his arm. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The man on the chair was tall, his armor like Bors's but richer, the\
  \ lacquered scales a deep burgundy. Stylized horseheads adorned the steel bracers\
  \ on his forearms and the clasp that held the long fur mantle over his shoulders.\
  \ Twin axes lay crossed in his lap, yet none of these were what took Roshad aback.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The face he turned to them was steel, molded into the long moustaches\
  \ and beard of a patriarch. It extended from his conical helm down to his chin,\
  \ where it met the chain coif around his neck. It was polished mirror-bright, turning\
  \ the holes for his eyes into darkened pits.</p> \n    <p>A litchina. Gods above.\
  \ Bors had shown Roshad his own war mask once, the smooth lines modeled on his own\
  \ expressionless face. He carried it everywhere, but Roshad had never seen him wear\
  \ it, as a Horse King wearing his litchina meant one thing, and one thing only.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He was ready to kill.</p> \n    <p>Hakan Temir Kaskyrbai stood, taking\
  \ an axe in each hand. The steel-encased head nodded minutely, and the soldiers\
  \ who had surrounded Bors and Roshad stepped back.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  So,\" the hakan said. \"This is the man who would steal my kingdom.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Roshad groped frantically for a response, but Bors squeezed his arm warningly\
  \ and spoke instead. \"He steals nothing, Father.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Doesn't he?\"\
  \ One axe rose to point at them. \"I see a thief who would break my line, who would\
  \ see the greatest of the tribes fall to internal bickering, and let some lesser\
  \ han take the Horse Throne. And you, my only son,\" the axe head drew a line between\
  \ them, \"you chain yourself to him like a dog on a leash.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Watch\
  \ your words.\" Bors's tone was suddenly as hard as the hakan's, his face a mask\
  \ of its own. \"You are my lord and father, and I honor you with every breath, but\
  \ you will not insult me again, nor the man that I've chosen.\"</p> \n    <p>A laugh,\
  \ ringing behind steel. \"Or what? You'll draw your sword and strike me down, here\
  \ in the heart of the Trade Palace?\" The hakan laughed again, but this time it\
  \ sounded to Roshad like the mockery was turned inward. \"Split hooves, boy, isn't\
  \ that all I've ever asked?\"</p> \n    <p>The hakan seated himself once more on\
  \ the wooden throne. He waved one of the axes dismissively. \"Leave us. And send\
  \ in Ulzhan.\" Roshad started to turn, and the axe shot forward. \"Not you.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A moment later, the three of them were alone, save for the trainers continuing\
  \ unperturbed on the far grass. The metal face regarded Bors and Roshad silently\
  \ for a long moment, and Roshad suddenly understood at a visceral level why the\
  \ Horse Kings wore the litchinas. That blank, expressionless stare was more terrifying\
  \ than any grimace or battle cry.</p> \n    <p>\"The Iridian Fold,\" the hakan said\
  \ at last. </p> \n    <p>\"It's a noble calling,\" Bors said. \"You've said so yourself,\
  \ when Koshkin left to join them.\"</p> \n    <p>The hakan nodded. \"So it is. And\
  \ you think that matters?\"</p> \n    <p>The question caught Bors short. \"But—\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"How many great tribes are there, Bors?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thirteen.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And which is the greatest?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Kaskyrbai. The wolves\
  \ of the steppe.\"</p> \n    <p>The hakan nodded. \"You've known that all your life,\
  \ haven't you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And that's the problem.\"\
  \ The hakan took both axes and set them down on the arm of the throne. \"You're\
  \ young, Bors. You've been raised as heir to the greatest of the tribes, but you\
  \ didn't watch what your grandfather—my father—had to do to take the Horse Throne.\
  \ I grew up in the middle of it, the blood and shit that coated the steppes. The\
  \ hans of the other great tribe are as proud as us, boy. They cede us respect because\
  \ they have to. Because I've kept us strong. But if we show any weakness, they'll\
  \ slaughter us. And then they'll slaughter each other, until the last one to fall\
  \ from his saddle and land on this wooden chair can call himself hakan.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Someone pounded once on the bronze doors, and the hakan looked up. \"Enter.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The doors opened, and a woman stepped through. She was big—only a\
  \ few inches shorter than Bors himself—and wore armor of brown and gray, topped\
  \ by a fur-lined helm. A huge sheath on her back held a recurve bow, and a longsword\
  \ swung at her waist. She spared Bors and Roshad only the briefest of glances as\
  \ she stalked past and knelt at the foot of the platform. \"Hakan.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Rise, Ulzhan.\" The hakan gestured for her to ascend and take up a position next\
  \ to the throne, and now Roshad felt the frank appraisal in her gaze. He was momentarily\
  \ glad for his veil—he could never have matched the expressionlessness of these\
  \ damned nomads.</p> \n    <p>The hakan spoke. \"What's your name, city-man?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Roshad, lord.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Roshad what?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Just Roshad.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The steel face bobbed agreeably.</p> \n    <p>\"And are you perhaps\
  \ the son of a Water Lord, Roshad? Or maybe a prince of the East with a thousand\
  \ camels in your caravan? No, wait—you're the sixth reincarnation of Sogys Taramai,\
  \ here to lead us all off the steppe and into the Land of No Winters.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Roshad felt his face burn, and only Bors's grip on his arm and the knowledge\
  \ of a thousand horse warriors in the surrounding camp kept him from spreading his\
  \ fingers and letting the fire flow, torching the old man with the metal face and\
  \ the stupid, flammable throne.</p> \n    <p>Bors's voice was quiet. \"I love him,\
  \ Father. And he loves me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And I love you, boy.\" The hakan shook\
  \ his head. \"Which is why I'm giving you the chance to save his life.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"What?\" Roshad and Bors spoke in unison. Even as the shock coursed through\
  \ him, some small part of Roshad smiled to see how quickly he and his szerik were\
  \ growing together.</p> \n    <p>The hakan waved at the warrior next to him. \"\
  You've known Ulzhan since you were a child, Bors. Her father was the greatest captain\
  \ I ever had, and already she's nearly matched him—with the horses, with the bow,\
  \ and as a combat leader.\" </p> \n    <p>The woman inclined her head slightly at\
  \ the praise.</p> \n    <p>No wonder she's good with horses, Roshad thought, she's\
  \ got the face of one. But of course that was just his anger speaking. In truth,\
  \ the woman was unremarkable, save for her size and the way she stood like a crouching\
  \ lion, ready to pounce.</p> \n    <p>\"Tomorrow at dawn, you will slit palms and\
  \ marry Ulzhan, binding your blood with hers. Then you'll take up the Succession\
  \ Sword and strike me down. Together, with me to advise you, you and she will lead\
  \ our tribe to greatness.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And if I refuse?\"</p> \n    <p>The hakan\
  \ picked up one of his axes and pounded twice on the platform with its haft. Suddenly\
  \ the doors were open, and the room was full of dark-eyed steppe warriors.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Then your city-man dies, and you marry her anyway.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bors!\"\
  \ Roshad grabbed tight to the man's arm, but his szerik paid him no attention. The\
  \ bigger man's gaze was fixed on the hakan. </p> \n    <p>\"I was born to be hakan,\"\
  \ Bors said. \"And you would make me a slave.\"</p> \n    <p>\"All kings are slaves.\"\
  \ The hakan sighed, then reached up and pulled off his litchina. The man beneath\
  \ it was surprisingly young—no more than twenty years older than Bors, with plenty\
  \ of black still in his long mustaches. He had the face of a hard man, yet the gaze\
  \ that met Bors's was strangely soft.</p> \n    <p>\"We both knew this was coming,\
  \ Bors. I'm glad you found love, and I let you play as long as I could. But it's\
  \ time to grow up.\"</p> \n    <p>Bors said nothing. The silence carried. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Roshad ran frantically through escape scenarios. Fire, that was good—fire\
  \ scared people, called out to the animal instincts in them. He'd flame the old\
  \ bastard—or better yet, the tent canopy above them, set the whole palace on fire.\
  \ While the soldiers scrambled to put it out, he and Bors would race out the open\
  \ side-wall, leap onto the horses that were being trained, then gallop through the\
  \ camp and back to the city before anyone could stop them. Once there, they could\
  \ hole up until a suitably large caravan was leaving the city, then—</p> \n    <p>Bors\
  \ reached up to his chest and disconnected the chain, handing the end back to Roshad.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Roshad did his best not to grin beneath his veil. He and Bors only removed\
  \ their chain when they were about to pull a particularly tricky stunt. He readied\
  \ the spell.</p> \n    <p>\"It's over, Roshad.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad looked up at\
  \ Bors. The man wasn't reaching for his sword. He wasn't tensing to move. Just looking\
  \ down at him, mouth drawn tight. \"What?\"</p> \n    <p>\"He's right. This time\
  \ that we've had... I would have loved to be your szerik. But I have to do this.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Right. Of course.\" Roshad searched Bors's face, looking for something—\
  anything. This had to be a diversion, to catch the soldiers off guard. Later, Bors\
  \ would kiss his brow and apologize for having said such a thing, even as a front.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But Bors was shaking his head. \"No tricks, Roshad. Not this time. The\
  \ city is your world, and I love you for showing it to me. But this is mine.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gods, could he actually mean it? Roshad's stomach lurched. \"I won't\
  \ leave you.\" Smoke began to rise from his clenched fists. \"I'm not scared of\
  \ them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"This isn't about fear.\" Bors's face was the same mask\
  \ as the others, but now his eyes, always so full of emotion and expression for\
  \ Roshad, held something indecipherable. \"If you ever loved me, you won't make\
  \ anyone hurt you.\" He took Roshad's head in his hands, and leaned down, pulling\
  \ their foreheads together. </p> \n    <p>\"Go now, Rabbit. Please. For me.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Then he let go and stepped backward, becoming one with the mass of soldiers.\
  \ A sea of blank faces stared back at Roshad.</p> \n    <p>\"If he's still here\
  \ in three breaths,\" the hakan said to his soldiers, \"shoot him.\"</p> \n    <p>Then\
  \ tears blurred the scene, and Roshad turned and fled.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
