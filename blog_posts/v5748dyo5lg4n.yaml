  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by James L. Sutter</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: The Succession\
  \ Sword</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <!-- -- Insert some text here ---->\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Roshad stood speechless, unable to parse\
  \ the words, and even less able to handle the melancholy smile.</span></p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"You're not wearing your veil,\" Bors noted.</p> \n    <p>The wound Roshad\
  \ had been salving with action tore open anew. He wanted to slap Bors, to scream\
  \ at him, to fall into the big man's arms and be comforted.</p> \n    <p><i>Stick\
  \ to the plan</i>. Roshad reached back into the satchel on his back and pulled out\
  \ the chain.</p> \n    <p>\"Remember this?\" He held it out, letting its links hang\
  \ down. \"This is the promise we made, Bors. Shared mind, shared heart. Always.\"\
  \ He dropped the chain between them, letting it clatter to the floor. \"Have you\
  \ forgotten that?\"</p> \n    <p>Bors was no longer smiling. \"They were going to\
  \ kill you, Roshad.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So you did it for them?\" Roshad felt the heat\
  \ building in his face, the tears starting their slow treks down his cheeks. \"\
  Because that's what this is, Bors. If you cut a man in half, both halves die. Together,\
  \ we're szerik. Apart, we're nothing. Did you think I would let you kill us both?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"No.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, too bad, you bastard, because I'm not—\
  \" Roshad paused. \"What did you say?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, I never thought you would\
  \ stay away. That was the point.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad grimaced. \"But when you\
  \ said it was over—I saw it in your eyes. You meant it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of <i>course</i>\
  \ I meant it! Anything less would have gotten you killed. If I wanted my father\
  \ to believe it, I needed you to believe it, too. <i>I</i> had to believe it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Then how did you know I'd come back?\"</p> \n    <p>Bors smiled,\
  \ and now there was nothing sad in it. \"Because I know you, Roshad. You're as stubborn\
  \ as a half-trained camel. You'd never be able to let me go—not without at least\
  \ getting the last word.\"</p> \n    <p>Then he opened his arms, and Roshad was\
  \ in them, face pressed against the warm lacquered scales guarding the big man's\
  \ chest. \"I thought...\" he whispered, and then his voice caught. \"So why did\
  \ you look so gods-damned <i>sad</i> when you saw me at the window?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Bors's stubbled cheek pressed down against the top of Roshad's head. \"Because\
  \ I had to hurt you, Rabbit. That should never be easy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Damn straight.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>They stood together then for a long moment, neither saying anything.\
  \ At last Bors unwrapped his arms and pushed Roshad away. He reached for his true\
  \ sword. \"Come on. It'll be dawn soon.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad felt hope bloom inside\
  \ his chest. \"We're leaving?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course we're leaving. Isn't that\
  \ what I said? Now that my father's convinced I've given up, we can make our escape.\
  \ You have your climbing spell?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Already cast.\"</p> \n    <p>Bors\
  \ grinned. \"That'll make it easier.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But not easy enough.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Both men spun at the voice. Ulzhan stood in the room's doorway, bow drawn\
  \ and arrow nocked. She wore her armor as well, along with a blue sash to complement\
  \ Bors's red. With her heel, she kicked the door closed. \"I thought this might\
  \ happen, so I had a servant listen at your door.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Ulzhan does what's best for the tribe. Always.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Roshad started to raise his hands, ready to burn the woman\
  \ to cinders, but Bors slapped them down. \"No!\"</p> \n    <p>\"He's right,\" Ulzhan\
  \ said. \"We have many things to discuss, but if you try to cast a spell, I'll shut\
  \ your mouth with an arrow and render this conversation moot.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad\
  \ let his hands drop. \"What conversation?\"</p> \n    <p>Seemingly satisfied that\
  \ Roshad was pacified, Ulzhan dismissed him, turning her attention to Bors. \"My\
  \ prince, I'm going to go ahead and assume you're less than thrilled about our marriage.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Bors's face was back to its normal, stone-hewn blankness. \"It's nothing\
  \ personal.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I believe you. Maybe if you were differently inclined,\
  \ I'd be offended, but no matter. The point is, I'm not your father. I can see your\
  \ love and respect it. But this marriage has to happen, for the good of the tribe.\
  \ So I'll make you this offer: marry me, and I'll turn a blind eye to your man.\"\
  \ Her head tilted to indicate Roshad. \"The tribe can never know—I won't let you\
  \ undermine our authority or give other tribes a lever to use against us—but you\
  \ can arrange whatever rendezvous you desire. You don't need to take my bed except\
  \ to give us an heir.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How generous,\" Roshad spat, but Bors touched\
  \ his arm. The prince nodded his head to Ulzhan, almost a bow.</p> \n    <p>\"You\
  \ honor me, Ulzhan. Under other circumstances, I would have been honored to stand\
  \ at your side. But I can't lead the tribe.\"</p> \n    <p>Ulzhan's gaze hardened.\
  \ \"I thought better of you, Bors. You're the heir. There's no alternative.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Actually, I think there is.\" Bors gestured to the dagger in Roshad's\
  \ belt. \"May I?\"</p> \n    <p>Ulzhan drew the fletching back to her cheek, the\
  \ arrow's steel point in line with Roshad's eye. \"No tricks.\" But the arrow bobbed\
  \ a gesture for him to continue.</p> \n    <p>Bors reached down and drew the dagger.\
  \ In one smooth move, he slit his palm, then held it out to Ulzhan.</p> \n    <p>Roshad\
  \ gaped. \"What are you doing?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What does it look like I'm doing?\"\
  \ Bors held the dagger out to Ulzhan, hilt-first. \"I'm marrying her.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Ulzhan stared at him, and then a smile spread across her face. Roshad wouldn't\
  \ have said it transformed her features, but as with Bors, a face that rarely smiled\
  \ was all the brighter when it did. She lowered the bow. \"I see.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I don't!\" Roshad moved between them. \"After all this, you're going to marry her\
  \ now, an hour before the damned wedding?\"</p> \n    <p>\"She's right, Roshad.\
  \ Only the hakan's blood can challenge him for the throne. But as soon as I marry\
  \ Ulzhan, my blood becomes hers. She can challenge him. And from what I've heard,\
  \ she'd lead the tribe better than I would.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A wise assessment,\
  \ my prince.\" Ulzhan let the bowstring go slack, and with a final mistrustful glance\
  \ at Roshad set it down against the wall. She took the proffered dagger and slit\
  \ her own palm, then reached forward to clasp Bors's hand.</p> \n    <p>\"Gods,\"\
  \ Roshad whispered. \"I can't believe you're marrying her.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's\
  \ a marriage, Rabbit?\" Bors squeezed Ulzhan's hand, then pulled it back and showed\
  \ Roshad the wound in his palm. \"In the lands beyond the sea, this is just another\
  \ scar.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The lands beyond the sea...\" Roshad grinned. \"I guess\
  \ you're right.\"</p> \n    <p>Bors reached up and tugged loose the yellow armband,\
  \ then carefully wiped both his blood and Ulzhan's on it. She let him tie it around\
  \ her wrist, the embroidered horse showing through the orange-red stain.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"It's done, then.\" Roshad said.</p> \n    <p>\"Not quite.\" Bors reached\
  \ down and drew the wooden sword from his sash. He held it out on flat palms, offering\
  \ it to Ulzhan. \"The Succession Sword. Lead the tribe well for me, Ulzhan.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ulzhan stared unbelieving at the sword, then slowly took it, holding\
  \ it upright before her face. \"No,\" she said. \"Not for you. The Horse Throne\
  \ won't survive an absentee hakan. Once I challenge your father, I'll rule in my\
  \ own name.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\" Bors smiled. \"You're the son he always\
  \ wanted. Once he gets over the shock, I hope he sees the gift I've given him. And\
  \ the tribe.\"</p> \n    <p>Ulzhan's eyes gleamed. She lowered the sword. \"You're\
  \ a strange man, Bors Kaskyrbai. But you would have made a fine husband.\" Swiftly,\
  \ she stepped forward and kissed him on the lips, then pulled back a few inches\
  \ to meet his gaze. \"Don't come back.\"</p> \n    <p>Bors laughed. \"Don't worry.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>And then Ulzhan was through the door and gone.</p> \n    <p>Bors turned\
  \ to Roshad. \"Shall we?\"</p> \n    <p>A laugh exploded from Roshad. \"I can't\
  \ believe you're married!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I believe I already was.\" Bors stooped\
  \ and picked up the chain, then held it out to Roshad. \"Are we leaving or not?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Oh, we're leaving all right.\" Roshad shoved the chain into his\
  \ satchel, then turned around and braced his hands on his legs. \"Your steed, my\
  \ prince.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not prince.\" Bors secured his helm and sword and settled\
  \ his bulk piggyback on Roshad. \"Not anymore.\"</p> \n    <p>Then they were out\
  \ the window, moving quickly down the stone wall. At the ground, they broke apart\
  \ and moved swiftly over to the curtain wall, keeping the palace between them and\
  \ the wedding pavilion. Figuring the time for subterfuge was past, Roshad grabbed\
  \ the top and levered himself up and over, Bors just behind him.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  My horse is hidden on the south side of the camp,\" he said.</p> \n    <p>\"And\
  \ are you sentimentally attached to her?\" Bors asked.</p> \n    <p>\"What? No,\
  \ why—\"</p> \n    <p>But Bors was already whistling. In response, a herd of a dozen\
  \ horses appeared from behind a screen of tents, the stallion at its head leading\
  \ them right up to Bors. He scratched the beast's nose.</p> \n    <p>\"That's amazing,\"\
  \ Roshad said.</p> \n    <p>\"What did you think it meant to be a horse prince?\"\
  \ Bors pulled himself up onto the stallion's back. He held out a hand for Roshad,\
  \ and the sorcerer let himself be pulled up, seating himself in front. Bors dug\
  \ in his heels, and they began to ride quickly through the tents. In moments, they\
  \ were through the last of them and out onto the open steppe. Behind them, the sun\
  \ rose above the hills in earnest, casting their shadow long in front of them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We'll never outrun them riding double,\" Roshad noted.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  We won't have to,\" Bors said. \"I don't think they'll be coming after us again.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You think your father will allow it?\"</p> \n    <p>Bors laughed.\
  \ \"Honestly, it's a better arrangement than he could have hoped. But even he can't\
  \ step away from a challenge. Ulzhan has the Succession Sword, and by the time he\
  \ realizes I'm gone, she'll have issued the challenge. If she's half as good as\
  \ everyone says, she'll take him apart. By the time he can see straight again, she'll\
  \ be firmly on the Horse Throne, and we'll be over the horizon.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad\
  \ leaned back against Bors's chest. \"And then?\"</p> \n    <p>Bors wrapped one\
  \ armored arm around him, holding him close.</p> \n    <p>\"And then we'll see what\
  \ there is to see.\" </p>\n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want more Bors and Roshad?</b></p>\
