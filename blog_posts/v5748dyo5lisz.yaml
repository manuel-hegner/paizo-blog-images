  > \n     <p>While writing last Moonday's blog, I realized there was way too much\
  \ information I wanted to share and including it all would lead to reader overload.\
  \ So I saved some of the Gen Con information for this week. It's also time to start\
  \ the next Pathfinder Society Competition!</p> \n     <h2>More Gen Con Info</h2>\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">There is no way to do everything at Gen Con\
  \ by myself; there are just too many tasks and too many places to be. So every year\
  \ a team of Lead Volunteers is named to help out. While I coordinate things between\
  \ Gen Con and PFS, they do the same for all the volunteers. Months before the convention\
  \ starts, just weeks after Gen Con 2015 ended, they started talking about Gen Con\
  \ 2016. Through months of planning, generating schedules, corresponding with volunteers,\
  \ compiling lists of supplies, they work closely with me to deliver a quality show.\
  \ They arrive at Gen Con early and help me set up the Sagamore. Setup is a HUGE\
  \ endeavor, involving unpacking pallets, building shelving, assembling table stands,\
  \ folding papers, stuffing envelopes, sorting shirts... an almost endless list of\
  \ tasks that all need to occur before Wednesday afternoon when our volunteers arrive.\
  \ After four days of very little sleep, they help tear down the Sagamore, disassembling\
  \ everything we built days before, packing up the pallets, rolling banners, and\
  \ compiling a list of GM feedback. Only when everything is torn down and ready to\
  \ return to Seattle do they take a breather and stop thinking Gen Con 2016. Then,\
  \ a few weeks later, they review the feedback, read through the many post-Gen Con\
  \ forum threads, and start thinking about Gen Con 50. The amount of time these volunteers\
  \ spend putting the show together is immense and I cannot say thank you enough to\
  \ them for all they do!</p> \n     <p>Without further ado—your leads!</p> \n   \
  \  <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Jon Cary</b>—Jon started volunteering for Paizo at\
  \ Gen Con in 2011. The next year, he was appointed Lead. This is Jon's sixth Gen\
  \ Con with the Pathfinder Society. In addition, he was the Venture-Captain of the\
  \ Dallas-Fort Worth area from September 2011 to December 2014. Jon is our tech guru,\
  \ the master of the database, and wrangler of the HQ volunteers. Most importantly,\
  \ he keeps an eye on Bob and Todd and preserves the OPC's sanity.</p> \n      <p><b>Bob\
  \ Jonquet</b>—GM herder extraordinaire, 2016 marks Bob's third year as Gen Con Co-Lead.\
  \ He joined the Pathfinder Society at the outset and was a Tier 1 Gen Con GM in\
  \ 2010, the first of many years of volunteering for Society events. Bob also leads\
  \ the volunteer brigade at PaizoCon. When asked for a blurb, Bob wrote, \"In his\
  \ spare time Bob likes long walks on the beach, eating ice cream, and protecting\
  \ the citizens of Gotham from evil\".</p> \n      <p><b>Todd Morgan</b>—The quite\
  \ one, Todd shoulders the daunting task of organizing the data entry crew and is\
  \ keeper of the reporting sheets. At 180 tables a slot and 10 slots, that is over\
  \ 1800 pieces of paper to track. As a result of being holder of the paper, Todd\
  \ shoulders the responsibility of fixing any reporting errors. This is Todd's third\
  \ year of leading Gen Con volunteers. Todd is also one of two co-leads for PaizoCon.\
  \ In his spare time, he plays in a band.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>New\
  \ for this year, we are adding Department Heads to the Gen Con leadership. They\
  \ are responsible for coordinating tasks within their areas, getting volunteers\
  \ breaks, handling on-site issues, and making sure players have a fantastic experience.</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>GMs</b>—Venture-Captain Bobby Harring<br> <b>Marshals</b>—\
  Venture-Captain Seth Brummond<br> <b>Non-Marshal HQ Volunteers</b>—Venture-Captain\
  \ Walter Sheppard<br> <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Demonstrators</b>—Venture-Captain\
  \ Dominick Trascritti<br> <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</b>—Venture-Captain\
  \ Micah Daniels<br> <b>Pathfinder Society Academy</b>—Venture-Captain Lucas Servideo</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>At this time, every volunteer should have received\
  \ their schedule and replied to their appropriate Lead—Bob for GMs and Jon for HQ.\
  \ Badges have been placed in Gen Con accounts. If you don't see a badge under your\
  \ \"my packet\" category on the Gen Con website, please email me and I will look\
  \ into the issue. I will start looking at room assignments After PaizoCon and will\
  \ send another email with roommate information to those that qualified for a Paizo\
  \ room.</p> \n     <p>As a result of planning months out, there are always cancellations.\
  \ We are still taking applications for volunteers as a \"wait list\" to fill the\
  \ inevitable holes in our schedule. Check out the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2\"\
  >Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers blog</a> if you are interested in being on the\
  \ wait list.</p> \n     <p>Finally, a GIGANTIC thank you to all the volunteers!\
  \ Without you, the Pathfinder Society would not have the capacity to offer all the\
  \ wonderful games and experiences to the attendees of Gen Con. Raise your glass\
  \ high and toast your efforts! Huzzah!</p> \n     <h2>Character Sketch Competition</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Switching gears—it's time for another competition. For this one, break\
  \ out your crayons, pencils, pens, paints, pastels, inks, or markers and a clean\
  \ sheet of paper. The theme of this competition is <b>Character Portrait</b>. We\
  \ are looking for either headshot or full body pieces of your Pathfinder Society\
  \ characters.</p> \n     <p>As with past competitions, there are a few rules:</p>\
