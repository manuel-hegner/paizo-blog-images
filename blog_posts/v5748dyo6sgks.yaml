  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">For Pathfinder Society, we announce the yearly\
  \ themes and logos at the PaizoCon preview banquet. This works well for Gen Con\
  \ releases, but not so well for events in June and July. In deciding to launch new\
  \ year storylines at Origins, we needed to move up our timeline for announcements.\
  \ If you want to join me, lead developer John Compton, and developer Thurston Hillman\
  \ at Origins for the premiere of Starfinder Season Year 2, you can find the Origins\
  \ catalog of events on the <a href=\"http://originsgamefair.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  \ name=\"Origins website\">Origins website</a>.</p> \n    <p>The year numbering\
  \ is a bit of a misnomer, as we’ve had the Starfinder Society for 20-ish months\
  \ at this point, but this is the first major storyline pivot; hence, the Year 2\
  \ title. As the primary developer for Starfinder Society, Thurston Hillman is the\
  \ best team member to provide a sneak peek into what’s coming. Without further ado,\
  \ here is your glimpse into what the team has in store for you:</p> \n    <p><em>Today,\
  \ the Organized Play team is proud to reveal the name and symbol for our upcoming\
  \ season of Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild content. If you’ve been following\
  \ Starfinder Society, you’ll know that we’re coming into the home stretch of our\
  \ Year of Scoured Stars* and that there are only a few months of scenarios left\
  \ before our Origins debut for Starfinder Society Year 2. With that in mind, it\
  \ seemed like a good idea to provide some information on what Starfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild participants can look forward to starting in June of 2019.</em></p>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Let me be the first to welcome all our players and GMs into the upcoming\
  \ “Year of a Thousand Bites.\"</em></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190410-SFS-Yr2symbol.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190410-SFS-Yr2symbol_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><em>There’s a lot to parse and make guesses from in that\
  \ name, but let me give you a bit of a preview of what this name and season represent.\
  \ Taking a quick step back to the ongoing Year of Scoured Stars, the Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild has focused a lot on a fairly sweeping “science fantasy\
  \ space opera” storyline. Over the past two years of play, we’ve seen the Starfinder\
  \ Society rebound from a nasty event in the Scoured Stars, come face to face with\
  \ a new alien menace, and made inroads with new civilizations across the galaxy.\
  \ This all culminates in our second interactive special, <strong>Starfinder Society\
  \ #2–00: Fate of the Scoured God</strong>, a Tier 1–12 special debuting at Origins\
  \ that bridges the gap (not that Gap) between Year 1 and Year 2. With all that in\
  \ mind, our new season of play takes us back to somewhere we’ve been away from for\
  \ too long: the Pact Worlds.</em></p> \n    <p><em>The Year of a Thousand Bites\
  \ brings us back to the Pact Worlds and re-focuses the campaign on two major concepts:\
  \ what it means to be a Starfinder and the living aspect of our campaign. Being\
  \ a Starfinder can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people,\
  \ and we’re going to get some insight into what people outside the Society think\
  \ of Starfinders this season. We’re also going to get a chance to revisit some choices\
  \ that players have made over the past twenty months of play and see how those choices\
  \ have worked out.</em></p> \n    <p><em>Since taking on the role of Starfinder\
  \ Society developer, I’ve pushed for a campaign that lets the players decide where\
  \ our story goes. It’s taken some time for us to spin up this process, but I want\
  \ to re-emphasize a promise that the Starfinder Society is a representative organization\
  \ directly influenced by the player base. I suppose now would also be a good time\
  \ to remind all our Second Seekers faction members out there to look at getting\
  \ that Rising Star capstone boon and emailing us your character description—it’\
  s going to be very important. In fact, for all you Second Seekers out there, you’\
  ll probably want to look at getting that to us no later than 11:59 PST on April\
  \ 30th**.</em></p> \n    <p><em>As for what else is in store for this year’s story…\
  \ well, how about we take a brief look at our first Year of a Thousand Bites releases!\
  \ (Expect product pages soon)</em></p> \n    <p><em><strong>Starfinder Society #2–\
  01: Pact World Warriors</strong> brings back the ever-lovable undead media mogul,\
  \ Zo!, who wants a group of skilled Starfinders to participate in a series of televised\
  \ events. Since the Society needs to improve its reputation in the Pact Worlds (hmmmm…\
  \ wonder why they need to do that?) it’s up to the PCs to step in and participate\
  \ in these—absolutely not deadly and ridiculous—events.</em></p> \n    <p><em><strong>Starfinder\
  \ Society #2–02: Waking the Past</strong> takes us out beyond the Pact Worlds to\
  \ investigate a recently unearthed complex on an AbadarCorp-sponsored frontier colony\
  \ world. I’m sure nothing could go wrong with Starfinders investigating an unearthed\
  \ set of ruins.</em></p> \n    <p><em>We’ll have a lot more information on the Year\
  \ of a Thousand Bites to reveal in the coming months, with a dedicated Q/A session\
  \ at PaizoCon 2019 for all those of you in attendance. I’m really looking forward\
  \ to showing some of the stories we have planned for this upcoming year of Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild play and am equally excited to hear from all the players\
  \ who get a chance to participate in (and directly impact) where our shared campaign\
  \ goes in the future!***</em></p> \n    <p>Footnotes:<br> </p>\n    <blockquote>\
  \ <em>*Ok, it's been a bit more than just a single year.<br> **Don't fret if you\
  \ can't get us those capstone write-ups by this date. There will be more opportunities\
  \ later on for those who complete this!<br> ***Bad sci-fi/futuristic pun. I apologize.</em>\n\
  \    </blockquote>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Until next week, when we preview the April\
  \ scenarios, I ask you all to Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Wolridge<br>\
