  \ \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the earliest steps I took in designing\
  \ the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbi?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Summoner-Class-Deck\"\
  >Summoner Class Deck</a> was to look at <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?Class=Summoner\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Summoner archetypes</a> to complement the iconic Balazar and\
  \ his death-chicken Padrig. Alase would become our God Caller and Zetha our Shadow\
  \ Caller. But there was one character I worked on that we pretty quickly had to\
  \ drop.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b9bf50d4-11bc-4dd1-9379-06fdfb21b29b/081920_BloodGodDisciple.png\"\

  \     <p>Blood God Disciples are half-orc summoners who believe their eidolon is\
  \ an avatar of one of the orc blood gods. So, we created Thargrap the summoner and\
  \ his nightmare-wolf eidolon that he totally thinks is an avatar of Nulgreth, the\
  \ orc deity of bloodlust and fighting. Unfortunately, when coming up with the list\
  \ of boons to fill out the deck, I realized that we had three summoners who didn’\
  t care about weapons and one that did. We also knew we needed three summoners, not\
  \ four. So… swiftly away he went, forgotten into the annals of our playtest forums.\
  \ Until today.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7fbc0933-725a-4760-82a8-24ced3e58c24/082020_Thargrap1.jpg\"\

  >Sometimes it’s not clear who’s in charge. Not so when you think your eidolon is\
  \ a god.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Now, this is not how Thargrap looked way back\
  \ then. We’ve learned a few things in the last four or five years, so we’ve updated\
  \ him to fit the game design philosophy we’ve embraced in the <em>Core Set</em>\
  \ and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>. He’s a lot more “local friendly” than\
  \ he used to be. We’re also experimenting with adding cohort feats, in the same\
  \ way that we have supporter feats. </p> \n      <p>Like all summoners, Thargrap\
  \ has a higher skill ceiling than many characters; he’s not really a first-pick\
  \ for the faint of heart. I had to make sure he was tested by one of our most rash\
  \ and reckless testers to verify how well his engine—which sends all of his cards\
  \ inexorably toward banishment in exchange for more card draws and explorations—\
  works. (Those of you who know our testers and venture-officers might well have a\
  \ good guess to whom I refer.) So, let me ask our Venture-Captain for Online PACS,\
  \ Tyler “Cartmanbeck” Beck: Hey Tyler, what do you think of Thargrap?</p> \n   \
  \   <blockquote> \n       <p>I have been playtesting Thargrap every chance I’ve\
  \ gotten to do so for a few months now, and at no time have I stopped loving this\
  \ character. In fact, I’ve started calling Thargrap my favorite character ever (once\
  \ again proving that I lied to you in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lijp?Cartmanbecks-Best-Character-Ever-Alahazra\"\
  >this blog</a>... <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljbw?That-One-Time-I-Lied-About-My-Best-Character\"\
  >and this one</a>...). </p> \n       <p>I remember Thargrap from the long-ago playtesting\
  \ of the Summoner Class Deck, and even then, I was very excited about a Blood God\
  \ Summoner character, and very disappointed when he was cut from the deck. He has\
  \ mutated a bit since that initial playtest, but only for the better!</p> \n   \
  \    <p>Thargrap is probably the character that best fits my PACG playstyle, which\
  \ is generally “explore as much as possible, get really close to dying, then beg\
  \ for healing from someone else in the party.” Thargrap achieves this through a\
  \ combination of several different powers, despite having a very small starting\
  \ hand size. </p> \n       <p>Thargrap’s cohort, Nulgreth, has the ability to “\
  eat” (banish) a card from Thargrap’s buried pile to boost his attack, or to allow\
  \ him to draw a card. Since Thargrap can bury monsters defeated locally by any character,\
  \ he can quickly fill his buried pile with monsters during other players’ turns,\
  \ and then on his own turn he can banish as many as he needs to in order to draw\
  \ a huge hand and have a massive turn full of explores, all while simultaneously\
  \ allowing you to cull unnecessary cards from your deck, which I know will appeal\
  \ to many players! When you combine this with Thargrap’s strong Melee skill and\
  \ his ability to also pick up Arcane spells, he’s a beast that can rip through locations\
  \ like no other.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ pretty different cards than the other summoners. Infernal Healing is solid for\
  \ culling your discards into your bury pile while healing back your more important\
  \ cards. The Curse ally Priest of Asmodeus is fantastically themed and fun for Thargrap.\
  \ Rovagug’s Destruction is great for a character who can turn most monster encounters\

  \ others<br> <b>Item</b>: Token of Remembrance<br> <b>Ally</b>: Soldier, 1 other<br>\
  \ <b>Blessing</b>: Prayer, 4 others</p> \n      <p>If you’re also using <em>Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</em>, consider:<br> <b>Weapon</b>: Scythe<br> <b>Spell</b>:\
  \ False Life, Infernal Healing<br> <b>Armor</b>: Armored Coat<br> <b>Ally</b>: Pig</p>\
  \ \n      <p>If you’re also using the <em>Summoner Class Deck</em>, consider:<br>\
  \ <b>Weapon</b>: Quarterstaff of Vaulting<br> <b>Spell</b>: Black Spot, Eloquence,\
  \ Evolution Surge<br> <b>Ally</b>: Blackwing Librarian<br> <b>Blessing</b>: Blessing\
  \ of Pharasma</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/20335166-3a3e-4c4c-b8c5-1d741815c983/082020_Bloodgifter.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Role card Lord of the Blood Feast\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size:\
  \ 13px;\">You have to have blood, but do you eat it yourself or re-gift it?</p>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>When Thargrap gains his role, you have a choice to make:\
  \ share the gifts of the Blood God, or share the <em>results</em> of the gifts of\
  \ the Blood God. Either way, Nulgreth demands blood! As a Bloodgifter, Thargrap\
  \ learns to share the power of “his” eidolon with other nearby characters, allowing\
  \ them to move, removing scourges, and even imbuing them with your skills. This\
  \ is the party-friendly choice, based on the Bloody Gift power of the Pathfinder\
  \ 1E Blood God Disciple archetype, and while it won’t help Thargrap stand out less\
  \ at a gala or dinner party, it might help his fellows get invited in the first\
  \ place.</p> \n      <p>On the other (bloody) hand, you can choose the Lord of the\
  \ Blood Feast role, strengthening your ties to the practices and powers of the Blood\
  \ God, even to the point of reflecting some of Nulgreth’s when your cohort isn’\
  t necessarily present. The Lord of the Blood Feast can be more self-sufficient,\
  \ but he definitely enjoys the company of others, especially when they assist you\
  \ in your devotions.</p> \n      <p>Thargrap would make a great character for the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Society’s new season 7, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pacg/pacs/year7\"\
  >Year of Reborn Strife</a>. You’ll find yourself in the city of Kaer Maga, arguably\
  \ the most accepting and least racist city in Golarion. In the City of Strangers,\
  \ Thargrap’s orcish heritage and habit of eating his foes barely stands out, as\
  \ long as he doesn’t do it to the city residents (too much). </p> \n      <p>On\
  \ the other (still bloody) hand, Thargrap is oddly not a great fit for the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbi?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Summoner-Class-Deck\"\
  >Summoner Class Deck</a>. As mentioned above, he cares about weapons in a way that\
  \ none of the characters from that deck do, and he likes several boons that they,\
  \ generally speaking, do not. Since this character is relatively untested, we’d\
  \ like you to try him out and provide your feedback. For play at home, test him\
  \ with whatever Adventure Path, Class Decks, or <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3k?Introducing-Adventurer-s-Packs\"\
  >Adventurer’s Packs</a> you like, and let us know what works (both well and poorly).</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For Organized Play, you may use the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9qy9\"\
  >Magus</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k5m\">Goblins Burn!</a>, or\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjy\">Hell’s Vengeance 2</a> Class Decks\
  \ as your class deck. We suggest adding the Arcane and Smash Adventurer’s Packs.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Thanks to everyone who has already tested out Thargrap and Nulgreth,\
  \ and to all of you who try them out now. I hope to have other characters to present\
  \ in future blogs. It turns out that we’ve cut several characters over the years;\
  \ I’m sure some of those lost characters might also be interesting.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
