  >I've been threatening to reveal a few more \"good guys\" from January's <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted figures, and now that I'm sitting here in the\
  \ Minneapolis airport about to fly back to Seattle from my holiday vacation, it\
  \ appears that there are somewhat fewer heroes in this set than my memory had earlier\
  \ suggested. As in, there's only two more.</span></p> \n    <p>Since we're within\
  \ about three weeks of the set's release and I don't have a ton of preview blogs\
  \ left to go before you have your own figures in hand, that means that a touch of\
  \ evil will be creeping into a blog that I'd originally intended to focus on good\
  \ guys.</p> \n    <p>In the spirit of the set, I trust you'll forgive the unexpected\
  \ onset of darkness.</p> \n    <p>So, let's start with the goodies, shall we?</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_QueenGalfrey_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_QueenGalfrey_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the crusader Queen Galfrey, leader of\
  \ the goodly kingdom of Mendev on the edge of the Worldwound. Galfrey plays an important\
  \ role as the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of\
  \ the Righteous</a> campaign progresses, giving your player characters and opportunity\
  \ to rub shoulders with a national leader. Of course, in full plate mail armor and\
  \ with a longsword held aloft, this figure also doubles as any female warrior player\
  \ character or NPC. Queen Galfrey is a Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Arueshalae_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Arueshalae_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Arueshalae here is a redeemed succubus who fights\
  \ for the side of good against her former demonic brethren. Based on a cover illustration\
  \ by superstar Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds, this figure is a masterpiece of\
  \ sculpting that pushes the envelope for what's possible with a Medium figure. We've\
  \ got wings. We've got a (sweet-looking) bow. We've got great three-dimensionality.\
  \ All in all, one of the loveliest figures in the set for one of the most interesting\
  \ NPCs in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of\
  \ the Righteous Adventure Path</a>. Arueshalae is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And that's it for the good guys in this set. I sincerely hope your player\
  \ characters are up to the challenge of fighting off all these nasty demons and\
  \ hideous monsters! Speaking of which….</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Brimorak_500.jpeg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Brimorak_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>We're not done with demons yet, and this wily little fellow\
  \ is at the vanguard of their insidious armies. Here we have the Brimorak, a rank-and-file\
  \ demon your players will grow to loathe as the campaign progresses. Drawn from\
  \ the cover of <a href=\"/products/btpy90q9\">the very first Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ adventure</a> with stats in <a href=\"/products/btpy8hij\">Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: Book of the Damned Vol. 2: Lords of Chaos</a>, the Brimorak is cast in\
  \ clear plastic with fiery hoofs and a flaming sword. This Small figure is slated\
  \ at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_VescavorQueen_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_VescavorQueen_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This enormous, mottled pile of disgusting\
  \ grossness is the Vescavor Queen, an evil sort of giant insect you definitely do\
  \ NOT want to meet on the battlefield. The Vescavor Queen is on the very Large side\
  \ of Large, and is definitely one of the more disturbing figures we've produced\
  \ to date. Naturally, I love her. She's an uncommon, so I suggest your PCs pack\
  \ some bug repellant before setting out for the Worldwound.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_XanthirVang_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_XanthirVang_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is another gross-out king, the\
  \ evil Xanthir Vang. Again based on a Wayne Reynolds cover image, Vang is an evil\
  \ villain composed of writhing vermin. He makes a perfect alien spellcaster, uber-villain,\
  \ or all around bad guy. I don't want to give away too much about his role in the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, but suffice it to say—he's not good. Xanthir Vang is a Medium,\
  \ rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week (and for 2013!). We'll see\
  \ you next week (and next year) for a look at the remaining figures in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set. Until then, be safe, be strong,\
  \ and watch out for demons!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br \\> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n\
