  \ and the safety of Absalom’s citizens. After a string of seemingly unrelated crimes\
  \ is revealed as part of a much larger criminal plot, the members of one select\
  \ squad find themselves at the center of things and must put their badges on the\
  \ line to prevent the city from falling into chaos. By the end of this six-part\
