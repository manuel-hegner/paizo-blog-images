  \ Society Sanctioning: Strange Aeons</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May\

  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I spent several minutes trying to think of a\
  \ clever name for the blog announcing that we had finished sanctioning the <a href=\"\
  /store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange Aeons Adventure\
  \ Path</a>. However, after talking to the team and reading the posts from players\
  \ eager to get started playing the adventure path in a PFS-sanctioned environment,\
  \ I realized that less was probably more. So, as you may have surmised from the\
  \ title, Strange Aeons is now officially sanctioned and available for <a href=\"\
  /pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society</a> credit!</p> \n    <p>Strange Aeons is\
  \ the first sanctioning project I tackled after joining the OP developer team here\
  \ at Paizo, so the boons and decisions in the sanctioning document are a combination\
  \ of my (perhaps overly) enthusiastic ideas tempered and refined by John and Linda's\
  \ wisdom and experience. We came up with an idea that the boons themselves could\
  \ tie into the search for identity and purpose that interweaves the themes of psychological\
  \ and subversive horror found in Strange Aeons, taking fundamental questions about\
  \ who your character is and why they're on this adventure and turning them into\
  \ mechanical benefits that enhance an already-awesome story.</p> \n    <p>But what\
  \ if Strange Aeons isn't really your kind of adventure? Well, no worries, because\
  \ there are even more modules and adventure paths queued up and rapidly nearing\
  \ completion! I'm not going to spoil the surprise, but I will say that the next\
  \ module sanctioning we've got working its way through the publication process rhymes\
  \ with \"Hearing the Bound Ditty\" and I recently sent off a sanctioning document\
  \ for layout that rhymes with \"Druids of Pantsland.\" So, I guess what I'm saying\
  \ is, be ready for an awesome year full of newly sanctioned content!</p> \n    <p>Happy\
  \ gaming everyone!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180516-Aeons.jpg\"\
