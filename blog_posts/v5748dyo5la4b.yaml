  date\">Thursday, October 18, 2007</p> \n   <p>As of Friday, October 19th, the Paizo\
  \ Blog will have been in action for six whole months. There's been laughter, there've\
  \ been tears (mostly mine), there've been sneak previews, setting information, contests,\
  \ and a boatload of new art, and it's generally been a good time for all involved.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But now we're coming up on that crucial six-month mark, that time in every\
  \ relationship where we have to look hard at each other and ask some serious questions:\
  \ Are you satisfied? Are your needs being met? Do you think this blog has what it\
  \ takes to keep you interested in the long run, or are we just a casual thing?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>To let us know what you like most about the blog, where we could improve,\
  \ and what you'd like to see more of in the months to come, head on over to the\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizo/websiteFeedback/blogFeedback\">Blog Feedback\
  \ thread on our messageboards</a> and make your needs knownâ€”communication is, after\
  \ all, the key to a healthy relationship, and we'd really like to make this work....\
