  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When working on\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgxd?Adventure-Time-Edge-of-Anarchy\"\
  >Adventure Time: Edge of Anarchy</a>, I really wanted to talk about some of the\
  \ things that didn’t make it into the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> box. Every set, we design more cards than end up\
  \ making it out into the wild. Some cards just get lost to that voracious devourer\
  \ of cards called Card Count, which only lets some preordained multiple of 110 survive.\
  \ Some characters never made it into a Class Deck because we liked how the deck\
  \ (including its selection of cards) looked with the other characters more. This\
  \ series of blogs plans to shed some light on some of these lost elements. Enjoy\
  \ at your own risk!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_MagicalMarketplace.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Balazar, the iconic summoner, stands in a room cluttered with treasures\
  \ and curios, peering into a crystal ball as a robed and hooded shopkeeper looms\
  \ in the background.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Want to trade\
  \ your priceless artifact for my priceless artifact?</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>A\
  \ big mechanic that we tested at some tables throughout the Core and Curse playtesting\
  \ process was the “Market”. At the end of each scenario, you were given the option\
  \ to trade for a readily available boon (one that was either level 0, or at least\
  \ 2 levels lower than you).</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <p>When rebuilding, each\
  \ character may banish 1 boon; any that do may search the vault for a boon with\
  \ a maximum level of the most recently played scenario’s # minus 2 (minimum 0).</p>\n\
  \     </blockquote> \n     <p>It was cut for a few reasons:</p> \n     <ul> \n \
  \     <li>It would add complexity and time to the end of scenarios, as traders did\
  \ in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pacg/adventures/mummysMask\">Mummy’s Mask</a>.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>There was concern around removing some of the loot chase, both in\
  \ terms of reduced difficulty and also reduced excitement.</li> \n      <li>We just\
  \ didn’t have space in the storybook for more mechanics.</li> \n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <p>We considered trying to sneak it in as a simpler mechanic that would piggyback\
  \ off rebuilding to have a similar effect: </p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <p>When\
  \ rebuilding, each character may banish any number of boons.<br>OR<br>When rebuilding,\
  \ each character may banish 1 boon.</p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <p>As long as\
  \ you were able to banish enough boons that you had to refill your deck to make\
  \ it legal, you could replace them with cards that were a maximum level of the most\
  \ recently played scenario’s # minus 2 (minimum 0). Unfortunately, it was less flavorful\
  \ and still had the same complexity and timing flaws. It was also less obvious how\
  \ you use it (especially to newer players). This is a good example of the sort of\
  \ things that cause us to cut material even after it has been developed and tested.\
  \ While the mechanic was dearly beloved by several of our (very experienced) playtesters,\
  \ it added an extra layer of confusion for the newer players. It’s always a balancing\
  \ act to keep the game interesting and challenging, but not overwhelming.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Now that we’ve talked about why we <i>didn’t</i> include it in the box,\
  \ let’s talk about why you might want to play around with it at home. </p> \n  \

  font-size: 13px;\">Even single use, it’s nice to have healing options.</p> \n  \
  \   </div> \n     <p>The main goal of the market concept was to empower characters\
  \ to take and, especially, <i>feel comfortable</i> using consumables like Elixir\
  \ of Healing by providing a reasonable way to replace them. It’s extremely common\
  \ for characters in the RPG to carry around a supply of healing potions and scrolls,\
  \ so we like the idea of a character hanging onto an Elixir of Healing or a scroll\
  \ of Soothing Word, secure in the knowledge they can get it back.</p> \n     <div\

  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">One of these things doesn’t belong with the\
  \ others...</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>A secondary goal of the market was a way\
  \ to address a rare conundrum that can occur. If, for whatever reason, your character\
  \ had to banish a boon you liked, you have to rebuild your deck with whatever card\
  \ you happen to have on hand. Only if there are no spare cards of that type can\
  \ you go searching the box for a reasonable replacement. I’ve seen a few different\
  \ complaints about this, and I’ve also suffered it myself. I was soloing <i>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords</i> with Merisiel when I had to banish my Thieves Tools, probably\
  \ to close a location. Merisiel really liked those Thieves Tools, so I was eager\
  \ to get them back, but I drew a random item from the box (for either closing a\
  \ location or defeating a Cache barrier) and got a Token of Remembrance. It turns\
  \ out that since Merisiel has no spells, that particular item doesn’t help her except\
  \ as a hit point. “No big deal,” I thought, “I’m sure I’ll quickly either banish\
  \ it or find another item I want more.” Sadly, I was stuck with it for 3 whole scenarios.\
  \ In the grand scheme of things, it wasn’t a big deal since I just kept using it\
  \ to feed my backstab power, but it felt <i>wrong!</i></p> \n     <div class=\"\

  font-size: 13px;\">Does Ezren keep failing to acquire ‘your’ Greataxe? Well, we’\
  ve got an offer for you!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>A tertiary goal, and one that\
  \ led to the greatest mechanical argument against including the market concept,\
  \ is that sometimes you just fail to find a boon you really want. Perhaps you really\
  \ want a particular level 1 weapon or blessing, but you’re level 3 and you’ve never\
  \ had a chance to acquire it (perhaps because Lini or Quinn keeps finding it and\
  \ failing to get it for you). It’d be nice to be able to just banish a boon you\
  \ like less and replace it with the one you’ve been hunting for multiple levels.\
  \ That said, one of the most exciting things for many players is the loot chase:\
  \ seeing that dream boon that perfectly complements your character, waiting to luck\
  \ into it, throwing the kitchen sink at acquiring it, and victoriously adding it\
  \ to your deck. If you can too easily just get lower level boons, that takes away\
  \ a fair chunk of the ‘thrill of the chase’ for some people.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  font-size: 13px;\">So many shiny boons, so little deck space.</p> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>An extra benefit for the market appeared later: you can give up boons\
  \ until you think you’re likely to need them. Know that you’re heading into a few\
  \ scenarios full of undead? Go buy a Deathbane weapon. See that there’s an upcoming\
  \ scenario full of arrows and fire? A Covering Shield might be just what you need.\
  \ This is particularly nice now that Loot boons are in the vault. The Loot weapon\
  \ Wyrmsmite from <i>The Dragon’s Demand</i> is great against dragons, which might\
  \ be great to use against a couple of vicious dragons late in <i>Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</i>.</p> \n     <p>I encourage you to try it out and see if it’s good for\
  \ your group. If you think “at the end of a scenario” is too often, you could make\
  \ going to the market require winning the scenario, or only occur at the end of\
  \ an adventure. Another interesting option would be to make a trip to the market\
  \ a reward for having spent a hero point on something other than a feat during a\
  \ scenario, or for being rewarded a hero point and not immediately spending it on\
  \ a feat.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100419_CoreLocationBase.jpg\"\

  >Some locations lend themselves more to a market trip than others.</p> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Another option for <i>Curse</i> specifically is to make the market a\
  \ special feature available at the end of any scenario that included the Base. If\
  \ that sounds too frequent for your group, you could require that characters “put\
  \ in an order” by only allowing characters that explored the Base during the scenario\
  \ to go the market. Just be careful of this option if your group has someone who\
  \ hogs the Base and demolishes it before anyone else can even think of going to\
  \ it. </p> \n     <p>If you want to go a bit crazy, you could even give access to\
  \ the market as a reward for closing certain locations. Just have people keep locations\
  \ they close handy, then at the end you might let whoever closed the Shop trade\
  \ for anything, Academy a spell, Arsenal a weapon, Cathedral a blessing, Tavern\
  \ an ally, etc. This is more complex than we’re likely to publish outside of a blog,\
  \ but it could add an exciting benefit for some groups.</p> \n     <p>If you get\
  \ a chance to play around with the Market, let us know. We love feedback. Maybe\
  \ it will appear in some future product.</p> \n     <p>We’d also love to know if\
  \ this kind of blog content is of interest. It’ll take time and effort to put lost\
  \ boons into a usable form, and a lot of work to develop and test the lost characters\
  \ from class decks, but it may be worth it if enough people would like to see them.</p>\
