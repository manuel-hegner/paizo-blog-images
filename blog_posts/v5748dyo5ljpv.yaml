  >Two weeks ago</a> we revealed a brand new Starfinder core race, the reptilian vesk,\
  \ leaving us with just one mystery race left. Now, at long last, we're revealing\
  \ that final core race: the insectile shirrens!</p> \n     <p>Shirrens were once\
  \ part of the Swarm, a monstrous, locust-like race that traveled from world to world,\
  \ consuming all it encountered before moving on. Generations ago, however, a mysterious\
  \ mutation caused an entire subcolony to break from the Swarm's hive mind, with\
  \ each of its members gaining a sense of self. Addicted to the new drug of individualism,\
  \ these renegades rejected the Swarm's mindless consumption, forming a new race\
  \ called shirrens that eventually came to settle within the Pact World system.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Shirrens are arthropods with chitinous exoskeletons, large\
  \ compound eyes, and sensitive antennae that aid in their telepathy. Unlike many\
  \ arthropodan races, they walk upright, manipulating items with three-clawed hands.\
  \ In addition to their two sets of main limbs, they also have two sets of smaller\
  \ limbs growing from their thoraxes. While often displayed, these “mating arms”\
  \ are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes—to use\
  \ them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female\
  \ and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized\
  \ eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. Shirren young\
  \ spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and are often carried\
  \ around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Shirrens define themselves by their individualism. When they left the Swarm,\
  \ they assumed partial control over the neurological pleasure and pain systems by\
  \ which they were formerly directed, and even generations later, making choices\
  \ for themselves can literally flood them with pleasurable neurotransmitters. While\
  \ this ability is not always beneficial—some shirrens deliberately drug themselves\
  \ this way, becoming “option junkies” blissed out on sequences of trivial decisions—\
  freedom of choice is crucial to shirren identity. At the same time, shirrens remain\
  \ highly communal, and are valued as collaborators by other races due to their ability\
  \ to foster teamwork and put the goals of the group first.</p> \n     <p>All 7 of\
  \ the core Starfinder player races—humans, androids, kasathas, lashuntas, vesk,\
  \ shirrens, and ysoki—are joined in the core rulebook by updated versions of Pathfinder's\
  \ core races, and even more playable races will be following shortly behind in the\
  \ Alien Archive. Now that the core rulebook is off to the printer, you're going\
  \ to be seeing a steady stream of Starfinder-related preview blogs right up through\
  \ the game's launch at Gen Con, so keep your transponders on and open to future\
  \ transmissions!</p> \n     <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p>\
