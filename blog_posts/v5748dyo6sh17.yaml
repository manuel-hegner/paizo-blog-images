  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"> As the year draws to a close, I’m at one final\
  \ convention – PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. If you're attending, be sure to stop\
  \ by the Paizo Booth (#2646) or the Organzied Play Room (#120-B) and say hi!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>After this, a few weeks of rest...well, at least a few weeks of no travel.\
  \ We’ve got plenty of plans to implement and tasks to complete during December.\
  \ To give our team some time to relax over the holidays, and to ensure our players\
  \ have games to play, we are releasing our December scenarios on the 18th of the\
  \ month. The blog previews are scheduled for December 11th, so join us next week\
  \ to take a peek at what is coming up!.</p> \n     <p>Some of you may have seen\
  \ some updates regarding pregenerated characters for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters\"\
  >Pathfinder Society (2nd edition)</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ukw?Community-Use-Package-Starfinder-Society-Pregenerated-Characters\"\
  >Starfinder Society</a> For Pathfinder, we’ve corrected some errors, changed weight/carrying\
  \ capacity, and added third level versions of a limited number of pregens, so that\
  \ new players can participate in the first Level 3-6 scenario that released the\
  \ end of November. Starfinder Society has three new pregens for the new classes\
  \ in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual\"\
  >Character Operations Manual</a>. All of these are Society legal for play. We hope\
  \ you enjoy! </p> \n     <p>In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh15\"\
  >last Tuesday’s blog</a>, we announced PaizoCon 2020 Guests of Honor (yay Kate and\
  \ Damien!) and opened ticket sales. In related news, the Organized Play Foundation’\
  s general call for volunteers to GM or help with HQ opens on Thursday, December\
  \ 5th at 0800 am. More information is available on the <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">OPF website.</a> </p> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n    \
  \ <p>We awarded no coins during the past month.</p> \n     <h2>Stars</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>One GM reached their 5th star in December. We still have a few weeks in 2019\
  \ for those trying to earn their 5th star before the year’s end. Doing so indicates\
  \ a commitment to organized play, as to achieve this milestone, GMs must run 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to <b>Willis Sloat</b>\
  \ on achieving his 5th star!</p> \n     <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>We’\
  ve received a few evaluations, so hopefully we will see a few 5-nova GMs soon! While\
  \ we wait for the online nova evaluation tool, which is part of a greater tools\
  \ overhaul, we’ve made an online form for logging evaluation games. Venture-Captains,\
  \ please use <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQH9FbQtZ1afA5-IqgDG4v-QD262rk_oqKjv9eSsJZnGIGaw/viewform\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this form</a> to submit evaluations.</p> \n     <p>Quite a few\
  \ of our community earned their first glyph this month! Congrats to everyone running\
  \ events and qualifying for their glyphs. Huzzah and thank you. </p> \n     <h2>Convention\
  \ Listing</h2> \n     <p>While only a few conventions remain in the 2019 convention\
  \ season, we’ve already got a few listed for 2020, and the list grows daily! You\
  \ can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes\
  \ all submissions as of 1 October. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and\
  \ have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the\
  \ list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or\
  \ Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check\
  \ out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>\
