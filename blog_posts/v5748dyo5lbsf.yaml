  \  <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, January 19, 2011</p> \n   <p>Greetings! If you are\
  \ reading this then by the grace of Cayden Cailean my message has slipped past the\
  \ wards. [Ha! You only <b>think</b> they have….] I have been interning with Paizo\
  \ since late October of 2010, so my deepest apologies for the belated introduction.\
  \ They keep me really, really busy here [Oh yes we do! Get back to work!] I am a\
  \ Philosophy major with a Law Degree who has (probably due to a <i>geas</i>) decided\
  \ to make a move and break into the gaming industry. Now you may be thinking, “\
  Lawyer? Asmodeus? Chelish evil empire?” but you have it all wrong. [No, I think\
  \ we have you pegged just about right…] As a youth I sharpened my teeth on 2nd Edition,\
  \ and then continued on to 3rd Edition and 3.5. I was introduced to Pathfinder last\
  \ year and rejoiced that the classic feel of the game was being kept alive. Since\
  \ starting here my eyes have been opened to many things (some of which I can not\
  \ speak of) [You better not! You'll miss out on Lilith Ninja Cookies if you do get\
  \ too chatty.] that I had taken for granted for so long. The biggest thing being\
  \ the amount of work that goes into every single thing that ends up on a game store\
  \ shelf. Uh oh, I can hear them coming, drums in the deep; it is time to feed the\
  \ kobolds. I will endeavor to send more messages when I can, but until that time,\
  \ may your tankard always be full!</p> \n   <p>Michael Kenway <br>Editorial Intern\
  \ Extraordinaire</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Intern, Paizo, Pathfinder -->\
