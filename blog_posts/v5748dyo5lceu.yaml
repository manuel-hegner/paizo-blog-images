  \ <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 26, 2011</p> \n   <p>During the preview banquet\
  \ at PaizoCon this year, I boasted that <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ies\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a> had a gigantic feats chapter, which started off with\
  \ a seven-page table, summarizing all the feats. While that is impressive, I realized\
  \ later that I made a mistake—the feats table is nine pages long!</p> \n   <p>This\
  \ week we're going to take a look at the feats chapter a bit more closely, since\
  \ it is such an important part of this book. This chapter contains 256 feats, suitable\
  \ for characters of every race and class. There are feats to grant bonuses with\
  \ nets, feats that let you mix a hex with an unarmed strike, and feats that nearly\
  \ let you rip off your opponents head! While many of them are combat feats, there\
  \ are a few new feat categories as well. Grit feats modify and amplify the abilities\
  \ of the gunslinger class, while style feats represent fighting forms and techniques,\
  \ primarily employed by martial art masters, such as the monk. Take a look at this\
  \ chain of style feats.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <table\
  \ border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"right\">\n    <tbody>\n\
  \     <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1118-Monk.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1118-Monk_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\"><span\
  \ class=\"tiny\"><i>Illustration by Dmitry Burmak</i></span></td>\n     </tr>\n\
  \    </tbody>\n   </table>\n  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Crane\
  \ Style (Combat, Style)</b><br> Your unarmed fighting techniques blend poise with\
  \ graceful defense.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>: Dodge, Improved Unarmed Strike, base\
  \ attack bonus +2 or monk level 1st.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: You take only a –2 penalty\
  \ on attack rolls for fighting defensively. While using this style and fighting\
  \ defensively or using the total defense action, you gain an additional +1 dodge\
  \ bonus to your Armor Class.</p> \n    <p><b>Crane Wing (Combat)</b><br> You move\
  \ with the speed and finesse of an avian hunter, your sweeping blocks and graceful\
  \ motions allowing you to deflect melee attacks with ease.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Crane Style, Dodge, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +5 or monk level\
  \ 5th.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: Once per round while using Crane Style, when you have\
  \ at least one hand free and are either fighting defensively or using the total\
  \ defense action, you can deflect one melee weapon attack that would normally hit\
  \ you. You expend no action to deflect the attack, but you must be aware of it and\
  \ not flat-footed. An attack so deflected deals no damage to you.</p> \n    <p><b>Crane\
  \ Riposte (Combat)</b><br> You use your defensive abilities to make overpowering\
  \ counterattacks.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>: Crane Style, Crane Wing, Dodge, Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8 or monk level 7th.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: You\
  \ take only a –1 penalty on attack rolls for fighting defensively. Whenever you\
  \ use Crane Wing to deflect an opponent's attack, you can make an attack of opportunity\
  \ against that opponent after the attack is deflected.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n\
  \   <p>This is one of the easiest style feats to qualify for, but the trick with\
  \ these feats is that you cannot utilize more than one style feat at a time, and\
  \ you cannot use the other feats in the chain unless you are using the base style\
  \ feat as well. While this means you can get some pretty good abilities if you just\
  \ focus on one chain, getting into multiple chains forces you to make decisions\
  \ about which abilities you want on a given round.</p> \n   <p>Of course, the chapter\
  \ also features some new teamwork feats and a new classification of feats called\
  \ Performance feats, which give you an edge when fighting in an arena or other theater\
  \ of blood. Take a look at these two, one from each category.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Shake It Off (Teamwork)</b><br> You support your allies and help them\
  \ recover from crippling effects.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: When you are adjacent to one\
  \ or more allies who also have this feat, you gain a +1 bonus on saving throws per\
  \ such ally (maximum +4).</p> \n    <p><b>Murderer's Circle (Combat, Performance)</b><br>\
  \ After savaging your foe, you circle like a hunter ready for the kill.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Dodge, Acrobatics 4 ranks.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: When you spend a swift action to\
  \ make a performance combat check after scoring a critical hit or performing a combat\
  \ maneuver, and you are adjacent to the target of the critical hit or combat maneuver,\
  \ you can move to any other space that is adjacent to the target without provoking\
  \ attacks of opportunity. You must have a clear path to that space and the ability\
  \ to reach it by spending a move action. If you end this move in any space other\
  \ than the one where you started, you gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat\
  \ check.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>I must admit, I picked those two to show\
  \ off due mainly to their awesome names. There are a lot of really great feats in\
  \ this book and I would love to show off all of them to you, but you'll just have\
  \ to check them out for yourself when the book releases next week. For our final\
  \ preview, we're going to take a look at some of the great new rules systems found\
  \ in this book, including vehicle combat!</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>Lead Designer</p>\
