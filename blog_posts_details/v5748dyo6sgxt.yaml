    \ Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights.\
    \ Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands\
    \ on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, as the armor\
    \ is functionally similar to full plate."
