  _blank\">Gen Con's</a> only about a week away—I'm sure my colleagues' fainting away\
  \ is out of sheer excitement—and Paizo's organized play team is bringing a huge\
  \ amount of new content to debut. It's too much to share all in one blog, so we're\
  \ saving our six new scenarios (three Pathfinder Society and three Starfinder Society)\
  \ for next week and starting off with our special events.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS0100E-SalvationsEnd.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>From Thurston:</p> \n    <p>In our last Starfinder Society\
  \ blog, you may have already heard a bit about <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #01-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a>, written by organized\
  \ play veteran freelance author Larry Wilhelm. While this scenario acts as background\
  \ to the eventual formation of the Acquisitives faction, it also serves to introduce\
  \ the universe of Starfinder to a wide audience. Players take on the roles of our\
  \ iconic Starfinder characters in their 4th-level iterations, showcasing some of\
  \ the abilities and skills each class gets after a few levels of play. The special\
  \ starts in the Pact Worlds and quickly moves into the unexplored reaches of space,\
  \ getting into starship action, and eventually ending up on the false moon of <i>Salvation's\
  \ End</i>. As you can see by the impressive artwork, <i>Salvation's End</i> is a\
  \ pretty big location, and the PCs get their first look at it in our opening Starfinder\
  \ Society special. One thing that really excites me, both as a developer and writer,\
  \ are locations that can service multiple visits. Sufficed to say, <i>Salvation's\
  \ End</i> is something we expect to regularly see in the Starfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild campaign. We hope it develops into something like the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild's own Gloomspires or Absalom Siege Castles. The first tables\
  \ of Claim to Salvation open on Thursday evening, and I'm excited to see the result\
  \ of Larry's stellar (bad pun) work.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFQ0001E-Julzakama_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Before <em>Claim to Salvation</em> debuts, players have\
  \ an opportunity to learn the Starfinder rules with <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Quest-Into-the-Unknown\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Quest: Into the Unknown</em></a>, by an\
  \ author who probably doesn't need any introduction: Ron Lundeen. Ron's credits\
  \ include too many adventure path installments to list and one of my favorite Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios, <a href=\"/products/btpy8qq1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-321-The-Temple-of-Empyreal-Enlightenment\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-21: The Temple of Empyreal Enlightenment</em></a>.\
  \ After working with Ron on several projects, I knew I wanted him to tackle this\
  \ very important introduction to Starfinder. I can honestly say that he knocked\
  \ this quest pack out of the park—maybe into orbit... ok not that... oh, he knocked\
  \ it to the Drift! <em>Into the Unknown</em> takes the PCs from Absalom Station\
  \ out to the depths of space, but does so in a way that really showcases what it\
  \ means to be a Starfinder Society field agent. This quest pack provides a cohesive\
  \ narrative spaced over the course of five distinct quests, including two introductory\
  \ starship combat encounters. I'm eager to see GMs across the world get a chance\
  \ to run these quests and introduce players to the science fantasy setting of Starfinder!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>From John:</p> \n    <p>Multi-table interactive specials are something\
  \ of a tradition at Gen Con, and this year's only difference is one of scope: we\
  \ have two such specials. If you attended this year's PaizoCon, Origins, PaizoCon\
  \ UK, or UK Games Expo, you've no doubt experienced <a href=\"/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99: The Solstice Scar Version A</em></a> by the\
  \ talented Andrew Hoskins. We'll be running this excellent tale of museum curating\
  \ gone tragically wrong on Saturday night. If you haven't heard, we'll be updating\
  \ <em>The Solstice Scar</em> about twice a year to cycle in new content and advance\
  \ the storyline. Gen Con 2017 marks not only the point at which you can start scheduling\
  \ this for public events, but also celebrates the occasion by our running more than\
  \ 180 tables of the adventure simultaneously.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0900-Gulgamodh.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0900-Gulgamodh_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We're also debuting <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a> by Mikko Kallio.\
  \ For millennia, warlords of all stripes have dreamed of conquering the City at\
  \ the Center of the World. These sieges are central to Absalom's history and remain\
  \ a prominent archaeological scar on its surrounding lands. For the first time in\
  \ decades, someone has dared to besiege the city, and unless the Society's ready\
  \ to aid Absalom's defense, this familiar conqueror might succeed. Not only has\
  \ Mikko done an excellent job of presenting an exciting adventure and incorporating\
  \ Absalom's flavor, but we've also worked with Keith Richmond from Lone Shark to\
  \ provide an Adventure Card Guild component. Join us on Friday night for the tremendous\
  \ event! Absalom may never be the same, and we may be hearing the repercussions\
  \ of this epic battle for months to come.</p> \n    <p>It's gonna to be big—like,\
  \ \"towering battle golem with...is that a cannon arm?\" big.</p> \n    <p>And of\
  \ course, you'll be able to find all of us either in the Sagamore Ballroom or at\
  \ booth 103 in the exhibitor hall. Come by and say hello. Also be sure to check\
  \ back here next week, when Linda tells us about the upcoming Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenarios.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">John Compton and Thurston Hillman<br>\
