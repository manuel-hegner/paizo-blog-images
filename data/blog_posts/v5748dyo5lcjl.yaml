  \  </div> \n    <p>Though I only joined the company a couple weeks ago, I was invited\
  \ to join the rest of the team at Gen Con in Indianapolis. I was thrilled at the\
  \ opportunity, since it would enable me to bolster our company's presence within\
  \ the gaming community and meet some of our most passionate fans. In addition, the\
  \ trip nurtured group cohesion within the company, and I'm happy to say I know many\
  \ of my coworkers far better than I did before. All that being said, I am glad to\
  \ be on familiar ground again. As for my Gen Con experience, I have the following\
  \ words.</p> \n    <p>It was fun! It was exhausting. It was a lot of things. It\
  \ reminded me of the retail job I had when I was 18 in some respects. It reminded\
  \ me of the anime convention I went to when I was 15 in other respects. In most\
  \ respects, though, it was totally unique and utterly impossible to describe. I\
  \ met a lot of cool people, and I learned a lot of weird things. Things I learned:</p>\
  \ \n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>There is a restaurant chain called Steak 'n'\
  \ Shake.</li> \n     <li>Local coffee shops in Indianapolis close ridiculously early,\
  \ usually around 3 p.m.</li> \n     <li>Our fans are awesome.</li> \n     <li>Some\
  \ people still don't know all about Pathfinder (what!?) and are eager to learn about\
  \ it.</li> \n     <li>I love Washington weather and will never complain about it\
  \ again.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Patrick Renie<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\n\
  \    <br> \n    <p>If my first Gen Con taught me one thing it's that no one can\
  \ adequately prepare you for the spectacle and energy of this convention. (If it\
  \ taught me another thing it's that I can apparently make do with a lot less sleep\
  \ than I had previously thought.) Meeting all the fans who visited the Paizo booth\
  \ was a real joy, and while I certainly do not possess the roleplaying expertise\
  \ of James Jacobs or Jason Bulmahn—or any other Paizo employee for that matter—\
  I had a lot of fun discussing our products with the endless stream of visitors.\
  \ We really do have the best fans in the business.</p> \n    <p>We also get to work\
  \ with the best artists in the business. As this was my first time attending Gen\
  \ Con, I obviously can't compare it to previous years, but I was shocked by the\
  \ number of talented artists who stopped by to say hi or to show us their portfolios.\
  \ Meeting—and reconnecting with—artists is the best part of my job, and I can't\
  \ think of a better venue for this than Gen Con (cue special shout out to Stephen\
  \ Radney-MacFarland for introducing me to Larry Elmore). I can't wait for next year!</p>\
