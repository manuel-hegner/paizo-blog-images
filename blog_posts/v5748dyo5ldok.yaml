  \   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Pathfinder Battles Preview: Spirit of\
  \ the Season</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 20, 2012</p> \n   <p>With\
  \ the glories of PaizoCon behind us, the Paizo editorial department finds itself\
  \ deep in the throes of that fabulous annual event called Gen Con Prep. The office\
  \ is abuzz with the work of getting ready for the Big Show. All of Gen Con's big\
  \ releases (Ultimate Equipment, the Bestiary Box, etc.) were finished long ago,\
  \ of course, but there's still a ton of stuff to do before we can head to Indianapolis\
  \ next month. We've got catalogs to finish, signs to complete, Pathfinder Society\
  \ events to edit, and a million other tasks that are probably invisible to Gen Con\
  \ attendees, but which are absolutely critical to making sure the show goes off\
  \ without a hitch.</p> \n   <p>That's all a very long and elaborate way of saying\
  \ I've been too slammed this week to write a proper blog introducing the next set\
  \ of Pathfinder Battles miniatures, which ties into August's Shattered Star Adventure\
  \ Path. We've seen about 2/3rds of the paint masters for this set already, and they\
  \ continue the tradition of steady and amazing improvement we've been shooting for\
  \ with each new release in the Pathfinder Battles line. The WizKids production manager\
  \ is bringing over a bunch more paint masters tomorrow, and I'm hoping we'll have\
  \ seen almost the complete set within a few short weeks.</p> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">The first pictures of some Shattered Star minis will come next week.\
  \ This week I want to show off a miniature that fits in between the Rise of the\
  \ Runelords and Shattered Star sets. And it just so happens that this miniature\
  \ ties into the general theme of Gen Con Prep, as it's the official 2012 convention\
  \ promo figure: The Festering Spirit!</span></p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120720-FesteringSpirit.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120720-FesteringSpirit_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>The Festering Spirt made its debut at PaizoCon,\
  \ where we included a complimentary figure in every attendee's goodie bag. We'll\
  \ also have the figure at Gen Con, available for free with any purchase of $50 or\
  \ more.</p> \n   <p>Many of you may recognize the base sculpt of the Festering Spirit\
  \ as the Spectre from the Heroes &amp; Monsters set. This time, we've cast the undead\
  \ horror in clear plastic, and then drybrushed the figure with shades of opaque\
  \ green. The mini really shines when held to the light, and the whole thing adds\
  \ a very \"toxic\" luster to what is already a spooky miniature in any color.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We'll have singles of the Festering Spirit available following Gen Con\
  \ here on paizo.com, so those of you who weren't able to make PaizoCon or Gen Con\
  \ will still get a chance to get your hands on this very cool figure.</p> \n   <p>And\
  \ with that, it's back to the salt mines for me! Next week, we'll take our first\
  \ real look at the Shattered Star, and you guys are going to be blown away!</p>\
