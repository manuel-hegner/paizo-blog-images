  \  <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Amanda Hamon joined the Paizo\
  \ fam back at the start of April in 2015 and now she’s heading off to new adventures\
  \ where she will be joining the Kobold Press fam as Editorial Director. (The Kobold\
  \ empire is hers!—I can’t confirm that, but it’s likely.)</p> \n      <p>This blog\
  \ has been hard for me to write. Amanda has been my partner in crime here at Paizo\
  \ since she joined us, and for more than three years we’ve been managing the development\
  \ of Pathfinder and Starfinder together. We’ve been collaborators and conspirators.\
  \ We’ve been friends and confidants. We’ve been there for each other and we’ve worked\
  \ long nights and some weekends to make sure that y’all get quality gaming material.\
  \ We’ve made sure that our teams and our freelancers were taken care of and had\
  \ what they needed to get the job done. We made a pact to let each other know if\
  \ we had plans on leaving the company, so I was among the first to hear of this.\
  \ I’m really sad to see her move on, and not having her here with me to talk over\
  \ the kind of decisions we make is going to be hard. But, I know I will carry on\
  \ the things she’s taught me to make the best calls I can. Thank you, Amanda.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As co-managers, we worked so well together. There have been so few\
  \ work relationships I’ve had in my life that have been as flawless. I can’t think\
  \ of a single time in our years that we ever disagreed with how we should handle\
  \ something. We were always side-by-side on the decisions we made, and I honestly\
  \ couldn’t have asked for a better partner and colleague. </p> \n      <p>We’ve\
  \ also had a lot of fun. We made rad games. Together we drove our company to better\
  \ standards. Together we worked hard with other folks on the staff to make our conventions\
  \ and those who attend them safer. Together we helped make positive and engaging\
  \ (and creepy) content in the books we oversaw. Together we worked our asses off\
  \ setting up for conventions (and we celebrated our victories for doing so—as we\
  \ should!).</p> \n      <p>Amanda was a freelancer for us when I first joined the\
  \ Paizo staff, and some of her early work for us was among the first I worked on\
  \ as a staff developer. I was super impressed and continued to reach out to her\
  \ for freelance work and encouraged other developers on staff to do so. She came\
  \ from a journalism background, and that professionalism totally showed. Journalists\
  \ know how to hit a deadline and deal with editorial standards. </p> \n      <p>Amanda,\
  \ I wish you all the best in your new role of making awesome game material for folks!\
  \ Wolfgang has certainly scooped up great talent and I know that you’re going to\
  \ be an absolute asset to that company. I’ll miss working with you on the day-to-day,\
  \ but I know that we’ll still hang out (and still talk shop!). Much love to you.\
  \ I’ll miss you, and keep kicking all the ass you’ve always kicked!</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Now I’ll share this space to let others in the company to give their thoughts.</p>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Adam Daigle<br> <em>Managing\
  \ Developer</em></p> \n      <br> \n      <hr> \n      <br> \n      <p><b>James\
  \ Jacobs:</b><br> Amanda! Your influence on Paizo is indisputable—you made the company\
  \ better, and even though you're off to be a kobold now, I know that we'll continue\
  \ to benefit from your influence and presence and imagination. Thank you for all\
  \ of the hours/days/weeks spent in conversations about vampires and ghosties and\
  \ sinister monsters and all the things that go bump in the night. Thank you for\
  \ all the amazing adventures, particularly in helping to launch the first Adventure\
  \ Path for 2nd edition Pathfinder. And thank you especially for the ghost pirates\
  \ and the acid spewing crater aliens and the forever-quest of Groetus-vision-fueled\
  \ pursuits of doubtful wine and questionable repasts. Most of those shenanigans\
  \ will, of course, continue onward into the future, but when we finally get back\
  \ to the office after all these months of working from home, with you not there\
  \ to kick in my office door with conversations about creepy mushroom gifs or dancing\
  \ clowns or brain-collecting vampires or which incarnations of Dracula are best\
  \ (and which ones should be avoided forever)… the building will still feel emptier\
  \ than before.</p> \n      <p><b>Devinne Caples:</b><br> I only really got to know\
  \ Amanda on her way out. I have to say she is vibrant, intelligent, and down to\
  \ Earth. A true joy to be around. Though our time working together was short, I\
  \ wish Amanda the absolute best in her new position and in the adventures to come!\
  \ Congratulations!</p> \n      <p><b>Jason Keeley:</b><br> Amanda and I moved across\
  \ the country and started at Paizo at about the same time, and though we were in\
  \ different departments (I was an editor then), we were in the same boat. She was,\
  \ of course, super friendly and a pleasure to work with, but I didn’t get to know\
  \ the real Amanda until we started gaming together. From board games to video games\
  \ to RPGs, we’ve had hundreds of hours of fun in a style that I can describe only\
  \ as “controlled chaos.” I’m going to miss her at the office terribly, but this\
  \ feeling is tempered by the fact that I’m certain we’ll be gaming together again\
  \ real soon (For the Crimson Eel!). If you ever get the chance to work with Amanda\
  \ on a project, you should take it, and if you ever get the chance to play with\
  \ her, consider yourself truly lucky because you’re in for a wacky, fun time! Cheers,\
  \ Amanda!</p> \n      <p><b>James Sutter: </b><br> Amanda is one of the best game\
  \ industry folks I've had the privilege to work with. Among many other projects,\
  \ she was crucial in the development of the Starfinder Core Rulebook, especially\
  \ when it came to figuring out ways to make the game fun and welcoming to the widest\
  \ possible audience. She's someone you can always depend on—when everything's on\
  \ fire and the wheels seem about to come off the bus, you know Amanda will be there\
  \ to help you drag things across the finish line, and keep you laughing the whole\
  \ time. I'm delighted that she's taking on such a huge role with Kobold, and I can't\
  \ wait to see what she does with it!</p> \n      <p><b>John Compton:</b><br> Amanda,\
  \ in your 5 years at Paizo you’ve always brought energy, ideas, leadership, compassion,\
  \ perspective, and excitement to your work. From re-imagining devils to treading\
  \ new ground for kobolds under that Hellknight Hill to working together to devise\
  \ the future of mechs in Starfinder, you’ve always brought fresh inspiration and\
  \ a readiness to question tired traditions.</p> \n      <p>Most of all, though,\
  \ you’ve reminded us of what lies at the heart of the gaming experience: fun. Plumbing\
  \ the depths of Elemental Evil wouldn’t have been the same without your reckless,\
  \ sword-swinging, squirrel-toting antics. The ongoing story of rebuilding Crookcove\
  \ isn’t complete without your character’s distinguished approach to Groetus. And\
  \ of course, who can forget your bare-knuckle homages to the past decades’ wrestling\
  \ greats in the wild antics of XTREM?</p> \n      <p>…you have a lot of antics.\
  \ Never change.</p> \n      <p>For every grimdark conundrum and deep space disaster\
  \ science-fantasy can deliver, your approach reminds us that in a setting so replete\
  \ with weird worlds and utterly bizarre aliens, the genre is just as effective a\
  \ conduit for levity. Your future projects gives the gaming community so much more\
  \ to look forward to!</p> \n      <p><b>Judy Bauer:</b><br> Amanda, I’ve missed\
  \ seeing you in person for months, and I’m going to miss your professional yet metal\
  \ presence even more once you’re at Kobold Press. You’re gonna knock their socks\
  \ off!</p> \n      <p><b>John Feil:</b><br> <u>A haiku…</u><br> Amanda Hamon<br>\
  \ Her name has five syllables<br> and we will miss her</p> \n      <p><b>Payton\
  \ Smith: </b><br> Amanda was always professional, attentive, and hilarious in the\
  \ right moments. In all my years on working with developers and game industry professionals,\
  \ Amanda Hamon will always be the shining example I will point to when talking to\
  \ curious individuals seeking to enter this industry</p> \n      <p>For my single\
  \ year at being here in Paizo, I’ve’d learned a lot from Amanda. And I wish her\
  \ well in all of the things she will most certainly excel at in the future.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer:</b><br> Amanda and I started at Paizo right\
  \ around the same time, as Assistant Developers. She quickly established herself\
  \ as the person who could do anything, the multitalented rock star who was always\
  \ getting pushed on to whatever project was in the direst situation. And it wasn't\
  \ long before people learned to rely upon her. I know I'm not the only person she's\
  \ inspired with her determination, wisdom, empathy, and humor. Amanda's departure\
  \ is a big loss for all of us at Paizo, but I know that she's going to do great\
  \ at her new position. Keep being awesome, Amanda!</p> \n      <p><b>Aaron Shanks:</b><br>\
  \ When I first came to Paizo I learned Amanda used to be a reporter, which might\
  \ help explain why she was so articulate on camera. As a new PR Manager it was nice\
  \ for me to talk things out with her. That poise was always present off camera.\
  \ I'll miss having her on the team.</p> \n      <p><b>Lyz Liddell:</b><br> Amanda\
  \ is the reason I moved to the Pacific Northwest to take on a full-time gig working\
  \ for Paizo. I’d been lurking in the remote lands of Ohio as a full-time contractor\
  \ for years, but when my contract was forced to end (thanks Microsoft?), it was\
  \ Amanda who reached out to try and recruit me. She took the time out of her day\
  \ to get me on a video call (way less common in pre-quarantine days) and talk me\
  \ through the process of moving from the Midwest to the PNW and making a living\
  \ making games—the good, the bad, the weird, the delightful. I ended up not taking\
  \ Amanda’s offer (Judy Bauer stole me instead!) but I really think I wouldn’t have\
  \ been brave enough to move out here if it weren’t for Amanda. Working with her\
  \ has been a delight, and I can’t wait to see what wacky schemes she comes up with\
  \ next.</p> \n      <p><b>Jason Bulmahn:</b><br> It is rare and special thing to\
  \ work with someone who has such boundless optimism, infectious laugh, and tireless\
  \ dedication to the craft. Amanda has all three in excess. She is an incredible\
  \ creative force, and everything she touches turns out so much better thanks to\
  \ her imagination and passion for games. I am sad to see her go, but and I am incredibly\
  \ excited to see what she comes up with in her new endeavors.</p> \n      <p><b>Tonya\
  \ Woldridge:</b><br> I enjoyed the time we spent working on convention circuit–\
  long hours filled with laughs and voices and I thank you for the memories. UK trips\
  \ just won’t be the same without you. I look forward to seeing what you do in future,\
  \ as your creativity, drive, and passion for writing expand our industry. Best wishes\
  \ on your future endeavors!</p> \n      <p><b>Diego Valdez:</b><br> Amanda’s and\
  \ my jobs don’t really intersect, so we don’t see each other much in the office.\
  \ Despite that we have become pretty good friends. Amanda has helped me build friendships\
  \ with many wonderful people who are now mutual friends. I will always appreciate\
  \ that. At an old job that closed up shop I was really sad because my coworkers\
  \ were awesome. One of them reminded me that, “Even if you don't work with them\
  \ anymore, you can still be friends with your coworkers.” Since then I have always\
  \ tried to remember that when someone leaves. The office won’t be the same without\
  \ her there, but that doesn’t mean we have to stop going to watch wrestling. Amanda,\
  \ you’re a wonderful, awesome, SOLID STEEL friend! All my best wishes in your new\
  \ adventure!</p> \n      <p><b>Erik Mona:</b><br> Amanda Hamon made a huge impact\
  \ on Paizo from the moment she arrived to the moment she left us for an awesome\
  \ editorial opportunity at another company last Friday. Her keen development skills,\
  \ strong management of Starfinder’s developers, and her moral compass have been\
  \ great assets to the editorial department as well as to Paizo as a whole, and we\
  \ will miss her terribly. Amanda brought the same level of enthusiasm to her job\
  \ as a leader and manager at Paizo as she did throwing herself into the role of\
  \ a jittery space goblin at a convention demo. I’ll never forget the way her stunning,\
  \ professional-grade goblin impression echoed through the halls of PaizoCon, bringing\
  \ a smile to anyone who ever heard of it. Amanda’s also been a road warrior during\
  \ her time here, helping with Gen Con booth set-up and tear-down, representing our\
  \ games at industry conferences, and demoing across the land, from Seattle to Indianapolis\
  \ to Philadelphia to the UK. Recently, we all got a chance to sit at her table thanks\
  \ to the astounding Starfinder XTREM streaming game on our official Twitch channel.\
  \ Had someone else pitched a game based on professional wrestling in the Starfinder\
  \ universe, I might have balked. Not so with Amanda. I knew she would do a fantastic\
  \ job, just as she has for every other task we’ve put before her since coming here\
  \ (and, as a freelance writer, since even before that). Congratulations, Amanda!\
  \ We all look forward to seeing what you create next. You made a tremendous impact\
  \ upon Paizo’s culture, upon all your colleagues, and upon Paizo itself. See you\
  \ on the road!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags: Paizo, Paizo News,\
