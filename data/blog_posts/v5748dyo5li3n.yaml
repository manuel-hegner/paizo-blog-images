  \ and in your childlike naiveté you assumed this book held answers. That is the\
  \ lie we teach our children, after all: Books hold answers. Knowledge is power.\
  \ Broaden yourself and you shall no longer be the fearful, mewling lump you dropped\
  \ into this world as.</p> \n     <p>But now you know the truth.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">You read your <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>.\
  \ You assumed it would satisfy you; would answer your questions. But now you're\
  \ left with an intellectual hunger no crumb of written word can sate. Yet you scrape\
  \ through the cupboards, hoping—no, begging to a universe you hope is just that\
  \ page will relieve the pangs for just One. More. Day.</p> \n     <p>It won't. It\
  \ can't. The truth of this world—beneath the playful façade of queens and dragons\
  \ we set out to delight clumsier minds—is grisly and devoid of sense. I have the\
  \ book you want; the book you need. This book of <a href=\"/products/btpy9grw\"\
  ><em>Occult Origins</em></a> tempts you with so many new secrets—questions you never\
  \ even thought to ask—but it can't offer peace of mind. You knew this before you\
  \ stepped in, and yet here we both stand. You need to know how kineticists are born,\
  \ and why they hurl the fundamental forces of the universe as carelessly as a child\
  \ throws a disobedient doll. You long to know why the psychic mind can overwrite\
  \ a world you believed to be so stable and sound and impervious to whim. But this\
  \ book isn't a book of answer. You will leave here all the hungrier. But you will\
  \ leave here book in hand, knowing you are richer, and perhaps one step closer to\
  \ mad.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9461-Kineticist.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy9grw\"><em>Occult Origins</em></a> tells\
  \ of chaokineticists, who channel the universe's devouring maw and wield death and\
  \ decay, and the phytokinetic disciplines of distant Tian, who kindle the energy\
  \ of life to violent and deadly ends. It whispers the secrets of Chelish mental\
  \ disciplines to wither the unbending will of devils. It details the ancient art\
  \ of the reliquarians, who suckle powers the gods themselves leave in their passing.\
  \ It will teach you how to develop the powers of your psychic mind through introspection,\
  \ or reflection on the lives—and deaths—you have long since outgrown. It can teach\
  \ you to modify the delicate web of bone of sinew that contains the immortal essence\
  \ of your being.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Trepanation</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">Through careful study and practice, you have learned\
  \ how to relieve pressure in the brain to balance the humors, promote health, and\
  \ ward off outside influence.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites:</b>\
  \ Heal 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Benefit:</b> You can perform the faith healing occult skill unlock<sup>OA</sup>\
  \ even if you can't use psychic magic. If you can cast psychic spells or have the\
  \ Psychic Sensitivity<sup>OA</sup> feat, you can use faith healing one additional\
  \ time per day.<br> So long as you have a healer's kit<sup>UE</sup> or surgeon's\
  \ tools<sup>UE</sup>, you can spend 1 hour performing a full trepanation on a creature.\
  \ This procedure requires a Heal check (DC = 20 + the target's Hit Dice). If you're\
  \ successful, the target gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against curses,\
  \ possession, and spells from the enchantment (compulsion) school. These effects\
  \ persist for 1 day per character level you possess. If you fail the check, the\
  \ target takes 1d3 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. You can\
  \ perform this procedure on yourself, but the DC increases by 5.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>But it can't tell you such things are the law of the land, or pull aside\
  \ the shadows far larger forces cast across your world—perhaps even across your\
  \ self. It teaches occult rituals to bind gods into your army or force back psychic\
  \ influence, but it can never teach you why an assemblage of words and willpower\
  \ make the strict laws of creation shudder and cower.</p> \n     <p>But maybe it\
  \ gives you just enough. Maybe this keeps you hungry enough that you keep asking\
  \ questions and checking dark corners. Maybe you'll be the first to understand the\
  \ why of it all without losing your life or your mind. Most likely not, but maybe.\
  \ Gods' speed to you.</p> \n     <p>Or whatever you pray to.</p> \n     <p>Crystal\
