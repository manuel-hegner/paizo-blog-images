  >Godsrain Contingencies</a>*</h3>\n      <p>When Yivali held death in her talons,\
  \ she feared delivering such terrible warnings without also hope. Included in her\
  \ annotations was research into&nbsp;<strong>what the world might become</strong>&nbsp;if\
  \ each god’s death were to occur, and thus what&nbsp;<strong>contingencies could\
  \ be made</strong>.</p>\n      <p>This product contains a&nbsp;<strong>handful of\
  \ player options for each scenario</strong>. While there is a primary focus on the\
  \ fallout for followers of each god, there are options for many types of players.\
  \ The&nbsp;<strong>centerpiece is the&nbsp;</strong><em>return to service&nbsp;</em><strong>ritual</strong>&nbsp;and\
  \ how&nbsp;<strong>each gods death leads to which potential successor gods</strong>,\
  \ what that new relationship looks like, and providing potential benefits.</p>\n\

  \ provides players and GMs alike with everything they need to make this vibrant\
  \ ancestry of shape shifting fox folk feel at home in the Age of Lost Omens. Based\

  \ swaggering Rogue, or a Druid with a will of Steel, you will find myriad options\

  \   <p>Many consider magic a fickle force commanded only by experts, adventurers,\
  \ and otherworldly beings. But certain powers can be conjured by anyone with the\
  \ time, skill, and determination to do so—provided you know the right words and\

  \ above the Universe within the Inner Sphere, but a person could stumble into portals\
  \ across Golarion. The planes are out of reach, but walk among us. Geniekin are\
  \ striking, and kineticists flash, but there are many others with subtler connection.</p>\n\

  \ is an attempt to catalog and describe all of the many and varied creatures that\
  \ we share the galaxy with. We understand that with millions of stars and billions\
  \ of worlds – plus those that visit the galaxy from other planes – this is a nearly\
  \ impossible endeavor. But if we do not try it, then we can never succeed. This\
  \ is but one small excerpt of the greater Monstercology Galatica, focusing on creatures\
  \ most often seen during the later parts of the year.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3><a\

  >Space Cowboy’s Arsenal</a>*</h3>\n      <p>A certain type of adventurer resides\
  \ in the vast frontiers of space—wayfarers and drifters, hunters whose next meal\
  \ rides on their cunning, their aim, and the price on their bounty's head. They\
  \ carve out their existence beyond the fringes of civilization; the easy life is\
  \ as alien to them as another man's gun, and just as fickle. They prefer the unpredictable\
  \ and uncharted, far from prying eyes and folks what ask too many questions. Never\
  \ tied to one place, these vagabonds stay strange and savvy, doing what they can\
  \ to keep alive. When the galaxy needs a job done, they call for the rough and tumble\
  \ Space Cowboy.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3><a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/377149/Starfinder-Infinite-Mech-Threat-Manual?affiliate_id=2791261\"\

  \ Infinite: Mech Threat Manual</em>! Inside, you’ll find a spread of the latest\
  \ mech creations of the Outer Sphere, deadly carnivorous mechform mimics, oozes\
  \ that can slip inside a mech to throttle the operator or take over the machine\
  \ entirely, and more. This book provides a variety of themed threats for use in\
  \ mech combat at all levels of play, and all mechs within were made in accordance\
  \ with the recommended alternative rules for creating NPC mechs from&nbsp;<em>Starfinder:\

  \ is a grab-bag of useful content, including a rich cast of characters, a highly\
  \ detailed location, a web of story threads and more. Follow the journey of&nbsp;Director\
  \ Rehala Ito Fyndiir&nbsp;as he attempts to open an ancient safe constructed of\
  \ the potent starmetal horacalcum, which bends time around it. See the settlement\
  \ that sprung up around his obsessive project and drew experts, infiltrators and\
  \ honest civilians from all corners of the Pact Worlds. Discover the hidden secrets\
  \ and lives of more than half a dozen fully fleshed-out characters… or break all\
  \ of the above up into pieces and use them in your own campaign! An adventure toolbox\
  \ is designed to be easily changed to fit any level, and modular enough that story\
  \ threads, characters and locations become a resource that can be repurposed, redesigned\
  \ and re-themed to your heart’s content.&nbsp;</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>New &amp;\
