  \ class=\"date\">Friday, May 15, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n\
  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">We're getting closer and closer to the June release\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>, the latest, greatest\
  \ set of prepainted plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ miniatures from our friends at WizKids! By my count, we've revealed nearly the\
  \ entire set so far, but I've been holding off on two figures in particular, waiting\
  \ for the right time to show them off. Lots of folks have been asking if <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> will have any iconic characters,\
  \ now that we're also releasing those characters in the form of the spectacularly\
  \ detailed <a href=\"\">Iconic Heroes Base Sets</a>. The answer, my friends, is\
  \ a resounding YES, and this set's iconic hero rounds out the ranks of the iconic\
  \ characters we featured in our second class-centered RPG release, the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8fo1\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</em></a>.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I speak, of course of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfnj\">Balazar</a>\
  \ the summoner and his beloved \"pet,\" the otherworldly eidolon Padrig!</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-BalazarPadrig.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-BalazarPadrig_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Let's take a closer look at Balazar, Gnome Summoner.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-Balazar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-Balazar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Balazar's sculpt captures him mid-spell, or perhaps\
  \ directing the actions of his eidolon from afar. While the sculpt is similar to\
  \ Balazar's appearance in the just-released <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\">Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set 3</a>, here the colors are somewhat brighter, and if I'm being honest\
  \ I think I like this version of Balazar just a little bit more than the Iconic\
  \ Heroes version, which is a bit darker. Balazar is, as I mentioned, the final iconic\
  \ character of the original 17 to appear as a prepainted miniature in one of the\
  \ random <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets. While the stand-alone\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/miniatures/battles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> boxes\
  \ will delve further into the ranks of iconic heroes from the <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</em></a> (and possibly beyond), Balazar\
  \ is also the last iconic character to show up in the regular <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> line, at least for the next set, which contains none.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So let's take a moment to celebrate our tour through the iconic characters\
  \ of our first two major hardcover rulebook releases. We knew we'd get to you eventually,\
  \ little guy! Balazar, Gnome Summoner is a Small, rare figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-PadrigFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-PadrigFront_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150515-PadrigBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Balazar is just a wee gnome without his best buddy\
  \ Padrig, who in <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> is called\
  \ simply \"Eidolon.\" The Eidolon represents a class feature with lots of variability,\
  \ so it's probably fitting that Padrig is a weird snake/chicken hybrid. He'll see\
  \ plenty of table use for folks playing the Balazar pregenerated character in the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> organized\
  \ play program, but I'm also hoping he gets use as a generic eidolon figure, or\
  \ just as a weird monster used to throw off players who think they have every Bestiary\
  \ memorized.</p> \n     <p>The sculpt here is a bit meatier than the Padrig figure\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\">Iconic Heroes Set 3</a>. Check out the back\
  \ view to see Padrig's snake body fading away into clear plastic, taking a cue from\
  \ his original Wayne Reynolds illustration. The figure twists and turns with some\
  \ real dynamism, and it's growing on me even more as I sit and look at it now. Yes,\
  \ he's a weirdo, but he's a fun weirdo. The Eidolon is a rare, Medium figure.</p>\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I leave you this week with a look at Balazar and his\
  \ Eidolon as they face off against the vicious <a href=\"/products/btpy9bep\">Gargantuan\
  \ Red Dragon Case Incentive</a> figure from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a> set.</p> \n     <p>Don't forget to order our most recent Iconic\
  \ Heroes boxed sets: <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\">Iconic Heroes Set 1</a>, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy98sx\">Iconic Heroes Set 2</a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"\
  >Iconic Heroes Set 3</a>, all of which are shipping now to paizo.com customers.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Better yet, <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">set up a Pathfinder Battles\
  \ Ongoing Case Subscription</a> to unlock a whopping 30% discount on Iconic Heroes\
  \ box purchases (the discount for new subscribers goes into effect only after your\
  \ first case ships next month). Existing subscribers should also consider ordering\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/miniatures/battles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a>\
  \ sets soon, as they've proven to be very popular and they will not last forever!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There will be no Pathfinder Battles preview blog next week, as we'll\
  \ all be rolling dice and hanging out with fellow gamers at <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon 2015</a>! I'm going to try to have the entire Dungeons Deep set on display\
  \ in the Paizo store at the convention, so swing by there to see these awesome figures\
  \ in person.</p> \n     <p>I'd also like to remind all PaizoCon attendees that I\
  \ host an annual Miniatures Trading Afterparty in the hotel bar following the formal\
  \ close of the show. I'll have a bunch of Pathfinder Battles figures for trade,\
  \ as well as remnants from my own personal miniatures collection that I'm looking\
  \ to unload. We've been doing this event for something like 6 years now, and it's\
  \ always a highlight of the show. Bring any minis (painted preferred, but there's\
  \ a market in unpainted figures too) you don't want and trade them with other gamers\
  \ for figures you do. It's awesome, and I'll see you there!</p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ then, I remain,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div>\
