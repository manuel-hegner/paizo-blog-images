  \             <blockquote>\n              <p itemprop=\"description\">“We can do\
  \ it.”</p>\n              <p>The words reverberated through the cramped but well-furnished\
  \ captain’s cabin of the <em>Glorious Payoff</em>. Eando Kline, leader of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society’s Vigilant Seal, spoke excitedly and with conviction. “With the Seal deployed\
  \ to prevent any fey forces from moving up from the south, the rest of the factions\
  \ should be able to overwhelm the forces nearest to the portal. We can open the\
  \ door, claim or seal whatever’s inside, and then beat an orderly retreat while\
  \ they’re still reeling from the first assault!”</p>\n              <p>As the famed\
  \ Pathfinder slapped a hand down on the table to emphasize his point, Fola Barun—\
  a tall Ekujae elf skimming through the pile of scrolls at the far end of the table—\
  raised a doubtful eyebrow and cleared her throat, the quiet noise and simple gesture\
  \ readily commanding the attention of her peers.</p>\n              <p>“And what\
  \ if it doesn’t go as smoothly as you say? Shall we trust that fate and fey magic\
  \ shall both play out as we expect and gamble with the lives of those who have put\
  \ their faith in us? I am not interested in a plan that involves the loss of scores\
  \ of Pathfinder lives as one of its potential outcomes.”</p>\n              <p>Fola’\
  s eyes drifted back to the scrolls in front of her, though the other Pathfinder\
  \ strategists knew she was still acutely aware of the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“That’s where we come in,\" interjected the tightly-muscled half-orc\
  \ woman perched on the table’s edge, former pirate and current leader of the Horizon\
  \ Hunters, Calisro Benarry. “I’ve got a few of my hunters scouting the eastern ridgeline\
  \ here, where the trees thin out; they’ll signal us if it looks like anything is\
  \ about to go awry.”</p>\n              <p>As she leaned over the table, her keen\
  \ eyes darted across the map, double-checking the markers and flags that indicated\
  \ the positions of the various Pathfinder forces, as well as the locations of the\
  \ myriad pockets of fey monsters infesting the area. She raised her glance to the\
  \ last of her companions. “Anything to add, Gorm?”</p>\n              <p>“Oh, I\
  \ suspect that we’ve got it well in hand.” The metal clasps in the dwarf’s braids\
  \ jingled as he tilted his head, quietly assessing the map. “I’ve got the best bards,\
  \ wizards, and clerics the Grand Archive has in its ranks spread throughout our\
  \ deployed teams. If things get ugly, they’ll make sure to provide the magical support\
  \ we need for a clean escape, and they’ve gone over every record we have of the\
  \ area. Hopefully that will keep surprises to a minimum, and if we don’t see something\
  \ coming, they’ll have the best chance we can hope for to make the right decisions\
  \ and adapt.”</p>\n              <p>Eando looked around the room again, meeting\
  \ the eyes of each of his fellow Pathfinders in turn. “We’re agreed then? It’s time\
  \ to march?”</p>\n              <p>One by one, the others nodded their heads. Without\
  \ further discussion, each left to take command of the Society agents assigned to\
  \ their teams.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a\

  \  </div>\n              <p>Eando emerged from the cabin first, leaping onto the\
  \ back of a waiting hippogriff that would ferry him to shore before it and its rider\
  \ resumed their aerial scouting duties. Gorm muttered a few quick words and flicked\
  \ his fingers in a rhythmic motion, his body slowly fading away in a cloud of glimmering\
  \ lights. Fola left captain’s quarters turned perpendicular to the ship’s rail,\
  \ striding toward the edge as though she were unaware the deck ended only feet in\
  \ front of her. Casually, she stepped over the ship’s railing as a calm ocean wave\
  \ crested to meet her foot, bearing her weight as sturdily as the deck had, and\
  \ whisked her away to the nearby shoreline.</p>\n              <p>Calisro knew her\
  \ place was aboard her ship, and she had no intention of abandoning her as the others\
  \ had. Donning her tricorn hat, she left the briefing room, quietly shutting and\
  \ locking the door behind her before she climbed to the deck to stand beside the\
  \ helmsman.</p>\n              <p>“Hard to starboard!” Calisro cried, her powerful\
  \ voice cutting over the ocean waves and silencing the chatter of her crew. “Ready\
  \ the catapults! We’re going to start this thing off by doing what we do best! And\
  \ what is that?”</p>\n              <p>With her final question, the sailors scurrying\
  \ about the deck paused just long enough to yell, “blow something up,” before resuming\
  \ their tasks. As the ship came about, its port armaments lined up to the shore,\
  \ Calisro raised a small whistle to her lips and blew. Though no audible sound emerged,\
  \ Calisro knew that her compatriots on land would receive the signal.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>She needed wait only a moment before her expectation was proven accurate.\
  \ On the nearby shore, a team of Pathfinders burst from behind a veil of magical\
  \ invisibility, hurling jars of alchemical fire at what looked like a clump of old\
  \ and gnarled baobab trees. A mere second later, the trees burst to terrifying life,\
  \ uprooting themselves and charging toward the attacking Pathfinders.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>“FIRE!” At Calisro’s scream, her bombardiers unleashed their deadly\
  \ barrage, sending whistling orbs of magically augmented metal arcing first through\
  \ the ocean breeze, and then the wooden bodies of the singed arboreal guardians.\
  \ The captain took in the destruction, and the efficiency with which the Glorious\
  \ Payoff’s crew had brought it upon the Society’s enemies. A slow smirk curled the\
  \ her lips as she turned to issue more orders. “So far, so good!”</p>\n        \
  \      <center>\n               <hr width=\"50%\">\n              </center>\n  \
  \            <br>\n              <p>Deep in the coastal jungle, Eando fought a desperate\
  \ battle against a pair of redcaps. The twisted little fey looked like caricatures\
  \ of muscular gnomes, each wielding a scythe with a three-and-a-half-foot long blade.\
  \ As the first swing came at his left flank, Eando quickly tossed his sword from\
  \ his right hand to his left to deflect the blow high.</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ second redcap stepped in and swung low from the right, hoping to separate the\
  \ Pathfinder from his legs while he was distracted. No novice to battle, Eando used\
  \ the momentum from his initial block to his advantage, letting the force of the\
  \ first redcap’s blow carry him into a twisting somersault over the second attacker’\
  s whistling blade. Turning his body nearly parallel to the ground, Eando flipped\
  \ his sword back to his right hand, catching the hilt midway through a forward thrust.\
  \ The blade parted the second redcap’s filthy beard and emerged an instant later\
  \ from the back of its neck, silencing the murderous fey’s cackle with a staccato\
  \ gurgle.</p>\n              <p>Completing his somersault and landing in a three-point\
  \ stance, Eando kept his left hand on the ground for balance as his right swept\
  \ back around in a second attack. Even as the remaining redcap raised its scythe\
  \ to block, Eando switched sword hands once more, springing forward from his crouched\
  \ position as he caught the blade in a left-handed grip.</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ redcap’s eyes, still looking where the blade had been just a second before, widened\
  \ in surprise before turning down to see Eando already withdrawing the length of\
  \ the blade from the fey’s chest.</p>\n              <p>Without a hint of hesitation\
  \ or fatigue, Eando flicked the blood clear of his blade and dashed further into\
  \ the woods, yelling to draw an angry dryad’s attention away from a beleaguered\
  \ group of Pathfinders wrapped in clinging vines.</p>\n              <center>\n\
  \               <hr width=\"50%\">\n              </center>\n              <br>\n\
  \              <p>Mere yards from the site of Eando’s incredible feat of swordsmanship\
  \ and agility, Gorm stood ready under the shroud of invisibility. He chuckled in\
  \ quiet amazement, dropping his hands and dismissing the magical energy he had been\
  \ holding to blast a redcap with darts of magical force had Kline needed aid. The\
  \ dwarf moved deeper into the jungle, following the sounds of battle.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>It didn’t take long for Gorm to find Fola Barun, the shaman’s hands\
  \ raised in the air, magically commanding the jungle’s fauna. A bramble of thorny\
  \ vines whipped through ranks of surprisingly fearsome pixies while ancient ferns\
  \ raised their wide fronds to deflect bursts of magical water launched by naiads\
  \ away from the Pathfinder forces.</p>\n              <p>Gorm quickly unslung his\
  \ harp and began playing a tune he’d written himself some years back, a lullaby\
  \ he thought to call <em>Sleep of the Petal Maidens</em>. Hearing the ensorcelled\
  \ notes through the din of combat, the pixies and naiads began to nod and blink\
  \ drowsily; the distraction wasn’t enough to lull the fey to sleep, but it did slow\
  \ them just long enough for Fola to shred the nearest of them with her magically\
  \ controlled vines and send the others scurrying into the forest.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>“Well done!” Gorm cried, dismissing his invisibility and stepping up beside\
  \ Fola. A moment later, Eando emerged from the nearby trees, smiling roguishly and\
  \ brushing what looked like sawdust off his sleeve. Other parties of Pathfinders\
  \ joined them, and soon the small expeditionary army was almost completely assembled.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Now the hard part,” Eando said gazing into the jungle depths\
  \ ahead. “A long march through trackless jungle toward an enemy who knows we’re\
  \ coming, armies of fey hidden in every valley and copse of trees between us and\
  \ our destination, and then we just need to open a magical door no one’s ever opened\
  \ and hope whatever’s inside doesn’t kill us all.”</p>\n              <p>“You’re\
  \ absolutely right,” Gorm replied. “I <em>do</em> so love being a Pathfinder!”</p>\n\
