  \ by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>Yoon always loved fire—the warmth,\
  \ the color, the brilliant blaze. Fire always changed, and changed everything around\
  \ it. Yoon could empathize. Fire was also always hungry—Yoon could empathize with\
  \ that, too, as her family were immigrants in Minkai, and struggled to support themselves.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Not long after Yoon learned to walk, she learned to climb, and\
  \ immediately took a shining to the rooftops of Oda. Her father only brought her\
  \ to the city for the big festivals, and she wanted the best view to watch the fireworks\
  \ celebrating the Lady of the North Star. Once, when she was climbing, Yoon fell,\
  \ dropping into the river, and her father had to fish her out. Yoon coughed up a\
  \ seemingly endless stream of water, and her grandmother scolded her, saying it\
  \ would have been far worse if Yoon had hit the ground. </p> \n      <p>Yoon wasn't\
  \ so sure. Just as fire had always been her friend, water had always been her enemy.\
  \ All her life, it had taken her mother away on ships, for weeks or months at a\
  \ time. And in the end, it refused to give her back.</p> \n      <p>Yoon's mother\
  \ had been a brave warrior and explorer, and had told Yoon many fantastic tales\
  \ of adventure and faraway places, primarily in the savage lands to the north. She\
  \ also brought Yoon things, like the stuffed bear-owl creature named Gom-Gom, or\
  \ the crooked stick used to play a strange northern game. Yet one day, her mother\
  \ failed to return. Yoon and her father waited, growing more anxious as each week.\
  \ When at last a messenger arrived and confirmed her mother's death battling siyokoys,\
  \ a grief-stricken Yoon decided that no one else would ever call her by the same\
  \ name her mother had. Forsaking her old name, she insisted on being referred to\
  \ only by her mother's family name, the one her mother's adventuring companions\
  \ had called her—Yoon.</p> \n      <p>Gom-Gom was the first to accept Yoon's new\
  \ name. Eventually, even her grandmother gave in, though she continued to sniff\
  \ at the impropriety. Yoon's grandmother had been a palace servant to the Shojinawa\
  \ family once, and despite the fact that Yoon was determined to become a warrior\
  \ like her mother, the old woman insisted on teaching her about things like poise,\
  \ discipline, and self-control, arguing that they were just as important to a warrior\
  \ as to a court scholar. Yoon didn't quite believe that, but did her best anyway,\
  \ proving a quick and capable student. </p> \n      <p>Yoon's father fared worse.\
  \ Still a loving, caring parent, he grew distant and sad after his wife's death,\
  \ and spent more time muttering about things like imperial taxes and yakuza corruption.\
  \ The new friends he made were constantly grouchy, and Yoon came to think of them\
  \ privately as his Bitter Friends. They spent long evenings drinking and arguing\
  \ in low voices, always careful to keep the windows closed and doors locked, even\
  \ in the worst summer heat. </p> \n      <p>One night, as Yoon was once more watching\
  \ fireworks in honor of the Lady of the North Star, her father went off to meet\
  \ those friends. Yet even as the colored stars burst overhead, a new light blazed\
  \ up to the east—a burning warehouse! Yoon went to watch the citizens fight the\
  \ fire, but when she arrived, she found the place surrounded by imperial soldiers.\
  \ Not only were they not helping put out the blaze, they were actively preventing\
  \ those inside from fleeing. An uncomprehending Yoon wept to hear their cries, plugging\
  \ her ears against the crunch of tetsubos on bone as the soldiers beat back burning\
  \ men and women and their captain issued a proclamation about the punishment of\
  \ Hwan rebels. </p> \n      <p>That's when Yoon saw her father.</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ was in a knot of his Bitter Friends, blackened with ash, struggling to break through\
  \ the ranks of soldiers. Even as Yoon called his name, she saw him fall beneath\
  \ the soldiers' blows.</p> \n      <p>Screaming, Yoon raced for the line of soldiers.\
  \ She might have gone unnoticed in the din, if not for the flaming board she scooped\
  \ up and hurled at one of the soldiers, striking him in the helmet. As the man crumpled\
  \ to the ground, several of his companions turned toward her. Yet as they advanced,\
  \ truncheons raised, Yoon found her view suddenly blocked by her grandmother, wreathed\
  \ in a snaking cloud of eerie black flames.</p> \n      <p>\"Run, child!\" the woman\
  \ commanded. \"If you listen to me only once in your life, run now, and don't come\
  \ back!\"</p> \n      <p>Yoon ran—through the city, out the gates, and into the\
  \ surrounding fields. Only when she could run no farther did she finally collapse,\
  \ exhausted, into the grass, listening to the night breeze and the song of insects.\
  \ Behind her, the fireworks still continued, but the brilliant lines and stars no\
  \ longer held Yoon's attention. As she held up a hand, little flickers of black\
  \ flame flared into life around it. Her own tiny fireworks.</p> \n      <p>Her grandmother\
  \ had commanded her to leave. Yoon understood that. She had struck a soldier, and\
  \ no one harmed an imperial soldier and lived. But where should she go? She had\
  \ always wanted to see Hwanggot, her family's homeland, but it lay across the water\
  \ to the southwest, and there was no way Yoon was crossing that much water. In a\
  \ sudden flash of inspiration, she decided to head north, up through the Forest\
  \ of Spirits, then down along the mainland. She would be an explorer, like her mother.\
  \ And she wouldn't have to be scared. After all, she still had her two oldest friends—\
  Gom-Gom and fire. Between the two of them, they'd protect her.</p> \n      <p>Yet\
  \ while a stuffed animal and a magical flame can handle a lot of problems, they\
  \ weren't truly equipped to handle all Yoon's needs, and she might well have starved\
  \ to death in the ensuing days and weeks if she hadn't fallen in with a mysterious\
  \ traveler. Seemingly waiting for Yoon at a crossroads, the man spoke to Yoon of\
  \ her powers, helping her come to understand them even as he taught her to scavenge\
  \ and forage for food. Yet his greatest gift came on the slopes of the great volcano\
  \ Kumijinja, where he called forth the spirits of the mountain's fire, presenting\
  \ Yoon to them like a visiting dignitary. As the kami touched her, Yoon felt something\
  \ inside her shift, and the flames that roiled inside her emerged, turning from\
  \ black to a brilliant red. In that instant, she understood the fire she carried,\
  \ and it understood her. When she woke from her trance-like reverie, the traveler\
  \ was gone, leaving Yoon to continue her journeys alone—a child in age, yet armed\
  \ with the courage of her mother, and the fiery wisdom of the mountain.</p> \n \
