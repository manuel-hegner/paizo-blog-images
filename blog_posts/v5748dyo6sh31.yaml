  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">New year, new stories! January\
  \ brings us further into the ongoing Year of a Thousand Bites with a standalone\
  \ (and pretty spooky) Tier 1-4 scenario and a Tier 5-8 scenario that takes us back\
  \ to a planet we haven’t visited since early in Starfinder Society’s inaugural year.\
  \ Let’s take a peek at what’s in store...</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022lc?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-215-The-Infernal-Gallery\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-15: The Infernal Gallery</a> is a Tier 1-4 scenario written\
  \ by Jessica Catalan. In a series of freak initially coincidences, this scenario\
  \ imitated a lot of the beats that were present in the first assignment I ever had\
  \ for Paizo: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8g53\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ #1-55: The Infernal Vault</a>. Beyond the obvious name homage, The Infernal Gallery\
  \ is also written by a fellow Canadian from Winnipeg (something I hadn’t realized\
  \ when assigning—it’s a small world). This scenario is a stand-alone mission that\
  \ has the PCs following up on a mysterious discovery in the Drift that eventually\
  \ leads into a rather diabolic affair. It even includes another sneaky homage to\
  \ an organization I first created way back in the early days of Pathfinder Society,\
  \ re-envisioned for Starfinder. All in all, Jessica did an amazing job writing this\
  \ scenario, as did Linda Zayas-Palmer in developing it.</p> \n     <p>Seriously,\
  \ just look at this creepy art!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Speaking of going back to old (but way more recent) memories,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022ld?Starfinder-Scenario-216-A-Scoured-Home\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-16: A Scoured Home</a> sees the return of the izlaguuns at\
  \ the skilled hands of Christopher Wasko. This scenario has the PCs travelling to\
  \ the world of Icefront (or Izalraan, as the locals prefer to call it) after the\
  \ events of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zjw?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-113-On-the-Trail-of-History\"\
  >Starfinder Society #1-13: On the Trail of History</a>, in order to retrieve much\
  \ needed medical supplies for Pact Worlds colonies out in Near Space and the Vast.\
  \ Of course, the PCs aren’t just going to wait around for those supplies, and izalguun\
  \ elder Naarma requests some assistance in fixing a buried izalguun starship that\
  \ seems to be leaking radiation. I’m sure nothing bad will happen on this mission.\
  \ Nope, not one thing. It should be a cakewalk. Though, I’m not sure why it would\
  \ be of interest to former First Seeker Jadnura?</p> \n     <p>Luckily, this time\
  \ some of the PCs might just be playing izalguun characters, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgs1?Starfinder-Society-Ethical-Anthropology\"\
  >as first made a legal playable choice in this blog</a>!</p> \n     <p>When I pitched\
  \ this scenario, Creative Director, Rob McCreary, requested that we include an izalguun\
  \ robot. So, here’s me fulfilling that promise! Now if only he’ll fulfill his pledge\
  \ to write me a scenario...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/012220_IzalguunDefenseRobot.jpg\"\

  \ As I get ready to take a small, and much needed vacation, I’m in the midst of\
  \ finishing off our February offerings, which include some further follow-up on\
  \ why the Society needs medicinals, as well as another return mission to a popular\
  \ aquatic world where we might have seen our first playable Starfinder Society species\
  \ emerge from...</p> \n     <p>If you missed the earlier Organized Play blog, which\

  \ and a preview of Pathfinder Society offerings for January, you can find them <a\
