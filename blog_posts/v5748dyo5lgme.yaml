  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Ahoy, me\
  \ hearties! It seems like only yesterday that I wrote a blog for you, but here I\
  \ am again. In actuality it was three weeks ago, but I have an incredibly bad concept\
  \ of time that has passed so I had to check. And if you don't believe me, you can\
  \ check <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgjd\">here</a>.</p> \n    <p>Anyway, we're\
  \ nearly on to <a href=\"/products/btpy965x\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—\
  Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Deck 3: Tempest Rising</i></a>! We're zipping through\
  \ these adventures faster than a flying fish on uppers. As usual, I'll be sharing\
  \ some of my favorite cards and giving you the inside scoop on one of our scenarios.\
  \ But first, I must apologize. If I seem a little distracted to you, it's because\
  \ I am. Somehow, a gigantic fly has gotten into my house and is buzzing around me.\
  \ Every time I get focused, this fly dive bombs me and I flail around trying to\
  \ bat it out of the air like some sort of drunk cat. And sometimes I drop my laptop.\
  \ Le sigh. But this is what I go through to get you some insider info on Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles. You may be thinking that it would just be better for me to head to a\
  \ coffee shop down the street but that would be LETTING THAT BUZZY LITTLE JERK WIN.\
  \ And that, I simply can't stand.</p> \n    <p>On to a happier place... sharks.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>OSS (Obligatory Shark Section)</h2> \n    <p>Dun... dun.</p> \n    <p>Dun...\
  \ dun.</p> \n    <p>Dun dun dundundun. That's right, you scallywags, we've got a\
  \ great white shark.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-GreatWhite.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-GreatWhite_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It might be easier on everyone if you just gave up now. This\
  \ won't be getting any easier.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>It make look like some blood\
  \ vapors are escaping his mouth but I think he's been smoking some sort of weird\
  \ hookah with red smoke. It's definitely not blood. Because the Great White Shark\
  \ would never hurt you. Unless you encounter him. Which you will because you can't\
  \ evade him. Wah wah. It's hard to be you, isn't it?</p> \n    <h2>Some Other Totally\
  \ Rad Stuff</h2> \n    <p>The Great White Shark is as great as his name says, but\
  \ there are some cards whose names aren't quite so obvious.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Look at him in his stripey pants, Look at him! LOOK AT HIM!</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>You're in serious denial if you don't admit to loving this\
  \ Werecrocodile. You best hope the moon isn't out or ol' stripeypants is gonna take\
  \ a little bit more to defeat. But, seeing as how he's a reptile, he's a little\
  \ sensitive to the cold, and adding that trait to your check will help you a bit.\
  \ Unless somebody gets him some mittens and a hat. He'd look pretty great with those\
  \ though, right?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrocodileMittens.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrocodileMittens_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Right.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>This scenario also features\
  \ a new type of card. We call it a Curse but you'll likely give it a different name.\
  \ Probably a curse word. Aahahaha. But seriously. Don't get stuck with one of these.\
  \ I'm not going to say more about it because I think it pretty much speaks for itself.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Curse.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>This is not really what you want.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up\
  \ until now, Structural damage has sort of been a thing but it's been pretty manageable,\
  \ right? The days of manageable Structural damage are over. This adventure has a\
  \ lot of particularly nasty barriers that are all about the Structural damage. Take\
  \ for instance, the Cannonade.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Cannonade.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Cannonade_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>KABOOM!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Yes, dear readers, you read\
  \ that correctly. The Cannonade is a Veteran barrier and you're not getting away\
  \ without taking at least 2 Structural damage. That's not all, though! There are\
  \ several more barriers just as nasty as this one. And a couple are even henchmen\
  \ so you know you'll get to see them a bunch! Huzzah!</p> \n    <p>I admit, rubbing\
  \ your face in those barriers was a little mean. So, here. Take a look at this loot\
  \ blessing.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-PirateFavor.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-PirateFavor_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Monkey in a scarf alert!!!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>There's\
  \ something funny about those traits... what is it though? Oh right, it's our first\
  \ blessing without the Divine trait. That's pretty crazy! And you might be able\
  \ to play a second blessing on the check you use this on! And just look at all those\
  \ ways to recharge this thing! This blessing should rock your socks. And if you're\
  \ not wearing socks, put some on so you can have your socks rocked. For reals.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Bizarre Love Triangle</h2> \n    <p>It's a story as old as time. Boy\
  \ goes to grocery store. Girl goes to grocery store. They do their shopping, almost\
  \ bumping into each other multiple times, but always just missing until they both\
  \ reach for the same sea cucumber. Meet cute. Boy and Girl fall in love. Boy and\
  \ Girl get in a fight. Boy and Girl take a break. Boy meets Gal. Boy and Girl upgrade\
  \ break to break up. Boy gets house. Boy and Gal are happy. Boy ditches Gal to pursue\
  \ other interests. Girl hates Boy. Gal loves Boy. Boy is busy pursuing other interests.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I know, I know. Right now you're thinking, \"You silly goose in the rigging,\
  \ that doesn't really seem bizarre at all.\" You know what? You're right. Aside\
  \ from the fact that Boy, Girl, and Gal are all water nagas and \"pursuing other\
  \ interests\" actually means \"killing any people that cross his path,\" that story\
  \ is not bizarre in any way. </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n     <br> <i>Sorry, Shonda Rimes, this crazy drama is already taken.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>So. Let's get down to business. What actually happens in this\
  \ scenario? Well, if you'll note on the scenario card, there aren't real henchmen\
  \ in this scenario. We just have you shuffle some random monsters (even more chances\
  \ for Stripeypants to be encountered!) so closing locations will be a bit more challenging\
  \ than normal. Plus, you have to get these three crazy kids in the same place so\
  \ they can sort out their issues. That's right, this scenario is an intervention.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I can hear you scoffing through the internet, \"So what if we have to\
  \ burn through all the cards in a location deck and there are three villains? We're\
  \ rockstars at this game!\" Scoff no more, dear readers. Did you catch the part\
  \ on the scenario about how if the villain can't escape to an open location you\
  \ shuffle it into a random location and open it? I mean, obviously there's a strategy\
  \ on how to do that properly but that's up to you to figure out. There's also the\
  \ part where if all three villains aren't in the same location deck, you haven't\
  \ defeated the villain...no matter how good your roll was. Toodle-loo blessings\
  \ deck! It was nice knowing you!</p> \n    <p>We’ve sort of been ignoring our three\
  \ villains thus far and if there’s one thing I know about water nagas, it’s that\
  \ they hate to be ignored. Let’s start with Boy, or as you will come to know him,\
  \ Munarei. Munarei is probably smarter than you. He’s gonna deal you some Mental\
  \ damage before you even act and after that you’ll have to try and outsmart him.\
  \ I don’t know about you but I would rather punch Munarei rather than try to make\
  \ an Intelligence or Knowledge 10 check. But wait, there’s more! If your check isn't\
  \ at least a 7, the top card of your deck, you know, the one you’re just itching\
  \ to draw, well, that gets buried. Oof. Maybe Girl and Gal will be nicer.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Girl, AKA Sarlis, is a little peeved with Munarei. The good news is, this\
  \ means she’s sort of willing to accept your help to get back her lair. All it takes\
  \ is a Charisma or Diplomacy 10 check! I mean, she’s still going to deal you some\
  \ damage before you act (Force damage, to be accurate) and if you fail by 3 or more\
  \ you’re going to be burying that tasty top card of your deck. Hell hath no fury\
  \ like a water naga scorned.</p> \n    <p>And last, but not least, there’s Selissa,\
  \ who we’ve called Gal up until now. She’s still completely enamored with Munarei\
  \ for some reason. And you trying to fight her and herd her over to the same location\
  \ as the others is only distracting her from mooning over Munarei. So yeah, she’\
  s a little mad at you too. She’ll be slapping you with some Poison damage, and of\
  \ course, the top card of your deck is still quite vulnerable. But, after a Wisdom\
  \ or Survival 10 check, you’ll be sitting pretty (but not as pretty as Munarei!).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So, we've now given you a murdery, monster-filled soap opera to play\
  \ through. At the end you'll get a card feat, though. And we all know how deliciousssss\
  \ card featsss are. Umm, sorry. Been spending a little too much time trying to think\
  \ like a water naga. At any rate, I think you've got a pretty decent look at what's\
  \ heading your way in <a href=\"/products/btpy965x\">Adventure 3</a> and I only\
  \ dropped my laptop twice! As always, thanks for reading and here's hoping to a\
  \ mutiny-free month for you! </p>\n    <p>Gaby Weidling<br> <i>Adventure Card Game\
