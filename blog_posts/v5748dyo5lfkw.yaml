  >As the joy of Thanksgiving fades and the chill winds of winter creep in from the\
  \ far corners of the world, icy terrors shudder ever closer to your gaming table!\
  \ This week we take a break from the regularly scheduled previews of figures from\
  \ the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted\
  \ plastic figures to embrace the frigid winds with two titans of the tundra.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'm talking, of course, about February's <a href=\"/products/btpy922b\"\
  >Reign of Winter Monsters Encounter Pack</a>, a special two-pack featuring two Huge\
  \ figures sure to chill your player characters to the bone. Huge is a strange size\
  \ category for us—too large to fit into a regular set's standard booster box, and\
  \ too small to make for a truly satisfying case incentive (which we usually reserve\
  \ for Gargantuan figures). We have not produced any Huge figures for a regular set\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ since our second set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ but the Pathfinder RPG itself is actually loaded with them. We've squeezed Huge\
  \ dragons into the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\">White Dragon Evolution</a> and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\">Red Dragon Evolution</a> Encounter Packs, but there\
  \ are a lot more creatures that we'd like to do. </p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy922b\"\
  >Reign of Winter Monsters Encounter Pack</a> is the first of what I hope to be many\
  \ Encounter Packs featuring Huge figures, but of course time and your support will\
  \ be crucial to determining if we do more in the future (I've got my eye set on\
  \ a certain swampy creature folks have been demanding for ages, for example…). So\
  \ please do check these out. Your support for this Encounter Pack makes future similar\
  \ releases much more likely!</p> \n    <p>But enough from me. Let's check out the\
  \ figures!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71186-FrostWorm_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71186-FrostWorm_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our first creature is the immense Frost Worm, a freezing\
  \ foe that has never before been produced in prepainted plastic! With armor-crushing\
  \ jaws, flesh that radiates cold, and a terrible keening cry capable of holding\
  \ creatures fascinated, Frost Worms are apex predators of the frozen tundra. This\
  \ particular Frost Worm is absolutely enormous, and will land with a resounding\
  \ \"thump\" on your game table that is sure to have your adventurers shivering in\
  \ their boots. He was originally designed as the case incentive for the Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters set, and he's been patiently awaiting his moment ever since. I assure\
  \ you, everything about this figure is awesome. You are going to love him. (Incidentally,\
  \ his statistics appear on page 126 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 2</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71186-Svathurim_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71186-Svathurim_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This unusual beast is a Svathurim, one of the epic\
  \ climactic encounters in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a> (particularly <a href=\"/products/btpy8xbz\"\
  >Pathfinder #69: Maiden, Mother, Crone</a>). Ancient tales claim the first svathurims\
  \ spawned from the frost giant god Thremyr, and frost giant clans often revere these\
  \ enormous creatures as emissaries of the god himself. As you can see, the Svathurim\
  \ melds the upper body of a frost giant with the lower half of a giant eight-legged\
  \ horse reminiscent of Odin's horse Sleipnir. Basically, he's incredibly badass\
  \ and perhaps one of the best sculpts we've done so far in the Pathfinder Battles\
  \ line. The Svathurim is admittedly a bit of an odd choice, but when you see him\
  \ I'm fairly certain he'll warm even the coldest heart.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy922b\">Reign of Winter Monsters Encounter Pack</a> is set for a February\
  \ release!</p> \n    <p>We'll see you back here next week for another exciting <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> preview!</p>\
