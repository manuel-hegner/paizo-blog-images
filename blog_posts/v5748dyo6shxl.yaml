  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">For the\
  \ second time today, Ciravel found herself exceedingly grateful for seatbelts and\
  \ stabilizers.</p> \n      <p>The first moment of gratitude was during Iseph's dizzying,\
  \ looping, headlong dash toward Daimalko's surface—a flight where they showed both\
  \ their skill at threading the space between the enormous meteoroids that surrounded\
  \ the planet and their delight at making Ciravel shut her eyes despite herself.\
  \ Ciravel ran and reran the possibilities in her mind, certain that this was the\
  \ course that resulted in a safe arrival to a canyon on the planet's surface, and\
  \ yet she still found herself clutching her armrests and putting <em>just enough</em>\
  \ tension against the straps holding her in to make sure that they would, in fact,\
  \ hold. </p> \n      <p>The second moment came thanks to the radiation drake who\
  \ clamped its crystalline jaws around her hoverchair and shook its head back and\
  \ forth as if in virulent disagreement with Ciravel's very existence—an action which,\
  \ without the negation of the stabilizers, would be excruciating, since the surface\
  \ of this portion of Daimalko unexpectedly lacked many things, including plant life,\
  \ water, and, much to the chagrin of Ciravel's various joints, consistent gravity.\
  \ Iseph had anchored themself to one of the rocks which floated above the planet's\
  \ surface and was locked in combat with a second drake.</p> \n      <p>\"You could\
  \ have warned me—\"</p> \n      <p>\"—about the radiation? The drakes? The battlefield\
  \ ruins? The asteroids? Did you—oof!—notice the radiation buffers that you were\
  \ so reluctant to—ow!—pick up this morning? 'But I don't breathe!' Honestly—your\
  \ head would fall off if I didn't remind you to bring a wrench! YOU could have warned\
  \ me that you fly like a drunken moldstorm!\"</p> \n      <p>\"Can we discuss this\
  \ when we're not—\" Iseph ducked as their drake snapped its jaws shut, barely missing\
  \ the android and a sending a soft crystalline ring echoing through the canyon,\
  \ \"—about to be turned into scrapyard bits?\"</p> \n      <p>Ciravel closed her\
  \ eyes and focused her power, channeling it through her extended hand. The possibilities\
  \ for the drake's next action unfolded before her like cards laid out on a table.\
  \ She knew what she had to do.</p> \n      <p>\"Iseph, count to ten.\"</p> \n  \
  \    <p><em>Wait for it…</em></p> \n      <p>\"Ciravel, this hardly seems the ideal\
  \ time for numerical calculation—\"</p> \n      <p>Ciravel shifted her weight, angling\
  \ her chair slightly as the drake clamped its jaws higher, sending the pistol in\
  \ her side holster careening toward the rocky ruins below. One more good bite and\
  \ it would have her.</p> \n      <p>…Wait…</p> \n      <p>\"…Make that seven.\"\

  >Starfinder Galactic Magic</a></h3>\n      </div> \n      <p>The drake's jaws opened\
  \ momentarily as it repositioned its bite once more. In the precise moment where\
  \ the drake's gullet was perfectly aligned, Ciravel turned her thrusters on full-force—\
  right down the drake's throat. Its spine glowed with the intense blue flame before\
  \ it gasped in pain and tumbled to the ground, releasing Ciravel's chair. Moments\
  \ later, a rocky thud echoed through the canyon. </p> \n      <p><em>Thank goodness\
  \ for seat belts</em>, Ciravel thought once again as her chair careened wildly until\
  \ the thrusters reoriented it. </p> \n      <p>\"Three…two…\"</p> \n      <p>She\
  \ could see the drake's spine begin to glow again as it readied another beam. She\
  \ was too far away. She needed more time.</p> \n      <p>Ciravel blinked her eyes,\
  \ holding the battlefield in stasis as she bolted toward Iseph. </p> \n      <p>\"\
  …one.\"</p> \n      <p>Iseph startled slightly at the voice that was suddenly right\
  \ next to them. Ciravel grabbed the blaster pistol from Iseph's belt and winked.\
  \ She lifted her chair up and away from Iseph, aiming the pistol directly at the\
  \ drake, trying to catch its attention and spin it away from Iseph, exposing a heavily\
  \ wounded flank to their blade. The drake turned, lifting its wing, preparing to\
  \ follow Ciravel. This time, she looped time into a knot, immediately making the\
  \ drake forget her presence and leaving it distracted long enough for Iseph to drive\
  \ their searing blade directly into its wounded gut.</p> \n      <p>She knew it\
  \ would cost her later—the exhaustion from this last effort would be brutal—but\
  \ Ciravel dug deep and twisted time once more, calibrating the trajectory and moment\
  \ that Iseph's blade entered the drake's thorax, ensuring that it hit every vital\
  \ organ it could on the way in. The drake collapsed and tumbled to the ground below.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"My pistol?\" Iseph outstretched their arm.</p> \n      <p>\"Ah, the\
  \ 'thanks for saving my circuits, Ciravel' must be a different time thread…\" Ciravel\
  \ maneuvered back toward the rock where Iseph had themselves anchored and winced\
  \ slightly in pain as she handed back the weapon, stretching her neck. \"I think\
  \ maybe <em>I'll</em> drive home? But let's get our repairs done quickly…I'm sure\
  \ the Recollectors aren't too far behind us, if they aren't already here.\" </p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Ciravel, perhaps we have sailed the canal that was left.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"The <em>left</em> canal, Iseph. The saying is that you've sailed down\
  \ the <em>right</em> canal when things go to plan, or the <em>left</em> canal when\
  \ you cannot locate what you need. But yes, it certainly looks like we might have\
  \ sailed quite far down the left canal, unfortunately.\"</p> \n      <center>\n\
  \       <hr width=\"50%\">\n      </center> \n      <p>She reached into one of the\
  \ bags attached to the side of her hoverchair and pulled out a handle—which extended\
  \ into a cane with a press of a button—and a tool kit, then released the safety\
  \ belts attaching her to the chair. Activating the grav anchors on her boots and\
  \ retracting the stabilizers, Ciravel stepped onto the hovering rock, and, leaning\
  \ heavily on her cane, surveyed the damage to the chair. <em>Not too bad, considering\
  \ the jaws</em>… </p> \n      <p>Iseph pulled a medical kit from a belt pouch and\
  \ began doing their own repairs to patch up their wounds—a cut here, a re-soldered\
  \ circuit there. As Ciravel tightened bolts and reattached anything that had come\
  \ loose from her chair in the fight, something gnawed at the back of her mind, but\
  \ she brushed it away. The Recollectors were on their trail and they hadn't found\
  \ any real clues to the cause of The Awakening, the cataclysm that decimated life\
  \ on Daimalko. No hint to whether it was a natural event or an apocalyptic weapon\
  \ used in the bitter war that used to rage on the planet. All Ciravel knew was that\
  \ when she last held a fragment of rock that originated here, a specimen back in\
  \ the xenobiology lab in Sovyrian, she tasted time—the only way she could describe\
  \ the strange way that she suddenly smelled salt and citrus and tasted spiced honey\
  \ whenever she encountered items from far in the past—a strange sensory activation\
  \ that tied to her only childhood memory. A memory from the Gap. </p> \n      <p>There\
  \ hadn't been a whiff of anything other than sulfur and ozone since they arrived\
  \ on Daimalko. But the way that rock had hummed in her ears…the song she had heard…\
  what she'd heard…<em>what didn't I hear?</em></p> \n      <p>\"…Iseph, did you hear\
  \ the impact of the second drake landing in the canyon?\"</p> \n      <p>\"An impact?\
  \ No…I heard an echo of jaws clashing and ringing, your weapon falling, the flames\
  \ of your chair, the pistol firing, the screams…everything echoed back. But I did\
  \ not hear a second impact of a drake on the canyon floor.\"</p> \n      <p>In that\
  \ moment, time unfolded for Ciravel as she registered three things. First: the air,\
  \ which had reeked only of sulfur and centuries of decay, suddenly smelled of salt\
  \ and citrus. The smell of Time, of the Gap. Second: the sudden darkness that fell\
  \ when it had, only moments before, been glaringly bright. Night should have been\
  \ nearly 30 hours away. And finally: the meaning of the absent sound of the drake's\
  \ impact. Ciravel ran through the possibilities in a split second, and realization\
  \ made her eyes go wide. </p> \n      <p>\"Um…Iseph?\"</p> \n      <p>\"When I have\
  \ finished repairing, Ciravel, I will assist you. It is already nightfall? We cannot\
  \ waste our time tonight.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Iseph…look up. We'll make some extra\
  \ time.\"</p> \n      <p>The android glanced up from the wire they were reconnecting\
  \ and then continued looking up, and up, and up the exoskeleton, watching in near-wonder\
  \ as tendrils passed the drake corpse up…and up…and up…far higher than Ciravel's\
  \ chair could reach on a day when it <em>hadn't</em> been rattled around in the\
  \ jaws of a drake, past gargantuan claws and tusks.</p> \n      <p>As her own eyes\
  \ met the four beady ones of the Kyokor, Ciravel tasted spiced honey.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>She stared at the colossus, steadied herself back into her hoverchair, and\
  \ activated the thrusters. She glided next to Iseph and looked over at them from\
  \ beneath the creature's shadow, smiling.</p> \n      <p>\"Well, what do you know?\
  \ Perhaps we sailed the right canal after all.\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n   \
