  \  </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Now that the dust\
  \ of battle has cleared and all your survey responses are in, we can examine the\
  \ intel you’ve given us to help refine and perfect the <strong>commander</strong>\
  \ and <strong>guardian</strong> classes. We appreciate all your feedback, and while\
  \ we’re still sifting through the more detailed notes, we can give you some quick\
  \ insights into some ways we’ll be moving forward.</p>\n      <p>First, Michael\
  \ Sayre will talk about the commander, and then Jason Keeley will fill us in on\
  \ the guardian.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>The Commander</h3>\n      <p>Michael\
  \ Sayre here, talking about where we might be headed with the commander class post-playtest.</p>\n\
  \      <p>One of the big things we saw in the playtest feedback was that by and\
  \ large, people were really happy with the class as it stands. When we see numbers\
  \ like this, one of the takeaways is that we want to focus on polishing what we’\
  ve got rather than taking apart something that people are already really enjoying.</p>\n\
  \      <p>With that in mind, there’s a few things I think we’re highly likely to\
  \ be doing going forward.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Tactics:</strong>\
  \ A big thing we want to do, obviously, is adding a bunch more tactics, especially\
  \ in the expert, master, and legendary tiers. For the playtest, we had two tactics\
  \ to choose from at each of these tiers, and we’re looking to increase that number\
  \ significantly. With more tactics to choose from, we have room to expand the number\
  \ of tactics the commander can have in their folio, and we can look at giving them\
  \ a slight bump to the number of tactics they can have prepared. In addition to\
  \ modifying the number of tactics available (both while building your commander\
  \ and while playing them), we’re looking at some adjustments to the tactics themselves.\
  \ In particular, making the master tactics all function on a once-per-10-minutes\
  \ frequency and the legendary tactics all function at a once-per-day frequency can\
  \ help make deciding when and how to deploy the various tactics in your folio a\
  \ bigger part of your strategies across the day, without raising the cognitive load\
  \ of play too high.</li>\n       <li><strong>Traits: </strong>The use of “banner”\
  \ as both a class item and as a trait was sowing a bit of confusion, so we’re looking\
  \ at replacing the banner trait with a “brandish” trait to make it a bit clearer\
  \ that those abilities require you to have your banner held in hand and able to\
  \ be waved about.</li>\n       <li><strong>Feats: </strong>We’re not anticipating\
  \ a lot of changes here, but we’re looking at some opportunities to polish and expand\
  \ some of the functionality presented in the commander’s feats. One of the possible\
  \ changes we’re considering is swapping out the commander’s mount for a more versatile\
  \ “mascot” pet and adding in a class-specific capstone feat for said mascot.</li>\n\
  \      </ul>\n      <p>We know that folks really loved this class during the playtest,\
  \ so hopefully this opportunity to polish and elevate it further makes it even more\
  \ satisfying when the final iteration rolls out with the release of <em>Battlecry!</em>\
  \ next year!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/181dfc1f-1752-42d6-830d-5c5c1913d51a/TheWarBegins_1920x1080.jpg\"\

  \      <br>\n      <h3>The Guardian</h3>\n      <p>The majority of you felt that\
  \ the concept of the guardian was worth exploring but needed a little more polish\
  \ to really sing. We couldn’t agree more. Some of the class’s main features might\
  \ be able to interact with one another more cleanly, and we might be able to present\
  \ them in a way that shows that the guardian’s abilities are a set of tools that\
  \ each have their particular uses. We’re considering some larger overhauls to ensure\
  \ that the guardian is fun and exciting to play.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Intercept\
  \ Strike:</strong> Many of you responded that needing to be adjacent to an ally\
  \ to protect them could sometimes be difficult to engineer. We’re thinking about\
  \ adding some mobility to this core reaction, allowing to the guardian to move a\
  \ little bit before getting the in the way of the blow; after all, who doesn’t want\
  \ to fling themselves at the frail wizard as an archer’s arrow flies toward their\
  \ heart, dramatically screaming “Nooooo!”?</li>\n       <li><strong>Taunt:</strong>\
  \ We wanted to test an extreme version of this ability so we could get your opinions,\
  \ and we got them! In the current version, the bonus the target gets to attack the\
  \ guardian essentially negates the advantage of their increased armor proficiency;\
  \ for the less extreme revision, we’re considering focusing the ability on the penalty\
  \ it confers to attacking the guardian’s allies. Whether or not this final version\
  \ operates off of a saving throw or something else depends a lot on the specific\
  \ implementation, so we’ll be reviewing some possible directions.</li>\n       <li><strong>Armor\
  \ Specialization and Resistances:</strong> The concept of armor specialization might\
  \ seem to fit the guardian very well, but that game element was designed to mesh\
  \ with the abilities of other classes. After playtesting and going through the feedback,\
  \ we feel it could be a little confusing that the resistance granted through Intercept\
  \ Strike was different than the armor specialization resistance, so we’re looking\
  \ at giving the guardian their own generalized resistances that apply in multiple\
  \ situations!</li>\n       <li><strong>Feats:</strong> With the changes noted above\
  \ (and some others we’re working on), some of the guardian’s feats will need a bit\
  \ of reworking and recontextualizing to cohesively fit together in the final version.\
  \ And, yes, I know Hampering Sweeps is too good for this world! But I’m hoping the\
  \ idea of it will live on...</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Of course, there will be\
  \ other tweaks that we’ll make to the class as it goes through its post-playtest\
  \ revisions. We’re sure that the final guardian will be fun and exciting to play\
  \ for all of you who want to portray a character who goes to great lengths to protect\
  \ their allies in a fight!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
