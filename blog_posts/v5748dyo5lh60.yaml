  \ itemprop=\"description\">Last weekend I was in New York City for ToyFair, the\
  \ annual trade show for the toy business that sees hundreds of manufacturers and\
  \ thousands of buyers (but no kids!) gather for four days of meetings, buying sprees,\
  \ and other assorted activities. Paizo had a nice display of our gaming stuff at\
  \ the Diamond booth, as Diamond distributes our books and games into bookstores\
  \ and comic shops. Diamond's sister company, Diamond Select Toys, makes a number\
  \ of Pathfinder toys, including <a href=\"/companies/diamondSelect\">Pathfinder\
  \ Minimates</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy99m1\">an incredibly cool vinyl goblin\
  \ bank</a>, which comes out late next month.</p> \n    <p>Diamond's toy division\
  \ didn't have any Pathfinder goodies on display this year, but I was able to meet\
  \ with their team to discuss additional projects in 2015 and 2016 that I'm certain\
  \ Pathfinder fans will love. I'm very excited by what the future has in store!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Here's a look at the Pathfinder section of the overall Diamond booth.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo1_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But even if the Diamond booth didn't have a lot of plastic\
  \ Pathfinder items on display, that absence was more than made up for by our partners\
  \ at WizKids, who showed off a huge number of new <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures. I managed to snap several photos\
  \ of their display, but doing so was somewhat difficult because of the huge crowd\
  \ ogling them throughout the convention. I had a chance to chat with a few hobby\
  \ retailers who carried the line while I obsessively snapped my photos, which was\
  \ definitely fun! ToyFair brings in all kinds of retailers, and it's always great\
  \ to chat with store owners and managers who appreciate and support hobby gaming!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The largest <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> display\
  \ at the WizKids booth was <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>,\
  \ the set we plan to release in June.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \   <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In this shot we see a Pukwudgie and an Andrazku Demon\
  \ (both of which were originally going to be in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  ><em>Reign of Winter</em></a> set), with a Clockwork Golem in the middle and a Dire\
  \ Bat in the background.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo3_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the second half of WizKids's display, with a bunch\
  \ of figures including the Gnoll Slaver, Daughter of Urgathoa, and Sasquatch, some\
  \ of which we've revealed already on the blog.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo4_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This shot reveals a Giant Centipede, Baykok, and Chupacabra\
  \ in the foreground, with a Griffon, Daughter of Urgathoa, and some other stuff\
  \ in the background.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo5.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150220-Photo5_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a Dracolisk. I noticed that a lot of photos\
  \ other ToyFair attendees had taken tended to have this figure in the background\
  \ (sometimes not even standing up!), so I wanted to make sure to get a good shot\
  \ of it for you guys.</p> \n    <p>That said, it was about this time that I started\
  \ to get really, really frustrated with the quality of photos from my iPhone 4,\
  \ so I switched over to a much better camera on the phone of one of my colleagues.\
  \ That phone allowed me to take SUPER-HIGH-RES photos of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Iconic Heroes Sets</a> 2 and 3, which were the centerpiece of WizKids's ToyFair\
  \ display.</p> \n    <p>Unfortunately, we couldn't figure out a way to get those\
  \ photos onto my computer before my associate had to leave town, so I'm going to\
  \ have to bring them to you next Friday.</p> \n    <p>Believe me, they're worth\
  \ the wait!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
