  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In just two weeks, the first\
  \ single-player isometric CRPG using the rules and world of Pathfinder will be released—\
  Owlcat Games' <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i>. It's been a long time coming, and we\
  \ couldn't be more excited for the world at large to get to experience it!</p> \n\
  \     <p>One of the greatest challenges of adapting an adventure path like Kingmaker—\
  which came out way back in the spring of 2009—into a new medium is balancing faithfulness\
  \ to the source material with the creation of enough new content to entertain players\
  \ and GMs who played or ran the campaign in the last decade. Kingmaker, by far the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path with the most open, sandboxy feel, left the writers\
  \ at Owlcat (with industry veteran Chris Avellone, of <i>Planescape: Torment</i>\
  \ and <i>Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</i> fame) with plenty of\
  \ room to add their own content while still including all the now-iconic encounters\
  \ and story elements that made the pen-and-paper campaign such a classic.</p> \n\
  \     <p>An all-new introduction to the campaign, set in the manor house of Swordlord\
  \ Jamandi Aldori, serves not only as a tutorial for new players, but also gives\
  \ context to the player's mission (something the original campaign left to the GM)\
  \ and introduces some of the myriad characters who will play large roles in the\
  \ ongoing campaign, gaining both her most loyal companion and a hated rival.</p>\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180910-JamandiAldori_500.png\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Throughout the game, in addition to countless new side-missions\
  \ and subplots introduced as connective tissue between the story elements presented\
  \ in the pen-and-paper version of the campaign, the player can engage in deeply\
  \ immersive companion-based plots involving each of over ten companions. Some of\
  \ these, such as Amiri's companion quests, incorporate elements of the existing\
  \ campaign, like the nomadic Kellid barbarians who show up in chapter four, while\
  \ others are entirely new content involving such epic villains as Numeria's Technic\
  \ League! Other side quests expand on simple plot hooks provided on the inside covers\
  \ of the original printed books meant for GM inspiration. Still others are wholly\
  \ new plotlines created to flesh out large map areas or tie together disparate elements\
  \ of the campaign in new and inventive ways.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <p>As if that weren't enough, <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> includes a seventh\
  \ chapter above and beyond the six printed in the pages of <i>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path</i> back in 2009. This expedition into the mysteries of the First World and\
  \ some of the machinations of the Eldest is perhaps the game's most inspired and\
  \ imaginative content!</p> \n     <p><i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> releases on September\
  \ 25, and is available for preorder now on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/\"\
  >Steam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/game/pathfinder_kingmaker_explorer_edition\"\
