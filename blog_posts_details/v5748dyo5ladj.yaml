    \ action, the Golem can capture the knowledge of any creature within 30 feet.\
    \ When using this ability, the Golem's eyes seem to swell, becoming deep, endless\
    \ pools. The target must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become a mindless vegetable\
    \ for 1d4 rounds, unable to perform any action. During this time, the Golem can\
    \ use any skill or feat possessed by the victim as if it itself had the skill\
    \ or feat, adding the victim's skill ranks to its own if it already possesses\
    \ them. In addition, the victim's BAB, if higher, replaces the Golem's, and the\
    \ Golem gains all of the victim's spells, able to cast them without their requisite\
    \ components (if any). Any such spells used by the Golem are considered cast when\
    \ the victim regains control of his senses. The Golem can only capture the knowledge\
    \ of one target at a time. Any creature that succeeds at its Will save is immune\
    \ to this effect for the next 24 hours. This save DC is Charisma-based. A traveler"
