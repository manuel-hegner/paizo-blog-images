  \ on Paizo's <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial\"> free web fiction Wednesday</a>,\
  \ and this time we have something new and different for you! In celebration of the\
  \ release of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8iqp\"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a>, the\
  \ new <a href=\"/pathfinderTales\">Pathfinder Tales</a> novel, we've brought you\
  \ a <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial\">brand-new prequel story</a> from <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy8iqp\"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> author Howard Andrew Jones,\
  \ featuring a number of the same characters but taking place well before the novel.\
  \ Once again (or rather, once before) the Forlorn elf Elyana and her friends will\
  \ encounter the evil of the Gray Gardeners in Galt—but this time there are the dark\
  \ depths of the Verduran Forest to contend with as well. It's a pleasure to get\
  \ to see characters from the novels in the web fiction, and we hope to do so each\
  \ time a new novel releases—as well as sometimes just for fun.</p> \n   <p>As an\
  \ author, Howard has knocked it out of the park. Early comments on <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8iqp\"\
  ><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> have been extremely positive, and it's easy to see\
  \ why. Perhaps it's the smooth speed with which he handles the fight scenes (and\
  \ there are plenty), or the fast-paced sword and sorcery flavor (which is hardly\
  \ surprising, given his status as Managing Editor of modern pulp magazine <i>Black\
  \ Gate</i>). Yet even more than that, I think it's the classic feel of his stories\
  \ that draw people in. Of all the novels we've published so far, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8iqp\"\
  ><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> is the one that most closely hews to the time-tested\
  \ adventuring party dynamic. There's Elyana, the Forlorn elven ranger who knows\
  \ her love for any human can never last; Drelm the honorable half-orc, struggling\
  \ against his heritage; Vallyn the bard; Kellius the wizard—these are characters\
  \ that feel familiar, even as they feel new.</p> \n   <p>And that's just the main\
  \ party. Set many years earlier than the novel, this new story, \"The Walkers from\
  \ the Crypt,\" introduces us to the party that came before, and to the tensions\
  \ that laid the novel's groundwork. But I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll\
  \ stop there, and just say that it's a lot of fun.</p> \n   <p>I would also be remiss\
  \ if I didn't note artist Eric Belisle's amazing illustration of Elyana, who also\
  \ features on the cover of <i>Plague of Shadows</i>. Eric's perfectly captured the\
  \ look and feel of an elven ranger from Golarion, and I hope you'll agree that the\
  \ character in both the story and the novel are every bit as compelling as the illustration.</p>\
