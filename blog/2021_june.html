                <p>First of all, why are you out here in the streets? Is it not time for your lessons? Taking after me, now, are we? Never mind!</p> 
                <p>Don’t cover your ears, sister. The aftermath of a revolution is a wonderfully loud thing. Look! That was Prince Haliad’s statue crashing to the ground. I think I see Bapa with those farmers dragging its ugly stone head to that catapult we stole. I hope they fling it at that stubborn pirate schooner that hasn’t taken the hint to leave port. There’s no way Anthusis will let them land on its shores.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>What are you doing out here alone? Don’t get me wrong—I’m excited to see you amidst all this! Seeing that old statue fall in front of the embassy is a splendid reason to skip your studies. This is history in the making, sister! Let it fill your senses; a book won’t give you the same gift as these liberated streets. But how did you slip past Mielle? I know she’s gotten older, but with each year her senses have only sharpened—the old panther. Tell me how you escaped, and don’t say you learned it from me! I could never slip her gaze, and I’ve the welts to prove it.</p> 
                <p>Do you like my outfit? In truth it’s a bit Chelish for my taste, but it moves much better than what I left home with. When I have time, I’ll make use of Mielle’s needlepoint lessons and fashion something more reminiscent of home. </p> 
                <p>I don’t look like a Free Captain’s cohort, Jiella! Only a Firebrand would wear colors this loud, and this city could take more than a few cues from our fashion sense! I’d bet Bapa’s skiff that you’ve never even seen those privateers up close. I’ve had to cut through two of them in the past month.</p> 
                <p>Where did I get the sword? Promise you won’t tell—else I’ll never be able to come home! It belonged to Mama. I don’t know why she had it; all those diplomacies to nowhere she conducted in our living room could have been cut much shorter with this. It felt heavy at first, but after a couple months fighting on these shackled seas, my arm feels incomplete without it. That stain on my sleeve? It’s just a bit of wine. I may need a wash it—don’t give me that look, Jie!</p> 
                <p>Were Mama and Bapa home when you slipped out? There are some articles I’ve meant to procure from my room now that things have started to settle. </p> 
                <p>Mielle has been preparing full meals every night since the Hurricane Queen faffed off to the other side of Desperation Bay? I’ll have to stop home and grab a bottle of her kremas to share with my ship. It’s requisite for a Firebrand to know how to share—and the old panther owes me more than one drink for her rigor. Let’s get you home so I can collect my libationary toll.</p> 
                <p>You wear these clothes much better than I did. Most outfits suit me better after they’ve been thoroughly sea-bitten. I see that you’ve been eating well—as Mama and Bapa told you to, no doubt. I assume they give my share to you now that I’ve been gone a season. It seems like you’ve grown a half-foot! I bet you’ll be taller than me by year’s end. </p> 
                <p>I don’t mean to make them worry, you know. I just never fit what they needed. It’s embarrassing how much better you are with words than I was at your age. I think they can see that you fit them better, too. I hope they miss me. I miss them. I’ve been thinking of them a lot—and you, of course. I see you snuck out of your window to see what the crash was! You’re more like me than I thought. I’m a bad influence on you, Jiella! Let me boost you back up. I’ll be right behind you. Once we’re inside, give me for a moment to track down Mielle’s kremas stock—if she’s made multiple batches, she won’t be too upset if one of them goes missing.</p> 
                <p>May I fashion your hair like we used to do together? I’ve been working on a new style for the times; twelve braids fashioned like a crown: one for each month from now to keep Vidrian autonomous. If Mama asks who did your hair, just deflect with that. I’m sure she’ll appreciate the idea. I have a message for her and Bapa, too. They can’t trust the ‘Independent’ Banks of Vidrian, even if they can trust Mandla Dube. Please pass this onto them and say it came from the Vane—they’ll take it more seriously than from me.</p> 
                <p>I must go now, sister, but take this turquoise comb for your new crown. With it, you’ll look almost as dashing as me! In a few years, Mama and Bapa will want you with them in the Vidric Council—and you should join them when that time comes. Don’t forget about the streets, though! Look around, there’s so much to rebuild and replace. New homes to be made, new stores to spread the wealth, new dishes to define the taste of Vidrian as its own. No idols are going to show our nation the way forward, whether they’re deities or nobles, but our community can figure it out together. When the council dissolves into noise, go somewhere else to cut through it. Don’t fight, but be like a sword. Leave the sharp stuff to me as you rebuild this place. I’ll be in step with you—but first, I’m off to Smuggler’s Shiv to procure a donation to our new nation. Crying isn’t going to keep me from leaving! I’ll be back again before you know it. And not as one of that isle’s specters.</p> 
                <p>I love you, Jiella—Mama and Bapa, too. They’ll approve of my course in due time—and they’ll let you set yours. For now, you should listen to them. Eventually, they’ll see how much the future needs my blade and your words.<br> So don’t cry too long. I’m not dead yet. </p>

This month, the Data Scourge metaplot continues in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027p6?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-403-Battle-for-the-Beacon">Starfinder Society #4-03: Battle for the Beacon</a>. Over the past months, Drift Beacons have been winking out, leading some in the Society to believe that this event and the ongoing digital attacks might be connected. Play as a group of agents sent to investigate and repair one of these Drift Beacons in this adventure for PCs levels 5–8 by Abbey Schnell!</p> 
                <p>Also this month, the spotlight returns to an old frenemy of the Society. When socialite Envar Tamm goes missing, corporate powerhouse Ilia Tamm wants to hire a team of Starfinders to help in the investigation. Radaszam sees this as an opportunity to settle the organization’s accounts with the wealthy family once and for all, so he recruits the PCs to travel to a distant planet in search of Envar.

                <p>Our first Pathfinder scenario for June takes us deep into the deserts of Thuvia. The Pathfinder Society recently learned that vile cultists have been searching for ancient keys to a ruined site buried in the sands. Knowing that the cultists are close to bringing their evil plans to fruition, the Society sends a team to confront them and learn what lies within the ruins. What mysteries lie beyond the dunes?

                <p>The next June scenario is the penultimate adventure in the exciting metaplot for the Year of Corruption’s Reach! The Pathfinders are going to need all the help they can get to thwart a fiendish plan that is millennia in the making. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027p8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-222-Breaking-the-Storm-Excising-Ruination">Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-22: Breaking the Storm: Excising Ruination</a> is the first 2nd Edition Pathfinder Society scenario for levels 7–10.

                <p itemprop="description">June is Pride Month, a time for the LGBTQ+ community to celebrate their lives, their struggles, and their identities. It’s also a time to remind ourselves and those around us that the fight for equality is not over. The first Pride celebrations were inspired by the Stonewall riots, a six-day riot against police brutality, led by community leaders including Marsha P. Johnson, a Black trans woman.</p> 
                <p>Pride is important because LGBTQ+ individuals do not have equality in <em>any</em> country. The <a href="http://internap.hrw.org/features/features/lgbt_laws/">Human Rights Watch</a> reports that 69 countries have national laws criminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults. At least nine countries have laws criminalizing “forms of gender expression that target transgender and gender nonconforming people,” and many more countries don’t need to pass laws to ensure their police forces and militaries do the work of suppressing LGBTQ+ lives. Worldwide, gay, trans and non-conforming individuals face legal and illegal discrimination, abuse, and hatred. There are places in this world I will not travel with my fiancé because I am worried we will face physical and verbal abuse, and some of those places are within driving distance of where I live. Here in America, my rights are debated on a daily basis in local, state and federal court. </p> 
                <p>My fellow contributors to this blog and I are <em>lucky</em> that many of us live in a country that will not arrest us, directly, in most places, for our sexuality or gender. We are <em>lucky</em> that Paizo is a company that does not discourage us from expressing ourselves in our personal lives, and that permits us to create beautiful and diverse worlds that represent the world as we would like to see it. But we are <em>lucky</em>, and every gamer knows that sometimes the dice run hot, and sometimes you roll a 1. None of that is guaranteed to us, and it could be taken away in moments - or slowly, over four years.</p> 
                <hr width="50%"> 
                <p>I started with the depressing stuff not because I wanted to, but because I didn’t want it to get lost. But that’s not all of what Pride is. Pride is also about joy in who we are, and in our community. It’s about gathering and celebrating our lives, the freedoms we have fought to achieve, and to remind ourselves that it is all worth it.</p> 
                <p>For this year’s Pride blog, I asked our staffers and contributors to tell us about something they’re proud of from the past year. I told them that it didn’t have to be gaming related; that, in fact, this was a chance to use the platform we’re lucky to have to shout out the things that don’t get attention. I’d like to thank them all for sharing themselves with me and with the Paizo community. </p>

                <h3>Alexander Augunas, Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>I'm Alexander Augunas! I'm the Know Direction Network's Everyman Gamer, publisher of Everybody Games, and a freelancer for Paizo Inc. This past year has been a crazy year for us all, but I like to think that I did some good work during the chaos and confusion of the global shutdown. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023gd?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Legends"><em>Lost Omens: Legends</em></a>, I presented Golarion's most powerful sorceress, Hao Jin (set to appear in the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</em></a>) as an asexual woman whose experiences with asexuality I personally identify with, a prospect that I felt was one of the most deeply empowering and important RPG articles I have ever written. Second only, perhaps, to <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2020/07/guidance-the-rot-in-rpg-on-race-and-racism-in-tabletop-rpgs/">The Rot in RPGs</a>, a blog article I did for the Know Direction Network where I analyzed how systemic racism has impacted tabletop RPGs and offered some suggestions on what we as a community should do to combat it. It's a deeply researched piece that I wrote in response to the murder of George Floyd, and it's an article I hope inspires gamers to keep doing better as a community for those who are marginalized. Because I truly believe that if we try, we can change. Games have that kind of power, and I firmly believe that as creators we have the responsibility to use our power to better the world we've inherited.</p>

                <p>On June 15th, my wife and I celebrated 19 years of marriage (21 years of being together), of which I am very proud.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Carlos Cabrera, Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>The thing I am most proud of this year is somehow finding a better work and life balance over the course of it. I know this time has been hard for so many of us, but what I discovered about myself getting through it is where my healthier boundaries are and how to lay them down more confidently. When my pandemic fatigue set in, I signed up for the Moderna trial. When I had to make big, life-altering changes at home, I found a place where I can still be a part of my incredible 4 year old's life.</p> 
                <p>I am proud I was able to do all of that on my own terms. Creatively, this has led me down new paths of freelancing. I have a coming project I can't wait to tell people more about—my first ever built and pitched privately with the help of a new friend. I am also planning a return to voice acting. There is a lot to look forward to, but you know what also helped a great deal? My partners of more than one gender who made it a point (in a pandemic!) to be in my company.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/14b28767-9cef-4407-abb4-9373651c4aa9/071620_haojin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/14b28767-9cef-4407-abb4-9373651c4aa9/071620_haojin.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Tall human female with long flowing red hair wearing a kimono, their left hand casting a spell on the miniature building held in their right hand."></a>

                <h3>Shay Snow (they/them), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>I’m super proud that I’ve pushed myself this year to accept projects that I would normally shy away from. I’ve spent a long time turning things down because of a deep fear of being under qualified or just the belief that I wouldn’t be good enough when compared to other people who came before me. This year has been a rollercoaster ride, but I can look back at it and actively point out my victories and places where I’ve excelled and grown as a person. My partner, my friends, and I have watched me break out of my comfort zone and restore my self-confidence in not just my writing and editing skills, but also in myself and my ability to handle large projects. I look forward to another year of accepting things and showing not just other people, but showing <em>myself</em> that I can handle anything thrown my way.</p>

                <h3>James Jacobs, Pathfinder Creative Director</h3> 
                <p>Writing adventures about ghosts and cultists and things that go bump in the night has long been something I’ve enjoyed, but with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a>, an adventure I ran for several folks here at the office last year before writing it up as a standalone adventure for Pathfinder, I finally got to create that haunted house adventure I’ve been eager to write. Several of the spooky, creepy events and encounters that I inflicted on my players made it into the adventure, along with a few that I had planned but they never reached and a few more that I made up specifically for the adventure. The in-depth mechanics for how players can unravel the manor’s mystery by researching, investigating, and interpreting haunted dreams is one of my favorite parts of the adventure, and I can’t mention the other favorite part without spoiling something big. Still, it’s exciting to get <em>Malevolence</em> out into the world after it spent a few extra months in shipping delay hell, and I hope it does as good a job providing your group with a bit of escape from the horrors of the past year as it did for me to write it.</p>

                <h3>Amber Stewart (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>It has been a really awesome year for me, and I’m super proud of not only having my first AP entry released with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026dr?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-162-Ruins-of-the-Radiant-Siege"><em>Ruins of the Radiant Siege</em></a> (in which I’m thrilled to have included an explicitly trans NPC Il’setsya Wyrmtouched) but for also finally, FINALLY finishing with school and receiving my doctorate (Doctor of Pharmacy). I hope that this next year can be just as great and even more productive!</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/671e59b1-ed03-42ff-94fb-cfcfe7500fa9/062421_Dr Monslkis.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/671e59b1-ed03-42ff-94fb-cfcfe7500fa9/062421_Dr Monslkis.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A female verthani wearing glasses with her brown hair pulled into a bun and adorned with cybernetic augmentations.

                <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>Hey, all! I'm bi and demisexual, and I've been freelancing for Paizo for a few years. It's been a tough year, globally speaking, but I hit a few personal milestones that I'm proud of, the release of my first AP volume (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jk?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-37-The-White-Glove-Affair"><em>The White Glove Affair</em></a>) being one of them. What I'm focusing on here, though, is a little more mundane: I've been talking to people.</p> 
                <p>I'm not a very outgoing person, which has always made networking intimidating to me. I'd talked to people off and on at PaizoCon, but until recently, I hadn't really gotten to know anyone in the freelancing community too well. With the con's shift to being online, though, I was more comfortable casually chatting. After that, staying in touch with other freelancers seemed to flow naturally, and before I knew it, I was in a community of talented writers and fun people, some of whom I now count as friends as well as colleagues. I look forward to meeting them once in-person cons are safe again! And...well, maybe you'll see me hanging out at the hotel bar next PaizoCon. I promise not to flee if you come say hi. :-)</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>Hi there, I’m a Paizo freelancer and am proudly BIPOC, queer, and transgender! I do other things as well, including professional GMing and voice acting. Without a doubt, my proudest accomplishment this past year was nailing my first freelancing assignment with Paizo. It’s no secret that the book in question is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and while I can’t spoil any of its content, I think I can share that in the end I was able to write something deeply personal that I hope will resonate just as powerfully with other people who share similar experiences. In fact, I’m definitely going to be talking about it on Twitter once the book is released, so if that sounds interesting then you can follow me there at @MistressDanaRPG. Until next time, endless love and support for each and every one of you who help to make our community a more inclusive, diverse, and welcoming place!</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Dustin Knight (he/him), Paizo Freelancer</h3> 
                <p>The word I've used to describe this last year has been <em>surreal</em>. I'd repeat again and again: <em>survive, not thrive</em>. And yet, I struggled every day to do something I could be proud of, even if it meant fighting to convince myself that I deserved to rest. But even as I write this, I find myself pondering what it means to feel <em>pride</em>. It's tempting to drop names and links in some hackneyed attempt to avoid today's undertaking, but it's one I've avoided for too many years. Today I'm proud to publicly identify as asexual.</p> 
                <p>And yet, I can't help but feel like I'm still avoiding the prompt. So I've got to admit what I'm most proud of this surreal year has been my career. I've passed so many milestones it's hard to believe any of this is real. Most surreal of all was having aced the Paizo design test last fall. Proving myself in that capacity and then getting my first hardcover book assignment has been a validating experience unlike any other. So many friends have helped me on this journey, and this year I hope I've made them proud. Thank you, my dear friends. And thank you, Paizo.</p> <!--<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com"><img width=300 src="https://cdn.paizo.com" hspace="5" alt=""></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>-->

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</a> offers a robust, yet simple system for generating entire science fantasy worlds on the fly, including populating them with creatures, adventures, and more. So let’s make ourselves a world, starting with nothing but our trusty dice and the two-page Building Worlds article in the Galaxy Exploration Manual.</p> 
                <p>For our first step, we’ll see what <b>type of world</b> we’re generating: is it a gas giant, an asteroid—even a colony ship? We roll 42 on our d% table and get… a terrestrial world, which is one that’s naturally habitable and has one or more biomes (coming in step 3). Not a bad place to start for most worlds, though we could always just choose something weirder if we wanted it.</p> 
                <p>Next, we’ll see what kind of <b>gravity and atmosphere</b> this world has by rolling d% twice more. Results of 42 and 84 give us standard gravity and a thick atmosphere, respectively. Handy page references guide us to the parts of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> that’ll tell us more about thick atmospheres.</p> 
                <p>Next comes a key step: identifying our world’s <b>biomes</b>! What kinds of environments are present on this world? Do the creatures and cultures reside entirely in the air? In rugged mountains or soggy marshes? Let’s roll a d12 on the biomes table and find out! Our first roll is a 2, which gives us the aquatic biome. We could stop there and have a water world, but let’s roll a couple more times and see what else we get. Two more rolls (a 5 and a 10) add forest and subterranean biomes to the mix. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3438994f-8f82-499f-8e15-915879670d85/062321_AQUATICBIOME.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3438994f-8f82-499f-8e15-915879670d85/062321_AQUATICBIOME.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="The iconic shirren mystic is underwater in a submersible, examining a small alien fish, while a giant creature with a gaping maw looms behind him.]"></a>

                </div> 
                <br> 
                <p>We’ll return to the biomes for more inspiration in a moment, but let’s fill in our world’s <b>cultural attributes</b> first. We roll a d6 six times and get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (what are the odds?!). This tells us, respectively, that the world has low accord (meaning folks don’t much get along), a chaotic neutral alignment, medium magic, high religion, and high technology. </p> 
                <p>With that, we’re done generating the basics of our random world! But wait—there’s more! The next 80 pages of this book offer tons of flavor, adventure hooks, inhabitants, and player options tied to the biomes and cultural attributes we just generated. For now, let’s just use our aquatic biome and high technology attribute to get some more details about this place, shall we?</p> 
                <p>Turning to the aquatic biome, we find an inhabitants table, which has both sentient species (those likely to have cultures and settlements) and threats (those likely to attempt to eat or rearrange our faces). We roll d% a couple times for inhabitants, getting 42 and 84, and find that our sentient creatures are lacedon ghouls (chaotic evil aquatic undead) and stelliferas (diminutive cuttlefish-like creatures adapted to the deep sea)—no wonder they don’t get along! For our threat creatures, we roll again and get glass serpents and aquatic jubsnuths (bulbous predators with two mouths).</p> 
                <p>Our aquatic biome also has a wealth of adventure hooks, but let’s turn to the technology section and roll something from its adventure-hook tables instead! Rolling a 14 on the high-technology table gives us “a dangerous nanite malfunction threatens an entire world.” Uh oh! Did the nanites originate from the experiments of one of our aquatic species, or are perhaps some of our forest or subterranean dwellers to blame? Is our world’s atmosphere thick because it’s choked with nanites, or were the tiny robots originally made to clear the air? And what else is happening on this world? We could turn to any of our biomes or cultural attributes to get still more inspiration and adventure, but for the purposes of this blog, we’ll leave these mysteries to be solved.</p> 
                <p>Also, if we want to fill in details about settlements, NPCs, or the like, there are a number of <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpq?A-Galaxy-Of-Toolboxes">toolboxes</a> that will serve us well in chapter 3 of this very book!</p> 
                <p>Leave a comment if this world inspired any ideas of your own. And if you’ve already used the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Galaxy Exploration Manual</a> to create your own worlds, tell us about them!</p>

                <h3><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027sl">Second Edition Classes: Cabalist (PF2E) PDF</a></h3> 
                <p><em>Legendary Cabalists</em> is a brand-new class for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>, an occult spellcaster devoted to the secret mysteries of hidden spirits within the world and in worlds beyond! These occult spellcasters tap into the hidden world of magic through their familiars, either following the teachings of a cabal like the Beastcallers, Leyline Cult, or The Seekers of Perfect Form or attempting to remain unbound to master their powers alone. Each cabalist binds with an animus like pyre, storms, portents, or wisdom, and this mystical communion shapes their eldritch power, sometimes even changing their casting tradition, with animus blessings and bonus spells, familiar adaptations, and taboos!</p>

                <p>While some of these tools will be useful to players building their characters’ backstories, GMs will find them invaluable in running open-ended adventures. So, let’s put ourselves in a Starfinder GM’s shoes and see what we can get out of GEM</p> 
                <p>Let’s suppose our party has used the exploration system in the book’s first chapter to identify a new system and decides to travel through the Drift to find it. Our first stop as GM can be the <b>Drift Encounters Toolbox</b>, where we have a d% table with 50 options for encounters in the Drift, ranging between combat and exploration. We roll a 42 and get “A time dragon travels the Drift, ensuring any temporal differences of active planar bubbles are not being abused.” Depending on our party’s makeup, their actions, and their goals, this usually neutral dragon might be a help, a hindrance, the quest giver of a new side quest—or merely another interesting but brief sighting on a journey through the Drift.</p> 
                <p>Our players might also encounter another ship in the Drift, so let’s turn to the <b>Starship Toolbox</b> and roll up a random name and a quirk! We roll 42 for the first word of the ship name (Infinite) and a 42 for the second word (Hope), as well as a 13 for the starship quirks table, which tells us that “the ship is a replica of a fictional ship from a popular holovid.” Again, we can make as much or as little of this as we and our party is interested in. We could instead roll on the legendary starships table to have a brush with a famous (or infamous) starship from the Starfinder setting.</p>

                <p>Our next stop is a new world the party is exploring! Again, a future blog will cover the world-building system, which includes fleshing out a world’s physical and cultural characteristics and it inhabitants, but for now, let’s use the <b>Settlement Toolbox</b> to inspire us for the first settlement our PCs visit! Rolling on the settlement quirks table, we get 42: Many inhabitants claim to be descended from a lost line of an important family that originates from this world or another. We then roll 42 on the settlement challenges table and learn that the settlement’s inhabitants enjoy a form of entertainment that surreptitiously carries a supernatural form of illness. We also have a table of locations for when the PCs want to wander around, do some investigating (or window shopping). Rolling 42, we get the local transport dealer, where people can purchase or repair ground-based transportation (the details of which will vary wildly depending on our world’s tech level, biomes, and so forth).</p> 
                <p>Of course, there are people populating this settlement, and our PCs are bound to want to harangue—I mean, meet—some of them, so let’s turn to the <b>NPC Toolbox</b> and see who their first victim—I mean, new friend—is! Perhaps they’re the transport dealer we just met. We roll twice on the name and species table (two 42s) and get Lajai, an ikeshti. Of course, to bring the character alive, we’ll want a personality quirk, so let’s roll on that d% table. We get a 42, so now we know that Lajai hates their day job and dreams of becoming a vid star.</p> 
                <p>Finally, we’d be remiss to overlook the <b>Treasure Toolbox</b>, full of story-rich treasure that can be far more interesting than another credstick or hunk of starmetal. Perhaps Lajai knows of one of these treasures and offers to split the profits if the PCs can recover it (finally allowing Lajai to pursue their vid-star dreams!) We roll 13 on the table for treasures worth 5,000 credits (there are tables for multiple values) and get a computerized music box that algorithmically generates new songs based on what other music it has overheard. </p> 
                <p>Of course, if we want to reroll any of these results, or even just handpick them, we’re free to (and we might want to get our d% dice checked out, anyway…). These toolboxes provide inspiration for countless adventures throughout the galaxy! </p> 
                <p>We’ll see you next time, when we build a world from scratch with just a few rolls.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Juneteenth, or Emancipation Day, celebrates June 19, 1865, the day when the last slaves in the United States were finally informed they were free. The road from the first Juneteenth to today wasn’t smooth or easy. Last year, I wrote a blog about the history of Juneteenth, which you can find <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9k?Happy-Juneteenth">here</a>, but this year, I wanted to talk a bit about what we can do on Juneteenth now, in the present day, and in the future.</p> 
                <p>So, how can we celebrate Juneteenth? How do we commemorate a day fraught with so much pain and suffering? One of the best ways we can celebrate Emancipation Day is by educating ourselves about the history of our country that we didn't learn about in school. The contributions of Black people to every aspect of our nation, be it socially, culturally, philosophically, or technologically, are tremendous. Thankfully, there are lot of resources out there! Annually, <a href="https://www.juneteenthny.com/" target="_blank">New York hosts a 3-day Juneteenth summit</a> with talent shows, health and wellness screenings, educational activities and more. This year, like last year, the summit is online, making it accessible regardless of location. Likewise, this year, the <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/" target="_blank">Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture</a> presents programming that highlights both the history of the holiday and stories of the people who lived it. </p> 
                <p>Another way we can celebrate the holiday is by going out and supporting Black businesses. Buy a gift from a marginalized creator. Eat at a Black-owned restaurant. Many organizations maintain lists of local businesses owned by Black proprietors—here in Seattle, we have the Seattle Good Business Network, so check to see if a similar resource exists for your area! On a larger scale, the US Chamber of Commerce wrote an article featuring 8 rosters of Black businesses.</p> 
                <p>Our own industry, tabletop RPGs, has its own history of erased Black innovators, creators, and personalities. We can help reform the industry by learning about Black people in the industry and the ways they influence and shape not just the games we love, but the communities we participate in. There are a number of games and settings being made by Black creators right now. Look at them, learn about them, talk about them with your friends, engage with them, and if you're making them, keep making them! One I've been following recently is <a href="https://motherlandsrpg.com/" target="_blank">Into the Motherlands</a>.</p>

                <p>Last week, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/juneteenth-congress-federal-holiday-3cc3b7a56ec97b0bae3dbdff1da092ee">Congress moved to make Juneteenth a national holiday</a>, something it should have been since 1865. At this point, it needs President Biden’s signature, and it is likely that in the next few days this will occur (Update: it did! Juneteenth is now a national holiday!). That’s an important thing, but it is also important to remember that we have to go beyond just performance. Our country still struggles with not just the legacy of slavery, but ongoing slavery and systemic racism in the form of our prison and economic systems. Commemorating one of the most important days in our nation’s history with a national holiday is a valuable first step in moving forward, be we can’t let it be a symbol of the defeat of racism, or let it convince us that the injustices, the horrors, inflicted on the Black community are behind us, because neither of those things are true. When the holiday is past, we should keep doing the things we did during it: keep pushing for change, keep demanding justice, keep supporting Black businesses, and keep learning.</p>

                <h3>Wendlyn, Incorrigible Thief</h3> 
                <p>Wendlyn grew up in Otari and knows just about everyone in it. This means she knows which people are safe to target with her petty larceny. She’s been on the wrong side of Captain Longsaddle of the Otari town guard for as long as she can remember, but she keeps away from the sorts of crimes that would call for serious punishment, or that would seriously hurt anyone. The people of Otari are immune to her thefts but not her pranks; she’s fond of hiding animals where they’ll surprise people or livening up a celebration with some unexpected fireworks. She considers it to be all in good fun. Captain Longsaddle would definitely disagree, as would her younger half-sister, the pious acolyte <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk1?NoPrep-Character-Lisavet">Lisavet</a>.</p> 
                <p>Wendlyn is an excellent person to become acquainted with in Otari, as she knows a fair share of the town’s secrets. Her lifelong inclination toward theft also makes her just the right person to disable a tricky lock or disarm a complicated trap. She’s eager to join just about any escapade, illicit or otherwise, as long as no one seems likely to get seriously hurt.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4c4c5976-5cec-4b8f-a68c-bbafe0081683/061821_WENDLYN.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4c4c5976-5cec-4b8f-a68c-bbafe0081683/061821_WENDLYN.png" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="a lithe half-elf woman wears dark leather armor and wields a short sword"></a>

                <p><b>Surprise Attack</b> On the first round of combat, if Wendlyn rolls Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted yet are flat-footed to her.</p> 
                <p><b>Plot Hooks</b></p> 
                <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Wendlyn into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Wendlyn needs the heroes to help her recover a hand mirror she stole from an abandoned house and then fenced, as she didn’t realize its presence was keeping a ghost confined to the old house. She hopes to recover the mirror from the fence and get it back into the house before anyone’s hurt.</li> 
                 <li>One of the heroes is an alibi who can prove Wendlyn wasn’t at the scene of a crime that Captain Longsaddle is certain she committed. The heroes must work to prove the thief’s innocence—in this particular matter, at least.</li> 
                 <li>The heroes have come across a strange puzzle box that defies all attempts to open it, but an expert locksmith like Wendlyn might be able to help.</li> 
                 <li>Through her shady contacts, Wendlyn has heard of a plot to smuggle drugs into Otari’s harbor late at night. She hopes to intercept the smugglers, dump the drugs into the harbor’s waters, and teach the smugglers to stay out of her town.</li> 
                </ul>

Let’s take a look!</p> 
                <h4>Surviving the Great, Itchy Outdoors</h4> 
                <p>Your armor’s environmental protections might shield you from the worst temperature fluctuations and breathability issues, yet wilderness adventures are rife with other threats and nuisances. This rain is messing up my ranged attacks. Is that plant poisonous, venomous, carnivorous, or all of the above? How are we supposed to survive on this planet with high gravity and constant lightning strikes? Also, gah, how did swamp water get into my powered armor?!</p> 
                <p>Fortunately, we have a wealth of tools for identifying, surviving, and even exploiting environmental hazards. The mechanic packs a new trick called <b>sample scanner</b>, which lets you plug small material samples into your exocortex and have it analyze the material to tell you everything you want to know about that weird rock formation or unfamiliar flora you’re investigating. Ever had your armor’s environmental protections run dry while you’re halfway across a trackless continent? Maybe you want the technomancer’s magic hack <b>extend protections</b>, which can recharge your armor’s batteries using leftover spell slots. As a witchwarper, why not borrow environmental resistances from an alternate version of yourself with the paradigm shift <b>shifting adaptation</b>? Or laugh off any hazard with the soldier’s <b>rover fighting style</b>, which helps you shrug off discomfort while clambering over just about anything the galaxy throws at you.</p> 
                <p>Does that sound too rugged and confident? Would you rather play the shaky character who’s entirely unhappy about being cold, wet, unconnected to the infosphere, and convinced that everything is out to eat you? To my delight, the envoy boasts some delightful new improvisations that turn your shouts of “Aah, what’s that? AAAAH, what’s <em>THAT?!</em>” into powerful tools. Convince animals and vermin to leave, thank you very much, with the <b>shoo!</b> improvisation. Or signal that something is strange and very wrong with <b>early warning</b>. You can even redirect your companions’ readied action triggers, changing these to react to a strange new threat with <b>changing circumstances</b>.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/eb007e51-30cc-408c-a9ec-3be466952366/061721_MACHETESOLDIER.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/eb007e51-30cc-408c-a9ec-3be466952366/061721_MACHETESOLDIER.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An armored ysoki soldier wielding a machete"></a>

                <h4>Getting From Here to There</h4> 
                <p>Alright, we’re alive. Fantastic! Now we just need to get to that exploring part. So how exactly are we going to navigate this alien wilderness again?</p> 
                <p>Look no further than a host of new options dedicated to finding paths through difficult conditions. How about your mystic, whose <b>trailblazer connection</b> allows you to bond with environments, helping you sense the safest trails through deadly areas? Stuck in mud, pinned by a hungry ksarik, spinning helplessly in zero-g, or gazing forlornly at a ravine you can’t jump? That sounds like the perfect time for your witchwarper to teleport to safety with the <b>dimensional extraction</b> paradigm shift. If piloting a vehicle for hours on end sounds tedious, maybe it’s time you snagged that <b>artificial pilot</b> mechanic trick, which turns your drone into a capable driver. Or when the GM throws hazards in your way, just shout no…by activating new vanguard disciplines like <b>blaze a trail</b> (which lets you disintegrate difficult terrain as you move through it) or <b>Blast Through</b> (which lets you break huge obstacles with remarkable ease).</p> 
                <br clear="all"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d21632c7-5084-418d-96a8-f4a76ff64ed4/061721_TRAILBLAZINGVANGUARD.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d21632c7-5084-418d-96a8-f4a76ff64ed4/061721_TRAILBLAZINGVANGUARD.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A human vanguard bursting through vines with her shield"></a>

                <h4>We Jump Together!</h4> 
                <p>One of my favorite components of wilderness encounters is varying elevation, and the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> provides tons of ways for you to navigate, exploit, and just outright enjoy altitude differences.</p> 
                <p>Need a boost? The biohacker can learn <b>locomotive adaptation</b> and its advanced version as theorems, granting allies climb or swim speeds to navigate difficult obstacles. Once you’re up high, your operative might want the <b>high-ground sniper</b> exploit, which gives your sniper weapons an extra punch when you strike from above—and let’s not forget that wildernesses often involve longer encounter distances, which can make snipers really shine!</p> 
                <p>But perhaps my favorite abilities are the ones that embrace the inevitable: that PCs eventually need to descend quickly to escape trouble or join a melee. Why not do it in style? That biohacker can also learn the theorem <b>cushion the blow</b>, which lets you buffer a companion against falling damage (or even against incoming bludgeoning attacks). Or just embrace the falling damage with the solarian revelation <b>heavy landing</b>, which transfers that falling damage into your weapon, allowing you to strike someone with impossible force! It’s abilities like these that excite me as I imagine bold character’s shouting “Check this out” before pulling some absurd-yet-effective acrobatics.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9f753588-4217-4c39-9c09-bdb72bcac05e/061721_UrbanBody.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9f753588-4217-4c39-9c09-bdb72bcac05e/061721_UrbanBody.png" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A phentomite free runner leaping over a wall"></a>

                <h4>A Bonus for Every Biome</h4> 
                <p>And that’s just a taste of the class-specific options—each biome article includes even more! In <em>alaxy Exploration Manual</em> you’ll also find:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Aerobatic feats for aerial biomes</li> 
                 <li>Underwater weapons for aquatic biomes</li> 
                 <li>Rugged armor for arctic biomes</li> 
                 <li>Tough vehicles for traveling desert biomes</li> 
                 <li>New creature companions for forest and weird biomes</li> 
                 <li>Feats for blending into marsh biomes</li> 
                 <li>Earth spells for mastering mountain biomes</li> 
                 <li>Sniper rifles to show off in plains biomes</li> 
                 <li>Biotech augmentations to navigate space biomes</li> 
                 <li>Weapon fusions to defend yourself in subterranean biomes</li> 
                 <li>New feats to navigate and make friends in urban biomes</li> 
                 <li>Plus a ton of new gear for all occasions</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>So check out the Galaxy Exploration Manual, and open up infinite possibilities for your characters!</p>

                <h3>GEN CON ONLINE 2021</h3> 
                <p>As many of you have already heard, Paizo has elected not to attend Gen Con 2021 in person, though we’ve got lots of fun planned for Gen Con Online 2021.</p> 
                <p>The Gen Con Organizing Committee is dedicated to ensuring a smooth execution of online events and a large selection of scenarios and systems. We are proud to debut the two new multi-table interactive specials for Starfinder and Pathfinder Second Edition. While we aren’t at liberty to provide you with a ton of information about these two scenarios, we can confidently say you won’t want to miss them, and you should definitely consider playing both! </p> 
                <p>Online badge registration will open on June 27th, and badges for Gen Con Online are free. You will need to register for a badge to be able to acquire tickets for seats at virtual tables, so make sure you remember to snag your online badge! We will keep you updated with information regarding tickets and event registration as it becomes available. </p>

                <h3>PAX Unplugged</h3> 
                <p>We wish to note Paizo will not be attending this year's PAX Unplugged. We are awaiting news on whether the show will have an online component and will let our community know our plans to provide online programming once we know more. We expect to return to physical conventions in 2022. Thanks, and stay safe!</p>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Artist: Marko Horvatin</p> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s7?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-1-The-Second-Confirmation">Pathfinder Society Intro #1: The Second Confirmation</a>, by our own Thurston Hillman, is an introduction to the Pathfinder Society for 1st- and 2nd-level characters. In this adventure, the Society assigns the characters to a Confirmation, a mission designed as a “final test” for new Pathfinder agents. Their mission? Rescue another initiate who went missing during their own Confirmation! This adventure is repeatable, so it includes several randomized elements and some character choices that allow players to enjoy it multiple times. It should serve as an excellent introductory offering for many events for the foreseeable future.</p> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose">Pathfinder Society Intro #2: United in Purpose</a>, by veteran adventure author Brian Duckwitz, is intended as the follow-up to Intro #1, and is also for 1st- and 2nd-level characters. Now that they’ve been introduced to the Pathfinder Society as a whole and completed their Confirmation, the characters undertake short missions for each of the Society’s four major factions (Envoy’s Alliance, Grand Archive, Horizon Hunters, and Vigilant Seal). Like Intro #1, this scenario is repeatable and includes randomized elements to keep it fresh and fun. Two upcoming Pathfinder Bounty releases supplement this scenario with missions from the Society’s minor factions (Radiant Oath and Verdant Wheel). These bounties are also repeatable!</p> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-3">Pathfinder Society Intro #3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a> (also known as PFS #3-01), by Mike Kimmel, is the true introduction to the metaplot of Year 3. A group of Pathfinders at the Grand Lodge is handling a sudden deluge of troubling correspondence from lodges across the Inner Sea region when they learn of an urgent matter in Absalom requiring the Society’s immediate attention. As they tackle this mysterious dilemma, they uncover a disturbing truth—but to learn more, you’ll have to play the adventure, and to thwart the Society’s enemies, you’ll need to stick around for the rest of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p> 
                <p>This three-part, repeatable Intro arc provides enough experience to bring a brand-new character up to 2nd level while teaching the character (and the player) about the Pathfinder Society’s factions and objectives. Intros #1 and #2 are intended to serve this introductory role for new players for the foreseeable future, while each year’s Intro #3 will be a fresh scenario to introduce all players to the new season’s metaplot. </p> 
                <p>We hope these scenarios are fun, useful, and instructive. All three scenarios will launch at <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoh?PaizoCon-Europe-Online-2021-Tickets-GM&amp;fbclid=IwAR0Kwf7_C5NhJO0ERajzTomwzCsmCnmCoyon7D0EZA4Z5u17ZsIe4Xk7-k4">PaizoCon Europe Online 2021</a> (August 19–22), kicking off the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p> 
                <p>Come back next week for a preview of June’s scenario releases.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Are you lost, child?”</p> 
                <p>Hioba stared up at the golden leaves and the large golden trunk of one of Forest Agoyben’s famed Crackling Trees. The voice startled her, and she spun to face it. A small but powerful woman whose face she could not fully see in the shadows leaned against a tree a dozen paces away.</p> 
                <p>“I’m... uh, no. Actually, I was here to study these trees. You see, I am a student at the Magaambya and—”</p> 
                <p>“And you thought you’d learn something about these trees that might just explode out of nowhere?”</p> 
                <p>“Yes.” Hioba again marveled at the tree before her. The trunk had the same luster as actual gold and felt almost metallic when she touched it. She’d heard about it in school, but it seemed impossible to imagine such a hearty tree would simply... break.</p> 
                <p>The woman nodded. “Knowledge is good, but experience is truth. You know how the trees came to develop their ailment, yes? They taught you that at school?” The woman came closer but still hid most of her features in the forest’s shadows, where the light failed to penetrate fully. Hioba opened her mouth but stopped when the woman raised her hand.</p> 
                <p>“What they don’t teach you is this: Agohbindi the Splintering Child emerged from under the Vanji River twice as tall as that tree you’ve been staring at for the last hour.” Hioba leaned back, hands on hips, trying to envision the scale of the monster.</p> 
                <p>“It rose from the river and grasped its way to the sky. It had a beetle’s iridescent carapace but the hungering face and maw of a fiend. Its pincers could crush several blocks of Nantambu’s splendid buildings. It sought a meal and Nantambu was the closest, tastiest dish it was likely to find.</p> 
                <p>“Rovagug’s murderous progeny crashed through the forest. The Tempest-Sun Mages almost learned of the threat too late. Lucky for them a Magaambya student just like yourself tended to his herbal studies and witnessed the beginning of Agohbindi’s rampage. He sent a message to companions nearer to the city who relayed to the Tempest-Sun Mages what occurred.”</p> 
                <p>The woman paused. “Are you taking notes, my child? You are receiving quite the education here.” Hioba snatched a quill and her scroll from her pack and started writing. The woman chuckled and continued.</p> 
                <p>“Fewer than a dozen Tempest-Sun Mages responded, confident in their abilities, just as Azure Leopard had taught them to be. At first their confidence seemed well placed! Their first battle ritual created a storm, pulling the lightning out of the clouds and hurling it at Agohbindi. The gigantic bolt of electricity cleaved the Spawn of Rovagug cleanly in half.</p> 
                <p>“The mages congratulated each other for the quick victory, but their celebration was cut short, for the two halves of the beast’s foul body instantly formed into two smaller but identical versions of Agohbindi. The mages hurled bolt after bolt from their battle circle. Each bolt split its target in slightly smaller versions of the original spawn until they could get no smaller, at which point they simply continued to multiply.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <br> 
                <p>“The last act that group performed was sending a magical message to Azure Leopard and Old-Mage Jatembe, a plea for help. Then the teeth and magic of a thousand Agohbindis overwhelmed them.”</p> 
                <p>The woman paused and murmured something that sounded to Hioba like a prayer.</p> 
                <p>“Azure Leopard and Old-Mage Jatembe answered the call and arrived with nearly one hundred Tempest-Sun Mages. They all thought they were ready for the threat, but they were so incredibly wrong!</p> 
                <p>“Your books and your teachers will tell you they fought Agohbindi, but what they tell you is insufficient. Yes, they fought, but it wasn’t a mere battle—it was a grueling war. They fought with the Rough Beast’s monstrous child for days on end. The Tempest-Sun Mages fought at first from within the forest, but soon the forest contained as many Agohbindis as the plains hold blades of grass. So the mages took to the sky, harnessing the storm and the wind and the rain to at least slow the advancement of the ceaseless monstrosities. They used fire magic to melt the spawn, but the spawn simply reformed moments later.</p> 
                <p>“Azure Leopard and Jatembe spent most of their energy coordinating the Tempest-Sun Mages’ defenses, erecting powerful barriers that would take the creatures many hours to penetrate so that the group could search for solutions. Trying to protect the warriors in their care left them precious little time for strategy, but their dedication to protection prevented any other warrior mages from dying. Even then, many suffered severe wounds and none were the same.”</p> 
                <p>Hioba cleared her throat and looked up from her notes. “When did Jatembe trap Agohbindi? What do you know about that?”</p> 
                <p>The woman chuckled again.</p> 
                <p>“By accident! After several days of fighting and containment, the mages ran headlong into that fact we all now know: magic is infinite, but our capacity to wield it... is not. The Tempest-Sun Mages had tapped into their reserves and beyond. As they grew more exhausted, they became sloppy. Old-Mage Jatembe and his pupil found it progressively more taxing to protect the weary mages. In hours, Agohbindi in his multitude would have overwhelmed the amassed mages and moved onward to consume the Song-Wind City... and likely the entirety of Mwangi Expanse!</p> 
                <p>“Jatembe and Leopard were in the middle of conjuring a barrier of elemental ice for a group of mages retreating from the Agohbindi splinters in the forest. Out of exasperation, over the noise and rage of combat, Azure Leopard shouted to Jatembe: ‘Fighting Agohbindi is not like fighting an opponent, Old-Mage! It is like fighting a tide, like fighting water!’</p> 
                <p>“Just then, the teacher and pupil paused and looked at each other, each knowing what the other would say next. Child, what do they teach you about water at Magaambya?”</p> 
                <p>“You... don’t fight it?” Hioba answered nervously.</p> 
                <p>“Exactly! You don’t fight water. You help it flow, and then you let it flow into a container where you hold it. Leopard and Jatembe had been so busy fighting and defending that they had missed this obvious point. Jatembe let out such a loud and hysterical laugh that everyone who could hear it became anxious for him.</p> 
                <p>“‘My own teachings, remembered in the last hour, amazing!’ He laughed some more while weaving the spell he knew he needed to cast. People would have been surprised by his humor, except it was Old-Mage Jatembe. He was always a little unpredictable.” The woman shrugged.</p> 
                <p>“After a moment, Azure Leopard saw her teacher’s intent, and joined in with no prompting. Together their magic augmented the roots of the forest’s trees, which burst free from the soil. The pair sent out magical messages to the Tempest-Sun Mages to direct their energies into these roots. The magic roots stretched out of the soil, wrapping around each of the thousands of Agohbindi shards, holding them in place. Jatembe directed all the other warriors except Azure Leopard into the sky as he prepared the next stage.”</p> 
                <p>Hioba had stopped writing, absorbed in the mysterious woman’s story.</p> 
                <p>“Jatembe stretched his arms like a yawn, letting the earth’s energy flow into his body. He inhaled a breath bigger than Balumbdar, building up the energy in his hands and his staff. The other mages worked on a battle ritual to summon the largest bolt of lightning ever seen… before or since.</p> 
                <p>“When Jatembe finally exhaled, he sent magical fire into and through the roots. At that moment the Tempest-Sun Mages and Azure Leopard released their lightning, which snaked over and through the spawned multitudes. Before they could grow again, the fire melted the spawn fragments into ooze as they screeched in fury. The ooze seeped into the soil, where the web of roots covering the entire forest drank it up.</p> 
                <p>"When the screeching abated, Jatembe stopped the fire. He and the other mages drew the roots back into the earth. Agohbindi, which could not be destroyed, which flooded the forest like water, was absorbed, like water, into the soil.” The woman pointed at the tree Hioba had been studying. </p> 
                <p>“Into that tree, and the others like it.”</p> 
                <p>Hioba turned around to look at the tree again. “Is there something about the evil trapped within that makes the tree gold?” </p> 
                <p>“Ha, no. Jatembe just thought it might make Agohbindi <em>furious</em> to be trapped in something so beautiful.”</p> 
                <p>“Also... wait... how do you know so much about this? How do you know this story?” Hioba turned back to face the woman, who was donning an ornate leopard mask. Once the mask was on, she stepped out of the shadows and into the light.</p> 
                <p>“Aaaaah, and here I was, holding out high hopes for your powers of observation, child. I’ve given you the start; now keep with your studies. Agohbindi will surely need to be contained once more, someday.”</p> 
                <p>Hioba tried to speak, but Azure Leopard was gone.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>PaizoCon is a unique event for the Pathfinder community. We therefore want to share a massive and exciting update on the first board game set in the Pathfinder roleplaying game’s Age of Lost Omens setting: Pathfinder Arena.</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder Arena is a competitive game for 2 to 4 players, an epic clash between Pathfinder’s most iconic heroes and most fearsome monsters. Heroes must compete against the challenge posed by an entity called Arena until one champion remains. Although heroes cannot directly attack each other, they can use monsters to do so. While monsters never leave their initial tile, the board representing the Arena itself is in constant movement. Players can alter the Arena’s structure by pushing tiles orthogonally. Such movements can bring an opponent hero in range of a devastating attack by one or more monsters—a great way to score points in the game.</p> 
                <h3>Pathfinder Arena: Core Set Components</h3> 
                <p>The Pathfinder Arena core set features a terrific number of plastic miniatures: 4 iconic heroes (Valeros, Merisiel, Ezren, and Kyra) and 14 monsters (Minotaur, Ogre, Ettin, Fire Elemental, Medusa, Ankhrav, Troll, Velstrac, Erinyes, Blood Demon, Chimera, Wraith, Vampire, Frost Giant). The set will also contain more than 100 cards of features and items, 48 Arena tiles, over 300 tokens, and more!</p> 
                <p>All the miniatures will be compatible with the main series of miniatures dedicated to the Pathfinder roleplaying game. </p> 
                <p>Along with the rest of this news, perhaps most exciting is the release of the first official draft of the Pathfinder Arena rulebook. You can download it now from <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/" target="_blank">the Pathfinder Arena website</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Pathfinder Arena: Expansions</h3> 
                <p>You will also have the chance to expand your Pathfinder Arena experience well beyond the core set! As mentioned in our previous updates, we have run two surveys to let the community decide which heroes and monsters should be included in the expansions. As a result, the heroes expansion features Fumbus and Seoni, while the monsters expansion includes the Goblin Pyro, the Gargoyle, the Nightmare and the Mummy Pharaoh.</p> 
                <p>In addition to these two announced expansions, we have prepared a third expansion fully dedicated to the Age of Ashes Adventure Path! It features Belzamog, a Charau-ka, a Dragonshard, Nketiah, and a Skeletal Hellknight!</p> 
                <h3>Pathfinder Arena: Crowdfunding Campaign</h3> 
                <p>Pathfinder Arena will come to life thanks to a crowdfunding campaign that will kick off likely around October/November 2021. The platform hosting the campaign is yet to be determined.</p> 
                <p>What we do know is your day 1 bonus: a magnificent miniature of a Black Dragon! It will be available only for our Day-1 backers, so be sure to subscribe <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/" target="_blank">to our official page</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403722200813208" target="_blank">join our Facebook group</a> for updates on the official start date of the crowdfunding campaign and see all the aforementioned miniatures and components.</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Aaaaaand action! Who’s ready for an extreme casting call?! For today’s special broadcast, we’re here on scenic planet Kelikazord recruiting the next team of superstars for our mega-hit series, <em>Live Adventure Extreme!</em> Everything about this world, including the ground we’re standing on right now, is one hundred percent alive. Now that’s extreme! The weather’s mostly sunny, but we’ve got some cloud cover rolling in—our orbital scans tell us those green clouds are highly toxic gases. Good thing I don’t need to breathe, am I right? But you’re not here for a weather report, are you, dear viewers? It’s about time to meet our contestants. Let’s see if they have what it takes to become the next Extreme Adventurers! Alright, folks, why don’t you introduce yourselves to our audience back home? Contestant Number One, you’re up first. Tell us your name and why you want to be on the show.</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #1:</b> (Speaking alien language)</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> What’s that? Wait a minute, the translator’s not working. Wazasha, get the field-tech team on this ASAP, will you? </p> 
                 <p><b>Wazasha:</b> I’m already on it.</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Excellent! I knew I could count on you.</p> 
                 <p><b>Wazasha:</b> Watch where you’re pointing those finger guns, boss.</p> 
                 <p><em>(Zo! laughs)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Haha, safety first, you got it. Now where was I? Right! As I was saying, today we’re here for an eeeeeeexclusive first-contact scenario with some up-and-coming reality stars from the Vast looking to break into the Pact Worlds scene! That’s right! We’re here with three representatives of cultures never before encountered in the Pact Worlds, folks, and they’re ready to show you what they’re made of!</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #2:</b> (Speaking alien language)</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Oh, I can tell they’re building up to something big! Contestant Number Two here seems like a real pro, you can just tell by the way they move that they’ve got some serious combat training. Ex-military, maybe?</p> 
                 <p><b>Wazasha (muffled):</b> They’re just standing around, Zo!</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Let’s get the cameras in there, then. That might spice things up.</p> 
                 <p><em>(Buzzing and whirring sounds, followed by a series of clicks)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> See now, what did I tell you? </p> 
                 <p><em>(Deep rumbling and growling sounds)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>All Aliens:</b> (Yelling in alien language)</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> —that thing! </p> 
                 <p><em>(Loud bestial roar)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Wazasha:</b> What is that?</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> That, Wazasha, is the talent! Feast your eyes upon today’s obstacle, folks. As tall as a Vercite skyscraper, it’s a horrific sight beyond your wildest nightmares! Look at those horns, those teeth! It could tear any of us in half just like snapping a toothpick. Oh, it’s extreme, all right. And our three brave contestants are going to take it down!</p> 
                 <p><em>(Roaring, followed by frantic yelling in alien language, grunts, and combat sounds)</em></p>

                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Oh, look at that. Number Two’s charging right in there. It’s a good thing they’ve got that armor, because those teeth look nasty. Contestants One and Three are setting up for some extreme teamwork. Whoa! Three boosted One right up to smack the beast in the face with her blade. Ouch, that looked like it hurt! Our three contestants just scored first blood! </p> 
                 <p><em>(Howling, then a resounding thud)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> The beast retaliates! Wow, Contestant Number Three went flying. I hope she’s okay! We’ll have our medical team take a look after the fight. Oh, there goes One ripping into the monster’s leg. Way to fight back, One!</p> 
                 <p><em>(Grunting and yelling in alien language.)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Wazasha:</b> Translator’s back online.</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Excellent! Now we can get some extreme reactions from our contestants. Alright, Number Two, can you tell me about your team’s combat strategy?</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #2 (panting):</b> I thought this was a casting call!</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #1 (wincing):</b> Yeah, we prepared a traditional Kelikan opera for—oh no, it’s coming, dodge!</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #2:</b> Thanks! It almost took my head off with that hit.</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #1:</b> We thought we were auditioning for a variety show.</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> What an extreme miscommunication! But I’m sure Kelikan opera is lovely. Why don’t you go ahead and share that performance with the audience?</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #2:</b> We need Uaya to sing the bassline, and she’s out cold. </p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> Wazasha?</p> 
                 <p><b>Wazasha (sighing heavily):</b> I’m already on it, boss.</p> 
                 <p><em>(Sound of a trigger clicking)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #3:</b> Huh? What happened? Did we get the part?</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #1:</b> The smiling dead man wants us to sing now. </p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #3:</b> While we’re fighting this thing?!</p> 
                 <p><b>Aliens #1 and #2:</b> Yes.</p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> You betcha! Three, you should be feeling pretty spry right about now. My assistant just shot you with AbadarCorp’s new “Get Up ‘N’ Go” serum, a healing and enhancing vitamin cocktail, available at pharmacy superstores near you! Alright Contestant Number Three, hit us with that beautiful bassline.</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #3 (clearing throat):</b> Here goes. And a one, two, three—</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien Beast:</b> If they actually start singing, I’m done here. </p> 
                 <p><b>Alien #2:</b> Wait, the monster we’re fighting can talk, too?</p> 
                 <p><b>Alien Beast:</b> And how do you think I negotiated my contract? I possess the powers of speech, but it seems you drew conclusions about my intellect based on my physical appearance. How rude. Now listen here, Zo!, my agent said I could be on your show if I beat up these weaklings. I took one of them out and you woke her up to belt out showtunes? Preposterous. I’m calling my agent.</p> 
                 <p><em>(Sounds of alien beast stomping off)</em></p> 
                 <p><b>Zo!:</b> What a wild turn of events! A ferocious fight to the death gives way to a surprise musical performance, starring our three remaining contestants. You don’t want to miss it, folks. But first, let’s hear a word from our sponsor: AbadarCorp, makers of the new “Get Up ‘N’ Go” serum!</p>

                <p>When I was approached about writing the Father’s Day blog, I accepted right away, knowing it would be relatively straightforward to come up with some clever gaming puns or some Father’s Day gifts in the form of silly magic items. (What dad doesn’t want a pair of argyle socks that magically clean and fold themselves?) Over the coming days, as I reflected on my five years of fatherhood (and counting), and on my own father, trying to come up with more ideas for a roleplaying game-related Father’s Day blog, I realized jokes were my easy way out. Surely, I thought, I could write something deep and meaningful about my first RPG session with my five-year-old son. So, this past weekend, I sat down to plan a game for him. That also would not turn out exactly as I planned.</p> 
                <p>I felt intense pressure to get it right. I wanted something great to write about for the blog, of course, but I also needed it to be right for my son. After all, I thought, roleplaying games have deeply impacted my own life. My brother and I remain close, even into adulthood, in no small part because of roleplaying games. I met my spouse and my dearest friends through roleplaying games. Playing and writing those games has gotten me through many difficult times. I’ve seen tabletop games have a similar impact on countless others. I had to be a great dad and get it right for my son.</p> 
                <p>I faltered. How could I ever meet such expectations? Thinking of roleplaying games and fatherhood reminded me that my brother and I started playing right around the time our own father began to have less presence in our lives. This only increased the pressure I was putting on myself. At a time in my life when I most needed a father, roleplaying games filled the void in a way. Roleplaying games helped me learn collaboration, cooperation, creativity, resilience, compassion—and even provided an outlet for pent up emotions. (Speaking of things we can learn from our dads. Ha.)</p> 
                <p>The day before I’d planned to run my son’s first session, I was tired, dinner was over, and it was time to play before getting ready for bed. I wasn’t thinking about the blog, and my complex emotions about fatherhood meant I had no plans for the game. When my son and I went to play, one of the most surreal experiences of my life unfolded. He asked if I wanted to build a maze with him using some magnetic tiles—one of his favorite toys. Of course, I said, but you’ll need to show me how. He laid out a basic floor plan. He put up some walls. I watched as he carefully considered the placement of each tile, occasionally changing his mind about the direction of a given corridor, or where the entrance would be. He blocked off one of the paths and told me that’s where the bad guys hide. You had to sneak past, or they’d come out and get you. He went to get his toy cars—they’d fit perfectly in the maze. He put in a few bad guys. He put another in the deepest part of the maze and told me I had to rescue it. He gave me another car, said it was me, and picked up one for himself. He drove through the maze, arrived at an intersection, and asked me which way we should go. Your turn, Papa. We went through the maze. We laughed when I was too loud, and the bad guy popped out of the wall to get me. I escaped and drove around until the bad guy got lost in his own maze. Good job, Papa, but you should be more quiet next time. We went and rescued the car. We made it out before the bad guy found us—but just barely!</p> 
                <p>Without ever having learned himself, my son taught me to play an RPG on a whim, with a map and secret doors and all. He had a story in mind—one he came up with on his own—and we worked together to tell the story. He taught me to try again even when I messed up. He taught me to take turns and look out for each other. When he suggested I fight the bad guy car, and I asked if we could be gentle instead, he respected the boundary I set. He told me that was a good idea and helped me find a creative solution. </p> 
                <p>This was not so different from the way we usually play, but with the uncanny similarities to sitting down for a game of Pathfinder or Starfinder, I was stunned. Thinking on it, I didn’t know exactly how my son learned all those things—collaboration, compassion, creativity—especially when his access to other adults over the past year has been far more limited than usual. Surely, he learned a bit from me, but also from his mother, friends, grandparents, teachers, and from aunts and uncles. As I tucked him in and he told me, “Papa, I love you, you’re my best friend,” I was somewhat confident he learned to spontaneously express his feelings because I’d modeled it for him. I didn’t think I could take full credit for all of the other things, but I was certain that roleplaying games helped me become the sort of father who could raise a good man. Of course, I still didn’t have good ideas for his first “real” session.</p> 
                <p>But I sure did know what I was going to write about for the Father’s Day blog.</p>

                <p>A special image will indicate the scenarios that directly influence the Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot. Scenarios without this branding are stand-alone adventures that don’t tie directly to the events of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. The introduction to the metaplot is an adventure by Mike Kimmel (hey, that’s me!), titled “Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.” It’s a full-length scenario for characters of levels 1–4.</p>

                <p>The Year of Shattered Sanctuaries debuts at PaizoCon Europe Online 2021 (August 19–22), along with two other full-length introductory scenarios for characters of levels 1–2, much like the launch of Starfinder Society Year 4 at PaizoCon Online in May. Stay tuned for more information, and some answers to frequently asked questions, in next week’s blog!</p>

                <h3>Alexi Greer</h3> 
                <p>"Hello! My name is Alexi and I wrote the technology section for the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. This book is full to the brim with worldbuilding deep-dives, and I had a blast writing for such a fascinating subject. My other works for Paizo can be found in the Starship Operations Manual and the upcoming Starfinder Society Quest Pack: A Waltz Through Myriad Worlds.</p> 
                <p>I live in the wild, untamed lands known as Orlando, Florida. When I’m not writing as a freelancer, I’m organizing Society events and volunteering at local conventions. My other hobbies include historical sword fighting, dice collecting, and reptile keeping. Despite all of those things sounding suspiciously dragon-related, I am unfortunately human. Not-so-unfortunately, I share my living space with two furry overlords: a tailless cat named Hecate, and a tail-included cat named Mystique.</p> 
                <p>I’ve worn a lot of hats in the tabletop industry, from game store management to card warehouse stocker. Writing has been my favorite hat, though. It’s not just a chance to create something new, but an opportunity to help readers do the same with their own games. I hope when you read the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> you find new ideas and new ways of viewing old topics. Should you ever see me at a convention, feel free to say, “Hi” and tell me about your Starfinder adventures!"</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>John Curtin</h3> 
                <p>My name is John Curtin and I’m thrilled to be making content for Paizo! Besides being part of the absolutely amazing team that worked on the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, I’ve contributed the Opulus Ambassador to Starfinder <em>Adventure Path #30: Puppets Without Strings</em>, created the astriapi and ravenous drakes for <em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em>, and co-wrote the repeatable <rm>
                  Starfinder Society Scenario #2-19: Truth Keepers with Natalie Kertzner. I started playing TTRPGs on a middle school bus ride where a friend introduced me to the idea of a story I could interact with, and my bookish brain immediately latched on and hasn’t let go since! I’ve been casually writing adventures and characters, off and on, for the 20-some-odd years since, and love sharing stories with tables of fellow adventurers and story-tellers. All of this culminated at PaizoCon 2019, where a highly goofy Twitter side project and a chance introduction to Joe Pasini culminated in a follow-up message post-con where I apologized for being an awkward dolt and suggested that I of course would be thrilled to write for Starfinder, even if wasn’t the impression that spilled out of my mouth while I was busy being starstruck from meeting a real Paizo employee in the flesh. The rest, as they say, is history!

                <p>When I’m not gaming or writing, my wife and I love to explore the outdoors, try new cuisine, and check out museums and live performances of all stripes.

                <p>Hey, y’all! You may know me from my time at Paizo in various roles. In the two years since I’ve become a substitute paraprofessional and have undergone a total creative reset. With some encouragement from my friends and former coworkers, I took the opportunity to contribute to <em>Alien Archive 4</em> and the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I have a deep love of the natural world and sharing all I can about it with others. Writing up the desert biome entry prompted diving into all I could find about the earth's own fantastic and weird arid ecosystems, and if anyone ever wants to talk about those plants, rocks, and critters, I'm 100% down! Lately, I get outside with my sweet pittie-lab mix, Sagan, maintain more than 50 houseplants, take pictures and video, and work on my incredibly laggy <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> island.

                <p>Hi, I'm Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, regularly credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving (nov/nov), and I'm a freelance designer! I wrote the mechanic, solarian, and vanguard class options you'll find in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I'm also an active participant in Starfinder Society as a four-nova GM, and a regular contributor to design work for several third-party publishers. When I'm not writing for Paizo I'm usually working with Legendary Games on their Stellar Options line (among other things), helping Storm Bunny Studios with the Starfinder conversion of the World of Alessia campaign setting, and advocating for queer liberation in the city of Chicago.

                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full time freelance author. I started freelancing in 2019 with <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-03: The Withering World</em> and over the last two years I have contributed to just over 30 projects for Paizo, including the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #39: The Gilded Cage</em> (volume 6 of the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path), and seven organized play scenarios. For the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> I wrote the technomancer and witchwarper class options, the alignment world attribute, and (my personal favorite) the background section, which is a series of random tables to help players create or further develop their character's backgrounds, life experiences, and relationships. Contributing to the Galaxy Exploration Manual was a wonderful experience and I couldn’t be prouder of the final product. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do.

                <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> 
                <p>Hello! I'm Kendra, and I've been freelancing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for about 5 years now. I wrote the airborne biome, mystic connections, operative exploits, and the NPC toolbox for the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I really enjoyed working on all those sections, but my favorite part was probably the food sidebar of the airborne biome. Adding in little details like food, cultural traditions, and aphorisms can make a setting come alive and feel like a living world outside the game table, so I always try to work those in where possible, whether writing or GMing.</p> 
                <p>Other Paizo projects I've worked on recently include <em>PFS Scenario #2-15: A Dirge for Sarkoris</em>; the caligni, maftet and scalescribe in <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>; and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #37: The White Glove Affair</em> (volume 6 of the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path)—which also involved some food research, funnily enough. I have a few other cool things in the works as well, both in Pathfinder- and Starfinder-land, and will hopefully be able to say more about those soon!</p> 
                <p>When I'm not writing or playing TTRPGs, I can be found reading (current obsession: the October Daye books by Seanan McGuire), playing video games (<em>Dishonored 2</em> right now, or <em>Animal Crossing</em> when I need something relaxing), or baking in my very tiny kitchen. You can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS" target="_blank">@KendraLS</a> for cat pictures, updates on my PF/SF projects and fiction, and occasional rambling.</p>

                <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> 
                <p>Приветствую вас, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a bit of a regular contributor to these blogs. You may recognize me from past works such as <em>Lost Omen Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia), <em>Pathfinder Scenario #1-15: Blooming Catastrophe</em>, and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #31: Waking the Worldseed</em> (the Hibb Gazetteer). When not seeing how much I can mix satiric comedy and cosmic horror, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator, specializing in diplomatic history. I’ve published a book, even, which some people have read.</p> 
                <p>For the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, I’m responsible for the Starship Toolbox, most notably the <em>Known Variable</em> (working title: <em>The N-1-MH</em>), and the Accord section, which means that if you ever want to use Leadership in Starfinder, you may thank and/or blame me.</p> 
                <p>Today though, I also want to mention another project I’m working on: <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is a setting based around the idea of what happens when a high-cyberpunk technological society collapses very, very thoroughly, and then a thousand or so years later you have a nice, swashbuckling pseudo-Renaissance city state built on the ruins (literally). Check out our Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>, and keep an eye out for upcoming product—our first kickstarter project (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/luminantage/fauna-of-the-luminant-age" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/luminantage/fauna-of-the-luminant-age</a>) will be delivered soon, which means the second one is on the horizon. Stay tuned! You can find more of my work at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA" target="_blank">@LuminantA</a>.</p>

                <h3>Shahreena Shahrani (she/her)</h3> 
                <p><em>Marhaba</em>/hello fellow Pathfinders and Starfinders! My name is Shahreena. My works are often inspired by world languages, cultures, and traditions. I’ve contributed to several projects for Starfinder; more recently, the Religion section in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. I was excited about contributing to this section--especially, the adventure hooks--as some were inspired by the zany interactions among characters of my local lodge. (Buckeye Lodge, y’all are awesome!) In 2020–2021, besides playing online with many amazing inter/national Pathfinder and Starfinder players and sharing my love of GIFs with nufriends, I embarked on a new creative journey. I started adapting world languages, folktales, and legends on YouTube. If you’re interested in seeing these works, please visit my YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcZR32EUW9qlAgHaQxfuiew" target="_blank">Storytime with Auntie Nina</a>. Other interests include travelling, writing children’s literature, reading/editing my husband’s fiction, spoiling my cat (Namira), and eating Jeni’s Ice Cream. Oh yea, my favorite Jeni’s flavor is midwest whiskey &amp; pecans.</p>

                <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3> 
                <p>Simone D. Sallé (she/they) has been a freelance author for more than three years, and an editor for over 5; they're currently contracted full-time as an editor with Paizo. After their author debut in <em>Alien Archive 3</em>, their writing has appeared in several Paizo books, including the upcoming <em>Secrets of Magic</em> and <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> (additional titles can be found on their site at <a href="http://wildwoodediting.com/credits" target="_blank">wildwoodediting.com/credits</a>). Their love of stark, snowy winters made writing the arctic section for <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> a joy, and they hope you feel cold reading it.</p> 
                <p>Simone’s always down to discuss book recommendations, en dashes, and conscious language on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/virsamajor">@virsamajor</a> or Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wildwoodedits/" target="_blank">@wildwoodedits</a>. When not writing or editing, they can be found devouring fantasy and sci-fi library books, playing a vesk android pilot (#FlyFreeorPaizo) or an arctic scientist (Subnautica Below Zero), or mushroom-spotting on hikes with their Disreputable Dog, Penny Kibeth. </p>

                <h3>Abigail Slater (she/her)</h3> 
                <p>I have been writing stories since I was five, and recently have been lucky to be included in several exciting Paizo projects. Before that, I wrote for local outlets such as <em>The Northern Light</em> and <em>Edible Alaska</em>. In 2014 I was honored to win the Hot Key Books' Young Writer's Prize. Writing for Starfinder opened my eyes to how diverse the community of tabletop game writers is, as well as made me realize how limitless the genre truly can be. My hobbies include running, squishing my cats, and playing <em>Talisman</em> way past my bedtime. </p> <!--<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com"><img width=300 src="https://cdn.paizo.com" hspace="5" alt=""></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>-->

But when their rickety starbus breaks down with mere hours left in the journey, the musicians will have to pack up their instruments and hitch a ride or two through the asteroids of the Diaspora. Will the power of music help them get to the gig on time, or will they miss their shot at making it big?</p>

                <h2>OPA Musings</h2> 
                <p itemprop="description">I thought about writing “no musings, head empty, only PaizoCon” in this space but <s>Tonya told me I couldn’t</s> I decided against it. Instead, I’m going to take this space to give a shout-out to some people who went above and beyond in making PaizoCon Online happen this year. Please note that I’m writing this two days <em>before</em> the convention due to deadlines, so if I forgot someone, I can still blame Convention Brain.</p> 
                <p>First up, the PaizoCon Online Organizing Committee: <b>David Peevers, Ivis Flanagan, and Mike Bramnik</b>, who volunteered days of their lives (probably weeks, if we total them up) to coordinating all our GMs for Organized Play games. The event <em>literally</em> would not have happened without the three of them, and they all deserve a tropical vacation somewhere.</p> 
                <p>Next, our HQ volunteers for PaizoCon Online: <b>Aerine Caerwyn, Barb Crase, Nicole Heits, Katrina Hennessy, Sebastian Hirsch, Alex Lenz, Rich Lowe (Stunt Monkey), Elizabeth “Betsy” Nold, and Betty Osthoff</b>. You’ll recognize these names as “those people who were everywhere on the Discord server,” as they got walk-ups seated, coordinated with GMs, and just generally made sure all the machinery was running smoothly. <b>Eric Nielsen</b> gets a special shout-out to himself, as he programmed the reporting tool used by our GMs to report their games. <br> [Tonya’s Note: We really couldn’t pull off an event without all our volunteers—the organizing committee, GMs, and HQ—and we thank them from the deepest depths of our hearts! A huge huzzah to them for stepping up and providing over 800 games to our attendees! I’m honored to be part of such a fabulous community!]</p> 
                <p>Finally, I want to recognize some of our Paizo staffers. First, I want to thank <b>Aaron Shanks</b> and <b>Leah Beckelman</b>, our Marketing team, put together the streams, blogs, and emails for the weekend, as well as <b>John Feil</b> for the giveaways you all enjoyed. <b>Linda Zayas-Palmer, Thurston Hillman, Jenny Jarzabski,</b> and <b>Mike Kimmel</b> are my colleagues on the Organized Play Team who worked their tails off to get scenarios out to our GMs <em>much</em> earlier than ever before. Finally, a big thank you to all our Paizo staff who moderated or participated in panels and Discord discussions; the staff participation is what makes PaizoCon what it is.<br> [Tonya’s Note: And a huge thanks to Alex Speidel for taking on the bulk of the Org Play planning and organizing so I could focus on pulling things together. He is amazing and an integral part of our operations! To Alex and all the Paizo staff for doing such a fantastic job on PaizoCon, hooray!]</p> 
                <p>All right, that’s enough words from me. Let’s do this again next year, yeah?</p> 
                <h2>Starfinder Society Year 4</h2> 
                <p>Last weekend at PaizoCon Online, we launched Year 4 of Starfinder Society! Remember that <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoe?Starfinder-Society-Year-4-Rule-Changes">the rules in the latest Guide update</a> are now in effect, and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shng?Starfinder-Society-Update-Year-4-Program-Changes">all scenarios played from this point on should not award Fame, but do award Achievement Points</a> for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                <p>We hope you enjoyed the new scenarios at PaizoCon Online, and we look forward to unraveling the mysteries of the Year of the Data Scourge!</p> 
                <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 3</h2> 
                <p>Now that Starfinder Society’s new storyline has launched, our attention is turning to Pathfinder Society. We encourage Pathfinder Society players to read the blog next Thursday to learn exciting news about Year 3!</p> 
                <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>In the lead-up to PaizoCon Online, we put our various noses to the grindstone to get plenty of new content sanctioned for play! The following content has been sanctioned in the past month:</p> 
                <p><b><a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society (second edition)</a></b></p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a></li> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ug?Pathfinder-OneShot-2-Dinner-at-Lionlodge"><em>One-Shot #2: Dinner at Lionlodge</em></a></li> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a></li> 
                </ul> 
                <p><b><a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society</a></b></p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk">The Devastation Ark Adventure Path</a></li> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie"><em>Fly Free or Die Adventure Path</em></a></li> 
                 <li><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027uo?Starfinder-OneShot-1-Band-on-the-Run"><em>One-Shot #1: Band on the Run</em></a></li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Do note that while Chronicle Sheets and reporting are now available for the Starfinder Adventure Paths, their character options are not yet; we aim to have these out by the end of the month, but they are taking just a little bit longer due to PaizoCon preparations.</p> 
                <p>Next on our agenda are <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse"><em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> Adventure Path</a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em> Adventure Path</a> for Pathfinder Society (second edition), the character options from <em>Fly Free or Die</em> and <em>Devastation Ark</em>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual"><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026l2?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight"><em>Junker’s Delight</em></a> for Starfinder Society, and the outstanding Pathfinder Society (first edition) content. Now that we’re caught up with the content in both active programs, we hope to continue sanctioning at or near the product release dates going forward.</p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins and Order of the Wayfinder</h2> 
                <p>At the end of PaizoCon Online, we gave out several Campaign Coins to exemplary volunteers. These volunteers have gone above and beyond the call of duty, and are recognized with a metal coin and an updated Organized Play ID number.</p> 
                <p>Jared Thaler &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>842</b><br> Mark Koopman &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>843</b><br> Eric Nielsen &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>844</b><br> Michael Tracey &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>845</b></p> 
                <p>In addition, each year we select one person to receive the Order of the Wayfinder. This award recognizes a volunteer whose efforts on a particular project merit the highest honor the Society can give. We consult with the previous recipients to make our determination.</p> 
                <p>For 2020, we have awarded the Order of the Wayfinder to <b>Jesse Davis</b>, RVC of the Online region. Without Jesse’s work setting up the Online region, we never would have made it through the transition into online play during the pandemic. He has been a tireless advocate for online play, and we’re happy to grant him this award, as well as Organized Play ID <b>105</b>.</p> 
                <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve their fifth milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the fifth milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                <p>Two GMs received their fifth star in the past month. In addition, we are pleased to announce our first 5-Glyph GM for Pathfinder Society (second edition)!</p> 
                <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Erika Emrick, Dave Williamson<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Eric Nielsen</p> 
                <p>Congratulations to our new 5-Star and 5-Glyph GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com.">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                <p>Last week, we posted <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoh?PaizoCon-Europe-Online-2021-Tickets-GM">an update on PaizoCon Online Europe</a>. If you’re interested in GMing or playing at this event, where we’ll be launching Year 3 of Pathfinder Society, check out that post!</p> 
                <p>In addition, we’ve got a new shiny page for you: our brand new <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Paizo Conventions calendar</a>! This page will list any convention that has filed for event support. Clicking on the event will list its location, website, and more, just like we used to in this blog. If there’s an event not listed there, get in touch with the coordinator and ask them to file for support from us!</p> 
                <p>Come back to the blog next week for news about Year 3 of Pathfinder Society. Until then, Explore! Report! Cooperate! and start earning that Starfinder AcP!</p>

But what if that’s not the kind of adventure you like to run or play in? What if you want something more open… where the players can go where they want, making the story up themselves as they explore and interact with newly-discovered NPCs and mysterious creatures? What if you want to leave the “theme park” style adventure for something more like a “sandbox”?</p>

What if you want something more open… where the players can go where they want, making the story up themselves as they explore and interact with newly-discovered NPCs and mysterious creatures? What if you want to leave the “theme park” style adventure for something more like a “sandbox”?</p> 
                <p>I’m very happy to say: the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> is the book you’ve been waiting for.</p> 
                <p>When Joe Pasini, lead developer of the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, asked me to write the Sandbox Adventures chapter for this book, I was both excited and intimidated. Making a sandbox campaign is a tremendous logistical challenge, but it’s also highly rewarding—as any of you who have played in sandbox games can attest. And because sandbox-style games have a long history in our hobby, there’s a lot of advice on this topic out there already, much of it written by simply brilliant creators. My job was clear: to take the best of that advice and then fine-tune it to the unique qualities and attributes of the Starfinder RPG.</p> 
                <br>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>To take one example, Ray Winninger’s <em>Dungeoncraft</em> series of essays (originally published in Dragon magazine from 1997—1999) is packed with great advice on making sandbox settings and adventures. In those articles Winninger created an entire fantasy setting from scratch, just to show us all how it is done (and then, when he was finished, he went back to the beginning and did it again, an effort only interrupted when Paizo began to publish Dragon). You’ll see some of Winninger’s advice—like giving every NPC, location, and object you create for your setting a secret which the PCs can discover—in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. But not all advice is useful for every RPG; when discussing the ideal number of players a GM should recruit, Winninger suggested, “you'll want to limit yourself to eight or ten players as a general rule.” Some RPGs work great with 8-10 players, but Starfinder isn’t really designed for that; all our advice on encounters and challenge rating is based around groups half that size—and many of us have trouble finding even four players, let alone 10! </p> 
                <p>Ron Lundeen—whom most of you already know as a developer on Pathfinder and author of many adventures for both that game and Starfinder—also lent me his experience and knowledge. Ron has written extensively about the incredible challenge that sandbox games present to GMs; a GM can easily fall into the trap of thinking they have to prepare every possible location the player characters might go, and that level of preparation takes so long that the game itself never happens. And if this is a challenge in a fantasy RPG where characters are limited to wherever their horses or ships can take them, imagine how much worse the problem becomes when the PCs have a Drift engine, and any planet in the galaxy is only a single Drift jump away! How does the GM prepare, when the PCs can go anywhere?</p> 
                <p>The answer is, of course, “they don’t.” Instead, the GM gates some adventure locations behind other locations, nesting one sandbox inside the next. So, for example, the PCs might be exploring an ancient alien ruin—their first sandbox—when they discover coordinates to other ruins on the other planets in the star system, worlds they had no reason to visit… until now. And the GM can steer the PCs by making some adventure locations obviously more hazardous or more difficult to get to—which will probably prompt the players into putting those locations off for a while, at least until they gain a level or two. The players still have plenty of choices; in fact, by reducing the choices from “an infinite galaxy” to something like three or four—and giving those remaining choices some specific details that the PCs can rely on to make informed choices—the GM can actually help the players avoid decision paralysis. Any Paizo designer will tell you: sometimes too many choices is as bad, or worse, than no choices at all. And then, when the players do decide where to go, you can use the tools in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (perhaps with a little assist from the <em>Deck of Many Worlds</em>) to actually make those settings, often with help from your own players!</p> 
                <p>Beyond advice for how to create basic sandbox-storytelling structures for your game, there’s so much more in this chapter of the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>. You’ll find advice on reskinning creatures—so even if you’re creating a brand new setting, you don’t have to create all the alien creatures yourself—and how to get started, by creating a home base with a steady cast of NPCs whom the PCs can go to for healing, crafting, and pawning their loot. Our game is unique in its particular combination of science and fantasy, so there’s advice for combining both in your setting to make it really feel like Starfinder. You’ll even find advice on building random encounter tables; we don’t use random encounters much in Starfinder Adventure Paths or modules, because they’re a bit antithetical to the structure of an Adventure Path. It’s hard to predict what level the PCs will be at any given point in an adventure if the PCs are having random encounters and gaining a variable amount of XP. But random encounters are key to sandbox adventures, where the PCs level up at their own pace and can often find themselves facing creatures far too deadly for the group’s level. </p> 
                <p>The <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> shows you how all of these tricks work by providing specific examples: a sandbox setting called the Alqet system, built from the ground up for this book. Alqet’s got NPCs, secrets, clues to those secrets, multiple adventure sites, sandboxes nested inside other sandboxes, and even a random encounter table. Sidebars walk you through the creation of Alqet one step at a time, a blueprint for you to use as you create your own sandbox campaign</p> 
                <p>But that’s not all! We added support for other genres too, from cyberpunk and hard sci-fi to high science fantasy settings like <em>She-Ra</em> or <em>Masters of the Universe</em>. You’ll find advice on building settings, campaigns, and adventures for military sci-fi, post-apocalyptic stories, parallel worlds and time travel, space westerns, and even planetary survival stories like <em>The Martian</em>. Some of these genres are more suited to sandbox adventures than others, but Starfinder can do them all!</p> 
                <p>And I can’t wait for you to read it.</p>
