| summary  = This illustration depicts a female kitsune. She has bright, white fur with red markings on her cheeks, forehead, and the tips of her nine tails. She wears a sheer, dusty grey-blue dress that has silver accents and fittings (like shoulder guards, and silver ribs like a corset; see reference). In one hand, she has a silver and blue wand with a star and moon motif. Her other hand is stroking a small, pale, white and blue dragon (an east Asian dragon shape, more like a snake) that’s coiled up on her shoulders. It has a ruff of fur around its head, white like the kitsune’s.
