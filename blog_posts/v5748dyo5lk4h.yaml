  >The <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Tales Character Deck</em></a> required the most research of any of the decks.\
  \ The <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder Tales</a> line includes dozens of\
  \ novels and short stories, and a veritable digital mountain of web fiction. At\
  \ one point I had forty tabs and three ebooks open as I scoured through all of the\
  \ Tales for our best cards. Surprisingly, in that immense field full of amazing\
  \ options, the team picked three characters almost immediately.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-VarianTokenBack.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Let's give a hand for our lovely crew. Maybe two handsâ€”Celeste\
  \ seems to be missing hers.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>I've been a fan of Dave Gross's\
  \ Radovan and Varian for years. We've managed to sneak his work into <a href=\"\
  /blog/v5748dyo5lhs8\">Season of the Righteous</a> and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbi?Summoner-Class-Deck\"\
  ><em>Summoner Class Deck</em></a>, and he happily helped us out with this set, writing\
  \ the flavor text for his characters.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  ></a> \n      <p>\"Some choose to wield the sword, others the grimoire. I note that\
  \ we have two hands.\"</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Count Varian can't memorize spells\
  \ in the normal fashion. Thankfully, he's more than willing to throw money at solving\
  \ that problem, and has years of fencing expertise as backup. He's also a renowned\
  \ noble and ambassador of Cheliax, a graduate of the Acadamae, and a Pathfinder\
  \ Society Venture-Captain. He's done fairly well, if he does say so himself.</p>\

  \ much I like to look good.\"</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Radovan's a wise-mouthed\
  \ hellspawn, ready to literally jump into the fire to save his boss, Varian. Fortunately,\
  \ the devil Norge keeps Radovan from burning. Less fortunately, the veritable host\
  \ of devils whispering temptations to Radovan are just waiting for their opportunity\
  \ to take control of his body, burst out into the world, or turn him into a gateway\
  \ to Hell. Radovan really does have all the luck.</p> \n     <p>The deck also includes\
  \ several signature boons from Radovan and Varian's adventures. I imagine basically\
  \ all players of Varian will want Arnisant to accompany them. Just look at this\
  \ face:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Arnisant.jpg\"\

  \ to a fault.\"</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The third character was selected almost\
  \ as quickly, as we laid out a slew of major characters and images, and Mike quickly\
  \ said something like: \"And here's a bunch of other characters and THE LUNAR NAGA\
  \ WE'RE GOING TO MAKE.\" Artist Eric Belisle really did an amazing job on Celeste\
  \ and the team immediately agreed we had to bring her to life.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ adorable puppies.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>I really wanted to highlight the\
  \ synergy of characters from the same Tales, so that you weren't just picking the\
  \ best mechanics, but had a genuine reason to keep Hrym united with Rodrick or Torius\
  \ Vin with his crew, or Zae and Keren Rhinn with Appleslayer. Also, Mike threatened\
  \ to shank anyone who stood in the way of Appleslayer's inclusion in the deck.</p>\

  ></a> \n      <p>No previously existing allies were included in the making of this\
  \ deck.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of course, some of these folks are amazing all\
  \ on their own. The Tales deck includes some of the best allies we've ever made.\
  \ We expect fans of Drelm from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9reo?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Character-AddOn-Deck\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask Character Add-On Deck</em></a> will like Elyana, who appears alongside\
  \ Drelm in the novel <a href=\"/products/btpy8iqp?Plague-of-Shadows\"><em>Plague\
  \ of Shadows</em></a>.</p> \n     <p>But don't imagine that the <i>23 all-new allies</i>\
  \ are the only new boons in the Tales deck. There are plenty more, including legendary\
  \ weapons and tomes of arcane and powerful lore.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Sometimes you just need to find a really scary book. And steal\
  \ it.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>A lot of these boons interact with specific allies;\
  \ for example, the ally Eando Kline will let you recharge that Wayfinder from your\
  \ discard pile.</p> \n     <p>The hope and goal was always that any Pathfinder Tales\
  \ fan would have no regrets adding this class deck to each and every set. And maybe\
  \ a few card players can get some great plays out of the cards, then seek out the\
  \ stories that spawned them.</p> \n     <p>Keith Richmond<br> <i>Adventure Card\
