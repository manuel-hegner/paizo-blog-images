  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's a rainy Friday here in Washington state,\
  \ but my spirits are high above the darkened clouds thanks to a very special package\
  \ that arrived from our partners at WizKids this week. The simple cardboard box\
  \ contained a single \"final\" version of <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles <em>Iconic Heroes</em> Set #1</a>, the first in a series of monthly non-random\
  \ iconic character sets that hit stores in January 2015.</p> \n    <p>The <em>Iconic\
  \ Heroes</em> sets are a response to fan demand for several different products.</p>\
  \ \n    <ol>\n     <li>Customers always—always—want nonrandom prepainted figures.\
  \ The expense and nature of the prepainted plastic figure business usually precludes\
  \ this, but the strong popularity of our iconic characters pushed WizKids over the\
  \ line in wanting to give it a try.</li> \n     <li>Players of the popular <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> have long been\
  \ asking for an easy way to collect iconic character figures for use as pawns in\
  \ the card game.</li> \n     <li>Many of the iconic heroes released in previous\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets are sold out and starting\
  \ to fetch crazy prices on the secondary market. I just noticed that someone paid\
  \ more than $40 for a single Amiri figure, which is absolutely nuts. Gamers want\
  \ a way to get our cool iconic heroes at an affordable price.</li>\n    </ol> \n\
  \    <p>So, in January, we'll begin releasing six-figure <em>Iconic Heroes</em>\
  \ sets to address all of the above requests. Even better, each set include six unique\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> cards\
  \ that won't be available anywhere else, each associated with one of the characters\
  \ featured in the set.</p> \n    <p>WizKids promised \"premium quality\" sculpts\
  \ and paint application for the \n     <link>Iconic Heroes sets, which are also\
  \ the first to benefit from the new digital sculpting process we're now using across\
  \ the entire <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. Here at\
  \ Paizo, we took those words to heart, and did everything we could over successive\
  \ rounds of approvals to make these the most detailed, gorgeous prepainted versions\
  \ of these figures ever made. I think all of us also had some ambitions to raise\
  \ the bar across the board with prepainted miniatures. With the right reference\
  \ art, approval team, and with concerted effort from everyone at WizKids, we knew\
  \ the stars could be right for a paradigm-shifting series of figures.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I am pleased to report, my friends, that it appears that everything has gone\
  \ right with <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\">Pathfinder Battles <em>Iconic Heroes</em>\
  \ Set #1</a>, which I now hold in my hands. I'm currently comparing several of the\
  \ figures to previously released versions of the same character for previous <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets. In all cases the new\
  \ version is not just superior, but plainly superior. And we're talking about some\
  \ of the better figures we've produced to date!</p> \n    <p>I couldn't be happier\
  \ with the way these figures turned out. It is my strongest hope that you guys will\
  \ buy enough of them that WizKids considers the experiment a success and slates\
  \ several new releases in this format above and beyond the already-announced characters.\
  \ Because, really, at this stage I think we've done everything we can to make sure\
  \ the product stands tall. It's all down to sales.</p> \n    <p>But enough of my\
  \ talking, let's let the miniatures speak for themselves!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141121-Valeros.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141121-Valeros_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have Valeros, our very first iconic character\
  \ who appeared on the cover of <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\">Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #1</a>, and he also has the distinction of being the very first <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> figure from our initial <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52\"\
  >Beginner Box Heroes</a> set. Good old Val is still figure #1 in this new line,\
  \ and I think he looks better than ever before.</p> \n    <p>Virtually everything\
  \ about this new figure is an improvement over the existing version (which I also\
  \ really liked). Sculpt wise, there are lots of new details, including a bedroll\
  \ on Val's back, more accurate hair, and a cool new facial expression. A huge improvement\
  \ all around.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141121-Seoni.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141121-Seoni_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Seoni the sorcerer first appeared as a rare figure in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> set, where\
  \ she swiftly sold out and became one of the most popular figures we've ever released.\
  \ This was due not just to the fact that Seoni has always been one of our most popular\
  \ iconics, but also because WizKids delivered with a fantastic sculpt and an excellent\
  \ paint job.</p> \n    <p>The new one is even better. The new sculpt is much more\
  \ \"three dimensional,\" in that her ponytails are uniquely sculpted elements (as\
  \ opposed to running flat down the back of the sculpt). The same is also true of\
  \ her ribbons. The main difference here is on tampo application, \"stamped on\"\
  \ details for fine work like script and design. On Seoni these details appear on\
  \ her tattoos, on the script on her ribbons, and on her girdle. Theres no way this\
  \ detail will be visible in photographs, but on the new figure the amount of design\
  \ detail on Seoni's girdle is INSANE. As in, so detailed my naked eye can't even\
  \ fully make it out.</p> \n    <p>The old version of the girdle was flat black,\
  \ with no detail. Again, a huge improvement.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141121-Sajan.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141121-Sajan_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up today is our iconic monk Sajan, who first appeared\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a> set. Again,\
  \ as an iconic character, the original Sajan figure looked pretty good in the first\
  \ place. There were some complaints that the ties for his sleeves drooped down over\
  \ his chest, making it look a bit like a bra, but other than that, he has a cool\
  \ pose and looks very much like the art that inspired him.</p> \n    <p>It won't\
  \ surprise you to learn that I think the new figure is better. Much better. The\
  \ pose is far more three-dimensional, and I'm pleased to report that the sleeve\
  \ tie tassels are no longer an issue, and the new Sajan is bare-breasted, just like\
  \ God (and Wayne Reynolds) intended.</p> \n    <p>So far, <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles <em>Iconic Heroes</em> Set #1</a> is 3 for 3.</p> \n    <p>Swing\
  \ by next week for a look at the next three figures!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
