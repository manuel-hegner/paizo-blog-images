  >Let me guess, another adventurer scared of getting a bit wet are we? Beneath the\
  \ sea there's another world waiting for those brave enough to challenge the depths.\
  \ And you're not wrong, it can be scary down there if you're not prepared. Unlike\
  \ any other terrain on the face of Golarion, venturing underwater constantly reminds\
  \ you that you're as out of place as the proverbial fish out of water. Krakens,\
  \ lusca, and worse swim circles around you while you're still worrying about little\
  \ things like breathing. Looking for a bit of help? Well, you've come to the right\
  \ place!</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9toq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Aquatic-Adventures\"\
  ><em>Aquatic Adventures</em></a> includes a lengthy section on Aquatic Rules with\
  \ more rules content than normal for a book in the Campaign Setting line, including\
  \ simple but in-depth rules for handling the challenges of underwater adventuring\
  \ on the topics of swimming and aquatic adventures, fighting underwater, and underwater\
  \ hazards and features. The rules for swimming consolidate and expand previous swimming\
  \ rules that were written from the perspective of a land campaign where the Swim\
  \ skill is described as a way mainly to avoid going underwater in the first place.\
  \ The rules for fighting underwater collect and adjust the various changes to weapons,\
  \ spells, and more when used underwater. For instance, creatures with a natural\
  \ swim speed can ignore penalties for using their inherent natural attacks underwater,\
  \ so an octopus or kraken doesn't deal less damage with its tentacles. Water attacks\
  \ that deal bludgeoning damage, like a kineticist's water blast, work without penalty\
  \ underwater as well! Finally, underwater hazards and features abound, making it\
  \ easier than ever to add exciting new features to underwater adventures while always\
  \ having the various threats (drowning, pressure, temperature, and more) right at\
  \ your fingertips, with guidance about how they vary in different oceanic zones.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But that's not all! This tome also contains pages and pages of aquatic\
  \ options to customize PCs and foes alike. The strange alchemists known as aquachymists\
  \ have adapted their craft to the particular hindrances of undersea life, while\
  \ aquakineticists and deep shamans of waves allow two water-related options to further\
  \ master the realms beneath the sea. Meanwhile, the tidal trickster rogue moves\
  \ around in the middle of her full attacks, throwing her foes off-balance. But the\
  \ aquanaut fighter has one of the coolest abilities: \"At 15th level, as a full\
  \ round action, an aquanaut can spin ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool\
  \ around himself with a spinning force that drags all creatures within 120 feet\
  \ of him 30 feet closer to him. Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet\
  \ of movement circling around the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice.\
  \ The whirlpool isn't fast enough to deal damage, but the aquanaut is unaffected\
  \ by his own whirlpool, allowing him to make attacks of opportunity against creatures\
  \ moving in it.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n\

  \ venturing beneath the waves, make sure to buy various mundane items useful to\
  \ adventuring underwater, such as sureseal bladders to keep your potables safe and\
  \ ready to drink and pressure pills (good news, it's not a suppository!). Teach\
  \ yourself a variety of aquatic feats including two new style chains based on the\
  \ ways dolphins and great white sharks hunt their prey (it turns out dolphins are\
  \ kind of jerks to their prey, and you can be too!). Discover new magic items like\
  \ the <i>apparatus of the octopus</i> (a more affordable <i>apparatus of the crab</i>),\
  \ the practical underwater weapon special ability, and the tidefinder, best friend\
  \ to terrestrial vampires vacationing under the waves. There's even a new major\
  \ artifact as well as the paladins who seek it, finally sating your curiosity as\
  \ to what that Pathfinder Society boon for <em>Aquatic Adventures</em> was talking\
  \ about.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92102-Diver.jpg\"\

  \      <p class=\"stat-block\">For the duration of the spell, you can fire three\
  \ rays of steam once per round as a standard action (and you also fire three such\
  \ rays as part of casting the spell). These rays function similarly to the rays\
  \ from <i>scorching ray</i> (you can fire them at close range, they're ranged touch\
  \ attacks, they deal 4d6 points of fire damage each, and spell resistance negates\
  \ them) except that they work both underwater and above water without a caster level\
  \ check for being a fire spell.</p> \n     </div> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Mark\
