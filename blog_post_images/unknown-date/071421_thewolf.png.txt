| summary  = This image is of a full-sized wolf. It’s large enough for Fairel to ride. Its coat is mostly gray, but it has some brown/red highlights. It too looks like it has rolled around in the underbrush a bit, as it has leaves and twigs caught in its fur. On its neck, it also has a mystical symbol, like three comets trailing each other. The wolf has a fierce expression, but it isn’t actively snarling. Color palette focus here is on greens and warm browns.
