  description\">Hello! <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> marks the third Adventure Path for our humble\
  \ little <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>,\
  \ and we are just pleased as punch that you would pony up your hard-earned nickels\
  \ to—</p> \n    <p>Man, to hell with that polite nonsense. Or rather, to the Abyss\
  \ with it. Let's gas up our panhead Harleys, set fire to the gas station, and head\
  \ off on a power ride into a canyon of flames.</p> \n    <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>\
  \ is all the sin you want in one game. Designers Paul Peterson and Tanis O'Connor\
  \ will march you lockstep through the gory battlegrounds of the Worldwound in the\
  \ next couple weeks. For now, I'm going to describe how we got to the gates of the\
  \ Abyss, and why we barreled right on through.</p> \n    <h2>The First Sin: Pride</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>When we were considering the next Adventure Path, we thought about what\
  \ had come before it. <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> was a catalogue of essential fantasy tropes:\
  \ there were goblins and ogres and dragons and giants and everything under the sun.\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>\
  \ was a lot more focused and personal: you were kidnapped pirates trying to stay\
  \ alive in a sea of sharks and buccaneers. As epic as those adventures were, they\
  \ seemed... manageable. You could get your brain around how to defeat the challenge.\
  \ We wanted something crazy impossible for the next set, something that would make\
  \ everyone say \"How exactly do you expect us to beat THAT?\" Basically, we wanted\
  \ to show off. So we pridefully looked around for the most impossible thing. Going\
  \ into the Abyss to stop a demon prince's invasion of the world sounded pretty,\
  \ pretty good.</p> \n    <h2>The Second Sin: Sloth</h2> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO9073-StormKing.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO9073-StormKing_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Miguel Regodón Harkness</i>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <p>I've made no secret of the major influence that the videogame Diablo had\
  \ on the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. The plot of Diablo is pretty simple: there's\
  \ a demon lord named Diablo, and he's not a very nice guy, and so you kill everything\
  \ in your path to get to him. Blizzard made two more Diablo videogames after Diablo,\
  \ and they were exactly that thing two more times. Maybe that thing was the best\
  \ thing ever. I have probably sat on my couch for a full three months of my life\
  \ playing Diablo. Yes, I could be using that time to go outside and interact with\
  \ the world. To heck with that. There's demons to kill. So when it became apparent\
  \ that we could write an entire Adventure Path about carving a swath through the\
  \ Abyss, I was on it like a Shakespeare sonnet.</p> \n    <h2>The Third Sin: Gluttony</h2>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is about being mythic heroes. I mean,\
  \ seriously mythic. Kings of the world, really. Everything is just bigger in the\
  \ Worldwound. We wanted all that stuff. Of course, we had a real challenge ahead,\
  \ because we needed every character we've ever created to work in that environment.\
  \ We had to come up with a lot of clever trickery to make that all work. But basically,\
  \ we did it because we like to eat the most awesome things, and nobody was gonna\
  \ stop us from eating all of them.</p> \n    <br style=\"clear: both;\"> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-Mythic.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-Mythic_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>The Fourth Sin: Greed</h2> \n    <p>And oh, the toys!\
  \ The Pathfinder RPG folks had built up all these artifacts and relics and other\
  \ boss things that just didn't make sense in an intimate story like <em>Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</em>. We made a thing called a Boomcrown for you. Also, we made a bow\
  \ that fires dragon breath. And that's not even scraping the surface. Would you\
  \ like to ride a Dire Griffon? Got that for you. Wanna cast a spell called Terraform?\
  \ No problem. Maybe have a goddess as an ally? All of this and more can be yours!\
  \ It's so cool.</p> \n    <h2>The Fifth Sin: Lust</h2> \n    <p>I would like to\
  \ introduce you to my friend Nocticula. She's a demon lord who controls a realm\
  \ made out of the corpses of demon lords she's killed. She's got a cavalcade of\
  \ succubi and incubi and other demons of lust, ready to bring down the will of the\
  \ mortal world. She's a super-hot nova of sex and violence. And she's your friend.\
  \ That's just the kind of thing that keeps our attention in <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>.</p>\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>The Sixth Sin: Envy</h2> \n    <p>And okay, here's the\
  \ basest reason we wanted to do <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>. We were working\
  \ on <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> when the Pathfinder RPG guys were designing\
  \ the RPG version of <em>Wrath</em>. Throughout the day, we would hear them chuckling\
  \ at the latest evil machination that James Jacobs and his team had come up with.\
  \ They were having so much fun. And quite honestly, we're not the kind of folks\
  \ who can abide people having fun without us. So we stole their fun. I'm sure they\
  \ will get it back someday.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Bryan Sola</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>The Seventh\
  \ Sin: Wrath</h2> \n    <p>With all those rationalizations under our belt, we set\
  \ about to designing <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, breaking everything along\
  \ the way. One of the coolest things about this game line is how the sets seem to\
  \ take on the personality of one member of the design team. <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>\
  \ is Chad's: it's a sweeping arc of everything one can pack into a fantasy game.\
  \ <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em> is Gaby's: it's a jaunty adventure on the high seas,\
  \ with all the yo-ho-hoing her galvo-obsessed brain can handle. The organized play\
  \ seasons are Tanis's: they're a big inclusive tent under which all gamers can gather.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is Paul Peterson's. Paul is the designer\
  \ of Smash Up and Guillotine and other violent-sounding games. If I'm going to find\
  \ someone to design a hellscape, he's my guy. And so he'll be leading you through\
  \ <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>. Buckle up, because it's going to be a bumpy ride.</p>\
