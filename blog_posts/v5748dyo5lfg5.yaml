  description\"><i>For today's blog, we've given Pathfinder web fiction contributor\
  \ Gabrielle Harbowy, whose story <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial/inheritance\"\
  >\"Inheritance\"</a> is running right now, the chance to talk a little about what\
  \ it's like to write for Pathfinder Tales. Take it away, Gabrielle!</i></span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>When I was eight, my third-grade teacher brought in a bag of dice and\
  \ a couple of player guides, and taped a masking-tape dungeon over the tiles on\
  \ the classroom floor. Every Wednesday, instead of Reading, we'd have Roleplaying\
  \ time. People who didn't want to play could read quietly, but dragons and slime\
  \ creatures and bold adventurers had the room.</p> \n     <p>To call that experience\
  \ \"formative\" would probably be an understatement. </p> \n     <p>I haven't had\
  \ a regular, local gaming group since I was about 15, but I've never lost my love\
  \ of the tabletop RPGs, and I play whenever I can. When I started exploring RPG\
  \ tie-in fiction as a reader, I was drawn in by the adventure, the drama, and the\
  \ high quality of the writing. I never actually thought that it was something I\
  \ would have the chance to do, but I've been Chris Jackson's editor at Dragon Moon\
  \ Press since 2009, and he's the one who got me into Pathfinder. When Chris's Scimitar\
  \ Seas series ended, it was an honor to hand him off to James Sutter and Pathfinder\
  \ Tales for <i>Pirate's Honor</i>. Chris writes nautical fantasy like no one else,\
  \ and his enthusiasm for Pathfinder as a gaming system was infectious. And it seemed\
  \ that once I heard about Pathfinder, I started hearing about it everywhere. The\
  \ paperbacks were in the bookstores, the gamers I work with all had great things\
  \ to say about the game and the gaming system, and I even learned that Scott Purdy,\
  \ the artist who created the covers for my first two anthologies, had illustrations\
  \ in some of Pathfinder's bestiaries. </p> \n     <p>I was excited when James Sutter\
  \ told me he had enjoyed my story in <i>When the Hero Comes Home</i>, and invited\
  \ me to pitch a piece of web fiction for Pathfinder Tales. I love Pathfinder's take\
  \ on gnomes, and knew I wanted to show a gnome mindset, and explore adventuring\
  \ from an outsider's perspective. Writer-friends and Paizo staffers were incredibly\
  \ supportive and made the planning and writing a great experience for me...but there\
  \ were a couple of aspects of writing in a shared world, and an RPG's world in particular,\
  \ that surprised me when I started gnomestory.doc, which eventually became \"Inheritance.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Since GMs are never, ever control freaks, let's just say—hypothetically,\
  \ of course—that you're watching your players hit dead end after dead end, or argue\
  \ all night about a decision that doesn't even matter, while you sit back and try\
  \ really hard not to guide them too much, enlighten them too much, or inflict blunt\
  \ force trauma. </p> \n     <p>Not that that ever happens. But if it did, then the\
  \ idea of being able to send characters exactly where you wanted them to go, to\
  \ do exactly what you plan for them to do, might have some appeal.</p> \n     <p>Writing\
  \ RPG tie-in fiction is like GMing a game where you control ALL the players. And\
  \ the NPCs. And the bad guys. And all the dice rolls come out exactly the way you\
  \ want them to, every time.</p> \n     <p>The thing is, the off-the-wall creativity\
  \ of your players is what makes a campaign so much fun. They may not take the straight\
  \ path from A to B, but it would be boring if they did. Think about how often they\
  \ surprise you. Then think about what it would be like if they <i>never surprised\
  \ you</i>, ever. What would be the point? </p> \n     <p>For an experienced cat-wrangler,\
  \ writing solo is surprisingly difficult. You have too much control. You don't have\
  \ someone else's unpredictability to turn your scenario on its head in interesting\
  \ ways. </p> \n     <p>Making it look like your players' off-road diversions were\
  \ things you planned all along? Is an art. </p> \n     <p>Making it look as though\
  \ you're still getting that input and unpredictability, when really it's all just\
  \ coming out of your own head? That's a skill.</p> \n     <p>Interpreting the reference\
  \ texts into a full environment is also a skill. GMs do it, but they have maps and\
  \ miniatures and hand gestures; they have dice and rules. Writers have only the\
  \ text, into which they must breathe life and logic, and plausible reasons for the\
  \ world to act as it does.</p> \n     <p>There's so much material out there, but\
  \ some of it only touches the surface. When there's only one sentence IN EXISTENCE\
  \ ANYWHERE to sum up an entire town, you can't go to Google Maps and see what the\
  \ place looks like, or go to Wikipedia to find out about its demographics and economy,\
  \ or to YouTube to see how the locals dress or hear their accents. What there is,\
  \ is ALL that there is. </p> \n     <p>Maybe you're looking in the wrong places,\
  \ but maybe the information doesn't actually exist. You don't want to reinvent the\
  \ wheel and go against canon...but you don't want to waste too much writing time\
  \ chasing down things that don't exist. And sometimes those things do exist in production,\
  \ but aren't published yet. That means they're important for continuity, but there's\
  \ no way you could have found them on your own.</p> \n     <p>In \"Inheritance,\"\
  \ Zae makes a device that basically contains an augury spell. She can manipulate\
  \ it, expend some expensive component materials, and it answers weal or woe. Well,\
  \ that's great. But there's nothing in the spell text to indicate <i>what form</i>\
  \ it gives you your answers in. Just about at the time I realized I'd created a\
  \ steampunk Magic 8 Ball, I also realized that there was no way James Sutter, you\
  \ the readers, or my own conscience would let me just throw in a Magic 8 Ball because\
  \ I was too lazy to think of something original. </p> \n     <p>I delved into the\
  \ messageboards to see how anyone else had done this sort of thing (to no avail),\
  \ and then took a hard look at the essential augury spell components—incense, and\
  \ the implication that incense needs to be lit and expended—and figured out how\
  \ to put them together with a device to create a mechanism capable of indicating\
  \ multiple different answers. </p> \n     <p>And felt like I'd leveled up when I\
  \ got feedback that it was approved. Successful foray into someone else's world?\
