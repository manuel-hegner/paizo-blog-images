  artist: "a star cast of authors led by Amber Scott (contributor to Dragon magazine,\
    \ the \"Ecology of the Varisians\" article for Pathfinder, and Dark Markets, A\
    \ Guide to Katapesh) and Colin McComb (TSR veteran and a designer for Fallout\
    \ II and Planescape: Torment). Developed hand-in-hand with the Council of Thieves\
    \ Adventure Path, Cheliax serves up a big spicy dish of diabolical bureaucracy\
    \ with its hands around the throat of the common people. In a land ruled by devil-worshipers,\
    \ nothing is quite... normal. Basement arenas in slums host cockatrice fights.\
    \ The elite military forces train against devils to overcome fear. Priests of\
    \ Asmodeus interpret laws. At the top of the hierarchy, lovely young Queen Abrogail\
    \ issues orders to the royal scribes, redacting events of the past and issuing\
    \ new official histories so that eventually all will believe that Cheliax has\
    \ always been in league with Hell. As the Pathfinder Companion line is designed\
    \ to be player-friendly, inside you'll find articles on Westcrown (an excellent\
    \ source of info for players about to start the Council of Thieves Adventure Path)\
    \ and the capital city of Egorian, magic items and spells of Cheliax, religion\
    \ in Cheliax (including how non-Asmodean religions are allowed to exist there),\
    \ new traits, new combat feats to emulate devil fighting styles, and four fully\
    \ statted NPCs suitable for contacts, hirelings, or cohorts. Sean K Reynolds Developer,\
    \ Pathfinder Companion"
