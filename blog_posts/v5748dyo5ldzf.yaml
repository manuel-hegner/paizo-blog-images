  \ Scott de Bie</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: The Caper</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Humming anxiously under his\
  \ breath, Tarrant watched as the last cart of treasure arrived from the docks as\
  \ the sun set. This time was always torture and ecstasy for him: he could hardly\
  \ stand the waiting, and yet he could not help his excitement for the game to come.\
  \ Tarrant shadowed the cart from the docks to Hawkthorne Tower, then slipped around\
  \ the back.</span></p> \n    <p>It was time to begin.</p> \n    <p>With all the\
  \ activity around the front gate, where the Blackscale Blades were delivering the\
  \ great treasure, the servants' entrance stood only lightly guarded. Two armored\
  \ men flanked the back door, one of whom wore the key around his neck as a badge\
  \ of office. Tarrant was familiar with Lord Doreset's favored mercenary company\
  \ and knew their procedures.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant swaggered out of the alley. A\
  \ thick brown cloak dipped in low-class swill covered his identity. As he approached,\
  \ Tarrant sang a dwarven song in a low-pitched, slurred voice, crafting bubbles\
  \ that floated through the air toward the man with the key.</p> \n    <p>\"Shove\
  \ off, you!\" shouted the other guard. \"Go be drunk on your own—Drohn?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The guard's partner smiled like a child and plucked at the bubbles of song\
  \ that floated around him. When he saw Tarrant, his smile widened, and he stared.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Magic!\" hissed the first guard. He reached for his sword, but a different\
  \ spell caught him before he could draw. He blinked, swayed on his feet, and looked\
  \ confused. He pointed his sword at Tarrant half-heartedly.</p> \n    <p>Gislai\
  \ appeared. \"Your need for attention is your least likeable characteristic.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I make up for it in other ways,\" Tarrant sang, and resumed his song\
  \ with a chorus to keep the beguiled guard interested.</p> \n    <p>The priestess\
  \ rolled her eyes and chanted a second spell. Her half-orc visage wavered and changed\
  \ into that of Captain Nemerath, an authoritative human Blackscale captain of Tarrant's\
  \ acquaintance and occasional liaison. The guard captain's armor—unfastened slightly\
  \ for appearances—made a perfect disguise for Gislai. \"You seem troubled, soldier.\
  \ What's your name?\"</p> \n    <p>The guard looked relieved to see her. \"I'm Rholf,\
  \ captain.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A good strong Ulfen name,\" she said. \"Named for your\
  \ father, were you?\"</p> \n    <p>He nodded, then turned his attention back to\
  \ Tarrant. \"This one... is he yours?\"</p> \n    <p>Tarrant recognized Gislai's\
  \ little mischievous smile all too well—she was considering betraying him. He kept\
  \ singing, and Drohn sat down so that he could listen better.</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ Gislai nodded. \"He is a friend. We've come to check the locks on the gate.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Locks.\" Rholf looked at the strong iron lock on the door. \"Drohn\
  \ has the key, but—\" His expression grew suspicious. \"But I can't just give—\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Oh, we don't need the key,\" Gislai said. \"That wouldn't be much\
  \ of a test, would it? My associate is suitably skilled. He'll test the lock.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Eram Many-Fingers appeared from the shadows, his eyes darting back\
  \ and forth nervously. He stepped up to the gate and slipped his lockpicks out of\
  \ his belt. Meanwhile, Gislai took Rholf aside. Every one of her words, smiles,\
  \ and seemingly unintentionally touches strengthened the spell. It really was a\
  \ wonder to watch such a natural con artist at work.</p> \n    <p>With Rholf suitably\
  \ distracted, Tarrant nodded—the signal for Eram to make his move. He didn't even\
  \ touch his picks to the door, which would have triggered the warding magic anyway.\
  \ Instead, he crept up on the distracted Drohn and took his chain of office—along\
  \ with the key—right off his neck.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant wove a new thread of the\
  \ song, suggesting Drohn shuffle off to the nearest alehouse. When Drohn had wandered\
  \ out of sight, Tarrant let the song trail away. \"Gislai.\"</p> \n    <p>The half-orc\
  \ cast him an annoyed look, then shared a few more words with Rholf. The guard nodded\
  \ and left. \"He'll go back to guarding the gate—once he finds Drohn, wherever the\
  \ man got off to.\"</p> \n    <p>Tarrant nodded. \"Your spell is very effective.\"\
  </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Gislai.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Gislai_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> Gislai is more than just a pretty face.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  Aye, for one guard. And now it's expended. What happens when we face a group?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"No worries,\" Tarrant said, patting the satchel at his hip. \"I've\
  \ a plan for that, too.\"</p> \n    <p>At his signal, Arlif and Ephere emerged from\
  \ the alley, both clad in thick cloaks. They crossed to the door and entered. The\
  \ elf gave Tarrant a brief nod that made him smile.</p> \n    <p>\"That, right there?\"\
  \ Gislai pointed to the elf. \"That's dangerous.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Whence this dislike\
  \ for our companion, 'captain'?\" Tarrant shed his filthy cloak to reveal a Blackscale's\
  \ trademark mail beneath. He sang a brief song of disguise and took the shape of\
  \ Rholf. \"Is not your Calistria an elven goddess?\"</p> \n    <p>\"That just means\
  \ I know how treacherous elves are,\" Gislai countered.</p> \n    <p>\"And beautiful.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"As I said.\"</p> \n    <p>They stepped through the door into the\
  \ inner guardroom and found the others in a tense standoff with three more Blackscales—\
  two humans and a dwarf. Axe in hand, Arlif stood between them and Ephere. Eram was\
  \ nowhere to be seen, the coward. Blades slid from sheathes.</p> \n    <p>The Liespinner\
  \ hadn't earned his name by hesitating. \"Down arms! A thousand apologies, my lady\
  \ ambassador!\"</p> \n    <p>The Blackscales looked confused. \"Ambassador?\" the\
  \ dwarf rumbled.</p> \n    <p>On cue, Ephere threw back her cloak, revealing a gorgeous\
  \ gown of green silk, lined with silver stitching. Tarrant had acquired this dress\
  \ in one of Absalom's most fashionable boutiques.</p> \n    <p>\"Ambassador Saleae\
  \ Epheldera of Kyonin,\" Tarrant said. \"Here to inspect the ancient elven treasures\
  \ recovered during the recent expedition.\"</p> \n    <p>The dwarf, presumably the\
  \ commanding officer, shook his head. \"We were not informed.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Yes, well, the honorable Viridian Crown has heard of our recent exploits, and...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I am an expert on the artifacts of Kyonin.\" Ephere held up her\
  \ ensorcelled gauntlets, which crackled with magical power. \"My kinswoman, Queen\
  \ Telandia, knows of this dragon you slew—an old beast with an even older hoard.\
  \ She will pay handsomely for relics that predate our people's return from Sovyrian.\
  \ But this—\" Ephere drew up to her full height. \"This is not how I am accustomed\
  \ to being treated. First drunken guards, and now insolence? This is an insult to\
  \ me and to the queen.\"</p> \n    <p>Confronted with an offended noble promising\
  \ a reward, the Blackscales quickly put their blades away and offered apologies.\
  \ Ephere's natural affinity for deception touched Tarrant's villainous heart.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Someone under my command mucked this up,\" Gislai said. \"I'll bet\
  \ it's that damned Drohn—always drinking on the job. Where's your good-for-nothing\
  \ partner, Rholf?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Apologies, Captain,\" Tarrant said to her. \"\
  It won't happen again.\"</p> \n    <p>\"See that it doesn't.\" Gislai looked to\
  \ the Blackscales. \"Stand easy, gentlemen. You're not at fault here.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>At first, it seemed the guards might press for more answers, but ultimately\
  \ they relaxed. At a nod from Gislai, they sat back down to a half-finished hand\
  \ of Towers.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant and his party pressed through the cloakroom and\
  \ closed the doors behind them. It disappointed him that the guards hadn't asked\
  \ why such a noble visitor would enter through the servants' door. He'd had a lie\
  \ all prepared for that—\"a matter of diplomatic delicacy.\" Shame, but an unused\
  \ lie was an unspent arrow.</p> \n    <p>Perhaps, he thought, they didn't care.\
  \ Perhaps they recognize a robbery in progress and had just given Tarrant their\
  \ tacit approval to take Lord Doreset for all he was worth. He liked to think they\
  \ had.</p> \n    <p>Eram appeared from around the corner, rubbing his hands together\
  \ and glancing back at the site of the near-disaster. \"Finally, you return,\" Tarrant\
  \ said. \"No troubles?\"</p> \n    <p>\"None,\" the halfling murmured.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Are you well?\" Gislai asked, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. \"You seem\
  \ even more twitchy than usual.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, not at all!\" the halfling\
  \ protested. \"I'm fine! Just fine!\"</p> \n    <p>\"If I didn't know better, I'd\
  \ think you were planning something.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Only the plan!\" Eram said.\
  \ \"Promise!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm sure it's fine.\" Tarrant turned to the others.\
  \ \"That was exciting, wasn't it?\" He touched Ephere's arm. \"You did well.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The elf nodded. Behind her, Gislai groaned.</p> \n    <p>\"You noted\
  \ them well, I hope?\" Tarrant slipped vials of blue potion to Arlif and Eram. \"\
  In case anything else goes wrong.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What is this?\" Eram asked. \"\
  Escape in a bottle?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Something of the sort,\" Tarrant said. \"Let's\
  \ move on, shall we?\"</p> \n    <p>They stepped past the entry chamber into a larger\
  \ hall where the walls pulsed with warding magic. Torches burst into life at their\
  \ approach, revealing a solid vault door at the end of the hall. Tarrant felt the\
  \ oppressive warding magic all around him, like an invisible wall of water. \"Beyond\
  \ here, anything we bring from the vault will no doubt trigger—\"</p> \n    <p>Eram\
  \ took a step deeper into the hall, and the wards whined to angry life. Two hulking\
  \ iron statues shivered, pulled away from the walls, and pointed massive swords\
  \ at them.</p> \n    <p>\"—Guardians.\" Tarrant took Drohn's chain of office from\
  \ Eram and presented it to the guardians. \"Hold!\"</p> \n    <p>The golems stepped\
  \ closer, oblivious to his command.</p> \n    <p>\"Stop?\" Tarrant tried. \"Desist?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The golems raised their swords, and the would-be thieves reached for\
  \ their weapons. Ephere's arms lit with fire and lightning. Eram slipped two daggers\
  \ into his hands and Arlif unbuckled his greataxe. Tarrant wondered if his music\
  \ would touch such creatures. He doubted it.</p> \n    <p>Then Gislai—still in disguise\
  \ as Captain Nemerath—stepped forward, seized the chain from Tarrant, and raised\
  \ it to the golems. \"Zarahtas!\" she declaimed.</p> \n    <p>Instantly, the guardians\
  \ lowered their swords and returned to their places.</p> \n    <p>\"Good thing I\
  \ bothered to get the passphrase from Rholf,\" she said as they crossed through\
  \ the hall. \"For security, one guard had the chain, one had the code. Apparently,\
  \ Doreset had the golems changed after he had you thrown in prison.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Outstanding.\" Tarrant strode past the resting golems and sized up the doors.\
  \ \"You know, these doors were specially built in Nex with the finest magic coin\
  \ can purchase. They have no ward that needs to be renewed daily, but rather several\
  \ persistent enchantments imbedded in the doors themselves. It would take several\
  \ wizards multiple castings to suppress them, and by that point, the alarm spells\
  \ would sound. Damned impressive, not to mention expensive.\" Tarrant beckoned to\
  \ Eram. \"Rod please.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\" the halfling said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Why do you think I asked you about the job in Cassomir? I know you're carrying the\
  \ rod, so just give it here.\"</p> \n    <p>The halfling grumbled, but sure enough,\
  \ reached into his haversack. His arm extended all the way into one of the small\
  \ pockets, and he pulled out a foot-long silvery rod. \"Be welcome to the cursed\
  \ thing anyway.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I sense a story there, no?\" Gislai said.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Eram shook his head frantically.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant took the rod, which\
  \ hummed slightly in his hand, and held it in front of the door. \"Arlif, Eram,\
  \ this is as far as you go—Gislai, you too.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That wasn't the plan!\"\
  \ the half-orc protested. \"I'm certainly not leaving you with her.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Ephere seemed unconcerned.</p> \n    <p>\"As long as she's at your side,\"\
  \ Gislai said, \"I'm at the other.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I never object to working between\
  \ two lovely ladies.\" Tarrant smiled. \"I'll have that potion back, then. It's\
  \ important you not have it.\"</p> \n    <p>Gislai looked perplexed, but ultimately\
  \ she rolled her eyes and handed the vial back.</p> \n    <p>\"Outstanding.\" He\
  \ tucked it into his tunic. \"Arlif, Eram—time to part ways.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ big Ulfen warrior turned and made his way back across the golem-guarded hall,\
  \ and Eram—after a longing look at the vault door—joined him. Gislai stood her ground\
  \ stubbornly.</p> \n    <p>\"I didn't realize you cared,\" Tarrant said. \"I'm touched.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Touched in the head, if you think I'm letting you in there alone,\"\
  \ she said. \"What's to keep you from taking your fill of gold and leaving nothing\
  \ for us?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Prudent.\" Tarrant tapped the rod against the door, setting\
  \ off a series of pops and crackles as its antimagic cancelled out the door's many\
  \ enchantments. The magic left its mechanical locks in place, however.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>He began a song the elves of Kyonin used to welcome ships from distant lands,\
  \ which his mother had first heard from traveling musicians. It had always been\
  \ one of his favorite ballads as a boy, and now as a man, it provided focus to his\
  \ magic. Soft green light swirled around him. At the climax of the spell, he reached\
  \ out and knocked once on the massive vault door.</p> \n    <p>Nothing happened.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Huh.\"</p> \n    <p>He cast the spell and knocked again, but still,\
  \ the doors remained sealed.</p> \n    <p>\"How terribly embarrassing.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Tarrant began the song a third time, but Ephere laid her hand on his arm.\
  \ From beneath the folds of her gown, she drew a hollow mithral tube about twice\
  \ the length of her slender hand.</p> \n    <p>\"Is that what I think it is?\" Gislai\
  \ asked. \"Well isn't that convenient. And suspicious.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nonsense!\
  \ Thank you, Ephere.\" Tarrant handed her his rapier. \"Have a care with this.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Ephere tapped the rapier's pommel against the tube, which resonated\
  \ with a deep, clear tone. The locks on the now mundane door clicked, and the vault\
  \ opened to them, shedding golden light that bathed their skin.</p> \n    <p>Gislai\
  \ sucked in a sharp breath.</p> \n    <p>Ephere nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"Outstanding,\"\
  \ Tarrant said.</p> \n    <p>The sheer size of the hoard stunned them to silence.\
  \ A kingdom's ransom in coins and jewels overflowed from open chests. Cut gems the\
  \ size of a clenched fist lay carefully arranged atop bolts of fine silk and damask.\
  \ Ancient swords and shields adorned marble statues inlaid with silver and jewels.\
  \ The most impressive piece was, by far, a statue of a dragon, wrought of pure gold\
  \ and studded with rubies the length of its tail.</p> \n    <p>\"To work.\" Tarrant\
  \ pulled a red silk bag from his tunic, into which he began shoveling treasure.\
  \ However much they put in, the bag never seemed to swell.</p> \n    <p>\"Avoid\
  \ the relics—tricky to fence,\" Gislai said. \"Hard coin and jewels spend better.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Good thing Eram stayed away,\" Tarrant said. \"He'd likely die of\
  \ a burst head.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I might do so myself.\" Gislai held up a platinum\
  \ tiara. \"Look at this! A lass could get used to—\"</p> \n    <p>Then a keening\
  \ wail filled the room, roaring out into the tower: an alarm spell. Tarrant turned\
  \ to see Ephere pointing her war gauntlets at them. He reached for his sword, only\
  \ to remember that the elf had taken it at the door. He winced.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Don't move,\" she said. \"Lady Altara will be here soon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I told\
  \ you not to trust her,\" Gislai murmured.</p> \n    <p>\"That's really comforting,\"\
  \ Tarrant said. \"Why, dear lady? Have I offended you? Why would you side with those\
  \ poorly appointed Hellknights over us?\"</p> \n    <p>Ephere reached down and pulled\
  \ her bodice open just enough to reveal a long-faded scar, like a brand. There,\
  \ she traced the forefinger of her right hand across her flesh, lighting a burning\
  \ star to mark herself. That was why she'd been keen to hide her skin earlier, and\
  \ why that spot on her chest had felt hot under his touch. It was a symbol Tarrant\
  \ recognized all too well.</p> \n    <p>\"Hail Asmodeus.\" She pressed her lightning\
  \ gauntlet to Tarrant's head and shocked him into darkness.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
