  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, December 11, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">With the January release date for <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> right around the corner and\
  \ everything entering \"pause\" territory for the upcoming holiday, I don't have\
  \ any new figures to show off for this week's <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> previews. I DO, however, have a few new images of some old friends\
  \ to show off, so in the holiday spirit, I thought I'd share a look at actual final\
  \ figures from December's <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"><em>Pathfinder Battles\
  \ Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a>. (These figures hit the Paizo warehouse too late\
  \ to go out with December subscription shipments, and will be fulfilled in late-December/January.)</p>\
  \ \n    <p>WizKids has continued their tradition of providing amazing paint jobs\
  \ for the entire <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> line,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\">Set 4</a> is certainly no exception. Below,\
  \ I've outlined the six figures in the set with \"final\" photographed images of\
  \ the actual release figures. Sometimes, zooming in super close on figures like\
  \ this has a way of highlighting some of a figure's minor blemishes, but overall\
  \ I think these photos are a good representation of what you get in the box.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Let's take a look!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Crowe.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Crowe_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First we've got Crowe, Human Bloodrager, from the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</em></a>.\
  \ Crowe puts the \"show\" in Shoanti. Did you know superstar Pathfinder artist Wayne\
  \ Reynolds based the look of Crowe on his own Pathfinder character? While I have\
  \ little doubt that Wayne could produce an absolutely KILLER paint job on a blank\
  \ Crowe figure, I also have little doubt that there is only Wayne Reynolds, and\
  \ we can't all be great at art. For the rest of us, <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a> does all the work, resulting in a beautiful figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Lirianne.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Lirianne_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our first crack at Lirianne, Half-Elf Gunslinger, came\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> set. While\
  \ I adore the attention to detail and fine points of the costuming on that figure,\
  \ I was never quite satisfied with the way Lirianne's face sort of fell into the\
  \ overall composition, leading to a somewhat compromised miniature altogether. I'm\
  \ pleased to report that <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a>\
  \ does away with compromise to present a figure that is awesome from top to bottom.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Hakon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Hakon_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up is Hakon, most famous for being the iconic skald\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>, but more\
  \ beloved to me personally for being the brother of the greatest Pathfinder RPG\
  \ character who ever lived, Ostog the Unslain*. Hakon's face tattoos and eye tampos\
  \ look better in hand than under the unforgiving magnification of digital photography,\
  \ and overall I'm very pleased with how he turned out. He works great for any kind\
  \ of axe-wielding warrior, and I can see this piece getting a lot of use at my table\
  \ fighting with or against the player characters.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Jirelle.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Jirelle_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>By my eyes, this figure turned out the best in the entire\
  \ set. Here we have Jirelle, Half-Elf Swashbuckler, again from the <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"\
  ><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>. Jirelle has a remarkably complex costume, so\
  \ I've always been a little concerned with how the final figure would turn out.\
  \ I needn't have worried. She looks fantastic.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Shardra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Shardra_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Although the straight-on angle of this photo makes it\
  \ difficult to see, my favorite thing about the Shardra, Dwarf Shaman figure is\
  \ its three-dimensionality. I think this is the best dwarf we've created for Pathfinder\
  \ Battles so far, and the morningstar/censer combination makes her great for any\
  \ kind of ceremonial dwarfâ€”a race that always stands on ceremony.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Kolo.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Kolo_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Shardra would feel quite lonely without her spirit animal\
  \ Kolo, a rambunctious rock lizard. Perfect for use as a familiar, animal companion,\
  \ or even just a random lizard in a subterranean encounter, Kolo has a message on\
  \ its little scroll that says: Beware! I kick ass.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9q\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a>! I'll be back\
  \ next week with one more preview for 2015, and after that, we'll all have visions\
  \ of brand new minis dancing in our heads!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain,</p>\
