  articleBody\"> \n     <p>We’re back from Gen Con, and holy cow things went great\
  \ for Paizo at this year’s show! I was very pleased at the reception of our new\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ plastic fantasy miniatures, as con-goers surrounded our display of all the unboxed\
  \ figures throughout the exhibit hall hours, and I kept seeing the figures (along\
  \ with our new <a href=\"/products/btpy8tj5\">Bestiary Box</a> Pawns) all over the\
  \ 95 tables of Pathfinder Society games that ran every slot of the convention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I was especially pleased to accept the gold Gen Con/ENnie award for\
  \ Best Miniatures Product for our very first Pathfinder Battles set, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>. As proud as I am of that initial\
  \ offering, from my perspective the Pathfinder Battles sets just keep getting better\
  \ and better, so I’m eager to see what next year’s judges and voters think of <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> and the upcoming Shattered\
  \ Star minis set!</p> \n     <p>We ended up selling out of all the Rise of the Runelords\
  \ minis by Sunday, and I was pleased to see several gamers getting in line two or\
  \ three times with piles of boosters in hand as they hunted down that one specific\
  \ figure or simply augmented their growing collection of Pathfinder Battles miniatures.\
  \ Reaction to the new four-figure standard booster format was very positive, and\
  \ it was really cool to see people so excited about a product line I’ve personally\
  \ poured a ton of attention and sweat into over the last year. I was pleased to\
  \ see that our partners at WizKids felt similarly, and your support made both of\
  \ our conventions among the best ever.</p> \n     <p>Of course, as much as I love\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> figures, these days\
  \ I’ve been spending an awful lot of time with that set’s younger, hotter cousin,\
  \ the Shattered Star! This set of 55 miniatures is currently slated for a January\
  \ 2013 release, coinciding with the publication of the final volume of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Shattered Star was our first opportunity\
  \ to develop a set of miniatures to support an Adventure Path at the same time that\
  \ that Adventure Path was being outlined. I’ve spoken before in earlier columns\
  \ about the difficulties associated with such a plan (we have to make LOTS of decisions\
  \ MUCH sooner than we’re used to in order to pull it off given the extremely long\
  \ lead-time involved with miniatures production), but one of the great things about\
  \ this approach is that I got to sneak a few miniatures into the set (and hence\
  \ into the Adventure Path outline) that have never before been released as prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures.</span></p> \n     <p>Which leads us to today’s figure: The\
  \ Caryatid Column!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120824-Column.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120824-Column_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This creature has a long history in fantasy gaming,\
  \ but its inspiration has an even longer history in, well, history. Caryatids—which\
  \ is to say columns in the form of maidens—have been a part of architecture since\
  \ the ancient Greeks. Their use dates back to at least the 6th century BC. I was\
  \ able to see one of the famous caryatids at the British Museum while visiting London\
  \ after Gen Con UK a few years back, and the sculpting was so realistic that the\
  \ stone dresses worn by the figure looked soft to the touch, almost like it was\
  \ real cloth on a real woman.</p> \n     <p>Happily, in the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game, Caryatid Columns actually DO come alive, making them near-perfect low(ish)-level\
  \ constructs. Plus, hitting them has a way of breaking the PCs’ weapons, which is\
  \ always fun for the GM. </p> \n     <p>When I decided to include a Caryatid Column\
  \ in the Shattered Star set, I took a look at the drawing included in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder Bestiary 3</a>. a neat enough illustration, but\
  \ it lacks the sort of clothing effects I expect to see on a Caryatid Column inspired\
  \ by the genuine articles. Instead I asked WizKids’ artists to base their sculpt\
  \ upon an actual, real-life Caryatid Column from the ancient world. I think the\
  \ resulting figure looks a lot better than a straight translation of the art from\
  \ the Bestiary.</p> \n     <p>By sculpting our Caryatid Column figure in “column\
  \ form,” the miniature doubles as any sort of pillar you might want to throw on\
  \ your game table. I’m eager to set up whole rows of these guys (or gals, as the\
  \ case may be) in my dungeons. Maybe some of them are ordinary pillars, while others\
  \ are monsters waiting patiently for the arrival of the heroes. Who knows? Well,\
  \ I know, of course, which is one of the reasons I prefer to be the GM. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Lastly, because I’m a nice guy and because I’m sure a few of you out there\
  \ are wrongly clicking your tongues and thinking “big deal, so it’s a column,” I’\
  m going to drop ONE MORE preview on you.</p> \n     <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I give\
  \ you the Night Hag!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120824-NightHag.jpg\"\
