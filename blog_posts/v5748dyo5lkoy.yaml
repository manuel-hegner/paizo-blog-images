  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">You know, after all this time being stuck next\
  \ to each other in game books, dwarves and elves might be getting pretty sick of\
  \ each other. Well, too bad for them—they get no respite in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest</i>!\
  \ Today, we'll be looking ahead to the newest versions of these classic folk by\
  \ delving into their ancestry entries.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    \

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Dwarves</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Adventuring is for the stout-hearted. Be stable. Be dependable. Be a\
  \ dwarf! These fine folk live in isolated citadels, their surface empire having\
  \ fallen long ago, but from time to time they venture out into the world of adventure.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As a dwarf, you get three ability boosts: one to Constitution, one to\
  \ Wisdom, and one to the score of your choice. You take an ability flaw to Charisma,\
  \ though your clan mother says you're quite charming. You get 10 Hit Points from\
  \ your ancestry—more than the other ancestries and MUCH more than the elves! Your\
  \ speed is 20 feet, perfectly adequate for adventuring, and you can ignore the speed\
  \ reduction from your armor. You speak Common and Dwarf, as you may expect, and\
  \ you can see in the dark just fine.</p> \n    <p>All that represents what's common\
  \ to all dwarves, and comes from their innate tendencies. Ancestry feats go farther,\
  \ reflecting mostly the cultural propensities of the ancestry. For example, you\
  \ likely grew up among your dwarven kin, training with the weapons of the Weapon\
  \ Familiarity feat. Battleaxes, picks, warhammers... those are good, dependable\
  \ weapons. And let's not forget the special weapons with the dwarf trait, like the\
  \ dwarven waraxe or your beloved clan dagger (forged for you at birth and capped\
  \ with a gemstone sacred to your clan). Your training might have included the best\
  \ ways to battle creatures like derros, duergar, giants, or orcs. In that case,\
  \ you might pick up the Ancestral Hatred feat to give you a bonus on damage against\
  \ these enemies—a bonus that goes up for 1 minute if one of those wretched creatures\
  \ critically hits you!</p> \n    <p>Now, this isn't to say ancestry feats deal exclusively\
  \ with your upbringing. Heritage feats are a special type of ancestry feat that\
  \ reflect special physiological traits of your ancestry. Because they're inborn,\
  \ you can select them only at 1st level. Hardy is one of these, letting you resist\
  \ poisons and recover from them more quickly. (This kept Ron Lundeen's dwarven barbarian\
  \ up during a recent playtest—even though he was still pretty sick, he didn't take\
  \ any damage during all those rounds he spent retching after getting exposed to\
  \ a poison!)</p> \n    <p>Because each ancestry entry is your starting point, it\
  \ also gives you some ideas for how you might build or advance your character. For\
  \ instance, the dwarf suggests backgrounds suitable for many sorts of dwarves (acolyte,\
  \ nomad, or warrior) or for those who specifically follow a traditional dwarven\
  \ way of life (barkeep, blacksmith, farmhand, and merchant).</p> \n    <h2>Elves</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>An elf can live up to 600 years, an amount of time fit for appreciating\
  \ the beauty of the natural world, of elegant arts, and of refined magic. Demons\
  \ may haunt ancient elven lands, but you have plenty of time to plan their demise.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Elves' grace gives them an ability boost to Dexterity, and their years\
  \ of study give them one to Intelligence. Their third ability boost can represent\
  \ the other score they developed over the years. Their physical frailty is represented\
  \ by their ability flaw in Constitution, as well as their low racial hit points\
  \ of 6. They speak the Common and Elf languages, and are likely to have an Intelligence\
  \ high enough to select a third language. Elves can see in dim light, and have the\
  \ highest speed of all the ancestries at 30 feet. (Going to three actions per round\
  \ brought the other ancestries that were as fast as elves in Pathfinder First Edition\
  \ down to 25 feet from 30.)</p> \n    <p>Elves' ancestry feats can help them fight\
  \ demons, teach them arcane cantrips, or make their hearing better with the Keen\
  \ Hearing heritage feat. Elves can pick up many things in their long lives, and\
  \ the Ancestral Longevity feat reflects how some of their life experiences might\
  \ fade from the forefront of their memory until they focus on them. This feat allows\
  \ your elf to become trained in a skill of your choice when she prepares for each\
  \ day. If elves' 30-foot speed isn't enough for you, you can even take the Nimble\
  \ feat, which increases your speed by 5 feet and lets you ignore a square of difficult\
  \ terrain during each stride action you take.</p> \n    <p>Good background options\
  \ for elves include hunter for those raised in the wild; noble or scholar for more\
  \ cosmopolitan elves; and acrobat, entertainer, or scout for an elf with a more\
  \ adventurous bent. Elves make good rangers or rogues, and those who wish to study\
  \ spells can pursue the path of the wizard.</p> \n    <p>So which do you think has\
  \ it better? Elves or dwarves? We'll let you think about that and see you again\
  \ here on Monday, when we talk about another class elves' Intelligence points toward:\
