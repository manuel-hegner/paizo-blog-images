  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The Inner Sea region the serves as the core\
  \ of the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting is comprised of over 40 independent\
  \ nation states and unincorporated regions, each home to diverse populations and\
  \ the setting of countless adventures. And in the heart of the Inner Sea lies the\
  \ Isle of Kortos (which translated from ancient Azlanti means \"Starstone Isle\"\
  ) and on it, the world's largest metropolisâ€”the teeming city of Absalom.</p> \n\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Roman Roland Kuteynikov</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Founded\
  \ nearly 5,000 years ago by Aroden, the Last Azlanti, when he raised the isle and\
  \ the Starstone from the Inner Sea floor, and in so doing became a living god, Absalom\
  \ is the home of some of the region's most illustrious organizations, including\
  \ the Pathfinder Society from whom the entire game gets its name. It was here that\
  \ four mortals attained divinity by passing the Test of the Starstone, and here\
  \ that countless would-be gods have laid unsuccessful siege to the city to claim\
  \ the Starstone for themselves. Aptly called the City at the Center of the World,\
  \ Absalom is a veritable melting pot of all of Golarion's myriad ancestries, cultures,\
  \ and faiths.</p> \n    <p>In updating the setting for the <em>Age of Lost Omens\
  \ World Guide</em>, we looked at scores of sources that fleshed out the vast city,\
  \ incorporating events, locations, and personalities that grew organically over\
  \ the last 12 years. Many of these sources were Pathfinder Society Scenarios, and\
  \ players of the largest Pathfinder campaign in the world will notice a lot of their\
  \ efforts represented in the current state of the city. Slavery has been abolished;\
  \ the long-serving primarch, Lord Gyr of House Gixx, has disappeared (retired captain\
  \ of the city's First Watch, Wynsal Starborn, rules in his absence); the magical\
  \ cornucopias gifted by Aroden to the people of the city to provide for them in\
  \ times of siege no longer work. Other updates come from adventures and sourcebooks\
  \ from distant lands, such as Watcher-Lord Ulthun II of Lastwall's migration from\
  \ Vigil to Absalom, from which he and his goblin aide-de-camp now coordinate operations\
  \ for Lastwall's knights throughout the world. Now, why would he have done that?</p>\

  \    </div> \n    <p>In large part, the updates to the city proper are the consolidation\
  \ of hundreds of developments over the game's history, but that's not the case for\
  \ the Isle of Kortos at large. Despite its prominent location, the island has received\
  \ very little love in the last decade, so Paizo's Chief Creative Officer and Publisher,\
  \ Erik Mona, sprang into action and personally filled the island with dozens of\
  \ new adventure locations, many linked to the island's ancient history and its ties\
  \ to the dead god, Aroden! Among the many new features gracing the island are a\
  \ series of Aeon Towers, monolithic towers with glowing pinnacles believed to have\
  \ been created by the Last Azlanti himself. The Aeon Towers (and much of the interior\
  \ of the Starstone Isle) play a prominent role in the sophomore second edition Adventure\
  \ Path, Extinction Curse, which launches in January, but you can get your first\
  \ glimpse into this expanded world in August!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
