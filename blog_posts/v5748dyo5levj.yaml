  \ Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywc\"><i>The Wizard's Mask</i></a>,\
  \ is getting ready to ship out to stores and subscribers! Folks have been asking\
  \ us for years when we planned on releasing an Ed Greenwood Pathfinder novel, and\
  \ it's hardly surprising—after all, Ed is responsible for both the Forgotten Realms\
  \ and Elminster, his wizardly alter-ego who's without question one of the most recognizable\
  \ characters to come out of fantasy RPGs. Now, at last, all those Greenwood fans\
  \ will finally get to see what happens when Ed's turned loose in Golarion for a\
  \ complete novel, and I can safely say that <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywc\"><i>The\
  \ Wizard's Mask</i></a> is chock-full of all the crazy action, witty repartee, and\
  \ detailed world building you'd expect!</span></p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8ywc\"\
  ><i>The Wizard's Mask</i></a> is set in the middle of the conflict between authoritarian\
  \ Molthune and rebellious Nirmathas, with the heroes caught up in a deadly game\
  \ of espionage and magical missions, and you can read more about it <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywc\"\
  >here</a> or check out a brand new free story featuring Tantaerra, the halfling\
  \ half of its protagonist duo, on the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5leu0?A-Matter-of-Knives\"\
  >weekly web fiction</a>. Yet the thing I want to talk about today isn't the heroes\
  \ or their quest, but that awesome cat on the novel's cover!</p> \n    <p>You see,\
  \ fiction isn't the only way Ed Greenwood's contributed to the Pathfinder campaign\
  \ setting. Way back in the Kingmaker Adventure Path, we brought Ed in to help suggest\
  \ monsters for that AP's bestiary. He came up with a bunch of crazy stuff, but one\
  \ that stuck in everybody's heads was the dweomercat from Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #36, a First World creature attracted to magic that has the strange ability to\
  \ teleport whenever it's targeted by a spell. Naturally, when it came time for Ed\
  \ to plan out a novel, we were all excited to see the dweomercat step back into\
  \ the spotlight.</p> \n    <p>Though native to the First World, dweomercats sometimes\
  \ pop up in particularly magical areas of the Material Plane as well, having followed\
  \ the metaphysical scent of magic through planar rifts. While I don't want to give\
  \ any spoilers about the book, it's safe to say that you'll be seeing plenty of\
  \ these furry magic junkies in <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywc\"><i>The Wizard's Mask</i></a>,\
  \ and they're not nearly as cuddly as they look...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \     <p><b>Dweomer Leap (Su)</b> When a dweomercat is targeted by a spell or within\
  \ the area of effect of a spell, it can, as an immediate action, choose to teleport\
  \ to a square adjacent to the spell's caster, effectively appearing mid-leap and\
  \ aimed toward the caster. This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not\
  \ the spell overcomes the dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat\
  \ can immediately make a full attack against the spell's caster as though pouncing.\
  \ Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe\
  \ space adjacent to the caster—or if the dweomercat chooses—the dweomercat can forgo\
  \ using this ability.</p> \n     <p><b>Spell Link (Su)</b> When a dweomercat is\
  \ targeted by a spell or within the area of effect of a spell, it can, as an immediate\
  \ action, forgo its dweomer leap ability to gain an effect related to the school\
  \ of the spell targeting it. This effect activates before the dweomercat is affected\
  \ by the spell targeting it and regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes\
  \ its spell resistance. Each power lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell targeting\
  \ the dweomercat, until the dweomercat uses this ability again, or until the dweomercat\
  \ chooses to dismiss the effect as a free action, whichever duration is shortest.\
  \ This ability does not prevent the spell affecting the dweomercat from taking effect;\
  \ it only provides an additional benefit.<br> <i>Abjuration:</i> Gains acid, cold,\
  \ fire, electricity, or sonic resistance equal to 2 per spell level.<br> <i>Conjuration:</i>\
  \ Gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to +1 for every 5 levels of the spell.<br>\
  \ <i>Divination:</i> Gains the effects of detect chaos/evil/good/law.<br> <i>Enchantment:</i>\
  \ Grants the effects of the spell heroism.<br> <i>Evocation:</i> Inflicts an amount\
  \ of damage equal to the spell's level upon the spell's caster.<br> <i>Illusion:</i>\
  \ Grants the effects of invisibility. This effect ends as per the spell.<br> <i>Necromancy:</i>\
  \ Gains the effects of false life, as if cast by the opposing spell's caster.<br>\
  \ <i>Transmutation:</i> Gains an enhancement bonus on its natural weapons equal\
  \ to +1 for every 5 levels of the spell.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\"\
