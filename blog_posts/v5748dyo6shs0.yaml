  \ by Lucas Villalva Machado</p> \n      <h3>Clark Valentine (he/him)</h3> \n   \
  \   <p>I’ve been a part-time freelance designer and writer of tabletop RPGs for\
  \ over 15 years, and I love fantasy adventure games like Pathfinder. I’m a big believer\
  \ in setting design and worldbuilding through small details; what services people\
  \ sell, what specialized gear a toolkit contains, and what capabilities people put\
  \ into a magic item tells you a lot about how people live in the world. I’m really\
  \ excited to be contributing to Pathfinder’s worldbuilding through this sort of\
  \ design work. In addition to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, you can also find my work\
  \ in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em> and <em>Bestiary 3</em> for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition and in lots of games from numerous publishers across the tabletop\
  \ RPG scene such as Fate Accelerated Edition, Tachyon Squadron, and Sentinel Comics\
  \ RPG. Making games is a family activity for me; my wife and daughter are both award-winning\
  \ RPG writers and editors. My son is an award-winning robot builder which, while\
  \ not games, is pretty awesome. Our cats have not yet won any awards, to the whole\
  \ family’s bewilderment. You can find me on Twitter under my name, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clarkvalentine\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@clarkvalentine</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Sen H.H.S.\
  \ (she/her)</h3> \n      <p>Hello, Paizo fans and supporters! I’m Sen H.H.S., a\
  \ TTRPG freelance writer based on the other side of the Pacific, who often specializes\
  \ in Chinese-inspired TTRPG content. You might have seen my work in Bestiary 3,\
  \ as well as the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix’s second volume, “Ready? Fight!”. In\
  \ addition to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, you’ll find more of my work in upcoming\
  \ publications such as <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, and <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>.\
  \ You can follow me on Twitter @SenHHS, where you’ll get the latest news on what\
  \ I’m up do, be it projects for other systems or my self-publications. In addition,\
  \ starting on the 28th of August, I’ll be joining a biweekly stream of a Fists of\
  \ the Ruby Phoenix liveplay as a player. Be sure to follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrailMixTales\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@TrailMixTales</a> on Twitter to be notified when we’re on!</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Ron Lundeen (he/him) – Paizo Development Manager</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, development manager of Pathfinder here at Paizo. I\
  \ wrote up several spells for this book, including a few involving gravity—for which\
  \ I used quite a bit of \"what do I like that my Starfinder characters can do that\
  \ I want to do in Pathfinder?\" thinking! You can check out my RPG advice, including\
  \ an entire free Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Path I wrote, on my blog at\
  \ <a href=\"http://runamokgames.com/\">RunAmokGames.com</a>. I’m available for freelance\
  \ for any number of game systems at <a href=\"mailto:rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com\"\
  >rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Mari Tokuda (she/her)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Mari Tokuda is both a writer and a big, old nerd. You can find her\
  \ work in the Dishonored and Dune RPGs alongside <em>Secrets of Magic</em>... with\
  \ many more projects in the works! She has also written short fiction for the most\
  \ recent version of the tabletop skirmish game Malifaux.</p> \n      <p>She has\
  \ a retired racing greyhound who is totally spoiled and totally deserves to be.\
  \ She believes Seattle is the best city in the world, that the Civilization games\
  \ are the best videogames ever, and that anthropomorphized food is super creepy.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>You can find her on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maritokuda\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@maritokuda</a> and on her website at <a href=\"https://www.maritokuda.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">maritokuda.com</a>. You can also hear her chat about all things\
  \ Asian American on her podcast, the Yellow Ranger Fanclub.</p> \n      <p>Finally,\
  \ she finds writing about herself in the third person really weird and uncomfortable.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Logan Bonner (he/him) – Pathfinder Lead Designer</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hi, there! I'm Logan Bonner, the Pathfinder Lead Designer and also\
  \ the design lead on <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. As you might guess from that, this\
  \ book is a big one for me and a chance to show off the vision we have for how further\
  \ rulebooks look now that the core tools for GMs and players are out there. The\
  \ plan was to make a book that's fun to read—not just useful for its mechanics—\
  that you'll want to have on your shelf for years and years. I put a lot of time\
  \ into this book and worked with all these other amazing authors (it's a big author\
  \ pool compared to most books!) to get their fun ideas in there. Thanks to all these\
  \ cool people for their contributions! For my part, I wrote the magus, magical tattoos,\
  \ and spellhearts, and created things to fill blanks during development. I've been\
  \ at Paizo for 9 years, first arriving to edit on Ultimate Equipment, and have been\
  \ in RPGs since 2006, working on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the Spectaculars superhero\
  \ RPG, the Mistborn Adventure Game, Dragon Age, and lots more. I've kept myself\
  \ busy during the pandemic with weekly RPG nights (including a long-running Star\
  \ Trek Adventures game), an online comic book club with some friends, and way too\
  \ much sitting around watching YouTube. I can be found on Twitter, where I'm <a\

  \      <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3> \n      <p><em>Secrets of Magic</em>\
  \ might be my favorite author project to date! I'm so grateful for the opportunity\
  \ to contribute to several sections that meant a lot to me. I'm always happiest\
  \ in nature, so it was a joy to draw on that reverence for the primal treatise.\
  \ And while space is always limited, I had a lot of background ideas that went into\
  \ the witch's journey and I hope you enjoy the peek into her story!</p> \n     \
  \ <p>My writing has also appeared in <em>Bestiary 3</em> (arboreals and kokogiak),\
  \ <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (arctic biome), the upcoming <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Grand Bazaar</em> (REDACTED), and more, but you'll see my name with far more regularity\
  \ (sometimes credited as Simone Dietzler) alongside Paizo's incredible crew of editors.\
  \ When I'm not editing or writing, I'm—you guessed it—reading, gaming, or soaking\
  \ up that primal magic on walks in the woods. You can find me on Instagram <a href=\"\
  https://www.instagram.com/wildwoodedits/\">@wildwoodedits</a> and Twitter <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/virsamajor\">@virsamajor</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>David\
  \ N. Ross (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>It was my pleasure to devise some new cantrips\
  \ and other magic for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, my twelfth contribution to Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition. I drew a fair bit of inspiration from superhero cartoons and games\
  \ I loved when I was a little gay kid, which I hope will bring the same joy to players.\
  \ When I'm not writing for Paizo, I'm a prolific freelance writer, designer, and\
  \ developer of third-party products compatible with Pathfinder (first and second\
  \ editions), Starfinder, and D&amp;D. My recent releases include the second volume\
  \ of Fists of the Ruby Phoenix, a small part of the unapologetic original cyberpunk\
  \ game <em>Hard Wired Island</em> from Weird Age Games, and <em>Legendary Sorcerers</em>\
  \ from Legendary Games (compatible with Pathfinder First Edition). You can find\
  \ me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds\">@DavidRossWorlds</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Tonya Woldridge (she/her) – Paizo Organized Play Manager</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>While writing papers in college, I never envisioned earning author\
  \ bylines for my words. While my focus at Paizo is more coordination than book creation,\
  \ I’ve enjoyed the opportunities I’ve had to “cross over” and try something new.\
  \ My biggest assignment so far was <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a>, which included the\
  \ history of the Pathfinder Society, several lodges, a faction, and designing the\
  \ lodge heraldry. For <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\"\
  ><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, my contribution included non-magical backgrounds.\
  \ I’ve got no other upcoming projects releasing, as I’ve taken a hiatus from writing\
  \ during the pandemic. But keep an eye out for me writing for future publications.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>In my off time, I like spending time in the kitchen, most often baking.\
  \ I love reading cookbooks and have several shelves of a bookcase dedicated to volumes\
  \ from medieval times to present. Right now, I’m enjoying making Korean cuisine\
  \ for dinners and refining my cream clotting &amp; scone baking techniques so I\
  \ can enjoy a proper English cream tea. You can find me on Facebook (PaizoOrgPlay),\
  \ Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaizoOrgPlay\">@PaizoOPM</a>) and Discord\
  \ (TonyaOPM#6396). We’ve got PaizoCon Online Europe coming up this weekend – consider\
  \ dropping by the <a href=\"http://paizo.events/\">Paizo Events</a> server and say\
  \ hi or join us for a game!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Tan Shao Han (he/him)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>I'm an indie RPG designer and co-founder of the Curious Chimeras, an\
  \ indie RPG design house in Singapore. I'm also part of #RPGSEA (<a href=\"https://across-rpgsea.com/\"\
  >https://across-rpgsea.com</a>) a movement and allyship of RPG creators who feel\
  \ and work with an affinity with diverse Southeast Asian RPG communities. My work\
  \ for Paizo includes freelancing for several Pathfinder Second Edition projects;\
  \ I enjoy designing spells, equipment, and otherworldly beings which can enrich\
  \ players' experiences through hinting at the existence of larger, richer worlds\
  \ behind the scenes. For example, I've had the opportunity to work on two different\
  \ undead beings recently for Pathfinder: the new jiang-shi in <em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #167: Ready? Fight!</em>, and the abandoned zealot in Bestiary 3. These creatures\
  \ are both supporting characters for players to interact with, as well as characters\
  \ in their own right, with identities, desires, and anxieties rooted in their places\
  \ in Golarion's milieu; I hope players and GMs will enjoy weaving these beings into\
  \ their own campaigns and emergent stories.</p> \n      <p>You can find my design\
  \ work for the Curious Chimeras at <a href=\"https://curiouschimeras.itch.io/\"\

  \ Hoskins</h3> \n      <p>Hello! I'm the author behind the Cathartic Magic and Thassilonian\
  \ Rune Magic sections of the book, bringing you all the emotional powered goodness.\
  \ As a long-time lover of all things Thassilonian, and someone who almost got herself\
  \ a real Sihedron tattoo, I hope you get as much enjoyment playing those dedications\
  \ as much as I had writing them. While you're contemplating your next emotionally\
  \ fueled spellcaster, consider rolling one up for Abomination Vaults! I had the\
  \ honor to write “Hands of the Devil,” book 2 of 3 in that Adventure path. Find\
  \ me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NinjaCatVanessa\">@NinjaCatVanessa</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>John Compton (he/him) – Paizo Senior Developer</h3> \n\
  \      <p>I’m John Compton, Starfinder senior developer and longtime Pathfinder\
  \ author. On my first day at Paizo, colleagues encouraged me to pick a custom avatar\
  \ for use on our website, and thanks to the physical resemblance, Djavin Vhrest,\
  \ Curator of Apocrypha at the Forae Logos library became my visual signature. Especially\
  \ as I worked on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4d?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Concordance-of-Rivals\"\
  ><em>Concordance of Rivals</em></a> I quickly connected with the character’s voice,\
  \ mannerisms, and subtle barbs as we explored fictitious occultism. When the bard\
  \ became the archetypical occult spellcaster in Pathfinder’s second edition, I found\
  \ myself struggling to understand that new association forged between eclectic,\
  \ storytelling musicians and the spooky, weird magic. Through the lens of Djavin\
  \ Vhrest, I found an answer, and it’s my delight to have explored the nature of\
  \ occult spellcasting in <em>Secrets of Magic</em>.</p> \n      <p>If you’d like\
  \ to hear more from me, I frequent Twitter (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Archaeotagh\"\
  >@archaeotagh</a>), as well as the Pathfinder RPG and Starfinder RPG servers on\
  \ Discord. Definitely check out my more recent works like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em></a> (nanocyte, mechs, drones, demolitions,\
  \ and more), <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024x2?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Vast-Experiment-Falling-into-Deliverance\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #3-04: Falling Into Deliverance</em></a>, and recent\
  \ fiction featuring the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shqu?Meet-the-Iconics-Veerkea\"\
  >iconic nanocyte</a>. I love writing about our setting, its history, its cosmology,\
  \ and its cultures, and it’s my pleasure to have contributed to those through works\
  \ like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, as well as upcoming books like <a href=\"\
