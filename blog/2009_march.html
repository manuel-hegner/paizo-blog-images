<h1><br>Snagged from the Vault: The Great Beyond, A Guide to the Multiverse</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 31, 2009</p>
<p><i>From the depths of the vault we bring you another glimpse into <a href="/store/v5748btpy84bb"></i>The Great Beyond</a>, illustrated by Sarah Stone...

<p>Individual keketars range from 7 to 40 feet long, though they constantly shift and change like the unformed reality of the Maelstrom itself, altering color and serpentine banding patterns, shrinking or elongating, and undergoing even more radical physical changes. However, a keketar possesses two static features: first, whatever configuration its body takes, its eyes are always a piercing shade of violet; and second, a whirling ring of ever-changing symbols floats above and around its head like a shapeshifting crown. The cloud's symbols coil, snarl, and intermingle with one another, gradually merging and mutating without apparent pattern. Each keketar is marked by unique stylistic elements within the symbols and the general orientation and appearance of the crown&mdash;useful for distinguishing between different individuals. They can hide or manifest this crown at will, but they usually leave it visible.</p>

<br clear=all><br><img src="/image/content/Portraits/LouAgresta_120.jpeg" align=left hspace=12><br>
<p><b>Lou Agresta</b><br> 
Fantasy game design crept up on Lou Agresta in 2005, when diamondthrone.com accepted his first articles on true names. Until then a writer of travelogues, indie comics, fashion essays, and torturous, self-indulgent philosophy tracts, his more recent adventure credits include SAW #1 and #12 of the Trodoon Gate Saga (LPJ Designs), <i>The Bloody Fix</i> and <i>The Punctured Vein</i> with Rone Barton (O0negames), and Pathfinder Society Scenario #8: <i>Slave Pits of Absalom</i>. Lou is one of six authors from the Great City Campaign Setting (0onegames), a contributor to Sinister Adventures, and chief-scribbler over at the RPGAggression blog. A member of the Werecabbages freelance writer's guild, he also had his fingers in both the GM Gems and PC Pearls collaborations (Goodman Games) and has made guest appearances as Cthu-Lou on the Atomic Array podcast. Lou's set piece, slated for Pathfinder #24, will likely prove the last of its kind. <i>Dungeon</i> acquired his first adventure, written with Nicolas Logue, then canceled the magazine, leaving Lou forever haunted by the fear he is somehow responsible. Lou lives somewhere in upstate NY with his wife, daughter, a dog, and a couple of horses. While he has sometimes worn a kilt and ridden a tractor, no one has ever caught him doing both.</p>

<br clear=all><br><img src="/image/content/RPGSuperstar/RobMcCreary.jpg" align=left hspace=12><br>
<p><b>Rob McCreary</b><br> 
Rob McCreary was born in Japan and raised in the United States. He started gaming when the red Basic D&D boxed set came out. Rob currently lives in Prague, Czech Republic, where he is an English teacher by day and freelancer by night. Rob made it to last year's RPG Superstar Top 4 with a combination of coin belts, ziggurat-filled jungles, and monkey-goblins. Thus far he has contributed to the <i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, several <i>Pathfinder</i> Bestiaries, and the upcoming <i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i>. Rob is currently scrambling to finish writing the final installment of the upcoming Legacy of Fire Adventure Path, "The Final Wish."</p>

<p><b>Jason Nelson</b> 
Jason Nelson is in the job market as a professor of education (have doctorate, will travel!) and a devoted Christian who lives in Seattle, Washington with his two kids, Allen and Meshia, and has been gaming since 1981. He's hardcore enough that he uses the name of his first-ever D&D character, Tjaden, in his email address, and he's also devious enough to have slipped the name of his fiancee into the <i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, to her great amusement and delight. Jason was some combination of lucky and good enough to make the Final Four in the inaugural RPG Superstar and has also written a number of adventures and articles for <i>Dungeon</i> and <i>Dragon</i> magazines (ah, memories) and over a hundred webcolumns for Wizards of the Coast, including the long-running "Save My Game" and "Behind the Screen." More recently, he has contributed to <i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i> and several <i>Pathfinder</i> Bestiaries, co-wrote <i>Osirion: Land of the Pharaohs</i>, and is the author of "The End of Eternity", the fourth adventure in the Legacy of Fire Adventure Path. It's awesome! You should totally go buy a copy!</p>

<br clear=all><h2>Events</h2>

We still have a few badges left&mdash;don't be left out, buy yours today! In addition to the events below, Pathfinder Society members of all levels and experience will be able to participate in a Friday night interactive penned by Erik Mona and Joshua J. Frost that's sure to keep people talking for years!</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #23:<br><i>Tide of Morning</i> by Steven Robert (for Tier 1&ndash;5)</b><br>
Venture-Captain Dennel Hamshanks sends you to convince an Andoren druid named Hemzel to allow the Pathfinder Society to study his recently discovered lorestone, a minor magical item that unlocks some of the mysteries of the ancient Andoren druid circles. When you arrive and find Hemzel murdered and the lorestone missing, you must race against time to recover the lorestone and stop Hemzel's murderers from using it against the druids of Andoran.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #24:<br><i>The Decline of Glory</i> by Tim Hitchcock (for Tier 1&ndash;7)</b></p>
When the son of a famous Pathfinder gains control of his father's holdings in Taldor, the Pathfinder Society decides to build a new lodge there as a base to explore the many ruins of that crumbling empire. Unfortunately, the Taldan Phalanx has its eye on the holdings and an ancient curse has turned many of the residents into the walking dead. Can you survive the tangled web of Taldor's politics and fight off the echoes of the past or will you, too, see your glory decline?</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #25:<br><i>Hands of the Muted God</i> by Clinton J. Boomer (for Tier 5&ndash;9)</b><br>
When the man who would be the Muted God wordlessly stepped beyond the gates of the Starstone's Cathedral, his thousand and one faithful ringing the Ascendant Court watched with the silent contemplation that is their highest sacrament. When he failed to emerge, many of his penitents abandoned their vows but a small sect remained loyal and worshipful. You and your fellow Pathfinders are sent into the mountains north of Absalom to follow the path of a doomed party and uncover the secrets of the Muted God. His loyal band of followers, called the Hand, will stop at nothing to keep you away from their shrine&mdash;even forming an alliance with some of Golarion's most evil denizens.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #26:<br><i>Lost at Bitter End</i> by Joshua J. Frost (for Tier 7&ndash;11)</b><br>
When a Pathfinder Society Priest of Nethys disappears in northern Geb while studying the Mana Wastes, the Society sends you to uncover his whereabouts and find his journals. Arriving in the town of Bitter End, you find it deserted but for a few mysterious creatures never before seen on Golarion. Those creatures quickly lead to more and soon you're embroiled in a mystery that could affect the very fabric of reality. Will you solve the mystery of Bitter End or find yourself lost forever in the Mana Wastes?</p>

<p><b>Cursed Lot: New Beginnings, GMed by Jason Bulmahn</b><br>
Last year, a group of brave, but horribly cursed adventurers set out on a brave adventure. While one succeeded to be rid of his terrible curse, the rest suffered and even worse fate. This year, a new band of unfortunately cursed heroes takes on an even greater challenge... to rescue a missing dog. How hard could that be?</p>

<p><b>Fires Over Brinestump, GMed by James Jacobs</b><br>
It's been three years since the last time goblins have been a problem on the Lost Coast, but last night, a band of Licktoad Goblins from the Brinestump Marsh lit a merchant wagon on fire. The lone survivior almost made it to the town of Sandpoint before dying of his burns, and shortly after his body is discovered, fireworks bloom over Brinestump Marsh, lighting the night sky south of Sandpoint in an unmistakable display of goblin celebration. Why are the Licktoad Goblins on the march? Who gave them fireworks? Does this herald the advent of another goblin invasion of the town of Sandpoint? A Pathfinder RPG adventure for six 1st level characters.</p>

<p><b>Into the Scarlet Monastery, GMed by Sean K Reynolds</b>
The zealots of the Scarlet Monastery have been a blight on the world for three years. Reviled by all, they hate against all nonhumans, accuse their enemies of spreading plague, and lynch innocents in the name of their crusade. Now is the time to defeat their Commander. But are two orc warriors, a troll mage, a warlock, an undead rogue, and a minotaur druid up to the task?</p>

<p><b>Before Nightfall, a PFPRG Playtest for a work in progress, GMed by F. Wesley Schneider</b><br>
Forsaken, some places are best left to their haunted memories and the shadows of things best left forgotten. On the Ustalavic frontieer, one such ruin has long loomed over the lives and nightmares of the local peasents, a monument to terrors that can never be forgotten. Now a terrible new life has returned to the dreaded citadel, one that seeks to renew the horrors of centuries past. Take up arms and explore the deadly grounds and labyinthine courtyards of a soon to be infamous gothic castle, offer your advice and feedback on what makes for exciting horror roleplaying, and participate in the creation of a terrifying new adventure written in the tradition of one of the most famous horror RPG modules of all time.</p>

<p><b>Short Fiction Workshop</b><br>
Paizo Fiction Editor James L. Sutter and Editor Christopher Paul Carey critique your short fiction! James and Chris will critique your story from an editorial viewpoint and go over it with you, focusing especially on the opening and those red flags editors use to quickly reject stories, helping you hone your writing and make it past an editor's initial cut. Please note that workshopping will be on a first-come, first-served basis during the listed timeslot&mdash;you can sign up so you don't have to wait around the whole time.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario Open Call Workshop</b><br>
A future Pathfinder Society Scenario for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game will be decided on at PAIZOCON 2009! Soon, Paizo's Events Manager Joshua J. Frost will put out an open call for one of the fall Pathfinder Society Scenarios&mdash;a call that can only be answered by attendees at PAIZOCON 2009! All who contributed may attend this workshop where Joshua will go over why each scenario was and wasn't accepted. For a unique look inside the creative mind of the guy who brings you your monthly installment of Pathfinder Society scenarios, look no further than this seminar! This event will be capped at 20 attendees.</p>

<p>... and much, much more! Don't delay&mdash;sign up for PAIZOCON 2009 today!</p>

<p>And thus, the <a href="/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jq"><i>Bastards of Erebus</i></a> playtest comes to a close, and we, the brave and foolhardy adventurers, are victorious. Highlights of the night: my half-orc dropping to negative 1 but holding out for one more round (thanks to orc ferocity) and dealing max damage before finally dropping; David's rogue once again getting hoodwinked by some sort of fear effect/spell and running terrified into the dark; one of the villains, down to about 1 hit point, turning to the main antagonist and pleading for help, only to have the villain reply, "Your sacrifice will be remembered!" and then torching him&mdash;along with us&mdash;with <i>burning hands</i>; our dwarf fighter running after said antagonist while he fled, pulling out his throwing axe and ending his movement just in range, and then hurling it into the back of his skull, just as he was about to vanish out the door, slaying him and thus concluding the adventure.</p>

<p>All in all, a fun adventure. It was also a lot of fun playtesting the latest version of the Pathfinder rules, which I really enjoyed. I'm not sure if we'll get to participate in the playtests for the rest of the AP, but I can say I'm really excited to find out what happens next...</p>

<h1><br>Roots & Beginnings: Taldor</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 24, 2009</p>

<p>Next month, <a href="/store/v5748btpy84bi"><i>Pathfinder Companion: Taldor, Echoes of Glory</i></a> will be hitting the bookshelves of game stores and subscribers everywhere. Hank and I had the opportunity to edit the book recently, and Taldor will definitely please those gamers that enjoy a little (or large) dose of Byzantine politics in their game.</p>

<p>I spoke with Joshua J. Frost, the Events Manager for the <a href="h/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> and the author of <a href="/store/v5748btpy84bi"><i>Taldor, Echoes of Glory</i></a>, about the sources of inspiration for Taldor. According to Josh, he envisioned the decadent, failing empire as a mix between the cultural decadence of Amsterdam during the 16th and 17th centuries and the exceedingly complicated politics and government of the Byzantine Empire.</p>

<p>The Gilded City of Oppara, the heart of Taldor and the rotten core of a failing empire, was modeled after the opulence and corruption found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Amsterdam">historical Amsterdam</a>. At the time, the economics of the city were largely geared toward making a handful of individuals obscenely wealthy, while the rest remained mired in the middle and lower classes. Such a division between rich and poor is obviously reflected in the politics of the Gilded City, where the Royalty and Senatorial classes live in opulent decadence while the masses toil away as laborers, conscripted soldiers, and penniless vagabonds. 16th and 17th century London also inspired the aristocratic culture of Taldor, particularly with regard to the importance young men of Oppara place on the possession of a fine sword; the concept of Oppara's "young blades" comes directly from this period of British history.</p>

<p>Josh's studies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> inspired Taldor's convoluted political system. The expansive bureaucracy of the Taldan empire, the power of the emperor to elevate officials and common citizens to higher ranks, and the division between the "bearded" aristocracy and the "unbearded" masses were all modeled after the complicated politics of the Byzantine aristocracy. In particular, the tendency of the Byzantine emperor to bestow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_aristocracy_and_bureaucracy#Court_titles" target="_blank">numerous, seemingly redundant titles</a> upon "the Bearded Ones" of the aristocracy directly inspired Taldor's elaborate hierarchy of aristocratic titles.</p> 

<p>GMs who love to include political intrigue should look no farther than the Byzantine Empire&mdash;indeed, the bureaucracy of the empire was so vast and tortuous that the word "Byzantine" has become synonymous with decadence and duplicity. If you can't wait to include dangerous, double-dealing political intrigue in your campaign, or to simply explore the decaying empire of Taldor in greater detail, look for <a href="/store/v5748btpy84bi"><i>Pathfinder Companion: Taldor, Echoes of Glory</i></a> next month!</p>

<p class=date>March 23, 2009</p>

<p><i>Though the golem has grown ever craftier and his traps ever more insidious, my colleague and I managed to distract him just long enough to swipe a quick preview of the upcoming Pathfinder Chronicles product, <a href="/store/v5748btpy85ji"><i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i></a>, illustrated here by Michael Jaecks...</i></p>

<p><i>Vadid and Nahk</i> 
<br>Preview Purloiners</p>

<p> Mimics are asexual, and reproduce via spores. When a mimic controls enough food and territory, it undergoes an involuntary internal change called spatter-spawning, laying out a large, thick glue-carpet of spore-rich protoplasm 30 or more feet in diameter. Having marked the walls and floor of a particular cavern or ruin with this stinking graffiti, it departs, never to return. Immature mimics bud out of the whitish glue-carpet, forming multi-hued, chitin-plated plasmoids the size of housecats; immediately ambulatory and capable of camouflage, these miniature mimics feed upon the glue-carpet, each other, and those helpless scavengers attracted by the stench and subsequently trapped by the glue.</p>

<p><i>Look for the full article on mimcs in <a href="/store/v5748btpy85ji">Dungeon Denizens Revisited</a>!</i></p>

<p>Hail Paizonians! David and I just wanted to give a sneak glimpse into the office by sharing what passes for a casual gaming collection around here: the Paizo bookshelf.</p>

<p>This  bulky display holds a staggering array of RPGs, enough to bury a grown man (or several small 
children). Ready to be thumbed through for inspiration, relaxation, or pure nostalgic bliss, these dusty tomes are outdone only by the complete volumes of <a href="/amazingStories/issues"><i>Amazing Stories</i></a> that march one after another across the top like some sort of Hugonian crown. And if you didn't feel like reading, you could always just play a game of Star Wars foosball!</p>

<p>How anyone gets any work done with this kind of distraction is a wonder...</p>

<h1>Presenting the Gen Con 2009 Scenarios!</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, March 19, 2009</p>

<p>I've spent a huge portion of this week thinking about and planning for Gen Con 2009. As most of you know, we're launching the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game at Gen Con, which means we're also kicking off Season 1 of Pathfinder Society Organized Play. The first slot of the show, Thursday morning, will be a character creation/conversion seminar with Paizo employees and volunteer GMs who have all seen the rules ahead of time and will be available to answer questions and help you either build a new character or follow our soon-to-be-released conversion guidelines for Season 1. We'll cut everyone loose before the dealer hall opens so they can hop in what will assuredly be a long line for the RPG hardcover itself and then let everyone flow back to the Org Play area to finish their characters alongside their shiny new (possibly autographed) Pathfinder Roleplaying Game books.</p>

<p>The real fun kicks off Thursday afternoon when we launch Season 1 of Pathfinder Society Organized Play! We have four outstanding scenarios written by four outstanding scenario authors (if I do say so myself) who will all be in attendance at Gen Con and will likely GM their own scenarios once or twice as surprise GMs throughout the show. Tim Hitchcock and the Werecabbages are brewing a brilliant Friday and Saturday night interactive event for the Pathfinder Society that I cannot reveal the details about yet as the lycanthropic vegetable club would stake me and eat my brains for doing so. Rest assured, when Tim pitched me the idea, I ran screaming through the office declaring it the best idea since horseshoes.</p>

<p>Here are some quick summaries of the four scenarios we'll be running at Gen Con 2009:</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 29</b>:<br>
<i>The Devil We Know, Part 1: Shipyard Rats</i> (Tiers 1&ndash;7) by Joshua J. Frost<br>
When simultaneous kidnappings of Pathfinder and Aspis Consortium agents rock Cassomir's imperial shipyards, the Society orders you to join forces with hated Aspis agents to solve the mystery. Can you work together with the enemies of the Society to uncover the source of the kidnappings, or will you perish in the shipyards of Cassomir? Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 30</b>:<br>
<i>The Devil We Know, Part 2: Cassomir's Locker</i> (Tiers 1&ndash;7) by Joshua J. Frost<br>
The Pathfinder Society dispatches you into the catacombs beneath the shipyards known as Cassomir's Locker to uncover the source of a shamanistic rat cult that's breeding monstrous vermin never before seen on Golarion. After thwarting a double-cross and delving into the dirty dungeons below, will you find the artifact that powers Cassomir's Locker in time or will you bring about the destruction of Taldor's most important port? Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 31</b>:<br>
<i>Sniper in the Deep</i> (Tiers 5&ndash;9) by David Eitelbach & Hank Woon<br>
When rumors stir of a hidden treasure ship in Absalom's Flotsam Graveyard, the Pathfinder Society sends you beneath the Inner Sea to investigate. Mayhem, undersea adventure, and chaos are to be had in this rousing rampage beneath the roiling waters of Absalom's harbor. Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 32</b>:<br>
<i>Drow of the Darklands Pyramid</i> (Tiers 7&ndash;11) by Sean K Reynolds<br>
A rogue band of drow are plaguing the artifact shipping lanes of Osirion and the Pathfinder Society has sent you to stop them. When the drow capture an entire caravan laden with Society relics, the Decemvirate orders you into the Darklands to track down the drow and their stolen cargo. You'll travel beneath Golarion, fighting through caverns of hideous creatures to reach the fabled Darklands Pyramid&mdash;will your survive the journey, or become a slave forever? Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to congratulate the selectees for the final 3.5 Pathfinder Society Organized Play Open Call: Elizabeth Leib and James MacKenzie! They're writing #28 <i>Lyrics of Extinction</i> and #27 <i>Our Lady of Silver</i> respectively. Congratulations!</p>

<br>Events Manager</p>

<p><b>Chivalry Tarnished</b>
<br>Knights, fair maidens, heroic adventures, and righteous quests&mdash;these are the legends of old Taldor. But the once powerful empire has fallen from its former glory. Now rival nobles battle each other with bitter knights and proxy armies for personal power rather than honor. A smoldering truce with Qadira again threatens to ignite into war, and Taldor's daughter states look down upon her with contempt. Yet there is still greatness in Taldor, a stone foundation under the flaking gold adornments. Sons and daughters of forgotten royal bloodlines hear change on the wind&mdash;but is it the whisper of greatness to come, or the death rattle of an empire long past its prime?</p>

<p>This Pathfinder Companion describes the country of Taldor and its capital of Oppara. Become one of the Lion Blades, a secret agent prestige class for the empire! Learn the magic of the oppressed church of the Dawnflower! Rise to greatness from humble origins with new feats! Gain the ostentatious magic of Taldor's wealthy elite! Taldor needs champions&mdash;are you ready for the challenge?</p>

<p>Woe unto <i>three</i>.</p>

<p>Between us, the number three must have come up at least a dozen times. Still, it's higher than 1, so I guess that means we're getting better. Plus it was fun to watch Sean bang his head repeatedly against the dry erase board after the tenth 3 popped up.</p>

<p>David forgot his dice again, I think that's what did us in (not only did he forget his dice, but when he first sat down he had forgotten his character and pencil, too!). Later his rogue was hoodwinked into attacking Beaky, which kept us out of the fight for several rounds (me because my druid was busy chasing after him, trying to prevent him from killing my eagle).</p>

<p>I think the adventure is getting close to wrapping up, though. Sean said that if it weren't for the astoundingly poor rolls session after session, we surely would have been finished by now. He left us at a cliffhanger: right as my character burst through a door (that's her new gig, bursting through doors before the rest of the party is ready), he set up the room and called it a night, with a newly revealed NPC calling out his chilling promises of death and ruin; unless it was Sean saying it out of character to us, I'm not quite sure...</p>

<h1><br>The Fabled Appendix &ndash; James Jacobs (Part 2)</h1>
<p class=date>Monday, March 16, 2009</p>

<p>Today we continue the series on Paizo's Appendix N with the second part of my interview with James Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of Pathfinder. We pick up where we left off, as James finishes discussing his most important literary influences and closes the interview with an explanation of his favorite horror films.</p>

<p><b>James</b>: Stephen King's Dark Tower books were particularly influential, as they are as much magic and science fiction as they are horror. What's neat is that all of his stories are interconnected, like Lovecraft's. Names and locations reappear and become part of King's mythos&mdash;which also includes nods to the Cthulhu Mythos. I think King very successfully straddles the fine line between homage and pastiche, as it's easy enough to write in the style of Lovecraft and other classic horror authors, but much harder to use those themes while writing with your own voice. Stephen King does this admirably.</p>

<p>F. Paul Wilson, and particularly his character Repairman Jack, was another big influence. The series of stories featuring Repairman Jack are like modern-day X-Files, except that one of the primary themes is the idea that it's just one man versus cosmic horror.</p>

<p>Ramsey Campbell was another influence; he's a British author who began his career writing Lovecraftian horror fiction but later moved on to more psychological horror themes such as madness, ghosts, and deranged murderers.</p>

<p><i>The Descent</i>, by Jeff Long, really captured my imagination. Without giving away too many details, the novel is essentially about a real-world Darklands. Humans live on the surface of the world, oblivious to the fact that "other" descendents from our common ancestors live beneath them; in the novel, Long explains that, over the course of human history, these creatures have served as the basis for humanity's shared myths of devils living beneath the earth.</p>

<p><b>David</b>: That's quite an extensive list of fiction! But you're even bigger movie buff, correct? Tell us about the movies that most influenced you.</p>

<p><b>James</b>: There's probably too many to name all of them; I have a wall of DVDs in my apartment. In terms of movies, my main interest is still horror. When I was a kid, my dad and I would watch <i>Creature Features</i>, a TV series that aired a new monster flick every Saturday night. So my love of horror movies began at an early age. My two all-time favorites are, without a doubt, <i>Alien</i> and John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i>.</p>

<p>To rattle off other big influences, there's <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>, <i>Godzilla</i> (which asks the question "what if the atomic bomb was actually a creature?"; there is a scene in the movie where a bunch of kids are horribly burned and crying for their moms, not realized that they've been killed—it's super-grisly), <i>Jaws</i>, <i>the Exorcist</i>, <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, Schwarzenegger's <i>Conan</i>, <i>Psycho</i>, <i>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</i>, <i>Lilo & Stitch</i> (Stitch served as a primary inspiration for Pathfinder goblins, both in terms of look and personality), and the classic 1950s horror film <i>Tarantula</i>.</p>

<p>Whenever I assign adventures to freelance authors, I like to point them to movies that will give them an idea of the tone we are shooting for&mdash;it's much faster for authors to find inspiration by watching a 2-hour movie than to read an entire book, although if they have time in the sometimes too-short deadlines we give them, books can remain a great source of inspiration. For instance, I told Richard Pett to check out the old Hammer Horror movies when he was writing "The Skinsaw Murders" and pointed Nick Logue at <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i>, <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, and <i>Deliverance</i> for "The Hook Mountain Massacre."</p>

<p>Overall, I would have to say that my two biggest inspirations are H. P. Lovecraft for books, and John Carpenter for movies.</p>
<br>
<p>Thus concludes my interview with James Jacobs. Thanks for taking the time to discuss your biggest inspirations, James, and thanks for reading, Paizonians! Come back again as we continue to expand Paizo's own Appendix N!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lords, caretakers, and architects of the eternal city of Axis, the axiomites possess a wide variety of outward forms, oddly unlike the uniformity displayed by their fellow natives, the hive-dwelling formians. A random cross-section of axiomite society contains those who resemble flawless, perfect humanoids of all descriptions&mdash;typically humans, elves, tieflings, dwarves, halflings, giants, and even gnomes&mdash;but these outward shapes belie their true forms, which can be seen briefly whenever the axiomites move or perform any complex actions. During such moments, their bodies partly dissolve into glowing clouds of golden, crystalline dust. The clouds move and contort on their own accord, temporarily congealing into twisting lines of mathematic symbols and complex tangles of equations. Each axiomite is actually an immortal construct of living, intelligent mathematics approximating a humanoid shape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Astradaemons appear as ghostly, faintly phosphorescent, rail-thin humanoids with exaggeratedly long limbs. The fiends also have a seemingly random number of translucent tentacles trailing from their backs, shoulders, and upper arms, which wave and weave through the air. Their bizarre forms possess heads that are skeletal, elongated, and vaguely piscine, reptilian, or canine, always bearing hungry rictus grins. Wicked, curved claws sprout from their hands and feet, and each creature’s tail moves in rhythm with its tentacles, typically hanging toward the ground and almost doubling its length.
As the perpetually ravenous servitors of Abbadon’s archdaemons, the astradaemons’ touch is corruptive and damaging to the spiritual material of souls. Their touch and especially their bite can cause horrific damage, akin to that of a wraith, to anything they attack. Most feared, however, is their ability to utterly consume the souls of those killed in their proximity, feeding off of their essence or dragging it back to their fiendish overlords.</p>

<h1><br>Snagged from the Vault: Pathfinder #21&mdash;The Jackal's Price</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, March 12, 2009</p>

<p><i>Once again, the foolhardy Purloiners have braved the depths of the Vault of the Golem to bring you, our faithful readers, a glimpse of the future. Featured here today is the cover of <a href="/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bf"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #21&mdash;The Jackal's Price</a>.

<br>Preview Purloiners</p>

<p>A strange artifact discovered in the belly of an ancient ruin has all of Katapesh intrigued. Yet none can decipher the strange markings, nor confirm much about the scroll's purpose beyond the fact that the magic it contains is powerful indeed. In order to learn more, a trip to the sprawling market city of Katapesh itself must be mounted. Yet others want the map for themselves&mdash;scheming merchants eager to make their fortunes with its sale, enraged gnolls eager to reclaim what they feel rightfully belongs to them, and even a sinister hidden society willing to murder to claim the treasure as its own. What could be hidden within that could drive so many to such desperate acts of violence and mayhem? Is this artifact truly the one and only <i>Scroll of Kakishon</i>, and does the one who controls it control an entire world?</p>

<h1><br>Bastards of Erebus&mdash;Playtest Four</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, March 11, 2009</p>

<p>I love it when a plan comes together. We had pressed forward with our arrangement, but suddenly discovered a new element that had to be overcome&mdash;a lone guard. We decided to do the only smart and reasonable thing... kill him. After we feathered our foe, Sean sketched a quick depiction of the quite-deader-than-dead fella, and then we continued on our merry way, straight into an encounter fest. We only made it a short way in before Sean called it a night, and right now we're chasing down a cowardly fiend who just locked himself behind a door.</p>

<p>Much to our surprise, not only did nobody die this time, but we actually did really well. I think it's because I finally remembered my dice.</p>

<p>One thing I'd like to mention is how I've never had a GM so cunningly use (or insist upon) the rules for light radius. (And, apparently, neither have my 3 companions, since I'm the only one who bought any torches during character creation.) Anyway, I've decided that I like it. It's been adding a whole new dimension to our tactics, which is always fun. In fact, in one of the earlier sessions (I believe the first), our dwarf and some of the "enemy" got into this fun little game of tossing torches back and forth in attempts to grant visibility to one's side while denying it for the other. In this last session, our rogue, who had languished behind for a round to recover his crossbow, was literally left in the dark, which greatly affected his options.</p>

<p>So, during the next episode of "Bastards of Erebus," will our heroes continue on to victory? Will the players finally remember to bring their dice? Will their characters remember to buy some sort of illuminating device? Tune it next time to find out!</p>

<p>Hello Paizonians! I would just like to take a moment to talk about, for those of you who are not already aware, the <a href="http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/" target="_blank">Pathfinder Wiki</a>. The Pathfinder Wiki is a community project run by our forum's very own yoda8myhead, and to date has over 1,100 articles related to Golarion and various Pathfinder-related products. If you haven't had the pleasure, you should hop on over there and check it out. Or, if you're interested in helping to build a vast database for you and your fellow Pathfinder GMs, contribute something yourself! (There are tutorials and help articles for the wiki illiterate.) While, of course, we don't condone verbatim copies of our products being regurgitated in a public forum, we do appreciate and welcome brief and succinct synopses of Pathfinder content. Basically, it would be great if you know someone who is interested in learning about Pathfinder for you to be able to point them to the wiki and have it do the job of introducing him or her to all the goodness that is Pathfinder.</p>

<p>So, whether you're looking for more information on this character or that country, hoping to introduce your players to Golarion, or want to help build a fantastic Pathfinder resource, stop on by the Pathfinder Wiki when you get the chance.</p>

<h1><br>The Fabled Appendix &ndash; James Jacobs (Part 1)</h1>
<p class=date>Monday, March 9, 2009</p>

<p>As part of the ongoing series about Paizo's own Appendix N, I had the opportunity to interview the editor-in-chief of <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i>, James Jacobs, about the books and movies that most inspire his own writing. He proved very generous with his time and gave me quite a detailed look into his plan of a "shared mythology" for Pathfinder and the sources that inspired its creation. Once again, the interview proved long enough that I have had to break it into two parts. In this first part, James discusses his literary influences.</p>



<p><b>David</b>: Although I know you're a huge fan of movies, and horror films in particular, let's discuss books first. Which authors or works have stuck the longest in your mind?</p>

<p><b>James</b>: H. P. Lovecraft was definitely the biggest inspiration. He's my favorite author, and not just mine: Stephen King, Robert Bloch, Gary Gygax, and others expanded on the themes that he created. Lovecraft didn't want to write about vampires or other classic creatures of horror, as these had become cliché at the time when he was writing, so he created his own pantheon of cosmically horrific, god-like beings. He was particularly successful because he encouraged other authors to use the names he had used. Robert Bloch, Fritz Leiber, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, and Henry Kuttner were all contemporaries of Lovecraft who communicated with him and were influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos that he created. He also pieced together another pantheon of creatures throughout the works of authors for whom he was a ghostwriter, which expanded the Mythos. So his influence is pretty far-reaching.</p>

<p>This is very much like what's going on with the OGL&mdash;here are the base concepts of D&D, and other writers or companies can build and share a single mythology. This is what happened with Lovecraft&mdash;his themes of cosmic horror influenced the likes of Stephen King; this was the horror of the ordinary, in which libraries and shacks in the woods could become places of terror. Horror is the main source of my inspiration, and why grisly things are going on in <i>Pathfinder</i>. I like to find authors who can carry on this vision&mdash;Nic Logue and Richard Pett being two great examples.</p>

<p>Clive Barker is another big inspiration. My grandma and grandpa introduced me to old horror novels and comics when I was young. I remember reading my grandpa's <i>Vault of the Unknown</i>, <i>Tales of the Unexpected</i>, <i>House of Mysteries</i>, and <i>Beware!</i> My grandma would shove Clive Barker or Stephen King into my hands and tell me, "Read this! You'll enjoy it!" Zon-Kuthon is the most obvious example of Barker's influence on Pathfinder, as he is basically a Cenobite from <i>Hellraiser</i>. As Barker's stories mellowed out and became less gory, they took on a more magical, fantastical tone. In fact, his novel <i>Weaveworld</i> served as a primary inspiration for the demiplane of Kakishon in <a href="/pathfinder/v5748btpy85jn"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #22, "The Edge of Eternity."</a></p>



<p>It appears that this post has already exceeded the length I was aiming for; the rest of the interview, it seems, must wait for later. In the second installment, James rounds out his discussion of his favorite authors, discusses the fine line between homage and pastiche, and talks about the movies that most influenced his style of game design.</p>

<p><i>Once again, fellow Paizonians, my colleague and I have managed to pilfer a spectacular sneak glimpse into the vault. Behold the Zephyr Guard, illustrated here by Jason Engle...</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p> Though the Pactmasters are rarely seen outside their palace walls, they are keenly alert of all that transpires within Katapesh through their network of spies and active patrols of the Zephyr Guard. The Zephyr Guard is made up of diverse ethnic groups and races, but mostly humanoids such as humans, half-elves, and half-orcs. Their unifying feature is their expertise in combat and the precision with which they carry out their duties. A Zephyr Guard squad is usually composed of five elite soldiers (LN fighter 4) and their squad leader (LN fighter 6). Each squad leader carries a <i>charm of aluum control</i>, which is magically bound to them, making it useless to anyone else. Aluum are powerful golems created to maintain order in Katapesh when other forms of authority fail (see the Appendix for statistics). Dormant aluum are scattered through the city in key locations for the Zephyr Guard. They stand silent vigil at street corners, in the shadows of buildings, around busy squares, and throughout the numerous bazaars. No matter where one goes in Katapesh, an aluum is never far away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Look for the full article on the Zephyr Guard in the upcoming product, <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84ba">Pathfinder Chronicles: Dark Markets&mdash;A Guide to Katapesh</a>!</i></p>

<h1><br>Bastards of Erebus Playtest Three</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, March 4, 2009</p>

<p>"Forget the dwarf! Tumble past the bad guys, get the bird, and let's get the heck out of here!"</p>

<p>Things were not going well for us. David started calling these playtesting sessions "The Misadventures of Erebus." But still, it was fun. The interesting thing about this playtest was all of the planning and options involved. For this encounter, we had to choose from a number of stratagems. After finally deciding upon one, we launched into action. I again cast <i>entangle</i> (Sean has taken to calling my druid "The Entangler"), summoned an owl, cast <i>magic fang</i> on my eagle, then sent the two avian avengers to flank one of the baddies. We were also using some new rules of Jason's for animal companions, and because of a typo my eagle and summoned ally got severely nerfed. The actual rules are nicely balanced, but my tactic ended up being of little help because of the misunderstanding, and Sean quickly (and gleefully, I might add) turned them into feathery piñatas.</p>

<p>After my eagle, Beaky, and our dwarf fighter dropped, and my summoned ally vanished, I called out the line of the night to David, who refused to either run away or pick up my eagle. I warned him, though, that if he dropped too, I was only picking up my animal companion. Well, to make a long story short, we're going to be refighting this battle next session. ;)</p>

<p>So we continued with the story, and we were soon presented with more stratagem planning. I really like this about the adventure. So far with the 3 parts we have played through, there have always been a number of choices, each with its own interesting tactical advantages and disadvantages. This always ends up with a lot of debating, but I've long been a fan of this sort of thing because it keeps the players engaged. Of course, we always have the standard rush-forward-and-kick-down-the-door option, but unlike many modules out there, this isn't funneling us down a path where our only real options are which door we want to open next.</p>

<p> We had just settled upon our tactic for the third part of the adventure when Sean called it a night. Now we have to wait another week before we get to see if our carefully laid plans will lead to glorious victory or to humiliating defeat... May Shelyn protect us!</p>

<h1>The City of Glimmerhold from Clash of the Kingslayers</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, March 4, 2009</p>

<p>The Pathfinder module <a href="/pathfinder/v5748btpy86uz"><i>Clash of the Kingslayers</i></a> by RPG Superstar author Leandra Christine Schneider takes place in and around the dwarven city of Glimmerhold. During the development of the adventure, the text ended up running a little long. To make some room, we dropped the map of Glimmerhold, as little of the combat action takes place in the city, and including the map wasn’t critical for running the adventure. However, the map (drawn by Rob Lazzaretti) is really cool, showing a pillared dwarven city in the middle of an artificial lake. So here it is, ready for exploration by curious PCs.<p>

<p>Warning: This map image is a potential spoiler for part of the adventure. If you expect to be a player in this adventure, avert your eyes!<p>

<h1><br>Planetary Style</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 3, 2009</p>

<p>I'm going to talk a little bit about writing style today&mdash;not only because it's something that all of us should think about when reading in general, but in particular since it's something I think we should mull over when reading classics from <a href="/planetStories">the Planet Stories library</a>. Writing styles change over time, some of them seemingly eternal, others appearing one moment only to flitter into oblivion in the next as the winds of fashion shift. A thousand cultural variables account for such changes, and its my view that no single stylistic element is by itself better or worse than another. It all depends on how that element adds to the story being told.</p>

<p>I have a graduate background in writing fiction, but I was lucky enough to be in one of the few programs out there that didn't turn up its nose at genre. And while I was in school, we talked a lot about what it took to make a classic. Why was one book considered a classic, and another not? The best answer I heard was Time. Because Dickens and Twain certainly weren't thinking of writing literary masterpieces, at least no more than any author takes pride in the crafting of words. No, they wrote for a popular audience, their works by-and-large considered entertainment fiction by their contemporaries.</i>

<p>Now the classic science fiction and fantasy adventures we gleefully resurrect at Planet Stories aren't written in today's styles. But there's a life in them, a sheer exuberance of derring-do, that I often find missing in contemporary fiction. Not that there isn't amazing stuff being written today&mdash;there will be as many classics written this year as there were in 1939. But I think as we go through these turbulent times of ours, we can benefit from the experience of another time of troubles, a time when rocket ships roared out of spaceports of the imagination, or when a rapier, quick wit, and a smile might win freedom for an entire planet. So try out some <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy83x9">Brackett</a>, some <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy83x8">Kline</a>, or some <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdo">Moore</a> and join us on our adventure. After all, adventure is part of the human spirit&mdash;it never goes out of style.<p>

<h1><br>Roots &amp; Beginnings: Genies of Golarion</h1>
<p class=date>Monday, March 2, 2009</p>

<p>One of the perks about being an intern at Paizo is that I have the privilege of reading and editing Pathfinder material that I would normally peruse in my free time. In my first week here at Paizo, in fact, I was handed a manuscript for an article that will be appearing in <a href="/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bf"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #21</a>, "The Jackal's Price." This article describes the various cultures of genies and legends surrounding geniekind, and should prove very useful for those GMs seeking to expand their players' encounters with these mythological creatures in the Legacy of Fire Adventure Path. I had a chance to speak with Wes recently about the historical and mythological sources that were referenced in the creation of Golarion's genies.</p>

<p>One of the most comprehensive sources is <i>The Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern Mythology and Religion</i> by Jan Knappert. In the pages of this reference guide, sandwiched between the entries for <i>Jilani</i> and <i>Jiris</i> (the Arabic form of the name George, apparently), is a fairly long explanation of <i>jinns</i>. Knappert explains that in Islamic countries, spirits are divided among jinns</i>, <i>shaytans</i>, <i>ifrits</i>, and <i>marids</i>, and that in Ancient Persia some jinns and other evil spirits were referred to as <i>div</i> (which also have a role as a new breed of fiends in Legacy of Fire). The entry goes on to illustrate examples of genies from myth, for instance, Knappert explains that many jinns "have ugly and terrifying forms" as a result of God's curse for copulating with animals.</p>

<p>Another source that was referenced is <i>Everyman's Dictionary of Non-Classical Mythology</i> by Egerton Sykes. Among other things, this book was used as a reference to further develop the shaitans, the new earth-based genie that was created as a replacement for closed-content earth genies. The brief entry explains that <i>shaitan</i> was the Islamic name for devil, and the it also "applied to the third species of jinn."</p> 

<p>Wikipedia also proved to be an invaluable font of (sometimes questionable) knowledge about genies and Middle Eastern mythology in general. In the entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit" target="_blank">ifrit</a>, for example, an ifrit is described as "an enormous winged creature of smoke, either male or female, who lives underground and frequents ruins." The entry goes on to explain, "While ordinary weapons and forces have no power over them, they are susceptible to magic, which humans can use to kill them or to capture and enslave them." Already sounding like RPG text, entries like this can do a lot to spark GMs' imaginations.</p>

<p>Hopefully these sources can serve as a launching pad for your own investigations into the nature of the always-unpredictable and dangerous genies and can inspire you to flesh out the nature of genies in your own games. You can also look forward to a detailed exploration of genies and their society showing up in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #21. Also check out Jesper Ejsing's djinni illustration appearing on the cover of that volume. He starts a series of four cover characters who, while not necessarily specific personalities in the Adventure Path, epitomize the genies featuring prominently in each.</p>
