  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 19, 2011</p> \n   <p>About a decade ago,\
  \ the unwritten rules for success in the tabletop roleplaying game industry were\
  \ rewritten by the most dangerous man in gaming. Ryan Dancey, then a vice president\
  \ at Wizards of the Coast, championed the idea of \"open gaming.\" This idea was\
  \ clearly crazy. Take the crown jewels of the most popular roleplaying game in history\
  \ and give them away to your competition, for free? Madness!</p> \n   <p>In retrospect,\
  \ it was not so crazy after all. That decision changed the entire industry. Hundreds\
  \ of publishers, including Paizo, have since taken advantage of Ryan's foresight.\
  \ The core innovation was the OGL, the Open Gaming License, but the real meat was\
  \ in the SRD: the System Reference Document, the rules you actually needed to play\
  \ the game.</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/srd.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">original SRD</a> was a collection of exported Microsoft Word\
  \ documents. The rules you needed were in there, but it wasn't very user friendly.\
  \ Over the years, fans have taken it upon themselves to <a href=\"http://www.d20srd.org/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">organize</a> and <a href=\"http://dndsrd.net/\">hyperlink</a>\
  \ that content, earning the enduring gratitude of countless gamers.</p> \n   <p>When\
  \ Paizo launched the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, we stood on the shoulders of the\
  \ giants who came before us. Open gaming is at the heart of everything we do. What\
  \ better way to help the fans play their favorite game than to publish the rules,\
  \ for free, in an accessible and hyperlinked format? And so, the PRD was born: <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/\">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Reference Document</a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We take our commitment to open gaming seriously, so we update the PRD\
  \ with the open content from each of our new rulebooks. For the release of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz\">Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</a>, we decided to\
  \ put a little extra into our revision. Take a look at the new <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/\"\
  >Pathfinder Reference Document</a>. Now look at it using your phone, or your iPad.\
  \ Notice anything different? That's right, it doesn't suck anymore! We've put a\
  \ lot of effort into making it as useable as possible.</p> \n   <p>I hope this latest\
  \ presentation of the rules to the world's best roleplaying game makes lots of people\
  \ happy. Happy people have a way of becoming happy customers, and that's the key\
  \ to our ability to keep on producing great content for your game.</p> \n   <p>P.S.\
  \ The current PRD consists of over 2,000 files and more than 50,000 hyperlinks and\
  \ is produced by tiny robots from our original InDesign documents, so there are\
  \ bound to be some problems. Please <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizo/websiteFeedback/theNewPRD\"\
  >post here</a> if you find any.</p> \n   <p>Gary Teter<br> <i>Software Developer</i></p>\
