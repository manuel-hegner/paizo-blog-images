  \              <p itemprop=\"description\">With two online conventions under our\
  \ belt, we’ve got our processes down. That being said, there are still several more\
  \ in the pipeline – Virtually Expo (to replace UK Games Expo) and Gen Con being\
  \ the next on the horizon. Besides conventions, we have lots more going on in the\
  \ OP realm, so I’m going to end my musings with a huge thank you to all our GMs\
  \ and volunteers organizing games. As the world starts to resume in-person gatherings,\
  \ I’ll note each community will decide when and how to approach in person gaming\
  \ and request that all our players work with their organizers to take suggested\
  \ precautions and keep our community safe, healthy, and happy.</p>\n           \
  \   <br clear=\"all\">\n              <h2>Achievement Point Update</h2>\n      \
  \        <p>Another month, another few code rolls getting us ever closer to the\
  \ final launch of the Achievement Points (AcP) system. For those keeping a close\
  \ eye, you may have seen the rolls last week. They fixed our outstanding issues\
  \ but had a few unintended problems that we needed to resolve before we could keep\
  \ the roll live. We’ve now resolved character number issues, points accrued from\
  \ Premier and Premier Plus events, GM credits, and how boons generate from the system,\
  \ as well as a few other back end items. This is in line to be resolved after our\
  \ long weekend and we hope to have the final deployment soon.</p>\n            \
  \  <p>This brings into question the free rebuild boon that is currently on the site.\
  \ I said previously that we would remove the boon two weeks after AcP went live.\
  \ Given that we are less than 30 days from the release of the Advanced Players Guide,\
  \ I want to amend my commentary. We will extend the date of the free rebuild to\
  \ <b>31 August</b>. This allows us enough time to get the APG sanctioned and for\
  \ players to use the rebuild to include options from that book.</p>\n          \
  \    <p>We’ve made a change to the rebuild boon, however. One of the code rolls\
  \ gave the ability to customize the boons beyond the one sentence preview. With\
  \ this live, we are adjusting the rebuild boon to the style we will use with all\
  \ other AcP purchases. The full text of the boon outlines the parameters for rebuild,\
  \ including a all changes are final once character is played and a slight recalculation\
  \ of the gold your character has post-rebuild, to account for any consumables you\
  \ have purchased &amp; used as well as a favorable resale value of items. This is\
  \ intended to make the rebuild easier: rather than having to calculate the value\
  \ of every item you have purchased and used since creating the character, you will\
  \ now simply have 85% of the gold you have earned during the character’s career\
  \ to that point. This revised rebuild went live today. Any unapplied rebuilds that\
  \ don’t this text will still be honored. In that case, the player should utilize\
  \ the 85% rule when rebuilding. Players who rebuilt characters prior to this blog\
  \ do not need to make adjustments to their characters. In all cases, a copy of the\
  \ boon should be included in the character’s chronicle sheet history.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>Another note on AcP. Most of the point totals have settled. You can\
  \ review your totals in your “My Organized Play” section of Paizo.com. If you are\
  \ seeing errors in your AcP count, make sure to click the “Refresh Points” button\
  \ on the GM/Event Coordinator tab of your My Organized Play page. If there are still\
  \ errors, check to make sure all your games are reported. If they aren’t, please\
  \ reach out to the coordinator/local venture officer with your chronicles to get\
  \ the game entered into the system. If all games are accounted for, then email <a\
  \ href=\"mailto:pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com\">pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com</a>\
  \ with as much detail as you can about the errors so that we can take a look and\
  \ make adjustments as needed. This email should also be used for any other reporting\
  \ errors if your GM or event coordinator is unable to fix them.</p>\n          \
  \    <p>One final piece of AcP. We’ve solicited a list of frequently asked questions\
  \ and are working on putting together answers. We hope to have this done before\
  \ it goes live and will post a link in the comments as well as distribute the link\
  \ to our community.</p>\n              <h2>Gen Con Online</h2>\n              <p>Our\
  \ next major online convention is just weeks away! Gen Con Online will be July 30-August\
  \ 2, and we currently have nearly 900 games on offer for our four programs. The\
  \ event catalog will be available for preview on July 6 on <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con’s website</a>. For GMs who haven’t signed up yet, we\
  \ invite you to register for the OPF Major Events discord, as there are still opportunities\
  \ to volunteer; for more information on how to play or GM games, visit <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sha1?Organized-Play-at-Gen-Con-Online-2020\"\
  >last week’s blog post</a>. Next week we’ll be previewing the new scenario releases\
  \ you’ll see at Gen Con Online.</p>\n              <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\n      \
  \        <p>This month, we <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9i?June-2020-Pathfinder-Society-Releases\"\
  >released the sanctioning</a> for the Age of Ashes Adventure Path for Pathfinder\
  \ (second edition). Players and GMs may now report their sessions and earn credit\
  \ for the AP. Additionally, last week we announced the winner of the Battle of the\
  \ Pantheons contest, and their pantheon has <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sha2?Battle-of-the-Pantheons-Winner-Announcement\"\
  >officially been sanctioned</a> as well!</p>\n              <p>Going forward, we\
  \ have plans to get Near Space sanctioned for Starfinder Society and the Advanced\
  \ Player’s Guide sanctioned for Pathfinder Society before the end of the month.\
  \ There may be more, but these two are the next ones on our radar.</p>\n       \
  \       <h2>Volunteer Recognition.</h2>\n              <p>No new campaign coins\
  \ have been awarded since PaizoCon Online.</p>\n              <p>We did announce\
  \ our Order of the Wayfinder for 2019. We usually announce this recipient at Gen\
  \ Con or PaizoCon, but we held it last year to try and do it in person. Unfortunately,\
  \ our lack of travel thwarted our plans, so we announced it virtually at the most\
  \ recent Venture-Captain gathering when the recipient was in attendance.</p>\n \
  \             <p>The Order of the Wayfinder is a step above the Campaign Coin and\
  \ is given to one person a year in recognition of their efforts on behalf of some\
  \ aspect of the Organized Play Program. Their activities support the actions of\
  \ the entire community and make a huge difference in the quality of our programming.\
  \ The award comes with a wayfinder (compass) with an engraved plaque and a new organized\
  \ play number in the 100’s.</p>\n              <p>Past recipients included Bob Jonquet,\
  \ Auke Teeninga, and Alastair Rigg.</p>\n              <p>Please join me in recognizing\
  \ <b>Alexander Lenz</b> as the 2019 recipient for his coordination of the Additional\
  \ Resources Task Force. The AR Task Force is a group of individuals drawn from the\
  \ volunteer organizers who review published materials for inclusion in the relevant\
  \ organized play campaign and make recommendations to the Organized Play team. Without\
  \ their input, completing our sanctioning documents would be a much different task.\
  \ Thank you, Alex, for the years you’ve spent leading the Task Force!</p>\n    \
  \          <h2>Stars, Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2>\n              <p>We have no new GMs\
  \ to recognize yet, but part of the updates rolling out with AcP will also allow\
  \ our venture-captains to easily and automatically provide evaluations to GMs who\
  \ request them. This will help us automate the process and get our top-tier GMs\
  \ their badges and recognition sooner!</p>\n              <h2>Convention Listing</h2>\n\
  \              <p>Many of the conventions planned for the upcoming months have needed\
  \ to cancel or postpone due to shelter in place orders, but several others moved\
  \ their events online. We’ve listed the status for each event, but please check\
  \ their websites or notices for any last-minute changes.</p>\n              <table\
