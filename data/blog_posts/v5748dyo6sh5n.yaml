  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s barely\
  \ light—just after dawn—and my heart is pounding, hammering in time with the pahtra\
  \ war drum’s rhythm. The visceral stomp of heavily armored boots and the jagged\
  \ crackle of automatic rifle fire roil around us all. The vesk move awkwardly, still\
  \ clumsy and off-balance in gravity that’s far weaker than what they’re used to.\
  \ They carry their laser weapons with pride, firing sleek lines of light through\
  \ the trees, and I find myself baring my teeth in a disdainful snarl. The magnetic\
  \ storms of Vesk-6 make laser weapons risky even at the best of times, but the azimuth\
  \ laser rifle is the standard-issue armament for the Veskarium army, and so the\
  \ vesk carry them. My hands tighten on my own rifle, adrenaline surging as the war\
  \ drum urges us forward. I take to the shadows behind a trio of ancient trees, waiting\
  \ for the right moment to leap into the fray.</p> \n      <p>Is this what my forebears\
  \ felt, some 300 years ago, fighting against the vesk invaders intent on reconquering\
  \ a world they knew they had once controlled? Or even longer ago, before the Gap,\
  \ when the Veskarium first came to Pulonis and claimed it as Vesk-6, the newest\
  \ part of their empire?</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \      </div> \n      <p>But this isn’t a war. We aren’t a guerilla team fending\
  \ off an invasion—it’s a training exercise, and the vesk in the clearing are as\
  \ much my teammates as the other pahtras in the trees around me. The largest and\
  \ boldest vesk in our unit leads the way, with just over a half-dozen others not\
  \ far behind her. One vesk for each pahtra in our unit. Usually we train side-by-side,\
  \ learning from one another, but today we’ve been divided up, pahtras against vesk.\
  \ My own vesk partner stands firmly in the center of his unit, holding his rifle\
  \ steady and firing careful blasts. It’s a typical vesk tactic, all stoic and solid\
  \ and focused on formation, while my half of the unit has split up, each of us blending\
  \ into the trees and utilizing the tactics that work best for us. </p> \n      <p>It\
  \ makes Major Koboratash furious, our disregard for formal strategies. It’s also\
  \ how we’ve won the last six of these mock battles. I wonder what she’s trying to\
  \ accomplish, dividing us up into Team Pahtra and Team Vesk when the high despot’\
  s program has us training side by side in the first place. I know some of my teammates\
  \ think the major is secretly training the vesk to fight some of the pahtra resistance\
  \ cells active near Leapfang Bay. I hope they’re wrong.</p> \n      <p>I wait for\
  \ my chance to leap into the fray, watching for an opening, a distraction, an opportunity.\
  \ My gaze settles on Jaskenayo, a particularly stodgy vesk with dark green scales,\
  \ and the fur down the back of my neck suddenly stiffens. A shiver runs down the\
  \ length of my spine. Something here is... wrong. I can’t say what or why or even\
  \ how I know, but something about him has me deeply unsettled. His movements aren’\
  t quite in step with the others, the tracking of his beady eyes just a little jerky.\
  \ Like he’s watching the skirmish and reacting just a nanosecond too slow to be\
  \ real. I’ve never seen anything like it before, and the tension along my spine\
  \ grows so tight it’s painful. Something here is deeply, terribly wrong.</p> \n\
  \      <p>I slip back into the shadows. Make my way around the simulated firefight,\
  \ slinking along the underbrush, until I’m off to one side, almost opposite our\
  \ war drummer. Slowly, careful not to draw attention to my movements, I dump the\
  \ blanks from my rifle and swap in the magazine of live ammunition from my belt.\
  \ We all carry it, as a precaution against the countless predators of Vesk-6, since\
  \ you never know when a sky viper might turn a training exercise into a life-or-death\
  \ fight. Somehow, even though I can’t say why, I know this is one of those times.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The headstrong scrapper of my unit gives me the opening I need, rushing\
  \ in to take on the frontline vesk with her bare hands like the reckless brawler\
  \ she is. I lift my rifle, take careful aim. Breathe out. Pull the trigger. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>Jaskenayo goes down so easily. He hadn’t seen me, and I was so close\
  \ my single shot punched right through his overplate. He falls with a strangled\
  \ cry. </p> \n      <p>Chaos breaks out. Of course it does—these training exercises\
  \ aren’t supposed to be lethal. Everyone is shouting, and eight standard-issue Veskarium\
  \ laser rifles swing around to focus on me, sharp clicks ringing out as they, too,\
  \ are switched to a lethal setting. The hammering rhythm of the war drum falters,\
  \ and then ceases altogether. My pahtra teammates stare, aghast. I feel my vesk\
  \ partner’s eyes on me, betrayed and furious.</p> \n      <p>My fear—that creeping\
  \ sensation of wrongness—dissipates almost as soon as Jaskenayo’s body hits the\
  \ ground. But it’s immediately replaced by a different kind of fear, less visceral\
  \ and much more intellectual, as Major Koboratash’s outraged shouts resound through\
  \ the jungle. Demanding to know what just happened. What I thought I was doing.\
  \ And I realize, really realize, what I’ve done. I just killed my teammate. Our\
  \ war drummer’s partner. My partner’s childhood friend. </p> \n      <p>The major\
  \ stomps up to me, and I hand over my rifle. I try to explain myself, but I don’\
  t have the words for it. I have no proof, no justification—I just knew something\
  \ was wrong. She doesn’t believe me, of course. She sees a recruit killed by friendly\
  \ fire. A personal vendetta turned lethal. </p> \n      <p>I can’t even pretend\
  \ it was an accident. They’ll court-martial me, and I’ll be discharged, dishonorably,\
  \ without the Soldier’s Due. </p> \n      <p>Then, behind the major, Jaskenayo’\
  s body twitches. I flinch back, and the major spins around as the dead vesk body\
  \ jerks and shudders. Then, horribly, his body seems to deflate as a slick, bulbous\
  \ ooze slithers out from beneath his armor. </p> \n      <p>A hymothoa. </p> \n\
  \      <p>I understand, then. I hadn’t encountered one of the indigenous oozes before,\
  \ but I knew about them. Like how they eat away at a host’s organs and replace them,\
  \ puppeting them around in pursuit of goals no one has ever been able to understand.\
  \ And that some pahtras have something of a sixth sense for hymothoas, when most\
  \ other species have no way to detect them other than with extensive medical scanning—\
  something almost impossible here given our planet’s unpredictable magnetic storms.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The major snaps out an order, and suddenly eight azimuth laser rifles\
  \ are firing on the thing with lethal force. When I blink away the afterimage of\
  \ eight laser beams, all that remains of the hymothoa is a damp patch on the leafy\
  \ jungle floor beside Jaskenayo’s now-unmoving form. I begrudgingly admit to myself\
  \ that the vesk weapons have some benefits after all—my own rifle would have been\
  \ far less effective against an amorphous foe.</p> \n      <p>Major Koboratash looks\
  \ back at me, scowling. “You knew?”</p> \n      <p>I nod and stammer, trying to\
  \ put into words the gut feeling, the absolute certainty that things weren’t the\
  \ way they should be. Childhood tales flit through my mind, warning of the bogeyman\
  \ oozes, but I can’t use a ghost story as a justification. My heart is hammering\
  \ louder than the war drums had before. She can still court-martial me. Have me\
  \ discharged. Order the squad to turn their laser rifles on me and fire—the Army\
  \ of the Veskarium certainly has no overabundance of mercy. </p> \n      <p>But\
  \ she cuts me off with a snarl and a sharp gesture. “That was well done, Gunner\
  \ Sehvet.”</p> \n      <p>I shut my mouth. The major looks between me and the unmoving\
  \ corpse on the jungle floor. I wonder what the ooze had hoped to accomplish by\
  \ parasitizing Jaskenayo. Probably nothing good—for all their inscrutability, the\
  \ creatures seem to have as much resentment of the vesk occupation of our planet\
  \ as the most deeply entrenched pahtra resistance cells.</p> \n      <p>The major\
  \ barks new orders. She turns north and leads the way as if nothing unusual had\
  \ happened. We all leap to comply, vesk and pahtra alike. Lines form as we pair\
  \ up with our counterparts and begin the strict, regimented march back to Command\
  \ 6. My vesk partner falls into place beside me, and I can feel his uneasy eyes\
  \ watching me, but now isn’t the time for chatter. I don’t know what I’d say anyway,\
  \ because I have a sinking feeling this is just the beginning.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
