  Pathfinder Adventure Card Society\">\n      </div> \n      <p>Hi everyone!</p> \n\
  \      <p itemprop=\"description\"> Last month, after countless hours combing thorough\
  \ feedback and iterating improvements to design, Lone Shark released a revision\
  \ to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  >Core Set</a>. Iâ€™ve played every base set of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game,\
  \ so I can say that their hard work has paid off. The Core Set is still fundamentally\
  \ the same game, but the play is smoother, more dynamic, and more exciting. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>The Core Set's release was also a perfect opportunity for the Organized\
  \ Play team to improve the rules of Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. I talked\
  \ about three of the big updates in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgml?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-New-Box-New\"\
  >New Rules, New Opportunities PACS</a> blog. The blog said that we would soon have\
  \ a FAQ that described how to handle updates that weren't already called out in\
  \ the Core Set Rulebook. This FAQ is now available, through the link Core Conversion\
  \ Guide at the bottom of paizo.com/pacg. I'd also like to highlight something I\
  \ said in the comments after that blog. We recognize that people who are deep into\
  \ an ongoing campaign may not want to update the rules immediately. To that end,\
  \ ongoing games may continue to use the Mummy's Mask rulebook until the official\
  \ start of Season 6 at GenCon (August 1st). </p> \n      <p>In Pathfinder Society\
  \ and Starfinder Society, we've established a tradition of releasing sanctioning\
  \ documents for non-Society adventures like modules and adventure paths. These documents\
  \ allow players and GMs to receive credit for their organized play characters in\
  \ adventures that weren't originally designed with organized play in mind. We'd\
  \ never had anything like that for the card game, and that seemed like a missed\
  \ opportunity. We're happy to say that you can now play the Dragon's Demand Adventure\
  \ Path from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  >Core Set</a>, The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a>, and the free RPG day adventure\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  >We Be Heroes?</a> with your Adventure Card Society characters. Each product's paizo.com\
  \ page now includes a pdf describing how to play for PACS credit.</p> \n      <p>We\
  \ also tried a bit of an experiment in Dragon's Demand. The last scenario is a choose-your-own\
  \ builder, which provides 6 different rules structures that you can use to build\
  \ the scenario. This scenario, Wandering Way, is replayable any number of times,\
  \ and the rules in the sanctioning document allow you to play it at any tier. So\
  \ if you're looking for a scenario that any character can play, a way to help a\
  \ character who has missed a few sessions catch up, or a chance to flex your own\
  \ creativity in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, check it out! The addition\
  \ of this scenario to the sanctioned content is a big change, and we welcome your\
  \ feedback on how it's being received and used in your area. </p> \n      <p style=\"\
