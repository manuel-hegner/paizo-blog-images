  \ Path of Virtue</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 7, 2016</p> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">So, earlier\
  \ in the year, the ebb and flow of product workflow had me swooping in to serve\
  \ as the lead developer for a few installments of the Pathfinder Player Companion\
  \ line. Two of these products (Haunted Heroes Handbook and Divine Anthology) had\
  \ already been outlined and assigned to authors, but one of them was completely\
  \ up in the air and left to me to create. I kicked around a few ideas, but time\
  \ and time again those ideas were pretty much 100% inappropriate for a player-facing\
  \ product (they may or may not some day see the light of day in the Campaign Setting\
  \ line or elsewhere). And then I had an epiphany.</p> \n    <p>We hadn't done a\
  \ book about prestige classes in ages.</p> \n    <p>I love prestige classes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And so <a href=\"/products/btpy9oo9\"><em>Paths of the Righteous</em></a>\
  \ was born. My overwhelming preference for prestige classes is that they should\
  \ tie into world flavor and reward players for actually bothering to invest in said\
  \ world's flavor. I knew I didn't want to build a book that just randomly threw\
  \ unrelated prestige classes out there (since I'd already built that book with <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8thj\"><em>Paths of Prestige</em></a>), and tying the flavor\
  \ to various religions made a lot of sense, since I've long been a champion of the\
  \ concept of \"every religion should have its own specialized class.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Prestige classes are the perfect solution to this, and so in Paths of the\
  \ Righteous I decided to focus on the good-aligned faiths of the campaign setting.\
  \ All of the good aligned core deities got a prestige class, along with two of the\
  \ good-aligned \"other gods\"—Kurgess and Milani. That left five spots for prestige\
  \ classes associated with empyreal lords (of which we had more than enough to choose\
  \ from!). Once I had the 14 faiths chosen, I also wanted to make sure that these\
  \ classes would work with as many different character themes as possible. That meant\
  \ building several prestige classes that suggest non-divine spellcasting classes—\
  there's options for wizards and fighters and swashbucklers and much, much more in\
  \ this book!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9474-DevotedMuse.jpg\"\
