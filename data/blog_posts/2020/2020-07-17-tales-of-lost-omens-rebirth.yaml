  description\">The fire in the forest clearing flickered merrily without wood or\
  \ any sounds of crackling. Four fish sizzled on a blue-bronze pan, placed to the\
  \ side to cool enough to safely eat. Candles and incense sticks were set in the\
  \ earth, smoke rising from the smoldering tips to curl upward into the night. The\
  \ occupant of the tidy campsite was absolutely stunning, her outfit rival to the\
  \ leading lady of any royal court, her hair glowing like flame in the light. Yet\
  \ the most notable thing, the thing that should have given Qiu's partners a bit\
  \ of a clue, was the elaborate green mansion that loomed behind her, a home fit\
  \ for nobles in the middle of a forest.</p><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071620_haojin.jpg\"\

  font-size: 13px;\">Art by Vladislav Orlowsk</p>\n              <p><em>You would\
  \ have to be an idiot to go near her. That's a fox woman if I ever saw one</em>,\
  \ Qiu thought to themself. So of course, Qiu's ox-brained partners had decided to\
  \ rob the woman, and nothing the bandit had said could dissuade the rest of their\
  \ party. Qiu had finally given up and left them to their fates, promising to be\
  \ at their backs.<em> And stay at their backs, far out of sight.</em></p>\n    \
  \          <p>Qiu shouldn't have even been that close. Maybe they felt they should\
  \ at least stay and see what happened—that they at least owed their companions that\
  \ much for the victories and spoils that the others had shared with them over the\
  \ years. Maybe it was the woman. It had been so long since Qiu had seen another\
  \ fox hiding behind a human face, another person who Qiu knew was truly like them.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Qiu watched their companions approach. Yahui was being dramatic,\
  \ as usual, trying to scare the woman with his friendly-traveler-turned-threatening-robber\
  \ act, as if anyone believed he was ever friendly. Qiu instinctively ducked behind\
  \ a tree as the woman stood up. Best not to be in the splash zone if any bits of\
  \ giblets came flying their way. Even so, they couldn't help but lean an eye out\
  \ to peek. The woman's hair seemed to lose its gravity as she conjured magic power\
  \ around her...</p>\n              <p>...and then burst into flame, as her form\
  \ morphed into that of a gargantuan bird of fire.</p>\n              <p><em>Phoenix</em>,\
  \ Qiu thought, their jaw dropping open in absolute stupor.</p>\n              <p>Yahui\
  \ and the others weren't any more dignified, dropping their swords, falling to the\
  \ ground, trying desperately to crawl backward away from the searing beast. They\
  \ were bullies, not trained warriors. As they scrambled to their feet to escape,\
  \ the phoenix gestured with a wing, causing a wall of fire to encircle the clearing.\
  \ The magic blaze engulfed the trees, and yet the leaves and boughs did not blacken\
  \ or burn. Yahui noticed, the same as Qui did, and decided to try his luck by leaping\
  \ through the inferno. He was rewarded by his hair and clothes bursting into flames,\
  \ and he shrieked in panic as he rolled against the ground to put himself out.</p>\n\
  \              <br clear=\"all\">\n              <p>It was too much for Qiu to take,\
  \ the shock causing them to lose their grip on their form. Qiu felt a muzzle and\
  \ white fur popping out from their human guise, and rode the transformation a little\
  \ further, shifting all the way past a tailed humanoid into a small, four-legged\
  \ forest creature. If they were lucky, they could pretend to be a common fox—oh,\
  \ but it had been a mistake, a terrible mistake; the heat was unbearable in this\
  \ shape, and Qiu found themself blindly darting out into the clearing to get away\
  \ from those terrible embers and the pain of singed fur and whiskers.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>The woman looked human again by the time Qiu finished rubbing their\
  \ paws on their snout. No chance she hadn't noticed them now, a snow-white fox in\
  \ the middle of her clearing, icy breath fogging in the warm air. Qiu gulped and\
  \ looked around at their fellow bandits, though they knew their companions would\
  \ be no help. At least Yahui looked like he would survive, though he'd likely be\
  \ burned and missing his eyebrows for a while.</p>\n              <p>“Banditry is\
  \ punished by execution, in these lands,” their captor said. “Or at least, so it\
  \ was. The law may have changed, for I have been absent a long age.”</p>\n     \
  \         <p>It hadn't, but Qiu didn't feel it necessary to say that. The other\
  \ bandits gibbered something unintelligible.</p>\n              <p>“But what I do\
  \ now is also unlawful. So are all tragedies—to be caught between honor and humanity,”\
  \ the woman mused, apparently deciding that responses were optional. She gestured\
  \ to Qiu, then lowered her hand to the ground in a clear summons to approach. “\
  You are a huli jing? Let us speak.”</p>\n              <p>Qiu didn't bother trying\
  \ to act dumb. It would be futile. This woman was <em>ancient</em>—it showed in\
  \ her speech, and her power, and her eyes.</p>\n              <p>“That's not a name\
  \ I've heard used in a long time,” Qiu said, slipping back into their true shape,\
  \ a fox-faced humanoid with two tails, so that they could more easily speak. Already\
  \ they could hear the more common names for their kind whispered among their bandit\
  \ colleagues. Fox-demon. Liver-eater. Qiu would never be able to work with them\
  \ again after this. They surprised themself by feeling a sense of mourning at that.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“I am Qiu. What can this humble huli jing do for you?” Qiu asked,\
  \ giving a sitting bow. They did their best to speak formally, out of respect, but\
  \ Qiu felt more like they had managed to land on pretentious instead.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>“I am Hao Jin,” the woman introduced politely, and Qiu at last understood,\
  \ and believed it.</p>\n              <p>The Ruby Phoenix. The most powerful sorcerer\
  \ of a nation and of an age. Perhaps of all ages. There were plenty of children\
  \ named in her honor, but Qiu doubted any possessed the raw magic they had just\
  \ witnessed.</p>\n              <p>She continued, graciously ignoring their expression,\
  \ “I am looking for a dead-people.”</p>\n              <p>“A dead-people?” Qiu echoed.\
  \ It wasn't a phrase they were familiar with, and the literal words didn't quite\
  \ make sense. There were corpses a plenty in this forest, and likely some undead\
  \ as well, but they didn't feel like what Hao Jin was asking for.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>“This is no longer the word that is used?” Hao Jin asked, after a moment\
  \ of hesitation. “A people that the empire of Lung Wa declared dead. Their houses\
  \ are to be destroyed, their records of lineage burned. Their language must never\
  \ be spoken. Their name will become a myth. They are erased. They are no longer\
  \ real.”</p>\n              <p>Qiu chewed their gums at the weight of those words.\
  \ <em>Dead-people</em>. “I do not know how anyone could find such a group. Even\
  \ Lung Wa is something of a myth, these days.”</p>\n              <p>“I remembered\
  \ their name, in defiance. They were the Xijae people. They lived here once,” Hao\
  \ Jin said, standing up to walk inside her ornate green mansion and gesturing for\
  \ Qiu to follow. When they entered, they found a museum room graced with armfuls\
  \ of jewelry, books, and scrolls in a mysterious writing. Costumes and headdresses,\
  \ every thread and color vibrant and pristine. Qiu reached out before they could\
  \ stop themself, eyes open in awe as they examined the embroidery and delicately\
  \ worked metal. They'd never seen patterns like these before, never seen this artistic\
  \ style. It had been <em>erased</em>. Erased before Qiu had been born, <em>stolen</em>\
  \ without them ever knowing—but wait a moment...</p>\n              <p>“I've seen\
  \ these before,” Qiu said after a long thought, rolling a jade and silver bead between\
  \ their fingers. “There was an old man who made them in a village forty li to the\
  \ south.”</p>\n              <p><em>We robbed his shipment blind,</em> Qiu did not\
  \ say. They were starting to feel very bad about that. “I don't know if he's still\
  \ alive, but...”</p>\n              <p>“Show me the way,” Hao Jin commanded, before\
  \ Qiu could think of how to finish that sentence. She stepped back outdoors to set\
  \ her pans and plates back in her house, ushering Qiu outside as well. Qiu watched\
  \ in awe as the building shrunk down to the size of a child's wooden toy in her\
  \ hands. She glanced at the other bandits, seeming to weigh their fate in her hands\
  \ before she evidently decided they weren't worth the distraction. With a wave of\
  \ the sorceress' arms, the wall of fire surrounding the camp vanished. Qiu thought\
  \ they heard her trying to say 'Go forth and do no evil' or something else with\
  \ suitable gravitas, but the bandits were running and screaming before she could\
  \ get that far.</p>\n              <p>“Come,” Hao Jin said, with a sigh at the robbers'\
  \ antics. A gust of wind blew out her campfire; another lifted the two of them into\
  \ the air. They shot up above the earth, to a height that sent Qiu's head spinning—\
  or maybe it was the speed, or the thin air. They barely managed to keep consciousness\
  \ to point out the tiny speck below with one shaking claw. The descent was no slower\
  \ or easier, leaving Qiu gasping for breath as Hao Jin approached the village on\
  \ foot, having been kind enough to the nerves of the residents not to land in the\
  \ middle of their town.</p>\n              <p><em>Now is the time to run</em>, Qiu\
  \ thought.</p>\n              <p>But just the memory of the phrase <em>dead-people</em>\
  \ sent them staggering into the town on the heels of the sorceress. Qiu could see\
  \ that she had taken out the strand of beads Qiu had picked out, holding them up\
  \ to a tiny crowd of four people, as another man hurried out from inside his small\
  \ house with a woman following behind him. By the time Qiu reached the scene, the\
  \ man was holding out his own hand, a trio of similar jade beads presented in his\
  \ palm for Hao Jin to see.</p>\n              <p>“I was given these for safekeeping\
  \ a long time ago,” Hao Jin said, pulling some of her ancient books from seemingly\
  \ nowhere. She offered them to the man with a humble bow. “It has been long past\
  \ the age when I should have returned them. Please, forgive me.”</p>\n         \
  \     <p>Qiu could see the emotions run rampant across the man's face as he carefully\
  \ took the book and opened it. Confusion, morphing into recognition, then disbelief.\
  \ Then a profound and deep-cutting sadness, one that ran back generations, one that\
  \ could never be healed, but perhaps now could be soothed.</p>\n              <p>“\
  My grandfather spoke this,” the village man said, sharply turning his face away\
  \ so that the ancient book's precious, forgotten language could not be smeared and\
  \ ruined by his tears.</p>\n              <p>The former bandit watched the villagers\
  \ crowd around Hao Jin, their voices blending in questions and exclamations. A breeze\
  \ rustled through Qiu’s fur, and they suddenly felt a cold loneliness buried within\
  \ their chest.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n             <p><em>To learn more\
