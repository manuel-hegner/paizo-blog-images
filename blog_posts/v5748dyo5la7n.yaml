  \ \n   <h3>What's better than a high-quality, full-color, 16-page adventure? A free\

  \ June 23rd, gamers celebrate a whole new holiday just for us: Free RPG Day. On\
  \ that Saturday, gamers across the country can stop by their friendly local game\
  \ shops and pick up free roleplaying products. Seeing how much we love free stuff\
  \ here at Paizo, we couldn't help but get involved. Come the 23rd, the first GameMastery\
  \ Module, <i>D0: Hollow's Last Hope</i>, will be available for free at <a href=\"\
  http://www.freerpgday.com/stores.htm\">these stores</a>.</p> \n  </blockquote><a\

  \ we were pretty excited, but pulling it together in time turned out to be a real\
  \ challenge. While we kicked around several ideas, we quickly decided that, since\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wix\"><i>D1: Crown of the Kobold King</i></a> is for\
  \ 2nd-level parties, it only made sense for us to get players to that level with\
  \ an introductory adventure. In fact, the plot of Crown seemed to beg for it, as\
  \ the adventure takes place in a forbidding forest and a ruined dwarven monastery\
  \ but doesn't spend a lot of time getting the PCs there. But therein lay a new roadblock—\
  we didn't want the free adventure to be mandatory for full Crown enjoyment, and\
  \ vice versa. So we thought hard, and hit upon a unique plotline for <i>Hollow's\
  \ Last Hope</i>—the quest for a plague cure—that could stand alone and still allow\
  \ DMs of Crown to strip out the free adventure's plot and tack the extra encounters\
  \ seamlessly onto the beginning of D1.</p> \n   <p>Once that was figured out, the\
  \ biggest hurdle became the time crunch. Because we found out about Free RPG Day\
  \ late in the game, we all—particularly Wes Schneider and me, who teamed up to write\
  \ it—had to pull together and work hard to get the writing, art, layout, etc. finished\
  \ in half the time normally allotted for such a project. (And believe me, the work\
  \ difference between a 16-page module and a 32-pager isn't as large as you'd think.)\
  \ But in the end, we didn't cut any corners, and managed to put together a product\
  \ that looks as great as it reads—cartographer Chris West and the artists over at\
  \ UDON continue to astound us with their work, particularly on such short notice.</p>\

  \ to find in the module itself, I won't spoil things too much, but manipulative\
  \ worgs and animated cauldrons that dance around and swallow people whole sound\
  \ like fun to me. We also made a concerted effort to sprinkle the module liberally\
  \ with details tying in with <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wix\"><i>Crown of the Kobold\
  \ King</i></a>, as well as tidbits that'll go farther toward building up our game\
  \ world. For instance, though the hut you search in <i>Hollow's Last Hope</i> belongs\
  \ to a relatively low-level witch, rumor has it that she actually studied under\
  \ a much more notorious hag from the north... someone whose name you might just\
  \ recognize...</p> \n   <p>For more information on Free RPG Day, go to <a href=\"\
