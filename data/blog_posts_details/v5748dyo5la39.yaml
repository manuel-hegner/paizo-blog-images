  artist: "many theologians and traditionalists as a newcomer to the world's faiths,\
    \ Iomedae the Inheritor seems poised for greatness among the divine. Certainly\
    \ her numerous orders of paladins have risen swiftly to take on the vaunted role\
    \ of paragon in many societies. Evangelical in their exuberance to spread word\
    \ of her wisdom, Iomedae's missionaries were pivotal in the defense during the\
    \ fabled Siege of Solku. They sacrificed their lives saving the town"
