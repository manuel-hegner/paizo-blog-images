  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Harrow is a tarot-like deck usable in everyday life\
  \ or in any roleplaying game. Regardless of where you use it, use it with care.\
  \ A harrow deck is loaded with power, so you must learn to read the cards correctly\
  \ or else suffer an ignominious fate. The most important thing is to treat your\
  \ harrow deck with respect. Disrespect the deck, and the deck will disrespect you.\
  \ That way surely leads to ruin. You don’t want ruin, do you? You want to know how\
  \ to read these cards. </p> \n     <p>Before you conduct a reading, set the stage\
  \ for a dramatic encounter. Clear the table and place the deck in front of you.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The reading is conducted in two parts: first you’ll perform the\
  \ choosing, and then you’ll perform the spread. </p> \n     <h3>The Choosing </h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Ask your subjects—those who come to you for a reading—what they seek\
  \ from it. Phrase the request in the form of a single question, then decide which\
  \ of the six following abilities best suits that question. For example, a question\
  \ of health might indicate the suit of Shields (Constitution), while a question\
  \ regarding love might indicate the suit of Crowns (Charisma). Ultimately, it is\
  \ up to you to choose which suit most fits—a question regarding love could just\
  \ as well draw upon the suit of Stars (Wisdom), for example. </p> \n     <h2>ABILITIES\
  \ AND SOME CORRESPONDING TOPICS </h2> \n     <table> \n      <tbody> \n       <tr>\
  \ \n        <td> <p><strong>Hammers (Strength): </strong>Battle, honor, cruelty</p>\

  \ cards of the suit you have chosen from the harrow deck and shuffle those nine.\

  \ to each pick one card. The chosen card has a message for that person about their\
  \ current place in the world and in relation to the question at hand.</p> \n   \

  \ CARD HARROWINGS</h2> \n     <p>As a fun community exercise, and to show off the\
  \ versatility of the Harrow Deck across RPGs, I asked people to tell me a little\
  \ bit about their player characters and ask a question. I’ve selected a handful\
  \ of these responses to do single card harrow pulls and interpretations. Thank you\
  \ to everyone who shared their characters with me!</p> \n     <p>I have also decided\
  \ to show off a few different ways to do single card readings – some of which are\
  \ covered in the Harrow Deck manual, and some of which are taken from traditional\
  \ cartomancy. </p> \n     <h3>Harrow Rulebook Method (Choosing)</h3> \n     <p>For\
  \ the following two readings, I used the Choosing method described in the Harrow\
  \ Deck Rulebook. For these readings, we determine which ability the question falls\
  \ under, take the cards of the correct suit out, and draw from among those nine\
  \ cards. When shuffling, I turned the cards around several times, so that some could\
  \ be upright and some could be reversed.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ drow chronomancer and artificer, Ptemfuzhi (he/she), who is entering her anger\
  \ stage of trauma. They ask: What should he do about the people who hurt him?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Because the question pertains to past cruelty and trauma, I chose Hammers\
  \ (Strength) and shuffle the cards, and spread them out. Pulling out a card and\
  \ flipping it over, I got The Cyclone in reverse (or misaligned, as the book calls\
  \ it).</p> \n     <p>The Cyclone misaligned indicates renewal after a difficult\
  \ trial. Though your life may seem strewn among the wreckage, you can rebuild and\
  \ emerge stronger than before. The best revenge against those who hurt you is to\
  \ live your best life in spite of them.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Austin (he/him) asked about Qhirc, his kobold\
  \ curse witch and potion maker. He asks: Our party has just lost a member. How should\
  \ we go about finding a new face while honoring the fallen?</p> \n     <p>Because\
  \ the question relates to party dynamics, which are a kind of found family, I chose\
  \ to do a Crowns (Charisma) harrowing. Laying the cards out, I pulled The Empty\
  \ Throne upright.</p> \n     <p>Upright, The Empty Throne denotes a powerful sense\
  \ of loss – but reminds us that those who are gone never truly leave us. The loss\
  \ of your party member can weigh heavy on you, and you should allow yourself the\
  \ time and space to grieve, but don’t linger overlong. Take what you learned from\
  \ them and use it to build an even stronger relationship with whoever comes next.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Single Card Deck Style</h3> \n     <p>The following two harrowings\
  \ are done in the deck style – all of the cards are shuffled together, and the top\
  \ card of the deck is drawn for each reading. As with the Choosing method, I made\
  \ sure to turn the cards around between shuffling, to ensure that some are reversed.</p>\

  \ of her siblings. They asked: Is there a chance for Viridian and Rin to reconcile,\
  \ move forward, and have a relationship again, or is that a lost cause?</p> \n \
  \    <p>In this reading, I pulled The Tangled Briar in reverse. When drawn in reverse,\
  \ The Tangled Briar indicates a past full of pain – but laced with hope for the\
  \ future. Despite the way the thorns have cut you as you pulled yourself out, there\
  \ is a full garden awaiting you once you fight your way through. There is hope,\
  \ but it will be an uphill battle.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ The Joke signifies overcoming adversity through humor and other non-physical means.\
  \ Taking a moment to relax, laugh, and take it easy will move your goals closer\
  \ than you think. In order to build a home, you have to let yourself relax and let\
  \ those walls down.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b48e924b-60a4-4318-ab2c-a26405fa48c1/HarrowDeck_ThePaladinSpread.jpg\"\

  \ Agency character, Patience Hollyhock (they/them), who enjoys trench coats, coffee,\
  \ and spending time with their partner. Basil asks: What should they do about the\
  \ past they’re running from?</p> \n     <p>For this spread, the Paladin jumped out\
  \ for me. The Paladin upright signifies strength in the face of adversity and encourages\
  \ us to stand up for ourselves. Given the question, this card can be interpreted\
  \ to mean: stop running. Turn your heel and face the horrors behind you. You are\
  \ strong enough.</p> \n     <p>As a card reader of over a decade, the Harrow Deck\
  \ is a wonderful addition to my tool belt, and I had a wonderful time reading fortunes\
  \ for characters. No matter if you’re playing Pathfinder, Starfinder, or any other\
  \ RPG—or if you just enjoy reading cards—the Harrow Deck is a beautiful addition\
  \ to any collection.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
