  \ Party Kill!<br>\n        We have a saying in the Order: We don’t start campaigns,\
  \ we finish them. Yet, no matter how many times we find ourselves at the end of\
  \ an Adventure Path, it still feels nostalgic and we never take it for granted.\
  \ Having played more than 160 published adventures to date, we’re extremely fortunate\
  \ to have seen the bottom of so many dungeons, the end of so many stories, and we\
  \ always make sure to toast when we reach the final encounter. Our headquarters\
  \ in New Jersey has a shelf with champagne bottles that read “Giantslayer,” “Strange\
  \ Aeons,” “Ruins of Azlant,” and more.</p>\n      <p>Our last marathon of Abomination\
  \ Vaults was everything you’d hope from the finale of an Adventure Path. The sheer\
  \ number of hours we clocked dwarfed all previous marathons of this project. We\
  \ hardly slept, played our hardest, and even Golarion’s pantheon took notice. Rovagug\
  \ delivered a 4.7 earthquake that shook our miniatures on the opening day, followed\
  \ by Sarenrae and Tsukiyo providing us a solar eclipse after a 22-hour session to\
  \ close out. Across the last decade of our Pathfinder projects, this marathon will\
  \ always rank among the best, and you just had to be there.</p>\n      <p>Before\
  \ you read the ending, get caught up:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si55?The-Abomination-Arsenal\"\

  ></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Highlights from Marathon 7:</h2>\n  \
  \    <p>□ Let’s start with the adult black dragon that we mentioned in the last\
  \ blog. Never have we laid waste to any dragon in the fashion that we did here.\
  \ Terrain was in its favor but irrelevant: Standing knee-deep in a swampy cavern\
  \ doesn’t matter if your only actions are shoot, reload, shoot. Zoric, our unexpected\
  \ sharpshooter, redefined the Black Arrow for Pathfinder when he landed a critical\
  \ hit with his arquebus for 102 damage. Still, the dragon got a nice breath weapon\
  \ off, along with a couple other attacks. We suppose it did take two rounds to bring\
  \ it down – that’s just being respectful. About as respectful as cueing up “Looking\
  \ Down the Barrel of a Gun” on our soundtrack while we sorted through its treasure.</p>\n\
  \      <p>&nbsp;□ We had to face a horde of Urdefhan to get their <em>Emerald Fulcrum\
  \ Lens</em> and progress deeper into the Vaults. They had already summoned daemons,\
  \ as you can see in the photo. The problem though, was that the author allowed our\
  \ GM to decide if their current summoning ritual was successful or not. Of course\
  \ it was, and Adam had a leukodaemon show up. Still, the bloodsuckers wanted bloodshed,\
  \ and blood is what they got. Ever blow a hole through a transparent creature? It’\
  s pretty cool.</p>\n      <p>□ The bottom level of the Abomination Vaults came complete\
  \ with encounters that drew from all our experiences in the levels above. A month\
  \ before the marathon, our GM gave us an assignment in the campaign’s Google Classroom:\
  \ We had to submit three of our moments of success, along with three of our moments\
  \ of failure throughout the campaign. The Path of Pleasant Memories on level ten\
  \ thus became a fun tour through our favorite moments, remembered with fondness\
  \ and smiles. The Path of Failure, however, was anything but. Adam turned this into\
  \ a GM roast of the players with our lists of shortcomings – embellished further\
  \ to his glee – and we had to take it in stride.</p>\n      <p>□ There are scenes\
  \ in classic westerns where the protagonists get surprised by a circle of enemies\
  \ on a ridge. We entered a room with a surrounding upper gallery that had a bunch\
  \ of slits in the walls. It took us a second to realize the gallery was occupied\
  \ by undead with blowguns, and the slits were for firing lanes – at us. What encounter\
  \ could be more suited to a party of gunslingers than what the author himself described\
  \ as a shooting gallery? Our steely performance here would have made those who had\
  \ to settle for the O.K. Corral jealous. Everyone did their job, concentrated their\
  \ fire on individual specters, and we pulled through with just a few pin pricks.</p>\n\
  \      <p>□ A bunch of glass golems were guarding an old section of Nhimbaloth’\
  s temple on level ten. There was fantastic original art for them, and we guessed\
  \ this might be a serious encounter for some groups. Asking us to shoot out windows\
  \ with our BB guns that bypass physical resistance 10? Come on. This one was over\
  \ so fast, including a competition to see if anyone could top the highest damage\
  \ total in the campaign. Lady Sniper’s 82-damage shot was outdone by a 92-damage\
  \ critical hit with Spellsling from our beast gunner. We couldn’t decide on whether\
  \ Mazatl and his Penetrating Fire double-critical-hit counted.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \      <br>\n      <h3>Character Deaths</h3>\n      <p>□ Deep in the cavern complex\
  \ that comprises dungeon level nine, Belcorra seized another opportunity to ambush\
  \ us. We’ve heard plenty of players over the years say “yeah, <em>phantasmal killer</em>\
  \ is decent I guess, but they have to miss BOTH saving throws.” Vlai, founder of\
  \ the Black Powder Cadre, missed both saves.</p>\n      <h3>The Arsenal</h3>\n \
  \     <p>Our goal with this project was to prove that you didn’t need balance or\
  \ any specific role in a party to be successful in Pathfinder. We’re proud to have\
  \ accomplished that goal. The outcome of the last encounter had nearly everything\
  \ to do with prior decisions our players made on level ten, and very little to do\
  \ with our characters or party composition. We have a lot of data and behind-the-scenes\
  \ material to release in the wrap-up blog to come, which will help tell a larger\
  \ story of how stable the game of Pathfinder 2E truly is – even with a severely\
  \ unbalanced party of gunslingers. For now, we’ll celebrate another successful project\
  \ in the books!</p>\n      <h3>Best Quote from Marathon 7</h3>\n      <p>(a trap\
  \ goes off in a small room, and gas begins to fill the chamber)</p>\n      <p>Adam:\
  \ “There are seven holes in the ceiling, each no larger than the size of a human\
  \ finger.”</p>\n      <p>Theodora: “Okay, we could stick our fingers in the holes?”\
  </p>\n      <p>Jody: “Just don’t use your trigger finger.”</p>\n      <h3>The Final\
  \ Fight</h3>\n      <p>There she was, the ghost queen herself, flying high in one\
  \ of the most impressive chambers we’d come across in this megadungeon. Accompanying\
  \ her were four soul feeders: elite dread wisps we had unknowingly sent to the final\
  \ battle from a previous encounter. Needless to say, we were sweating bullets. So\
  \ much so, that we opened up with a fusillade of vicious anti-aircraft fire. Grundak\
  \ began with his barricade buster, also known around the table as the 20mm cannon.\
  \ Critical hit. The rest of us continued our blaze of glory, and with scrolls of\
  \ <em>ghostly weapon </em>the results were staggering. The queen of the vaults suffered\
  \ so much damage that she had no choice but to return fire with her nastiest spell\
  \ first: <em>phantasmal calamity. </em>Breen, our medic, rolled a natural one and\
  \ went down hard. We exchanged shots while the dread wisps surrounded us and began\
  \ to use their Feed on Despair ability to devastating extent. It’s key to mention\
  \ that we came in with many characters having been drained by an encounter with\
  \ an isqulug, which allowed the wisps to use Feed on Despair from the start. Mazatl,\
  \ Way of the Spellshot, held his breath one last time and zeroed in on his target.\
  \ Critical hit to the incorporeal dome, completely destroying the ghost queen! Dropping\
  \ Belcorra Haruvex in barely three rounds will always have a place in the annals\
  \ of Amber Die history, but it didn’t stop the wisps from adding us to the pile\
  \ of legends too. We weren’t exactly sure what we needed to do with the <em>fulcrum\
  \ lenses</em> we had acquired in the levels above, and now Belcorra was gone. Tess\
  \ Rajani, Way of the Drifter, made a last stand and tried everything she could to\
  \ invest the lenses into what was left of Belcorra’s essence in the room, but to\
  \ no avail. Yet, for everyone at the table who took our radical party of gunslingers\
  \ through hundreds of hours of encounters, this was just a single fight.</p>\n \
  \     <p>Even though Belcorra won – so did we.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
