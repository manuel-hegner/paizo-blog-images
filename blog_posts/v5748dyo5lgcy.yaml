  articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As of this morning, we've\
  \ officially crossed over into August, which means that Gen Con Indy is THIS MONTH.\
  \ Please pardon me while I go curl up in a fetal position in the corner of my office\
  \ and suck my thumb for a bit.</span></p> \n     <p>There, that's much better. As\
  \ we march toward the Big Show, we've still got plenty of figures from November's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set of prepainted fantasy\
  \ miniatures to reveal. Since we've been spending so much time previewing <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/tags/iconics/meetTheIconics\">new iconic characters for the <i>Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</i></a> these last few weeks, I've got iconics on the brain. So it\
  \ seemed like a great time to preview the THREE iconics in this set.</p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-Damiel.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-Damiel_360.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is Damiel, Iconic Alchemist. This wily\
  \ elf enjoys brewing potions, throwing bombs, and morphing his body. WizKids did\
  \ a fantastic job on the sculpt. While you can't quite make out his full backpack\
  \ in this photo, I can assure you that it is just as complicated as the original\
  \ Wayne Reynolds illustration. Lots of clear tubes and bottles on this guy, as well.\
  \ Damiel is a Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-Alhazra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-Alhazra_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Here is our iconic oracle, Alahazra. The image posted above\
  \ is the paint master, so it's missing a lot of the intricate detail work that is\
  \ stamped on during the factory process (this is called a \"tampo\"). Most of the\
  \ really intricate sigils and designs on our figures are tampos, and it's always\
  \ a little difficult to know how the final figure will look from the paint master.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-AlhazraWizKids.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-AlhazraWizKids_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here's an in-production shot of Alahazra's tampo. Notice\
  \ how this version of the figure contains a lot of design elements on the robes\
  \ that the paint master lacks. Given the intricate designs on Alahazra's robes I\
  \ was a bit worried about how this one would turn out, but I think it looks great.\
  \ Alahazra, Iconic Oracle is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-SquealyNord.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140801-SquealyNord_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>And, because YOU demanded it, here's our iconic pig, Squealy\
  \ Nord. Old Nord figures in our \"classic\" (?) Free RPG Day adventures <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8j5w\"><i>We Be Goblins!</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc3\"\
  ><i>We Be Goblins, Too!</i></a>, and makes the perfect addition to the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins Pathfinder Battles Builder Series</a> we released\
  \ last year. Squealy Nord is a Small, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <h2>Minimate Update!</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>I've mentioned on previous Friday Previews that, in addition to four\
  \ goblin promo figures we'll have at Gen Con, we'll also be releasing four Minimate\
  \ 2-Packs featuring Pathfinder characters and monsters. Together, these 12 figures\
  \ serve as an official \"Preview\" of the Pathfinder Iconic Heroes Boxed Set to\
  \ be released in October.</p> \n     <p>This put me in the unique position to build\
  \ the 2-Packs out of whatever creatures I wanted. You'll never guess who I picked\
  \ first!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Minimates-Ostog.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Minimates-Ostog_180.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Minimates-Cairn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Minimates-Cairn_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Here we have the unkillable OSTOG THE UNSLAIN VS. CAIRN WIGHT 2-Pack! Careful\
  \ readers of paizo.com will no doubt recognize Ostog the Unslain as my own personal\
  \ Pathfinder RPG player character, from James Jacobs's in-office Pathfinder campaign.\
  \ Ostog's early stats appeared in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8dhe\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles: NPC Guide</i></a>, and he recently featured in the backstory I wrote\
  \ about his brother, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgac?Meet-the-Iconics-Hakon\"\
  >the iconic skald Hakon</a>. You might think it's corny for me to use my own player\
  \ character as one of the Minimates, and you'd be right. What good is absolute power\
  \ if you don't abuse it once in a while?</p> \n     <p>Facing off against Ostog\
  \ is the Cairn Wight, a nasty undead variant creature from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>. Both Ostog and the Cairn Wight come with swords. The\
  \ Cairn Wight comes with a removable helmet and a shield. If you really want, you\
  \ could give Ostog the Cairn Wight's helmet and give the Cairn Wight Ostog's hair,\
  \ because all Minimates parts are interchangeable. Just don't tell Ostog you got\
  \ the idea from me, ok? We need to remain friends if he's to keep his \"Unslain\"\
  \ title for four more levels until he retires...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Minimates-Lamia.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Minimates-Lamia_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The last set I'll reveal today is the HUMAN RANGER\
  \ VS. LAMIA MATRIARCH. The Human Ranger was an early design prototype our partners\
  \ at Diamond Select Toys put together, and when the time came to put together the\
  \ preview set, I snatched him out of oblivion. Sure, he doesn't have a proper name,\
  \ but he does have a cool hooded cloak, some sweet, sweet stubble, a bow, a quiver,\
  \ and three arrows.</p> \n     <p>The Lamia Matriarch is probably responsible for\
  \ more player character deaths in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\"><i>Rise of\
  \ the Runelords</i></a> campaign than any other creature, so I just had to include\
  \ her here. She comes with two curved swords, bracelets, and an amazing snake body.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'll reveal the next two Minimates 2-Packs in next week's Friday Preview.\
  \ Until then, I leave you with an image of the Godhead to watch over and bless your\
  \ player characters for the rest of the week.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
