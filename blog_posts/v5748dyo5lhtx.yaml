  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As we announced <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lht5\"\
  >last week</a>, <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> has come early this\
  \ year! The Open Call will run until 11:59 PM Pacific time on August 16, 2015. Public\
  \ voting and judging then has until the 31st of August to determine the top 32 items.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>To ensure the bottom ranked items aren't showing up over and over (which\
  \ both annoys champion voters and reduces the useful information we can get about\
  \ how better items compare to each other), we hope to cull the bottom 10-20% of\
  \ vote-getters more often. We may have to adjust the frequency based on how many\
  \ entries we get and for internal scheduling, but the idea is to make sure we're\
  \ constantly filtering out the least popular items. This means voter input is crucial\
  \ at every step, as we refine what items are pitted against one another.</p> \n\
  \    <p>At the end of the Open Call, the top 32 remaining items become our Top 32,\
  \ and the next 4 become out alternates. The remaining items in the top 100 will\
  \ be presented in alphabetical order. Our Open Call judges will work on getting\
  \ feedback up for our Top 32 within a few days of the reveal, since we know contestants\
  \ and watchers alike enjoy seeing their commentary.</p> \n    <p>Before Round 2\
  \ begins we'll outline the full rules for the map round (short form—you'll fill\
  \ in a Flip-Mat-sized grid and have 50 words to give judges and voters an idea what\
  \ your map represents). From Round 2 onward the process will be much as it has been\
  \ previous years, with judges giving feedback and recommendations to voters. We\
  \ have an amazing line up of judges, including winner and longtime community member\
  \ Neil Spicer, who is going to be judging every round this year.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ settle in, get your magic items crafted and your voting buttons limber. It's time\
  \ for another season of <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a>!</p> \n    <p>Owen\
