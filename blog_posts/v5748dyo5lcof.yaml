  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Heroes &amp; Monsters Behind the\
  \ Scenes</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, September 23, 2011</p> \n   <p>So far\
  \ we’ve revealed the digital sculpts for 11 of the prepainted miniatures in our\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles: Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> base set, including the mighty <a\
  \ href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mwc\"\
  >Huge Black Dragon</a>! Digital sculpts give us the chance to see what a miniature\
  \ will look like in full color, and allow us a chance to make minor (or even major)\
  \ adjustments to ensure that the miniatures accurately model the characters and\
  \ creatures that inhabit the Pathfinder world.</p> \n   <p>But digital is not the\
  \ only way to sculpt a miniature, of course. Even though our partners at WizKids\
  \ use the most modern methods to create their beautiful minis, sometimes the best\
  \ way to make a miniature is to sculpt it by hand using precision tools and modeling\
  \ putty. This is the same process by which most metal miniatures come into the world.\
  \ Because the epoxy putty used by most sculptors is usually green, minis lingo refers\
  \ to these preliminary miniature sculpts as “greens,” no matter what color they\
  \ turn out to be.</p> \n   <p>Below you can see the green of the tallest miniature\
  \ in the Heroes &amp; Monsters set, the two-headed Ettin. The pose is an amalgamation\
  \ of a black-and-white ettin image from a Pathfinder’s Journal fiction piece and\
  \ the ettin entry in the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary</i></a>. When WizKids provided this image to Paizo for approval,\
  \ Senior Art Director Sarah Robinson and I thought it captured the creature perfectly,\
  \ and gave the sculpt our stamp of approval almost immediately.</p> \n   <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_EttinSculpt.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_EttinSculpt_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \ </div> \n   <p>Once a sculpt has been approved, WizKids technicians use the green\
  \ to form the basis of the mold from which the entire production run will come.\
  \ At about the same time this is being done, painters must determine what the final\
  \ paint job of the miniature will look like. In the case of digital sculpts, general\
  \ paint guides come with the sculpt itself. In the case of traditional sculpts,\
  \ however, the artists must interpret colors from the original art, and take their\
  \ best shot at how they think the final colors should look.</p> \n   <p>Just this\
  \ week, WizKids sent over the proposed paint deco specs for the Ettin, which looked\
  \ like this:</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_EttinPreview.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_EttinPreview_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Like the sculpt before it, the paint deco sample passed inspection\
  \ with very few changes. We like the way this guy looks. That said, from experience\
  \ with the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8l52\"\
  >Beginner Box Heroes</a> set, WizKids improves the painting with each step, so the\
  \ final miniature will likely look a little more “weathered” than this one, giving\
  \ it a slightly more realistic look.</p> \n   <p>So the Ettin went very smoothly,\
  \ transitioning from art to green to mold to paint deco with virtually no hitches.\
  \ I’m happy to say that this has been the case for most of the miniatures in the\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> set, but a few have been somewhat more stubborn, requiring\
  \ more substantial changes at each step in the process. A good example of this is\
  \ the Human Ranger.</p> \n   <p>When we decided to put the Human Ranger in the set,\
  \ we provided this great illustration by Eric Belisle to WizKids.</p> \n   <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_RangerArt.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_RangerArt_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Their sculptor’s first crack at this miniature captured a lot\
  \ of what we thought was important about the character’s costume and general demeanor,\
  \ but Sarah and I were concerned that the pose was too two-dimensional, and wasn’\
  t as dynamic as Belisle’s original illustration. Our WizKids counterparts agreed,\
  \ and came back with the following major improvement:</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_RangerSculpt.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_RangerSculpt_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>We really liked this approach, and approved\
  \ the sculpt. Now here was a bowman we could see people really wanting to play,\
  \ and the pose really tells a lot about the character. We were excited! But things\
  \ got a lot more exciting earlier this week, when WizKids sent over the following\
  \ paint deco for approval:</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/092311_RangerPreview.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/092311_RangerPreview_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>And that, as they say, was a bulls-eye.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>From here the paint decos will be turned into “masks” that go over the\
  \ unpainted miniatures, allowing paint application to go in all the right places.\
  \ Add some hand-finishing to bring out the tiny details, and the Ettin and Human\
  \ Ranger are on their way to production!</p> \n   <p><b>Next Week:</b> Goblins,\
  \ Goblins, Goblins!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
