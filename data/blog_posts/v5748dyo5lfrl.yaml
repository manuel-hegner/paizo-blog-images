  \ Wendy!</i></span></p> \n     <p>A few years ago, James Sutter asked me if I would\
  \ write a short story for Pathfinder. I'd never played, but the world sounded amazing\
  \ and like a good fit for me, so I dove into Golarion and tried very, very hard\
  \ to come up with a character to have adventures there. I knew I'd have to create\
  \ someone I could both like and really believe in, and I knew it wasn't going to\
  \ be easy. But then Jendara, the hero of the short story <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/tales/serial/motherBears\"\
  >\"Mother Bears\"</a> and my upcoming novel, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy90bk\"\
  ><i>Skinwalkers</i></a>, walked into my bathroom without even knocking.</p> \n \
  \    <p>That's exactly her style. Unlike most of the characters I've written, Jendara\
  \ sprang into my mind fully formed. She just showed up with her handaxe and a belt\
  \ pouch crammed full of the kinds of snacks and survival supplies that every traveling\
  \ mom has to carry, and she perched on the edge of the bath tub (that's where I\
  \ brainstorm, in the bath tub), and said \"I can't be a pirate anymore, but being\
  \ on the right side of the law ain't easy.\" Just like that, I knew that her family\
  \ was gone and her husband had been murdered by another pirate and that this woman\
  \ was going to have a hard time making a new life for herself. She was going to\
  \ need me.</p> \n     <p>I feel very lucky that James believed in Jendara and gave\
  \ me a chance to write her first story, but I feel even luckier that the Pathfinder\
  \ community decided this tattooed, short-fused woman was somebody they liked, too.\
  \ After \"Mother Bears,\" there was a lot of positive feedback on the Paizo forum\
  \ and places like Twitter. People reached out to me to let me know that they thought\
  \ an ex-pirate single mother was pretty great—and that a novel about her would be\
  \ just the kind of adventure they were looking for. It was a tremendous experience,\
  \ and I am utterly thankful to the Pathfinder community for being so supportive\
  \ and welcoming.</p> \n     <p>I loved writing <i>Skinwalkers</i>. There's a lot\
  \ of scary and horrible stuff packed into its covers, but there's a lot of wonder\
  \ and beauty, too. My fingers are crossed that when people see more of Jendara,\
  \ they will continue to enjoy and believe in her.</p> \n     <p>As for me, since\
  \ I wrapped up the novel, I've been enjoying a little time away from my larger-than-life\
  \ creation. I've started playing Pathfinder, although I'm still a rank novice. I\
  \ like it a lot—and my bumbling cleric character is a totally different kind of\
  \ woman from Jendara. She at least knocks before barging into the bathroom.</p>\
