  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <h1>You Asked For It!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ April 20th, 2011</p> \n    <p>One of the questions I get asked most often about\
  \ Pathfinder Tales is: \"When are we going to see some fiction from the Paizo staffers?\"\
  \ While there can be no question that our other Pathfinder Tales authors have done\
  \ a bang-up job so far, many folks are eager to see stories that come directly from\
  \ the source, the products of the same vibrant (and sometimes twisted) imaginations\
  \ that gave the campaign setting life in the first place. </p> \n    <p>It's a curiosity\
  \ we understand quite well—after all, we published <a href=\"/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/search?q=gary+gygax+planet+stories&amp;includeUnrated=true&amp;what=products&amp;f=brand%2FPlanet+Stories&amp;includeUnavailable=true&amp;sort=0\"\
  >four of Gary Gygax's novels</a> for the exact same reason. Yet the sad truth about\
  \ working at a game company is that you don't have nearly as much time to write\
  \ as some of the freelancers you hire. The job is already more than a normal nine-to-five,\
  \ and even those few hours you scrape out to write aren't always yours to write\
  \ what you please. Maybe a freelancer crashes and burns, and suddenly you need to\
  \ come up with half a book. Maybe there's a product on the schedule that only you\
  \ can write, because only you know the subject matter in enough detail (a frequent\
  \ occurrence, when your world is as new as ours). There are a million reasons why\
  \ a staff member might not have the capacity to write fiction.</p> \n   </blockquote>\

  \ knows this better than anyone. Since we launched <a href=\"/pathfindertales\"\
  >Pathfinder Tales</a>, Erik has had a couple of characters knocking around in his\
  \ head, begging to become the heroes of a short story. Yet no matter how often he\
  \ described them to me, or how much loving detail he put into his outline, it seemed\
  \ that something always came up to keep him from writing the story. Maybe there\
  \ was even a touch of stage fright there, too—despite having written or worked on\
  \ enough game books to build a fort in his office, he hadn't written fiction in\
  \ a decade. As the editor of the line, I was confident he could turn over something\
  \ great, but it seemed that one emergency after another kept delaying his story.\
  \ So after about a year of waiting, I did the only thing I could.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ made an emergency.</p> \n    <p>True to form, when Erik heard that there was a\
  \ hole in my web fiction schedule that <i>no one else could possibly fill in time</i>,\
  \ he stepped right up and wrote that story he'd been thinking about for so long.\
  \ The result is \"Two Pieces of Tarnished Silver,\" a new five-part story that begins\
  \ this week, and I couldn't be happier. It's got sword fights. It's got cannibalism.\
  \ It's got a cyclops. It's got a wisecracking swordsman with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Lemmy-style</a> trucker mustache.</p> \n    <p>Most importantly,\
  \ it's got Golarion, in a way only Erik could write. There are dealings with Nex—\
  a nation Erik invented. There's information regarding Durvin Gest—from the only\
  \ person who knows his secret history. There's—well, I don't want to spoil any more.\
  \ But <a href=\"store/byCompany/p/paizoPublishingLLC/pathfinder/tales/serial/v5748dyo5lc3v\"\
  >this is a Pathfinder story from start to finish</a>, and we're proud to have it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, Erik doesn't have time to read this blog post, as he's been\
  \ locked in his usual slew of meetings all day, and probably will be until late\
  \ into the night. But I'm sure that, through the conference room door, he can sense\
  \ our approval.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear:both;\">James Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p>\
