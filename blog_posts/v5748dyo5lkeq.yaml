  \ \n    <p>I wanted to talk a bit about my latest variant Adventure Path for the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, <i>God Callers of Sarkoris</i>. Let me open with\
  \ a confession: I absolutely adore the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, but I didn't\
  \ much care for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set. Although it introduced a lot of interesting new\
  \ mechanics, including cohorts, the mythic rules didn't scale in a way that I liked;\
  \ overall, the set didn't resonate with me. This was a shame because, in playing\
  \ through the game, I was frequently delighted to see items that I'd created for\
  \ the RPG make their way into card form (such as Barding of Pleated Light and Pauper's\
  \ Thighbone).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-BardingOfPleatedLight.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>I wrote the book on that book, is what I'm saying.</p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>I'd created an entire variant adventure path for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> set, called <i>Shield of Rannick</i>, as well as a variant\
  \ adventure path for <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull and Shackles</a>, called <i>Bloodlust Corsairs</i>. My variant adventure\
  \ paths don't require new cards; they just let you use the cards you already own\
  \ in new ways. I initially said I wasn't going to design a variant adventure path\
  \ for Wrath of the Righteous, but my inner game designer just wouldn't let it go.\
  \ It kept nagging at me with questions and insisting on answers.</p> \n    <p>Why\
  \ didn't I like Wrath of the Righteous? Well, I didn't like the mythic components\
  \ (mythic charges and mythic paths). Could the mythic aspects be jettisoned? Far\
  \ fewer than half of the cards use those mechanics... but the basic blessings do,\
  \ as well as many villains, barriers, and late-game armors. So I explored the idea\
  \ of replacing them with something else, and eventually decided to use some neat\
  \ Skull and Shackles cards to fill in those holes.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-IllusoryWall.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-IllusoryWall_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Or <i>appear</i> to fill in those holes.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Now\
  \ I realized I was actually going to design something, so I set to work. For my\
  \ previous variant Adventure Paths, I'd set out all the villains, henchmen, and\
  \ locations and thought, \"What new story do these cards want to tell?\" That's\
  \ pretty hard to do when you know the RPG adventure background (that Fort Rannick\
  \ is a ranger fort overrun with ogres, for example), and I normally have to work\
  \ hard to separate my RPG knowledge from what is plainly written (and illustrated)\
  \ on the cards in front of me. But that wasn't so hard this time, because I'd never\
  \ actually played the RPG version of Wrath of the Righteous. It should therefore\
  \ have been easy to mix them around. Still, I kept coming back to the same story:\
  \ the heroes go into the Worldwound and kill a bunch of demons. I thought that story\
  \ had already been told quite well, and I needed something <i>new</i>.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>I've done a lot of writing for the RPG and I knew quite a bit about the lore\
  \ of the area around the Worldwound: it was once a barbarian nation called Sarkoris.\
  \ To me, Sarkoris had a lot of the feel of the old Conan stories, with barbarian\
  \ kings and witches and decadent cities and the triumph of brawn over beasts. Plus,\
  \ its summoners called pieces of gods to their sides—that was really neat. It hit\
  \ me that I didn't want to set my variant in the Worldwound; I wanted to set it\
  \ <i>before</i> the Worldwound, in the time of Sarkoris.</p> \n    <p>It further\
  \ struck me that I'd need some mechanic to \"power up\" the characters if I took\
  \ mythic paths away, or even the ordinary monsters and barriers would be too tough.\
  \ Rather than a straight numerical increase, I wanted to give some flexibility to\
  \ all the characters; this took the form of additional \"supercharged\" power feats.\
  \ I also wanted to offer some variety, so I gave players a choice of bonus power\
  \ feats. A sudden idea simultaneously solved the power problem and gave my variant\
  \ adventure path its name: I'd let all the characters tap into the deific powers\
  \ of Sarkorian god callers. The cohort rules already showed how summoners worked\
  \ (thanks, Balazar!), so I assigned everyone a cohort that gave them powers to \"\
  level up\" over time. Everyone would be god callers of Sarkoris! The specific abilities\
  \ were revised and refined several times, thanks to a lot of good feedback on the\
  \ forums here.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6820-AlaseCharacterFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6820-AlaseCharacterFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Share the love, god caller Alase.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Let me\
  \ jump on a legal tangent to say that my variant adventure paths are free; they\
  \ have to be, because I produce them under Paizo's <a href=\"/paizo/about/communityuse\"\
  >Community Use Policy</a>. That policy forbids charging for products, but it opens\
  \ up tons of fantastic art for use. The Community Use Policy <i>doesn't</i> let\
  \ you use Paizo's storylines (I couldn't reproduce the plot of one of their RPG\
  \ adventure paths, for example) or most of Paizo's maps.</p> \n    <p>But I really\
  \ wanted a map to show all the neat locations in fallen Sarkoris; this map would\
  \ also show how the characters travel across the land in their adventures. Fortunately,\
  \ I know a talented cartographer named Marco Morte, and he put a map together for\
  \ me at a reasonable rate. To sketch out that map—and, in fact, the whole plot of\
  \ <i>God Callers of Sarkoris</i>—I relied on information about the Worldwound. (I\
  \ later learned that Paizo had already produced a map of Sarkoris, tucked into <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8sa5?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Lost-Kingdoms\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms</em></a>, and my map wasn't too far off the \"\
  official\" one.) You can see Marco's map prominently displayed in <i>God Callers\
  \ of Sarkoris</i>, available from <a href=\"http://www.welbybumpus.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">welbybumpus.com</a>, but here it is for your enjoyment.</p> \n    <div\

  \ href=\"/paizo/about/communityuse\">Paizo Community Use Policy</a>.</i></p>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Give <i>God Callers of Sarkoris</i> a try; I've changed a few\
  \ other things, like how servitor demons work, how recurring villains become nemeses,\
  \ and so forth. It all playtested quite well, and I'd love to hear what you think!</p>\
