  \ <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">The Twelve-Hour Statue</h1>\n            <p>by Michael\
  \ Kortes</p>\n            <p>It was quite certain. Xaven's next step would kill\
  \ him.</p>\n            <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The halfling tomb raider\
  \ had been doing this long enough to know that he was standing on a pressure plate.\
  \ In fact, Xaven had known of his predicament for over eleven hours now, a fact\
  \ carefully measured by the notched candle to his left, now slowly burning down\
  \ to a stump. During that time, he had been left to stand in as near perfect stillness\
  \ as he could manage. A stretch, a sneeze, a momentary lapse of concentration—one\
  \ of these things would eventually kill him. Judging by the fatigue of his aching\
  \ muscles, it would be sooner rather than later. Xaven had had plenty of time to\
  \ contemplate the trap's mechanism. Indeed, he had experimented with a disarmed\
  \ deathplate once before, a year prior. As soon as any portion of his weight came\
  \ off the plate, the ceiling arches would collapse. And judging by the placement\
  \ of those arches, a hundred feet of stone corridor would come down on top of him,\
  \ cascading all the way back to the entrance.</span></p>\n            <p>Xaven blamed\
  \ himself. If he had been a split-second sharper, he wouldn't be standing in the\
  \ exact spot his long-dead killer had anticipated. Admittedly, he noted with twisted\
  \ pride, a split second slower and he would already be dead. Yet that particular\
  \ achievement was soon to be regrettably academic.</p>\n            <p>The issue\
  \ now was what would happen when he finally hit the twelve-hour mark and the candle\
  \ went out, plunging him into darkness. At that point, keeping his center of balance\
  \ would become exponentially harder. The candle had been left by his fellow tomb\
  \ raider, Hrokon—a half-orc who should have been back seven hours ago. The reality\
  \ of the situation was quickly becoming clear: that either Hrokon wasn't coming\
  \ back in time, or he wasn't coming back at all. Technically, it wouldn't really\
  \ matter which was the case, but the former pointed to incompetence, while the later\
  \ was betrayal. Xaven had already decided that if it was a betrayal, he owed the\
  \ half-orc a serious pummeling in the afterlife.</p>\n            <p>And vengeance\
  \ in the afterlife would be his only option for revenge. As a successful tomb robber,\
  \ Xaven had enough gold stashed away to be revived. But with his body buried under\
  \ a thousand tons of rubble, his corpse would never be retrieved. This life, his\
  \ first, was going to be his last on Golarion after all. Perhaps Hrokon was off\
  \ somewhere spending their revival funds right now. The damned half-orc was a lot\
  \ smarter than he like to let on. Admittedly, if their situations were reversed,\
  \ Xaven would also have given desertion some serious thought.</p>\n            <p>In\
  \ any event, Xaven estimated he had less than a half-hour to go before the candle\
  \ burned its last, at which point he would have a decision to make. He could either\
  \ play it out until he inevitably slipped or fainted from exhaustion, or he could\
  \ pick his moment, step off the plate, and welcome the rock shower in the last of\
  \ the dying light. Presently, Xaven was leaning towards controlling his destiny\
  \ and stepping off, but he still hadn't come up with a sufficiently clever line\
  \ for his final words.</p>\n            <p>The fact that an appropriate zinger eluded\
  \ him was, for Xaven, a strong argument that he wasn't meant to let things end just\
  \ yet. The halfling considered whether the ordeal was driving him crazy. Then again,\
  \ debatably Xaven had lost his sanity a long time ago. Anyone who robs the dead,\
  \ fully knowing they leave traps of this nature, couldn't be quite right in the\
  \ head.</p>\n            <p>Yet here he was. Forgotten temples had always been one\
  \ of the halfling's most cherished targets, both for their relics and for their\
  \ inevitable death traps—two items that, until about eleven and a half hours ago,\
  \ had been among Xaven's favorite things.</p>\n            <p>A voice came from\
  \ above: \"Well, the ceiling is still here. Are you down there, little buddy?\"\
  </p>\n            <p>It was Hrokon, calling from above and ahead, near the temple's\
  \ entrance. Xaven stilled himself, fighting the sudden rush of excitement. Every\
  \ movement had to stay under control.</p>\n            <p>The powerful half-orc\
  \ slid down the carved stone ladder from the temple's foyer to the arched corridor\
  \ below. He loped toward Xaven, covering the hall's hundred-foot length with remarkable\
  \ casualness. But then, he knew that Xaven had disabled all the traps in that section.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Of course I'm still here, you idiot! What took you so long?\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"Aroden's nostrils! Your shopping list was long.\"</p>\n \
  \           <p>\"Start by bringing the water! And hurry, I'm losing my light here.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"Coming up.\" Hrokon dug out a tiny folded-paper cup and filled\
  \ it with water from his canteen. He moved slowly now, taking care to avoid coming\
  \ close enough to touch the pressure plate. Xaven had made Hroken draw a wide circle\
  \ around the plate with chalk before he left. \"And I got more candles too.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Good. Light 'em up.\" The halfling slowly accepted the cup and\
  \ brought it to his lips to drink. Sensation began to return, first to his tongue\
  \ and then to his throat. \"We've gotta get you building the sled right away.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"Already done, Xaven. I had a smith put it together for us.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"What? You brought someone in?\" Xaven almost snorted his\
  \ precious water out of his nose. \"What if he starts asking questions?!\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>Hroken made that strange crackling sound that passed for his laugh.\
  \ \"You really want to concern yourself with that kind of detail right now?\" He\
  \ grinned and began lighting candles, waiting for them to heat up so he could drip\
  \ their wax and secure them to the floor.</p>\n            <p>\"No, I guess not,\"\
  \ Xaven admitted after some thought. \"But cut me some slack here. I've been playing\
  \ statue for twelve hours!\"</p>\n            <p>\"Easy, little buddy. We'll get\
  \ you out of here shortly.\" Hrokon cast his gaze up at the ceiling 20 feet above.\
  \ \"Now stay focused. You've come this far, I don't want you bringing the temple\
  \ down on both of us.</p>\n            <p>Xaven steadied himself once more. \"Right.\
  \ Then go get the sled and lay out the rope. Are you sure you understand the layout?\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"Stop worrying about me for once. Just focus on your part.\"\
  \ Hrokon lit the last of the candles. \"I'll be right back.\"</p>\n            <p>Xaven\
  \ concentrated on his breathing while he waited. With four new candles, both his\
  \ world and his outlook were already brighter. Minutes later he could hear Hrokon\
  \ steadily working away, uncoiling a pair of thin but hopefully sturdy ropes. Once\
  \ Hrokon lit a dozen more candles to line the corridor's length, Xaven could see\
  \ the ropes dangling from the top of the ladder at the mouth of the temple foyer\
  \ down to the flagstones of the corridor he was trapped in. From there, Hrokon carefully\
  \ laid rope all the way back to the edge of the chalk line. The half-orc then made\
  \ a further trip topside, returning with his final item, a flat rectangular board\
  \ with four wheels and a handle.</p>\n            <p>As he returned he asked, \"\
  I still don't see why the better plan isn't to just substitute a big rock for your\
  \ weight on the deathplate.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Believe me, I thought about\
  \ it,\" answered Xaven, \"But it won't work—that split second of too much or too\
  \ little weight will set the scale off. It's a crazy risk.\"</p>\n            <p>Hrokon\
  \ rolled his eyes. \"And this plan of yours is much more sane.\"</p>\n         \
  \   <p>Xaven ignored him, squinting his eyes as he appraised the sled. \"Have the\
  \ wheels been oiled like we talked about?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Of course.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Spin 'em. Let me see.\"</p>\n            <p>Hrokon patiently spun\
  \ each wheel for Xaven, one at a time. Xaven had to admit they looked pretty damned\
  \ good—especially for a custom job made in the middle of the night. If this worked,\
  \ Xaven would have to give a sizable tip to Hrokon's smith, and not just to shut\
  \ him up.</p>\n            <p>\"Nice work, Hrokon.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Thanks.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"You know, for a minute or two there, I kinda thought maybe\
  \ you weren't coming back for me. Maybe you just grabbed the altar chest and left.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>Hrokon let loose with his crackle laugh once more. \"Really?\
  \ I'm hurt.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Never crossed your mind?\"</p>\n           \
  \ <p>\"Of course it did, but then I thought to myself: ‘how will I get to see if\
  \ Xaven's idea might actually work?'\"</p>\n            <p>\"So you did think about\
  \ deserting!\"</p>\n            <p>\"Xaven, do you think maybe we can tend to your\
  \ insecurities after we get us out of this deathtrap?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Okay,\
  \ okay. Let's go over the timing once more.\"</p>\n            <p>Hrokon repeated\
  \ the final steps once more for Xaven as he pulled out a pair of manacles from his\
  \ pack. He knew by now that the halfling trusted no one, even at the best of times.\
  \ \"When I hear the ‘ready,' I count to three. On three exactly, I whip the horse\
  \ team and we race as fast as we possibly can. There's a bit of a downward slope\
  \ from the entrance, actually, so we'll get a good start. You ready?\"</p>\n   \
  \         <p>\"I've been ready for twelve hours,\" Xaven said, slowly holding out\
  \ his left arm for the manacle.</p>\n            <p>\"Good,\" said Hrokon, snapping\
  \ one clasp around Xaven's wrist and then the other to the sled's metal handle.\
  \ The key was left in the lock. \"Now don't miss the sled with your jump off the\
  \ plate or you'll lose your arm.\"</p>\n            <p>\"My arm?\" Xaven snorted.\
  \ \"Hrokon, if I miss the sled, the Pathfinders will be digging up my pulverized\
  \ skeleton a hundred years from now.\"</p>\n            <p>The half-orc grinned.\
  \ \"Then don't miss it.\" He paused. \"You've been still an awful long while, Xaven.\
  \ Your muscles won't react quite like they should.\"</p>\n            <p>Xaven grit\
  \ his teeth. \"I won't miss. You just make sure the horses accelerate to a gallop\
  \ right out of the gate. How many did you get?\"</p>\n            <p>\"Eight. I\
  \ already told you, I got everything on the list. They're good ones too—Andoren\
  \ breeds, mostly.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Alright then, let's do this. Head topside\
  \ and call me for the countdown when you're in position.\"</p>\n            <p>And\
  \ then Xaven was alone again. He breathed and sweated in the newly bright corridor.\
  \ That's all he had done for the last twelve hours, but apparently he still had\
  \ more sweat to give. He hadn't told the half-orc how poor the odds were that his\
  \ plan would actually work. If the ceiling came down all at once, it wouldn't matter\
  \ how fast the horses were.</p>\n            <p>But if there was anything Xaven\
  \ knew, it was how trapsmiths worked, and temple engineers always had a flair for\
  \ the dramatic. The ceiling would come down in sections. If he could just stay ahead\
  \ of each chunk, it was possible he could make it to the bottom of the ladder in\
  \ time.</p>\n            <p>The half-orc's shout reverberated down the hall. \"\
  I'm in position. The horses are ready to run!\"</p>\n            <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \             <br>\n              Xaven used to really enjoy working with traps...\n\
  \            </div>\n            <p>Xaven closed his eyes, then slowly opened them\
  \ again. This was it. He sucked in a breath to respond, hoping his throat was up\
  \ to it.</p>\n            <p>\"Ready!\" he called. \"Go!\"</p>\n            <p>At\
  \ first he wasn't sure the half-orc heard him. Then he heard the count.</p>\n  \
  \          <p>Xaven dove for the sled. If he was too early, he was dead. If he missed\
  \ it, he was dead.</p>\n            <p>The sled shot forward as soon as Xaven crashed\
  \ down on its wooden bed. He clawed for the handle with both hands and felt a tear\
  \ in the sockets of his arms.</p>\n            <p>Pulled by the horse team above,\
  \ the ropes connected to the sled had gone taut instantly, and the sled was now\
  \ flying down the corridor. Rather than rolling across the ground as planned, it\
  \ bounced off the flagstones. A half-moment later, Xaven's world became infinitely\
  \ smaller as a cascade of granite blocks suddenly fell from the ceiling in massive\
  \ chunks. The deadfalls exploded right behind him with a shock wave of deafening\
  \ force.</p>\n            <p>Xaven's sled flipped over. The halfling hung on for\
  \ his life. He was still flying forward, the stone floor scraping his back raw as\
  \ he slid. As best he could determine, he was fractionally ahead of the falling\
  \ rock. A split-second later he was enveloped by a cloud of dust, and could see\
  \ nothing.</p>\n            <p>There was a huge crash as the sled smashed into the\
  \ end of the hall, slamming straight into the ladder. At the same instant, the ceiling\
  \ directly above Xaven came loose and began to fall apart above him. Even the walls\
  \ gave way.</p>\n            <p>Still dragged by the unseen horse team, the battered\
  \ sled shot upward toward the hole in the ceiling. The sudden torque wrenched Xaven's\
  \ hands free from the handle, but the heavy manacles dragged him behind the sled\
  \ like a rag doll. He flew up the shaft through a hail of falling rock.</p>\n  \
  \          <p>Once the sled reached the now-disintegrating foyer, it changed direction\
  \ for the second time, this time shooting out the temple entrance. With his right\
  \ hand, Xaven flailed at his shackled wrist, catching the key in its lock long enough\
  \ to turn it and release himself from the sled. He was vaguely aware that his left\
  \ shoulder had dislocated and his muscle had torn. Worse, now free from the flying\
  \ sled, Xaven came crashing down on the temple's outer steps, breaking what felt\
  \ like every remaining bone in his body. Behind him, a geyser of dust exploded outward\
  \ as the temple entrance collapsed into rubble. The dust enveloped him once more,\
  \ filling his lungs and sending him into a fit of spasmodic coughing.</p>\n    \
  \        <p>Somehow, Xaven didn't seem to mind. His inability to breathe was a testament\
  \ to the fact that his lungs had not been crushed in the rockfall. He would hurt—\
  for a very long time—but he would live. His coughs were part laughter.</p>\n   \
  \         <p>Hrokon arrived a few minutes later, racing up the hill on foot.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"You alive, little buddy?\"</p>\n            <p>Xaven's head was\
  \ the only thing he could manage to turn toward the half-orc. \"Where are the horses?\"\
  </p>\n            <p>\"I'd say lost forever. Once we got a good clip, I jumped off\
  \ of the wagon and let 'em go—didn't want my weight to slow it down.\"</p>\n   \
  \         <p>Xaven smiled. \"You jumped off a wagon pulled by galloping horses going\
  \ down a hill? Not bad.\"</p>\n            <p>There was an awkward silence as Hrokon\
  \ dug through his pack for his healer's kit. He wasn't much of a doctor. \"You know,\
  \ Xaven, one of these days you'll decide you can trust me.\"</p>\n            <p>Xaven\
  \ lay on his back, looking up at the rising sun while his pain washed over him.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Hrokon had a point. If not for the big half-orc, Xaven would be\
  \ dead. Since he wasn't, perhaps this was a fine time to start reevaluating some\
  \ things. Sensing awkwardness, Hrokon changed the subject. He rummaged through his\
  \ kit, producing the emergency potion. \"Here, drink this. It should get you well\
  \ enough for us to get back to Yanmass and find a decent healer. We just made a\
  \ lot of noise—could be there's somebody around to hear it, in which case we'll\
  \ want to be well away by the time they arrive. Tell me where you stashed that chest\
  \ from that altar in the first room, and I'll get it loaded up. You work on getting\
  \ that mud out of your lungs.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Right.\" Xaven coughed, suddenly\
  \ appreciating that their job was still far from over. \"I hid it for us just over\
  \ there before we went back inside.\" He motioned to a copse of pine and eucalyptus\
  \ further down the slope, away from the shattered temple. \"Under the blackened\
  \ boulder.\"</p>\n            <p>\"Good.\" Hrokon clapped Xaven on the shoulder\
  \ and headed off to collect the spoils, leaving his kit with the halfling. Xaven,\
  \ for his part, lay still, slowly flexing fingers and toes as the potion gradually\
  \ brought feeling back to the numb and buzzing digits. He closed his eyes.</p>\n\
  \            <p>He was going to be okay. More than okay, in fact—he was going to\
  \ be rich. From behind the trees, he could hear Hrokon loading the altar chest onto\
  \ a horse. It was forward thinking on the half-orc's part to have brought an extra\
  \ steed beyond the team Xaven requested. The half-orc really was smarter than anyone\
  \ gave him credit for—including Xaven. He would make a worthy partner. And maybe,\
  \ in time, a friend.</p>\n            <p>Xaven heard hoofbeats and rolled onto his\
  \ side. Farther down the slope, Hrokon was riding away at full gallop, the altar\
  \ chest strapped securely behind him on the saddle.</p>\n            <p>Xaven gave\
  \ a choking laugh. \"Smarter than anyone gave him credit for,\" indeed. Xaven had\
  \ clearly taught the half-orc better than he'd thought. Yet thanks to Hrokon, Xaven\
  \ was still alive. He'd even left the halfling his kit, which looked to have just\
  \ enough food and water for him to make it back to civilization. Perhaps, all things\
  \ considered, it was a fair trade.</p>\n            <p>Xaven lay his head back,\
  \ closed his eyes, and listened to the retreating sounds of his partner.</p>\n \
