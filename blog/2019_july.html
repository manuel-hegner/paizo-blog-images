                <p itemprop="description">Pregenerated characters. Those iconic heroes who often serve as the first introduction for people to play Pathfinder. They’re here. Or at least, the first batch of them. The level 1 versions of Amiri, Ezren, Fumbus, Harsk, Kyra, Lem, Lini, Merisiel, Sajan, Seoni, and Valeros, along with the level 5 versions of Amiri, Ezren, Fumbus, Kyra, Merisiel, and Valeros.</p>
                <p>Why only 6 level 5s and no other levels, you might ask? It’s because pregens are cursed. I’m telling you, disappearing documents, spreadsheets randomly overwriting themselves, John forgetting that he’d put “Prettiest Kitty” as a placeholder for Droogami’s background until it showed up on his desk for final approvals (who were we to question John’s knowledge and experience?). The process definitely seemed like a comedy of errors at times, yet it also included many invaluable collaboration and review steps that resulted in 18 exceptional characters.</p>
                <p>But they’re <b><a href = "https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">here</a></b>, and they’re ready to throw down PF2 style! The 5th-level iconics are also going to be taking on Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Origins of the Open Road, premiering at GenCon. And if you’re not going to be playing 1-00, or if you want to spend a little time at 1st level and get used to the new rules, we’ve got a repeatable quest and scenarios galore to try out all the iconic characters.</p>
                <p>How did Sajan get Tiger Style, a ki power, <i>and</i> proficiency with his temple sword at 1st level you might ask? Let’s just say it’s humanly possible. Why does Fumbus get more adorable every time you pick up his character sheet? I don’t have an answer for that. But I <i>can</i> tell you that Valeros has traded out his Sudden Charge feat from the playtest and has rediscovered his two-weapon fighting skills, now blending shield boss and longsword for all your bashing and slashing needs!</p>

	<blockquote>
        <p itemprop="description">They were talking about the dragon.</p>
        <p>Uguro flattened himself against the rocky outcropping and bellied closer, using his elbows to scoot along the rough ground. The rocks bit into his bruises, but he pushed back the pain and kept quiet.</p>
        <p>“— but there are no dragons in Taldor! There haven’t been for centuries! Why, the Dragon Plague was well over two thousand years ago, and since then our glorious dragonslayers —” The voice was older, male, full of affronted privilege. A noble, Uguro decided, and one unaccustomed to taking bad news.</p>
        <p>The other speaker was determined to make him swallow it. This voice was female, younger, and glossed with a foreign accent that did nothing to disguise its sharp exasperation. “Eovras, when did the Dragon Plague end?”</p>
        <p>“3672 Absalom Reckoning, my lady.” That was a new speaker. Younger still, and male.</p>
        <p>Uguro eased forward, daring to poke his head around the nearest outcropping. Now he could see them. All three wore armor, but they could hardly have looked more different.</p>
        <p>The gray-haired noble had been squeezed into a gilded suit of ornate, old-fashioned plate that had obviously been made for someone broader in the shoulder and trimmer at the waist. He faced off against a brown-haired woman in battered but well-maintained plate and a clean-cut younger man who appeared to be an… apprentice knight. Squire?</p>
        <p>The woman shook her head. “It appears the good baron’s recollection was off by a bit. Would you consider the events of ‘well over two thousand years ago’ sufficient to deter a dragon from trespassing into the barony within the past few days?”</p>
        <p>The young knight—Eovras—bowed his head. “I could not say, my lady.”</p>
        <p>“I can.” Uguro’s interjection startled even himself. He flinched, almost losing his grip on the outcropping, as their eyes flew up to him. The apprentice knight and the baron startled visibly. Only the woman seemed unsurprised. Had she known he was there?</p>
        <p>Swallowing, Uguro climbed down the steep rock and stood before them. He straightened his tunic uselessly, all too aware that the rough cloth was scorched and full of holes, and that he himself was a barefoot, grubby miner’s cast-off. But he had to tell them.</p>
        <p>“It was a dragon. My lords. My lady. It was—it was a dragon.” Suddenly Uguro’s eyes were full of tears, hot and glassy. His chest ached, and it was as hard to breathe as it had been when the dragon had raked the stony earth with fire, sucking all the air from his lungs. It was as if speaking the beast’s name had brought those terrible moments back.</p>
        <p>“It was a dragon,” he managed to say again, and then he broke into shuddering sobs. He couldn’t stop them. He was thirteen.</p>
        <p>“Show us,” said the woman.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Streaks of fire had plumed across the miner’s camp, driving down with such fury that the hard earth was furrowed at the center of each blast. Gravel-pocked glass cracked under Uguro’s steps as he led the woman and her companions into the ruins. They’d given him boots to protect his bare feet, but he could still feel the echoes of fire through the thin-worn soles.</p>
        <p>The ferocious heat had cracked rocks and melted iron tools into rippled puddles, but it had passed so quickly that the camp garden’s turnips, sheathed by damp soil, were perfectly sound under their crisped black tops. The woman, Cirra, pulled one up to examine it, then carefully replanted it. As if someone might someday want to harvest that turnip, and she wouldn’t be responsible for its waste.</p>
        <p>Such strange people. Caring for turnips, when…</p>
        <p>“They died here.” Uguro pointed, unnecessarily. The dining hall, once the camp’s largest building, was a smoking ruin. Outside its blackened doorframe, the miners’ boots were still lined up in a neat, untouched row. The dragon had made them take off their shoes before it had herded them inside. Its idea of a joke, demanding that the miners show proper respect to a graveyard.</p>
        <p>A detritus of personal letters and charred keepsakes fluttered around the boots like fallen leaves. The dragon had taken those, too. Had read the letters aloud, one by one, mocking the misspellings and the triteness of the sentiments before it torched mementoes and owners alike. Uguro had watched from afar, hidden, struck breathless by the creature’s cruelty as much as by its grandeur.</p>
        <p>He didn’t tell the strangers this. But he saw the woman stoop to pick up a letter, and saw her mouth harden as she studied it, and he knew that she knew what the dragon had done.</p>
        <p>She folded the letter up and tucked it respectfully into an empty boot.</p>
        <p>Such strange people.</p>
        <p>“What do you think?” Eovras asked the woman.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” Cirra admitted. “The intensity of the firestrikes, the size of the claw prints… I’m not saying this is Daralathyxl’s work, but —”</p>
        <p>Eovras’s eyes widened. “You really think —”</p>
        <p>“No, but only because I don’t think the Sixth King of the Mountains would bother with a mining camp in some Taldan backwater.” Cirra caught Uguro looking at them and shrugged apologetically. “No insult meant.”</p>
        <p>Uguro couldn’t imagine why he should be insulted. The mining camp was a backwater. And he didn’t understand the attack either. “Why would a dragon come to us?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t —” Cirra began, but a cry from the baron’s tents interrupted her answer.</p>
        <p>“Dragon!”</p>
        <p>A moment later, it came again, carried by new voices. Then the screams became higher and more frantic, and then they were eclipsed by the sound of Uguro’s nightmares.</p>
        <p>First the vast, crackling hiss of the exhalation, then the hollow, unreal roar of the flames igniting with such fury that the air itself seemed to writhe and burn, and then —</p>
        <p>— then everything else. The screams of horses and knights afire, the desperate shouts of surviving commanders trying to restore order, the chorus of smaller fires spun off by the initial conflagration.</p>
        <p>Leaving the others behind, Cirra ran toward the noise. The baron and the apprentice knight hurried after her, and after a frantic, frozen hesitation, Uguro ran after them too. The only thing he feared more than the dragon was the idea of facing it alone.</p>

        <div class="blurbCenter">
            <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Shining%20Kingdoms.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190731-sklarge.jpg" alt="A massive red dragon spreads its wings as it unleashes fiery breath on a battlefield of mounted knights." /></a>
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski</p>
        </div>

        <p>Fire, smoke, and confusion had seized the baron’s outriders. The lingering panic of the dragon’s presence poisoned the air. It prickled the small hairs along Uguro’s neck and stung his nose like acrid smoke.</p>
        <p>Then he felt a lurching surge of terror and knew even before he looked up that the dragon was wheeling around again.</p>
        <p>It was immense. Redder than rubies, redder than blood, and then abruptly black as its wings swallowed the sun. The sight turned Uguro’s bowels to water. He didn’t understand how the knights could spur themselves toward it, but somehow they did.</p>
        <p>Cirra had found a horse somewhere. She was waving a sword and shouting something, but Uguro couldn’t make out the words. Then he saw the dragon dive toward her, its jaws unhinged to loose another blast of doom.</p>
        <p>Rocks took the flames. Somehow Cirra had dodged behind an outcropping. And now Uguro saw what she’d done, distracting the beast so that the cooks and cobblers and other camp civilians could take cover. They’d been directly in the dragon’s original path and would surely have gone up in flame if she hadn’t drawn it away.</p>
        <p>Cirra came out from around the rock, calling another challenge, but this time the dragon didn’t take her bait. The baron had come charging at the beast, his retinue behind him, and the dragon turned to meet them instead.</p>
        <p>For a moment, the baron was resplendent in his bravery. Sunlight sparked off his ornate gilt armor. The knights’ thundering charge looked like a storybook illustration, all plumes and banners and white horses.</p>
        <p>Then the dragon exhaled.</p>
        <p>The baron’s breastplate, glowing with magic, withstood the inferno. Nothing else did. The knights’ armor melted like candlewax. Their horses screamed. Their plumes and banners disappeared into ashes, and chaos swallowed their line. And what fell from the baron’s smoking breastplate, headless and legless, was grisly indeed.</p>
        <p>Lazily the dragon snaked through the rubble and plucked the baron’s breastplate from the ground. Snarling its triumph to the smoke-stained sky, it slit the leather straps with a twist, as if it were shucking an oyster. Then it held the broken armor high over its mouth, opened its jaws wide, and swallowed the half-cooked morsel with a loud snap of relish.</p>
        <p>Hidden behind a rock, Uguro doubled over, his eyes wide in horror and the heavy wash of dragonfear. He clapped his hands over his mouth, trying not to retch. It was a losing battle.</p>
        <p>Then reassurance flowed through him, strong and certain, easing his terror. Cirra’s hand was on his shoulder. She motioned for him to stay down as she crouched beside him, watching the dragon feast on its kills.</p>
        <p>“What—why,” Uguro stammered. “Why did this happen?”</p>
        <p>Cirra answered in a rough whisper. Her eyes were still tracking the dragon. “I don’t know. That isn’t Daralathyxl. It’s big enough, but… it doesn’t have the scars. That isn’t any great red I know.”</p>
        <p>“What will you do now?”</p>
        <p>“We will retreat. Our first duty is to lead the survivors to safety. Then we’ll find out who this dragon is, and why it came. When we’re properly prepared, and armed with more than just courage, we’ll act.”</p>
        <p>“You will?” The idea of standing against that thing…</p>
        <p>“We will.” Cirra glanced at him with a hint of a smile, despite their circumstances. “If you want. If you’re ready. But for now, our duty is to the survivors. So we’ll go. Quietly. Carefully. You know the trails here, don’t you? Help us find our way out.”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” Uguro nodded. His throat was still dry, but he was glad to help. It made him feel braver. Brave enough to imagine doing more, someday. “Yes. This way.” He swallowed. “For now.”</p>

	<h2>The Paizo Booth</h2>

We’re at Booth #103 all weekend long, with piles and piles of Pathfinder Second Edition releases just waiting for your upcoming adventures. At the booth you’ll find walk-up demos, Paizo staffers eager to answer questions or help you find exactly what you’re looking for, and factory-fresh copies of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0k?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0m?Pathfinder-Bestiary"><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znq?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-145-Hellknight-Hill"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #145: Hellknight Hill</i></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoh?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone"><i>Pathfinder Adventures: Fall of Plaguestone</i></a>, a raft of new accessories, and a host of other Pathfinder Second Edition releases from Paizo and our licensed partners.

	<h2>Organized Play</h2>
	<p>Paizo takes over the entire Sagamore Ballroom for Gen Con, with non-stop gaming in a huge hall covered with awesome banners featuring our iconic characters! Here, on the second floor of the Indianapolis Convention Center, you’ll find thousands of gamers playing Pathfinder Society, Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Society scenarios all weekend long, 24 hours a day! Stop by and see what you’ve been missing—or jump into a game yourself! </p>
	<p>Each of Paizo’s three organized play campaigns has its own collectible pin available for free in the Sagamore Ballroom. Stop by and ask how to get yours at Organized Play HQ, on the raised platforms against the back wall.</p>
	<p>We’ll also have a satellite Paizo store just outside the Sagamore Ballroom, at the top of the escalators where the Crossroads and Sagamore concourses meet. The satellite store will carry a limited selection of Paizo products, focusing on new Pathfinder Second Edition releases to help Pathfinder Society players grab their books quickly and conveniently without having to spend a game slot standing in line in the Exhibit Hall. Note that the satellite store accepts credit card transactions and subscription pick-ups only.</p>

<p>
Er, we’ll get back to those tall knives in a bit. Let’s start with those elves though, shall we? Kyonin, on the southeastern corner of Lake Encarthan in central Avistan, is one of the oldest nations in the Age of Lost Omens setting, predating even Earthfall over 10 millennia ago. But the elves of yore foresaw the disaster and fled through the mysterious <em>Sovyrian Stone</em> to a distant, alien refuge. When they returned to Golarion centuries later, they found their homeland overrun by the nacent demon lord, Treerazer, whom they still battle today. Among the many ancient tools at the elves’ disposal is a vast network of magical gates, called <em>aiudara</em>, that link Kyonin to elven populations in distant corners of the world, including in the Mwangi Expanse, the Crown of the World, and beyond.


 <div class="blurbCenter">

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Fabio Gorla</p></div>

<p>Right next door we have the Five Kings Mountains, homeland of the dwarves. Upon arriving on Golarion’s surface at the end of their generations-long Quest for Sky millennia ago, this mountainous region was one of the first they populated. Since their founding, the five kingdoms that give the dwarven stronghold its name have waxed and waned in power, and internal conflict (including a recent turn toward the worship of Droskar) have led to a decline in the land. But after breaking free from Droskar’s influence, more traditional dwarven culture has been on the rise, and the worship of Torag and his kin are resurgent in the region. A people bound by tradition, the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains have unearthed ancient ways as a result of this embrace of their history, including the resurgence of the shamanistic Rivethun throughout Avistan.</p>

</div>

<p>To the west of the Five Kings Mountains lies the mercantile nation of Druma (most recently explored in the final First Edition Pathfinder Campaign Setting book, <em>Druma, Profit and Prophecy</em>). The influential Prophecies of Kalistrade permeate almost every aspect of Drumish society, most notably the pursuit of wealth and opulence. The Kalistocrats (as adherents to the strict code of conduct associated with the prophecies are called) are among the canniest merchants, investors, and speculators in the Age of Lost Omens setting, and their reach extends into markets across the world.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Katerina Kirillova</p></div>


<p>To Druma’s south lies Andoran, the first true democracy in Avistan and Garund. Formerly part of Taldor, and then Cheliax, Andoran gained its independence in the People’s Revolt in the wake of the rise of House Thrune. Now free from the outdated constraints of nobility and monarchy, the fate of all Andorens is theirs to grasp. Andoran spreads its ideology of freedom and liberty to distant lands via its well trained and expertly equipped Eagle Knights, whose three branches—the infantry of the Golden Legion, the knights of the Steel Falcons (and their naval counterparts, the Gray Corsairs), and the secret agents of the Twilight Talons—work in tandem to oppose oppression, especially slavery, throughout the Inner Sea region. Members of this organization may find the magical epaulets presented in the chapter a nice addition to their character loadouts.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190730-eagleknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190730-eagleknight_500.jpeg" alt="Eagle knight in a light blue jacket with gold epaulets, white pants, and knee-high black boots with a gold chain attached to the top. The right hand wields a long, engraved broad sword. " width="300"s/></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Klaher Baklaher</p></div>

<p>Andoran isn’t the only nation to attempt to wrest itself free from the tyranny of nobility, though it remains the only one to do so peacefully. In neighboring Galt, a bloody revolution has gripped the nation for half a century as its people attempt to form a new government in the wake of political upheaval. Under the watchful eyes of the Gray Gardeners, who enforce the laws of the Revolutionary Council with their soul-trapping <em>final blade</em>, the people of Galt strive to establish their own nation free from bloodshed and oppression, though many feel that they simply traded the rule of an autocratic aristocracy for the domination of an autocratic Revolutionary Council. And yes, there are stats for a final blade included. What could go wrong?</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190730-finalblade.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190730-finalblade_500.jpeg" alt="Final blade, which looks similar to a fancy guillotine. A fully armored person stands next it, holding a long metal rod."  width="300"/></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Andrea Tentori Montalto</p></div>

<p>Last but far from least, is the nation of Taldor, among the first new nations on the Inner Sea to rise from the devastation of Earthfall. Over the millennia, Taldor expanded to include nearly all of Avistan, and most of the human nations from Cheliax to Brevoy have roots as former Taldan vassals. But Taldor has fallen far from these great heights, and centuries of ineffectual bureaucratic rule, hedonistic waste by the upper classes, and general bad luck have seen its territory shrink to a fraction of its former glory. Still, the people of Taldor are proud and resilient, and their culture is ascendant under the new rule of Grand Princess Eutropia, who took the throne just last year. A progressive empress open to new ways of governing, whose ambitions are tempered with moderation and a dedication to improving the lives of her people, Eutropia nevertheless has her political enemies who are either bitter at their defeat during the recent war for the crown or who see her new approach to rulership a threat to their wealth, prestige, or both. What trials may await the people of Taldor as they attempt to reclaim their proper place as most influential and best respected nation in the world?</p>

<p>For players, this section of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0o?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide"><em>Lost Omens World Guide</em></a> presents the aforementioned <em>Golden Legion epaulets</em> and <em>final blade</em> (okay, so that one might be more for GMs), but also seven new backgrounds tied to the region, including final blade survivor, Kalistrade follower, and Rivethun adherent, as well as the Lion Blade archetype, which puts your character in the role of a secret agent of the Taldan throne who uses deception and disguise to your advantage.</p>

While these two hefty tomes are absolutely essential for your table, there is one critical thing that they lack: adventure! After all, what is a roleplaying game without a fun, exciting story to experience?</p>
			<p>Fortunately, we have a number of amazing adventures releasing the same day as the <i>Core Rulebook</i>! So, if you want to jump right into the game, there are a variety of tales waiting to be told. (No need to worry about spoilers in this blog, we are only giving you the basics)</p>

			<h2>The Fall of Plaguestone</h2>
			<p>Designed for 1st-level characters, <i>The Fall of Plaguestone</i> is a standalone 64-page adventure that is designed to tell the story of how a group of strangers became companions. Think of it like the origin story for your group.</p>
			<p>The story opens in the back of a merchant’s wagon caravan heading from Elidir—the capital of Isger—toward Andoran, through the valley between the Aspodell and Five Kings mountain ranges. Stopping at small villages and towns along the way, caravan master Bort Bargith is happy to take on travelers, so long as they don’t mind stopping for him to do his business along the way. His next stop is the town of Etran’s Folly, known to some as the town of Plaguestone.</p>
			<p><i>The Fall of Plaguestone</i> should take around 40 hours of gameplay to complete (depending on the group) and by the end, your characters should be around 4th level, ready to take on even greater adventures!</p>
		
			<h2 style="clear:both">Age of Ashes Adventure Path</h2>
			<p>Age of Ashes is our first Adventure Path for Pathfinder Second Edition, and I wanted to ensure that the storyline was suitably epic, gave players a good look at numerous locations in the Age of Lost Omens, and played to the strengths of the new rules—all while giving players a host of memorable villains and allies to meet, fight, and befriend.</p>
			<p><i>Hellknight Hill</i> starts in the nation of Isger, a region we’ve not had the opportunity to do much with in previous Adventure Paths. In doing so, we’ve got a mix of old lore (focusing on the abandoned Hellknight Order of the Nail fortress, Citadel Altaerein, as the adventure’s primary site), and brand-new lore (with the introduction of this campaign’s “home town” of Breachill). During the course of Age of Ashes, the PCs will travel to several other sites across the continents of Avistan and Garund, but Breachill and Citadel Altaerein are very much intended to feel like home. If you’re planning on running Age of Ashes for your group, you’ll want to become familiar with the town of Breachill, detailed in this volume, and be ready to present the town’s inhabitants as needed. Each volume of Age of Ashes will give additional information about key citizens from the town on the inside back covers, but you should feel free to expand the stories of those locals whom your players take a shine to as you see fit!</p>

				<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Leonardo Borazio</p>
			</div> 
		
			<p>Citadel Altaerein itself is, in a way, one such character—for once the PCs manage to deal with the monsters and dangers that occupy its halls, they might just earn the right to claim the castle as their home! There’s far more going on in Age of Ashes than castle management and hobnobbing with the locals, but as the campaign grows more and more epic in scope, it’s important that your players retain the feeling that Breachill is a safe haven—a place they can go to relax, rest, and recover after their adventures. A place they can truly call home!</p>
			<p>Age of Ashes is a six-part campaign designed to take a party of player characters from 1st to 20th level, and can provide months or even years of gameplay depending on the pace and frequency of your particular group. Each month we’ll release a new volume of the Adventure Path, which you can get through our ongoing Pathfinder Adventure Path subscription. You can also use <i>Hellknight Hill</i> as a standalone adventure with the potential to grow into a larger campaign, so don’t hesitate to pick it up on Thursday to start your Pathfinder Second Edition adventures with a bang!</p>

<p>The cards were going mad.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Irhina felt their agitation thrumming through her tiny sea cabin. It was a sharp, jangled vibration, like a dozen out-of-tune instruments all bleating different songs. Something was coming, some great weight that sat on destiny’s weaving and bent all the skeins of fate toward itself.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Shivering, Irhina went to the porthole. All was dark through the bleary glass, save for the rough shapes of heaving waves barely illumined by a cloudy and uncertain moon. Distant lightning flashed through the heavy-bellied clouds. The storm was nearly upon them.
 </p>
 
 <p>
The Sea Falcon bucked and dipped as another wave slammed into it. Irhina's Harrow deck tumbled from the table. Nine cards spilled across the cabin's well-worn rug.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Irhina's skin prickled. There were no accidents in a Harrow deck. No coincidences, no mistakes. Only amateurs could indulge such comfortable fantasies, and it had been many, many years since Irhina had believed them.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Not since she'd been claimed by this very deck, in fact.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Irhina shivered again. That had been a bad night. Fire, screams, confusion. The Harrow deck's folded-paper box, sodden with her uncle's warm blood, crumbling and spilling the lacquered cards into her hands. The stinging thrill of magic against her skin, unwanted but impossible to refuse.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Then—a heavy duty, and a hard life. Years of loneliness with little laughter. Those memories would swallow her easily, if she let them.
 </p>
 
 <p>
She didn't. Here and now, she had a storm to survive.
 </p>
 
 <p>
The cards had spilled into a rough square on the cabin floor. In a traditional reading, they would have been dealt into three neat rows of three: past, present, and future, with the pattern centered on a role card. Tonight, however, they'd formed a different pattern on the shabby red rug. The cards had fallen into a sequence of three by three, but the rows were interleaved, with no clean breaks between past, present, or future. Some of the cards were not only reversed, but thrown sideways, one image interrupting or obscuring another.
 </p>
 
 <p>
The Midwife. The Big Sky. The Brass Dwarf askew: invulnerability under threat. The Carnival and The Demon's Lantern bridged by The Tangled Briar: trickery and illusion on one side, malicious deception on another, and a bloody history that gripped them together—but whether that meant their shared history was the key to unlocking their deceit, or merely signified that some great lie had continued unbroken for ages, was impossible for Irhina to read.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Ordinarily, a role card would have guided her through the conflicting interpretations. The role card, like a story's protagonist, created clarity from a jumble of conflicting elements by providing perspective and narrative structure. Even in a spontaneous reading, there should have been a role card set out to anchor the other symbols in its orbit.
 </p>
 
 <p>
But here there was none. No central figure, no guide toward meaning. Irhina's fingers danced lightly over the cards, signaling her question. The vibration she received in response was unmistakable: the deck did not hold that answer.
 </p>
 
 <p>
There was only the chaos of future-past-present, all knotted together and writhing senselessly. She could as easily have tried to read the future from a bed of snakes.
 </p>
 
 <p>
She swept the Harrow cards back into their box, ignoring the protest that prickled across her palms, and left her cramped cabin. Storm or no storm, she needed air.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Above decks, the storm hadn't broken. A strange yellow pall suffused the clouds' dark bellies, shocking erratically brighter as lightning spidered across the sky. The great golden dome of Crystilan glittered in the distance, reflecting the same eerie stormlight from its perch above the coast's wave-lashed cliffs.
 </p>
 
 <p>
No, Irhina realized. Crystilan wasn't reflecting the light. It was the source of that eerie, dazzling glow. And the glow was intensifying, moment by moment, spilling ribbons of yellow light across the sea and tinting the waves' white froth toward saffron. Luminous ripples raced across the dome's immense interior, fracturing into runic shapes that strained to create whirling diagrams before they shattered apart.
 </p>
 
<div class="blurbCenter">
<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190725-fiction.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190725-fiction_500.jpeg" alt="A city surrounded by a cracking, crumbling crystal wall. Pieces tumble into the ocean and crash into the rocks. The sky is stormy. In the foreground, a sailing ship full of people looks on in horror." /></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Federico Musetti</p></div>
 
 <p>
She wasn't the only one mesmerized by the sight. Other passengers had come up to watch it with her: a Tian woman, a Keleshite man, an Ustalavic nobleman in a fine cuffed shirt whose shaggy, bestial features made her wonder if his line was cursed with lycanthropy. It wouldn't have surprised her. The Sea Falcon charged exorbitant rates, but it carried anyone who could afford them, and it ran swiftly to destinations that other ships avoided.
 </p>
 
 <p>
She wondered if one of those passengers had paid for the Sea Falcon to pass this close to Crystilan. The Thassilonian ruin had mystified scholars for millennia. Within the great crystal dome, an entire empty city stood perfectly preserved, untouched by time and impossible to reach. Most assumed that the city and its people had fallen victim to some ancient archmage's curse, and superstitious sailors tended to swing wide around it, afraid of being snared.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Irhina had always thought that a foolish fancy, but now she wasn't so sure. The city under crystal had always been eerie, but now it felt different, aware and more intensely menacing, in a way she'd never sensed before. It was as if some power within the dome was awakening, and was beginning to look upon its surroundings with envious and hungry eyes. A malevolent power, she was sure, though she couldn't say why.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Beneath the Sea Falcon, the sea was lit up from within, so that it seemed they sailed on a lake of molten gold. Lightning flashed from cloud to cloud, faster with each stroke, always strangely soundless—
 </p>
 
 <p>
—until a stroke of thunder cracked overhead with such ferocity that Irhina quailed.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Another sounded, and another, and Irhina realized that it wasn't thunder at all. Crystilan itself was breaking. Massive fissures cracked the gleaming dome. Shivering slabs of crystal tumbled into the sea, throwing up geysers of saltwater and splintered stone that shook the Sea Falcon from afar.
 </p>
 
 <p>
And inside the long-vacant city beneath Crystilan, Irhina could see the tiny, impossible figures of… of people. Some were human-sized, tiny at this distance. Others towered above them, so huge that they must surely be giants. She could make out no details of language or dress, but the sight of them filled her with unreasoning fear.
 </p>
 
 <p>
“What is it?” the maybe-werewolf nobleman muttered beside her. His thick dark nails dug into the railing's salt-spattered wood. He looked half a monster, but in that moment Irhina felt a sudden sense of solidarity with him. If he was a monster, he was at least a monster she knew.
 </p>
 
 <p>
“Upheaval,” Irhina said. “The future tangled into the past, and the past into the future. The cards gave me a reading, and now it begins to come clear. The old will clash with the new, and the new with the old.”
 </p>
 
 <p>
“But what does it mean?” The nobleman's eyes glowed yellow as he turned toward Irhina.
 </p>
 
 <p>
“The cards are but cards,” she told him. “They do not know who the role card in this tale will be. So, in this, they can tell us no meaning. That is for us to find.”
 </p>
 
 <p>
“Or whoever's in there,” the nobleman said, looking back at the tiny figures in the dome.
 </p>
 
 <p>
“Yes.” Irhina clasped her arms against a renewed chill of apprehension. “Or whoever's in there.” </p>

Paizo is pleased to announce that Archon Studio will be taking over the license to produce Starfinder Masterclass miniatures, formerly produced by Ninja Division. As part of the agreement, Archon will fulfill backer rewards from the Starfinder Masterclass Kickstarter.</p>
	<p><b>About Archon Studio:</b> With their Unicast technology, <a href='https://archon-studio.com/'>Archon Studio</a> has published several board games with miniatures, including <a href='https://archon-studio.com/games/league-of-ancient-defenders'>League of Ancient Defenders</a>, <a href='https://archon-studio.com/games/vanguard-of-war'>Vanguard of War</a>, and <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/archonstudio/chronicle-x-by-archon-studio?ref=archonwwwr&token=a42bb185'>Chronicle X</a>. Recently, Archon Studio advanced its technology to hard plastic, which resulted in even more highly detailed miniatures.</p>
	<p>Archon Studio also recently moved into the production of tabletop terrain with <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/archonstudio/rampart-magnetized-modular-terrain-for-tabletop/comments'>Rampart Wargaming</a>. In August this year, its second tabletop terrain project, <a href='https://www.dungeonsandlasers.com/'>Dungeons & Lasers</a>, is being launched on Kickstarter.</p>
	<p>There are a few areas we want to highlight:</p>
	<p><b>Archon Studio will be producing plastic miniatures instead of resin.</b> They will also be starting over with Kickstarter fulfillment; this means that backers who have already received resin miniatures from Ninja Division will receive those minis again from Archon, this time in plastic.</p>
	<p><b>Archon Studio plans to ship Kickstarter rewards in waves.</b> Approximately every 6 months, the pledge rewards produced during the previous 6 months will be shipped to backers free of charge. Additionally, any time a Kickstarter backer purchases any Starfinder mini from Archon Studio—whether that’s a new mini or a duplicate of a Kickstarter mini—they will also ship any released Kickstarter miniatures due to that backer for no additional charge. Details of which minis are shipping when, and how to purchase other miniatures, will be posted on the <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/325468910/starfinder-masterclass-miniatures'>Kickstarter</a> page.</p>
	<p><b>Archon Studio will be fulfilling backers in Europe, and Ninja Division will be shipping to the rest of the world.</b> Paizo does not have specific answers to fulfillment questions: if you’re a backer with a question about your order, you’ll need to post the question to the <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/325468910/starfinder-masterclass-miniatures/description'>Starfinder Masterclass Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
	<p>Thanks for all of your patience as we worked with Ninja Division and Archon to get this done. We’re looking forward to some epic minis!</p>

		<p>“Five strangers board a caravan heading to Lastwall, an ancient kingdom watching over the grave of a long dead menace. Signed up as conscripts in the army, they face years of training and service, but as smoke begins to rise from the horizon they must come together as friends if they are to have any chance at survival.”</p>

			<p style="font-size: 13px;">Left to right: Erika Fermina, Rachel Seeley, Aki, Jason Bulmahn, Gina DeVivo, and Jeremy Steven Walker</p>
		</div> 
		<p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b> (@JasonBulmahn) got his start in gaming administering the Living Greyhawk campaign, but soon after was hired as the Managing Editor of Dragon magazine. After the end of the magazine’s print run, Jason became the Lead Designer of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Now, as Paizo’s Director of Game Design, he leads the team behind Pathfinder Second Edition. He is also an experienced Game Master, writing and running the Oblivion Oath, a Pathfinder Actual Play stream on Twitch, and the Knights of Everflame, a new series for Geek and Sundry.</p>
		<p><b>Gina DeVivo</b> (@PocketGina) is your friendly neighborhood RPG craft wizard. Having been in the entertainment industry since she was 11 years old means she's got some groovy stories from the sets of Madmen, Scrubs, and Hannah Montana to name a few. Lately, she's been three character sheets stacked in a trench coat on Geek & Sundry's Callisto 6, Shield Of Tomorrow, and TBD RPG. If podcasts are your jam you can find her providing the voices of Windsgar the goblin on Plunders and Blunders and lover of magic, Olive, on Champions of the Earth. Also, minty things make her sneeze.</p>
		<p><b>Jeremy Steven Walker</b> (@JwalkerScene) is an American actor originally from Memphis, Tennessee. His first television appearance came by way of a national commercial for Crocs that aired during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Since then, Jeremy’s resume has grown considerably, as he has starred in over thirty film and television productions, several award nominated stage plays, and dozens of worldwide and national commercial campaigns. Quoted by film producer, Mark G. Mathis (Precious, Brick, The Identical) as  "an extraordinary talent with recognizable star quality," Jeremy's dynamic on camera presence and effortless charm have helped solidify his place as one of the film industry's top actors to watch.</p>
		<p><b>Aki</b> (@MxGiniInABottle) is a recent transplant to Los Angeles and is a relative newcomer to the world of online RPG-E, though they have been rolling dice and playing tabletop games since university. Their most recent on-screen work includes New Pantheon, a Scion game on Saving Throw Show, and a guest spot on Geek & Sundry’s Callisto 6!</p>
		<p><b>Erika Fermina</b> (@astylepixie) is an actress, stylist, and fantasy enthusiast. You can sometimes spot her on a commercial but usually she’s playing games with Girls Guts Glory! </p>
		<p><b>Rachel Seeley</b> (@Sunnyseeley) is a fan of all Tabletop RPGs and an actress is always ecstatic to combine the two. She has appeared on G&S before playing on Tales from the Loop, Weave, the Critical Role anniversary prequel and GMing on Weave!</p>
		<p><b>Chris Fishel</b> (@AKAthefish) grew up on the sets of sitcom television from the time he was seven years old where he discovered his true passion for storytelling and fell in love with making feature films. 25 feature films later Mr. Fishel brought his talent for narrative storytelling into the RPG-E space in September 2017 when he joined the team at Geek and Sundry. After producing shows like Starter Kit, Painters Guild and Game Masters Hall, Mr. Fishel is proud to be the Director and producer of the new The Knights of Everflame series. </p>
		<p>Knights of Everflame airs every Tuesday through September 17. If you miss an episode on Twitch, you’ll be able to catch the replays one week after the premiere.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Pathfinder Society's Gen Con 2019 Scenarios</h1>

<p class="date" style="margin-bottom:1rem !important;">Wednesday, July 24, 2019</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

		<p itemprop="description">It’s nearly August 1st, and that means we’re about a week away from launching the Second Edition of Pathfinder in all its glory. What better way to do that than with some great adventures? Today we’re previewing not only the final scenario for the First Edition campaign, but also the wealth of new Second Edition content kicking off the Year of the Open Road!</p>
		<p>First off, we have the last scenario for Pathfinder Society with the First Edition rules: <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1023-Passing-the-Torch-Part-2-Who-Speaks-for-the-Ten'>Passing the Torch, Part 2: Who Speaks for the Ten</a>. This scenario features the dream team of John Compton and Thurston Hillman as authors (neither of whom wrote this part of the blog, so I can get away with praising them). It’s written for Tier 12–18, so if you’re looking for a chance to play high level content, I recommend that you play June’s scenario <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1022-Passing-the-Torch-Part-1-Who-Wears-the-Mask'>Passing the Torch, Part 1: Who Wears the Mask</a> first, then continue the story to its grand conclusion here. </p>
		<p>In Passing the Torch Part 2, the PCs return to Absalom only to find the Grand Lodge’s gates sealed, with all manner of chaos taking place within. The PCs are the last line of defense against the schemes of an evil mastermind who plans to unbury and animate deceased Pathfinders on a massive scale. In this scenario, the PCs learn new secrets about the mysterious Decemvirate, and must make several crucial decisions. One of these concerns the fate of the polarizing and enigmatic information broker Grandmaster Torch, illustrated below by Vicky Yarova. If you want to uncover more of this scenario’s mysteries, put on your GM hat or bring your highest-level character and dive in!</p>

		<div class="blurbCenter">

		</div>

		<p>In <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01zna?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Origin-of-the-Open-Road'>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Origin of the Open Road</a>, a Tier 5 adventure for pregenerated characters written by Ron Lundeen, the PCs are sent to Nexus House in Quantium, looking to retrieve some old records of the Pathfinder Society missing from the Grand Lodge’s oft-beset archives. As the PCs undertake their mission to find the documents detailing long-missing truths about the origins of the Pathfinder Society itself, the magical constructs and abstruse arcanists of Quantium present unexpected aid and obstacles in near equal measure!</p>
		<p>Arcane guardians and alchemical creations are far from the only threats the PCs will face, however. Other parties seek to glean the ancient secrets of Nexus House for their own purposes, while those who count themselves as friends of the Society juggle their own responsibilities. What friends and nemeses hide in Quantium’s shadows? What allies might the PCs discover as they seek the lost histories of the Pathfinder Society?</p>

		</div>

		<p><a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation'>Pathfinder Society Scenario 1-01: The Absalom Initiation</a>, by Lyz Liddell, is the scenario to play if you want a strong grounding in Pathfinder Society lore. This Tier 1–4 scenario begins with the PCs receiving a party invitation from newly promoted Head Initiate Janira Gavix (illustrated by Gislaine Avila). Visit iconic locations in Absalom like the Blakros Museum, meet the new faction leaders, and learn what the faction leaders from First Edition are doing now. As this scenario is repeatable, players who participate in the scenario for a second and third time are likely to find themselves learning the stories of different First Edition faction leaders and embarking on different missions, facing new challenges along the way. </p>

		</div>

		<p>When the team was brainstorming scenario ideas, we began asking ourselves what kinds of adventures we’d created recently: explore the place, recover the artifact, punch the villain, and that type has received plenty of attention, but we recognized that for all the Pathfinders love breaking into sites, they’ve not spent nearly enough time investigating cryptids. Months before, a close friend had insisted that a spooky being known as the Mosquito Witch was a well-known cryptid, yet for all our searching, we could find no reference to such a creature on the internet. It seemed the ideal time for a cryptid hunt, the Mosquito Witch seemed the ideal creature, and we found the ideal author to write <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01znc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-102-The-Mosquito-Witch'>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-02: The Mosquito Witch</a>: Eleanor Ferron, who brings an endearing yet haunting creepiness to the adventure. At long last the creature can spread its sinister wings and come to life! I mean, just look at that adorable commemorative Mosquito Witch doll!</p>
		<p>The PCs travel to the quaint river town of Shimmerford, which has embraced the Mosquito Witch legend for decades ever since residents first spotted the creature. But what had been a light-hearted mascot cryptid for the town has recently become a living nightmare. It’s up to the PCs to get to the bottom of this local legend before they and the entire populace are sucked dry!</p>

		<p>For our next adventure, <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01znd?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-103-Escaping-the-Grave'>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1–03: Escaping the Grave</a>, author Adrian Ng takes us on a Tier 1–4 adventure into the undead-haunted Gravelands. As the undead hordes serving Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, ravaged the Inner Sea, heroes of the Pathfinder Society united to form a powerful line of defense against the encroaching darkness. When the Tyrant was defeated, the Society’s brave explorers were the first to re-enter the Gravelands, seeking to recover the irreplaceable relics of Lastwall, aid any lost survivors, and survey the extent of Tar-Baphon’s corruption. Most have not returned from the haunted and blasted lands.</p>
		<p>Those members of the Society who have completed the round trip to and from the Gravelands have returned with valuable information, including relatively safe roads and passages, as well as detailed information on the movements of the undead hordes patrolling the countryside. Armed with this information, Venture-Captain Evni Zongnoss calls for Pathfinder agents willing to undertake a somber task indeed: rescue any surviving Pathfinders near a small town, and if they’re confirmed dead, retrieve their bodies (or at least their <i>wayfinders</i>) so that the brave agents can be memorialized on the Wall of Names and so their families and friends might have proper closure. The PCs will need to be quick if they are to get in and out without drawing the attention of Tar-Baphon’s unbreathing minions, but some undead are faster than others, and speed alone will not be enough to complete this vital task.</p>

		<p><a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01zne/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-1A-The-Sandstone-Secret#1'>Pathfinder Society Quest 1A: The Sandstone Secret</a>, is a Tier 1–4 quest. In this adventure, the PCs travel to a recently discovered site in Osirion, only to find out someone unexpected waiting for them within. Whatever the case may be, the guard watching over the site, Officer Elrekah, hasn’t noticed anything amiss (illustration by Dion Harris). This quest is repeatable, and author Linda Zayas-Palmer wrote it with that in mind. It features three different possible encounters as well a batch of clues for the GM to pull from to keep the scenario fresh on multiple playthroughs. </p>

		<p itemprop="description">This month is an exciting month for Starfinder Society, as we’re set to release the second wave of adventures for our second season. These scenarios are pretty important to the team, as they represent two different things: the new and the old.</p>

		<p>Bringing in “the new” we have <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn7?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-203-The-Withering-World'>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-03: The Withering World,</a> a quest pack containing five smaller sized adventures, written by Arc Riley, Jennifer Povey, Jessica Catalan, Rigby Bendele, and Shahreena Shahrani. Each of these authors brings a unique style and interesting encounters into a story that has the Starfinder Society exploring a new world locked in an impossible orbit between a sun and a black hole. The arrival of some particularly nasty cultists complicates matters, and the PCs need to step in to prevent an entire unexplored world from tumbling into the nearby stellar phenomena! This quest pack is particularly exciting because it’s Starfinder Society’s first such pack to include five quests, which should provide more content for those looking to run these events at their local gaming space. (For upcoming quest series, we’ll likely be jumping between four and five quests each—whatever makes the most sense for the story). This pack also has the Repeatable tag, bringing it into our growing stable of repeatable content that players can use to level up and explore the setting with new characters.</p>

		<p>Our second July scenario takes a look at something older and expands the fan-beloved story for the false moon of Salvation’s End. The strange moon contains many secrets and veteran freelancer Matt Duval didn’t back away from tackling the next big part of the Salvation’s End storyline. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-204-Futures-Fall">Starfinder Society Scenario #2-04: Future's Fall</a> brings us back inside the moon to enter one of its mysterious vaults; don’t worry, this scenario acts perfectly as a stand-alone mission and doesn’t require that players have any prior knowledge about the false moon (though playing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme">Starfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</a> and <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btpya0dv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-120-Duskmire-Accord-9'>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-20: Duskmire Accord 9</a> can certainly help!) Matt is no stranger to writing for Paizo, as he’s written the incredibly successful <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btpya0a3'>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-19: To Conquer the Dragon</a> and <a href='https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wer'>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</a>, both of which seem to have dragons on the cover—Spoiler: there’s no dragons in this scenario. What Future’s Fall does have in store for the PCs is the opportunity to travel to a theoretical future where the Pact Worlds as we know it is gone, and the cause of this collapse may be related to a very real threat that has yet to pass. Methinks there’s some big hints in this scenario for possible future* events, and players interested in the ongoing Starfinder Society storyline are going to want to play it as soon as they can schedule it.</p>

		<p>We look forward to hearing from our fans attending Gen Con 2019, especially about their impressions of these scenarios. You can find us in the Sagamore Ballroom, where all our various Organized Play games will be taking place, hosting panels in Room 212, or at Booth #103 in the Exhibit Hall, so don’t hesitate to stop by and introduce yourself.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, come back next month, when we return with our first August scenario to the planet Castrovel for a bit of a historic reenactment and then kick-off the first two-part scenario in Starfinder Society history with August’s second release.</p>

		<p>Until next time,</p>

 <p>Throughout Pathfinder's history, no region has been as thoroughly explored in the pages of our adventures as the frontier land of Varisia. For millennia, the untamed land was defined by its ancient past, as Varisians, Shoanti, and explorers and colonists from distant lands all eked out a living in the shadow of cyclopean Thassilonian ruins. But in the past decade, the long-dormant runelords awakened and attempted to reclaim their former empire. Alaznist, Karzoug, Krune, Xanderghul, and Zutha have all been defeated, and the powerful heroes who foiled their plans now watch over the land, leading many to hope for a safer future for inhabitants of cities like Korvosa and Magnimar. As the latter grows in prominence to become the largest and most influential Varisian settlement, Korvosa continues to decline, even under the new leadership of Cressida Kroft, who took over in the wake of the tyrannical, plague-tainted rule of Queen Ileosa. </p>
 
 <div class="blurbCenter">

A fully armoured warrior with a matching shield almost as tall as they are. The shield is pointed at each end, edged in gold, and has a rune in red across the front. The Gray Maiden also wears an armoured face mask, a plume of red hair flowing from the back. Her cape is almost the same color as her hair. She wields a long sword in her right hand." /></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Andrea Tentori Montalto</p></div> 

<p>But Magnimar is far from the only kingdom in resurgence. In the northern reaches of Varisia—the hilly plains of the Nolands and the impossibly high Kodar Mountains—the two surviving runelords have claimed a new kingdom of their own: New Thassilon! Under the conflicting rules of envious Runelord Belimarius and the less expansionist Runelord Sorshen, New Thassilon is already on the brink of civil war as the two powerful wizards vie for contril of the new kingdom. From her capital of Xin-Edasseril off Varisia's western coast, Belimarius already sets her sights on the elven forest of Celwynvian and the southern Lands of the Linnorm Kings, but these long-established lands are not so quick to roll over and bow before the upstart runelord. Sorshen has set her capital in Xin-Shalast, high in the Kodar Mountains, where no one has claimed the land since before Earthfall. With no feuds for territory (other than from Belimarius, who has no desire to share power), Sorshen has opened the isolated city up to outcasts and exiles from across the world, promising them a safe place to live their lives free from the oppression of their enemies.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Rogier van de Beek</p></div>

<p>To the north, the balance of power in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings has shifted, and three new linnorm crowns sit upon new brows. King Thira Ash-Eyes earned her right to rule Kalsgard after her father, King Svienn Blood-Eagle departed for Valenhall across the sea, leaving the throne vacant for her should she slay a linnorm (she did). In Icemark, the Varki ranger Nankou surprised many by being the first non-Ulfen to earn the title. In the southern city of Jol, the famed adventurer Ostog the Unslain puts his moniker to the test as the Linnorm King closest to Runelord Belimarius's lands. What great sagas of these new Linnorm Kings and the mighty heroes who vie for future vacant thrones will be told in the near future? Perhaps some wise skald will regale us with tales of heroism in another decade's time.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Yasen Stoilov</p></div>

<p>Relations between the Ulfen of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and the Jadwiga of its eastern neighbor, Irissen, have cooled in recent years (pun intended), thanks to the rise of Queen Anastasia, who hails from a distant world where magic is less prevalent. While not a daughter of Baba Yaga like the ice queens who preceded her, the legendary witch's blood nevertheless flows through her veins. A much more benevolent ruler than past queens, Anastasia gives the people of Irrisen and its neighbors hope for a better future. Nevertheless, the constant winter of the enchanted land continues, and rumors of Baba Yaga's presence in the land out of season persist. Could the mother of witches have plans to reassert control over the land by placing a new daughter on the throne in Anastasia's place?</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Oksana Federova</p></div>

<p>Like the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords to Irrisen's east seems on the precipice of peace for the first time in over a century, as the threats of winter witches to the west, the demons of the Worldwound to the east, and the orcs of Belkzen to the south have all subsided. This has allowed the nomadic Kellids of the harsh taiga to travel farther into all three neighboring lands in their seasonal hunts of the region's megafauna than ever before. Despite the lack of open antagonists on their borders, potential conflicts with repatriating Sarkorians, xenophobic Irrisens, and those orcs not focused on the Whispering Tyrant's forces on their southern border could all prove problematic for the migratory Mammoth Lord holdings. After all, honor is everything and tempers can flare, and it just takes one spark to start a fire that could set the entire plain ablaze.</p>

<p>Check this space on Thursday for a new piece of flash fiction by Liane Merciel to inspire new stories of adventure in players and Game Masters alike, and then next Tuesday for the final meta-region of the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting: the Shining Kingdoms. Until then, Pathfinders, may your exploits be marked in the sagas of the gods!</p>

			<p itemprop="description">This week, we’re going to take a look at the tools the new edition provides the GM to tell awesome stories full of interesting foes and hazards as well as plenty of opportunity to shine the spotlight on the PCs and show off how incredible the PCs are!</p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">

			<p>But before I get too mired into details of the rules, I want to talk about the high-quality overall GM advice in the book. For instance, my favorite bit of GM advice is this section in Gamemastering on adjudicating the rules, where we flat out tell you the underlying principles so you can design improvised rules on the fly!</p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_adjudicating.png" alt="Text inset: If you don’t know how long a quick task takes, go with 1 action, or 2 actions if a character shouldn’t be able to perform it three times per round.  
					If you’re not sure what action a task uses, look for the most similar basic action. If you don’t find one, make up an action adding any necessary traits (usually attack, concentrate, manipulate, or move).
					When two sides are opposed, have one roll against the other’s DC. Don’t have both sides roll (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character who rolls is usually the one acting (except in the case of saving throws).
					If an effect raises or lowers chances of success, grant a +1 circumstance bonus or a –1 circumstance penalty.
					If you’re not sure how difficult a significant challenge should be, use the DC for the party’s level.
					If you’re making up an effect, creatures should be incapacitated or killed on only a critical success (or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).
					If you don’t know what check to use, pick the most appropriate skill. If no other skill applies to a check to Recall Knowledge, use an appropriate Lore skill (usually at an untrained proficiency rank).
					Use the characters’ daily preparations as the time to reset anything that lasts roughly a day.
					When a character accomplishes something noteworthy that doesn’t have rules for XP, award them XP for an accomplishment (10 to 30 XP, as described on page 507).
					When the PCs fail at a task, look for a way they might fail forward, meaning the story moves forward with a negative consequence rather than the failure halting progress entirely."/>
			</div>

			<p>There’re tips on encounter, session, adventure, and campaign management as well! One useful new tool we added was the Pathfinder baseline, which essentially explains a baseline assumption for edgy content. Whether you want to follow it or not is totally up to your group. It’s a conversation starter; the baseline determines what you should expect from our published adventures, and we’ll tell you if there’s an exception. Similarly, for a home game, if you read the baseline and want to add or remove restrictions (or scrap it entirely!) you now know that you should talk to the rest of your group first. Lack of communication often arises when everyone has their own baselines and assumes everyone shares theirs.</p>
			<p>But you want some hard rules, right? We have rules for encounters, exploration, and downtime, as well as rules for all sorts of environmental effects, natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, and hazards like haunts and traps. For a quick taste of these before we move on, take a look at these temperature effects. Unlike First Edition, they aren’t based on the legacy Pacific Northwest sensibilities where a day of summer back home on the East Coast would kill me from nonlethal damage!</p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_10_13.png" alt="Text inset: TABLE 10-13: TEMPERATURE EFFECTS.
				Category: Temperature: Fatigue: Damage.
				Incredible cold: -80 degrees F or colder: 2 hours: Moderate cold every minute.
				Extreme cold: -79 degrees F to -20 degrees F: 4 hours: Minor cold every 10 minutes.
				Severe cold: -21 degrees F to 12 degrees F: 4 hours: Minor cold every hour.
				Mild cold: 13 degrees F to 32 degrees F: 4 hours: None.
				Normal: 33 degrees F to 94 degrees F: 8 hours: None.
				Mild heat: 95 degrees F to 104 degrees F: 4 hours: None.
				Severe heat: 105 degrees F to 114 degrees F: 4 hours: Minor fire every hour.
				Extreme heat: 115 degrees F to 139 degrees F: 4 hours: Minor fire every 10 minutes.
				Incredible heat: 140 degrees F or warmer: 2 hours: Moderate fire every minute.
				*Adjust temperatures down by 15 degrees in areas of high humidity." />

			<p>For our in-depth look, let’s start with guidelines for skill DCs! You might’ve seen the simple DCs before from Jason’s spoilers, but we have those, as well as a level by level DC table for tasks against something of that level, which you can adjust by 2, 5, or 10 if it’s particularly easy or hard. For instance, learning a 6th level spell or identifying level 11 monster is DC 28, but uncommon spells or monsters are DC 30, and rare spells or monsters are DC 33. You’ll also notice these DCs are much easier to make than before, thanks to playtest guidance through a series of other numbers, we’ve alighted on a strong set that can help show off how amazing your PCs are!</p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_simpledcs.png" alt="Text inset: TABLE 10-4: SIMPLE DCs.

			<p>Speaking of monsters! The <i>Bestiary</i> contains friends and foes of all sorts, from the classic to the brand new. Take a look at the skeleton for a moment.</p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_skeletons.jpg">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_skeletons_500.jpeg" alt="Pathfinder Bestiary Entries for various types of Skeletons, including the Skeleton Guard, Skeletal Champion, Skeletal Horse, Skeletal Giant and Skeletal Hulk. Featuring illustrations of the Skeletal Champion and Skeletal Horse." />
				</a>
				<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Johnny Marrow</p>
			</div>
			<p>You can build any skeleton you need at lightning speed, and add fun special abilities like exploding bones, throwing heads, or collapsing into piles of bones! Plus check out the lore sidebar about vital essence; playtesters demanded to see more of the four magical essences in the foreground, so they’re coming out to play everything once in a while!</p>
			
			<p>What about a newcomer? The gogiteth is a gross skittery critter with a lot of fun movement and grapple abilities. Can you still have an interesting encounter against a purely melee 12th-level foe when the PCs have so many special options at their fingertips? The gogiteth wants to say “yes” but it has you in its mouth and is currently skittering around, so you’ll have to take my word for it. </p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">

			<p>To close out our monster review, let’s take a look at some friendly creatures…</p>
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_gremlins.jpg">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_gremlins_500.jpeg" alt="Pathfinder Bestiary Entries for various types of Gremlins, including the Mitflit, Pugwampi, and Jinkin. Featuring illustrations of the Pugwampi and Jinkin." />
				</a>
				<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Yasen Stoilov</p>
			</div>
			<p>Whoops, some gremlins in the gears! Those aren’t friendly at all. Each gremlin has a special way that they make life miserable for those around them, except perhaps the incomplete mitflits, who are just themselves miserable little guys. Maybe you can help give them a social order and teach them that self-loathing isn’t the answer? If you think like that, you might like these actually friendly allies.</p>
			
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_archons.jpg">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_archons_500.jpeg" alt="Pathfinder Bestiary Entries for various types of Archons, including the Legion Archon and Shield Archon. Featuring illustrations of the Legion Archon and Shield Archon." />
				</a>
				<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustrations by Bryan Sola and Firat Solhan</p>
			</div>
			<p>Each archon represents a particular virtue, with justice and courage shown here. The legion archon takes justice into its own hands (literally) with some powerful offense, while the shield archon explores courage as the virtue of bravery to sacrifice yourself for others and stand in the thick of things. And if you’re sharp-eyed, you now know one of the other archons in the book as well! Meanwhile, on the chaotic side…</p>
			
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_azatas.jpg">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_azatas_500.jpeg" alt="Pathfinder Bestiary Entries for various types of Azatas, including the Lillend (Muse Azata) and Ghaele (Crusader Azata). Featuring illustrations of the Lillend and Ghaele." />
				</a>
				<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Raph Lomotan</p>
			</div>
			<p>Azatas each represent a freedom. Ghaeles stand for the freedom to bear arms against oppression, and they’re energy form and energy focus have a revamp to fit their concept and be a bit more interesting; take a look! Lillends are the embodiment of freedom of expression and a great summon for a party looking for a quick bard. Plus, they are a great choice for your bard’s muse. The other great option? Take a look at the nymph!</p>
			
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_nymph_01.jpg">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_nymph_01_500.jpeg" alt="Pathfinder Bestiary Entries for various types of Nymphs, including the Naiad and Dryad. Featuring an illustration of the Naiad." />
				</a>
			</div>
			<div class="blurbCenter">
				<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_nymphpage2.jpg">
					<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072219_nymphpage2_500.jpeg" alt="Pathfinder Bestiary Entries for various types of Nymphs, including the Naiad Queen and Dryad Queen. Featuring an illustrations of the Dryad Queen." />
				</a>
				<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustrations by Emile Denis</p>
			</div>
			<p>The nymph entry gives you not only low-level nymph allies like the naiad or dryad, but also tools to build powerful nymph queens like Myriana or Svevanka from Rise of the Runelords or Nyrissa from Kingmaker, with special rules for being a bard’s muse! This should make the entries for classic nymphs like the lampad much more interesting—note the intriguing and new-to-Pathfinder hesperides mentioned in the sidebar as well!</p>
			
			<p>To close off, a personal note: I’m most of the way through book five of the War for the Crown Adventure Path, which I’m running in Second Edition. GMing it has been a joy; preparing and running have been much easier than when I ran Jade Regent or Rise of the Runelords in First Edition, even including the effort of converting the adventure. Other Paizo community members running in the playtest have noted this as well, including community member Ediwir, who is running War for the Crown in both First Edition and the playtest at the same time to compare. If you’ve ever wanted to GM Pathfinder before but it just looked daunting, Second Edition is the perfect time to give it a shot! You’ll have all these tools at your fingertips to make life easier, and everyone’s starting out too, so there will be tons of community support and goodwill, as well as more than a little patience for mistakes. I hope you’ll join me and give running a game a shot. If you do, what are you most excited to run first? The Age of Ashes Adventure Path? <i>The Fall of Plaguestone?</i> Pathfinder Society adventures? Something special you’re brewing up at home? Let me know in the comments below!</p>

	<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_GoblinMarkersRules.png" alt="Rules: Goblin markers. One side of each of these role cards uses goblin markers. Each character using goblin markers chooses one type of marker. (Since there are only 7 markers of each type in the game, this means that unless you have a power that allows you to steal markers, you cannot have more than 7 goblin markers on your role.)" /><br />
	<p style="font-size: 13px;">Speaking of crazy, I give you goblin markers!</p>
</div> 

<p>Disclaimer: Half of the following roles use a new mechanic called goblin markers. A goblin does something it should probably be doing already and is rewarded with a marker that lets it do something else it wants to do. I’m sure nothing can go wrong here.</p>

	</a>
	<p style="font-size: 13px;">Crimsi is making a trebuchet. Will she load it with fire, rocks, or other goblins?</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s start with our favorite Goblin ranger, Crimsi. She’s really into inventing things, as long as “things” can fling destruction and fire about. She’ll cheerfully scout for you, but she’s easily distracted by bits of junk and fire. </p>
<p>Arson Archer Crimsi would like you to know that she likes burning, crossbows, fire, catapults, and any other words for fire and siege weapons she hasn’t learned yet. It’s a fairly straightforward role that wants you to care about Bow and Fire cards. She can also launch goblins (including herself) to other locations with hardly any chance of serious injury.</p>
<p>Kitbasher Crimsi likes gathering those new goblin markers together so she can bash things together, whether the result is helping, hurting, or both. Mostly both. She’s good at flinging things into fights her friends are probably in, or flinging her friends at fights, and is great at Crafting new things that will probably hurt someone.</p>

	</a>
	<p style="font-size: 13px;">Whether you’re into head injuries or giant bunnies, Grenek’s got you covered.</p>
</div>
<p>Grenek is not as tough as Amiri and has less control over his rage, as befits a goblin barbarian. He also has a habit of biting every monster he gets near. </p>
<p>Amnesiac Grenek focuses on his head injury that sent him randomly wandering the world. He’s good at forgetting his cards to rage, wandering in the way of attacks meant for his friends, and even forgetting his scourges so well they don’t bother him anymore.</p>
<p>Rabbitpuncher Grenek is used to adventuring in the lands of giants where bunnies grow bigger than goblins. He gets to have fun with goblin markers, potentially gaining a massive bonus to his hand size and checks, hopping about everywhere, and getting even better at biting. </p>

	<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_PizazzBattlecrooner.jpg">

		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_PizazzWhistleblower_360.jpeg" width="300" alt="Whistleblower. Those who shriek the truth will find it." />
	</a>
	<p style="font-size: 13px;">No, “pizazz” means alluring and charming. I don’t have any pizza!</p>
</div>
<p>Pizazz is good at helping his friends, like any bard. The wrinkle he runs into is that he has a genuinely fantastic singing voice... that sends goblins running away in pain. They really like when he plays his “fancy” penny whistle, though.</p>
<p>Battlecrooner Pizazz leans into using his mellifluous voice, despite any panic it may cause nearby goblins. As a result, he makes lots of non-goblin allies that turn out to be pretty darn useful, whether he’s getting to use them more often or they’re appreciating his instrumentless crooning.</p>
<p>Whistleblower Pizazz goes another way, embracing his goblin heritage (and markers) to whistle up bonuses and spook any upcoming monsters into fighting his goblin friends. He’s maybe a little bitter that said friends don’t appreciate his true talent, so from time to time he might steal some of their markers. (The fools won’t miss them anyway.)</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
	<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_Mitzi.jpg">
		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_Mitzi_360.jpeg" alt="Despite all evidence to the contrary, Siathorn sees Mitzi as a wolf -- a fuzzy, white, hairbow-wearing wolf. A wolf that likes to surprise goblins by jumping up and licking their face." />
	</a>
	<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornFront.jpg">
		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornFront_360.jpeg" alt="Siathorn loves her wolf Mitzi. Because she's so very prit-zy. If you try to call her 'dog'. Then I smack you with a log!" />
	</a>
	<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornBack.jpg">
		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornBack_360.jpeg" alt="Siathorn loves her wolf Mitzi. Because she's so very prit-zy. If you try to call her 'dog'. Then I smack you with a log!" />
	</a>
	<p style="font-size: 13px;">Mitzi is still the prettiest wolf. Yes, she is!</p>
</div>
<p>Siathorn and her fearless wolf Mitzi are still keeping the other goblins in line with Mitzi’s threatening facelicks. She’s not quite as good at druiding as Lini, but Mitzi more than makes up for that!</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
	<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornTreemugger.jpg">
		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornTreemugger_360.jpeg" alt="Treemugger. Protect the trees, lest you have nothing to drop goblins from." />
	</a>
	<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornWolfmother.jpg">
		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornWolfmother_360.jpeg" alt="Wolfmother. It licks you to know if it should eat you." /><br />
	</a>
	<p style="font-size: 13px;">Siathorn is probably going to be mercilessly hugging both trees and wolves, regardless of which role you pick.</p>
</div>
<p>Treemugger Siathorn easily gathers goblin markers by just playing with everyone’s animals. She then helps everyone at Wild locations and against bunches of natural banes. She’ll also make sure to heal her friends! They might need it after she steals a few of their Animal allies away from them.</p>
<p>Wolfmother Siathorn focuses her efforts on Mitzi, as well she should. Under her care, Mitzi becomes a very effective fighting “wolf” and Siathorn figures out how to make sure she keeps her deck full of all those fun Animal cards that Mitzi likes.</p>

<p>So, how do you get these neat roles? We’ve updated our <a href= https://paizo.com/products/btpy914x?Community-Use-Package-Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Character-Sheets>Character Sheet package</a> to include sheets for all four of these goblins, including their roles. And in the near future, they’ll also be available as a print-on-demand card set from our friends at DriveThru Cards.  (After they go live, we’ll mention it in a future blog.)</p>

	<h2>Kingmaker Adventure Path</h2>
	<div>
		<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071819_kingmaker_adventurepath_500.jpeg" alt="Wizard archetype. A dark-skinned man with a thin mustache holds his right hand out, casting an upside down teardrop-shaped glow of blue. In his left hand, he firmly holds a pointed staff upright.

		<p>In Kingmaker, your player characters are more than mere adventurers. They are destined to become the rulers of the world’s newest kingdom—a nation that you get to build from the ground up as the campaign unfolds! In the northeastern corner of the sprawling expanse of the River Kingdoms lies an unclaimed wilderness known as the Stolen Lands. If your PCs can defeat the bandits and monsters that infest the central portion of the Stolen Lands, you’ll be able to establish your new nation therein... but this is only the beginning. Rugged mountains, sprawling swamps, and tangled forests border your new home on all sides, and as you expand into these lands you’ll forge new alliances, clash with new foes, and uncover an ancient menace that has long lurked in the overgrown corners of the Stolen Lands. But once you’ve claimed your territory, can your party defend this hard-won kingdom from war on its borders and supernatural threats from within? Will you rule with justice and mercy, or will you become the very monsters you fought to oppose? In the <i>Kingmaker Adventure Path,</i> the destiny of the world’s newest nation is yours to decide!</p>
		<p>A stunning 640-page hardcover, the <i>Kingmaker Adventure Path</i> provides GMs everything they need to run this epic campaign. All six chapters published in 2010 will be updated to Pathfinder Second Edition rules—plus a new prologue makes its tabletop debut in this release! Detailed appendices provide GMs with flavorful gazetteers of the campaign’s myriad locations, from the Stolen Lands at large to the rival city of Pitax.</p>
		<p>The <i>Kingmaker Adventure Path</i> also features complete rules for hex-map exploration, kingdom building, and management to bring the campaign’s most innovative elements to life at your table. Lastly, a bestiary of new and updated monsters that feature prominently in the Adventure Path give GMs of any campaign new tools to torment their player characters with! The expanded adventure path also includes new material, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Barony Expansion:</i> You’ll get a wealth of new tools, options, and encounters to complicate your players’ lives during the early days of their nation’s foundation. What strange events, dangerous complications, and unexpected boons await, and what effect might they have on the nation during its tender formative years?
			</li>	
			<li>
				<i>Season of Bloom:</i> A strange and frightening contagion spreads through your lands—people are getting sick, going mad, and ultimately bursting open as horrific monsters emerge from within to rampage through the kingdom! Can you cure this strange affliction and bring the Season of Bloom to a close before your nation falls apart from within?
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Candlemere Dungeon:</i> The ancient legacy of an eldritch god still holds sway. The deadly truths hidden away within the chambers below Candlemere will test your PCs to the very limits of sanity and life alike! Are the powerful treasures and ancient secrets to be discovered in the sprawling ruins below Candlemere worth the dangers your PCs will face, or are some things best left forgotten?
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Cursed King:</i> Take your Kingmaker PCs on their most deadly and dangerous adventure ever! With this expansion, the <i>Kingmaker Adventure Path</i> will provide enough content for your party of adventurers to reach the absolute height of power, finishing the campaign as 20th-level heroes... that is, if you can survive these final epic encounters!
			</li>
		</ul>

He appears to be wearing a shoulder wrap that is white with pink flowers underneath his headscarf." align="left" width="300" />
		<p><i>Kingmaker Companion Guide:</i> The adventures don’t stop in Kingmaker’s core campaign. Inspired by the hit CRPG from Owlcat Games, the <i>Kingmaker Companion Guide:</i> is a 128-page hardcover that expands on the experience by providing details on twelve companion NPCs who are destined to accompany you into the Stolen Lands. Each NPC in the <i>Kingmaker Companion Guide:</i> is presented at several points during their adventuring careers, and as your PCs get to know them, each will reveal additional quests in the Stolen Lands, giving your party ever more opportunities to grow in power and fame. From the base campaign, sidequest adventures will be included for Amiri, Ekundayo, Jubilost, Linzi, Nok-Nok, Tristian, and Valerie.</p>
		<p>Further rules expanding specialized roles in kingdom management, shenanigans that could take place around campfires or in taverns between adventures, and other downtime activities will help to fill the gaps between adventures and improve your characters’ and your kingdom’s legend with each friend you make!</p>

		<p itemprop="description">“There. Yes. Those two.” Excitement, wet and thick, curdled Chemurr’s voice. She coughed and swallowed noisily, but she was too agitated to keep the phlegm worms from crawling back up. Her swollen fingers clenched around Gaiter’s arm. “Come, boy.”</p> 
		<p>Gaiter pulled back. He knew it was stupid, dangerous. You didn’t annoy Chemurr ever, but especially not when she got like this. He hated the phlegm worms, though. Hated them too much to be smart, sometimes.</p>
		<p>“How—how do you know?” He made the question tremulous, fearful, hoping Chemurr would be satisfied enough with his terror that she wouldn’t demand more. It wasn’t a stretch. Gaiter really <i>was</i> frightened half out of his mind. “Did the Great Master tell you so?”</p>
		<p>“The Great Master doesn’t have to tell me that, boy.” Chemurr’s grip tightened with her scorn. Her fingers squelched against Gaiter’s bones. “I can smell it on them. The stink of delusion. Thinking that what they do <i>matters.</i>” Her nostrils flared, sniffing, and a phlegm worm dropped out.</p>
		<p>Gaiter flinched. He couldn’t help it. Nor could he help looking at the thing that squirmed across the cobblestones, fat and segmented and slimy, its skin whorled with runes that shimmered with greasy, unreal colors and made his eyes ache. He tore his gaze away, hastily, his eyes burning with tears.</p>
		<p>If the light had been better, he knew, he’d have been able to see a pink tinge on his fingers as he dashed those tears away. Blood. His eyes were filmed with it, just from a glimpse of a phlegm worm. A longer look, and he might have gone blind. Mad. Worse.</p>
		<p>It didn’t bear thinking about. Trying to ignore the grub, Gaiter studied the figures Chemurr had pointed out. There were two, cloaked and hooded despite the warmth of Egorian’s summer night. They moved quickly, but with a burdened caution that suggested they were carrying some fragile or heavy contraband beneath those cloaks.</p>
		<p>He couldn’t smell anything from them, but that wasn’t a surprise. The hooded figures were fifty feet away, and Chemurr and Gaiter were crowded into the recesses of a stinking, unlit alley, hidden by shadows and the Great Master’s magic. All he could smell was stale urine, rotting fish, and Chemurr’s thick breath, fouler than the rest.</p>
		<p>The hooded figures had stopped. The street around them was momentarily empty. Quickly, they tossed back their cloaks and drew out… a covered bucket and… paintbrushes? Gaiter squinted and leaned forward.</p>
		<p>One of them pulled a collapsible ladder from under his cloak, shimmying to the top and balancing with impressive dexterity as he painted a pair of silvery-blue crossed swords over a banner displaying the red-circled cross of Infernal Cheliax. The other held the paint bucket and dipped the brushes, handing them up to her partner.</p>
		<p>“Why, they’re rebels,” Gaiter blurted, too astonished to keep the thought to himself. He didn’t recognize the mark, but no one else would dare deface Imperial insignia. Rebels. In Egorian! Perhaps the devilers’ control wasn’t as absolute as he’d believed.</p>
		<p>“Rebels and devils, devils and rebels,” Chemurr crooned, as if she could read Gaiter’s thoughts. She gurgled a wet laugh, audibly swallowing another phlegm worm in the middle of it. “Yes. That’s all anyone thinks about here. They chase each other round and round, and everyone forgets about us. Just as the Great Master wants it. Oh—here come the devils now.”</p>
		<p>A Hellknight patrol had spotted the painters. They shouted a warning, made unnecessary by the clatter of their heavy spiked armor. As good as alarm bells, that armor. The rebels tossed their brushes aside, leaving a final swipe of blue across the defaced banner, jumped down from the ladder, and ran.</p>
		<div class="blurbCenter">

		</div> 
		<p>The Hellknights hadn’t a prayer of catching the light-footed vandals. Gaiter was astonished that they could run at all in that massive, spiked plate, let alone so quickly, but even so they were falling behind by the second.</p>
		<p>They knew it too. One of the Hellknights blew a carved bone whistle. The whistle was soundless, but the bone-prickling baying of hellhounds rang out in response. Three of the infernal beasts came rushing to join their armored masters, their fire-wreathed bodies swift and bright in Egorian’s dark night. They pursued the fleeing rebels relentlessly, gaining ground as quickly as the Hellknights had lost it.</p>
		<p>“Now,” Chemurr hissed as soon as the Hellknights were past their alley.</p>
		<p>“Now?” Gaiter balked again. Twice in the same night. He really was tempting fate, pushing back on Chemurr like this.</p>
		<p>But the Hellknights were still in sight—they’d only have to turn around to spot him—and he’d seen what the Chelaxians did to the Great Master’s servants. Despite everything else Gaiter had seen, everything else he’d <i>done</i>, those screams stayed with him. There was a reason they’d stayed out of Thrune lands so long. The devilers could be as cruel as the Great Master himself, and their questions were as sharp as their knives.</p>
		<p><i>“Now.”</i> Chemurr’s fingers tightened so hard on Gaiter’s arm that one of them burst, soaking his sleeve with wriggling slime. “While the rebels and the devils are distracted with each other. Or do you not wish to accomplish our Great Master’s work?”</p>
		<p>Gaiter swallowed, nodded, and ran.</p>
		<p>Darting up the ladder that the rebels had left behind, Gaiter swept one of the discarded brushes across the blue swords, working the changes he’d seen in his dreams. Subtle alterations made more so by the Great Master’s will. A curl here, a swish in the brush texture that suggested an almost-word there, a fold between the overlapping red and blue that suggested some <i>other</i> color, an un-combination, an unraveling of the others that allowed a tiny, tantalizing glimpse beyond their mundane reality.</p>
		<p>He climbed down. Sweat soaked his shirt. That was bloody too, just as his tears had been before. He could smell the meat-and-iron taint of it. The Great Master’s presence was too terrible for his poor mortal servants to withstand.</p>
		<p>“Good.” Chemurr stood at the base of the ladder, looking up with satisfaction. Her hood had fallen back a bit, showing a bit of her face.</p>
		<p>Gaiter swallowed again, shuddering. The Great Master’s presence was terrible indeed.</p>
		<p>“Will it… catch the Hellknights?” He wasn’t sure whether to dread or hope for that. The snare he’d woven felt too fragile to catch a will like theirs.</p>
		<p>“No.” Chemurr’s snort was choked by another worm. “Those mighty knights don’t scrub vandals’ paint themselves. They’ll send slaves. Halflings. The resentful, the powerless. Fertile soil for the Great Master’s secrets to seed. But…” She trailed off. The silence stretched into squirming discomfort.</p>
		<p>Suddenly Chemurr’s hand shot out. Her fingers squelched around Gaiter’s face, muffling his screams even as they pried his jaw open. The swollen pustules in her palm split open, filling his mouth with the wet slurry of her dissolving humanity and with phlegm worms.</p>
		<p>They poured into him. Writhing, biting, burning, <i>melting.</i> Gaiter felt his throat corrode into red melt, and then he was swallowing that too, desperately, trying to keep from drowning in his own dying flesh. His legs swelled together and burst, puddling into slurry as the worms coursed through the liquefaction and smeared it like ink across the ground.</p>
		<p>And then he couldn’t feel anything. He could still hear and could see the banners that his eyes had fixed upon before they’d stopped moving or blinking, but he felt nothing. Only dread, and a last distant knot of pain somewhere in his chest, aching as it faded. His heart, maybe. His soul, before the phlegm worms ate it.</p>
		<p>Chemurr laughed. She was licking her palm to seal it up again. A sound he knew too well. “Traitor boy. Did you think the Great Master couldn’t sniff out your delusions, too? That you would escape. That you would <i>repent.</i> No matter. Even the disloyal are useful. The Hellknights don’t come to study vandals’ banners. But they’ll come for you. And the snare <i>you</i> are—well, you might catch one.</p>
		<p>“Rebels and devils, devils and rebels. Playing their little games while the Great Master laughs.” Chemurr crooned, softly, as the last of Gaiter’s sight and hearing melted into roaring black and whirling, poisoned stars. Not death. Not peace. An infinity of rushing madness, a fall that never ended. And Chemurr’s voice, and the phlegm worms, forever. “While the Great Master laughs.”</p>

		<p>Good? Read on!</p>
		<p itemprop="description">When I first participated in Pathfinder Society, one of the selling points was that the Society was a league of archaeologists—just like me! Granted, the Pathfinders are sword-swinging, spell-slinging scallywags who tend not to show much respect for their host cultures, all while endeavoring to find the most exciting treasures in pursuit of fame and public acclaim. Fortunately, that’s not how real archaeologists behave, right?</p>
		<p>…Right?</p>
		<p>The answer’s complicated. While the fields of modern anthropology and archaeology have come a long way, there have been and still remain plenty of valid critiques. Anthropology students learn about the rather cavalier excavations of the 18th and 19th centuries (and in some cases into the 20th and even 21st centuries) that celebrated impressive finds while destroying irreparable context; the prejudiced lenses through which early, predominantly white, anthropologists studied unfamiliar cultures; and the ways in which biased studies and unrefined processes erased swaths of archaeological evidence, downplayed (or misinterpreted) other societies’ accomplishments, and shaped foreign perceptions and policies in a way that othered and hurt the people studied.</p>
		<p>Through exposure, we also learn to parse the ways in which popular culture like Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider highlight the destructive and treasure-hunting elements while largely ignoring the delicate research that forms the foundation of archaeology. This “pulp” archaeology is a mixed bag. On one hand it builds excitement for travel and archaeology. On the other hand, it glorifies the violence, looting, destruction, and egos that have caused so much damage. No matter how loudly one shouts “This belongs in a museum,” it won’t repair the wreckage a pulp archaeologist leaves in their wake.</p>
		<p>So that’s a lot of baggage tied up in anthropology, and by extension, that baggage is an element that the Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society alike inherit. When we tell stories about studying Thassilon, sneaking around the remains of Shory cities, or recovering a lost relic from Sarkorian ruins, we’re tapping into that same pulp archaeology context. And those are moments that invite self-reflection. Is my character understanding this culture filtered through the character’s (or my own) perspective? How does this unfamiliar culture view my daring swashbuckling deeds through their ancestral lands, and will my chronicle of this adventure feature my voice or theirs? Should I have cast fireball into that room decorated with millennia-old murals? And y’know, sometimes the answers are “But there were zombies” and “I’m an adventurer,” and one of the big reasons we play tabletop roleplaying games is to be awesome by using our PCs’ class abilities.</p>
		<p>As the lead on the organized play campaigns’ creative content, though, I’ve made it my business to weave in some of the big questions and controversies from the past centuries of anthropology. Fortunately, from a strictly narrative perspective, these questions and controversies make for some excellent stories; there’s little denying that pulp archaeology’s exciting. But the PCs’ actions also have consequences, and I do hope that the dilemmas we include in scenarios are an opportunity to empathize and tackle tough choices while in a safe environment. And at the end of the day, even if the in-world Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society aren’t good-aligned organizations, they sure as heck don’t surrender their moral compasses when in the field.</p>
		<p>And that’s the bet that Thurston Hillman and I took more than a year ago when we brainstormed <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-13: On the Trail of History.</em> The adventure involves the PCs traveling to a distant planet to solve an important mystery, and the investigation ultimately leads to contact with the planet’s native sapient life forms: izalguuns, six-limbed beings believed to be quite primitive and simple by the few scientists stationed on that world (and also izalguuns are appearing in the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-3">Starfinder Alien Archive 3</a>). But not only do the izalguuns have their secrets, but they also present a choice during the adventure.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Graey Erb</p>
		</div> 

		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Deeper spoilers and consequences for “On the Trail of History”]</summary>
			<p>The izalguuns are one of the species that left the Scoured Stars system untold generations ago, fleeing the supernatural force that inhabited that system. Although once very sophisticated technologically, the izalguuns settled on this new planet, purposefully chose to live simpler and more secretive lives, and now use their advanced technology in more subtle ways. While the izalguuns are amenable to helping the PCs solve the mystery that inspired the adventure in the first place, this people wish to live in peace and solitude.</p>
			<p>That creates quite the conundrum to academics like the Starfinders. On one hand, honoring the izalguuns’ wishes costs nothing. On the other hand, such an advanced and previously under-appreciated alien species represents a bonanza of academic renown for the enterprising ethnographers willing to publish their findings about the izalguuns anyway. At the end of the adventure, the PCs have to make that choice: respect or glory? If the PCs choose to respect the izalguuns’ wishes, that’s great, but choosing to out the izalguuns’ secret existence to the galaxy earns the PCs a special and lucrative boon on the scenario’s Chronicle sheet!</p>
			<p>So, the message is to…sell out foreign cultures for money and academic tenure?</p>
			<p>No. Choices have consequences, and scenarios have reporting notes. Remember those check boxes that the GM fills out when reporting played scenarios on paizo.com? We examine that data to help shape the campaign’s stories and future scenarios. When Thursty and I devised this scenario, we agreed that the izalguuns would make for a good playable PC race in Starfinder. I also convinced him that this would be a good opportunity to see whether the Starfinder Society would be as upstanding as First Seeker Luwzi Elsebo would hope.</p>
			<p>So, we formed a pact. In 2019 I would check the reporting data and write a blog about ethical anthropology and On the Trail of History. If the reporting data showed the Starfinders had revealed the izalguuns’ existence to the Pact Worlds in order to profit off the discovery, scores of academics would travel to that planet to study the izalguuns and violate the boundaries the izalguuns had established. The izalguuns would know that the Starfinder Society had betrayed their trust and forswear dealing with the Society ever again. On the other hand, if the Starfinders respected the izalguuns’ wishes, there may come a time that their more adventurous kin would want to explore the galaxy and join the same organization that showed such integrity before.</p>
		</details></p>

		<p>That’s right: the reporting data would determine whether or not izalguuns would ever be a playable race in Starfinder Society.</p>

		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[The Results]</summary>
			<p>You made us proud.</p>
			<p>A very clear majority of groups reported respecting the izalguuns’ wishes by keeping their culture and technology a secret. More than a year later, the first izalguuns have traveled to Absalom Station in the wake of the Society’s victory at the Scoured Stars, and these aliens are joining the Starfinders ranks even now.</p>	
			<p>Beginning on August 28th, the street date for <i>Starfinder Alien Archive 3,</i> izalguuns will be an always-available playable race in the Starfinder Society campaign! As always, you’ll need a copy of the book in which they appear, as they’ll be appearing in the Additional Resources list.</p>
			<p>And to answer a likely question: yes, this is the type of event we might repeat in the future, but probably not for a while longer, and probably even then it would take a slightly different form. Does that mean you should be exuberantly ethical in all of your choices in Starfinder Society? Certainly my inner anthropologist would love that, but I encourage you to play awesome characters of diverse backgrounds and with diverse perspectives because that’s part of what makes the game fun.</p>
		</details></p>

		<p>Over the course of the Starfinder Society campaign, the team’s enjoyed including more opportunities to review reporting data, incorporate players’ ideas and PCs into the stories, and overall encourage a more “living campaign” feel. Seeing this particular story to its conclusion has been especially exciting, and we’re equally excited to consider how your choices in this adventure might affect future scenarios.</p>
		<p>If you’re interested in exploring more archaeological themes and controversies, I encourage you to check out the following adventures. Their spoiler tags include modest spoiler information, so peek at your own risk!</p>

		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-14: Faithless and Forgotten, Part 2: Lost Colony of Taldor]</summary>
			<p>This scenario tackles the way in which nation states have sometimes used archaeology—either by funding expeditions or by creatively interpreting independent findings—to reinforce their own dominance or historical narratives. Cheliax hopes that the Pathfinders will conclude the adventure site was once a Taldan colony, reinforcing Cheliax’s claim to the surrounding territory.</p>
		</details></p>

		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Pathfinder Society Special #8-99: The Solstice Scar]</summary>
			<p>This story’s premise begins with a “civilized” expedition stealing a sacred relic, believing it more important that the relic be kept in a museum rather than remaining in the hands of its “primitive” creator culture.</p>
		</details></p>

		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-08: Birthright Betrayed]</summary>
			<p>Calhadion Vernisant’s leveraging historical connections to fuel his own political career is less immediately archaeological but is nonetheless an illustration of how underhanded individuals can reinterpret and re-present the past in order to further a modern agenda.</p>
		</details></p>

		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Pathfinder Society Special #10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm]</summary>
			<p>One of the tough realities of archaeology—and to an extent anthropology as a whole—is that ancient sites don’t always wait around to be found. When a large building project or impending environmental shift means that an area might never again be accessible, it calls for salvage archaeology: a speedy triage of the sites and accelerated excavation to recover and preserve as much information about the doomed sites as possible. In the case of the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane, the whole place is quickly collapsing, and part of Season 10 is based on the principles of salvage archaeology.</p>
		</details></p>

		
		<p><details>
			<summary style=“font-weight: bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-14: Debt to the Quah]</summary>
			<p>No matter how professional the organization, there are invariably some bad actors. This adventure addresses the academic and ethical abuses performed by a Pathfinder in Varisia. His destructive exploration, desecration of bodies, and outright misrepresentation of the culture that built the site in question haven’t just wrecked an important tomb; he’s also threatened future expeditions by offending the local cultures. And like in the real world, someone has to repair those bridges and offer reparations.</p>

<p itemprop="description">We're only a few short weeks away from Gen Con, the release of Pathfinder's Second Edition opening books, and the launch of the new Pathfinder Society campaign! Phew! In the coming weeks we'll be previewing scenarios, pregenerated characters, the Guide, but today we're going to talk about one of the final character creation elements.

</p> 
 
<p>
But there are two special considerations in building your Pathfinder Society character. One of them is factions, which we've described in numerous earlier blogs (check out <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/organizedPlay">the three faction previews from May and June</a>). Just as in Starfinder Society, adventuring earns your PC Reputation (which unlocks potential rewards) and Fame (which lets you purchase those rewards). Collectively, these grant your PC an extra edge.
</p> 
 
<p>
And today we're going to address the other feature: training.
</p> 
 
<p>
Published well before I started work at Paizo, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8az2?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Seekers-of-Secrets-A-Guide-to-the-Pathfinder-Society">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Seekers of Secrets</a> has always served as one of the foundational lore resources for the team, from understanding the in-world Society's role to getting a sense of where there are Pathfinder lodges. It also introduces the three deans of the Pathfinder Society—Kreighton Shaine, the Master of Scrolls; Aram Zey, the Master of Spells (since replaced by Sorrina Westyr); and Marcos Farabellus, the Master of Swords—each of who play a role in training initiates for the rigors of the adventuring world. <em>Seekers of Secrets</em> helpfully explains how the Scrolls lessons feature translation and insight, the Spells focus on understanding and surviving magical threats, and the Swords involves a mix of athleticism, combat fundamentals, and spelunking basics. However, we've just never been terribly clear about what's involved in the deans' oversight, what role the three “schools” play in an established field agent's exploits, or whether any of that reflects on the gameplay experience. In designing the Second Edition organized play experience, we wanted to change that.
</p> 
 
<p>
When you build a player character in the Second Edition Pathfinder Society campaign, you'll have three points to distribute between the three schools, representing how much your PC focused on those school's curricula while training as an initiate. Each point you invest in a school gives a small benefit that's relevant throughout your character's entire career, representing not only the lessons you learned but also the life-long professional contacts you made during that time. 
</p> 
 
<p>
If you'd like to assign one point to each school, you'll receive fairly balanced benefits. This choice opens access to a bunch of options and represents having a Pathfinder with a well-rounded education.  If you relish the idea of a more focused character, even mixing unlikely class-school combinations like a barbarian with 3 points in Spells, consider spending your points on just one or two schools. You can easily assign two points to Scrolls and one to Spells, or you could pile all three into Swords. It's your call! 
</p> 
 
<p>
Just what does your Pathfinder training provide? The core mechanic is access to consumable items. These represent colleagues' experimental draughts, tools provided by the Grand Lodge, or additional gear loaned out by a venture-captain from their own inventories. Just after the mission briefing, you'll be able to requisition one consumable item for use during the adventure. If you don't use it by the end of the adventure, your character returns it. As to what consumable items can you acquire - that depends on your school.
</p> 
 
<p>
<strong>1 Point:</strong> By investing 1 point in a school, you have access to that school's item list, and at every odd-numbered level, more options become available for each school. In addition, everyone has access to a list of basic healing and bomb options (a bomb refers to the classic “splash” weapons like alchemist's fire and acid flasks). The starting options for these appear later in this blog.
</p> 
 
<p>
<strong>2 Points:</strong> By investing a second point in a school, the PC begins with a bonus Lore skill from a list tied to the school. At 5th level, the PC also gains a bonus skill feat from a list tied to that school, representing the PC's ongoing training.
</p> 
 
<p>
<strong>3 Points:</strong> By investing all three points in a school, the PC gains a second consumable item at the start of the adventure, though the bonus item's level must be half the PC's level or lower.
</p> 
 
<p>
Let's take a look at what consumable items are available at 1st level for each school.
</p> 
 
<p>
<strong>All Schools (1):</strong> <em>holy water</em>, lesser [bomb], lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, <emsminor healing </em>potion<br />
<strong>Scrolls (1):</strong> <em>feather token (ladder), lesser eagle-eye charm, owlbear charm,</em> sunrod, <em>wolf fang</em><br />
<strong>Spells (1):</strong> a scroll with one of the following 1st-level spells: <em>burning hands, charm, fear, harm, heal, mage armor, magic fang, magic missile, magic weapon,</em> or <em>soothe</em>.<br />
<strong>Swords (1):</strong> lesser leaper's elixir, <em>potency crystal</em>, <em>shining ammunition</em>
</p> 
 
<p>
When in doubt, you can always choose a healing potion, but having some extra school support means you're more likely to have access to the perfect tool for the job. In return, it's assumed that your PC spends some of their downtime assisting their colleagues in a similar way, whether that's mixing up alchemical elixirs, helping repair a lodge, assisting an old friend from back when you were both initiates together, or mentoring the next generation of explorers. Pay it forward.
</p> 
 
<p>
What about if you don't care about the training system? No problem—we asked ourselves the same question when first brainstorming this system, and we realized that we could also address one of the other less-explored aspects of the Pathfinder Society: field-commissioned agents. These are the explorers who have already made a name for themselves by the time they cross paths with the Society and for whom a venture-captain chooses to waive the traditional three years of training before sponsoring that adventurer to join the Pathfinders. A field-commissioned agent (i.e. a PC who invests none of those three points in any schools) lacks the deep collegial relationships that a formally trained Pathfinder enjoys, and that's represented as restricted access to those free consumable items. On the other hand, those agents don't have nearly the same obligations as the other Pathfinders, and that means field-commissioned agents earn more Downtime per level than other PCs. 
</p> 
 
<p>
And if being a field-commissioned agent really fits your backstory, but you'd like to use the training points (or maybe your agent was classically trained but eschews assisting colleagues and ignores the training system), that's cool, too. The training system's a bonus to provide your character tools to survive whatever the adventuring life throws their way, not to tie your hands as to the stories you can tell. We're looking forward to seeing it in action, and we're looking forward to seeing many of you at Gen Con!
</p>

 </p>
 
 <p>Outer Gods? Vile cults? Formless evil? Sign me up! I was overjoyed to create the cosmic horror of this adventure and add to the pantheon of inscrutable and all-consuming entities lurking beyond space and time. This particular evil entity, known to some occultists as the Incandescent Doom, is a being of light that burns away life, of brilliance that scours flesh and warps minds. What better place to anchor such a being than a lightless oubliette in the depths of the sun? Of course, the heroes receive a less than pleasant welcome when they journey to this isolated location. </p>

<p>This adventure is for 7th-level characters, and introduces several new monsters such as the pyric revenant and the dimensional shambler. This volume also presents a catalogue of bizarre gear and strange artifacts, an in-depth look at several cults of the galaxy and those who hunt them, and much more. </p>

  <h1>Old Cheliax</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2019-07-16T22:00:00Z">Jul 16, 2019, 03:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">In the history of Golarion, no empire has reached the heights of influence nor seen that influence ripped away by revolutionaries and anarchists than Cheliax—at least if modern accounts of Chelish history are to be believed. But in today’s Cheliax, ruled by Her Infernal Majestrix, Queen Abrogail II of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune, the truth is malleable and is often altered to support the reigning regime rather than objective fact. From the outside, Cheliax appears as a failing state, whose territories have slipped through its fingers in the wake of decades of tyrannical rule by devil-worshipping nobles more concerned with their own power than the plight of their people, an empire in decline despite its own claims to the contrary.

<p>At the heart of the Old Cheliax meta-region is Cheliax itself. Two recent revolutions (one successful, the other not so much) within their borders have shown the people the precarious position their government and aristocracy find themselves in. In response to growing anti-Thrune sentiment, the infernal agents of the throne have redoubled their efforts to stamp out any discord and promote the propagandic party line of both House Thrune and the church of Asmodeus. Despite this, the downtrodden and abused commoners of Cheliax know of the success of the Silver Ravens in Ravounel and of the folly of mounting an overt assault on House Thrune as the Glorious Reclamation attempted to do, and they have adapted. With the help of the Firebrands and allied organizations like the Twilight Talons of Andoran and the halfling abolitionists of the Bellflower Network, small cells of dissenting Chelish revolutionaries are gaining a foothold in the deep shadows. Will the agents of the crown, the Hellknights sworn to maintain law and order, and the Asmodean church be enough to put out any new sparks of freedom that may take light in the dry kindling of the authoritarian regime?</p>

<p>The successful revolution that has so effectively inspired the people of Cheliax to consider alternatives to the status quo is that of Ravounel. Formerly a Chelish archduchy, Ravounel began its struggle for sovereignty in 4716 AR behind the revolutionaries of Kintargo known as the Silver Ravens. At the same time, the Iomedaen crusaders of the Glorious Reclamation attacked Cheliax in Westcrown far to the south. Its armies and resources split between the two fronts, Cheliax could only win one war, and in 4717 House Thrune was forced to recognize Ravounel’s independence. Today, Ravounel’s focus is on building the foundation of a stable government to last for generations to come and establishing trade with its neighbors along Avistan and Garund’s western coasts.</p>

<p>Aside from Cheliax, Ravounel shares a border with the shadow-shrouded nation of Nidal—the oldest continuous nation state in the entire region. Founded by followers of Zon-Kuthon emboldened during the Age of Darkness, the isolationist nation is ruled by a secret cabal of shadowcasters known as the Black Triune. During the period of Chelish expansion known as the Everwar, Cheliax formally annexed Nidal, though the latter never truly ceded its independence to Chelish rule. Instead, the Black Triune maintained near total control of the shadowy nation by Chelish grace. Even under control of House Thrune, Nidal has been left largely to its own devices, though the common ground between Zon-Kuthon’s and Asmodeus’s faiths have strengthened the nations’ alliance.</p>

<p>In Isger, to Cheliax’s northeast, however, things are not so cordial. Isger is a vassal in every form of the word, with its ruler, Hedvend VI little more than a thrall under Abrogail’s iron rule. Despite its close ties to Cheliax, Isger gets little benefit from its powerful liege state’s influence, instead sending its resources to Cheliax with little in return. This dynamic was never more evident than two decades ago, when the goblins of Isger’s Chitterwood, under hobgoblin commanders, attacked much of the unprotected countryside surrounding the forest. During the ensuing Goblinblood Wars, the armies not only of Cheliax but Andoran and Druma had to come to the Isgeri’s aid, and casualties were high on both sides. Even 20 years on, Isger is still recovering from the bloody conflict, but a glimmer of hope has arisen, for among the surviving goblins, a new alliance of likeminded tribes has begun reaching out to the local human population in the hopes of preventing future conflicts between goblinoids and other ancestries from causing the same level of devastation. And with the undead threat around Lake Encarthan growing, the Isgeri largely welcome any allies they can get as their government largely ignores their needs in order to lick their Chelish masters’ boots.</p>

<p>Players hailing from or adventuring in the region can look forward to seven new backgrounds such as Chelish rebel, Goblinblood orphan, or Thrune loyalist, as well as the Hellknight Armiger archetype, which allows members of all classes to begin their journey as a keeper of law and order as early as 2nd level! Look for a new piece of horror-tinged flash fiction from Liane Merciel later this week as the Tales of Lost Omens series continues. Next week we’ll venture to one of Cheliax’s more distant former holdings, the frontier region of Varisia and its larger meta-region of the Saga Lands.</p>

<p itemprop="description">You've created your character. You've tasted that first bite of toil and heroics, earned your first thousand Experience Points, and come back to town a hero. Is it time to hang up the sword, sidle into the local tavern, and get free drinks for years in return for spinning yarns of your youthful adventuring day? </p>

<p>
Hell no. It's time to level up your character so you can do it all again! 
</p>

<p>
This week we're going to examine how you advance your characters in Pathfinder. We are going to start with your young fighter who resists the urge to retire and sit on his laurels and instead decides that adventuring is his jam. Let's start by advancing the hero of our story—a human (skilled) fighter, with the nomad background. Let's call him Kaliban.
</p>



<h2>First Steps</h2>

<p>Each time you gain a new level, there're a few things you're going to want to do first. First, you're going to increase your level by one and subtract 1,000 Experience Points (XP) for your XP total. Then you're going to increase your Hit Points by the amount determined by class and then add your Constitution modifier. 
</p>

<p>
Kaliban is a fighter, so his Hit Points increase by 10 + his Constitution bonus (let's say he has Con 14) so his total Hit Points at 2nd level become 32. 
</p>

<p>
Lastly, you're going to take a look at your class progression table and apply any class features that aren't feat choices, ability boosts, or skill increases. We'll take a closer look at that later, at 3rd level when Kaliban gains the bravery class feature, but at 2nd level, Kaliban gains a fighter feat and a skill feat as class features, so we are going to move on to the next step. 
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-fighteradv.jpg" alt="Table 3-12: FIGHTER ADVANCEMENT. Column 1: Your Level. Column 2: Class Features. 1 | Ancestry and background, initial proficiencies, attack of opportunity, fighter feat, shield block. 2 | Fighter feat, skill feat. 3| Bravery, general feat, skill increase." style="padding-bottom: 20px;" />
</div>

<h2>Choose Your Feats</h2>

<p>In terms of pure role and effectiveness oomph, choosing a new class feat is often the most exciting choice you can make when advancing your character. First off, let's assume that during character creation Kaliban had already taken Power Attack.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-powerattack.jpg" alt="Power attack. Two actions. Feat 1. Fighter. Flourish. You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice." style="padding-bottom: 20px;" />
</div>

<p>Kaliban likes power. And Power Attack allows Kaliban to deal even more damage with his favorite weapon—a maul. At 2nd level, he could continue on this punishing path by taking the Brutish Shove fighter feat, which allows him to throw his enemies around the battlefield.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-brutishshove.jpg" alt="Brutish Shove. One action. Feat 2. Fighter. Press. Requirements: You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon.  Description: Throwing your weight behind your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you have a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically Shove it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn’t trigger reactions.  This Strike has the following failure effect: The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn." style="padding-bottom: 20px;" />
</div>

<p>This seems like the obvious choice, but let's imagine Kaliban is not your typical fighter. He's a particularly smart fellow (Intelligence 14). Let's also imagine that during his first adventure, he came across a frightfully competent gnoll evoker who gave Kaliban and his companions a tough time of it. And during that encounter, while taking the abuse that gnoll was dishing out, Kaliban wondered what it would be like to mix martial prowess with that kind of arcane might. Lucky for Kaliban, once he reaches 2nd level, the fighter has the opportunity to grow in a different direction. He can choose to multiclass.
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-wizarddedication.jpg" alt="Wizard Dedication. Feat 2. Archetype. Dedication. Multiclass. Prerequisites: Intelligence 14. Description: You cast spells like a wizard, gaining a spell book with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spell book. You’re trained in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs.Your key spell casting ability for wizard archetype spells is Int, and they are arcane wizard spells. You become trained in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. Special: You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wizard archetype." style="padding-bottom: 20px;" />
</div>

<p>It's not a bad deal. A spellbook with four cantrips, the ability to prepare two of them a day, and training in Arcana strikes the fighter as more promising than just pushing around his enemies. Some fighters might scoff at such dalliance, but Kaliban decides to go the fighter/wizard route. Taking a quick look at the arcane cantrips, he chooses to scribble daze, mage hand, shield, and telekinetic projectile in his spellbook. Most adventuring days, he typically leans on shield and telekinetic projectile as his prepared cantrips.</p>

<p>After picking his class feat, Kaliban picks a skill feat. He has training in the following skills: Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Crafting, Desert Lore, Intimidation, Nature, Society, Stealth, and Survival, so he has a lot of choices. But let's say Kaliban has become enamored with his brief magical studies and chooses Arcane Sense.
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-arcanesense.jpg" alt="Arcane Sense. Feat 1. General. Skill. Prerequisites: trained in Arcana. Description: Your study of magic allows you to instinctively sense its presence. You can cast 1st-level *detect magic* at will as an arcane innate spell. If you’re a master in Arcana, the spell is heightened to 3rd level; if you’re legendary, it is heightened to 4th level." style="padding-bottom: 20px;" />
</div>

<p>This way Kaliban can always be on the lookout for more magic to supplement his spellbook, equipment, and his split aspirations. 
</p>

<p>
With his skill feat chosen, all he has to do is adjust his various skills, attack rolls, and DCs to reflect his increased level and new bonuses, and he is done. He has everything he needs to continue adventuring with more than a few new tricks up his sleeve.
</p>

<h2>Each New Level, Repeat</h2>

<p>Each time you gain a level, the method by which you increase your level stays the same. Only the details and choices change. To make it easy for you to remember what you need to do each level, there's a bullet-point list on page 31 of the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook. Follow those directions each level, and you'll be set.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-levelingupchecklist.jpg" alt="Leveling-up Checklist. Every time you gain a level, make sure you do each of the following: 
- Increase your level by 1 and subtract 1,000 XP from your XP total.
- Increase your maximum Hit Points by the amount listed in your class entry in Chapter 3. 
Add class features from your class advancement table, including ability boosts and skill increases.
- Select feats as indicated on your class advancement table. For ancestry feats, see Chapter 2. For class feats, see your class entry in Chapter 3. For general feats and skill feats, see Chapter 5. 
- Add spells and spell slots if your class grants spell casting. See Chapter 7 for spells.
- Increase all of your proficiency bonuses by 1 from your new level, and make other increases to your proficiency bonuses as necessary from skill increases or other class features. 
- Increase any other statistics that changed as a result of ability boots or other abilities.
- Adjust bonuses from feats and other abilities that are based on your level." style="padding-bottom: 30px;"/>
</div>



<p>When Kaliban reaches 3rd level, even though he's multiclassed into wizard, he is still primarily a fighter, and he is going to advance as a 3rd-level fighter. He'll gain 12 more Hit Points (bringing his total to 44) and get the bravery class feature, along with a general feat and a skill increase. First, let's take a look at bravery.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-bravery.jpg" alt="Bravery. 3rd.
Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.  In addition, any time you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1." style="padding-bottom: 20px;" />
</div>

<p>While Kaliban is trained in Will saving throws, during character creation he chose to boost Intelligence instead of Wisdom, so bravery is going to be a big help. At second level his Will saving throw was +4. Thanks to bravery it jumps up to a +7 while granting him some extra protection against fear effects.
</p>

<p>
The skill increase allows him to either become trained in a new skill or to become an expert in a skill he's already trained in. Kaliban has a pretty robust set of skills, especially for a fighter, so he is going to invest the skill increase in raising one of his skills to expert proficiency. Since he's been focusing many of his build resources into his magical training, this time he'll use his skill training to become an expert in Athletics.
</p>

<p>
What about that general feat? Well, it just so happens that Magical Crafting pops up at 2nd level, so maybe Kaliban can find a way to increase his power in the magical arts after all.
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-presto.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-presto_500.jpeg" alt="A female elf in studded dark red armor is shown in active battle in the woods, dark old trees looming in the background and thick vines up to her knees. She has long, flowing white hair and a dark green gem in the middle of her forehead.

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Matteo Spirito</p></div>

<h2>Only the Beginning</h2>

<p>In the end, each level that you attain increases your ability to customize your character. We only completed two levels of Kaliban's advancement, and he has made many exciting and diverse choices, most of which were out of the ordinary. Not only does the fighter have an abundance of choice with just fighter class feats, but by taking dedication feats to multiclass or take on an archetype, the fighter increases the number and variety of choices available to him at each new level. Add to that further customization through skill advancement, general feats (skill and otherwise), and ancestry feats gained after 1st level, and at every level your adventurer becomes a unique legend sure to leave a mark on your campaign's story and the world of Pathfinder.</p>

 </p> 
 </div>

<p>Hello again, everyone! It's your mostly-fearless-except-for-fear-of-falling-from-heights Venture Captain for online Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, Tyler!</p>


<p>
I had a blast at PaizoCon, and we got LOADS of new information from Paizo on the release of the <a href=https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set>Core Set</a> and the <a href=https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a> (both available now), on the new Year of Rotting Ruins that begins at Gen Con, and on the fact that the Core and Curse scenarios in the storybooks that come in the box are sanctioned for PACS play! I also want to give a quick plug for the current online PACS play-by-post convention, <a href=https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42l1o?Announcing-Player-Recruitment-for-Cards>Cards Against Gnomanity II</a>. Though the event has already begun, we'd love to have you join us for future games, so if you just tell us in the recruitment thread that you're interested, we can help you find a game—even if you've never played PACS through play-by-post!
</p>

<p>
Mostly, though, I want to talk to you a bit about something that I spent several months working on leading up to PaizoCon, and then spent most of my actual time at PaizoCon running: this year's homebrew special, entitled "I Want My Mummy!"
</p>

<p>
This set of three adventures was designed to run during three afternoon sessions at PaizoCon. We decided this year to do Tier 1, Tier 3, and Tier 5 so that people got a broader taste of the characters. The story is based on some of the most popular PFS scenarios from WAAAY back in season 5: <a href=https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-12-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-1-A-Bitter-Bargain>the Destiny<a> <a href=https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-15-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-2-Race-to-Seekers-Folly>of the Sands</a> <a href=https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-16-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-3-Sanctum-of-the-Sages>trilogy</a>. This means that your kobold characters (new versions of the infamous kobolds from <a href=https://paizo.com/products/btpy9cu6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-99-True-Dragons-of-Absalom>True Dragons of Absalom</a>) get to interact with everyone's favorite creepy dude in a hot tub, Grandmaster Torch. He'll send your kobolds on a grand adventure to… do a bunch of seemingly mundane tasks for him, as is tradition. 
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Grandmaster Torch, the guy everyone loves to hate. One of his requested tasks is to harass the owner of a legitimate cabaret hall and her elemental buddies.</p>
</div> 

<p>That's okay though; you're well aware that Torch doesn't always have the interests of the Pathfinder Society at heart, and you will get the chance to disrupt his plans several times. Along the way, you'll also be able to use the fun trap-setting mechanic that we introduced back in our first kobold-themed homebrew special, <a href=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk9g?Homebrew-Special-The-Little-Dragons-That-Could>"We Are Dragons"</a>. There are several ways to set traps, one of which is represented by the kobold Alchemist, Athrax:</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190712-athrax.jpg" width="300" alt="Adventure Card Game card: Athrax. Male Kobold Alchemist.

- After you play an Alchemical card for its power, you may set a trap with it (checkbox then heal a random Alchemical card).
- Checkbox. When you examine a card at a trapped location, you may bury one of those traps to ignore Trigger effects on the examined card." />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190712-athrax2.jpg" width="300"  alt="Card List. Favored Card Type: Weapon.

Athrax’s greatest joy in life is the sound of his explosives detonating, and the ensuing cries of anguish from his mutilated victims. Since learning about the Pathfinder Society, he has made it his mission to become a member, and likes to ‘Explore, Report, and Cooperate’ by exploring new ways of creating explosions, reporting his horrific findings in his journal, and cooperating by following the orders of chief Yiddlepode.’" />

Gain the skills Craft: Intelligence +2 and Survival: Intelligence +1." /><br />
<p style="font-size: 13px;">The kobold Alchemist, Athrax. There's no "n" in there… read it again, I promise you it's true.</p>
</div> 

<p>
As you can see from his character and role cards, Athrax uses the trap-setting mechanic to keep from banishing his Alchemical items. He also has a few spells, but he just straight-up banishes those, so it's best to keep things like Cure and Find Traps in those slots, which can be useful one-shots. Athrax also has a useful way of ignoring Triggers, by setting traps and then examining locations. Sometimes it's more than worth a buried card to ignore a Trigger.
</p>

<p>
In brief, trapsetting works like this: When you set a trap with a card, you display that card next to your location (we played them facedown at PaizoCon because we had different-colored sleeves for each character, which helps determine who set the trap initially). When a monster is encountered at a trapped location, the trap is sprung, and you get to add 1d6 to all checks against that monster for the encounter. 
</p>

<p>
After Adventure 1, we skip ahead to Adventure 3, where you're in hot pursuit of two Aspis agents who have gotten hold of one of the fabled Sage Gems, mythical gems that hold the power of the Jeweled Sages inside them. Several of the scenarios in this adventure allow you to gain Chase Points for finishing quickly, culminating in a scenario where you're literally chasing the Aspis agents along a set of locations, trying to move quickly to the place where another Sage Gem is likely to be found. Once you arrive, you find many dangers, the worst of which is the deadly Sage of Plagues, who has one of the most diabolical powers I've ever written. When you defeat him, he explodes in necromantic energy, shattering the Ruby Sage Gem… but even shards of such a powerful relic have the ability to grant incredible abilities to those wielding them. 
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190712-sageofplagues.jpg" alt="Adventure Card Game card: Sage of Plagues. Villain 3. Undead. Incorporeal. Poison. 
Type: Monster. Check to defeat. Combat 20. Powers: If the check to defeat does not have the Magic trait, the Sage of Plagues is undefeated. After you act, if the check to defeat exceeded the difficulty by 5 or more, suffer the scourge Curse of Poisoning, then suffer the scourge Curse of Poisoning, then suffer the scourge Curse of Poisoning, then move to a random location." />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190712-rubygempiece.jpg" alt="Adventure Card Game card: Ruby Gem Piece. Loot 3. Object. Magic. Mythic. 
Type: Item. Powers: When you encounter this card, display it next to a character who does not already have one displayed. That character gains a mythic path of her choice and displays it, and gains # mythic charges. While displayed during your turn, you may expend a mythic charge to explore." /><br />
<p style="font-size: 13px;">The Sage of Plagues makes you so poisoned that you can barely hold onto any of the items you've been carrying. At least you gain some extraordinary abilities out of the deal, right?</p>
</div> 

<p>Finally, in Adventure 5, you've got a chance to really make use of your new mythic abilities, going up against some truly terrifying mythic foes. You even have the chance to fight the diamond sage, Tahonikepsu herself, whose powers as a time dragon are nothing to sneeze at. Check out her character card below, and keep in mind this scenario power that is in effect when you encounter her: "At the beginning of your turn, expend a mythic charge or uncheck a skill or power feat from your character or role card; If you can do neither, bury 1d4 cards from your hand and 1d4 cards from your discard pile."
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">

Type: Monster. Check to defeat. Combat 26. Powers: Immune to Mental and Poison. Before you act, succeed at a Wisdom or Perception 13 check or suffer 1d4+1 Combat damage. If the check to defeat does not have the Magic trait, increase the difficulty by 5. If undefeated, bury your discard pile." />

While you act, when any character would play a spell, roll 1d4; on 1, ignore the spell’s powers and that character buries it, and the difficulty to defeat is increased by 4. If undefeated, discard the top 1d4 cards from your deck and suffer the scourge Curse of Poisoning." />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190712-tahonikepsu.jpg" alt="Adventure Card Game card: Tahonikepsu. Villain 6. Dragon. Sorcerer. Mythic.
Type: Monster. Check to defeat. Combat 60 OR Diplomacy 40 THEN Combat 70 OR Diplomacy 50. Powers: When encountered, shuffle the blessings deck, then advance the blessings deck. Before you act, succeed at an Intelligence, Arcane, Wisdom, or Divine 20 check or recharge all Magic cards from your hand.  During the encounter, before you play a card, each other character at the location recharges a card." /><br />
<p style="font-size: 13px;">The Diamond Sage Tahonikepsu, a mythic time dragon sorcerer who does NOT play around.</p>

<p>
This time, I'm not JUST going to tell you all about these fun scenarios… I'm going to make them available to everyone! See the Dropbox link below to download the character sheets, custom cards, and adventure text for the I Want My Mummy adventure path. It could be a great set of scenarios to run in between regular adventures of the Mummy's Mask AP, or you could just run it on its own… just remember to level your characters up appropriately in between the adventures!

I'm working on an even <em>more</em> ambitious project for next year's PaizoCon, so stay tuned. Thanks for reading!</p>

</div>

<p>Here's the schedule (all times Pacific):</p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;">

So now that you've been playing your character, overcoming hazards, slaying monsters, and gaining experience throughout your adventures, how does leveling work? Senior Designer Stephen Radney-MacFarland will join me to elaborate on how your character concept can be brought up to the next level. How do you add skills and feats? Maybe you'd like to multiclass?  You don't want something generic, you want something that's uniquely your own. You're going to love the tremendous amount of customization and paths you have to explore during the leveling process!
</p> 

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p itemprop="description">Hadizah stood stiffly between two other students—one a degenerate lizardfolk and the other a savage Ekujae elf—as their frail teacher Mawunyo gestured with a staff at the vine-covered towers, graceful arches, and broad towers of the Magaambya, greatest magical academy in all of the Mwangi Expanse, if not the world.
        </p> 

<p>"You embark now on a life of study and service." Mawunyo's voice was rich and resonant despite his slender frame and reminded Hadizah uncomfortably of the ringing tones of the priests of the Deathless Child back home. "You have been chosen because we see great promise within you, passion and will, spirit and intellect, strength and judgment... and perhaps a few seeds of wisdom that might sprout and blossom if tended." The teacher's assistant Kweku chuckled, and Hadizah risked a glance at her. She'd been with Mawunyo for years, apparently, traveling with him to the far ends of the world (and even, some rumors said, beyond). Her robe's hem was spattered with mud and her hair was a thousand messy braids and an hour after meeting her Hadizah was more than halfway in love. Inconvenient.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190711-mwangiexpanse.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190711-mwangiexpanse_500.jpeg" alt="Several terraced buildings in the late afternoon sun, the light filtering down from the upper left. The buildings are surrounded by leafy trees and plants grow on the sides of the buildings and terraces. On the right, the terrace in front of a building is neatly manicured and has a small group of people in robes gathered. One holds a staff with a glowing red end up to the sky as the others look on. A cloaked, hooded person watches from the stairs leading up to the terrace." /></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski</p></div> 


<p>Mawunyo went on. "You come from different places, but you are all children of the Expanse, as am I. We are the successors and inheritors of Old-Mage Jatembe, who taught that those who use great magic bear great responsibility, and that we must use our knowledge to better the world. I do this by teaching such as you."        </p> 

<p>"And by beating demons to death with sticks," Kweku said.</p> 

<p>

Mawunyo shrugged his bony shoulders. "When I am abroad. As needed. With sticks made especially for the purpose." He thumped his staff, which hadn't previously struck Hadizah as particularly threatening, but now did. "We need no such weapons here. Nantambu the Song-Wind City is the safest place I have ever lived."</p> 

<p>

"So safe we leave sometimes just to feel the thrill of danger," Kweku said. </p> 

<p>
Mawuonyo took no notice. "Those who mean this city harm soon discover the folly of attacking a place hundreds of mages call home. No invader has needed to learn that lesson recently. This safety gives us the freedom to learn in peace. I am here to help discover how your talents might best serve the world." He leaned on his staff and gazed at each student in turn. The instructor's eyes seemed to penetrate Hadizah's soul. Hadizah hoped they couldn't. </p> 

<p>
The old man spoke. "Tell me: once you have attained the power of which you dream, what goals do you wish to achieve?"</p> 

<p>
The lizardfolk spoke slowly, with many words in a tongue Hadizah didn't know, but the gist seemed to be something about improving prospects for the females of its species. Perhaps it was female? Hadizah had no idea how to tell. Such creatures were not common back in Mzali. Then the elf spoke, something abstract about combining arcane and druidic arts to make an alloyed magic stronger and more flexible than either alone. Mawunyo and Kweku nodded along thoughtfully during these speeches, then turned their gazes to Hadizah.
</p> 

<p>
He straightened his spine and said, "I come from Mzali, home of the Deathless Child, who rules my people with fire and fear. Do you know the place?"
</p> 

<p>
"I have been there," Mawunyo said. "When it was a place of fading glory, before the child mummy Walkena woke and seized control. Not since."
</p> 

<p>
"Citizens are... not encouraged to leave," Hadizah said. "Walkena demands obedience and sacrifice, and his rule is cruel if you do not have his favor. There is a group, the Bright Lions, who seek to overthrow Walkena's rule and return control of the city to the living. The Lions discovered my interest in the arcane arts and offered to help me come here. They did this purely out of kindness... but I wish to return that kindness, and to turn whatever power I gain toward their cause. If left unchecked, Walkena will achieve his goal of uniting the whole of the Expanse under his burning banner. He would put even this place to the flame. I wish to prevent that."
</p> 

<p>
Mawunyo and Kweku nodded at that, just as they had at the ambitious proclamations of the other students, and deep in his hidden heart Hadizah relaxed. 
</p> 

<p>
"Take the afternoon to familiarize yourself with your living quarters," Mawunyo said, "and at least the immediate areas of the academy nearby. I will ponder what I know of your goals and resources, and tomorrow we will meet again to discuss the first steps of your studies." He turned and walked away, using the staff more as a prop than an aid to walking, it seemed to Hadizah. Perhaps he was less frail than he seemed.
</p> 

<p>
The group broke up, and Hazidah headed for his dormitory, wondering where he might find a place of privacy to record the day's events. Kweku fell into step beside him. "Mzali," she said. "You still have people there?"
</p> 

<p>
"I... not really, not anymore." He thought, briefly, of fire, and ashes, and stains on stones, but pushed those images away. Actions had consequences. He would make wiser choices than his parents and siblings had. "In a way, all the people in Mzali are my people, and deserve liberation." That sounded like something a friend of the Lions would say.
</p> 

<p>
"I'm sorry to hear that." She spun and started walking backwards so she could face him while she talked, effortlessly going up a set of stairs in reverse. "This place must be quite a change. Not just the change in architectural style, but all the different sorts of people, the music in the air, the absence of a pervasive atmosphere of terror...."
</p> 

<p>
"It is a... most refreshing change."
</p> 

<p>
Kweku nodded and preceded him through a wide and empty plaza. "I wanted to mention, there's a small but dedicated group here studying the problem of your Deathless Child Walkena. I know some people on it—there's even a Tempest-Sun Mage among them. Maybe you'd like to be introduced?"
</p> 

<p>
Hazidah hesitated. He didn't know if he'd been sent to this place on orders directly from the child-god Walkena himself, as the priest who'd recruited him claimed, or if he was part of that priest's own pet project, but either way, his mission was both simple and dauntingly complex: find out the weaknesses of the academy, and discover how the mages here would deal with an invasion from Mzali, so the Deathless Child might better counter their plans. Being part of a group specifically addressing the threat of Walkena would be perfect for gathering such information, but it might also expose him to greater scrutiny, and his mission was meant to be slow, cautious, and years-long. "I am not sure I have much to offer to such a group."
</p> 

<p>
"Oh, I don't know." Kweku grinned. "Having a double agent who's trusted by the Deathless Child's priests could be very advantageous for us."
</p> 

<p>
Hazidah froze. His hand crept toward the interior of his robe, but Kweku snorted. "You'd lose a fight with me anyway but look up before you even try."
</p> 

<p>
He quickly flicked his gaze upward, and saw something in the air above him, like a flash of sunlight on bright metal. The stories said the Tempest-Sun Mages flew high above the academy, watching for approaching threats... and they were capable of dealing with more dangerous foes than Hazidah. He lowered his hand and gazed levelly at Kweku. "I suppose I should have feigned confusion."
</p> 

<p>
"Many spies would have, but this saves time. We've known about you since you first applied. The spellcraft hiding your lies is good, but we did a deeper delve into your story and found some loose threads that unraveled when we pulled on them." She stepped close to him, and he tensed, expecting an attack, but instead she looped her arm through his. "Walk with me."
</p> 

<p>
"Are you taking me to be executed? Or to break my mind and make me your servant?"
</p> 

<p>
"Life under the Deathless Child has not been good for you, Hazidah. You see enemies everywhere. I'm not your enemy. I'm your teacher. And what I'm going to teach you is that you're on the wrong side."
</p> 

<p>
Hazidah shook his head. Loyalty was all—the foundation of every temple, the ground beneath every step, and to transgress against Walkena was to face the Punishment of Seven Angry Suns. The priest who'd recruited him had made provisions to ensure Hazidah's loyalty even if his faith faltered, though. "Even if I were swayed by your lies, my obedience is compelled by powers far beyond my will."
</p> 

<p>
"Oh, yes, I know," Kweku said. "Your bindings have bindings. Those will have to be removed if we hope to make any progress." She patted him on the arm. He tried to remember the last time he'd been touched in such a friendly way. "It's a good thing we're in the greatest magical academy the world has ever known, surrounded by experts in magic, isn't it?"
</p> 

<p>
His heart stirred at her touch. He'd never met anyone like her at home—she was intelligent and powerful, but she was <em>messy</em>, and impulsive, and outspoken. Everything he should hate: a native of the Expanse who'd been corrupted and weakened by the outside world, and who sought to bring that poison back home. And it <em>was</em> poison. He could pretend to play along, let them think they'd won him over to their cause while he gathered intelligence to use against them... surely there were such things as <em>triple</em> agents—
</p> 

<p>
She stumbled on a loose stone and put her hand on his arm to steady herself... then left her hand there as they walked. 
</p> 

<p>
"Will you be... working with me closely?" He stared down at her fingers, curled over his forearm. 
</p> 

<p>
"That's the idea. I'll be your handler, Haz. We'll do great things."
</p> 

<p>
<em>Haz.</em> His heart stirred again, and he thought: what if she corrupts <em>me</em>? Would it be better to fight back now, and die, still pure? Or had he pledged his allegiance to the wrong flame—the flame of his master's power, rather than the flame inside himself?
</p> 

<p>
She stepped away to lead him through an archway at the base of a dark tower, and when her back was turned, he reached out to her. 
</p> 

<p>
Even he didn't know, in that moment, if he was reaching out to strangle or embrace.

	<p itemprop="description">Shortly after the first whispers of a new edition of Pathfinder first started circulating, we knew that organized play would play a major role in playtesting. While our team's quite experienced at designing adventures, we swiftly realized there was one thing we stood no chance at creating in 2018: fair rewards for a game whose final form could change dramatically and unpredictably based on playtest results (to say nothing of our wanting tons of Chronicle sheet feedback, so we couldn't even create long-term character records).
        </p>
        
<p>Yet we also wanted to reward players and GMs alike—ideally in a way that was fun, yet didn't grant an insurmountable benefit to playtesters over those who joined the campaign later. From this came Playtest Points (PTP), a currency to spend on fun benefits in 2019 once the Second Edition rules were finalized—rules with which the organized play team could create new boons once the new campaign was ready to launch. As we get ever closer to releasing the new Pathfinder Society Guide to Play, scenarios, and more, it's now time to give a preview of what's coming for Playtest Points.</p>

<p>There are 14 rewards to look forward to, many of them inspired by the playtest adventures. We're expecting the store to go live the week before Gen Con, at which point you'll be able to redeem PTP for boons. One of these rewards you can only buy once, whereas the rest you can purchase multiple times if you're so inspired. Just be aware that 11 of these have scaling costs, with the first copy of the boon being fairly inexpensive and duplicates being available at a higher price. </p>

<p>Let's take a look at some of these rewards!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>❑ <strong>Experienced Adventurer (Limited-Use, Slotless):</strong> Whether you joined the Pathfinder Society after several independent adventures or you quickly surpassed your peers during training to become a Pathfinder agent, you're a capable explorer by the time you set out on your first official assignment. You can check the box that precedes this boon when creating a new character to begin that character at 2nd level with 12 XP, 12 Fame, 12 Reputation distributed between one or more factions, and 30 gp. Include this boon with the new character.</p>

<p><strong>Initiate's Wayfinder (Slotless Boon):</strong> As part of your confirmation as a Pathfinder field agent, you received a <em>wayfinder</em> (<em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> 617) to carry as both a badge of office and as a useful tool. This wayfinder has an effective price of 0 gp for the purpose of resale.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency Draught (Item, Limited-Use):</strong> You almost always have a healing potion hidden away for an emergency. You gain the following action.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 10px;"><strong>[two-actions]</strong> (manipulate) <strong>Frequency</strong> Once per adventure; <strong>Uses 3</strong> ❑ ❑ ❑; <strong>Effect</strong> You search your gear and draw a <em>minor healing potion</em> in one hand. If you are at least 3rd level, you can instead draw a <em>lesser healing potion</em>. If you are at least 6th level, you can instead draw a moderate healing potion. If you are at least 12th level, you can instead draw a <em>greater healing potion</em>. If you are at least 18th level, you can instead draw a major healing potion. This potion lasts until the end of the adventure, after which it loses its potency. The potion's effective price if sold is 0 gp.</span></p>

<p><strong>Red Flag Espionage (Social): </strong>You have experience with delicate social situations where a false move could antagonize a possible ally or accidentally endanger a comrade. When using Diplomacy to Make an Impression or Request, you critically fail the check if you fail the check DC by 12 or more (rather than failing by 10 or more). In addition, you gain the following reaction.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 10px;"><strong>[reaction]</strong> (fortune) <strong>Uses 1</strong> ❑; <strong>Trigger</strong> You critically fail a Diplomacy check; <strong>Effect</strong> You reroll the triggering check and must use the second result.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Being able to start a higher-level character—one who could still enjoy all of our Tier 1–4 scenarios—was one of the givens when we started planning Playtest Point rewards, and even if you'd rather start your first character at 1st level, the Experienced Adventurer boon above can give your second or third character a jumpstart. Meanwhile, the Initiate's Wayfinder is a great opportunity to pick up an otherwise pricey (at least for a 1st-level character) piece of equipment that's central to a Pathfinder agent's identity. Also, we'll be providing a similar option for wayfinders through other rewards, so playtesters aren't the only folks to enjoy this opportunity.</p>

<p>The Emergency Draught provides an extra edge in survivability when the going gets tough, and like many of these rewards, it's a Limited-Use boon that grants a playtester a temporary boost without giving a long-term advantage over newer players. Inspired by the <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> adventure “Red Flags”, the Red Flags Espionage boon shows how some of our boons grant a constant benefit while slotted while also giving a limited-use boost in an emergency.</p>

<p>And there are more rewards besides that you'll see in the coming weeks.  When redemption goes live, you will find them all on a new tab on your “My Organized Play” page at paizo.com.  There you can choose what rewards to purchase and which character to assign them to, plus a downloadable pdf certificate you can print or save to a digital device.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to all of the exciting characters you design come the launch of the new campaign on August 1st, and it'll be great to see these Playtest Point rewards in action!</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
	<p itemprop="description">
Last month, after countless hours combing thorough feedback and iterating improvements to design, Lone Shark released a revision to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set">Core Set</a>. I’ve played every base set of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, so I can say that their hard work has paid off. The Core Set is still fundamentally the same game, but the play is smoother, more dynamic, and more exciting.
</p>

<p>The Core Set's release was also a perfect opportunity for the Organized Play team to improve the rules of Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. I talked about three of the big updates in the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgml?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-New-Box-New">New Rules, New Opportunities PACS</a> blog. The blog said that we would soon have a FAQ that described how to handle updates that weren't already called out in the Core Set Rulebook. This FAQ is now available, through the link Core Conversion Guide at the bottom of paizo.com/pacg. I'd also like to highlight something I said in the comments after that blog. We recognize that people who are deep into an ongoing campaign may not want to update the rules immediately. To that end, ongoing games may continue to use the Mummy's Mask rulebook until the official start of Season 6 at GenCon (August 1st). </p>

<p>In Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society, we've established a tradition of releasing sanctioning documents for non-Society adventures like modules and adventure paths. These documents allow players and GMs to receive credit for their organized play characters in adventures that weren't originally designed with organized play in mind. We'd never had anything like that for the card game, and that seemed like a missed opportunity. We're happy to say that you can now play the Dragon's Demand Adventure Path from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set">Core Set</a>, The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a>, and the free RPG day adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes">We Be Heroes?</a> with your Adventure Card Society characters. Each product's paizo.com page now includes a pdf describing how to play for PACS credit.</p>

<p>We also tried a bit of an experiment in Dragon's Demand.  The last scenario is a choose-your-own builder, which provides 6 different rules structures that you can use to build the scenario. This scenario, Wandering Way, is replayable any number of times, and the rules in the sanctioning document allow you to play it at any tier. So if you're looking for a scenario that any character can play, a way to help a character who has missed a few sessions catch up, or a chance to flex your own creativity in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, check it out! The addition of this scenario to the sanctioned content is a big change, and we welcome your feedback on how it's being received and used in your area. </p>

<p>One of the key differences between the Mwangi Expanse and other regions of the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting is that it (mostly) lacks nation-states with capitals and well-established borders, instead offering a number of city-states spread throughout a vast wilderness of adventure-filled jungles, savannahs, swamps, and mountains. Whether it's Nantambu, with its ancient magic academy, the Magaambya; Mzali, ruled by the mummified child-god Walkena; or the mercantile pirate port of Bloodcove; each of these political entities is presented with the same level of detail as the nations on the Inner Sea. We took special care to ensure that each one is described from the perspective of a native rather than from the eyes of outlanders coming into the region to explore and research the “lost” civilizations within, and longtime fans of the Mwangi Expanse should appreciate the new point of view for the variety of stories it can inspire in players and GMs alike.</p>

<p>On the Expanse's western coast lie the Sodden Lands—a collective name for the flooded nations of Lirgen and Yamassa, which were destroyed with the Eye of Abendego formed off their shores. No centralized government rules these waterlogged lands, and what antediluvian settlements survive are now mostly ruined spectres of their former glory, overtaken by cannibals, cultists, and monsters. Many Lirgeni refugees and lizardfolk resettled in the Mwangi city of Jaha, and unlike the city's vanished former inhabitants, open the city to visitors who hope to learn from the famed astrologers and work with them to find a way to end the raging hurricane and reclaim their homeland.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</p></div> 

<p>South of the Sodden Lands, the former nation of Sargava has undergone incredible change in the last few years. A revolution mounted by the nation's native population overthrew the Chelish colonial government that had ruled for centuries, establishing the new land of Vidrian in Sargava's place. As with all new nations, Vidrian has a long road to stability ahead of it, but its people are hopeful that self-rule will bring about an era of prosperity and innovation. Under the leadership of heroes of the revolution, the ruling council of Anthusis (what used to be Eleder) hopes to establish new trade and military alliances with nations both abroad and in the Expanse, and prevent colonization efforts like that of Sargava from occurring again elsewhere in the Mwangi.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Rogier van de Beek</p></div>

<p>Humans are not the only inhabitants of the Mwangi Expanse, however, and rich societies of elves and orcs are also present. The elves of the Mualijae nations—the Ekujae, Kallijae, and Alijae—occupy most of the Expanse to one degree or another, and though no longer part of a unified nation as they once were, the elves nevertheless exert incredible influence over the entire region. The orcs of Lake Ocata, for their part, have a much more localized reach, but their influence is no less important. In the wake of the Gorilla King's death and the fall of Usaro, it has been these jungle orc tribes who have led the efforts to re-stabilize the region and retake their homeland from the demon-tainted forces that once ruled.</p>

The man has a colorful bird sitting in the palm of his outstretched left hand."/></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Andrea Tentori Montalto</p></div>

<p>Player characters from or familiar with the Mwangi Expanse can select from eight new backgrounds, such as Bonuwat wavetouched, Bright Lion, and Shory seeker, or acquire a <em>blessed tattoo</em> from the Mwangi orcs. Modern heroes who hope to emulate the powers and traditions of the Ten Magic Warriors and Old-Mage Jatembe may also take the magic warrior archetype.</p>

<p>Be on the lookout for the third and final piece of flash fiction from Pathfinder Tales author Tim Pratt later this week in the Tales of Lost Omens series. Next week, we'll travel back to southern Avistan to the meta-region of Old Cheliax with new fiction from Liane Merciel!</p>

<h2>Exploring</h2>

<p>Most of the time when you're adventuring, you're exploring. Whether you're examining a dusty tomb, blazing trails through a dense jungle, or disguising your way into an enemy fortress, exploration is all about discovery. It takes place on a fluid time scale, ranging from roughly 10 minutes to hours, or even days for a long overland expedition. It's dangerous to go alone, especially when you don't know if you'll have an important skill you need to brave the perils of a dungeon, but fortunately you'll be part of a team. If you're an expert or better in a skill, you'll be able to help your allies with that skill while exploring, by coaching your less athletic teammates up the cliffside and spotting the worst of the climb, using hand gestures to sneak your louder allies past the guards at the best moment, and more!</p>

<p>In addition to a handful of exploration actions characters can take while in this game mode, the book also presents a number of skills that can be used while exploring.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-skillexploration.jpg" alt="Text inset: SKILL EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES. Chapter 4: Skills include numerous additional exploration activities, which are summarized here.  
Borrow an Arcane Spell: You use Arcana to prepare a spell from someone else's spellbook (page 241).
Coerce: You use Intimidation to threaten a creature so it does what you want (page 247).
Cover Tracks: You use Survival to obscure your passing (page 252).
Decipher Writing: You use a suitable skill to understand archaic, esoteric, or obscure texts (page 234).
Gather Information: You use Diplomacy to canvass the area to learn about a specific individual or topic (page 246).
Identify Alchemy: You use Craft and alchemist's tools to identify an alchemical item (page 245).
Identify Magic: Using a variety of skills, you can learn about a magic item, location, or ongoing effect (page 238). 
Impersonate: You use Deception and usually a disguise kit to create a disguise (page 245).
Learn a Spell: You use the skill corresponding to the spell’s tradition to gan access to a new spell (page 238).
Make an Impression: You use Diplomacy to make a good impression on someone (page 246). 
Repair: With a repair kit and the Crafting skill, you fix a damaged item (page 243).
Sense Direction: You use Survival to get a sense of where you are or determine the cardinal directions (page 252).
Squeeze: Using Acrobatics, you squeeze through very tight spaces (page 241).
Track: You use Survival to find and follow creatures’ tracks (page 252).
Treat Wounds: You use Medicine to treat a living creature’s wounds (page 249). "/>
</div>

<h2>Encounter</h2>

<p>When every action matters, your characters enter an encounter, proceeding turn by turn, action by action. These crop up in the middle of exploration, putting your travels on hold so you can deal with an immediate danger or opportunity. Combat encounters are the most typical encounters, taking place on a scale of mere seconds between life and death, but all encounters share a common structure: you roll initiative to determine turn order, then you take turns, performing your actions and determining what happens. In a combat encounter, each turn you get one reaction and three actions you can spend however you want. For instance, on her turn in combat, a sorcerer might spend all three actions to unleash a deadly barrage of <em>magic missiles</em> while a fighter might raise his shield and then use a Sudden Charge to rush an enemy and attack.</p>

<p>It's during encounters that most player characters will bestow conditions upon their foes, or gain a condition as the result of the conflict. To make the wide range of conditions that can come into play easier for new players to learn, we provide a full-page list of them without any of the associated rules. This allows someone to quickly reference what it means to be stunned or stupefied, and tell the difference between being undetected, invisible, or concealed.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-conditions.jpg" alt="Text Inset: CONDITIONS. These conditions appear often in the game and are defined in detail in the Conditions Appendix on pages 618-623. Here’s a brief summary of each.

<h2>Downtime</h2>

<p>Even heroes sometimes need a break from the incredible stress of an adventuring life! During downtime, you can earn money, craft items, swap out old character choices for different options, or just take a rest and carouse with the locals. You take your downtime when you return to the safety of a town or home base, usually after completing an adventure. While downtime in general flows quickly through days or weeks at a time, depending on the choices you make, new options might open themselves up to you as the GM sprinkles special downtime events into your chosen downtime activity, zooming in temporarily to highlight interesting or unusual occurrences when you're not out on an adventure.</p>

<p>Downtime gets the least amount of space of the three game modes, but it's an incredibly rich design space built into the core of the game that may lead to new innovations over the lifespan of Second Edition (some of which we're already working on). As in Exploration Mode, players can utilize some of their skills for downtime activities.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-skilldowntime.jpg" alt="Text inset: SKILL DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES.
Chapter 4: Skills includes several downtime activities, which are summarized here.
Craft: Using the Crafting skill, you can create items from raw materials (page 244).
Create Forgery: You forge a document (page 251).
Earn Income: You earn money, typically using Crafting, Lore, or Performance (page 236).
Subsist: You find food and shelter in the wilderness or within a settlement (page 240).
Treat Disease: You spend time caring for a diseased creature in the hope of curing that creature (page 248)." />
</div>

<h2>Treasure</h2>

<p>While many adventurers risk their lives due to heroism or a sense of duty, treasure is a major motivator for others. And let's be honest, even when playing an altruistic PC, it's still a lot of fun to find a cool magic item for your character. In Pathfinder, your characters will find a fairly steady stream of magic items, ranging from simple <em>healing potions</em> to the mighty <em>skyhammer</em>. Some of the more inexpensive items are consumable, meaning they can be used once, like alchemical elixirs you drink, scrolls you read, and special talismans you can attach to your other items. Others, like magic weapons or enchanted clothing and tools, serve you again and again as you adventure. You could wield a <em>storm flash</em> rapier arcing with electricity and wear a <em>dread blindfold</em> to strike fear into your foes! You can also find magic runes you can etch onto weapons and armor to build all kinds of powerful combinations!</p>

<div  class="blurbCenter">
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-stormflash.jpg" width="300" alt="Text inset: Storm Flash. Item 14+. Electricity. Evocation. Magical. 
Usage: held in 1 hand; bulk 1.
Description: This +2 greater striking shock rapier has a golden blade, and miniature electric arcs flash across its guard while it’s wielded. When out of its sheath under an open sky, the blade causes storm clouds to gather slowly above.
Activate  command, envision;
Frequency: once per day;
Effect: You cast a 60th level lightning bolt (DC 33).
Activate reaction command; Frequency: once per 10 minutes; Trigger: An electricity effect targets you or a creature within 10 feet of you, or has you or a creature within 10 feet of you in its area; Effect: You try to divert the electricity off course, to be absorbed by storm flash. Choose one eligible creature to protect and roll a melee attack roll against the DC of the electricity effect. If you succeed, the chosen creature takes no electricity damage from the triggering effect.
Type: storm flash; Level 14; Price 4000 gp.
Type: greater storm flash; Level 18. Price: 21,000gp.
This is a +3 greater striking shock rapier. When activating the sword to cast lightning bolt, the spell is 8th level." />

<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-dreadblindfold.jpg" alt="Text inset: Dread Blindfold. Item 17.
Emotion. Enchantment. Fear. Invested. Magical. Mental.
Price: 15,000 gp.
Usage: worn eyepiece.
Bulk: none.
When tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to Intimidation checks and darkvision. You can see through the blindfold, but only using darkvision. 
The first time a particular creatures sees you in a day, it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be frightened 1. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.

Activate command; Frequency: once per minute; 
Trigger: You damage a creature with a Strike; Effect: Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect of a DC 37 phantasmal killer spell, but it is an enchantment instead of an illusion. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours." width="300" /><br />

<h2>Experience Points and Levels</h2>

<p>In Pathfinder, you learn from your adventures, both your triumphs and your failures, growing more powerful and gaining fantastic new abilities. We measure that progress with Experience Points (XP), and typically the more impressive and insurmountable the challenge for your character, the more XP you gain for overcoming it. Once you earn a total of 1,000 XP, you reach a new level, opening up new options for your character. Next week we'll go into detail about leveling up!</p>

This is the "high magic" part of the core setting, where centuries of warfare between archmages shaped the land and imbued the local culture with magic unlike anywhere else on Golarion.

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Roman Roland Kuteynikov</p></div>
    
<p>At the heart of this region are the nations of Geb and Nex, each named for the mighty archmage who founded it and home to incredible wonders, even millennia after the conflict that came to define them. In Nex, the northern of the two lands, the mysterious Arclords carry on the magical research started by their founder, who disappeared into an extraplanar realm at the climax of his war with Geb. In Quantium, the nation's capital, towers soar above vast palaces illumined by the ethereal glow of perpetual arcane lights, and visitors are as likely to run into a golem on the street as they are an ambitious scholar of wizardry. </p>

<div class="blurbCenter">

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p></div>
    
<p>To Nex's south lies Geb, a land of undead ruled by the ghostly necromancer of the same name. The debauchery of the Blood Lords who govern the nation at Geb's behest is legendary, and nearly every day visitors to the capital of Mechitar can witness glorious feasts of humanoid flesh, parades to the glory of Geb and Urgathoa, or misery wrested upon the living for the pure enjoyment of the ruling class. Geb's fertile fields are the breadbasket of the region, for nearly all of its produce can be exported to other nations, Geb's own populace needing no sustenance from the earth. A constant target for enemies of undead—from the displaced Lastwall Knights to the church of Pharasma—Geb has no shortage of adventure for those who dare risk passage across its forsaken borders.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Fabio Gorla</p></div> 

<p>Between Geb and Nex stretches the Spellscar Desert of the Mana Wastes. Having changed hands countless times in the centuries of magical warfare between the two nations, the wastes were a constant battlefront, and ages of arcane attacks and defenses did irreparable harm to the land itself. Primal storms of raw magical energy flow in unnatural patterns through the unforgiving desert, and pockets of dead magic leave travelers with no defenses against the mutated inhabitants of the scarred region. In the Duchy of Alkenstar, however, the innovative inhabitants have embraced technology as a defense against the wastes' threats, developing new alchemical and clockwork wonders to protect them. The most closely guarded of their secrets is the key to firearms, which have slowly spread from Alkenstar throughout other parts of the world, but which are still largely produced in the duchy itself, guaranteeing a stable economy for the isolated city-state even amid the chaos of the Mana Wastes.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</p></div>
    
<p>Across the Obari Ocean from Nex lies the island nation of Jalmeray, home to a large population of ethnic Vudrani. Here the mystical practices of psychic magic are common, and students of more martial pursuits harness the elemental powers within themselves in the monastic Houses of Perfection. Just as Qadira serves as the Inner Sea's gateway to the riches and wonders of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh, Jalmeray offers just a taste of the mysteries and power of distant Vudra, and many heroes stop here on their journey eastward around Casmaron only to find enough adventure here to keep them in Jalmeray for decades.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ksenia Kozhevnikova</p></div>

<p>Player characters from or adventuring in the Impossible Lands can make use of seven new backgrounds, the student of perfection archetype, and the Eye of the Arclords feat, allowing them to harness some of the magic of the region and add a spark of ancient arcane mystery to their repertoires. Yesterday, we posted a for a glimpse into life in the Impossible Lands with Tim Pratt's story, "Bound for Glory." Next week, we'll journey west into the Mwangi Expanse, so get your mosquito nets ready!</p>

	<p itemprop="description">Ishaani walked through the bustling market in the shadow of her efreeti guardian, Shadqadir. "I don't like this. It's dangerous, dealing with... these matters... out in the open." She clutched the scroll case close to her chest, though it was already secured across her body on a leather strap and further sealed with magic. </p>

<p>Shadqadir rumbled his volcanic laugh. "You feel unsafe in my company, little Ishi? Have I not protected your family against every harm for six generations?" </p>

<p>The crowded lanes were rather less crowded for them than they were for everyone else, as people gave Shadqadir a wide berth. Genies of all sorts were common enough here in Niswan, but Shadqadir was no aloof marid or benevolent djinn. Efreet were made of fire and fury, and he radiated heat and malice. Though Shadqadir had been a constant presence in her life since infancy, Ishaani still found his burning eyes, razored horns, and knowing grin disturbing at times.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
		<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190704-lands.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190704-lands.jpg" width="800"></a>

<p>She would never show him fear, though. "I am no longer a child," she snapped. "I'm capable of taking care of myself. I've studied at the—"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, a House of Perfection." The efreeti yawned, smoke rising from his mouth. "We're all very impressed. You probably thought attending the Monastery of the Unblinking Flame would flatter my fiery nature and stop me from eating your young when the time comes."</p>

<p>"My choice was not influenced by you at all. I chose that House because the study of occult philosophy interests me more than strength of arms." </p>

<p>"Why would you worry about martial skills when you have my powers to command? At least until you spawn." </p>

<p>Ishaani's ancestor had bound Shadqadir to service centuries before, with direct control of his considerable powers passed to the firstborn of his previous owner... but the binding was flawed, and Shadqadir would go free upon the birth of the seventh generation. He made no secret of his plans to take revenge on Ishaani's entire family for his time of servitude once she had a child.</p>
 
<p>Ishaani had therefore decided to be the last of her line. If she died without a child, he would also go free, but she was young, and had time to work on <em>that</em> problem. If her legacy could not continue in the form of children, she needed to make her mark on the world in other ways. This scroll, found behind a false wall in a forgotten store room deep in her family's estate, presented the greatest opportunity to do that. "Just be watchful, Shad. I am less concerned with assault or theft than with someone overhearing our discussion. We should have found someone to authenticate the scroll who would come to us." The scholar they were going to see had actually offered to come to the estate... in six weeks, when his schedule opened up.</p>

<p>"You made no mention of convenience, Ishi. You asked for the best, and the most discreet. As always, I followed your instructions to the letter." </p>

<p><em>And not one syllable beyond</em>, she thought. "The best is an Avistani man? I still find that hard to believe."</p>

<p>"Sometimes the perspective of an outlander offers clarity. For instance, as a human, you find Jalmeray to be an isle of wonders and Niswan a city of splendor. You marvel at its golden temples, its graceful pagodas, its perfumed streets, its shining palaces, its bridges and towers wrought of magic and metal together, at all these myriad mortal glories." He gestured widely, sending the people nearby scurrying away. "While I, unblinded by sentiment, hailing from a more rarefied plane, see this place for what it truly is."

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p>Shadqadir sniffed. "Kindling."
</p>

<p>They reached a book-filled stall draped in colorful cloth, the largest in a lane full of booksellers, scribes, and calligraphers. A dapper man, paler than Ishaani and elaborately bearded and mustachioed, approached them. "You must be the young lady who wanted to see me. And your companion." He nodded respectfully to the efreeti. "How may I be of service?"</p>

<p>"You are Zotikos the Wise?" Ishaani said.

<p>"Some flatter me so."</p>

<p>She glanced around, then leaned close. "I am told there is no greater expert in the antiquities of Jalmeray dating from the reign of the Arclords."

<p>"This I can confirm."</p>

<p>"I have a scroll that purports to be from that era. I wish to determine its authenticity." </p>

<p>Zotikos nodded. "The world is awash in false treasure maps and forgeries." </p>

<p>"It is a matter of some discretion—"
</p>

<p>Zotikos touched a jewel at his throat and the bustling noise of the market vanished, some spell to exclude sound and prevent eavesdropping. "We have complete privacy now."</p>

<p>Ishaani opened the scroll case, carefully removed the document within, and unrolled its delicate length.</p>

<p>Zotikos leaned close, scanned the document, then looked into Ishaani's face. "This purports to be a letter detailing the hiding place of the legendary artifact known as the Scepter of the Arclords, written by a leader of that order before they fled the island."</p>

<p>"Oh good, he's literate," Shadquidar said. "We know what it says. Is it <em>real</em>?"</p>

<p>"Mmm. Probably not. There was a rumor the Scepter had been found recently by an Andoren fool, but that wasn't true, either. May I?"</p>

<p>Ishaani handed over the scroll. Zotikos pinched the document between his fingers, put it close to his eyes, and even sniffed it. She was afraid he might taste the ink. He instead took a round lens from his pocket and gazed through it. After a moment he handed the scroll back. "I don't know if the contents are true, but the document comes from the right period. The quality of the ink, the level of fading, the composition of the paper—it's all consistent with the last years of Arclord dominion over Jalmeray. Even if it's accurate, the Scepter is doubtless long gone, looted or moved—"</p>

<p>"We don't need that kind of advice." The efreeti opened his hand, and gold coins dropped onto the table. Zotikos went to scoop them up and hissed, dropping them, and making the efreeti chuckle. "Those may be a bit warm."</p>

<p>Ishaani glared at the effreeti and said, "Thank you for your help, Zotikos. I can count on your discretion?"
</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"If not, it can be compelled," Shadqadir growled, and the man looked appropriately worried.</p>

<p>The two of them stepped out of the bubble of privacy, and the sound of the market returned. They walked for a couple of minutes, Ishaani in silent thought as she considered her next moves, and then the efreeti spoke again.</p>

<p>"The terms of my service require me to tell you that man was not actually Zotikos, the Avastani scholar, but an imposter. I suspect he was a rakshasa cloaked in illusion."</p>

<p>Ishaani wanted to stop and look back, but she kept walking as naturally as possible. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>The efreeti chuckled. "I met Zotikos once before, years ago, on an errand for your mother. He initially proved reluctant to turn over a volume she desired, so I persuaded him, and left a small mark on his wrist to remember me by—a brand in the shape of my fingertip. Even if Zotikos somehow forgot me, his flesh would remember our meeting, but the skin was unmarred. I only noticed when his sleeve slid back as he handed over the scroll or I would have alerted you earlier."</p>

<p>"A rakshasa," she murmured. "We can't trust his appraisal, then. The letter may be false."</p>

<p>"Or it's real, and now one of the devil-born knows your quest. Perhaps the fiend even replaced Zotikos in order to meet with us. We arranged this meeting two days ago, after all. Plenty of time for an interested party curious about the scroll to make their own plans."</p>

<p>"How could anyone even know about the scroll?" </p>

<p>Shadqadir shrugged. "Treacherous servants, spies, magical surveillance... your parents are known to dabble in powerful matters, and it wouldn't surprise me if your estate is watched. The point is, we can no longer count on security through obscurity. We now face potential opposition in your quest for greatness." Shadqadir's smile was like a forge fire.</p>

<p>She scowled. "You don't need to look so happy about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am. I'm pledged to protect your life and well-being to the fullness of my abilities... but if sufficiently powerful enemies rise against you, my best might not be good enough. In that case, you could die, and I would be free to eat your family." He sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>She'd heard this sort of thing from him before... but she'd never worried about it until now. "Efreet don't need to eat anything at all," she grumbled. "Let alone my relatives."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I don't expect to enjoy the process, but a promise is a promise. So. Shall we go out and seize your destiny, Ishi?"</p>

But when I reviewed developer Linda Zayas-Palmer’s words, I kept thinking about Avengers: Endgame spoilers and how I didn’t want to be "that person".  So, I’m including her review here, with appropriate edits to keep us spoiler free.</p>

	<strong>[Spoiler=Linda's Scenario Review]</strong><br />
<div style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; border-radius:10px; color: #000; text-decoration: none;  padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(160,82,45, 0.1); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
	<blockquote>
	<p style="line-height: 20px;">This scenario kicks off at the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, with the PCs being personally selected by an iconic member of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, the fellow in the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, to embark on a gravely perilous mission. As he explains in the mission briefing, he has discovered a plot to bring about the Pathfinder Society's ruin, a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> by two familiar faces. The first, and the one he sends the PCs after in this scenario, is <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, who was responsible for the death of a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> in the early days of the Society. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> is a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, best known for her rediscovered troves of knowledge in <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> and her appearance in a vision of sorts <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. The second is none other than <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> will be the focus of Part 2 of this series, coming out in July. </p>
	
	<p style="line-height: 20px;">So, if <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> killed a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> hundreds of years ago, how has she managed to stay underground for so long? The answer is simple—a combination of <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> and the choice to live in the one place where merely being a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> is a crime worthy of <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. That is, the infamous stronghold of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>.  At Tier 12-18, the PCs have reached a level where they can fend off hordes of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> rank and file if they need to. But of course, the PCs' real foes are far from the rank and file. In this scenario, the PCs will cross blades with some of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> most powerful forces, as well as the deadliest and most colossal dangers that lurk in the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> jungles. And they will learn secrets that have been buried for centuries, secrets that could well spell the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> doom.<br />

<strong>[/spoiler]</strong></p>


<p>There.  I don't think I let the cat out of the bag.  I ask  the rest of you to swear yourselves to silence as well, so that everyone may experience the penultimate scenario in their own time.  Tune in next month as we bring the first part of the Pathfinder Society to a thundering close in July's capstone scenario!</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> demands your silence.</p>


<h2>Campaign Coins</h2>

<p>When several Organized Play team members attended Origins a couple weekends ago, we had the opportunity to recognize some of the campaigns' hard-working volunteers.  There are few things that bring me as much satisfaction as seeing the look on a volunteer's face as they realize I'm talking about them. Please take a moment to thank the following community members for their efforts on behalf of our gaming community and congratulate them on receiving new Org Play numbers!</p>

<table width="500" align=center>

<h2>Stars</h2>

<p>During May and June,  several GMs crested the summit of 5-star mountain.  To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Three cheers on your achievement!</p>

</p>

<p>As we wrap up our production on Pathfinder Society (1st edition) scenarios,  we would like to reiterate that this is not the end of the road for the campaign.  Just as scenarios still count for event support and players can still earn boons at events, games ran will still count towards star requirements.  So don't worry if you're not quite to your goals, there will still be time to reach for the stars.</p>

<h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2>

<p>We've spent the past six weeks trying out the rubric and receiving feedback on the review process.  So far, what we've heard is positive.  I've been working with tech to get the review reporting online.  We ran into a little blip when our tech liaison had an extended leave of absence, but we are back up and running and hope to have these improvements rolled out soon.</p>

<h2>Convention Listing</h2>

<p>We have organized play activities at quite a few conventions in the upcoming months, so if you want to get your game on, check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

  	<p itemprop="description">Making a character in Pathfinder Second Edition is a process that most experienced gamers will find familiar, but wherever possible, we made changes to make the process more intuitive while still giving you a mountain of choices and flexibility. It all starts with imagining the character you want to play. Maybe you want to be a ferocious dwarven warrior who takes on the aspects of an animal in the heat of battle. Maybe you want to play a wise-cracking elven con artist who grew up on the streets, but now plays at being a member of high society. Or maybe you just want to make a mysterious wizard that loves to blow things up. Pathfinder gives you all the tools to make these characters and countless more!

	<p itemprop="description">Making a character in Pathfinder Second Edition is a process that most experienced gamers will find familiar, but wherever possible, we made changes to make the process more intuitive while still giving you a mountain of choices and flexibility. It all starts with imagining the character you want to play. Maybe you want to be a ferocious dwarven warrior who takes on the aspects of an animal in the heat of battle.

Even if you don't have a complete concept in mind, the steps of character creation in Pathfinder are there to help you make the big decisions and focus in on a character that you are excited to play. 
        </p>
        
<h2>Learning your ABCs</h2>

<p>
With a concept in mind (no matter how fully formed), the next step is to make the major decisions about your character. We call these decisions your ABCs because you need to decide on your character's Ancestry, Background, and Class. By making these big choices, along with any additional decisions that come with each, the character you want to play will take shape!
</p>
<p>
Think of these choices as deciding the major moments in your character's youth. First off you were born, the details of which are decided by your Ancestry. Next up is your youth, which is molded by your Background. Finally, your Class decides the life you have chosen to live as an adventurer. Along each step of the way, you will make additional decisions that reinforce and shape the image of your character. Chief among these are your ability scores. Each step of your ABCs impacts your ability scores, giving boosts and flaws to these six vital stats, changing your raw potential to accomplish tasks and overcome danger. 
</p>

<h2>Details and Polish</h2>

<p>Throughout the character creation process, you must record a variety of details about your character. Many of these are simple proficiency upgrades, noting your character's aptitude at performing specific tasks or resisting effects. Others require you to select from a list of options, like your ancestry's heritage or a feat from your class. Every single choice you make influences what you can accomplish during play, making you different from the others around you. Even if some of the big choices are the same, these smaller decisions can make two clerics, for example, play entirely differently. One might be a virtuous warrior priest, fighting for her deity with blade and shield, while the other is a pious adherent, using spells and sermons to preach a peaceful path.</p>
<p>
Once all of the choices have been made, it's time to buy your starting gear and begin filling out all of your statistics. Starting heroes have precious few gold pieces to start with and buying the right gear can mean the difference between a glorious career and a forgotten grave.

To illustrate this process, I'll be building a Second Edition version of one of my First Edition Pathfinder Society characters, named Iakhovas.<br /><br />
</span>
<br style="clear: all;">
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Create a Concept</h2>

<p>What sort of hero do you want to play? The answer to this question might be as simple as "a brave warrior," or as complicated as "the child of elven wanderers, but raised in a city dominated by humans and devoted to Sarenrae, goddess of the sun." Consider your character's personality, sketch out a few details about their past, and think about how and why they adventure. Many character concepts center around the character's class, their ancestry, or both, so it might be a good idea to flip through the available ancestries and classes to help inspire you. The Core Rulebook includes a helpful spread with a quick summary of each.
</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
		<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-crb22-23.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-crb22-23_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Your character's concept might also center around their background, personal identity, deity, relationship to the other characters, or anything else you can imagine!</p>

<p>
<span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Concept</span><br />
My concept for Iakhovas was a defense-focused master of all martial techniques, skilled and willing to protect and train others, shaped by the death of his sister and his revenge against the vampire Talia Nightcrescent, whose staking makes him a wanted murderer in the undead-dominated nation of Geb. This concept means Iakhovas is a Garundi human, probably either a fighter or a monk.
</span>
<br style="clear: all;">
</p>

<br />
<h2>Step 2: Start Building Ability Scores</h2>

<p>Start all ability scores at 10 in preparation for the later steps. This is a good time to start thinking about what ability scores will be important for your character. You can even jot down your ability scores as you adjust them on your character sheet. </p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
		<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-cs1.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-cs1_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Above you'll see a character sheet with numbered indicators to show you where you need to write something in each numbered step.</p>

<p>
<span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; text-align: left; line-height: 18px; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Ability Scores</span><br /> I start all of Iakhovas's ability scores at 10. Thinking about the way I see him fighting, I think he's likely to fight with a combination of strength and grace in order to be a master of all martial techniques, so I'm likely to prioritize Dexterity and Strength. I see him as being wise and fit as well, so if I get a chance, I might want to raise Constitution or Wisdom.</span>
<br style="clear: all;">
</p>

<br />
<h2>Step 3: Select an Ancestry</h2>
<p>Select an ancestry for your character. Ancestry determines your character's size, Speed, and languages, and contributes to their Hit Points. Each also grants ability boosts and ability flaws to represent the ancestry's basic capabilities.</p>

<p>You'll make four decisions when you select your character's ancestry:
<ul>
<li>Pick the ancestry itself.</li>
<li>Assign any free ability boosts and decide if you are taking any voluntary flaws.</li>
<li>Select a heritage from those available within that ancestry, further defining the traits your character was born with.</li>
<li>Choose an ancestry feat, representing an ability your hero learned at an early age. </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Ancestry</span><br /> 
Since I selected human for Iakhovas's ancestry, he is Medium size, has a 25-foot Speed, speaks Common and Osiriani to start, and begins with 8 Hit Points from his ancestry. <br /><br />

Both of his ability boosts are free, so I assign them to Strength and Dexterity, the two I decided were most important to him in Step 2. This brings him to 12 Strength and Dexterity. I don't see Iakhovas as being particularly unintelligent or uncharismatic, and I said I wanted to try to raise the other four ability scores, so I won't be taking any voluntary flaws.<br /><br />

<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-skilledheritage.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px;" alt="Skilled Heritage: Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills. You become trained in one skill of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in the chosen skill.">For Iakhovas's heritage, I have some great options. Mechanically, the half-elf and half-orc heritages bring a lot to the table, with better vision and access to some excellent new feats, but conceptually, I pictured Iakhovas as a standard human. I eventually choose the skilled heritage, since that will help me fulfill my concept of being skilled a little better, even if I can't invest as much in Intelligence. Since I want him to be a master of all martial techniques, I choose Athletics as his trained skill from his heritage.<br /><br />

<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-naturalambition.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px;" alt="Natural Ambition, Feat 1. Human. You were raised to be ambitious and always reach for the stars, leading you to progress quickly in your chosen field. You gain a 1st-level class feat for your class. You must meet the prerequisites, but you can select the feat later in the character creation process in order to determine which prerequisites you meet.">Finally, I choose an ancestry feat. Haughty Obstinancy has a nice benefit against vampiric domination, but it doesn't really fit his personality. Natural Skill would give him yet more skills, and Cooperative Nature would grant him an incredible +4 circumstance bonus to Aiding his allies, both of which fit his concept, but eventually I decide to take Natural Ambition, which will grant him another class feat and help him be a master of all martial techniques. I can wait and choose the class feat later on, as Natural Ambition mentions.<br /><br />

</span>
</p>

<br />
<h2>Step 4: Pick a Background</h2>

<p>Your character's background might represent their upbringing, an aptitude they've been honing since their youth, or another aspect of their life before they became an adventurer. They typically provide two ability boosts (one that can be applied to either of two specific ability scores, and one that is free), training in a specific skill, training in a Lore skill, and a specific skill feat.</p>

<p>
<span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Background</span><br /> 
Iakhovas's background is one of the parts of him that is most difficult to quantify here. He and his sister were used for their blood by a vampire—the sister of a Blood Lord of Geb—until the vampire overfed and killed his sister, breaking him free of his domination and leading him to stake the vampire while she slept. Then wanted for murder, he escaped Geb and joined the Pathfinders, trading his loyalty for the promise of asylum. He is certainly a criminal in Geb, and criminal is a background, but he hasn't really lived the life of a criminal, so the mechanical elements wouldn't make much sense. Laborer is normally a good choice for characters enslaved by evil creatures, but that background is about a life of manual labor, and Iakhovas was kept around for his blood. My other options are acolyte, acrobat, animal whisperer, artisan, artist, barkeep, barrister, bounty hunter, charlatan, detective, emissary, entertainer, farmhand, field medic, fortune teller, gambler, gladiator, guard, herbalist, hermit, hunter, martial disciple, merchant, miner, noble, nomad, prisoner, sailor, scholar, scout, street urchin, tinker, or warrior. <br /><br />

If I was using Lost Omens World Guide, I would have the absolutely perfect background, "Quick."<br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-quick.jpg" alt="Quick. Background. Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of swaying a stilled heart. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Deception skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat." /><br /><br />

As is, I still have a good choice with the core: I can focus not on who he was in Geb but who he has become, and choose martial disciple, so that's what I do.<br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-martialdisciple.jpg" alt="Martial Disciple. Background. You dedicated yourself to intense training and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch of a prestigious mercenary organization. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in your choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. You gain a skill feat: Cat Fall if you chose Acrobatics or Quick Jump if you chose Athletics. You're also trained in the Warfare Lore skill."  /><br /><br />

For my ability score, I can't go wrong since it has my two favorite options! I take Strength and Dexterity both (They are both now 14). I'm already trained in Athletics from my heritage, so I choose Acrobatics for my skill, gaining the Cat Fall skill feat. Then I gain Warfare Lore automatically. <br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-catfall.jpg" alt="Cat Fall. Feat 1. General. Skill. Prerequisites: trained in Acrobatics. Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you're a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall." /><br /><br />
<br style="clear: all;" />
</span>
</p>

<br />
<h2>Step 5: Choose a Class</h2>

<p>At this point, you need to decide your character's class. A class gives your character access to a suite of heroic abilities, determines how effectively they fight, and governs how easily they can shake off or avoid certain harmful effects. You don't need to write down all of your character's class features yet. You simply need to know which class you want to play, which determines the ability scores that will be most important for your character.</p>

<p><span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Class</span><br />OK, this is the moment of truth. I knew I was going to build him as either a monk or a fighter, and now that I've followed him down this journey, I'm thinking monk! It's okay, I'll take the fighter archetype later to really mix up his martial techniques. At this point I'm just recording my key ability score from monk. I get to pick Strength or Dexterity again—my two favorites—but this time I'm forced to choose between them. After a little internal debate, I decide on Strength, so Strength is now 16.</span></p>

<br />
<h2>Step 6: Determine Ability Scores</h2>

<p>Now that you've made the main mechanical choices about your character, it's time to finalize their ability scores. Do these three things:

<ul>
<li>
First, make sure you've applied all the ability boosts and ability flaws you've noted in previous steps (from your ancestry, background, and class).</li>
<li>Then, apply four more ability boosts to your character's ability scores, choosing a different ability score for each and increasing that ability score by 2.</li>
<li>Finally, record your starting ability scores and ability modifiers.</li>
</ul>
Remember that each ability boost adds 2 to the base score of 10, and each ability flaw subtracts 2. You should have no ability score lower than 8 or higher than 18.</p>

<p><span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Ability Scores</span><br />After applying the previous steps, I have Strength 16, Dexterity 14, and all the rest 10. For my four additional boosts, I'll choose to boost Strength and Dexterity again, and then Wisdom and Constitution, which I had been looking for a way to boost but hadn't until now. This leaves me with Strength 18, Dexterity 16, Constitution 12, Intelligence 10, Wisdom 12, Charisma 10.</span?></p>

<br />
<h2>Step 7: Record Class Details</h2>

<p>Now, record all the benefits and class features that your character receives from the class you've chosen. While you've already noted your key ability score, you'll want to be sure to record the following class features.
<ul>
<li>To determine your character's total starting Hit Points, add together the number of Hit Points your character gains from their ancestry and the number of Hit Points they gain from their class.</li>
<li>The Initial Proficiencies section of your class entry indicates your character's starting proficiency ranks in a number of areas. Choose which skills your character is trained in and record those, along with the ones set by your class. If your class would make you trained in a skill you're already trained in (typically due to your background), you can select another skill to become trained in.</li>
<li>See the class advancement table in your class entry to learn the class features your character gains at 1st level—but remember, you already chose an ancestry and background. Some class features require you to make additional choices, such as selecting spells.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Class Details</span><br />

With 8 Hit Points from his human ancestry, 10 from the monk class, and 1 from Constitution, Iakhovas ends with a very respectable 19 HP. His initial proficiencies tell me he is trained in Perception, has expert proficiency in all three saving throws, is trained in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, is untrained in all armor but has expert proficiency in unarmored defense, and has trained proficiency in monk class DC. He's also trained in a number of skills equal to 4 plus his Intelligence modifier, so four. Since he already has Acrobatics and Athletics, I decide his other skills are Medicine since he would have needed to perform to bandage up and handle lost blood, Stealth for sneaking around and escaping the notice of the undead, Religion to represent his new faith in Pharasma (goddess of death) and his knowledge of undead weaknesses, and Diplomacy to cover the way he likes to instruct new recruits—in a friendly fashion rather than like a drill sergeant.<br /><br />

The advancement table shows me he also gets powerful fist, the incredibly potent Flurry of Blows action, and a monk feat of my choice! <br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-powerfulfist.jpg" alt="Powerful Fist. You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks." /><br /><br />

<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-flurryofblows.jpg" alt="Flurry of Blows [one-action]. Flourish. Monk. Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn." /><br /><br />

Now it's time to choose my monk feat. And I get two feats, thanks to Natural Ambition. As a master of all martial techniques, I definitely want Iakhovas to have a stance. Looking through the options, there are a lot of very good choices. Dragon Stance and Wolf Stance are both strong using the stats I have right now, but Mountain Stance is tempting, even if it would mean I'd need to go back and rearrange some earlier choices to deprioritize Dexterity.<br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-dragonstance.jpg" alt="Dragon Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are unarmored. You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like a lashing dragon's tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of difficult terrain while Striding." /><br /><br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-mountainstance.jpg" alt="Mountain Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are unarmored and touching the ground. You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 status bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or Tripped. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet." /><br /><br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-wolfstance.jpg" alt="Wolf Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are unarmored. You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
If you’re flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait." /><br /><br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-kirushstrike.jpg" alt="Ki Rush. Focus 1. Uncommon. Monk. Transmutation. Casting [one-action]: verbal. Accelerated by your ki, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times: two Strides, two Steps, or one Stride and one Step (in either order). You gain the concealed condition during this movement and until the start of your next turn.  | Ki Strike. Focus 1. Uncommon. Monk. Transmutation. Casting [one-action]: verbal. You focus your ki into magical attacks. Make an unarmed Strike or Flurry of Blows (this doesn't change the limit on using only one flourish per turn). You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls with the Strikes, and the Strikes deal 1d6 extra damage. This damage can be any of the following types of your choice, chosen each time you Strike: force, lawful (only if you're lawful), negative, or positive. " /><br /><br />

Offense, or mobility? This would grant a great deal of either when I needed them most, and as a monk, I could spend 10 minutes to meditate and strive for inner peace in order to recover my Focus Points, letting me use this in most battles as long as we rest between them. It's the closest call yet, but I decide to go for ki strike. I'll be keeping an eye on the party's offense vs. my ability to outpace my foes' movement and potentially retraining if I find out ki rush would have been more useful.
</span>
</p>

<br />
<h2>Step 8: Buy Equipment</h2>

<p>At 1st level, your character has 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) to spend on armor, weapons, and other basic equipment. Your character's class lists the types of weapons and armor with which they are trained (or better!). Their weapons determine how much damage they deal in combat, and their armor influences their Armor Class; these calculations are covered in more detail in Step 10. Don't forget essentials such as food and traveling gear!</p>

.<p><span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Equipment</span><br />
<img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-monkkit.jpg" align="left" alt="Monk Kit. Price: 4 gp, 9 sp; Bulk: 4 Bulk, 2 light; Money Left Over: 10 gp, 2 sp
Weapons: longspear, staff
Gear: adventurer's pack, bandolier, climbing kit, grappling hook, lesser smokestick" style="padding-right: 10px;" />
As a monk, I don't really need too many weapons or armor, though a ranged weapon would be nice. I'll be fine with a monk's kit for 4 gp and 9 sp, plus maybe 10 javelins for 1 more gp for a ranged attack. Just because Iakhovas hates vampires so much, I spend 3 of my remaining gp on a vial of holy water, leaving plenty of money to help out others if necessary.<br /><br />
</span>
</p>

<br />
<h2>Step 9: Calculate Modifiers</h2>

<p>With most of the big decisions for your character made, it's time to calculate the modifiers for your statistics. If your proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your bonus equals your character's level plus another number based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). If your character is untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0.</p>

<p><span style="border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block; position: relative;">
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas: Modifiers</span><br />
Iakhovas winds up with +4 Perception (1 from level, 2 from trained proficiency, 1 from Wisdom), +6 Fortitude, +8 Reflex, +6 Will, +7 to hit with his melee attacks, +6 to hit with his ranged attacks, and a variety of trained skills, ranging from Athletics at +7 to Diplomacy and Warfare Lore at +3. He does 1d6+4 damage with his fist, 1d8+4 with his wolf jaw, and 1d6+4 with his thrown javelins.
</span>

<h2>Step 10: Finishing Details</h2>

<p>At this point, you fill in all the details, including those to breathe more life into your character's personality like alignment, deity, age, and gender and pronouns, and those last mathematical details that weren't part of your modifiers like class DC, hero points, AC, and Bulk.

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem">Iakhovas</span><br />
As a devout Pharasmin but a team player who is often selfless in pursuit of protecting others, I definitely see Iakhovas as either neutral or neutral good. I decide on neutral good, and we'll see if that shifts during play. He is in his late 20s, after an early youth lost to vampiric domination. I decide to go with 28. His gender is male and he uses he/him pronouns. His class DC, as we saw before, is trained, and it's based on his Strength, so it would be 17 (10 + 4 from Strength + 1 from level + 2 for being trained). He generally would start a session with 1 Hero Point. His AC would be a solid 18 (10 + 3 from Dexterity + 1 from level + 4 from being an expert). Finally, he is carrying 5 Bulk and 3 light (4 Bulk 2 light from the monk kit, 1 more Bulk entirely of javelins, and then 1 light for holy water). He can carry way more than this, so he can probably help other team members who might be having trouble.
