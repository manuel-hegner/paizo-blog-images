  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Chris Willrich</p> \n   <h2>Chapter 2: A Roving Young\
  \ Fellow</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Gentlemen adventurers needed to mind their steps, especially on roofs. Gull discovered\
  \ that hard lesson—as well as that cold, wet, and muddy lesson—when he slipped off\
  \ the mist-slick summit of Skua Croon's Curiosity Shop and toppled into the mud.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>He stood up painfully, brushed the muck of Admiral's Fen off his new\
  \ cloak, and acted as though such things happened every day.</p> \n    <p>The passersby\
  \ nodded and smiled exactly as if it were so.</p> \n    <p>Striding through the\
  \ fog toward Cassomir's shipyard like an admiral and not a vagabond minstrel, Gull\
  \ wondered at the new poise that enveloped him. True, he was clearly no more coordinated\
  \ than before, nor tougher, as his bruises informed him.</p> \n    <p>But something\
  \ had kindled his spirit. Perhaps it was the strange rattles and cranks he'd heard\
  \ from Grayguard Castle, or the stares he'd attracted with this peculiar cloak.\
  \ Whatever the reason, Gull walked without fear through the heart of Taldor's naval\
  \ power. And despite his odd appearance, workers, sailors, merchants, and officials\
  \ all nodded or waved as he passed.</p> \n    <p>Once or twice he heard shouts behind\
  \ him—the corsairs or the ruffians perhaps—and he took care to slip through fog-shrouded\
  \ alleys between the businesses that catered to the navy and its sailors, the provisioners,\
  \ sailmakers, coopers and the like, as well as the brothels, fortune-telling halls,\
  \ and gambling dens. No one challenged him, though some beckoned him toward this\
  \ ill-reputed doorway or that. Perhaps, with more time on his hands and fewer foes\
  \ on his tail, he'd have lingered.</p> \n    <p>But now he'd a destination in mind.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He emerged from the maze of ship-related concerns and braved the shadowy\
  \ ruins of Quickfall Abbey, making the sign of Erastil's antlers on his chest as\
  \ he passed that reputedly haunted locale. Like the splintered bones of dead giants,\
  \ the crumbled walls jabbed through the sunlit fog. Gull whistled, mentally revising\
  \ an old Andoran drinking song.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Oh, my name's\
  \ Gideon, I'm a songman gone bad,</i><br> <i>And a roving young fellow at need.</i><br>\
  \ <i>So be easy and free, if you're haunting at me—</i><br> <i>I'm a man who will\
  \ run far away.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>No spirit deigned to trouble\
  \ his morning. The tune's energy seemed to pour into his feet, and it was with a\
  \ light step that he emerged into the northern end of Cassomir, a realm of cobblestone\
  \ lanes and pleasant cottages and houses. As the rising sun melted the fog away,\
  \ Gull located a certain flower shop and purchased a red rose from a matron whose\
  \ suspicious look similarly melted in the light of his smile.</p> \n    <p>\"Why,\
  \ Master Gull,\" she said. \"You've not been this way in weeks.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  The life of an musician is a busy one, Mrs. Amaranth.\" Gull looked toward the ceiling.\
  \ \"Ah, is Corvine...\"</p> \n    <p>\"She is in, but I don't think—\" But by then\
  \ Gull was out the door and ascending one of the exterior stairs. Abbey Green held\
  \ many such locales, harboring a shop or two on the ground level and lofting dwellings\
  \ overhead. A widow, Mrs. Amaranth owned this building and reserved for herself\
  \ a flower shop and a small home above, while renting the rest of the ground floor\
  \ to a navy wife who supplemented her husband's pay with needlework and flag-making.\
  \ As the wife lodged at the Citadel, the remaining space was rented to a pair of\
  \ female musicians.</p> \n    <p>Gull had known one of them quite well. The other\
  \ had regarded her roommate's taste in men as a mental affliction.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ he knocked, a snatch of song came to him, a piece with a backwoods sound, something\
  \ he'd not worked on in years.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Howling like\
  \ a mangy old wolf at the moon</i><br> <i>Sleeping through the warmth of the sun</i><br>\
  \ <i>Worrying too much about getting the girl—</i><br> <i>Not enough about getting\
  \ the right one.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The door opened. It was the\
  \ one who'd thought him an affliction.</p> \n    <p>\"You.\"</p> \n    <p>Thea Zephyr\
  \ (a stage name if Gull had ever heard one) narrowed her eyes beneath her artistic\
  \ beehive of hair, which loomed above like a russet thunderhead with black hairpins\
  \ for lightning. Taldan women fought endless skirmishes via their glorious crowns\
  \ of hair. Men who supposed these displays were entirely or even mostly about <i>them</i>\
  \ were naive.</p> \n    <p>Gull's own naivete lay elsewhere. \"Me,\" he confessed,\
  \ smiling.</p> \n    <p>\"You selfish bastard.\" Thea stepped out, her stare pushing\
  \ him backward as though she were warding her roommate from the very sight of Gideon\
  \ Gull. \"Do you have any idea how long Corvine looked for you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I...\"</p> \n    <p>\"She thought you were dead!\"</p> \n    <p>\"She minded?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Thea finally got a good look at him, taking in the shave, the wash,\
  \ the raised hands, the cloak. She blinked.</p> \n    <p>\"She minded,\" she said.\
  \ She studied him a little longer, her expression shading from anger to confusion.\
  \ \"I'll get her.\" She shifted slowly inside, then slipped back, snatched the rose\
  \ from his hand, and gave it a quick sniff like a child stealing a sweet. In she\
  \ went, and now Gull wore the confused look.</p> \n    <p><i>Curious</i>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He heard new voices from the fog to the south. They might be Sebastian Tambour's\
  \ men, or even Tarik the Unclean's. He practiced looking as inconspicuous as a minstrel\
  \ in a gold-embroidered purple cloak on a second-story stairway could be.</p> \n\
  \    <p>A woman with a more subdued tangle of black hair, held by a single ivory\
  \ pin, appeared at the door. She had bronze-looking skin and pale blue eyes that\
  \ made Gideon shiver like a newly plucked string.</p> \n    <p>\"You,\" she said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Me,\" he said.</p> \n    <p>She handled the rose like an idle conductor\
  \ with a baton, tapping the blossom against one palm. “So?”</p> \n    <p>\"Yes...\"\
  \ he began, and stopped. The word was like a steppingstone leading into fog.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Well?\"</p> \n    <p>He held up his hands. \"I know.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>The last thing Corvine Gale expected was a visit from\
  \ Gideon Gull.\n    </div> \n    <p>Corvine Gale's fresh appraisal of Gideon Gull\
  \ did not seem to banish her disdain as it had Mrs. Amaranth's and Thea Zephyr's.\
  \ Rather the opposite. \"You're <i>sorry</i>?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You're sorry...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. May I... come in?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"No.\" She followed his gaze to where a group of figures appeared to be emerging\
  \ from the fog around the abbey. She noted his concern. She sighed. \"Yes.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Okay. Thanks.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't thank me,\" she said as she led\
  \ him into the crowded room.</p> \n    <p>Just before the door closed, Gull heard\
  \ something hit one of the fallen stones of Quickfall Abbey.</p> \n    <p><i>Thok</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gull looked around, seeing many familiar faces, most with a musical instrument\
  \ to go with them. \"Why, Alaric, Nicolaus, Walpurga... It's been too long.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Several people looked as though they might question that assertion. But\
  \ they shifted uncomfortably and were uncharacteristically silent in the presence\
  \ of the new Gull.</p> \n    <p>Corvine placed a hand on his shoulder, spun him\
  \ to face her. In the process her balance faltered and she weaved into him. He smelled\
  \ gnome whiskey. He had an excellent nose for that sort of thing. She stiffened\
  \ and pulled away. \"I'm having a party, Gideon. Well, a rehearsal with a friendly\
  \ audience. Not much difference. You know how it is.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I used to.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Well. Four of us are singing at Admiral Kasaba's birthday at Madame\
  \ Velm's.\" She gave Gull a scrutinizing look, for they'd both known Velm well.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Maybe three,\" put in a harpist named Alaric. \"I've been feeling ill...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You'll make it,\" Corvine insisted. \"It has to be a four-part madrigal.\
  \ And I believe they're going to surprise Kasaba with a giant cake and have a handsome\
  \ midshipman jump out or some damn thing. I don't know, she's not my patron anymore.\"\
  \ Here came another hard look. \"They're just paying us to sing. But we need to\
  \ be good. Just about everybody who's anyone is going to be there.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull\
  \ said, \"That's why you're practicing drunk? Madame Velm doesn't like lushes.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"<i>You</i> are not going to lecture me about drink. Nor about a\
  \ patronage you deprived us both of. You are going to sit right there and not make\
  \ a fool of yourself.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull knew when to shut up. Sometimes. He bowed\
  \ and took a chair beside Corvine's bookshelf. He tried easing the commotion he'd\
  \ caused by peering over his shoulder at the books. Although Gull could read, it\
  \ was no easy task, and he'd learned music entirely from mentors, starting with\
  \ backwoods fiddlers back in Andoran. Corvine, now, she was a reader. Gull saw books\
  \ of ballads, scores for operas, and ragged collections of songs and folk tales\
  \ collected from the villages of the Taldan interior. He saw, too, books about magic—\
  <i>The Olde Companion, The Magister's Tunebook, Songs of the Azlanti Twilight</i>—\
  not the intricate tomes of professional spellcasters, full of maddening esoteric\
  \ formulae, but the sort of homely references collected over time by those worthy\
  \ of the title <i>bard</i>.</p> \n    <p>For all the bravado of this day, he now\
  \ felt fully the bumpkin, and as the quartet resumed its jolly madrigal the feeling\
  \ only grew.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Raise the sail, strike the drum</i><br\
  \ \\> <i>The long-awaited hour's come</i><br \\> <i>Let all who live by wind and\
  \ wave</i><br \\> <i>Stand attention proud and grave.</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Alaric's part faded in a fit of coughing. The man waved for the others\
  \ to go on, and Corvine proved her status as a bard by gesturing and conjuring an\
  \ enchanted mouth to sing from the wood of the door. The mouth used her own voice\
  \ but made it possible to proceed without Alaric.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n    \
  \ <p><i>Though Taldor's foes yet ring us round</i><br \\> <i>Our admiral runs them\
  \ all to ground.</i><br \\> <i>Though alarums summon all too soon</i><br \\> <i>Hearken\
  \ to this happy tune.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Now the song seemed to\
  \ disintegrate like a flock of birds startled by human voices, only to careen back\
  \ into formation at a higher pitch:</p> \n    <p><i>Happy happy (la la la) happy\
  \ birthday (la la) birthday birthday (la)</i>...</p> \n    <p>Gull knew there were\
  \ variances and flourishes here he'd not the education to appreciate, but he understood\
  \ this tune was both respectful and teasing, and would bring joy to the listeners,\
  \ and applause—and then be forgotten. That was the way of much Taldan music. In\
  \ contrast, he'd had only blunt verse, with whatever truth he could muscle behind\
  \ it. Even songs of battle had eluded him, for he'd focused in Andoren fashion on\
  \ the horrors common folk faced in war, not on the glory, real or supposed, chased\
  \ by nobles in polished armor.</p> \n    <p>His musings led him so far from Corvine's\
  \ chamber that he only slowly understood the rehearsal was over, the enchanted mouth\
  \ had faded, and the quartet and its small audience were now gossiping and talking\
  \ shop. Some snatches of conversation cut through his bitter reflections.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Alaric: It helps to first compose several stanzas about the history of\
  \ the campaign, the battle setting, the distribution of forces, et cetera. Then\
  \ you can just tack on an ending that celebrates the victory or mourns the loss.\
  \ Last, you add a prologue about it all being destiny. Saves time and worry...</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Thea: Could it be? Could I truly have been born to sing?</i></p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Corvine: Born to talk about it, maybe...</i>/p&gt; </p>\n    <p><i>Nicolaus:\
  \ Alaric, give it up. There's no such thing as imitation quirky...</i></p> \n  \
  \  <p><i>Alaric: But of course we trust pretty people more than honest people! Taldor's\
  \ great tragedy is that we value faces over facts.</i></p> \n    <p>\"Andoran's\
  \ worse,\" Gull muttered, \"in its way.\"</p> \n    <p>Conversation ceased. Gull\
  \ uneasily looked back at these musicians of Taldor, each better versed in the craft\
  \ than he. Corvine frowned, as though she'd forgotten he was there, and was unhappy\
  \ to be reminded. \"I'd have thought you would be missing Andoran,\" she said. \"\
  For a while, I thought you had returned there.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull saw no choice\
  \ but to plunge in. \"In Andoran anyone can hold high office. So even though we've\
  \ no king, we the people are in the same position as a king choosing his ministers.\
  \ But we don't have the leisure or learning of kings. We are busy... well, my fellow\
  \ Andorens are busy... with our lumbering and bee-keeping and harvesting. So we\
  \ are like the most foolish of kings—a wastrel prince, maybe, suddenly inheriting\
  \ the crown and choosing his servants in a hurry. And so we choose the pretty. Or\
  \ the silver-tongued. Or someone with a famous name, even if they were famous for\
  \ something utterly irrelevant. Or we choose whomever now seems angriest at the\
  \ last fool we elected.\"</p> \n    <p>He expected to be laughed off, a fool speaking\
  \ of fools. Or worse, <i>tsked</i> and <i>tut-tutted</i> at by the superior folk\
  \ of Taldor.</p> \n    <p>Instead they nodded with interest at his words. Had he\
  \ spoken better than was his wont? Or was the strange charm of this day working\
  \ upon them?</p> \n    <p>Alaric coughed and answered. \"Far be it from me to praise\
  \ Andoran before Taldor... but I think you are too harsh. What you speak of is simply\
  \ human nature. It applies everywhere. Perhaps the consequences have special meaning\
  \ in Andoran, but I assure you shallow judgment is as devastating here.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The other man in the quartet, Nicolaus, nodded. \"And if the great of Taldor\
  \ are foolish, who's to stop them? At least in Andoran the fools can expose each\
  \ other.\"</p> \n    <p>And indeed, Gull felt a sudden yearning for his old land.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I did not know,\" said Thea, \"that you were a philosopher, Gideon\
  \ Gull.\"</p> \n    <p>The other guests made encouraging sounds to echo Alaric,\
  \ Nicolaus, and Thea's responses. All but Corvine.</p> \n    <p>\"He's not!\" she\
  \ scoffed. \"He talks a good story, always has. Maybe he's a little more polished\
  \ now. But it's the same old Gideon!\"</p> \n    <p>But the others ignored her,\
  \ and from then on Gull was the center of the party. Alaric loaned him a harp, and\
  \ with the other musicians' help he began composing something on his theme.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>In Andoran, the founders so fine</i><br> <i>Gave\
  \ us all a bottle of wine.</i><br> <i>Common Rule, the label had read</i><br> <i>A\
  \ glorious vintage of martyrdom red.</i><br> <i>In drunken sprees we drank it all\
  \ down</i><br> <i>Rejoicing that no one would wear a crown.</i><br> <i>In sickly\
  \ dawn's light we needed to pee</i><br> <i>And so used that bottle called Democracy.</i><br>\
  \ <i>O Andoran, you land of the free,</i><br> <i>You drank up the wine of Democracy</i><br>\
  \ <i>But the price of gettin' some more of that drink</i><br> <i>Is a plunge in\
  \ cold water and a promise to think!</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Alaric\
  \ and Nicolaus jumped in with a verse they'd just concocted:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>O Taldan lords, you trample our rights</i><br> <i>While you battle\
  \ each other for miniscule slights.</i><br> <i>Our lords eat and drink while the\
  \ commoners thirst,</i><br> <i>True nobles would always put common men first!</i></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>\"You'll get thrown in the stocks,\" Corvine warned.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Just like I'll get tarred and feathered in Andoran,\" Gull said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It's the song that gets you in trouble everywhere!\" Nicolaus said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But don't you see?\" Thea said. \"If we are more careful with the words...\
  \ this song could actually criticize the nobility. It sounds at first like it's\
  \ mocking Andoran. But it's not actually mocking Common Rule. It just says that\
  \ Andoran's people don't live up to the ideals.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Our royals would\
  \ say,\" said Corvine, \"that no one can live up to those ideals.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  But if we go on to poke fun at <i>Taldor's</i> foils,\" Thea went on, staring into\
  \ the daylight beyond the window, \"we can have a song that argues for a better\
  \ world—and sing it right under the nobility's noses.\"</p> \n    <p>There was a\
  \ chorus of assent.</p> \n    <p>\"<i>What</i>?\" Corvine said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Friend Gull,\" Alaric said, \"you should take my place tonight in the quartet.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"What?\" Corvine repeated.</p> \n    <p>\"We all know I'm not feeling\
  \ well,\" Alaric continued, \"and it's affecting my voice. And just maybe, if there\
  \ is the right moment, you can sing your song where the powerful can hear. Hold\
  \ on to the harp. I'll return for it tomorrow.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\" said Corvine\
  \ looking from one companion to another.</p> \n    <p>\"You know,\" Nicolaus said,\
  \ \"I have had a few ideas of my own, for songs that mock the mighty...\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I too,\" said another musician.</p> \n    <p>\"And I,\" said a third.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You are all mad,\" Corvine said. \"Out of here, all of you! Gideon\
  \ is addling your minds. Get some fresh air. I'm serious. You too, Thea.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Thea was the last outside, giving her roommate—or was it Gull?—a last, probing\
  \ look.</p> \n    <p>Corvine slammed the door, and turned to face Gull. She did\
  \ not look enchanted. \"Where did you get it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Eh?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  The <i>cloak</i>, Gideon. It's obvious that's it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's what?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The thing you're using to become such a smooth talker. A philosopher.\"\
  \ She shook her head. \"I knew something was amiss when I noticed Thea of all people\
  \ making eyes at you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"She was?\"</p> \n    <p>\"<i>Don't</i> act\
  \ so innocent! You saw how they behaved. I swear they're ready to write limericks\
  \ about the Grand Prince!\"</p> \n    <p>\"All right... yes.\" He steepled his fingers,\
  \ leaned back in his chair. He'd seen scholars act like that. \"I know there is\
  \ something different about today. Something extraordinary has come over me. But\
  \ it could be a concoction of my own mind.\" He remembered his dream of the music\
  \ of the spheres. \"Perhaps desperation has kindled something in me. Perhaps I am\
  \ finally ready to awaken from my drunken dreams...\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's not you,\
  \ Gideon. It's the cloak. It wouldn't be the first magic item to enhance a person's\
  \ presence. Take it off, and you'll see.\"</p> \n    <p>He smiled. \"Are you actually\
  \ telling me to take my clothes off?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Go to hell.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  All right, all right. That's a spooky thought, you know, when you're wearing a Chelish\
  \ cloak.\"</p> \n    <p>He began to remove the garment, albeit with reluctance.\
  \ <i>I can take it off anytime I want to</i>, he insisted silently. So why did he\
  \ hesitate?</p> \n    <p>He made a show of negligently draping the cloak over a\
  \ chair.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah,\" said Corvine. \"There you are.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What\
  \ do you mean?\" He suddenly felt naked as a mole rat, for all that his old clothes\
  \ clung clammily to his body.</p> \n    <p>\"I mean, you look like yourself.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He let out a long breath, as if weeks of hard living were woven through\
  \ that gust of air. What had he been doing? Had he really taunted thugs and corsairs,\
  \ run along rooftops, encouraged sedition? He was insane.</p> \n    <p>And yet,\
  \ he'd rather liked it.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah,\" he said, looking at his feet. \"Myself.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Where did you get it, Gideon?\"</p> \n    <p>He stared at her. \"\
  Why do you really want to know?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I've the feeling you're mixed up\
  \ with something bad. Magic like that doesn't just fall from the sky.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"No.\" He smirked. \"It washes onto shore.\" He told her the story of his\
  \ day. Her eyes widened at each new episode.</p> \n    <p>She gripped his shoulder,\
  \ firmly this time. Her hand stayed put. Startled, he looked into her eyes. He found\
  \ himself hoping he could keep doing that...</p> \n    <p>\"Gideon,” she said. “\
  I'm glad to see you. Truly. But you are impossible. You don't need magic to rise\
  \ out of the gutter.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The gutter has been a step up...\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Enough. Stay off the streets. Stay here for a while.\" She rubbed her\
  \ temples. \"I know how to put an ear to a wall. I will go and see what I can learn\
  \ about strange Chelaxians with purple cloaks—and those who might murder them. You...\
  \ well, Alaric is sure to come to his senses, but if he doesn't...\"</p> \n    <p>“\
  What about <i>your</i> senses? You've been drinking.”</p> \n    <p>“Shut up.” She\
  \ set down two sheets of handwritten music. \"Do you remember what I taught you\
  \ about reading notation?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then practice.\
  \ If you do end up joining us tonight I don't want you embarrassing us in front\
  \ of Madame Velm.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I am sorry. About all of that.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Sorry you got sloshed before a duet, and cost us both our patronage?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"That... and that I convinced you to come to Cassomir to work with her. Where\
  \ there were no other patrons of similar stature.\"</p> \n    <p>\"This... is not\
  \ the time. Give me one of those gold coins.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I have but three left.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You need clothes.\" She sniffed. \"Don't argue.\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ didn't argue. To a degree he was enjoying the fuss. When she left he even dutifully\
  \ studied tonight's madrigal, so he could adequately perform Alaric's part. He was\
  \ still a musician. And moreover, he did not enjoy the disdain that had colored\
  \ Corvine's words.</p> \n    <p>So he focused on this one small thing.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Presently he was nagged by a desire for drink. He looked about the room for\
  \ something to sate it. A tiny, persistent disgust at himself crept in through some\
  \ corner-crack of his soul, like a little animal stubbornly nesting in Gull's mental\
  \ cupboards. At that moment he found an actual cupboard containing a bottle of Zimaran\
  \ wine.</p> \n    <p>He gently closed the door.</p> \n    <p>And opened it again.\
  \ And closed it.</p> \n    <p>He was somewhat in need of willpower.</p> \n    <p>His\
  \ eye turned to the cloak, and in one fluid motion he was across the room and swishing\
  \ it onto himself, tying it off with a dramatic half-turn. \"No,\" he said, \"Gideon\
  \ Gull drinks when he wishes—not when the bottle demands.\"</p> \n    <p>And in\
  \ that manner, proud and purple, he returned to the problem of the madrigal.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So focused upon the music was he that at first he believed the knock\
  \ at the door to be some rhythm-induced hallucination.</p> \n    <p>On the second\
  \ knock, he rose languidly and opened the door. \"What did you—\" he began, but\
  \ choked on the words, for it was not Corvine.</p> \n    <p>Here instead was well-dressed\
  \ man of hard bearing, his red woolen jacket buttoned with pewter, his blue felt\
  \ hat bearing a silver pin depicting the Lion of Taldor crouched upon a ship. \"\
  At last,\" said the man.</p> \n    <p>\"Are we acquainted, sir?\" The man seemed\
  \ somehow familiar.</p> \n    <p>\"We know of each other. I am Mortil, assistant\
  \ to Governor Bozbeyli.\" More quietly, he added, \"I am also your contact.\" He\
  \ waited for Gull to take that in, and although Gull failed, Mortil went on. \"\
  Are you alone here?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well...\"</p> \n    <p>Mortil brushed past\
  \ Gull, eyes focused on the musician as if he thought Gull a dangerous customer.\
  \ Gull was reminded of a look he'd seen back home in the eyes of wild dogs. Mortil\
  \ took the chair beside the books; Gull shut the door and sat at the nearby bench\
  \ along the wall.</p> \n    <p>Mortil said, \"I had to call in help to find you.\
  \ Do you know what that cost me?\"</p> \n    <p>By now, Gull did indeed recall Mortil,\
  \ someone he'd met once or twice under the patronage of Madame Velm. The recognition\
  \ was not mutual, however, and Gull suspected he had the cloak to thank for that.\
  \ A good thing, too. Despite the bland tones, something in the other's eyes spoke\
  \ emphatically of <i>prices</i> like murder, torture, blood, and madness. This discouraged\
  \ Gull from his normal loquaciousness. He ventured, \"We all must pay the piper...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You were not at the rendezvous,\" snapped Mortil. \"Where were you?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I—have had my difficulties.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I have been assured\
  \ you are exceptional at your work.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well... you know, back home\
  \ I was considered great...\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are not in Cheliax. Things are different\
  \ here.\"</p> \n    <p>That annoyed Gull. \"Do I look Chelish?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Come now, don't fence with me. It doesn't matter to me where Cheliax finds its agents.\
  \ I have been awaiting the man with the purple cloak for days, and in that time\
  \ the target has begun working to undermine the efforts of our masters. It is time\
  \ to strike back.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. The event is tonight.\
  \ Never will the target be more vulnerable.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull had an uncomfortable\
  \ feeling he knew who <i>the target</i> was. \"I might be able to get close,\" he\
  \ ventured, not sure why he was playing along, unless of course it was to avoid\
  \ getting killed.</p> \n    <p>Yes, that might be it.</p> \n    <p>\"Good,\" said\
  \ Mortil. \"I have been unable to divine your plans. You, of course, need not give\
  \ me details....\" Mortil paused.</p> \n    <p>Gull said nothing.</p> \n    <p>With\
  \ a disappointed look Mortil continued. \"... but I will ensure the guard is light.\
  \ There will be enough distraction that you should have no great difficulty. I would\
  \ do the deed myself, but I would likely be discovered.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And what\
  \ of escape?\"</p> \n    <p>\"That is your problem.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And what of\
  \ reward?\"</p> \n    <p>\"That is our masters' problem.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull made\
  \ himself chuckle. \"Of course.\"</p> \n    <p>Mortil was unamused. \"You seem to\
  \ take this matter too lightly. I assure you our masters, on Golarion and elsewhere,\
  \ see your mission as essential to their plans.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, I take it seriously.\"\
  \ Gull leaned forward. \"<i>Damned</i> seriously.\" Gull kept a straight face. Mortil\
  \ studied him, and slowly nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"Very well, I take my leave.\" Rising,\
  \ Mortil added, \"I hope to hear a tale of woe upon the morning.\"</p> \n    <p>Gull\
  \ opened the door. \"Woe's the word.\"</p> \n    <p>Mortil shot him a grave look\
  \ and departed.</p> \n    <p>\"Well, Cloak,\" Gull muttered, once he was alone.\
  \ \"It seems we have a choice. Disappoint Cheliax and the hordes of Hell. Or assassinate\
  \ Admiral Kasaba.\"</p> \n    <p>He stroked his chin and came to a firm conclusion.</p>\
