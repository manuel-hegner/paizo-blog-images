  \ <blockquote> \n   <h1>Sound the Guns of Alkenstar</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\
  >Wednesday, December 15, 2010</p> \n   <p>One of the great things about being an\
  \ editor at Paizo is not just working with some of the best new folks in the gaming\
  \ industry, but also having the opportunity to approach some of the best <i>old-school</i>\
  \ folks, those writers and designers who influenced you as a young gamer, or whose\
  \ imagination set a stage that now feels too large and organic to have ever been\
  \ created from whole cloth.</p> \n   <p>Ed Greenwood is one of the latter. While\
  \ still very much a public figure in the fantasy world, continuing to publish novels\
  \ in a variety of worlds, Ed will forever be known as the man who created the Forgotten\
  \ Realms. It was from the depths of his brain that the world got one of the longest-lived\
  \ and most vibrant settings ever to come to gaming (not to mention the highly recognizable\
  \ character of Elminster, who looks suspiciously like Ed himself). For decades,\
  \ Ed's creations have inspired novels, video games, comic books—and, of course,\
  \ RPG products.</p> \n   <p>And now that same creativity has been trained on Golarion.\
  \ While we've worked with Ed in the past, particularly on the Kingmaker Adventure\
  \ Path, I was particularly pleased to invite him on board to do some web fiction\
  \ for us—in this case, an extra-long tale of murder and intrigue that starts today\
  \ and is set to run for the next six weeks. Knowing Ed's particular talent for breathing\
  \ life into a region, we were also happy to temporarily turn over the keys to one\
  \ of our most frequently asked-about nations: the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, that\
  \ tenuous holding deep in the Mana Wastes where magic is shaky at best, and a relatively\
  \ new invention called gunpowder attempts to usher in a whole new era in warfare,\
  \ even as its inventors cling tightly to the secret of its manufacture.</p> \n \
  \  <p><a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial\">Click here</a> to follow Ed on his journey\
  \ down into the strange and dangerous world of Alkenstar's Gunworks, trailing along\
  \ in the shadows of those elite investigators who maintain the region's delicate\
  \ balance...</p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
