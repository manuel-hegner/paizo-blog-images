  There Are More Things In Heaven and Earth...\"</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ June 25, 2008</p> \n   <p>In the past few weeks we've talked and teased a lot\
  \ about what's in the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ic\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ Campaign Setting</i></a> hardcover. There have been mentions of peoples and races\
  \ and countries and organizations, but what's beyond that? In fact, what's beyond\
  \ Golarion? Does \"campaign setting\" have to mean just one land, one world, one\
  \ planet? Or might it mean a whole reality?</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ic\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a> tackles just that question. Personally,\
  \ I've always been fascinated with planeswalking, and my favorite adventures usually\
  \ take place in realms beyond the mortal world... and I think James wrote something\
  \ about a demon once somewhere. It also turns out that the credits for this monster\
  \ feature Todd Stewart, a modern expert and the go-to guy for fantasy cosmologies.\
  \ So we got Todd to tackle a new take on the realms beyond the mortal plane. Welcome\
  \ to the Great Beyond.</p> \n   <p>Chapter 3 of the <i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign\
  \ Setting</i> delves into the realities beyond reality, the domains of the gods,\
  \ and the organization of the spheres. Aside from deities both familiar and new,\
  \ there are discussions of new races, non-godly powers fit for worship, musings\
  \ on planar dragons, a complete map of the spheres, and details on more than a dozen\
  \ planes (each an entire realm brimming with planar adventure). Looking through\
  \ the chapter, a few tantalizing headers scroll by: \"Norgorber: The Reaper of Reputation,\"\
  \ \"Sivanah: The Seventh Veil,\" \"Thirteen Demon Lords,\" \"Six Empyreal Lords,\"\
  \ \"The Whispering Way,\" \"The Maelstrom\"â€”the list goes on and on. In fact, for\
  \ all you planeswalkers out there, here's a taste:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>The\
  \ Maelstrom/Limbo</b><br> Collectively referred to as the Maelstrom, vast swathes\
  \ of uncharted, unclaimed terrain borders and surrounds each of the Outer Planes.\
  \ Mysterious and dangerous wild lands untouched by the gods, these regions lack\
  \ the cohesive stability present in all of the other planes; even the hellish depths\
  \ of the Abyss possess a structure that the Maelstrom does not. Rather than some\
  \ ever-changing sea of randomness, when viewed from the edge of another plane, the\
  \ Maelstrom appears much like that of its adjacent neighbor. The differences grow\
  \ more profound further away from the stabilizing anchor of the borderlands, eventually\
  \ falling back into the mutable freedom of perpetual change. The Maelstrom defies\
  \ the efforts of mapmakers, as its very character shifts and flows like the tide\
  \ of an unseen ocean, to which the borderlands are but shores and calm shallows.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Crystalline forests melt like candle wax into shallow brine seas\
  \ with jewel-like icebergs, and then sublimate to vast parched deserts, all within\
  \ the stretch of days. Still, islands of stability do exist within the depths of\
  \ the Maelstrom. These islands are ruled by petty gods, exiled fiends, and fallen\
  \ celestials, and even the rare stronghold of a mortal wizard or priest-king can\
  \ be found holding itself against the metaphysical lapping tide. </p> \n    <p>Creatures\
  \ wandering in from the structured planes, long since grown native, populate the\
  \ Maelstrom's borderlands, often possessing characteristics and behaviors at odds\
  \ from their origins. Deeper still, chaos beasts, chaos incarna, and the mysterious\
  \ serpentine proteans thrive within an environment of plastic potentiality. Claiming\
  \ to be the first children of the Outer Planes, the keketar, imentesh, and naunet\
  \ proteans worship godlike beings they refer to as the Speakers From the Depths,\
  \ whom scholars speculate to be something akin to a pair of conjoined gods or a\
  \ single dualistic entity. </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>The <i>Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ Campaign Setting</i> hardcover and several infinities worth of new adventures\
  \ hits shelves this August!</p> \n   <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> Pathfinder Managing\
