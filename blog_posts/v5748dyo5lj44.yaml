  /products/btpy9l3e\"><em>Warpriest Class Deck</em></a>. As the song reminds us,\
  \ warpriests are good for <i>absolutely everything</i>. While we all know the iconic\
  \ paladin Seelah is objectively <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhdj\">the best character\
  \ ever</a>, what you might not know is that my favorite character is actually not\
  \ Seelah, but rather Oloch. In fact, I love <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/classes/warpriest.html\"\
  >warpriests</a> across the board. Let's meet some now!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up is Oloch. In <a href=\"/products/btpy92zk\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a>, Oloch combined solid combat and seafaring skills with\
  \ strong support powers. A devout Gorumite, our new take on Oloch here is more self-reliant,\
  \ perhaps even a little bit selfish. My guide for this character was a line from\
  \ his <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg6s\">Meet the Iconics post</a>: \"Oloch is\
  \ a quiet, brooding warrior with a disturbing love of violence.\"</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochBack_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>\"...relishing the red rush of battle...\"</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>This Oloch shows a personal take on the minor blessing power, but if you\
  \ need aid in a fight, he can contribute some divine aid—or just charge into the\
  \ fray himself. During playtesting, our phrase for this Oloch was \"Gorum helps\
  \ those who beat the crap out of things.\"</p> \n    <p>Next up is the forgepriest\
  \ Amli Faldar. We found Amli in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting book <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9aue\"><em>Belkzen, Hold of the Orc Hordes</em></a>. Amli is a follower\
  \ of Kols the Oath-Keeper, the dwarven demigod of duty.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-AmliBack_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>The hammer is also named Oathkeeper.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>As\
  \ a member of the Oathkeepers, Amli adds dwarven toughness and Craft to Melee and\
  \ Divine skills. She's good at using both weapons and armor, and she can help others\
  \ who do so as well.</p> \n    <p>Finally we see Uliah Muharim, a charismatic member\
  \ of the Wagons of Light, a group secretly working to combat the undead. We found\
  \ Uliah in the Pathfinder Player Companion book <a href=\"/products/btpy9h7x\"><em>Black\
  \ Markets</em></a>. Like many in the Wagons of Light, Uliah is a devotee of Sarenrae,\
  \ the Everlight.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahBack_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Shown here NOT in disguise...</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Uliah\
  \ is our most divine-focused warpriest character, and is also the best with allies,\
  \ especially mounts. Our hope with Uliah is that you will enjoy having him charge\
  \ around from location to location, and so will everyone else in your party.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For this class deck, we're trying a few new things. We've added some\
  \ boons for each character's deity. For Gorum, we added a series of spiked armor\
  \ cards, reflecting the favor of Our Lord in Iron. For Kols Son of Torag, we added\
  \ a series of hammers, weapons that aid in crafting. For Sarenrae, we added a variety\
  \ of healing and anti-undead powers, and also a theme built around mount allies.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-SpikedBreastplate.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-SpikedBreastplate_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Look at all the holy candles...</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Another\
  \ new concept in this class deck has to do with deities' favored weapons and a new\
  \ concept for cards list powers. The idea came from various attempts to make the\
  \ favored weapons available to the characters even though they aren't—and shouldn't\
  \ be—Basic cards. On the cards list side of each character card, in the area where\
  \ a cohort might be listed, we have a new instruction. For example, Amli's is <i>You\
  \ may treat 1 copy of the weapon Warhammer as if it says \"Owner: Amli.\"</i> This\
  \ is somewhat like a character power, but it applies only during deckbuilding and\
  \ rebuilding. Using this technique, we can give Oloch a Greatsword, Amli a Warhammer,\
  \ and Uliah a Scimitar.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Warhammer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Warhammer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Scimitar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Scimitar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>A trio of starting weapons—in the right hands.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>We might adopt this concept to other uses in the future. For game designers,\
  \ this is interesting new space, a way to smooth over some rough edges and also\
  \ add some fun new knobs and levers, without adding more powers to an already crowded\
  \ powers list. One thing that's key to this idea is that it's \"fire and forget\"\
  —you use it when you need to see the cards list, but you <i>don't</i> need to look\
  \ at it when you're playing a scenario. Please try this out and let us know what\
  \ you think!</p> \n    <p>One final note. Those PACG players who like to dig into\
  \ the background of these characters might recognize some names from the Pathfinder\
  \ resources mentioned here. When we were looking for existing warpriests to inspire\
  \ the class deck characters, we found several potential examples. When we discovered\
  \ that both Ron Lundeen and Tyler Beck had (independently) worked on some, we knew\
  \ we'd found our characters. Special thanks to both Ron and Tyler for inspiring\
  \ the characters and for playtesting and feedback on these (and many, many other)\
  \ parts of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—and thanks again to all of our amazing\
  \ fans, playtesters, players, and contributors!</p> \n    <p>Chad Brown<br> <i>Adventure\
