  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Before I turn you over to Starfinder Society\
  \ developer Thurston Hillman for a peek at May's scenarios, I'd like to highlight\
  \ a couple upcoming non-US conventions other staffers and I are attending.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Also, we are pleased Michael's blog last week about sanctioning the the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9nry?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-109-In-Search-of-Sanity\"\
  >Strange Aeons Adventure Path </a>was so well received. While there was a slight\
  \ glitch in the pdf attachment process, it was resolved and you can now download\
  \ the sanctioning documents from the link above.</p> \n    <p>I've spent the past\
  \ few weeks previewing convention offerings at PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con. This\
  \ week, let's take a peek at a conventions outside the United States. For those\
  \ of you in the area, you can find lots of gaming goodness the to 1st to 3rd of\
  \ June at the United Kingdom Games Expo in Birmingham, England . A group of Paizo\
  \ staffers joins the local Organized Play community to bring lots of Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder options.</p> \n    <p>Come take a sneak peek at the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest by visiting the Paizo booth in the NEC Exhibition Hall. Space is limited,\
  \ so be sure to visit early and secure a place. Meanwhile, the Hilton Ballrooms\
  \ play host to a cornucopia of organized play offerings, including the European\
  \ premier of the next installment of the modular interactive special <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899B-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99C: The Solstice Scar, version C</em></a> on\
  \ Saturday night. For more information on this scenario, see this week's <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5lksy?Deception-Betrayal-Redemption\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario preview blog</a>.</p> \n    <p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/\"\
  >UK Games Expo website</a> to get a badge and sign up for events. We have a bunch\
  \ of Paizo staffers, including Amanda Hamon Kunz, Cosmo Eisele, Dan Tharp, Erik\
  \ Mona, Jason Bulmahn, Jeff Alvarez, and myself, flying in for the event and we\
  \ hope to see you there!</p> \n    <p>If UK Games Expo doesn't work into your schedule,\
  \ consider attending PaizoCon UK July 20th-22nd at the Aston University Campus in\
  \ Birmingham, UK. Come join designer Logan Bonner and I, along with UK and European\
  \ venture-officers, in celebrating the 10th anniversary of PaizoCon UK by playing\
  \ games, talking about your characters, and enjoying some English hospitality. I'll\
  \ write more about this event in a few weeks, but you can get a jump on planning\
  \ by visiting <a href=\"http://paizocon.co.uk/index.php/10-newsflash/150-paizocon-uk-2017\"\
  >their website</a>!</p> \n    <p>With all the upcoming conventions, we need new\
  \ scenarios. I'm turning you over to Thurston as he catalogs the delights instore\
  \ for Starfinder Society players this month.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Wow,\
  \ it's already coming up on <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon </a>season! When it came\
  \ time to plan out the two scenarios the Organized Play Team knew would take the\
  \ first salvo of \"convention season\", we wanted to focus on some less conventional\
  \ scenario archetypes.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180525-Carmine.jpg\"\

  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!!!</em></a> is an experience!\
  \ Anything I could say about it would spoil that experience. I can say that it brings\
  \ together a lot of things that people have enjoyed about our inaugural Starfinder\
  \ Society season in a fun and exciting way. OK, fine, I can also say that it begins\
  \ right before the sugar pop sensation, Strawberry Machine Cake, is set to perform\
  \ a debut concert for their new album. Paizo's own Eleanor Ferron, the creator of\
  \ Strawberry Machine Cake, exceeded even my ridiculous expectations when she wrote\
  \ this scenario. I look forward to seeing the fan reaction to this.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ scenario has the Faction (Dataphiles) and Faction (Exo-Guardians) tags.</p> \n\
  \     <p>If this month's first scenario tells us anything, it's that the Organized\
  \ Play Team can be swayed by fan reactions. Our next scenario continues this trend.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Pathfinder Society veteran author, Andrew Hoskins, is notorious for\
  \ scenarios such as <a href=\"/products/btpy9ch2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-18-From-Under-Ice\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #6-17: From Under Ice</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9huy?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-17-Thralls-of-the-Shattered-God\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #7-17: Thralls of the Shattered God</em></a>, and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9oik?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-807-From-the-Tome-of-Righteous-Repose\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #8-07: Tome of Righteous Repose</em></a>. He approached\
  \ me last year about writing for Starfinder Society and I was happy to bring him\
  \ onboard with a new scenario. What he received was an idea madly brewed in a cauldron\
  \ of ideas floating around the Organized Play Team. Of course, Andrew being the\
  \ stellar author that he is, ran with our somewhat abnormal outline.</p> \n    \

  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-15: Save the Renkrodas</em></a> differentiates itself\
  \ from our other May scenario by having a space dinosaur. Ok, Ok… the space the\
  \ dinosaur is technically an alien lifeform called a renkroda (first detailed in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve\"\
  ><em>Temple of the Twelve</em></a>, written by Organized Play Lead Developer John\
  \ Compton. So while there was certainly already some love for renkrodas on the team,\
  \ it wasn't until a <b>particularly dedicated</b> volunteer (who we'll be highlighting\
  \ in next month's scenario preview) began espousing some detailed renkroda-related\
  \ lore on social media, that we realized the time was right for a scenario.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This scenario has the Faction (Acquisitives) and a new Vehicle tag that\
  \ denotes the presence of a vehicle-related encounter.</p> \n     <p>That's it for\
  \ this month's preview. In June, you'll get to see a whole bunch of previews for\
  \ scenarios debuting at our season launch at Origins Game Fair. For those of you\
  \ attending PaizoCon this weekend in Seattle, feel free to come up and say hello!\
  \ I'm on the Starfinder Society Organized Play panel on Friday and roaming the venue\
  \ throughout the whole weekend.</p> \n     <p>Either way, have a happy week of gaming!</p>\
