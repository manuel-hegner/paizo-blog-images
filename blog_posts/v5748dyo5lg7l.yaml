  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Lucien Soulban</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: The Rat\
  \ Race</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >\"Run!\" Darvin screamed. Behind them, the wall of rats fell over each other as\
  \ they raced along the partially submerged sewer ledge.</span></p> \n     <p>\"\
  I am running!\" Fife said, his small arms pumping.</p> \n     <p>\"Run like a human!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I'm faster than you!\" Fife retorted. \"My strides are shorter!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Darvin struggled to stay on his feet, the wet bricks slick, the runoff\
  \ from the storm chasing a hard course through the tunnels and spraying everything\
  \ in a shower of sewage. He heard Fife stumble, but when he looked back, the halfling\
  \ was already back on his feet, the rats half a dozen feet behind.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Why... are we always... running... down corridors?\" Fife huffed. \"The hands, now\
  \ rats. Heroes don't flee.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We aren't heroes!\" Darvin shouted\
  \ back. \"At best we're unwilling appetizers.\" He searched, trying to find some\
  \ escape from the roiling mass of vermin on their heels. The swarm would soon run\
  \ them down. It wasn't just that the rats were faster (they were in spurts). Or\
  \ that there were so many (there were). It was that, as rats fell back, more scampered\
  \ forward, always gaining on them.</p> \n     <p>Then there was the large one that\
  \ ran in their midst, the one the size of a dog, urging them on with a grating,\
  \ high-pitched screech and blood-red eyes.</p> \n     <p>The passageway narrowed,\
  \ the ledge thinning, and Darvin saw a glimmer of hope. The rats had gained and\
  \ were now a handful of feet behind them. Darvin slowed a step, just long enough\
  \ to grab Fife by the collar and the belt...</p> \n     <p>\"Hey!\"</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TideOfBlood_Darvin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TideOfBlood_Darvin_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Darvin doesn't mind his half-brother's stories—\n\
  \      <br>as long as they're made up. \n     </div> \n     <p>...and heaved his\
  \ half-brother across the seven-foot-wide sewer torrent. Fife screeched and landed\
  \ on the opposite ledge just as Darvin ran another couple of steps to the edge.\
  \ Several rats jumped onto his back, trying to bite through the wet wool cloak,\
  \ but Darvin leaped with a roar.</p> \n     <p>He struck water, his hands scrabbling\
  \ across the ledge, the rapids pulling him down the tunnel.</p> \n     <p>\"Not\
  \ again!\"</p> \n     <p>Fife raced to grab his hand, but water pulled Darvin with\
  \ angry strength, too quickly for the halfling. Inches separated their outstretched\
  \ hands, then a foot, and then another. In desperation, Fife slid forward, swinging\
  \ out with his rucksack. Darvin caught the bag, fingers clenched around fabric with\
  \ an aching ferocity.</p> \n     <p>\"Ow, ow, ow, ow!\" Fife said. The sewer waters\
  \ pulled Darvin along, and bounced Fife across the slimy bricks.</p> \n     <p>At\
  \ this rate, Darvin realized, Fife would end up in the foul drink in a matter of\
  \ yards where the tunnel turned to the right. \"Dig in with your monkey feet!\"\
  \ he said.</p> \n     <p>Fife grunted something that may have been in pain or in\
  \ insult. The halfling tucked his body into a fetal position, slowing them both\
  \ down as the yards slimmed to inches. </p> \n     <p>Darvin grabbed the ledge at\
  \ the corner of the turn, and Fife helped him back up to solid ground.</p> \n  \
  \   <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>\"We need to stop meeting like this.\"\
  \ Darvin lay on his back, panting hard as Fife looked around.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ pack of rats watched them from the opposite ledge. They acted restless, but the\
  \ leader kept its beady red eyes on the two humanoids. There was something unpleasant\
  \ in its gaze, something profoundly angry and vicious. Fife couldn't stop staring,\
  \ until finally, the king rat lifted its head and uttered a series of angry squeaks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What did you say?\" Darvin asked, sitting up.</p> \n     <p>\"That\
  \ wasn't me, you idiot.\" Fife nodded at the rats.</p> \n     <p>\"Ah, yes,\" Darvin\
  \ said, calling out to them. \"Are the four-legged fiends at a loss? Has their dinner\
  \ outwitted them?\"</p> \n     <p>The king rat snarled and squeaked louder. The\
  \ rats broke into two packs, half going back the way they had come, the other half\
  \ scurrying up the passageway and around the corner.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh dear,\"\
  \ Fife said. \"I think they're looking to outflank us.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah,\" Darvin\
  \ said. \"Tactics. That's... upsetting. Run?\"</p> \n     <p>\"That would be best.\"\
  \ Fife helped his brother up as the packs vanished in opposite directions. \"It's\
  \ just...\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm tired of running. Aren't\
  \ you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm surprisingly good at it,\" Darvin replied.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"That's the problem. So am I.\"</p> \n     <p>Darvin looked down at his\
  \ half-brother and sighed. \"What do you propose?\"</p> \n     <p>\"We turn the\
  \ tables.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>They followed the\
  \ water flow, crossing wood bridges over the smaller passages. Of the rats or their\
  \ king, they saw no sign; the ledges and corridors created a maze.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Turn the tables how?\" Darvin asked, when he realized his half-brother had never\
  \ added anything.</p> \n     <p>Fife looked up at him, a flicker of surprise in\
  \ his face.</p> \n     <p>\"Do you even have a plan?\" Darvin asked.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"I had an idea,\" Fife admitted.</p> \n     <p>\"I hear an 'if.' Or a 'but.'\
  \ Maybe a 'well.'\"</p> \n     <p>\"Well...\"</p> \n     <p>\"There it is.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I came up with one plan,\" Fife said, \"but we don't have a wheel\
  \ of cheese.\"</p> \n     <p>\"In this situation, we <i>are</i> the wheel of cheese,\"\
  \ Darvin said.</p> \n     <p>\"And then I thought about trapping them in a large\
  \ maze.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We are the ones <i>in</i> the maze?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Are you suggesting that we're the rats?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm not that profound.\
  \ I think the sewers are getting to you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And then I thought, why\
  \ aren't the sewers flooded?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Aren't they?\" The waters that sloshed\
  \ at Darvin's feet were a good inch above his soles, and he could barely feel his\
  \ cold toes.</p> \n     <p>\"For the amount of rain we've had? The water's being\
  \ dammed up somewhere and that's causing the streets to flood.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  The knife gate,\" Darvin suggested.</p> \n     <p>\"That's at the lowest point of\
  \ the sewers. The flooding would back up, not—\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, thank you,\"\
  \ Darvin said. \"I have a general understanding of slopes and how they work.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>They arrived at an intersection and Fife looked up and down its length.\
  \ He smiled and waggled a finger for Darvin to follow. After a few minutes of this,\
  \ Darvin realized what he was doing. \"You're heading up.\"</p> \n     <p>Fife nodded.\
  \ \"I'm following the streams with the smallest flows.\"</p> \n     <p>\"To find\
  \ the blockage. Look, if adventurers failed, with a wizard no less, why don't we\
  \ just find a way out?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Why escape when we could undam the sewer,\
  \ wash away the rats, and get paid in the process?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Hold,\" Darvin\
  \ said, putting his hand on Fife's shoulder. \"We're getting paid for this? Why\
  \ didn't you say so?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I didn't need to,\" Fife said. \"'We have\
  \ a deal' means 'we get something in the exchange.'\"</p> \n     <p>\"Did you negotiate\
  \ for the rest of your missing height?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I bargained for a smarter\
  \ brother.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I guess we both came up short.\"</p> \n     <p>Fife\
  \ punched Darvin in the thigh. From off in the distance came the echo of a rat squeak.\
  \ Fife hesitated, then started jogging. He kept looking back, the sound of the rats\
  \ growing louder, and Darvin knew he had to keep his fretting half-brother preoccupied.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"I don't know with you anymore,\" Darvin said. \"You seem intent\
  \ on jumping into danger. Well... hopping in your case.\"</p> \n     <p> \"There's\
  \ nothing wrong with trying to be the hero,\" Fife said, huffing.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  But we're not heroes.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We could be,\" Fife said.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  And the payment? Is that what heroes do?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Only to disguise their\
  \ noble intentions. Besides—never mind,\" Fife said, his expression sullen.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What?\" Darvin asked.</p> \n     <p>\"It's just... I know you'll never\
  \ come on adventures with me unless there's money to be made! Or a chance to meet\
  \ a plump woman.\"</p> \n     <p>In response, Darvin reached down and punched Fife\
  \ in the shoulder, almost hard enough to send him into the water.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  What was that for?!\" Fife snapped.</p> \n     <p>\"Coin is nice, and plump women\
  \ are better,\" Darvin said. \"But you're my brother. You think I'd let you go on\
  \ an adventure alone?\"</p> \n     <p>\"So you punched me because you love me?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I punched you because you made me say it.\"</p> \n     <p>The rat\
  \ squeaks grew louder from somewhere behind them, but Darvin saw none of the red-eyed\
  \ vermin, just rain water rushing off into the darkness. Fife paused at another\
  \ intersection of sewer tunnels. The larger passage on their right angled up, the\
  \ water diminished. They took it.</p> \n     <p>\"You <i>love</i> me,\" Fife said,\
  \ almost singing.</p> \n     <p>\"Don't make it a thing,\" Darvin said. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Behind them, the sound of rats grew louder, but at least Fife wore a grin.\
  \ It was all too easy for the halfling to get lost in the needs of the world, without\
  \ sharing in its joy. That's why he needed Darvin. </p> \n     <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Fife did his best to ignore the skittering of nails on brick.\
  \ Beside him, Darvin followed his lead, tracking the trickle of water back to the\
  \ blockage. </p> \n     <p>That was good. It was all too easy for Darvin to distance\
  \ himself from the world, to ignore it and go about his own affairs. Fife liked\
  \ to believe that Darvin was better than he thought of himself; all he needed was\
  \ a little encouragement to perform outside his own narrow motives. Fife could provide\
  \ that incentive.</p> \n     <p>Fife glanced back and caught a hint of movement\
  \ deep in the darkness, perhaps a foot beyond the limits of his vision. The shadows\
  \ along the ground squirmed, though that could have been the water. He nudged Darvin,\
  \ and without another word, the pair jogged more quickly.</p> \n     <p>The ten-foot-wide\
  \ sewer passage angled up and ended at a large tunnel. This new avenue stretched\
  \ wider than the others, to nearly twenty feet, with a low arched ceiling and small\
  \ side feeders angling off sharply at intervals. The slope grew more pronounced,\
  \ the water a thick ribbon down the center trough and still too little for the rains\
  \ and flood.</p> \n     <p>\"The portway drain,\" Fife said. When Darvin glanced\
  \ at him, he explained. \"The portway runs the river's length and links the mills\
  \ to the river port. If this is blocked...\"</p> \n     <p>Darvin nodded, and Fife\
  \ led them upward. The rats gained, however, untiring in their advance. By the time\
  \ the pair had crowned the sloped passage, the rats were within sight, as was the\
  \ dam of splintered timbers, dislodged topsoil, and nests of roots. It blocked the\
  \ passage save for the water leaking through the imperfect plug.</p> \n     <p>Standing\
  \ before the blockage of castoff stood the half-orc assassin. He'd been examining\
  \ the dam and the water cascading over the embankment, but he turned at the sound\
  \ of their steps. His expression of surprise lasted but a moment, then gave way\
  \ to a sharp-toothed smile. Behind Darvin and Fife, the rats ran and screeched up\
  \ the slope. A glance back told Fife they were less than fifty feet back, their\
  \ bodies nearly indistinguishable in the writhing mass, but for their eyes and yellowed\
  \ incisors.</p> \n     <p>The brothers shared a glance and Fife knew immediately\
  \ what his brother was thinking. They were finally in familiar waters.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Oh, look,\" Fife said. \"It's our favorite assassin.\"</p> \n     <p> The\
  \ half-orc casually pulled his cloak open, revealing the glint of daggers. \"No\
  \ escape this time.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, about that,\" Fife said, \"we've picked\
  \ up something along the way.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Vermin,\" Darvin said.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"A plague really.\"</p> \n     <p>\"A plague of vermin.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Isn't that redundant?\"</p> \n     <p>The rats were thirty feet back and the excitement\
  \ of blood drove them faster. </p> \n     <p>\"Can you say vermin of plague?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I—don't think so,\" Fife admitted.</p> \n     <p>\"Then I guess it\
  \ isn't redundant.\" </p> \n     <p>\"Enough babbling. Why do you keep looking ba—\
  what are those?\" the half-orc asked, noticing the swell of rats that had cleared\
  \ the slope of the tunnel.</p> \n     <p>\"The plague of vermin,\" Darvin said,\
  \ not bothering to look back.</p> \n     <p>\"They're with us,\" Fife said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Charge!\" Darvin screamed, and the half-brothers bolted forward.</p>\
