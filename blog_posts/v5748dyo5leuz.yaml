  \  <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Ever since we divulged which factions would\
  \ disappear, the forums have been humming with speculation, questions, and clarifications\
  \ about exactly how the whole faction retirement process will work. In brief overview,\
  \ we are removing two factions from the available options for Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play. These factions are not necessarily disappearing from the face\
  \ of Golarion, but for a variety of reasons they are withdrawing their direct involvement\
  \ in the Pathfinder Society. Two new scenarios, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8we1\"\
  ><i>#4-21 Way of the Kirin</i></a> and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8we3\"\
  ><i>#4-23 Rivalry's End</i></a>, allow Lantern Lodge and Shadow Lodge faction PCs\
  \ respectively the opportunity to play through their factions' conclusions. Of course,\
  \ anyone can play these scenarios, but there's a special something waiting for members\
  \ of the above factions. On August 14th, whether a person has played the scenarios\
  \ or not, the two factions will be removed, and all existing Lantern Lodge and Shadow\
  \ Lodge characters will have to switch factions.</span></p> \n    <p>Allow me to\
  \ provide a compiled list of answers for as many of the many questions as I can.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Can I play a pregenerated character and get credit?</b> <br> According\
  \ to the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><i>Pathfinder Society Guide to Organized\
  \ Play</i></a>, pregenerated characters are treated as members of the Grand Lodge.\
  \ As a result, playing a pregenerated character does not grant a player access to\
  \ the faction-specific boon.</p> \n    <p><b>I have a Lantern Lodge character who\
  \ is 8th level or higher. Shouldn't I have an opportunity to experience my faction's\
  \ conclusion?</b><br> We are allowing GMs to do something special for these two\
  \ scenarios. Anyone who GMs the scenario can apply the sheet to a character of level\
  \ 8+ even though the character would not normally be eligible to receive credit.\
  \ This Chronicle sheet includes the experience point, Prestige Points, items, and\
  \ gold for Subtier-6â€“7. </p> \n    <p><b>My Lantern Lodge or Shadow Lodge character\
  \ is not yet level 3. What happens if I assign him GM credit before August 14th?</b><br>\
  \ Follow the normal rules for assigning a Chronicle sheet to a character from GMing;\
  \ the Chronicle sheet is held until the character reaches a high enough level to\
  \ qualify for earning the Chronicle sheet. The key difference is that the character's\
  \ faction might change by the time the Chronicle sheet kicks into effect. If the\
  \ character does not reach 3rd level by August 14th, the character will no longer\
  \ be a member of the Lantern Lodge or Shadow Lodge and will no longer qualify for\
  \ the faction-specific boon(s).</p> \n    <p><b>What happens if my Lantern Lodge\
  \ or Shadow Lodge character doesn't play the scenario before August 14th?</b><br>\
  \ Your character will receive the free faction change on August 14th but no other\
  \ benefits. The character must choose a new legal faction the first time he plays\
  \ a scenario on or after that date.</p> \n    <p>Happy pathfinding,</p> \n    <p>John\
