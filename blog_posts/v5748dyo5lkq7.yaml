  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, we announced the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker\">Kingmaker set</a> of Pathfinder\
  \ Battles pre-painted miniatures and the associated case incentive figures: <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya12e?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker-Earth-Water-Elementals\">Huge earth\
  \ and water elementals</a>. But they don't come out until October! What will fans\
  \ of elementals do until then?</p> \n    <p>Fear not, valiant Pathfinders, for our\
  \ partners at WizKids have you covered with their next wave of Pathfinder Battles\
  \ Deep Cuts unpainted plastic miniatures! Due out in July, these non-randomized\
  \ figures are pre-primed with Acrylicos Vallejo primer, making them ready to paint\
  \ straight out of the box. The preview images in this blog show digital renders\
  \ of both the unpainted sculpt and a sample paint scheme to serve as inspiration.\
  \ Each 2-piece blister pack comes with two copies of the same figure, in the same\
  \ pose, so you can easily build an army of identical elemental warriors, or paint\
  \ variant versions of the same figure.</p> \n    <p>First among this wave's elementals\
  \ is the <a href=\"/products/btpya14y?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Earth-Elemental\"\
  >Medium earth elemental</a>. Pathfinder Battles fans will recognize this sculpt\
  \ as a boulder-throwing variant of the similarly named (and out of print) figure\
  \ from the Shattered Star set from way back in 2013. Just like the sample paint\
  \ scheme illustrated here, that figure had granite and emerald coloration, but this\
  \ figure's unpainted finish means you can customize your earth elemental to fit\
  \ whatever setting you want! Need a desert elemental? Paint it a tan, sandstone\
  \ color with topaz or turquiose accents. Is your party facing an earth elemental\
  \ on a tropical, volcanic island? Paint its body black, with ruby accents. And if\
  \ it's especially lava-bound, try putting bright orange or yellow in the cracks\
  \ of its body to give it a magma glow (see the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ao4?Pathfinder-Battles-2014-Promotional-Figure-Lava-Lurker\"\
  >lava lurker promotional figure</a> for inspiration).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180423-MediumEarth.jpg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>Next we have the <a href=\"/products/btpya150?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Water-Elemental\"\
  >Medium water elemental</a>, again varying up the pose of the similarly named (and\
  \ out of print) figure from Shattered Star. Composed of clear plastic, the figure\
  \ maintains the sense of transparency that makes water elemental figures so much\
  \ fun to use at the table. Whether you want a clear blue elemental from tropical\
  \ waters, or a muddy, murky gray or brown from a swamp or sewer, this figure can\
  \ be customized with a thin ink wash. If you're using a pre-existing map, like a\
  \ Pathfinder Flip-Mat, you can even paint the mini to match the color of whatever\
  \ body of water it's going to rise out of in your game! Give it an appearance of\
  \ being icy or particularly roiling with some white dry-brushing to make the whorls\
  \ and wave caps really pop.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180423-MediumWater.jpg\">\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>What good is a water elemental if there isn't a fire elemental\
  \ for it to quench? The <a href=\"/products/btpya151?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Fire-Elemental\"\
  >Medium fire elemental</a> is—you guessed it—a resculpt of the Shattered Star figure\
  \ of the same name. Also composed of clear plastic, this figure can be customized\
  \ with a variety of shades of red, orange, and yellow for traditional flames, or\
  \ other colors like green and blue for more supernatural elementals summoned by\
  \ strange rituals or specialized spellcasters. You can even give the figure a smoky\
  \ look with a dry-brushing of sooty black.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180423-MediumFire.jpg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>And that's it. Just three elementals.</p> \n    <p>Nah, I'm\
  \ just kidding. Of course there's a <a href=\"/products/btpya14z?Pathfinder-Deep-Cuts-Unpainted-Miniatures-Medium-Air-Elemental\"\
  >Medium air elemental</a> to complete the set. One of the best things about this\
  \ figure is that you can use it straight out of the box without getting your brushes\
  \ dirty as any number of invisible air creatures. If you are looking to paint it,\
  \ however, the clear plastic again allows for a lot of variety with different ink\
  \ washes. Cool blues or pale whites can capture the brisk chill of a winter breeze,\
  \ while darker colors like gray or even black can give the swirling elemental the\
  \ look of a raging tornado. With a bit more customization, you can attach small\
  \ green or brown \"leaves\" to the figure's surface to represent the detritus sucked\
  \ up into the whirlwind in forested or autumnal settings.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  >\n    </div> \n    <p>While this is our first Deep Cuts blog, these are far from\
  \ the first figures in the line, with dozens already in the wild in your local game\
  \ store or here on paizo.com. Rather than go back and show off these unpainted figures,\
  \ I'd rather give the community the chance to show off your finished Deep Cuts from\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/deepCuts\">myriad figures we've previously released</a>.\
  \ Post your painted Pathfinder Battles Deep Cuts figures on Facebook, Instagram,\
  \ or Twitter with the hashtag #PathfinderBattles and tag the official accounts for\
  \ Paizo and WizKids, and we'll collect and show off our favorites in a future blog.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Next week we'll examine the wave's batch of gnome spellcasters. The \"\
  shortlist,\" if you will. Until then, keep your paintbrushes wet.</p> \n    <p>Mark\
