| summary  = Wolf Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance. Requirements: You are unarmored. You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
If youâ€™re flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait.
