  \ new holiday boon! Developer Adam Daigle was so excited when he detailed <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le20?Evoking-Day\">Evoking Day</a> last month that I was able\
  \ to rope... err... convince him to write a second holiday post for Pathfinder Society.\
  \ This time, Adam took the original work regarding Crystalhue, written by Crystal\
  \ Frasier in <a href=\"/products/v5748btpy8dar\">Wayfinder #2</a>, and expanded\
  \ on it. The holiday of Crystalhue is also mentioned on page 249 of <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</i>. You will find a special Pathfinder\
  \ Society Chronicle sheet you can download and apply to a Pathfinder Society character\
  \ during the date ranges noted on the sheet.</span></p> \n     <blockquote> \n \
  \     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n       <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9202-Shelyn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9202-Shelyn_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n       <br>Illustration by Eva Widermann\n      </div> \n      <p>During\
  \ the day, in towns where the holiday of Crystalhue is celebrated, locals hang crystal\
  \ prisms and glass baubles throughout town in order to spread light and scatter\
  \ rainbows in the streets. As townsfolk prepare for the evening festivities, artisans\
  \ and musicians ply their trades, hoping for a coin or two while they sell their\
  \ crafts and play tunes for the people while they browse. Throughout the day, the\
  \ locals exchange small gifts, typically handmade, as tokens of appreciation or\
  \ as peace offerings to those they feel they wronged during the year.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>To reflect artistic depictions of their patron goddess, women dye colored\
  \ streaks in their hair. Young girls will commonly have half a dozen different colored\
  \ locks, while older married women usually only have one or two. Men wear colorful\
  \ patchwork coats they call melaros that they keep their whole lives, adding new\
  \ patches or scraps of scavenged cloth every year.</p> \n      <p>As night falls,\
  \ the community gathers every available lantern and candle, bringing them out onto\
  \ porches or lining the streets with their communal light. The town square hosts\
  \ a large feast around a bonfire complete with roasted meats, stewed vegetables,\
  \ roasted root vegetables, and winter squashes—all seasoned with plenty of fragrant\
  \ spices. Around these bonfires, the clergy of Shelyn perform marriage ceremonies,\
  \ where the whole community gathers to witness and affirm the bonds of love. During\
  \ the ceremonies, teenagers pursue their budding romances, giving trinkets and other\
  \ symbols of their affection to the ones who caught their eye throughout the year.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>One of the stranger traditions among the faithful of Shelyn is the\
  \ Zonzon doll. A child chosen to be the “sibling” passes this strange little doll,\
  \ made from scraps of leather and cloth and sewn with red thread, among neighbors.\
  \ The townsfolk give it symbolic gifts and whisper apologies to those they’ve wronged\
  \ during the year or share with the doll happy memories in order to represent Shelyn’\
  s kindness and mercy to her now-lost brother Zon-Kuthon. The “sibling” child brings\
  \ the doll to everyone in town during the festival, making sure everyone has had\
  \ the chance to pay his or her dues and make peace. As the celebration winds down,\
  \ the doll is cast into the wilderness or set afloat to drift down a river in the\
  \ hope that it will find its way to the Midnight Lord and relate his sister’s kindness,\
  \ mercy, and goodwill in the face of the dark place he now resides.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Also this past week, a Pathfinder Society boon was added to the $5 sponsorship\
  \ level of the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter</a>. The emerald elixir, stolen\
  \ from a bizarre pool in the Emerald Spire dungeon, has now been made available\
  \ for Pathfinders. When used at an official Pathfinder Society game table, drinking\
  \ the elixir grants your hero the advanced simple template for the duration of the\
  \ scenario. Alternately, the elixir can be spiked with experimental agents to trigger\
  \ a beneficial permanent mutation randomly determined on a huge chart included on\
  \ the certificate. If more than one player activates an emerald elixir at the same\
  \ table, all drinkers can choose their preferred mutation from the list rather than\
  \ roll randomly.</p> \n     <p>There will not be another Pathfinder Society blog\
  \ post until January 7, 2013, so I want to take this time to wish all of you a happy\
  \ holidays. I hope everyone has a great time visiting family, giving gifts, and\
  \ hopefully enjoying some Pathfinder Society with the new holiday boon. We’ll see\
  \ you in 2013!</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><s>Click here to download the Crystalhue\
