  artist: "horrible carnival folk would be a winner (or if you prefer... a \"wieenahh\"\
    ). Anyway, GameMastery Module E1: Carnival of Tears is scheduled to hit our warehouse\
    \ soon, so now seemed like a great time to show you some of the horrors this festival\
    \ has to offer. Let's see: Horrible sideshow freaks, check. People slaughtered\
    \ by the dozens, check. Carnival games that get more than a bit deadly, check.\
    \ And of course, evil little clowns (well, sort of), check. To top it off, the\
    \ entire adventure is set in Falcon's Hollow, the starting point for D0: Hollow's\
    \ Last Hope and D1: Crown of the Kobold King. While these adventures are not necessary\
    \ for play, they do add a great bit of continuity and background to the area.\
    \ Need a bit more convincing? Here's the back cover copy"
