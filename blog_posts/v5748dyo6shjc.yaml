  description\">But I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more…</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ the calendar turned to 2021 and vaccines starting to rollout, we’ve got a chance\
  \ that some of us will actually get to travel to conventions. Unfortunately, we\
  \ aren’t quite at the point where it is safe to attend events in person. So for\
  \ the next few months, our presence will remain digital. We’re in talks with a few\
  \ shows about being virtual guests and will let you know more as soon as we make\
  \ the final determinations. If you have a digital show between now and April and\
  \ would like some organized play participation, please email the team at <a href=\"\
  mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with your event particulars.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Not traveling gives us a few more months of internal process smoothing\
  \ and a chance to finalize a few projects. In addition, Alex’s first anniversary\
  \ at Paizo approaches. His presence on the team brought much needed stability to\
  \ program functions and the venture-officer support. I look forward to doing even\
  \ more now that we’ve acclimated him into the program. Most of the planned projects\
  \ involve behind the scenes activities, but we hope that they make the forward-facing\
  \ aspects even better for our community.</p> \n     <p>Alright, that’s enough musing\
  \ from me. Without further ado, let’s get to the list of updates for this month!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>New OP Developer</h2> \n     <p>As we announced in last week’s blog,\
  \ Mike Kimmel has joined the team as our newest developer! A prolific Paizo freelancer,\
  \ Mike wrote many beloved adventures for Organized Play, such as <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpzgd7p?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-122-The-Protectorate-Petition\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-22: The Protectorate Petition</em></a> and <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9hgx?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-10-The-Consortium-Compact\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7–10: The Consortium Compact</em></a>, as well\
  \ as backmatter for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya219?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-135-Runeplague\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #135: Runeplague</em></a> and parts of several Lost\
  \ Omens rulebooks. He also founded the Freelance Forge community, a forum for current\
  \ and prospective RPG freelancers. You’ll hear more from him next week, but we’\
  re thrilled to bring him on board and can’t wait to see what our fully-staffed team\
  \ produces going forward!</p> \n     <h2>Digitization</h2> \n     <p>We originally\
  \ set the final day for Fame purchases in Pathfinder Society as December 31st. I’\
  m happy to say we all took a much needed holiday break. This does make getting final\
  \ decisions through the pipeline a bit problematic. So we decided to push the deadline\
  \ out to January 31st, 2021. This is it, though, the final extension. Once February\
  \ hits, Fame will be gone as a purchasable currency.</p> \n     <p>We know there\
  \ are still a few items that we haven’t imported to either AcP or faction reputation\
  \ or game rewards. We took the transition process slowly to make sure we’re doing\
  \ it right and not breaking anything more than we had to. Some of the outstanding\
  \ items, such as a method of bequeathing rewards between character and alternative\
  \ methods to revive dead characters, are questions we will answer in the next few\
  \ weeks and will share with you once we make decisions.</p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Right before Christmas, we announced sanctioning for the latest Pathfinder\
  \ adventure, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023dy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari\"\
  ><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a>, which offers a great transition from Beginner Box\
  \ play to utilizing the full Pathfinder ruleset. </p> \n     <p>We’re also excited\
  \ to announce that the Starfinder Society Additional Resources have now been updated!\
  \ This update includes the character options from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy\"\
  ><em>Threefold Conspiracy</em></a> adventure path, which were accidentally passed\
  \ over when we released the chronicles.</p> \n     <p>Looking forward, work on <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure: <em>The Slithering</em></a> nears completion and we hope\
  \ to upload sanctioning before the end of the month. After that, we’ll shift gears\
  \ to rulebooks, focusing on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em></a> and the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</em></a> (releasing in February), before\
  \ we jump back into adventures. We’ll keep you all updated as we have news to share.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>GM Achievements</h2> \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving\
  \ a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the\
  \ 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>One GM received their fifth star in the\
  \ last month. We had no one reach 5 Novas or 5 Glyphs.</p> \n     <p><b>5th Star</b>:\
  \ Shannon Petrosky</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Star GM, and thank\
  \ you for your dedication!</p> \n     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n     <p>In their <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.gencon.com/press/holidays-2020-and-gen-con-2021-updates\">holiday\
  \ message and update</a>, Gen Con announced that they were postponing badge registration\
  \ and event submission until they have a better idea of what the year will bring.\
  \ Once we know their plan, we’ll have more info to share about volunteering for\
  \ that event. We’ll have information on volunteering for other Paizo-sponsored conventions\
  \ soon as well. There are just a few questions left to answer before we are ready\
  \ to push go!</p> \n     <p>Otherwise, we have a few events on the calendar already\
  \ to look forward to in 2021! If you don’t see a convention on the list that you\
  \ think should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register their\
  \ event for organized play support.</p> \n     <table width=\"95%\"> \n      <thead\
