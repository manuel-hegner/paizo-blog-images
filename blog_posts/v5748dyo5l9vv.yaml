  \ we're back!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 30, 2008</p> \n   <p>Howdy,\
  \ all! In the wake of Snowpocalypse 2008, in which we got inches—<i>inches!</i>—\
  of snow and therefore couldn't possibly make it into the office, but rather holed\
  \ up in our houses waiting for the imminent apocalypse, we're all rushing a bit\
  \ to catch up and get our latest books off to press. Books like <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x7\"\
  ><i>The Reavers of Skaith</i></a>, Leigh Brackett's epic conclusion to the <a href=\"\
  /search?q=stark+brackett&amp;what=all\">Eric John Stark novels</a> which began with\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8f\"><i>The Secret of Sinharat</i></a>. For\
  \ a taste of what's in store for all you <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\"\
  >Planet Stories aficionados</a>, check out this scene, which made it onto the cover,\
  \ illustrated by James Ryman: </p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Victims customarily\
  \ went smiling to their deaths. Only at the very end, when they had been cast into\
  \ the sea and the Children had begun to share them, were there cries amid the blood\
  \ and the floating garlands; and both cries and blood were pleasing to the Mother.\
  \ The monks sang in their growling voices and did not notice that Stark had ceased\
  \ to smile.</p> \n    <p>He was still beyond any rational thought. He only knew\
  \ the death was coming swiftly through the silken water to claim him. The life within\
  \ him stirred—a simple, uncomplicated force that rose of itself to fight against\
  \ extinction. </p> \n    <p>Ashton was at his right hand. At his left was a monk,\
  \ and then a second monk, and then the unguarded edge of the steps. </p> \n    <p>Stark\
  \ swung his left arm viciously. The blow took the nearer monk across the throat\
  \ and swept him back into those who climbed behind him. In falling, he clutched\
  \ at the second monk and cost him his balance. Blue-robes tumbled and fell, splashing\
  \ into the shallow water. Stark rushed up out of the space he had opened, clearing\
  \ more space ahead of him by knocking other monks into the water. Hands caught at\
  \ him, tearing away the garlands but slipping on his naked, oiled body. Some of\
  \ the fingers had talons that drew blood, but they could not stop him. He gained\
  \ the platform with a wild bull's rush. </p> \n    <p>The blue-robe with the horn\
  \ turned about, startled. He had an especially brutish face. Stark took the horn\
  \ from him. With it, he broke the face and sent the blue-robe flying out into the\
  \ water on the far side of the platform. Then Stark swung the long horn like a ten-foot\
  \ club to clear the upper steps. </p> \n    <p>He shouted, \"Simon!\" </p> \n  \
  \  <p>Then he heard a faint voice calling his name, N'Chaka, Man-Without-a-Tribe,\
  \ and he wondered who on this death-bitten godhaunted planet knew that name to call\
  \ him. And suddenly he realized that the voice was in his mind... </p> \n   </blockquote>\
