  description\">Happy Friday! To polish off <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab?Pathfinder-Battles-Crown-of-Fangs\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles: Crown of Fangs</em> set</a>, this week we are starting\
  \ with the Reclamation Squire, a medium common. This gal take putting down evil\
  \ seriously. Based off of art from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>, the shield and chainmail detailing are awesome.\
  \ It is also always nice to see a woman warrior in combat appropriate armor, with\
  \ a combat appropriate haircut. Bad to the bone.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next we have the Reclamation Knight, a medium uncommon.\
  \ This miniature represents, hopefully, what your squire becomes after righting\
  \ enough wrongs, and ending enough evil schemes. Love the detailing on the helmet,\
  \ and the more ornate shield. This miniature is also based off of art from the Hell's\
  \ Vengeance Adventure Path.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>The Monstrous Skeleton is a large uncommon miniature. Because\
  \ when having humanoid skeletons isn't enough, Paizo has you covered. Maul your\
  \ player's characters to your heart's content with this bestial baddy, which is\
  \ based off of art from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <p>Finally, Shadowcount Sial is a medium rare miniature. This guy is a devout\
  \ priest of Zon-Kuthon, one of our more cheery deities, as you can see from his\
  \ joyful smile. Who wouldn't find serving The Midnight Lord a pleasure? This miniature\
  \ is based off of art from the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path, and would\
  \ work great as a priest, ranger, slayer, fighter, of whatever else you choose.</p>\
