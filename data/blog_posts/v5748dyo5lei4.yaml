  \      <p>My roleplaying experience began with a bequeathed copy of the 1981 Dungeons\
  \ &amp; Dragons Expert Rules from my older cousin Tim. It wasn’t until the end of\
  \ middle school that I found a regular gaming group, and it was Kyle Pratt, one\
  \ of the founding members and now co-Venture-Captain of Georgia, who introduced\
  \ me to Pathfinder and later Pathfinder Society in early 2010. Given my training\
  \ as an archaeologist, Pathfinder Society had an instant appeal. Despite an ally\
  \ nearly killing off the entire party in The Prince of Augustana, our first scenario,\
  \ I was hooked.</p> \n      <p>From there we, along with Nani Pratt, acted as store\
  \ liaisons under Mike Brock’s leadership as then-VC. When he took on the weighty\
  \ mantle of Campaign Coordinator, I cheerfully offered my services in adapting modules,\
  \ writing Chronicle sheets for Pathfinder Tales, and other small-scale odds and\
  \ ends, and I continued to write supplementary material behind the scenes until\
  \ PaizoCon 2012. I was already excited that weekend. Not only had I participated\
  \ as a suitor in the Grand Convocation the night before, but I was also still buzzed\
  \ from some amazing conversations in person with the esteemed Painlord and Shivok\
  \ from the messageboards. Then, Mark Moreland snagged me during the lunch break,\
  \ offered me a chance to write a scenario, and asked me to write the Season 4 convention\
  \ boons.</p> \n      <p>In early January, I received an exciting series of emails.\
  \ First, it was Mark asking if at some point in the future, budget willing, I would\
  \ be interested in a bit of freelance, part-time development work. Sure! Then I\
  \ heard from Wes asking me to send in a resume for a full-time developer position.\
  \ Done! A few interviews later, I was hired and swapping ideas with Mike to continue\
  \ Pathfinder Society’s growth and improve the experience even more.</p> \n     \
