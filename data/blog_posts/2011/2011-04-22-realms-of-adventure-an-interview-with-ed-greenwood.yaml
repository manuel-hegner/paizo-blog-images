                Realms of Adventure: An Interview with Ed Greenwood</h1>
              <p class="date">Friday, April 22, 2011</p>
              <p>As we get closer to PaizoCon we'll be showcasing some interviews with the various guests we'll have at the show. We kick off this series with an interview with Ed Greenwood, one of the most influential people in the RPG industry.</p>
              <p>We're incredibly honored to have Ed as our Guest of Honor at PaizoCon 2011. I've been reading Ed's work since I was in Jr. High and reading about, and playing in, the Realms since the grey box debuted in 1987 for 1st Edition. I can't wait to hang out with Ed at PaizoCon this year and a lucky few PaizoCon guests will get the chance to play in a game run by the "Sage of Shadowdale" himself, so keep an eye out for the PaizoCon lottery coming soon.</p>
              <p>And without further ado, here's the interview with Ed!</p><img src="/image/content/Blog/EdGreenwood_180.jpeg" align="right">
              <p><b>1. Could you tell us a little about yourself and how you started in the industry?</b></p>
              <p>I'm Canadian, was born and raised in what is now Toronto. I have a degree in journalism but have always worked in public libraries, from age 14 onwards (still working in a public library, and I'm 51 now). I have always written fantasy, sf, and other fiction, and started creating the Realms when I was 6 years old (8 years before D&amp;D was created, and 9 years before the wider world saw it). I started reading <em>The Dragon</em> (as it was then called) around issue #8, started writing for it in 1979 (an article on the Divine Right game was my first submission, but wasn't published until issue #34, after two of my D&amp;D monster creations had seen print: the Curst in #30, and the Crawling Claw in #32). I happily buried the editors under submission after submission, and as a result they soon named me a Contributing Editor; some years later, when TSR was looking for a new campaign "world" for the game, they contacted me and purchased the Realms. I have never been on staff at any game company, but have written literally hundreds of novels and short stories, adventures, articles, sourcebooks, and other game products over the years, for all sorts of game systems. I still love creating stuff, and try to do something every day.</p>
              <p><b>2. When did you discover your creative talents?</b></p>
              <p>I've written poetry and lyrics for as long as I can remember (making up new words to songs I heard sung around me when I was a toddler, apparently). As a kid of 3 years old and for the next 6 years—apparently I was one of those "child prodigies"—I apparently often pestered my father by excitedly bringing him various books I'd read in his den and demanding to know "what happened next." He often gravely told me that the author was long dead, and if I wanted sequels I'd have to write them myself.</p>
              <p>So I did. They were mostly dreadful, but I kept at it, and have written or co-written around 140 books, thus far. I'm not sure how talented I am, but I <em>am</em> persistent.</p>
              <p><b>3. What inspires you?</b></p>
              <p>Everything. Everything at all. "Life" would be the flippant answer. Pretty sunsets and animals, flirtatious repartee, real-life pratfalls and moments of cleverness, improbable coincidences, rumors, smiles from strangers... you name it.</p>
              <p><b>4. How would you describe your style?</b></p>
              <p>Chameleon 101. Though I like humor and have a weakness for smart-mouthed first person narrators, I try to tailor my style to the project at hand. I've written torrid romances and instruction manuals, pastiches of many different writers, and adopted all sorts of styles. In my game writing, I do try to build nuance, color, and "tone" into my writing that constantly hints at things I don't have sufficient word count to come right out and say. (Which no doubt drives some editors nuts.) So I don't have a distinctive style (though I <em>do</em> have a fairly consistent "voice" for most of my Realms fiction; contrast it with my <a href="/pathfinder/tales/serial/v5748dyo5lbpf">"Guns of Alkenstar" Pathfinder Tales story</a>).</p>
              <p><b>5. Do you have a favorite story or character?</b></p>
              <p>No. I have literally dozens of favorite stories and characters, which I'm afraid means I don't have lone, specific "favorites" of either. Really.</p>
              <p><b>6. Who are your favorite writers and influences?</b></p>
              <p>Hooboy! Here we go, knowing I'll inevitably miss some...</p>
              <p><b>Living</b>: Guy Gavriel Kay, Terry Pratchett, Spider Robinson, Patricia McKillip, Robin McKinley, Jack Vance, Julian May, Ursula LeGuin, Dana Stabenow, J. V. Jones</p>
              <p><b>Dead</b>: Lord Dunsany, Rudyard Kipling, P. G. Wodehouse, Roger Zelazny, Fritz Leiber, Leslie Charteris, E. E. "Doc" Smith, John Dickson Carr, Ellis Peters, Clark Ashton Smith, J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft</p>
              <p><b>7. How do you juggle freelance work and life?</b></p>
              <p>They're two separate things?</p>
              <p>Seriously, writing/designing <em>is</em> my life. It's why I breathe. I value friendship and camaraderie, books, and creating (both alone and with friends). I live to do these things and enjoy these things, and share them with those I love. (Which is, I suppose, a grand way of saying I dream and make up lies for a living.)</p>
              <p><b>8. Describe yourself in 5 words.</b></p>
              <p>Whimsical, jovial, kind, widely-interested.</p>
              <p><b>9. What's the best thing to happen to you recently?</b></p>
              <p>I've been able to help (in small ways) launch or better the careers of some friends who are going to be <em>great</em> writers. We'll all get to read the results, in years to come. No, I'm not going to name names. My reward will be the reading, the hugs, and laughter together.</p>
              <p><b>10. Any advice for aspiring writers?</b></p>
              <p>Nothing strikingly original.</p>
              <p>These, above all: Read, read, read (widely, not just in your chosen field) and write, write, write (you can and will improve your craft, the more you keep at it).</p>
              <p>Take all writing advice with a grain of salt, because everyone's slightly different, and what worked for me or for Stephen King might not work for you. However, <em>pay attention</em> to editors and guidelines and formats and the nitty-gritty of daily work, because those who don't are often not heard from again.</p>
              <p>And keep at it. Most "overnight successes" have been years in the making. Don't tell me or anyone about the book you're going to write—instead, save your time and breath and <em>sit down and write it</em>. I'm a greedy reader; I want the fruits of your labors, not the signal of your intent to one day undertake them.</p>
              <p>Oh, and one more thing: Don't tell me you don't have time to write your great novel or design your new game. I have been writing professionally for 45 years (yes, I got <em>paid</em> for some of the stuff I did when I was six), and during that time went through school and university, held down a full-time job for more than twenty years (including a dozen years of commuting 120 miles to work and 120 miles home, six days a week), have worked part time for more than a decade when I wasn't full time... and "on the side" have managed to write or co-write (and co-writing takes longer) about 140 books (not to mention contributing to dozens more, and turning out hundreds of articles and columns and newspaper stories, poems and a play and script or three). So the "I don't have time" argument cuts little ice with me. I don't expect you to produce 140 books—just impress me with one. To begin with. ;}</p>
