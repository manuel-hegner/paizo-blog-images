  \     </div> \n     <p>For those of you who know who we are, who <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/comicbooksforkids\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">follow us on Facebook</a> and see the smiles of children sitting\
  \ in hospital beds across the country thank you for your continued support. For\
  \ those of you learning about us for the first time, welcome and allow me to share\
  \ a little bit about us, who we are, and where this all began.</p> \n     <p>My\
  \ name is Mark Weiss and I am the founder and president of <a href=\"https://www.comicbooksforkids.org/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">ComicBooks For Kids</a> (<a href=\"http://cb4k.org/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">CB4K.ORG</a>). As a child, I was diagnosed with severe asthma. On my 6th\
  \ birthday, my mother brought me to a specialist who examined me, looked at her,\
  \ and said, \"It is a really good thing you brought him in to see me. Had you waited\
  \ a little longer, this would have progressed into a situation where the ability\
  \ to reverse the obstructions would have been very limited.\" And so began my shots\
  \ and treatment which even today I still receive. There were many times that I felt\
  \ challenged to just even be able to breathe as a child. Remember middle school,\
  \ running laps in the gym? My gym teachers thought I was just looking for an excuse\
  \ to get out of running ( a trigger for asthmatics if there ever was one). I remember\
  \ times as a child when the bus dropped me off at the corner and all I had to do\
  \ was walk three houses to my own house. That's it three houses. It was right there.\
  \ I could see it but for all intent and purpose it may as well have been ten miles\
  \ away, I would take ten steps, stop and grab my knees. Try to breathe. Then ten\
  \ more. Knees. Breathe. And then ten more. </p> \n     <p>But I would get home and\
  \ there they were. My mom had gone to the store and had bought me some comic books.\
  \ Maybe it was Justice League (my favorite back then). Or Batman. Or Superman. Or\
  \ Spider-man. Or Fantastic Four. I didn't care about who the publisher was, as a\
  \ child that was not important. I just knew that with these comic books, I was fighting\
  \ the Joker as Batman. I was flying like Superman. I was wisecracking like Peter\
  \ Parker. And wow, did I want a green power ring! And forgive me but as a young\
  \ lad, I so wanted those x-ray glasses that appeared in all of the ads.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Comics were my friends. And they took me away. I was in outer space fighting\
  \ monsters, on an island running from dinosaurs, or flying through the sky. While\
  \ I was in that fantasy world, my mind was not focused on my breathing challenges\
  \ and perhaps a wonderful escape as the medicine slowly worked.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ is why we started ComicBooks For Kids! Illness strikes us all. Some more than\
  \ others. Some children are in hospitals for a short period of time, others receive\
  \ cancer treatments. Illness doesn't care about which gender you identify with.\
  \ It doesn't care about your age, your belief system, your ethnicity. It strikes\
  \ us all. And so we started ComicBooks For Kids to help children everywhere in every\
  \ state of this country. It doesn't matter who you are, if you are a child(or teen)\
  \ in need and in a hospital, we want to be there for you. Now 165 hospitals later\
  \ and in every state of the country, we provide comic books, Funko toys and other\
  \ pop culture items to bring smiles to the children while they are in the hospital.</p>\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>We recognize\
  \ that we can never take away the physical reasons that a child is in the hospital.\
  \ But consider the emotional impact that being in a hospital has on a child. There\
  \ is a fear that many feel as they walk through the doors and into that building.\
  \ Even as adults, many of us become anxious as we walk into a hospital. Yet, with\
  \ all of that, we have letter after letter from nurses and other health care professionals\
  \ that comic books ease that emotional burden and let the children and teens relax\
  \ while they are reading the comic book. And that is the point. <b>While we can\
  \ never take away the reason a child is in the hospital, we can for a period of\
  \ time while they have these comic books allow them to be kids again.</b></p> \n\
  \     <p>We have also expanded. You see, as ComicBooks For Kids!, we often receive\
  \ donations. We are often asked what is acceptable or we perhaps receive materials\
  \ that are not always age-appropriate for children. What do we do with these? We\
  \ created a sister site called <a href=\"https://www.comicbooksforkids.org/cb4thome\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">ComicBooks For Troops</a>. Now, regardless of your political\
  \ affiliation, these brave young men and women, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers,\
  \ aunts, and uncles are out there serving their country. And what better way to\
  \ say thank you to them, many of whom cannot be with us on holidays than to utilize\
  \ these pop culture items that are not suitable for children. In this way, every\
  \ donation is 100% used. They too for a brief moment can forget about the rigor\
  \ of the day and lose themselves in the fantasy of storytelling be it a comic or\
  \ a game.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/35baead3-9b8a-4a53-9b27-475ebcef40d2/TroopPic.jpg\"\
