  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“‘Fix the shuttle,’ she\
  \ says. ‘It’s only a little banged up,’ she says.” Angry clanging noises came from\
  \ beneath the deck, followed by Quig’s face popping up out of the engineering access\
  \ bay. He waved a spanner angrily. “Next time Navasi wants to sign us up for a salvage\
  \ mission, she can patch the junker, and <i>I’ll</i> stay on the <i>Maiden</i> and\
  \ watch for pirates!”</p> \n     <p>Altronus stared down from the hallway, both\
  \ sets of arms crossed. “I’m sure the captain was just expressing confidence in\
  \ your abilities.”</p> \n     <p>“Yeah?” Grease-smeared ears twitched above Quig’\
  s mask. “Well <i>I’m</i> sure that this rustbucket isn’t going anywhere without\
  \ a miracle. I’ve wired together every battery we’ve got to charge the capacitors,\
  \ but the reactor containment field is totally shot. If I fire it up without the\
  \ magnetic bottle in place, they’ll be finding pieces of us all the way out on Aucturn.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</p> \n     <p>“Sure. You can\
  \ tell our fearless leader that unless she wants to abandon our score to the rest\
  \ of the jackals, we’re gonna remain stranded on a barren rock approximately three\
  \ times the size of my furry brown ass, with no way to call in a tow because—<i>oh\
  \ yeah</i>—this whole job is technically illegal.” The spanner made another wild\
  \ circle, nearly clipping Altronus’s knee. “I swear by my grandmother’s tail, I—\
  ”</p> \n     <p>“Anything <i>else</i> I can do? To help with the repairs?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Quig sighed and let the spanner droop. “Go outside and get a look at the\
  \ right main thruster for me. Let me know if the nozzle housing looks intact.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Right.” Grateful for the chance to escape the ysoki’s incessant, undignified\
  \ complaining, Altronus walked to the hatch and cycled the airlock.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ air beyond was thin, and bitterly cold. The sarcesian colonists who had once tried\
  \ to make this asteroid habitable had long since abandoned the project, and Altronus’\
  s lungs burned with strain and frost as he struggled to process what little air\
  \ their machines had left behind.</p> \n     <p>Yet as it always did, the nearness\
  \ to vacuum soothed him even as it stung. Out here, there was no barrier between\
  \ him and the cosmos. The cold he felt was the same cold that wrapped the stars.\
  \ The song of the Cycle hummed in his veins like background radiation.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>He walked around to the back of the shuttle. From the outside, the damage\
  \ looked worse—for all Altronus’s faith in the captain, he had to admit that Quig\
  \ had a point. The fact that they were even close to getting the thing flying again\
  \ was a testament to the ysoki’s skill. He reached up with his highhands and hauled\
  \ himself easily up into the engine’s darkened mouth.</p> \n     <p>“Quig? Altronus?”\
  \ Navasi’s voice crackled over coms. “Are you still at the shuttle?”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Where else would we be?” Quig snapped. “Listen, Captain, this thing—”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Stow it. Raia’s got life forms on scanners. Half a dozen of them, moving\
  \ fast in your direction. Raia and I will intercept as many as we can with the <i>Maiden</i>,\
  \ but some of them will reach you before we do.”</p> \n     <p>“Acknowledged, Captain.”\
  \ Altronus turned and leapt down from the engine, his descent gruelingly slow in\
  \ the meager gravity. “How much time do we have?”</p> \n     <p>But the answer was\
  \ already coming over the crater’s rim: three round-shelled creatures, their front\
  \ ends writhing masses of tentacles, two of which were longer than the others and\
  \ heavily scaled. They skimmed along like antigrav speeders above the asteroid’\
  s surface, their shells glimmering metallically in the light of Altronus’s mote.\
  \ One instant they were at the ridge, and the next they were at the shuttle’s side—\
  halfway between Altronus and the hatch.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  Altronus!” Quig appeared in the open airlock. “Get in here!”</p> \n     <p>“Working\
  \ on it,” Altronus muttered. Then he stepped forward, careful not to launch himself\
  \ off the asteroid’s surface, and raised his voice. </p> \n     <p>“Greetings, friends.”\
  \ He lifted all four hands in what he hoped was a universal sign of peace. Would\
  \ tentacled creatures even recognize the gesture? Raia would probably know. “I mean\
  \ you no harm. My name is Altronus Barasul Dovenayan, a kasatha of House—”</p> \n\
  \     <p>A distortion rippled across the creatures’ shells, blue lines that weren’\
  t quite lightning tracing down their tentacles. </p> \n     <p>Altronus froze. “\
  Easy, friends. I—”</p> \n     <p>The creatures <i>pulsed</i>.</p> \n     <p>Altronus\
  \ flew forward, dragged off his feet by some invisible force. He landed in the dust\
  \ and rolled, barely avoiding lashes from the closest creature’s main tentacles.\
  \ He yanked his pistol free of its holster, but the creatures pulsed again. This\
  \ time, the pull on his body was weak enough that he could brace against it, but\
  \ the gun lurched from his hand, slapping against the side of the creature’s shell\
  \ and sticking there like—</p> \n     <p><i>Of course</i>. Magnets! Now that he\
  \ had the idea in his head, he could feel the variation in the pull—the force exerted\
  \ on the metal components of his armor, but none on the plates themselves. If he\
  \ squinted, he could see the lines of magnetic fields around the creatures, dust-like\
  \ metallic fines from the asteroid’s surface forming a cloud that pulsed like breath.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Quig’s swearing flooded the coms. Altronus looked over and saw\
  \ the ysoki splayed out across one of the creature’s shells, pinned to it by his\
  \ junkyard of a spacesuit.</p> \n     <p>Beneath his scarf, Altronus smiled.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The creatures thought they’d disarmed him. They didn’t realize that\
  \ the gun was just a tool. </p> \n     <p><i>Altronus</i> was the weapon.</p> \n\
  \     <p>He stilled his mind, letting the false divisions between him and the universe\
  \ fall away. </p> \n     <p>He was not Altronus. He was not kasatha. He was matter:\
  \ forged in the heart of a star, pulling and pulled by every atom in the cosmic\
  \ dance. He was energy: uncreateable, undestroyable, a momentary configuration of\
  \ an eternal process.</p> \n     <p>He was everything. He was nothing.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>And he was going to <i>wipe the floor</i> with these worm-faced bastards.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He stretched his consciousness down, into the asteroid, finding the\
  \ thread of its gravitational pull and strengthening it. This time, when the creatures\
  \ pulsed, he stood firm, tethered to the rock’s surface. With his lowright hand,\
  \ he reached up and grabbed his mote, feeling the white-hot stellar energy distending\
  \ into its familiar blade.</p> \n     <p>There was a sharp pop, like an electrical\
  \ arc, and something slammed into Altronus’s side, spinning him halfway around.\
  \ He looked down at the metallic barb protruding from his armor, and had just enough\
  \ time to think the word <i>harpoon</i> before the creature pulsed again. The force\
  \ yanked him sideways, threatening to rip him in two as the creature’s magnetic\
  \ tether competed with his own gravitational anchor.</p> \n     <p>Well, one of\
  \ those he could control. He dropped the anchor, lurching through the air toward\
  \ the barb-thrower, stellar blade extended. The sudden rush caught the creature\
  \ off-guard, and alien eyes widened as the blade struck home. The creature thrashed,\
  \ tentacles sliding across Altronus’s armor as he slid his glowing blade free and\
  \ thrust again. And again. </p> \n     <p>The creature’s strange antigravity cut\
  \ out, dropping them both to the ground. Before Altronus could regain his feet,\
  \ new tentacles wrapped him up from behind, pinning his arms to his sides. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The thing’s grip was like industrial machinery, the coiled tentacles\
  \ crushing. Trying hard to ignore creaking bones and empty lungs, Altronus cast\
  \ his mind out to Mataras, the blazing sun at the heart of the Pact Worlds. Delving\
  \ down into its flaming seas, he made his consciousness a conduit, and let the fire\
  \ flow.</p> \n     <p>Flames burst from his body in all directions, a tiny supernova\
  \ burning tentacles to ash. He spun, chest heaving as the pressure around it relented,\
  \ and brought his blade up.</p> \n     <p>The creature lay flat against the ground,\
  \ charred tentacles twitching spasmodically. Off to one side, Quig stood next to\
  \ the corpse of his own attacker, yanking tools free from its shell.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Alien eyes rolled in terror as Altronus pinned his beast to the rock with one\
  \ foot, placing the tip of his blade inches from its eye. </p> \n     <p>Altronus\
  \ coughed. “Let’s try this again, friend. I mean you no harm. And you don’t mean\
  \ me any harm either, do you?” He waggled the blade.</p> \n     <p>The creature\
  \ stared up at him, but made no move to protest. It just lay there, its shell wrapped\
  \ in softly pulsing lines of magnetic fields.</p> \n     <p><i>Magnetic fields</i>.\
  \ Altronus turned to his companion. “Quig. Is the reactor’s magnetic containment\
  \ still broken?”</p> \n     <p>“Yeah, why?”</p> \n     <p>Altronus stared down into\
  \ the creature’s eyes.</p> \n     <p>“Because I’ve got a crazy idea.”</p> \n   \
