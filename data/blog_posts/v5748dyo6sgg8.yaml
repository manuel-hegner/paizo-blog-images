  description\">This past year has been a wild ride. As a look back on the year, I\
  \ wanted to use this space to let the Paizo editorial team (developers, designers,\
  \ editors, and art team) share some of our favorite things that we made or did during\
  \ 2018. If you missed part 1 of this two-part blog, <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgfo?A-Few-of-Our-Favorite-Things-Part-1\"\
  >check it out here</a>!</p> \n     <p>Thanks to Sonja and Emily on the art team\
  \ for selecting the accompanying art, and thanks to all of you out there that have\
  \ supported us in our endeavors. Happy Holidays!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \     <h3>Jason Keeley (Developer)</h3> \n     <p>The project I am proudest of this\
  \ year is the release of the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams\"\
  >Signal of Screams Adventure Path</a> for Starfinder. I've been working on the Starfinder\
  \ adventures for a bit now, but this particular set of adventures were the first\
  \ ones I concepted and outlined on my own. I got to indulge my love of horror and\
  \ all things dark and terrible, as well as tell a type of story we hadn't yet told\
  \ in Starfinder. Of course, this Adventure Path wouldn't exist at all without the\
  \ efforts of the rest of the Starfinder team, everyone else here at Paizo, and my\
  \ terrific authors, but I feel a certain sense of ownership over SoS (see what I\
  \ did there?). Plus, I got to contribute to this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBmZmKSk2co\"\
  >awesome trailer</a>.</p> \n     <p>As night settles over the land so very early\
  \ in this cold and wintry days, why not fix yourself a mug of steaming hot liquid,\
  \ wrap yourself up tightly in a blanket, and open up a volume of the <a href=\"\
  /store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams\">Signal of Screams Adventure Path</a>\
  \ near your very vulnerable face? Really, what's the worst that could happen?</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Lu Pellazar (Editor)</h3> \n     <p>What a year 2018 has been! There\
  \ were ups, there were downs, there were \"oh no what is happening who am I what\
  \ day is it\"s. I've had my hands in a ton of new products, both as an editor and\
  \ a writer, but I must say my magnum opus (at least for this year) are my contributions\
  \ to the <a href=\"/products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2\"><i>Starfinder\
  \ Alien Archive 2</i></a>: my bug children, the osharus and bolidas! I also got\
  \ to refine my metaphorical juggling game in working on the <i>Pathfinder Playtest</i>,\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory\"><i>Starfinder Armory</i></a>\
  \ (two words: BATTLE RIBBON), and the nail-biting-intrigue-filled War for the Crown\
  \ APs all at the same time. I had a go at the <i>Starfinder Beginner Box</i>, and\
  \ seeing it go from ideas floating in the Paizo brainverse to a real, tangible product\
  \ is simply surreal! Last but not least, I gotta say the best part of my 2018 at\
  \ Paizo was the addition of my new team members, James, Jason, and Leo! Shout out\
  \ to my grammarsmith fam! We couldn't have made it through this rollercoaster of\
  \ a year without y'all. =)</p> \n     <h3>Chris Sims (Developer)</h3> \n     <p>I\
  \ dove into the Vast this last year, starting with <a href=\"/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Armory</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2\"\
  ><i>Alien Archive 2</i></a>. It was fun to create the quorlu and the velstrac anchorite,\
  \ and to watch Armory disappear at Gen Con. That said, I'm grateful that my colleague\
  \ and Adventure Path mentor Jason Keeley \"made\" me write <a href=\"/products/btq01vb2?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-10-The-Diaspora-Strain\"\
  ><i>The Diaspora Strain</i></a> adventure. Not only did I learn a lot, but I also\
  \ got to delve into making horror for what's normally magical space opera. I hope\
  \ my goal of affecting the players, rather than just the characters, plays out.\
  \ Players should enjoy the adventure most of all, but I also want them to be a little\
  \ harrowed and grateful the characters survived. It's a different feeling than most\
  \ heroic adventure stories, much like it was a different feeling to write that adventure.\
  \ And after that trip into darkness, I get to take players straight into the Pact\
  \ Worlds sun in 2019. Ah, it is good to be a Starfinder developer.</p> \n     <div\

  \ \n     <h3>Amanda Hamon Kunz (Starfinder Managing Developer)</h3> \n     <p>I\
  \ can hardly believe that 2018 was just <i>one</i> year! In that span, I've had\
  \ the privilege of officially moving back onto the Starfinder team, and being the\
  \ game's managing developer has been a fantastic ride of creativity, teamwork, crunchy\
  \ projects, challenging deadlines, and some of the best times I've had all year\
  \ with the team's amazing game professionals: Rob McCreary, Owen K.C. Stephens,\
  \ Thurston Hillman (PAIZO NORTH!), Jason Keeley, Joe Pasini, and Chris Sims. Gen\
  \ Con this year was another incredible one for us, as we sold out of the <i><a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory\">Starfinder Armory</a></i> on Day 1, and the\
  \ year rolled on as we faced some mammoth beasts including the <a href=\"/products/btq01wrs?Starfinder-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><i>Starfinder </i><i>Beginner </i><i>Box</i></a>, class design on the <a href=\"\
  /starfinderplaytest\"><i>Character </i><i>Operations </i><i>Manual</i></a> and now\
  \ those classes' playtest, Adventure Path development, and more things that I can't\
  \ even talk about yet! It has been a crazy year, but a great one. Here's to 2019!</p>\

  \ \n     <h3>Adam Daigle (Pathfinder Managing Developer)</h3> \n     <p>2018 has\
  \ been a wild year. The announcement of the upcoming new edition and the <a href=\"\
  /store/pathfinder/playtest\">Pathfinder Playtest</a> this past March was exciting\
  \ and quite a relief. I'm honestly surprised that the news didn't leak prior to\
  \ the announcement (though I'm certain that many people were expecting a new edition\
  \ on the horizon). It's hard keeping a secret for that long.</p> \n     <p>In addition\
  \ to that, this year saw the release of my very first Adventure Path adventure <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9y26?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-133-Secrets-of-Rodericks-Cove\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #133: Secrets of Roderic's Cove</i></a>. I've written\
  \ plenty of articles and monsters over the years and have developed over a dozen\
  \ Adventure Path adventures, but never managed to write one. Let me tell you, they're\
  \ no easy thing to do.</p> \n     <p>While that was cool, I think my favorite part\
  \ of 2018 was adding new faces to the developer ranks! Having Ron, Luis, Eleanor,\
  \ Mike, and Chris join the team this year has been awesome. I'm very happy to be\
  \ working alongside them and the rest of the best damn team of developers in the\
  \ industry.</p> \n     <h3>Thurston Hillman (Starfinder Society Developer)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>2018 really saw the <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder Society</a>\
  \ kick into high gear! I'm grateful for the past year and getting to see a ton of\
  \ really inspiring scenarios get played across the world, and hearing the ensuing\
  \ feedback from all our fans. I just want to give a big thanks to all our fans and\
  \ people who help keep Starfinder Society Organized Play growing. On a more personal\
  \ note, I also had the opportunity to put together an exclusive Starfinder Society\
  \ special scenario (#1-98: Into the Perplexity) which has become something of a\
  \ hit among the conventions I've run it at. For 2019, I'm really looking forward\
  \ to bringing the Scoured Stars season to its climactic conclusion, and moving forward\
  \ into the unknown, including a very special #2-98 Perplexity sequel, that I'm already\
  \ putting together for PaizoCon 2019!</p> \n     <h3>Mark Moreland (Franchise Manager)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Every year comes with far more highlights than I could ever fit into\
  \ a single highlight blog, from the launch of new Adventure Paths to new faces in\
  \ the Paizo offices. For me personally, however, 2018 will always stand out as the\
  \ first year that two large licensed projects I had a sizable hand in producing\
  \ came out, both iterations of the Kingmaker Adventure Path from way back in 2010.\
  \ You see, the <i>Kingmaker Player's Gu</i>ide was one of three consecutive \"first\
  \ assignments\" I had writing for Paizo, so it's always held a special place in\
  \ my heart. When I switched roles from development to franchise management toward\
  \ the end of last year, the fact that two of the projects I'd be working on would\
  \ be Kingmaker-related made me even more happy!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181221-KothVaul.jpg\"><img\

  \     <br> <i>Illustration by Josef Kucera</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n  \
  \   <p>The first Kingmaker release to come out this year was by far the largest\
  \ license Paizo has ever done, and one of the most robust projects I've ever worked\
  \ on: Pathfinder: Kingmaker, an immersive and expansive CRPG adaptation of the Kingmaker\
  \ AP. I came into the process long after the Owlcats had begun development, but\
  \ I worked closely with their narrative team to approve storylines, dialogue, and\
  \ in-world texts before the game's launch. At one point, I had a 10-inch stack of\
  \ printed in-game text on my desk for approval. I won't pretend I read all 800,000\
  \ words, but it was certainly enough to keep me busy! After playing through the\
  \ prologue and chapter one about seven times in alpha and beta builds, seeing the\
  \ game in the wild, with tens of thousands of players worldwide was really something\
  \ to behold. I'm still involved with the game's updates and expansions, but for\
  \ the most part, I'm just enjoying my own journey through the Stolen Lands in my\
  \ personal playthrough.</p> \n     <p>The second major Kingmaker release was <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker\"><i>Pathfinder Battles:\
  \ Kingmaker</i></a>, which was the first major prepainted plastic minis set I worked\
  \ extensively on. While I didn't make the initial setlist, I was heavily involved\
  \ in modifying it and approving the sculpts and paint masters. Again, seeing the\
  \ set in the wild and reading and hearing fan reactions to it really made all the\
  \ attention to detail and time poring over reference art for any room for improvement\
  \ worth it!</p> \n     <p>As we look to a new year on the horizon, I'm already deep\
  \ in the next few projects (including some we haven't announced yet!) so it's nice\
  \ to stop for a minute and reflect on what made 2018 such a fantastic year to be\
  \ Paizo's franchise manager.</p> \n     <h3>Leo Glass (Editor)</h3> \n     <p>My\
  \ first year as an Editor at Paizo is in the books, and I can't believe how amazing\
  \ it's been to collaborate with so many incredible professionals who deeply love\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder! I had a blast editing sections of <i>Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ Adventure: Doomsday Dawn</i>, <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>, <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Bestiary</i>, <i>Starfinder Alien Archive 2</i>,<i> Starfinder Armory,\
  \ </i><i>Starfinder Beginner Box</i>, and numerous other Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ adventure paths and scenarios. I loved working on the <i>Starfinder Critical Hit\
  \ Deck</i>, because 1) author Owen K.C. Stephens is one of the most creative and\
  \ intelligent folks I've ever worked with and 2) who doesn't appreciate an accessory\
  \ that enables you to horribly eviscerate your foes? Finally, I also got the chance\
  \ to write one of four quests in <a href=\"/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest Scenario #1: The Rose Street Revenge</i></a>, marking\
  \ my first professional foray into adventure writing. Thanks to everyone whose contributions\
  \ made these products successful!</p> \n     <p>2019 is going to be a great year\
  \ for Pathfinder and Starfinder, and I can't wait to gush about all of the amazing\
  \ products on the horizon. Until then, I hope everyone has a happy and safe new\
  \ year. Oh, and if anyone knows how to train a squox to hold a red pen, DM me. See\
  \ you at PaizoCon!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181221-CorruptingElfGate.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <h3>Linda Zayas-Palmer (Organized Play Developer)</h3> \n     <p>This year's\
  \ certainly been a busy one. When it comes to the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>, we've been bouncing back and forth between\
  \ the current campaign and the future of the Pathfinder Society. Wrapping up season\
  \ 9 and rolling into season 10, we've been focused on bringing exciting conclusions\
  \ to some of the campaign's looming threats and answering some of its mysteries.\
  \ And when it comes to looking forward, we've spent plenty of time planning how\
  \ to improve the Pathfinder Society experience in the future. We couldn't do it\
  \ without all of you guys, which is why we've also been running quite a few surveys\
  \ to gather your feedback. To all of you who have participated in those surveys,\
  \ thank you very much for taking the time to share your perspectives and ideas with\
  \ us.</p> \n     <p>When it comes to what I'm most proud of that I worked on this\
  \ year, <i>The Hao Jin Cataclysm</i> certainly takes the cake. I developed both\
  \ the Roleplaying Guild and Adventure Card Guild components of it, making it both\
  \ my first interactive special as a developer and the moment when I took over the\
  \ reins of Adventure Card Guild development. It was great fun to pick up a bunch\
  \ of plot threads and NPCs from past adventures in the Hao Jin Tapestry and continue\
  \ their stories. The experience of overseeing it at Gen Con was something I'll never\
  \ forget.</p> \n     <p>I'm looking forward to what we have coming down the pike\
  \ for you in 2019, and to when I can talk more about our plans for this year's convention\
  \ season. But for now, happy holidays, everyone!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \   <h3>Gabriel Waluconis (Project Manager)</h3> \n     <p>As the project manager\
  \ my red-hot favorite was implementing project management software across the entire\
  \ editorial team. What's that? People aren't here to read about that sort of work?\
  \ Oh dearie me. Ahem.</p> \n     <p>As the project manager I don't have much to\
  \ do with the creative aspects of any products. But I was quite happy to work with\
  \ the good folk here to push out the <a href=\"/products/btq01vam?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Construct-Handbook\"\
  ><i>Construct Handbook</i></a>. I really like constructs. Like, you don't even know.\
  \ I've also enjoyed working alongside my talented co-workers in tackling the logistical\
  \ challenges of releasing a new edition for Pathfinder, having two playtests back\
  \ to back (<a href=\"/store/pathfinder/playtest\">Pathfinder Playtest</a> and the\
  \ <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\"><i>Character </i><i>Operations </i><i>Manual</i></a>),\
  \ all while continuing our normal release schedule.</p> \n     <p>But in the end,\
  \ my absolute red-hot favorite is seeing a finished product on my desk. Knowing\
  \ it couldn't happen without all of the departments here at Paizo. From editorial,\
  \ customer service, finance, marketing, web team, IT team, to our awesome warehouse\
  \ staff.</p> \n     <h3>Jason Bulmahn (Director of Game Design)</h3> \n     <p>Going\
  \ into this year, I think that everyone on the design team was a bundle of nerves.\
  \ We had been quietly working on the playtest for almost two years, but the hardest\
  \ part was yet to come. All my experience with the first edition playtest told me\
  \ that it was going to be fine, that the playtest was a good thing, something to\
  \ help us better understand our game, but you just don't know until it is out there.\
  \ What parts were going to work? What rules were going to end up in Pharasma's Boneyard?\
  \ Only the playtest would reveal the truth. Since the day we announced, the rest\
  \ of the year has been a blur. There have been ups and downs, and a lot of late\
  \ nights spent pouring through survey results to tease out how the game was actually\
  \ performing, but I can honestly say that we are leaving the year with a game that\
  \ is leagues ahead of where we started… and it is all thanks to you! We have been\
  \ hammering away at this game, but it was all of you helped us understand what needed\
  \ to be fixed. So, I want to close out by looking forward. 2019 is going to be a\
  \ great year for Pathfinder and speaking for the design team, we can't wait for\
  \ you to see the Pathfinder 2nd Edition.</p> \n     <h3>James Case (Editor)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>That was a thing! I started at Paizo on the first (work) day of the\
  \ year, only to find out that a second edition was in the pipeline about ten minutes\
  \ into my first meeting. Getting the chance to work on a whole new edition from\
  \ the ground up isn't something that happens often, and it was great to GM delves\
  \ at PaizoCon and finally see so many players get to try out the playtest for the\
  \ first time. In fact, having never gone to a gaming convention before, just seeing\
  \ everyone enjoying Pathfinder and Starfinder at PaizoCon and Gen Con was exhilarating.\
  \ My first piece of RPG writing was also published this year, a writeup for the\
  \ aphorite race in <a href=\"/products/btq01vab?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHoppers-Handbook\"\
  ><i>Plane-Hopper's Handbook</i></a> (curiously, the art ended up looking not entirely\
  \ unlike a golder version of me, despite being ordered long before I was assigned\
  \ to write the piece). I'm looking forward to the next year!</p> \n     <p>Adam\
