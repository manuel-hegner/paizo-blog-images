  description\">Well would you look at that number at the top, it’s already 2023!\
  \ Don’t forget to date your checks correctly, I know I’m forever scribbling out\
  \ the previous year for the first month or so.</p> \n     <p>I’m very excited for\
  \ what’s coming in 2023. Obviously we have some fantastic products coming down the\
  \ line, but I’m even more excited about the future of Organized Play. We’ve got\
  \ two great metaplots in the works for you, and we’re going to be working hard to\
  \ make the program even better this year. It’s a new year and we’ve got a lot to\
  \ talk about already, so let’s dive right in!</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n \
  \    <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> \n     <p>These adventures will be available\
  \ on January 25, 2023.</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02e5o?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-408-Battle-for-Stars-Fate\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-08: Battle for Star's Fate</em>*</a></p> \n\
  \     <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e5p?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-513-Finding-the-Forgotten\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-13: Finding the Forgotten</em>*</a></p> \n \
  \    <p>*part of a subscription </p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Core Rulebook\
  \ Errata</h2> \n     <p>Earlier this week, the Rules &amp; Lore team announced a\
  \ new errata policy, as well as posting some new changes to the <em>Pathfinder Core\
  \ Rulebook</em>. Obviously these changes are going to affect Pathfinder Society\
  \ play, so here’s how to handle them:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>All new rule changes\
  \ in the 4th printing of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are in effect immediately. </li>\n\
  \      <li><em>Dust of disappearance</em> has been made uncommon. Any character\
  \ who previously purchased the item may keep it. It will be added to the Avid Collector\
  \ - Core Rulebook boon for future purchases and characters.</li> \n      <li>The\
  \ horse animal companion rules have been updated, and apply immediately. Any character\
  \ who no longer wants a horse animal companion may freely change their animal companion\
  \ to a new animal. Retraining out of an animal companion entirely follows the normal\
  \ rules for retraining.</li> \n      <li>The alchemist class updates provide a number\
  \ of changes and upgrades. Any alchemists built under the old rules can freely retrain\
  \ their research field and any feats except those that specifically prohibit doing\
  \ so (such as lineage feats). Any items purchased with gold can be sold back for\
  \ the full purchase price. Retraining out of the alchemist class entirely can only\
  \ be done with the normal retraining rules.</li> \n      <li>The <em>Core Rulebook</em>\
  \ now allows all characters to take two free ability boosts instead of the printed\
  \ options for their ancestry. Newly created characters in Pathfinder Society may\
  \ use this rule; previously built characters may not unless they rebuild the character\
  \ from scratch with a boon. </li> \n      <li>However, to retain the legality of\
  \ numerous existing characters, the Pathfinder Society campaign will continue to\
  \ offer the Voluntary Flaws optional ruleset and retain the text within the Guide\
  \ to Organized Play.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Once again, these changes go into\
  \ effect immediately. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we missed\
  \ any updates that you’re not sure how to handle!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>The\
  \ Replacement of Ehu Hadif</h2> \n     <p>This is your final reminder that if your\
  \ character is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si69?Ehu-Hadif-s-Mandate-Fulfilled-First-Seeker\"\
  >interested in becoming the new First Seeker</a>, time is running out! The deadline\
  \ to purchase the First Seeker Candidate boon and send in your information is <b>January\
  \ 16, 2023</b>. This is a hard deadline; after this date, submissions will be closed\
  \ and we’ll begin to review the candidates and make decisions.</p> \n     <br> \n\
  \     <h2>Toys of Boundless Wonder</h2> \n     <p>Last month, multiple regions and\
  \ local game stores came together for our Toys of Boundless Wonder event to play\
  \ games and boost donations for Toys for Tots. The event was a smash success, with\
  \ over 60 tables during the two-week event and 18 simultaneous tables playing this\
  \ year’s Pathfinder Society Special! There’s a full writeup <a href=\"https://leagueofaroden.com/2022/12/18/toys-of-boundless-wonder-2022-grand-report/\"\
  >on the League of Aroden site</a>, which I encourage you all to check out, but I\
  \ wanted to include some photos here. Stay tuned for details on next year’s event!</p>\

  \     <br> \n     <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> \n     <p>Last month, we posted boons\
  \ to unlock various character options from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/bloodLords\"\
  >Blood Lords Adventure Path</a>! Your characters can now take the Ashes mystery,\
  \ cast new and horrifying spells, and more! We also updated the text of the Undead\
  \ Companions boon from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0j?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></a> to incorporate some undead companions\
  \ from this Adventure Path. The full text of these boons is, as always, available\
  \ on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ FAQ page</a>.</p> \n     <p>Looking ahead, the next two projects on our radar\
  \ are the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dsn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix\"\
  >Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</a> compilation, as well as <em><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault\">Pathfinder Treasure\
  \ Vault</a></em>. Right now we’re on track to have sanctioning for both books available\
  \ on their release!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <h3>GM\
  \ Ranks</h3> \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in\
  \ any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone,\
  \ a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10\
  \ special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th\
  \ Glyph for PFS2. Congratulations!</p> \n     <p><b>5th Glyph (PFS2):</b> Bill Tobin</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n     <p>With a new year comes new conventions!\
  \ Our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">convention calendar</a> is already\
  \ looking rather full in January, and February and March are starting to fill out\
  \ as well. Check it out and see if there are any conventions in your area to play\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder Society!</p> \n     <p>I’m also pleased to announce\
  \ two more conventions where I’ll be making an appearance!</p> \n     <p>First,\
  \ I’ll be attending <a href=\"https://www.dundracon.com/\">DunDraCon</a> in Los\
  \ Angeles, California, from February 17¬–20. It’s my first official trip to California\
  \ and my first time in Los Angeles, so I’m excited to spend Presidents Day with\
  \ our LA lodge!</p> \n     <p>After that, I’ll immediately be heading to Denver\
  \ for <a href=\"https://gamergirlgames.com/\">GenghisCon</a> the next weekend, February\
  \ 23–26! The Mile High City is host to one of the Great Plains’ premiere conventions,\
  \ and both Tonya Woldridge and I will be attending.</p> \n     <p>If you’re in the\
  \ area of either of these shows, I encourage you to come out and say hi! Visiting\
  \ local shows is one of my favorite parts of my job, and it’s wonderful to see the\
  \ various communities come together.</p> \n     <p>Finally, for those of you eager\
  \ to volunteer at Gen Con or PaizoCon this year, come back to the blog next week\
  \ for some more news…</p> \n     <p>I’ll see you next week for more! Until then—\
  Explore! Report! Cooperate! And have fun in the desert!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
