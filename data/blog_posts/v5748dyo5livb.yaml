  \ Play Coordinator, you would think I've gotten better at packing. I'm currently\
  \ surrounded by my suitcase, Class Decks for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game,\
  \ and a pile of Paizo shirts, considering how best to get everything into my bag.\
  \ No matter how many times I do this, I still fret that I haven't remembered everything\
  \ I needed to pack. But, somehow, it all gets into the bag and I'm off to the airport!\
  \ I off to Origins tomorrow and am looking forward to seeing more Pathfinders. If\
  \ you're at the show, please stop by and say hi! Better yet, come see the new Mummy's\
  \ Mask demo for the Adventure Card Game. This Base Set has a few tricks up its sleeve\
  \ that are really cool!</p> \n     <p>This blog is another conglomeration of topics.\
  \ None of them need enough space for their own blog, but each of them involves news\
  \ that I want to share it with you. So if you want to know more about Free RPG Day,\
  \ Gen Con events, Faction Pin bonuses, Regional Venture-Coordinators, and campaign\
  \ flavor, read on. Otherwise, have a great week gaming and I'll see you next Monday!</p>\

  \ \n     <h2>Free RPG Day</h2> \n     <p>This Saturday, June 18 is <a href=\"http://freerpgday.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Free RPG Day</a>! On the roleplaying side of things, the team\
  \ got together and sanctioned <a href=\"/products/btpy9j4r\"><em>We B4 Goblins</em></a>,\
  \ this year's module written by the fantastic Crystal Frasier, for use in Pathfinder\
  \ Society organized play. For Adventure Card Game, we see the debut of of Tup the\
  \ Terrible, goblin pyromancer extraordinaire.</p> \n     <p>Sanctioning documents\
  \ and pregenerated characters have been added to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9j4r\"\
  >product page for <em>We B4 Goblins</em></a>. This year, in addition to the regular\
  \ chronicle, we've included a boon for those playing the module in a retail location\
  \ on Free RPG Day, which grants your character a commerative toad for use in future\
  \ scenarios.</p> \n     <h2>Gen Con Events</h2> \n     <p>Considering going to <a\
  \ href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> but haven't gotten your\
  \ tickets? Already going, but not sure what to participate in? Check out the two\
  \ newest pregenerated character specials!</p> \n     <p>On Thursday night at 8:00\
  \ PM, once again don the guise of Aspis Agents at Gen Con event <b>RPG1697556—<em>PFS\
  \ Special #7-98: Serpents' Ire</em> (Level 8)</b>. Someone skimmed profits from\
  \ the Aspis Consortium to fund daring experiments &amp; the Aspis have called upon\
  \ an elite team of agents—both new talent &amp; familiar veterans—to shut it down.\
  \ Eighth level pregenerated characters are provided for this event. This scenario\
  \ is part of Season 7's metaplot and follows activities of last year's scenarios\
  \ <em>#6-97: Siege of Serpents</em> and <em>#6-98: Serpents' Rise</em>.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Saturday evening at 8 sees the launch of Season 8 with Gen Con event <b>RPG1697558—\
  <em>PFS Special #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em> (Level 5)</b>. Travel the elemental\
  \ planes as a disturbance on the Plane of Air portends disaster. As a team of elemental\
  \ guardians, the PCs must brave otherworldly threats to uncover the cause &amp;\
  \ preserve the balance of the planes. For this event, fifth level pregenerated characters\
  \ are provided. This scenario launches the Season 8 metaplot.</p> \n     <p>In prior\
  \ years, we offered Kid's Track events for our younger gamers. They are still on\
  \ the schedule, but listed as part of the broader Pathfinder Society Academy (PSA)\
  \ offerings. This year, PSA activities run in the first two slots Thursday through\
  \ Saturday and the only slot on Sunday. We have Kid's Track Beginner, Advanced,\
  \ and Transitions lessons as well as family-friendly tables of our evergreen adventures\
  \ <em>#5-08: The Confirmation, #6-10: The Wounded Wisp</em>, and <em>#7-10: The\
  \ Consortium Compact</em>.</p> \n     <p>Besides the two special events and PSA,\
  \ tickets are still available for a variety of PFS scenarios throughout the event.\
  \ Visit the <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">the Gen Con website</a>\
  \ and look for events hosted by Paizo. You will also find listed Adventure Card\
  \ Guild scenarios and seminars on a variety of subjects. Come on out and join us,\
  \ everyone is welcome!</p> \n     <h2>Faction Pin Benefits</h2> \n     <p>At PaizoCon,\
  \ we debuted new <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/apparel\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ faction pins</a>. We also announced that while the pins wouldn't allow a reroll,\
  \ like other items, they would grant another in-game benefit to players. The team\
  \ put its head together and developed a really cool faction flavored program for\
  \ the pins.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Once per session, while wearing\
  \ a faction pin matching your character's faction, you may add 1 to any skill check.\
  \ If you apply this benefit to one of your faction's favored skills, listed below,\
  \ you instead roll 1d4 and add the result. For this roll you also treat the faction's\
  \ favored skill as if you were trained, even if you don't have a rank in it.</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Favored Skills</b></p> \n      <ul>\n       <li><b>Dark Archive:</b>\
  \ Knowledge (arcana), Linguistics, and Use Magic Device</li> \n       <li><b>The\
  \ Exchange:</b> Appraise, Intimidate, and Knowledge (local)</li> \n       <li><b>Grand\
  \ Lodge:</b> Diplomacy, Knowledge (history), and Survival</li> \n       <li><b>Liberty's\
  \ Edge:</b> Escape Artist, Perform, and Disable Device</li> \n       <li><b>Scarab\
  \ Sages: </b>Knowledge (any)</li> \n       <li><b>Silver Crusade:</b> Heal, Knowledge\
  \ (religion), and Sense Motive</li> \n       <li><b>Sovereign Court:</b>Bluff, Disguise,\
  \ and Knowledge (nobility)</li>\n      </ul> \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Regional\
  \ Venture-Coordinators</h2> \n     <p>When I added the Regional Venture-Coordinators\
  \ to the Venture-Officer team, the territorial divisions were based mostly on the\
  \ number of existing Venture-Officers. This led to some regions being very small\
  \ with a high number of volunteers and some regions spanning states, countries,\
  \ and even continents. At our recent PaizoCon meeting, we discussed rearranging\
  \ some boundaries and bringing on a new Regional-Coordinator. Below are the redrawn\
  \ regional boundaries:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Northwest</b>—Alaska,\
  \ Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, British Columbia, Alberta</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Southwest</b>—California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico,\
  \ all of Mexico, all of Central America and all of South America</p> \n      <p><b>Southeast</b>—\
  North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi,\
  \ Alabama, Georgia, and Florida</p> \n      <p><b>Midwest</b>—North Dakota, South\
  \ Dakota, Nebraska, Saskatchewan, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, and Manitoba</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>South</b>—Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas</p> \n      <p><b>Great Lakes</b>—\
  Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and Ontario</p> \n     \
  \ <p><b>Northeast</b>—Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey, New York,\
  \ Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Quebec &amp;\
  \ the Atlantic Regions of Canada</p> \n      <p><b><del>Mid-Atlantic</del></b>—\
  reassigned to Northeast and Southeast</p> \n      <p><b>Asia-Pacific</b>—Hawaii,\
  \ India, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, Okinawa, China and Eastern Asia</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>AAE (Africa-East Eurasia)</b>—Iceland, Netherlands, Denmark, Scandinavia,\
  \ Latvia, Russia, &amp; South Africa</p> \n      <p><b>WEME (West Eurasia-Middle\
  \ East)</b>—Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Ireland, UK, Italy, Croatia, Ukraine,\
  \ Israel, Turkey, &amp; UAE</p> \n      <p><b>Central Europe</b>—Germany, Austria,\
  \ Switzerland</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Over the past few months, we also\
  \ said goodbye to two coordinators, as they stepped back from their role. Please\
  \ take a moment to thank Art Lobdell and Jason Roeder for their service to the team.\
  \ Both are returning to the ranks of Venture-Captain, Art to New Jersey and Jason\
  \ to Missouri. I appreciate all they have done for Pathfinder Society as RVCs and\
  \ am very pleased they are staying on as Venture-Captains and lending their experience\
  \ to help keep our Society moving forward.</p> \n     <p>This left several vacancies\
  \ on the RVC team. It is my pleasure to introduce the newest Regional-Coordinators,\
  \ as well as one who is moving from his position leading the Mid-Atlantic region\
  \ to the newly created Central Europe region.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>South</b>—\
  Jon Cary<br> <b>Northwest</b>—Walter Sheppard<br> <b>Central Europe</b>—Dan Simons</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Campaign Flavor</h2> \n     <p>The past couple\
  \ weeks have seen heated discussions on our forums between Pathfinders concerning\
  \ the direction of the Pathfinder Society. Unfortunately, these escalated and hurtful\
  \ and inappropriate comments were exchanged. If you have strong feelings about what\
  \ should or should not be included in the campaign, we need you (and all community\
  \ members) to approach discussions in a calm and measured manner. You may also provide\
  \ feedback to <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Until next week's blog—safe travels to those heading out and about this\
  \ convention season. Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
