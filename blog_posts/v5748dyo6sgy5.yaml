  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The past month blew by in\
  \ a second, as we kept our focus on continuing to roll out pieces of Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition), as well as work to bring a new developer onto the team\
  \ and keep scenario production moving forward. We still have lots of changes/improvements\
  \ planned, including getting sanctioning for all campaigns caught up, fixing the\
  \ issues with Playtest/Achievement Points, convert the Pathfinder Society (second\
  \ edition) guide to its final format, and more! We ask for a bit more patience,\
  \ as we move to get all these items and more completed, as well as plan for the\
  \ next year of each campaign. Before we know it, June will be here, and we will\
  \ be looking to launch Starfinder Society Year 3!</p> \n     <p>Speaking of Year\
  \ 3, did you see last week’s blog about the newly released scenarios? More specifically,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First</a>? If you're a Starfinder and interested\
  \ in Year 3 storyline development, check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgxw?Enter-The-New-Seeker\"\
  >the blog</a> here. If you’ve played the scenario and wish to vote for your choice\
  \ of First Seeker, visit our survey <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9X7LJ3C\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n     <p>Regarding Pathfinder Society (second edition). We have\
  \ the <b>Retail Incentive Program</b> finalized. Hopefully we can get it added to\
  \ the policies website and guide soon, but until then, posting here will get it\
  \ into use. For the basics on how to use the Retail Incentive Programs, as well\
  \ as the specifics for Pathfinder Society (first edition), Starfinder Society, and\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies#retail-incentive\"\
  >follow this link</a>.</p> \n     <h4>Primary Benefit (for all characters)</h4>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Harder to Kill</b>: One time per game, reduce your dying condition\
  \ value by 1. This can prevent you from dying. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: For\
  \ the enhanced benefit, reduce your dying condition value by 2.</p> \n     <h4>Additional\
  \ Benefits (each character chooses one)</h4> \n     <p><b>Cheaper Healing</b>: Before\
  \ the end of the session, you can use the benefit to reduce the cost a single healing\
  \ spell or ritual to remove a condition, affliction, or death to 90%. <br><i>Enhanced\
  \ Version</i>: You instead reduce the cost to 80%.</p> \n     <p><b>Recover from\
  \ Wounds</b>: Once per game, you can rest for 10 minutes to gain the result of a\
  \ success on a trained DC 15 Treat Wounds. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: You instead\
  \ gain the result of a success on a master DC 30 Treat Wounds.</p> \n     <p><b>Bonus\
  \ Wealth</b>: When you roll a critical failure on a check to Earn Income, you get\
  \ the results of a failure instead. <br><i>Enhanced Version</i>: When you fail or\
  \ critically fail a check to Earn Income, you earn double the base amount of money\
  \ from a failure.</p> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n     <p>Attending SkalCon\
  \ two weeks ago afforded me the opportunity to recognize several individuals for\
  \ their contributions to our organized play programs. For one recipient, we reaffirmed\
  \ the award given at Gen Con and recognized her in front of her hometown crowd.\
  \ For the others, some surprised looks turned to smiles as they received their awards.\
  \ Please take a moment to thank the following community members for their efforts\
  \ on behalf of our gaming community and congratulate them on receiving new Org Play\
  \ numbers!</p> \n     <table width=\"500\" align=\"center\"> \n      <tbody>\n \

  \ marks a momentous occasion for several GMs, as they earned their 5th GM star.\
  \ To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique\
  \ scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain.\
  \ A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! Thank you\
  \ to the GMs listed below for their time and service on behalf of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society! We appreciate you very much. Huzzah on their achievement!</p> \n    \

  \ \n     <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>We’re closing in on having the nova\
  \ evaluation tool appear on venture-captain’s “organizer” tab at Paizo.com. Until\
  \ then, please email evaluation submissions to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for collation.</p> \n     <p>With the launch of Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition), we expect to see GMs with glyphs soon. If you’ve GMed\
  \ 10 or more games, post in the comments so we can recognize the GMs of our newest\
  \ program!</p> \n     <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>Though the year draws\
  \ to a close, convention season hasn’t wrapped up! You can play in Society games\
  \ at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes all submissions as of\
  \ 1 October. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request\
  \ for support or have them email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the\
  \ list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or\
  \ Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check\
  \ out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>\
