  \ Part II</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 21, 2008</p> \n    <p>Back on\
  \ June 23, I gave you a preview of the Character Traits system we're introducing\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion\">Pathfinder Companion</a> line.\
  \ There, I'd mentioned that there were several different kinds of traits for you\
  \ to mix and match—with a single trait roughly equaling half a feat in power, by\
  \ picking to Character Traits your character effectively starts with a bonus feat\
  \ that's tailored specifically to his or her background and personality.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Today, I'd like to preview what traits look like. Presented below are five\
  \ of the ten Combat traits. These traits comprise a small portion of the 40 basic\
  \ traits presented in the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x7\"><i>Second Darkness Player's\
  \ Guide</i></a>, and represent generic traits that you can pick from for any character\
  \ for any campaign in any setting. Later installments of Pathfinder Companion will\
  \ present more Golarion-specific traits for race, region, and religion, but these\
  \ basic 40 traits comprise the baseline for them all. Again, when you pick your\
  \ two character traits, you can only pick one from a particular category—a character\
  \ can't have two Combat traits, for example. Picking traits from different categories,\
  \ after all, is a great way to make a character seem a bit more well-rounded.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But enough of the chatter. On with the preview traits! (Oh, and you'll\
  \ see lots of \"trait\" bonuses mentioned; this is a new type of bonus that never\
  \ stacks with itself, but stacks with other bonuses.)</p> \n    <p><b>Anatomist</b>:\
  \ You have studied the workings of anatomy, either as a student at university or\
  \ as an apprentice mortician or necromancer. You know where to aim your blows to\
  \ strike vital organs and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all rolls made to confirm\
  \ critical hits.</p> \n    <p><b>Armor Expert</b>: You have worn armor as long as\
  \ you can remember, either as part of your training to become a knight's squire\
  \ or simply because you were seeking to emulate a hero. Your childhood armor wasn't\
  \ the real thing as far as protection, but it did encumber you as much as real armor\
  \ would have, and you've grown used to moving in such suits with relative grace.\
  \ When you wear armor of any sort, reduce that suit's armor check penalty by 1,\
  \ to a minimum check penalty of 0. </p> \n    <p><b>Bullied</b>: You were bullied\
  \ often as a child, and you are now constantly ready to defend yourself with your\
  \ fists when an enemy comes near. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack of opportunity\
  \ attack rolls made with unarmed strikes. Note that this trait does not grant the\
  \ ability to make attacks of opportunity with your unarmed strikes—you'll need to\
  \ take a level of monk, the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, or some other similar\
  \ power to gain the use of this Character Trait. However, that doesn't prevent you\
  \ from selecting this trait. You'll simply not be able to make use of it until a\
  \ later point if you do. </p> \n    <p><b>Courageous</b>: Your childhood was brutal,\
  \ yet you persevered primarily through force of will and the hope that no matter\
  \ how hard things might get, as long as you kept a level head you'd make it through.\
  \ You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p> \n    <p><b>Deft\
  \ Dodger</b>: Growing up in a rough neighborhood or a dangerous environment has\
  \ honed your senses. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves.</p> \n    <p>James\
