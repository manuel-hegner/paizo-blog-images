  \ also means it's already time for another sneak peek at new minis from the upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of prepainted plastic\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> gaming figures from our\
  \ friends at WizKids! This week I've decided to focus on two winged figures, one\
  \ quite small, and the other very large! Let's take to the air and see what all\
  \ the fuss is about!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160415-Imp.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160415-Imp_360.jpeg\"></a>\n    \
  \ </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is the Imp, a diabolical little fellow who\
  \ makes a perfect familiar for a villain or for the somewhat villainous arcane spellcaster\
  \ that seems to infect nearly every party. Even though this figure is Tiny, I love\
  \ all of the detail WizKids put into his face, and he's a nice addition to the ranks\
  \ of devils that we'll continue to see in this set as we move toward its October\
  \ release. The Imp is an uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Look, up in the sky, it's a freakin' terrifying raptor\
  \ with claws as long as short swords! Here's hoping he's friendly! Giant Eagles\
  \ have been a staple of fantasy since long before J.R.R. Tolkien had them rescue\
  \ a bunch of hobbits from a tree, and I'm pleased to finally bring this \"staple\"\
  \ creature to the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. At\
  \ the Large size and positioned in the uncommon rarity, it should be pretty easy\
  \ to build up a terrifying flock!</p> \n     <p>And that's it for this week. I've\
  \ got to space these things out a bit to make it all the way to October! In the\
  \ meantime, keep on keepin' on, and keep up with the suggestions for new minis we\
  \ can make for you!</p> \n     <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
