    \ As a result, we've managed to get our hands on a few early copies, and we're\
    \ extremely excited. Although I won't speak to the differences between the stories\
    \ of Winter Witch and Prince of Wolves just now—you can read the summaries and\
    \ see them for yourself here—I will speak to the production values and say that\
    \ we've made some aesthetic improvements this time around. Our debut novel was\
    \ gorgeous, but with an improved paper stock and an increased font size for added\
    \ readability, Winter Witch is even thicker and meatier. It also features a brand\
    \ new map of the region in which the story's set, by our own talented Crystal\
    \ Frasier, and all the Pathfinder Tales novels going forward will have maps in\
    \ the front. At Paizo, we aren't afraid to tweak the formula and make improvement\
    \ as ideas occur to us, and it's our hope that if you liked Prince of Wolves,\
    \ this book will give you that much more to love! Now to go stand by the viaduct,\
    \ look longingly out toward the port, and try to figure out which cargo container\
    \ is ours... James Sutter Fiction Editor"
