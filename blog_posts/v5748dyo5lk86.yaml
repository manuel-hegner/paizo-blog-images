  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October\
  \ 26, 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're deep in design on the Ultimate\
  \ add-on series of character decks for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9vmz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Combat-AddOn-Deck\"><em>Ultimate\
  \ Combat</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9vtb?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Magic-AddOn-Deck\"\

  ><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9x03?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Equipment-AddOn-Deck\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a>. (We broke the news on this series in <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz5?Announcing-Ultimate-AddOn-Decks\">an earlier blog</a>.)</p>\

  \     <p>So far from final art, it's not even in the same dictionary as \"final\"\
  \ and \"art.\"</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The idea is to supplement all the character\
  \ decks we've made so far with decks of new cards. If you're playing a home game,\
  \ you can just add Ultimate decks into any Adventure Path box. If you're playing\
  \ in organized play, you'll be able to use a character deck—say, the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy97if?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Wizard-Class-Deck\"><em>Wizard\
  \ Class Deck</em></a>—and one Ultimate deck. If you'd like to play the character\
  \ that's in the Ultimate deck, you can supplement that character with the cards\
  \ from one other character deck. (There will likely be some limitations on which\
  \ decks you can use with each of the characters from the Ultimate decks, but we\
  \ haven't settled this yet.)</p> \n    <p>So as we're making these decks—moving\
  \ cards in and out, designing cycles, even rethinking their reasonings for existence—\
  we keep hitting three questions. If you'd like to participate in helping us think\
  \ these things out, <b>leave your suggestions in the comments</b>.</p> \n    <h2>Question\
  \ 1: What utility cards must be in the decks?</h2> \n    <p>We need to give all\
  \ of the existing characters the cards they need to be more awesome. For some of\
  \ those characters, they need cards they don't have access to, such as Potion of\
  \ Healing. A melee character who can't get a Greatsword at any tier is going to\
  \ be sad about it. And even if your character deck has a Cure in it, you're unlikely\
  \ to be upset about having access to a <i>second</i> Cure. So we're tracking all\
  \ the cards we just can't get along without.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6821-PotionOfHealing.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6821-PotionOfHealing_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-RemoveCurse_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Sometimes \"boring\" is another word for \"gimme that.\"</p>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>And sometimes we need to help characters play in sets they weren't\
  \ designed for. All those Curses in Mummy's Mask are pretty nasty, so you might\
  \ want Remove Curse. A lot.</p> \n    <p>Where in the Ultimate series such a card\
  \ goes is also relevant. <em>Ultimate Intrigue</em> doesn't need a Greatsword. <em>Ultimate\
  \ Combat</em> does.</p> \n    <p>Just as significantly, we're looking at cards we\
  \ don't need to put anywhere. We don't need to put any Blessings of the Gods in\
  \ the Ultimate decks, because the other character decks have as many as they need.\
  \ Low-powered cards like Dart and Leather Armor seem unlikely to make an appearance\
  \ in a deck with the word Ultimate in the title.</p> \n    <h2>Question 2: What\
  \ cards are our favorites?</h2> \n    <p>We want to see reappearances of many of\
  \ the cool things we've created over the years, especially since Skull &amp; Shackles.\
  \ (That's the set that was mostly done when we made the first seven class decks.)\
  \ Every designer on this team has a different set of these, but there are some we're\
  \ quickly reaching consensus on.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-FalconCrown.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6034-FalconCrown_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RiffleScrolls.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RiffleScrolls_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-BabyTriceratops.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-BabyTriceratops_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>One of these is particularly fun at parties.</p>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>For example, Mummy's Mask was the set where we made some bizarre armors.\
  \ Even people who ragged on armor on a daily basis were stopped cold by a card like\
  \ Falcon Crown from <a href=\"/products/btpy9nd7\"><em>Secret of the Sphinx</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We also love cards that let someone be something their deck wouldn't\
  \ otherwise allow them to be. Riffle Scrolls, from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a>, lets a player with the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy97ib?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Fighter-Class-Deck\"><em>Fighter\
  \ Class Deck</em></a> hold on to spells he might play, even if that opportunity\
  \ is rarer than it is for, say, Ezren.</p> \n    <p>And of course, it's often just\
  \ about what makes a certain designer smile. For example, I find the Baby Triceratops\
  \ adorable. Hey there! Who's a good little trikey-wikey? You are. YES, <em>YOU</em>\
  \ ARE. So yeah, there's probably going to be a Baby Triceratops in one of these\
  \ decks. You might want to prepare to bury a lot of cards.</p> \n    <h2>Question\
  \ 3: What cards are missing?</h2> \n    <p>This is where we're spending a lot of\
  \ our time. Usually when we make a set or a character deck, we're trying to model\
  \ something specific. Write a Demon-fighting set, make a lot of things to fight\
  \ Demons.</p> \n    <p>But left unchained, what are we going to do? Well, a lot\
  \ of things. Create more stained-glass blessings for our favorite gods, for example.\
  \ Japanese weapons for Hayato. New books for Enora. Maybe some new poisons in <em>Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue</em>. And some just weird things like—hey, did you know there's a luchador\
  \ mask in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a> book? We did.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-GrapplerMask.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-GrapplerMask_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Por el bando rudo.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Chad noted the other\
  \ day that we had exactly one pair of non-promo shoes in the entire game, the Boots\
  \ of Teleportation. (I suggested the Reed Moccasin, but he wasn't buying it.) Now,\
  \ why do we need more shoes? Beats me. But now that he's said it, somebody on the\
  \ team is likely to demand more shoes.</p> \n    <p>There are all sorts of things\
  \ we'd like to do with these decks. But what do you want to see? Leave comments\
  \ below about what cards you'd like us to include and where. Thanks!</p> \n    <p>Mike\
