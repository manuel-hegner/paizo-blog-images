  \ we plan to make this bigger than last year! I am scheduling 210 tables of Pathfinder\
  \ Society over three days. We will be offering all season five scenarios multiple\
  \ times, including the debut of the final four scenarios for season five. We will\
  \ also be debuting a playtest of one of the Season 6 Gen Con Specials on Friday\
  \ night. This is similar to the multi-table special that will be run as one of the\
  \ Gen Con specials, but like last year, there will be changes made to polish the\
  \ adventure for its final publication. Finally, we be offering the GM 101 and GM\
  \ 201 sessions again. It should be an awesome time.</span></p> \n    <p>I need a\
  \ minimum of 75 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society games and I'll keep taking\
  \ volunteer GMs until the slots are filled! I also need 4 Volunteer Assistants for\
  \ the showâ€”these folks will not GM, but will instead help me run Pathfinder Society\
  \ HQ and will be our go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. Finally,\
  \ we need 6-8 volunteers for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.</p> \n    <p>Below\
  \ you will find the reward structure for volunteering at PaizoCon 2014. Keep in\
  \ mind that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific event. We will let you\
  \ know the slots you have been assigned to before the lottery goes live. This should\
  \ allow you plenty of time to plan a schedule with your friends who are also attending\
  \ PaizoCon 2014. Please let me know via email which days you will be at the convention\
  \ and how many slots you are volunteering for at PaizoCon 2014. </p> \n    <h2>Volunteer\
  \ Tiers and Rewards</h2> \n    <p><b>Volunteer Assistant</b>: 4 needed, treated\
  \ as a Tier 1 GM</p> \n    <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers</b>: Tier 1 GM volunteers\
  \ are my everyday GMs. They are invaluable to making the show a success! Tier 1\
  \ GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 5 slots. I only have room for 30\
  \ Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this tier. Volunteers\
  \ will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I reserve the right\
  \ to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over new volunteers.\
  \ Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts that you'll be able\
  \ to attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>A FREE 3-day\
  \ PaizoCon 2014 badge</li> \n     <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for Paizo.com credit,\
  \ useable at the show or anytime after, including with your subscriptions.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>A FREE copy of one printed Paizo product of your choice valued at $49.99\
  \ or less.</li> \n     <li>A FREE PFS goblin volunteer t-shirt.</li> \n     <li>A\
  \ special Pathfinder Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li> \n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Tier 2 GM Volunteers</b>: While the rewards for volunteering for this\
  \ tier are smaller, the majority of my volunteers will come from Tier 2. Tier 2\
  \ GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 4 slots. Tier 2 GMs receive:</p> \n    <ul>\
  \ \n     <li>A FREE 3-day PaizoCon 2014 badge.</li> \n     <li>A $10-per-slot voucher\
  \ for Paizo.com credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including with your\
  \ subscriptions.</li> \n     <li>A FREE PFS goblin volunteer t-shirt.</li> \n  \
  \   <li>A special Pathfinder Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li> \n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p><b>Tier 3 GM Volunteers</b>: This is the minimum volunteer level.\
  \ Tier 3 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 2 slots. Tier 3 GMs receive:</p> \n\
  \    <ul> \n     <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for Paizo.com credit, useable at the\
  \ show or anytime after, including subscriptions.</li> \n     <li>A FREE PFS goblin\
  \ volunteer t-shirt.</li> \n     <li>A special Pathfinder Society GM boon available\
  \ only at PaizoCon.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>While we will gladly accept anyone\
  \ who wants to run just one slot during the show, there are no rewards for doing\
  \ so other than our thanks.</p> \n    <p>When volunteering, please be specific about\
  \ what days you are volunteering for. I will assign folks to scenarios on an as-needed\
  \ basis, so you really only need to tell me the day(s) you're volunteering for.\
  \ You may also include the tier of scenarios you are most comfortable GMing and\
  \ I will try to assign you that schedule accordingly. I will update the needs in\
  \ the thread below as I receive volunteers, so you may look there to remain up to\
  \ date on where we still need help. You must have a paizo.com account and you must\
  \ include your paizo.com email and message board name in your email to me, or I\
  \ won't be able to get you a badge (obviously this is only for volunteers who are\
  \ volunteering for 4 or more slots).</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Slot 1</b>:\
  \ Friday 8 A.M. to 1 P.M.</p> \n     <p><b>Slot 2</b>: Friday 1 P.M. to 6 P.M.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Slot 3</b>: Friday 7 P.M. to 12 A.M. </p> \n     <p><b>Slot 4</b>:\

  \ \n     <p><b>Slot 6</b>: Sunday 9 A.M. to 2 P.M.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n  \
  \  <p>All PaizoCon 2014 volunteers please email me at mike.brock@paizo.com with\
  \ the subject line PaizoCon Volunteer.</p> \n    <p>Thanks in advance for volunteering,\
  \ good luck, and have a great spring convention season!</p> \n    <p></p> \n   \
