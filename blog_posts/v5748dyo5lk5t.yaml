  articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy Monday! Welcome to another\
  \ installment of our <a href=\"/products/btpy9u16?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles: Maze of Death</em></a> previews. Releasing next month,\
  \ <em>Maze of Death</em> is full of wickedly cool figures for you to encounter in\
  \ your Pathfinder campaign. Up first this week is the Pitborn Fighter, a common\
  \ medium based off of artwork found in <a href=\"/products/btpy8qzz?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Fiends\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends</em></a>. I think he looks rad,\
  \ especially for a common. The horns and spikes on his face are great, and I really\
  \ love the armor.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-PitbornFighter.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-PitbornFighter_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Next, we have the Ice Devil, an uncommon Large. While\
  \ the paint scheme may be simple (ice), I love the detailing of its carapace, and\
  \ the spear is freaking cool. This figure is based off of art from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8tj5?Pathfinder-Pawns-Bestiary-Box\"><em>Bestiary Box</em></a>, and\
  \ I really feel it does this devil service.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-IceDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-IceDevil_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>To wrap up our devilish lineup is the Apostate Devil,\
  \ which is a rare medium in this set. I think my favorite part of this figure is\
  \ his cloak, which,if you look closely, is made out of the skins of its victims.\
  \ Would you like to join its collection?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-ApostateDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-ApostateDevil_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Since it's fall, why not top off this week's preview\
  \ with some festive snakes? To start, we have the Viper Vine, an uncommon large.\
  \ The texturing and root fangs this things has is the stuff of nightmares. Think\
  \ it is safe to take a day trip to see the fall colors? Wrong. Leafy poisonous death\
  \ awaits.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-ViperVine.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-ViperVine_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Next, what is better than a giant snake? A giant snake\
  \ with two heads that can split and reattach as need be to more easily hunt you\
  \ down and eat you. Meet the Amphisbaena, an uncommon large figure. This figure\
  \ is just down right cool, and if any of your players have Ophidiophobia, I highly\
  \ suggest you pickup at least one.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \  <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-Amphisbaena.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-Amphisbaena_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Finally, while not snakelike in shape, still slimy,\
  \ gross, and creepy, is the Canopy Lurker, a rare medium. Afraid of Octopi? Well\
  \ then this is a must have miniature, because this is a giant carnivorous octopus\
  \ that lives on land! Yay! I really like the color transitions, and the face is\
  \ nightmare fuel.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-CanopyLurker.jpg\"\
