  \ Playtest in February, some of the first questions revolved around what Pathfinder\
  \ Society would look like in the new edition. One of the questions the organized\
  \ play team asked was what gave the Society its heart - made it the robust organized\
  \ play system it is - and what could be improved. We've spent the last six months\
  \ analyzing the past ten years of Society play, from how we organize scenarios to\
  \ what role the Society has in the greater Pathfinder universe. We also asked our\
  \ community feedback, posting several threads soliciting commentary on some of the\
  \ key pieces of the Society. While we still have months of playtesting to go and\
  \ aren't ready to make final decisions about what to include in our new Society,\
  \ we did want to revisit the forum threads where we posed questions to the community,\
  \ discuss the emerging trends, and refocus the discussion towards the most likely\
  \ options.</p> \n    <p>Eight threads are too much for any one person to monitor,\
  \ especially when they span pages and pages of commentary. To make the task easier,\
  \ each of the organized play team members focused on two threads. Over the next\
  \ few months, we will dedicate at least one blog every month on our discussion.\
  \ This week, we are going to focus on the Tier discussion and how it impacts level\
  \ gain, which was one of Linda's foci, and the revised Roleplaying Guild Guide,\
  \ which is an area I've monitoring.</p> \n    <p>At the end of this blog is a link\
  \ to a SurveyMonkey form with a few questions regarding the discussion topics of\
  \ tiers, experience points, and the Roleplaying Guild guide. Please read through\
  \ the blog, then take the survey. Just to note, we are only talking Pathfinder Society\
  \ version 2 in this survey. Depending on how things work out, what we decide for\
  \ version 2 may make its way into Starfinder Society, but that is a topic for another\
  \ day.</p> \n    <p>From Linda-Zayas Palmer, Organized Play Developer:</p> \n  \
  \  <blockquote> \n     <h2>Tiers</h2> \n     <p>One of the primary topics of this\
  \ thread is the appropriate size for tiers in scenarios. The community discussion\
  \ centered around three primary models for the size of typical tiers.</p> \n   \
  \  <ul> \n      <li>Tiers that are three levels wide with no sub tiers (Level 1,\
  \ 3, 5, etc. scenarios that are playable by characters within one level of the adventure's\
  \ stated level - level 5 adventures are playable by level 4-6 characters.)</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Tiers that are four levels wide with two sub tiers, as in Starfinder\
  \ Society (Tier 1-4, 3-6, 5-8, etc.)</li> \n      <li>Tiers that are five levels\
  \ wide with two sub tiers, as in the current version of Pathfinder Society (Tier\
  \ 1-5, 3-7, 5-9, etc.).</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>There were also some interesting\
  \ points in the thread about the possibilities for non-standard tier sizes to accommodate\
  \ particularly low or high-level play. We are likely to continue to offer adventures\
  \ with narrow tier bands for low-level characters (Such as Tier 1 or 1-2 scenarios).\
  \ When it comes to possibilities for higher level play, that is a bridge we'll be\
  \ looking to cross in the future, when there are PCs available to play adventures\
  \ of those levels, and when we've all had a chance to become familiar with how high-level\
  \ play works in Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n     <p>The tier discussion also\
  \ included a fair amount of discussion about APL (Average Party Level) and how to\
  \ use it to determine which adjustments to apply to the adventure based upon the\
  \ strength of the party. This conversation included ideas for how best to calculate\
  \ APL, and how best to make adjustments that serve both large groups of lower level\
  \ PCs and small groups of higher-level PCs. Because the specifics of how we handle\
  \ adjustments will have to depend upon the size of the tiers, we aren't ready to\
  \ offer complete proposals on this topic yet. However, as you may have noticed if\
  \ you GMed one of the Pathfinder Society Playtest scenarios, we are strongly considering\
  \ writing scenarios for a baseline of four players, with step adjustments provided\
  \ for 5 and 6 (possibly even 7) players, versus the Pathfinder Society model of\
  \ writing for tables of six players with a four-player adjustment.</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ are considering several models for XP gain, based on the suggestions we have received.\
  \ Regardless of the model, longer adventures like Adventure Paths would give more\
  \ XP than a standard scenario, and quests would give less. Which brings up a discussion\
  \ on the role of quests. The current default model for quests is to release 1-2\
  \ \"packs\" of quests per year, which each contain 4 or 5 adventures that together\
  \ tell a cohesive story. We've received a lot of feedback, both on the forums and\
  \ in person, that this model creates scheduling challenges. What we currently investigating\
  \ is a model based around self-contained quests that release on a regular schedule,\
  \ such as 1 quest per month. This would allow for more flexibility in scheduling,\
  \ as the storyline won't be cohesive across individual quests, as well as maintain\
  \ a constant flow of short events to be run at conventions, game stores, and other\
  \ venues throughout the year.</p> \n     <p>With the above quest revisions in mind,\
  \ which of the models below do you prefer?</p> \n     <p>The level gain portion\
  \ of the thread also included some suggestions to create an XP system in which characters\
  \ leveled up more quickly at low levels and more slowly at high levels. While these\
  \ are interesting ideas and they may work best for some folks, the prevailing preference\
  \ toward simplicity in the way we handle XP makes us unlikely to follow up on them.\
  \ Instead, we would recommend that players looking to level up more slowly at higher\
  \ levels use a voluntary system like slow track.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of slow\
  \ track, we'd like to hear your thoughts on that as well. In Pathfinder Society,\
  \ there is a leveling option called slow track, where players can choose to receive\
  \ less XP, gold, and Fame for playing adventures', causing them to level more slowly.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>The Roleplaying Guild Guide</h2> \n    <p>The discussion\
  \ on tiers, levels, and experience took a goodly amount of space, so I'm going to\
  \ keep the guide conversation brief. Many of the comments about the current guide\
  \ involved its size, organization, and accessibility. To that end, we are looking\
  \ at stripping the guide back to its bare bones and put it together from the ground\
  \ up. I've included survey questions about what should be in the guide and how it\
  \ should be organized.</p> \n    <p>Part of this discussion revolves around delivery\
  \ options. The big question at this point revolves around the feasibility of supporting\
  \ a living document that resides online with print options. This would allow for\
  \ faster updates and more integration between the guide, campaign clarifications,\
  \ additional resources, and FAQ. Conversely, it means the guide is always in flux\
  \ and could cause issues if internet access is not robust.</p> \n    <p>With the\
  \ above thread discussions in mind, please take a moment to visit <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XJW9KTJ\"\
