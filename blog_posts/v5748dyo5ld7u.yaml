  \ Pathfinder Society player base, most of my experiences and understanding of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play is based on what I have seen, experienced and organized\
  \ in the United States. However, the campaign and player base is a worldwide network.\
  \ What I have learned since stepping into the Campaign Coordinator role is that\
  \ Pathfinder Society experiences can be varying and different in other parts of\
  \ the world, including Canada. This includes the way game days and conventions are\
  \ organized, the expectations of the campaign’s past, current, and future scenarios,\
  \ and the direction the campaign should move toward.</p> \n   <p>I think one of\
  \ the most important responsibilities of a Campaign Coordinator is trying to understand\
  \ the make-up of the entire fan base, not just the largest percentage of the players.\
  \ I also think the campaign can be better served if all of us have a better understanding\
  \ of how our fellow gamers participate, promote, and try to grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ in their own regions of the world.</p> \n   <p>With that in mind, I plan to devote\
  \ one blog a month to a different region where there is an active Pathfinder Society\
  \ presence. I have tasked my international Venture-Captains with sending me a write-up\
  \ of what Pathfinder Society is like in their part of the world. Most of what you\
  \ will read is in their own words. There may be some slight editing changes, but\
  \ by and large, what you will be reading is the Venture-Captain’s perspective on\
  \ what Pathfinder Society is like under their guidance in their region.</p> \n \
  \  <p>I hope all of you will find the articles as interesting and informative as\
  \ I do. First up is the United Kingdom under the direction of Venture-Captain Dave\
  \ Harrison and Venture-Lieutenant Rob Silk. I plan to attend Paizo Con UK this year,\
  \ and am excited to get an insight into what I can expect when I arrive in mid-July\
  \ (and no, I do not fear the curse). Without further ado, I present Dave Harrison’\
  s report on Pathfinder Society in the United Kingdom.</p>\n   <br> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <div style=\"float: left; width: 180px; padding-right: .5em;\">\n     <img\

  \  <p>The Pathfinder Society is global, not just on Golarion but also in our world!\
  \ While it has its origins in the United States, it has been active in the UK since\
  \ its inception. And so, I’ve been asked to introduce you all to Pathfinder Society\
  \ play in the UK.</p> \n    <p>Who am I to talk about this? My name is Dave Harrison,\
  \ also known online as Wintergreen, and after being a GM and playing roleplaying\
  \ games for far too long, I’m a self-confessed Paizo addict who has somehow become\
  \ the UK Venture-Captain. Of course, it’s not just me over here. I’ve lost count\
  \ of the many players and GMs we’ve recruited over the last few years. Oh, that’\
  s not a royal “we” by the way. I’m also including my co-conspirator and Venture-Lieutenant,\
  \ Rob Silk, in all of this. (Make sure you pronounce Lieutenant the British way\
  \ too!)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120205-Pic1.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Pathfinder and Paizo itself have always been popular\
  \ here in the UK. When Paizo staff members have come over from the US, we have made\
  \ sure they have felt very welcome despite any differences in the roleplaying cultures—\
  two countries separated by a common hobby?</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder Society was\
  \ officially launched in the UK at Gen Con UK 2008 with a contingent of Paizo staff\
  \ and that was an immediate success. Pathfinder Society games were sold out and\
  \ everybody was talking about the quality of the scenarios. From that, I managed\
  \ to talk my way into helping organize GMs and games at several conventions. Flush\
  \ with success, I did something that might be called foolish, and has certainly\
  \ influenced my life! I asked, on the Paizo messageboards, if there was any interest\
  \ in a UK-based Pathfinder Society convention—our very own version of PaizoCon.\
  \ The answer was positive and, somehow, one of the most disorganized of roleplayers\
  \ found himself setting up a new convention. Thankfully, with the help of a lucky\
  \ Bluff roll, I managed to talk a few other people into helping me!</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ the first PaizoCon UK ran in July 2009 at Aston University’s Business School &amp;\
  \ Conference Centre. I’ll admit, even on that Saturday morning, I was worrying that\
  \ nobody would turn up and I’d be sitting alone in a large room for the whole weekend.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120205-Pic2.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Thankfully, that wasn’t the case. Over fifty people\
  \ attended, including special guests such as our PaizoCon UK regular Richard Pett,\
  \ some awesome GMs, and a fantastically keen group of players. Our only missing\
  \ element was that Nick Logue, then Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator, couldn’\
  t attend. Even so, by the end of the Sunday, people were already talking about how\
  \ it would go next year! Even before I finished asking about doing another one,\
  \ I heard a resounding “YES!”</p> \n    <p>The next year we had over 70 people attending,\
  \ including Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator Joshua Frost, and we were given\
  \ the opportunity to playtest the Year of the Shadow Lodge event. We also have a\
  \ tradition of a Friday Night Balti meal to get everybody socializing at the start\
  \ of the convention. Thankfully the waiters don’t bat an eyelid when we ask for\
  \ a table for everybody.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>By 2011, we had grown to over 100 people\
  \ gaming across three different rooms in the conference center. Although one special\
  \ guest, Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator Hyrum Savage, had to drop out at\
  \ the last minute, we still held the Grand Melee where our high-level team “Szallus’\
  \ Mighty Taldan Beard” won through with a world-beating score. We concluded the\
  \ convention with Shadow’s Last Stand, bringing the Year of the Shadow Lodge to\
  \ a satisfactory conclusion.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ on the 21st and 22nd of July, with a host of almost 150 delegates and special\
  \ guests, including Richard Pett, Eva Widermann, and many European Venture-Captains\
  \ and Venture-Lieutenants, and Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator Mike Brock\
  \ is braving the rumored curse to help us with an Olympic Class PaizoCon UK. Full\
  \ details can be found on our website at www.paizocon.co.uk. </p>\n    <p>PaizoCon\
  \ UK is our flagship, the Pathfinder Society convention for the UK, but it is far\
  \ from the only event we attend (some might say dominate when the Pathfinders are\
  \ noisily adventuring) in the UK. I have made efforts to ensure Pathfinder Society\
  \ is represented at other major UK conventions, particularly Conception, the UK\
  \ Games Expo, Oddcon, and Dragonmeet. Pathfinders turn up at many smaller conventions,\
  \ fan-organized events, and regular games held at clubs, societies, and players’\
  \ homes.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120205-Pic6.jpg\"\

  \ in the UK?</p> \n    <p>Certainly we continue to grow—particularly into other\
  \ parts of the UK besides England. Plans are in motion for a PaizoCon Wales, and\
  \ Scotland and Ireland have growing numbers of Pathfinders. I am constantly recruiting\
  \ GMs, more people willing to do my job for me by running and organizing games at\
  \ conventions. We have more and more special events planned as well. Details will\
  \ be disclosed at a future date.</p> \n    <p>While the UK lacks the US tradition\
  \ of games being run in stores, such events are something I am working on. A few\
  \ such events have already taken place and, inspired by the Beginner Box Bash event,\
  \ we are planning a “Learn to Play Pathfinder” day at the Sheffield store Patriot\
  \ Games on March 31st.</p> \n    <p>Convention organizers and store owners who wish\
  \ to have Pathfinder Society events in the UK should contact me via <a href=\"mailto:paizoconuk@hotmail.com\"\
  >paizoconuk@hotmail.com</a> or through our website at <a href=\"http://paizocon.co.uk\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">http://paizocon.co.uk/</a> for support.</p> \n    <p>I am very\
  \ proud to say that here in the UK the Pathfinder Society has established an excellent\
  \ reputation for roleplaying, quality adventures, and skilled GMs. Convention organizers\
  \ invite us to their events where we are consistently over-subscribed. Most of all,\
  \ I am happy to report that when players are talking, I hear descriptions of heroic\
  \ deeds, intriguing personalities, and thrilling adventures—exactly what gets reported\
  \ in the Pathfinder Chronicles!</p> \n    <p>Dave Harrison<br> <i>Venture-Captain</i></p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>And there you have it, our first international Pathfinder\
  \ Society blog. If you are in another country and do not have a Venture-Captain,\
  \ but think you can do as good a job as Dave did above, please do not hesitate to\
  \ send me a write-up about Pathfinder Society play in your area of the world and\
  \ include some photos.</p> \n   <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign\
