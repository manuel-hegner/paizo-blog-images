  \ last May, Paizo launched a new Core Set for the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i>.\
  \ At the same time, the organized play team updated the Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Guild into the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. Three months out, we asked one\
  \ of our active volunteers to give their impressions of current Society. Without\
  \ further ado, I’m turning the blog over to our guest author, Jonathan Ng.</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote style=\"font-style:italic\"> \n      <p>Hi, I’m Jonathan and I’\
  m one of the Venture Lieutenants for the Seattle region.&nbsp; We play weekly at\
  \ the Mox Boarding House in Bellevue, which is one of the local staple game stores\
  \ in the region.&nbsp; We are currently running through the previous Season, Season\
  \ of Tapestry’s Tides.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-normalscenario.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>We have about 8-9 or so players a week, and often\
  \ this presents to us a logistical dilemma - how do we balance out our party?&nbsp;\
  \ The RPG side of the Pathfinder Society can often have this type of dilemma, but\
  \ we often need to go through a much longer period of time with the same characters\
  \ and parties - this could be fatal in higher level scenarios!</p> \n      <p>Some\
  \ days, we balance out our party perfectly, with a Strength character at each table,\
  \ a Dexterity character, some healing, some Arcane… and then some time ago, we had\
  \ a scenario where we decided to seat people according to when they arrived.&nbsp;\
  \ We ended up with a party of Athnul, Hayato, Lirianne, and Seltyiel, and a party\
  \ of Alahazra, 2 Linis, and Radillo. Guess where most of the high level weapons\
  \ ended up? The poor weapon users keep telling us to share, and yet this has happened\
  \ not once, but twice.&nbsp; Worse yet, this scenario just happens to punish non-magic\
  \ users. Luckily, the martial table managed to make it through.</p> \n      <p>One\
  \ of the things I like the most about the Pathfinder Card Society scenarios is that\
  \ the developers often use Society scenarios to test out interesting concepts.&nbsp;\
  \ The concept of the Defensive Stance in Mummy’s Mask and the siege scenario was\
  \ actually previewed in Season of the Runelords.&nbsp; When I first played that\
  \ scenario, everything about it seemed new and different - I think I played way\
  \ too many “defeat and corner the villain” scenarios at that point.&nbsp; Tapestry’\
  s Tides also has a scenario like this:</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-nineships_500.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>Instead of having locations, the scenario in question\
  \ required you to fight on ships, then beat the actual ship to close the location.&nbsp;\
  \ Luckily you didn’t actually need to close all 9 locations to win - that would\
  \ have been a nightmare!</p> \n      <p>With all the cards we bring every week to\
  \ host a game, the box runners often have to find creative storage solutions.&nbsp;\
  \ One of the box runners brings a set in a card bandoleer. I bring something that\
  \ looks somewhat like a rounded-off suitcase.&nbsp; And one of the box runners has\
  \ an actual, honest-to-goodness Pathfinder Adventure Chest:</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>I’m very glad for the people in my region who are\
  \ interested enough in the game to play through these Seasons.&nbsp; It has been\
  \ great playing together with them and I hope to do this for a long time.</p> \n\
