  \ \n    <p>We are thrilled to announce our 2019 Guests of Honor are Liane Merciel\
  \ and Wayne Reynolds!</p> \n    <p>Liane Merciel is the author of critically acclaimed\
  \ novels including <em>The River Kings' Road</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Last Flight</em>,\
  \ and <em>Pathfinder Tales: Hellknight</em>. She has also contributed to game materials\
  \ such as Paizo's <em>Nidal: Land of Shadows</em>, <em>Faiths of Golarion</em>,\
  \ and other forthcoming releases.</p> \n    <p>Wayne Reynolds's work has appeared\
  \ in roleplaying games, collectable card games, board games, and miniature designs.\
  \ He has contributed cover art and internal illustrations for comics, novels, and\
  \ historical reference books. His work has graced the covers of the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em> and numerous volumes of Pathfinder Adventure Path, as well\
  \ as the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> and every Pathfinder hardcover Paizo\
  \ has produced since. Wayne continues to work with Paizo's designers to reveal never-before-seen\
  \ corners of Golarion, while his own in-depth knowledge of historic weapons, armor,\
  \ and fighting styles brings the most exciting elements of the Pathfinder RPG to\
  \ life.</p> \n    <p>And returning for PaizoCon are our special guests from the\
  \ Glass Cannon! Last year's smash-hit Guests of Honor included the Glass Canon Network\
  \ crew and they'll be back again as Special Guests for 2019. They'll be hosting\
  \ several live play games and other podcasting events throughout the four days so\
  \ be sure to save some time in your gaming schedule to check them out.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>In addition to our Guests of Honor and Special Guests, PaizoCon gives fans,\
  \ friends, and freelancers an opportunity to meet, game, and network with the entire\
  \ Paizo staff as well as other RPG industry folks. With the exception of the Preview\
  \ Banquet held on Saturday evening, the Grand Ballroom will be filled with Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder Society games and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game events run by\
  \ the Organized Play Foundation (OPF). We'll have numerous games run by Paizo staff,\
  \ RPG industry luminaries (including games run by the authors that wrote them),\
  \ and by members of our amazing community. We also host seminars and workshops that\
  \ range from deep dives into specific books we've published to world building, alien\
  \ creation, and other topics for game developers, fiction writers, and RPG and sci-fi/fantasy\
  \ fans alike.</p> \n    <p>On a personal note, I've been attending PaizoCon since\
  \ 2009 and every year I look forward to the enthusiasm and excitement the community\
  \ brings. I love seeing familiar faces, meeting new friends, and getting to see\
  \ the people behind the forum avatars. After 12 years of PaizoCon and 11 years of\
  \ running the show, Paizo is still finding lots of opportunity to improve the convention\
  \ and the attendee experience. I'm happy to report, based on feedback from the community,\
  \ in addition to the regular 8:00 AM-1:00 PM games the OPF will be running at least\
  \ 10 tables of Society games during the 1:00 PM-6:00 PM time slots on Friday, Saturday\
  \ (1:00 PM-5:00 PM), and Sunday afternoons. I will also be working with the OPF\
  \ to leave a number of seats at Society games open folks who are unable to pre-register\
  \ for events. I'm confident that these and other scheduling improvements will make\
  \ 2019 one of our best PaizoCons so far!</p> \n    <p>I look forward to see you\
  \ in May!</p> \n    <p>Sara Marie<br> <i>Customer Service &amp; Community Manager</i></p>\
