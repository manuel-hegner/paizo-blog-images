  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 11, 2011</p> \n   <p>Welcome to the first\
  \ Design Tuesday blog, a series of blogs that explore the rules of the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game. Over the next few weeks, we're going to be exploring intelligent\
  \ magic items and how to use them in your game. </p> \n   <p><b>Intelligent Magic\
  \ Items: Part 1</b></p> <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n\"><img src=\"\

  \ hspace=\"9\"></a> \n   <p>Adding magic items to your game is already a time-consuming\
  \ process. As a GM, you must evaluate the party's needs, look at their wealth levels,\
  \ and assign appropriate and fun items to the hoards they might discover. Adding\
  \ an intelligent magic item to the mix is often seen as one step too many, combining\
  \ the treasure distribution rules with many of the aspects of NPC creation. There\
  \ are, however, a number of reasons to put an intelligent magic item into your game,\
  \ making them more than worth the extra effort.</p> \n   <p>Intelligent magic items\
  \ are a useful way for the GM to directly participate in the narrative of the campaign\
  \ whenever it's convenient. The magic item is always with the group, but unlike\
  \ an ordinary NPC, no one expects an intelligent magic item to participate in every\
  \ conversation or combat. An actual NPC that fades in and out of the scene can be\
  \ jarring to some and, when forgotten, can lead to awkward situations where the\
  \ only solution is to revise history. An intelligent magic item, however, can easily\
  \ speak up when it has something vital to add, and can just as easily be silent\
  \ without breaking any sense of verisimilitude. Intelligent items are a perfect\
  \ means for adding twists and turns to an adventure, while allowing the PCs to feel\
  \ like they are in control.</p> \n   <p>Before adding an intelligent magic item\
  \ into your game, you should first design an adventure or plotline around the object.\
  \ To get the most out of an intelligent item, it should be featured heavily in at\
  \ least one adventure or arc in the campaign. This makes the item special and lets\
  \ it stand out. Giving the item this much spotlight will also greatly help develop\
  \ its personality and background. This adventure does not have to take place the\
  \ moment the item is acquired, but it should be known during the process of creating\
  \ the item, as it will drive many of your design decisions. Treat the item like\
  \ an NPC. It has motivations and some sort of goal or desire. At the very least,\
  \ it has a history to draw upon. Here are a few example adventure seeds that involve\
  \ some sort of intelligent item:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>The magic item was\
  \ once the property of a renowned adventurer who died in a deadly dungeon. The item\
  \ remembers much of the layout of that dungeon and might be able to aid its new\
  \ owner in navigating the deathtrap.</p> \n    <p>The magic item was used to store\
  \ the soul of a powerful spellcaster who desperately wants to be restored to life.\
  \ The item knows the one way that this can be accomplished—by taking the item to\
  \ a unique mountaintop shrine.</p> \n    <p>The item was once the property of an\
  \ angelic being, but fell into the hands of an evil creature that never knew its\
  \ true power. Now recovered, the item wishes to complete the quest of its slain\
  \ master. Unknown to the item, its original master still lives and is seeking the\
  \ item.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>These are just some of the possible stories\
  \ that involve an intelligent item. Once you've got the background and goal of the\
  \ magic item worked out, it's time to design the item and introduce it to the group.\
  \ We'll cover some design tips and tricks in part 2 of this series, so for now,\
  \ let's look at how to introduce the item to the group. There are many ways that\
  \ an intelligent item might find its way into the hands of a PC, the simplest being\
  \ inclusion in a treasure hoard or as part of a villain's gear. There are also less\
  \ conventional means that you might want to consider:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n \
  \   <p>The item belongs to a merchant who is tired of its constant bickering and\
  \ talking and is desperate to be rid of the item. He practically gives it away to\
  \ the first PC who seems remotely interested in it.</p> \n    <p>The item's previous\
  \ owner thought it was haunted and threw it away—down a well, into a fireplace,\
  \ etc. The PCs stumble upon it and save it from destruction or neglect.</p> \n \
  \   <p>The PCs encounter the item's current owner, who the item finds totally unsuitable\
  \ to its purpose. In an obvious battle of wills, the item forces its current owner\
  \ to hand the item over to the most suitable PC.</p> \n   </blockquote> <a href=\"\
  /gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n\"><img src=\"/image/content/CarrionCrown/PZO3017-BatSword_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n   <p>Once the PCs have the item,\
  \ it's time for it to introduce itself. This should not happen right away. Intelligent\
  \ items have a tendency to make themselves known only once their owner has proven\
  \ to be worthwhile (or so terribly unsuitable to the item that it cannot stand the\
  \ misuse any longer). This should be a memorable encounter, where the item suddenly\
  \ speaks out or uses an ability unknown to its new owner. After the first encounter,\
  \ the PCs will undoubtedly have a lot of questions for the item. Make sure to be\
  \ careful with what the PCs know at first. The item cannot usually leave if its\
  \ owner decides to mistreat it, and as a result, most intelligent magic items guard\
  \ their secrets carefully and only reveal all to an owner that they trust implicitly.\
  \ Remember the item's true goals or purpose throughout this process. While the PCs\
  \ should not learn this right away, they might get a clue from these first conversations.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>From this point onward, the item can act as an occasional source of information,\
  \ throwing out bits and pieces of knowledge as needed by the GM, so long as they\
  \ can be made to fit in the object's story. The item can be used as a foil for a\
  \ PC who thinks too much of himself, or to bolster a lowly character's confidence.\
  \ An intelligent magic item is a valuable tool, one that every GM should consider\
  \ adding to the campaign.</p> \n   <p>That's all for this week. Next week we'll\
  \ look at the mechanics behind designing an intelligent magic item, and even give\
  \ you some new rules to work with.</p> \n   <p style=\"clear:both;\">Jason Bulmahn\
