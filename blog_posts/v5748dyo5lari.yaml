  >Wednesday, January 27, 2010</p> \n   <p>As many of you know, having followed this\
  \ internship period with great fervor (I have been assaulted by paparazzi no less\
  \ than seven times), I will soon be vanishing from this land.</p> \n   <p>There\
  \ are some benefits to my departure. Once more I will be addressed by other people\
  \ as \"Matt\" and not \"starving intern,\" which is less of a title really and more\
  \ of the beginnings to a declarative statement (read: \"Starving interns, bookmark\
  \ this PDF!\").</p> \n   <p>Some of my best memories were those times when I could\
  \ ride someone's coattails into the building, having been given no keys of my own.\
  \ This I savored in lieu of the alternative: braving the main entrance thorough\
  \ the customer service lair, wherein waits Cosmo, destroyer of worlds. Though I\
  \ was threatened only once by way of nerf gun, I was also accosted in the name of\
  \ a ham sandwich, which I have yet to procure. It would be incorrect for me to suggest\
  \ that I tremble at every sound I hear, but at times I do flinch and shrink away\
  \ from what I fear may be the inevitability of Cosmo's ham-sandwichless wrath.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I remember relearning a lot of gaming. It's a well-kept secret (among\
  \ staff here, even) that I landed this internship without much gaming experience\
  \ at all. So little, in fact, that I had only three d20 Modern sessions under my\
  \ belt and one 3.5 session. By that token, I'm completely thrilled to have been\
  \ given this opportunity, as well as to have played in Crystal's campaign (mentioned\
  \ by Tyler <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5laov\">here</a>).</p> \n   <p>I remember\
  \ the sparse but consistently entertaining vignettes of the life experiences of\
  \ Sean K Reynolds. I remember data entry, copy edits, development meetings, manuscript\
  \ styling, playtests, teaching myself Photoshop on a whim, arranging battles between\
  \ weresabretooth tigers and the lava dragon on my desk, drinking lots of tea, bookmarking\
  \ PDFs, and repairing Planet Stories manuscripts. I remember teaching Wes the intern's\
  \ point of view on free food: \"Do not question free food, for it is both free,\
  \ and food.\" I remember my first editorial pass on <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/v5748btpy8arc\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #36: <i>Voice in the Void</i></a>. I remember how its\
  \ writer soon came to work for us. I remember the occasional free meal, sometimes\
  \ paid for by you, the wonderful fans.</p> \n   <p>In fact, I remember everything\
  \ fondly with the exception of Highway 520, that notoriously temperamental highway\
  \ and bridge that separates the Paizo offices from \"mainland\" Seattle. To the\
  \ hour of traffic I sat in each night after departing, I bid you <i>adieu</i>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>To all my fellow Pathfinder fans, I'll likely see you on the messageboards,\
  \ and to the rest of the staff... I'll see you at PaizoCon '10. Wish me luck in\
  \ my senior year of college, and more than that, luck in finding a job afterwards!<br></p>\
