  \      <p itemprop=\"description\">Elemental Stones is an abstract tile-placement\
  \ and pattern-matching game for 2 to 4 players, in which you take on the role of\
  \ powerful elemental sovereigns by placing and transforming tiles of five elements\
  \ (fire, water, earth, wood, and metal)—with air as a sixth, wildcard element—in\
  \ a constant struggle for dominance. Today we want to give you a peek into how the\
  \ game came to be and what you can expect find inside the box.</p>\n      <p>Designed\
  \ by me (Joe Pasini) along with Jason Bulmahn, <em>Elemental Stones</em> is the\
  \ first release in the Paizo Games line, which will consist of tabletop games designed,\
  \ developed, and published by Paizo. We’re excited to bring you all-new game expressions\
  \ that, while inspired by and connected to the rich worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder,\
  \ explore the opportunities presented by modern games, separate from pen-and-paper\
  \ roleplaying games.</p>\n      <p>Elemental Stones began life as an inkling of\
  \ a game inspired by the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju\">Rage of\
  \ Elements</a> hardcover book, which dives deep into the system of elements in Pathfinder\
  \ (including two newly supported elements, metal and wood). We knew we wanted a\
  \ simple-to-learn, highly replayable game that would involve the elemental cycle,\
  \ placing satisfying objects on a board, and competing for elemental dominance,\
  \ in the form of—what else—victory points. Early prototypes of a dotted grid with\
  \ constellation-like patterns grew into a more robust hex-shaped grid and tokens\
  \ with a relatively simple ruleset. With just a few tweaks along the way, this design\
  \ allows for nuanced strategy and tactics each time you play.</p>\n      <p>Of course,\
  \ as with any idea making its way from concept to concrete creation, there were\
  \ some growing pains. Various card types were added, patterns shifted and changed,\
  \ scoring metrics were constantly in flux, and the component list was rather fluid\
  \ throughout early playtests. For example, we realized players would end up with\
  \ extra stones at the end of most games and, as a result, would have less meaningful\
  \ choices when choosing stones in later rounds. We eventually hit upon the idea\
  \ of awarding points for having majorities in each type of stone as a way to solve\
  \ two problems with one solution (if only there were a stone-related idiom for that…\
  \ oh well). Everything about the game went through similar iterations, from the\
  \ several other ways you can score points all the way to the production side, where\
  \ we worked diligently with our manufacturer to create tiles that are just the right\
  \ weight, size, and feel. In the end, we created a game that is quick and easy to\
  \ play with up to four players in about 30-40 minutes, making it a perfect warm-up\
  \ to your Pathfinder game night—or you can play multiple rounds for a whole evening\
  \ of fun.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"\
