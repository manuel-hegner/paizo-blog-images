  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Why, that was just the annual PaizoCon Puzzle Hunt coming\
  \ back strong! We debuted this event last year, and it went over so well, we were\
  \ able to increase its exposure and present an even more exciting and involved set\
  \ of puzzles. But we know not everyone can make it to the convention, so we are\
  \ proud to present the entire thing here for you! Check the link below, which contains\
  \ everything you need to participate in this year's puzzle hunt... except, of course,\
  \ your wits. Unfortunately, we can't offer any prizes for completing this puzzle\
  \ hunt (or for discovering the secret secondary puzzle that hides within), but rest\
  \ assured we will be back in 2019 with another set, as well as some new partners\
  \ in this endeavor!</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\"\

  \ Hunt!</a> â€” <span class=\"tiny\">3.1 MB zip/PDF</span></p> \n    <h2>What is a\
  \ puzzle hunt?</h2> \n    <p>A puzzle hunt is a series of linked puzzles, with the\
  \ answer to each being a word or phrase. Those words and phrases are used in the\
  \ puzzle on the first page of the PDF to generate the hunt's final solution. Figuring\
  \ out how that puzzle works is part of the challenge!</p> \n    <h2>Who made this,\
  \ anyway?</h2> \n    <p>Once again, that's us! We challenged ourselves from last\
  \ year to add more visual elements to these new puzzles, creating what we hope are\
  \ a diverse array of interesting mind-bending enigmas. But we couldn't have done\
  \ it without the aid of Art Director Sonja Morris, who created all of the puzzle\
  \ hunt's outstanding graphics!</p> \n    <h2>What do I do if get stuck?</h2> \n\
  \    <p>First, put the puzzle down and come back at it in an hour or so with a fresh\
  \ mind. Perhaps you'll spot something you hadn't seen before. Be sure to reread\
  \ the instructions at the top of the page; sometimes clues are hidden in there!\
  \ If all that fails, feel free to ask for a hint on the Paizo.com forums. There's\
  \ no shame in getting a nudge from a fellow solver, and perhaps you can help her\
  \ in return with a different puzzle!</p> \n    <p>Jason Keeley and Joe Pasini<br>\
