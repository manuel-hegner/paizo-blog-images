  \ the Wave</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 23, 2008</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ that time again—time for me to point out that nothing new I can say about <a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy81tw\"><i>The Hounds of Skaith</i></a> can recommend it\
  \ any better than it recommends itself and jump straight to an excerpt from the\
  \ novel. In <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\"><i>The Ginger Star</i></a>,\
  \ everyone's favorite mercenary and wild man Eric John Stark ventured to the dying\
  \ world of Skaith in search of his foster father, only to find himself the subject\
  \ of a revolutionary prophecy. Now, reunited with his mentor and with the support\
  \ of the rebels' beautiful prophetess, Stark must master a pack of vicious telepathic\
  \ hounds and tear down the planet's corrupt government before they close the starport\
  \ and leave him stranded forever in a galactic backwater. The following scene is\
  \ his first encounter with the race of desert-running cannibals that locals call\
  \ the Runners...</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The hound had stopped in his trotting.\
  \ He stood braced on forelegs like tree trunks, high shoulders hunched against the\
  \ wind, coarse fur ruffling. His head, which seemed too heavy for even that powerful\
  \ neck to support without weariness, swung slowly back and forth. The dark muzzle\
  \ snarled.</p> \n     <p>The pack gathered behind him. They were excited, making\
  \ noises in their throats. Their eyes glowed, too bright, too knowing—the harbingers\
  \ of death.</p> \n     <p><i>There</i>, said Gerd.</p> \n     <p>Stark saw them,\
  \ strung along a rib of sand in the grainy light. A second before nothing had stood\
  \ there. Now, in the flicker of an eyelid, there were eleven...no, fourteen bent,\
  \ elongated shapes, barely recognizable as human. Skin like old leather, thick and\
  \ tough, covered their staring bones, impervious to wind and cold. Long hair and\
  \ scanty scraps of hide flapped wildly. A family group, Stark thought—males, females,\
  \ young. One of the females clutched something between pendulous breasts. Other\
  \ adults carried stones or thighbones.</p> \n     <p>\"Runners,\" Ashton said and\
  \ pulled out his sword. \"They're like piranha fish. Once they get their teeth in—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>The old male screamed, one high wild cry. The ragged figures stooped\
  \ forward, lifted on their long legs and rushed out across the shadowed sand. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>They moved with incredible speed. Their bodies were drawn and thinned\
  \ for running, thrusting heads carried level with the ground and never losing sight\
  \ of the prey. The upper torso was all ribcage, deep and narrow, with negligible\
  \ shoulders, the arms carried like flightless wings outstretched for balance. The\
  \ incredible legs lifted, stretched, spurned, lifted, with a grotesque perfection\
  \ of motion that caught the throat with its loveliness even as it terrified with\
  \ its ferocity.</p> \n     <p>Gerd said, <i>N'Chaka. Kill?</i></p> \n     <p><i>Kill!</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The hounds sent fear.</p> \n     <p>That was how they killed. Not with\
  \ fang or claw. With fear. Cold cruel deadly mind-bolts of it that struck like arrows\
  \ to the brain, drained the gut, chilled the blood-warm heart until it ceased beating...</p>\
