  \ </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <h1>Return to Atlantis</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\
  >Monday, September 10, 2007</p> \n   <p>Ray Bradbury once referred to Henry Kuttner\
  \ as \"a neglected master... a man who shaped science fiction and fantasy in its\
  \ most important years.\" Kuttner sold his first story, \"The Graveyard Rats,\"\
  \ to Weird Tales in 1936, the same year in which he wrote a fan letter to rising\
  \ science fiction author C. L. Moore, mistakenly believing her to be a man. The\
  \ two were married in 1940, and in the years that followed they collaborated constantly,\
  \ publishing under at least 17 pseudonyms, most notably Lewis Padgett and Keith\
  \ Hammond. As Joe R. Lansdale relates in the introduction to our forthcoming Kuttner\
  \ compilation, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8e\"><i>Elak of Atlantis</i></a>, the\
  \ story goes that the two worked so closely together on most of their projects that\
  \ when one got up from the typewriter to go to the bathroom, the other would slide\
  \ into their place and seamlessly take up where they left off. Yet before the collaborations,\
  \ before many of the Cthulhu mythos stories born of Kuttner's relationship with\
  \ H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, before the television scripts and film\
  \ adaptations like The Last Mimsy, there was Elak. </p> \n   <p>Elak of Atlantis\
  \ was one of the first heroes of the sword and sorcery genre, and remains one of\
  \ the most important. Whereas Howard's Conan waded brutishly into the public eye\
  \ with little more than a sword and an attitude, Elak was something different entirely.\
  \ Cultured—though still a thief, adulterer, and cold-blooded killer—this droll fencer\
  \ with the flashing rapier and secret past made way for a whole new breed of protagonist,\
  \ falling somewhere between the Grey Mouser and Errol Flynn. With his perpetually\
  \ drunk, Sancho-Panza-esque companion by his side, Elak battled his way across the\
  \ fantastic frontiers of ancient Atlantis, slaying gods, wizards, dwarves, and foul\
  \ horrors from Dagon's darkened depths, thrilling the eager readers of Weird Tales\
  \ and earning himself a permanent place in the fantasy pantheon.</p> \n   <p>In\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8e\"><i>Elak of Atlantis</i></a>, the new <a href=\"\
  /planetStories\">Planet Stories</a> book that's shipping to the printer as I write\
  \ this, we've collected all of the Elak of Atlantis stories, many of which are exceedingly\
  \ difficult to locate, as well as two even rarer stories featuring Prince Raynor,\
  \ Kuttner's slightly-better-behaved scion of Imperial Gobi, the empire which fell\
  \ long before Mesopotamia gave birth to modern civilization. </p> \n   <p>Kuttner\
  \ has been cited as an influence by everyone from Marion Zimmer Bradley to Roger\
  \ Zelazny, and both Richard Matheson and Ray Bradbury have dedicated novels to him.\
  \ By bringing back these stories, it's our hope to introduce a whole new generation\
  \ to one of the most influential writers of the genre. </p> \n   <p>Enjoy.</p> \n\
