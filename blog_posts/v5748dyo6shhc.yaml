  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Adventurers don’\
  t spend every waking moment in moldering crypts or dangerous fens. When heroes need\
  \ a break, they can take some downtime in a friendly town like Otari! The <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults\"\
  >Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a> provides new downtime options for characters\
  \ who have befriended some of the town’s notable characters. Here are some downtime\
  \ activities the heroes can take at Otari’s largest temple, the Dawnflower Library.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Dawnflower Library is constructed on a shelf of land west of town\
  \ so that its dome and minarets gleam in the rays of the rising sun. Although principally\
  \ a temple to the sun goddess Sarenrae, the building also holds shrines to Cayden\
  \ Cailean (drunken god of heroes), Erastil (god of hunting and community), and Gozreh\
  \ (deity of the wind and sea). Yet most of the building’s interior is dedicated\
  \ to the stacks; the Dawnflower Library holds an incredible number of books, and\
  \ its knowledge is open to all. </p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b6d1a391-fd45-4543-9a74-1a944f579228/111820_VANDY-BANDERDASH.png\"\

  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Vandy Banderdash by Nikolai Ostertag</p> \n\
  \     <p>A chatty halfling woman named Vandy Banderdash is the temple’s current\
  \ high priestess. She is welcoming and kindly, with an uncanny ability to recommend\
  \ the best possible book to someone she’s only just met. Anyone who befriends Vandy\
  \ can engage in the following downtime activities in the Dawnflower Library.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Exemplary Resources</b>: The reference materials in the Dawnflower\
  \ Library are superb. Heroes can use a scholarly-focused lore skill such as Academia\
  \ Lore, Legal Lore, or Library Lore to Earn Income (<em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook\
  \ 236</em>) with a +1 circumstance bonus to the skill check. The first time a hero\
  \ critically fails at such a check, Vandy gives them a stern lecture about taking\
  \ better care of the library’s resources. The hero isn’t prohibited from Earning\
  \ Income here again, but doesn’t gain the circumstance bonus any longer, as the\
  \ acolytes are more judicious about which texts the hero is permitted to access.</p>\
  \ \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p><b>Reshelving</b>: Vandy wants the Dawnflower\
  \ Library’s collection to be as useful to the community as possible, so she’s always\
  \ looking at ways to rearrange or cross-reference the library books. A hero who\
  \ takes a day of downtime to help rearrange the collection gains a 10% reduction\
  \ in the price of the next spellcasting service purchased from Vandy or her acolytes\
  \ (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 294; 3rd level or lower divine spells).</p> \n     <p><b>Tend\
  \ to the Injured</b>: The Dawnflower Library is the first place many in Otari think\
  \ of when they need medical care, due to the number of clerics working there. Yet\
  \ not all injuries require divine magic to repair. The hero can use the Medicine\
  \ skill to Earn Income at the Dawnflower Library. On a critical failure, the hero\
  \ injures someone placed in their care, which might have roleplaying repercussions\
  \ at the GM’s option.</p> \n     <p>For more adventures in Otari, be sure to pick\
  \ up your copy of the Pathfinder Beginner Box, the follow-up adventure, Troubles\
  \ in Otari, and the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. You can also get a new chapter\
  \ of The Shroud of Four Silences novella by Liane Merciel, set in Otari, emailed\
  \ to you each week by signing up for our mailing list in your paizo.com account\
  \ preferences!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Ron\
