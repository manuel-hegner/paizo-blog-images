  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, ‘\
  Finders!<br>\n        March is Women’s History Month here in the United States,\
  \ and to celebrate and recognize the women who make our games happen, we’ve welcomed\
  \ Paizo contributors who identify as women (inclusive of trans, cis, and nonbinary\
  \ identities) to share their experiences, wisdom, and projects on the blog!</p>\n\
  \      <p>This year’s theme for Women’s History Month is “Moving Forward Together—\
  Women Educating and Inspiring Generations.” Some of our contributors have used this\
  \ theme to shape their submissions.</p>\n      <center>\n       <br>\n       <hr\
  \ width=\"75%\">\n       <br>\n      </center>\n      <h3>Ivis Flanagan (she/they)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Have you ever looked up to someone and said, “I could NEVER do that?”\
  \ I know I have.<br><br>\n       I spent years having the boys I hung out with beat\
  \ into my head that “girls just can’t play RPGs” by repeatedly ensuring my characters\
  \ died every time I joined them. Then, years later, one of my closest friends, Sean\
  \ Duncan, pulled me out of a nap and into my first Pathfinder game. I fell in love\
  \ with it, from the mechanics to the setting—all of it. Then some friends encouraged\
  \ me to go to my first convention, where I meant Heather Vigil, the first female\
  \ GM I’d ever seen, and I thought, “Wow, I could never do that.” She and I became\
  \ fast friends, and she was the one who eventually convinced me I was good enough\
  \ to GM—which I again fell in love with, soon after becoming a Venture Agent in\
  \ Organized Play.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>This attitude of “I could never do that” continued\
  \ to precede me as I volunteered for conventions, then started taking on more and\
  \ more leadership roles in Organized Play until I became the first female RVC (there's\
  \ been two more since!). It was through this work that I met some amazing femme\
  \ people: Hillary Moon Murphy, Kate Baker, Isis Woz, Katrina Hennessy, and Jessica\
  \ Redekop, to name just a few. They encouraged me to reach out and start sharing\
  \ my writing, which allowed me to get my foot in the door and contribute to the\
  \ works of multiple companies, including Paizo.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>Fast forward\
  \ to last year, when Paizo posted a designer position with the Rules and Lore team.\
  \ Again, my brain flipped back to the old belief that “I could never do that,” a\
  \ thought put there all those years ago by that group of gatekeeping guys. However,\
  \ with encouragement from the same friends who had supported me along the way, and\
  \ with the support of a few new ones like Alex Speidel and Shay Snow, I decided\
  \ to throw the proverbial snowball into hell and see where it went. Asmodeus likes\
  \ snow cones, it seems, because against all the odds in my brain, here I am, the\
  \ newest member of the Rules and Lore team, loving what I do every day.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p>I tell you my journey to say this: gaming is for everyone, and in supporting\
  \ each other, we will see this space and our representation in it continue to flourish.\
  \ More than anything, I’ve learned that to properly break down barriers to inclusivity,\
  \ we can’t just say we support one another—we have to show it. And you know what?\
  \ It’s true: girls don’t just play games—we run them, we organize them, and we create\
  \ them, too. If you ever want to reach out, either for encouragement or because\
  \ you’d like help finding ways to get involved, my DMs are open. You can find me\
  \ on Bluesky, Discord, and the Paizo Forums as NorthernDreamer.&nbsp;</p>\n    \
  \  <br>\n      <h3>Katrina Hennessy (she/they)</h3>\n      <p>I’d like to take a\
  \ moment or two to highlight some women who have influenced me and helped me to\
  \ be where I am today.</p>\n      <p>The less open-minded mother of one of my high\
  \ school friends said to her one day, “I know there is a science fiction convention\
  \ in town, but you’re not going!” This drove my wonderful, open-minded, and supportive\
  \ mother to organize a small group of us to attend Swancon 2, the second annual\
  \ science fiction convention in Western Australia. There, we were introduced to\
  \ the relatively new game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and met Uma, who was welcoming\
  \ and supportive of us teens and a gracious example of how to exist in this male-dominated\
  \ industry.</p>\n      <p>While there were other women along the way, as I played\
  \ various RPGs through the decades, they were not frequent. In 2017, when I was\
  \ introduced to Paizo Organized Play, this changed. Dorothy was one of my first\
  \ GMs and a role model on how to be a firm and fair Game Master while remaining\
  \ welcoming newcomers and making sure they received appropriate guidance. I also\
  \ met Hilary, an exuberant and fun GM who was active at spreading Play-by-Post and\
  \ good at turning insufficient reluctance into an active Venture Officer. There\
  \ was also Kate, who was not only a great GM but an active freelancer who encouraged\
  \ others along that path.</p>\n      <p>Over the course of these years, I also came\
  \ across Vanessa, whom I first met as a roommate at Origins and who has helped me\
  \ in so many ways to break my own barriers and grow as a community member and as\
  \ a freelancer. She set an example of hard work and integrity in the games industry\
  \ as freelancer, Paizo Developer, and now with Wizards of the Coast. I would also\
  \ like to mention Ivis and Nicole, who actively participated in so much and took\
  \ on more and more while remaining friendly, supportive, and welcoming. Though life\
  \ seems to have moved Nicole elsewhere, I observed as Ivis continued to blossom\
  \ and is now a Paizo developer.</p>\n      <p>I thank each of them and the many\
  \ others who have had a positive impact on me along the way. I strive to also be\
  \ welcoming and supportive of all who wish to play, GM, write, or otherwise be involved\
  \ in our wonderful gaming community.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they/he)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Sara Jeffers is a Two-Spirit member of the Confederated Tribes of the\
  \ Colville Reservation, in what is now known as Washington and British Columbia.\
  \ Their heritage and culture influence not only her graphic and narrative designs\
  \ but also his approaches in problem-solving and community building. She is proud\
  \ to be a Woman in Gaming and to be helping&nbsp;the next generation of creatives\
  \ through Girl Scouts.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>When I found out about&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em><em>Lost Omens Rival Academies</em>,\
  \ I jumped at the chance to be Edit Co-Lead. Working on the book was a way of going\
  \ back to my professional roots. For over a decade, I worked in higher education\
  \ as an interfaith, service learning, and diversity and inclusion educator—a role\
  \ that included developing and implementing training programs for students (and\
  \ sometimes staff) as well as directly supporting students of marginalized identities.\
  \ Though I enjoyed being in the classroom, what I loved most was working with students\
  \ one-on-one. When I was in college, I had a mentor whose support changed my life;\
  \ once I was in the position to do the same for my students, it became the driving\
  \ force of my career.</p>\n      <p>I left university life years ago, but the relationships\
  \ remain. I’ve kept every letter and card I received at graduation or other milestones,\
  \ and I’m still close to several of my former students. Few things bring me such\
  \ joy as seeing them thrive out in the world as the leaders and changemakers I knew\
  \ they could be.</p>\n      <center>\n       <br>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n \
  \      <br>\n      </center>\n      <p>This month and every month, Paizo appreciates\
  \ all the women who have built our industry and continue to expand on our worlds!\
  \ Thank you for being a part of Paizo and for bringing new faces to the table for\
  \ years to come.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
