  >How do you follow up giving the players the chance to play as a succubus? Send\
  \ them to the Abyss, of course! <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu8\"><em>The Midnight\
  \ Isles Adventure Deck</em></a> does just that.</p> \n    <p>This is one of my favorite\
  \ adventures. The characters are on a mission from the queen to find the source\
  \ of Nahyndrian crystals and stop them from being refined into elixirs that can\
  \ make demons mythic. To do so, they'll be exploring the Midnight Isles, a set of\
  \ islands forged by a demon queen's imagination from the bodies of demon lords she's\
  \ assassinated. Wow.</p> \n    <p>I've always loved exploring the options available\
  \ when characters journey to the other planes, and it was challenging to put all\
  \ of that in the card game.</p> \n    <p><em>The Midnight Isles</em> is the first\
  \ adventure deck where those rules are really put to the test. After the first scenario,\
  \ all locations are considered to have the Abyssal trait (whether they normally\
  \ would or not.) This can be a bit of a challenge for players who've spent a lot\
  \ of time acquiring cards that work well against outsiders, since demons lose the\
  \ Outsider trait here.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-MidnightIslesFront.jpg\"\

  \ <h2>Finding the Way</h2> \n    <p>Since this is the fourth adventure deck, the\
  \ players now have roles, so the danger increases to match their increase in power.\
  \ The first scenario of this adventure, The Abyss Gazes Also, has many intricate,\
  \ challenging parts to it. First, I love that the players have to face all of the\
  \ non-Abyssal locations before they can tackle the Abyssal ones. This severely limits\
  \ their options and makes them work together. Plus the monsters they defeat don't\
  \ go back to the box—they go into the Abyssal locations to be faced again!</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-AbyssGazesFront.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Stop gazing at me!</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>There's also a\
  \ nested Easter egg in this scenario. If a player moves to an occupied Abyssal location,\
  \ he'll have to face an extra henchman, Minagho. Though this is fairly easy for\
  \ the players to avoid, there's a bonus to fighting her. If you defeat her by no\
  \ more than 6, you get a chance to snag a free cohort: Yaniel! Even better, Yaniel\
  \ is her own Easter egg. She's the paladin that originally owned the sword named\
  \ Radiance, which the players may have acquired by now. If they still have it, they\
  \ can use Yaniel to transform it into Holy Radiance. It's a long and complicated\
  \ road to get that card, but it's worth it!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Chain gang!</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>This scenario also features\
  \ a tricky location: the Grinder. This is where the villain will try to retreat\
  \ if defeated, but the place also has an interesting feature you may remember from\
  \ the Abyssal Rift. It flips! One side is innocuous, but if you gain a boon, BANG,\
  \ it flips to the hard side and all banes get a +5 difficulty boost. This could\
  \ be especially troublesome if the villain happens to retreat there. I love how\
  \ all of these mechanics fit together!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Back to the grind!</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of the\
  \ villain, the Heart of the Fane is no slouch. Before the characters even fight\
  \ it, they must EACH face a Vulture Demon. If they all win, they can finally catch\
  \ a break... if they're willing to banish a Divine card they've earned (and take\
  \ a small jolt.) If not, they must try to defeat the villainous barrier with an\
  \ epic Arcane or Divine 20 check. If you fail, it will try to go to the Grinder,\
  \ where it will probably enjoy that 5-point bump in difficulty.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Not for the fane of heart!</i> \n    </div> \n    <h2>Midnight\
  \ Monsters (And Barriers)</h2> \n    <p>There's an extra element of risk for characters\
  \ facing many of the monsters in this adventure. Most monsters just deal a bit of\
  \ damage, which you can hopefully soak with some armor, but these guys play for\
  \ more serious stakes. For example, the Horned Demon requires you to make a Wisdom\
  \ 12 check or shuffle a random card from your hand into the location deck. You could\
  \ lose your best card before you even fight, and then you'll have to go looking\
  \ for it again!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-Horned\
  \ Demon.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-HornedDemon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Was that your favorite card?</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>The Umbral\
  \ Dragon has a clever little trick. It picks a random occupied location and everyone\
  \ there has to succeed at a check to avoid BURYING THEIR ROLE CARDS. The deeper\
  \ into this adventure path you go, the more crippling this could be. Oh, and if\
  \ you don't defeat it the first time, it comes back!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-UmbralDragon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-UmbralDragon_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Role away!</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>Of course this deck has its share\
  \ of temptations as well: four of them, to be precise. The Gift of Shamira is particularly\
  \ tricky. You can choose to add 1d20 to a check to defeat a monster AND you get\
  \ to draw 1d10+1 cards as well. That's all good, right? Oh, you rolled a 10 and\
  \ you don't have 11 cards in your deck? Oops! And even if it doesn't kill you outright,\
  \ it's going to make playing those cards you drew more difficult, since drawing\
  \ to replace them could kill you anyway.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-GiftOfShamira.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-GiftOfShamira_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Drawing cards is good, right?</i> \n    </div> \n    <h2>Isle of Boons!</h2>\
  \ \n    <p><em>The Midnight Isles</em> also offer a bounty of rewards for those\
  \ brave enough to explore them.</p> \n    <p>There are several Corrupted weapons\
  \ here just waiting for someone to redeem them (or in the case of a Fallen Arueshalae,\
  \ just use them!) The Stalker's Crossbow adds 1d8+4 to your Ranged combat check,\
  \ and if you fail it, you get to reroll and add another 1d8! It just costs you a\
  \ card off the top of your deck when you use it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-StalkerCrossbow.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-StalkerCrossbow_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Fail, fail, fail...</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>There are so many great\
  \ spells in this deck, like Cape of Wasps and Pillar of Life, but I have to single\
  \ out Terraform for special consideration because it messes with the fundamental\
  \ rules of the game. If someone has this card, characters no longer have to fear\
  \ a horrible price for closing a location. When they need it, this card just makes\
  \ them automatically succeed... without the checks or costs or having to defeat\
  \ demons with combat 40 checks.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ location, location!</i> \n    </div> \n    <h2>Isle of Blessings!</h2> \n    <p>There's\
  \ one more little tricky bit to this deck (as if all the others weren't enough).\
  \ Like many other decks, it introduces a new blessing: the Blessing of Nocticula.\
  \ However, these don't just get shuffled into the box to pop up at random locations.\
  \ Players have to EARN them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-BlessingOfNocticula.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Powerful, but fragile.</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>In scenario\
  \ 3, Nocticula's Attention, the villain is not a hulking monster, but instead a\
  \ sort of bureaucrat named Vellexia. She stands between the players and the demon\
  \ queen herself. Players must use their Charisma and Diplomacy to \"defeat\" her.\
  \ If they fail, it's 1d20 damage straight to the brain. If they succeed, they may\
  \ display a Blessing of Nocticula next to the scenario, and she scampers back to\
  \ the location she came from. The players repeat this until they have amassed as\
  \ many blessings as there are players, at which point, they win and collect all\
  \ the ones they've displayed.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
