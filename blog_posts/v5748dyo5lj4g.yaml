  description\">Once Gen Con ended in August, Linda and I had a chance to breathe\
  \ after pushing ourselves to create an immense number of adventures for the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. By breathe, of course,\
  \ I mean we kept busy with sanctioning a big pile of modules and Adventure Paths\
  \ (many of which we're queuing for a big release next month); outline and assign\
  \ a big chunk of Season 8's adventures; and perform some long-range planning that\
  \ takes us through 2017 and beyond. When it came time to start developing September's\
  \ adventures, it had been so long since we'd done any scenario development that\
  \ the process seemed strangely alien.</p> \n     <p>Thankfully, that coincides nicely\
  \ with these adventures, both of which deal with very alien people, places, and\
  \ things.</p> \n     <p>For the first of these adventures, Isabelle Lee takes us\
  \ back to Numeria for the first time since Season 6 with <a href=\"/products/btpy9oih\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-04: Wardens of Sulfur Gulch</em></a>. Pathfinders\
  \ recently uncovered hitherto unknown surveys of the Numerian landscape by the famous\
  \ Gojan the Sharp, and Venture-Captain Holgarin Smine believes one of these sites\
  \ in particular merits exploration. To reach the ruins, the PCs must first impress\
  \ the Kellid tribe (including one of its mystics, pictured here) that claims the\
  \ region as its ownâ€”and that's even before the Pathfinders can uncover the dangerous\
  \ legacy that lies within Sulfur Gulch! Whether you love technological adventures\
  \ or seek the camaraderie of robot-hating peers, this Tier 7-11 adventure has something\
  \ for everyone.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb90\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0805E-Faiza.jpg\"\

  \      <br> <i>Illustration by Marko Horvatin</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>When we\
  \ first announced <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liu5\">Season 8: Year of the Stolen\
  \ Storm</a>, we mentioned this year would enjoy a considerable connection to the\
  \ elemental planes. Now that we've kicked off the season properly, we're taking\
  \ our first jaunt to the Plane of Earth with Jenny Jarzabski as the pilot in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9oii\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-05: Ungrounded\
  \ But Unbroken</em></a>. The shaitan genies of the Opaline Vault aren't as easy\
  \ to impress with words as they are with actions, and the best way to demonstrate\
  \ the Society's worth is by working directly for one of the shaitans' finest: the\
  \ genie Faiza, pictured here. This Tier 1-5 adventure with Sovereign Court connections\
  \ allows even novice adventurers to play a big role on another plane, with challenges\
  \ that take them to strange urban sites and bizarre wilderness realms.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>As a closing note, as the Pathfinder Society team spins up the Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenario subscription, we're encountering some new, very necessary logistical\
  \ steps. We've already taken steps to ensure our production schedule accommodates\
  \ these going forward, but we're unable to compress our timeline further for the\
  \ September scenarios to account for those challenges. Regretfully, that means that\
  \ the September scenarios are delayed by one week (now debuting October 5, 2016).\
  \ We're sorry for the inconvenience, and future months' publications should be back\
  \ on schedule.</p> \n     <p style=\"clear: both;\">John Compton<br> <i>Pathfinder\
