  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Taking Another Look</h1> \n   <p\
  \ class=\"date\">Friday, December 16, 2011</p> \n   <p>The official release date\
  \ for <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6?Pathfinder-Battles-Heroes-Monsters\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a> is now only a few weeks away, and by this point I’ve revealed every\
  \ miniature in the set in one form or another. Later today our friends at WizKids\
  \ will be bringing over first-run outputs of the approved sculpts for the next set,\
  \ Rise of the Runelords, so my mind is already on the next amazing set. But those\
  \ previews will have to wait until next month, as I want to take one more pass through\
  \ Heroes &amp; Monsters to show off some of the final versions of minis you’ve only\
  \ previously seen as computer models or unpainted practical sculpts.</p> \n   <p>First\
  \ up we have the uncommon Dire Rat, one of the earliest miniatures we revealed for\
  \ the set. Your comments (and our own impressions) said that the computer-generated\
  \ 3D sculpt of the rat looked too “clean,” so I asked WizKids to add a layer of\
  \ filth over the whole guy to really sell the idea that he just stepped out of a\
  \ sewer. I’d say they nailed it. Gross!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \   <a href=\"/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/20111216-DireRat_360.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/20111216-DireRat_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Speaking of early reveals, next up we have the rare Lich,\
  \ previously seen only as a computer sculpt. The final production-run miniature\
  \ shown below reveals nice metallic effects on the shoulder pads and chestplate,\
  \ while WizKids’ talented paint operations have added a cool speckled highlight\
  \ effect on what originally appeared to be a flat black cloak. This guy really looks\
  \ like a badass, and I love the way the detail at the hem of his cloak gives the\
  \ whole thing a sense of texture. I can’t wait to put this guy on the table and\
  \ see my players run for cover.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Secondary/WizKids/20111216-Lich_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/20111216-Lich_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Next up we have the common Lizardfolk Champion.\
  \ This is your first look at this guy in color, and honestly, I’m not sure our camera\
  \ is up to the challenge of showing off how good the Champion looks, especially\
  \ for a “common” figure. I count eight different colors, from his black toenails\
  \ to the touch of blue at the top of his crest. The Lizardfolk’s curved tail and\
  \ weapon pose give it a great sense of three-dimensionality. We call him a Champion,\
  \ but at the common rarity, he makes a great troop-builder figure for a Lizardfolk\
  \ squad. More Lizardfolk will certainly follow (with plenty of variety within the\
  \ types), but this guy gets us off to a good start.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Speaking of amazing commons, the Orc Warrior is one\
  \ of my absolute favorite figures in the set. Not only is he an amazing likeness\
  \ to the illustration in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, but he’s got more detail and a better paint job than\
  \ most prepainted orcs that preceded him (although I also really like the Orc Brute\
  \ from this set). There will DEFINITELY be more orcs in the future, and we’ll be\
  \ careful to match the skin tones, size, and general “look” to make sure all of\
  \ them work well together. </p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Secondary/WizKids/20111216-Orc_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/20111216-Orc_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Lastly we have the only iconic character\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6?Pathfinder-Battles-Heroes-Monsters\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a>, the rare paladin Seelah. Although the way this photo frames her\
  \ face makes her seem like a bit of a Popeye look, the mini looks really nice in\
  \ hand. The metallic silver and gold of her armor really pops, and I love the design\
  \ WizKids pulled off at the hem of her skirt. There will, of course, be more iconic\
  \ characters to come, with Rise of the Runelords getting two, bringing the total\
  \ (including the four in <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box-Heroes-Miniatures-Set\"\
  >Beginner Box Heroes</a>) to 7. Only 14 to go before we’ve covered them all!</p>\

  \ of new minis over later today, and I can’t wait to start planning preview blogs\
  \ for the next set! Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to know about\
  \ \n    <link>Heroes &amp; Monsters, and I’ll do my best to help out!</p> \n   <p>These\
  \ things are almost in your hands! I can’t wait to hear what you think of them once\
  \ you get to see them for yourselves!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
