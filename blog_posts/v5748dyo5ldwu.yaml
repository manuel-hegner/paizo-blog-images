  \ the spirit of going door-to-door looking for treats, we've decided to do something\
  \ a little unusual for the release of the new Pathfinder Tales novel Queen of Thorns.\
  \ Instead of offering a single sample chapter, we've spread the first four chapters\
  \ across four prominent fantasy and gaming websites, giving you a free sneak preview\
  \ of the first 70 pages of the book! Here to talk a little bit about the project\
  \ is the author himself, Dave Gross:</i></span> </p>\n    <blockquote> \n     <p>To\
  \ give people a taste of the Pathfinder Tales novel line, Paizo's fiction editor\
  \ solicits short prequels for the web fiction page. These stories allow us authors\
  \ to show a glimpse of what happens to our heroes between books. I appreciate the\
  \ opportunity to go darker or funnier or just a little different from the novels\
  \ while showcasing the same protagonists.</p> \n     <p>I love them.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Paizo also posts chapter excerpts from the novels, often from the middle of\
  \ the book, with glorious full-color artwork.</p> \n     <p>I <i>hate</i> them.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><img src=\"\

  \     <p>Well, I love that Paizo is showing off beautiful art and a sample chapter,\
  \ but why is it never Chapter One? That drives me crazy! I wrote the chapters in\
  \ order, damn it, and I think the first one is a pretty good introduction to the\
  \ story. Why can't that be the excerpt?</p> \n     <p>So I complain, as anyone who's\
  \ read my editor's blog knows all too well. And he responds with perfectly reasonable-sounding\
  \ explanations like, \"We wanted to show off some action, because we like your fight\
  \ scenes.\" (That's a dirty trick, the appeasa-flatter.) Or maybe he'll say, \"\
  We loved this character and wanted an excuse to commission a painting of her.\"\
  \ (I loved her too, so I'm thwarted.)</p> \n     <p>But, damn it! I still want everyone\
  \ to read Chapter One (and Two and Three) before Chapter Four. And so I keep complaining,\
  \ and my editor keeps posting lists of things authors should never say to editors,\
  \ and so it goes.</p> \n     <p>But something different happened this time. I don't\
  \ know, maybe my editor was just tired, or maybe the stars were right. I suspect\
  \ the enlistment of publicity impresario Jaym Gates might have been a factor. The\
  \ result is that you can follow the links from <a href=\"http://www.blackgate.com/black-gate-online-fiction-pathfinder-tales-queen-of-thorns-chapter-one-the-midsummer-masquerade/\"\

  \ \n     <p>If you like what you read, I hope you'll buy a copy of the book. And\
  \ if you like that, I hope you'll tell everyone you know to buy one, too.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In the meantime, let's thank our hosts at all the participating websites,\

  \ happen.</p> \n     <p>I promise not to complain for the rest of the week.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>About This Chapter</h3> \n     <p>After Prince of Wolves and Master\
  \ of Devils, in which the boys spend much of their time on separate journeys, for\
  \ Queen of Thorns I wanted a plot closer to a classical quest fantasy with a group\
  \ of heroes. You know, like a Fellowship or a Ring of Companions or something like\
  \ that. So in Chapter Four, Count Jeggare assembles a party that leaves Radovan\
  \ wishing he'd stayed in Rivendell. I mean, Iadara.</p> \n     <p>Jokes aside, Kyonin\
  \ is only superficially similar to Middle-earth. In addition to the fey creatures\
  \ infesting the woods and the horde of demons threatening from the south, the Fierani\
  \ Forest is full of half-forgotten archaeological sites, some concealing arcane\
  \ or cosmological mysteries. What could be more exciting to a Pathfinder like Count\
  \ Jeggare? Although, as things turn out, the expedition into the Fierani Forest\
  \ might reveal as many secrets of Radovan's infernal heritage as of Varian's long-absent\
  \ father.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: The Fierani Forest</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Somebody was making a hell of a racket, and not just in my nightmare.\
  \ I'd been having a lot of those lately. I shook off the terrors, sat up, and rubbed\
  \ sand out of my eyes.</p> \n    <p>Desna smiled. Nobody was getting murdered outside\
  \ of dreamland. Arnisant just had Fumblewhatsit backed up against the campfire.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Call off your animal! Great glens and gardens, he'll eat me in\
  \ one bite!\" The gnome wasn't tall enough to hold the skillet out of reach. He\
  \ protected it with his body, but the hound's big jaws shook his confidence.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Arni, get over here!\"</p> \n    <p>The dog bounded and sat beside\
  \ me, a long rope of drool running from his jaws.</p> \n    <p>The gnome scowled\
  \ at Arni and set the skillet back on the fire. Fat black sausages sizzled in the\
  \ pan.</p> \n    <p>\"You all right, Fim?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Fimbulthicket,\" he winced\
  \ as he pressed a hand to hip. \"And I'm fine, thanks for asking. Dodging a hungry\
  \ dog is nothing new, I'm sorry to say.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Where's the boss?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The gnome tilted his head in the direction of the brook. His baggy eyes\
  \ told me the boss had kept him up late, as he had our last couple of nights in\
  \ Omesta, quizzing him about his old man. It didn't help that we'd slept this last\
  \ night in the forest just outside the elf and gnome city. The boss said it was\
  \ supposed to get us prepared for the upcoming journey.</p> \n    <p>It was going\
  \ to take a lot more than one night's camping to toughen up the gnome, who winced\
  \ every time he moved. He probably hadn't spent a night out of a soft bed since\
  \ he'd last seen Variel. That was around the time the boss was born, and I still\
  \ had trouble thinking of him as working on a hundred years old.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ didn't mind sleeping on the ground so much as the fiends tearing through my dreams.\
  \ I couldn't blame it on last night's supper, which had been pretty plain fare after\
  \ all the rich elven goodies back in Iadara. No, I had a pretty good idea where\
  \ my nightmares came from. They didn't come from the things I'd eaten. They came\
  \ from the things I'd done.</p> \n    <p>As I pulled on my boots, the back of my\
  \ neck itched. I looked around, saw nothing. Listening, I heard the sizzling meat\
  \ on the fire, the water from the brook, and birdsong from the trees, but nothing\
  \ out of order. Still, it felt like somebody was watching me.</p> \n    <p>I shook\
  \ out my blanket and made a cloud of gray dog hair. No wonder I'd dreamed about\
  \ wrestling a demon-bear. Whenever I slept near the boss, Arni waited for him to\
  \ fall asleep before moving from the foot of his bunk to steal my covers, the big\
  \ mooch.</p> \n    <p>The starknife rested behind the pack. I'd carried it with\
  \ me ever since we'd left Ustalav. Even all the time I tramped through Tian Xia\
  \ in a devil's body, I kept it near. A few times I'd had to use it to kill, but\
  \ that's not why Azra gave it to me. Despite swearing to Bishop Senir that I'd never\
  \ go back to Ustalav, I wondered sometimes whether Azra was waiting for me to return\
  \ her knife and seal the offer she'd made me.</p> \n    <p>It was a stupid thing\
  \ to think about. I wrapped the starknife in my blanket and stuffed them both into\
  \ my pack.</p> \n    <p>I fetched my jacket off the tree where I'd hung it. It looked\
  \ no worse for the dunking I'd taken back in Iadara. Most of my scrapes and bruises\
  \ had healed, too. While the night I spent with Kemeili was fun, I was glad it was\
  \ behind me. There'd been a time I'd have felt different. Maybe the problem was\
  \ I'd spent a year stuck in a body nobody could love. Or maybe I'd had my fill of\
  \ rough stuff for one lifetime.</p> \n    <p>My spurs slid into their elbow slots\
  \ as I shrugged on the jacket. I rolled my shoulders to feel the slack hidden under\
  \ the overlapping strips of red leather. It was the best jacket I'd ever had, and\
  \ I liked feeling my tools close to hand. If I slapped my arms just so, razor-sharp\
  \ blades filled my fingers. Even in a tight spot, it was easy to slip a rake or\
  \ probe out of a hidden pocket.</p> \n    <p>I snagged a couple sausages from the\
  \ skillet, juggling them as the fat dripped down my fingers. It was time I learned\
  \ to be more careful around hot things.</p> \n    <p>Arnisant followed me out of\
  \ camp. When I paused, he sat at my side and gave me a pitiful look.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ broke a sausage in half and held it up. \"You stay off my bed. Got it?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The Arnisant Falls started flowing. Before he could drown in his own puddle\
  \ of drool, I dropped the sausage. He made it disappear and looked to me for more.\
  \ I finished mine before I let him have the other half of his. Otherwise he'd harry\
  \ me all the way to the brook.</p> \n    <p>We found the boss in the middle of the\
  \ stream. He stood on a stone, his pose telling me he was halfway through the Thirty-Six\
  \ Forms he'd learned from the masters of Dragon Temple. I'd learned the same exercises\
  \ from a less reputable source. No surprise, the boss still practiced the Forms,\
  \ and I had to admit he was a lot better at them than I was. Still, I made better\
  \ use of them up close and personal.</p> \n    <p>I hopped onto a nearby stone and\
  \ joined him. Usually we didn't go for more than a minute before he started pointing\
  \ out my mistakes. This time he didn't say a word. We just let our bodies flow through\
  \ the motions. </p> \n    <p>We finished and began again. As we Gathered the Sun\
  \ and did Crane Steps Forth, I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye. The\
  \ elf ranger Caladrel crouched on a branch overhanging the brook. He watched until\
  \ we finished the second routine.</p> \n    <p>The boss looked at Caladrel. An unspoken\
  \ message passed between them, and the elf dropped as light as a leaf to the ground.\
  \ He set aside his bow and quiver, slipped the long elven curveblade off his back.\
  \ Facing us, he imitated our movements as we did it all again.</p> \n    <p>By the\
  \ time we reached Tip the Leaf, I knew he was one hell of a quick learner.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Immaculate,\" the boss said when we were done. \"Have you studied?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caladrel shook his head. \"I practiced Willow-Oak calisthenics while\
  \ training for the rangers. Your exercise seems to have a similar purpose.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They collected their weapons, and Arni and I followed them back to the\
  \ campsite. Caladrel and the boss were the same height, a good five inches taller\
  \ than me. As they locked step, the boss fell into the ranger's rolling gait. As\
  \ long as I'd known him, he was a natural mimic, even when he wasn't trying.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It was good to see the boss in his long coat with the riffle scrolls\
  \ slung around his chest. The Shadowless Sword hanging from his hip should have\
  \ looked all wrong with his Chelish clothes, but somehow its black-and-gold lacquered\
  \ scabbard seemed to fit in just perfect. When he drew the blade, it moved as swiftly\
  \ as his Chelish rapier ever had. Swifter, even. He said that's how it got its name,\
  \ because it moved too fast for the sun to throw a shadow behind it.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ one difference I noticed in the count lately was that he'd lost that little bit\
  \ of gray in his hair. I couldn't tell whether he was using dye or magic, but it\
  \ was only a matter of time before I caught him at it. He was getting old, even\
  \ for a half-elf, but he hid it pretty good.</p> \n    <p>\"Prince Amarandlon sent\
  \ me to aid in your search,\" said Caladrel. He saw the boss's eyes narrow, same\
  \ as me. \"He explained that the expedition is under your command. I welcome the\
  \ opportunity to learn from you.\"</p> \n    <p>The boss nodded, but he was preening\
  \ on the inside. He likes having his toes kissed. I guess that can't be helped,\
  \ when you're born into the richest family in the richest country in the world.\
  \ \"The prince's message said I should expect two others.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Maybe\
  \ Faunra?\" I'd hoped to find that doe-eyed ranger in Omesta while the boss and\
  \ Fimbulthicket planned our excursion, but the gnomes told me she'd flown back to\
  \ Iadara. I made up for my disappointment by catching up on the sleep I'd lost with\
  \ Kemeili.</p> \n    <p>The boss gave me a look, but Caladrel smiled. He was turning\
  \ out to be a regular guy, despite the toe-kissing.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm afraid not,\"\
  \ said the elf. \"I'm here for the rangers. The others will represent other concerns.\
  \ Doubtless one will be the queen's creature.\"</p> \n    <p>The boss's eyebrow\
  \ rose a bit. Otherwise he masked his suspicion pretty good.</p> \n    <p>\"That\
  \ reminds me,\" Caladrel said, rummaging in his pack. \"I bring a gift from Prince\
  \ Amarandlon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Your master has been most generous to me,\" said\
  \ the boss. </p> \n    <p>\"Actually, the gift is for your associate.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>The boss masked his disappointment pretty bad.</p> \n    <p>Caladrel pulled\
  \ out a dirt-colored cloth and handed it to me. It was light as a handkerchief,\
  \ but I let it fall open and saw it was a full cloak with a hood.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Thanks,\" I said, trying to sound polite. \"But it's not really my style.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Your red leathers stand out against the forest,\" said Caladrel. \"\
  With scouts from the Witchbole venturing ever closer, stealth is our first line\
  \ of defense.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's kind of warm to wear a cloak, don't you think?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Try it on.\" </p> \n    <p>The boss gave me the look, so I threw\
  \ the cloak over my shoulders. The hem fell just above the top of my boots, covering\
  \ up my red jacket and pants. It wasn't too warm after all.</p> \n    <p>\"Much\
  \ better,\" said Caladrel. \"Now you aren't visible from a mile away.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Thanks.\" Maybe it'd get caught in a briar patch. Maybe a breeze would\
  \ blow it into a ravine. I revised my wish list for Lady Luck.</p> \n    <p>Back\
  \ at the camp, the gnome with the goofy name rolled his eyes when he saw we'd brought\
  \ company for breakfast. When the boss told him to expect two more, he shuffled\
  \ over to his pack and dug out more sausages. Grumbling as he rubbed his wrists,\
  \ he said, \"I hope they bring more provisions.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It would appear\
  \ one has,\" said Caladrel.</p> \n    <p>A tall figure came out of the forest. Mirror-bright\
  \ armor glinted out from beneath a hooded elven cloak like mine. The warrior's backpack\
  \ was twice the size of mine, and it came with a barn door of a shield and a rafter\
  \ of a sword.</p> \n    <p>The newcomer dropped the pack. Pulling back the hood,\
  \ she revealed herself as the Forlorn woman who'd slugged me at the queen's party.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Desna weeps.\" Sometimes I forget and say it out loud.</p> \n    <p>Caladrel\
  \ coughed. \"Count Jeggare, allow me to introduce Oparal, paladin of Iomedae.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Your Excellency.\" She made a stiff Chelish bow.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8511-Oparal.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8511-Oparal_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> Oparal can certainly handle herself in a fight.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>The boss barely nodded, reminding her of the pecking order. With a sly smile,\
  \ he said, \"I believe you are already acquainted with my bodyguard, Radovan.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The black pupils of her steel-colored eyes slid toward me. Her nostrils\
  \ flared. Her expression was almost comical except for the fact that my jaw still\
  \ ached. Otherwise, I would have tipped her a wink to show I wasn't scared.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I wasn't. Not much, anyway.</p> \n    <p>\"Hungry?\" asked the gnome.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yes,\" said Oparal. \"Our owl only just arrived.\"</p> \n    <p>At\
  \ a nod from the boss, Oparal went to sit beside the fire. I made the \"let's talk\"\
  \ sign. Caladrel caught the hint and joined the others at the fire while the boss\
  \ and I strolled out of earshot.</p> \n    <p>\"You sure this is a good idea? I\
  \ mean, seriously—a paladin?\" </p> \n    <p>\"We could wish for no better ally\
  \ if we encounter demons in the forest.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We don't need one of these\
  \ holy avengers. They make me nervous. You don't like them either. Besides, we've\
  \ handled fiends before.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I never said I don't like paladins. As\
  \ for demons, you and I have only ever faced one or two at a time, usually with\
  \ the Egorian Watch only a shout away.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're forgetting Iron Mountain.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I forget nothing,\" he said. \"Those were devils. And you were on\
  \ their side.\"</p> \n    <p>He had to remind me of that. \"I couldn't help it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"All I am saying is that the circumstances are different.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You weren't the one that ogress clobbered.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I was not\
  \ the one who offended her.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thanks for the sympathy.\" </p> \n\
  \    <p>The boss looked past me. That sly smile found its way back onto his face.\
  \ \"Perhaps our last companion will be more to your liking.\"</p> \n    <p>I turned\
  \ to see her approach. Under an elven cloak she wore black-and-yellow leathers—\
  wasp colors. A coiled whip hung at her back, pushing up her cloak like the bustle\
  \ of a ball gown.</p> \n    <p>Kemeili planted a fist on her hip and smiled at me.\
  \ \"You didn't think I'd let you get away that easily, did you?\"</p> \n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Caladrel paused and raised a hand. He lowered it, palm-down.\
  \ We all crouched low. Even Arnisant lay down without needing to be told. Clever\
  \ boy.</p> \n    <p>Whatever the ranger spotted, I was glad to set down my overstuffed\
  \ pack. The boss kept his books in his satchel, but I was the one hauling around\
  \ the rest, including his tent. At least he had all his little scrolls and widgets\
  \ in his coat and bandolier.</p> \n    <p>Caladrel beckoned the boss forward. I\
  \ went with him.</p> \n    <p>We peered through some bushes at a mob of demons ambling\
  \ through the forest. They wore the bodies of elves, some of them in scraps of ranger\
  \ leathers, but there was no mistaking them for real elves. They jiggled with every\
  \ step, glutted with something wriggling inside them. I counted seventeen of the\
  \ damned things.</p> \n    <p>\"Vermleks,\" whispered Caladrel. </p> \n    <p> \"\
  I will lead the attack,\" said Oparal, who'd joined us without an invitation. She\
  \ shrugged off her pack and set her shield on an arm as thick as mine. Traced in\
  \ gold on the shield's face was the image of a winged, eagle-headed woman.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"No,\" said the boss. \"There are too many for us simply to rush in.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The count is right,\" said Caladrel. </p> \n    <p>\"But we are\
  \ less than half a day from Omesta,\" said Kemeili, who I hadn't even heard creep\
  \ up on us. \"They have never come so close before.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They have,\
  \ and more often than you might think,\" said Caladrel. \"But we are charged with\
  \ protecting the queen's guest. You take your duty seriously, don't you, Oparal?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I—\" Oparal looked at the boss and me. \"I do.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Then wait. With your permission, Count Jeggare ...?\" </p> \n    <p>The boss gave\
  \ him the nod, and Caladrel drew an arrow from his quiver. I could have sworn the\
  \ fletching moved itself into his fingers, like the container was handing it to\
  \ him. He nocked the arrow. On its tip was a lump that looked like a plant bulb.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The boss whispered to Oparal. \"Caladrel knows the forest. We will follow\
  \ his lead.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course, Excellency.\"</p> \n    <p>\"In the field,\
  \ call me Varian.\"</p> \n    <p>I didn't like having a cloak on me, even if it\
  \ didn't make me too hot. I dropped it on the ground. As an afterthought, I shrugged\
  \ off my jacket, too. Oparal looked at me like I was stupid. Maybe she was right,\
  \ but I didn't want demon gore all over my new leathers.</p> \n    <p>Caladrel popped\
  \ up and back down so quick that I noticed the sound of his bow only after I realized\
  \ he was moving. The demons heard it, and some of them looked back in our direction.\
  \ A few stared so hard I felt like they were looking straight at me. I moved real\
  \ quiet-like, and their elven eyes followed me.</p> \n    <p>Past the demons, the\
  \ arrow hit the ground with a squelching sound. That got the attention of all the\
  \ demons. Wailing, they rushed toward the arrow, shoving each other to reach it\
  \ first.</p> \n    <p>\"The scent drives them mad,\" Caladrel whispered. He pointed\
  \ through the brush at a pair of demons ripping hunks of meat off each other. Caladrel\
  \ nodded up toward the forest canopy. \"It also attracts help.\" </p> \n    <p>At\
  \ first it looked like cones were dropping from the high branches, but there were\
  \ no pines around. The \"cones\" were fist-sized wasps.</p> \n    <p>\"Well done,\
  \ Caladrel,\" said Kemeili.</p> \n    <p>The demons noticed nothing but what was\
  \ between them and the scent. The wasps swarmed over them. For a few moments, the\
  \ demons didn't seem to notice. Then one began screaming and slapping at its elven\
  \ body. Its head swelled and darkened. An instant later, it burst open like a rotten\
  \ melon. A liver-colored worm's head burst out through its gaping neck, squealing\
  \ as it squirmed free of its wasp-stung body.</p> \n    <p>\"Now?\" Oparal had her\
  \ hand on her sword.</p> \n    <p>\"Let them weary themselves,\" said Caladrel.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>An impatient growl rumbled in Oparal's chest. She sounded like Arnisant\
  \ when he spied a cat. She was spoiling for a fight.</p> \n    <p>Six or seven of\
  \ the demons raised their stolen hands above their heads, gurgling unholy prayers.\
  \ The air around them congealed. The wasps fell to the ground while the demons crushed\
  \ the insects in a frenzy of slaps and stomps.</p> \n    <p>\"Now,\" said the boss.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>By the time I realized Caladrel had stood, he'd unleashed three or four\
  \ arrows. One jutted from the chest of a vermlek, blood spurting through its hollow\
  \ shaft.</p> \n    <p>Oparal charged the demons. Her sword struck quick as lightning\
  \ and blazed twice as bright. Two demons came up behind her, black energy surrounding\
  \ their hands as they reached for her. The boss riffled a scroll, and two gray bolts\
  \ of magic struck each vermlek in the face. They howled and clutched their eyes\
  \ as Oparal whipped her sword around and opened their bellies. Bloody worms as thick\
  \ as my arm poured out of the wounds. Below each thick head, the worms split into\
  \ four long tails, the tails further tipped with nests of countless tiny tentacles.\
  \ The abandoned elf bodies slumped to the ground.</p> \n    <p>The boss tucked his\
  \ expended scroll back into his bandolier. I stayed close in case one of the worms\
  \ went for him. Arni did the same, barking as a worm shot quick as a snake past\
  \ Oparal. The hound jumped in front of the boss, but the demon didn't go for the\
  \ count.</p> \n    <p>It raised a dripping tail and pointed straight at me. In the\
  \ squealing tongue of demons, it called out to its wormy buddies. Their heads swiveled\
  \ in my direction. They rushed me.</p> \n    <p>I tensed, deciding whether to stand\
  \ or dodge. </p> \n    <p>With a crack, Kemeili's whip caught the first vermlek\
  \ by one of its wormy tails. The demon struggled to get free, but the curved flaps\
  \ of the whip held it tight. Kemeili pulled it off course, giving me all the room\
  \ I needed.</p> \n    <p>I planted the big knife a couple of feet below the worm's\
  \ five-jawed mouth. Dark blood sprayed up as I pulled out the blade, but the demon\
  \ barely grunted at the wound. Maybe that's not where it kept its heart.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Or maybe vermleks don't need hearts.</p> \n    <p>It rammed its head against\
  \ my ribs, knocking the breath out of me. Arnisant's jaws caught the worm just below\
  \ its head. The hound shook once, twice, and the third time tore away a mass of\
  \ ruined flesh and six inches of bloody windpipe.</p> \n    <p>Turns out vermleks\
  \ do need windpipes.</p> \n    <p>We left it flopping on the ground and turned to\
  \ stop the next one coming toward me. None even came close.</p> \n    <p>Caladrel\
  \ and the boss each put down another one with their swords. The ranger's big two-hander\
  \ moved so fast that all I could see was its red blur. It hummed as it moved, louder\
  \ when it touched a demon. In the instant it was out of its sheath, the boss's Shadowless\
  \ Sword was damned near invisible. It looked as if everywhere he pointed his hand,\
  \ some magic power tore wounds in the demons' flesh.</p> \n    <p>Oparal cut the\
  \ legs out from under two vermleks trying to break away. As the worms escaped their\
  \ host bodies, she chopped them into pieces. </p> \n    <p>Kemeili twisted the handle\
  \ of her whip. Three long, wicked barbs grew from its tip. She lashed a vermlek\
  \ across the belly, revealing the worm inside. With another stroke, she tore it\
  \ out of its shelter. I filled it with darts from my jacket sleeves. It flopped\
  \ a few times and lay still.</p> \n    <p>It was over before I'd worked up a good\
  \ lather. I thought about how the vermleks had looked at me, then I began to sweat.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Oparal looked at me herself, eyes narrowing. The white light of her sword\
  \ began fading. She raised it up and chopped the head off another demon.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Caladrel joined her in the beheadings. The closer his sword came to the\
  \ vermleks, the more it glowed like blood on a lantern pane. As the demons died,\
  \ so did the glow.</p> \n    <p>The boss had been right. It was good to have a couple\
  \ demon slayers with us. I only hoped they didn't mistake me for one of the bad\
  \ guys. </p> \n    <p>Kemeili wiped the gore off her whip while the gnome looked\
  \ us over for injuries. A gnome-sized whirlwind floated just above the grass behind\
  \ him, but it hadn't left his side during the battle. He didn't find any wounds\
  \ on us. \"Not even a scratch!\" </p> \n    <p>Good thing, I thought as I fetched\
  \ my jacket. Otherwise I'd have felt pretty silly setting aside what little armor\
  \ I had. I promised myself not to do that again, even if it meant getting a little\
  \ slime on my leathers.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't sound so disappointed,\" Kemeili said\
  \ to the gnome. \"Or maybe next time just help us fight them.\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ waved away her complaint. \"I've seen scum like these a dozen times before. I\
  \ knew you could handle them. They're boring.\"</p> \n    <p>The boss knelt to examine\
  \ the dead demons. I counted time in my head until he broke out his sketchbook.\
  \ Fourteen seconds—a new record.</p> \n    <p>Kemeili shot me a silent question.\
  \ <i>What is he doing?</i> </p> \n    <p>I could have told her that the boss is\
  \ a student of everything, but the truth is he likes weird stuff best. For instance,\
  \ he calls himself a botanist—a fancy word for \"gardener\"—but the plants he likes\
  \ most are the freaks like those whispering lilies he used to give his Pathfinder\
  \ agents. They could plant one wherever they were, talk into the flower, and their\
  \ words would come through lily's twin in the boss's greenhouse.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ could have told her that, but I didn't want to lead her on. If she'd finagled\
  \ her way into the group because she couldn't get enough of me, well, who could\
  \ blame her? On the other hand, it was way too convenient. If the queen had sent\
  \ Oparal, that left the temple to send Kemeili. And while the Calistrians were bunches\
  \ of fun with their temple baths and prostitutes, guile and revenge weren't high\
  \ on my list of good times.</p> \n    <p>Kemeili waited for an answer until I shrugged\
  \ and turned away, pretending to concentrate on cleaning the gore off my knife.\
  \ Once the boss decided we had to bury the elven bodies and burn their demon hosts,\
  \ I kept busy enough to avoid her for the rest of the afternoon.</p> \n    <p>After\
  \ we finished, we hustled east until the boss called a halt at dusk.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ was about time, I figured, since I was carrying twice as much gear as anybody\
  \ except the paladin, and I'd decided she was half giant.</p> \n    <p>Actually,\
  \ she didn't look half bad. I liked how the sunlight made her black hair shine almost\
  \ blue, but she never cracked a smile, especially when she saw me looking back at\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>The gnome dropped his pack. It hit the ground with a heavy thump.\
  \ I grabbed the strap and hefted it. It was almost too much to lift in one hand.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Hey, Thick. How do you haul so much?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Fimbulthicket,\"\
  \ he corrected me, but then he smiled. He'd shaken off his morning grump, but he\
  \ still winced as if every move brought out a bad ache in his bones. \"I imbued\
  \ myself with the might of an ant.\"</p> \n    <p>\"An ant?\" </p> \n    <p>\"Proportionately,\
  \ they are far more powerful than we gnomes. Even stronger than you humans.\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>He called me human, so I liked him a little better, despite his stupid\
  \ name. \"So you cast a spell?\"</p> \n    <p>He nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"You got\
  \ to teach the boss that one.\" I touched my own aching back. It'd be worth one\
  \ of his riffle scrolls to lighten my load. </p> \n    <p>The gnome shook his head.\
  \ \"It's not some arcane formula, but rather my connection to the Green that lends\
  \ me power.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I get it. You're more like a cleric than a wizard.\
  \ But the boss is a clever guy. Maybe he could figure out a way to do with his scrolls\
  \ what you do with your Green.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps.\" The gnome shrugged, then\
  \ brightened. \"If he did, it would certainly be the first time that I ever heard\
  \ of such a thing.\"</p> \n    <p>The boss doled out chores, and no one seemed to\
  \ mind his giving orders. Caladrel made a fire as Kemeili skinned the hares he'd\
  \ shot while he scouted ahead during our hike. She was good with a knife, as I knew\
  \ better than most.</p> \n    <p>\"Hey, boss. I could use a little help with that\
  \ thing over there.\"</p> \n    <p>He glanced at Kemeili and back at me. We walked\
  \ off far enough that I figured the elves wouldn't overhear us.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I'm starting to think it's a bad idea to take Kemeili with us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  She is an official representative of the temple of Calistria,\" he said. \"You realize\
  \ they are the most influential sect in Kyonin?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yeah, yeah.\" He'd\
  \ given me the long lesson before we'd arrived, and I could list the names of all\
  \ the elf gods. I liked that they worshiped Lady Luck, same as me and the boss,\
  \ but their favorite was Calistria, the Savored Sting. \"I'm just saying I don't\
  \ think she's here for the right reason. Even if she was, she's going to be a distraction.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"She is important not only to the success of our mission but to the\
  \ continued goodwill of her temple, the court, and the queen herself.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Sure, but—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Just keep her happy,\" he said. \"That should\
  \ not be too onerous. Or have you lost your touch with the ladies?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Lost my—? Hey, now. You know that's not a problem.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I hear quite\
  \ a few wild boasts, but when we face a situation that requires a certain subtle—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>\"Fine.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Fine?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Fine, I'll keep\
  \ her happy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Excellent,\" he said, turning to go back to the others.\
  \ He paused and added, \"Just not near camp. Show some discretion.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ boss and Oparal went off to fetch water, talking as they went. I had his tent\
  \ set up and his gear stowed inside by the time they returned with filled canteens\
  \ and waterskins.</p> \n    <p>I stretched out Arnisant's supper by giving him a\
  \ little at a time rather than throwing him a whole hare. By the time it was gone,\
  \ he didn't even give me the starving dog routine. He just settled down at the boss's\
  \ feet.</p> \n    <p>\"What other varieties of fiend might we face?\" the boss asked\
  \ Caladrel.</p> \n    <p>\"The list is endless,\" said Caladrel. \"The vermlek are\
  \ the least of them. I have fought over a dozen kinds, but many others lurk in Tanglebriar\
  \ or await summons from the Abyss.\"</p> \n    <p>\"This is why I returned to Kyonin,\"\
  \ said Oparal. \"To wipe this filth from our land.\"</p> \n    <p>Caladrel raised\
  \ his leather tankard in salute. \"May you touch the Brightness.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  A laudable goal,\" said the boss. \"But I would be as glad to avoid them as to slaughter\
  \ them. Our mission is to find Variel Morgethai.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are all here\
  \ to help you find your father, Varian,\" said Kemeili. He usually told people to\
  \ call him by his given name 'in the field,' as he put it. Still, I didn't like\
  \ the way she said it. Maybe he would have to be the one to keep her happy. That\
  \ thought was more annoying than I'd expected it to be. </p> \n    <p>\"Are we certain\
  \ he still lives?\" said Oparal. \"No one has seen him for almost a century.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I would know if he had died,\" said the gnome. He rubbed his knuckles.\
  \ \"I would feel it.\"</p> \n    <p>The boss shot him a curious look. It was a weird\
  \ thing to say. From the way everyone else looked away, I wasn't the only one who\
  \ thought so.</p> \n    <p>The gnome picked up on it too. \"I would feel it in the\
  \ Green. Variel has always been a strong presence in the land.\"</p> \n    <p>Everybody\
  \ nodded as if that explained everything, but it still killed the conversation.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Caladrel and Oparal discussed the best ways to kill demons. Lightning\
  \ and poison were useless. Fire, frost, and acid weren't so good either, but that\
  \ mattered more to the boss, who had to pick the right spells to write in his riffle\
  \ scrolls. Since I'd had the big knife whammied in Goka, I was all set to slice\
  \ off a hunk of demon.</p> \n    <p>As we banked the fire and got ready to sleep,\
  \ I caught another of those looks from Kemeili. It was weird how she could look\
  \ like a girl one moment—complete with a baby-doll voice that shouldn't have done\
  \ it for me but, to be honest, kind of did—and then turn her head in the firelight\
  \ to become all woman.</p> \n    <p>Well, maybe part tiger, too.</p> \n    <p>Sleep\
  \ is what I wanted, and Kemeili looked like she had more than cuddles on her mind.\
  \ I rolled up the elven cloak and shook out my jacket, trying to make it clear that\
  \ I was ready for sleep.</p> \n    <p>\"What's that?\" said Oparal. She sat on a\
  \ fallen log beside the fire, her big sword across her knees. \"That image on your\
  \ jacket.\"</p> \n    <p>I held it up, showing off the phoenix on the back. \"Phoenix.\
  \ Big flaming bird. They got them over in Tian Xia.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Did you see\
  \ one?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yeah. Once. Kind of.\"</p> \n    <p>Oparal tilted her head\
  \ to the side, obviously not buying my story.</p> \n    <p>\"I had this jacket made\
  \ to remind me of all the fights I had in Tian Xia. That's a land on the other side\
  \ of the—\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know what Tian Xia is.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, long\
  \ story short, I got into a few tussles over there. Each of these pictures is kind\
  \ of my souvenir.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Trophies of your kills?\"</p> \n    <p>I didn't\
  \ like her tone. It didn't matter to me what god she wore on her shield. She had\
  \ no business judging me. Still, I wasn't about to back down just because she wore\
  \ shiny armor. \"I didn't kill them all,\" I said. \"Just the ones who got in my\
  \ face with their righteous attitudes.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's no phoenix.\" She\
  \ held up her shield to show off the bird-woman—which now that I looked closer,\
  \ did bear some suspicious similarities to the symbol on my jacket. Not the same,\
  \ but close enough to make me wonder what the artist had known. \"It was someone\
  \ bearing the symbol of my order, wasn't it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nah,\" I said. \"\
  It was a whole other country. Different gods and everything.\"</p> \n    <p>Oparal\
  \ reached into a belt pouch and brought out a little jar. She opened it and dipped\
  \ in a finger before drawing a little sun on her brow, across her lips, and on the\
  \ armor over her heart. \"Tell me again who you killed,\" she said. \"I will know\
  \ if you lie.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's enough,\" said the boss.</p> \n    <p>\"So\
  \ you know what he did?\" said Oparal.</p> \n    <p>He didn't know, because I hadn't\
  \ told him. The moment he hesitated to answer, Oparal knew it too.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  There were two of them,\" I said. \"Well, one woman in two bodies. I think one of\
  \ them was a paladin. I wasn't looking for a fight, but they were. This phoenix\
  \ on my jacket, that's what was left of them afterward.\"</p> \n    <p>Oparal's\
  \ eyes widened. No doubt she was surprised I'd told the truth.</p> \n    <p>\"Like\
  \ I said, I wasn't the one looking for a fight.\"</p> \n    <p> \"You killed a paladin!\"\
  \ She dropped her jar of holy balm and drew her sword an inch from its sheath. It\
  \ lit up the trees around us.</p> \n    <p>\"Put that away,\" said Caladrel. \"\
  They can see that light in Razmiran.\"</p> \n    <p>When Oparal didn't move, the\
  \ boss snapped, \"Sheathe your weapon, or return to Iadara and tell the queen we\
  \ have no use for you.\"</p> \n    <p>Oparal shoved the blade back into place, but\
  \ her eyes never left my face. I folded the jacket so nobody else could see the\
  \ phoenix or any of the other figures carved into its leather. Eventually I turned\
  \ away from Oparal and walked out of camp, half-hoping the boss or Arni would follow.\
  \ But they didn't.</p> \n    <p>I found a cozy spot just within range of the fire's\
  \ light and sat down. What pissed me off about Oparal wasn't that she'd made me\
  \ admit what I did. I didn't give a good damn what she thought. I just didn't like\
  \ thinking about the people I'd killed. Most of them had it coming—killers themselves,\
  \ or worse. Others came looking to kill me, and I shouldn't have felt a bit bad\
  \ about killing them first.</p> \n    <p>But this phoenix paladin, when she'd found\
  \ me, she thought she'd found a devil. A monster, not a man. I tried telling her\
  \ otherwise, but she wouldn't listen. So I could say I hadn't killed her. She'd\
  \ killed herself.</p> \n    <p>But that was a lie, and I knew it. The truth was\
  \ that I beat her before I killed her. I could have walked away. Well, run away.\
  \ But I could have got away—that was the point. I could have got away and left her\
  \ there alive.</p> \n    <p>But that's not what I did.</p> \n    <p>Shoving the\
  \ jacket under my head for a pillow, I lay down alone. When sleep finally caught\
  \ up with me, it brought me nightmares about the people who hadn't had it coming.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>People I'd killed anyway.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want more?\
