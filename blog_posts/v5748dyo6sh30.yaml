  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Before I turn the blog over to developer Michael\
  \ Sayre for a preview of this month’s Pathfinder Society offerings, I wanted to\
  \ give a quick update on volunteer opportunities for PaizoCon, Gen Con, UK Games\
  \ Expo, and Origins. The Organized Play Foundation sent the first set of letters\
  \ out to potential PaizoCon volunteers. If you didn’t get one and thought you should,\
  \ please email <a href=\"mailto:paizoconleads@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">paizoconleads@gmail.com</a>.\
  \ If you didn’t submit a questionnaire yet, they still have spaces available. The\
  \ questionnaires for Gen Con and Origins opened yesterday. While UK Games Expo should\
  \ have opened today, we’ve been advised there are a few GDPR items that they wish\
  \ to look at before making the open call and expect they will open next Wednesday.\
  \ To find the questionnaires, visit <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/home/convention-volunteer-registration/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/home/convention-volunteer-registration/</a>.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Come back later today to check out the Starfinder Society preview!</p>\

  \ <em>Organized Play Manager</em> </p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Here we\
  \ are, barreling toward the end of another month! In case you’re not familiar with\
  \ what that means, it’s time for the previews of the scenarios that are about to\
  \ be released!</p> \n     <p>The first adventure I’m going to be talking about is\
  \ the Tier 1–4 adventure <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022la?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-112-The-Burden-of-Envy\"\
  >Burden of Envy</a>, by Lysle Kapp, a returning author who was previously part of\
  \ the team that wrote the quest pack <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4p?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1016-What-the-Helms-Hide\"\
  >What the Helms Hide</a>. In Burden of Envy, the PCs are sent on a mission by two\
  \ returning fan-favorite NPCs, the unscrupulous Sczarni crime lord Guaril Karela\
  \ and the reborn aasimar faction leader Valais Durant. What could lead these two\
  \ unlikely allies to work together, you ask? Well, Guaril has been smuggling refugees\
  \ from the runelord-ruled city of Xin Edasseril, but once again he’s pushed his\
  \ luck too far, and now the Runelord of Envy has put a price on his head. Valais\
  \ has agreed to call upon her allies in the Radiant Oath faction to complete Guaril’\
  s contract and bring the refugees to safety, but only under the condition that Guaril\
  \ use some of the profits he’s extracted to ensure the refugees are provided with\
  \ jobs and housing once they’re safely relocated. Hopefully, the PCs will find a\
  \ safe home for refugees like poor Yuleg Bluingot here!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ <p>If altruism isn’t your jam, you might find that our Tier 3–6 scenario, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq022lb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-113-Devil-at-the-Crossroads\"\
  >Devil at the Crossroads</a>, is more to your tastes. The idea for this adventure\
  \ was brainstormed at Gen Con 2019 during our adventure design workshop, and the\
  \ theme and tone of this adventure were inspired by thrillers like <i>Bad Times\
  \ at the El Royale</i> and <i>The Hateful Eight</i>. During this adventure, the\
  \ PCs head to an old trading post in the Sarkoris Scar to meet up and exchange reports\
  \ with a member of the Farheaven Clan, longtime allies of the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ Things take a turn for the weird when a malevolent spirit traps the PCs inside\
  \ the trading post with a colorful cast of NPCs, each with their own agenda. The\
  \ PCs will have to sort friend from foe if they have any hope of surviving the night,\
  \ and it won’t be easy. After all, who wouldn’t trust a face like this?</p> \n \

  \ <p>And finally, we introduce a new author to Paizo with Quinn Murphy’s Tier 1–\
  4 quest, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022kv?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-6-Archaeology-in-Aspenthar\"\
  >Archaeology in Aspenthar</a>. With opportunities for exploring tombs and pyramids\
  \ drying up in Osirion, an ambitious nobleman in nearby Thuvia sees an opportunity\
  \ to cash in on the world’s demand for ancient Osiriani secrets. Unfortunately,\
  \ some folks are more interested in a quick buck than fair dealing, and the PCs\
  \ may just uncover more than they bargained for. Luckily, they’ll have some help\
  \ and guidance from allies like Sefu Moyo here to guide them along the way!</p>\
