  \ Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Cheap Sack</h2> \n   <p>The dwarf slumped on\
  \ the floor of the closet. The manacles on his wrists were newly bolted to the deck\
  \ to form a makeshift brig.</p> \n   <p>“I’d never harm Pekko,” said Jaska. “Without\
  \ him, I’m out of business.”</p> \n   <p>“You’re out of business because you got\
  \ pinched smuggling poison,” said Radovan.</p> \n   <p>“Satyr’s tears aren’t just\
  \ poison,” said Jaska. “They’re are a key ingredient in remedies for all sorts of\
  \ ills. For some, it’s the only thing that works.”</p> \n   <p>That much I knew\
  \ to be true, but the satyr’s tears had now been used to murder two men aboard ship,\
  \ and a search of their cabins had failed to uncover the <i>Lacuna Codex</i>. The\
  \ poisonous herbs, however, turned up in a search of the crates—already opened—\
  in the dwarves’ cabin.</p> \n   <p>“Who else might have had a motive for poisoning\
  \ your partner?” I said.</p> \n   <p>“Nobody,” moaned Jaska. “Everybody loved Pekko.\
  \ He had an easy way about him. I know the business, but Pekko knew the customers.\
  \ He did his best work with that flask of his.”</p> \n   <p>“Yet you never indulged\
  \ in drink.”</p> \n   <p>Jaska flushed. “Even outside my people, no one respects\
  \ a dwarf who won’t so much as raise a toast.”</p> \n   <p>“What? Are you some kind\
  \ of monk or something?” said Radovan.</p> \n   <p>I ventured a supposition.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“You suffer from some sort of inflammatory ailment, probably gout,” I\
  \ said. “If it is so acute as to require satyr’s tears, then alcoholic beverages\
  \ must incite excruciating attacks.”</p> \n   <p>The dwarf nodded. “I told Captain\
  \ Qoloth as much, but he wouldn’t hear it. All he cares about is arriving in Absalom\
  \ with his murders solved.”</p> \n   <p>“How did you intend to disguise your abstinence\
  \ at the sherry tasting?”</p> \n   <p>“I usually say I’d just had a drink or two.\
  \ This time it was trickier, since Pekko and I had just been chatting with Menas.\
  \ They shared a few drinks in our cabin before the party.”</p> \n   <p>“Did you\
  \ have business with Lord Neverion?”</p> \n   <p>“Not yet,” said Jaska. “Pekko thought\
  \ him a good future prospect, so I left them to it while I visited the head.”</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“Could anyone else have overheard their conversation?”</p> \n   <p>He\
  \ pondered. “I passed a crewman, and also that girl and the elf. One of them might\
  \ have entered the cabin between the time I left and when I arrived at the Neverions’\
  \ party.”</p> \n   <p>“Who awaited you there?”</p> \n   <p>“Our hosts, of course.\
  \ And Pekko. Oh, and one of the crew was just leaving. He’d brought fresh glasses.\
  \ Menas almost handed me one, but thankfully his wife distracted him, and then Pekko\
  \ kept him occupied with...” he choked \"...with his stupid jokes.”</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ presence of the ship’s crew complicated matters more than I liked, yet I knew\
  \ no reason Shadya or Murviniel would desire the death of Menas Neverion. Worse,\
  \ my most recent visit to the deck confirmed my suspicion that dampening magic was\
  \ not the least of the Sea Lion’s enchantments. We had nearly arrived in Absalom,\
  \ far ahead of schedule even considering the favorable winds. Time was running out.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We left Jaska to his confinement. As we walked to Lady Neverion’s new\
  \ quarters, we saw a deckhand emerging from her cabin, arms full of bags. The ship\
  \ turned sharply, and the docking whistle sounded above. We had arrived.</p> \n\
  \   <p>With a brief pause to fetch Arnisant from our cabin, we hastened above decks,\
  \ where the crew prepared to dock. Already we were within the wide harbor of Absalom,\
  \ its docks stretching east to west. Ships from a dozen different ports vied with\
  \ the Sea Lion for an available berth. Behind their colored sails and banners, the\
  \ manors and temples of Absalom rose up to the grand Starstone Cathedral in the\
  \ distance.</p> \n   <p>Captain Qoloth stood near the main mast, Lady Neverion’\
  s hand on his fingers.</p> \n   <p>“Thank you for agreeing to speed our journey,”\
  \ she said as his whiskers brushed her hand. “It will soothe my nerves to spend\
  \ a few days on land before returning to bury my husband.”</p> \n   <p>“And no doubt\
  \ it is some consolation to see justice done.” He glowered at Jaska, who stood shackled\
  \ and glum between a pair of sailors.</p> \n   <p>“Indeed,” Charikla sniffed before\
  \ indicating a crate of wine bottles left on deck. “Please accept this gift for\
  \ your men. I never touch the stuff. This common sack is all my husband would drink\
  \ when no one was looking, even though it aggravated his gout.”</p> \n   <p>Something\
  \ tickled in my mind at the word “gout.” Considering his age and girth, it was no\
  \ surprise that Menas should suffer from the same affliction as Jaska. But what\
  \ could the dwarf hope to gain from the merchant lord’s death? </p> \n   <p>The\
  \ captain, on the other hand, had been most considerate in providing Charikla with\
  \ an alternative to the cabin in which her husband had died. Furthermore, he had\
  \ commanded me not to trouble her after the discovery of the poisonous herbs among\
  \ the dwarves’ cargo. As a wealthy widow, Charikla was well suited to reward Qoloth\
  \ for his compliance. </p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Murviniel.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"What exactly is Murviniel carrying in that enormous backpack?\"\
  \n   </div> \n   <p>Shadya and Murviniel emerged from the passenger cabins. A porter\
  \ trailed behind the Qadiran woman, but the elf carried his own over-burdened backpack.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“You ask me,” said Radovan, “every damned one of them is guilty of something.”\
  </p> \n   <p>Such a simple remark, yet it spawned a hasty theory that just might\
  \ fit our circumstances.</p> \n   <p>“Captain Qoloth,” I said. “A moment, if you\
  \ please.”</p> \n   <p>Everyone who had been preparing to debark stopped to listen.\
  \ That was well, but the ship’s master looked displeased. “Make it quick.”</p> \n\
  \   <p>“I implore you to keep everyone aboard until we can summon the city guard\
  \ and resolve the matter of these murders, not to mention the theft of my property.”\
  </p> \n   <p>“We have our killer, and I already told you the theft is not my responsibility.”\
  </p> \n   <p>“But you don’t have the killer,” I said. “In fact, you’ve imprisoned\
  \ the one innocent man among your passengers—myself excepted, of course.”</p> \n\
  \   <p>“And me,” said Radovan. He grinned, stopping just short of revealing the\
  \ full horror of his smile. “I haven’t done anything real nasty in weeks.”</p> \n\
  \   <p>Radovan’s uninvited aside once again proved handy.</p> \n   <p>“Despite his\
  \ fearsome appearance, my bodyguard is a fine example of the adage that one should\
  \ not judge a book by its cover. Of course, sometimes a cover is honest. For example,\
  \ you, Captain, are probably much as you appear: a practical businessman who runs\
  \ an efficient ship with a disciplined crew.</p> \n   <p>“I’m—” Qoloth hesitated,\
  \ considering whether I was mocking or flattering him.</p> \n   <p>“Lady Neverion\
  \ is also much as she appears, a woman of noble breeding in mourning for her late\
  \ husband.”</p> \n   <p>Charikla bowed her head in assent.</p> \n   <p>“But not\
  \ mourning for her second late husband.” She bristled, and I added, “No one could\
  \ mistake you for a happy couple. You were ashamed of his coarse manners and low\
  \ breeding. If not for the misfortunes of your estate, you should never have thought\
  \ twice about marriage so far beneath your station. Oh, I believe your horror at\
  \ his death was genuine. Perhaps you did not expect the method of his murder to\
  \ be quite so horrible, nor for it to occur so close to you. Yet twice you prevented\
  \ him from offering a drink to others. You knew which was the tainted glass.”</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Charikla’s lips trembled briefly, but she could deny none of what I had\
  \ said. I turned toward Shadya.</p> \n   <p>“Our other female companion is also\
  \ much as she appears, but one must examine her cover closely.” I raised a finger\
  \ to silence Radovan, who I sensed had been poised to add a remark. “Despite your\
  \ immodest behavior, Shadya, you have no air of desperation about you. No matter\
  \ how successful your thefts, you could not have stolen the refined taste to choose\
  \ such fashionable garments as those you wore the night of the sherry tasting. You\
  \ are a dilettante from a wealthy family. You steal not for necessity but for the\
  \ thrill of transgression.”</p> \n   <p>“I didn’t take your book,” she said. Her\
  \ voice betrayed a rising fear, and I marked the direction of her gaze when it left\
  \ my eyes.</p> \n   <p>She indicated exactly the person I had begun to suspect.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“No,” I agreed. “You merely provided the diversion, drawing my attention\
  \ and that of my bodyguard while the true thief stole the Codex from my satchel.\
  \ What I did not realize before was that not everyone at the dock in Cassomir was\
  \ fooled by your charade. Someone else witnessed the theft, and the price for her\
  \ silence was the murder of her husband.”</p> \n   <p>Lady Neverion’s face paled.\
  \ She was past anger now, wading deeper into the cool waters of fear as I spoke.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“But why was Pekko killed?” demanded Jaska. One of the sailors guarding\
  \ him jerked his chains to silence him, but the other man looked at the dwarf with\
  \ sympathy. </p> \n   <p>“To cover the killer’s tracks. The murderer visited your\
  \ cabin before the party and acquired a sample of the satyr’s tears from Pekko.”\
  \ I turned toward the elf.</p> \n   <p>“But I told you,” Murviniel said. “I’ve only\
  \ read about such herbs.”</p> \n   <p>“And yet you brought along a pouch of nettle\
  \ tea on what you pretend is your first visit to Absalom. You fooled me at first,\
  \ but I see now what lies beneath your false cover: a thief and a killer.”</p> \n\
  \   <p>“You’re mad,” he said. “Very well, then. Let’s hear the rest of it. What\
  \ tale will Venture-Captain Varian Jeggare spin for us next? Oh, will it appear\
  \ in the next volume of the <i>Chronicles</i>?”</p> \n   <p>“You are no mere Pathfinder\
  \ applicant. That ring upon your finger resembles those a certain venture-captain\
  \ presented to her agents decades ago.”</p> \n   <p>Murviniel shrugged. “One of\
  \ whom must have fallen on hard times and sold it.”</p> \n   <p>“Plausible, I admit.\
  \ But there are more surprises under your cover. The nettle tea you drink soothes\
  \ a number of ailments, most of them peculiar to men of middle years. Sometimes\
  \ even I forget how misleading a youthful elven appearance can be. One day—perhaps\
  \ already—the nettle tea will no longer ameliorate your illness. You cannot say\
  \ you are unfamiliar with the effects of satyr’s tears, both beneficial and toxic.”\
  </p> \n   <p>“That’s—that’s—” His naive front evaporated. “What motive would I have\
  \ for killing Neverion?”</p> \n   <p>“Before you stole the <i>Lacuna Codex</i>,\
  \ you had none. But you had to repay the silence of the one who witnessed your theft.\
  \ Is that not correct, Lady Neverion?”</p> \n   <p>Charikla adopted a statue’s gaze,\
  \ staring off into the distance.</p> \n   <p>“Everyone else present was a man, except\
  \ for the barmaid—whose attentions were devoted to Radovan—and Lady Neverion, who\
  \ as a lady of noble birth naturally turned away from Shadya’s bawdy antics. What\
  \ did she see? I would have noticed had you approached close enough to dip a hand\
  \ inside my luggage. I wager you plucked it out with a spell.”</p> \n   <p>“You\
  \ <i>did</i> do it!” Shadya shoved Murviniel away from her. She closed the distance\
  \ and struck him again, pushing him over and over.</p> \n   <p>“How do you know\
  \ that, sweetheart?” said Radovan. He slid over to Murviniel’s other side, drawing\
  \ his attention by producing his big knife.</p> \n   <p>Shadya answered me rather\
  \ than Radovan. “This elf bet me I couldn’t let your henchman see that I was lifting\
  \ your purse while leaving you unawares.” She pointed at Murviniel. “If I had known\
  \ about a killing, I would have told someone. He said it must have been the other\
  \ dwarf who killed him, over some sort of business dispute.”</p> \n   <p>“So much\
  \ for honor among thieves,” said Murviniel, turning his back to the gunwales. “\
  You may be your own most ardent admirer, Count Jeggare. But I must admit you figured\
  \ it out eventually. Too bad it’s just a bit too late.” He fell over the edge of\
  \ the ship and plunged into the water.</p> \n   <p>“Man overboard!” cried a sailor.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>I ran to the side and looked down just in time to see Murviniel kick\
  \ away from the ship. Once free of the <i>Sea Lion</i>’s dampening field, he vanished\
  \ in a twinkle of magic. I recognized the effect of a minor teleportation spell\
  \ and looked up along the pier. There he reappeared, already sprinting through the\
  \ chaotic mass of laborers.</p> \n   <p>I withdrew a riffle scroll and prepared\
  \ to throw myself into the water, hoping the scroll would still function after a\
  \ good drenching.</p> \n   <p>“Wait,” said Shadya. “You can find him later, can’\
  t you?”</p> \n   <p>“Perhaps, but I cannot allow him a chance to pass the <i>Lacuna\
  \ Codex</i> to a confederate. The book is untraceable by magic, and I—” </p> \n\
  \   <p>“This is your book?” Shadya tossed me my <i>Bestiary</i> of Garund. I shook\
  \ my head, but then I saw fragments of Murviniel’s wicker backpack clinging to the\
  \ cover, and I recalled the shoves Shadya had given him. She had cut his pack like\
  \ a purse. </p> \n   <p>The <i>Bestiary</i> was stuffed full of loose sheets between\
  \ its pages. Flipping through, I recognized pages of the <i>Lacuna <i>Codex</i></i>.\
  \ Murviniel had hidden them in plain sight during my visit to his cabin. Yet there\
  \ were too few pages to account for the entire tome.</p> \n   <p>“Not all of it\
  \ is here.”</p> \n   <p>Shadya revealed several more slender volumes she had liberated\
  \ from the elf’s pack and concealed behind her back. Two more were also full of\
  \ <i>Codex</i> pages. A quick accounting ascertained that she had recovered them\
  \ all. My sigh of relief deflated me so completely that I almost sank to my knees.\
  \ Arnisant approached to sniff me, assuring himself I was unharmed.</p> \n   <p>“\
  Nice work,” Radovan told Shadya. She smiled before remembering she was angry with\
  \ him. Before she could cement the frown to her face, he whispered something to\
  \ make her laugh.</p> \n   <p>I looked past them to see one of Qoloth’s men take\
  \ Lady Neverion by the arm while a second confiscated her dogs. Shaking his head,\
  \ the captain signaled the guards to release Jaska from his bonds.</p> \n   <p>“\
  I can’t say I’m glad to lose the bonus the lady promised for swift passage,” said\
  \ Qoloth. He said nothing more, perhaps hoping that his silence would prompt me\
  \ to compensate him for his loss.</p> \n   <p>As the crew set the gangplank on the\
  \ dock, I oversaw the conveyance of our luggage while Radovan exchanged a few words\
  \ with Shadya. The manner in which they stood so close suggested she had forgiven\
  \ him, at least in part, for his earlier rough behavior. It had, after all, won\
  \ her wager with Murviniel.</p> \n   <p>“I don’t expect the boss will want you charged,”\
  \ Radovan said. “He’s a pretty understanding guy.”</p> \n   <p>“Perhaps a reward\
  \ for rescuing his books?”</p> \n   <p>“He ain’t <i>that</i> understanding. But\
  \ what kind of reward did you have in mind?”</p> \n   <p>“Perhaps another kiss,”\
  \ she said. “I wasn’t prepared to appreciate the last one.”</p> \n   <p>A smile\
  \ spread across Radovan’s wide jaws. He stopped it at what he calls “the little\
  \ smile” before moving in to grant Shadya’s request.</p> \n   <p>Standing beside\
  \ me, Qoloth asked, “How does he do that?”</p> \n   <p>I shrugged. “No one knows.”\
  </p> \n   <p>We finished our business, glancing up from time to time to see whether\
  \ the way was clear. When Shadya at last withdrew from Radovan’s embrace, she shouldered\
  \ her bag and skipped across the gangplank. She waved once without looking back\
  \ and disappeared into the crowd.</p> \n   <p>Radovan was still grinning as he hefted\
  \ a few of our bags.</p> \n   <p>“You know she lifted your purse,” I said.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Radovan traced his thumb over his lips and gazed into the waterfront crowds.\
  \ “Yeah,” he said. “I know.”</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The guilty conscience\
