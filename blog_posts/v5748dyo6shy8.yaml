  \ to welcome Maggie Gallagher as our new Director of People and Culture. Maggie’\
  s experience and skillset are a perfect fit for Paizo, and we think that her personality;\
  \ her commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion; and her passion for strong\
  \ relationships truly make her the right person for our company today.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>So, let’s let Maggie introduce herself. </p> \n     <blockquote> \n     \
  \ <p>“I come to Paizo with over 20 years of HR experience in fields including biomedical\
  \ repair, software engineering, and various theaters and operas,” “While a true\
  \ HR generalist, my passions are in diversity, equity, and inclusion. I have worked\
  \ with numerous organizations in helping them implement Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\
  \ (DEI) programs and initiatives that advance organizational and cultural change\
  \ by ensuring DEI considerations are incorporated in all aspects of the decision-making\
  \ process.”</p> \n      <p>Maggie has also served as an instructor, volunteer, and\
  \ presenter for several LGBTQ+ organizations. For the past five years, she has focused\
  \ on groups and organizations that actively advocate for the rights of transgender\
  \ individuals.</p> \n      <p>“Outside of work, I enjoy wandering the wilderness,\
  \ fishing, and canoeing. As much as I love the outdoors, I am a true nerd at heart.\
  \ I have been playing RPGs and Tabletop games for over 30 years, so I am very excited\
  \ to be joining the Paizo team.” </p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Maggie can\
  \ be reached via email at maggie.gallagher@paizo.com.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
