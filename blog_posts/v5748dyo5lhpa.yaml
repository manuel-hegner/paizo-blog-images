  \ by Ivan Troitsky</i>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">While all\
  \ of the occult classes have some connection to strange otherworldly forces, the\
  \ medium is the only one crazy enough to allow all sorts of spirits to enter his\
  \ body and mind in order to share their strength, allowing the spirits to gain more\
  \ and more influence over him in exchange for great power. The playtest medium's\
  \ spirits were based on the cards of the Harrow deck. Since that meant 54 spirits,\
  \ each with unique abilities, that proved far too lengthy to fit in <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> without cutting, so I've saved that work, and we're\
  \ hoping to release it in some venue.</p> \n     <p>The medium in the final book,\
  \ however, has a new theme and direction, bolstered by countless ideas from playtesters\
  \ that didn't fit with the Harrowed medium but work great in the new paradigm. In\
  \ the new approach, the medium's spirits are born from the Astral Plane, where the\
  \ Astral stuff clings to tiny fragments of the souls of people that pass through\
  \ it and blends them with the tales and thoughts of others about those people. Spirits\
  \ of power thus arrive from one of six different sorts of legends, which share their\
  \ names with mythic paths (archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, and\
  \ trickster). Within those categories, a medium might find countless spirits with\
  \ slightly different abilities. For example, one trickster spirit might be able\
  \ to help with sneaking and another with grifting. A rondelero duelist champion\
  \ might be a master of the falcate, and a samurai champion might know how to use\
  \ a katana. Because these six legends correspond strongly to party roles, this change\
  \ allows the new medium an unparalleled ability to fill in whatever role you need\
  \ that day. Going to a masquerade ball? Bring a trickster master of disguise. Party\
  \ missing a cleric today? Bring a hierophant and literally add the divine spells\
  \ you need to your spell list that day. Same with archmage for arcane spells. And\
  \ while the medium is still sometimes a 4-level spellcaster, both the archmage and\
  \ hierophant progress him up to a 6-level spellcaster!</p> \n     <p>The Harrowed\
  \ medium built a special spell list solely from his spirits, but the new medium\
  \ has his own spell lists, with some intriguing early-access options fitting of\
  \ a 4-level spellcaster. Furthermore, he is the only 4-level spellcaster currently\
  \ in the game that receives cantrips at all (and he gets them at 1st-level). This\
  \ adds a lot of versatility to his options if he chooses a more martial sort of\
  \ spirit, and it fits with the fact that he can temporarily gain 1st-level spells\
  \ too, if he picks the archmage or the hierophant.</p> \n     <p>The medium could\
  \ always use seances to bring spirits into himself and grant benefits to allies,\
  \ and the new medium can still do that, but he also gained some special new types\
  \ of seance that let him do things like trance at a location to learn of its tragic\
  \ past or even channel a haunt into his body so his party can try to reason with\
  \ it. The medium can now accept strange taboos from his spirit to gain extra benefits,\
  \ causing him to act in unusual ways that befit the spirit's temperament. Lastly,\
  \ the medium's astral ties allow him to perform other incredible feats, like at-will\
  \ astral projection at 14th level!</p> \n     <p>But wait, you say, what about the\
  \ archetypes? If the medium changed that much, how do the archetypes work? To make\
  \ sure that the archetypes were an absolutely perfect fit for the medium, after\
  \ the changes, I wrote them from scratch myself. And boy, some of them do some crazy\
  \ and fun things! The kami medium (whose awesome art graces this blog) channels\
  \ the spirits of kami instead of legends, losing all the Astral abilities for the\
  \ ability to use strange ofuda and shikigami, and even gain a ward like a kami does.\
  \ The reanimated medium is a medium in reverse: after dying, he borrows from his\
  \ own potential future legends to come back and possess his own body, keeping himself\
  \ alive. This unique state grants him a variety of benefits and unusual trade-offs.\
  \ The relic channeler possesses particular relics of a select group of spirits,\
  \ meaning she contacts the same ones each time. She gains object-based powers and\
  \ receives extraordinary benefits in exchange for the lack of flexibility. The spirit\
  \ dancer shakes the whole system of spirits on its head; instead of choosing a spirit\
  \ each day and gaining its powers for the whole day, he selects a suite of spirits\
  \ and spends rounds from a daily pool, allowing him to slip in and out of his suite\
  \ of spirits with ease, in a strange and exhilarating dance. The storyteller is\
  \ more obsessed with the stories and legends than she even is with the spirits themselves;\
  \ they are a means to the end of discovering more about the tales of the past. She\
  \ gains lesser benefits from her spirits in exchange for enhanced knowledge, story-based\
  \ abilities, and some of the most powerful applications of bardic performance (like\
  \ inspire courage). Also, she can send you into a story of her own making forever\
  \ at 20th level, which is pretty nasty!</p> \n     <p>So however you enjoy letting\
  \ strange spirits take your body for a test drive, <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> and the medium class have something right for you!</p>\
