  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s nearly August 1st,\
  \ and that means we’re about a week away from launching the Second Edition of Pathfinder\
  \ in all its glory. What better way to do that than with some great adventures?\
  \ Today we’re previewing not only the final scenario for the First Edition campaign,\
  \ but also the wealth of new Second Edition content kicking off the Year of the\
  \ Open Road!</p> \n     <p>First off, we have the last scenario for Pathfinder Society\
  \ with the First Edition rules: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1023-Passing-the-Torch-Part-2-Who-Speaks-for-the-Ten\"\
  >Passing the Torch, Part 2: Who Speaks for the Ten</a>. This scenario features the\
  \ dream team of John Compton and Thurston Hillman as authors (neither of whom wrote\
  \ this part of the blog, so I can get away with praising them). It’s written for\
  \ Tier 12–18, so if you’re looking for a chance to play high level content, I recommend\
  \ that you play June’s scenario <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1022-Passing-the-Torch-Part-1-Who-Wears-the-Mask\"\
  >Passing the Torch, Part 1: Who Wears the Mask</a> first, then continue the story\
  \ to its grand conclusion here. </p> \n     <p>In Passing the Torch Part 2, the\
  \ PCs return to Absalom only to find the Grand Lodge’s gates sealed, with all manner\
  \ of chaos taking place within. The PCs are the last line of defense against the\
  \ schemes of an evil mastermind who plans to unbury and animate deceased Pathfinders\
  \ on a massive scale. In this scenario, the PCs learn new secrets about the mysterious\
  \ Decemvirate, and must make several crucial decisions. One of these concerns the\
  \ fate of the polarizing and enigmatic information broker Grandmaster Torch, illustrated\
  \ below by Vicky Yarova. If you want to uncover more of this scenario’s mysteries,\
  \ put on your GM hat or bring your highest-level character and dive in!</p> \n \

  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Origin of the Open Road</a>, a Tier 5 adventure\
  \ for pregenerated characters written by Ron Lundeen, the PCs are sent to Nexus\
  \ House in Quantium, looking to retrieve some old records of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ missing from the Grand Lodge’s oft-beset archives. As the PCs undertake their\
  \ mission to find the documents detailing long-missing truths about the origins\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society itself, the magical constructs and abstruse arcanists\
  \ of Quantium present unexpected aid and obstacles in near equal measure!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Arcane guardians and alchemical creations are far from the only threats\
  \ the PCs will face, however. Other parties seek to glean the ancient secrets of\
  \ Nexus House for their own purposes, while those who count themselves as friends\
  \ of the Society juggle their own responsibilities. What friends and nemeses hide\
  \ in Quantium’s shadows? What allies might the PCs discover as they seek the lost\
  \ histories of the Pathfinder Society?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  >Pathfinder Society Scenario 1-01: The Absalom Initiation</a>, by Lyz Liddell, is\
  \ the scenario to play if you want a strong grounding in Pathfinder Society lore.\
  \ This Tier 1–4 scenario begins with the PCs receiving a party invitation from newly\
  \ promoted Head Initiate Janira Gavix (illustrated by Gislaine Avila). Visit iconic\
  \ locations in Absalom like the Blakros Museum, meet the new faction leaders, and\
  \ learn what the faction leaders from First Edition are doing now. As this scenario\
  \ is repeatable, players who participate in the scenario for a second and third\
  \ time are likely to find themselves learning the stories of different First Edition\
  \ faction leaders and embarking on different missions, facing new challenges along\
  \ the way. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072419_JaniraGavix.jpg\"\

  >Illustration by Gislaine Avila</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>When the team was brainstorming\
  \ scenario ideas, we began asking ourselves what kinds of adventures we’d created\
  \ recently: explore the place, recover the artifact, punch the villain, and that\
  \ type has received plenty of attention, but we recognized that for all the Pathfinders\
  \ love breaking into sites, they’ve not spent nearly enough time investigating cryptids.\
  \ Months before, a close friend had insisted that a spooky being known as the Mosquito\
  \ Witch was a well-known cryptid, yet for all our searching, we could find no reference\
  \ to such a creature on the internet. It seemed the ideal time for a cryptid hunt,\
  \ the Mosquito Witch seemed the ideal creature, and we found the ideal author to\
  \ write <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01znc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-102-The-Mosquito-Witch\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-02: The Mosquito Witch</a>: Eleanor Ferron, who\
  \ brings an endearing yet haunting creepiness to the adventure. At long last the\
  \ creature can spread its sinister wings and come to life! I mean, just look at\
  \ that adorable commemorative Mosquito Witch doll!</p> \n     <p>The PCs travel\
  \ to the quaint river town of Shimmerford, which has embraced the Mosquito Witch\
  \ legend for decades ever since residents first spotted the creature. But what had\
  \ been a light-hearted mascot cryptid for the town has recently become a living\
  \ nightmare. It’s up to the PCs to get to the bottom of this local legend before\
  \ they and the entire populace are sucked dry!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1–03: Escaping the Grave</a>, author Adrian Ng takes\
  \ us on a Tier 1–4 adventure into the undead-haunted Gravelands. As the undead hordes\
  \ serving Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, ravaged the Inner Sea, heroes of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society united to form a powerful line of defense against the encroaching\
  \ darkness. When the Tyrant was defeated, the Society’s brave explorers were the\
  \ first to re-enter the Gravelands, seeking to recover the irreplaceable relics\
  \ of Lastwall, aid any lost survivors, and survey the extent of Tar-Baphon’s corruption.\
  \ Most have not returned from the haunted and blasted lands.</p> \n     <p>Those\
  \ members of the Society who have completed the round trip to and from the Gravelands\
  \ have returned with valuable information, including relatively safe roads and passages,\
  \ as well as detailed information on the movements of the undead hordes patrolling\
  \ the countryside. Armed with this information, Venture-Captain Evni Zongnoss calls\
  \ for Pathfinder agents willing to undertake a somber task indeed: rescue any surviving\
  \ Pathfinders near a small town, and if they’re confirmed dead, retrieve their bodies\
  \ (or at least their <i>wayfinders</i>) so that the brave agents can be memorialized\
  \ on the Wall of Names and so their families and friends might have proper closure.\
  \ The PCs will need to be quick if they are to get in and out without drawing the\
  \ attention of Tar-Baphon’s unbreathing minions, but some undead are faster than\
  \ others, and speed alone will not be enough to complete this vital task.</p> \n\

  \ this adventure, the PCs travel to a recently discovered site in Osirion, only\

  \ be, the guard watching over the site, Officer Elrekah, hasn’t noticed anything\
