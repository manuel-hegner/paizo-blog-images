  \ Play Part III: The Rules that Govern the World</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday,\
  \ April 4, 2011</p> \n   <p>Continuing our series of Monday blogs on the future\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society, today let's talk about the campaign documents that\
  \ outline the rules of the campaign.</p> \n   <p>The <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play</i> has seen several incarnations since the campaign began in summer\
  \ 2008. Currently in version 3.0.2, it has grown to a dense, 38-page PDF including\
  \ the basics for players, GMs, and coordinators, as well as many explanations and\
  \ clarifications of rare corner cases. While most of these rules are staying the\
  \ same, the nature of any campaign is that it evolves. And the current document\
  \ is simply too unwieldy for us to continually update, re-layout, and re-edit (not\
  \ to mention print, for all of you following along at home). Today, we'll be updating\
  \ the document to version 3.0.3 with a few revisions noted below; this will be the\
  \ last revision to this document until we release version 4.0 in July.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>A few months ago we moved the list of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/resources\"\
  >Additional Resources</a> to their own page on the website where we can more easily\
  \ update them without needing to redo the entire guide every month. This has worked\
  \ out really well for us, and we plan to keep updating it here. This table of information\
  \ has been removed from v3.0.3, replaced with instructions to find this information\
  \ on paizo.com instead.</p> \n   <p>Additionally, we replaced the old replay rules\
  \ section on page 18 with the new rule implemented on the messageboards in October\
  \ outlining the 1:1 player/GM credit rule. We've clarified the Play! Play! Play!\
  \ rule on page 17 to try to eliminate the misconception that the rule should negate\
  \ every other rule in the book, while maintaining its intent of encouraging people\
  \ to find creative solutions in order not to have to turn people away. Finally,\
  \ we clarified a rule that was incorrectly interpreted in past versions of the guide\
  \ regarding animal companions with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher (page 20).</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So what's in store for campaign documentation in the future? Great things!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In July, we'll release not one but <i>three</i> new campaign documents,\
  \ each with a different target audience. The first will be a 4-page introduction\
  \ to the campaign with only the basic overview of the campaign and how someone can\
  \ get started right away. This will be aimed at people new to the campaign who wander\
  \ up at a game store or convention and just need the bare minimum to get started\
  \ right then and there. We'll also have a longer, more detailed version of the player's\
  \ campaign guide with extended information on additional options and explanations\
  \ of factions, traits, day jobs, spending Prestige, and so on. The third book will\
  \ be a GM- and coordinator-oriented information about creating sessions, reporting,\
  \ and other organizational elements of the campaign.</p> \n   <p>Many of the specific\
  \ corner cases and campaign specific rules that don't really belong in something\
  \ everyone's expected to download and print before participating in the campaign\
  \ will be moved to an online FAQ instead. This will allow us to more quickly address\
  \ rules clarifications in a single, easy-to-find location instead of continually\
  \ bloating the PDF campaign documents. We will have the FAQ up and full of information\
  \ by the time Season 3 kicks off, and maybe even sooner if the deadline gods smile\
  \ upon us.</p> \n   <p>Check back here next Monday for a glimpse at the first of\
  \ next season's 10 factions—the freedom-loving nation of Andoran—and see what changes\
  \ they've brought about in the last three years of dominating Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
