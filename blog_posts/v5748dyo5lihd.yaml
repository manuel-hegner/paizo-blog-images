  description\">See, Chris is one of those authors that editors like me dream about.\
  \ Not only is he a fabulous writer, perfectly balancing action and character development,\
  \ but he also lives and breathes Pathfinder. He knows Golarion inside and out, and\
  \ has a mastery of the rules that never ceases to amaze me. (Seriously, if you only\
  \ knew the number of times he's brought up an interesting corner case or rules exploit\
  \ that caused hours of discussion among the designers and developers...) Combined,\
  \ those two aspects of his writing make his books a delight to read, both as a reader\
  \ and as a gamer. How <i>would</i> naval combat work in Pathfinder? What kinds of\
  \ magical defenses <i>would</i> a Chelish ship have? How could a naga best disguise\
  \ herself as human? How might a sorcerer use magic to infiltrate a coven of paranoid\
  \ witches? Chris uses the rules of magic not just as a storyteller looking to forward\
  \ a plot, but as a person living in that world would, which means there's always\
  \ something I can take away from his books for use at the gaming table.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Yet really, it's Chris's characters that get to me. At this point, I feel\
  \ like I know Torius and Celeste and Snick and Vreva as well as I know Chris himself—\
  maybe better, since I've spent so much time in their heads. They <i>feel</i> like\
  \ real people to me, in a way that only the best characters do. When I suggest an\
  \ edit to Chris, it's usually phrased like \"Celeste wouldn't say that\"—as if she\
  \ were a mutual friend, rather than someone he made up out of whole cloth. That's\
  \ the power of a good character.</p> \n    <p>So in <a href=\"\"><em>Pirate's Prophecy</em></a>,\
  \ it's exciting to catch up again with the crew of the <i>Stargazer</i>, to see\
  \ them settling into their new roles as abolitionist privateers for Andoran. While\
  \ the crew may be perfectly happy to steal from slavers and spirit the freed slaves\
  \ away to freedom, being involved in the world of international politics comes with\
  \ a whole new heap of troubles. When expert spy Vreva Jhafae uncovers a Chelish\
  \ plot to unleash a terrible weapon on Andoren ports, only the crew of the <i>Stargazer</i>\
  \ can stop it without blowing her cover. Yet even as Vreva puts herself in harm's\
  \ way with a series of <i>Mission: Impossible</i> style infiltrations, Celeste finds\
  \ herself suddenly speaking in tongues and wrestling with the appearance of strange\
  \ new powers...</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive\
