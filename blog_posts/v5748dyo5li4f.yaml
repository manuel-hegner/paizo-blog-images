  \  <p>Oh, what pretty little thing have we here? What pretty-pretty have you brought\
  \ me today? Nice. Good weight. Very rare. In fact, a bit too rare. Is this stolen?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Oh, what am I saying? You're an adventurer—of course it's stolen. But\
  \ that's fine! That's fine. Not a lot of clean hands Red Silk Route, are there?\
  \ I can find you a nice price, so long as you didn't kill whoever it belonged to.\
  \ You kill someone over a pretty little bauble, and the first thing their friends\
  \ look for is the bauble itself. Follow the money and you—</p> \n    <p>Oh dear.\
  \ Is that blood? Well, you're complicating my life by the moment, aren't you? I\
  \ can't sell this here.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Wait, wait! Where\
  \ are you going?! I said I could sell your pretty-pretty here, not that I couldn't\
  \ sell it. Goodness, but are all adventurers so defeatist? The sign on the door\
  \ does say \"All wares bought and sold,\" after all. I wouldn't want you to think\
  \ I'm a crook. I have friends on many foreign shores who love their pretty things.\
  \ I have just the ship and captain to slip it out of town—both are very quiet and\
  \ very well-formed. We could smuggle you out along with it, perhaps? I understand\
  \ how you sellsword types love your violent ends, but perhaps you'd like to postpone\
  \ yours a bit. We'll find you a whole new life in some other greasy underbelly,\
  \ and get you back to stabbing and stealing as soon as you like.</p> \n    <p>Check\
  \ through this little guidebook I have, <a href=\"/products/btpy9h7x\"><em>Black\
  \ Markets</em></a>. A bit literal, I know, but I think we can all agree that allusions\
  \ went the way of Ghol-Gan.</p> \n    <p>Not even a pretty smile for that one? Abadar's\
  \ bronzed knickers, you lot are humorless when you're being hunted for murder. Well\
  \ regardless, we've got a few treats for you in here: Pick out the black market\
  \ of your choice from around the Inner Sea where you can land on your feet, and\
  \ if you don't see anything you like, well you can always start you own my discerning\
  \ little sack of contraband. All the rules are right there.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Not sure you're cut out for crime? The bloodstains on your\
  \ boots speak otherwise. I mean, we're all cut out for a little petty larceny, but\
  \ you certainly have no qualms cutting out what's owed you. But if you'd rather\
  \ look into a new line of work, the guide offers a few helpful hints, like the pesh-addled\
  \ sorcerer of sleep; get your jollies and give them out for free. You'll be the\
  \ absolute life of the party. Or push your own brands of magical death by becoming\
  \ an Eldritch Poisoner; pairs well with the selection of magical necrotoxins I'm\
  \ selling these days— and for you, pretty one, I'll offer a lovely bulk discount.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Wherever you're going, you'll need a few tricks like those anyway. I\
  \ can stock you up on personal, portable traps—you do seem like the paranoid sort.\
  \ Or a few polished-up cursed relics you can sell as genuine magic. Seven Hells,\
  \ I've a man out back who will stich ghouls' guts into you for enough coin. Whatever\
  \ it takes to finish this deal and get you out of my shop, before disrespectable\
  \ sorts come looking for the bauble you've brought me. <a href=\"/products/btpy9h7x\"\
