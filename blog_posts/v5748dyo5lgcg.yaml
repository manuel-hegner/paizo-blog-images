  \ Changes to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ July 30, 2014</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Apologies in advance, as this blog entry is going to get a bit arcane.\
  \ No, I don't mean it's not rechargeable by a Divine spellcaster—I mean this article\
  \ is meant for Pathfinder Adventure Card Game rules enthusiasts. I'm going to define\
  \ the differences between the PACG rules a year ago and the ones we have now, possibly\
  \ in excruciating detail. You've been warned.</span></p> \n    <p>When we set out\
  \ to design the new <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"><i>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</i> sets</a> and the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\"\
  >Class Decks</a>, we had heard many players pointing out ways our game could improve.\
  \ We were faced with a fork in the road. Choosing Path One meant leaving everything\
  \ alone and forging ahead with what we had created as is. That was the path of least\
  \ resistance, requiring very little explanation, but keeping in place some things\
  \ that were confusing about our game. Choosing Path Two required us to change those\
  \ things and explain them in a blog like this one. I think you folks are good enough\
  \ pathfinders that you know which one we picked.</p> \n    <p>So, yeah, some things\
  \ are going to look a little different from now on. These are not the kinds of things\
  \ we're going to issue errata for; everything works pretty much the same as it did\
  \ in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"><i>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</i></a>. But the new cards will look just a bit different. Here are\
  \ some of the highlights.</p> \n    <p>To start out, let's look at two versions\
  \ of the weapon Longbow: the first one is from Rise of the Runelords, and the second\
  \ is from the <a href=\"/products/btpy97ic\">Ranger Class Deck</a>.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Longbow.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Longbow_120.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6804-Longbow.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6804-Longbow_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>There are some minor differences here. The first is the\
  \ replacement of the phrase \"roll your Dexterity or Ranged die\" with \"use your\
  \ Dexterity or Ranged skill.\" In Skull &amp; Shackles, \"skill\" always refers\
  \ to your base die (say, a d8) plus any skill feats or bonuses you might have. If\
  \ Harsk is using the Longbow with Ranged: Dexterity d8+2, and he has two +1 skill\
  \ feats in Dexterity, his Ranged skill is d8+4. The concept of the \"unmodified\"\
  \ die is also gone: when we say \"die\" now, we always mean <i>just</i> the die.\
  \ So if Harsk is using the Longbow, and he has Strength: d6 and one +1 skill feat\
  \ in Strength, adding the Strength <i>die</i> to his Ranged skill means he adds\
  \ the d6 and ignores the feat, just as before. The wording is more specific, but\
  \ the math hasn't changed at all.</p> \n    <p>A subtler change on the card is replacing\
  \ the word \"a\" with \"any\" in the last power. This makes it a bit more clear\
  \ that it applies to checks other than your own.</p> \n    <p>Okay, now for a couple\
  \ of spells. Here's the <i>Runelords</i> version of Force Missile and the new one\
  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy97if\">Wizard Class Deck</a>.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ForceMissile.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ForceMissile_120.jpeg\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-ForceMissile.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-ForceMissile_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>There are two big changes here. Most visibly, the recharge\
  \ box is gone. Players seemed to get confused by the recharge box, including figuring\
  \ out when to apply that power, so we built the recharge power into the powers box.\
  \ With luck, people won't be baffled by that any more.</p> \n    <p>Reading the\
  \ text, you'll note that the power no longer tells you to apply the Force trait.\
  \ That's because this rule is clearly stated in the rulebook:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Some cards may allow you to replace the required skill for a check\
  \ with a different one. As part of this action, you may play only 1 card or use\
  \ only 1 power that defines the skill you are going to use. When you play a card\
  \ that does this, add that card's traits to the check.</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>So Force Missile still adds the Force trait to your combat check (along\
  \ with the Magic, Arcane, Attack, and Basic traits)—it just doesn't spell it out\
  \ in a way that suggests it's somehow <i>different</i> from those other traits.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now let's compare two scary ladies: the Hook Mountain Hag from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy966p\">\"The Hook Mountain Massacre\"</a> and the Sea Hag from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"><i>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</i></a>.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-HookMountainHag.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-HookMountainHag_120.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-SeaHag.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-SeaHag_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In <i>Runelords</i>, things that happened \"before the\
  \ encounter\" really happened <i>during</i> the encounter, after you had a chance\
  \ to evade the card. In <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i>, there’s a new step called \"\
  acting,\" which includes everything that happens after you choose not to evade a\
  \ card up until the encounter is resolved. Things can happen before you act, while\
  \ you act, and after you act. Here’s the rulebook text on the \"before you act\"\
  \ step.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i><b>Apply Any Effects That Happen Before\
  \ You Act.</b> If any powers on the card you're encountering happen before you act,\
  \ they take effect at this time. You may also use powers or cards that state they\
  \ can be used before you act.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Another change\
  \ here is replacing the phrase \"spells with the Attack trait\" with \"spells that\
  \ have the Attack trait.\" The meaning of \"with\" was not clear enough: did it\
  \ mean you couldn't play a spell that itself had the Attack trait, or did it mean\
  \ you couldn't play a spell in conjunction with any card that gave the Attack trait\
  \ to the check? The new wording makes it clear that the intent is the former.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A side note on henchman cards: The rule about henchmen automatically\
  \ allowing you to close a location after you defeat one is gone from the rulebook.\
  \ If a henchman allows you to close the location when it's defeated, it says so\
  \ in its power; if not, it doesn't. (I expect you won't like the ones that don't.\
  \ They're called Curses, and we'll leave them for another day.)</p> \n    <p>Here\
  \ are two boons: the ally Jakardros Sovark from \"The Hook Mountain Massacre\" and\
  \ the item Ring of the Beasts from \"The Wormwood Mutiny\".</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JakardrosSovark.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JakardrosSovark_120.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-RingOfTheBeasts.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-RingOfTheBeasts_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>In <i>Runelords</i>, you'd occasionally see a card that helped a combat\
  \ check \"against\" a monster. That term \"against\" was never defined, but it benefited\
  \ from some definition, because it could also apply to checks of other sorts. Now,\
  \ the new phrase \"check against a card\" applies to any check the card mandates.\
  \ The rule is:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>If a card refers to a check against\
  \ another card, that refers to any check required by that card, whether it's a check\
  \ to defeat, a check to acquire, a check to recharge, or any other check.</i></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Here's the Collapsed Ceiling, a card I kinda wish\
  \ we didn't put in Runelords, because it needed rules support that the game did\
  \ not provide. That's been solved, so you'll see a lot of cards like Goose in the\
  \ Rigging from \"The Wormwood Mutiny\".</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-CollapsedCeiling.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-CollapsedCeiling_120.jpeg\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GooseInTheRigging.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GooseInTheRigging_120.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>It was frustrating not to be able to answer all the questions associated\
  \ with Collapsed Ceiling. For example, it wasn't clear what happened when you had\
  \ two faceup cards on the deck or when something suggested you shuffle one of them\
  \ into the deck. The <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i> rules now tell you how to handle\
  \ cards like this.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i><b>Faceup Cards:</b> Sometimes\
  \ a card is left faceup on the top of the location deck (for example, most barriers\
  \ with the Task trait work this way). The card is still in the deck, but it can\
  \ only be shuffled into the deck when the condition that caused it to be left faceup\
  \ on the deck has been resolved. If such a card tells you that you must encounter\
  \ it on your first exploration on a turn, then after that exploration, ignore it\
  \ for the purpose of additional explorations that turn; however, it still counts\
  \ as the top card of the deck for any other purpose. If multiple cards are left\
  \ faceup on the same deck, you may place them in any order and encounter them in\
  \ that order.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Finally, let's look at one of\
  \ the most bizarre cards in <i>Runelords</i>: the Runeforged Weapons loot card from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy92qa\">\"Sins of the Saviors\"</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-RuneforgedWeapons.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-RuneforgedWeapons_120.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>You see that word SPECIAL? You see it twice on the card? Protip:\
  \ That's a sign that a game designer hasn't made up his mind what he's doing. This\
  \ card quite honestly had no idea what it was. That's because we designed it before\
  \ we had the rules tech to make it work. But now we do. If <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i>\
  \ had existed before <i>Runelords</i>, Runeforged Weapons would certainly have been\
  \ a support card. Support cards are a new type of card that's neither bane nor boon.\
  \ We talked about them in our last <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i> preview; basically,\
  \ their job is to sit on the table and affect the game. This is what Runeforged\
  \ Weapons might look like if it was issued today.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-RuneforgedWeaponsUpdated_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We've also made a number of less obvious changes to the\
  \ rulebook—reorganizing things and rewriting things—that make it clearer and easier\
  \ to use than the <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> rulebook. We recommend that you use\
  \ it as your main rules reference even if you're still playing Rise of the Runelords—\
  just ignore all that stuff about ships.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
