  \ at Rise of the Runelords</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, January 27, 2012</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8o6b\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>These last few weeks it’s seemed like even the weather has\
  \ been conspiring to delay a big preview of Rise of the Runelords, the next set\
  \ for our <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted miniatures line. I snuck an image of the shaggy Yeti in <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ld0w\">last week’s preview blog</a>, but until today, the stars\
  \ have not quite been right to begin our previews in earnest.</p> \n    <p>No longer!\
  \ The Runelords have been slumbering for too long, and they demand to be unleashed\
  \ upon the world! Our long wait is finally at an end, and I’m ready to blow the\
  \ lid off the first batch of preview images from this upcoming set!</p> \n    <p>WizKids\
  \ is still finalizing the specific details about when specifically the set will\
  \ release, how it will be packaged, and how much it will cost (which is why we haven’\
  t posted a product page yet). Yesterday, we finally revealed the first Pathfinder\
  \ Battles Encounter Pack, <a href=\"/products/btpy8qsa\">Champions of Evil</a>,\
  \ which features repainted figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a> in a convenient non-random format. You know exactly what you’re getting\
  \ in this new set of 6 miniatures, which includes three Zombies, an Evil Cleric,\
  \ a Succubus, and the evil Scarlet Gargoyle. The whole pack ties into our Free RPG\
  \ Day adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy8qsb\">Dawn of the Scarlet Sun</a>, which\
  \ releases in June. If you haven’t seen the Champions of Evil sculpts and paints\
  \ yet, hop over to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qsa\">product page</a> and check\
  \ them out! They’re really cool!</p> \n    <p>You know what else is cool? The Human\
  \ Ranger from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>! This guy\
  \ is probably my favorite player character-appropriate figure from the first set,\
  \ but thanks to a series of mix-ups we never managed to reveal a good picture of\
  \ him here on the blog. Because I’ve been promising it for a couple of weeks now,\
  \ I thought I’d sneak him in here, even though he’s not a Rise of the Runelords\
  \ miniature.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-HumanRanger_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-HumanRanger_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Heck, if you like the way this figure looks, you can <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8qj4\">order him directly as a single</a>. While you’re doing that,\
  \ feel free to browse the other <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures/singles/heroesMonstersSingles\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters singles</a> to fill out your collection or simply pick up\
  \ your favorites from the set without worrying about the randomness of individual\
  \ boosters.</p> \n    <p>But you didn’t come here for <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> images. You want the new, fresh meat. You want RISE OF\
  \ THE RUNELORDS!</p> \n    <p>And I am here to deliver. This first batch focuses\
  \ on paint masters of several creatures from the first half of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>, which releases in June as a deluxe hardcover\
  \ Anniversary Edition that compiles all six adventures and key associated material\
  \ from Paizo’s very first Adventure Path. We’re thrilled to get a chance to go back\
  \ to where it all started, and update everything to the new Pathfinder RPG rules.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We’re also thrilled to be working with WizKids to present prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures to support the campaign. The full set includes a nice mixture\
  \ of “generic” creatures drawn from the campaign’s encounters as well as specific\
  \ NPCs from the adventures themselves.</p> \n    <p>One of the greatest encounter\
  \ areas of the campaign’s first installment, <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\"><i>Burnt\
  \ Offerings</i></a>, is the goblin enclave of Thistletop. While the goblins themselves\
  \ will appear in a future preview blog (and there are some really awesome ones in\
  \ this set), today’s preview starts with a look at some of the locale’s other denizens.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-BugbearHero_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-BugbearHero_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Up first is the Bugbear Hero, a common figure that represents\
  \ the bruiser Bruthazmus, the bodyguard of the adventure’s arch-villain, Nualia\
  \ (more on her in a future preview). Of course, when you’re talking about a bugbear\
  \ that wears a necklace of elf ears, “Hero” is a relative term!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-Malfeshnekor_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-Malfeshnekor_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Up next is the fiendish spirit of Thistletop, the evil Malfeshnekor!\
  \ This uncommon figure comes on a Large base, and towers over the goblins who honor\
  \ and fear him.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-Harpy_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-Harpy_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>On your journey back to the town of Sandpoint from Thistletop, be sure\
  \ to watch the skies for this screeching Harpy, a common figure. This Medium creature\
  \ has beautiful wings, nasty claws, and sharp teeth. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-Sinspawn_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-Sinspawn_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>One of the coolest things about the Rise of the Runelords set\
  \ for those of us here in the Paizo offices is that it offers us the first chance\
  \ to create prepainted miniatures of creatures that are uniquely “Pathfinder”. Here\
  \ we have a common Sinspawn, the servitor slaves of the ancient Runelords, stirred\
  \ once more to life with the reawakening of Runewells all over Varisia.</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-TreacheryDemon_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-TreacheryDemon_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of sin, check out this amazing fiend we like to call\
  \ the Treachery Demon! If you thought the Ettin from Heroes &amp; Monsters was big,\
  \ you’re going to choke when you see this titan hit the table. I have a new-ish\
  \ GI Joe action figure on my desk, and the Huge Treachery Demon towers over him.\
  \ It probably goes without saying, but this guy is a rare.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-YoungRedDragon_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/012712-YoungRedDragon_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of rares, check out this Young Red Dragon! As a Large\
  \ figure, this guy looks down on your player characters with childlike innocence,\
  \ ready to engulf them in its fiery breath! The sculptors perfectly captured the\
  \ likeness of this dragon’s illustration. The only thing that makes me happier than\
  \ this dragon is the OTHER dragon in the Rise of the Runelords set, who is even\
  \ BIGGER and even AWESOMER.</p> \n    <p>“Awesomer.” That non-word is probably the\
  \ best summary of the entire Rise of the Runelords set. We’re enormously proud of\
  \ the final figures in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>,\
  \ but WizKids really upped their game with this second set. Every single mini in\
  \ this one is a winner, and we haven’t even shown you some of the absolute coolest\
  \ miniatures in the set yet!</p> \n    <p>But we will.</p> \n    <p>Starting next\
  \ week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </blockquote> <!--\
