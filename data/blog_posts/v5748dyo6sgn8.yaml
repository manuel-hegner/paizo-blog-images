  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Pathfinder fans haven't had as much\
  \ time to get to know the iconic goblin alchemist, Fumbus, as they have our other\
  \ iconic characters, but that doesn't mean he isn't up to the same shenanigans as\
  \ the rest of the crew. He might be new to the mix, but he's far from free of high-stakes\
  \ adventure. We had initially not planned on doing an Iconic Encounter for Fumbus,\
  \ as he didn't have an Iconic Evolution video to accompany his story, but after\
  \ the rest of the series was so well received by the community, we decided to complete\
  \ the set with a piece for all twelve iconics, not just those carrying over from\
  \ first edition. While this is the last Iconic Encounter for now, we've loved putting\
  \ them together, and the door's always open for more of them in the future. In the\
  \ meantime, enjoy this piece of flash fiction from James L. Sutter showing the sorts\
  \ of stories you can tell with Pathfinder Second Edition, available August 1!</p>\

  \     <blockquote> \n      <p>Maybe it was the way they were holding him—upside\
  \ down with a knife to his throat—but Fumbus was starting to get the impression\
  \ that the wererats didn't want any pickles.</p> \n      <p>It didn't make any sense.\
  \ Fumbus was usually pretty good with rats. At first, they'd scratch and bite, like\
  \ all wild, furry things, but typically all you had to do was give them a bit of\
  \ food and convince them you weren't going to eat them, and pretty soon they'd calm\
  \ right down.</p> \n      <p>At which point you <em>would</em> eat them—because\
  \ they were rats. But they didn't need to know that.</p> \n      <p>These rats,\
  \ however, hadn't even listened to Fumbus's offer of a handful of his best pickled\
  \ grubs. Maybe it was because they were only rats when the moon was full. The rest\
  \ of the time, they were humans, and who could say why humans did anything?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It had all started innocently enough. Fumbus had been making his monthly\
  \ infiltration of the docks, looking for information about Droven—a necessary bit\
  \ of sneakery, ever since the harbormaster had banned him from the docks. He normally\
  \ wouldn't have spent much time searching the wererats' ship, as it was too small\
  \ to have taken Droven to the far-off lands Fumbus imagined the Pathfinder must\
  \ have left for. But they'd been loading barrels full of salt pork, and everyone\
  \ knew salt pork was just pig-pickles. Fumbus hadn't been able to resist stealing\
  \ a taste.</p> \n      <p>When he'd popped the lid, however, there'd been no delicious\
  \ strips of salty pig, only a fine, dusty powder. Fumbus had leaned in to give it\
  \ a sniff, and nearly lost his grip on the side of the barrel as the suddenly overpowering\
  \ scents of bitterbark and redroot stabbed him in the brain. He'd swayed, the world\
  \ going dark and tingly, and then both he and the barrel had been falling sideways.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>When his head eventually cleared, the world was still the wrong way\
  \ around, thanks to the wererat holding him up by his feet. They were inside the\
  \ wererats' ship, the sailors all growing long snouts and fur as they tore through\
  \ Fumbus's pack, yelling about the Harbor Guard and rival gangs and something called\
  \ \"grit.\" He'd tried to make his pickle offer, but the one holding his legs had\
  \ cuffed him so hard he almost passed out again.</p> \n      <p>Now the captain\
  \ threw down his pack and whirled on him, long incisors gleaming yellow in the lantern\
  \ light. He was a big rat, wearing an unnecessarily large number of knives, and\
  \ leaned in so close that Fumbus could smell the wine on his breath.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>\"Who are you working for?\" he demanded. \"Who sent you to spy on our operation?\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"No one!\" Fumbus shook his head hard enough that he almost lost\
  \ his goggles. \"No one sent me!\"</p> \n      <p>\"I don't believe you.\" The captain\
  \ reached down into Fumbus's pack and pulled out a sealed glass vial. He held it\
  \ up, the claws of his free hand digging into Fumbus's cheeks as he yanked the goblin's\
  \ head around to face the potion. \"If you're not working for anyone, who gave you\
  \ these?\"</p> \n      <p>Fumbus squirmed, but there was no escaping the wererat's\
  \ grip. \"Nobody! I made them!\"</p> \n      <p>That drew a surprised laugh from\
  \ everyone present. The captain gave a wide, grotesque grin.</p> \n      <p>\"You\
  \ made these.\" His tone said everything. \"A goblin alchemist.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  It's true!\" From his inverted position, Fumbus glared up at all of them. \"I know\
  \ things—<em>secret</em> things! I brew magic!\"</p> \n      <p>The captain leaned\
  \ back and crossed his arms. \"If you're an alchemist,\" he drawled, holding up\
  \ the vial, \"then what does this one do?\"</p> \n      <p>Fumbus stared for a moment,\
  \ then answered truthfully. \"It makes light. Lots of it. But you have to shake\
  \ it.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Really?\" One eyebrow quirked upward. The wererat pursed\
  \ his lips thoughtfully, then gave the vial a hard shake.</p> \n      <p>Fumbus\
  \ hadn't been lying—that mixture really <em>did</em> make light. And heat. And a\
  \ delicious, smoky smell as both potion and captain exploded into flames.</p> \n\
  \      <p>The wererat holding Fumbus's feet jumped backward, releasing his grip.\
  \ Fumbus hit the deck and rolled, coming up with his pack before the flames could\
  \ set off any more of his concoctions—or worse, boil his pickles.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ an eyeblink, he was up the ladder to the main deck. Sailors shouted and scrambled\
  \ after him, but he dug into his pouches as he ran, coming up with a half-prepared\
  \ starter bottle and a handful of ingredients. With a practiced motion, he jammed\
  \ the reagents into the bottle, judging the right proportions by feel and smell,\
  \ and lobbed it into an open hatch.</p> \n      <p>Fire bloomed beneath the foredeck,\
  \ drawing screams from those trapped below.</p> \n      <p>It wasn't quite enough,\
  \ though. While several sailors raced to douse the flames, others pursued him down\
  \ the gangplank, through the maze of crates waiting to be loaded.</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ considered throwing another fire flask, but already the dock's fire bells were\
  \ tolling. He'd come to like living in Absalom and didn't really want to burn down\
  \ the entire harbor. At least not before Droven came back.</p> \n      <p>He needed\
  \ something different. As he ran, he yanked bottles and pots from his pack, flicking\
  \ open the stoppers to taste each one, trying to find what he needed. Acrid meant\
  \ guano, which was a fine base, but the tangy toadstool juice wouldn't do at all...</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Behind him, filthy claws scraped against Fumbus's pickle-barrel pack\
  \ as the lead rat lunged, just barely missing flesh.</p> \n      <p>In desperation,\
  \ Fumbus upended another flask into his mouth. Its contents fizzed and frothed across\
  \ his tongue.</p> \n      <p>Perfect! Ducking around an assembly of loading carts,\
  \ he withdrew another of his starter bombs, spitting in just the right amount of\
  \ bubbling liquid. With a flick of his flint, he lit the fuse—</p> \n      <p>And\
  \ held it. Here on the docks, everything was too open. But if he could just find\
  \ the right spot...</p> \n      <p>There—a gate in the seawall, opening onto a crowded\
  \ promenade where formerly carousing sailors now gawked at the flames or raced to\
  \ save their ships. Fumbus zagged toward it, skidding past a shocked guard, and\
  \ tossed the flask backward over his shoulder.</p> \n      <p>It exploded in a thick\
  \ cloud of roiling smoke, engulfing the pursuing rats. In that moment of blindness,\
  \ Fumbus ducked between the legs of passing longshanks, disappearing into the crowd.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>He kept running for two more blocks, making sure no rats had followed,\
  \ then turned uphill, clambering up a rain barrel and onto the roof of a sagging\
  \ tavern. From a perch near the chimney, he looked out at the docks, where flames\
  \ now rose from half a dozen ships.</p> \n      <p>Fumbus sighed. Now the harbormaster\
  \ would <em>really</em> never help him find Droven. He'd probably have to avoid\
  \ the whole district for weeks, at least. And it wasn't even his fault! He didn't\
  \ mean for everything to end in fire. It was just something that sometimes happened—\
  like lightning storms or burglary. There was nothing to be done about it.</p> \n\
  \      <p>But he had to admit, it <em>was</em> kind of pretty.</p> \n      <p>Leaning\
  \ back against the chimney, he rested his head against cold bricks and watched the\
  \ flames curl skyward.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>That concludes this series\
  \ of Iconic Encounters. For more short fiction set in the world of Pathfinder, check\
