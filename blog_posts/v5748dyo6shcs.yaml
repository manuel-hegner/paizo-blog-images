  \ \n      <h3>What is Rarity?</h3> \n      <p>Rarity is built into the ground level\
  \ of Pathfinder Second Edition, which makes it very easy to use in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society campaign. The <em>Core Rulebook</em> describes rarity:</p> \n      <blockquote>\
  \ \n       <p>\"If no rarity appears in the traits of an item, spell, or other game\
  \ element, it is of <b>common</b> rarity. <b>Uncommon</b> items are available only\
  \ to those who have special training, grew up in a certain culture, or come from\
  \ a particular part of the world. <b>Rare</b> items are almost impossible to find\
  \ and are usually given out only by the GM, while unique ones are literally one-of-a-kind\
  \ in the game. The GM might alter the way rarity works or change the rarity of individual\
  \ items to suit the story they want to tell.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>It’\
  s important to note that uncommon or rare options are not inherently stronger than\
  \ common ones—<em>talking corpse</em> is no more powerful than other level 4 divination\
  \ spells—just that they might not mesh well with certain story concepts or they\
  \ might require a certain level of GM buy-in. After all, a murder mystery wouldn’\
  t really make sense if anyone in the world knew how to cast <em>talking corpse</em>\
  \ on the victim to ask who the culprit was. </p> \n      <h3>What is Availability?</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>You might notice that the Core Rulebook references the GM in several\
  \ places. Since Pathfinder Society doesn’t have just one GM, the organized play\
  \ team acts as campaign GM, using a system of <b>availability</b> to show what options\
  \ are legal for play. There are three kinds of availability for Pathfinder Society:</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Standard</b>: Standard availability just means that the option’\
  s rarity for Organized Play is unchanged from the rarity printed in its sourcebook.\
  \ If the option is common in the sourcebook, that means it’s common for Pathfinder\
  \ Society, so you can take it as-is (assuming you meet all the usual prerequisites).\
  \ If the option is uncommon in the sourcebook, that means it’s uncommon for Pathfinder\
  \ Society, so you need to gain access to it somehow (see below for more on that!).\
  \ Almost all options are standard availability unless otherwise stated.</p> \n \
  \     <p><b>Limited</b>: Limited availability means that the option won’t be seen\
  \ as often in Society play. If an option is limited, it means that you can’t select\
  \ it unless you have a boon that specifically allows it—even if the option is common\
  \ or if you have access to it. Options are limited if we want to save them for special\
  \ rewards (usually for scenarios with heavy ties to certain regions or factions),\
  \ or if we’re not allowing them in the campaign at this time.</p> \n      <p><b>Restricted</b>:\
  \ A restricted option functions exactly like a limited option—you can’t select it\
  \ unless you have a boon that specifically allows it. The main difference, though,\
  \ is to signal that these options shouldn’t be expected to enter Society play anytime\
  \ soon, either because they don’t make sense for large numbers of players to be\
  \ running around with (such as unique weapons), require above-average amounts of\
  \ GM adjudication (such as the Plot the Future feat, which requires the GM to give\
  \ advice to the player about future actions within the next week), or are outside\
  \ the tone of the shared campaign setting (such as certain evil deities or spells).\
  \ Restricted options usually enter the campaign in small numbers, such as via charity\
  \ boons, if at all.</p> \n      <p>Rather than saying options are allowed or banned,\
  \ as was the case in Pathfinder First Edition, we designate them as standard or\
  \ limited/restricted instead. This helps to keep everything working within the same\
  \ rarity system as used in all other Pathfinder products, and it also makes it easier\
  \ for us to allow options later down the line if things change. </p> <a href=\"\

  \      <h3>Gaining Access to Uncommon Options</h3> \n      <p>So, what should I\
  \ do if I want to use an uncommon option for my Pathfinder Society character? There\
  \ are five main ways to gain access:</p> \n      <ol type=\"1\"> \n       <li><b>Automatic\
  \ Access</b>: Pathfinder Society players gain automatic access to a variety of options—\
  such as the kobold ancestry, the vigilante archetype, or Pathfinder-specific equipment\
  \ like the wayfinder—just by being part of the Pathfinder Society! Check the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options\"\
  >Character Options Blog</a> to see if you already have access to the option you\
  \ want to take.</li> \n       <li><b>Character Origin</b>: Just like in non-Society\
  \ play, your character’s backstory—such as their ethnicity, region of origin, or\
  \ any groups they belong to—might give them access to certain options. </li> \n\
  \       <li><b>Player Options</b>: Some common feats, ancestries, classes, or the\
  \ like can grant you access to uncommon options further down the line. For instance,\
  \ the dragon disciple archetype is uncommon, but if you’re a dragon instinct barbarian\
  \ or a draconic bloodline sorcerer, you gain access. Similarly, many uncommon ancestral\
  \ weapons, such as gnome flickmaces or elven curve blades, can be accessed with\
  \ common ancestry feats. </li> \n       <li><b>Achievement Points (AcP) Purchase</b>:\
  \ Achievement Points earned by playing and GMing games can be used to purchase access\
  \ to uncommon or rare options. You can check the total AcP you’ve unlocked for Pathfinder\
  \ Society (2e) and the boons available to purchase by <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount\"\
  >signing in to your My Organized Play account</a> and going to the “Boons” tab.\
  \ This is also the main way to select an uncommon ancestry or heritage.</li> \n\
  \       <li><b>Adventure Unlocks</b>: Lastly, boon unlocks from completing certain\
  \ adventures or achieving Faction goals grant access to thematically related uncommon\
  \ or rare options. In Year 1, these boons were located on the Chronicle Sheet of\
  \ each adventure, but moving forward into the future, you’ll now find these boons\
  \ in the same place as those purchasable with AcP on the “Boons” tab of your My\
  \ Organized Play page.<p></p> </li>\n      </ol> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n \
  \     <p>It’s important to note that, while you can use these methods to gain access\
  \ to many uncommon options, not all options yet have a way to gain access to them.\
  \ Many of these are things we’re waiting for the right adventure to give out as\
  \ a reward; for instance, it seems underwhelming to grant access to a Baba Yaga\
  \ feat or a Jatembe spell without interacting with Irrisen or the Magaambya in some\
  \ way to learn these legendary techniques. </p> \n      <p>As the campaign’s ongoing\
  \ storyline progresses and evolves, the actions of you, the players, will also influence\
  \ what is made available in the Pathfinder Society campaign. Be sure to report your\
  \ scenarios and check any boxes—after all, your successes and choices can shape\
  \ the world of Golarion, and with it, the options your characters can find within\
  \ it!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
