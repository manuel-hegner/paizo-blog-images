  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> has produced a huge number of great adventures\
  \ over the years, but few can compare to series <a href=\"/products/btpy8gtt\"><em>Eyes\
  \ of the Ten</em></a>, a four-part extravaganza of high-level play and dire revelations\
  \ about the Society and its enemies. Just ask any veteran of the campaign. When\
  \ <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> survivors meet up at conventions, they excitedly swap\
  \ stories of \"Here's how we handled this faction mission,\" \"We saved that NPC\
  \ by doing this,\" and \"Yeah, that monster nearly ended us—twice.\" A lot of that\
  \ excitement comes from the powerful story and wild destinations, but a big share\
  \ of the exhilaration comes from something we do all too rarely in Pathfinder Society:\
  \ play high-level characters. In fact, nearly 5 years have passed since the last\
  \ installment of <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> released. In that time the campaign has\
  \ included a few higher-level opportunities in interactive specials and sanctioned\
  \ high-level printed adventures, but the organized play program hasn't really published\
  \ more high-level content that it can call its own.</p> \n    <p>In Season 7 we\
  \ want to change that. We've assembled an all-star team of writers for our new three-part\
  \ Seeker arc <em>All for Immortality</em>, which debuts this April. As in <em>Eyes\
  \ of the Ten</em>, this new story takes the PCs to exciting new locations, many\
  \ of which I've always wanted to visit but could never justify in a lower-level\
  \ adventure. Likewise, you'll clash with powerful villains we dared not face before\
  \ and deal a powerful blow to some of the Society's oldest enemies. The action begins\
  \ in Thuvia with <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9k93/\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>\
  \ by veteran organized play author Thurston Hillman. Now that the secret's out,\
  \ you'll see the product page appear soon.</p> \n    <p>Let's talk some numbers.\
  \ First, this is a three-part series, and we're not going to make you wait a whole\
  \ season to experience the story; expect #7-26 (Part 2) in June and #7-29 (Part\
  \ 3) in July, following a brief hiatus to manage <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>\
  \ releases in May. Second, we're aware that it can be tough to schedule <em>Eyes\
  \ of the Ten</em> because it requires PCs to have exactly 33 XP. That's a necessary\
  \ restriction for a series written with only one character level in mind, but it\
  \ would be so much easier for players and organizers if we treated this more like\
  \ standard scenarios, right? After all, I imagine many players would love to play\
  \ both Seeker arcs with the same character. With that in mind, I'm happy to announce\
  \ that all three <em>All for Immortality</em> adventures are Tier 12-15 (Subtiers\
  \ 12-13 and 14-15).</p> \n    <p>Finally, there's one additional date that you should\
  \ remember: April 6th! That Wednesday, Tonya and I will be joining Ryan and Perram\
  \ on the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">Know Direction\
  \ Podcast</a> to discuss this—including the other adventures' titles, authors, and\
  \ destinations—share news about upcoming conventions, and answer your questions.\
  \ Join us!</p> \n    <p>Also, check back here next week for some long-anticipated\
  \ sanctioned material for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n    <p>John\
