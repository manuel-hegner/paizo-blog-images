              <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! As the beginning of the Year of Boundless Wonder approaches in August, we wanted to let you know about the changes coming to the Pathfinder Society program. Aside from the updates in this blog, we don’t have any other rule changes or alterations to the program planned; this year should be quieter on that front, rather than the radical changes we’ve had in previous years.</p>

              <h2>Achievement Points</h2>
              <p>We’re aware that achievement points and GM credits are still not being awarded correctly (or at all, in most cases). Tech is aware of the problem and is currently reviewing the code to fix this issue. Once it’s fixed, you won’t have to do anything but refresh your points to fix the errors. Achievement Points can still be spent currently. We hope to have good news on this front very soon!</p>
              <p>At the end of May, we also announced that we would be awarding every player a starting player grant of&nbsp;80 Achievement Points&nbsp;for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society. You may use these points to unlock an uncommon ancestry, other fun uncommon options, or just as a cushion for a couple of resurrections should your low-level character meet with an untimely critical hit. The aforementioned issues with Achievement Points are also blocking this grant for a small number of users, but that should be fixed shortly as well.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>Ancestry Boon Changes</h2>
              <p>With the start of Year 4 comes new adventurers! We’re pleased to announce some updates to the price of ancestry boons based on the Society’s adventurers.</p>
              <p>As a result of the Society’s efforts on the Shadow Plane this season, the&nbsp;Fetchling Ancestry&nbsp;boon price will be reduced to&nbsp;40 Achievement Points. Additionally, additional recruitment in Oprak means that the&nbsp;Hobgoblin Ancestry&nbsp;boon price will be reduced to&nbsp;80 Achievement Points. Finally, the price of the&nbsp;Catfolk Ancestry&nbsp;boon will also be reduced to&nbsp;80 Achievement Points. We don’t have a great in-story reason for this last adjustment, but we wanted to bring this boon in line with similar uncommon ancestries from the Mwangi Expanse.</p>
              <p>All of these changes will take effect on&nbsp;July 29, 2022, in preparation for the launch of Pathfinder Society Year 4 at Gen Con the following week.</p>
              <p>With that, I’ll turn it over to Mike to talk about some new boons coming to the boon store!</p>
              <p>Hello, Pathfinders! Thinking of making a new character? Want to tie your character to recent events in Pathfinder Society adventures? We’ve got seven new backgrounds, each of which reflects some sort of connection to recent and ongoing Pathfinder Society plots. You don’t need to play a specific adventure to earn the backgrounds—they’re open to everyone, for the price of 4 Achievement Points each. Maybe you’ll want to pick up one of these backgrounds because you enjoyed a Year 3 plot and want to have a character tied to that plot, or because you’re about to play some Year 3 content and want to give your character an even stronger connection to that content before playing it. Or maybe you just think it sounds cool!</p>
              <p>You’ll find the text of these boons behind the spoiler tags below. (They don’t contain heavy spoilers for the events of any adventures.) Enjoy!</p>
