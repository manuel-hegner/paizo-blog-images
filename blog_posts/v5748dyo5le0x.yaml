  \ <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Last wednesday marked the release of Dave Gross's\
  \ new Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a>!\
  \ Starring his trademark characters Radovan and Jeggare, <i>Queen of Thorns</i>\
  \ takes the half-elven Pathfinder and his hellspawn bodyguard deep into the isolated\
  \ forest kingdom of Kyonin, where long-lived elves spin political webs longer than\
  \ human lifespans and demons struggle to expand their foothold in the mortal realm.\
  \ We took a few moments to ask Dave questions about his newest novel and the writing\
  \ process.</span></p> \n    <p><b>What inspired <i>Queen of Thorns</i>? Radovan\
  \ and Jeggare have obviously been around for several years now, but how did you\
  \ come up with the other characters and plot for this particular novel?</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>In all the R&amp;J novels, I first think of what aristocratic characters\
  \ Jeggare can meet, and then what low-lifes Radovan can rub elbows with—not that\
  \ it’s a good idea to rub elbows with Radovan. So the first character I knew I wanted\
  \ to include was Queen Telandia.</p> \n    <p>After that, I wanted to show that\
  \ elves aren’t all the same, so I chose one who represented the goddess Calistria\
  \ (Kemeili), another who is the epitome of a ranger (Caladrel), and a third who\
  \ was an outcast among her own people because she grew up among humans (Oparal).\
  \ Then, because gnomes are a small but important element of Kyonin’s population,\
  \ I included Fimbulthicket.</p> \n    <p>After thinking of the types of elves and\
  \ gnome I wanted, I considered what each of them might want under the circumstances\
  \ that I imagined Kyonin faced. That’s how the plot began to take root.</p> \n \
  \   <p>I knew from the start that I wanted this to be a quest for the truth behind\
  \ Jeggare’s enigmatic past. I’ve dropped some hints about both his mother and father,\
  \ but he grew up among her people, and the elves remained largely a mystery to him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>At the same time, I want to make each novel equally about Radovan, and\
  \ since Kyonin is infested with demons, I knew it was time to make a great big revelation\
  \ about Radovan’s true nature. Thus, both characters ultimately face themselves\
  \ before the end of the book.</p> \n    <p><b>What part of <i>Queen of Thorns</i>\
  \ was the most fun to write? What was the hardest?</b></p> \n    <p>Pretty much\
  \ any of the nude scenes was huge fun, because I find nudity not only sexy but also\
  \ hilarious, especially when Radovan is the one who’s naked. But really any of the\
  \ humorous exchanges, the quarrels, the misunderstandings are all great fun to write.\
  \ I can’t say that the novel is a comedy, but there’s certainly plenty of humor\
  \ in it, and that’s some of the easiest and most fun material to write.</p> \n \
  \   <p>While I enjoy writing action scenes, I’ve written so damned many of the things\
  \ that sometimes I just stare helplessly at the blank Word screen in hopes that\
  \ my forehead will begin to bleed and I can come up with something different from\
  \ all the fight scenes I’ve written before. Sometimes that’s just not possible,\
  \ but I can tilt the action slightly so it seems fresh even though I’ve done similar\
  \ fights in past. I need to make it fresh for me or else I can’t imagine it’ll seem\
  \ fresh to other readers.</p> \n    <p><b>Other than Radovan and Jeggare, which\
  \ character in this book is your favorite?</b></p> \n    <p>This is extremely difficult\
  \ to answer because each of the major supporting characters was my favorite at one\
  \ time or another. Kemeili was an early favorite because of her sass and volatility.\
  \ Caladrel grew on me a lot more than I’d initially expected, because he’s such\
  \ a \"bro\" compared with the odd-couple of Radovan and the count. Fimbulthicket\
  \ always delighted me because of his unusual condition and because of his connection\
  \ to the Green as a druid. In the end, I think Oparal is the character I grew most\
  \ fond of, both because her struggle is often the hardest on her and because even\
  \ when she’s wrong, she’s right—which makes more sense after you read what she goes\
  \ through.</p> \n    <p><b>Complete this sentence: \"This will be your favorite\
  \ Pathfinder Tales novel if...\"</b></p> \n    <p>\"...if you like elves, gnomes,\
  \ demons, fey creatures, ancient archeological sites, and gigantic revelations about\
  \ the main characters.\"</p> \n    <p><b>What do you find most interesting about\
  \ Kyonin, the book's setting?</b></p> \n    <p>While we give each other a hard time,\
  \ James Sutter and I have massively overlapping tastes. He wrote the Kyonin article\
  \ that formed the bulk of my \"research\" on this novel, and it’s because I loved\
  \ that material so much that I so desperately wanted to set a story in Kyonin. Again,\
  \ it’s hard to point to a single thing, but the element of Kyonin that most appeals\
  \ to me is that the elves abandoned the place and came back thousands of years later.\
  \ There’s stuff in the forest they don’t even remember, and other stuff they’ve\
  \ forgotten how to use. To them it’s as dangerous as it is potentially useful—even\
  \ moreso to outsiders like Varian and Radovan.</p> \n    <p><b>What makes elven\
  \ society so different from human society, and how did you go about trying to show\
  \ that in this book?</b></p> \n    <p>I think the key to most non-human species\
  \ in Golarion or any fantasy setting is that they are—let’s not kid ourselves—basically\
  \ human. Otherwise we couldn’t sympathize with them the way we need to do. But elves\
  \ and dwarves and gnomes all emphasize certain elements of human characteristics.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One way—surely not the only way—to look at the elves is through the gods\
  \ they worship. Some are devoted to the Green, or nature. Others worship Desna,\
  \ who Count Jeggare sees as the Tender of Dreams while Radovan calls her Lady Luck.\
  \ But the god most often associated with the elves is Calistria, with her three\
  \ aspects or \"stings\": guile, lust, and revenge. While the inquisitor Kemeili\
  \ is the one most obviously associated with the goddess, you also see Calistria’\
  s \"stings\" in most of the other elven characters. The exception is the paladin\
  \ Oparal, who grew up away from her people and who has adopted a different set of\
  \ values.</p> \n    <p>Showing off the lust aspect is easy, since elves are often\
  \ seen as sexual creatures. The guile is also pretty familiar to readers who think\
  \ of elves as stealthy rangers or subtle thinkers. The revenge element seems a little\
  \ unusual for the elves of other settings, but I kept it in mind until the last\
  \ few chapters of the novel.</p> \n    <p><b><i>Queen of Thorns</i> has a dragon\
  \ as a key character—how do you go about writing a \"monstrous\" character, especially\
  \ one so old and powerful?</b></p> \n    <p>I suppose I tried to do a little of\
  \ that through description, but mostly I relied on dialogue and the reaction of\
  \ other characters to her. Rough and tough as he is, Radovan doesn’t usually scare\
  \ easy, but he’s sure he’s one wrong word away from death every time he talks to\
  \ the dragon.</p> \n    <p>Of course, when the fighting starts, what a dragon is\
  \ able to do against dozens or even hundreds of opponents is pretty terrifying.\
  \ Unfortunately for her, she’s got a lot more than hundreds to deal with, and ultimately\
  \ I don’t think she’s the scariest presence in the book, although she’s darned close.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>If you could have Radovan and Jeggare fight or fall in love with any\
  \ character from another author's Pathfinder Tales novel, who would it be and why?</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>I look forward to the day when Radovan meets Ellasif from Elaine’s Winter\
  \ Witch. I don’t think it’ll go well for him whether it’s a fight or a frolic. Jeggare\
  \ might have an interesting relationship with Howard’s Elyanna, but I doubt it would\
  \ be romantic. She’s not aristocratic enough for him, and I imagine he’s far too\
  \ snooty for her. If they fought, she’d win in any physical contest, but I have\
  \ a feeling he might outsmart her.</p> \n    <p><b>If you had to pick actors to\
  \ play the main characters of Queen of Thorns, who would they be?</b></p> \n   \
  \ <p>After musing over deceased actors like Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, I’\
  ve turned toward Michael Fassbender as the man who should play Count Jeggare. It’\
  s more difficult choosing an actor for Radovan. For attitude, I like Stephen Graham\
  \ (Al Capone in <i>Boardwalk Empire</i>), but for presence I like Vic Wertz’s suggestion\
  \ of Ray Stevenson, even though he’s about a foot too tall.</p> \n    <p>Meg Chambers\
  \ Steedle (<i>Boardwalk Empire</i>) would make an interesting Kemeili. Jeffrey Donovan\
  \ (<i>Burn Notice</i>) for Caladrel. Gina Carano (<i>Haywire</i>) is Oparal. Maybe\
  \ a digitally reduced Giovanni Ribisi (<i>Avatar</i>) as Fimbulthicket. Arnisant,\
  \ of course, would play himself.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Check out <i>Queen\
