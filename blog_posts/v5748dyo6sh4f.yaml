  \   </div> \n      <p>We covered lots of recent announcements, including those of\
  \ the first <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3w?February-Update-Achievement-Points-Stars#discuss\"\
  ></a> and the addition of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh42?Organized-Play-New-Faces-New-Places#discuss\"\
  ></a> to the team as our Organized Play Associate. We talked about <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3i?Starfinder-Society-Sanctioning-Update#discuss\"\
  ></a> and our expectation that we would announce future sanctioning at the beginning\
  \ of a month. We also noted we updated the Regional Support Program for 2020 and\
  \ that the program would function as it had in prior years. Thurston previewed the\
  \ last few scenarios coming out in April and May (we will get product pages up for\
  \ them soon): </p> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n       <li><i>SFS\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>We also previewed the awesome art for the newest Starfinder\
  \ Society spaceship – The Gorgon! This piece of art will be added to the ships portion\
  \ of the Guide for Year 3. At this point, we intend the guide remain a printable\
  \ pdf download, as we haven’t resolved the bugs on the Pathfinder (second edition)\
  \ guide and don’t want to swap Starfinder Society assets until we have solved the\
  \ issues. This news also applies to Achievement Points (AcP) for Starfinder Soceity.\
  \ Thurston, Linda, and I keep evaluating the situation and will announce changes\
  \ to either guides or AcP in our Thursday blogs. After meeting with internal stakeholders,\
  \ we decided to move the Org Play blogs to Thursday to help workflow for Org Play\
  \ teammembers. There may be days where this slips, but our plan involves posting\
  \ most Org Play blogs on Thursdays (or sometimes even twice on Thursday!)</p> \n\
  \      <p>Before I turn the blog over to Thurston for an in-depth dive into Year\
  \ 3, I want to once more amplify the call for volunteers that the Organized Play\
  \ Foundation made last week. Offering games means lots of GMS/HQ volunteers and\
  \ we still have spaces available for all the major conventions. You can find a list\
  \ of rewards and the volunteer applications on the <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/convention-volunteer-information/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Organized Play Foundation website</a> or in last week’s <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh43?Organized-Play-Foundation-Call-for-Volunteers#discuss\"\
  ></a> blog.</p> \n      <p>See you next week for previews of our montly Society\
  \ releases!</p> \n      <p>Until then – Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     \
  \ <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Tonya Woldridge<br> <em>Organized\
  \ Play Manager</em></p> \n      <hr> \n      <p>Drumroll please! The Organized Play\
  \ Team is proud to announce the title of Year 3… The Year of Exploration’s Edge.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>After two years of epic space operate fantasy in the Scoured Stars,\
  \ followed by then our current year of battling against a social media smear campaign\
  \ organized by a now rather infamous NPC, our third season (Technically forth, since\
  \ Season 1 spanned two years) takes us to new frontiers. Exploration’s Edge is about\
  \ getting back to basics as Starfinders and focusing on things that are at the heart\
  \ of what it means to be a Starfinder. Obviously, exploring sites both old and new\
  \ is paramount to the theme of this new season, but there’s a few other key elements\
  \ changing in Exploration’s Edge, so let’s take a look!</p> \n      <p>First off,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh1x?Starfinder-Society-Year-3-Preview-A-New-First\"\
  >as previously announced on our Twitch stream and in a blog</a>, Year 3 opens with\
  \ a new First Seeker. Ehu Hadif guides the Society into its next phase of missions,\
  \ and as someone focused on ensuring that the Society gets back to its roots of\
  \ discovery and research, Ehu really drives a lot of this upcoming year’s core concepts.\
  \ Along with a variety of faction missions associated with Ehu Hadif, the upcoming\
  \ Starfinder Society Guide includes a new Second Seekers faction that provides all\
  \ the boons and bonuses necessary to really champion the cause of the Society’s\
  \ new leader. We’re looking forward to all the new (and old) characters who take\
  \ up Ehu Hadif’s cause.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092519_Eho.jpg\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>Next up, let’s talk metaplot. Over the course of our\
  \ first two years of Starfinder Society, it has been clear that there’s a lot of\
  \ players who’ve really enjoyed the expansive metaplots that weave their way through\
  \ many scenarios, but just as many players like the episodic nature of the Starfinder\
  \ Society. To change things up, we’re pumping the breaks on having one large overarching\
  \ metaplot and are going to take this opportunity to try something a bit different.\
  \ With the season focus of exploration lending itself much more to “missions of\
  \ the month” rather than an expansive story, our plan for this season isn’t to have\
  \ a single metaplot, but instead break things down into several multi-part scenario\
  \ series. </p> \n      <p> Past multi-part stories needed playing in the order published\
  \ to really participate in the story and we named them as such, for instance <i>PFS\
  \ 10-22</i> and <i>10-23: Passing the Torch</i> series, which had a Part 1 and Part\
  \ 2. For Year 3, the arcs are more thematically tied together than an A/B/C structure.\
  \ They actually won’t be numbered by part. Instead, we structured the titles SFS\
  \ 03-XX: Arc Title: Scenario Title. For organizers, this means you can schedule\
  \ them in any order!</p> \n      <p>The Year of Exploration’s Edge will include\
  \ three storyline arcs, each spread across a variety of levels, but most easily\
  \ explained as low-level, mid-level, and (excitement) high-level story arcs. Without\
  \ giving too much away on each of the story arcs, here’s a brief summary of what\
  \ to expect:</p> \n      <p><b>Low-Level Arc (Tiers 1-4 + 3-6):</b> What’s exciting\
  \ about this story arc is that it’s predominantly going to be Tier 1-4 scenarios,\
  \ making it the perfect onboarding series of adventures for new players. For our\
  \ veterans looking to start up a new character, this arc is also going to be our\
  \ first real deep dive into the worlds of Near Space, with some heavy influence\
  \ by the Veskarium. With <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zud?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Near Space</i></a> just around the bend, this seemed like the perfect\
  \ opportunity to really dive into this part of the galaxy.</p> \n      <p><b>Mid-Level\
  \ Arc (Tiers 5-8 + 7-10):</b> The mid-range of levels in Starfinder is where exploration\
  \ into the unknown can really start to pay off in terms of narrative options, so\
  \ this arc was the perfect opportunity to explore the Vast. However, in order to\
  \ better coordinate with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0225g?Starfinder-RPG-Starship-Operations-Manual\"\
  >a certain upcoming product</a>, one of the main goals for this story arc is to\
  \ have the Society work alongside a corporation to test out a potential new starship\
  \ hull. This also presents us with the exciting opportunity to use our Chronicle\
  \ sheets to give PCs wider customization options for starships, and determine potential\
  \ future designs used by the Starfinder Society!</p> \n      <p><b>High-Level Arc\
  \ (Tiers 9-12 + 11-14):</b> Though not the highest levels of the Starfinder RPG\
  \ (we’re getting there), this arc is roughly the highest reaches most of our dedicated\
  \ players will have PCs in the level range of—barring all your dedicated Adventure\
  \ Path players out there! For our high-level story arc, we wanted to look back at\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds\">Pact\
  \ Worlds</a>, in particular some loose threads first seeded in early Season 1 and\
  \ involving the Society’s past actions. With Hellknights on the prowl and a journey\
  \ that goes from Verces to Eox, what else could be missing? Well, there’s one particular\
  \ planet in the Pact Worlds star system we haven’t visited yet. Specifically, there’\
  s a certain far-flung planetoid that might be utterly inhospitable to all but the\
  \ highest-level characters... hopefully you’ll be ready to go there.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>OK, so with all the fancy announcements about what’s happening in the Year\
  \ of Exploration’s Edge, there’s one final topic to discuss today: the opening interactive\
  \ special. Starfinder Society #3-00: The Last Bite, brings the story of Year of\
  \ a Thousand Bites to climactic conclusion and serves as the opener to our third\
  \ year. This Tier 1-8 interactive special has the PCs taking part in one last mission\
  \ for outgoing First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo, working as a team to thwart the machinations\
  \ of the mischievous ysoki known as Datch. Written by longtime Paizo author Jenny\
  \ Jarzabski, this interactive is sure to have the PCs at the edge of their seats\
  \ as they race to stop Datch from enacting her greatest scheme yet: plunging one\
  \ of the Pact Worlds’ paramount institutions into chaos. Given the more “personal\
  \ scope” of this year’s interactive, we opted to really focus on a set of Subtiers,\
  \ making it easier on those GMs running our interactives. We hope the upcoming Season\
  \ 3 high-level content accommodates those of you players out there who want to get\
  \ your players gaming right away!</p> \n      <p>Come see us at upcoming events,\
  \ where we can talk more about future plans for the Starfinder Society. Until then,\
  \ let the hype for the Year of Exploration’s Edge begin!</p> \n      <p>Signing\
  \ off for now,</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Thurston\
