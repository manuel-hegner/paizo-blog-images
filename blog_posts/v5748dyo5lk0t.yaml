  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As Season 8 of the Pathfinder Society winds\
  \ down and we prepare to launch three new seasons of organized play at Gen Con 50,\
  \ it's time to say thank you to some of the folks who make our games and programs\
  \ fantastic. Whether you are a dedicated GM, running games in your community every\
  \ week, or a convention organizer, who puts together the large shows, your efforts\
  \ are seen and appreciated. We cannot have a community our size (84,000 players\
  \ and growing) without having the volunteers to support it. To all of you, our team\
  \ sends kudos and thanks.</p> \n     <h2>5 Star GMs</h2> \n     <p>For some of our\
  \ GMs, they hit the milestone of running 150 games, with 10 of them being specials.\
  \ These 150 games must be include at least 50 unique scenarios, so they cannot just\
  \ run the same thing over and over. They spend countless hours in preparation and\
  \ deliver a gaming to their needs. I wish to recognize the following individuals\
  \ for achieving the top goal in the GM recognition program.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>Joseph Blomquist<br> Janice Piette<br> Daniel Pink<br> Hjal Nelson<br>\
  \ Carol Tierney<br> Tom Mannering<br> Zrinka Znidarcic</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h2>Campaign Service Coins</h2> \n     <p>Some of our volunteers go above\
  \ and beyond the expectations of the role they fill. These volunteers usually organize\
  \ some portion of organized play. A common belief is that recipients must be part\
  \ of the Venture-Officer team. This is not the case, though many of those achieving\
  \ the campaign coin recognition do belong to the venture corps. If you know an individual\
  \ deserving of acknowledgement for their efforts in promoting organized play in\
  \ your area, please <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">email me</a> and\
  \ tell me why.</p> \n     <p>Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity\
  \ to award campaign coins to the following individuals. I've listed their new Organized\
  \ Play number as well as the convention they received their recognition at. There\
  \ are two redacted names on the list. We announced them at PaizoCon and their Regional\
  \ Venture-Coordinator will award the coins to them in person. I don't want to spoil\
  \ the surprise their receipt will bring, so I'm holding off on announcing the names\
  \ until the recipient receives the coin.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Alison\
  \ Ooms—777—Who's Yer Con<br> Chad Newman—778—Origins<br> [Reacted]—779—PaizoCon\
  \ UK<br> [Redacted]—780—PaizoCon UK<br> Nils Janson—781—PaizoCon UK<br> Ian Hawthorne—\
  782—PaizoCon UK</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Three cheers for these hardworking\
  \ individuals. Hip, hip, huzzah!!!</p> \n     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Though\
  \ the summer convention season reaches the peak at Gen Con, that doesn't mean the\
  \ end of conventions to attend. Starting with GardenCon and MegaMoose this weekend,\
  \ we never truly slow down. Those conventions after August 17th may contain a Starfinder\
  \ component as well as Pathfinder Society RPG and ACG, as we launch the newest organized\
  \ play campaign.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"callout-block\" style=\"\
