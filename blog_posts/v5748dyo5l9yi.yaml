  \ of a Kline</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 12, 2008</p> \n   <p>Otis\
  \ Adelbert Kline, author of <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\">The Swordsman\
  \ of Mars</a></i>, is probably the author with the least name recognition on our\
  \ current schedule.</p> \n   <p>And that's on purpose. You see, once upon a time,\
  \ before we realized that we could actually <i>get</i> folks like <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8c\"\
  >Michael Moorcock</a>, Piers Anthony, and <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8b\"\
  >Robert E. Howard</a>, we set our sights on trying to bring back, not just the best\
  \ authors of the genre, but the best <i>forgotten</i> authors. Yet once we opened\
  \ our doors, we discovered a veritable horde of high-quality, big-name authors who'd\
  \ been languishing out of print. As the roster started filling up with giants—both\
  \ the folks I've already mentioned and people like <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdo\"\
  >C. L. Moore</a>, the first female sword-and-sorcery author, or <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\"\
  >Leigh Brackett</a>, who wrote the first draft of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>—\
  I began to wonder if there was indeed still a place in readers' hearts for Otis\
  \ Adelbert Kline. Then I sent the manuscript out to our typist, who's retyped all\
  \ the old books in our line, from Moorcock to Howard. Shortly thereafter I received\
  \ the typed manuscript along with a simple note saying:</p> \n   <p>\"This one was\
  \ my favorite by far!\" </p>\n   <p>And why shouldn't it be? Though these days he's\
  \ best known as the literary agent for Robert E. Howard and supposed rival of Edgar\
  \ Rice Burroughs, at the height of the pulp era Kline was nearly as big a name as\
  \ Howard and Burroughs himself. Though Kline's famous feud with Burroughs—in which\
  \ Burroughs would publish a Mars book so Kline would publish a Venus one, prompting\
  \ Burroughs to publish a Venus one, which in turn forced Kline to respond with a\
  \ Mars saga, etc.—turns out to have been entirely the creation of imaginative fans,\
  \ there can be no doubt that the two authors shared both style and subject matter.\
  \ Indeed, Kline has frequently been called Burroughs's only true competitor. While\
  \ he produced only a handful of novels before his death at the age of 55, Kline's\
  \ presence on the original editorial staff of <i>Weird Tales</i> and his sword-swinging\
  \ romances on the red and green planets did much to influence the genre, and his\
  \ legacy lives on in the tradition of sword and planet novels to this day.</p> \n\
  \   <p>So will our grand experiment work? Can we fulfill the promise we made to\
  \ our readers, not just to give them fun, historically significant works of fantasy\
  \ and science fiction, but to give them great stories that they've <i>never heard\
  \ of before?</i> Are today's audiences open to the Burroughsian derring-do of characters\
  \ like Harry Thorne, the swashbuckling, Depression-era dynamo sent to the Red Planet\
  \ in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\">The Swordsman of Mars</a></i>?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Buckle your seatbelts, folks. We're about to find out.</p> \n   <p> James\
  \ Sutter <br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Planet\
