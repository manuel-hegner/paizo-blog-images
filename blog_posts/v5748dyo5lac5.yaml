  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Let me tell you a little\
  \ story.</p> \n   <p>For months now, stories were spreading about brutal attacks\
  \ made against merchant caravans making their way through the Mindspin Mountains.\
  \ While not uncommon during this time of year, the savagery of the attacks and the\
  \ reports of a giant man, bedecked with ice, caught Harsk's attention. Not a week\
  \ later, Harsk was high up the mountains, casting about for a trail. He had already\
  \ encountered a pair of slaughtered caravans, when he found one that was recently\
  \ attacked. Fresh boot prints in the snow confirmed his suspicions. It was a frost\
  \ giant. For two days he followed the trail without fault, leading deeper into the\
  \ mountains before ending at the mouth of a deep, dark cave. Sneaking inside, the\
  \ wily dwarf quickly found his prey, sorting through a vast pile of ill-gotten loot.\
  \ The giant had no idea that death had come for him as Harsk took aim with his trusted\
  \ crossbow.</p> \n   <p>This is the sort of situation a ranger like Harsk dreams\
  \ of. Having caught the giant in a cave, he has immense bonuses against the behemoth.\
  \ Using his favored terrain bonuses, Harsk received a +2 on all Survival skill checks\
  \ when tracking the giant through the mountains. In the caves (which count as underground),\
  \ this bonus increases to a +4. It also applies to his initiative (giving him a\
  \ great chance at going first), Perception, and Stealth checks. His favored enemy\
  \ bonuses against giants of +6 applies to Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive,\
  \ and Survival checks made against the giant, but more importantly, it applies to\
  \ his attack and damage rolls. Added up, these bonuses give him a +32 bonus on Survival\
  \ checks to track the giant in the caves (+30 in the mountains) and a +28 to avoid\
  \ being spotted as he sneaks up to within 30 feet for the attack.</p> \n   <p>Assuming\
  \ Harsk gets the drop on the giant, he can use Pinpoint Targeting during the surprise\
  \ round to ensure he gets a hit. This feat allows him to make a single attack as\
  \ a standard action that ignores armor, natural armor, and shield bonuses to AC\
  \ (which drops the giant's AC down to 8). If he wins initiative, he can then take\
  \ a full attack against the giant. Using Deadly Aim (which allows him to take a\
  \ –3 penalty on attack rolls to gain a +6 bonus on damage rolls, just like Power\
  \ Attack but for ranged weapons), his bonus on these attacks comes out to +19/+19/+14/+9\
  \ with each attack dealing 1d8+14 plus 1d6 electricity and 2d6 from the <i>axiomatic</i>\
  \ quality. If Harsk hits with all 4 attacks (and the surprise attack, which deals\
  \ a little less damage), his average damage is around 138 points of damage, which\
  \ is just enough to put the giant in his grave.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>If Harsk\
  \ really wanted to ensure success, he would denote the giant as his quarry before\
  \ combat begins. This ability is gained at 11th level and it allows a ranger to\
  \ select a creature that matches one of his favored enemy types as his quarry, granting\
  \ him a +2 bonus on attack rolls and automatically confirming all critical hits\
  \ against the target. He can also take 10 on Survival checks to track his quarry\
  \ while moving at full speed without penalty. Although Harsk can have no more than\
  \ one quarry at a time, he can select a new quarry 1 hour after his previous quarry\
  \ is slain.</p> \n   <p>Now, this is not exactly a fair fight, as Harsk is built\
  \ to kill giants in caves, but rangers are built to excel in specific circumstances.\
  \ Against other enemies or in other environments, they are still capable combatants,\
  \ but they really shine when hunting their favored enemies or while adventuring\
  \ in their favored terrain.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>Harsk also possesses the hunter's\
  \ bond class feature, which allows him to grant any allies within 30 feet half of\
  \ his favored enemy bonus against one foe as a move action. Once given, this bonus\
  \ lasts for 3 rounds. He could have taken an animal companion instead, but we will\
  \ discuss those in more detail during the druid preview. For now, remember that\
  \ if Harsk were to take an animal companion, his effective druid level would be\
  \ 8th (not 5th, as it was in 3.5).</p> \n   <p>In addition, Harsk has a few spells\
  \ to aid him in his struggles. He now casts spells with a caster level equal to\
  \ his ranger level –3 (instead of half his ranger level). His progression has also\
  \ been improved a bit, giving him a few extra spells. Of special note is <i>summon\
  \ nature's ally III</i>, which allows him to summon a boar, a wolverine, or even\
  \ 1d3 Small earth elementals. Take a look at the following lists for more examples\
  \ (some might even say this was a sneak peak at the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy85k5\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>).</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>1st level</b></p>\n\
  \    <blockquote>\n      Dire Rat\n     <br> Dolphin\n     <br> Eagle\n     <br>\
  \ Giant Centipede\n     <br> Fire Beetle\n     <br> Mite\n     <br> Poisonous Frog\n\
  \     <br> Pony (horse)\n     <br> Riding Dog\n     <br> Stirge\n     <br> Viper\
  \ (snake)\n     <br>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p></p> \n    <p><b>2nd Level</b></p>\n\
  \    <blockquote>\n      Ant, Drone\n     <br> Elemental (Small)\n     <br> Goblin\
  \ Dog\n     <br> Horse\n     <br> Hyena\n     <br> Octopus\n     <br> Squid\n  \
  \   <br> Wolf\n     <br>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p></p> \n    <p><b>3rd Level</b></p>\n\
  \    <blockquote>\n      Ant, Soldier\n     <br> Ape\n     <br> Aurochs (herd animal)\n\
  \     <br> Boar\n     <br> Cheetah\n     <br> Constrictor Snake\n     <br> Crocodile\n\
  \     <br> Dire Bat\n     <br> Electric Eel\n     <br> Giant Crab\n     <br> Giant\
  \ Lizard\n     <br> Leopard (Cat)\n     <br> Shark\n     <br> Wolverine\n     <br>\n\
  \    </blockquote>\n    <p></p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Harsk has a few other\
  \ abilities as well. Swift tracker allows Harsk to move his normal speed while using\
  \ Survival to track and reduces the penalty to –10 while moving at twice his normal\
  \ speed. Track now grants a bonus on Survival checks made to follow tracks equal\
  \ to 1/2 his ranger level. This change was made because everyone can track now using\
  \ Survival, making the ability redundant. At higher levels, Harsk would gain additional\
  \ favored enemies and terrains, additional combat style feats (additional archery\
  \ feats in Harsk's case), improved evasion, camouflage, hide in plain sight, and\
  \ at 20th level, the master hunter ability. This ability allows him to kill his\
  \ favored enemies with a single bolt, assuming they fail their saves. He can also\
  \ use this ability to deal nonlethal damage equal to the target's hit point total,\
  \ allowing him to bring his prey back alive.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>That covers\
  \ the ranger. Come back next week and enter the domains of Kyra, the iconic cleric.</p>\
