  ><em>Agents of Edgewatch Player’s Guide</em></a> is now available! Player characters\
  \ take on the role of rookie watch guards in the magnificent city of Absalom, where\
  \ anything is possible—including the nefarious workings of dastardly criminals!\
  \ It’s up to the Edgewatch to protect the city, a task made all the more important\
  \ with this century’s Radiant Festival fully underway. From ex-gladiatorial fighters\
  \ to cosmopolitan druids, a wide array of adventurers can find a calling as protectors\
  \ of Absalom’s people. This player’s guide contains spoiler-free advice to prepare\
  \ your characters for the challenges and opportunities ahead in Agents of Edgewatch.</p>\

  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <p>In addition to advice on how\
  \ to build your characters so they fit into the ranks of the Edgewatch, this player’\
  s guide includes a host of new character backgrounds to represent which city precinct\
  \ you served in before transferring to Edgewatch. Whether you were a prodigy from\
  \ the Learned Guard, an ex-acolyte who joined the Graycloaks after losing the faith,\
  \ or a tough-as-nails detective from the Puddles, you’ll find your unique skills\
  \ useful as you guard the newly revitalized Precipice Quarter from dangers both\
  \ commonplace and out-of-this-world. To help orient yourself, the back of the player’\
  s guide provides details on Absalom, the City at the Center of the World, including\
  \ a map and descriptions of each of the city’s richly varied districts.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Due to the sensitive nature of roleplaying as city watch members in an\
  \ Adventure Path, this player’s guide includes new required rules for players as\
  \ well as guidance for Game Masters on how to mitigate or eliminate potentially\
  \ upsetting aspects of the campaign—including running the campaign without roleplaying\
  \ as city guards. This advice is intended to ensure that you have a safe, fun time\
  \ playing Agents of Edgewatch.</p>\n      <p> <br clear=\"all\"> </p>\n      <p>The\
  \ following is just one of the 10 new character backgrounds in this player’s guide.</p>\
  \ \n      <blockquote> \n       <h3>Learned Guard Prodigy — Background</h3> \n \
  \      <p>For some, the nuts and bolts of keeping the peace are practically second\
  \ nature. Such is the case for you, a member of the Learned Guard with an incredible\
  \ mind for investigation as well as a gift for understanding magic. You probably\
  \ aren’t a hit with your peers, who find your intellect and natural gift of deduction\
  \ perhaps a bit off-putting, but when left to your own devices you excel, and you\
  \ get along well with professors and mages such as those who work in Forae Logos\
  \ or the Arcanamirium. </p> \n       <p>After no shortage of debating the pros and\
  \ cons, you decided to transfer to the Edgewatch precinct. Sure, you have a keen\
  \ understanding of the theories and principles behind law enforcement, but you’\
  ve reasoned that in order to be a truly effective guard you’ll need some first-hand\
  \ experience in a high-risk area nabbing suspects and protecting innocents—all the\
  \ while taking fastidious notes and writing your grand thesis on the merits and\
  \ shortcomings of Absalom’s laws.</p> \n       <p>Choose two ability boosts. One\
  \ must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p> \n   \
  \    <p>You’re trained in your choice of the Arcana or Occultism skill, as well\
  \ as Legal Lore. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation\
  \ checks to interact with Learned Guards and with academics such as librarians and\
  \ scholars. You gain the Recognize Spell skill feat.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n\
  \      <p>There’s never a dull moment in the city of Absalom, and as a member of\
  \ the Edgewatch you’ll have your hands full as you rescue citizens and travelers\
  \ alike from villainous criminals. Make sure you’re prepared to save the day with\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024wj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Agents-of-Edgewatch-Players-Guide\"\
