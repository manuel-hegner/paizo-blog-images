  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>Merisiel had heard enough. The targets, the timetables,\
  \ the names of the operatives—she had everything she could need to properly foil\
  \ their plan.</p> \n     <p>Below, the vampires stood around their map table, arguing\
  \ over details. Merisiel itched to put knives in all their backs, but even with\
  \ the element of surprise, she knew the only person she was likely to kill with\
  \ such an attack was herself. Besides, it wasn't in the plan.</p> \n     <p>Unfortunately,\
  \ what came next <i>also</i> wasn't in the plan. She'd arrived well before the vampires,\
  \ and chosen the perfect hiding place in the subterranean cathedral's upper balcony.\
  \ It had been a beautiful piece of infiltration work, if she did say so herself.\
  \ Yet how could she have known that the head vampire's first order of business would\
  \ be making her pretty-boy underlings move the map table from its original position\
  \ to a new spot directly blocking Merisiel's exit? Who orchestrated a coup and then\
  \ wasted valuable conspiracy time rearranging furniture?</p> \n     <p>Regardless,\
  \ Merisiel was going to have to get creative. Given the vampires' ability to see\
  \ in the dark, the shadows wouldn't be much help. And from their new positions around\
  \ the table, no matter which way she tried to sneak past them, at least one would\
  \ inevitably spot her long before she made it to the door.</p> \n     <p>Her gaze\
  \ rose, taking in the vaulted ceiling.</p> \n     <p><i>Maybe...</i></p> \n    \
  \ <p>Without further deliberation, she crept to the wall and began to climb.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was a big risk—but then, what part of this caper wasn't? And for\
  \ all the vampires' supernatural senses, they'd still started out as humans, which\
  \ meant they retained a human mindset. And humans rarely looked up without a reason.\
  \ Silent as a ghost, Merisiel picked her way across the ceiling, spidering over\
  \ ancient frescoes of rulers long since turned to dust in the crypts below.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She was almost to the door when the fop with the perfectly tousled hair\
  \ made an impertinent comment, earning a backhand from the leader. The slap knocked\
  \ the vampire's head backward, tilting it at just the wrong angle. His eyes met\
  \ Merisiel's and widened.</p> \n     <p>She dropped the last ten feet to the floor,\
  \ rolling to distribute the momentum as best she could, and darted for the door.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>They were almost too fast for her. A brace of knives flung backward\
  \ slowed them enough to give her a lead, but she knew that would only buy her so\
  \ much time—once they realized she wasn't packing silver, they'd lose what little\
  \ caution they had.</p> \n     <p>She sprinted through musty stone corridors, the\
  \ pack baying like hounds at her heels. The squad of spawn who'd been keeping lookout\
  \ at the main entrance appeared in the tunnel ahead, and Merisiel dodged left around\
  \ a corner, barely touching the stairs beneath her as she raced downward, deeper\
  \ into the crypts.</p> \n     <p>Behind her, someone shouted about the sewers, realizing\
  \ how she must have gotten past them the first time. She banked around another corner—\
  </p> \n     <p>—and into a dead end. Half a dozen sarcophagi lay in niches around\
  \ the circular mausoleum, the windowless walls covered in ornate Pharasmin prayers.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She whirled just in time to see vampires fill the only doorway. Recognizing\
  \ her predicament, they grinned and took the time to form up, stalking forward slowly\
  \ to savor the drama. Predatory eyes glowed with reflected light from the solitary\
  \ torch.</p> \n     <p>\"So. A spy.\" The dandy with the stupid hat sneered, baring\
  \ a single long fang. \"Perhaps not everyone in the court is as clueless as we presumed.\
  \ Too bad they'll never hear your report.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, I wouldn't worry\
  \ about that,\" Merisiel replied. \"They already know all your plans.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"What?\" It wasn't really possible for someone that pale to blanch, but\
  \ he made a valiant effort.</p> \n     <p>\"Yeah, see, I snuck in yesterday while\
  \ you were all taking your coffin naps and copied your documents.\" Merisiel made\
  \ a face. \"Honestly, I know you're a little behind the times, on account of being\
  \ dead and all, but you really need to invest in some better locks. I mean, poison\
  \ needle traps? What am I—twelve?\"</p> \n     <p>\"She's bluffing.\" The leader\
  \ shoved her way to the front and grabbed Merisiel by her armor's leather collar.\
  \ She hauled the elf close, perfect face twisting in a cruel smile. \"If you had\
  \ done what you say, why would you risk being here now?\"</p> \n     <p>Merisiel\
  \ made no move to resist, only matched that smile with one of her own.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"The thing is,\" she said, \"it just seemed like a shame to waste the opportunity.\
  \ What with all of you being together in one place.\"</p> \n     <p>The sound of\
  \ grinding stone echoed from every direction as lids slid from sarcophagi. Kyra\
  \ and the other priests stood up from their hiding places, holy symbols already\
  \ extended.</p> \n     <p>Merisiel closed her eyes as the blaze of holy light washed\
  \ over her.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If you liked this week's Iconic Encounter,\
  \ be sure to check back next Thursday for another exciting entry in the series.\
  \ Until then, Pathfinders, may your heists go off without a hitch.</p> \n    <p>Mark\
