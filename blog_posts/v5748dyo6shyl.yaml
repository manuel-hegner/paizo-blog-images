  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>ON KILLING KIN</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Amiri's arms burned as she hauled herself upward. Her hands cramped from finding\
  \ tenuous grips on small extrusions of stone, and one particularly vicious bit of\
  \ rock had sliced open a good gash below her knee out of what she assumed was sheer\
  \ spite. She unspooled her rope as she went, securing it whenever she found an anchor\
  \ point she was sure could bear Branum and Oska's weight.</p> \n     <p>Below her,\
  \ the siblings moved slowly. They'd lashed themselves together and to the rope,\
  \ and Oska helped haul her brother upward, pointing out easy hand- and footholds\
  \ wherever she could. Oska looked up, the light from above casting a narrow band\
  \ across her face. \"Getting tired yet?\" she called up. \"You're slowing down.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"How about you don't insult the woman with the rope,\" Amiri replied,\
  \ scowling down at her.</p> \n     <p>\"How about… we all… just try… not to plunge\
  \ to our deaths,\" Branum panted.</p> \n     <p>\"From that height, you probably\
  \ wouldn't die from the fall. You'd shatter your legs and starve to death,\" Amiri\
  \ said.</p> \n     <p>\"You'd die of thirst way before starving to death,\" Oska\
  \ countered.</p> \n     <p>\"Is this… supposed to be making me feel better?\" Branum\
  \ asked. He paused, clinging to the rope as he struggled to catch his breath.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I'm not going to let you fall,\" Oska said seriously.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I know. Besides, I could… always give us… a soft landing. I'm not… completely useless,\"\
  \ Branum reminded her. He waggled his fingers, and a few anemic sparks of light\
  \ danced around them.</p> \n     <p>\"Stop showing off and save your strength. Come\
  \ on. Halfway there,\" she said, fondness in her voice.</p> \n     <p>He nodded,\
  \ steeled himself, and began to climb again. He was an odd one to find among the\
  \ Six Bears, Amiri thought. He trusted his sister—and more than that, he readily\
  \ accepted her aid and comfort. Not once had he objected to her taking the lead\
  \ on physical tasks. It truly didn't seem to bother him that a woman was stronger\
  \ than he was. That wasn't a trait she'd encountered from her kinsmen often. Or\
  \ ever.</p> \n     <p>Amiri pulled herself up to a new handhold, then paused. It\
  \ wasn't far to the top, now—she was close enough to see beyond the slim opening\
  \ to a ceiling of stone. The top of the shaft led to another sheltered area, but\
  \ given the light coming down through it, it wasn't entirely covered.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>From above came a series of yips and snarls, then the scrambling of claws.\
  \ Amiri gestured sharply for the others to halt and be silent as the growling intensified.\
  \ Something clattered, and then a few bones—gristle still clinging to them—toppled\
  \ over the side of the shaft. Amiri clung tight to the wall to avoid the debris.\
  \ Branum stifled a startled sound as a femur smacked his shoulder.</p> \n     <p><em>Wait</em>,\
  \ Amiri motioned. The snarling and yipping and scrabbling continued. The cubs were\
  \ playing.</p> \n     <p>The sounds went on for several minutes before falling into\
  \ abrupt silence. Amiri waited another few moments, then began to climb again. They\
  \ moved without speaking now, slow but steady.</p> \n     <p>Before long, Amiri\
  \ was at the top of the shaft. She pushed her head and shoulders out of the opening,\
  \ scanning for the peryton and its cubs.</p> \n     <p>The cubs lay curled up together\
  \ on the far side of a large rock overhang, its floor littered with bones, offal,\
  \ and half-eaten carcasses. One of the cubs had fallen asleep gnawing on a skull\
  \ that might have belonged to a halfling; the other had a hand, half stripped of\
  \ flesh, tucked between its paws. Beyond the overhang was a small plateau with slopes\
  \ dropping off precipitously to all sides. There was no sign of the larger creature.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Amiri climbed out as silently as she could, then turned to help the\
  \ others. Oska moved off to the side to push as Amiri pulled, and they got Branum\
  \ up onto level ground, where he half-crouched and half-collapsed, wheezing as quietly\
  \ as he could. Oska scrambled up, quick as a squirrel, but her arms were shaking,\
  \ and she flexed her hands like they were cramped.</p> \n     <p>Amiri's limbs weren't\
  \ thanking her, either. \"Best go before the mother comes back,\" she whispered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oska nodded and tapped Branum's shoulder. He suppressed a groan as he\
  \ staggered up to his feet, and they edged along the side of the sheltered area,\
  \ Oska leading and Amiri taking up the rear to keep an eye on the cubs.</p> \n \
  \    <p>One moment, Oska was stepping out into the open, looking behind her with\
  \ a frown to track her brother's progress. The next moment she was gone, snatched\
  \ into the air with a scream.</p> \n     <p>\"Oska!\" Branum yelled. Amiri shoved\
  \ past him. The peryton's wingbeats scattered dust and debris as the creature climbed,\
  \ the grip of its hind talons piercing the flesh of Oska's shoulders. The girl screamed\
  \ in pain and twisted—not to get free, but to throw her bow and quiver as hard as\
  \ she could. They clattered to the ground 20 feet away. Amiri dove for them, snatched\
  \ them up.</p> \n     <p>She sighted along the arrow. Waiting. The peryton circled\
  \ around, moving awkwardly due to Oska's thrashing weight beneath it. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Damn it, hold still or it'll drop you off the cliff!\" Amiri shouted. \"\
  Wait!\"</p> \n     <p>The creature banked, passing high overhead. Oska, miraculously,\
  \ went still in its grip.</p> \n     <p>\"Hope you weren't lying about that soft\
  \ landing,\" Amiri said to Branum, not waiting for him to answer. The peryton's\
  \ shadow darkened the edge of the plateau.</p> \n     <p>Amiri loosed the arrow.\
  \ It struck the beast's left hind talon. The creature let out a strangled yelp of\
  \ pain and lost its grip on the struggling huntress. She plunged downward. Branum\
  \ reached out a hand and cried out a single word. Oska landed in a light crouch\
  \ as the peryton tumbled in the air, righted, and wheeled away.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Can we drive it off?\" Branum asked. \"Run?\"</p> \n     <p>\"We were in its nest.\
  \ Its cubs are in there. It isn't going to leave us alone now,\" Amiri said. She\
  \ tossed the bow and quiver back to Oska, who winced as she worked her punctured\
  \ shoulders. Amiri unstrapped the unwieldy, broken base of her sword from her back,\
  \ gripping the hilt in both hands.</p> \n     <p>The peryton's shadow glided over\
  \ the plateau once more. Only its shape was wrong.</p> \n     <p>\"It took your\
  \ shadow,\" Oska said, seeing the same. She gave Amiri a considering look. \"It's\
  \ coming for you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Which means you could run,\" Amiri replied.\
  \ \"It won't chase you while I'm still standing.\"</p> \n     <p>The beast howled.\
  \ It folded its wings in a dive, eyes fixed on Amiri. Oska and Branum fell back.\
  \ And Amiri leapt to meet the creature's charge.</p> \n     <p>They met in the air—\
  blade and beast, fang and fury. The peryton's eyes blazed with the fire of a mother\
  \ whose cubs had been threatened. Amiri's blood sang with rage of her own. Anger\
  \ for the beast, yes—but her old anger burned far brighter as she tumbled to the\
  \ stony ground with the monster.</p> \n     <p>She chanced a quick glance: the siblings\
  \ were gone. <em>Good</em>, she thought. They'd be safe. They'd live. Maruk wouldn't\
  \ have any more reason to haunt her.</p> \n     <p>Her jagged blade slashed across\
  \ the beast's chest, and the mountains rang with her brothers' mocking laughter.\
  \ Teeth snapped in the air an inch from her throat, and the air slithered with whispers.\
  \ <em>It isn't right. She brings shame to all of us. Something must be done.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>They had betrayed her. Made a fool of her. Humiliated her and tried\
  \ to lead her to her death. But they had failed. She had showed them her true strength.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She struck at the peryton again and again in a storm of steel and claw.\
  \ It darted in for quick attacks, retreating before she could get a proper strike\
  \ in. Any time she closed, it used a few quick wingbeats to reposition, sending\
  \ her scrambling around the plateau, wary of the sheer cliffs to every side. The\
  \ broken blade was unbalanced and unwieldy. Fury collapsed into frustration, and\
  \ she stood panting, both her and the beast bleeding from a half dozen minor wounds.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She'd put her back to the sheltered overhang, steering clear of the\
  \ precipitous drop-offs—all too aware of how easy it would be for the peryton to\
  \ fling her over the edge with a toss of its gore-rimed antlers.</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ sharp pain shot through Amiri's calf. She let out a cry of pain, twisting and\
  \ striking out. The broken blade swung, cleaving in half the peryton cub that had\
  \ sunk its teeth into her leg. The other sprang up, needle teeth clamping around\
  \ her wrist, as its mother let out a howl and charged.</p> \n     <p>Amiri flung\
  \ the cub away as the larger beast's antlers caught her up and threw her back against\
  \ the far wall of the cave. Her head hit stone with a crack. Stars burst in her\
  \ vision, and she collapsed to the ground in a stunned crouch. The peryton paced\
  \ forward, opening its jaws to bare its yellowed teeth.</p> \n     <p>There was\
  \ a crackling sound, and lightning arced, blasting into the peryton's side. Two\
  \ arrows followed in quick succession, and the peryton screamed, rearing away. Amiri\
  \ launched herself forward, stars still dancing in her eyes, and dashed past the\
  \ beast.</p> \n     <p>Oska and Branum stood at the edge of the plateau. Branum\
  \ raised his hands, light dancing at his fingertips. Oska set another arrow to her\
  \ bow. Amiri skidded to a stop in front of them.</p> \n     <p>\"What do you think\
  \ you're doing?\" she demanded. \"I told you to run.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Talked it\
  \ over. Decided not to listen to you,\" Branum said cheerfully.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  We don't leave kin to fight alone,\" Oska said firmly.</p> \n     <p>Amiri stared.\
  \ It had been a long time—a very long time—since anyone had claimed her as kin.\
  \ \"I killed your father,\" she said hollowly. \"He was a good man. More or less.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"You killed your kin,\" Oska agreed. Her eyes were bright. \"But\
  \ you know what, Amiri? I'm better than you.\"</p> \n     <p>The peryton staggered\
  \ into the light. It reared up on its hind legs, bellowing out a call to shake the\
  \ mountains.</p> \n     <p>Amiri and her kin turned to face it.</p> \n     <table\

  \    <p>Amiri dumped the waterskin over her head, rinsing some of the blood out\
  \ of her hair. The sun was going down. The cold air would keep the peryton's corpse,\
  \ laid out on the plateau behind her, from rotting. But there were other scavengers\
  \ in these mountains, and they'd be along soon to take their portion of the kill.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oska had already carved the antlers from its head and bound them together\
  \ to carry over her shoulder, as a trophy.</p> \n     <p>\"You know you won't be\
  \ able to claim that as your kill,\" Amiri said. She flicked her wet hair back from\
  \ her face.</p> \n     <p>Oska didn't meet her eyes. \"I'll say Branum killed it.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Branum laughed aloud. \"Yeah, they'll certainly believe that.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"We'll figure it out,\" Oska said, securing her makeshift straps.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Amiri just shook her head. She'd never have let someone else claim one\
  \ of her deeds at that age. She'd have shouted it to the whole clan at every opportunity.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>And look how that turned out</em>, she thought. She spat.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Can I have that?\" Branum asked. Amiri gave him a questioning look. He\
  \ gestured at the two halves of her blade that rested on the ground beside her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You couldn't even lift the thing,\" she told him, amused.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"I mean I can fix it for you,\" Branum said.</p> \n     <p>Oska straightened\
  \ up. A frown creased her lips. \"That's the sword that—\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's\
  \ a sword,\" Branum said. \"Just a tool. What matters is who wields it, not what\
  \ it's done.\"</p> \n     <p>Amiri gave him a level look. \"The woman who wields\
  \ this sword is the one that killed your father,\" she reminded him. \"You really\
  \ want to give me my blade back?\"</p> \n     <p>Branum looked over at the dead\
  \ peryton. \"Honestly? I want you to die a slow and painful death,\" he said, his\
  \ cheerful tone unwavering. \"But that wouldn't do anybody any good, would it? You\
  \ took my father from me. I've got no interest in forgiving you. And I've got no\
  \ interest in being a kinslayer. So now I get to choose how I carry that—how I bear\
  \ my choices without breaking. This is how I'm going to do it.\"</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ stepped forward and reached for the sword. Neither Amiri nor Oska said anything\
  \ to stop him as he dragged the pieces over to a clear patch of ground. He stood\
  \ with an expression of deep concentration, his hands held over the blade.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Slowly, the segments shivered toward one another. The metal gleamed. The\
  \ seam lit with a soft, silver light—and then the light faded, and the blade was\
  \ whole once more.</p> \n     <p>Branum stepped away, not touching it again. He\
  \ bent to pick up his pack and settled it on his shoulder. \"That's done, then,\"\
  \ he said simply.</p> \n     <p>Amiri hefted the blade. The familiar pull at her\
  \ muscles was welcome. The guilt needling through her was not.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Let's go,\" Oska said, touching her brother's arm. They turned away.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Don't go back,\" Amiri said, staring at the sword. Behind her, their footsteps\
  \ halted.</p> \n     <p>\"What else are we supposed to do?\" Oska asked.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Just leave.\" Amiri lowered the sword and turned toward them. \"Leave\
  \ before they find a way to kill you, or kill everything you are.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  It's not that easy,\" Oska said.</p> \n     <p>Amiri's lips twisted. \"If it was,\
  \ maybe I could've done it, before it was too late. But you're smarter than I ever\
  \ was. Or your brother is, at least.\"</p> \n     <p>Oska and Branum glanced at\
  \ each other. \"We don't hate the Six Bears,\" Branum said.</p> \n     <p>\"Neither\
  \ did I. I loved my brothers,\" Amiri said. \"Didn't stop them trying to kill me.\
  \ Didn't stop me killing them.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Where are we supposed to go, then?\
  \ With you?\" Oska asked scornfully.</p> \n     <p>Amiri snorted. \"None of us would\
  \ survive that,\" she said, and Oska chuckled in reluctant agreement. \"The world's\
  \ bigger than you think. Go see what it holds. Leave—while you still have the option\
  \ of coming home, if you decide that's what you want.\"</p> \n     <p>Oska didn't\
  \ answer. Neither did Branum. They turned away, setting out without another word.\
  \ But Branum looked at Oska, and Oska looked at Branum, and Amiri could tell that\
  \ each was thinking of the other. Of the things they could achieve, if they found\
  \ the place where they belonged. </p> \n     <p>They'd leave, she thought. Not for\
  \ themselves, but each for the other. Maybe someday they would even return—as she\
  \ never could.</p> \n     <p>Amiri made her way down the opposite flank of the mountain,\
  \ away from the siblings. Away from the Six Bears.</p> \n     <p>The wind howled\
  \ between the peaks. She listened long and hard, but there were no words within.\
  \ It was only the wind.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
