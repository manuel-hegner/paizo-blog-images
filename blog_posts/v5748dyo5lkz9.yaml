  \ Along with all the other members of the Design Team and the rest of the Paizo\
  \ staff, we'd like to thank you for your time, dedication, and enthusiasm. Without\
  \ you, we could not hope to make the best possible version of the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game. Your feedback, thoughts, concerns, and criticism are vital to our processâ€”\
  we literally can't do it without you!</p> \n    <p>So, let's talk about all the\
  \ ways you can help us playtest the newest version of Pathfinder! Starting on Thursday,\
  \ August 2, make sure to grab the free PDF of the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>\
  \ and make your first character. If you are planning on being your group's Game\
  \ Master, download the free adventure <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> and start reading through\
  \ Part 1 of the adventure. Make sure to also grab the free <em>Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ Bestiary</em> PDF, since it contains all of the adversaries you will need to run\
  \ the adventure.</p> \n    <p>Once you've gathered a group together, plan on playing\
  \ regularly over the next few months as we make our way through all seven parts\
  \ of the adventure. <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> is broken up into seven distinct chapters,\
  \ each of which tests different levels and different aspects of the game. Make sure\
  \ to set aside some time to give us your feedback as well. We are including surveys\
  \ this time around to collect your thoughts and help you get your feedback to us\
  \ as quickly and efficiently for you as possible, so taking part in the playtest\
  \ could not be easier!</p> \n    <h2>Playtesting with Doomsday Dawn</h2> \n    <ol>\n\
  \     <li>Before play begins, make sure to download the Playtest Tracking PDF (which\
  \ will be available starting Thursday, August 2) to help you keep track of a few\
  \ important pieces of information that we'll ask about later in the surveys. Note\
  \ that the PDF contains a sheet for GMs and a sheet for players.</li> \n     <li>Play\
  \ a chapter of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>. We highly recommend you start with Part 1\
  \ and play the adventure in order so that you fully experience the story, but if\
  \ you can only play some of the parts, that's OK!</li> \n     <li>Fill out the surveys\
  \ that correspond to the chapter you just played (either the GM survey or the player\
  \ survey, plus general feedback if you want to give some free responses). You'll\
  \ be able to find links to the surveys at pathfinderplaytest.com starting on Thursday,\
  \ August 2. Surveys for Parts 2-7 will go live as we progress through the playtest\
  \ (see the playtest schedule below). We recommend filling out each survey soon after\
  \ you play the chapter so the memory is fresh, but don't worry about memorizing\
  \ any fine details; that's what the Tracking PDF is for!</li> \n     <li>Go back\
  \ to Step 2 and play another part of the adventure until you're done with Doomsday\
  \ Dawn! We'll be focusing on each part in order, according to the playtest schedule.</li>\n\
  \    </ol> \n    <h2>Playtesting with the Pathfinder Society</h2> \n    <ol>\n \
  \    <li>Before play begins, make sure to grab the Society Playtest Tracking PDF\
  \ (which will be available starting Thursday, August 2) to help you keep track of\
  \ a few important pieces of information that we'll ask about later in the surveys.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Play one of the Pathfinder Society playtest scenarios.</li> \n    \
  \ <li>Fill out the survey corresponding to the scenario you just played (the player\
  \ or GM survey, plus the general feedback survey if you want to give some free responses).\
  \ We recommend filling out any surveys soon after you play the scenario so the memory\
  \ is fresh, but don't worry about memorizing any fine details; that's what the Tracking\
  \ PDF is for.</li> \n     <li>Go back to Step 2 and play a different scenario. You\
  \ can also replay any of the scenarios to try out a new class, ancestry, or other\
  \ combination!</li>\n    </ol> \n    <h2>Playtesting with Custom Adventures</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>There aren't any step-by-step instructions for playtesting using your\
  \ own adventures. You're in charge! Use the rules in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ Rulebook</em> and <em>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</em> to create any sort of\
  \ adventure you want. To make sure your data are as strong as possible, try to keep\
  \ to the guidelines in the rulebook and avoid setting any house rules, as these\
  \ limit what we can learn from your responses. For instance, if you run a monster\
  \ much stronger than the guidelines and then report that the PCs were easily defeated,\
  \ we can't tell how they might have fared under normal conditions. Other than that,\
  \ the sky's the limit.</p> \n    <h2>General Surveys</h2> \n    <p>In addition to\
  \ the adventure-specific surveys, we will also be releasing general surveys that\
  \ we would like everyone to complete, focusing on ancestries, character classes,\
  \ play mechanics, and more! We want to give you a chance to playtest a bit before\
  \ we launch those surveys, but when they go live, you'll find the links with the\
  \ other surveys at <a href=\"http://pathfinderplaytest.com\">pathfinderplaytest.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Discussions</h2> \n    <p>In addition to responding via the surveys,\
  \ you can engage with other players and designers over on our forums, discussing\
  \ the rules of the game and possibilities for the future. While we want to focus\
  \ on actual play feedback, we also want to hear your ideas about the game.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Playtest Schedule</h2> \n    <p>The playtest officially gets under way\
  \ on August 2, 2018, and runs through the end of the year, closing on December 31,\
  \ 2018. During that time, we will be focusing on various parts of the Doomsday Dawn\
  \ adventure, making our way toward the dramatic conclusion in mid-November. Check\
  \ out the following schedule so you can plan your games accordingly.</p> \n    <blockquote>\

  \ the playtest on the <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Paizo Twitch stream</a>. Once the playtest is underway, we will be hosting\
  \ a live stream every week where we play the game and talk about the results of\
  \ the playtest so far. Videos from that stream will be archived on our <a href=\"\
  https://www.youtube.com/PaizoInc\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a> if you\
  \ miss the live broadcast. We will also be doing a playtest wrap-up every two weeks\
  \ as we move from one part of the playtest adventure to the next. Expect to hear\
  \ all about the results of the playtest and what changes are being made based on\
  \ your feedback and comments!</p> \n    <p>How do you plan on participating in the\
  \ playtest? Do you have any other questions about the process you'd like to ask\
  \ us? Let us know in the comments below!</p> \n   </div> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Playtest\
