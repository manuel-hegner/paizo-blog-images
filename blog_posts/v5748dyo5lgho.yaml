  description\">The pyre burned for hours. Its flames seemed to lick the sky, and\
  \ Brea turned her horse and troopers away from the carnage. They rode for home,\
  \ though she wasn't sure what that meant anymore. Smoke rose behind them, a dark\
  \ reminder of her lord's betrayal.</span></p> \n     <p>Twenty-one cuirasses dangled\
  \ along the flanks of the remaining horses. They would carry those and the blackjackets\
  \ of their fallen to Deagan's Hold, a hollow shell of the soldiers who had died\
  \ in their lord's service. The armor clanked and rattled like a discordant dirge.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"He betrayed me,\" she whispered to Farnick. \"He betrayed us all.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Her friend grunted and shifted his weight atop his borrowed horse.\
  \ \"One hob's word and a few coins won't be enough.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What will\
  \ it take?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You speak of mutiny, sir,\" he said. \"A clear violation\
  \ of contract be needed for treachery.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yet the Prophets can be\
  \ as perfidious as they like.\"</p> \n     <p>He was silent a moment, then said,\
  \ \"And now you speak blasphemy.\"</p> \n     <p>Brea sighed. \"You won't help me.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>It wasn't a question, and Farnick did not grace her with a response.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"How long then, how long until you brand me a traitor, old friend?\"\
  \ she asked.</p> \n     <p>\"You have done nothing yet, sir. And when you do, I'll\
  \ give you a day and a night to seek your proof.\" His voice was flat, but she read\
  \ the sadness in the slump of his shoulders.</p> \n     <p>She didn’t know why Deagan\
  \ had stooped so low as to hire hobgoblins. Was it to be rid of her? He would consider\
  \ the deaths of her troopers acceptable losses, so long as his goals were achieved.\
  \ She had witnessed her lord sacrifice soldiers and citizens in pursuit of a few\
  \ leagues of land for his hold. To Deagan, they were but resources for him to manipulate,\
  \ control, and do away with at his whim. </p> \n     <p>She had thought she was\
  \ an exception.</p> \n     <p>\"Why didn't he just have me hanged? Concoct some\
  \ story. Why the deception?\" she asked, almost absently.</p> \n     <p>Farnick\
  \ shrugged. \"I don't claim to understand the ways of Kalistocrats, but your squadron\
  \ is loyal to you. I'm not the only one who remembers your deeds in the Goblinblood\
  \ Wars, and many have served years under your command, sir. We would follow you.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"But not in mutiny.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Aye.\" He paused, and then\
  \ added, “Not yet.\"</p> \n     <p>She smiled at him and nodded her understanding.\
  \ She would need to acquire proof beyond any doubt that Deagan had violated their\
  \ contract. And considering how meticulous her lord was with his recordkeeping,\
  \ she knew there would be something in his office. Some ledger or receipt of payment.\
  \ Some scrap of paper where he signed away her squadron's lives.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ clatter of Blackjackets heralded their arrival. Soldiers on the battlements saw\
  \ the empty cuirasses and nodded a sorrowful greeting. Citizens going about their\
  \ daily chores stopped to stare. Brea's remaining troopers marched like a funeral\
  \ procession. Nine of thirty: the numbers resounded in her mind alongside the faces\
  \ of the fallen.</p> \n     <p>They rode straight to her lord’s keep and collected\
  \ a crowd of onlookers who followed their bedraggled band. The commotion drew citizen\
  \ and soldier alike, and Brea led them to the square below Deagan's balcony.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"My lord Callimedes,\" she called, loud enough for all to hear. She\
  \ wasn't sure if Deagan would respond. Perhaps he might be too shocked that she\
  \ yet lived. Perhaps he was too cowardly to face her in such a public display. Perhaps\
  \ her audacity would see her hanged, her love be damned.</p> \n     <p>Two Blackjackets,\
  \ whom Brea recognized as her lord's personal guards, stepped onto the balcony.\
  \ They peered around and squinted knowingly at Brea below them.</p> \n     <p>After\
  \ a moment, Lord Deagan Callimedes slid into view between his Blackjackets. Gold\
  \ embroidery lined his elegant robes and sparkled in the afternoon sun. Jewels at\
  \ his throat and fingers glittered. Though he seemed a bright star hovering above\
  \ Brea's gloomy procession, she saw the dark cast of his features, the anger that\
  \ hardened his eyes to chips of ice. Deagan's white-gloved hands gripped the balustrade\
  \ tight enough she heard the wood creak.</p> \n     <p>Still, her breath caught\
  \ at the sight of him, her heart giving a painful lurch.</p> \n     <p>\"Captain.\"\
  \ His voice rang across the square.</p> \n     <p>\"An ambush, my lord. Twenty-one\
  \ of your finest troopers taken at the hands of hobgoblins.\" She wanted all of\
  \ the Mercenary League to hear of the dead, to know of their fallen brothers. Once\
  \ she had proof, what was left of her squadron would not be enough. She needed every\
  \ Blackjacket in Deagan's Hold to turn against him.</p> \n     <p>Her lord was silent\
  \ a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft, and Brea couldn't tell\
  \ if the gentleness there was for her or for show.</p> \n     <p>\"Then we mourn\
  \ tonight,\" he said, \"but we also celebrate the safe return of those who live\
  \ to serve Kalistrade another day. Come, give your report Captain, and let us prepare\
  \ a memorial for my fallen Blackjackets.\"</p> \n     <p>With that he turned and\
  \ disappeared into his keep.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br> For Farnick, duty rises above all.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Brea sighed and dismounted her horse. She nodded to Farnick and whispered,\
  \ \"A day and a night, old friend.\"</p> \n     <p>He inclined his head, saying\
  \ nothing. He led her soldiers toward the barracks, while she climbed the steps\
  \ toward her lord once more and wondered if that would be the last she saw of Farnick.\
  \ If in the morning he would brand her a traitor and hunt her down.</p> \n     <p>Perhaps,\
  \ she thought, it was no more than she deserved.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Hot water soothed her battered body. A page had\
  \ intercepted her and instructed that she should make herself presentable. It seemed\
  \ no one was too happy with the muddy bootprints she'd left on her last visit, least\
  \ of all her lord. He'd lent her use of his own bathing chambers, though she'd seen\
  \ no sign of the man himself since her arrival.</p> \n     <p>She relaxed against\
  \ the porcelain tub. Every once in a while, a page would enter, remove a bucket\
  \ of stale water, and pour fresh, steaming water into her bath. Jasmine and white\
  \ rose petals floated on the surface, scenting the air along with her skin. A decanter\
  \ of chilled wine and a glass were placed on a table nearby.</p> \n     <p>\"It's\
  \ good to be a Prophet,\" she mused.</p> \n     <p>Though she avoided the wine for\
  \ fear of poison, least of all a dulling of her wits, she delighted in the comfort\
  \ of Deagan’s chambers. If he intended to manipulate her before killing her, she\
  \ might as well enjoy herself. And if she planned to peruse his office for proof\
  \ of his treachery, then she would need to employ the same cleverness and subtlety\
  \ of a Kalistocrat. She would need to use whatever love he once had for her as a\
  \ weapon. He had said her heart would be his undoing, and Brea needed to make that\
  \ prophecy come true.</p> \n     <p>When her olive skin turned pink from scrubbing,\
  \ she wrapped herself in a robe and padded to the door that led to Deagan's office.\
  \ She paused to listen and, hearing no one on the other side, opened it.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Leather-bound books and papers were stacked with care atop his desk. Gold\
  \ trinkets and statuettes carved from ivory decorated his shelves. A tapestry woven\
  \ with the Prophecies of Kalistrade hung above the hearth. They had once laughed\
  \ with devilish delight at that tapestry, tangled together below it before the hearth.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now the fireplace stood empty and cold. Not even the plush carpets warmed\
  \ her bare feet as she moved to his desk.</p> \n     <p>Dates marked the binding\
  \ of each ledger. Every paper was labeled in his intricate script. Deagan was a\
  \ man who enjoyed details. He memorized the annual harvests of each province in\
  \ the same meticulous way his fingers knew the delicate slope of her jaw, the column\
  \ of her throat, and the slow curve of her hips.</p> \n     <p>She opened the newest\
  \ ledger and scanned row upon row of transactions. Most of the accounts were lost\
  \ on her, but she knew enough to understand Deagan's wealth was far greater than\
  \ she'd expected. If he was conducting the amount and volume of sales the ledger\
  \ indicated, then he was amassing enough power to draw the eyes of other Prophets,\
  \ perhaps even the High Prophet himself.</p> \n     <p>If any of the Kalistocrats\
  \ looked too closely, they would discover her relationship with Deagan. Because\
  \ it was a violation of the Prophecies for a Kalistocrat to have liaisons that might\
  \ result in illegitimate heirs, they would strip her of her blackjacket and Deagan\
  \ of his title. It was a risk she and Deagan had known, but his hold had been beneath\
  \ the notice of his betters, a small keep on the border of dwarven territory. Inconsequential,\
  \ until now.</p> \n     <p>His efforts to stamp her out of existence suddenly made\
  \ all too much sense.</p> \n     <p>She flipped pages, seeking anything that might\
  \ indicate the hiring of hobgoblins or his attempt to remove her without sullying\
  \ his own hands. She found nothing. </p> \n     <p>\"Looking for something, Captain?\"\
  \ Deagan's voice sounded from the bathing chambers. He leaned against the doorframe,\
  \ swirling a glass of wine.</p> \n     <p>Brea had no answer for him, no clever\
  \ excuse that would spare her. She longed for the clarity of war and a simple sword\
  \ in her hand, for an opponent whose eyes she could meet, for whom her heart did\
  \ not ache. In that moment, she feared her lord more than any murderous hobgoblin.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Come, I wish to show you something,\" he said and turned his back\
  \ to her.</p> \n     <p>She had no blade hidden in her robe, and even if she did,\
  \ she wasn't sure she could use it on her lord. She followed him into his chambers,\
  \ her heart dying a little with every step.</p> \n     <p>He motioned to the foot\
  \ of his bed, where her armor lay atop her doublet and clothes. It had been cleaned\
  \ and polished, oiled to a fine shine that reflected the evening sun that blazed\
  \ through his chamber's window. The gold etchings seemed brilliant on the dark armor,\
  \ and she wondered if the magical blessings had also been restored. Her new gorget\
  \ had been scrubbed. The scratch where it had turned the hobgoblin's blade and saved\
  \ her life was no more than a dimple she had to feel with her fingers to sense.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You'll want to be clean and in full regalia for the memorial service,\"\
  \ he said. \"Go on.\"</p> \n     <p>Brea had never been shy, not during the months\
  \ in battlefield encampments surrounded by hardened soldiers, nor in the presence\
  \ of her lord. Shyness was a trait for noble ladies and their handmaidens, of which\
  \ she was neither. But now when she grasped the cinch of her robe, she hesitated.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What game is this?\" she asked, the words leaving her throat before\
  \ she could stop them.</p> \n     <p>He shook his head and sipped from his glass.\
  \ \"Dress, Captain.\"</p> \n     <p>As she removed her robe, Deagan went to his\
  \ window and stared at the setting sun. Brea slipped on her clothing and pulled\
  \ her arming doublet over her head. When she began strapping down the plate armor,\
  \ her lord came to her.</p> \n     <p>\"Allow me,\" he said and knelt before her.\
  \ His elegant hands fastened the buckles of her greaves with ease. As he rose to\
  \ assist with her gorget, she met his bloodshot eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Why?\" she\
  \ whispered.</p> \n     <p>He did not answer. Leaving her gauntlets on the bed,\
  \ he took her hand and led her toward the window.</p> \n     <p>\"There is talk\
  \ of mutiny in your squadron, Captain,\" he said.</p> \n     <p>So he knew, had\
  \ known before he caught her snooping in his study. For the first time, Brea considered\
  \ the possibility of a spy among her ranks. Someone new whom Deagan had paid to\
  \ report on her. She didn't want to believe in such a betrayal, but if her lord\
  \ could break her heart, one of her brothers could easily break her trust.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Some believe I have violated my contract with the Mercenary League,\"\
  \ he continued, standing behind her as she faced the square below. A gallows had\
  \ been erected, and townsfolk were gathering around it.</p> \n     <p>\"So this\
  \ is it then,\" she said, thankful that at least he had allowed her to dress as\
  \ a soldier. The weight of the armor that had long protected her would now drag\
  \ her to a quicker death.</p> \n     <p>\"I cannot have betrayal in my ranks, Captain.\
  \ It must be dealt with swiftly.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Did you ever love me?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>His breath warmed the shell of her ear. A black-masked executioner stepped\
  \ onto the gallows, tying the rope securely between the uprights. Brea saw her troopers\
  \ interspersed with the crowd, Etrim's blond head next to Soltez's dark curls. Both\
  \ were young and stupid enough to be her lord's lap dog. They came to watch her\
  \ die.</p> \n     <p>\"An example must be made,\" Deagan said. \"Your squadron must\
  \ know I do not tolerate treachery in my officers.\"</p> \n     <p>She nodded. \"\
  I would have died for you on the field. This will only be a little different.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Watch. And then you must go...go far away.\" His breathing was\
  \ labored now, and he took a step back from her.</p> \n     <p>She furrowed her\
  \ brow and did as her lord ordered.</p> \n     <p>From the keep strode two of Deagan's\
  \ personal Blackjackets carrying a short, struggling figure between them. The bald\
  \ head and missing ear of her old friend were unmistakable.</p> \n     <p>\"Farnick?\"\
  \ She whirled on Deagan, her stomach roiling with sickness. \"No, it's me you want.\
  \ Hang me.\"</p> \n     <p>His eyes glimmered, his face lined with pain. \"You understand\
  \ nothing.\"</p> \n     <p>She lunged at him, knocking him to the ground. Her hands\
  \ clamped on his shoulders and rapped his head against the floor. \"Release Farnick!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Her lord whispered a single word, and the gorget closed around her\
  \ throat. She let him go to fumble at the clasp, but it would not open.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Staggering to his feet, Deagan coughed and said, \"Someone must be responsible\
  \ for the threat of mutiny. Someone must pay. But not you...\"</p> \n     <p>Brea\
  \ rolled on the ground, fighting for air. The world around her became fuzzy and\
  \ disjointed.</p> \n     <p>\"I'd hoped you would violate your contract,” he continued,\
  \ “and leave after the brigands...and when you didn’t, I steeled myself and sent\
  \ you to the hobs to die. But didn’t die, and I knew couldn't bear to go through\
  \ it all again, to see you swinging from a rope.\" He laughed. \"You keep coming\
  \ back. My weakness. My albatross.\"</p> \n     <p>He crouched before her. Spots\
  \ colored her vision, but she could see tears streaking his beautiful face. From\
  \ the square below, she heard the crowd murmur before going silent.</p> \n     <p>Farnick's\
  \ gruff voice boomed with his final words. \"'Tis been my honor to serve with the\
  \ finest soldiers, the finest Captain, I have known.\"</p> \n     <p>A crack sounded\
  \ as the trapdoor under his feet opened and the crossbeam bore his weight.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Brea felt her own tears roll down her face, felt Deagan catch one with\
  \ a gentle fingertip. Then the world disappeared.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align:\
