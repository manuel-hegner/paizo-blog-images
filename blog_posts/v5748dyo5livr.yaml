  \ hits this month! Ready to learn more about the legions you'll be joining or commanding\
  \ once you've picked up the definitive guide to this deadly order?</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ time around let's focus on the Hellknights' lesser-known orders, small but driven\
  \ organizations ready to accept new members or that might come to oppose your wild\
  \ adventuring.</p> \n     <h2>Lesser Hellknight Orders</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Beyond the seven well-known orders of Hellknight—Chain, Gate, Godclaw,\
  \ Nail, Pyre, Rack, and Scourge—there are several minor orders. Among these are\
  \ the vicious Order of the Coil, revenge-obsessed Sargavan interlopers, the Order\
  \ of the Pike, a band of renowned monster hunters, and the Order of the Glyph, who\
  \ you might already know from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>. Some of these fringe groups number among the\
  \ most heroic and villainous of the Hellknight orders, but heretofore little has\
  \ been said about them. The Lesser Orders section of <em>Path of the Hellknight</em>\
  \ changes that. While these orders hold a great deal of interest and potential,\
  \ especially with some of their niche focuses, they have less of a footprint in\
  \ the Inner Sea Region, and, appropriately, in this book. But I didn't want to leave\
  \ readers gravitating toward these orders adrift. As a result, each of these orders\
  \ references which major Hellknight order it's most similar to. This guidepost points\
  \ readers toward an analogous major order with options to crib from. It's a quick\
  \ fix, but it opens the door to a variety of options for Hellknights of these minor\
  \ orders. Beyond this, you'll find plenty of new details, histories, and options\
  \ for these orders. To show off a bit of that, here's a few snippets from one, the\
  \ Order of the Wall.</p> \n     <blockquote style=\"clear: both; padding-top:20px;\"\

  ><b>Analogous Order</b> Rack</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Today, the order\
  \ has grown from 50 members to nearer a hundred, most of whom are lawful neutral.\
  \ Technically subordinate to the Order of the Chain, the Order of the Wall has no\
  \ lictor, as master of blades is its highest title. In practice, though, the order\
  \ functions with near autonomy. The order's mandate to defend Chelish fronts south\
  \ of the Arch of Aroden has broadened over the years. Now, members stand watch at\
  \ several borders—not just Chelish ones—defending civilization's frontiers. Despite\
  \ the order's Chelish origins, Garundi—and specifically Rahadoumi—soldiers comprise\
  \ most of the order's Hellknights. While their defense of the Gnashing Wall remains\
  \ an almost religious duty, many travel across northern Garund, serving as guardians\
  \ of all sorts.</p> \n     <p>So that's a bit of what you can expect in the chapter\
  \ on lesser Hellknight orders. But to get back to the major orders, here are glimpses\
  \ of what you can expect from the fanatical Order of the Godclaw and the frontier\
  \ scouring Order of the Nail.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  ><b>Members</b> crusaders, religious zealots</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Armor Features</b> breastplate with clawlike vambraces, clawlike helm</p> \n\
  \      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Favored Weapon</b> morningstar</p> \n      <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Reckoning</b> Flagellate yourself with a five-tailed\
  \ lash. Whenever you are the target of a lawful divine caster's spell that heals\
  \ hit point damage, you heal 1 additional point per die rolled. Additionally, if\
  \ you cast divine spells, you can use the holy symbols of Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae,\
  \ Irori, and Torag interchangeably.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Not content\
  \ with seeking divine approval for their knighthood's righteous path, the Order\
  \ of the Godclaw's members have sculpted their beliefs from the harshest, most exacting\
  \ philosophies of five lawful deities: Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae, Irori, and Torag.\
  \ Remade as five stern, armored paragons, the deities of this pantheon are known\
  \ collectively as the Godclaw. The Hellknights follow revised doctrines to stamp\
  \ out disorder, particularly its divine embodiments and beings of absolute chaos,\
  \ with religious zeal. Rather than targeting the faiths of prominent religions,\
  \ the order sets its eyes on supporting lawful crusades (such as the wars fought\
  \ by Molthune and Mendev) and being at the vanguard of battles against the forces\
  \ of chaos. No land is beyond the lawfulness provided by Hellknights—a fact the\
  \ Order of the Godclaw endlessly seeks to prove.</p> \n     <p>Members of the Order\
  \ of the Godclaw can also expect to learn much more about the formation of their\
  \ unique order, their pentamic faith, their holdouts (and escape routes) near Citadel\
  \ Dinyar, and a new Godclaw oracle mystery—for your most devout, polytheistic signifers.</p>\

  \ \n     <p>To certain dogmatic, rigid-minded individuals, civilization seems under\
  \ siege. Beyond the bulwarks of cities and national borders lies an endless expanse\
  \ of wilderness populated by those who, all too often, shun the rules of settled,\
  \ lawful societies and follow their own callings. To the Order of the Nail, these\
  \ beings enviously prey upon the children of the law, seeking to draw civilization\
  \ into a regressive mire. The Order of the Nail stands staunchly against what it\
  \ views as barbarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9293-Intro.jpg\"\
