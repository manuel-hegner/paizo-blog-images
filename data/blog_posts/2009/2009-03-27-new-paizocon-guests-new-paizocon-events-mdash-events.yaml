  \              Fantasy game design crept up on Lou Agresta in 2005, when diamondthrone.com\
  \ accepted his first articles on true names. Until then a writer of travelogues,\
  \ indie comics, fashion essays, and torturous, self-indulgent philosophy tracts,\
  \ his more recent adventure credits include SAW #1 and #12 of the Trodoon Gate Saga\
  \ (LPJ Designs), <i>The Bloody Fix</i> and <i>The Punctured Vein</i> with Rone Barton\
  \ (O0negames), and Pathfinder Society Scenario #8: <i>Slave Pits of Absalom</i>.\
  \ Lou is one of six authors from the Great City Campaign Setting (0onegames), a\
  \ contributor to Sinister Adventures, and chief-scribbler over at the RPGAggression\
  \ blog. A member of the Werecabbages freelance writer's guild, he also had his fingers\
  \ in both the GM Gems and PC Pearls collaborations (Goodman Games) and has made\
  \ guest appearances as Cthu-Lou on the Atomic Array podcast. Lou's set piece, slated\
  \ for Pathfinder #24, will likely prove the last of its kind. <i>Dungeon</i> acquired\
  \ his first adventure, written with Nicolas Logue, then canceled the magazine, leaving\
  \ Lou forever haunted by the fear he is somehow responsible. Lou lives somewhere\
  \ in upstate NY with his wife, daughter, a dog, and a couple of horses. While he\
  \ has sometimes worn a kilt and ridden a tractor, no one has ever caught him doing\
  \ both.</p>\n            <br clear=\"all\">\n            <br><img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/RobMcCreary.jpg\"\

  \ in Prague, Czech Republic, where he is an English teacher by day and freelancer\
  \ by night. Rob made it to last year's RPG Superstar Top 4 with a combination of\
  \ coin belts, ziggurat-filled jungles, and monkey-goblins. Thus far he has contributed\
  \ to the <i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, several <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ Bestiaries, and the upcoming <i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i>. Rob is currently\

  \ the name of his first-ever D&amp;D character, Tjaden, in his email address, and\
  \ he's also devious enough to have slipped the name of his fiancee into the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, to her great amusement and delight. Jason was\
  \ some combination of lucky and good enough to make the Final Four in the inaugural\
  \ RPG Superstar and has also written a number of adventures and articles for <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dragon</i> magazines (ah, memories) and over a hundred webcolumns for Wizards\
  \ of the Coast, including the long-running \"Save My Game\" and \"Behind the Screen.\"\
  \ More recently, he has contributed to <i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i> and several\

  \            <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #23:<br><i>Tide of Morning</i> by\
  \ Steven Robert (for Tier 1–5)</b><br>\n              Venture-Captain Dennel Hamshanks\
  \ sends you to convince an Andoren druid named Hemzel to allow the Pathfinder Society\
  \ to study his recently discovered lorestone, a minor magical item that unlocks\
  \ some of the mysteries of the ancient Andoren druid circles. When you arrive and\
  \ find Hemzel murdered and the lorestone missing, you must race against time to\
  \ recover the lorestone and stop Hemzel's murderers from using it against the druids\
  \ of Andoran.</p>\n            <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #24:<br><i>The\
  \ Decline of Glory</i> by Tim Hitchcock (for Tier 1–7)</b></p> When the son of a\
  \ famous Pathfinder gains control of his father's holdings in Taldor, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society decides to build a new lodge there as a base to explore the many ruins\
  \ of that crumbling empire. Unfortunately, the Taldan Phalanx has its eye on the\
  \ holdings and an ancient curse has turned many of the residents into the walking\
  \ dead. Can you survive the tangled web of Taldor's politics and fight off the echoes\
  \ of the past or will you, too, see your glory decline? \n            <p></p>\n\
  \            <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #25:<br><i>Hands of the Muted God</i>\
  \ by Clinton J. Boomer (for Tier 5–9)</b><br>\n              When the man who would\
  \ be the Muted God wordlessly stepped beyond the gates of the Starstone's Cathedral,\
  \ his thousand and one faithful ringing the Ascendant Court watched with the silent\
  \ contemplation that is their highest sacrament. When he failed to emerge, many\
  \ of his penitents abandoned their vows but a small sect remained loyal and worshipful.\
  \ You and your fellow Pathfinders are sent into the mountains north of Absalom to\
  \ follow the path of a doomed party and uncover the secrets of the Muted God. His\
  \ loyal band of followers, called the Hand, will stop at nothing to keep you away\
  \ from their shrine—even forming an alliance with some of Golarion's most evil denizens.</p>\n\
  \            <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #26:<br><i>Lost at Bitter End</i>\
  \ by Joshua J. Frost (for Tier 7–11)</b><br>\n              When a Pathfinder Society\
  \ Priest of Nethys disappears in northern Geb while studying the Mana Wastes, the\
  \ Society sends you to uncover his whereabouts and find his journals. Arriving in\
  \ the town of Bitter End, you find it deserted but for a few mysterious creatures\
  \ never before seen on Golarion. Those creatures quickly lead to more and soon you're\
  \ embroiled in a mystery that could affect the very fabric of reality. Will you\
  \ solve the mystery of Bitter End or find yourself lost forever in the Mana Wastes?</p>\n\
  \            <p><b>Cursed Lot: New Beginnings, GMed by Jason Bulmahn</b><br>\n \
  \             Last year, a group of brave, but horribly cursed adventurers set out\
  \ on a brave adventure. While one succeeded to be rid of his terrible curse, the\
  \ rest suffered and even worse fate. This year, a new band of unfortunately cursed\
  \ heroes takes on an even greater challenge... to rescue a missing dog. How hard\
  \ could that be?</p>\n            <p><b>Fires Over Brinestump, GMed by James Jacobs</b><br>\n\
  \              It's been three years since the last time goblins have been a problem\
  \ on the Lost Coast, but last night, a band of Licktoad Goblins from the Brinestump\
  \ Marsh lit a merchant wagon on fire. The lone survivior almost made it to the town\
  \ of Sandpoint before dying of his burns, and shortly after his body is discovered,\
  \ fireworks bloom over Brinestump Marsh, lighting the night sky south of Sandpoint\
  \ in an unmistakable display of goblin celebration. Why are the Licktoad Goblins\
  \ on the march? Who gave them fireworks? Does this herald the advent of another\
  \ goblin invasion of the town of Sandpoint? A Pathfinder RPG adventure for six 1st\
  \ level characters.</p>\n            <p><b>Into the Scarlet Monastery, GMed by Sean\
  \ K Reynolds</b> The zealots of the Scarlet Monastery have been a blight on the\
  \ world for three years. Reviled by all, they hate against all nonhumans, accuse\
  \ their enemies of spreading plague, and lynch innocents in the name of their crusade.\
  \ Now is the time to defeat their Commander. But are two orc warriors, a troll mage,\
  \ a warlock, an undead rogue, and a minotaur druid up to the task?</p>\n       \
  \     <p><b>Before Nightfall, a PFPRG Playtest for a work in progress, GMed by F.\
  \ Wesley Schneider</b><br>\n              Forsaken, some places are best left to\
  \ their haunted memories and the shadows of things best left forgotten. On the Ustalavic\
  \ frontieer, one such ruin has long loomed over the lives and nightmares of the\
  \ local peasents, a monument to terrors that can never be forgotten. Now a terrible\
  \ new life has returned to the dreaded citadel, one that seeks to renew the horrors\
  \ of centuries past. Take up arms and explore the deadly grounds and labyinthine\
  \ courtyards of a soon to be infamous gothic castle, offer your advice and feedback\
  \ on what makes for exciting horror roleplaying, and participate in the creation\
  \ of a terrifying new adventure written in the tradition of one of the most famous\

  \ 2009! Soon, Paizo's Events Manager Joshua J. Frost will put out an open call for\
  \ one of the fall Pathfinder Society Scenarios—a call that can only be answered\
  \ by attendees at PAIZOCON 2009! All who contributed may attend this workshop where\
  \ Joshua will go over why each scenario was and wasn't accepted. For a unique look\
  \ inside the creative mind of the guy who brings you your monthly installment of\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenarios, look no further than this seminar! This event will\
  \ be capped at 20 attendees.</p>\n            <p>... and much, much more! Don't\
  \ delay—sign up for PAIZOCON 2009 today!</p>\n            <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>\n\
