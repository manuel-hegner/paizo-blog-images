  \ to play a character who thrives in the wild? Not in the mood for playing another\
  \ city-slicker? Let me tell you a bit more about what we have in store for you in\
  \ the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Wilderness</em></a>. <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk8h?Force-of-Nature\"\
  >Stephen showed off the shifter in Tuesday's blog</a>, and talked a bit about two\
  \ of the three featured races: ghorans and vine leshys. Let's take a closer look\
  \ at all three of these races.</p> \n    <p>Ghorans are an ancient race of plant\
  \ creatures whose memories trace back thousands of years. Their bodies can only\
  \ last a couple of decades, but they continually renew themselves by planting seeds\
  \ that sprout into new vessels for their consciousness. If you play a ghoran, check\
  \ out the delightfully odd aromaphile archetype. These mesmerists can produce clouds\
  \ of sickeningly sweet odors. By making subtle changes to the aroma, they can alter\
  \ the way it affects those who inhale it. These clouds can hypnotize and debilitate\
  \ their foes, and they can also help their allies recover from negative effects.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Vine leshys are a new race in this book. Unlike most leshys, they don't\
  \ devote themselves to a particular ward. Instead, they prefer to wander and explore,\
  \ taking on new wards for only a short time before taking off in search of new and\
  \ exciting vistas. I wrote these little guys, and they are leshys, so of course\
  \ I love them. I've been playing a vine leshy named Verdant Taleweaver in a home\
  \ game. She uses one of the new archetypes from this book: the herbalist alchemist.\
  \ Herbalists rely upon their insights into the natural world rather than raw intelligence,\
  \ and they can harness some of the secrets of druidic magic. Instead of throwing\
  \ bombs, with their risk of harming innocent plants, herbalists use seedpods. These\
  \ pods harness the powers of other leshy types to weaken and hamper their targets.\
  \ Playing Verdant wasn't 100% about wanting to play a leshy PC, honest. I also got\
  \ valuable playtest feedback. Please just ignore the fact that my door is plastered\
  \ with pictures of leshys. <i>*whistles innocently*</i></p> \n    <p>And that brings\
  \ us to this book's third featured race, the gathlains. These playful fey are capricious\
  \ and free-spirited to a level that makes even gnomes raise their colorful eyebrows.\
  \ They soar through the air on winds of wood, venturing far from their homes on\
  \ the First World. If you want to play a gathlain who loves a good prank, check\
  \ out the fey prankster rogue archetype. These tricksters can harness their connection\
  \ to plants to distract, trap, and befuddle. They can also weave illusions that\
  \ sow confusion by disguising pairs of people as each other. These illusions work\
  \ on objects too, allowing the gathlain to, say, make a piping hot bowl of soup\
  \ appear to be a hat and vice versa.</p> \n    <p>You certainly don't have to play\
  \ one of these new races to make use of the new archetypes in this book. There are\
  \ over 60 pages of archetypes for all sorts of characters. There are new options\
  \ for the classes you'd expect to see highlighted in a nature book, like druids,\
  \ hunters, rangers, and kineticists. One of the druid options is a rot warden, a\
  \ druid who can transform into vermin and command swarms. Plant master hunters form\
  \ bonds with plants instead of animals, and they take on the aspects of creatures\
  \ like assassin vines and giant flytraps. Several of the new ranger archetypes give\
  \ rangers additional powers based upon natural features that help them wherever\
  \ they go, like the flamewarden, who wields the power of fire to immolate enemies\
  \ and restore the spark of life and health to her allies. If you want to play a\
  \ character whose powers are intrinsically tied to her environment, try the terrakineticist,\
  \ a kineticist who taps into the strongest nearby source of elemental power, giving\
  \ her powers over water in the ocean and air in the skies.</p> \n    <p>These traditional\
  \ nature classes certainly don't get to have all the fun, though. How about a slayer\
  \ who is a master of death from above? He's called the avalancher for a good reason.\
  \ Bacchanal skalds thrive on drinking, dancing, and wild parties. Even animals dance\
  \ to their merry tunes. If you'd rather play a class that turns its attention to\
  \ the skies, try the star watcher investigator, who combines navigational skill\
  \ with a penchant for astrology. Star watchers produce horoscopes imbued with magical\
  \ power. To pick one last archetype at random, summoners can become leshy callers.\
  \ Leshy callers call forth extraplanar plant material and imbue it with leshy spirits,\
  \ and they can summon adorable plant creatures to aid them in combat. These are\
  \ just a few of the archetypes that caught my fancy, but the book has a lot more\
  \ to offer.</p> \n    <p>Check back again in a few days for more previews of <a\
