  \ the Pulps</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 17, 2009</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ paths to our most cherished obsessions take on many varied forms. For me, one\
  \ such passion is reading science fiction and fantasy from an older, often more\
  \ spirit-soaring, freewheeling era. My Yellow Brick Road to the type of pulps we\
  \ publish at <a href=\"/planetStories\">Planet Stories</a> began at an early age\
  \ with an uncle bequeathing to me a longstanding love of Edgar Rice Burroughs's\
  \ works. Probably the foundation for my fascination with the pulps was laid much\
  \ earlier, reading H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, although at the time I didn't really\
  \ realize their novels were serialized in magazines like Burroughs's. And even after\
  \ I'd read a healthy dose of Burroughs, it wasn't until I found Irwin Porges's mammoth\
  \ biography, <i>Edgar Rice Burroughs: The Man Who Created Tarzan</i>, that I first\
  \ saw reproductions of those splendid <i>All-Story Weekly</i>, <i>Blue Book</i>,\
  \ <i>Argosy</i>, <i>Amazing Stories</i>, and <i>Fantastic Adventures</i> covers\
  \ and made the connection between ERB and the pulps.</p> \n    <p>Then, of course,\
  \ there was Philip José Farmer. Farmer was for me, as for thousands of SF/F readers\
  \ growing up in the 1970s and '80s, the mega-gateway to the pulps. And like many,\
  \ I stumbled across his writings through Burroughs, picking up Farmer's post-modern\
  \ metafictional masterpiece <i>Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke</i>,\
  \ and later his \"biography\" of the 1930s scientific genius and crime-fighter Doc\
  \ Savage. In these books Farmer proposed his intricate Wold Newton faux genealogy,\
  \ linking together into one giant family an array of pulp era heroes and villains\
  \ ranging from Allan Quatermain to Solomon Kane, Captain Nemo to Fu Manchu, and\
  \ everything in between—and in many cases beyond. A virtual reading list of the\
  \ \"hero pulps,\" for which I will forever be grateful to Farmer for having amalgamated.\
  \ If I would have been told back then that one day I would meet the man and edit\
  \ three collections of his fiction, I would have lit up with such joy that my glowing\
  \ manifestations would probably have been visible on far-off Poloda (for the as-yet\
  \ ERB-uninitiated, I refer to a planet in the strangely shaped solar system from\
  \ Burroughs's <i>Beyond the Farthest Star</i>).</p> \n    <p>I radiate a similar\
  \ joy working with Erik and Pierce and James bringing back into print fantastic\
  \ lost classics of the pulp era for <a href=\"/planetStories\">Planet Stories</a>.\
  \ I think I speak for all of us when I say the task is more than a job, more even\
  \ than a privilege, although it is unquestionably the latter. <a href=\"/planetStories\"\
  >Planet Stories</a> is about tradition, about carrying on the flame of the spirit\
  \ of adventure and excitement and wonder of the type of science fiction that first\
  \ soared free in the pulps.</p> \n    <p>But enough said about my road to the pulps.\
  \ I encourage you to stop by the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/planetStories/general\"\
  >Planet Stories messageboards</a> and let us know of your own unique journeys to\
  \ the world of science fiction and fantasy literature. Like the out-of-this-world\
  \ genre they lead to, they are always tales of wonder.</p> \n    <p>Christopher\
