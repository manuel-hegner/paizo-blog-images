  \ </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The Mwangi Expanse\
  \ is a vast and diverse place. The region’s people hold a variety of beliefs that\
  \ include gods not seen anywhere else. You can read about a number of these gods,\
  \ including returning gods like Grandmother Spider and new gods like catfolk god\
  \ Adanye, in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  >Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</a>.</p> \n      <p>We here at Team Lost Omens thought\
  \ it would be fun to take some of these Mwangi gods and match them up with other\
  \ gods, both Mwangi and otherwise, to create new pantheons. Pantheons are groups\
  \ of related gods that a faithful can worship as a collective, focusing on either\
  \ a specific deity within the pantheon or following all of the gods together. You\
  \ can find more information on pantheons in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  >Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</a>.</p> \n      <p>Each of the following pantheons\
  \ includes at least one Mwangi deity and can serve as a suitable faith for characters\
  \ hailing from the Mwangi Expanse. We encourage everyone to use the following pantheons\
  \ as examples when creating their own pantheons for home play. If you make your\
  \ own pantheon or end up playing a character that follows one of the following pantheons,\
  \ let us know!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5ee751e5-091b-438f-915f-ae14d3bb4b09/071621_majagua.png\"\

  \ unpunished<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> machete</p> \n      <p>The Mwangi Expanse\
  \ is full of dangers. Of particular note are the various demons and other Abyssal\
  \ creatures that roam the jungles. Many of these creatures are drawn to the Mwangi\
  \ Expanse by the presence of Angazhan’s or Lamashtu’s might, while others are direct\
  \ servitors of those faithful to the demonic. While the Mwangi Expanse is home to\
  \ many demon hunters that keep these evil forces at bay, many of them work in independent\
  \ groups. It’s only with the combined efforts of the demon hunters that the Mwangi\
  \ Expanse can be rid of this demonic presence and the people of the Mwangi Expanse\
  \ can be safe.</p> \n      <p>The demon hunters among the Ekujae elves, Matanji\
  \ orcs, Mwangi catfolk, Mbe’ke dwarves, and others began to join forces in their\
  \ demon hunts and brought their respective gods with them. This led to the worship\
  \ of a pantheon of righteous gods that both offered the might to destroy demons\
  \ and the wisdom to defend others. Through the worship of Adanye, Chohar, Kazutal\
  \ (in her form as Majagua), and Torag, these mighty hunters find the strength they\
  \ need to make the Mwangi Expanse a safer place. While this pantheon didn’t originally\
  \ have a name, the local Mwangi populations eventually dubbed them the Demon Bringers,\
  \ as their faithful would bring home trophies in the form of demon heads, claws,\
  \ or tails. Followers of the Demon Bringers use their skills to hunt demons and\
  \ other evils that lie within the Mwangi Expanse. They also help create homes and\
  \ fortifications for those that can’t fight, as the ultimate goal of the Demon Bringers\
  \ is a safer Mwangi for all.</p> \n      <br> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/82814672-1259-49fe-a09e-824763ea9498/071621_lubaiko.png\"\

  \ to escape punishment after their reign ends, enslave or oppress others, prevent\
  \ others from honestly expressing themselves<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> sword cane</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Local stories say that the people of Vidrian had the support of the\
  \ gods when the time came for revolution. Lubaiko provided the first flames of rebellion,\
  \ literally igniting the first cart that led to the initial confrontation at a plantation\
  \ on the outskirts of Eleder. The tales then note that the casks on the cart erupted\
  \ as the first blow was struck, creating a massive explosion that woke everyone\
  \ on the plantation. Many say this was Cayden Cailean’s way of showing his support.\
  \ As everyone stirred about and watched those first servants and slaves fight, others\
  \ were fearful of the consequences. It was the touch of hope that Milani granted\
  \ them that finally gave them the strength to rise up and fight for freedom.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Whether or not the stories hold truth, the Freeing Flame remains a\
  \ notable pantheon among the people of Vidrian today. The young nation broke free\
  \ from the shackles of oppression and now looks toward bettering itself in the future,\
  \ a mantra that many Vidrics and followers of the Freeing Flame follow for themselves.\
  \ With the guidance of Milani, the courage of Cayden, and the inspiration of Lubaiko,\
  \ a faithful can burn away maladies of the heart to become a person that is free\
  \ to do as they wish, but also do so without infringing on others. Some follow these\
  \ ideals to stop tyrants and liberate those that can’t live freely, while others\
  \ take these teachings to become independent figures with little concern of others’\
  \ expectations.</p> \n      <br> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \ to fly<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> longbow</p> \n      <p>The only thing more expansive\
  \ than the Mwangi jungles, mountains, and rivers are the skies that rest above them.\
  \ There are many who would seek to take control of the skies and there are others\
  \ who seek to keep the skies free for all. From evil spellcasters looking to wield\
  \ the weather for their own wicked whims to deadly monsters that make them dangerous\
  \ to travel, the skies are never truly safe. Thankfully, an unlikely alliance of\
  \ gods works together to keep the skies over the Expanse safe.</p> \n      <p>Apsu,\
  \ god of good dragons, saw how his son Dahak once tried to burn down the entirety\
  \ of the Mwangi Expanse and took it upon himself to defend the skies that rest over\
  \ those that put a stop to Dahak’s destruction. Uvoko, the diamond ring, is a living\
  \ embodiment of the Mwangi skies and valued Apsu’s aid. Finally, with the recent\
  \ release of Ranginori, the elemental lord took to reclaiming the skies from evildoers.\
  \ When the three gods encountered each other, they formed the Pact of the Sky Keepers,\
  \ dedicating themselves to both keeping the skies safe for all, but also maintaining\
  \ the natural cycles and orders of the skies. The sky belongs to everyone, but ultimately,\
  \ the sky has no master and attempts to force one’s will upon by forcibly changing\
  \ the weather or committing similar acts goes against the Pact. Followers of the\
  \ Sky Keepers can be found all over Golarion, but Apsu and Uvoko’s focus on the\
  \ Mwangi Expanse leads to many worshippers operating in the region.</p> \n     \

  \ were the first sun-kings of Mzali, building the city as a safe haven for the people\
  \ of the Expanse. Their might, leadership, and kindness earned them a place among\
  \ the heavens, transforming them into the sun gods of Mzali. As gods, they met Sarenrae,\
  \ another goddess of the sun, and for a time, all four worked together to help the\
  \ people of Golarion. Eventually, whether intentionally or otherwise, the people\
  \ of Mzali forgot their sun gods. The sun gods watched as the people of Mzali forgot\
  \ prayers and songs to their former gods. The sun gods wept because their people\
  \ could no longer see or hear them, but Sarenrae offered them words of encouragement:\
  \ there would be a time when people remembered the sun gods once more.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>Thanks to the efforts of the Bright Lions of Mzali, worship of the sun gods\
  \ has returned to the Mwangi Expanse. While the sun gods appreciate this renewed\
  \ faith, they did not forget Sarenrae’s kindness. When asked about their disappearance,\
  \ the sun gods merely state they were biding their time alongside a friend. This\
  \ friendship led to the worship of the three sun gods alongside Sarenrae as a greater\
  \ sun pantheon. The collective sun gods teach that kindness and second chances are\
  \ pivotal values. They also note that sometimes a person needs to change into someone\
  \ new before they are truly themselves and instruct that helping others with these\
  \ changes is akin to helping bring new life into the world. The four gods know that\
  \ there might be other forgotten gods and peoples out there that just need some\
  \ kindness to make it through their period of turmoil, so they ask their worshippers\
  \ to help these forgotten in whatever way they can. Finally, the sun gods make it\
  \ clear that lost or abandoned gods can still find companionship among the divine\
  \ and welcome these gods to join their ranks.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
