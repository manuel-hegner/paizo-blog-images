  description\">There are many wonderful things about being a Game Master, but I think\
  \ it's fair to say both that filling that role takes practice and that we can make\
  \ some silly errors while learning. Thinking back to how I GMed before beginning\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play, I realize that many of the tricks I pulled\
  \ on my players were downright cruel, such as heaving colonies of rust monsters\
  \ at the fighter, swarming the bard with wererats until he was infected and under\
  \ GM control, repeatedly giving one player an intelligent greatsword that would\
  \ inevitably betray him, having a creature \"adopt\" the party wizard in a familiar-master\
  \ bond just so I could kill the familiar and drain the character's Constitution\
  \ score, and repeatedly tempting the characters to betray the other PCs for power\
  \ and wealth. Yep, those were some really bad campaigns (yet everyone kept expecting\
  \ me to be the GM), and I think it's telling that I can remember little of their\
  \ overarching plotlines. What I can remember, though, are the villains.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>In retrospect, I think one villain in particular made me understand\
  \ what it meant to make an adventure about more than just looting dungeons and killing\
  \ monsters. He was an orange-clad wizard with a penchant for turning into a falcon,\
  \ and I initially threw him into the storyline largely for the opportunity to lob\
  \ a <i>fireball</i> at the 4th-level PCs. The adventurers fought hard and nearly\
  \ killed the poor spellcaster, but he transformed into a falcon and flew out of\
  \ the tower, madly screeching incomprehensible promises to get his revenge for their\
  \ interrupting his nefarious (and largely undefined) plans. A recurring villain\
  \ was born, but I hardly knew it then.</p> \n     <p>The PCs shrugged, looted the\
  \ tower, and went on their way to continue raiding random dungeons and getting themselves\
  \ into trouble in practically every town—thanks in large part to the paladin constantly\
  \ catching the chaotic \"good\" barbarian in the act of killing commoners. Perhaps\
  \ three character levels later, the tavern they were in exploded, and like any adventuring\
  \ company worth its salt, the PCs rolled initiative and chased after the mysterious\
  \ culprit. Thinking their prey cornered in an alleyway, they were surprised to find\
  \ the dead end empty save for a sealed letter and that wizard standing on top of\
  \ a building laughing maniacally. \"That letter contains the name of the next village\
  \ I shall burn to the ground,\" he chortled. \"See if you can reach it before I\
  \ do!\" He then shapechanged and flew out of sight, leaving the paladin fuming and\
  \ the barbarian ambivalent. After reading the message and triggering its <i>explosive\
  \ runes</i> the barbarian was also thoroughly interested in squashing the spellcaster.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That wizard repeated this at three villages in a row, each time leaving\
  \ behind a charred husk of a town, a few minions to gnaw on the PCs, and a booby-trapped\
  \ letter saying where he would strike next. They eventually cornered him in a climatic\
  \ fight, killed him, and threw his body into a volcano. Unfortunately, the GM had\
  \ recently read the description for <i>true resurrection</i>, brought back the wizard\
  \ with new allies, and convinced the aforementioned barbarian to betray the party\
  \ in return for an unnamed boon. After defeating all but the barbarian, that wizard\
  \ knocked out the traitor, polymorphed the entire party into rats, and sent them\
  \ through a trap-filled maze after giving a classic villainous monologue. The story\
  \ goes on and on, but suffice it to say that this was our recurring villain from\
  \ levels 4 to 24, and for years afterward, mentioning his name to any of that gaming\
  \ group would cause them to scowl, grind their teeth, and hoarsely growl \"I <i>hate</i>\
  \ that guy!\"</p> \n     <p>Nearly a decade later when I started playing Pathfinder\
  \ Society, I found the lack of recurring villains somewhat comforting; by the end\
  \ of each scenario, the PCs were victorious and had no loose ends to tie up. That\
  \ was the case, at least, until I played a noteworthy, multi-scenario arc that ended\
  \ in our perceived failure, for despite our \"winning\" the scenario, the villains\
  \ succeeded at their scheme and left behind an insulting letter to add insult to\
  \ injury. At first I found myself thinking, \"What? No way! This can't be right!\"\
  \ A little later that evolved to, \"What more could we have done to prevent this,\"\
  \ and later still, \"Oh, I can't wait to find those guys in the future.\" I found\
  \ myself actually enjoying that we didn't have a clean victory because it really\
  \ made me look forward to encountering those villains again in the future. In a\
  \ way, I had encountered exactly what I had used against my players years before.</p>\

  \      <br>Illustration by Dean Spencer\n     </div> \n     <p>Now that I've cornered\
  \ you and given you the \"let me tell you about my character\" spiel, let me share\
  \ why I subjected you to my rambling stories. When I first started working for Paizo,\
  \ my mind was swimming with different villains who had tormented the Pathfinders\
  \ in the past and might one day make a second appearance. Already there are several\
  \ familiar faces set to show up again in the coming months, and I'm always happy\
  \ to read about players' memorable experiences with the Big Bad Evil Guy from Scenario\
  \ #X–YZ. It means the villain connected with the player base and helped to pull\
  \ participants deeper into the story. It means that I can learn from what went particularly\
  \ well with that NPC, and it also means that—story permitting—we might see that\
  \ character again for a rematch.</p> \n     <p><b>USING SPOILERS that include the\
  \ scenario's name</b> so as not to ruin the surprise for someone else, which villains\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play have been your favorites? What about the\
  \ villain really pushed your buttons? Who would you like the chance to meet again?</p>\
