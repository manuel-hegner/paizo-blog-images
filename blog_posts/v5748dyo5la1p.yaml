  \ Moorcock!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 4th, 2008</p> \n   <p>Here\
  \ at <a href=\"/planetStories\">Planet Stories</a>, we've had a number of fortunate\
  \ turns that have helped us go from the wistful dream of pulp-loving Erik Mona to\
  \ a publisher that gets to unearth and reintroduce some of the best and most important\
  \ fantasy and SF of the last century. And of all our lucky breaks, perhaps our greatest\
  \ is our relationship with Michael Moorcock. In addition to having us publish his\
  \ Kane of Old Mars series (three books that include <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8c\"\
  ><i>City of the Beast</i></a>, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdp\"><i>Lord of the Spiders</i></a>,\
  \ and the forthcoming <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hq\"><i>Masters of the Pit</i></a>),\
  \ Moorcock has also written a number of insightful introductions for our other books,\
  \ and has even pointed us to a few potential Planet Stories authors—after all, he's\
  \ been reading this stuff longer than most of our staff has been alive. </p> \n\
  \   <p>Why is that such a big deal? Only because Michael Moorcock is, without a\
  \ doubt, one of the most important and influential fantasy authors alive. He began\
  \ editing the magazine <i>Tarzan Adventures</i> when he was fifteen years old—fifteen!—\
  and in the decades since has written dozens of novels that have inspired generations.\
  \ He's won the Nebula Award. The World Fantasy Award. The British Fantasy Award\
  \ (twice!). The Bram Stoker Lifetime Achievement Award. He's even in the Science\
  \ Fiction Hall of Fame. And in the course of winning those accolades, he's given\
  \ us some of the genre's most memorable characters, particularly Elric of Melniboné\
  , the skinny albino who, with his black sword Stormbringer, is perhaps the most\
  \ famous of Moorcock's Eternal Champions. </p> \n   <p>The idea of a reprehensible\
  \ anti-hero in fantasy; the concept of an eternal battle, not between good and evil,\
  \ but between law and chaos; even the term \"multiverse\" to describe overlapping\
  \ dimensions—all of these are things popularized by Moorcock that have since become\
  \ pillars of the fantasy world, both in fiction and in gaming. He's been cited as\
  \ an influence by everyone from Neil Gaiman to China Miéville, and his work remains\
  \ as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. </p> \n   <p>All of which is why we're\
  \ so honored to be working with him. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor\
  \ and check out <a href=\"/store /v5748btpy7x8c\"><i>City of the Beast</i></a> or\
  \ <a href=\"/store /v5748btpy7zdp\"><i>Lord of the Spiders</i></a> and get a taste\
  \ of SF history at its finest.</p> \n   <p> James Sutter <br> <i>Planet Stories</i>\
