  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's that time\
  \ again, ghouls and boils! Howl-oween is almost hereâ€”the fearly celebration of everything\
  \ creepy and scary, and on a Saturday no less! If you're lurking for a good time,\
  \ it's the perfect excuse to run a creepy game for all your fiends! But what's that?\
  \ You haven't made arrangements before now? What a ghastly mistake! Luckily, your\
  \ friend Paizo grave-elopers have assembled a list of the top ten creepiest Pathfinder\
  \ products you can pull out for a scary night of rolling bones. You can buy the\
  \ physical product, or pick up the PDF on short notice and get your spooky books\
  \ instantly, anywhere ghost to ghost!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>10. <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy94vv\">Pathfinder Adventure Path: Empty Graves</a></b>: You\
  \ say you want a zombie apocalypse in Pathfinder, with plenty of strange monsters\
  \ being stirred into a tizzy over the undead uprising, and it all runs on a timer?\
  \ <em>Empty Graves</em> is a level 4-6 urban sandbox that focuses on surviving the\
  \ undead onslaught and eventually ending the necromancer stirring them up!</p> \n\

  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9cri\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Tombs of Golarion</a></b>:\
  \ if a pre-built adventure isn't your style, <em>Tombs of Golarion</em> offers 6\
  \ seeds and maps for dungeon crawls among the restless dead, covering everything\
  \ from a murky Horse Lord cairn to a clockwork tomb.</p> \n     <p><b>8. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mw2\">Pathfinder Module: Feast of Ravenmoor</a></b>: If you want\
  \ less dead and more lively threats, <em>Feast of Ravenmoor</em> is a 3rd-level\
  \ adventure that pits your innocent travellers against an all-too-human cult in\
  \ a sleepy little hamlet. Equal parts Sleepy Hollow and Children of the Corn, Ravenmoor\
  \ is a small town getaway your adventurers won't be recommending to their friends.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>7. <a href=\"/products/btpy991t\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Undead\
  \ Unleashed</a></b>: If your campaign can't afford a long diversion for a full module,\
  \ the <em>Undead Unleashed</em> brings 15 rotting antagonists to meddle in your\
  \ adventurers' affairs for a single encounter or an extended stay, ranging from\
  \ CR 3 to 23!</p> \n     <p><b>6. <a href=\"/products/btpy95zo\">Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: Occult Mysteries</a></b>: If you need to bring in a touch of the strange\
  \ far more than you need a monster-of-the-week, <em>Occult Mysteries</em> is a toolbox\
  \ that caters to every flavor of weird that hides in the corners of Golarion. From\
  \ astrology to numerology to the secret societies and veiled masters who control\
  \ the destiny of humankind, Occult Mysteries offers guidance in adding just enough\
  \ of the weird to your game to keep your players uncomfortable.</p> \n     <p><b>5.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5u\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</a></b>:\
  \ Horror requires a certain sense of helplessness and hopelessness, and nowhere\
  \ in Golarion do these elements flourish quite so well as Ustalav. Rule of Fear\
  \ offers a detailed overview of a nation that exists to support its monsters, human\
  \ and supernatural alike, and where mortal heroes are the ones who are hunted as\
  \ beasts.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown\"\

  \    <p><b>4. <a href=\"/products/btpy8baj\">Pathfinder Module: Carrion Hill</a></b>:\
  \ If insanity, lost lore, and buried secrets appeal to your players, they'll find\
  \ a place to settle in somewhere in the winding, muddy streets of Carrion Hill.\
  \ This adventure for 5th-level characters takes players from the halls of government\
  \ to asylum cells to forgotten ruins all in search of secrets buried in the cursed\
  \ city's founding.</p> \n     <p><b>3. <a href=\"/products/btpy8l3g\">Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Undead Revisited</a></b>: To run a creepy-crawly effectively,\
  \ you need to get inside its head and know how they tick. Ghosts don't simply leap\
  \ out and yell \"boo!\" in our complicated modern world. Learn the tricks of the\
  \ undead trade in <em>Undead Revisited</em>, and be prepared for any spooky game\
  \ this Halloween, whether of our making or your own.</p> \n     <p><b>2. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ban\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Classic Horrors Revisited</a></b>:\
  \ Certainly monsters are scary, but why are they scary and how can you make them\
  \ scarier? <em>Classic Horrors Revisited</em> looks at some of the most iconic monsters\
  \ in pop culture, from mummies to flesh golems to werewolves and delves into why\
  \ they exist and what makes them hunt commoners for sport! It provides plenty of\
  \ inspiration whether you're running your own game or trying to make a pre-made\
  \ adventure a little more terrifying.</p> \n     <p><b>1. <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path: Carrion Crown</a></b>: The entire run of Carrion Crown\
  \ delves into the most timeless horror monsters in the western world, and runs from\
