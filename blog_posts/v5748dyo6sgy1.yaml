  \ with the nation of Lastwall will know of the Knights of Ozem, stalwart crusaders\
  \ who took up the legacy of the Shining Crusade. In honor of all who had sacrificed\
  \ themselves to defeat the Whispering Tyrant and seal him within the prison of Gallowspire,\
  \ the Knights of Ozem swore themselves to keep vigil for all eternity, ensuring\
  \ Tar-Baphon never threatened Golarion again. The nation of Lastwall drew warriors\
  \ of good to its shining white walls, each one proud of their support of a righteous\
  \ cause.</p> \n     <p>When Tar-Baphon rose once more, they didn’t even have the\
  \ chance to fight.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-knightsoflastwallicon.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>A magical blast of unfathomable power vaporized Lastwall’\
  s capital of Vigil in an instant. By the time the survivors rallied, there was no\
  \ victory to be found, only bitter efforts to evacuate civilians and desperate pleas\
  \ to prevent comrades from throwing their lives away for a nation that was already\
  \ dead. It was in the wake of utter failure—some of which was undoubtedly the fault\
  \ of the knights themselves—that the Knights of Ozem proved their courage and character.\
  \ They stood back up again and rallied once more, knowing they were doomed to fail\
  \ again in countless battles to come, yet still holding faith that their efforts\
  \ would make a difference.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-lastwallcrusader.jpg\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>With the loss of Lastwall weighing on them, what remained\
  \ of the Knights of Ozem fell apart. The fraction of knights that remained soon\
  \ found themselves at a crossroads. Do they flee Lastwall, their ultimate mission\
  \ a failure, or do they stand and fight once more? Well, if evil roams the world,\
  \ it must be stopped. And with that, many of these knights discarded the formal\
  \ structure they were once committed to and chose to put the fight against evil\
  \ and the dedication to righteousness above all things. (Check out Liane Merciel’\
  s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwp?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Seeds-of-Hope\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>While the Knights of Lastwall are more decentralized than\
  \ ever, lacking an official headquarters and official leaders, the knights still\
  \ maintain a semblance of structure. The knights move in groups, mostly made up\
  \ of anyone willing to fight the hordes of the Whispering Tyrant, with leadership\
  \ falling to whomever among the group has earned the most respect or influence among\
  \ their fellow knights. In large scale conflicts, some knights take on roles as\
  \ strategic leaders, only to return to the status of an everyday knight once the\
  \ battle is done.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190927-lastwallmage.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n     <p>Even in this more informal structure, the Knights of Lastwall\
  \ break up into two large subfactions. The first are the Shining Sentinels, they\
  \ are the crusaders and defenders of the knights, committed to the defense of innocents\
  \ and stemming the spread of undeath. They are the heirs of Lastwall’s cause and\
  \ are hoping to rally forces to a new Shining Crusade against the Whispering Tyrant.\
  \ Characters who affiliate with the Shining Sentinels can take the Knight Vigilant\
  \ archetype, a 6th-level dedication. The archetype is focused on defense, allowing\
  \ you to provide cover to allies, increase your proficiency with heavy armor, and\
  \ gain resistance against attacks from undead. The Knight Vigilant also gains access\
  \ to the Aegis of Arnisant feat.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>The other subfaction within the Knights of Lastwall are the\
  \ Crimson Reclaimers. The Crimson Reclaimers are less concerned with defending the\
  \ already protected bastions of civilization and instead seek to take the fight\
  \ to the undead directly. If the Shining Sentinels are the shield that defends the\
  \ innocent, the Crimson Reclaimers are the blade that cuts down the forces of evil.\
  \ They travel directly into the Gravelands to fight toe to toe with the countless\
  \ undead that roam the region, rescuing any civilians that may still be trapped\
  \ beyond the front lines. In addition to their great skill at combat and infiltration,\
  \ every Reclaimer swears the Crimson Oath, a mysterious rite that grants additional\
  \ power against the horrors of the undead. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ but aren’t necessarily dedicated to either the Shining Sentinels or the Crimson\
  \ Reclaimers still have a number of options available to them. As many of the Knights\
  \ of Lastwall are champions and fighters, the section offers a selection of feats\
  \ for both of these classes, some of which grant new focus spells like the sun blade\
  \ focus spell for champions. The spell allows champions to fire a ray of sunlight\
  \ from their weapons, dealing fire damage, good damage, and positive damage to evil\
  \ undead, and even grows more powerful when the sun is in the sky. Beyond that,\
  \ the knights have access to a variety of equipment to aid in their fight against\
  \ evil such as the armored skirt and the fauchard. The knights even make use of\
  \ magical equipment like glorious plate, full plate armor that can blind a knight’\
  s enemies, and the deadly serrating rune!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
