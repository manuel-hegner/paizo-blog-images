  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 22, 2011</p> <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/CarrionCrown/PZO3017-Poison.jpg\" border=\"0\" align=\"\
  right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n    <p>For quite a while now there has been a bit of\
  \ confusion on how poison is applied in the Pathfinder RPG. While the application\
  \ of a single dose is simple enough, the rules allow for the stacking of poisons\
  \ that causes them to combine into a more powerful effect. There are, unfortunately,\
  \ some timing issues with these rules that can make poisons a bit tricky to adjudicate\
  \ during play. Since this issue is a bit more complex than your average FAQ issue,\
  \ the design team thought it would be a good idea to take a more in depth look at\
  \ the issue here.</p> \n    <p>Poisons fall under the category of afflictions. They\
  \ each have a save, a frequency, an effect, and a cure. At the most simple level,\
  \ this means that when a character comes into contact with the poison, she gets\
  \ a save. If the save succeeds, the poison has no effect, regardless of the cure\
  \ entry. If the saving throw is failed, the character takes the effect and must\
  \ continue to makes saves, dictated by the frequency, or continue to take the effect\
  \ with each failed save. The only way to be free of the poison at this point is\
  \ to meet the conditions of the cure entry, usually one or more successful saving\
  \ throws (usually consecutively if more than one).</p> \n    <p>When a character\
  \ is subject to more than 1 dose of the same poison, things get interesting. Each\
  \ dose increases the DC by +2 and increases the total duration listed in the frequency\
  \ by half of the original duration. Due to timing, however, this can make for a\
  \ rather confusing situation. When does the DC increase apply? When are the saving\
  \ throws made? When is the duration increased? To keep things simple, use the following\
  \ guidelines.</p> \n    <p><b>1.</b> Whenever a character is exposed to a poison\
  \ (regardless of method), that character gets a saving throw to negate the poison.<br>\
  \ <b>2.</b> The saving throw DC is increased by +2 for every active dose currently\
  \ affecting the character. Poisons that were cured, have run through their entire\
  \ frequency, or were negated with a successful initial saving throw do not increase\
  \ the DC.<br> <b>3.</b> The character must make a saving throw against every poison\
  \ affecting him on his turn, but may make the saving throw at any point during his\
  \ turn. If a poisoned character delays his turn, he must immediately make these\
  \ saving throws. They are not delayed.<br> <b>4.</b> Unless the poison has an onset\
  \ time, the character takes the effect of the poison every time he fails a saving\
  \ throw against the poison, even when additional doses are inflicted.<br> <b>5.</b>\
  \ The total duration of the poison listed in the frequency only increases by half\
  \ the original duration and only when the initial saving throw against a dose is\
  \ failed. If the initial saving throw is made, the duration is not increased.<br>\
  \ <b>6.</b> If a character is exposed to multiple doses of inhaled and ingested\
  \ poisons simultaneously, only one save is made at the higher DC. If the save fails,\
  \ the character is subject to all of the doses, but still only takes the effect\
  \ once for the failed saving throw. If the save succeeds, the character avoids all\
  \ of the doses. <br> <b>7.</b> Finally, if the character is exposed to a poison\
  \ that is similar, but not the same, such as having a slightly different frequency\
  \ or DC, it is treated as a different affliction that is tracked separately, even\
  \ if it has the same name or other identical entries.</p> \n    <p>So, keeping these\
  \ rules in mind, let's take a look at a few scenarios using poison and how they\
  \ are resolved. In all cases, the character is exposed to greenblood oil, an injury\
  \ poison, with a DC of 13, a frequency of 1/round for 4 rounds, an effect of 1 Con\
  \ damage, and a cure entry of 1 save.</p> \n    <p><b>Scenario A</b>: Valeros is\
  \ hit by an arrow coated in greenblood oil. He fails the DC 13 Fort save and takes\
  \ 1 point of Con damage. At the end of his turn, he fails a saving throw against\
  \ the poison and takes 1 more point of Con damage. Before his second turn, he gets\
  \ hit again and must attempt a DC 15 Fort save (because 1 dose is already affecting\
  \ him). He fails this save as well, which deals another point of Con damage, increases\
  \ the save DC he must make each round to 15, and extends the total duration by 2\
  \ rounds.</p> \n    <p><b>Scenario B</b>: Valeros is hit by a pair of arrows coated\
  \ in greenblood oil, during the turn of one enemy archer. He fails the first DC\
  \ 13 Fort save and takes 1 point of Con damage. He then must make a DC 15 Fort save\
  \ for the second arrow. He makes this save and suffers no ill effect. On his turn,\
  \ he must make a DC 13 For save (since only 1 dose of the poison is in effect).\
  \ He makes this save and takes no damage, as the poison ends. If he is hit again\
  \ on the next turn, his save would reset to DC 13.</p> \n    <p><b>Scenario C</b>:\
  \ Valeros is hit by a pair of arrows coated in greenblood oil. He fails the DC 13\
  \ Fort save and takes 1 point of Con damage. He then must make a DC 15 Fort save\
  \ for the second arrow. He fails this save and takes 1 point of Con damage. On his\
  \ turn, he must make another DC 15 Fort save, which he fails, causing him to take\
  \ yet another point of Con damage. On the next turn, the archer fires an arrow coated\
  \ in special greenblood oil poison, with a DC of 20. It hits poor Valeros, who fails\
  \ the save and now must track the two poisons separately (since they are not identical).\
  \ To add to his misery, another arrow coated in ordinary greenblood oil poison hits\
  \ him as well, forcing him to make a DC 17 Fortitude save, which he also fails,\
  \ increasing the total duration to 8 rounds (1 of which has passed). Valeros is\
  \ in trouble.</p> \n    <p>As you can see, poison is a deadly business. Monsters\
  \ that can use injury poison, such as spiders and centipedes, should not be taken\
  \ lightly. Best to stock up on a scroll or two of <i>neutralize poison</i>, or better\
  \ yet, a wand.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>Lead Designer</p> \n   </blockquote>\
