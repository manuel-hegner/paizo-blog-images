  \ is my six-month anniversary at Paizo. The time has flown since September 26, 2011.\
  \ Usually, State of the Union/State/County/City addresses are given on an annual\
  \ basis. In the future, I will most likely present this report at the yearly Pathfinder\
  \ Society Members’ Meeting at Gen Con. However, this being my first year and with\
  \ all the changes that have taken place, and in light of the goals set for the future,\
  \ I thought it was important to give a report of how my first six months on the\
  \ job have played out. </p> \n    <p>First and most importantly, I want to thank\
  \ all of the Venture-Captains and Lieutenants, regional and convention coordinators,\
  \ GMs, and people I use as a sounding board (you know who you are). Without all\
  \ of you, I would not be able to achieve everything listed below and make Pathfinder\
  \ Society as great as it is. I also want to thank all of our players and fans. Without\
  \ you, I wouldn’t have an awesome job to come to each morning. So, thank you from\
  \ the bottom of my heart for all of your efforts and support.</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play campaign has already seen numerous positive improvements\
  \ and changes. Here is a short list of things we’ve accomplished together in just\
  \ six months:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Established the Venture-Lieutenant program\
  \ and the recruited more than 75 new <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  > Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants</a> to help us grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ by presenting a Paizo 'face' in many local areas.</li> \n     <li>Implemented\
  \ numerous small updates to the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"> Pathfinder Society\
  \ webpage</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/faq\"> the campaign FAQ (red updates!),</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/resources\"> Additional Resources list.</a></li>\

  >To Scale the Dragon</a>.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>We've addressed our leadership,\
  \ our organization, our ground game, and our rules. And we couldn't have done any\
  \ of it without all of you.</p> \n    <p>All that is great, but it's not enough.\
  \ We're not done yet (which means that we all have more work to do). I'm excited\
  \ about the future of the Society. In particular, the following items on my now-less-than-secret\
  \ list excite me:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The Grand Convocation interactive will\
  \ return at PaizoCon 2012.</li> \n     <li>A second, competitive round has been\
  \ added to the Pathfinder Society Special at Gen Con 2012.</li> \n     <li>Continuing\
  \ to attend as many conventions as I can get to. I've been to <a href=\"http://www.vegasgamers.org/events/neoncon-2011\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">GAMA Trade Show (Las Vegas, NV)</a>, and the Alliance Game Distributors\
  \ Show (Ft. Wayne, IN) over the past six months. My upcoming 2012 schedule includes\
  \ stops at:</li> \n     <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"http://east.paxsite.com/\" target=\"\

  \   </ul> \n    <p>My goal is to meet as many Pathfinder Society players, GMs, and\
  \ coordinators as I can face-to-face. I encourage you to introduce yourself to me\
  \ at those conventions.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The plotline for Season 4 has been\
  \ laid-out, and Season 5 has already been put into a rough draft.</li> \n     <li>We\
  \ are looking at ways to make <a href=\"/forums/dmtz5fdr?The-Faction-War\">faction\
  \ missions</a> have a meaningful impact on the campaign and make more sense as presented\
  \ in scenarios.</li> \n     <li>Improve our Retailer Support program, including\
  \ upgrades to the website interface to make it more user-friendly for both retailers\
  \ and customers.</li> \n     <li>Improve the GM Rewards program (we already made\
  \ some adjustments to 5-star GMs as noted above).</li> \n     <li>I would like to\
  \ see the creation of the three campaign documents that were discussed on the <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2011/april/v5748dyo5lc2m?The-Future-of-Pathfinder-Society-Organized-Play\"\
  >April 4, 2011 blog</a>.</li> \n     <li>Expanding the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >Venture-Captain program</a> to additional areas in North America, as well as increasing\
  \ the number of Venture-Captains internationally.</li> \n     <li>Working with Paizo’\
  s web team to implement a more user-friendly web interface for event coordinators.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Continuing to highlight <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ld7u?Pathfinder-Society-in-the-UK\"\
  >international Pathfinder Society play</a> through monthly blogs.</li>\n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <p>The last six months have been a great learning experience for me. I continue\
  \ to transition from a regional coordinator mindset to one of a global campaign\
  \ administrator. There have been some bumps in the road, but nothing that has proven\
  \ insurmountable. I already knew that the Pathfinder Society community is smart,\
  \ diverse, and very passionate. It is amazing how much energy and enthusiasm you\
  \ all have for the game and it is very inspiring. Likewise, the people here at Paizo\
  \ are some of the most creative and different-thinking people I've ever met. It's\
  \ as amazing as you'd think it would be.</p> \n    <p>I will finish by letting everyone\
  \ know that I will continue to do the best job I can to grow and improve the Pathfinder\
  \ Society campaign. Sometimes I will make mistakes. But, when I do make a mistake,\
  \ I will own up to it. As always, I am available for all of you to reach out to\
  \ me with concerns, criticisms, thoughts, suggestions, venting, and ideas via email,\
  \ private message, Skype, phone call, an in-person visit, carrier pigeon, written\
  \ letter, message spell, pony express, contact other plane spell, or sending spell.</p>\
