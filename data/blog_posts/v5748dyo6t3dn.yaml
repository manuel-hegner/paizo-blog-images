  \   </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">New Year’s first\
  \ fireworks danced across Changdo’s night, their exuberant sparks half-reflected\
  \ upon the Sea of Ghosts. Ling Zhiyu, courtesy name Wenhan, Sixth-Rank Clerk of\
  \ the Ministry of Truth, Junior Secretary of the Lower Oracular Council, set down\
  \ his brush to admire the distant pyrotechnics.</p>\n      <p>This far from the\
  \ city, the celebrations looked almost peaceful. Whenever possible, Zhiyu spent\
  \ New Year here, at this shoreside teahouse, preferring to stay away from the devotees\
  \ jostling to light the auspicious incense to welcome the Eternal Emperor’s spirit,\
  \ away from wending swells of dragon dancers bearing the throne’s five colors, and\
  \ most of all, away from the Ministry of Faith’s magically amplified, self-congratulatory\
  \ platitudes for yet another year of Po Li’s glory.</p>\n      <p>The Sea of Ghosts’\
  \ lapping waves broke the oracle’s reverie, their leisurely cadence not unlike the\
  \ murmuring of some unknown tongue. Zhiyu smiled despite himself. <em>No point thinking\
  \ such dour thoughts during New Year. You'll invite Heaven’s displeasure... and\
  \ more importantly, spoil everyone’s mood here. They’ve suffered enough.</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>Facing the vacuous waters, Zhiyu spoke loudly and clearly to no one at\
  \ all.</p>\n      <p>“Yes, elders. Happy New Year to you too. May your heart realize\
  \ ten thousand desires, may your descendants lead long and healthy lives, may the\
  \ Eternal Emperor hasten your reincarnations for your loyal service. You can see,\
  \ Changdo still stands, bright with lanterns, altars, cooking fires, and fireworks.\
  \ You did not fight the War of Widow-Makers in vain; every New Year is your everlasting\
  \ gift to us all.”</p>\n      <p>The currents settled. His invisible audience seemingly\
  \ placated, Zhiyu returned to his table’s reports, and was pleasantly surprised\
  \ to find the teahouse’s proprietors had discreetly left some fried niangao and\
  \ a fresh pot of aged Tuotuo tea. These refreshments were not unwelcome; there was\
  \ much to attend to, from goiter and beriberi coinciding with recent fads of grain\
  \ diets emulating the Eternal Emperor’s piety; stirring instability in the West\
  \ with Lingshen and Quain; troubling developments on the East with Hwanggot and\
  \ Bachuan. So much to do! But for now, tea and rice cakes. Zhiyu sipped gratefully,\
  \ smiled his thanks to the teahouse’s owners, and returned to his paperwork, as\
  \ fresh fireworks and celebratory songs filled the night.</p>\n      <hr width=\"\
  50%\">\n      <p>“Oracle Ling looks tired. He’s always working so hard, even on\
  \ New Year.”</p>\n      <p>“You know how it is, my beloved. There are some oracles\
  \ who work very hard, because there are so many who don’t...”</p>\n      <p>“Close\
  \ your mouth, my foolish husband. These things! You shouldn’t even think them, let\
  \ alone speak them... nobody, especially us, can afford to pay the price.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>On this solemn note, the teahouse owners’ whispered conversation reached\
  \ a brief lull. Fireworks flared above, in the shape of a celestial peach tree;\
  \ a sign of life’s renewal and promise. Husband and wife contemplated the sky together,\
  \ a shared silence; then, both spoke abruptly at the same time.</p>\n      <p>“\
  Do you suppose we can ask Oracle Ling...”</p>\n      <p>“Maybe it’s as good a time\
  \ as any to ask Oracle Ling...”</p>\n      <p>They laughed quietly at this simultaneous\
  \ blurting of their hearts’ nervousness. Who could blame them? They were but humble\
  \ merchants without clan or fame, whose usual clients were fishers who plied the\
  \ Sea of Ghosts for minnow and perch. Oracle Ling was by far their most prestigious\
  \ guest, a virtuous official without outrageous demands or haughty airs, who paid\
  \ in full and tipped well.</p>\n      <p>To ask an extra favor of him, and especially\
  \ on this New Year, when families traditionally would have their Reunion Dinners,\
  \ and officials would vie to fete the Ministers in grand court banquets... Oracle\
  \ Ling must be truly busy to forsake those commitments and opportunities. What right\
  \ would they have to disturb his schedule with such a selfish request?</p>\n   \
  \   <hr width=\"50%\">\n      <p>Zhiyu yawned as he completed his report on the\
  \ Gokan trafficking of false Po Lian relics and rubbed the poultice of chrysanthemum\
  \ and wolfberry over his tired eyes.</p>\n      <p><em>I suppose it's time.</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>The waves stirred, as if in assent.</p>\n      <p>Zhiyu forced a smile,\
  \ trying to let the wisdom in his mind fade away, to return from realms of divine\
  \ insight dwelled by praiseworthy sages. He stood up quietly and tiptoed to the\
  \ teahouse.</p>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n      <p>“Excuse me.”</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ proprietors nearly jumped from shock. Zhiyu reprimanded himself; he had not wanted\
  \ to cause any disturbance, but alas, that was exactly what had happened. <em>Ah\
  \ well, let's get on with it.</em></p>\n      <p>“Good sir, good madam, I understand\
  \ you would like my help with something. I understand you have a child, of the right\
  \ age for a Test of Fate, and you would like to see what the Heavens are willing\
  \ to reveal about your child’s destiny.”</p>\n      <p>This time, the proprietors\
  \ were truly in shock. How did the esteemed guest know all these? But then, he was\
  \ an oracle...</p>\n      <p>“I understand your grandparents were from Lingshen\
  \ and Quain, who fought here to defend the Imperial City during the War of Widow-Makers...”\
  </p>\n      <p>The wind hissed, like a thousand knives drawn all at once.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“...and your parents stayed behind, but Changdo has not treated you all\
  \ that well. Due to the present... succession disputes. Of things much bigger than\
  \ you or me, our politics, histories, cultures...”</p>\n      <p>The wind stopped\
  \ abruptly, A sleeping waterbird woke in surprise, and uttered a mournful cry.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“...and so, you have no lands, no clans, no names, no sponsors; no choice\
  \ but to take on the regrettable work of doing business on your own. And you wonder...\
  \ will your child inherit the same fate?”</p>\n      <p>Wife and husband nodded\
  \ as one, their eyes red-rimmed and knuckles white-edged.</p>\n      <p>“If you\
  \ will permit me, I will perform the Test of Fate for your child, and let his destiny\
  \ be revealed in Heaven’s gaze. I apologize I must inconvenience you to visit my\
  \ residence, because my luopan, almanacs, yarrow stalks, and other divinatory tools\
  \ are at home.”</p>\n      <p>The couple fell to their knees in gratitude; Zhiyu\
  \ stepped forward to help them back up. As they ambled to the oracle’s tiny manor,\
  \ the night sky above Changdo seemed lighter somehow, and not just for the fireworks\
  \ that flooded its inky expanse.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \
