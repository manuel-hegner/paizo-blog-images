  \ class=\"date\">Friday, April 10, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\">\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've already revealed a ton of cool monsters\
  \ and dungeon dressing from June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>\
  \ set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic\
  \ miniatures, and there are more to come in the weeks between now and the set's\
  \ release. But <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> has more\
  \ than just creepy crawlies, and this week I'd like to focus on two figures from\
  \ the set that are drawn from the fantastic art in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: NPC Codex</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Do you have the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>? I absolutely adore this\
  \ book. Using the ready-made stats provided there has cut my prep time considerably\
  \ in my own games, and it's great to have a whole army of classed characters at\
  \ my fingertips. The book's excellent art is also a great resource for <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>.</p> \n    <p>As I travel around the\
  \ country from convention to convention, I always enjoy chatting with hobby retailers\
  \ and with folks selling our minis at their booths. And they almost always tell\
  \ me the same thing: \"We need more player character minis!\"</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ unusual feedback, from a certain perspective. Hard-core minis collectors are often\
  \ in the opposite camp. Over the years, they've already got a ton of humans, dwarves,\
  \ and elves, and would much prefer that we focus our efforts on monsters, particularly\
  \ monsters than have never before been made in prepainted plastic. Unfortunately,\
  \ you can't run a successful miniatures business catering only to the hard-core\
  \ collectors, as a set filled with nothing but catoblepases and flail snails is\
  \ unlikely to impress the more casual collectors, who outnumber the hard-cores by\
  \ at least an order of magnitude. And yet those hard-core collectors are the heart\
  \ of the line, the folks who keep me always seeking out new and fun things to do\
  \ with the minis line, and who support us release after release.</p> \n    <p>Customers\
  \ at retail stores, generally speaking, come in looking for a figure to represent\
  \ their character (a tough job for a catoblepas). The new <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes</em></a> boxed sets are a good answer to that type of customer,\
  \ but the fact of the matter is that the mainline <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> sets need to serve both constituencies, which means I've\
  \ got my job cut out for me when deciding which player character figures to include\
  \ in a set. Too many, and I lose the hard-core collectors. Too few, and I lose the\
  \ retailers.</p> \n    <p>In this environment, the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"\
  ><em>NPC Codex</em></a> is a godsend. Filled with awesome images of awesome characters,\
  \ it gives me a great chance to pick and choose the figures I think will have the\
  \ most appeal to just about everyone.</p> \n    <p>Here are a couple of my selections\
  \ for <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150410-PaladinAbadar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150410-PaladinAbadar_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This dashing gentleman is the Paladin of Abadar, Golarion's\
  \ god of commerce and law. I've been looking for an excuse to include a \"super\
  \ good guy\" mini in the line for a long time, and when I saw this guy's art on\
  \ page 126 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>, I knew\
  \ I'd found my man. He's perfect for any paladin or armored crusader in your campaign,\
  \ whether as a player character or a haughty, annoying NPC. The Paladin of Abadar\
  \ is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150410-DragonSmiter.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150410-DragonSmiter_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The imposing Dragon Smiter is also a paladin, but you\
  \ wouldn't know that from looking at her. In fact, she's so covered in armor that\
  \ it's difficult to tell much about her at all, except that you definitely don't\
  \ want to get on her bad side. (Honestly, the figure is so heavily armored that\
  \ it works as a male or female, and probably could be a human, elf, or half-elf\
  \ with no one batting an eye.) The Dragon Smiter appears on page 120 of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>, where she's a lawful good human paladin.\
  \ For my money, she could just as easily be a villain. Either way, she looks cooool.\
  \ The Dragon Smiter is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here's a shot of both final figures together, haunting\
  \ a plant in my office. I think they came out great!</p> \n    <p>See you next week\
  \ for another look at upcoming figures from the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> line!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div>\
