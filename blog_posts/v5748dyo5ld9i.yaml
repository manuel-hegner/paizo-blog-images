  date\">Friday, March 23, 2012</p> \n    <p>Ardent followers of our Friday Pathfinder\
  \ Battles preview blog surely noticed its absence last week, when necessity pulled\
  \ me away to the wild frontier of Las Vegas for the GAMA Trade Show, an important\
  \ game industry event that draws publishers, distributors, and retailers from around\
  \ the country. While at GTS, I had a chance to sit down and chat with my counterpart\
  \ over at WizKids, and our discussion covered where the Pathfinder Battles line\
  \ has been, and where it's headed in the future.</p> \n    <p>We spoke for the first\
  \ time about the set <i>after</i> the next set (which we haven't even announced\
  \ yet, but which is already in sculpting!). Sales have been strong for the line,\
  \ and retailer comments at the show were very positive.</p> \n    <p>WizKids leaked\
  \ a few details about Pathfinder Battles at a GTS presentation, including that the\
  \ Rise of the Runelords set will have two booster configurations. The Standard Booster\
  \ contains four figures, one Large and three either Medium or Small. The set also\
  \ contains four Huge figures, sold in random single-figure Huge Boosters. Unlike\
  \ with <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, these two booster\
  \ configurations will come in two different case sizes, so that retailers (and customers)\
  \ will be able to re-order the size of booster that they need.</p> \n    <p>Although\
  \ we are very, very close to being able to reveal specific details about price and\
  \ availability, we still lack a couple of pieces of critical information that are\
  \ preventing us from posting the product page so you can preorder these exciting\
  \ figures right this very second. I expect that to change very soon, so keep your\
  \ eyes on this space!</p> \n    <p>At the GAMA Trade Show, WizKids also revealed\
  \ the worst-kept secret of the line, finally officially identifying the set's premium\
  \ miniature: the Rune Giant! This gorgeous Gargantuan figure towers over Medium,\
  \ Large, and even Huge figures, and with his enormous sword he cuts an imposing\
  \ figure on your game table.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120323-RuneGiant.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120323-RuneGiant_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The final miniature will have elaborate\
  \ tattoos all over his skin, inspired by the original rune giant art by Wayne Reynolds.\
  \ That's the Vampire from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>\
  \ down there by the Rune Giant's shin. I thought you guys would appreciate a sense\
  \ of just how big this figure is relative to, say, a player character miniature.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Like the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mwc\">Huge Black Dragon</a> of Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters, this figure is produced in extremely limited quantities, and will\
  \ be available to purchase by customers who subscribe or preorder cases of Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Standard Boosters (as well as through select retailers). Details\
  \ on pricing and exactly how you can be sure not to miss this amazing figure will\
  \ come shortly.</p> \n    <p>WizKids also revealed another much-anticipated figure,\
  \ the rare Runelord Karzoug the Claimer, arch-villain of the entire Rise of the\
  \ Runelords campaign!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120323-Karzoug.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120323-Karzoug_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>This pose was drawn from a chapter-opener image from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>, depicting Karzoug in battle against\
  \ a hated foe. Both the magical spell effect launching from Karzoug's left hand\
  \ and the flames of his pole-arm are rendered in tinted clear plastic, adding to\
  \ the energy effect. With gorgeous fine detailed painting along the hem and embroidery\
  \ of his robes and lavishly detailed equipment and clothing features, this is a\
  \ miniature your players will long remember and really relish defeating.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Lastly this week, I wanted to show off a figure that WizKids <i>didn't</i>\
  \ reveal at the GAMA Trade Show. I wanted to pick a monster, and I wanted to pick\
  \ something distinctly <i>Pathfinder</i>, something emblematic of the Pathfinder\
  \ brand that maybe wouldn't have ever appeared if not for the original Rise of the\
  \ Runelords campaign.</p> \n    <p>I decided on this guy, the brutal Sinspawn Axeman.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120323-Sinspawn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120323-Sinspawn_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>This miniature is an armored, souped-up version of the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/2012/january/v5748dyo5ld20\">Sinspawn miniature we previewed weeks ago</a>.\
  \ As the campaign gets tougher, the player characters actually fight more of these\
  \ axe-wielders than they do the regular type from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary</i></a>, which is one reason we've put both of them\
  \ in the common rarity.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week! We've still got plenty\
  \ more awesome figures to preview in the weeks and months to come, as well as a\
  \ lot more specifics on price, exact configuration, and other important details.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until then, we'll see you next week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
