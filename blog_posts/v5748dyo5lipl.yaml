  \ courtesy of Nathan Peever.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>This past weekend I attended\
  \ Emerald City Comic Con with over 80,000 other people! While not the largest convention\
  \ I've participated in, it is in the top three (among Fan Expo Canada with 127,000\
  \ and Gen Con at 197,695 attendees). All three are huge conventions with a varied\
  \ fan base!</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">This weekend volunteers and Paizo\
  \ staff came together to run Pathfinder Society events in the Sheraton Grand Ballroom.\
  \ Except for the early morning hours, we consistently filled our tables and worked\
  \ hard to get games going quickly. Some of our attendees enjoyed the Adventure Card\
  \ Game so much they came back the next day to play through the Season of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure 1. Several other groups went directly from our tables to on-site retailers\
  \ and bought the <em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em> with the intent to start\
  \ playing back home.</p> \n    <p>Over the weekend, I managed a couple of breaks\
  \ and visited other areas of the convention. While I didn't see any of the Pathfinder\
  \ iconics running around, there was plenty of other great cosplay abound! Pockets\
  \ of people formed as people took photos of some truly awesome concoctions of fabric,\
  \ foam, and makeup. Seas of people filled the dealers hall and artist alley. Their\
  \ talent amazes me and I could stand for hours looking at their work.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>But Emerald City Comic Con is just one topic for this week. Let's shift gears\
  \ to a topic that's been cropping up on the forums: the expense and difficulty of\
  \ attending conventions. Some Pathfinders desire the rewards of attending conventions,\
  \ namely boons, but couldn't see a way past the barriers blocking their path. On\
  \ the organizational side, we receive requests for convention support from events\
  \ that don't meet the requirements for venue or size. We don't like saying \"no\"\
  \ to these events, so we put our heads together, and developed a \"Game Day\" program\
  \ to augment our convention support program.</p> \n    <p>It took a few months to\
  \ get the details hammered out on who qualifies, what they receive, and support\
  \ distribution methods. We came up with a flexible program that allows us to tailor\
  \ our response based on the region and needs of the community. The Game Day program\
  \ supports three non-convention venues—the venue that is a consistently strong performer\
  \ that needs recognition for its accomplishments, the venue that is new and could\
  \ use support to establish itself, and those events that are not quite conventions\
  \ because they occur in retail establishments or are just under the table requirements.\
  \ All Game Days still must follow the requirement of being open to the public, registered\
  \ on paizo.com, and having some form of online advertisement.</p> \n    <p>We decided\
  \ the Regional Venture-Coordinators (RVC) know their areas best, so they should\
  \ choose Game Days under the new program. Each RVC gets 10 such events a quarter.\
  \ We chose 10 as a baseline number until we can see the reach of the program and\
  \ identify the regional needs. The RVC works with the event organizer in establishing\
  \ goals based off of attendance, event offerings, and community needs. Each Game\
  \ Day should have a basic, stretch, and super stretch goal. Rewards in the form\
  \ of player and GM boons scale with the goals, with all Game Days getting the basic\
  \ Tier 3 rewards. If a Game Day meets its stretch goals, then they earn Tier 2 rewards,\
  \ just as super stretch equals Tier 1.</p> \n    <p>It is my pleasure to introduce\
  \ the first of our game days. For the second quarter of 2016, the Southeastern region\
  \ named Cool Kids Excelsior 2nd Anniversary Bash from April 29-May 1 in Hoover,\
  \ Alabama, as one of their not-quite-a-con Game Days, as it is held in a retail\
  \ location. Point of contact is Venture-Captain Mike Seales. The second Southeastern\
  \ Game Day is TriCon from April 23-24, 2016, in High Point, North Carolina. Once\
  \ again, it is an event in a retail location. Venture-Lieutenant Landon Hatfield\
  \ is leading this event. Both of these Game Days are on the event locator here on\
  \ the website; if you want more details check them out! The Western-Europe/Middle\
  \ East region named one Game Day: Madrid, Spain, is hosting reoccurring game day.\
  \ The first was April 2-3 and saw 10 tables of <i>Siege of Serpents</i> and a few\
  \ other games. The next occurrence is April 30, when they plan to run introduction\
  \ events in four different locations across Madrid. For more information, contact\
  \ Venture-Captain Tesifonte Negro Gonzalez. Venture-Officer emails are on the <a\
  \ href=\"/regionalCoordinators\">Regional Coordinators page</a>. I look forward\
  \ to announcing more Game Days as the program grows!</p> \n    <p>Finally, I would\
  \ like to apologize to the three individuals who entered the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild accessory contest. I didn't take my travel schedule into account when\
  \ I set the submission deadline, and was out of the office when the deadline occurred.\
  \ But, late is better than never! We had three submissions of three unique accessories.\
  \ Voting opens today and closes it on Friday, April 15th. Winners will be announced\
  \ in the blog on Monday, April 18th! Please take a moment and vote for your favorite!</p>\
