  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">A couple of weeks ago we answered\
  \ the question, “What is Mythic?” That answer spoke to the foundational mythic rules\
  \ you can find in <em>War of Immortals</em>, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only\
  \ possible answer to the question.</p>\n      <p>The base system for mythic characters\
  \ tracks alongside your character’s level. At low levels, mythic power is explosive;\
  \ though highly limited in its applications, it provides a significant change in\
  \ outcome when it’s applied. As you level up, your mythic power becomes more predictable\
  \ and you gain access to a wider array of possible applications, but the degree\
  \ to which it shifts the dial of success normalizes somewhat, reflecting the character’\
  s growth into a mature mythic figure capable of reliably battling mythic threats.\
  \ This was not the only concept for how mythic rules could be deployed, however.\
  \ While working on this project, we imagined several alternative ways people might\
  \ want to experience the mythic system.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \     <p>What if you wanted to have an experience where you had one mythic character\
  \ surrounded by a group of highly competent non-mythic characters, a la cult classic\
  \ cartoon <em>Mighty Max</em>? What if you want the pacing of the mythic elements\
  \ of your story to exist separately from standard level-based progression, either\
  \ having your mythic power grow more slowly or instead having your mythic power\
  \ outpace your level for more high-risk/high-octane adventures?</p>\n      <p>While\
  \ we think that the mythic rules published in <em>War of Immortals</em> represent\
  \ the ideal version of the system as we would like people to experience it, we wrote\
  \ all kinds of alternate ideas that didn’t match that experience and didn’t fit\
  \ inside what was already an impressively meaty book. Rather than letting those\
  \ ideas gather dust in an untouched folder, we thought we’d share them with you!</p>\n\
  \      <p>On the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq06sfx?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals\"\
  ><em>War of Immortals</em> product page</a>, you’ll find a link to a web PDF product\
  \ titled “<a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/PZO12006AlternateMythicRules.pdf\"\
  >Mythic Variant Rules</a>” that gives you a variety of new ways to play with the\
  \ mythic system in your home games! These rules aren’t necessarily as stable a table\
  \ experience as the ones we printed in the main book, but we expect that the right\
  \ group might find them invaluable and a great way to push the boundaries of the\
  \ game. We’ve also made sure to attach the ORC license to this product, to ensure\
  \ easy use of these alternate rules and ideas by any 3pp contributors out there!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Pop on over to the product page, preorder <em>War of Immortals</em> if\
  \ you haven’t already, and download this free expansion product today! You’ll also\
  \ notice that while we were putting this PDF together, we went ahead and slipped\
  \ in a handful of clarifications onto the final page to make your battles in the\
  \ War of Immortals just a little bit smoother and easier to use.</p>\n      <p style=\"\
