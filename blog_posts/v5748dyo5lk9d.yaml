  \ class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 15, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Back in July, the organized play team launched\
  \ an exciting contest called <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty\"\
  >Leaders in Liberty</a> to name and detail a new character in <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/rpg\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> canon. We read the entries, narrowed it\
  \ down to our top picks, and invited the community to vote on the best candidate.\
  \ In mid October we had our winner, Karisa Starsight as presented by Sam Sampson!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When we first launched the contest, we were a little coy about exactly\
  \ how this character might feature in the campaign. We were, after all, several\
  \ weeks away from releasing <a href=\"/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a>, which\
  \ provides considerably more context. If you haven't played it yet, I both strongly\
  \ encourage that you do so, and I will be providing only the slimmest spoilers (you\
  \ can see more in the spoil-tagged section below). Namely, Major Colson Maldris\
  \ is not currently available to provide the Liberty's Edge faction the necessary\
  \ guidance and oversight. While this faction is likely one of the best equipped\
  \ to operate without a leader, we want to bring in someone who can not only provide\
  \ leadership in the difficult time, but also guide the faction's vision and steer\
  \ its reforms in the wake of Maldris's rather spotty legacy.</p> <b>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #9-02 Spoiler</b>: \n    <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" onclick=\"\
  toggleSpoiler(this)\"> \n    <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n     <p>Major Colson\
  \ Maldris has gone missing, and it seems he's enlisted some very questionable allies.\
  \ Without an appointed leader, the Liberty's Edge faction needs someone to keep\
  \ the operation running smoothly and coordinate the hunt for Maldris.</p> \n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>That's right, we're asking you to help pick a faction leader.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We have two candidates, whose backstories I'll summarize below along\
  \ with a snapshot of their strengths and style. The first is Leaders in Liberty\
  \ contest winner Karisa Starsight, who you can read about in more detail <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk4a?Leaders-in-Liberty-Voting-Now-Open\">in this September\
  \ blog</a>. The second is Tamrin Credence, a halfling smuggler and freelance freedom\
  \ fighter. Let's meet them both.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0825E-Bonuwat.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0825E-Bonuwat_120.jpeg\"></a> \n\
  \      <p><i>Illustration by Tom Ventre</i></p> \n     </div> \n     <h3>Karisa\
  \ Starsight</h3> \n     <p>The slaver Kolm Redarax found the infant Karisa aboard\
  \ a derelict Bonuwat ship, and he was so taken by her unexplained presence and strikingly\
  \ blue eyes that he adopted her as his daughter. She worked hard aboard that ship,\
  \ tending to the slaves her adoptive father shuttled from port to port. Whereas\
  \ he saw these souls as chattel, she quietly grew to respect and pity them. As she\
  \ reached adulthood, Karisa struggled between her love and loyalty for her father\
  \ and the plights of the people he bought and sold.</p> \n     <p>Several years\
  \ ago, Andoren privateers known as the Gray Corsairs assaulted their ship, subduing\
  \ the crew and freeing the slaves. When the Corsairs' captain was on the verge of\
  \ slaying Redarax, Karisa intervened, swearing her own life, service, and freedom\
  \ to Andoran in exchange for his life. Not want to condemn the young woman to anything\
  \ resembling slavery, the captain provided a different offer: she could instead\
  \ apprentice to an upstanding Eagle Knight, and Redarax would live out his sentence\
  \ in an Andoren prison. Karisa eagerly accepted.</p> \n     <p>Her mentor was none\
  \ other than Major Colson Maldris, and she has excelled as his aide. Over the past\
  \ year, her duties have more resembled those of a steward, overseeing some of the\
  \ Liberty's Edge faction's operations while Maldris traveled farther afield. Even\
  \ so, there's a side of Maldris that she's only now uncovering as she tries to find\
  \ his current whereabouts and holds together the initiatives he set in motion. All\
  \ the while she wonders at the irony that no matter his morals, Karisa's father\
  \ is in chains while she promotes liberty in the Inner Sea region and beyond.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Strengths</b>: Karisa Starsight has a much more intimate familiarity\
  \ with the faction's operations, which inclines her toward making changes and executing\
  \ missions \"within the system\" while also watching for hypocrisies that undermine\
  \ the faction's goals. She has solid connections within the Eagle Knights without\
  \ being one herself. She's also the more self-reflective candidate, likely to examine\
  \ the faction's moral pillars and assess how the faction could do better. Even so,\
  \ her childhood on the seas leaves her ready to tackle threats head-on when needed.</p>\
  \ \n     <hr> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0718E-TamrinCredence.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0718E-TamrinCredence_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Kenneth Camaro</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3\
  \ class=\"spaced-header-small\">Tamrin Credence</h3> \n     <p>Trained as a sommelier,\
  \ butler, and shopping assistant, the halfling now known as Tamrin Credence spent\
  \ his first 26 years as a Chelish slave, albeit a well-treated one. When a tiller\
  \ (a member of the halfling liberation group called the Bellflower Network) infiltrated\
  \ the estate and laid plans to lead a few halfling slaves to freedom, Tamrin made\
  \ a counter-offer: he would create a distraction so the tiller could escape with\
  \ twice as many souls. The plan worked, albeit at a cost. By the time the tiller\
  \ returned to lead him out of Cheliax, the halfling butler had received many scars\
  \ for his deception.</p> \n     <p>Tamrin Credence is a self-styled name that the\
  \ halfling adopted in the decade since, both to distance him emotionally from his\
  \ subjugated past and to create a new identity that wouldn't lead to his recapture.\
  \ He's continued to assist the Bellflower Network as a spy and supplier, often leading\
  \ him into dangerous territory or treacherous relationships. Although he's infiltrated\
  \ and worked with the Aspis Consortium and Cheliax's port authorities to this end,\
  \ his most infamous rivalry is that with Zarta Dralneen, whom he regularly undermined\
  \ while she served Cheliax as that nation's liaison to the Pathfinder Society. Only\
  \ once she fell from Cheliax's good graces, suffered unforgiveable offenses by her\
  \ former allies, and sought refuge with the Society did the two agents begin finding\
  \ common ground. They've now worked together on coordinating several missions, though\
  \ years of thwarting each other's ambitions leave them prone to verbally sniping\
  \ at each other over unresolved gripes they're yet to bury.</p> \n     <p>Tamrin's\
  \ experience with the Liberty's Edge faction is modest, having only worked with\
  \ Major Colson Maldris a few times before the former began more concerted collaboration\
  \ in the past 18 months. Even so, he's a proud \"liberator of humanoid assets\"\
  \ with criminal and business contacts in dozens of cities. What he lacks in faction\
  \ experience, he makes up for in gutsiness, survivability, cunning, and a willingness\
  \ to lead from the front as needed.</p> \n     <p><b>Strengths</b>: Tamrin Credence\
  \ is a pragmatic individual who doesn't mind breaking a few unreasonable rules if\
  \ he can mitigate the harm to innocent bystanders and maximize the benefit for oppressed\
  \ people. He's witnessed the dark underbelly of several infamous operations firsthand,\
  \ and he knows that no matter how seductive those groups might seem at times, they're\
  \ ultimately immoral. These experiences have left him hardened against corruption,\
  \ and he takes a more decisive stance on correcting the faction's embarrassing past\
  \ misdeeds. He has strong Bellflower Network connections, though he would broaden\
  \ his agenda considerably if made the leader of Liberty's Edge.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <h2>Voting</h2> \n    <p>Voting begins now! Let us know which of these two\
  \ candidates should step up to lead the Liberty's Edge faction in Major Colson Maldris's\
  \ absence. You'll have three weeks to pick your favorite candidate, and the winner\
  \ will be announced on <b>Wednesday, December 13</b>. Our plan is to feature both\
  \ of these characters at least once, so even the candidate that doesn't receive\
  \ the most votes will still play a role in a future scenario. We're also looking\
  \ forward to pursuing more of the Liberty's Edge storyline later in Season 9, discovering\
  \ just what Maldris has set in motion!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
