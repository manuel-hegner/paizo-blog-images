              <h1>Celebrating Women’s History Month 2025</h1>
              <p><em>Thursday, March 20, 2025</em></p>
              <p>Greetings, ‘Finders!<br>
                March is Women’s History Month here in the United States, and to celebrate and recognize the women who make our games happen, we’ve welcomed Paizo contributors who identify as women (inclusive of trans, cis, and nonbinary identities) to share their experiences, wisdom, and projects on the blog!</p>
              <p>This year’s theme for Women’s History Month is “Moving Forward Together—Women Educating and Inspiring Generations.” Some of our contributors have used this theme to shape their submissions.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Ivis Flanagan (she/they)</h3>
              <p>Have you ever looked up to someone and said, “I could NEVER do that?” I know I have.<br><br>
                I spent years having the boys I hung out with beat into my head that “girls just can’t play RPGs” by repeatedly ensuring my characters died every time I joined them. Then, years later, one of my closest friends, Sean Duncan, pulled me out of a nap and into my first Pathfinder game. I fell in love with it, from the mechanics to the setting—all of it. Then some friends encouraged me to go to my first convention, where I meant Heather Vigil, the first female GM I’d ever seen, and I thought, “Wow, I could never do that.” She and I became fast friends, and she was the one who eventually convinced me I was good enough to GM—which I again fell in love with, soon after becoming a Venture Agent in Organized Play.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>This attitude of “I could never do that” continued to precede me as I volunteered for conventions, then started taking on more and more leadership roles in Organized Play until I became the first female RVC (there's been two more since!). It was through this work that I met some amazing femme people: Hillary Moon Murphy, Kate Baker, Isis Woz, Katrina Hennessy, and Jessica Redekop, to name just a few. They encouraged me to reach out and start sharing my writing, which allowed me to get my foot in the door and contribute to the works of multiple companies, including Paizo.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Fast forward to last year, when Paizo posted a designer position with the Rules and Lore team. Again, my brain flipped back to the old belief that “I could never do that,” a thought put there all those years ago by that group of gatekeeping guys. However, with encouragement from the same friends who had supported me along the way, and with the support of a few new ones like Alex Speidel and Shay Snow, I decided to throw the proverbial snowball into hell and see where it went. Asmodeus likes snow cones, it seems, because against all the odds in my brain, here I am, the newest member of the Rules and Lore team, loving what I do every day.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I tell you my journey to say this: gaming is for everyone, and in supporting each other, we will see this space and our representation in it continue to flourish. More than anything, I’ve learned that to properly break down barriers to inclusivity, we can’t just say we support one another—we have to show it. And you know what? It’s true: girls don’t just play games—we run them, we organize them, and we create them, too. If you ever want to reach out, either for encouragement or because you’d like help finding ways to get involved, my DMs are open. You can find me on Bluesky, Discord, and the Paizo Forums as NorthernDreamer.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Katrina Hennessy (she/they)</h3>
              <p>I’d like to take a moment or two to highlight some women who have influenced me and helped me to be where I am today.</p>
              <p>The less open-minded mother of one of my high school friends said to her one day, “I know there is a science fiction convention in town, but you’re not going!” This drove my wonderful, open-minded, and supportive mother to organize a small group of us to attend Swancon 2, the second annual science fiction convention in Western Australia. There, we were introduced to the relatively new game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and met Uma, who was welcoming and supportive of us teens and a gracious example of how to exist in this male-dominated industry.</p>
              <p>While there were other women along the way, as I played various RPGs through the decades, they were not frequent. In 2017, when I was introduced to Paizo Organized Play, this changed. Dorothy was one of my first GMs and a role model on how to be a firm and fair Game Master while remaining welcoming newcomers and making sure they received appropriate guidance. I also met Hilary, an exuberant and fun GM who was active at spreading Play-by-Post and good at turning insufficient reluctance into an active Venture Officer. There was also Kate, who was not only a great GM but an active freelancer who encouraged others along that path.</p>
              <p>Over the course of these years, I also came across Vanessa, whom I first met as a roommate at Origins and who has helped me in so many ways to break my own barriers and grow as a community member and as a freelancer. She set an example of hard work and integrity in the games industry as freelancer, Paizo Developer, and now with Wizards of the Coast. I would also like to mention Ivis and Nicole, who actively participated in so much and took on more and more while remaining friendly, supportive, and welcoming. Though life seems to have moved Nicole elsewhere, I observed as Ivis continued to blossom and is now a Paizo developer.</p>
              <p>I thank each of them and the many others who have had a positive impact on me along the way. I strive to also be welcoming and supportive of all who wish to play, GM, write, or otherwise be involved in our wonderful gaming community.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they/he)</h3>
              <p>Sara Jeffers is a Two-Spirit member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in what is now known as Washington and British Columbia. Their heritage and culture influence not only her graphic and narrative designs but also his approaches in problem-solving and community building. She is proud to be a Woman in Gaming and to be helping&nbsp;the next generation of creatives through Girl Scouts.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>
              <p>When I found out about&nbsp;<em>PathfinderLost Omens Rival Academies</em>, I jumped at the chance to be Edit Co-Lead. Working on the book was a way of going back to my professional roots. For over a decade, I worked in higher education as an interfaith, service learning, and diversity and inclusion educator—a role that included developing and implementing training programs for students (and sometimes staff) as well as directly supporting students of marginalized identities. Though I enjoyed being in the classroom, what I loved most was working with students one-on-one. When I was in college, I had a mentor whose support changed my life; once I was in the position to do the same for my students, it became the driving force of my career.</p>
              <p>I left university life years ago, but the relationships remain. I’ve kept every letter and card I received at graduation or other milestones, and I’m still close to several of my former students. Few things bring me such joy as seeing them thrive out in the world as the leaders and changemakers I knew they could be.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p>This month and every month, Paizo appreciates all the women who have built our industry and continue to expand on our worlds! Thank you for being a part of Paizo and for bringing new faces to the table for years to come.</p>
