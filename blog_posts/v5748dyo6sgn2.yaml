  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It seems like forever ago that we first introduced\
  \ the iconic characters who have since come to embody the amazing adventures that\
  \ make Pathfinder the beloved game it has become. First among them, was the iconic\
  \ fighter, Valeros, who made his debut just over 12 years ago, on May 7, 2007. Since\
  \ then, he's gotten a more thorough Meet the Iconics introduction, and featured\
  \ in three Pathfinder Legends adventure path adaptations and nearly 50 issues of\
  \ Pathfinder comics, making him one of the most omnipresent iconic characters around.\
  \ That doesn't mean his story's over, however, as we've got another exciting tale\
  \ featuring his antics below. Enjoy the following piece of short fiction from James\
  \ L. Sutter in the next entry into our series of Iconic Encounters—brief vignettes\
  \ of the iconic characters showcasing the myriad stories you can tell with Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20190516-Encounter.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Hai Hoang</p> \n    </div> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>The soldier had been staring at him from the corner for the last two\
  \ drinks. Now at last she stood and moved his direction, plate armor hanging heavily\
  \ from her broad shoulders.</p> \n     <p>Valeros smiled. Big was good—he liked\
  \ a woman who could throw him around a little.</p> \n     <p>Then the two soldiers\
  \ with her stood, and his smile faded. He could work with that if it came to it,\
  \ but it wasn't really his first choice.</p> \n     <p>Then she reached into the\
  \ shadows beneath a table and withdrew a greatsword, the steel sliding free of its\
  \ sheath with a whispered song, and Valeros was forced to concede that maybe the\
  \ night wasn't going his way after all.</p> \n     <p>\"Valeros of Andoran,\" the\
  \ woman thundered. \"For crimes against the Empire of Cheliax, I hereby place you\
  \ under arrest.\"</p> \n     <p>Damn. Valeros had seen the sigils on their armor,\
  \ but they were a long way from Cheliax, and he'd thought she'd been interested\
  \ in his hair, not his history.</p> \n     <p>He took a sip from his mug and eyed\
  \ her sword. \"I thought we were supposed to check our weapons at the door.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You are,\" the woman said, and all three of the soldiers grinned wolfishly.\
  \ \"It makes our job easier.\"</p> \n     <p>Valeros sighed. He'd really been hoping\
  \ for a different sort of tussle tonight. He sagged, folding his arms tiredly over\
  \ the shield propped against the side of his chair.</p> \n     <p>\"Well,\" he observed,\
  \ \"good thing this isn't really a weapon, then.\"</p> \n     <p>The shield's metal\
  \ edge slammed up beneath the first soldier's chin, snapping his head back and sending\
  \ him sprawling across a nearby table. Valeros's chair followed him, spinning out\
  \ into the other two and fouling them up long enough for Valeros to slip his arm\
  \ through the shield's leather straps.</p> \n     <p>He brought it back around just\
  \ in time to catch the scything stroke of the woman's blade, barely managing to\
  \ turn it aside. Beer sloshed from the mug in his free hand.</p> \n     <p>\"Hey!\"\
  \ he yelled. \"I paid for that!\"</p> \n     <p>\"You'll pay for more than that!\"\
  \ The woman hammered the sword down again. The force of the blow dented steel, sending\
  \ a shock of pain up Valeros's shield arm, followed by a more concerning numbness.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Yeah, to hell with this.\" Valeros rammed the shield into the woman's\
  \ chest, pulling her backward. He started to take a swing at the other soldier,\
  \ only to remember he still held his tankard. He turned the blow into an elbow strike,\
  \ slamming his armor into the man's cheekbone.</p> \n     <p>The huge sword—and\
  \ really, what kind of overcompensating barbarian fought with something that large?—\
  struck again, crashing down like a falling tree. It was too much for the shield:\
  \ one of the leather straps popped free, leaving Valeros holding the military equivalent\
  \ of an oversized serving platter.</p> \n     <p>\"Stupid shield!\" Valeros flung\
  \ it aside, then spun around behind the soldier with the busted cheek, grabbing\
  \ him in a chokehold and putting him between Valeros and the swordswoman. \"Meat's\
  \ the best shield, anyway.\"</p> \n     <p>The swordswoman paused, calculating the\
  \ probability of beheading Valeros without hurting her comrade. Or possibly evaluating\
  \ how much she liked said comrade—Chelaxians were a tough bunch like that. Either\
  \ way, it gave Valeros a moment to breathe, and he took the opportunity to take\
  \ a drink from his tankard.</p> \n     <p>And got nothing. In growing horror, he\
  \ looked down into the empty mug, then at the dark trail of beer across the sawdust-covered\
  \ floor.</p> \n     <p>The last of his good mood slipped away. He squeezed his captive's\
  \ neck tighter, leaning down to speak directly into the terrified soldier's ear.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You broke my shield,\" he whispered. \"That's annoying, but fixable.\
  \ That beer, though...\" He flexed, and the man's limbs began flailing frantically.\
  \ \"That beer is gone forever...\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If you enjoyed\
  \ this week's entry into the Iconic Encounters series, be sure to check back next\
  \ week for the series' conclusion with a story featuring the iconic goblin alchemist,\
  \ Fumbus! Until then, Pathfinders, keep your shield ready and your tankards full.</p>\
