  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">This encounter serves as a\
  \ prequel to the <em>Mechageddon!</em> Adventure Path, framed as the player characters\
  \ (PCs) trying out an arcade game that doubles as a recruitment tool for the elite\
  \ Daimalkan mech corps known as the New Valor Defense Force. Run this encounter\
  \ during downtime when the PCs are exploring a space station or city. The PCs might\
  \ be invited to play through a Valko Derby simulation at an arcade, a recruitment\
  \ center, a festival, or a resort on Daimalko or anywhere in the galaxy—whatever\
  \ makes the most sense for your campaign.</p>\n      <h3>Valko Derby — CR (varies)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Valkopods—more often called mech pods in the Pact Worlds—are specialty\
  \ game consoles found at high-end arcades, military recruitment centers, trade shows,\
  \ and in the homes of some affluent collectors. The 6-foot half-globe pods are constructed\
  \ of durable plastics with transparent aluminum and structural steel frames. The\
  \ pods are programmed to simulate the experience of being in the cockpit of a mech,\
  \ starship, or other war vehicle. Hyper-realistic terrain and foes generated by\
  \ the simulation provide a challenge for the operator, and the simulation provides\
  \ a score based on the operator’s reactions and maneuvers.</p>\n      <p>Valkpods\
  \ aren’t just for fun. A form of this technology is used for military training in\
  \ the Pact Worlds, Veskarium, and on Daimalko, where the tech was initially tested.\
  \ Networking connections allow many pods to sync simulations for large-scale experiences\
  \ while the simulated feeds are broadcast to viewing terminals, betting houses,\
  \ and infosphere sites. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>\n\
  \      <center>\n       <hr width=\"50%\">\n      </center>\n      <blockquote>\n\
  \       <p>Holos blast a hypercolored message above a row of globular arcade cabinets,\
  \ each large enough for a person of any conceivable anatomy to fit comfortably inside.\
  \ “Mech pods—Play Now!” The signs repeating flash is accompanied by booming music\
  \ and the roar of simulated laser cannons. A humanoid pilot dressed in a red and\
  \ white suit stands outside the massive cabinets. A crowd of excited people bustle\
  \ around her. “Hey there! Ever ride in a mech before?” She calls. “Now’s your chance.\
  \ Our sponsor, Apex, installed this set of networked valkopods—you call them mech\
  \ pods in the Pact Worlds. Apex engineers programmed a special simulation just for\
  \ today: A demolition derby! Want to play?”</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <center>\n\

  \      <br>\n      <p><strong>Resa \"Firefight\"&nbsp;Prosst</strong> (LN female\
  \ ifrit) is a decorated pilot. After acing her training, she was promoted quickly\
  \ to squad leadership and earned a role as DCVG (Deputy Commander Valko Group) of\
  \ the 3rd Battlegroup of the New Valor Defense Force, a military sworn to protect\
  \ the city of New Valor from rampaging colossi. She’s not just here for public relations—\
  she’s tasked with recruiting high-scoring players to join up with the NVDF.</p>\n\
  \      <p>On Daimalko, huzkars (the local name for mech pilots) are minor celebrities\
  \ as well as military personnel. Most Daimalkans regard mech pilots as heroes since\
  \ many are injured or even perish defending cities from colossi, terrifying monsters\
  \ that move through populated settlements like unstoppable forces of nature. Without\
  \ mechs, Daimalko would be unlivable; in fact, the entire planet was decimated by\
  \ the colossi’s first emergence many years ago. Rebuilding has only been possible\
  \ because of organizations like the NVDF.</p>\n      <h3>Derby Rules</h3>\n    \
  \  <p>Once the derby program loads, the PCs find themselves virtually piloting humanoid-shaped\
  \ Daimalkan mechs within a massive digital stadium divided into zones by glowing\
  \ markings. Each team begins the match in the goal zone that matches their team’\
  s colors. The PCs are blue and begin in the southern zone. Enemy players’ mechs\
  \ are red and begin in the northern zone.</p>\n      <p>As soon as the starting\
  \ siren sounds, the teams can move around the map and engage their foes. Roll initiative\
  \ to determine the order in which players and enemies act. Teams score points in\
  \ two ways. If a mech makes it to the opposing goal, the pilot scores 2 points for\
  \ their team. If a pilot scores a final blow on an enemy mech (destroying it), they\
  \ score 4 points for their team. If a mech is destroyed, it cannot score points\
  \ even if it is already inside the enemy goal, and that player (PC or enemy) is\
  \ out of the battle for the remainder of the match. During the match, a glowing\
  \ holographic display above the simulated stadium displays each team’s current score.\
  \ Once all mechs on one team have been defeated or six rounds have passed, the match\
  \ ends. The entire field glows in the winning team’s colors as a victory celebration\
  \ and final scores are displayed.</p>\n      <p><strong>The Map:</strong> This simulation\
  \ uses the digital side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Stadium</em>. One square on\
  \ the map represents 10 feet to accommodate the Huge combatants. The programmed\
  \ terrain simulates a massive sports arena. Once the match begins, the tiered bleachers\
  \ are filled with a simulated audience. Any mech that moves into (or is forced into)\
  \ spaces outside the play area and into the crowd suffers an automatic system failure\
  \ based on the chart found in <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution </em>page 114. Enemy\
  \ mechs forced into the crowd are staggered until they return to the play area.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The glowing circle in the middle of the arena temporarily boosts a mech’\
  s movement speed. Whenever a mech begins its turn inside the circle, the mech’s\
  \ base speed increases by 10 feet.</p>\n      <p><strong>PCs and Mechs:</strong>\
  \ This encounter is designed for four 1st-level characters. The mech pods are programmed\
  \ to use simulated representations of dozens of different mechs, but for this program,\
  \ all players use the same type of mech: the duello class valko. For the duration\
  \ of the simulation, the PCs’ mechs have blue glowing stripes to differentiate them\
  \ from their opponents, which are red. If you’d prefer to adapt the simulation for\
  \ different mech models, the PCs can instead build tier 1 mechs using the rules\
  \ in <em>Tech Revolution</em>.</p>\n      <p>The basic duello class mech is detailed\
  \ below.</p>\n      <h3>Duello Class Valko — Tier 1</h3>\n      <p>Huge skirmisher<br><strong>Operators</strong>\

  \ 15 ft.; <strong>Reach</strong> 15 ft. (20 ft. with scythe)<br><strong>Strength</strong>\
  \ +4</p>\n      <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> The simulation always pits teams\
  \ against their each other in even numbers. So, for each PC, one opposing duello\
  \ mech appears with red glowing stripes inside the opposing goal. The enemy mechs\
  \ are piloted by other players in their own valkopods networked together with the\
  \ PC’s valkopods.</p>\n      <p>As soon as the sirens denote the start of the derby,\
  \ the two duello opponents on the outside edges of the opposing team run up the\
  \ sides of the arena. They intend to get to the blue goal as fast as possible and\
  \ lend fire support to their allies from there. The remaining enemy mechs choose\
  \ individual targets, focusing on PCs who lead the charge across the arena. They\
  \ use up as much ammo as possible from a distance before switching to scythes for\
  \ melee combat. All enemy mechs fight until destroyed.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Red\

  \ unliving</p>\n      <p><strong>Development</strong>: If either team moves all\
  \ surviving mechs into the opposing goal zone, the simulation ends and that team\
  \ wins. If either team defeats every enemy mech, they win by default. If both teams\
  \ end the derby with an equal number of combatants in the opposing goal, the simulation\
  \ resets, allowing all players to return and try again.</p>\n      <p>When the match\
  \ ends, the PCs exit their valkopods and notice a crowd watching a holovid of their\
  \ match. Firefight’s eyes are intent on the screen as she takes notes on a datapad.\
  \ She gets the PCs’ attention as soon as she notices them.</p>\n      <br>\n   \
  \   <h3>GREETINGS HUZKAR! YOU HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY THE NEW VALOR DEFENSE FORCE</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Firefight takes note of players who show enthusiasm and skill during the\
  \ simulated battles. She sees the PCs’ potential and eagerly tries to recruit them.\
  \ If the PCs beat their opponents, she plays to their egos, praising them and saying\
  \ that “New Valor needs your help,” or “all of Daimalko is in danger!” If they lost\
  \ the match, she asks if they’d like another shot at winning, but “for real this\
  \ time.” She answers the PCs’ questions about her organization, explaining that\
  \ they’re a military corps who defend the city of New Valor from colossi attacks.\
  \ They’re based on the distant planet Daimalko (unless the PCs begin this encounter\
  \ on Daimalko, they’ll need to take a shuttle there for further training). If the\
  \ PCs are interested in joining, she sets up an appointment for them at a nearby\
  \ recruiting office where they can fill out formal applications and complete their\
  \ physical assessment.</p>\n      <h3>VALKO DERBY COMPETITIVE PLAY</h3>\n      <p>If\
  \ players are interested in using the Valko Derby rules for PVP matches, replace\
  \ the NPC mechs with even teams of players. If there’s an odd number of players,\
  \ include an NPC to fill the empty slot.</p>\n      <p><strong>Map:</strong> Firefight\
  \ specifically programmed this Valko Derby to reference her love of the sport kaijuball,\
  \ but any map can be holographically recreated for a battle. Throwing in cover and\
  \ level-appropriate hazards or traps isn’t just an option, it’s encouraged!</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Mechs:</strong> The duello class valkos are perfect mechs for\
  \ low-level PCs, but if your players want to customize their own, build mechs appropriate\
  \ to the average level of the PCs using the rules in<em> Tech Revolution</em>. Both\
  \ sides should build their mechs with the same amount of Mech Points in their pool\
  \ and should limit movement to ground based for a fair challenge.</p>\n      <div\
