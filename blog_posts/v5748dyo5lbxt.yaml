  \    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 1, 2011</p> \n    <p>When designing an encounter,\
  \ it's tempting to focus the majority of your attention on the mix of monsters and\
  \ villains. After all, coming up with interesting enemy synergies and evocative\
  \ scenes of terror, threat, and evil-doing go a long way in making encounters both\
  \ memorable and fun. Often neglected, though, is making sure that the setting you\
  \ place these bad guys in offers both threat and opportunity of its own. When designed\
  \ correctly, the terrain of an encounter can provide opportunity and challenges\
  \ that not only compliment the opponents that you select, but can make combat the\
  \ stuff of gaming stories for years to come.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2>First Things\
  \ First</h2> \n    <p>There are two ways to go about terrain selection for your\
  \ encounter. The first is to think about the environment that you want to set your\
  \ encounters, or an entire adventure, within, and filling it with the proper terrain.\
  \ When it comes to dungeon and cavern settings, much of this work is already done\
  \ for you. Take a look at Chapter 13 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>,\
  \ especially pages 410&amp;ndash416, and you'll find a good selection of terrain\
  \ types to stock your dungeon. You'll also want to check out pages 193—194 of the\
  \ <i>Core Rulebook</i> as it has the rules for difficult terrain and obstacles,\
  \ and maybe take a peek at pages 244–245 <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i>\
  \ for some sample hazards to play with.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Picking proper\
  \ terrain is all about creating interesting exceptions, so the first thing you'll\
  \ want to do is make decisions about the baseline terrain for your dungeon. Unless\
  \ your group is full of seasoned Pathfinder veterans, you'll want to set those baselines\
  \ at or near the base assumptions of the Pathfinder rules: Masonry walls, flagstone,\
  \ and wooden doors are a good start. For the most part you, and your players will\
  \ not have to think about these areas of terrain at all. They're the standard dungeon\
  \ dressing everyone is use to. Then you'll want to think about the possible exceptions\
  \ for your dungeon. Are parts of the dungeon in disrepair? Are parts of the dungeon\
  \ in the midst of construction? Does the dungeon serve as an entryway to a subterranean\
  \ cave system? Does it lead to an underground river or water or magma? Once you\
  \ are done imagining your dungeon, and maybe even sketching it on some graph paper,\
  \ you can start to figure out where the exceptions sit, and then start brainstorming\
  \ possibilities that you can't find in the rules... but we will get to that later.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p> Straying deeper into Chapter 13, you can make similar choices\
  \ for large areas of terrain that are not dungeons, but the principles are the same.\
  \ Find your baseline, and then ponder the possibility of interesting and evocative\
  \ exceptions to that baseline. Take some notes, ponder some possibilities, and search\
  \ the rules for similar types of terrain.</p> \n    <p>The other way to go about\
  \ creating interesting environments is to think about the monsters and villains\
  \ you want in your encounter in the adventure, and ask yourself two questions. The\
  \ first question is, what kind of terrain compliments the monsters' or villains'\
  \ tactics? The second question is, what kind of terrain compliments your PCs' abilities?\
  \ Answering the second question can be a little tricky, especially if your end result\
  \ is being designed for a nonspecific group of PCs (say you're writing an adventure\
  \ for a convention or Pathfinder Society open call, or you're already thinking about\
  \ next year's RPG Superstar). More often than not, you'll want to try to fill your\
  \ encounters with terrain that does both simultaneously. This creates better-balanced\
  \ encounters that don't favor one side or the other overly much, which not only\
  \ tend to create more exciting encounters, but can also bypass the need to adjust\
  \ the CR of your encounters because terrain favors one side more than the other.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p> Whenever possible, it's best to use a mixture of these two\
  \ approaches. Treat each one as lenses toward your ultimate goal—to create a fun\
  \ game experience in a world that seem rich, vibrant, and full of possibilities\
  \ and potential dangers for the PCs to explore.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2>Designing\
  \ New Terrain</h2> \n    <p>Whenever you get the itch to create a new piece of terrain,\
  \ you should shoot toward making your terrain challenging to interact with but not\
  \ overly frustrating. In general, you will want one of two speeds for your new terrain.\
  \ The first speed is terrain that has automatic effects when a creature spends an\
  \ action to interact with it, but the effect is always constant. Unlocked doors,\
  \ stairs, and small passageways all fall under this category. They talk directly\
  \ to the action economy of the game. Someone must spend an action or slightly modify\
  \ her normal actions in order to use them (think squeezing, opening doors, or basic\
  \ difficult terrain). This type of terrain is easy to use, quick to remember, but\
  \ it lacks variability. Some of the most exciting terrain features effects that\
  \ do not guarantee success, or, better yet, feature varying degrees of success.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p>Enter the second speed of terrain, where actions are often\
  \ required, but the effect is variable. Usually such variability is tied to the\
  \ uses of a skill. For most terrain you will want to pick a basic skill that can\
  \ be used untrained and that makes sense for the terrain type. Acrobatics, Climb,\
  \ Escape Artist, Fly, Survival, Swim, and even raw Strength checks are some obvious\
  \ examples, with Acrobatics already doing a lot of the heavy lifting with the terrain\
  \ found in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> (see hewn stone floors, rubble, and slippery\
  \ floors). But don't be afraid to mix it up a little with other skills, even those\
  \ that can't be used untrained (Disable Device, Ride, and even Stealth are some\
  \ personal favorites). Creating such terrain is just another way where PCs (or monsters)\
  \ with high skill bonuses have an opportunity to shine, but at a cost. Failure is\
  \ a possibility.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>When creating new terrain, it is not\
  \ only important to make sure that they work within the normal rules of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG but that they are also the right fit for the PC and creature mix you are designing\
  \ encounters and adventure for. Designing a fight on a frozen lake may seem like\
  \ fun, but the last thing you want to do is slow down the encounter to a crawl with\
  \ every creature being forced to make an Acrobatics check in order to accomplish\
  \ any kind of movement whatsoever. Consider creating relatively safe areas (maybe\
  \ areas covered with snow or rough ice that grants more traction), giving clumsy\
  \ creatures slightly suboptimal movement choices, while allowing agile creatures\
  \ to gamble for success, or even the possibility of greater effect. With those sheets\
  \ of ice, consider giving them the possibility of bonuses when higher Acrobatics\
  \ checks are rolled.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2>Can We Get Some Examples?</h2> \n\
  \    <p> With some of terrain philosophy out of the way, start fooling around with\
  \ creating your own terrain. Tune in next Tuesday for some new pre-made terrain\
  \ objects to spice up your game. Next week we will be focusing on some terrain primarily\
  \ designed to limit or focus movement and action types, and the week after we will\
  \ unleash some crazy terrain options that grant new action options, such as movement\
  \ and even some terrain that grants creatures special attacks.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n\
