  \   <blockquote> \n    <h1><br> Pathfinder RPG Open Call for Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\"> Thursday, October 15, 2009</p> \n\
  \    <p>Hello and welcome to another installment of the Pathfinder Society scenario\
  \ open call using the new Pathfinder RPG rules! Most months we'll open one of our\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenarios to you, the general public, to search for new authors\
  \ and new ideas for use in Paizo's worldwide organized play campaign. We're looking\
  \ for authors who have a clear and concise writing style, who have solid and creative\
  \ ideas for adventures, and who are capable in every way of following instructions\
  \ and meeting deadlines. And while we're seeking new authors through this process,\
  \ we certainly encourage previously published authors to participate as well.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Speaking of new authors, special congratulations go to paizo.com messageboard\
  \ regular Yoda8MyHead, who was selected as the author for the previous open call.\
  \ His scenario, #43: <i>The Pallid Plague</i>, will come out this February. Be sure\
  \ to pop into the Pathfinder Society messageboards and congratulate Yoda on this\
  \ assignment!</p> \n    <p>As always, keep the following guidelines in mind when\
  \ submitting:</p> \n    <p>1. Don't break our world. If you submit something that\
  \ breaks part of our world, it'll be auto-rejected. The scenarios are 4-hour adventures—\
  epic story arcs, world-shattering events, wars, mass famine, etc. don't have a place\
  \ in them.</p> \n    <p>2. Understand Pathfinder Society Organized Play before you\
  \ submit. Specifically, understand that the Pathfinder Society is an organization\
  \ of vagabond scholars, thrill-seeking treasure hunters, and extreme explorers.\
  \ They are not necessarily the \"good guys,\" they don't get \"hired\" for their\
  \ adventures, and they're not generally looking to make the world a better place.\
  \ Submitting generic 3.5 \"save the day\" adventure ideas will decrease your chances\
  \ of getting to write one. There are plenty of resources out there to give you a\
  \ feel for the Society: the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy84k4\"\
  >Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7zkr\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #1</a>, and the <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a> all have information on the Pathfinder\
  \ Society.</p> \n    <p>3. Read one or two scenarios before submitting (particularly\
  \ 29 through 32).</p> \n    <p>4. Pathfinder Society Scenarios must be no more offensive\
  \ than PG-13. Scenarios are played in public at public settings and children will\
  \ be playing them. Submissions that include violence toward children will be auto-rejected.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>5. This is not a contest. This is more like an interview for a job—you're\
  \ showing me your best idea and I'm deciding if the combination of your idea and\
  \ writing skill equals you being selected as our next scenario author. We need authors—\
  not winners. And I really want to stress the <i>author</i> part of that. Only send\
  \ me your best work that is reflective of your writing style. I can teach someone\
  \ the rules system—I can't teach someone to write.</p> \n    <p>6. I don't have\
  \ time to return every submission with feedback. Feel free to post your rejected\
  \ proposals to the Pathfinder Society messageboards for peer review. For those of\
  \ you not submitting, please give feedback to those who do and are rejected.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>7. Lastly, I posted some general feedback on recent submissions <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/scenarioSubmissionTalk/scenarioSubmissionAdvice\"\
  >here</a>. Please read that thread before submitting.</p> \n    <p>Rules for submitting\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenario outlines are as follows:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>1. Based on the guidelines for the current round, write a 750-word outline\
  \ that includes the following:</p>\n     <blockquote> \n      <p>a. A title (if\
  \ necessary, some times they are already titled)<br> b. A brief introduction that\
  \ acts as a prologue for the scenario<br> c. A brief summary of how the PCs proceed\
  \ through each encounter<br> d. A brief summary of each encounter—minimum six encounters\
  \ with one encounter detailed as optional<br> e. A brief conclusion—what happens\
  \ if the PCs fail or succeed</p>\n     </blockquote>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>2.\
  \ By the due date, email your outline to josh@paizo.com with the subject line <b>SCENARIO\
  \ NAME_SCENARIO#_ YOURLASTNAME</b>. Your summary must be in a MS Word document,\
  \ or a Plain Text or Rich Text Format file—these are files ending in <b>.doc</b>,\
  \ <b>.txt</b>, or <b>.rtf</b>. Your file must be titled SCENARIO NAME_SCENARIO#_LAST\
  \ NAME, i.e., PerilsofthePiratePact_17_Dayon.</p> \n     <p>3. Include your full\
  \ legal name, email address, physical mailing address, and a contact phone number\
  \ at the top of your submission—this text does <i>not</i> count toward your word\
  \ count. </p> \n     <p>4. Please allow 72 hours for a response before resending\
  \ your submission. </p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The current open call is for\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenario 45—one of the March 2010 releases. The full schedule\
  \ for this submission period is as follows:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>10/15/09—\
  Open call begins</li> \n     <li>10/30/09—Submissions due by 11:59 P.M. Pacific\
  \ Time</li> \n     <li>11/9/09 through 11/13/09—Submissions review completed—selections\
  \ and rejections notified</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p><b>Guidelines</b></p> \n    <p>**<b>SPOILER\
  \ ALERT: Do not read the guidelines below if you wish to avoid spoilers for upcoming\
  \ scenarios.</b>**</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 45</b></p> \n   \
  \ <p>Title: none; up to the author<br> Setting: Absalom<br> Story: The Minotaur\
  \ Prince of Absalom has been kidnapped (see pages 35–36, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/35E/v5748btpy86j8\"\
  ><i>Guide to Absalom</i></a> ). Why has he been kidnapped? Who did it? Why does\
  \ the Pathfinder Society care? Your submission must include Grandmaster Torch (see\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenarios #1 and #14) in one form or another—it's up to you\
  \ how much of a roll he plays.<br> Level Range: Tier 1–5; Tiers 1–2 and 4–5</p>\
