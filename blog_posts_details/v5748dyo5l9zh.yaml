  artist: "Gary Gygax, The Anubis Murders, The Samarkand Solution, and Death in Delhi.\
    \ Publisher Erik Mona had always enjoyed Gygax's Gord the Rogue stories (one of\
    \ which we've now republished in Worlds of Their Own), and we felt that it was\
    \ important to kick things off with Gygax, considering that, after Tolkien, he's\
    \ probably had the most pervasive effect on modern fantasy of any author. If you\
    \ stop to think about it, that's an enormous claim, but it's trueâ€”how many books\
    \ in the fantasy section of your bookstore (or on your shelf at home) have their\
    \ roots in Dungeons & Dragons? Certainly it was Gygax's work that had the biggest\
    \ influence on all of us, and that put us in a position to one day start a fiction\
    \ line of our own. And as Gary's health declined and interests had of late turned\
    \ away"
