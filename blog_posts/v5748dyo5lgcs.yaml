  \  <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game: Advanced Class Guide</i></a> is only a few weeks from release,\
  \ and we're all getting excited about what the book has to offer. Over the last\
  \ several weeks, we've revealed a ton of details about the 10 classes in the book,\
  \ from hints at their game details to a look at the backgrounds of the iconic characters\
  \ that represent them in the book's art. Looking over the final hardcover here on\
  \ my desk, I'm enormously proud of the work our team has put into it, and I'm grateful\
  \ for the tireless efforts of our playtesters, who made the <i>Advanced Class Guide</i>\
  \ shine with their diligent testing and commentary. We could not have done this\
  \ book without you, and we're all really pleased with how it came together.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>With one major exception.</p> \n    <p>The cover of the <i>Advanced Class\
  \ Guide</i> contains a huge error of the most embarrassing kind imaginableâ€”we printed\
  \ the book with the wrong logo.</p> \n    <p>That's right, the <i>Advanced Class\
  \ Guide</i>, in many ways the most important release of the year, features the wrong\
  \ logo. Instead of the \"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\" logo, the hardcover's front\
  \ cover features the \"Pathfinder Adventure Path\" logo. </p> \n    <p>The story\
  \ of how something like this slipped through our assiduous quality controls turns\
  \ out to be pretty boring. On the third round of back-and-forth changes after the\
  \ book was sent to the printer, an image link somehow got changed, switching the\
  \ logo to the wrong one at the absolute last minute. After the last minute, in fact.\
  \ We have sign-off approval sheets for every stage of editing. Multiple employees\
  \ sign off on the correct logos, on the trademark circle, on the \"printed in country,\"\
  \ basically on every single element of a book. But this error was introduced <i>after</i>\
  \ all of those safeguards had been correctly adhered to, and the first time we noticed\
  \ the mistake was when the first copies arrived from the printer.</p> \n    <p>Naturally,\
  \ we were mortified and checked with our printer about turning around a ship with\
  \ tens of thousands of copies of our book, destroying them, and reprinting from\
  \ scratch. That effort would have cost more than $100,000, and resulted in literally\
  \ tons of 99.9999% correct books going into a landfill. We've had considerable success\
  \ over the last few years, but honestly there's a lot more that we can do with $100,000\
  \ to benefit the game above and beyond wiping some egg from our faces. Ultimately,\
  \ after lots of consideration, we decided that it wasn't worth the expense to fix\
  \ the logo.</p> \n    <p>And to be clear, the misprint concerns about three square\
  \ inches on the front cover. The logo on the spine is correct. The logo on the cover\
  \ page is correct. The logo on the back is correct. The logo on every spread in\
  \ the book is correct. One image link broke, to one logo. Yes, it's the most important\
  \ one, and yes, that's very embarrassing, but ultimately it makes no difference\
  \ to the book's content. Many folks I've shown the book to did not even notice the\
  \ difference, as the logos are very similar.</p> \n    <p>We've already shipped\
  \ the book to a few distributors. Subscribers could start receiving them as early\
  \ as next week. Many of you will notice the different logo, and will naturally have\
  \ questions. I wanted to get out in front of that and explain what went wrong, and\
  \ why we decided not to fix it.</p> \n    <p>It's a bummer. It's something we'll\
  \ fix on subsequent printings, assuming that we do them. We considered making a\
  \ sticker, or a paper wrap-around cover, or just about anything, but ultimately\
  \ decided that it wouldn't make much of a difference. The covers are screwed up.\
  \ Putting a little sticker over the mistake wouldn't fix the mistake, it'd just\
  \ make the book look even more messed up.</p> \n    <p>So, yeah. Lame. The <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy978v\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a> has the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path logo on it. We apologize for the inconvenience this will cause to bibliophiles\
  \ everywhere. Know that we feel your pain.</p> \n    <p>The book remains incredible,\
  \ despite the cosmetic error. We're sure you'll really like it, and we've taken\
  \ what steps we can to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Thanks for your understanding.</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
