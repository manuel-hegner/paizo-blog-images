  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The first project I ever did for Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play as a volunteer—really the start of my career—was creating\
  \ boons, and by the time Paizo hired me, I had written about 100 boons for the campaign.\
  \ Booncraft lost little of its magic when I took on the role of developer, and I\
  \ continue to use boon-writing as a way of enabling volunteers to contribute to\
  \ the campaign and, perhaps as importantly, as a means of testing out new and aspiring\
  \ authors. I've had numerous folks ask me what goes into writing a boon, what makes\
  \ a good boon, and how one goes about getting me to publish a boon. Let me start\
  \ with good qualities.</span></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Balance</b>: A\
  \ boon must be mechanically balanced. This includes it being balanced on its own,\
  \ balanced in terms of the campaign, and balanced with regard to other boon options\
  \ on a Chronicle sheet. If a Chronicle sheet has two boon options that a player\
  \ can choose from, and one is far superior to the other, something's not quite right.\
  \ A boon could also be great for a home game but have troubling consequences for\
  \ Pathfinder Society. Finally, a boon might just not be balanced in terms of the\
  \ game's mechanics. Most boons end up being about as potent as a trait; some might\
  \ have a one-time use or have a niche application, but there's at least a rough\
  \ metric for what is appropriate. It's reasonable for a boon's power to be greater\
  \ if it's awarded at a higher level, particularly at 12th level and beyond.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Flavor</b>: A good boon typically has some flavor text describing\
  \ <i>why</i> it grants the bonus that it does. This not only explains the intention\
  \ of the boon, but it helps to chronicle what the character accomplished to earn\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p><b>Integration</b> (modules and Adventure Paths): When developing\
  \ a boon for a sanctioned adventure such as a module, it's important that the boon\
  \ actually tie into the core product. I would be quite confused if I acquired a\
  \ pirate ship during Reign of Winter, and I would scratch my head at learning special\
  \ ice magic during Skull &amp; Shackles. Reverse them, though, and things make a\
  \ lot of sense.</p> \n     <p><b>Innovation</b>: Boons—particularly convention boons—\
  present a special opportunity because they are not print products and often have\
  \ a limited time in which they're available. That means it's possible to experiment\
  \ with new mechanics in ways that might not be appropriate for a new hardcover book.\
  \ If the boon ends up being too potent or a poor fit for any other reason, the limited\
  \ number of those boons will gradually disappear as those characters gain levels\
  \ and become Seekers. If the mechanic is particularly interesting, word gets around,\
  \ and other developers begin saying, \"Hey, that's pretty cool!\" It's only a matter\
  \ of time before we might see it in a book or returning to a convention near you.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Wow Factor</b>: I love boons that make players' eyes go wide with\
  \ excitement, even when the mechanical bonus might not be very potent. It's usually\
  \ obvious whether or not a boon has wow factor within a minute of handing out Chronicle\
  \ sheets.</p> \n     <p><b>Narrative Potential</b> (optional): Boons can provide\
  \ a fun story-telling hook. This is the case for Missing Mentor, which sends the\
  \ PC looking for a lost teacher over the course of five scenarios. The boon may\
  \ only take 30 seconds to use each scenario for a fairly minor bonus, but the flavor\
  \ of the boon makes the player think, \"huh, who <i>did</i> teach my character how\
  \ to be so awesome?\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>A few of my most active boon-crafting\
  \ volunteers have given me permission to share an earlier draft or two of their\
  \ work to illustrate how a boon evolves from idea to draft to development to distribution.\
  \ Keep an eye out for these in the coming weeks as well as a few sanctioning projects\
  \ that are coming down the pipeline. In the meantime, what qualities in a boon make\
  \ you excited? Using spoilers (at least for boons found in scenarios), are there\
  \ any boons that really exemplify what a boon should do?</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br>\
