  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The galaxy of the Starfinder\
  \ RPG expands with this month’s release of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Near Space</i></a>, which details dozens of planets and civilizations\
  \ in this region of the galaxy and includes new starships and a wide selection of\
  \ character option as well.</p> \n     <p>Among the many worlds located within Near\
  \ Space are not only the allied planets of the Pact Worlds, but also the core worlds\
  \ of the Veskarium, the interplanetary empire of the warlike vesk. While vesk are\
  \ a relatively common sight in the Pact Worlds and throughout the galaxy, their\
  \ home system has remained something of a mystery. But no longer! Starfinder Near\
  \ Space takes us into the Veskarium for the first time, so let’s take a brief look\
  \ at the vesk empire and its diverse worlds.</p> \n     <h2>The Veskarium</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Centered around a blue sun called Ghavaniska, the Veskarium is an autocratic\
  \ empire and military dictatorship with one overarching goal: conquest. Long before\
  \ the onset of the Gap, the vesk conquered all of the planets of their home system,\
  \ renaming these worlds after themselves and numbering them in order of their distance\
  \ from the sun. When the Gap ended, the vesk turned to their well-organized pre-Gap\
  \ military archives and set about relearning the boundaries of their ancient empire\
  \ and re-establishing the Veskarium’s dominion over their subject worlds in less\
  \ than a decade. Vesk dominate the empire and make up the majority of its inhabitants,\
  \ but the Veskarium encompasses dozens of planets, and their native inhabitants\
  \ enjoy full citizenship in the empire. Vesk believe they have an obligation to\
  \ care for their conquered vassals, and while the Veskarium’s laws are strict and\
  \ draconian, standards of living are high, and most residents of the empire, vesk\
  \ or not, are content with their lives and support—or at least tolerate—their government.</p>\

  100%\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <h3>Vesk\
  \ Prime</h3> \n     <p>The closest planet to the sun, Vesk Prime is the vesk home\
  \ world and the imperial capital of the Veskarium. It is the most densely populated\
  \ world in the empire, with large, modern cities—like the sprawling metropolis and\
  \ vast military installation Command Prime—surrounded by huge tracts of cultivated\
  \ lands and wilderness reserves. Under the leadership of High Despot Vindaskayo\
  \ Swarmripper, Vesk Prime remains the center of the empire, both politically and\
  \ culturally. The Veskarium originated here in ages past, when the vesk defeated\
  \ the other native sapient species of their home world, the caiagaras and the skeraskens,\
  \ and first proclaimed their empire before expanding to the other worlds of the\
  \ Ghavaniska system.</p> \n     <h3>Vesk-2</h3> \n     <p>Ghavaniska’s second planet,\
  \ a calm, watery world with a shallow, salty ocean covering much of its surface,\
  \ was the Veskarium’s first extraplanetary conquest. The squid-like ijtikris are\
  \ native to Vesk-2, and after centuries of vesk rule, they are highly integrated\
  \ into Veskarium society. Strange, ancient ruins that predate ijtikri culture dot\
  \ the scattered islands of Vesk-2 and are an enduring mystery on the planet, hinting\
  \ at the possibility of another sapient species that inhabited the world in the\
  \ distant past. Ijtikris have an instinctive aversion to these sites, but vesk have\
  \ no such compunctions and have explored many of them. The flooded swamp-forests\
  \ of Vesk-2 are also a center of domesticated defrex ranching in the Veskarium.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Vesk-3</h3> \n     <p>A garden world with expansive forests, abundant\
  \ nutrients from constant volcanic activity, and warm, shallow oceans, Vesk-3 is\
  \ saturated in a constant, rainy spring. Ostensibly a paradise, Vesk-3 remains one\
  \ of the Veskarium’s most difficult planets to rule, thanks to its indigenous population\
  \ of ever-helpful skittermanders. Although they far outnumber their vesk overlords,\
  \ skittermanders generally don’t seem to understand the significance of their conquest.\
  \ Their obsequious nature grates on the practical-minded vesk, who commonly joke\
  \ that skittermanders will eagerly “help” tear down your engine unless you eat them,\
  \ and even then they’ll stick around and help chew your food. As a result, vesk\
  \ presence on the planet is mostly confined to one of the planet’s two primary continents,\
  \ leaving skittermanders largely autonomous in their native lands.</p> \n     <h3>Vesk-4</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Nicknamed “the Glutton” by early vesk conquerors for its tendency to\
  \ pull celestial bodies—such as its own moons—into its powerful gravitational field,\
  \ Vesk-4 is a dense planet with a single landmass teeming with lush jungles, sodden\
  \ swamplands, and volcanic mountain ranges. Home to an indigenous species of sapient\
  \ mole‑like creatures called talphi, Vesk-4 is an important hub for mining useful\
  \ minerals, left behind by millennia of meteorites crashing into the planet. Recently,\
  \ however, the Veskarium has begun harvesting crystals that can be refined to power\
  \ solarian weapons, and Vesk-4 now supports an academy specializing in training\
  \ solarians. Life on Vesk‑4 is generally difficult. Citizens lead austere, regimented\
  \ lives focused on labor and service, and seismic activity, radiation, and frequent\
  \ meteorite collisions constantly threaten settlements.</p> \n     <h3>Vesk-5</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Encircled by bands of red and purple gases, Vesk-5 is the largest planet\
  \ and the only gas giant in the Ghavaniska system. The planet’s atmosphere surges\
  \ with powerful lightning storms and pounding hydrogen rain, and its dense, unstable\
  \ core constantly ejects valuable ore that the Veskarium monopolizes. Nevertheless,\
  \ daring adventurers called stormrunners dodge military patrol craft and brave Vesk-5’\
  s dangerous atmosphere to “mine” these profitable minerals using gigantic energy\
  \ nets deployed from their ships, causing the Veskarium to brand them outlaws—a\
  \ label that many stormrunners adopt as a badge of honor. Vesk-5’s only native sapient\
  \ species, formians, reside in orbiting hives in the planet’s small, rocky ring\
  \ system, and most other inhabitants live on the gas giant’s largest moons.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Vesk-6</h3> \n     <p>Though distant from the sun, Vesk-6 is an inexplicably\
  \ warm jungle world with relatively low gravity, towering trees, gigantic insects,\
  \ and other titanic flora and fauna that struggle ruthlessly with one another to\
  \ survive. A powerful magnetosphere helps the planet retain its atmosphere, but\
  \ the magnetic winds it generates devastate many forms of technology, with the result\
  \ that Vesk-6’s surface remains mostly untamed. The planet’s dominant sapient species,\
  \ the catlike pahtras, initially resisted the vesk invasion, but they were eventually\
  \ conquered and incorporated into the Veskarium. Most pahtra nation-states signed\
  \ treaties with the Veskarium that grant them an unusual amount of autonomy, but\
  \ some groups of pahtra guerillas continue to battle vesk peacekeepers for the liberation\
  \ of their home world.</p> \n     <h3>Vesk-7 and Vesk-8</h3> \n     <p>The distant,\
  \ icy worlds of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 are the outermost planets of the Ghavaniska system,\
  \ and a posting to either of them is usually a punishment for dishonored vesk or\
  \ those exiled for controversial or troublesome political views. The two worlds\
  \ share virtually the same orbit, though Vesk-7’s orbit is retrograde, and twice\
  \ each planetary year, the planets’ shared moon, Traverse, transfers its orbit from\
  \ one world to the other. Magical gates linking the planets and their moon activate\
  \ at these times, allowing the native kothamas of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 to travel between\
  \ them. Vesk-7 hosts a small, nominally independent city of people who want to leave\
  \ their pasts behind them, while Vesk-8 holds a penal colony established to mine\
  \ the planet’s valuable shimmerstone deposits.</p> \n     <h3>Conqueror’s Forge</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Initially constructed to address a perceived technological gap between\
  \ the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds, this massive space platform and shipyard—with\
  \ a distinctive silhouette reminiscent of a doshko—has the full status of one of\
  \ the Veskarium’s core worlds, with its own high despot in command. Equipped with\
  \ banks of mighty thrusters (and even a powerful Drift engine, if rumors are to\
  \ be believed), Conqueror’s Forge travels throughout Veskarium space, collecting\
  \ resources for research and production, manufacturing weapons and starships for\
  \ the Veskarium’s military, and selling its technological developments to other\
  \ species to fund additional research. One section of the station, officially denied\
  \ by the Veskarium government and known only by the codename Vesk-9, is devoted\
  \ to confidential research, advanced experimentation, and other secret projects\
  \ that remain classified to all but those with the highest security clearances.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this glimpse of the worlds and peoples of the\
  \ Veskarium. If you’d like to learn more about the Veskarium (or other Near Space\
  \ cultures), pick up a copy of Starfinder Near Space and keep your sensors locked\
