  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by James L. Sutter</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Catch the\
  \ Wind</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Two men knelt at the foot of the dais. One wore thick-plated lamellar armor, the\
  \ other snug gray wrappings that hid all but his eyes. Similarly dressed pairs made\
  \ a half-circle around the kneelers, each individual set connected by a short iron\
  \ chain.</span></p> \n    <p>On the dais, two more men stepped forward. Though they\
  \ were dressed no differently from anyone else in the great cathedral, no one could\
  \ have mistaken them for the others. They stepped forward in perfect unison, as\
  \ though each were a mismatched reflection of the other, stretched and warped by\
  \ a carnival mirror. Between them, they carried a chain like the others, holding\
  \ it reverently in all four hands.</p> \n    <p>\"This chain does not bind.\" The\
  \ leaders' voice—for there was only one voice, spoken with two mouths—was smooth\
  \ and reverent, rising up to ring off the cathedral's high dome. \"Today, you cease\
  \ to be two men, and instead become <i>szerik</i>—shared mind, shared heart. This\
  \ chain will be your symbol, announcing your bond to the world. Yet the Iridian\
  \ Fold is not a guild, with a chain of office. It is no religion, with a chain for\
  \ a holy symbol. It is greater than these. For with love, with discipline, the lines\
  \ between you will blur and fade. You will be as one soul in two bodies. This is\
  \ the great mystery of the Iridian Fold: to let the bond between you grow until\
  \ the union eclipses the self. And in that moment, you will no longer need the reminder\
  \ of the chain.\" Two sets of eyes crinkled into a smile. \"You will be the chain.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"<i>Be the chain!</i>\" the congregation chorused.</p> \n    <p>Fifty\
  \ feet above, Roshad glanced over at Bors and squeezed his hand. The pair crouched\
  \ on the narrow gallery running the circumference of the cathedral's dome, Bors's\
  \ bulky lamellar forcing him to contort himself like a dying insect in order to\
  \ stay hidden behind the low balustrade. Despite the obvious discomfort, the bigger\
  \ man's stone-slab face broke into a smile as he met Roshad's eyes, and he tugged\
  \ lightly on the stolen chain running from his chest to the collar around Roshad's\
  \ neck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_BoarAndRabbit-Roshad.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_BoarAndRabbit-Roshad_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Roshad prefers the direct approach.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Roshad smiled back, knowing that no veil could hide the expression from\
  \ his partner. His <i>szerik</i>.</p> \n    <p>My Boar, Roshad thought, and the\
  \ words came bittersweet. This is no place for him, lurking in the darkness like\
  \ a beggar. If only we could be down there with the others. We—</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ cathedral's doors banged open, replacing the soft glow of stained glass with the\
  \ flare of noonday sun. As quickly as it appeared, the light was blocked by half\
  \ a dozen figures, men and women in the furs and leathers of the horse tribes. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Where are they?\" </p> \n    <p>The leader of the troop, a bull-faced\
  \ man with a long horsehair plume atop his conical helmet, shoved his way through\
  \ the assembly until he stood at the foot of the dais, looking up at the congregation's\
  \ leader. Around him, the gathered men of the Iridian Fold hissed at the affront,\
  \ hands going to blades. The other invaders looked less comfortable, yet dutifully\
  \ spread out behind their captain.</p> \n    <p>The men on the dais raised their\
  \ hands in a calming gesture. \"You do us a disservice, stranger.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ captain snorted. \"I figure you get serviced plenty.\" Behind him, several of\
  \ his own people frowned. \"But what you Iridian Fold do is no business of mine.\
  \ Now where are they?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Where are who?\" the Iridian Fold men asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I don't have time for games, holy man. One of the street kids saw them\
  \ slip in here not half an hour ago.\" He looked back at one of his warriors. \"\
  Dosk?\"</p> \n    <p>\"They're not in the group, Captain. Unless they're disguised.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The captain grimaced, then looked around at the cathedral's many shadowed\
  \ corners. \"Fine. Aizha, light this place up.\"</p> \n    <p>A woman in a thick-furred\
  \ hat stepped forward and raised her hands, grasping the air as if kneading dough.\
  \ Four globes of golden light blazed into existence around them, each the size of\
  \ a juggling ball. She gestured, and they shot outward, making a circuit of the\
  \ vast chamber at head height, then rose higher to light the gallery.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Roshad searched frantically for somewhere else to hide as the globes floated\
  \ closer, but without the shadows, the posts of the stone balustrade did little\
  \ to obscure the two men. He met Bors's eyes.</p> \n    <p>\"There!\" Down below,\
  \ one of the horse warriors pointed. The captain gave a command, and the company\
  \ ran for the narrow spiral staircase leading up to Bors and Roshad's perch.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They were trapped. The stairway was the only way down to the cathedral\
  \ floor—as usual, Roshad and Bors had crept up it shortly before the Iridian Fold\
  \ men arrived for their ceremony. </p> \n    <p>A narrow ladder on the opposite\
  \ side of the cathedral's dome caught his eye, its rungs disappearing up into the\
  \ shaft of the cathedral's windcatcher.</p> \n    <p>Well, if they couldn't go down...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Roshad yanked Bors to his feet and jerked his chin toward the ladder.\
  \ Bors nodded once and ran, his armored bulk threatening to overflow the narrow\
  \ catwalk. If he tripped, the thigh-high balustrade would do little to save him,\
  \ but the man moved with the grace of a desert wolf. Roshad's heart swelled as he\
  \ followed, the chain swinging lightly between them. Below, the whole congregation\
  \ now pointed and shouted, shocked to see two men dressed as their own racing around\
  \ the inside of the dome.</p> \n    <p>They reached the ladder and began to climb.\
  \ The shaft was blessedly wide, and broken at intervals by smaller horizontal tubes\
  \ that led back to the dome, the better to let the rising hot air escape and draw\
  \ up cooler air from the cathedral's catacombs. Roshad could feel the breeze as\
  \ he hauled himself quickly upward.</p> \n    <p>The shaft ended abruptly in a covered\
  \ ledge, barely wide enough for Roshad and Bors to stand together. Beyond a row\
  \ of narrow pillars, the grand city of Ular Kel spread out before them, beckoning\
  \ with a thousand places to hide, to lose themselves in the market crowds like loose\
  \ stones on the steppes.</p> \n    <p>If only they could reach it. Roshad stuck\
  \ his head out past the pillars and looked down. The drop was at least eighty feet,\
  \ and the outer face of the windcatcher tower had no access ladder. Nothing but\
  \ smooth stone until it met the blue-tiled plaza below. He grimaced and pulled back\
  \ inside.</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing?\" Bors rumbled.</p> \n    <p>\"Not that way.\"\
  \ Roshad clasped Bors's armored forearm. \"Hold tight.\"</p> \n    <p>\"When haven't\
  \ I?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yeah, well...\" Taking a deep breath, Roshad planted one foot\
  \ firmly on the edge of the ledge, then swung out into space. He let the momentum\
  \ pivot him around, doing his best to ignore the dizzying expanse of air below him\
  \ as he reached out and caught the outer edge of the tower's wall. He hugged the\
  \ corner as if it were Bors himself, pressing into it, and looked around.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Damn</i>. He'd hoped for some sort of access ledge on this side, but\
  \ instead the tower was one long fin of stone extending back to the dome's apex.\
  \ Even if they could get on top of it, there'd still be no good way down.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Rabbit.\" Bors's voice was calm but urgent. \"Time to go.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Roshad swung back onto the safety of the ledge. Below them, the horse warriors\
  \ were in the shaft now, their curses rising up ahead of them. \"Just had to check.\"\
  \ He let go of Bors's arm and unclipped the chain from his collar, then stepped\
  \ close to the larger man, his back against Bors's armored chest. He quickly looped\
  \ the chain around both of them, under their arms, then handed the loose end to\
  \ Bors. \"Ready?\"</p> \n    <p>Bors wrapped huge arms tight around Roshad's shoulders.\
  \ \"Always.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad kissed the man's bracered wrist, then fixed the\
  \ image of a small brown house spider in his mind, his hands twisting in the motions\
  \ that had come to feel so natural. He knelt, Bors wrapped around him like a shell,\
  \ and whispered the words.</p> \n    <p>Then he rolled off the ledge.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>There was a moment of disorientation, his stomach rebelling at the shifting\
  \ horizon. Then his hands found the sheer stone of the tower wall, and suddenly\
  \ it was as if the world had turned ninety degrees, and he was crawling along a\
  \ flat plane leading to the vertical blue wall of the plaza. His hands and feet\
  \ moved effortlessly, sticking and releasing at will as he crawled, hindered only\
  \ by Bors, who did his best to lock his legs around Roshad's middle. The warrior's\
  \ weight on Roshad's back pulled steadily forward, urging them on. </p> \n    <p>And\
  \ then they were down. The world twisted again as the two men untangled themselves\
  \ and stood. Bors's expression was as stoic as any war mask, but his breathing was\
  \ quick and his tan skin paler than normal. Roshad smiled up at him and refastened\
  \ his chain.</p> \n    <p>A shout from the tower drew their attention. High above,\
  \ the soldiers were peering down at them from between the pillars.</p> \n    <p>Bors\
  \ tugged at Roshad's arm, leading him away across the plaza, but Roshad couldn't\
  \ resist shooting their pursuers a rude gesture. \"Better luck next time, geldings!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Except that there wouldn't <i>be</i> a next time. At long last, he\
  \ and Bors were finally leaving the city, heading out to—</p> \n    <p>The woman\
  \ in the furry hat appeared between the pillars. She shouted something, then began\
  \ shoving warriors off the ledge. One by one, they fell, unable to keep from pinwheeling\
  \ their arms, faces contorted with fear—and yet moving nowhere near as quickly as\
  \ they should have. In a heartbeat, the first had touched down, as lightly as a\
  \ falling leaf. He smiled at and drew his sword.</p> \n    <p>\"Right. Wizard.\"\
  \ Roshad turned back to Bors. \"Okay, <i>now</i> we go.\"</p> \n    <p>They ran,\
  \ cutting across the plaza and through the crowd of onlookers that had gathered.\
  \ Beyond it, the street was packed with merchants, travelers, and locals out for\
  \ a walk in the city's picturesque temple district. Barrow runners pushed their\
  \ one-wheeled carts to and fro, working on commission to spread caravan goods from\
  \ the city's central market out to the rest of the populace.</p> \n    <p>Roshad\
  \ grabbed the edge of one such barrow and pulled, dumping a load of ornamented baskets\
  \ into the street. The runner screeched in protest and dove to recover her goods\
  \ before they got trampled or stolen by the swarming street kids who knew an opportunity\
  \ when they saw one. The pursuing horse warriors cursed, bogged down in the morass,\
  \ and Bors and Roshad turned a corner and kept running, staying close together to\
  \ keep their chain from clotheslining bystanders.</p> \n    <p>Someone shouted,\
  \ and Roshad looked back to see that several horse warriors had broken through and\
  \ were still on their trail. This part of the street was less densely packed, and\
  \ the pursuers were gaining.</p> \n    <p>\"The hell with this!\" Roshad careened\
  \ around the edge of a coffeehouse and ducked into an alley, pulling Bors along\
  \ with him. He pressed the big man back into the shadows against the wall, then\
  \ held his hands out toward the alley's mouth, fingers spread.</p> \n    <p>A gauntleted\
  \ hand grabbed his shoulder. \"Rabbit, no!\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad grimaced and shot\
  \ Bors a look. \"They're not going to stop, Bors.\"</p> \n    <p>Bors simply stared\
  \ at him, mouth set in a disapproving line. </p> \n    <p>\"Piss and hell!\" Roshad\
  \ grabbed Bors's shoulder and shoved him back into a run. \"If they catch us, it's\
  \ your fault!\"</p> \n    <p>They sprinted through a maze of alleys and access ways,\
  \ past middens and watering troughs, their footfalls echoing off the mud-brick walls.\
  \ Their pursuers weren't even bothering to yell anymore, just focusing all their\
  \ efforts on closing the gap between them and their quarry. Roshad yanked Bors around\
  \ another corner—</p> \n    <p>And stopped. The alley dead-ended in a small courtyard,\
  \ kept shaded and cool by the many-storied buildings on three sides. Every door\
  \ was shut tight. </p> \n    <p>Roshad grabbed the latch on the nearest door, but\
  \ to no avail. Bors gave it a tentative slam with his shoulder, but the ironbound\
  \ wood didn't even groan. They spun around just in time to see the first of the\
  \ horse warriors appear.</p> \n    <p>\"Now?\" Roshad asked Bors, raising a hand.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Bors only shook his head. His fingers were tight on the hilt of the huge\
  \ sword slung across his back, but Roshad knew it was a bluff. Bors would never\
  \ hurt these people.</p> \n    <p>Fine—there were other spells. The climbing again.\
  \ Roshad began the incantation—</p> \n    <p>\"I wouldn't.\" The voice was the captain's,\
  \ albeit strained. The man emerged from between his troops, sweating but exultant.\
  \ To either side of him, warriors stood with bows drawn, arrows pointed straight\
  \ at Roshad's chest. The captain grinned and moved forward.</p> \n    <p>\"Now,\
  \ thief,\" he said, \"you'll give us back our prince.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
