  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Wow! What a year we\
  \ had in 2017. Thanks to you, our community, for supporting us in bringing the joys\
  \ of roleplaying to more players than ever before. I look forward to seeing what\
  \ we can do in 2018!</p> \n    <p>I'm currently on the road, enjoying the holidays\
  \ with my family, then gearing up for 2018 convention travel by heading out to MarsCon.\
  \ More on that below! The rest of the team is at Paizo HQ, working hard on upcoming\
  \ scenarios, updating additional resources, and a few other projects we will expand\
  \ upon in upcoming blogs. We've got lots planned and are hard at work making those\
  \ plans become reality.</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2>\n    <p>\
  \ Over the course of 2017, several of our stalwart GMs reached their 5<sup>th</sup>\
  \ star milestone in PFS. Requirements to achieve 5 star status include running 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 be special scenarios,\
  \ but are not indicative of hours spent preparing for events. A conservative estimate\
  \ of time needed to reach 5* is 650 hours! To our GMs listed below, thank you very\
  \ much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your\
  \ efforts are greatly appreciated.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Herman V Abelarde Jr</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Timothy Mace</li> \n     <li>Miguel Madrid del Ama</li> \n     <li>Stephen\
  \ Ross</li> \n     <li>Andrew Bourne</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>When we launched\
  \ Starfinder Society, the organized play team chose to track GM activity for the\
  \ two campaigns separately. As they are different systems and running one doesn't\
  \ grant automatic familiarity with the other, it made sense. To keep the star theme,\
  \ but make it different, we chose novas. At the time of announcement, we outline\
  \ the requirements for reaching 5 novas, as we didn't expect any GM to reach that\
  \ point in the first few months. Now that the campaign has a few months under its\
  \ belt, and with the announcement of two scenarios a month, we are revisiting the\
  \ topic of what milestones a GM must achieve to be recognized with the 5 nova status.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As this isn't just the org play teams campaign, it belongs to the players\
  \ too, I wanted to give our community a chance to weigh in on what they would like\
  \ to see the 5 nova status represent. Any criteria we use needs to be objective,\
  \ measurable, obtainable, and equitable. As this can be a very hot topic, and one\
  \ that may elicit polarizing opinions, I would ask you to send commentary via email\
  \ to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>. The\
  \ team will read all commentary and use it in our discussion of policy.</p> \n \
  \   <p></p>\n    <h2>Conventions</h2>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Our community hit the\
  \ ground running in 2018 and has put together quite a few events spanning the globe!\
  \ If you've wanted to travel to an event, but are unsure if there are Paizo organized\
  \ play activities, this list should help you out!</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block\

  \ <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> \n    <p>As we spin up 2018, watch for a few\
  \ more Call to Vol blogs. We will need GMs/HQ personnel for Gen Con and Origins\
  \ . We are also looking for volunteers willing to help demonstrate games in the\
  \ Paizo booth at UK Games Expo and PAX Unplugged. Calls for Gen Con, Origins, and\
  \ UKGE should go out within the first quarter, with PAX arrangements occurring in\
  \ July/August.</p> \n    <p>I've got the list of PaizoCon volunteer registrations\
  \ and will be working to match volunteers to tables over the week or two. I will\
  \ send emails to all registrants regarding their status. For those that hadn't completed\
  \ the form but wanted to volunteer, you can still register by completing the <a\
  \ href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/mxDA6BAqbY88LOWU2\"> PaizoCon 2018 Volunteer Registration</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>2018 Organized Play Staff Travel</h2> \n    <p>Last month, I added a\
  \ column to the convention list to show which events the organized play team planned\
  \ on attending. While helpful, it didn't allow for much pre-planning, since event\
  \ support requests submissions tend to be 1-2 months before the event. So this month,\
  \ I've pulled together a list of all events in 2018 that will have an organized\
  \ play staff presence. A few are listed as TBD and there may be some changes, as\
  \ who attends depends on workloads and availability, but this is our currently planned\
  \ itinerary.</p> \n    <p>If you are an event organizer and want to invite us out\
  \ at your event in 2019, drop an email to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> before next summer. We review our schedule in the fall\
  \ and try to get all decisions wrapped by the end of the year.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
