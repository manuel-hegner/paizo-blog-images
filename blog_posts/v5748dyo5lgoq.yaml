  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In <a href=\"/products/btpy99k6\"><em>Nightblade</em></a>,\
  \ Isiem is a fugitive, a former wizard-priest in the church of the dark god Zon-Kuthon\
  \ who rebelled and left his old life behind to follow his conscience. Now, his unique\
  \ heritage makes him perfect for a dangerous mission into an ancient dungeon, one\
  \ said to hold a magical weapon capable of slaying demons and devils by the thousands.\
  \ With allies ranging from a righteous paladin to the mercantile mercenaries of\
  \ the Aspis Consortium, it’s up to Isiem to lead the expedition back into shadowed\
  \ lands that are all too familiar...</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter One:\
  \ Plague Birds</h2> \n     <p>That's the last of the stevedores,\" Ena said. The\
  \ hooded dwarf unfolded herself from her perch atop the lintel of a barrelmaker's\
  \ shop, collapsed the miniature spyglass she'd been using to watch the warehouse\
  \ in the distance, and swung down to the street with a nimbleness that seemed at\
  \ odds with her stocky figure. \"We'll give them a few minutes to clear out, and\
  \ then it should just be us and the night watchmen around the warehouse.\" She raised\
  \ an eyebrow at Isiem, the gesture almost invisible in the shadows of her hood.\
  \ \"You're sure you can handle them?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Two untrained men with cudgels?\"\
  \ the Nidalese wizard asked dryly. \"I should hope so.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Without\
  \ killing them, please,\" another of their conspirators snapped. She was a tall\
  \ woman, almost as tall as Isiem himself, and although the red scarf wrapped around\
  \ the lower half of her face masked her features, he guessed she had some elven\
  \ blood. It was in the inflections of her voice, the litheness of her movements—\
  and her peremptory tone. He'd never met the woman before, and the rebels recognized\
  \ no ranks, yet she commanded him like a servant.</p> \n     <p>But it wasn't worth\
  \ the argument. It had been just over a year since Isiem joined the rebellion in\
  \ Pezzack, and in that time he had learned that the rebels were an impossible bundle\
  \ of contradictions. Merciless and merciful, crude but idealistic, largely disorganized\
  \ yet capable of orchestrating sophisticated attacks.</p> \n     <p>Their assault\
  \ on the warehouse was one such operation.</p> \n     <p>For years, the provincial\
  \ town of Pezzack had been a nest of rebellion against the diabolists who controlled\
  \ Imperial Cheliax. Its remoteness and the natural barricade of the mountainous,\
  \ monster-infested wastelands to its east made it difficult for Queen Abrogail's\
  \ agents to control. Despite two fiery assaults, infighting among the rebel factions,\
  \ and an ongoing campaign by the Chelish navy to starve the resistance into submission,\
  \ Pezzack remained effectively free.</p> \n     <p>That naval blockade was the reason\
  \ that Isiem stood out here, shivering on a frigid winter's night, amid a ring of\
  \ accomplices whose names and faces he did not know. Other than Ena, they were strangers\
  \ to him, and he to them. Hoods and masks hid their faces; an illusion guised his\
  \ own. None of them used names. If Chelish agents or insurgents from a rival faction\
  \ caught one of them—as had happened before, and would happen again—that unlucky\
  \ captive would have little to betray.</p> \n     <p>The only thing the conspirators\
  \ shared was their goal. Ena's informants had whispered that something terrible\
  \ was secreted in the crates that the stevedores had just unloaded into the loyalist-controlled\
  \ warehouse on the water. What it was, the informants hadn't known, but it was deemed\
  \ dangerous enough that Ena had contacted the best in the rebellion for help.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I wasn't planning to kill the watchmen,\" Isiem said, sifting through\
  \ the spell components arranged in his top pocket for easy access. He didn't need\
  \ to re-sort them—he knew them all with calm, sure familiarity—but the ritual soothed\
  \ him in the quiet moments before action. \"I'm well aware that it does no good\
  \ to turn their families against us. Besides, it's hardly necessary. They pose little\
  \ obstacle to our goal.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Likely to be bigger problems inside,\"\
  \ Ena said. \"Still don't know what, though. The devilers won't leave valuables\
  \ unguarded, but they won't use obvious guards either. Whatever's protecting their\
  \ goods, it's hidden and it's not living. They didn't have any extra guards on the\
  \ ship, nor meals carried down to the hold. My spies saw nothing. Might be the cargo\
  \ itself is the danger.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We should burn it,\" one of the other\
  \ masked conspirators interjected. His voice, like the half-elf's, was unfamiliar\
  \ to Isiem. Ena seemed to have reached farther afield than usual in putting together\
  \ this night's crew. \"Bar the doors and burn down the whole warehouse.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"That is a <i>profoundly</i> stupid idea,\" Ena said. \"Profoundly.\"\
  \ The dwarf stretched her legs and started toward the warehouse, melting in and\
  \ out of the shadows effortlessly in her mottled gray cloak. \"Let me remind you:\
  \ the point is to find out what the devilers are doing. If their cargo is valuable,\
  \ we want to steal it and sell it. If it's not, we want to find out what their plans\
  \ are. We can't do that if we burn it, now can we?\"</p> \n     <p>\"And the rest\
  \ of the warehouse is filled with food,\" the woman in the red scarf added. \"That's\
  \ what raised our suspicions initially. How often do ships carrying food get through\
  \ Governor Sawndannac's blockade? She's been trying to starve the Pezzacki into\
  \ submission for months. But even if it was a ruse to ensure we'd take in their\
  \ cargo, the fact remains that the warehouse <i>is</i> stocked with food. We can't\
  \ waste it.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8523-Kyril.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br>Kyril, like most paladins, has little tolerance for evildoers.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Chastened, the man offered no answer. Ena didn't seem to\
  \ want one. The dwarf turned back to them long enough to hold one finger up to her\
  \ lips, under her hood, then pointed to the right side of the warehouse and held\
  \ up two more. With that, she slipped off to the warehouse's left side, facing the\
  \ water, where a smaller side door stood beside the large loading doors. The dwarf\
  \ crouched against the wall, working on the padlock that secured the smaller door.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Isiem went the other way. He could see the watchmen coming; their lanterns\
  \ cut bright lines through the night's salty fog. They kept close together, sheltering\
  \ themselves against the dark. Their oiled cloaks were beaded with damp, their hoods\
  \ pulled low so that he could not see their faces.</p> \n     <p>Not that he needed\
  \ to. As the watchmen passed a narrow alley between two warehouses, Isiem struck.\
  \ He sifted a pinch of fine sand from a pocket, letting it trickle to the ground\
  \ while he spoke the words of magic that would send his unknowing victims into slumber.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As its last word left his lips, Isiem's spell seized the watchmen. Without\
  \ a word of protest, they slumped gently into the fog.</p> \n     <p>Isiem swiftly\
  \ bound and gagged the men. They woke as soon as Isiem stuffed the rags into their\
  \ mouths, but were too startled to offer much resistance. One after the other, he\
  \ pulled the struggling watchmen into the alley and out of casual view. Morning\
  \ would find them stiff, cold, and scared—but they'd live to see the new day, and\
  \ that was all the kindness he could spare them.</p> \n     <p>At his signal, two\
  \ of the other conspirators took up the guards' badges, cudgels, and fallen lanterns.\
  \ Raising their lights to cut through the night, the false watchmen took up the\
  \ patrol. They'd maintain the illusion that nothing was amiss, and serve as a first\
  \ line of warning if some outside threat should intrude.</p> \n     <p>Isiem went\
  \ around to the waterfront side of the warehouse. Ena had forced the lock on the\
  \ small office door. The dwarf eased the door open and waved Isiem and the woman\
  \ in the red scarf forward, slipping ahead of them into the warehouse. None of them\
  \ carried a light; either by magic or by the innate gifts of their blood, they could\
  \ see well enough by the misty moon.</p> \n     <p>Shelves and pallets filled the\
  \ warehouse in towering rows. Pezzack was not a large town, and its warehouses were\
  \ modest, but even so it was disorienting for Isiem to see corded bundles of salt\
  \ cod stacked higher than his head, or rows of hanging hams like impossibly fat,\
  \ salt-crusted bats crowded in a roost. The pungent aroma of garlic mingled with\
  \ the spicy fragrance of the long, wrinkled red peppers that the Pezzacki called\
  \ \"rooster's beak\"; under it all was the earthy odor of the cured meats that filled\
  \ most of the visible space.</p> \n     <p>\"Where's their bloody secret cargo?\"\
  \ Ena muttered, stopping amid a cluster of hams. The dwarf pulled a small charm\
  \ out from under her jerkin: a single-pointed blue crystal wrapped in silver wire\
  \ and hung from a leather thong. She slipped it from around her neck and let it\
  \ dangle from her fingers, watching it intently through the dusty gloom.</p> \n\
  \     <p>After a moment, the crystal vibrated, then pulled toward a few unassuming\
  \ wooden boxes stacked under a heap of grain sacks. \"Magic,\" Ena grunted in satisfaction,\
  \ putting her charm back on and tucking the crystal under her shirt. \"There'll\
  \ be something more than carrots and onions in those boxes, I'll wager.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Be ready,\" said the woman in the red scarf. She drew a longsword with\
  \ a smooth, blued blade. Another crimson scarf wrapped its hilt, but the pommel\
  \ was bare, and on it Isiem saw a sword-and-halo etched in gold. Iomedae's mark.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Help me with these sacks,\" Ena told Isiem, grabbing one end of a\
  \ sizable bag.</p> \n     <p>It must have weighed over eighty pounds, and the dwarf's\
  \ short stature made moving it awkward. Isiem hoisted the other side with a grunt,\
  \ helping Ena ease it to the floor. He tipped his chin at the woman who stood poised\
  \ with her sword. \"She could help, instead of trying to stare down this barley.\
  \ She's probably stronger than either of us.\"</p> \n     <p>Ena snorted. \"That's\
  \ what paladins do. Look noble while the rest of us do the heavy lifting.\" She\
  \ raised her voice, directing two of the other conspirators: \"Get the next sack.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Minutes later, with the grain sacks piled on the floor, Ena pried\
  \ open the top box under the paladin's watchful gaze. She brushed aside a layer\
  \ of straw and sacking, then paused and stepped back slowly. \"Wizard. Come here.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Isiem came forward. The box was packed tight with bones, all painted\
  \ black. Most appeared to be the bones of large birds, although he couldn't tell\
  \ whether they were from eagles, vultures, or some rarer breed. He'd never been\
  \ a great student of the natural world.</p> \n     <p>Alongside those bones were\
  \ others that seemed to be the fleshless hands and arms of some small, clawed creatures.\
  \ Kobolds, perhaps; Isiem judged that they were slightly too small, and the claws\
  \ too developed, to belong to goblins. They, too, had been painted entirely black.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He picked through the bones. They had been stacked in neat, careful\
  \ rows, nestled together to conserve space. Gummy, necromantic preservatives stained\
  \ their joints and the crevices under the hands' hooked claws.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  What is it?\" Ena asked tensely.</p> \n     <p>\"Undead of some type, I think. I've\
  \ never seen ones quite like this.\" Isiem shrugged, stepping back. \"Open the next\
  \ box.\"</p> \n     <p>The next box contained more black-painted bones, as did the\
  \ one beneath it. The final box, however, held something different under its coat\
  \ of yellow straw. Hinged glass cases, each filled with dead birds, gleamed inside.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Isiem picked up one of the cases. It held eight birds ranging in size\
  \ from crows to sparrows, and it felt strangely light in his hands. A whiff of funereal\
  \ spices—frankincense, sandalwood, Osirian black resin—hinted that it, too, bore\
  \ some necromantic spell. A curled copper shaving on each of the birds' eyes, and\
  \ a sprinkling of salt in their feathers, told him what that magic was: a rite to\
  \ stave off decay.</p> \n     <p>More cases of dead birds filled the box. Isiem\
  \ peered more closely at the one in his hands. The birds' throats looked swollen,\
  \ as if they'd all swallowed eggs that had lodged in their gullets, and there seemed\
  \ to be a dried, flaky residue about their nostrils and the sides of their beaks\
  \ ...But even though his magic allowed him to see clearly in the dark, it was impossible\
  \ to be sure through the glass.</p> \n     <p>Curiosity pushed him to open the case,\
  \ even as caution pulled him back. Isiem didn't recognize the necromancy at work\
  \ here, nor could he identify the disease that had killed the birds—if what he'd\
  \ seen <i>was</i> a disease, and not some poison or side effect of the preservative\
  \ spell—but he wanted to. Pezzack had little to interest a wizard of any real skill,\
  \ and less to challenge one; Isiem had spent much of the past year mired in boredom.\
  \ This was a mystery, and that pleased him.</p> \n     <p>He didn't want to kill\
  \ his collaborators for the sake of his own curiosity, though. Or himself. Glancing\
  \ over at the Iomedaean, Isiem asked, \"Can you cure diseases?\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ nodded silently.</p> \n     <p>\"Good.\" Isiem turned to Ena, who had taken up\
  \ a seat on the barley sacks and was chewing a piece of purloined ham while she\
  \ watched. \"Warn the others not to come in here, please. I'm about to do something\
  \ very stupid, I suspect.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That's always promising.\" The dwarf\
  \ stuffed her slice of ham into a pocket and stood up. \"Try not to actually do\
  \ it until I get back. Don't want to be surprised any more than I have to.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She disappeared amid the warehouse shelves, returning moments later\
  \ with a satisfied nod. \"It's done. I told them not to come back in until I give\
  \ leave, whatever they hear in here. The three of us will have to handle whatever\
  \ you're about to unleash.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing, I hope.\" Isiem unlatched\
  \ the case. Even as he grasped the glass lid to lift it, however, a clatter and\
  \ rustle from the bone boxes told him that his hopes were for naught.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"So much for that,\" Ena said, reaching into her cloak. Spinning on her left\
  \ foot to face the boxed bones, she pulled out a small, spherical glass bottle that\
  \ sloshed with liquid. The dwarf did something to it—Isiem couldn't see what—and\
  \ flung the glass ball at the boxed bones.</p> \n     <p>With a crystalline tinkle,\
  \ it exploded into a cloud of thick, fragrant fog. Bones rattled and scratched against\
  \ the boxes' wood as if a dozen skeletons were dancing a jig within the mists. The\
  \ undead were rising.</p> \n     <p>The paladin strode forward, her shield raised\
  \ with one gauntleted hand and her longsword shining radiantly in the other. The\
  \ fog glowed around her like a sunlit cloud—and then it erupted into a second flurry\
  \ of motion, this time from the inside out, as dozens of avian skeletons hurtled\
  \ up in a lace-winged flock. They hurled themselves into the paladin's face, threw\
  \ their bodies against her shield, bashed against her armored legs. The sheer momentum\
  \ of the skeletal flock drove the woman stumbling backward. Her red scarf fell away,\
  \ confirming Isiem's suspicions that she was a half-elf.</p> \n     <p>\"You were\
  \ wrong,\" Ena said, letting a second glass ball tumble back into her cloak. She\
  \ sidestepped around the chaos, looking for an opening. A pair of hooked knives\
  \ flashed in her hands, reflecting the blue fire of the paladin's sword. \"They're\
  \ not undead. That fog is holy water, and it isn't doing anything to them.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I can see that,\" Isiem said through gritted teeth.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ black-boned birds weren't attacking the paladin. She was only an obstacle to them,\
  \ and they whirled past her like windblown leaves parting around a tree trunk. What\
  \ they wanted—what drew them and drove them—was in the glass cases at Isiem's feet.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>They swept toward him, sieving the air with their whistling wings. Between\
  \ the birds' naked ribs, the skeletal kobold hands dangled like stirrups, twitching\
  \ as they neared the cases and their cargo of dead birds.</p> \n     <p>As they\
  \ drew near their goal, the flock funneled into a tight formation: a vortex of bones\
  \ spinning toward Isiem. His hood blew back as they approached. Dust stung his eyes,\
  \ blurring the oncoming skeletons into a single dark cloud.</p> \n     <p>He could\
  \ still see them well enough to kill them, though. Squinting through his tears,\
  \ Isiem focused on a spell.</p> \n     <p>The wizard plucked a tiny crystal cone\
  \ from a pocket. Holding the cone to his lips as if it were a war horn, Isiem whispered\
  \ an incantation through the polished stone. As he spoke the last word, he pointed\
  \ two fingers in a V directed at the flock of winged skeletons and the paladin still\
  \ caught in their midst.</p> \n     <p>The half-elf threw herself to the floor,\
  \ not a moment too soon. Wintry cold and bitter frost blew from Isiem's crystal,\
  \ smashing into the skeletal birds. Several of them burst apart immediately, blasted\
  \ into pieces by the elemental force of the cold. Shards of their bones ricocheted\
  \ off the walls and embedded themselves in the hanging hams like hellish peppercorns.\
  \ Others froze and fell to the ground, where their ice-rimed bones shattered on\
  \ impact. A few flapped away at the edges, slow and lopsided under sudden coats\
  \ of ice. Ena pounced on the crippled birds, smashing them to the ground with a\
  \ box lid and stomping them under her boots.</p> \n     <p>In seconds, it was over.\
  \ The paladin picked up a discarded piece of straw-flecked sacking and scooped the\
  \ last of the struggling skeletons into it, then dropped the whole bundle into one\
  \ of the empty boxes and put the lid back on. \"I don't think these were made to\
  \ fight,\" she said, while knotting a rope around the box. Its lid thumped with\
  \ the captive skeletons' efforts at escape. \"They had some other purpose. Do you\
  \ know what it was?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I have a guess,\" Isiem said, \"but it's only\
  \ a guess.\"</p> \n     <p>The half-elven woman rubbed her forehead, where a long\
  \ red scratch disappeared into her dark auburn hair. With the scarf gone, she was\
  \ a handsome woman, with high cheekbones and a strong square jaw. Not girlish, and\
  \ perhaps not beautiful in the traditional sense, but possessed of a calm certitude\
  \ that drew the eye. \"I expect you'll want to study them, then.\" She examined\
  \ her sword for dirt or damage, found none, and sheathed it. \"Can you do so safely?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I should be able to.\" Isiem plucked a shard of black bone from\
  \ the side of a ham. He could see no sign that the meat had been contaminated, but\
  \ he pulled out a small knife and carved out the flesh around the puncture mark\
  \ anyway. One never knew what taints such creatures carried. \"Help me collect the\
  \ pieces, please.\"</p> \n     <p>It didn't take long to collect the larger bones.\
  \ The smaller fragments, however, had been scattered across the warehouse by the\
  \ force of Isiem's icy blast, and spotting them among the piles of spilled grain\
  \ was tedious work. After the better part of an hour, they still hadn't gathered\
  \ all the pieces, and Ena began to cast meaningful glances toward the door.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"We should go,\" the dwarf said. \"It'll be sunrise soon, and someone\
  \ might come to check on the watchmen. No need to linger looking for bone scraps.\
  \ We've got enough.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'd like to find them all,\" Isiem said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Why?\" Ena pushed down her hood, rubbing at a nick above her left\
  \ ear. Short brown stubble covered most of her head, but scars from a long-ago explosion\
  \ left irregular bald patches across her scalp and eyebrows. \"You can't cover up\
  \ that we were here. The devilers are going to know that anyway. All you'll do is\
  \ maybe get yourself caught.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I won't get caught.\" Isiem showed\
  \ her one of the little balls of resin he kept tucked in a pocket. An ivory eyelash\
  \ was embedded in the gum, its pale arc barely visible. \"Not by any ordinary watchman.\
  \ And if they've got someone capable of breaking through my magic, we'll have trouble\
  \ whether or not I stay to pick up these bones.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What makes the\
  \ bones so important?\" the half-elven paladin asked. \"Why risk yourself over them,\
  \ even if you do have a spell to hide with?\" She had wrapped the red scarf around\
  \ her face again, concealing everything but her eyes, so Isiem could not be sure\
  \ of her expression.</p> \n     <p>He heard no suspicion in her voice, though, only\
  \ honest curiosity, and so he answered honestly in turn. \"I think they're plaguebearers.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Plaguebearers?\" Ena recoiled. She eyed the toppled boxes nervously,\
  \ scrubbing a hand against the front of her jerkin as if trying to rid herself of\
  \ some invisible stain. \"When were you planning to warn us?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  When we left.\" Isiem shrugged. \"The paladin says she can cure diseases, and I\
  \ don't think the plague is directed at us, nor do I think the sickness escaped\
  \ from its bonds. In my estimation, we are in little danger. Nonetheless, I'd rather\
  \ not risk ordinary Pezzacki if we can avoid it. I've been wrong before.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Who's it meant for, then?\" Ena asked. \"They sent it to us.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"The strix,\" said the paladin. Her dark eyes hardened above the scarf.\
  \ \"Birds, not people. Those dead birds in the cases are meant to carry sickness.\
  \ The winged skeletons were meant to ...disperse them, perhaps?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Something like that,\" Isiem agreed. \"The preserved birds hold the sickness, and\
  \ the skeletal carriers see that it reaches its intended victims. The cases were\
  \ not opened, so the plague should be contained. That's my theory, anyway. It's\
  \ only a theory. I'll need to study them.\" He waved them toward the door. \"In\
  \ the meantime, I'll try to find the rest of these bone fragments. Don't wait for\
  \ me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We'll meet at the usual place when you're ready,\" Ena said.\
  \ \"Two days?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Two days.\" Without waiting for Ena and her taller\
  \ companion to leave the warehouse, Isiem resumed his search for the scattered pieces.\
  \ A cold draft through the door told him when they had gone.</p> \n     <p>Hours\
  \ later, stiff-backed and bleary-eyed, Isiem looked up to see soft gray light spilling\
  \ through the warehouse's small, filthy windows. Morning was upon him. His spell\
  \ of disguise had long since faded, and although he wasn't sure if he'd found all\
  \ the bone shards in the warehouse, there was no more time to look. He had to go\
  \ now, or risk being seen and recognized when the sun rose high enough to show his\
  \ face.</p> \n     <p>The boxes were already stacked and waiting by the warehouse\
  \ doors. Isiem cinched the neck of the sack he'd been filling and dropped it atop\
  \ the heap. He plucked a few strands from a knot of horsehair in his pocket and\
  \ let them float to the ground, weaving a short incantation between the falling\
  \ threads.</p> \n     <p>From shadows and sea fog and five scattered hairs, a mottled\
  \ black horse arose. It stood patiently as Isiem loaded the cases onto the black\
  \ horse's back, covered them with sacking and fastened the bundle in place with\
  \ crisscrossed ropes, then took the animal's bridle and led it out to the streets\
  \ of Pezzack.</p> \n     <p>Off in the distance, blurred by fog, the small lantern-lit\
  \ boats of fishermen pushed out to the cold black sea past the creaking, floating\
  \ hulks of Docktown. Across the way, a baker's hearth threw a warm orange glow like\
  \ a lighthouse in the mist. No one else was awake or abroad. Fog swirled over the\
  \ ruts in the town's dirt roads and slicked the cobblestones of its few paved streets.\
  \ It enclosed Isiem in a gentle haze, lulling him toward somnolence.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Until he rounded a corner and found himself abruptly face to face with a child.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The child was eight, ten, something like that. Boy or girl, he couldn't\
  \ tell. Wide brown eyes, a smattering of freckles, a dirty wool cap pulled low over\
  \ protruding ears. A puff of startled breath escaped the child's lips and hung white\
  \ in the air between them.</p> \n     <p>Their gazes locked, and in those huge waif's\
  \ eyes Isiem saw a fatal flash of recognition.</p> \n     <p>His illusory disguise\
  \ was gone. It was his true face that the child saw. And that face, Isiem knew,\
  \ was difficult to forget. As filled with colorful eccentrics as Pezzack was, a\
  \ near-albino Nidalese from the Uskwood still stood out. There was only one such\
  \ man in this part of Cheliax, and that one was known to be wanted.</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ would be remembered. If the child was a loyalist—as some were, even in this rebellion-rife\
  \ border town—Isiem could be reported. Then the Hellknights would come, implacable\
  \ in iron, and the tensions in Pezzack would explode.</p> \n     <p>If the child\
  \ was a spy for one of the other rebel groups, Isiem's position wasn't much better.\
  \ The Galtan faction, led by a madman named Habar Curl, was always looking for proof\
  \ that his rivals were insufficiently pure in their dedication to the cause. The\
  \ slightest whiff of cooperation with Imperial Cheliax was enough to earn a beheading,\
  \ as far as they were concerned, and tolerating a Nidalese traitor went far beyond\
  \ that. There was no question that if he caught Isiem's friends, Habar Curl would\
  \ bend their necks to his blade.</p> \n     <p>The safest course, therefore, would\
  \ be to kill the child. It would be so very easy in the sleeping silence of the\
  \ town. The mists would hide his bloody work; the sea would swallow its aftermath.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But Isiem hesitated, and the child spun on his foot—<i>her</i> foot?—\
  and in a swirl of rags and skittering footsteps, vanished into the night.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Isiem didn't pursue. Swallowing a mixture of relief and fear, he tightened\
  \ his grip on the black horse's reins and turned down his own path through Pezzack.\
  \ Once again, quiet closed around him, broken only by the muted clop of the horse's\
  \ hooves and the clacking of bones inside the boxes it bore. </p> \n     <p>It was\
  \ not a loud sound, but that clacking filled the wizard's ears with echoes. Other\
  \ places, other bones. Pangolais. Nisroch. Westcrown.</p> \n     <p>He had enough\
  \ of those burdening his conscience already. Deaths filled his memories: friends,\
  \ enemies, victims of fate and circumstance. Some had been avoidable. Most had not.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As he turned down the last twisting alley to his temporary refuge, Isiem\
  \ wondered about tonight's encounter. Was it sparing the child or killing him that\
  \ was the mistake?</p> \n     <p>He didn't know. He couldn't. Such knowledge was\
  \ not for mortals in this world.</p> \n     <p>But there was only one choice that\
  \ he would not regret. And as he stepped into the quiet darkness of his borrowed\
  \ home, leaving the budding dawn behind, Isiem knew that he had made it.</p> \n\
