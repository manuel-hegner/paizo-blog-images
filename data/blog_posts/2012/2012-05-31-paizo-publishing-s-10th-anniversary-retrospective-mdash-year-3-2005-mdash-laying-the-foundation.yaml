  \            <h2>Laying the Foundation</h2>\n            <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ May 31, 2012</p>\n            <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><em>This blog\
  \ entry is the fourth in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</em></p>\n            <p>At the start of 2005, the loss of our\
  \ friends and co-workers who had worked on <em>Undefeated</em> and <em>Amazing Stories</em>\
  \ still lay heavily on our hearts, but the feeling in the company that we had already\
  \ hit bottom and there was nowhere left to go but upward was oddly hopeful. Nevertheless,\
  \ there was a lot of revenue that still needed to be made up for from the loss of\
  \ <em>Star Wars Insider</em> a year and a half earlier. If we were going to be <em>just</em>\
  \ the <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> magazine company, we would still need\
  \ to get much leaner, which would mean more layoffs—something none of us wanted\
  \ to go through again. Instead of retreating, we needed to secure new territory.</p>\n\
  \            <p>In January, the top managers in the company met at my house. The\
  \ goal was to find new uses for Paizo's existing people and skills, with an eye\
  \ toward quickly increasing revenue. Instead of focusing on actual product ideas\
  \ at this meeting, we were looking for broad categories of things we were already\
  \ good at. Here are the strategies we devised that afternoon:</p>\n            <ol>\n\
  \             <li>Use our strong position in the distribution chain to help other\
  \ publishers get their products into game stores, taking a bit off the top for our\
  \ efforts.</li>\n             <li>Increase paizo.com sales by expanding the scope\
  \ of products available on the website through partnerships with other publishers,\
  \ who would in turn bring in new customers for us.</li>\n             <li>Expand\
  \ our license for <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> to create official non-magazine\
  \ Dungeons &amp; Dragons products—especially those we could base on in-demand but\
  \ out-of-print material from the magazines.</li>\n             <li>Create generic\
  \ gaming accessories that would appeal to our RPG customers.</li>\n            \
  \ <li>Expand Paizo into areas of gaming outside of RPGs that would spread our risk\
  \ around.</li>\n             <div class=\"blurb180\">\n              <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog5.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog5_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n              <br>\n               The tower of Shackled City\
  \ hardcovers at Gen Con was as tall as some of our customers!\n             </div>\n\
  \             <li>Expand our subscriber base for <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ while continuing to make those businesses more efficient.</li>\n            </ol>\n\
  \            <p>With those in place, we next had a brainstorm session with the entire\
  \ Paizo staff to come up with some product ideas that might fit those strategies.\
  \ A key rule of brainstorming is that you don't critique any ideas at first; you\
  \ just write them down and discuss them later... so everything got recorded for\
  \ posterity: the good, the bad, and the ugly. (See below for the results of our\
  \ brainstorm.) Some of these ideas came to fruition, including the compilation of\
  \ comic strips, the DM Workbook (which turned into our <a href=\"/products/btpy7fiz\"\
  >Campaign Workbook</a>), preprinted plastic/vinyl maps (which evolved into the <a\
  \ href=\"/gameMastery/maps\">Flip-Mat line</a>), and a few others. Some were just\
  \ plain silly, like LARPing with paintball rules, the swimsuit edition, minted Greyhawk\
  \ coins (though the <a href=\"/store/gameAids/other/campaignCoins\">GameMastery\
  \ Campaign Coins</a> line comes close), cereal bowls, and replica D&amp;D artifacts.\
  \ (That last one, and some of the others, also involved a lot of wishful thinking\
  \ about things that our license with Wizards of the Coast didn't even <em>begin</em>\
  \ to cover.)</p>\n            <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n             <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog10.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog10_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n            </div>\n            <p>Now that we had a plan,\
  \ we spent the rest of 2005 executing it. The most visible result was probably our\
  \ first two hardcover books. <a href=\"/products/btpy7dx9\">The Shackled City hardcover</a>\
  \ compiled the first-ever Adventure Path into a huge 416-page book. Magazines have\
  \ a short shelf-life by design, and The Shackled City was originally spread across\
  \ 11 non-consecutive issues of a magazine that was still bimonthly at the start,\
  \ so the first chapters of the AP had already been out of print for over 2 years.\
  \ Because D&amp;D 3.5 had been released during this time, we also needed to update\
  \ the first few chapters from 3.0. We generally fine-tuned things throughout based\
  \ on customer feedback, and we even had Chris Perkins write a whole new adventure\
  \ to fill an XP gap. James Jacobs slaved away many an evening—on top of his normal\
  \ <em>Dungeon</em> duties—getting this book ready to go. We released it just before\
  \ Gen Con, and had a huge stack of them for sale at our booth.</p>\n           \
  \ <div class=\"blurb180\">\n             <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog7.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog7_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \           <br>\n              The full <a href=\"/dungeon/products/issues/greyhawkmap\"\
  >Greyhawk map from Dungeon 118–121</a>.\n            </div>\n            <p>At the\
  \ end of the year, The Shackled City's sister book was released. The <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7dxa\"><em>Dragon Compendium Volume 1</em></a> (yep—we had hoped to\
  \ release additional volumes in subsequent years) compiled some of the top articles\
  \ from the long history of <em>Dragon</em> magazine, updated to 3.5 where necessary.\
  \ Erik Mona spent many an evening going through the entire <em>Dragon</em> archive\
  \ and tagging pages for future reference. To this day, our archive copies have those\
  \ little tags sticking out of the top of every issue, a testament to how thorough\
  \ Erik was in his task!</p>\n            <p>We brought <em>Dungeon</em> one of the\
  \ most highly anticipated events of its history at the beginning of 2005. Back in\
  \ the days of Team Greyhawk at Wizards of the Coast, we had begun making the Greyhawk\
  \ map to end all Greyhawk maps. We pored through every Greyhawk source we could\
  \ find and made sure every single location ever mentioned was on the map. Sadly,\
  \ the project was shelved at the time. However, when Paizo was looking for something\
  \ to help raise awareness of the new and improved <em>Dungeon</em>, we hit upon\
  \ the idea of breaking that enormous map into four parts, which we released in consecutive\
  \ issues. <em>Dungeon</em> #118–121 ended up being some of the most popular and\
  \ best-selling issues in the magazine's history.</p>\n            <div class=\"\
  blurb180\">\n             <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog6.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog6_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n      \
  \       <br>\n              The Age of Worms Adventure Path kicked off in 2005.\n\
  \            </div>\n            <p>Another big change for <em>Dungeon</em> was\
  \ making the Adventure Path a monthly feature. Beginning with Erik Mona's now infamous\
  \ adventure \"The Whispering Cairn\" in <a href=\"/products/btpy7ym6?Dungeon-Issue-124\"\
  ><em>Dungeon</em> 124</a>, the new <a href=\"/dungeon/products/issues/ageOfWorms\"\
  >Age of Worms AP</a> brought new stories every single month, climaxing in the demigod\
  \ Kyuss's attempt to enter the world of Oerth. From that point in July 2005 onward,\
  \ we've scheduled a new Adventure Path installment every single month!</p>\n   \
  \         <p><em>Dragon</em> didn't have any earth-shattering events in 2005, just\
  \ a refinement of the changes we'd debuted at the previous Gen Con. A couple of\
  \ regular articles in particular had become reader favorites: One was James Jacobs's\
  \ \"Demonomicon of Iggwilv\" articles, delving into the details of D&amp;D's biggest\
  \ bads. Fraz-Urb'luu and Zuggtmoy had their fiendish plans unveiled in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7y9x\">issues #333</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy7ufi\">#337</a>\
  \ respectively. We started Sean K Reynolds's \"Core Beliefs\" series, which covered\
  \ Greyhawk deities in the same depth that Faiths and Pantheons had brought to the\
  \ Realms gods. We also started the \"Worm Food\" series, providing information especially\
  \ useful to folks playing though the Age of Worms Adventure Path running over in\
  \ <em>Dungeon</em>.</p>\n            <p>While our first two hardcovers were certainly\
  \ the stars of the 2005 lineup, we also launched another line of products which\
  \ has been much more prolific over the intervening years. GameMastery was envisioned\
  \ as a line that would provide GMs with a wealth of tools that they could use to\
  \ augment their ongoing campaigns. Our first product was the <a href=\"/store/games/miniatures/miniaturesForRoleplaying/compleatEncounters\"\
  >Compleat Encounter</a> line, which brought to reality an idea I'd had for years.\
  \ In my own campaigns, I struggle when my players have random encounters that turn\
  \ out to be more substantial than an orc or two. I'd always wanted a line of products\
  \ that would give you a map, a couple of miniatures, and a mini-adventure that you\
  \ could just plop into your campaign. I really wanted the miniatures to be prepainted\
  \ plastic, but that was beyond our capabilities. My good friend Bob Watts (formerly\
  \ at Grenadier, Heartbreaker, Ral Partha, and Games Workshop) helped Paizo create\
  \ our first unpainted metal miniatures by getting us in touch with the best sculptors,\
  \ painters, mold makers, and miniatures spinners. All we needed was somebody to\
  \ draw the maps and write the adventures.</p>\n            <p>For the first two\
  \ releases, we turned to longtime <em>Dungeon</em> cartographer Chris West for the\
  \ maps. Wayne Reynolds provided us with design sketches for minis that we turned\
  \ over to sculptors Neil McKenzie and Dennis Mize. And Mike Mearls wrote the adventures,\
  \ using one of our spare desks as his part-time office. Dark Elf Sanctum and Death\
  \ Shrine of the Ninja Cult released in September and October, and saw pretty good\
  \ sales for a miniatures product. In the subsequent months, further Compleat Encounters\
  \ were written by James Jacobs, Keith Strohm, Jason Bulmahn, and Sean K Reynolds,\
  \ with Corey Macourek contributing maps and Andrew Hou designing minis. Some of\
  \ the villains that would become iconic in the not-yet-even-dreamed-of Pathfinder\
  \ campaign setting saw their births in this line, including the Whispering Tyrant\
  \ and the Gorilla King. Ultimately, though, the line was more effort than it was\
  \ really worth, and because the cost of metal for making the miniatures skyrocketed\
  \ that winter, we decided to end the line in April 2006. (For trivia buffs, this\
  \ line provided three of the very few Paizo products that were cancelled after being\
  \ officially announced: Fane of the Black Adept, which would have been written by\
  \ Wes Schneider; and Stand &amp; Deliver and War Golem Factory, which hadn't been\
  \ assigned to writers.)</p>\n            <div class=\"blurb180\">\n            \

  \ product line.\n            </div>\n            <p>The other GameMastery line that\
  \ debuted that year, Map Packs, have done quite a bit better for us. We kicked off\
  \ the line in November 2005 with the now sold-out <a href=\"/products/btpy8kqu\"\
  >Map Pack: Village</a>. Using the same 5\" x 7\" map tile configuration that we\
  \ created for the Compleat Encounter line, Map Packs were envisioned as a tool that\
  \ GMs could use on the fly, giving them high-quality graphics to replace the marker\
  \ scribblings most of us manage on our own. The fact that we've just released our\
  \ 37th Map Pack shows you just how successful this product line has been!</p>\n\
  \            <p>In an effort to expand Paizo's business into other types of games,\
  \ we announced the formation of Titanic Games at Gen Con. Titanic Games found its\
  \ genesis at the same con the previous year when Bob Watts and I were talking with\
  \ Cheapass Games proprietor James Ernest. James had built an entire business around\
  \ the premise that folks tend to have all the bits and pieces they need for most\
  \ games—dice, pawns, and such—so he could provide high-value games at low cost by\
  \ supplying only the unique parts—usually, rules, game boards, and cards, printed\
  \ in black-and-white on thick paper, with clip-art illustrations, often packaged\
  \ in an unassuming envelope. Titanic Games started with the idea of flipping that\
  \ premise back around—bringing high production values to some of the most popular\
  \ Cheapass Games. Of course, we announced that we'd be starting with the number\
  \ one game in the Cheapass portfolio, <a href=\"/products/btpy8ar0\">Kill Doctor\
  \ Lucky</a>. James, along with fellow designer Mike Selinker, had a few non-Cheapass\
  \ ideas kicking around too, including one that we thought could be a real game changer...\
  \ but that story will have to wait until 2006.</p>\n            <p>We also took\
  \ our first shot at using our existing distribution chain to help out other companies\
  \ in 2005. Order of the Stick creative guru Rich Burlew had already produced two\
  \ printed compilations of his webcomic early in 2005, and they'd quickly sold out\
  \ and already needed to be reprinted. Rich had found that sending out all of those\
  \ books was taking time and effort that he really wanted to direct back to drawing\
  \ his strips, so he was open to working with us to handle those things for him.\
  \ We announced our partnership in September, along with the news that Order of the\
  \ Stick would now appear monthly in <em>Dragon</em>. We had similar deals in the\
  \ works with other companies; we'll talk about those in the 2006 blog.</p>\n   \
  \         <p>The paizo.com online store really started to take off in 2005. We created\
  \ several strategic relationships with manufacturers and publishers that wanted\
  \ to get their products into the hands of the growing <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ customer base. In 2005, among the most successful were a variety of T-shirt manufacturers\
  \ who began to offer their funny and geeky designs through paizo.com. We also began\
  \ selling PDFs of Paizo issues of <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> in March,\
  \ and added our first third-party PDF publisher, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/r/roninArts\"\
  >Ronin Arts</a>, in May. And we alerted gamers to the trove of products available\
  \ at paizo.com by adding a few catalog pages to the back of <em>Dragon</em>. By\
  \ the end of the year, paizo.com online sales had beaten 2004 by more than 500%.</p>\n\
  \            <p>At Gen Con, Paizo made our return to the ENnie Awards, raking in\
  \ 4 gold awards and a silver. The awards received were:</p>\n            <blockquote>\n\

  \ Sutter: The Little Intern That Could</h2>\n            <p>First off, let's set\
  \ something straight: I started working for Paizo in 2004, not 2005. Sure, I may\
  \ not have had a desk, or technically been inside the office more than a handful\
  \ of times. And maybe only Lisa knew my name. But I was there, dang it!</p>\n  \
  \          <p>In fall 2004, I was 20 years old. I had graduated from the University\
  \ of Washington the previous spring, and was scraping by via a combination of freelance\
  \ journalism for local papers, teaching SAT prep courses to high school kids, and\
  \ a chunk of change gained by getting my butt kicked on Wheel of Fortune (a story\
  \ in itself). Having already realized that I didn't want to spend my life covering\
  \ obituaries and little league games, I was searching the classified ads for some\
  \ sort of magazine job when I ran across a listing for the Editor-in-Chief of <em>Amazing\
  \ Stories</em>. The realization that such an important SF magazine—not to mention\
  \ <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em>—was located just a few miles from where I\
  \ was living clinched it: I needed to work at Paizo Publishing.</p>\n          \
  \  <p>The only problem was that there was no way I was qualified for the Editor-in-Chief\
  \ position. So instead, I emailed folks at the company trying to find out if perhaps\
  \ there were any other positions that needed filling—things they hadn't got around\
  \ to posting yet. Eventually I ended up talking to Lisa, and she brought me into\
  \ the old office (now the old-old office) for an interview.</p>\n            <p>Before\
  \ this blog results in a flood of people asking Lisa for a job, I should emphasize\
  \ that I already had a pretty solid portfolio at this point—I'd sold more than a\
  \ hundred articles to various papers, and had a few short stories published in fiction\
  \ 'zines. In any case, Lisa looked at my credentials, and told me that while there\
  \ were no editorial positions open, she thought she could find something for me.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Which is how I ended up collecting images for products on the newborn\
  \ paizo.com web store at a nickel a jpg. Hardly the most glamorous position, but\
  \ every time I walked into the office to pick up a check, I would look over at the\
  \ side of the office with the big <em>Amazing Stories</em> banner and think, \"\
  Someday, I'm going to have a desk there.\"</p>\n            <p>It turned out I was\
  \ right. After several months of contract work, Lisa brought me in as Paizo's very\
  \ first Editorial Intern. The position even came with a desk in the <em>Amazing\
  \ Stories</em> side of the building!</p>\n            <p>Except that, unknown to\
  \ me, the entire staff of <em>Amazing Stories</em> and <em>Undefeated</em> had been\
  \ laid off a few weeks prior. The banner was still there, right above my desk—but\
  \ now all the other desks were empty. I was alone in a cubicle wasteland.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Still, it didn't matter—I was officially on the inside now. Wes\
  \ Schneider, himself the youngest person at Paizo until I came along, was the first\
  \ of the editorial team to make the long walk across the building and introduce\
  \ himself, exposing me to a wide array of internet humor in an effort to determine\
  \ my taste. Slowly the other editors—a generally shy and skittish lot—began to get\
  \ to know me as well, and I ceased to be just \"that kid,\" instead becoming \"\
  Sutter.\"</p>\n            <p>There were still tests, though. On one of my first\
  \ days as an intern, Erik Mona walked over and threw a manuscript down on my desk.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"I hear you want to edit,\" he said. \"Let's see what you've got.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>I agreed happily, and asked who wrote the document.</p>\n \
  \           <p>\"I did,\" he said.</p>\n            <p>The mystery manuscript? Erik's\
  \ first draft of \"The Whispering Cairn,\" the leadoff adventure in the Age of Worms\
  \ Adventure Path. Sweating bullets, I put my head down and began to edit.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Fortunately for me, Erik found my comments worthwhile, or at least\
  \ respected a newbie bold enough to question his comma usage. I was judged competent,\
  \ and turned loose on the Shackled City hardcover, my first real project. Though\
  \ still working my newspaper and teaching jobs in the evenings, I was elated.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Nothing lasts forever, though. Six months into my internship, management\
  \ informed me that they were going to bring me on full-time—as the new customer\
  \ service person! (Back in the day, this was considered a one-person job.)</p>\n\
  \            <p>I thanked them, but pointed out that I was perfectly happy as the\
  \ editorial intern. They pointed out that they needed customer service, not interns.</p>\n\
  \            <p>So began a six-month stint as Paizo's only customer service specialist.\
  \ I learned a lot about psychology and human nature in those months, talking people\
  \ down from canceling their subscriptions, sending out replacement copies, and helping\
  \ Jeff Alvarez set up our very first warehouse in the building's basement. But my\
  \ dream of being an editor hadn't died—and in fact came to a head late that year\
  \ when a local paper began feeling me out for a position as the features editor.\
  \ Not wanting to leave Paizo, but fearing a missed opportunity, I told Lisa and\
  \ Erik—and as of the dawn of 2006, I was <em>Dungeon</em>'s new Assistant Editor.</p>\n\
  \            <p>(As it turns out, my replacement as the customer service department\
  \ was this weird guy from Idaho named—I kid you not—\"Cosmo.\" If you've had to\
  \ deal with him in the years since, I apologize. I trained him as best I could,\
  \ but some creatures just refuse to be housebroken.)</p>\n            <p>Not even\
  \ old enough to drink when I started here—Wes was actually present at my 21st birthday—\
  I've spent more than a quarter of my life working for Paizo. I spent years learning\
  \ what was cool at the feet of Wes, Jacobs, and Erik, while simultaneously fascinating\
  \ them with my post-collegiate bohemian lifestyle. (I swear, you eat out of a few\
  \ dumpsters, and you never hear the end of it.) I published my first adventure—\"\
  Shut-In\" from <a href=\"/products/btpy7xt5\"><em>Dungeon</em> #128</a>, co-written\
  \ with Wes Schneider—and used the money to buy my very own copies of the 3.5 rulebooks.\
  \ I earned the nickname \"The Render\" from freelancers for my uncompromising evaluation\
  \ of the slush pile. And I was at ground zero for several of the pivotal points\
  \ yet to come in Paizo's history, in which we were forced to adapt radically or\
  \ die.</p>\n            <p>But it wasn't all work. There was also the Independent\
  \ Republic of Jamesonia, established when Jacobs and I placed masking tape across\
  \ the entrance to our shared cube (the one whose window looked out on a primordial\
  \ swamp). There were the impromptu puppet shows whenever Jacobs got distracted by\
  \ his pile of stuffed Lovecraft monsters. There was Operation Banjo Thug, an impromptu\
  \ musical performance from Jacobs and me that caused Wes—the only witness—to question\
  \ his sanity. There was the time I turned orange for a few months, and the long\
  \ drive to a cabin in the woods with Wes and Jacobs that resulted in Jacobs calling\
  \ me \"Caligula\" for several years.</p>\n            <p>It's been a long time since\
  \ those early days. I'm not even \"Young Master Sutter\" at Paizo anymore—in the\
  \ editorial department, the new youngster is Patrick \"P-Ren\" Renie, who no doubt\
  \ seems just as alien to us with his youthful ways and speech patterns as I did\
  \ to the other staff once upon a time. From website image-monkey to Senior Editor,\
  \ I've seen Paizo from just about every angle, and I'm proud to say that we really\
  \ are a family. A weird one, to be sure, but aren't they all?</p>\n            <p>James\

  \      <h2>Cosmo's Place in the Cosmos</h2>\n            <p>\"We have to get you\
  \ out of Idaho,\" he said. It was late summer 2005 and my week's vacation in Seattle\
  \ was coming to a close. Josh Frost, with whom I've been friends since grade school,\
  \ was lamenting my impending return to our hometown where, we both agreed, I was\
  \ stuck.</p>\n            <p>\"Then find me a job.\" It was the same refrain I'd\
  \ given to all of my Seattle friends that week when the question of my living situation\
  \ came up.</p>\n            <p>2005 was not a very good year for me. I was living\
  \ in small-town Idaho, working a job I hated with few prospects for the future.\
  \ I made a decent enough paycheck to be comfortable, but I was desperate to get\
  \ out and short on options.</p>\n            <p>Two months passed before I received\
  \ word from Josh: \"We have an opening at Paizo for a customer service position.\
  \ Send me your resume. Now.\"</p>\n            <p>I knew that Josh worked for some\
  \ company in the gaming industry, but I had never heard of Paizo. What I did know,\
  \ though, was customer service, something I had been doing in one form or another\
  \ for nearly 10 years. I sent my resume, and immediately went out and bought a copy\
  \ of <em>Dragon</em> (<a href=\"/products/btpy7ya3\">issue #338</a>, by the way)\
  \ so I would not be completely clueless if they called me.</p>\n            <p>They\
  \ called, and I had one of the strangest interviews I've ever had. Phone interviews\
  \ are never easy, and I was shocked to discover that, in addition to being interviewed\
  \ by my potential manager, Jeff Alvarez, I was also being interviewed by the CEO\
  \ of the entire company. For a customer service position.</p>\n            <p>This\
  \ was my first clue that the job would not be like any other.</p>\n            <p>That\
  \ year, I had Christmas with my family in Idaho. The next day, I loaded as much\
  \ as I could into the 1995 Geo Storm that I had bought for $100, and drove to my\
  \ new life in Seattle. The day after that, I started my new job at Paizo.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Sometime in my first month, I was taking everyone's mail around\
  \ to their desks. I still did not really know any of these delightful weirdos that\
  \ I worked with, and I was always intimidated about going into \"The Pit.\" As I\
  \ quietly crept in, I saw that all the editors were huddled together discussing\
  \ something very intently, and there was a definite air of \"meeting\" in the room.\
  \ I tried not to make a sound, so as to not disturb them. Then I started overhearing\
  \ what the meeting was about:</p>\n            <p>\"No... if the barbarian goes\
  \ unconscious, then the rage ends and the temporary hit points are lost!\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"...but that means that any time a barbarian goes into the negs,\
  \ they just auto-die?!? That can't be right.\"</p>\n            <p>The discussion\
  \ wound on, and I quietly finished distributing the mail and went back to my desk,\
  \ silently giggling over the absurd luck that had brought me to this place. It was\
  \ precisely at this point that I realized that I loved my new job.</p>\n       \
  \     <p>The thing I was most unprepared for, I think, was the level of empowerment\
  \ I had. My last job was as a bank teller, where my responsibility was to toe the\
  \ company line and make the customer accept whatever rules and policies were dictated\
  \ to me. Rules were handed down from on high, and I was to follow without question.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Not so at Paizo. From the get-go, I was being asked \"What do you\
  \ think?\" And my ideas were considered, and implemented if they stood up to the\
  \ consideration. I could, and would, cry foul if I saw something that I felt was\
  \ confusing to customers, and I was listened to. At previous jobs, if I ever felt\
  \ that one of our customers had gotten a raw deal, I would approach management to\
  \ make it right and just get shot down. At Paizo, if I find something wrong, Jeff's\
  \ answer is \"Well... fix it! Make it right.\"</p>\n            <p>For my first\
  \ year or so, I was the only customer service person at Paizo, but I've never been\
  \ the only one at Paizo doing customer service. I was (and still am) always getting\
  \ ninja'd on the messageboards by Lisa or Vic, or any number of other folks. I had\
  \ thrown my lot in with this strange little company where an entire culture of customer\
  \ service made me, the low-man on the totem pole, feel like I was a key member of\
  \ a team.</p>\n            <p>It was awesome. It still is awesome.</p>\n       \
