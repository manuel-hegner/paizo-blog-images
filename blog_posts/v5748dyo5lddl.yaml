  \ the Year of the Risen Rune</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, April 30, 2012</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I took a break from the Gen Con push today to write this blog post, and\
  \ my mind started to wander. I thought a bit about days gone by and how last year\
  \ at this time we were under just as much pressure trying to get <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a> off to the presses in time. The more things change,\
  \ the more they stay the same. Anyway, I also thought to myself, \"Self, what sort\
  \ of blog were you writing this time last year?\" </p> \n   <p>\"Aha!\" myself answered.\
  \ \"I can do a search and find out!\"</p> \n   <p>Now, those of you who've been\
  \ following our Monday Pathfinder Society blog posts for a while likely remember\
  \ this time in spring 2011, when we had a very lengthy series of posts covering\
  \ \"The Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play.\" In fact, that series was\
  \ when we started doing weekly posts and claimed Monday as our own special day of\
  \ the week. So I checked back to <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2011/may/v5748dyo5lc4z\"\
  >Part VII</a> of that series from May 2. And lo and behold, that was when we announced\
  \ the title of the current season, the Year of the Ruby Phoenix.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Self, you should do the same thing for Season 4 in your blog post for Monday,\"\
  \ I said. And it seemed a reasonable suggestion, so I agreed.</p> \n   <p>Season\
  \ 4 of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign will be entitled <b>Year of\
  \ the Risen Rune</b>. The focus of the season is going to be the Pathfinder Society's\
  \ burgeoning lodge in the Varisian city of Magnimar—the focal point of the forthcoming\
  \ Shattered Star Adventure Path, which also debuts at Gen Con 2012. While that Adventure\
  \ Path won't be sanctioned for Pathfinder Society credit and won't use the faction\
  \ system we have in the organized play campaign, there will be a lot of overlap\
  \ between the Adventure Path and the Pathfinder Society campaign. So whatever campaign\
  \ you play, you'll have lots of options for exploring the untamed frontier region\
  \ of Varisia and the ancient Thassilonian ruins located there. </p> \n   <p>We'll\
  \ have a lot more information about both the Shattered Star Adventure Path and the\
  \ Year of the Risen Rune in the coming months, but until we get closer to the launch\
  \ of these exciting adventures, check out the venture-captain who Pathfinder players\
  \ of all ilks are likely to get to know very well—Sheila Heidmarch—and the Pathfinder\
  \ Society season's shiny new logo.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
