  \ character, Nok-Nok:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"padding: 15px;\"\

  ><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</em></a> in July. After that, he'll be available\
  \ for sale on paizo.com and at our Gen Con booth in August.</p> \n     <p>Now, I'll\
  \ cede the floor to Tyler <a href=\"/people/cartmanbeck\">\"Cartmanbeck\" Beck</a>,\
  \ our new Venture-Captain for Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild Online Play!</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Tyler</b>: <span itemprop=\"description\">It's\
  \ hard to believe that the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game was released almost five\
  \ years ago now. The game has evolved through four full base sets and dozens of\
  \ character and add-on decks, and has been the focus of a successful organized play\
  \ campaign.</span></p> \n      <p>Speaking of that organized play campaign, in the\
  \ recent 5.0 release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild Guide</em></a>, the option was added for online\
  \ play. I know a few people have been asking things like \"What?\" and \"How?\"\
  \ and \"Really?\" Thus far, the answer to all of those questions has been \"Let's\
  \ take it slow.\" So to that end, the Card Guild has become a (relatively small)\
  \ part of the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ut7s?Announcing-OutPost-I-Back-to-the-Future\"\
  >OutPost play-by-post gaming convention</a>, currently being held right here on\
  \ the Paizo forums. We've currently got 11 tables running currently, with several\
  \ box runners (BRs) each running one or more tables of PACG newbies and veterans\
  \ alike. I'd like to introduce you to two BRs who will tell you a bit about how\
  \ things work.</p> \n      <p><b>Ray (<a href=\"/people/redeux\">redeux</a> on the\
  \ forums)</b>: Most of my experiences so far have been as a player at one of the\
  \ play-by-post tables. It's been a blast! Five of us has been working through <a\
  \ href=\"/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2\">Season of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ and over the course of several months we've progressed all the way to tier 5.\
  \ I'm fortunate enough to also have a local group that gets together for organized\
  \ play, but what I like about the online play-by-post is that it can be done from\
  \ anywhere, and it takes much less time out of my day spread throughout a week rather\
  \ than all in one afternoon. In that regard, it has been super convenient to get\
  \ a little dose of PACG on a regular basis without straining my schedule. The format\
  \ also makes it easy to back to look back and check what happened, like that time\
  \ <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=25#1219\">Kyra\
  \ unleashed a fire attack with her sword, making sure her fire-loving goblin teammate\
  \ Reta was nowhere in sight so she wouldn't get any heated ideas</a>.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>With the OutPost event, we have been working hard to expose more people to\
  \ the play-by-post format for PACG. I'm currently running two tables for the event,\
  \ and I have players from the US, UK, Asia, and Australia, which shows that the\
  \ game can be played globally. Some of my players are fairly experienced with the\
  \ ACG, other players have a lot of experience with the RPG but little ACG, and a\
  \ few started with little to no experience with either. We all work together to\
  \ help everyone learn and overcome the scenarios!</p> \n      <p>Let's tackle how\
  \ it all works. As Tyler mentioned, one person runs the box. This is currently is\
  \ being handled through a database that contains the card information for each scenario.\
  \ The database is able to build locations, shuffle them, move cards around, and\
  \ manage just about anything you need to do during a normal ACG scenario. The scenario\
  \ is then posted on the campaign page, looking <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=5#219\"\
  >something like this</a>:</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-Screenshot1.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-Screenshot1_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>The scenario post has all of the \"During this Adventure\"\
  \ and \"During this Scenario\" text in it, as well as turn info, blessing deck info,\
  \ and location/location deck info. All of the cards in the location decks are hidden\
  \ through spoilers. This allows players to explore multiple times in their turn\
  \ without waiting for a new card to be presented to them.</p> \n      <p>Players\
  \ use a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12e_Cu06pPyIGrsIurW4K3JAYLzxGl4As0DgD92eHpPA/edit?usp=sharing\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Deck Handler spreadsheet on Google Docs that handles drawing\
  \ cards from your deck, discarding, recharging, burying, shuffling, etc. (Tyler\
  \ provides some instruction on how to use it </a><a href=\"/threads/rzs2utd5?Ever-wanted-to-play-PACG-over-playbypost#30\"\
  >here</a>. The Deck Handler includes only card names, so you still need to have\
  \ a physical deck to reference the card text. It provides an easy way to let everyone\
  \ know what cards you have in hand, and what blessings or other cards you are willing\
  \ to let people use on their turns. When you finish your turn, it gives you templated\
  \ text to paste into the forum to communicate your decisions.</p> \n      <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n       <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180405-Screenshot2.jpg\"\
  >\n      </div> \n      <p><b>Mark (<a href=\"/people/MorkXII\">MorkXII</a> on the\
  \ forums)</b>: During last year's online runthrough of the Cosmic Captive PFS Special,\
  \ I was able to join <a href=\"/campaigns/PathfinderACG800CosmicCaptiveTable1TIER13\"\
  >one</a> of <a href=\"/campaigns/PathfinderACG800CosmicCaptiveTable2TIER13\">two</a>\
  \ ACG tables run during the event and had an amazing time, and I couldn't wait to\
  \ do it again. When I missed the chance to play in a <a href=\"/campaigns/ADVENTURECARDGUILDSeason2B1WeBeGoblins/gameplay&amp;page=1\"\
  >Season of the Goblins game&gt; that Tyler started in November, I asked him if I\
  \ could run my own table. He agreed, so I recruited four players (and a fifth joined\
  \ later) to play through </a><a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=1\"\
  >Season of the Runelords</a>. That campaign is still going: the group has finished\
  \ 23 scenarios in roughly 100 days, and we're on track to finish the entire Adventure\
  \ Path by the end of OutPost on April 30.</p> \n      <p>Playing the ACG by forum\
  \ post is obviously not the same as playing in-person: the pace is much slower,\
  \ and sometimes it's tricky to collaborate on group efforts, such as who's handling\
  \ temporary closes and multi-check encounters, and who's supplying all the blessings.\
  \ Some rules and scenarios are a little tougher to implement for forum play and\
  \ take an extra bit of effort or creative thinking (I'm looking at you, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9m9j?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-23-Into-the-Mountain\"\
  >Adventure #2-3C</a>!). But overall the game still works well in this format, and\
  \ the slower pace also means you spend more time getting to know the group than\
  \ you would around a table. Early in our Season of the Runelords game, we moved\
  \ most of our game discussion to a Google Hangouts chat to allow for more real-time\
  \ discussion. This made it easier to plan out those group efforts, but also enabled\
  \ more off-topic and personal discussion, and it's been wonderful getting to know\
  \ some other Pathfinder fans from around the world.</p> \n      <p>The slower pace\
  \ of play also means that everyone has more time to take their turns, and many players\
  \ put in effort to go beyond just listing what cards they encounter and play. The\
  \ roleplaying and storytelling are my favourite part of playing a game online because\
  \ it's so entertaining to read! When Reta <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGOutPostIMorkXIIsSeasonOfTheGoblins/gameplay#28\"\
  >fell into a giant pit</a> and dragged all her goblin friends along with her, it\
  \ made for a series of very fun posts. And a different Reta seemed very pleased\
  \ with herself when she <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=30#1463\"\
  >clubbed the villain over the head with a Lamia henchman</a>. (At least she didn't\
  \ offer anyone any of her... <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=16#761\"\
  >questionable</a> <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=30#1499\"\
  >pickles</a> that time).</p> \n      <p>And playing online, you still get the same\
  \ exciting moments that you always get from Pathfinder. Who doesn't love <a hrf=\"\
  /campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=5#225\">clearing out an entire\
  \ location deck in a single turn</a>? Or <a href=\"/campaigns/ACGSeasonOfTheRunelords/gameplay&amp;page=10#465\"\
  >blasting away the villain on a last-ditch effort</a> with just one blessing left\
  \ in the deck?</p> \n      <p><b>Tyler</b>: We have a vibrant community of players\
  \ on the Paizo play-by-post forums, and I'm excited that we've been able to add\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game play to that community. As OutPost winds down at\
  \ month end, watch for new developments on the forums and more ways to play PACG\
  \ in play-by-post form yourselves!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Vic Wertz<br>\
