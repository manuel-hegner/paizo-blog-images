  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the key elements of\
  \ tabletop roleplaying games like Pathfinder is the collaborative storytelling that\
  \ comes from a party of different characters all adventuring together. In many cases,\
  \ the inter-party conflicts and dynamics of a campaign are as memorable as the overall\
  \ plot like the villain and her motivations. In a single-player digital adaptation\
  \ of such a game, capturing that same sense of disparate personalities is vital\
  \ to making the final game feel like Pathfinder. Pathfinder: Kingmaker, from developers\
  \ Owlcat Games emulates this cherished aspect of the genre perfectly with their\
  \ wide array of supporting characters players can combine into the perfect team.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While players have the ability to create their own cast of companions\
  \ after completing the game's tutorial and prologue, the eleven pre-made companions\
  \ provide a wide variety of character types, both adhering to and bucking genre\
  \ tropes to play with. Each has a backstory linking them to the game's overarching\
  \ plot, an intricate series of side quests focusing on their character development,\
  \ and interpersonal dynamics both with the player and their fellow companions sure\
  \ to add hours of additional entertainment as they banter while making camp or interject\
  \ their thoughts during key encounters.</p> \n     <p>Which companion is your favorite?\
  \ Who are you most excited to get to know (and possibly romance)? Which ones do\
  \ you see as comprising your default adventuring party?</p> \n     <p><b>Amiri</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The kellid barbarian Amiri hails from the harsh Realm of the Mammoth\
  \ Lords, where she was exiled from her nomadic tribe for daring to challenge traditional\
  \ gender roles. Unwelcome in her homeland and resentful of anyone who doubts her\
  \ battle prowess, Amiri is more eager to prove her worth to her new \"chieftain\"\
  —you!</p> \n     <p><b>Ekundayo</b></p> \n     <p>Born in Absalom, the teeming City\
  \ at the Center of the World, to a Garundi family, the reserved ranger Ekundayo\
  \ sought only a peaceful family life in the River Kingdoms when raiding trolls forced\
  \ him on a different path. A devoted follower of Torag, Ekun now seeks revenge for\
  \ his slain loved ones and a new start, be that with decent companions he meets\
  \ along the way or on his own.</p> \n     <p><b>Harrim</b></p> \n     <p>The dwarf\
  \ cleric Harrim is the embodiment of the nihilistic faith of Groetus, god of the\
  \ end times, which he doesn't so much as proselytize as ooze from every pore in\
  \ his dour body. Ever ready to remind his companions of the futility of, well, just\
  \ about everything, he may just as well adventure with them than do anything else.\
  \ Everyone's going to end up dead at the end of time, anyway, so why not die in\
  \ the service to the Stolen Lands' new ruler?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Ekundayo, and Harrim </i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Jaethal</b></p> \n   \
  \  <p>Elves are known throughout Golarion for their otherworldly grace and alien\
  \ demeanor, but the inquisitor Jaethal takes this aloofness even further—by being\
  \ a unique undead in service to Urgathoa, goddess of gluttony and undeath. On the\
  \ run from her past in Kyonin—the type of murder and betrayal you'd expect from\
  \ someone angling for the favor of such a fell god—Jaethal serves at her own whim,\
  \ perhaps wanting nothing more of her companions than potential corpses for a future\
  \ undead army of her very own.</p> \n     <p><b>Jubilost</b></p> \n     <p>Few authors\
  \ in the world have as lengthy and prestigious bibliography as the esteemed gnome\
  \ alchemist, Jubilost Narthropple. Hailing from the centers of learning in metropolitan\
  \ Absalom, Jubilost doesn't suffer fools lightly, and he believes everyone to be\
  \ a fool. Though his arrogance makes him few friends, his interest in the mysteries\
  \ of the gnomes' origins in the First World and his expert knowledge on just about\
  \ everything (at least in his own mind) make him a valuable resource in uncovering\
  \ some of the region's most enigmatic mysteries.</p> \n     <p><b>Linzi</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Your first and most loyal companion, Linzi was kicked out of the Academy\
  \ of Grand Arts in the neighboring River Kingdom of Pitax after she wrote less-than-flattering\
  \ things about the city's King Irovetti. The optimistic halfling bard has selected\
  \ you to be the subject of her magnum opus, a book telling a tale of high adventure\
  \ written by those involved, at the time of their exploits instead of decades later\
  \ based on second-hand reports.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Jaethal, Jubilost, and Linzi </i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Nok-Nok</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Most civilized creatures see goblins as little more than monsters, and\
  \ sometimes, even goblins see their kin in much the same light. Nok-Nok, a rogue\
  \ with ambitions of being \"the fith gawd\" (an addition to the four-member pantheon\
  \ of goblin hero gods), is one such case. Bullied and tortured by his tribe, he's\
  \ more than happy to work with longshanks who don't abuse him, and will gladly prove\
  \ his loyalty and worthiness to you, as long as you give him plenty of things to\
  \ stab along the way.</p> \n     <p><b>Octavia</b></p> \n     <p>A former slave\
  \ of the Technic League mages of neighboring Numeria, the half-elf arcane trickster\
  \ Octavia is a ray of sunshine despite the gloomy conditions of her life prior to\
  \ meeting the game's hero. Octavia has an optimism that rivals Linzi's and a sense\
  \ of compassion that's hard to ignore should you act the tyrant in her company.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Regongar</b></p> \n     <p>Octavia's closest and oldest friend, the\
  \ half-orc magus Regongar, is decidedly less optimistic and compassionate than his\
  \ partner. Cruel, hedonistic, and vengeful, Regongar would rather kill his enemies\
  \ quickly and without fuss (especially his former captors among the Technic League)\
  \ than delay the drinking and love-making to follow, a stark contrast to Octavia's\
  \ more forgiving approach.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ \n      <p><i>Nok-Nok, Octavia, and Regongar </i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Tristian</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Soft-spoken and aloof, the human cleric Tristian hails from the Padishah\
  \ Empire of Kelesh far to the east, where he was raised in the church of the sun\
  \ goddess Sarenrae. With a grace becoming his celestial patron, the wandering priest\
  \ spreads the word of the Dawnflower—as well as her tenets of healing, light, and\
  \ redemption—into the heart of the Stolen Lands, and if he had his way, into the\
  \ hearts of his companions as well.</p> \n     <p><b>Valerie</b></p> \n     <p>Bestowed\
  \ by divine beauty and charm, the noble-born human, Valerie, was raised in a convent\
  \ dedicated to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, set on the track of a paladin of\
  \ the Eternal Rose. She wasn't interested in any of that, however. Tired of countless\
  \ suitors inundating her with mediocre art the tenets of her faith prohibited her\
  \ from ripping up and throwing in their faces, Valerie instead took up the life\
  \ of a trained fighter, mastering the defensive and offensive applications of the\
  \ tower shield. Now in the baron or baroness's employ, Valerie is staunchly loyal\
  \ and invaluable on the battlefield.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Tristian and Valerie </i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of the\
  \ 11 companions in the game, four are romanceable—Valerie for male PCs, Tristian\
  \ for female PCs, and both Octavia and Regongar for both male and female PCs. Whether\
  \ you pursue a romantic relationship with any of them is your choice, but regardless\
  \ of your decision, each of your companions provides endless possibilities for bringing\
  \ the collaborative, party-based excitement of the Pathfinder RPG to life!</p> \n\
