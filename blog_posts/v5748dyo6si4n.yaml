  \ itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to a joint update for August and September! After\
  \ Gen Con I simply did not have the energy to write an update for August, and now\
  \ it’s almost September, so we’ve combined them into one mega-update.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Speaking of which, I had an absolute blast at my first-ever Gen Con! It was\
  \ fantastic getting to see so many community members coming out and enjoying our\
  \ return to the Sagamore ballroom. Watching more than 50 tables run through <em>Enter\
  \ the Pallid Peak</em> during the special was a real treat, and I returned from\
  \ the weekend emotionally recharged (and physically exhausted). I’m already putting\
  \ some plans into motion to improve the program and make it the best version of\
  \ itself thanks to some conversations I had that weekend.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <p><b>Newly Sanctioned</b>: Last month we sanctioned <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive\"\
  ><em>Dark Archive</em></a> for Pathfinder Society and <a href=\"\"><em>Redshift\
  \ Rally</em></a> for Starfinder Society! For <em>Dark Archive</em>, the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\">Character Options</a> are\
  \ available for use, and the 8 Case File adventures have <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Dark+Archive+Case+Files+Sanctioning.pdf\"\
  >sanctioning documents</a> on the product page. They all grant 2 XP and commensurate\
  \ rewards. <em>Redshift Rally</em> is sanctioned for play, and its <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options</a> are available for use as well.</p> \n      <p><b>Upcoming</b>:\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c20\"><em>Lost Omens: Travel Guide</em></a>\
  \ sanctioning is finished and ready for a street date next week, so look for those\
  \ Character Options next Wednesday! <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ase/discuss?Pathfinder-Adventure-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King\"\
  ><em>Crown of the Kobold King</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0y/discuss?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Dead-Suns\"\
  ><em>Dead Suns</em></a> hardcover have both had their release dates shifted to October,\
  \ but we should be on track to have them both ready on release. The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers\"\
  >Drift Crashers Adventure Path</a> should also be sanctioned around the release\
  \ of the third volume in October.</p> \n      <p>We do intend to sanction the Kingmaker\
  \ Adventure Path and associated content for Pathfinder Society! However, it’s a\
  \ lot of content that we have not yet started reviewing, so we can’t guarantee that\
  \ sanctioning will be ready for its release at the end of October. We’ll be sure\
  \ to keep you posted as we make progress.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Guide Updates</h2>\
  \ \n      <h3>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</h3> \n      <p>That’s right, there’\
  s a PACS update! Been a while since we had one of those. We’ve long said that we\
  \ intended to release one final version of the PACS Guide to cover any lingering\
  \ issues and close out the program. Well, that day is today! The Guide has been\
  \ updated to its final form at this time.</p> \n      <p>Major updates include the\
  \ addition of Adventurer’s Packs, the sanctioning of content published on Infinite\
  \ for play, and various other changes. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy98no?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-Guide\"\
  >The Guide is available for download now</a>!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> \n      <p>While at Gen Con, I was able\
  \ to award a number of additional Campaign Coins. We award these coins to members\
  \ of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program\
  \ to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if\
  \ you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not\
  \ they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with\
  \ their name and reasons. </p> \n      <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Chris Johnson</b>,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#858</b><br> <b>Doug Edwards</b>,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#859</b><br> <b>Kristin\
  \ Bollerman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#860</b><br>\
  \ <b>Jim Crase</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#861</b><br>\
  \ <b>Rebecca Fehn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#862</b><br>\
  \ and <b>Tim Munsie (TMun)</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play\
  \ ID <b>#863</b></p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Order of the Wayfinder</h2> \n   \
  \   <p>In addition to the Campaign Service Coin, we also have one other award: the\
  \ Order of the Wayfinder. This award is given out only once per year, and recognizes\
  \ a member of the community who has provided exceptional service. Typically, we\
  \ give this award to individuals who have taken on a particular project and knocked\
  \ it out of the park. Previously, this award has been awarded to the head of our\
  \ Additional Resources review team and our Regional Venture-Coordinator for the\
  \ Online region, among others.</p> \n      <p>I am pleased to finally announce that\
  \ the 2021 recipient of the Order of the Wayfinder is <b>Barb Wilkins</b>. Since\
  \ 2018, Barb has been the one-woman show behind sending out volunteer agreements\
  \ to our Venture Officers. Every year, this involves sending out literally hundreds\
  \ of agreements to volunteers, ensuring that they’ve been signed and returned, and\
  \ maintaining the master list of every Venture Officer worldwide. It’s a monumental\
  \ task, and one that she has done for nearly four years now. Her work is undeniably\
  \ vital to Organized Play, and I am delighted to have presented this award to her\
  \ at Gen Con this year.</p> \n      <h3>GM Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars,\
  \ novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial\
  \ amount of time. To achieve the fifth milestone, a GM must run 150 games, which\
  \ must include at least 50 unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as\
  \ run between one and three games for Venture-Captains (program dependent). A conservative\
  \ estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n  \
  \    <p>This month, we had four GMs earn their 5th Star for PFS1 and two GMs earn\
  \ their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> \n      <p><b>5th Star</b>: Zackery Kuehn, Ben Tash,\
  \ Christopher Waterfield, and Denis Wishnevsky<br> <b>5th Glyph</b>: Milan Badzic\
  \ and Robert Bollerman</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Conventions</h2> \n      <p>I'm\
  \ pleased to announce that I'll be attending two regional shows this October! First\
  \ up, I'll be at <b>CinCityCon</b> in Cincinnati, Ohio from October 7–9 (that’s\
  \ over Indigenous Peoples’ Day so it’s a long weekend). Tickets are on sale now\
  \ at <a href=\"https://cincitycon.com/\">https://cincitycon.com/</a>; the tables\
  \ I'm running will be charity tickets.</p> \n      <p>I'll also be attending <b>Scarefest</b>\
  \ in Asheville, North Carolina from October 21–23, which is just a perfect convention\
  \ for a big scaredy-cat like me! Tickets are available on their website at <a href=\"\
  https://avlscarefest.com/\">https://avlscarefest.com/</a> and game signups are on\
  \ their Warhorn at <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/asheville-scarefest\">https://warhorn.net/events/asheville-scarefest</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I'm looking forward to getting out to see you all this fall! I've got\
  \ some fun tables planned and I can't wait.</p> \n      <p>If you’re not in the\
  \ neighborhood of these shows, or you’re looking for more fun closer to home or\
  \ online, check out our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">conventions calendar</a>!\
  \ We’ve got tons of shows coming up in the home stretch of 2023 for you to check\
  \ out and support.</p> \n      <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And\
  \ enjoy the new Year of Boundless Wonder!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
