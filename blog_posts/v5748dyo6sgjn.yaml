  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As we started working on Season 10 of Pathfinder\
  \ Society, we knew that there were a lot of long running storylines that we wanted\
  \ to resolve—and as importantly give players the opportunity to see through to the\
  \ end. This month we're debuting the finale for the Gloomspires as well as a deep\
  \ look into the famous Decemvirate helms!</p> \n     <h2>Decemvirate Helms</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>In <a href=\"/products/btq01x4p?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1016-What-the-Helms-Hide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-16: What The Helms Hide</em></a>, a series\
  \ of four quests for Tier 1–5 written by Calder CaDavid, Lysle Kapp, Kendra Leigh\
  \ Speedling, and Nate Wright (we're excited to welcome Calder and Lysle as our latest\
  \ open call authors). In this adventure, the PCs are given the opportunity to take\
  \ a peek into the past of the most mysterious members of the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ For over three centuries, the Decemvirate guided the Society from behind the anonymity\
  \ of their magic helms, though their rule has not always been praised by the agents\
  \ and other members of the Society. Over the course of the past decade, the Society\
  \ has faced rebellion, treason, and other threats from within, as well as external\
  \ menaces. Thanks to the tenacity and strength of its agents, the Pathfinder Society\
  \ withstood the turmoil, but questions about the Decemvirate and the secrets possessed\
  \ by those whose identities are hidden behind the magic helms still remain.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Society's Master of Scrolls, Kreighton Shaine recently discovered\
  \ clues left by a long-ago member of the Society exiled for a foiled assassination\
  \ attempt against one of the members of the Decemvirate. These clues seem to indicate\
  \ that the purported assassination may not have transpired quite as the history\
  \ books claim. Supported by members of the Decemvirate who believe this to be exactly\
  \ the kind of secret that could weaken the Society at a critical juncture, Kreighton\
  \ sends the PCs to key locations across the Inner Sea to track down these clues\
  \ and reveal the secrets hidden at the heart of the Grand Lodge.</p> \n     <div\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Ernanda Souza</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Whether\
  \ you're a dedicated believer in the Decemvirate and their actions, or a fiery rebel\
  \ carving “Shadow Lodge for life!” into the doors of every Grand Lodge privy, you\
  \ won't want to miss your chance to find out what kind of secrets and dark histories\
  \ are hidden in the veiled past of the Pathfinder Society's most enigmatic figures!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Nightmare Seas</h2> \n     <p>The legendary tomb of pirate captain\
  \ Sempet Sevenfingers captivated sailors throughout the Shackles for generations,\
  \ perhaps none more so than Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry. Over the last few years,\
  \ Benarry sent numerous Pathfinder teams to explore and plunder the depths of the\
  \ Gloomspires: haunted stone spires rising from the stormy sea infused with strange\
  \ dimensional magics and filled with all manner of perils. Yet none of these ventures\
  \ uncovered Sevenfingers himself or his greatest treasures. That's about to change,\
  \ as you might have guessed from Josef Kucera's illustration of the nefarious captain\
  \ himself. The old pirate hasn't been sitting quietly in his tomb. He has big plans,\
  \ and if the PCs don't stop him quickly, his triumphant return could spell disaster\
  \ for the Shackles! Come play the grand finale of the Gloomspires story arc, <a\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-17: On Sevenfinger's Sails</em></a>. And if\
  \ you particularly want to challenge your PCs, consider playing the scenario's optional\
  \ Hard Mode.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS1017E-Sevenfingers.jpg\"\

  \ Tom Phillips invented the Gloomspires as a part of his 2012 RPG Superstar submission,\
  \ and this fascinating dungeon's rich story was something the Organized Play team\
  \ wanted to explore further. He's been working with us ever since to gradually reveal\
  \ its buried secrets. Check out the rest of the Gloomspire's story in these scenarios:\
