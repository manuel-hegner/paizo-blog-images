  \   <p class=\"date\">Monday, October 5, 2009</p> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1114-Cover.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1114-Cover_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n    <p>I may have mentioned this before, but\
  \ the main villain of <i>Pathfinder</i>’s first Adventure Path, Karzoug, was no\
  \ stranger to tormenting PCs. He was one of my homebrew campaign’s major recurring\
  \ characters—a powerful wizard who served as the true menace behind the throne of\
  \ an evil warlord. In my homebrew, Karzoug wielded a scythe and had already made\
  \ the transition to lich and wasn’t as concerned with greed, but he was very much\
  \ still the campaign’s poster child for “evil wizard.” He eventually met his end\
  \ when a pair of heroes, the barbarian Verik and the wizard Zefram, confronted Karzoug\
  \ in, of all places, Baba Yaga’s dancing hut. Karzoug was trying to claim the hut’\
  s legendary power source for his own evil purposes, and while this certainly annoyed\
  \ Baba Yaga, she wasn’t about to give the PCs uncontested access to her magical\
  \ fortress. And so these two high-level PCs snuck through the depths of the dancing\
  \ hut filled with fear about breaking or even touching anything, avoiding every\
  \ single encounter and trap through an uncharacteristic caution that, in the end,\
  \ served them quite well. I’d intended them to finally reach Karzoug and have the\
  \ final battle with the evil wizard after the PCs had depleted much of their resources\
  \ dealing with the natives of Baba Yaga’s hut, and when they reached Karzoug with\
  \ much of those resources untapped, I figured they deserved the advantage. Turns\
  \ out, they needed that advantage anyway. Even in the 1st edition of the game, Karzoug\
  \ was a menace.</p> \n    <p>And so, when it came to deciding on a villain to inflict\
  \ upon Golarion, it was with quite a bit of pride and nostalgia that I resurrected\
  \ old Karzoug. He’d changed specializations (necromancer to transmuter) and weapons\
  \ (scythe to glaive) and got a promotion (from the power behind the throne to the\
  \ guy who sits on the throne), but in a lot of other ways he remained the same.\
  \ Of course, getting Wayne Reynolds to illustrate him was one of the more surreal\
  \ moments of my gaming career... and now, seeing him on the cover of our upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88rc\" target=\"nofollow\"><i>GameMastery\
  \ Guide</i></a>, that sense of surreal pride has returned. Wayne Reynolds has done\
  \ a fantastic job making Karzoug epitomize the role of \"super-powerful wizard.\"\
  \ Take a moment to look through all of his stuff! Caged imp, pet blue dragon, throne\
  \ manacles for prisoners, spellbooks casually stacked to the side, crazy crystal\
  \ ball with some sort of apparatus wrapped around it, a throne that can probably\
  \ see—and that doesn’t even touch all of his fancy magical equipment he’s got ready\
  \ to ruin the next PC to step his way!</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p>James\
