  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When we first started brainstorming\
  \ the three new ancestries we intended to put into the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>,\
  \ leshies weren’t even on the list. We knew we didn’t want to overlap with the ancestries\
  \ that are going to show up in the recently announced <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i>,\
  \ but that still left us with far too many contenders for the mere three ancestry\
  \ slots we had available. Options included simple and popular choices such as the\
  \ grippli, ambitious but potentially rules-contentious ideas such as centaurs, and\
  \ even the relatively obscure mortics that appeared in Tyrant’s Grasp. As we debated,\
  \ Mark Seifter came in with a message from himself and the rest of the Design Team:\
  \ “What about leshies?”</p> \n     <p>Well, what <i>about</i> leshies?</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Much like their introduction into Pathfinder 1E, leshies gained incredible\
  \ traction in a short amount of time, and they managed to cinch the last, coveted\
  \ spot as an early ancestry for Pathfinder 2E. We know leshies aren’t for everyone,\
  \ but we recognized their presence was an opportunity to emphasize some of the truly\
  \ unique aspects of the Age of Lost Omens as a setting. While many ancestries have\
  \ unique and challenging viewpoints by the standards of humanity, leshies are separated\
  \ from both flesh and mortality as we understand it.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Ksenia Kozhevnikova</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Leshies are a combination of the\
  \ physical and the supernatural. The true heart of a leshy is a nature spirit, but\
  \ these spirits don’t have bodies and can't easily affect the material world on\
  \ their own. It’s only when a master of primal magic creates a suitable vessel for\
  \ a spirit, and a spirit accepts that vessel as a body, that a leshy is born. Once\
  \ a leshy is created, they could theoretically live forever—though the dangers of\
  \ Golarion mean this rarely occurs—and leshy souls don’t go to the Boneyard upon\
  \ death like those of mortals. Instead, destroying a leshy simply frees their primal\
  \ spirit back into nature; that spirit could even be summoned into another leshy\
  \ body at some point in the future. Reincarnated leshies tend to put most of their\
  \ memories of their past lives aside, but that doesn’t mean they forget everything,\
  \ and a newborn leshy might choose to pursue a particularly treasured friend or\
  \ important cause from a previous existence. </p> \n     <p>Like hobgoblins, leshies\
  \ are an Uncommon ancestry. In the case of leshies, this is because many leshies\
  \ don’t travel beyond their homes, instead staying to protect and tend to the natural\
  \ places they sprung from and treasure. I often envision leshies to be something\
  \ akin to the kodama from the film <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, or other strange creatures\
  \ from Miyazaki movies—regular townsfolk aren’t going to stab such a mystical forest\
  \ spirit on sight, but it would still be very strange to see one come into a shop\
  \ and ask to buy some rope! Big changes have come to Golarion of late, however,\
  \ and that means more and more leshies are starting to venture out from their forests\
  \ and caverns, shyly investigating the cities and towns of other peoples as they\
  \ set forth to hold back a spreading darkness. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <p>Leshies get 8 Hit Points from their ancestry, are Small, and have a speed of\
  \ 25 feet. A leshy speaks Common and Sylvan, plus any additional languages they\
  \ might pick up. Leshies lack vulnerable organs and veins, giving them an ability\
  \ boost to Constitution, and have the tranquility and experience of an immortal\
  \ nature spirit, getting another ability boost in Wisdom. They also get one free\
  \ ability boost to put in any score. Leshies don’t cling to old memories and can\
  \ be a little empty-headed—in the case of gourd leshies, literally! —so they get\
  \ an ability flaw to Intelligence. In addition, leshies don’t eat like most PCs\
  \ do, instead gaining sustenance from the sun or from rotting matter (though leshies\
  \ have discovered a way to create bottled nutrients for themselves if they find\
  \ themselves needing such a precaution).</p> \n     <p>Leshies can also do fun and\
  \ unusual things with their crafted plant bodies, such as the ability granted by\
  \ the following ancestry feat:</p> \n     <div style=\"border:2px solid #5d0104;\
  \ margin: 1em 0\"> \n      <table style=\"font-weight: bold;\" cellspacing=\"0\"\
  > \n       <tbody>\n        <tr>\n         <td style=\"background-color: #5d0104;\
  \ color: #fff; padding:0.25rem\">SEEDPOD</td>\n         <td style=\"background-color:\
  \ #5d0104; color: #fff; padding:0.25rem\">FEAT 1</td>\n        </tr> \n        <tr>\n\
  \         <td style=\"background-color: #5d0104; color: #fff; padding:0.25rem\"\
  \ colspan=\"2\">LESHY</td> \n        </tr>\n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n \
  \     <p style=\"padding:0.5rem; margin:0\">Your body produces a nearly endless\
  \ supply of hard seedpods. You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4\
  \ bludgeoning damage; these Strikes have the manipulate trait. On a critical hit,\
  \ a seedpod bursts, issuing forth a tangle of vegetation that imposes a –10‐foot\
  \ circumstance penalty on the target’s Speed for 1 round. Seedpods do not add critical\
  \ specialization effects.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>The leshy ancestry entry also\
  \ suggests some common Core Rulebook backgrounds appropriate for leshies. Nomad\
  \ or scout might be unsurprising rules and roleplaying recommendations, but be sure\
  \ to also check out specific backgrounds from the Lost Omens World Guide for other\
  \ appropriate options such as the Wildwood Local background!</p> \n     <p>Eleanor\
