  >We're only a few short weeks away from Gen Con, the release of Pathfinder's Second\
  \ Edition opening books, and the launch of the new Pathfinder Society campaign!\
  \ Phew! In the coming weeks we'll be previewing scenarios, pregenerated characters,\
  \ the Guide, but today we're going to talk about one of the final character creation\
  \ elements. Character creation works in basically the same way as is described in\
  \ the soon-to-be-released Pathfinder Core Rulebook: choose your ancestry, select\
  \ a background, pick your class, and you're well on your way. These are the A(ncestry),\
  \ B(ackground), C(lass)s of character design, and my colleagues Mark Seifter and\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer will be on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/knowdirection\"\
  \ target=\"_new\">Know Direction</a> at 9 pm EST/6 pm PST tonight to go through\
  \ the character creation process.</p>\n              <p>But there are two special\
  \ considerations in building your Pathfinder Society character. One of them is factions,\
  \ which we've described in numerous earlier blogs (check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/organizedPlay\"\
  >the three faction previews from May and June</a>). Just as in Starfinder Society,\
  \ adventuring earns your PC Reputation (which unlocks potential rewards) and Fame\
  \ (which lets you purchase those rewards). Collectively, these grant your PC an\
  \ extra edge.</p>\n              <p>And today we're going to address the other feature:\
  \ training.</p>\n              <p>Published well before I started work at Paizo,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8az2?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Seekers-of-Secrets-A-Guide-to-the-Pathfinder-Society\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Seekers of Secrets</a> has always served as one of\
  \ the foundational lore resources for the team, from understanding the in-world\
  \ Society's role to getting a sense of where there are Pathfinder lodges. It also\
  \ introduces the three deans of the Pathfinder Society—Kreighton Shaine, the Master\
  \ of Scrolls; Aram Zey, the Master of Spells (since replaced by Sorrina Westyr);\
  \ and Marcos Farabellus, the Master of Swords—each of who play a role in training\
  \ initiates for the rigors of the adventuring world. <em>Seekers of Secrets</em>\
  \ helpfully explains how the Scrolls lessons feature translation and insight, the\
  \ Spells focus on understanding and surviving magical threats, and the Swords involves\
  \ a mix of athleticism, combat fundamentals, and spelunking basics. However, we've\
  \ just never been terribly clear about what's involved in the deans' oversight,\
  \ what role the three “schools” play in an established field agent's exploits, or\
  \ whether any of that reflects on the gameplay experience. In designing the Second\
  \ Edition organized play experience, we wanted to change that.</p>\n           \
  \   <p>When you build a player character in the Second Edition Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign, you'll have three points to distribute between the three schools, representing\
  \ how much your PC focused on those school's curricula while training as an initiate.\
  \ Each point you invest in a school gives a small benefit that's relevant throughout\
  \ your character's entire career, representing not only the lessons you learned\
  \ but also the life-long professional contacts you made during that time.</p>\n\
  \              <p>If you'd like to assign one point to each school, you'll receive\
  \ fairly balanced benefits. This choice opens access to a bunch of options and represents\
  \ having a Pathfinder with a well-rounded education. If you relish the idea of a\
  \ more focused character, even mixing unlikely class-school combinations like a\
  \ barbarian with 3 points in Spells, consider spending your points on just one or\
  \ two schools. You can easily assign two points to Scrolls and one to Spells, or\
  \ you could pile all three into Swords. It's your call!</p>\n              <p>Just\
  \ what does your Pathfinder training provide? The core mechanic is access to consumable\
  \ items. These represent colleagues' experimental draughts, tools provided by the\
  \ Grand Lodge, or additional gear loaned out by a venture-captain from their own\
  \ inventories. Just after the mission briefing, you'll be able to requisition one\
  \ consumable item for use during the adventure. If you don't use it by the end of\
  \ the adventure, your character returns it. As to what consumable items can you\
  \ acquire - that depends on your school.</p>\n              <p><strong>1 Point:</strong>\
  \ By investing 1 point in a school, you have access to that school's item list,\
  \ and at every odd-numbered level, more options become available for each school.\
  \ In addition, everyone has access to a list of basic healing and bomb options (a\
  \ bomb refers to the classic “splash” weapons like alchemist's fire and acid flasks).\
  \ The starting options for these appear later in this blog.</p>\n              <p><strong>2\
  \ Points:</strong> By investing a second point in a school, the PC begins with a\
  \ bonus Lore skill from a list tied to the school. At 5th level, the PC also gains\
  \ a bonus skill feat from a list tied to that school, representing the PC's ongoing\
  \ training.</p>\n              <p><strong>3 Points:</strong> By investing all three\
  \ points in a school, the PC gains a second consumable item at the start of the\
  \ adventure, though the bonus item's level must be half the PC's level or lower.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Let's take a look at what consumable items are available at 1st\
  \ level for each school.</p>\n              <p><strong>All Schools (1):</strong>\
  \ <em>holy water</em>, lesser [bomb], lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, <emsminor\
  \ healing < em>\n                potion \n                <br>\n               \
  \ <strong>Scrolls (1):</strong>\n                <em>feather token (ladder), lesser\
  \ eagle-eye charm, owlbear charm,</em> sunrod, \n                <em>wolf fang</em>\n\
  \                <br>\n                <strong>Spells (1):</strong> a scroll with\
  \ one of the following 1st-level spells: \n                <em>burning hands, charm,\
  \ fear, harm, heal, mage armor, magic fang, magic missile, magic weapon,</em> or\
  \ \n                <em>soothe</em>. \n                <br>\n                <strong>Swords\
  \ (1):</strong> lesser leaper's elixir, \n                <em>potency crystal</em>,\
  \ \n                <em>shining ammunition</em>\n               </emsminor></p>\n\
  \              <p>When in doubt, you can always choose a healing potion, but having\
  \ some extra school support means you're more likely to have access to the perfect\
  \ tool for the job. In return, it's assumed that your PC spends some of their downtime\
  \ assisting their colleagues in a similar way, whether that's mixing up alchemical\
  \ elixirs, helping repair a lodge, assisting an old friend from back when you were\
  \ both initiates together, or mentoring the next generation of explorers. Pay it\
  \ forward.</p>\n              <p>What about if you don't care about the training\
  \ system? No problem—we asked ourselves the same question when first brainstorming\
  \ this system, and we realized that we could also address one of the other less-explored\
  \ aspects of the Pathfinder Society: field-commissioned agents. These are the explorers\
  \ who have already made a name for themselves by the time they cross paths with\
  \ the Society and for whom a venture-captain chooses to waive the traditional three\
  \ years of training before sponsoring that adventurer to join the Pathfinders. A\
  \ field-commissioned agent (i.e. a PC who invests none of those three points in\
  \ any schools) lacks the deep collegial relationships that a formally trained Pathfinder\
  \ enjoys, and that's represented as restricted access to those free consumable items.\
  \ On the other hand, those agents don't have nearly the same obligations as the\
  \ other Pathfinders, and that means field-commissioned agents earn more Downtime\
  \ per level than other PCs.</p>\n              <p>And if being a field-commissioned\
  \ agent really fits your backstory, but you'd like to use the training points (or\
  \ maybe your agent was classically trained but eschews assisting colleagues and\
  \ ignores the training system), that's cool, too. The training system's a bonus\
  \ to provide your character tools to survive whatever the adventuring life throws\
  \ their way, not to tie your hands as to the stories you can tell. We're looking\
  \ forward to seeing it in action, and we're looking forward to seeing many of you\
  \ at Gen Con!</p>\n              <p>And again, check out Know Direction's live stream\
  \ tonight for all the character creation insights!</p>\n              <p style=\"\
