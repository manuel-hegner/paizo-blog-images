  \ an even bigger event than it was last year! I am scheduling 210 tables of Pathfinder\
  \ Society over three days. We will be offering all Season 4 scenarios multiple times,\
  \ including the debut of the season's final four scenarios. We are also scheduling\
  \ numerous tables of the first level of Jason Bulmahn's megadungeon <i>Ruins of\
  \ Bonekeep: The Silent Grave</i>. In addition, we will be debuting the Season 5\
  \ Pathfinder Society Special that kicks the season off on Friday night. This is\
  \ the same multi-table special that will be run as the Gen Con special. Finally,\
  \ we'll be offering GM 101 sessions again, and hopefully showing off the debut of\
  \ the follow-up GM 201 program. It should be an awesome time.</span></p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/paizocon\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/PaizoCon2013_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I need a minimum of 75 volunteer GMs\
  \ for Pathfinder Society games and I'll keep taking volunteer GMs until the slots\
  \ are filled! I also need 4 Volunteer Assistants for the showâ€”these folks will not\
  \ GM, but will instead help me run Pathfinder Society HQ and will be our go-to guys\
  \ and gals for all things Pathfinder Society.</p> \n     <p>Below you will find\
  \ the reward structure for volunteering at PaizoCon 2013. Keep in mind that you're\
  \ volunteering for slots, not a specific event. We will let you know the slots you\
  \ have been assigned to before the lottery goes live. This should allow you plenty\
  \ of time to plan a schedule with your friends who are also attending PaizoCon 2013.\
  \ Please let me know via email which days you will be at the convention and how\
  \ many slots you are volunteering for at PaizoCon 2013.</p> \n     <h2>Volunteer\
  \ Tiers and Rewards</h2> \n     <p><b>Volunteer Assistant:</b> 4 needed, treated\
  \ as a Tier 1 GM</p> \n     <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers:</b> Tier 1 GM volunteers\
  \ are my everyday GMs. They are invaluable to making the show a success! Tier 1\
  \ GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 5 slots. I only have room for 30\
  \ Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this tier. Volunteers\
  \ will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I reserve the right\
  \ to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over new volunteers.\
  \ Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts that you'll be able\
  \ to attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>A FREE 3-day\
  \ PaizoCon 2013 badge</li> \n      <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for paizo.com credit,\
  \ useable at the show or anytime after, including with your subscriptions.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>A FREE copy of one printed Paizo product of your choice valued at\
  \ $49.99 or less.</li> \n      <li>A FREE Pathfinder Society goblin volunteer t-shirt.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>A special Pathfinder Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <p><b>Tier 2 GM Volunteers:</b> While the rewards for volunteering\
  \ for this tier are smaller, the majority of my volunteers will come from Tier 2.\
  \ Tier 2 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 4 slots. Tier 2 GMs receive:</p> \n\
  \     <ul>\n      <li>A FREE 3-day PaizoCon 2013 badge</li> \n      <li>A $10-per-slot\
  \ voucher for paizo.com credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including\
  \ with your subscriptions.</li> \n      <li>A FREE Pathfinder Society goblin volunteer\
  \ t-shirt.</li> \n      <li>A special Pathfinder Society GM boon available only\
  \ at PaizoCon.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p><b>Tier 3 GM Volunteers:</b> This is the\
  \ minimum volunteer level. Tier 3 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 2 slots. Tier\
  \ 3 GMs receive:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for paizo.com\
  \ credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including subscriptions.</li> \n\
  \      <li>A FREE Pathfinder Society goblin volunteer t-shirt.</li> \n      <li>A\
  \ special Pathfinder Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li>\n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <p>While we will gladly accept anyone who wants to run just one slot during\
  \ the show, there are no rewards for doing so other than our thanks.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>When volunteering, please be specific about what days you are volunteering\
  \ for. I will assign folks to scenarios on an as-needed basis, so you really only\
  \ need to tell me the day(s) you're volunteering for. I will update the needs in\
  \ the thread below as I receive volunteers, so you may look there to remain up to\
  \ date on where we still need help. You must have a paizo.com account and you must\
  \ include your paizo.com email address in your email or I won't be able to get you\
  \ a badge (obviously this is only for volunteers who are volunteering for 4 or more\
  \ slots).</p> \n     <ul style=\"list-style: none;\">\n      <li><b>Slot 1:</b>\
  \ Friday 8 AM to 1 PM</li> \n      <li><b>Slot 2:</b> Friday 1 PM to 6 PM</li> \n\
  \      <li><b>Slot 3:</b> Friday 7 PM to 12 AM</li>\n      <li> </li>\n      <li><b>Slot\
  \ 4:</b> Saturday 8 AM to 1 PM</li> \n      <li><b>Slot 5:</b> Saturday 1 PM to\
  \ 6 PM</li> \n      <li><b>Slot 6:</b> Sunday 9 AM to 2 PM</li>\n     </ul> \n \
  \    <p>All PaizoCon 2013 volunteers should please email me at <a href=\"mailto:mike.brock@paizo.com?Subject=PaizoCon%20Volunteer\"\
  >mike.brock@paizo.com</a> with the subject line PaizoCon Volunteer.</p> \n     <p>Thanks\
  \ in advance for volunteering, good luck, and have a great spring convention season!</p>\
