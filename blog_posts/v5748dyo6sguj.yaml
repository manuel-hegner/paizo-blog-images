  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This week, the Starfinder\
  \ Society team previews upcoming plans for the campaign. Given that we’re getting\
  \ well underway with our second season of play, it’s time to talk about something\
  \ that’s been on everyone’s mind: what’s happening with our First Seeker? </p> \n\
  \     <p> Since the beginning of the Year of Scoured Stars, Luwazi Elsebo has led\
  \ the Society, tirelessly working to maintain the organization. With the climactic\
  \ conclusion of the Scoured Stars storyline in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn5\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #2-00: Fate of the Scoured God</em></a>, Luwazi declared\
  \ her intentions on stepping down from leadership. Having accomplished the mission\
  \ of keeping the Society together and stopping the threat from the Scoured Stars,\
  \ she completed her First Seeker mandate. Recognizing the need for a proper transition\
  \ of leadership, Luwazi will oversee the election to get a new First Seeker, then\
  \ retire. </p> \n     <p> This is where all of you come in. </p> \n     <p> Arriving\
  \ at the end of September, <em>Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First</em>,\
  \ is a new scenario that’s set to introduce us to the four candidates vying for\
  \ First Seeker. These candidates aren’t just random NPCs, but are characters who\
  \ have been selected from among members of our campaign—<a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgkh?April-Update-Second-Seekers-Novas-Spotlights\"\
  >we told you</a> that Second Seekers boon would be important! This scenario sets\
  \ the stage for allowing our campaign members to vote on their desired choice for\
  \ the Society’s future leader. Since Four for the First is so important, we wanted\
  \ to make sure we got the word out well in advance, so everyone has time to prepare.\
  \ Now, let’s go over some of the key dates. </p> \n     <p> </p>\n     <ul> \n \
  \     <li> <strong>September 20th</strong> - we’ll be doing our normal scenario\
  \ preview blogs that highlights Four for the First and the other monthly release.\
  \ This blog will include a non-active link to a survey page. </li> \n      <li>\
  \ <strong>September 25th</strong> - Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First\
  \ releases to the public. At the same time, the associated survey page goes live.\
  \ Players from across the world can vote on their preferred candidate, helping shape\
  \ the future of the Starfinder Society campaign! </li> \n      <li> <strong>November\
  \ 19th at 11:59 PST</strong> - the survey closes. This gives our community two full\
  \ months to play Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First and vote for one of\
  \ the First Seeker candidates. </li> \n      <li> Sometime in early 2020, we’ll\
  \ reveal the results of the vote, which will help to shape the direction of Starfinder\
  \ Society’s third year of play, scheduled for launch at Origins Game Faire June\
  \ 17th 2020. </li> \n     </ul> \n     <p></p> \n     <p> Exciting times ahead!\
  \ </p> \n     <p> Just as we’ve revealed some information now to make organizers\
  \ lives much easier, the team would also like to take an opportunity to discuss\
  \ some key points about <em>Four for the First</em>. </p> \n     <p> </p>\n    \
  \ <ul> \n      <li> This scenario is structured much like a quest pack, where the\
  \ PCs get to perform a mission of importance to each of the First Seeker candidates.\
  \ </li> \n      <li> Since so much of this scenario involves the PCs getting to\
  \ know specific candidates and the types of missions to expect from them, this scenario\
  \ somewhat eases the restrictions on run time. If you want to play this scenario\
  \ over two sessions to make sure none of the interactions feel rushed, please do\
  \ so. </li> \n      <li> Because we want players to get to know the candidates,\
  \ and understand that may take multiple play-throughs, <em>Four for the First</em>\
  \ will be a repeatable scenario. </li> \n      <li> Though players may experience\
  \ the scenario multiple times, only one vote per player counts. </li> \n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <p></p> \n     <p> Ok, so that’s a lot of information, but we really wanted\
  \ to get it out there as soon as possible. We look forward to the upcoming release\
  \ of <em>Four for the First</em> because it’s really going to take the living aspect\
  \ of the Starfinder Society to the next level. </p> \n     <p> Until next time,</p>\
