  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hold fast adventurers! You may have earned your\
  \ bounties chasing down bandits, or by slaying ferocious predators threatening farmers,\
  \ but those roads you travel upon and the cities you spend your gold in require\
  \ upkeep. Open up your money purses and remember—this is for the good of us all!\
  \ It's time for a bit of lighthearted tax season fun!</p> \n    <h2>Taxfest</h2>\
  \ On the 15th day of the month of Gozran, Abadaran priests accompany local tax collectors\
  \ to ensure a fair and respectful collection of monies owed, as well as to ensure\
  \ no foul play occurs on either side. The church does not believe in free handouts\
  \ (indeed, going so far as to charge for healing services and scrolls), but on Taxfest,\
  \ Abadarans put on a lavish feast to as many people as they can fit in their halls.\
  \ In addition to the free meal, Taxfest provides a means for common folk to discuss\
  \ directly with civic leaders on how best to spend the newly collected tax funds.\n\
  \    <p></p> \n    <p>But while the celebrations take place, other members of the\
  \ church are hard at work in the vaults and accounting offices of cities and nations\
  \ everywhere.</p> \n    <h2>Accountomancers</h2> \n    <p>For some members of the\
  \ Abadaran clergy, the truth held in Abadar's holy book, <em>The Order of Numbers</em>\
  \ is more important than the rest of faith's trappings. Less often clerics, oracles,\
  \ or paladins, in truth these \"accountomancers\" (as they refer to themselves)\
  \ are folk who have mastered the intricacies of mathematics and numbers to further\
  \ Abadar's purpose in Golarion. Residing in the banks and temples of Abadar, accountomancers\
  \ ensure that proper procedures from <em>The Order of Numbers</em> are adhered to,\
  \ and carry a ring of golden keys to indicate their rank. The most senior members\
  \ of the order are addressed as Watcher, and bear a single large, unadorned gold\
  \ key. Arbiter inevitables are the preferred familiar of accountomancers, as their\
  \ flight allows the arbiter to assist accountomancers in the high shelves and expansive\
  \ vaults, or any creature capable of climbing (like monkeys) or flying (like ravens).</p>\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20150415-TaxGoblin_360.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration\
  \ by Crystal Frasier</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Upon the completion of their personal\
  \ copies of <em>The Order of Numbers</em>, accountomancers usually keep to the church\
  \ of Abadar, administering to the collection and allocation of city taxes, assisting\
  \ inquisitors who seek out tax evaders, or offering assistance on business practices\
  \ and employment to gain Abadar's favor. The best accountomancers are sought out\
  \ by archbankers and merchant guildmasters to review the financial health of city\
  \ and guild, and these different divisions work closely together to support accuracy,\
  \ completeness, compliance, justness, and order in their cities.</p> \n    <p>Taxfest\
  \ is the holiest day for accountomancers, for while the cities of Golarion are deep\
  \ in celebration, they busily record all of the past year's data in <em>The Eternal\
  \ Ledger</em>. A holy book for accountomancers, the <em>Ledger</em> is held in a\
  \ new city each year, with accountomancers making the journey to the host city to\
  \ take part in the Ritual of Transference. The rite copies the entries in <em>The\
  \ Eternal Ledger</em> to a copy held in the First Vault, and the city's accountomancers\
  \ enjoy the prestige—and magical bonuses to many of their skills—granted by the\
  \ holy tome.</p> \n    <h3>Known Powers</h3> \n    <p>Over the centuries of their\
  \ existence, accountomancers have developed unique skills that have use far outside\
  \ their dusty basements and dim offices.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Massari Method</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>School</b>\
  \ divination; <b>Level</b> cleric/oracle 1, inquisitor 1, sorcerer/wizard 1<br>\
  \ <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b> V, S, F (miniature\
  \ abacus)<br> <b>Range</b> 30 ft.<br> <b>Target</b> see text<br> <b>Duration</b>\
  \ 1 round/level</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Developed by a pair of accountomancers\
  \ dedicated to rooting out corrupt city officials in 4027 A.R., this spell was repurposed\
  \ into combat applications when they had to chase down the offenders. When casting\
  \ this spell, designate an ally within 30 feet. When you and your ally flank the\
  \ same target, you gain an additional +2 insight bonus on melee attacks.</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-title\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 0 0 !important;\">New\
  \ Major Hex</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><i>In Triplicate (Su)</i>: As a\
  \ full-round action, a witch can demand a target within 60 feet repeat its previous\
  \ actions, or suffer the consequence. If the target fails a Will save, it must repeat\
  \ the same actions that it did in the round previous, in the same order, against\
  \ the same target (if applicable), for three rounds. If the target cannot repeat\
  \ its actions, it suffers the effects of the misfortune hex for that round, but\
  \ if it does manage to repeat three rounds, it gains the effect of the fortune hex\
  \ for one round. If repeating an action would be suicidal or obviously harmful,\
  \ the target may make a new Will save. You must have the fortune or misfortune hex\
  \ in order to take this hex. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect, and if\
  \ a creature succeeds on their saving throw against this effect, it is immune for\
  \ 24 hours. Cackle cannot extend the duration of this hex.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <h3>Fallen Accountomancers</h3> \n    <p>Oaths taken by these Abadaran elite\
  \ are not taken lightly, and oathbreakers viewed with a curious mix of derision,\
  \ horror, and grudging admiration. Fraudulent and dishonest acts performed by an\
  \ accountomancer while performing their duties are punished harshly, and immediately.\
  \ Depending upon the crimes committed, stories tell of inevitables hunting down\
  \ fallen members and permanently branding them, cutting them off from the source\
  \ of their powers, or being cursed with poverty and ill fortune. Such <em>axiomatic\
  \ brands</em>, often in the shape of a blackened and broken key of Abadar, are permanent,\
  \ and even Katapesh merchants hesitate before dealing with one of these marked individuals.</p>\
