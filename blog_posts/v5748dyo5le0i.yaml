  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Halloween is less than a week away, so it's\
  \ finally time to deliver on the cosmic horror I've been teasing for the last several\
  \ weeks.</p> \n    <p>You've already seen the enormous Gug, which I've included\
  \ again below since it is so awesome and fits the theme so well.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120810-Gug.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">But the Gug is only one\
  \ of THREE \"mythos\" monsters included in January's <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"\
  >Shattered Star</a> set of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures. He happens to be the largest\
  \ (by far), but he has plenty of company when it comes to monsters inspired by the\
  \ writings of legendary horror author H.P. Lovecraft and his circle of author friends\
  \ from the early 20th Century. Lovecraft is a bit of a patron saint as we approach\
  \ Halloween (and just about every day of the year around Paizo, truth be told),\
  \ and we've been incorporating creatures he imagined in the 20s and 30s into Pathfinder\
  \ from the very start.</span></p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered\
  \ Star</a> set is no exception! Behold, the insidious Nightgaunt, terror of the\
  \ darkened skies!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-Nightgaunt.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-Nightgaunt_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This horrifying creature came straight from Lovecraft's\
  \ mind, making its most notable appearance in his epic <a href=\"http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.asp\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">\"Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,\"</a> one of the great author's\
  \ more fantastical yarns. </p> \n    <p>In the words of the master:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>\"Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark, Carter felt his\
  \ curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand. Then he\
  \ heard it clatter down over the rocks below. And between him and the Milky Way\
  \ he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned\
  \ and tailed and bat-winged. Other things, too, had begun to blot out patches of\
  \ stars west of him, as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently\
  \ out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice. Then a sort of cold\
  \ rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he was lifted\
  \ inconsiderately up and swung about in space. Another minute and the stars were\
  \ gone, and Carter knew that the night-gaunts had got him.\"</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>WizKids did a marvelous job on this figure. The sheen on its very dark\
  \ blue hide <i>looks</i> rubbery and cold. They captured the nightgaunt's bat-wings\
  \ and noxious thinness very, very well. You definitely don't want to get scooped\
  \ up by these guys on some moonless Golarion night.</p> \n    <p>The nightgaunts\
  \ appear in the fifth installment of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8v2v\">\"Into the Nightmare\
  \ Rift.\"</a> And I'm happy to say that they don't invade Golarion in this one,\
  \ mostly because the player characters instead have to go to their vile home dimension\
  \ of Leng!</p> \n    <p>Next up this week, we round out our cosmic horror with a\
  \ creature created by one of Lovecraft's friends and collaborators, Frank Belknap\
  \ Long. I speak of course of the legendary Hounds of Tindalos, from Long's 1931\
  \ story of the same name. The Hounds also appear in Lovecraft's \"The Whisperer\
  \ in Darkness,\" published the same year.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-HoundOfTindalos.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-HoundOfTindalos_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Belknap Long's terrifying Hounds of Tindalos\
  \ dwell in the very distant past, and access the present through the angles of time\
  \ to menace folk with their canine bodies and evil, hollow tongues designed for\
  \ draining bodily fluids. They secrete a strange blue ichor from their hides. From\
  \ the story:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>\"They are lean and athirst!\"\
  \ he shrieked... \"All the evil in the universe was concentrated in their lean,\
  \ hungry bodies. Or had they bodies? I saw them only for a moment, I cannot be certain.\"\
  </i> â€” Frank Belknap Long, \"The Hounds of Tindalos\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>Well, Frank, they have bodies, complete with gross backwards-bending legs\
  \ and nasty claws. And they're coming your way in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>!</p> \n    <p>So that's it for this week! Two\
  \ terrible cosmic horrors from the depths of the mythos come to menace your campaigns.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'd say that their incursion into your games counts as both a trick <i>and</i>\
  \ a treat!</p> \n    <p>Happy Halloween, everyone!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
