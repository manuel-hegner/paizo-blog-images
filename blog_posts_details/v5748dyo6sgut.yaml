    \ have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood,\
    \ lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material\
    \ component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks\
    \ to sense or locate that creature."
