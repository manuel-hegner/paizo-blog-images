  \ we introduced the concept of major and minor factions, as well as <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgn1?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\"\
  \ title=\"Pathfinder Society Second Edition Preview: Horizon Hunters &amp; Radiant\
  \ Oath\">introduced the first of our new factions</a> for the Second Edition campaign:\
  \ the Horizon Hunters and Radiant Oath. Then at PaizoCon (and in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgnv?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\"\
  \ title=\"Pathfinder Society Second Edition Preview: Envoys' Alliance &amp; Verdant\
  \ Wheel\">a follow-up blog</a>) we shared two more factions, including the Envoys’\
  \ Alliance and the Verdant Wheel. Today we introduce the last of our major factions!\
  \ </p> \n     <h2>Grand Archive (Major Faction)</h2> \n     <p>Archaeology is a\
  \ destructive science, and adventurers tend to be more destructive than most. If\
  \ the Society’s to uphold its mandate to study and preserve the past, then documentation\
  \ and academic rigor are key. Yet members of the Grand Archive do not limit themselves\
  \ to Absalom’s libraries; these bold explorers’ voyage to the most exciting sites\
  \ to chronicle the past in person and share those tales with the world.</p> \n \
  \    <p><strong>Faction Leader</strong>: Although third in line for the Sky Citadel\
  \ Kraggodan’s throne, <strong>Gorm Greathammer</strong> (LN male dwarf) has always\
  \ been drawn to the adventuring lifestyle. His passion drew him to the Pathfinder\
  \ Society decades ago, where he distinguished himself as an explorer and chronicler,\
  \ having numerous publications to his name and countless stories to retell. Even\
  \ so, he regularly returned home to help administrate the sky citadel. After withstanding\
  \ the exhausting Ironfang Invasion and direceting peace negotiations with Molthune,\
  \ he returned to the Grand Lodge on an extended leave of absence. He now oversees\
  \ the Grand Archive, promoting scholarship and uncovering centuries-old mysteries\
  \ to solve at long last. Yet those who would expect the Grand Archive’s leader to\
  \ be a shy, spectacled sage are in for a surprise; Gorm is daring, boisterous, and\
  \ ready to get his hands dirty alongside his allies.</p> \n     <p><strong>Objectives:</strong>\
  \ The Grand Archive promotes the ongoing education of Pathfinder agents, the recovery\
  \ of ancient knowledge, and the mastery of esoteric lore. Thanks to Gorm Greathammer’\
  s leadership, the faction also encourages travel, so that agents can experience\
  \ history directly, draw their own conclusions, and ensure that all relics receive\
  \ the care and curation they deserve—especially where a berserker’s boots might\
  \ otherwise shatter a priceless statue. After years of neglect and several noteworthy\
  \ attacks, the Grand Lodge’s written records are a tattered shadow of what they\
  \ once were, and the Grand Archive is dedicated to restoring the Society’s libraries\
  \ by seeking replacement texts and long-lost documents the world over.</p> \n  \
  \   <h2>Vigilant Seal (Major Faction)</h2> \n     <p>Rune-sealed doors, buried temples,\
  \ warded vaults, and ancient keeps…these are among the most tantalizing sites for\
  \ explorers to delve, yet all too often these ruins were abandoned for the same\
  \ reason: their contents were too dangerous to leave unfettered yet too enduring\
  \ to destroy outright. The Pathfinder Society’s track record of unleashing forgotten\
  \ horrors while in the pursuit of glory and lore is dubious. Yet for every imprisoned\
  \ fiend accidentally released while Pathfinders explore overgrown shrines, the explorers\
  \ have also uncovered and defeated slumbering evils that would have otherwise emerged\
  \ to plague the world unforeseen and uncontested. As far as the Vigilant Seal’s\
  \ concerned, this tradition of cavalier recklessness must change.</p> \n     <p><strong>Faction\
  \ Leader</strong>: Among the most famous Pathfinders of the previous decade, Eando\
  \ Kline (CG male human) famously explored Varisia, infiltrated the Hold of Belkzen,\
  \ and plumbed the Darklands’ depths to uncover a lost serpentfolk city. Knowing\
  \ that further publicity would encourage exploration and goad the serpentine villains\
  \ to attack the surface, Kline returned to the Grand Lodge ahead of his rival Arnois\
  \ Belzig, urging the Decemvirate not to publish either of their findings. The Decemvirate\
  \ dismissed his concerns, and in disgust, Eando Kline resigned from the Society.\
  \ For the past decade he’s led his own expeditions, always endeavoring to explore\
  \ more responsibly than the organization he left behind. Yet with news of a change\
  \ in the Decemvirate and respected colleagues rising to positions of power, Eando\
  \ Kline has returned to the Society at last, accepting his old wayfinder so long\
  \ as he could lead in the organization’s reform.</p> \n     <p><strong>Objectives:</strong>\
  \ Just as the Pathfinder Society decrees that its agents must “explore, report,\
  \ and cooperate,” the Vigilant Seal expects its agents to “protect, contain, and\
  \ destroy.” Dangerous artifacts are often best kept deep within the Grand Lodge\
  \ or other secure sites, rather than left where they might cause harm. Where slumbering\
  \ evils lie chained, agents are expected to ensure every link remains strong. And\
  \ where those goals are impossible, those agents must be ready to neutralize the\
  \ threat. The Vigilant Seal encourages its agents to be educated enough to identify\
  \ and understand hazards, and Eando Kline believes that individual Pathfinders must\
  \ exercise their own discretion in assessing the danger and knowing when to intervene.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And with that, you’ve now met all six of our starting factions, including\
  \ four major factions and two minor factions. There are more previews yet to come,\
  \ and of course even more to share at the new campaign’s launch on August 1st!</p>\
