  artist: "way of a swashbuckling, space-faring barbarian. If this was escapism, it\
    \ was for a new generation of sophisticated genre fans. It was into that climate—\
    Leigh's climate—that Star Wars and I showed up on the scene. I had tried to capture\
    \ my own nostalgia for the movies I grew up with, including the movies that Leigh\
    \ had written. I loved that organic flow of film-speak that balanced between heightened\
    \ reality and easy, comfortable, conversational dialogue. And her groundwork had\
    \ helped to inspire me to move away"
