  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">A bearded man clad in blue\
  \ armor raced through the side corridors of Absalom Station, his gold-trimmed capelet\
  \ flapping behind him. His eyes wild, he threw glances over his shoulder as he careened\
  \ around corners and nearly toppled precariously stacked piles of empty crates and\
  \ garbage. He came to a skidding halt in front of an unmarked door to a nondescript\
  \ structure and quickly tapped an eight-digit code in the nearby keypad, muttering,\
  \ “Hurry, hurry” to himself. The multiple locks disengaged with a series of electronic\
  \ clicks and the man threw open the door with a sharp exhalation. The light beyond\
  \ spilled into the alleyway.</p> \n     <hr color=\"#696969\"> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p><i>The bright light enveloped Reyard Maldun as he dozed fitfully on\
  \ the couch in his office. He had sat down for just a moment to rest his eyes after\
  \ a long day of filing reports, thinking he would soon grab a bite for dinner at\
  \ the noodle stand just outside the base, but clearly more than a few minutes had\
  \ passed. To Reyard’s ears, it sounded like the rest of the office was empty. He\
  \ tried to move his arm to block the light from his face but found that he couldn’\
  t. He was paralyzed. All he could do was breathe and wait.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Seconds\
  \ later, he felt himself being lifted up, weightless in the beam of light. He began\
  \ to float gently toward the window. He could see his face—a mask of terror—reflected\
  \ in the glass as he seemed to phase quietly through it and into the night sky beyond.</i></p>\

  \ James</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Looking at himself in the mirror, Reyard ran\
  \ his fingers through his matted brown hair. How long had it been since he had it\
  \ cut? How long since he had taken a shower? Eaten a good meal? Gotten a full night’\
  s sleep?</p> \n     <p>No matter. Such trivialities were for those not being hunted.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He stepped out of the small bathroom, added to the converted storefront\
  \ almost as an afterthought. When he realized he might be spending hours, perhaps\
  \ days, here, he had brought in a canvas cot and had the toilet and sink installed.\
  \ He had paid the plumber extra to quietly hook into the neighborhood’s water main\
  \ without alerting the neighbors. The building wasn’t zoned for residential use.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Not that Reyard was living here, exactly. This was merely his command\
  \ center, his base of operations. A place where he could perform his “unsanctioned”\
  \ investigations in privacy… Hopefully.</p> \n     <p>Most of the space was occupied\
  \ by a large wooden desk, a small server tower, several plastic storage bins, and\
  \ a pair of free-standing holomarker boards. The bins were empty, their contents\
  \ spread across the floor: printouts of infosphere pages, cheap datapads displaying\
  \ a series of blurry photographs, and random pieces of other technology in various\
  \ states of disassembly. Paper notebooks cluttered the desk, each open to pages\
  \ filled with dense walls of text and hasty sketches. The tidiest portion of the\
  \ desk’s surface held an array of electronic tools in neat row. Reyard reached for\
  \ one.</p> \n     <hr color=\"#696969\"> \n     <p> </p>\n     <blockquote> \n \
  \     <p><i>The alien reached for the laser scalpel with long, slender fingers,\
  \ selecting the instrument from one of others lined up precisely on a tray of shiny,\
  \ silver metal. Reyard lay on a table of similar material, restrained by several\
  \ bands of glowing energy. He tried to cry out, but his mouth was frozen shut, his\
  \ tongue a useless lump of meat. The alien turned back to face him. Though it was\
  \ no more than three feet tall, it loomed over Reyard as it peered unblinking at\
  \ his helpless form. It ignited the scalpel and the blackness of its large eyes\
  \ seemed to swallow him whole.</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <hr color=\"\
  #696969\"> \n     <p>The dark monitors on his desk flared to life, and the computer\
  \ prompted Reyard to enter a series of passwords and to finally press his eye to\
  \ a retinal scanner before presenting him with his home desktop. Like the room,\
  \ the computer was a mess of files and programs, arranged in no particular order.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Reyard connected the computer to the infosphere, entering another password\
  \ that bypassed the security to prevent such a thing from happening by accident.\
  \ He initiated a program of his own design that would upload the contents of the\
  \ server—months and months of his painstaking research—to multiple infosphere sites\
  \ simultaneously. Using various aliases, he had compared notes with other truth\
  \ seekers on these sites, some more in touch with reality than others. He knew his\
  \ pursuers would quickly find and erase all instances of his uploads before the\
  \ night was over, but he hoped that in doing so, they wouldn’t look for the notebooks\
  \ he stashed around the station. Reyard looked over at the door. He whispered, “\
  Come on, you bastards. Where are you?”</p> \n     <hr color=\"#696969\"> \n    \
  \ <blockquote> \n      <p><i>“Where is your head, Maldun? I remember when you were\
  \ one of my top agents.” Chief Inspector Theovos was a stout korasha lashunta woman\
  \ with truncated antennae. She sat behind her imposing desk in her Stewards armor\
  \ and waited for Reyard to respond. He simply stared at his boots and muttered an\
  \ apology.</i></p> \n      <p><i>“Several months ago,” Theovos said, pulling up\
  \ a file on a datapad, “You reported that you had been abducted from your office\
  \ in the dead of night. Building security found no signs of intrusion. And though\
  \ you claimed to have been operated on, medical can’t detect a thing wrong with\
  \ you. A psych eval determined you were disturbed by a particularly vivid dream,\
  \ but you have refused further counseling. Since then, you’ve been pursuing these\
  \ ‘little gray men’ to the detriment of your other work, dredging up only a mass\
  \ of ridiculous conspiracy theories and turning yourself into the laughingstock\
  \ of the base.”</i></p> \n      <p><i>Reyard opened his mouth to speak, but Theovos\
  \ cut him off. “No. Don’t bother. I’m transferring you to Absalom Station for desk\
  \ duty until you at least agree to seek help for these delusions.” Her eyes softened\
  \ a bit. “Reyard, there’s still time.”</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <hr color=\"\
  #696969\"> \n     <p>It would still take several moments until the uploads were\
  \ complete. Reyard hoped there would be enough time. He peered up at the ceiling.\
  \ With any luck, he had installed the electronic trip sensors correctly.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The door behind him dematerialized with a flash. A small figure with gray\
  \ skin and bulbous head stood silhouetted in the entrance.</p> \n     <p>“Try to\
  \ take me again if you want, but the moment you step inside this room, a force field\
  \ will block your exit and half a dozen vidcams will stream your ugly mug all across\
  \ the infosphere.” The alien didn’t move. A chime from the computer indicated the\
  \ uploads were finished. Reyard smiled. “That’s the sound of the whole system learning\
  \ the truth. Hide all you want. Someone will always shine a light in the dark corners\
  \ of the universe.”</p> \n     <p>A single word pierced his thoughts.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><i>Incorrect.</i></p> \n     <p>Suddenly, the power to the building was cut.\
  \ The room was plunged into darkness.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
