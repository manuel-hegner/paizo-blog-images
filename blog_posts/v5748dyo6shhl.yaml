  \ is Thanksgiving in the United States, and several other countries celebrated their\
  \ day of giving thanks over the past months. While celebrations look very different\
  \ for all of us this year, we wanted to take a moment to give thanks to our Paizo\
  \ community. Without you all, the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder would be just\
  \ stories we told ourselves. We’re grateful for all your support, and wish you well\
  \ as this year comes to a close. We also want to thank the Organized Play community\
  \ organizers for supporting our programs in the face of tremendous adversity. Without\
  \ the venture-officers, we would lack structure and without GMs, games. To all of\
  \ you who spend time planning schedules and completing tasks behind the scenes,\
  \ a huge shout out of thanks!</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>Every year\
  \ we have several dozen conventions/events which support charities. We developed\
  \ the charity boon programs to support these efforts. This year, without physical\
  \ gatherings, we thought the support for charities would diminish. In light of this\
  \ year’s adverse conditions, we’re especially thankful for the tremendous generosity\
  \ of our players. We’d like to recognize a few the events who conducted charitable\
  \ activities and supported the charities’ good works!</p> \n     <p><b>Contingency\
