  \ itemprop=\"description\">PaizoCon's one of our biggest events, particularly for\
  \ new adventures. Not only do we finish all of the May adventures early to send\
  \ out to GMs, but we add in a multi-table interactive special to boot! Phew! Thankfully,\
  \ the first two waves (for PaizoCon and Origins)are done with the Gen Con adventures\
  \ still ahead, so while we can breathe a brief sigh of relief, there's always a\
  \ whole lot left to do. And if you're at PaizoCon, you'll be able to see all of\
  \ us there. If you're at Origins, Thurston, John, and Tonya will be in attendance\
  \ to kick off the new year of Starfinder Society content.</p> \n    <p>But let's\
  \ focus on today's real stars: the new scenarios!</p> \n    <p>In <a href=\"/products/btq01yyx?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1020-Countdown-to-Round-Mountain\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-20: Countdown to Round Mountain</em></a>, a\
  \ Tier 7–11 adventure written by Jerall Toi, the PCs are part of a massive Pathfinder\
  \ Society expedition into the Darklands beneath Tian Xia. They're tasked with obtaining\
  \ any information they can from a cavern known as The Old Rat's Broken Heart, as\
  \ well as evacuating anyone currently inhabiting the area, before the Hao Jin Tapestry\
  \ ejects the geographic oddity known as Round Mountain and sends it crashing back\
  \ to earth.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS1020E-Construct.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Tadas Sidlauskas</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is\
  \ no mere spelunking expedition, however, as the PCs have to exercise their archaeological\
  \ and investigative skills while negotiating with the inhabitants of The Old Rat's\
  \ Broken Heart. As though coordinating an archaeological expedition on a tight and\
  \ deadly timeframe weren't enough, the PCs face additional complications in the\
  \ form of dangerous threats like this fearsome metallic warrior.</p> \n    <p>For\
  \ our next adventure, <a href=\"/products/btq01yyy?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1021-Slavers-End\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-21: Slaver's End</em></a>, author Vanessa Hoskins\
  \ takes us on a Tier 5–9 mission to track down traitorous former venture-captain\
  \ Phlegos Dulm. For over a decade, Phlegos served as the Society's primary connection\
  \ and coordinator in the markets of Katapesh and the barren wilds surrounding the\
  \ city, often undermining the efforts of Katapesh's other two venture-captains,\
  \ Wulessa Yuul and Aurora Steelbloom. Phlegos was ultimately driven from the city\
  \ when an alliance of Katapeshi goblins, the Liberty's Edge faction, and the rest\
  \ of their Pathfinder allies revealed the half-orc poisoner's perfidy and drove\
  \ him from the city.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS1021E-Corsair.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Teresa Guido Sidlauskas</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Karisa\
  \ Starsight, a steward for the Liberty's Edge faction, has uncovered documents indicating\
  \ that Phlegos's betrayals may have been even more profound than initially realized.\
  \ As it turns out, several groups of Pathfinders reported missing in action under\
  \ his purview may actually have been captured and sold as slaves in the slave markets\
  \ of seedy Sedeq, located on Qadira's southern peninsula. Karisa calls upon the\
  \ PCs to join her in Sedeq and help her track down Phlegos and the missing Pathfinders.\
  \ Unbeknownst to Karisa, another old foe lurks in the shadows, using Phlegos's corruption\
  \ to her own ends. Who is this dangerous corsair, and what dangers might her involvement\
  \ portend?</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btq01yyz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1098-Siege-of-Gallowspire\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-98: Siege of Gallowspire</em></a> is the final\
  \ interactive special for Pathfinder Society using the First Edition rules. It is\
  \ a Tier 5–16 scenario, with Subtiers 5–6, 7–8, 10–11, 12–13, and 15–16.</p> \n\
  \    <p>From the earliest days of creating this adventure, we knew that we wanted\
  \ it to have a grand scope, and to feature a way to include more than one PC per\
  \ player in the story. We also wanted to be sure that the story was satisfying without\
  \ being complicated, while still giving definite nods to the journeys the PCs have\
  \ taken to get to this point. Finally, we wanted to offer a challenge for those\
  \ wanting to dial it up to eleven!</p> \n    <p>In <em>Siege of Gallowspire</em>,\
  \ the PCs confront the plots of one of Golarion's most infamous villains: the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant. This ancient lich has begun a ritual that threatens to create new armies\
  \ of undead to serve him, and it's up to the Pathfinder Society to stop the ritual\
  \ before it's too late. The situation is serious enough that even the famously jolly\
  \ Master of Swords Marcos Farabellus isn't smiling, illustrated below by Sebastian\
  \ Gomez.</p> \n    <p>So how does this scenario include multiple PCs per player?\
  \ Players bring one usual character, and they can also bring up to three of their\
  \ other PCs to act as Aid Characters. Aid Characters are PCs of level 5–20 that\
  \ have two roles. They create personalized Aid Tokens—special benefits that players\
  \ can hand out to other tables after each encounter. Aid Characters can also participate\
  \ in special Aid Missions during the scenario. Each Aid Mission is led by one of\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's most famous venture-captains. These missions are dangerous,\
  \ but they could have big payoffs! To use a PC as an Aid Character, you do not need\
  \ all of their Chronicle sheets and papers. You just need the most recent Chronicle\
  \ sheet that character has earned. If you don't have enough PCs to fill in your\
  \ three Aid Character slots, that's OK too. You can use 4th-level pregenerated characters\
  \ instead. They aren't as effective as your own PCs would be, but they can still\
  \ participate in the story.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <p>Illustration by Sebastian Gomez</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>When it comes\
  \ to challenge, <em>Siege of Gallowspire</em> has two difficulty modes. The first,\
  \ Soldier, is a little bit harder than a typical special, but players also have\
  \ more resources than normal to help them out. The second, Champion, is akin to\
  \ the Hard Mode option that has been offered in past scenarios, offering an additional\
  \ challenge for tables of players who prefer to face stronger foes.</p> \n    <p>Check\
  \ back this afternoon for a preview of May's Starfinder Society scenarios.</p> \n\
