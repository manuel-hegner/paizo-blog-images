  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Over the past few weeks, I've been spending some time\
  \ talking to folks on the unofficial <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2ndEdPFPlaytest/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">2nd Ed Pathfinder Playtest group on Facebook</a>. Mostly I've\
  \ been listening to people's thoughts and anecdotes about the playtest, but I've\
  \ also been answering a few rules questions and conversing about various subjects.\
  \ Something that's come up a couple of times in that group and in other forums is\
  \ how we, the folks at Paizo and especially the design team, respond to criticism.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We are no stranger to playtests. Each time we launch a playtest, we get\
  \ a pile of feedback, both positive and negative. Both are important. Of course,\
  \ we all love hearing what you like, and in a perfect world we would bask in the\
  \ glory of your adoration... but we only create worlds of fantasy, we don't live\
  \ in one. We playtest to hear what you think about the rules and to get your take\
  \ on what is sound, exciting, and fun. Sometimes you might not care for our initial\
  \ design. Sometimes you'll spot problems with the initial design. We want you to\
  \ tell us. No, we need you to tell us. We're making this game not for ourselves,\
  \ but for all of us to play!</p> \n    <p>Case in pointâ€”let's talk about Resonance\
  \ Points.</p> \n    <p>Yeah, that's right. I'm going there.</p> \n    <p>Let's talk\
  \ about exactly what design challenges Resonance Points were designed to solve,\
  \ as that seems to be a point of some confusion.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >First, they're meant to address the economy of lower-level consumable magic items\
  \ as you level up. This is colloquially referred to as the wand of cure light wounds\
  \ issue in Pathfinder First Edition, but it's more systemic than that. In short,\
  \ as you go up in level and your ability to purchase and craft (or find) lower-level\
  \ consumable magic items increases, they actually become the most economical use\
  \ of resources. When you are limited only by what you have on hand, the amount of\
  \ bang per buck makes higher-level magic items nearly pointless.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ problem and the Pathfinder First Edition method of item pricing also played havoc\
  \ with lower-level items with limited uses per day. Designers, by nature, want you\
  \ to use the items they created in actual play. But adventure designers are often\
  \ under budgetary constraints to make not the best item for the story, but the one\
  \ that does the trick while still conforming to the amount of treasure output in\
  \ the design guides. These factors often created a race to the bottom, design-wise,\
  \ spawning tons of these little X-per-day buggers that characters could afford,\
  \ featuring relatively powerful (and always useful) effects that often became more\
  \ useful as you gained levels. All of this creates a sort of mini-nova during climactic\
  \ encounters, as characters spend a handful of swift and immediate actions ramping\
  \ up to their optimal tactics. This is especially true for classes in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook</em>, since they typically have fewer class-based options competing\
  \ for the use of swift and immediate actions.</p> \n    <p>Another problem Resonance\
  \ Points are trying to address is what is often called the \"Christmas Tree\" effect\
  \ of games that impose limits based solely on magic item slots. This goes hand in\
  \ hand with the cheap consumable (or X-uses-per-day items), as many players rush\
  \ to fill their slots with items featuring charges or uses per day. While slots\
  \ still exist in the Pathfinder Playtest, they are the exception rather than the\
  \ rule, and their primary goal is simply reducing redundancies (like wearing two\
  \ pairs of boots at the same time and similar nonsense).</p> \n    <p>Lastly, the\
  \ Resonance Point system is intended to eliminate or at least severely limit the\
  \ bookkeeping involved in those X-uses-per-day and X-rounds-per-day items. Instead\
  \ of tracking a bunch of little point pools, Resonance Points can do the job in\
  \ most, if not all, cases, with the rest limited to once per day. Admittedly, this\
  \ aspect was not as thoroughly implemented as it could have been in the playtest\
  \ rules.</p> \n    <p>Those are the main issues that the Resonance Point system\
  \ is trying to confront. Are there problems with the current implementation? You\
  \ bet. The most glaring one is that it's currently not doing a good job of reducing\
  \ the number of magic item use-per-day pools at higher levels. We're going to need\
  \ to pound the system into shape a little more to achieve that goal.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ big issue is that a lot of folks just plain don't like Resonance Points. There\
  \ are many reasons for that. It's new and different from what people are used to.\
  \ Other folks don't see the challenges this system is trying to tackle, or they\
  \ don't see them as problematic. More telling is that even many who do understand\
  \ the issues have some misgivings, feel that this solution is too artificial, or\
  \ see it as just plain punitive. We anticipated that. But even with all of the issues,\
  \ we knew that the current design of Resonance Points would give us valuable information\
  \ about play patterns and consumable use throughout the playtest, and it has done\
  \ that in spades already and continues to do so.</p> \n    <p>Better still, it has\
  \ given us valuable information on how to solve the issues that the Resonance Point\
  \ system confronts in a better and more pleasing way for the final game. In short,\
  \ your use of the current incarnation of Resonance Points throughout the playtest\
  \ helps us come up with better mechanics to use in Pathfinder Second Edition. You've\
  \ done a great job in providing us that information already, and as we move into\
  \ higher-level play, that useful data will become more abundant.</p> \n    <p>So,\
  \ in the case of Resonance Points, positivity of play and critical comments have\
  \ guided us in the right direction. We already have a few options on how to either\
  \ fix or replace the mechanic, and we are going to keep on kicking ideas around\
  \ as the playtest data keeps flowing in. So keep on filling out those surveys and\
  \ sharing your opinions. Getting your thoughts on the game and how it plays, no\
  \ matter how you express them, is what the Pathfinder Playtest is all about.</p>\
