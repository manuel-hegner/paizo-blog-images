  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In the last week, you may have\
  \ noticed Wes introducing two new developers here on this blog. Sadly, this has\
  \ led the editorial team to the only logical conclusion: the developers must be\
  \ bolstering their forces in preparation for an assault across the cube wall, in\
  \ which they'll attempt to annex editor space. I can assure you, however, that the\
  \ editors aren't about to go down without a fight, which is why we've hired a brand\
  \ new word-warrior: editor Jason Keeley!</p> \n    <p>While I go secure the perimeter\
  \ defenses, here's Jason to introduce himself:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150319-JasonKeeley.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>Hello! I'm Jason Keeley, the newest editor here at Paizo. I'm thrilled\
  \ to be working with this group of talented people.</p> \n     <p>I was introduced\
  \ to RPGs shortly after college. Before that, I had only played video games like\
  \ Might &amp; Magic and Baldur's Gate, so I was familiar with the concept, but I\
  \ didn't realize how quickly tabletop gaming would become such a huge part of my\
  \ life. Soon after, I discovered Paizo through Dungeon magazine, and started running\
  \ the Savage Tide Adventure Path. Many, many APs later (I even ran two at once!),\
  \ I felt ready to begin contributing to the game I enjoyed so much. I contributed\
  \ a short story and a monster to issues of <i>Wayfinder</i>, wrote a grimoire of\
  \ spells for Fat Goblin Games' Vathak setting, and, most recently, made it to the\
  \ top 16 of <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar 2015</a>. I would have liked\
  \ to continue in the contest, but, as you can see, the Golem came calling for me!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Outside of Pathfinder-related material, I edit stories for the swords-and-sorcery\
  \ e-zine <i>Worlds Without Master</i>, as well as function as the editor-in-chief\
  \ of my own (small) imprint, Pantheon Press. Our flagship product, <i>Fortune's\
  \ Fool</i>, a Tarot-based RPG, won a Judge's Choice ENnie in 2011!</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ my spare time, I enjoy reading, all kinds of gaming, and looking at funny pictures\
  \ on the internet. Especially funny pictures of dogs.</p> \n     <p>Jason Keeley<br>\
  \ <i>Editor</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Please help us welcome Jason to\
  \ Paizo! With any luck, he'll survive the initial skirmishes. (If the photo is any\
  \ indication, he's clearly no stranger to international espionage...)</p> \n   \
