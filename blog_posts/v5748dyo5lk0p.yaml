  \ itemprop=\"description\">Building a party of adventurers for the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game is about more than just selecting your warriors, your healers, and your\
  \ disablers. You also have to consider the characters' most notable aspects—their\
  \ unique powers—and how those powers interact.</p> \n    <h2>Choose powers that\
  \ work together</h2> \n    <p>Powers work best when they allow characters to support\
  \ each other. There are many ways to do this. They can be directly additive, or\
  \ they can be supportive in several different ways. Each of these methodologies\
  \ requires some discussion of its own.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Don't assume\
  \ that complementary powers must be used together.</i> Even if you build your party\
  \ so that certain powers help characters work together, they don't <i>always</i>\
  \ have to be used that way. You'll usually want to put the best co-op characters,\
  \ like Lem, with someone else, but you don't necessarily need to group together\
  \ your other power combos until the going gets tough.</p> \n    <h2>Choose powers\
  \ that are additive</h2> \n    <p>Some powers are directly additive, meaning they\
  \ each provide bonuses to the same action. This makes them both powerful and easy\
  \ to use. For example, Lem can give others bonuses when he has cards to recharge,\
  \ and Lini can give herself bonuses when she has animals to reveal. This combination\
  \ can make Lini able to succeed at almost any check because she'll start with three\
  \ dice, and after a few power feats on their role cards, she may even have a +7\
  \ on top of that!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LemCharacterFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LemCharacterFront_360.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Front_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Lem + Lini = Lemmy? Insert joke about Lem's sideburns here.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <h2>Choose powers that support powers</h2> \n    <p>Powers can\
  \ also support other powers in less obvious ways. For example, Lem and Valeros can\
  \ help characters at their locations, while Amiri can move characters around at\
  \ the end of her turn. These powers aren't directly additive, but they're still\
  \ complementary: When Lem and Amiri are at the same location, Lem can take his turn,\
  \ then support Amiri during her turn. At the end of Amiri's turn, she can take Lem\
  \ to another location where he can help out whoever's there.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: Turn order is important.</i> The order in which players go can have an impact\
  \ on how powers interact. For example, Amiri must go immediately after Lem and before\
  \ other players for their particular combo to work optimally.</p> \n    <h2>Choose\
  \ powers that support weaknesses</h2> \n    <p>Good power choice isn't just about\
  \ creating power combos. You can also choose powers that benefit other characters\
  \ in other ways. Best of all, powers can support other characters' weakness. For\
  \ example, without spending resources, Lini's combat checks are typically limited\
  \ to a couple of smaller dice, so building a party that also includes Harsk or Valeros\
  \ can help to overcome that weakness.</p> \n    <p>As another example: many role\
  \ cards offer improved abilities for acquiring certain types of cards. They can\
  \ be used to help other characters who want those types of cards but aren't very\
  \ good at acquiring them. For example, Sajan is great at using blessings efficiently,\
  \ and in her Healer role, Kyra is great at acquiring them.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SajanFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SajanFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Healer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Healer_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Count your blessings. If you don't have enough, ask Kyra.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Also consider card gaps.</i> When a character's\
  \ cards list precludes them from having cards of a particular type, that can be\
  \ a pretty grave weakness. So, support those too! For example, Ezren, Lem, Sajan,\
  \ and Seoni don't tend to have much in the way of armor in hand. This makes them\
  \ particularly vulnerable to powers that deal damage before you act, which can make\
  \ them unable to fight. You can support that weakness by teaming them up with Valeros\
  \ in his Guardian role, which lets him reduce damage to other characters.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Choose powers that support card usage</h2> \n    <p>Another important aspect\
  \ of characters is how they use cards. Are they likely to discard, recharge, bury,\
  \ or banish? You should assess these patterns, and then give your party powers that\
  \ support them.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Link discarders with healers.</i>\
  \ Some characters discard a lot. For example, Harsk tends to discard his weapons\
  \ and Seoni discards for fire blasts. A healing power like Kyra's or Seelah's can\
  \ support this.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: Link buriers with acquirers.</i> Amiri\
  \ can be tricky to play because she buries cards to generate bonuses, reducing the\
  \ size of her deck over time. Pair her with someone like Lini, who is good at all\
  \ low-level acquisitions due to her animal companions, or characters who get better\
  \ at acquiring cards when they adopt their roles; they can feed Amiri's burial customs.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Consider the ranges of powers</h2> \n    <p>There's one last thing to\
  \ consider when choosing powers. What range do they have? Do they work better if\
  \ characters are together or apart?</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Pick a few characters\
  \ who benefit from being alone.</i> PACG generally rewards you for splitting up\
  \ so that you can cover as many locations as possible. The fastest way to win is\
  \ to close two locations and then sit on all the rest until you hit the villain.\
  \ So, characters who benefit from being alone are quite valuable, whether that's\
  \ Merisiel, who can fight better while alone; or ranged characters like Harsk and\
  \ Lirianne, who can support others from afar.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: If you\
  \ pick one character who works well with others, pick a second.</i> Don't leave\
  \ a helper on their own! Lem and Valeros are an example of a great combo: Valeros\
  \ can help Lem fight and Lem can help Valeros do everything else.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #3: Don't overspecialize on either loner or group characters.</i> You don't want\
  \ too many characters who benefit from being at the same location, else you'll be\
  \ discouraged from spreading out; and similarly, you don't want too many characters\
  \ that are penalized when they're together, else you'll often have problems when\
  \ facing the final villain, if you've closed most of the locations.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #4: Be especially thoughtful about ranges if you're playing with just two characters</i>\
  \ If you only have two characters, don't pick a pair where one player works well\
  \ alone and one works well with others. Merisiel and Valeros would be a poor combo,\
  \ as would Lem and Harsk.</p> \n    <p>Of course, character roles and complementary\
  \ powers aren't the only thing to consider when putting together a party. There's\
  \ a lot more, as the next article will discuss.</p> \n    <p>Shannon Appelcline<br>\
