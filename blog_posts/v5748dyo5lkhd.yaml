  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, February 19, 2018</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Okay, so I need to get this off my chest. We\
  \ all know the classic line from the cave hermit at the start of <em>The Legend\
  \ of Zelda</em>. \"It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.\" Cool. But how does taking\
  \ a sword address the fact that Link is still going alone? Sure, he has something\
  \ with which to fight the danger inherent in solo adventuring, but wouldn't it be\
  \ better for the old dude to also advise Link to take some friends along? That worked\
  \ really well for 15 core <em>Final Fantasy</em> games.* I'm just saying.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Well, when you venture into the <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"\
  ><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a> in May, I advise you to take allies in addition\
  \ to your swords, boomerangs, bombs, and whatnot. And when you build your expedition\
  \ party, you're going to need some miniatures to represent them. That's where today's\
  \ blog comes in!</p> \n    <p>What jungle expedition is complete without a ranger\
  \ to cut a path through the thick underbrush, to listen to the calls of nearby fauna\
  \ warning of pending danger, or to gauge the best time and place to make camp during\
  \ the annual monsoon, when the threat of flash flooding could ruin your much-needed\
  \ 8 hours of rest. Enter the human hunter, a Medium uncommon figure, and your savior\
  \ when you need a high roll on that next Survival check. Equipped with a ghillie\
  \ suit, soft leather boots, and a knocked arrow ready to let fly, the human hunter\
  \ won't make a sound as she blazes a trail to adventure at your side!</p> \n   \

  \    </div> \n    <p>\"But,\" you might inquire, \"what's our guide's final destination?\
  \ Where are we going?\" Why to find that lost <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkge?Dressing-on-the-Side\"\
  >magic anvil from the blog two weeks ago</a>, silly! And who better to accompany\
  \ such an expedition but the dwarf explorer? No one. There is no one better. If\
  \ you don't believe me, this curmudgeonly companion will remind you at every opportunity.\
  \ He's clearly planning on doing some spelunking, what with his rope and grappling\
  \ hook, but even aboveground he stands to be a stalwart ally with his short sword\
  \ and heavy crossbow. The dwarf explorer is a Medium rare figure.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-DwarfExplorer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-DwarfExplorer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Rounding out the party is some magical support—a companion\
  \ capable of deciphering ancient runes and dispelling arcane wards that protect\
  \ your prize from plunder. The human arcanist looks like he could hail from the\
  \ esteemed magical academy of the Magaambya deep in the heart of the Mwangi Jungle,\
  \ where acolytes of Old-Mage Jatembe still mix the traditions of arcane and druidic\
  \ magic to keep the forces of evil at bay. And if his magic fails, he can always\
  \ literally throw the book at his enemies. Look at that thing! It has to weigh 20\
  \ pounds! The human arcanist is a Medium rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180219-HumanArcanist_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>When the dangers of the deep jungle become too much for\
  \ even these capable adventurers to handle, they can always call upon the help of\
  \ outsiders (maybe that giant book is full of true names used for <i>planar binding</i>\
  \ and other summoning spells). But the arcanists of the Magaambya would never treat\
  \ with the likes of devils or demons. Only the forces of good are, well, good enough\
  \ for our magic warriors! The azata wilder, a CR 6 outsider capable of being summoned\
  \ via <i>summon monster V</i>, relishes the thrill of battle, and would be more\
  \ than happy to come to your aid. Since higher level variants of the spell could\
  \ result in as many as 1d4+1 of the azatas, this is a common figure, enabling you\
  \ to represent an entire host of Elysian archers on the battle mat. As a Medium\
  \ creature with distinct elven features, the figure can also serve as a player character\
  \ in a pinch—I could see this as an aasimar or a sorcerous elf arcane archer with\
  \ the celestial bloodline.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ creepy, crawly creatures from the dark places of the earth (and at least one outer\
  \ plane), as well as a thematically related piece of dungeon dressing! I look forward\
  \ to continuing the conversation with you then, friends!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
  \ <i>Franchise Manager</i></p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\">*Yes, I know there are like\
  \ fifty <em>Final Fantasy</em> games at this point. I said \"core\"—like with a\
  \ Roman numeral in its title. You don't get to out-pedant me, nerds.</p> \n   </div>\
