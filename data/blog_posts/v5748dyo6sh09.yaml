  \ and bon vivant? Checks out.</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Those of you who are\
  \ familiar with Varian, whether from the Pathfinder Society, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck\"\
  >Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk4h?A-Novel-Approach-to-Creating-the-Pathfinder\"\

  >Dave Gross’s novels featuring Varian,</a> will recognize that I might have, ahem,\
  \ stretched the truth a bit in that last paragraph. If that sounds interesting to\
  \ you, I can enthusiastically recommend any of those sources for more detail. For\
  \ now, I’m going to dig a bit deeper into the design of Varian as a PACG character.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>When the time came for us to put together a set of characters for Curse,\
  \ we knew that we’d want to play up the connection between the characters and the\
  \ city of Korvosa itself, so Varian went on the list early. In addition to being\
  \ a cool and familiar character that hadn’t yet appeared in an Adventure Path, he’\
  s a graduate of the Acadamae in Korvosa and he’s a noble with interesting connections\
  \ to Cheliax, Asmodeus, and Desna. The early drafts of his character wanted to establish\
  \ him as a wizard (mostly… more on that later), a bit of a fencer, and a well-connected\
  \ man-about-town.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianCardFront.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Back face of the Varian character card showing the Deck List for the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game.\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Dashing, debonair,\
  \ and potentially dangerous? Checks out.</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Varian’s\
  \ hardly a hulking, brutish sort (if that’s your thing, check his cohort Radovan),\
  \ so we didn’t want him to rely on Strength, but we still wanted him to be capable\
  \ in Melee. We were planning on pushing him toward Finesse-style weapons, so we\
  \ counted on being able to give him a skill to help. This ended up as Acrobatics:\
  \ Dexterity and Sword proficiency, which helps keep him true to Dave Gross’s original\
  \ concept without too much card-text overhead. This approach also made him a good\
  \ potential fit for—avoiding spoilers here—an option that comes up during the AP.\
  \ As a “gentleman of means and connections,” we gave him a power that adds a bonus\
  \ to efforts (his or others) wherever he could reasonably call on civilized aid.\
  \ This melded nicely with the new traits we’d added to locations. So Varian can\
  \ call for help in Urban locations, where his name, rank, manners, money, and/or\
  \ general confidence can be put to use. Naturally enough, this makes Varian want\
  \ to spend his time in those locations.</p> \n      <p>Since Varian is a wizard,\
  \ he has a strong Arcane skill, but with his particular take on wizardry, we wanted\
  \ him to feel distinct from Ezren or Darago during play. Since the Core Set was\
  \ moving away from “if you have the Arcane skill” toward proficiency as the method\
  \ to determine whether or not spells were used as if prepared from a book or as\
  \ one-shot scrolls, we could simply give him proficiency with Arcane to keep the\
  \ spells after using them. To create the “riffle scrolls” effect (see <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy8mfs\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea\
  \ Magic</i></a> for more details) that allows Varian to avoid the debilitating nausea\
  \ that besets him when casting spells, we gave him an unusual power: Unlike Seoni\
  \ who automatically succeeds at recharging Arcane spells, or Ezren who is very likely\
  \ to succeed, Varian automatically <i>fails</i>. This gets those boons into his\
  \ discard pile where his next character power lets him pull them to the bottom of\
  \ his deck.</p> \n      <p>Finally, we come to Varian’s fourth character power,\
  \ one that requires a feat. This power lets him draw some cards and then recharge\
  \ the same number of cards, so he stays at the same number of cards in hand, but\
  \ he gets to choose which he keeps and which he stores away for later. All by itself,\
  \ this filtering power is useful on both ends: it can help you get a key card that’\
  s hiding in your deck, and it can also let you save cards that are good but not\
  \ yet needed, or not safe sitting in your hand. This power is a bit more mechanical\
  \ than some others; to me, it generally represents Varian’s resourcefulness, and\
  \ it also combines with his riffle scrolls power to help him manage which spells\
  \ he wants now versus which spells he wants later. This gets us to the not-so-secret\
  \ direction that I wanted for Varian: deck control. It would take too long to explain,\
  \ so I’ll try to sum up. You see, it’s all Paizo’s fault. To be more specific: it’\
  s <i>PaizoCon’s</i> fault. </p> \n      <p>Late in the wee hours one PaizoCon night,\
  \ Keith and I were watching and playing an early Core playtest. Who did which has\
  \ been lost to sleeplessness, but what’s important here is that someone was playing\
  \ an Arcane caster, and they were playing it by <i>counting their deck</i>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Since the early days of PACG, we’ve seen people dedicate a lot of attention\
  \ to managing their deck. While most Divine casters tend to heal themselves to victory—\
  <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li9y?Pauls-Best-Character-Ever-Lini\"\
  >hi, Paul!</a>—other early characters like Valeros and Sajan also get in on the\
  \ recharging game, especially when combined with a little judicious deck thinning.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Deck thinning, for those who don’t already know, is the process of\
  \ specifically (and, hopefully, <i>carefully</i>) removing cards from your deck\
  \ so that it’s more likely to produce the cards you really want. Valeros can thin\
  \ his deck to his favorite weapons (or those most appropriate to the current scenario)\
  \ and then make repeated use of his power to recharge them. If Sajan can get rid\
  \ of his items and allies, then his deck is focused down to a big pile o’ blessings,\
  \ which he can recharge for big hits. The downside of this approach is the danger.\
  \ In addition to the utility of the specific cards you give up, you also have to\
  \ sacrifice your “hit point buffer” to get there. For example, when <i>Rise the\
  \ Runelords</i> Sajan’s deck is thinned down to his 10 blessings, he’s very strong\
  \ at combat checks, but if he’s forced to discard 4 of them to damage, suddenly\
  \ those boons he “got out of the way” would be very helpful to have around.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Even people who don’t push things quite so far can derive fun and benefit\
  \ from managing what cards they recharge and when. This sort of deck manipulation\
  \ is especially common among characters like Ezren and Seoni who cast a lot of spells,\
  \ and usually get to recharge them. What I saw that night/morning at PaizoCon was\
  \ someone who wasn’t just thinning their deck; they were working to set it up, ordering\
  \ and recharging cards to the bottom to try to plan their future draws, setting\
  \ themselves up to be ready for the future, for other people’s turns and their own.\
  \ While this sort of play isn’t for everyone, both that player and the rest of the\
  \ table seemed to be enjoying themselves. I always enjoy watching people really\
  \ get into the game, whether it be the story, characters, theme, mechanics, or anything\
  \ else. With Varian, I was trying to build a character for this sort of player.\
  \ For the person who shuffles their deck, draws their starting hand, and then proceeds\
  \ to exert order over the chaos of the game, choosing what to recharge, when, and\
  \ in what order. For the person that knows when they want to be healed, and especially\
  \ when they don’t want to be healed, because they know when the card they want is\
  \ coming up, and they don’t want you messing with their order. I’ll say it again:\
  \ it’s not for everyone, but in the right hands, it’s a beautiful thing.</p> \n\

  \ \n      <p>As Varian well knows, it’s always good to have friends. Also: companions,\
  \ suitors, contacts, servants, agents, employees, and factotums. In this case, Varian\
  \ has his personal “bodyguard” Radovan Virholt, and he’s quite lucky to do so. Radovan\
  \ will stick around Varian to protect him from harm, and while he’s around, the\
  \ two of them can be quite effective at solving “problems,” including problems you\
  \ might not expect to be solved by a gentleman fencer. When Radovan does have to\
  \ temporarily deal with a dangerous situation, Varian’s ability to draw and recharge\
  \ will help get Radovan back by Varian’s side.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ clubs are both better and worse than you’d expect.</p> \n      </div> \n     \
  \ <p>When Varian gains a role card, one option is to lean into his studies as an\
  \ Acadamae Graduate. This lets him get even more benefit “around town” from his\
  \ contacts that are interested in the Arcane arts. He can also filter cards to the\
  \ top or bottom of his deck for even more control. Finally, his time at the Acadamae\
  \ lets him call on his studies of magic and the Harrow, both to get out of unusual\
  \ situations (using Arcane instead of another skill), and also to dig deep for a\
  \ crucial spell in a moment of need.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ poison” isn’t always meant so literally.</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Varian’\
  s other option in <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne</i> leans into his political, diplomatic,\
  \ and noble connections, as well as his fencing studies *cough* <i>spoilers avoided</i>\
  \ *cough*. Always one to make friends and (try to) influence people, Varian can\
  \ now make even greater use of his allies, both their inherent abilities and for\
  \ “favors.” He can also get flashy with his rapier (or, I suppose, other, less <i>gentlemanly</i>\
  \ weapons) to good effect. One of the powers represents some lessons that we think\
  \ he might have picked up from his friend Radovan (I’ll bet you can guess which\
  \ one!), or perhaps just the influence of his officious dedication to his official\
  \ religion. Finally, neither last (on his role card) nor least (for my not-so-secret\
  \ intentions), his “resourcefulness” ability can be extended to a large degree,\
  \ especially late in the Adventure Path. Put another way, even if “deckmaster” isn’\
  t your thing, I’ll bet you can find ways to enjoy drawing essentially a second full\
  \ hand at the start of each turn, then putting a fistful of cards back for later,\
  \ and in the order you think you might want them.</p> \n      <p>For those of you\
  \ who might be looking to try out Varian for the first time, we’ve put together\
  \ a set of deck suggestions for Varian using cards from the <i>Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne Adventure Path</i>.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><b>Weapon</b>: Scimitar\
  \ </li>\n       <li><b>Spells</b>: Acid Burst, False Life, Infernal Healing, 2 others</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Item</b>: Spellbook, 2 others</li> \n       <li><b>Ally</b>: Acadamae\
  \ Student, 2 others</li> \n       <li><b>Blessing</b>: any 3</li> \n      </ul>\
  \ \n      <p>That’s it for now; I hope you enjoyed this look behind the curtain\
  \ at Varian. If you’d like more or less of this sort of thing, please do let us\
  \ know in the comments. Thanks!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
