  artist: "at least 1, the DC of that spell increases by +1 (total, not per level\
    \ increased). This means that if Seoni casts a still lightning bolt the DC to\
    \ halve the damage is increased to 21. Other bloodlines grant similar abilities.\
    \ For example, the destined bloodline grants the sorcerer a luck bonus on saving\
    \ throws for 1 round whenever she casts a spell with a range of personal. In addition\
    \ to the arcane bond ability (which allows Seoni to have a familiar), the arcane\
    \ bloodline grants two additional abilities. The first is metamagic adept, which\
    \ allows her to cast metamagic spells without increasing their casting time. At\
    \ her current level, she can use this ability twice per day. It should be noted\
    \ that quicken spell has been changed to allow sorcerers to use it without increasing\
    \ the casting time, meaning that Seoni can save her metamagic adept ability for\
    \ extended and still spells. The second ability is new arcana, which grants Seoni\
    \ an additional spell known (she chose stoneskin). If we were to continue to advance\
    \ Seoni, she would receive a school power at 15th level, which would grant her\
    \ a +2 bonus to the DC of all spells"
