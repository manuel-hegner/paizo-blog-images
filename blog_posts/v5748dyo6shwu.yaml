  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The manuscript that follows\
  \ is taken from but a single source, stored at Windsong Abbey. It is impossible\
  \ to verify the authorship of “Fafnheir’s Lament”; the book in which it is contained\
  \ also includes a bestiary and various tales of monster-hunting. If authentic, the\
  \ lament—written in Skald—must have been copied and recopied many times over its\
  \ ten-thousand-year history, potentially introducing scribal errors. Translation\
  \ was further complicated when a fire broke out at the abbey centuries ago; an anonymous\
  \ librarian saved the book, but not before the manuscript was singed along one edge.\
  \ The damage was not extensive, but enough to make many passages difficult to read\
  \ and some phrases entirely indecipherable. The edition presented here represents\
  \ the best efforts of the abbey’s staff.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"\

  \ I came, Fafnheir,<br> Burdened and brandishing the eggs of my brood.<br> Boldly\
  \ I’d taken the blood of my brother<br> And the price, my penance, was the exile’\
  s path.<br> Now on Golarion I gazed, greedily,<br> For glory and gold was mine to\
  \ gather.<br> From mountains where men rode upon mammoths <br> To the Obari Ocean,\
  \ none could oppose me.<br> Warriors and would-be kings both went<br> Groaning with\
  \ grief into my gullet.<br> I felt certain Fafnheir was fiercest,<br> First among\
  \ foes, now and forever.<br> That was good killing.</p> \n      <p>But fat on the\
  \ fear of fools, I forgot<br> The fickle future of fortune’s wheel.<br> For although\
  \ the life of a linnorm is long,<br> And time toughens us like an oaken tree,<br>\
  \ No royal or regent is allowed to rule<br> Longer than the law of cruel fate allows.<br>\
  \ Your might won’t matter, is what I am meaning,<br> When you gaze upon a god and\
  \ grasp<br> The golden age of your glory is gone.<br> Heed my history, and hew<br>\
  \ To the wisdom which I have won.<br> Listen to the lament of the first linnorm.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Millennia ago by mortal measure,<br> Veiled villains seeking vengeance<br>\
  \ Summoned the Starstone from the depths of space.<br> But Acavna of Azlant, bride\
  \ of Amaznen<br> Made a magnificent shield of the moon.<br> She shattered the Starstone\
  \ into shards<br> And some souls were spared.<br> But gone was the glory of ancient\
  \ Golarion,<br> And men became cowards crouching in caves.</p> \n      <p>Into this\
  \ apocalyptic air I ascended<br> To witness what wonder remained in the world.<br>\
  \ I sojourned south, taking the swan’s road,<br> And all that my eye encompassed\
  \ was empty.<br> Fewer folk than you have fingers<br> Lived in that lonely desolate\
  \ land.<br> But as I approached the antipodes by air<br> Stalwart survivors began\
  \ to be seen,<br> Sheltering in the shade of Mwangi’s shield.<br> Here were heroes\
  \ a linnorm could hunt,<br> So down I descended, hungry for dinner.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The trees were towering torches<br> Blazing below me, their light blinding.<br>\
  \ Under that kindling canopy were helpless kin-folk,<br> Mortal men and elves, Mualijae<br>\
  \ Caught in a barbarous burning. <br> Time had taught them the meaning of terror,<br>\
  \ For a dreadful dragon had chosen today<br> To descend and deal devastation.<br>\
  \ But the fear that filled them wasn’t for Fafnheir,<br> And my blood boiled as\
  \ I wondered what bastard<br> Had the craft and the courage to steal my kill.<br>\
  \ Then I drew near to dread Dahak,<br> Dealer of death and desolation.<br> Then\
  \ the father of linnorms felt fear<br> For the Age of Ashes had arrived.</p> \n\

  \ \n      <p>Dark is the day I first saw Dahak<br> Feasting on fools who howled\
  \ as they fled.<br> Spells and spears he shattered for sport,<br> Shields splintered,\
  \ they perished in shame.<br> Blades that breached him were, by his blood,<br> Melted\
  \ to mist like ice in a meadow.<br> A Mualijae maid raised her voice in mourning<br>\
  \ And the greedy one paused, engrossed by her grief.<br> She sang of centuries filled\
  \ with sorrow<br> How Starstone survivors became food for the slaughter.<br> But\
  \ the monster was unmoved by her music;<br> Sky swallowed the smoke.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Many are the deaths that delvers discover<br> When they dare their descent\
  \ into the depths:<br> A poisonous point in the depths of a pit,<br> Or their corpse\
  \ consumed by gelatinous cube,<br> Or reduced to dust, disintegrated,<br> Or by\
  \ the relentless reach of a mummy’s rot,<br> Their strength sapped as they’re turned\
  \ to stone<br> By the sudden stare of a medusa’s snakes,<br> Or mauled by a minotaur\
  \ lost in a maze,<br> Or by a bear with the brow of an owl disemboweled.</p> \n\
  \      <p>But lo, this litany now must be lengthened,<br> Expanding the examples\
  \ of exsanguination,<br> For dungeon delvers have new ways to die:<br> Caught and\
  \ cut by the dragon god’s claws<br> Or by his bite sent to the Great Beyond.<br>\
  \ A swipe of his tail scatters them stumbling,<br> Beaten by the buffet of his batlike\
  \ wings.<br> And finally flames hot as a furnace<br> Brightly furious forth from\
  \ him fly.<br> The fearful fools caught in that fire<br> Are fried in a flash by\
  \ that perilous flood.</p> \n      <p>Lament for the linnorm who has boasted his\
  \ last.<br> Long is his life, but brief is his legacy.<br> Shunted and shamed, by\
  \ Dahak overshadowed,<br> To caves in the crags Fafnheir will crawl.<br> From that\
  \ darkness I’ll dare not emerge. Day’s<br> Luminous light on the father of linnorms<br>\
  \ Shall not shine. And my shimmering scales<br> Will henceforth be hidden, this\
  \ for my hubris.<br> Wanderers into my web will be welcomed,<br> As I break my fast\
  \ on their brittle bone-house.<br> But never again by noon or night<br> Will I hunt\
  \ heroes, as was my habit.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p\

  \ the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for\
  \ interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy\
  \ of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered\
  \ as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked\
  \ Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the\
  \ gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of\
  \ these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts\
  \ may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to\
  \ the faithful to decide.</p> \n   </div> <!-- tags:  Web Fiction, Pathfinder, Pathfinder\
