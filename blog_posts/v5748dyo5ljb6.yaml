  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With the 2016 convention season wrapping up,\
  \ the team is already knee deep into planning the shows for 2017. If we are planning\
  \ Pathfinder Society activities, I know our players must soon start planning for\
  \ travel to Spring 2017 shows. Last week, tickets for PaizoCon (May 26-29) went\
  \ on sale. Unfortunately, a trip to Seattle is not in the cards for everyone. For\
  \ those Paizo fans on the other side of the Atlantic (or who fancy a trip to England),\
  \ fear not. June 2nd to the 4th, we are coming to you by way of the <a href=\"https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">UK Games Expo</a> in Birmingham, England.</p> \n     <p>While\
  \ there has been a Pathfinder Society presence at UK Games Expo for several years,\
  \ led by Venture-Captain Rob Silk and his enthusiastic venture-officer team, we\
  \ are turning up the dial for 2017. What's new? This year, Paizo and UK Games Expo\
  \ entered into a sponsorship agreement alongside other industry leaders such as\
  \ Mayfair, Hawk Wargames, CatanStudio, GeeknSon, Osprey Games, and Battlefield Hobbies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But what does this mean for convention attendees? Paizo will have a\
  \ booth in the Exhibition Hall where we plan to run demonstrations of some of our\
  \ games. Also, several Paizo staffers are attending and will split time between\
  \ being in the booth and participating in panels on a variety of game industry topics.\
  \ Pathfinder Society will be there, bigger and better than ever, running Year of\
  \ the Stolen Storm Roleplaying Guild scenarios, Season of Plundered Tombs Adventure\
  \ Card Guild scenarios, and perhaps a few other surprises! It also means a special\
  \ event scheduled for one night of the convention. I don't want to let the cat out\
  \ of the bag (yet!), but the pitch John made to the Pathfinder Society team left\
  \ me excited to see the final product.</p> \n     <p>So how do you attend UK Games\
  \ Expo? The <a href=\"https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">UK Games\
  \ Expo website</a> contains all the information you need to join us at this fantastic\
  \ show. The schedule of games and panels is still under construction and won't go\
  \ live until early 2017, but you can purchase entry tickets as of 1 December 2016.\
  \ For first-time attendees, the website hosts a fantastic guide with answers to\
  \ many questions. You can also sign up for the UK Games Expo newsletter, so you\
  \ don't miss out on any information leading up to the show. There are many ways\
  \ to get to UK Games Expo. My personal suggestion is to fly into London and take\
  \ a train out to Birmingham. This gives a chance to enjoy the lovely English countryside\
  \ before delving into three days of gaming excitement.</p> \n     <p>Besides the\
  \ general admission option, you could also consider attending as a volunteer for\
  \ the Pathfinder Society. There is nothing quite like running games in a convention\
  \ setting. Some of my favorite memories are from GMing <em>We Be Goblins</em> and\
  \ <em>We Be Goblins, Too!</em> at Gen Con 2013 and running around the Sagamore Ballroom\
  \ yelling \"Poog Best Goblin,\" only to hear \"Mogmurch Best Goblin\" from elsewhere\
  \ in the room. Venture-Captain Rob and his team need a multitude of GMs running\
  \ both Pathfinder Society scenarios and demo games throughout the event. The planning\
  \ team will put out a call closer to the event and I will make sure to repost the\
  \ request in the PFS blog so everyone can see and come help out!</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ am super stoked about the Paizo-UK Games Expo partnership. It is a fantastic showâ€”\
  one of the premier conventions in Europe. There's gaming of all sorts, as well as\
  \ shopping and panels. Something for everyone! So I encourage you to look at the\
  \ calendar, book the time off, and come hang out with the Paizo and Pathfinder crew\
  \ at UK Games Expo. See you the first weekend of June!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
