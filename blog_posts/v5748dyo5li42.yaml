  \ York Comic Con, where I have braved halls choked with cosplayers to bring you\
  \ another Friday preview! I had to escape from the terrible Cobra Clutch of Sgt.\
  \ Slaughter himself to bring today’s blog to you, so let’s make it a good one!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We all love monsters, right? And when it comes to miniatures, I’m a big\
  \ proponent of “bigger is better.” Lots of people, if presented with a time machine,\
  \ would go back to solve some prominent historical mystery, or to witness some great\
  \ achievement first hand. At this point what I would probably do is go back and\
  \ convince the earliest tabletop gaming figure companies to make their tin soldiers\
  \ just a little bit larger, so the gamers of future generations could get more detail\
  \ on their prepainted plastic miniatures.</p> \n    <p>I imagine those gamers would\
  \ be shocked by the idea of well-painted plastic figures of today’s quality, but\
  \ shame on them for living in the past. In retrospect it was a very poor choice.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So, since regular-scaled minis are so small, it’s really something to\
  \ get a larger creature, because they often have so many more details and personality.\
  \ Today’s previews are certainly expressive, well-sculpted monsters that benefit\
  \ from a larger presentation. I’ve seen all three in-hand at this point, and I’\
  m proud of all of them.</p> \n    <p>These figures are all in the forthcoming <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9er4?Pathfinder-Battles-Rusty-Dragon-Inn\"\
  >The Rusty Dragon Inn</a> set. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151009-Kirrix.jpg\"><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151009-Kirrix_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Kirrix, an enormous six-legged rat monstrosity\
  \ from the ratfolk section of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game Monster Codex</em></a>. When that art rolled in, I couldn’t resist\
  \ putting it on the fast track for miniature-dom. What a great match he makes for\
  \ our oversized Dire Rat from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8mq6?Pathfinder-Battles-Heroes-Monsters\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> or the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy91l0?Pathfinder-Battles-Skull-Shackles-Wererat\"\
  >Wererat</a> from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8xg6?Pathfinder-Battles-Skull-Shackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>. Rats are mainstays in dungeons, and I think\
  \ this beast has what it takes to be the pinnacle fight against a whole rat-based\
  \ faction. His mouth is huuuuge. The Kirrix is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151009-FleshGolem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151009-FleshGolem_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This imposing Flesh Golem will look very familiar to\
  \ players of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5s?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-44-Trial-of-the-Beast\"\
  >\"The Trial of the Beast\"</a>, the second adventure in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown\"\
  >Carrion Crown Adventure Path</a>, since the image comes directly from that volume’\
  s cover. I’ve never seen a better flesh golem illustration than that one, so into\
  \ the minis line he went. We’ve only got a few more “core” golems to go, and lots\
  \ more from the later Bestiaries after that. Very exciting! The Flesh Golem looms\
  \ over other figures, being an amalgamation of body parts from other similarly Large\
  \ creatures. Seeing this guy hit the table will definitely have your players reaching\
  \ for their torches and pitchforks. The Flesh Golem is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151009-SilverDragon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20151009-SilverDragon_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>There have been a lot of dragons hitting the prepainted\
  \ plastic market in recent years, so I’m not in quite the hurry that I once was\
  \ to cover all of the sizes of all of the basic dragons. That said, some of our\
  \ dragon designs, like Ben Wootten’s Silver Dragon, simply cry out to be made in\
  \ prepainted plastic, and who am I to resist their clarion call? They have breath\
  \ weapons, don’t you know? The Silver Dragon is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>That’s it for this week. Come on back next Friday with a look at more figures\
  \ from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9er4?Pathfinder-Battles-Rusty-Dragon-Inn\"\
  >The Rusty Dragon Inn</a>. I still have such sights to show you.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ then,</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <em>Publisher</em></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
