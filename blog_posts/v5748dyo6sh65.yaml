  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><b>OPM Musings</b><br>While\
  \ the past month brought lots of confusion and chaos to our lives, we’re grateful\
  \ to our communities for providing some safe harbor in the storm. A huge shout out\
  \ to the entire venture-officer team and the local GM crews who supported the FLGS\
  \ until they closed and then moved the games online. For those of you that haven’\
  t joined us in virtual, consider this an open invitation to do so! Come play, socialize,\
  \ and stay strong!</p> \n      <p>Also, a huge thank you from our team to the community\
  \ for their patience and understanding. As we scattered to the winds and socially\
  \ distanced ourselves, we found everything taking more time and more energy. From\
  \ getting remote offices set up to putting together this month’s scenario releases,\
  \ it all was a bit wonky. We thank our community for coming together, helping each\
  \ other, and supporting our hobby. You are awesome!</p> \n      <p>Unfortunately,\
  \ not all of our community avoided their encounter or rolled a success on their\
  \ fortitude save. We have several community members, and adjacent community members,\
  \ who are dealing with the disease. Please keep them in your thoughts! If you have\
  \ a bit of cash to spare, consider purchasing the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh62?Humble-Conquer-COVID19-Bundle\"\
  >Humble Conquer Covid-19 Bundle</a>, whose entire proceeds go to fighting Covid-19\
  \ and rescuing lives. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \  <h3>Sanctioning</h3> \n      <p>We have no sanctioning in the pipeline this month,\
  \ as the transition to work-from-home put some wrinkles in our plans.</p> \n   \
  \   <h3>Achievement Points</h3> \n      <p>This month, our tech team was forced\
  \ to shift focus for several weeks as they ensured we all had the equipment necessary\
  \ to work from home in the fact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we finish settling\
  \ into this new way of doing business, we are hopeful that their attention will\
  \ be able to move back to getting this system up and running.</p> \n      <h3>Campaign\
  \ Coins</h3> \n      <p>With no travel to conventions, we awarded no coins in the\
  \ past month. As conventions continue to cancel, alternative awarding methods will\
  \ be devised so we don’t have a prolonged gap in recognizing the communities’ volunteers.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Stars, Novas &amp; Glyphs</h3> \n      <p>The move to virtual games\
  \ slowed some of the GM achievement progress. Thus, we have no new five-nova or\
  \ five-star GMs this month.</p> \n      <p>Several of our community noted that they’\
  ve seen their stars/novas disappear in different parts of the forums. This is due\
  \ to our continual upgrade to the website and splitting of how the site accesses\
  \ data. We’d ask for our GMs not to worry. The data remains in the database and\
  \ we will re-hook in all the items as we get the new pages established.</p> \n \
  \     <h3>Venture-Officers</h3> \n      <p>Over the past month, one of our primary\
  \ tasks has been updating the venture officer rosters so that everybody has access\
  \ to the scenarios they need to run games. We are fast approaching the point where\
  \ the system will be fully updated! At this point, all but one region’s current\
  \ rostered venture-officers should have received emails. If you are volunteering\
  \ and have not received an email, please contact your regional venture-coordinator.\
  \ Their contact information appears <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/organized-play-regions/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> \n      <h3>Charity Boons</h3> \n      <p>Early\
  \ in the month, we sent out all outstanding charity boons to their respective owners.\
  \ Anybody whose information had been submitted should have received theirs by now!\
  \ If you have not, check with the convention’s event organizer and confirm they\
  \ submitted your info. If you aren’t sure who the organizer was, send an email to\
  \ <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> and we\
  \ will help you get records updated.</p> \n      <h3>Online Resources</h3> \n  \
  \    <p>In the face of the current pandemic, our online venture-officers have stepped\
  \ up and done a tremendous job of getting the rest of us up and running with online\
  \ play. Our VTT and PBP communities are now larger than ever! They’ve shared a number\
  \ of resources with all of us, as detailed in two blog posts last week. Here are\
  \ links to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5u?Guest-Blog-Online-Region-Resources-part-1\"\
  >part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5z\">part\
  \ 2</a> of the blog.</p> \n      <p>Be sure to check Warhorn, local meetups, and\
  \ other community pages for online games supported by local lodges.</p> \n     \
