  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n               <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The original, excellent,\
  \ and slightly too wordy PACG cleric.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>Because\
  \ it was our first Adventure Path, <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> was establishing\
  \ baselines both for iconic characters and also for character classes. Anyone who’\
  s played the Pathfinder RPG for a while knows that the cleric is a very versatile\
  \ class; to translate to the PACG, that meant giving Kyra both a d12 Wisdom and\
  \ a good Divine bonus, making her a very competent spellcaster. To distinguish her\
  \ from other primary spellcasters like Ezren, her cards list is more varied. In\
  \ practice, Kyra’s d12+2 can cast and recharge spells as effectively as Ezren, but\
  \ with 3 to 5 spells in her deck, she’s going to use a variety of methods to solve\
  \ problems, including skills, powers, and cards of all types.</p>\n            \
  \  <p>We also give her the original built-in healing power (thankfully, we were\
  \ eventually able to clarify the wording). In this case Kyra can spend her explorations\
  \ to heal someone (including herself) at her location. This became the fundamental\
  \ cleric-healing power, later used by several characters. While keeping healing\
  \ “local” seems obvious to people familiar with Pathfinder, in PACG it adds a subtle,\
  \ important effect: when people get low on “health” (cards in their deck), on their\
  \ turns, they come to Kyra for help. In practice, this often means negotiating where\
  \ they want to take their turns so that they can be in the right place—i.e. Kyra’\
  s—on her turn. Since Kyra has a large number of blessings in her deck, she can choose\
  \ when to use them to help herself, to help others, and also when they can allow\
  \ her to both heal vulnerable party members and still make progress exploring the\
  \ scenario. As players gain mastery with the game, they learn that it’s important\
  \ to figure out when to ask for help, and also how to not waste Kyra’s entire turn\
  \ keeping them alive—classic shorter-term to longer-term systems mastery.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Kyra is also especially good against Undead, as you might expect\
  \ from a devotee of the sun god. Her second power makes her better at defeating\
  \ Undead (with weapon, spell, or raw skill), and also helps her avoid nasty effects\
  \ from before- and after-acting powers. Adding the Magic trait is important for\
  \ dealing with Incorporeal Undead. Early in her adventuring career, this can be\
  \ especially helpful when big weapons fail to get rid of pernicious undead such\
  \ as Ghosts and Shadows. When she gets a role card, Kyra could choose to focus on\
  \ various aspects of Sarenrae as either a Healer, focusing on keeping everyone (including\
  \ herself) going, or an Exorcist, leaning more into the smashy-smitey side of things.</p>\n\
  \              <p>During <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we rested Kyra (be honest,\
  \ if you had to choose a character to “go piratical” for a bit, would you pick Kyra\
  \ over <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lg6s?Meet-the-Iconics-Oloch\"\
  >Oloch</a> or <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lcs8?Meet-the-Iconics-Feiya\"\
  >Feiya</a>? Neither did we.) The next version of Kyra was in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy97ia\"\
  ><em>Cleric Class Deck</em></a>, where she strikes a strong balance between martial\
  \ and magical. As such, her skills and powers are quite different.</p>\n       \
  \       <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/043020_ClericKyraFront.png\"\

  \ brand new sword flex.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>Class Deck Kyra\
  \ is notably better with weapons, especially Swords, while she’s still able to marshal\
  \ some potent divine impact. If you wanted to bring her into Skull &amp; Shackles,\
  \ she’s also pretty capable with navigation and swimming via her Survival skill.\
  \ Her healing power takes a small hit in flexibility, but clever players can usually\
  \ work around it. When she gains a role card, she can choose between Fireflower\
  \ and Wastelander. The former focuses on the more aggressive aspects of the Church\
  \ of the Dawnflower, while the latter helps Kyra and her companions get around in\
  \ the world.</p>\n              <p>When it came time to put together a group of\
  \ characters for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9a46\"><em>Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous</em></a>, we (okay, I) wanted Kyra to be involved in the adventure into\
  \ the Worldwound for two big reasons: one, I thought it was an excellent fit for\
  \ the character; and two, I wanted to try a new approach to healing. For facing\
  \ off against lots of demons, we built a Kyra who is expert at dealing with Undead\
  \ and Demons, and a master at wielding the Healing Flame. She’s still capable of\
  \ wading into melee with sword and armor, but she has a larger selection of spells\
  \ than previous versions.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     \

  \ into the demonic darkness.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>In this\
  \ incarnation, rather than spending her explorations healing people, Kyra instead\
  \ adds a small bit of healing to her divine channeling. This changes up the play\
  \ dynamics of groups facing a significant challenge, which is something that Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhm4?How-Hard-Should-it-Be-Adventure-Card-Game\"\
  >definitely can bring to the table</a>. People who were big fans of Kyra gave me\
  \ a pretty wide array of reactions at first, but as they gained more experience\
  \ with her, they usually found her to be effective and fun. When she gains a role\
  \ card, you can choose between Dawnflower’s Flare, which focuses on the offensive\
  \ power of divine fire, and Everlight’s Grace, which focuses on the healing and\
  \ protective elements of Sarenrae’s church.</p>\n              <p></p>\n       \
  \       <p>For the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7\"><em>PACG Core\
  \ Set</em></a>, we wanted to return to the “core” expression of the cleric. We adjusted\
  \ to some of the changes from the Second Edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game,\
  \ but also brought the things we’d learned from publishing roughly a dozen different\
  \ clerics for PACG (and at least twice that many “healer type” characters). We struck\
  \ a middle ground between her strongest and weakest melee prowess, alongside a very\
  \ strong divine spellcasting ability and a strong personality. Her built-in healing\
  \ power still requires that you be in the same place, for a small healing effect\
  \ that doesn’t consume your ability to progress through the scenario. If your situation\
  \ requires bigger healing effects, you can invest in boons that provide them.</p>\n\

  \ power against Outsiders and Undead, but this version can be used to help herself\
  \ and others, again reflecting a change in approach from Pathfinder. The other skills\
  \ that seemed especially appropriate were moved to a power feat, making them a player\
  \ choice. Her deck list is adjusted slightly, but still represents a fairly even\
  \ spread across all card types—Kyra has weapons and armor, spells and blessings,\
  \ and items and allies. (And introducing the terms “heal” and “local” let us slash\
