  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted miniatures is getting closer and closer, and\
  \ I've still got such sights to show you! This week I want to focus on previews\
  \ of three figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>\
  \ set!</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>\
  \ is loosely themed around the types of characters and creatures you might find\
  \ in a tavern in the Pathfinder world. That's meant a fair number of \"NPC types\"\
  \ as well as urban adversaries. This week we've got a nice mix of both creature\
  \ types.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-VampireSpawn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-VampireSpawn_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the Vampire Spawn, a sort of lesser\
  \ vampire created by a real vampire as a servitor. Stats for Vampire Spawn appear\
  \ on page 271 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>.\
  \ These nighttime creatures make for a chilling urban ambush, so we've put the Vampire\
  \ Spawn at the common rarity to make sure your vampire villains can build up a whole\
  \ gang of them. The Vampire Spawn is a Medium figure. It's also the final common\
  \ figure of the set. From this point forward, everything I reveal will be either\
  \ uncommon or rare.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-Aristocrat.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-Aristocrat_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I'll probably never get sick of miniatures of rich people\
  \ in nice clothes, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon's</em></a>\
  \ Aristocrat is the latest to come down the line. The Aristocrat's fine staff makes\
  \ him a good proxy for a wizard or cleric, and I think his style runs the line between\
  \ good and evil, making him an excellent option of a stylish hero or villain. The\
  \ Aristocrat is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-GhoulMonarch.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-GhoulMonarch_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the insidious Ghoul Monarch, from page 87 of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a>. This\
  \ CR 12 beast was originally slated at rare due to his high degree of challenge\
  \ at the table, but in production we realized that his simple design and relatively\
  \ basic paint scheme would be better at uncommon, leaving the rare figures for truly\
  \ unique or challenging sculpts. I think that works fine. While three of these guys\
  \ on your table might not make sense as “monarchs,” they work great for any kind\
  \ of spellcasting ghoul adversary. The Ghoul Monarch is a Medium figure.</p> \n\
  \    <p>That's it for this week. Swing by this space in seven days for another look\
  \ at more minis from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>!</p>\
