  \ \n   <p>Torchlight glimmered a pleasing peridot color through the alchemical soup\
  \ that ran through the tunnels of the Crypt of Water. The queen's husband, Hakotep,\
  \ took great pleasure in the elaborately cruel designs that protected his great\
  \ flying tomb. Richly painted in scenes of the River Sphinx and guarded by mighty\
  \ hydrodaemon marble statues, the crypt was a stately home to rest one's soul for\
  \ eternity.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6036-ThySkyPharaoh.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>The queen resents your weapons and armors. A lot.</p>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>Queen Neferuset glided along the passages in a glass barge, disabling\
  \ the many traps without a thought. A thousand times she had made this journey;\
  \ her hands moved of their own accord with practiced grace. Ingenious in their design,\
  \ the hidden traps that lined the opulent tomb had been their creators' last. A\
  \ short career was the price of eternal honor in the service of the pharaoh. Behind,\
  \ her sister's mournful wails echoed and shrieked with the sound of a human soul\
  \ breaking. The queen had insisted her sister's souls be captured within his pyramid.\
  \ The pharaoh assumed it some form of punishment for Nailah's betrayal and attempted\
  \ coup. But no. The banshee was necessary to serve the weaving of the Dark Tapestry.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Visits to Nailah were always painful. Her sister's wails summoned forth\
  \ festering memories of family and sunshine. But the queen's gods demanded pain\
  \ in sacrifice. Death and thousands of years within this tomb had left Neferuset\
  \ hollow. She fed them what scraps of soul she could scrape together. Her gods were\
  \ hungry.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6036-Nailah.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6036-Nailah_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>Seelah, meet Sehela. Seleha, meet... wait, where did you go?</p>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>The glass barge bumped against a wall as it entered the vast\
  \ limestone Hall of the Crocodile Kings. Sehela, the engineer who designed the pyramid's\
  \ vast propulsion mechanisms, stood there waiting, silent and ethereal. Tracks of\
  \ ghostly tears shimmered on the old woman's face, her brow knit with a pained scowl.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The queen took her time gracefully stepping out of the glass barge. Sehela\
  \ would wait to be acknowledged before speaking. What had once been decorum had\
  \ been replaced by a habit of fear. Sehela remained silent and stared. With a word,\
  \ the withered, ectoplasmic remains of the old engineer's heart could be sacrificed\
  \ to the Void. As long as Sehela was useful, she would remain in bondage, cursed\
  \ to watch over the machine of destruction she had given her life to build.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Queen Neferuset passed by the old ghost, gesturing her to follow with\
  \ a wave of her cobra-headed staff. The gesture was small, but the authority the\
  \ staff represented was deeply threatening; the ghost shuffled dutifully behind\
  \ through many twisting passages, overseen by the ancient lords bedecked in their\
  \ sacrificial wrappings. The curtain of chill and darkness that hung within the\
  \ entry to the shrine stunned Sehela, causing her to stumble backward, her ethereal\
  \ form wavering uncontrollably. The queen caught Sehela's wrist in a cold, hard\
  \ grip that pulsed with overwhelming necromantic power.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>We did not forget to include a mummy wearing a mask.</p>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>The ghost shook with terror as the queen dragged her, helpless before\
  \ the altar. Neferuset's chanting echoed with a deep malice that made the black\
  \ stone of the altar quiver. One by one, the necromancer poured out the still-juicy\
  \ contents of canopic jars: a victim of the queen's nastier spells.</p> \n   <p>As\
  \ the viscera slid across the stone's surface, whispered voices joined the queen's\
  \ from the dark corners of the room. The hushed rain of language hovered at the\
  \ edge of comprehension. Utterly alien, yet familiar in a way that made Sehela's\
  \ soul yearn for release, yearn to join them in the darkness. So long the work.\
  \ So long the journey through the skies. So long.</p> \n   <p>And then, the ritual\
  \ was over. The queen turned to the silent ghost and raised a withered, inquisitive\
  \ eyebrow. \"It's all over,\" Sehela sighed. \"The word of Ra is spoken. The elemental\
  \ channels are shut off. The pyramid is falling.\"</p> \n   <p>Tears streamed down\
  \ the engineer's face anew. The admission that her life and death's work was now\
  \ over was too much to bear. Queen Neferuset produced a small glass bottle engraved\
  \ with the symbol of death from her elegant sleeve, uncorked it, and caught the\
  \ tears that hung from the ghost's chin. \"And with this,\" the queen grinned wickedly,\
  \ \"we shall prepare for new sacrifices to come to us.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"\
