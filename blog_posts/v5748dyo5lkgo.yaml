  description\">Time flies when your having fun planning conventions! Seems like just\
  \ yesterday when I put January's update blog together. This month brings a refresh\
  \ of the Regional Support program, a new 5-star GM, and more conventions for our\
  \ community to enjoy!</p> \n    <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n    <p>While at MarsCon\
  \ in Williamsburg, Massachusetes, I had the distinct pleasure of awarding Campaign\
  \ Service Coins to three long-time volunteers. Each of these individuals held a\
  \ venture-officer position, as well as spent time and effort in their local regions\
  \ growing the Society and their RPG communities. They received their coin as well\
  \ as a new organized play number in recognition of their service.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>#784—Joe Mathos<br> #785—Paul Reese<br> #786—Mike McKeown</p> \n   \
  \ </blockquote> \n    <p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please\
  \ email me at organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, location, and the reasons\
  \ you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please\
  \ include what events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they\
  \ will be at an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down\
  \ the blog for that list of events.)</p> \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> \n    <p>This\
  \ month we only have one new addition to the 5-star GM roster. They earned the accolade\
  \ earlier, but communication errors kept them from being listed in prior blogs.\
  \ My apologies on the delay and huge congratulations on achieving your fifth star.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least\
  \ 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game\
  \ for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars\
  \ is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy\
  \ you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Paul Trani</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Last\
  \ month, the team solicited feedback from the community on what requirements should\
  \ exist for a Starfinder Society 5-nova GM. I've compiled the responses and will\
  \ discuss the issue with the rest of the org play team over the next few weeks.\
  \ Once determined, we will include the information in a future update blog.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Conventions</h2> \n    <p>First quarter 2018 contains many conventions\
  \ for player's enjoyment. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type\
  \ of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you\
  \ are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact\
  \ the local venture-officer for more information! If you know of a convention running\
  \ Society games that is not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me\
  \ at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event.</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block\

  \ \n    <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> \n    <p>The PaizoCon organizing team and\
  \ I are finalizing the PaizoCon 2018 organized play schedule, working on processing\
  \ the volunteer questionnaires, and sending out status emails to all individuals\
  \ that completed the form. Gen Con organizing team is sending out the first batch\
  \ of acceptance emails this week, so volunteers know their status before the housing\
  \ lottery opens on Sunday. We have confirmed with Gen Con that GM badges do not\
  \ qualify for the housing lottery, so if you are wanting a room but not qualifying\
  \ for one through the Society, I encourage you to pick up your badge asap! The Origins\
  \ organizing team and I are working on the event schedule and are preparing to post\
  \ the general Call for Volunteers blog in the next week.</p> \n    <h2>2018 Organized\
  \ Play Staff Travel</h2> \n    <p>Last month, I added a column to the convention\
  \ list to show which events the organized play team planned on attending. While\
  \ helpful, it didn't allow for much pre-planning, since event support requests submissions\
  \ tend to be 1-2 months before the event. So this month, I've pulled together a\
  \ list of all events in 2018 that will have an organized play staff presence. A\
  \ few are listed as TBD and there may be some changes, as who attends depends on\
  \ workloads and availability, but this is our currently planned itinerary.</p> \n\
  \    <p>If you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event in\
  \ 2019, drop an email to organizedplay@paizo.com before next summer. We review our\
  \ schedule in the fall and try to get all decisions wrapped by the end of the year.</p>\
