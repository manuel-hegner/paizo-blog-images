  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">With the 40th anniversary\
  \ of Dungeons and Dragons hitting in the past week, it has made me wax nostalgic\
  \ for the tales of my gaming past. Thinking back to the beginning, to my first D&amp;D\
  \ game, it is amazing to see what an impact it has made on my life.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>I grew up the typical brainiac nerd. Each day, I would come home from school\
  \ and curl up with a science fiction or fantasy novel. Piers Anthony, Stephen R.\
  \ Donaldson, Fritz Lieber, Michael Moorcock, Jack Vance, Roger Zelazny, Robert E.\
  \ Howard, Anne McCaffrey and more told their tales of daring and adventure and I\
  \ was hooked. Reading was a solitary hobby that fit well with my shy persona.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That all changed when I stumbled upon a very simple video game called\
  \ Akalabeth. It was written by Richard Garriott (better known to most as Lord British)\
  \ and involved a very simple interface where you would travel into dungeons, kill\
  \ things, and take their treasure. I was hooked! I didn’t have my own computer back\
  \ in 1980, but the folks at Computer World in Appleton, Wisconsin were more than\
  \ happy to let me come to their store after school and play Akalabeth.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>In the fall of 1981, I was off to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota\
  \ to get my bachelors in biology. Right away, I went into withdrawal from my daily\
  \ Akalabeth fix. I put up some posters around the cafeteria hoping that somebody\
  \ might have a computer with Akalabeth on it. I never got a bite on that, but a\
  \ guy let me know that he was starting a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and I was\
  \ invited to give it a try. Now, I had no idea what Dungeons &amp; Dragons was,\
  \ but I figured it probably had something to do with a computer, so I was interested\
  \ in giving it a try. Imagine my surprise when I showed up at the designated dorm\
  \ room and there were six other people there!</p> \n    <p>I had a bit of apprehension—\
  what did I get myself into? But I fought down my fears and sat down as the guy who\
  \ invited me explained that we were going to be playing this game called Dungeons\
  \ &amp; Dragons. As he talked, I became more and more fascinated. We were going\
  \ to be telling a story together as a group. There were all these weird shaped dice\
  \ and painted metal miniatures. I couldn’t tell you any details about the adventure\
  \ that night. The GM never ran a second session. But I was hooked and told my mother\
  \ about this new game I had discovered. That Christmas, I was given my very own\
  \ D&amp;D intro box which I devoured like a sailor dying of thirst. I also received\
  \ two boxes of Grenadier miniatures, one of characters and one of monsters, which\
  \ I painted over my Christmas break.</p> \n    <p>By the time I got back to St.\
  \ Olaf, I was ready to GM a game. I was desperate to do so. Me, the shy bookworm\
  \ nerd, was eager to reach out to people I hardly knew and take on the role of the\
  \ director of a game, the narrator of a story. I was ready to become a leader!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>My first regular gaming group was a couple of friends. We played Keep\
  \ on the Borderlands, because that was the adventure that came with the Beginner’\
  s box set that my mother had bought me for Christmas. Now, Keep was meant to train\
  \ new DMs by encouraging them to add their own encounters and expand the adventure.\
  \ I took the map of the area surrounding the keep and the Caves of Chaos, and made\
  \ a more detailed map that included my own first dungeon, a ruined castle on a nearby\
  \ river. Attached is my first ever dungeon map. I tried to make things as realistic\
  \ as I could, but there are so many problems with my map, that it makes me laugh\
  \ now to look at it. But I was just an eager new DM with a couple of eager players,\
  \ and we had a blast in that first dungeon!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>There were just a few players in my first\
  \ campaign, so I did double duty. I DMed the campaign, but I also played a character\
  \ in the campaign, the Fighter/MU Erwyle. Attached is his character sheet from the\
  \ end of his career. A couple of notes: the character sheet is one that I made up\
  \ on the school’s UNIX computers, and Erwyle’s possessions and magic-items aren’\
  t on the sheet because they took up a print off that was seven pages long! Erwyle\
  \ never made it beyond the first campaign except as an NPC, but I’ll never forget\
  \ those first adventures. I even got superstar artist Clyde Caldwell to draw a picture\
  \ of Erwyle for me at my first GenCon!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20140208_Erwyle.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20140208_Erwyle_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>It wasn’t belong before the group had grown\
  \ to six and we set out to tell tales of adventure across the world of Greyhawk.\
  \ We met every Friday and Saturday night, playing well into the night, and sometimes\
  \ into the next morning! The Slaver Series, Against the Giants, Descent into the\
  \ Depths, the Temple of Elemental Evil, Against the Cult of the Reptile God, the\
  \ Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, the Sinister Secret of Saltmarch, the Secret of Bone\
  \ Hill, and many, many others tested the wits of my players over the course of the\
  \ next six years. Players came and went as some graduated and new players joined,\
  \ but the core of my players stayed the same. It was a heady time for me as the\
  \ campaign became the thing of legends among gamers at St. Olaf and I had a long\
  \ waiting list to get into the campaign. Life-long friendships were formed and memories\
  \ were made that shall never be forgotten.</p> \n    <p>It all came to an end when\
  \ I was asked to join my first gaming company, Lion Rampant games in 1987. But it\
  \ was those early years exploring the World of Greyhawk and learning to be a great\
  \ DM that really helped me the most as I began a career that would go from Lion\
  \ Rampant, to White Wolf, to Wizards of the Coast, and now to Paizo.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ couple of years back, something happened that was a first for me. I lost one of\
  \ my original players, Dar Lund. It hit me hard at the time and I didn’t want to\
  \ have to deal with the loss of somebody who shared those heady early days with\
  \ me. Dar was one of the chefs at St. Olaf College and it was through one of my\
  \ players, Rob, that Dar was introduced to me. I’ll never forget his first character,\
  \ Roy P. Zabblapper III, the first born son of a vagabond scribe (yeah, I was using\
  \ the character background charts from Dragon Magazine). Zabber (as he was affectionately\
  \ known) was also knicknamed the Dwarven Blender, because of his two-handed, Hasted\
  \ fighting style that left more than one monster beaten to a pulp. If the plot dragged\
  \ too much during the game, Dar would look at me and blurt out, \"Zabber heads through\
  \ the door.\" He got himself into more than one pickle that the rest of the party\
  \ had to bail him out of by doing this, but it only added to the legend. Dar played\
  \ in my campaign until I left Minnesota in 1988. He was a player I could count on\
  \ to be there rain or shine, with his trusty dice at hand, along with his dragon-shaped\
  \ ashtray. When I spent two years deciding where my life was going to go, Dar and\
  \ his new wife, Betsy, allowed me to sleep on their couch, running D&amp;D games\
  \ whenever I could get four players together.</p> \n    <p>To my friend Dar I raise\
  \ a glass of Velunan Fireamber Wine—to days of adventure and friendship that will\
  \ never be forgotten! </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20140208_DarLund.jpg\"\
