  \ Lost Gygax Novel</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 24, 2008</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Ever since we started, there's been a question as to whether or not Planet\
  \ Stories would begin publishing original fiction—and if so, when. After all, one\
  \ of the structural foundations of the line to date is that we publish not just\
  \ great sci-fi and fantasy, but <i>important</i> sci-fi and fantasy. How can you\
  \ possibly know ahead of time that a new work of fiction is going to be culturally\
  \ significant?</p> \n    <p>Turns out, sometimes that question is easier to answer\
  \ than you think. When we set out to create Planet Stories, some of the first books\
  \ we signed were the three Setne Inhetep books by Gary Gygax, <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80bn\"\
  >The Anubis Murders</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdq\">The Samarkand\
  \ Solution</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\">Death in Delhi</a></i>.\
  \ Publisher Erik Mona had always enjoyed Gygax's Gord the Rogue stories (one of\
  \ which we've now republished in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\">Worlds\
  \ of Their Own</a></i>), and we felt that it was important to kick things off with\
  \ Gygax, considering that, after Tolkien, he's probably had the most pervasive effect\
  \ on modern fantasy of any author. If you stop to think about it, that's an enormous\
  \ claim, but it's true—how many books in the fantasy section of your bookstore (or\
  \ on your shelf at home) have their roots in Dungeons &amp; Dragons? Certainly it\
  \ was Gygax's work that had the biggest influence on all of us, and that put us\
  \ in a position to one day start a fiction line of our own. And as Gary's health\
  \ declined and interests had of late turned away from writing fiction, we believed\
  \ that <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\">Death in Delhi</a></i>, the last\
  \ Gygax book to be published, would be his final literary legacy.</p> \n    <p>That\
  \ is, until a year ago, when Erik called Gygax to see if he might perhaps have some\
  \ unpublished short fiction sitting around that we could slip into an anthology\
  \ somewhere. Obligingly, Gary dug around in his files, then came back and said that\
  \ he did indeed have a few short stories—but he'd also discovered a complete unpublished\
  \ novel he'd forgotten about, set in the same world as the Setne Inhetep books but\
  \ far from Ægypt and starring completely new characters. Apparently TSR had turned\
  \ it down for being too similar to Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar books (despite the fact\
  \ that Leiber's son saw no problem with the manuscript), and the whole experience\
  \ so frustrated Gary that he mothballed the novel completely. Would we, he asked,\
  \ perhaps be interested in publishing it?</p> \n    <p>Needless to say, we leapt\
  \ on the opportunity. Called <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hs\">Infernal\
  \ Sorceress</a></i> and introducing the characters of Ferret and Raker, the book\
  \ is Gygax at his finest, chock-full of swashbuckling action, intricate magic, and\
  \ strange monsters. And unlike Setne Inhetep, whose razor-sharp mind generally sees\
  \ him on top of any given situation, this book's protagonists are more like Gord—\
  smart and capable, but never quite to the extent that they think they are, always\
  \ running from the situations their quick blades and loose morals get them into.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Written just after <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\">Death\
  \ in Delhi</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hs\">Infernal Sorceress</a></i>\
  \ is the true last Gygax novel in every sense, making it both the culmination of\
  \ a life's worth of writing and the final adventure from the man who taught the\
  \ world not just how to make believe, but that it was <i>okay</i> to do so. That,\
  \ in fact, we should never have stopped. And that, more than anything, makes it\
  \ an honor to be publishing this book.</p> \n    <p>How do you know an original\
  \ novel will become important to an entire genre?</p> \n    <p>Sometimes it just\
  \ starts out that way. </p> \n    <p> James Sutter <br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
