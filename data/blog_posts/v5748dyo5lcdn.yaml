  \ Society Organized Play Part XVIII: Ensure the Decemvirate doesn't take advantage\
  \ of Pathfinder agents.</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 18, 2011</p> \n\
  \    <p><i> For decades, a growing segment of the Pathfinder Society's membership\
  \ has become disillusioned with the Decemvirate. Whether they hold personal grudges\
  \ against the masked leaders of the Society for slights they feel were never remedied\
  \ or watched too many of their friends suffer for the good of a Society that seemed\
  \ to thank them very little, these rebels' numbers have surged in recent years,\
  \ swelling the Shadow Lodge's membership. In 4710 AR, several fringe cells of the\
  \ underground resistance movement broke off from the main body of the Shadow Lodge,\
  \ and began a series of open attacks on the Grand Lodge and those loyal to it. The\
  \ Decemvirate, recognizing that there was a real problem to be addressed, quelled\
  \ the rebellion by bringing the Shadow Lodge back into the fold, acquiescing to\
  \ some of their demands, and sending strike forces to hunt down and eliminate remaining\
  \ cells of radical Shadow Lodge agents. Many still feel the Decemvirate has further\
  \ to go to remedy the injustices carried out in the Society's name, though they\
  \ are glad to be in good standing with the Society once againâ€”even if many also\
  \ believe they were brought back into the Grand Lodge so the Ten could keep a closer\
  \ eye on them.</i></p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <div align=\"right\"> \n    <table\

  \   <blockquote> \n    <p> Well, folks, here we are. Just over two weeks left before\
  \ Gen Con and only two Pathfinder Society Season 3 preview blogs left before the\
  \ Year of the Ruby Phoenix kicks off. That means we're up to the last of the 10\
  \ factions from which players may choose their PCs' allegiance. Since the Year of\
  \ the Shadow Lodge began, a not-insignificant portion of the players in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society campaign have asked, \"How do I join the Shadow Lodge?\" In two weeks,\
  \ they can do so easily.</p> \n    <p>The Shadow Lodge began as a clear villain\
  \ organization who wanted to use the Pathfinder Society's resources for their own\
  \ gain. But over time, as more and more people expressed dissatisfaction with how\
  \ the Decemvirate treated the body of their organization, the more we at campaign\
  \ HQ started to wonder ourselves what the implication would be to have PCs working\
  \ for the Shadow Lodge.</p> \n    <p>In the end, we realized that the villains the\
  \ Shadow Lodge represented would need to evolve to better fit the campaign. Luckily\
  \ for us, we made this decision in plenty of time to get that evolution to take\
  \ place over the course of Season 2 such that now, looking back on the Year of the\
  \ Shadow Lodge, someone can follow the metaplot and watch how the organization went\
  \ from evil mustache-twirling villains to Pathfinders with legitimate complaints\
  \ against their leadership. By Season 2's conclusion, those playing all the scenarios\
  \ over the course of the season can see that some of the Shadow Lodge's agents were\
  \ too easily manipulated and misguided by influential members of the group into\
  \ initiating open hostility with the Grand Lodge in hopes of destabilizing it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now, however, everything's been smoothed over, at least for the most\
  \ part. Both the Shadow Lodge and the Decemvirate have a way to go before they trust\
  \ one another fully, and both sides now must follow through on their ends of the\
  \ bargain. As the first sign of the Society's willingness to do so, a new service\
  \ has been added to those which may be purchased with Prestige. Beginning in Season\
  \ 3, a PC may pay 5 PP to have her body recovered by a rescue team. This means you\
  \ no longer have to worry about being left in a sealed tomb or abandoned on another\
  \ plane of existence. As long as your body still exists (meaning no <i>disintegration</i>),\
  \ you can get out!</p> \n    <p>Members of the Shadow Lodge, for their part, must\
  \ now help the Pathfinders quell any remaining rebel cells that may exist throughout\
  \ the Inner Sea region, including any featured in Season 2 scenarios that a new\
  \ player or someone catching up on missed scenarios may play a year or two down\
  \ the line.</p> \n    <p>So there you have it: the 10 factions available for play\
  \ in Season 3 of Pathfinder Society Organized Play! Next week, we'll take a look\
  \ at the revised <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i> and go over a\
  \ few of the more notable rules changes or clarifications you can expect to find\
  \ within. See ya next Monday!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n  \
