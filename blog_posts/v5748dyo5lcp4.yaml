  \ \n   <p>One of the results of an early-August Gen Con and a Pathfinder Society\
  \ release schedule based on putting out material at the end of the month is that\
  \ it always seems like an eternity between when a new season of Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play kicks off in Indianapolis and the next set of scenarios comes out\
  \ at the end of September. But the wait is over and Season 3 continues with two\
  \ exciting new adventures, released last week.</p> \n   <p>As we mentioned in the\
  \ store blog last Wednesday, both of this month’s scenarios include elements from\
  \ past scenarios—in this case from the very first season of the campaign! One of\
  \ my goals as developer on the Pathfinder Society Scenarios line has always been\
  \ to give a larger sense of continuity within the campaign. Now that we’re into\
  \ the first full season that I mapped out from square one, it was the perfect opportunity\
  \ to start implementing some of this.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a\

  \    <br> Brand new threats from <span class=\"blurbi\">Bestiary 3</span> are sure\
  \ to torment poor, unfortunate souls in two new Pathfinder Society Scenarios.\n\

  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3—05: Tide of Twilight</i></a>, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society sends the PCs on a mission resulting from research into a relic attained\
  \ way back in <a href=\"/store/byCompany/p/paizoPublishingLLC/pathfinder/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season0/v5748btpy88sx\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #23: Tide of Morning</i></a> from June 2009. While\
  \ the two scenarios can be played in either order and the ties between them are\
  \ loose, players and GMs who played <i>Tide of Morning</i> at PaizoCon two years\
  \ ago will recognize some thematic elements and subtle allusions to the early scenario.\
  \ And who knows, if folks like this spiritual sequel style, more missions may come\
  \ about as a result of the information gleaned from the <i>lorestone</i> of the\
  \ Verduran Forest next season.</p> \n   <p>Going back even farther, <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season3/v5748btpy8lqw\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3—06: Song of the Sea Witch</i></a> features a\
  \ prominent NPC from the very first scenario ever, and one of the most popular scenarios\
  \ to date, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/p/paizoPublishingLLC/pathfinder/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season0/v5748btpy84k0\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1: Silent Tide</i></a>. In <i>Silent Tide</i>,\
  \ the PCs spent much of the adventure working to undo the effects of hapless historian\
  \ Yargos Gill’s meddling in things beyond his understanding, and yep, you guessed\
  \ it; Yargos is at it again. Players from a certain faction who saved Yargos from\
  \ his first adventure with the Pathfinder Society will also note that the effects\
  \ of their actions have impacted the storyline, and their fulfilled faction mission\
  \ from Silent Tide speaks to their new faction mission in <i>Song of the Sea Witch</i>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I’m eager to hear what folks think of these homages, both what you think\
  \ worked well, and what could make the campaign’s internal continuity even stronger.\
  \ Further, what NPCs, locations, magic items, or dangling plot threads would you\
  \ like to see woven back into the Pathfinder Society tapestry in scenarios to come?\
  \ Comment below!</p> \n   <p>Next week, Campaign Coordinator Mike Brock has some\
  \ exciting announcements to make about the organization’s growing army of volunteer\
  \ coordinators. </p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
