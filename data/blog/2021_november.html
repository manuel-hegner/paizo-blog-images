               <blockquote>
                <p itemprop="description">Over the last six weeks, Paizo's Leadership Team has attempted to better listen to and understand the challenges faced by its workforce, customers, and community. We want to take a moment to update you on a few important developments that have emerged from those conversations.</p>
                <p>Before we begin, it's important to note that this update does not address requests regarding salaries, adjustments to the current work-from-home environment, or other matters that are now subject to negotiation with the United Paizo Workers union during collective bargaining.</p>
                <p>We’re still searching diligently for a candidate to fill the company’s Human Resources Manager position, and plan to begin interviews very shortly. As this is an incredibly important hire, we want to make sure we find the right candidate with experience leading initiatives related to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) and working with a union. We are continuing to gather resumes as the search continues.</p>
                <p>We’ve hired a company called <a href="https://www.energage.com/" target="_blank">Energage</a> to complete an employee engagement survey on behalf of Paizo. This survey is designed to allow employees to provide anonymous, unfiltered, and honest feedback to the company that will help Paizo establish priorities for improvement planning. It will also serve as an important benchmark against which to measure the results of future surveys, allowing us to develop a baseline to measure against. We expect employees to be able to access the engagement survey sometime this week.</p>
                <p>Discussion in the past several months has resurfaced two instances in which a Paizo executive mishandled user data when replying to message board posts, resulting in allegations of doxxing. These actions were contrary to Paizo policy, and corrective actions were taken to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>
                <p>“This was a huge mistake on my part and I am deeply sorry for any issues that have arisen from these actions. This was not the right way to treat our customers and I apologize,” said Paizo President Jeff Alvarez. “As President, I know I need to hold myself to a higher standard.”</p>
                <p>Paizo takes issues related to discrimination and harassment very seriously. We have hired the law firm of <a href="https://www.moritthock.com/" target="_blank">Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff</a> (MH&amp;H) to investigate allegations of discrimination against trans employees and sexual misconduct before reporting back to the Leadership Team. Investigators from the firm will reach out to members of Paizo’s staff and others that made claims on social media. Cooperation with the firm is voluntary, of course, but we remain committed to investigating these matters thoroughly to ensure a safe and respectful workplace.</p>
                <p>We chose MH&amp;H upon the recommendation of a consultant with expertise in matters of DEIB. MH&amp;H has a team of attorneys that specialize in these issues, and we’re confident they’ll be able to provide an impartial analysis of the facts that we need to move forward with any corrective actions.</p>
                <p>Because the results of these investigations are private personnel matters, Paizo will not be able to make them public. Corrective actions will be taken against any employee (including managers and executives) found to be guilty of these allegations.</p>
                <p>It has never been Paizo’s intention to discriminate against any employee when making decisions of who to send to industry trade shows, but we see now that our room-sharing policy was based on outdated interpretations of gender, was not friendly to transgender employees, and could contribute to a perception of transphobia at the company. Paizo’s Leadership Team acknowledges the pain this caused, and we understand that we need to be better at recognizing issues where such decisions could have unintended results. We also recognize that such actions do not align with Paizo's core values, the values of its staff members, or the sentiments of diversity and inclusion expressed in Paizo products, and as such, have disappointed, angered, and confused members of our community. We believe these mistakes are not representative of who we are, or what we want the company to represent. We need to do better... and we will.</p>
                <p>“As the person in charge of trade shows, I want to apologize to anyone that felt marginalized as a result of the convention decision-making process,” said Jeff Alvarez. “It was not our intent to discriminate against anyone, and I’m sorry.”</p>
                <p>As previously communicated, Paizo has adopted a one-employee-per-room travel policy moving forward. Regardless of gender identity, couples will be allowed to share rooms during travel as long as both parties request it.</p>
                <p>Paizo remains committed to maintaining a diverse, safe, and fun workplace where our employees are treated fairly and look forward to creating awesome Pathfinder and Starfinder products for many years to come. We hope that this update helps communicate that we, the Leadership Team, are doing our best to listen to and address the concerns of our community members. We believe in creating a better Paizo, and believe that transparency, communication, and accountability will be instrumental as we move forward. Thank you for your continued support of our company and our products.</p>

                <p>Take heed, Pathfinders! Court is in session, and the Pathfinder Society itself is on trial! Recently, the Church of Iomedae in Almas, the capital of Andoran, made a legal claim against the Society’s lodge. The Almas Cathedral, once a Cathedral of Aroden, came into Venture-Captain Brackett’s possession during an especially tumultuous time for the church of Aroden, but he insists that his claim to the building is legitimate. Unfortunately, it seems the People’s Council has begun to question whether the Society’s prominence in the city is more trouble than it’s worth. The Pathfinders will need to be at their best if they’re going to sway the Council, as the Church of Iomedae has sent a formidable representative to make their case.</p>
                <p>With the chilling events of the recent East Hill haunting behind them, the Pathfinders should finally be able to focus their full attention on the legal case.</p>
                <p>Surely nothing else bad will happen before the trial.</p>
                <p>Or during the trial.</p>
                <p>Surely not.</p>

                <h3>Michael Sayre, Paizo Designer (he/him)</h3>
                <p>Growing up, my grandpa’s Tlingit stories showed me how storytelling works as a vehicle for culture and values (and how it’s a great way to pass the time waiting for the fish to bite!) Those stories of kushtaka and little men in the woods excited me, and I remember hanging on my grandpa’s every word, realizing how his cadences and storytelling devices had been passed to my uncles, who would use the same rhythm even for different stories, which were all so hypnotic and mesmerizing. I remember the elders at the rec center and other events who would tell stories I’d never heard before but which were still so familiar.</p>
                <p>Stories of Raven helped me contextualize the cleverness and skill of Tlingit elders and leaders in a modern environment, and I’d only continue to discover the value and power of some of those stories as I grew older. Stories about Bear (both ally and obstacle) helped me realize how strong people can be when I thought that people, especially me, were just weak and flawed. All of those stories and experiences helped make me realize that I wanted to tell stories of my own. Gunalchèesh ax eet yeelatûowu.</p>
                <p>Taking the first steps to telling those stories never would have happened without the support of Goldbelt, our tribal corporation, that assisted me on numerous occasions with education and health care related issues that would have forced different life choices if I’d had to navigate them without a corporation representing a rich tapestry of communities supporting me. What I am, all the Tlingit &amp; Haida people of southeast Alaska helped me be.</p>

                <h3>Jessica Catalan, Paizo Developer (she/her)</h3>
                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Catalan (she/her), and I’m a Canadian, Métis freelancer author and Starfinder Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. This year, Canada held its first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, an annual commemoration honoring the children who died while attending residential schools and the survivors, families, and communities still affected by the legacy of the residential school system. While this is a step forward for us, reconciliation without action is just words and there is much to be done. I’ll spare you the newscast.</p>
                <p>I’m not much of a speaker, but as many of us have realized over the past two years, while one voice can be silenced, together we are strong, and we can be heard. So, in addition to raising my voice and lending my support to Every Child Matters, MMIWG2S, and other movements here in Canada, I can take two concrete steps I’d like to mention today: reclamation and amplification.</p>
                <p>Today, I’m here to amplify. I encourage you to look at the other names on this blog—check out their works, support them on ko-fi or patreon, back and purchase their projects, follow them on social media. Hear them. Keep an eye out for other Indigenous works, such as <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em>, and support the people involved. And if you’re an Indigenous TTRPG author who loves Starfinder and is struggling to have your voice heard, reach out to me. I’m listening.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Carlos Cabrera, Paizo Contributor (he/him)</h3>
                <p>Hi there, my name is Carlos Cabrera. I am mixed, but I identify as Mexican, Indigenous (Mescalero Apache), and Cape Verde (Portuguese and African). At first, I was going to write something for both Hispanic Heritage Month and Native American Heritage Month, but when I started looking into my family history—closer than I ever have before—I had to take some time for myself. The facts were not very pretty, and history was not kind to my family as early as either grandparent on my father’s side.</p>
                <p>I also grew up in a white household. My mother's family comes from a variety of European countries, and even a little Cherokee as history also likes to dictate. There are other idiosyncrasies there as well, but I recognize that my upbringing comes with a certain amount of privilege. Earlier this year, I wrote to the Mescalero Apache Reservation to see if my family had any affiliation. My relief when I discovered they were not was short-lived. The facts of how my family avoided that were not any prettier.</p>
                <p>I think that is why I pledged a copy of the <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em> RPG to the reservation and continue to write to this day. I hope it inspires someone to either get into games or go on their own grand adventure, even if they don't have the luxury of walking out their front door like I did. Maybe one day I can even pay them. I think that would be my American Dream.</p>

                <h3>Shay Snow, Paizo Editor (they/them)</h3>
                <p>Kúha’ahat, táy:sha’! I’m Shay Snow and I’m mixed Native American. My family stems from two separate tribes—my mother’s tribe is Caddo and my father’s tribe is Swampy Cree. Both tribes have strong matriarchal ties, so when introducing myself I lead with my mother’s tribe and then follow-up with my father’s tribe. I can’t speak on being just a Native TTRPG creator, but I can speak on being a Caddo and Swampy Cree creator.</p>
                <p>Being a Caddo creator means crafting your words carefully, knowing that your language is dying. Being a Caddo creator means trying to take all of the nuance of your language, the humor, the care, the cadence that warms your heart and makes you want to move when it’s spoken, and trying to put it into a language that your family was forced to adopt and speak. Being a Caddo creator means trying to find rhythm and when you can’t find it, forcing that rhythm into your work so that hopefully your words make other people want to move and dance.</p>
                <p>Being a Swampy Cree creator means moving slowly through the minefield that is your history and trying to pluck the safe bits out so that your heritage doesn’t accidentally cause you pain. Being a Swampy Cree creator means knowing that some parts of your culture have been taken and commodified and it’s now on your shoulders to look at those spirits and offer your respect as you try to carefully tell their stories without causing danger or harm.</p>
                <p>Being a Native creator in 2021 has meant creating and crafting with careful words and tools while also being painfully aware of everything pouring into the news and media over the past year. It means writing and trying to bring joy while burning sweetgrass and mourning over loved ones lost recently and loved ones lost long ago and recently found.</p>
                <p>My name is Shay Snow, I live on unceded Caddo and Wichita land, and my family calls me Little Jay.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>To all members of our community with indigenous heritage: thank you for all you do as creators, GMs, players, and people.</b></p>

(Pregenerated characters for this adventure are also available as a <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/PZOSF1002E+The+Great+Grav+Train+Robbery+Pregens.pdf">free download</a>.) If players create their own characters, they can use the adventure background to customize their characters to the adventure. This adventure can be easily used on virtual tabletops, run off digital devices, or printed out and played at a table.</p>
                <p><em>Author: Andrew White</em><br>
                  Andrew White (he/him) is the lead front-end developer on paizo.com and a Pathfinder and Starfinder freelance contributor who has written for projects including the Advanced Player's Guide, Bestiary 3, Secrets of Magic, Guns &amp; Gears, Tech Revolution, Drift Crisis, and Book of the Dead. He also recently wrote a piece of web fiction about a bunch of goblins heroically burning down a village with assistance from a giant pig. He has a Twitter where he mostly just retweets his more eloquent colleagues at <a href="https://twitter.com/plaguecontrol">@plaguecontrol</a>.</p>
                <h2>About the Pregenerated Characters</h2>
                <p>The boss recruited a ragtag band of miscreants for this job, all of them active players in Pan’s criminal underworld for some time. They consider themselves independent contractors and are already familiar with each other by reputation, if not by personal experience. While each has their own reasons for taking up a life of crime, they all share one thing in common: animosity toward the Ixo Syndicate, which means the opportunity to rob them is almost as tempting as the payday.</p><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/86b7da87-5041-46c3-8b9f-332e98285483/PZOSF1002E_TheGreatGravTrainRobberyAdventure.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/86b7da87-5041-46c3-8b9f-332e98285483/PZOSF1002E_TheGreatGravTrainRobberyAdventure.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Starfinder Adventure The Great Grav Train Robbery: 4 characters repel down to the top of a train in the dark of the night"></a>

                <p>Thurston Hillman hails from the frozen hinterlands of Winnipeg, Manitoba, where he constantly churns out words and runs tabletop games.

Thurston has written countless products for Paizo and other companies as a freelance writer. He is the Gamemaster for the popular "Warhams" TTRPG comedy show on Twitch. You can find him on social media @oncallgm and over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/oncallgm">twitch.tv/oncallgm</a> where he sometimes streams his RPG sessions and talks about game design and narrative in games. Also, he apologizes for any Organized Play scenarios he developed that killed your character (seriously, he means it!)</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Starfinders! Earlier this year we announced that Fame would be going away, and this naturally prompted a number of questions. We’ve combed through the ensuing discussions and we’re here today to present answers! Many of these will be added to the Starfinder Society FAQ pages or other locations as appropriate, but I wanted to consolidate them all in one place as a reference.</p>
                <h3>Conversion of Fame to AcP</h3>
                <p>Let’s start with the big one. When we announced this transition, we promised we’d get a way to convert your unspent fame to Achievement Points.</p>
                <p>We’re not doing that.</p>
                <p>Instead, we are outright stealing adopting what I refer to as “The HMM Proposal.” <b>Every Starfinder session played prior to May 31, 2021 will retroactively award 2 Achievement Points to both players and GMs.</b> This is the simplest way to handle this, as well as the fairest. It prevents headaches, having to dig out old Chronicle Sheets, and look, it’s just a really clean system, why mess with a great idea?</p>
                <p>Yes, it technically rewards the players who spent all their Fame, but those players are also our most invested players. Personally, I’m cool with them getting a little extra.</p>
                <p>These points should be awarded no later than <b>next Friday, the 12th</b>. If you notice old SFS sessions that aren’t awarding Achievement Points after that, please email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com and I’ll take a look!</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg" width="75%" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="The Starfinder Society fights off deadly robots on top of a speeding train"></a>

                <br>
                <h2>Other General Questions</h2>
                <h3>Changing Quest Pack Reporting</h3>
                <p>One weird wrinkle we came across was because quest packs can be completed across multiple sessions, a player could end up with more Achievement Points than anticipated. As a result, I’m going to add some extra reporting options for Starfinder Quests.</p>
                <p>If you complete all four parts of a quest pack in one session, reporting won’t change for that. However, if you only complete some of the quests, you will now be able to report each segment individually and it will award the correct amount of Achievement Points. Again, this will be in place by next Friday; there’s no need to retroactively correct old sessions, but if you see any issues, email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com!</p>
                <h3>Unapplied Fame</h3>
                <p>Any Fame that has been earned but not yet applied (e.g., from an Adventure or playing a pregen at a higher level) must be applied and spent by December 31. As Fame cannot be spent after that date, any unapplied and unspent Fame will be lost.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Boon-Specific Questions</h2>
                <p>In addition to general questions, there were a few questions that came up about specific boons that required Fame to function. Be aware there are some scenario spoilers in this section!</p>
                <h3>Inequity in Faction Boons</h3>
                <p>Currently, some Factions have more boons available for purchase in the online boon store than others; in particular, the Second Seeker factions are a little light. It is our intention to fill in the gaps in the matrix as the developers have time to create new boons.</p>
                <h3>Starfinder of Note</h3>
                <p>The Starfinder of Note boon has not yet been added to the Achievement Points system. At this time, we will not be adding the boon back, simply because we do not currently have any definite plans to use the submissions in future products. If and when we decide to bring back fan submissions (e.g., if we need a new First Seeker or similar), we’ll look at bringing back the boon. Any past submissions are still on file, and should the boon make a return, those submissions will also be considered.</p>
                <h3>Instructor Boon (Luwazi Elsebo/Ehu Hadif)</h3>
                <p>The current text of the Instructor boon for Ehu Hadif in the Achievement Points system is as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">You dedicate some of your time off to training an up-and-coming Starfinder recruit. This boon represents time spent outside of adventuring that you’re taking to train a potential new Starfinder. At the end of every adventure you have this boon slotted, record the total amount of Reputation you earned with the Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif). You can expend your Downtime at the end of an adventure to increase the boxes marked off for this boon by 1. Once you have accrued 40 marked boxes with this boon, your student has come into their own and is ready to become a full-fledged Starfinder (a new character). Have your GM mark the Chronicle Sheet where you accomplished this, and keep a copy of this boon with your new character. When your new character reaches 5th level, instead of choosing four ability scores to increase, you can choose five. Otherwise you follow all other rules for leveling up. This bonus applies only at 5th level.</p>
                 <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Special: You can apply this boon only to one new character, and only once the objectives have been completed.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The same text should be used for the Luwazi Elsebo iteration going forward.</p>
                <h3>Lone Agent</h3>
                <p>The Lone Agent boon was a convention reward that allowed you to convert Reputation earned into an immediate discount on a Fame boon purchase. After December 31, 2021, <b>this boon will no longer function</b>. We tried to keep the list of boons that outright would not work small, and in this case converting it would require a full rewrite. Our apologies to Lone Agent fans.</p>
                <h3>SFS 1-01: The Commencement</h3>
                <p>Change the text of the Faction’s Friend boon to the following:</p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">By assisting various factions of the Starfinder Society, you have proven yourself as a dependable asset. By slotting this boon, if you would fail to earn Reputation at the end of an adventure by failing to fulfill a success condition, you can check one of the boxes on this boon. Doing so reminds your current championed faction of your past exploits, and you still earn 1 Reputation with that faction as if you had successfully fulfilled the condition. You can use this boon only if you would also gain at least 1 XP for completing the adventure.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>SFS 1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!</h3>
                <p>Change the Scoured Stars Memorial boon’s text to the following:</p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Thanks to your efforts on Songbird Station, the Starfinder Society earned immense publicity from the Strawberry Machine Cake concert. Organizations and people across the Pact Worlds now go out of their way to assist the Starfinder Society. You can check the box next to this boon to do one of the following:</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li style="font-family:'Courier New'">Ignore the Achievement Point cost of having your body recovered.</li>
                  <li style="font-family:'Courier New'">Ignore the Achievement Point cost of purchasing the Starship Towing boon.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Checking this box does not require purchase of the relevant boon via the Achievement Points system.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>SFS 1-38: The Many Minds of Historia</h3>
                <p>The Steadfast Protector boon will be added to the Chronicle Boons section of the online boon store. It will require completion of SFS 1-38, as well as Tier 3 Reputation (25+ Reputation) with the Exo-Guardians and will cost 8 Achievement Points. The version listed on this Chronicle Sheet will cease to be purchasable as of December 31, 2021, though its benefits may still be used by characters that have already spent the required Fame.</p>
                <h3>SFS 2-16: A Scoured Home</h3>
                <p>Change the last sentence of the Nuclear Tools boon to the following:</p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">If you are not an izalguun, you may perform the same upgrade by spending an additional 10% of the cost of the upgrade (1,650 UPBs) to work with an izalguun Starfinder.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>We hope this answers all the outstanding questions about the transition away from Fame for Starfinder Society! If you have any questions about these changes or any other topics we missed, please let us know in the comments.</p>
                <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And go spend your new Achievement Points!</p>

                <h2>OPC Musings</h2>
                <p itemprop="description">By the time you read this, I will have returned from my first physical convention as a Paizo employee! I’ll be flying to Minneapolis with Tonya to attend SkålCon and I’m very excited about it. I’m writing this blog before the trip, so I don’t have any stories to tell, but ask future Alex (which, again, will be present Alex once you read this) about it!</p>
                <p>Back when I was hired, which the calendar insists was only 20 months ago, I expected to be traveling a lot more than I have so far. I will admit the introverted, awkward part of me (that’s all of me) is glad I met the community online, where I’m much funnier and able to log off when I need to. Still, there’s something about physical gaming that I’ve missed, the energy is different online (but the prep’s a lot easier, so it’s a trade-off)!</p>
                <p>Hopefully in 2022 I’ll be able to attend more shows and meet more people in-person, but I suspect the landscape has changed in ways we can’t expect. Until then, I look forward to more online games with all of you!</p>
                <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available November 19, 2021:</p>
                <h3>Pathfinder</h3>
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ako?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-305-Inheritors-Rite">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-05: Inheritor's Rite*</a><br><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al0?Pathfinder-Bounty-16-Boom-Town-Betrayal">Pathfinder Bounty #16: Boom Town Betrayal</a></p>
                <h3>Starfinder</h3>
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-411-A-Worlds-Ambition">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-11: A World's Ambition*</a></p>
                <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p>
                <h2>Starfinder Society Fame Updates</h2>
                <p>Earlier this year, we announced that Starfinder Society would be transitioning to the Achievement Points system, and that Fame would be disappearing. This sparked several questions to which we promised answers.</p>
                <p>Good news, I have answers for you! But you’ll have to wait a little longer for them. There’s a second blog scheduled later today that’s dedicated entirely to that topic, to keep everything in one place. So, hang tight and we’ll circle back to this topic later!</p>
                <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
                <p>First, the bad news: I have no new rulebook content to share with you at this time. I know everybody is eager to get their hands on guns, gears, and everything for sale in the Grand Bazaar, but we simply haven’t had the time to take a look at it yet. It’s the top of our priority list once the schedule crunch lets up, we promise.</p>
                <p>Now, while we don’t have rules content for you, we do have some newly sanctioned adventures! For Pathfinder (second edition), <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027o0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Night-of-the-Gray-Death"><em>Night of the Gray Death</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02anr/discuss?Pathfinder-OneShot-3-Head-Shot-the-Rot"><em>Head-Shot the Rot</em></a> are both sanctioned for play. You can find the sanctioning documents on their product pages. For Starfinder, we’ll have the next one-shot, <em>The Great Grav-Train Robbery</em>, sanctioned by the time it releases.</p>
                <p>And finally, for our Pathfinder (first edition) players, the <a href="https://paizo.com/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> is now sanctioned for play! We know it’s been a long time coming; we tried to get it out at the same time the Owlcat game released, but the best laid plans of ysoki and men, etc, etc. The chronicles for this AP can be applied to a character of <em>any</em> level as well!</p>
                <p>My goal is that by this time next month, we’ll have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em></a> sanctioned... just in time for the December releases! Hooray!</p>
                <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                <p>This month, we had one GM reach their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition) and one reach their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p>
                <p><b>5th Star</b>: Jason Thuel<br><b>5th Nova</b> Stephan V</p>
                <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p>
                <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2>
                <p>Winter tends to be our quiet time for conventions, but that doesn’t mean our schedule is entirely silent! We’ve still got plenty of great events, both online and in-person. Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">conventions calendar</a> for a full list and be sure to click on the events for more details.</p>
                <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                <p>“With me stepping back from day-to-day operations of Paizo, it’s been important for me to find leaders that can guide the company into the future,” said Lisa Stevens, CEO of Paizo.</p><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/49c324b4-bb97-488a-b544-fa3f481bf885/Jims%20Dragon%20-%20Jim%20Butler.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/49c324b4-bb97-488a-b544-fa3f481bf885/Jims%20Dragon%20-%20Jim%20Butler.jpg" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" align="left" width="300" alt="Jim Butler with a grey plush dragon on his shoulder"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                <p>Jim Butler began working in the industry as an editor and game designer for TSR, eventually moving to Seattle with Wizards of the Coast where he worked alongside Lisa Stevens on the brand team for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Jim founded Bastion Press before working for Turbine/WB Games on Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online. He then worked for Trion Worlds as Director of Global Marketing for RIFT and other MMOs.He completed the circle in 2017 when he returned to Seattle to work for Paizo as Vice President of Marketing and Licensing. He lives in Redmond with his husband Matthew and their furkids (Toker, Stella, and Skylar).</p>
                <p>“I’m excited to bring my experiences and expertise to help shape the future of Paizo,” said Jim Butler. “Gaming is an integral part of my life, and I’m looking forward to working with the rest of the leadership team to grow the Pathfinder and Starfinder brands for many years to come!”</p>

                <p>Mike Webb has been a role player since 1980, and made his living in the industry since 1997, when he joined Zocchi Distributing as Vice President and General Manager. In 2000, he joined the crew of Alliance Game Distributors as Vice President of Customer Service and Marketing, where he led innovative and national award winning in-store promotions and marketing programs. He has been active in the community, serving 14 years on the Game Manufacturers Association Board of Directors, and running miniature games and rpgs at local and nationwide conventions.

                <p>"I've long found Paizo to epitomize what's great about our business. Bringing people to the table to tell epic stories together, providing truly mythic campaigns and Adventure Paths, and providing GMs and players tools that expand that experience - these are the things that made me a fan,” said Mike Webb, Vice President of Sales and E-Commerce. “Having the chance to join a team I've admired for years is the opportunity of a lifetime.”</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Nhalmika Ironsight ran through the fresh snow. It wasn’t that much snow—it wouldn’t reach higher than mid-shin on a human—but it was higher than Nhalmika’s knees. And there’s a big difference, she now knew, between running through snow below your knees and running through snow above them. But she nevertheless ran on, hefting her scattergun to keep it free of moisture that might foul the firing mechanism. Most humans would find the large gun to be far too heavy, but Nhalmika carried it with practiced ease. So perhaps there was a fair tradeoff somehow.</p>

It wasn’t that much snow—it wouldn’t reach higher than mid-shin on a human—but it was higher than Nhalmika’s knees. And there’s a big difference, she now knew, between running through snow below your knees and running through snow above them. But she nevertheless ran on, hefting her scattergun to keep it free of moisture that might foul the firing mechanism. Most humans would find the large gun to be far too heavy, but Nhalmika carried it with practiced ease. So perhaps there was a fair tradeoff somehow.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, she’d come into the village of Ivlanton to the sound of cheers. The village was deep in Irrisen, the land of perpetual winter. Frostbite and privation were as omnipresent as the snow. Ivlanton sorely needed blankets, firewood, and medicine.</p>
                <p>A caravan master in Lod had sent a cartload of these goods to Ivlanton. When it didn’t return, he asked Nhalmika to investigate. At first, the master had praised Nhalmika’s son, an upright merchant with whom he’d done business, but Nhalmika wouldn’t venture deeper into Irrisen on familial pride alone. The master then offered a generous payment, but Nhalmika still refused. She was from the far south, and this wintry land was unfamiliar to her. She’d intended to move on quickly to warmer Varisia. But when the master talked about the difficulties the villagers would face if the goods hadn’t reached them, Nhalmika agreed to go. She couldn’t let innocent people suffer just because she didn’t like snow. She took the offered coin, too, and spent it on a hand-pulled wagon with still more blankets and medicine. If she couldn’t find the missing goods, she didn’t want to reach Ivlanton empty-handed.</p>
                <p>It turned out she needn’t have worried. She found the cart a few miles from Ivlanton, pulled off the road. Anyone else might have missed it, but the dead teamster’s baldric buckle gleamed in the deep shadows of the snowy hedge, bright as a beacon to Nhalmika’s keen eyes. The horses were nowhere to be seen. She saw that bandits had plainly pawed through the wagon, but they’d left the blankets and firewood behind. “Disappointed in their mundane haul, no doubt,” she muttered. Nhalmika prepared a hasty cairn for the unfortunate teamster and doubled up the load in her wagon to bring the lot to Ivlanton.</p>
                <p>The villagers were pleased, to be sure, but the village seer, an elderly and kind woman named Gerthanna, told Nhalmika that something had been stolen from the wagon after all: a small, magical flask that produced an endless stream of fresh water. In a land where water froze solid all year round, ready access to fresh water was vital.</p>
                <p>“I know bandits,” Nhalmika said assuredly, “and I know how to put them into the dirt…that is, the snow, I suppose,” she finished with faltering confidence. She paused to consider, but only for a moment. “I’ll go after them, and I’ll bring back your magic flask.”</p>
                <p>Nhalmika backtracked to the ransacked cart to look for tracks. Amid her own boot prints and the hoofprints of the departed horses, she discovered several heavy footprints, each a cross between an animal’s paw and an unshod human foot. Snowfall largely concealed the tracks, but Nhalmika was a little disappointed in herself to have missed them the first time. Even good eyes get old, she thought.</p>
                <p>The tracks led away from the trail and up a nearby hill. That’s where she found the remains of the horses, brutally torn to pieces. Clearly, something had feasted on great chunks of their meat. “Well, at least a well-fed enemy is a sluggish enemy,” Nhalmika mused, following the tracks as the hills led into a series of steep canyons. They looked like the box canyons of home: winding, dangerous, and the perfect place for an ambush. She readied her scattergun and shifted her cloak to access her powder and shot more easily. Then she stopped to think.</p>
                <p>The paw-footed bandits entered this canyon but didn’t leave it. That meant they’d either gone to hide inside or they were waiting in ambush. Either way, she could get a better look from above. Nhalmika scrambled up the canyon wall and made her way around its lip, crouching low</p>
                <p>Near the end of the box canyon, Nhalmika spied an elaborate ice sculpture, resembling a cresting wave with spines like icicles jutting every which way. It looked like some sort of symbol, but one that twisted away from her scrutiny as if she weren’t welcome to understand it. She recognized it as a fiendish rune—and a powerful one at that—wrought entirely from ice. An open metal flask resting atop the sculpture spouted a stream of water that quickly froze to slush and then to ice.</p>
                <p>Six hulking bandits worked around the ice sculpture, shaping the water as it froze to form the enormous rune. At first, Nhalmika thought they were dressed in ragged hides, but she soon observed that the patchy hides grew from their skin and claws sprouted from their hands and bare feet. They wore nothing other than blood-stained rags. The burly animal people were working with a definite purpose, and fear struck somewhere deep in Nhalmika’s soul.</p>
                <p>A low growl behind her made Nhalmika gasp in surprise. She’d been so focused on the rune-shaping bandits that she’d forgotten her earliest training: “a vanguard must look in all directions at once.” She glanced behind her.</p>
                <p>An enormous bear glared at Nhalmika from only a dozen yards away. Yet it wasn’t the bear’s hostile stare or aggressive posture that drew her gaze. The bear wore a harness of iron chains supporting a massive mirror atop its back. The mirror stood upright, reflecting Nhalmika’s puzzled expression as she perched at the canyon’s edge.</p>
                <p>“I am never going to understand Irrisen,” Nhalmika sighed as she swung her scattergun around to point at the bear. Before she could scare the bear off, the mirror blazed with bright inner light. The light coalesced into a beam of energy that lanced out toward Nhalmika. She sidestepped the blast, but the mirror immediately started to glow again, as though preparing for another beam. The bear howled in anger, and the roar was answered by the bandits in the chasm. Even as distracted as they were, they couldn’t have missed the bright beam.</p>
                <p>“Well, you shot first. My turn now.” Nhalmika fired at the bear’s head. Her shot might as well have struck stone. The bear hardly flinched, then took two paces, closing in on her. Nhalmika’s hands worked automatically as the scattergun recoiled, loading another round as she used the gun’s momentum to swing it back around in an arc to fire again. The bear ignored the second hit, and its mirror glowed even brighter. While her practiced fingers reloaded again, Nhalmika glanced around for options.</p>
                <p>“That flashy weapon’s the trouble, my furry friend. I can’t let you keep it.” She fired her third round at the mirror, expecting an explosion of glass and metal, but the shot rebounded from the mirror’s surface without a scratch. The scattergun was growing hot in Nhalmika’s hands, but she smoothly loaded it once again.</p>
                <p>“I guess this is hurting me more than it’s hurting you. I don’t have any more time for this.” Nhalmika aimed her scattergun at the snow and leapt from the top of the cliff. She pulled the trigger and the recoil propelled her even higher. Another energy blast shot across the snow where she’d been only a second ago. She had to admit the bear’s aim was good. Especially for a bear.</p>

                <p>Nhalmika could see the beast bandits looking up at her. She reached the top of her arc and descended into the canyon. Her trajectory was taking her down to the wicked ice sculpture, where its prongs and spikes would impale her before she ever got close to the howling bandits’ claws. She swung her scattergun around as she fell and pulled the trigger.</p>
                <p>For a split second, she wasn’t certain she’d reloaded after launching herself from the cliff. But her fingers knew their work and had reloaded in mid-air without any conscious direction. The round exploded from the barrel and slammed into the sculpture, shattering the frozen rune into a spray of icicles. Nhalmika reached out and snatched the flask as she completed her fall.</p>
                <p>The bandits were bloodied from the ice fragments but didn’t seem to notice in their rage. Nhalmika could now see their faces up close, and she wished she couldn’t; they were twisted masses of animalistic snouts and snaggled teeth beneath hate-filled red eyes. Nhalmika hit the snow, rolled, and sprung to her feet. Having survived the fall, she had to grudgingly admit that maybe snow was good for something after all.</p>
                <p>Seriously outnumbered and worried she’d see that strange energy-mirror bear lean over the canyon rim, Nhalmika ran. Her legs pumped furiously, but the snow was too deep for her to traverse quickly. Her benevolent thoughts toward snow only a few moments ago evaporated quickly and entirely.</p>
                <p>The bandits—being significantly taller than she was—were having much less trouble. They roared and howled as they ran after her, closing in as Nhalmika reached the opening to the canyon. The wounds the bandits had suffered from the explosion were already almost completely healed. Nhalmika still didn’t know what they were, but right now she would have traded them for a whole pack of Mana Waste mutants. Preferably slower ones.</p>
                <p>At the mouth of the canyon, Nhalmika stopped and turned. She wasn’t going to escape, and she wasn’t going to survive, but she might take a couple of the monstrous bandits down before they overwhelmed her. At least some of these brutes would have eaten their last horse! She aimed at the bandit in the middle of the pack and fired.</p>
                <p>Nhalmika’s scattergun emitted a strange clunk and a gout of fire from the barrel. In a horrifying second, she’d realized what had happened. She’d reloaded by instinct again, but this time she’d had the small magical flask in her other hand. She hadn’t put a round in the gun; she’d loaded the flask in there instead, without realizing it until now.</p>
                <p>But now was too late. The flask rocketed from the scattergun’s barrel and struck the central bandit in the face. The impact caused a geyser of water to drench all the bandits at once. Before Nhalmika could even lower her gun, the water became slush, then froze solid. The bandits were trapped.</p>
                <p>Nhalmika took a few cautious steps forward. When she saw the bandits couldn’t burst free of their icy prison, she took a few more steps, then quickly scooped up the flask from the snow. To her surprise, it was still intact. And it wasn’t even cold!</p>
                <p>“You’ve been a lot of trouble,” she said to the flask in a gentle, chiding tone. “I’m getting you to Ivlanton, then I’m walking south, and I’m not stopping until I can’t see a single snowflake.”</p>
