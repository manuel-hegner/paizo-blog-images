  \  </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the things\
  \ I love seeing while browsing through the internet, is seeing folks creating Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder content. And from all of my years assisting and even creating live-play\
  \ shows and content for thousands of eyes to see, I know the amount of work that\
  \ goes into making these shows. Especially for Tabletop RPG live-play shows such\
  \ as Pungeon Crawl. So to see amazing people spend that much time making content\
  \ for our games is truly heartwarming for us at Paizo. And when we get time we like\
  \ to spotlight people in our community who do a great job supporting and showing\
  \ off how great our games and community can be.</p> \n      <p>BBWolfe has been\
  \ absolutely stellar at providing her audience and ours with Starfinder content,\
  \ and we would like to encourage fans of Starfinder to support BBWolfe as she takes\
  \ her live-play show to new heights during this Year of the Crit!</p> \n      <p>You\
  \ can find her streaming Starfinder every week 5:00 P.M. - 9:00 P.M. Pacific time\
  \ zone on her <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/bbwolfe\" target=\"_blank\">twitch\
  \ channel</a>. We will be hosting her on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a> for those wishing to keep\
  \ all of your Tabletop RPG content in one place.</p> \n      <p>Further on is a\
  \ description of the show in her words for those interested.</p> \n      <p><font\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>Pungeon Crawl’s newest season, “Legally\
  \ Distinct,” asks the question “What if the Starfinder Universe had a beloved set\
  \ of Saturday morning action stars, and everything was real*?” The Deep Space Defenders\
  \ certainly have a power that you’ve never seen before--a team of real* heroes who\
  \ work together to even the score against any foe. Backed up by the beloved* Junior\
  \ Deep Space Defenders (The Crawlers), a team newly minted to follow in their footsteps,\
  \ surely no one can ever take them down.</p> \n      <p>Every week is a new live-play\
  \ adventure following the Junior DSDs as they make their way through their steps\
  \ as understudies to become real* super starheroes. They’ve just taken up their\
  \ first real outing with the Deep Space Defenders: a mission to escort a diplomatic\
  \ team for negotiations with a newly discovered civilization. But when a mysterious\
  \ distress signal is detected, the Deep Space Defenders set aside even this important\
  \ mission, for what kind of real* super starhero could say no to a call for help?\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Where will the Junior Deep Space Defenders stand when those heroes\
  \ disappear suddenly into the drift? The worlds of Gamemaster Kapperson’s design\
  \ will call to the crew of the StarJumper soon. With the brave* leadership* of the\
  \ Human Envoy “Captain Duke Raylan” (Fish), the consistent* encouragement* of the\
  \ Espraksa Envoy “Livven” (Bailey), the legally* accredited* medical nurturing of\
  \ the Spathinae Mystic “Durasa Commonality” (Nate), and the proportionally* appropriate\
  \ skills of the SRO Operative “GR-3Y” (Wing), surely the power must lie on their\
  \ side.</p> \n      <p>It won’t be the only thing lying. </p> \n      <p>Tune in\
  \ to twitch.tv/bbwolfe every week on Wednesdays at 8 Eastern/5 Pacific for the continuation\
  \ of the Pungeon Crawl to follow along with the crew’s misadventures.</p> \n   \
