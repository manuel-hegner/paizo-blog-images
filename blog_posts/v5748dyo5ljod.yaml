  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) Trade\
  \ Show in Las Vegas has wrapped up and I'm headed back to Seattle early next week.\
  \ GAMA brings retailers and industry professionals together once a year at their\
  \ trade show, as well as sponsors the Origins Gaming Convention every June in Columbus,\
  \ Ohio. The Paizo team was busy this year! The Jasons (Keely and Bulmahn) ran lots\
  \ of Starfinder ship combat demos, Erik Mona talked to loads of attendees about\
  \ upcoming Paizo products, including the Starfinder line, Jeff/Cosmo/Pierce/Jenny\
  \ spent lots of time in meetings, and I gave presentations on Paizo Organized Play.\
  \ By the way, how many of you caught our live tweets from the presentations? That\
  \ was the brainchild of our new Outreach Manager, Dan Tharp. You should see his\
  \ fingers fly on a phone keyboard.</p> \n    <p>Between meetings and presentations,\
  \ we all took a spin in the booth talking to retailers and other industry folks\
  \ about our awesome games. Loads of drool over <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a>,\
  \ including the Free RPG Day offering, <a href=\"/products/btpy9r0o?Starfinder-First-Contact\"\
  ><em>Starfinder: First Contact</em></a>, a sleek book filled with monsters that\
  \ work well in both the Pathfinder and Starfinder settings, and the shiny Buyer's\
  \ Guide, listing the upcoming Starfinder products. Equally exciting to attendees,\
  \ the news that Ninja Division will produce pre-painted miniatures for the Starfinder\
  \ line. While at the show, I handed out over 150 Organized Play packets to stores\
  \ looking to start organized play or expand their offerings. If you don't currently\
  \ have Pathfinder Society in a location near you, one may be coming soon. Otherwise,\
  \ email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>\
  \ and we can work together to get something started.</p> \n    <h2>Starfinder Society\
  \ and Know Direction</h2> \n    <p>This Wednesday, March 22 at 8:30 PM Eastern time,\
  \ the Starfinder Society team (John Compton, Thurston Hillman, and myself) will\
  \ join Know Direction hosts Ryan &amp; Perram for an evening of questions and answers.\
  \ While focused mostly on the newly announced <a href=\"\">Starfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</a> program, we can field some questions about Pathfinder Society as well.\
  \ If you have a question you really want answered, put it in the comments and we\
  \ will add it to our growing list. But be warned, some answers must stay under wraps\
  \ until closer to the launch in August. In the words of the great River Song, \"\
  Spoilers!\"</p> \n    <p>You can find the feed, and other Know Direction podcasts\
  \ and interviews <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">on\
  \ their website</a>. We'll see you there on Wednesday!</p> \n    <h2>The OPC Needs\
  \ a New Character</h2> \n    <p>In my recent travels, I've gotten to play more than\
  \ I've GMed or organized. Crazy, right? But it means all my characters leveled up\
  \ and are now in the Tier 5+ range. So I need new characters to take on my great\
  \ con tour this summer.</p> \n    <p>I've been trying to come up with ideas, but\
  \ nothing really tickled my fancy, so I'm asking Pathfinder Society players to help\
  \ me out. I'm actually making a contest out of it. Character concepts must fit the\
  \ criteria below. Include a backstory of between 280 and 300 words that provides\
  \ insight into the character and their motivations. Submit your entry as email text\
  \ (<b><i>no attachments!</i></b>) to <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com?Subject=OPC%20Needs%20A%20New%20Character%20Contest\"\
  >pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a> (Subject: OPC Needs A New Character Contest) along\
  \ with your Pathfinder Society number. Entries must be received by <b>April 3, 2017</b>\
  \ for consideration for the contest.</p> \n    <p>I've asked the Organized Play\
  \ team (and maybe a few other staffers) to help me narrow down the options. We will\
  \ put our top choices in a blog on Monday, April 10 for the community to vote on.\
  \ The concept with the highest votes becomes my 23rd character. The winner receives\
  \ $20 paizo.com store credit, as well as bragging rights and a named acknowledgement\
  \ every time I play the character.</p> \n    <h3>Criteria</h3> \n    <ul>\n    \
  \ <li><b>Race</b>: Any legal without a boon</li> \n     <li><b>Class</b>: Any</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>Gender</b>: Any</li> \n     <li><b>Name</b>: No puns and suitable\
  \ for playing with younger players</li> \n     <li><b>Stats</b>: Balanced (nothing\
  \ lower than an 8)</li> \n     <li><b>Resources</b>: Any</li> \n     <li><b>Format</b>:\
  \ Paizo stat block</li> \n     <li><b>Play Style</b>: I like to participate in all\
  \ aspects of an adventure, so a mix of skills and combat, don't mind being a \"\
  face\" but prefer not to be the front line fighter, and prefer cool concepts to\
  \ min-maxed abilities</li> \n     <li><b>Level progression</b>: 5th for feats, skills,\
  \ and selectable class features</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>I look forward to seeing\
  \ what you all come up with for me to play!</p> \n    <p>Next week is John's scenario\
  \ introductions, so I'll see you in two weeks with a wrap up of Who's Yer Con, which\
  \ I'm attending March 31 to April 2 in Indianapolis, IN.</p> \n    <p>Until thenâ€”\
  Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
