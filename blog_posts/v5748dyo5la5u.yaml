  \   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Meet the Iconics: Kyra</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\
  >Monday, July 30, 2007</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>The priests\
  \ of Sarenrae lead double lives. Known to her faithful as the Dawnflower, the Healing\
  \ Flame, and the Everlight, she teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion\
  \ and peace are her greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed,\
  \ they should be. Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory\
  \ in slaughter and death. From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to\
  \ the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift\
  \ justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, she expects her faithful\
  \ to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial arts promoting centering\
  \ of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer\
  \ any longer than necessary.</p> \n    <p>Her priests are often categorized into\
  \ these two camps—those who favor redemption as a method to defeat the enemy, and\
  \ those who favor the blade. Kyra is certainly one of the latter. Born in a small\
  \ farming town to loving parents, Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's\
  \ shrines. She was taken at a young age with the beauty of the shrine's stained\
  \ glass, and the grace of the three priestesses who practiced swordplay on the nearby\
  \ hill each dawn as they offered their morning prayers. When bandits attacked her\
  \ small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—\
  and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately,\
  \ the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors,\
  \ and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae,\
  \ swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and to not spare the blade\
  \ when the time for redemption passes.</p> \n    <p>Possessed of a fierce will and\
  \ pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her\
  \ trial by fire. She lost her family and home that fateful day, yet where another\
  \ might be consumed by anger and a thirst for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the\
  \ Everlight, and in the belief that, if she can prevent even one death at evil hands,\
  \ her own losses will not have been in vain.</p> \n    <p>Kyra, along with the rest\
  \ of the first four iconics, makes her debut as a pregenerated character in <a href=\"\
