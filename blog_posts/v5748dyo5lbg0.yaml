  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, September 10, 2010</p> \n    <p>Good morning,\
  \ and welcome to S.M. Tours. Today we are offering a \"virtual\" tour of the elusive\
  \ Paizo Publishing offices. Here to greet us as we open the front door is the ever-cheerful\
  \ Customer Service Manager Cosmo! While tempting, we recommend for your safety that\
  \ you do not stare directly at the moustache, as it has been known to attack on\
  \ occasion.</p> \n    <p>On your left are the offices of our technical team. If\
  \ we could see through the gloom in the first office, we would find the illustrious\
  \ PostMonster General and his minion Ross. We here at Paizo try to simulate the\
  \ native environment of these computer folks, as it helps with productivity. Please,\
  \ no flash photography—it disturbs their delicate sensibilities. Moving forward,\
  \ we see that our Technical Director Vic is not yet in. Unlike the cave where his\
  \ team slaves away, Vic's office is usually cheerfully lit by fluorescent lighting.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>On your right we have a set of cubicles: one for yours truly, one for\
  \ the warehouse manager, one for a laser printer, and one for a set of label printers.\
  \ While quiet now, in a few days those label printers will fire up to continuously\
  \ spit out subscription labels for hours at a time—truly a sight to behold.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Pressing onward, we have several more administrative offices lying dormant.\
  \ This is to be expected, as we started our tour fairly early this morning and the\
  \ residents have not yet arrived. Behind the door on the right is our server closet,\
  \ where hundreds of little hamsters feverishly run in shifts to keep the servers\
  \ running and the website on.</p> \n    <p>And here we have the upstairs breakroom,\
  \ complete with refrigerator, sink and the all-important coffee maker. Next, past\
  \ the restrooms, we have probably the most impressive location at the Paizo offices:\
  \ the combination conference room and library. Here you will find all manner of\
  \ old, new, rare, and interesting games, books, and magazines.</p> \n    <p>We are\
  \ tight on time, folks, so let's keep moving along. Here we have still more offices.\
  \ You'll notice that the double-doored corner office is the largest of the lot,\
  \ fittingly occupied by our CEO, Lisa Stevens. The expansive office seems to help\
  \ with the various and sundry secret meetings which take place there.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>If you'll follow me down the stairs, please, past the monsters... here we have\
  \ the offices belonging to our publisher, managing editor, and creative director.\
  \ On the left are the set of cubicles referred to (for obvious reasons) as the \"\
  Editorial Pit.\"</p> \n    <p>And what do we have here...? It would appear that,\
  \ unlike the other unoccupied offices, this one has its door open. What do you think,\
  \ folks, should we take a peek inside?</p> \n    <p>It appears this is the office\
  \ of lead designer Jason Bulmahn. Jason is on vacation this week and seems to have\
  \ forgotten to arm his office's defense system. You folks might be getting more\
  \ of a tour than you bargained for!</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom:2px\"\
