  \ Iconics: Adowyn</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 7, 2014</p> \n  \
  \ <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Today we introduce the next of the new\
  \ iconic characters from the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>:\
  \ Adowyn the hunter. Adowyn will also be a playable character in the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous set due for release in February 2015.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <blockquote> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">There’\
  s always a need for a skilled hunter, someone who can track down a threat and put\
  \ an end to it. And when a quarry is particularly dangerous or elusive, there’s\
  \ only one hunter the people seek: Adowyn.</span></p> \n     <p>Born to a pair of\
  \ skilled woodworkers in the quiet town of Crowstump on the northern border of Nirmathas,\
  \ Adowyn was always a wild child, more comfortable sneaking around in the mud chasing\
  \ the town rooster than practicing her letters or learning to carve. She grew up\
  \ surrounded by peoples from far-away lands, merchants and traders who had come\
  \ to make deals with her parents. Fascinated by their stories, Adowyn was eager\
  \ to see the world beyond, and when a journey with her father finally gave her that\
  \ chance at the age of 14, she was overjoyed.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ by Wayne Reynolds\n     </div> \n     <p>That joy was short-lived, however. Not\
  \ a day after Adowyn and her father left home for the dark forest trails of the\
  \ Fangwood, a diseased bear charged into their camp, savaging Adowyn’s father before\
  \ she could even cry out. Using the bow her father had carved for her, she sank\
  \ arrow after arrow into the beast, tears streaming down her cheeks. At last the\
  \ bear fell. The creature was dead—but so was her father.</p> \n     <p>Lost in\
  \ the woods, Adowyn found herself in the Blight, an area of the Fangwood where the\
  \ trees grew thick with disease and rot. Worse still, she found that no matter which\
  \ direction she walked, all paths led back to her meager camp. She spent six months\
  \ alone there, hunting and scavenging what food she could find and honing her skills\
  \ at the hunt. The beasts of the Blight were cunning and deadly, and making her\
  \ the prey nearly as often as she was the predator. Yet all of that changed when\
  \ she found Leryn.</p> \n     <p>Wounded by a fight with a rotting treant, the lean\
  \ gray wolf was limping through a clearing when Adowyn chanced upon him. She knew\
  \ right away that the wolf was not from this place, but rather was trapped in the\
  \ Blight like she was. She approached him with a scrap of meat from her most recent\
  \ kill, earning his trust. Over the following month, she nursed the wolf back to\
  \ health and named him Leryn, after her father. She soon found that she could sense\
  \ his mood, knowing instinctively when he was hungry, angry, or excited. They shared\
  \ much with each other in those first months. She exulted in his feral appetites,\
  \ his thrill of the hunt, and he learned to calm his urges, gaining her patience\
  \ and determination.</p> \n     <p>Years passed, and the two became an inseparable\
  \ team, learning to anticipate each other’s moves and hunting together as one. Now\
  \ the whole of the forest was their prey, but still they could not escape the Blight.\
  \ Indeed, the rot in the wood seemed to be growing worse by the day, and neither\
  \ hunter could shake the sense of something just beyond their reach, stalking them\
  \ but never revealing itself.</p> \n     <p>For months the tension grew. Adowyn\
  \ and Leryn slept in shifts, keeping watch over their small hovel. Finally, in the\
  \ dead of night, their mysterious watcher revealed itself, smashing the side of\
  \ their home while unleashing a terrifying howl. Rolling out of the debris, Adowyn\
  \ and Leryn rose to face the threat.</p> \n     <p>A gigantic bear rose up before\
  \ them. Like the beast that killed her father, this one too was poxed, but it was\
  \ far larger, with a sickly green foam spilling from its lips. Leryn leapt upon\
  \ it, clawing and biting at its flank while Adowyn drew forth her bow. Taking aim,\
  \ she sunk a shaft deep into its left eye. With an agonizing growl, the bear shook\
  \ loose the wolf and tore off into the woods, with Adowyn and her friend in hot\
  \ pursuit.</p> \n     <p>The chase lasted until dawn, when the Leryn's fangs finally\
  \ managed to sink into the bear’s throat, bringing it down. The pair stopped over\
  \ their kill to admire their work, and it was only then that they realized they\
  \ were no longer in the Blight.</p> \n     <p>It was by sheer chance that they found\
  \ their way to Crystalhurst, a community of druids in the southern Fangwood. They\
  \ stayed there for a while, regaining their strength and sharing what they had learned\
  \ with the druids, who swore to put an end to the Blight. The druids thought that\
  \ Adowyn might make a fine disciple for their order, but her bond to Leryn perplexed\
  \ them, as it was stronger than any they had ever known. In the end, they excitedly\
  \ concluded that the pair must be something new entirely, and were eager to study\
  \ them. Yet while Adowyn learned a great deal in her short time there, Crystalhurst\
  \ was not a place she meant to stay. Soon, she and Leryn set out once more, intent\
  \ upon returning home to see Adowyn’s mother and sister.</p> \n     <p>The young\
  \ woman who returned to Crowstump was nothing like the girl that had left. The townsfolk\
  \ kept their distance from her and the fierce wolf that padded along behind her.\
  \ Returning to her home, she found only strangers. It seems that her mother and\
  \ sister, heartbroken after the loss of Adowyn and her father, had left years ago\
  \ to start a new life somewhere less troubled by painful memories.</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ the years since that day, Adowyn has wandered the Inner Sea with Leryn at her\
  \ side, working as bounty hunter. She’s stalked a naga through the bleak wastes\
  \ of Osirion, brought back a master thief from the sewers of Oppara, and even managed\
  \ to recover the tail feathers of the elusive Jade Hawk without harming the reclusive\
  \ bird. The only quarry she hasn’t managed to track down is her own family, but\
  \ that search never ends—one day, she’ll be reunited with her loved ones.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Adowyn is never found without Leryn by her side. To others, she is quiet\
  \ and brooding, but she can frequently be found having animated conversations with\
  \ her wolf, as if he were responding in kind. She wears the armor and garb of the\
  \ rangers of Nirmathas, a gift she was given after hunting down a patrol of Molthuni\
  \ regulars that were stalking behind the lines terrorizing small villages. The bow\
  \ she carries is her father’s, a weapon she treats with reverence. In battle, Adowyn\
  \ and Leryn single out their foes with grim determination.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
