  \ of Chaos</i></a>, we've pulled out all the stops and asked noted reviewer Mordicai\
  \ Knode to do a new interview with Dave Gross, the author behind Count Jeggare and\
  \ Radovan, two of the most beloved characters in the Pathfinder universe!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>In 2010, Mordicai Knode was the first person to post a review of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8g3n\"><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a> after galleys went out at the American\
  \ Book Association in New York. Since then he has written a <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/11/varian-jeggare-and-radovan-virholt-are-the-new-fafhrd-and-gray-mouserpathfinder-tales-queen-of-thorns\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">comprehensive review of the first three Radovan and the Count\
  \ novels</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/book-review-king-of-chaos-dave-gross\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the very first review of King of Chaos</a> at <b>tor.com</b>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Despite Dave trotting across North America in order to sign books and\
  \ speak on panels at shows like Gen Con and Worldcon, Mordicai managed to track\
  \ him down via email. Here's what they had to say...</p> \n    <p><b>Let's get this\
  \ started with a chicken or the egg question: Who came first in your imagination,\
  \ Radovan or Varian?</b></p> \n    <p>Yes.</p> \n    <p>The story sketch that became\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8k9l\">\"Hell's Pawns,\"</a> a serial novella originally\
  \ appearing in the Council of Thieves Adventure Path, was based on a pitch I'd previously\
  \ sent another editor a few years earlier. He took eight months to respond and then\
  \ quietly vanished from said publisher, so the story sketch lingered in my ideas\
  \ folder. Since that pitch centered on a noble figure that later became Varian,\
  \ you could argue that he came first.</p> \n    <p>However, for Pathfinder I reworked\
  \ the outline both to set it in Golarion and to freshen it up. At that stage I'd\
  \ decided to tell the story from two alternating points of view, but when I began\
  \ outlining I realized I had room enough for only one. Taking the Holmes and Watson\
  \ stories as a model, I decided it was more interesting to tell the tale from the\
  \ POV of the assistant rather than the detective. </p> \n    <p>And then, because\
  \ I'd been watching a lot of film noir the previous month and felt a tough-guy sensibility\
  \ worked well in the capital city of Cheliax, I adopted the attitude of a hard-boiled\
  \ antihero for Radovan.</p> \n    <p>Thus, the existence of a character <i>like</i>\
  \ Varian came first (and in fact, Varian might have been his name in the previous\
  \ incarnation), but the tone and personality of Radovan came together before I fleshed\
  \ out the count.</p> \n    <p><b>Were there any interesting variations in the characters\
  \ as you shaped them? Was Radovan always part-devil, was Varian always a half-elf\
  \ who threw up when he tried to cast a spell? Did they go through versions and drafts\
  \ where they were profoundly different, or did they step fully formed onto the page,\
  \ like Howard and Conan?</b></p> \n    <p>Varian was always an armchair wizard,\
  \ although the exact nature of his disability evolved after \"Hell's Pawns\" when\
  \ I first started conceiving \n     <link for all instances><a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"\
  ><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>. Other details, like Varian's and Radovan's mutual\
  \ worship of Desna, or Lady Luck, were seeds I planted toward a vague end that started\
  \ taking shape when I outlined the first novel.</p> \n    <p>From the start, I wanted\
  \ both Varian and Radovan to be of mixed parentage. In pitch stage, Radovan was\
  \ a half-orc with a vaguely East Asian name. James Sutter told me there was another\
  \ half-orc in the works for Pathfinder fiction and suggested I make my character\
  \ what we now call a hellspawn. Hell-wrought half-breeds are more common in Cheliax,\
  \ where devils have supplemented the human legions for the past few generations.\
  \ Of course, being perverse, I decided that, while Radovan was hellspawn, he wasn't\
  \ descended from a devil in Cheliax.</p> \n    <p>When it came to the name, when\
  \ James suggested a Tian (Pathfinder's equivalent of Asian) name was a bit too unusual\
  \ for Cheliax, I went to one of my other favorite cultural analogs: the Ustalavs,\
  \ similar to Eastern Europeans. Radovan was not the first name I considered, but\
  \ the moment I typed it, I knew it was right for the character.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ secret of Radovan's ancestry was just a vague idea when I was writing \"Hell's\
  \ Pawns,\" but by the time I was outlining <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"><i>Prince\
  \ of Wolves</i></a>, I had generated a few pages of notes about the centuries preceding\
  \ his birth. His secrets have been coming out one big blossom at a time in these\
  \ four novels. I keep a growing secret timeline and notes for future revelations.\
  \ With what's revealed in <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"><i>King of Chaos</i></a>, Varian is starting\
  \ to catch up with Radovan in terms of learning, \"What is wrong with me?!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>There is sometimes a sort of anachronistic sense of humor in your\
  \ work, along with fairly contemporary attitudes among your characters. To me it\
  \ seems like you excel at being inspired by things outside the usual fantasy tropes\
  \ of elves and knights—things like grindhouse wuxia movies or Universal horror films—\
  and translating them plausibly into your ostensibly fantasy stories. Do you see\
  \ yourself writing in a very narrow subgenre of your own creation? Who else do you\
  \ think hits the same sweet spot? (I have in mind Alex Bledsoe's Eddie LaCrosse\
  \ series, personally.)</b></p> \n    <p>\"Anachronistic\" always strikes me as a\
  \ funny word to apply to an alternate world. Sure, there are some striking similarities\
  \ between many of Golarion's cultures and those of the real world, but the stories\
  \ aren't taking place in our past. </p> \n    <p>Still, I get what you mean. Some\
  \ readers think fantasy occurs only in Middle-Ages or Renaissance Britain. I like\
  \ to choose dialect and tone to suit a character or a region of the setting. For\
  \ instance, Radovan, as a lower-class Chelaxian, speaks with a kind of low-class,\
  \ pulp-era attitude, while Varian wouldn't seem out of place if he walked onto the\
  \ set of Downton Abbey. I try to make the elves look and sound different from the\
  \ crusaders without making them all sound like some near-variation of Tolkien's\
  \ creations.</p> \n    <p>As for bringing in non-standard-fantasy influences, I'm\
  \ not anywhere close to the first writer to do that. I think it's been in fantasy\
  \ since the beginning, but the popularity of the Tolkienesque model makes us forget\
  \ they exist. The writer who first opened my eyes to a different model for fantasy\
  \ was Roger Zelazny, whose Corwin of Amber was, I believe, partly inspired by the\
  \ Travis McGee novels of John D. McDonald.</p> \n    <p>Also, I just like to write\
  \ about the stuff I love, which in addition to fantasy adventure includes things\
  \ like classic horror films, wuxia movies, and detective fiction. I like dogs, so\
  \ there's a dog. I like jokes, so there are jokes. And while I'm not a violent person,\
  \ I enjoy action scenes, both the swashbuckling ones and the gritty ones that make\
  \ you sick of fighting.</p> \n    <p>Once on a convention panel, one of my colleagues\
  \ suggested that blending genres—like humor and horror in the <i>Buffy the Vampire\
  \ Slayer</i> TV series—was a recent trend. I noted <i>Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein</i>,\
  \ as well as Bob Hope in <i>Ghost Breakers</i>, and that was enough to persuade\
  \ him that we've been crossing the streams for ages in film, but it's been with\
  \ us in all art forever. This idea of keeping a genre \"pure\" seems like a recent\
  \ invention of booksellers who want to keep the shelves organized, made worse by\
  \ sales and marketing people who want to focus on narrow categories to make their\
  \ jobs easier and maximize sales.</p> \n    <p>Part of the reason I love Asian movies,\
  \ and many other movies made outside of Hollywood, is that they so often don't obey\
  \ the one-genre rule. The closest I've come to a \"regular\" fantasy novel is probably\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a>, although <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy90py\"><i>King of Chaos</i></a> is also not as noticeably stream-crossing\
  \ as the first two books.</p> \n    <p><b>You write about Varian and Radovan in\
  \ a number of different formats—serialized in printed adventures, ebook novellas,\
  \ online serials, and plain old-fashioned novels—and they are all fully integrated\
  \ into your stories. Kasiya, the mummified vampire antagonist of <i>King of Chaos</i>,\
  \ originally appeared in \"A Lesson in Taxonomy\" online, for instance. How do you\
  \ approach the different formats, and how do you see your writing evolving in response\
  \ to it?</b></p> \n    <p>Foremost in my mind is the importance of keeping the stories\
  \ independent of each other. It might be fun to read them chronologically (except\
  \ \"A Lesson in Taxonomy\"—don't read that one first), but the scheme is that you\
  \ can come into the setting and the characters from any one of those doors. Frankly,\
  \ I think some are more successful at that than others. To new readers I tend to\
  \ recommend <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>, since it's\
  \ a solid foundation for both the characters and the setting. Still, although you'd\
  \ be coming in on the fourth \"season,\" you should be able to start with any of\
  \ the short fiction or novellas, and now especially <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"\
  ><i>King of Chaos</i></a>, and not feel lost.</p> \n    <p>The short stories are\
  \ the most difficult and in some ways the most rewarding of the stories. I always\
  \ find myself stripping away subplots and details I wanted to include but couldn't\
  \ without muddling a short piece with too much incident.</p> \n    <p>I much prefer\
  \ the room allowed in a novella or novel, in part because I love subplots and small\
  \ character moments that don't at first seem relevant to the story, but when you\
  \ look back at them, you go, \"Oh!\"</p> \n    <p>After writing a short story, I\
  \ always feel energized to write a better single chapter in the next novel. While\
  \ the novels aren't a series of short stories, I admire the way George R.R. Martin\
  \ makes so many of the chapters in his Song of Ice and Fire such strong, stand-alone\
  \ stories, even when he leaves them on a cliffhanger. I am certainly moving toward\
  \ emulating that structure as I go forward.</p> \n    <p><b>Have you decided what\
  \ posterity should call the series? \"Radovan and the Count\"? \"Varian and Radovan?\"\
  </b></p> \n    <p>While I prefer \"Radovan and the Count\" for I don't know why,\
  \ I also use R&amp;J or R&amp;V for shorthand. My editor, James Sutter, tends to\
  \ use Varian and Radovan or vice versa. I don't know that it's important, but I\
  \ tend to leave off Radovan's surname because it's a plot point in <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"\
  ><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>.</p> \n    <p><b>If you could send Radovan and the\
  \ Count to any non-Pathfinder setting, what would you pick? Extra points for increasing\
  \ specificity!</b></p> \n    <p>Now there's a question I've never considered before.\
  \ Let's immediately disqualify any of the nascent settings I've been sketching out\
  \ for original work.</p> \n    <p>The boys would fit in very well to Leiber's Nehwon\
  \ or Zelazny's Amber, I bet. And they wouldn't be entirely out of place in the Forgotten\
  \ Realms. Now I wonder whether they'd be a natural fit for the Iron Kingdoms.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Because I've chosen areas in Golarion in part because of their resemblance\
  \ to real-world locations (Ustalav as Eastern Europe, Tian Xia as Asia, Cheliax\
  \ as imperial/infernal Rome), a very loose historical setting might work, although\
  \ for some reason that one seems weirder than the near-fits of other fantasy worlds.\
  \ Maybe it's because of the high level of magic the boys have encountered in Golarion.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>So, Dave, what is the craziest thing you've ever done as \"research\"\
  \ for a book?</b></p> \n    <p>While it doesn't seem crazy to me, my wife's eyes\
  \ still bulge when I mention the 140 kung fu movies I watched or re-watched before,\
  \ during, and long after writing <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfm\"><i>Master of Devils</i></a>.\
  \ Fortunately, a surprising number of them are good, and an even larger number were\
  \ cheap.</p> \n    <p>From another angle, the craziest thing I've done is learning\
  \ a 10-year-old setting over a period of just a few months. Granted, I had a lot\
  \ of help and handholding, but that's the one that felt like walking a high wire\
  \ over a pit of fast-zombie tigers.</p> \n    <p><b>Do you consider Radovan and\
  \ the Count to be \"gaining levels\" as the books progress? It's a very high-level\
  \ world, but as they go along in their stories—learning more about their abilities,\
  \ and picking up new tricks—it seems that they are getting more capable, and more\
  \ organic. Does that meta-fiction constraint, of experience and levels, factor in\
  \ to your mental calculus for the characters?</b></p> \n    <p>The short answer\
  \ to your question is \"yes.\"</p> \n    <p>But remember that they're both gaining\
  \ and losing levels, learning new abilities and losing some because of \"reasons.\"\
  \ You're right to call that an instance of meta-fiction, but it's not always a constraint.\
  \ Sometimes the Paizo developers and editors let me explore new directions with\
  \ the rules, as long as there's a story reason for it that still connects to the\
  \ magic \"physics\" by story logic.</p> \n    <p>For instance, the whole business\
  \ of Radovan's journey in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfm\"><i>Master of Devils</i></a>\
  \ brings him to a truly frightening level of physical threat, but all he wants is\
  \ to be free of the thing that gives him that power. The outcome of that journey\
  \ haunts him in <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a> and makes\
  \ him look back on his brutal upbringing. Sometimes the thing he hates the most\
  \ is what he's been taught to be, what he's \"built for.\"</p> \n    <p>Likewise\
  \ with Count Jeggare's magical \"disability.\" In game terms, there's no reason\
  \ he shouldn't be able to cast spells, but I proposed a reason for his problem to\
  \ James Sutter very early on. In <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"><i>King of Chaos</i></a>,\
  \ I finally get to reveal why he's been handicapped all these decades. But if you\
  \ know the character, you can already imagine some of the psychological obstacles\
  \ he'll to continue to face even though he seems at last to understand the true\
  \ nature of his magical ability.</p> \n    <p>If I can use the game mechanics to\
  \ reflect a character's internal conflict, that's what I try to do.</p> \n    <p><b>Conan\
  \ winds up on the throne. We all know that; we know that even when we read Conan\
  \ stories from when he was a pirate or a thief or a mercenary. Do you know the eventual\
  \ fate of the Count and Radovan?</b></p> \n    <p>No.</p> \n    <p>That said, I\
  \ have a ridiculous number of story ideas cluttering my head, some of them focusing\
  \ on the boys, but others featuring some of the secondary characters from their\
  \ novels. There are experiences I want each of them to have, tests I'd like to see\
  \ them face, losses they need to suffer... and, to be perfectly honest, also some\
  \ Golarion-shaking events I'd like them to be a part of if and when the time comes\
  \ that the shepherds of the world are ready to release that particular catastrophe\
  \ and will invite me to put the boys into play.</p> \n    <p>I've shared a short\
  \ wish list of these events with James Sutter, James Jacobs, and Wes Schneider.\
  \ One day maybe I'll get an email that begins, \"You know how you said you'd like\
  \ to write something involving the return of <b>REDACTED</b> or a war between <b>REDACTED</b>\
  \ and <b>REDACTED</b>? That time is nigh!\"</p> \n    <p><i>Dave Gross recently\
