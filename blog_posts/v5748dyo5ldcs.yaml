  \ border=\"0\"><br>Illustration by Ryan Portillo</a>\n   </div> \n   <p>One of my\
  \ top goals from day one has been to see a facelift to the Pathfinder Society home\
  \ page, and the creation of various sub-pages that will link to it. Though I can’\
  t provide much details of what the final results will look like yet, I can say that\
  \ one of the areas it will include is a section on the history of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>. </p> \n   <p>It is important that new players\
  \ can join the Society at any time and look back at what has happened in regard\
  \ to the storyline from previous seasons. At the same time, veteran players will\
  \ be able reflect back on what happened during a season they participated in. This\
  \ is especially true as we move forward with the revamp of faction missions and\
  \ season-long faction goals having lasting effects on future storylines, the viability\
  \ of the factions’ existences, and rewards that characters in certain factions can\
  \ earn. The first goal to accomplish this was a recap of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season2\"\
  >Season Two, Year of the Shadow Lodge</a>.</p> \n   <p>I met with Wolfgang Baur\
  \ at Neon Con last November to discuss how we could get more Pathfinder, specifically\
  \ Pathfinder Society, into <a href=\"/store/magazines/koboldQuarterly\">Kobold Quarterly</a>.\
  \ When I pitched the idea of a Season Two recap in the spring issue, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8s3j\">KQ #21</a>, he seemed excited. I reached out to Nicholas Gray,\
  \ a very devoted player I knew from my days in Atlanta, and he agreed to write up\
  \ a summation that included the major plot points from the scenarios that revolved\
  \ around the Shadow Lodge insurgency. Once the summer issue of Kobold Quarterly\
  \ is released, and the new Pathfinder Society home page goes live, this article\
  \ will also appear on the history section. A big thank you goes out to both Wolfgang\
  \ and Nick for making the idea become a reality. You will also be able to find a\
  \ recap of Season 3, Year of the Ruby Phoenix, shortly after Gen Con on the same\
  \ page.</p> \n   <p>Switching focus from the history of Pathfinder Society to the\
  \ future, in the past 4 to 6 weeks, I have assigned six new Venture-Captains to\
  \ the Society to help grow PFS in their regions. Some were announced on the messageboards.\
  \ Others have recently been assigned. Regardless, I wanted to write a few words\
  \ to make sure they receive the recognition and thanks they deserve for stepping\
  \ up and taking the reigns of PFS in their regions.</p> \n   <p>The two newest Venture-Captains\
  \ to be assigned are James Engle in Cleveland, Ohio and James Hebert in New Orleans,\
  \ LA. </p> \n   <p>James Engle will not only will be focusing his efforts on the\
  \ Cleveland area, but he will also be helping coordinate the growth of Pathfinder\
  \ Society in Canton and Akron as well. He advised me during his interview process\
  \ that he would help out Toledo if there were a need.</p> \n   <p>James Hebert will\
  \ expand outside of New Orleans and reach out to Lafayette and Lake Charles to the\
  \ west, and Biloxi, Mississippi to the east. He also advised a trip to Baton Rouge\
  \ may not be out of the question if there were interested stores or players looking\
  \ to set establish games as well. Although it nearly killed me to put a Saints fan\
  \ into a Venture-Captain position, I have faith that James can rise above the normal\
  \ expectations of Saints fans and do a good job with Pathfinder Society. ;-)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We also added Michael McNerney in Columbus, Ohio, Karim Majeri in Paris,\
  \ France, and Daniel Luckett in Western Michigan. Finally, we promoted Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ Clint Blome to full Venture-Captain status of the Omaha, Nebraska region.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>You have my thanks, and I’m sure the appreciation of your local players,\
  \ for all of your efforts in coordinating Pathfinder Society. </p> \n   <p>Mike\
  \ Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
