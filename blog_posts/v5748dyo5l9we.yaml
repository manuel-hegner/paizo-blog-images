  \ Final Bow</h1> <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 26, 2008</p> </a>\n   <p><a>When\
  \ we first started the Pathfinder's Journal, back in </a><a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7zkr\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #1</a>, we really didn't know what it was going to be. Was it\
  \ a travel guide? An in-character support article? A series of standalone short\
  \ stories?</p> \n   <p>By the time we reached <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy8029\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #2</a>, however, it was clear that what <i>Pathfinder</i> really\
  \ needed was something different—a straight-up epic fantasy story with a familiar\
  \ character who would give us fun world details, yes, but who would also pull people\
  \ through them via a fast-paced narrative. Something that GMs, players, and even\
  \ non-gaming fantasy enthusiasts could pick up and use to immediately get a sense\
  \ of Golarion. And to do that, we needed a protagonist. Enter Eando Kline. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Eando's story arc has taken numerous directions since those early days,\
  \ as we grew ever more ambitious with his destiny. What started as standalone travel\
  \ journals became adventure-path-spanning short stories and finally a full 18-part\
  \ novella leading him halfway across our world to confront the mysterious leaders\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society—and all stemming from that mysterious little box he\
  \ runs across in his first episode.</p> \n   <p>Many quality authors have helped\
  \ to shape Eando since his conception two years ago, and through his adventures\
  \ shaped parts of Golarion: before Eando's travels took him there, we knew next\
  \ to nothing about Belkzen, Kaer Maga, or any number of other locations in northwest\
  \ Varisia. Moreover, he gave us an archetype to work from in designing the Pathfinder\
  \ Society. It wasn't always easy reconciling so many different voices and styles—\
  something that's been my department since <i>The Hook Mountain Massacre</i>—but\
  \ in doing so Eando became a living, breathing character, chock-full of flaws and\
  \ little moments of heroism.</p> \n   <p>And now, after 18 episodes, his story is\
  \ coming to a close. </p> \n   <p>It was my honor to write the <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bc\"\
  >final chapter</a> in Eando's saga, and I hope that when it arrives in your mailbox\
  \ or local game store you'll find it a fitting conclusion for Golarion's first action\
  \ hero. Along with the story, you'll also find a two-page NPC write-up with Eando's\
  \ post-conclusion stat block and featuring this awesome character portrait from\
  \ Jason Engle—a little thank-you present to all those readers who've been asking\
  \ us \"So is Eando a bard, or what?\" for the last 18 months.</p> \n   <p>Starting\
  \ with <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bd\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #19</a>, all of the\
  \ Pathfinder's Journals in a given adventure path will be by a single author, and\
  \ feature a single story arc with a new protagonist. For Legacy of Fire, that's\
  \ New York Times bestselling author Elaine Cunningham, who'll be introducing us\
  \ to Channa Ti, a half-elven, half-Mwangi water druid making her way through Katapesh\
  \ and Osirion in search of a lost city and an imprisoned god. Talk about exotic—\
  even Eando would approve.</p> \n   <p>Eando Kline may be back someday—his type always\
  \ tends to pop up just when you least expect it—but for now, at least, his sun has\
  \ set, and it's time for some new heroes to take the stage. I hope you've enjoyed\
  \ his story. I know I have.</p> \n   <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have something\
  \ in my eye...</p> \n   <p>James Sutter<br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor</p> \n  </blockquote>\
