  \ \n      <p><em>The focus of every Pathfinder game is the player characters—they’\
  re the stars of the show and appear in every scene that plays out in-game. But what\
  \ about those scenes? What stories are being told? What old legends are being discovered,\
  \ and what new ones are being forged? Who are the villains, the allies, the traitors,\
  \ the lovers, the monsters, and the gods? Who runs the world? When you’re the Game\
  \ Master, that’s all up to you! </em><br> — <em>GM Core</em></p> \n      <p>Here\
  \ you will find the basics of what it means to be a GM and guidance from the authors\
  \ on how to use the book. They help you choose your tools whether you are a new\
  \ GM, running a published adventure, making your own, or just need items.</p> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <h3>Running the Game</h3> \n      <p><em>As Game Master, you\
  \ run each session of Pathfinder, providing the link between the players and the\
  \ world of the game. It’s up to you to set the scene as the player characters battle\
  \ monsters, interact with other people, and explore new locations.<br> — GM Core</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p>This chapter provides tools to create a welcoming environment, prepare\
  \ adventures, create characters, and plan and run sessions. You will find one of\
  \ the best guides in the industry on special considerations, running encounters,\
  \ exploration, downtime, difficulty classes, and rewards. You will also find sidebars\
  \ on topics such as Tools for Responsible Play, Collaboration During Play, and more!</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Building Games</h3> \n      <p><em>Game Mastering can\
  \ be an extremely creative endeavor, and this chapter gives you a suite of tools\
  \ to make your own campaign or adventure. You can even create your own creatures,\
  \ hazards, and items to populate your game, or even make your own game world!<br>\
  \ — GM Core</em></p> \n      <p>This chapter covers everything you need to build\
  \ an adventure of your own, from campaign structure to encounter design, world building,\
  \ variant rules, and more. While you may need to make something from scratch, you\
  \ can also adapt existing material using the guidance from this chapter. Build your\
  \ own hazards, items, and creatures using <em>GM Core</em>’s in-depth developer\
  \ advice and mathematical benchmarks. The Rewards section gives you all you need\
  \ to distribute Experience Points, Hero Points, and treasure throughout your campaign.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Age of Lost Omens</h3> \n      <p><em>Ten thousand years\
  \ ago, the world of Golarion came close to ending. Earthfall, as this extinction-level\
  \ event came to be known, saw the world pummeled by a shower of falling stars that\
  \ sank continents, hollowed out new seas, and destroyed civilizations. It took centuries\
  \ for the world to recover, and centuries more for society to rebuild, but recover\
  \ it did. <br> — GM Core </em></p> \n      <p>Though the Building Games chapter\
  \ includes everything you need to create your game world, the Age of Lost Omens\
  \ is a fully developed setting that’s ready to use and has vast amounts of support\
  \ across Paizo’s adventures and Lost Omens books. Explore the Inner Sea Region and\
  \ beyond, learning about the rich cultures, religions, and factions therein. Use\
  \ tools like nation and settlement stat blocks to understand our locations or flesh\
  \ out your own realms. This chapter also covers extraplanar setting elements, taking\
  \ your campaign into the Great Beyond.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Subsystems</h3>\
  \ \n      <p><em>When your game goes into uncharted territory or you want to emphasize\
  \ an element of gameplay that usually gets overlooked or condensed into a single\
  \ check, you can use a subsystem. As the name implies, subsystems are extensions\
  \ of the main rules system that allow you to explore a particular topic or style\
  \ of play at your table.<br> — GM Core</em></p> \n      <p>Part of Pathfinder’s\
  \ robust game engine lies in its ability to explore elements of gameplay that are\
  \ not always in the forefront. The Subsystems chapter gives Game Masters a diverse\
  \ set of tools to tackle any in-game challenge and to track progress on tasks using\
  \ Victory Points. Where some systems may leave you in the lurch wondering “what\
  \ should my players roll for this?”, Pathfinder’s subsystems provide support for\
  \ Game Masters and players alike. Subsystems covered in this chapter include Influence,\
  \ Research, Infiltration, Dueling, and more.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ their adventures and improve their station in the world, characters collect ever\
  \ more fabulous items, from enchanted armor and weapons to spell-infused wands and\
  \ staves.<br> — GM Core</em></p> \n      <p>The Treasure Trove is a Game Master’\
  s guide of alchemical and magical items and how to use them. Not only does this\
  \ chapter cover a large range of treasure—ranging from potions and magical staves\
  \ to apex items and more—but it’s also a comprehensive guide to reading item stat\
  \ blocks and understanding how items work.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
