  \ 4 Days in Gaming™ (whew) and are making our way back to Paizo home offices. Most\
  \ of the team will be back at work on scenarios soon, but I’ve got a few more days\
  \ out of the office as I visit friends and family in around the Great Lakes.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Each of our team had a different favorite memory of Gen Con and I asked\
  \ everyone to send me theirs. Unfortunately, Linda was out today and didn’t send\
  \ one in, so we will have to include hers in a later blog. To keep this blog from\
  \ growing too long, we’re putting them behind spoiler tags. Please take a moment\
  \ to share our memories and experiences and consider adding yours to the comments.\
  \ We hope to see you at a convention soon, where we can make these types of memories\
  \ with you.</p> \n     <p></p>\n     <details> <summary style=\"“font-weight:\"\
  \ bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Tonya]</summary> \n      <p>My favorites revolve around\
  \ handing out campaign coins and spending time with the fabulous group of volunteers.\
  \ These experiences bring me back, convention after convention, and Gen Con 2019\
  \ was no different. This year, it seemed like there were more smiles, more happy\
  \ faces, more enjoyment of games then I had seen before. It is a joy to sit on the\
  \ stage in the Sagamore and look out over the tables, watching everyone play. I\
  \ noticed a change in our demographics this year. There were more female GMs, more\
  \ youth players than ever before. This speaks to the welcoming nature of our communities\
  \ and to those organizing games, thank you for making our hobby accessible to all.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>To everyone I met, for everyone I interacted with, to all those that\
  \ played or GMed, thank you for supporting our programs and our games. I hope to\
  \ see you soon! </p> \n     </details>\n     <p></p> \n     <p></p>\n     <details>\

  \      <p>2019 marks my 9th Gen Con representing Paizo and my 7th working for the\
  \ company as an employee. In many ways, the show had all of the beloved touchstones\
  \ I’ve come to expect, such as the tremendous multi-table interactive specials,\
  \ the many appreciative fans, the on-the-ground problem-solving, the enthusiastic\
  \ volunteers, the late-night discussions, the crush of eager customers on the opening\
  \ day, the launch of new adventures (like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zna?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Origin-of-the-Open-Road\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Origin of the Open Road</a>, whose debut I oversaw\
  \ on Thursday night), and the opportunity to show off our products to all comers—\
  including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Archaeotagh/status/1158140210187788288?s=20\"\
  >the last Starfinder Beginner Box sold just a minute before the dealers hall closed</a>.\
  \ On the other hand, this convention was bittersweet, for just before traveling\
  \ to Indianapolis <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42o8o?Changing-Positions-on-the-Organized-Play-Team\"\
  >I had accepted a new position at Paizo: senior developer</a>. In that capacity,\
  \ I’ll be consulting occasionally on organized play story arcs as needed, yet the\
  \ majority of my energy will go toward Starfinder’s print products. Although we\
  \ broke the news to various parties earlier at Gen Con, the formal announcement\
  \ happened on Saturday night—fittingly as the last multi-table interactive event\
  \ of Pathfinder Society in the first edition was kicking into gear.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Organized play will always be special to me. It’s how I learned some of my\
  \ best lessons in GMing (ask me about <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8kae?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Kortos-Envoy\"\
  >The Kortos Envoy</a>). It’s where I’ve met some of my best friends and closest\
  \ collaborators. It’s what’s helped launch the writing careers of dozens of talented\
  \ authors for Paizo and beyond. And it will continue to be a passion of mine at\
  \ the office, at the gaming table, and at many conventions I’ll attend going forward.\
  \ Little exemplifies those feelings quite like Gen Con, which so lives up to its\
  \ title: “Best Four Days in Gaming.” I’ll catch you at the next one!</p> \n    \

  \ bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Thurston]</summary> \n      <p>Wow, GenCon 2019, what\
  \ a year! I spent most of the convention working alongside Tonya in the Sagamore\
  \ Ballroom, where I got to see thousands of players enjoying our many games. Every\
  \ year, without fail, GenCon gives me the opportunity to speak with our GMs and\
  \ players from across the world, and hear what their thoughts on our games. It’\
  s a perfect chance to realize the impact of what we do here on the Organized Play\
  \ Team and to get some valuable feedback to incorporate into future work. Thanks\
  \ to everyone who stopped by, said hi, gave feedback, or told a fun story about\
  \ their tables. As always, I’m looking forward to next year!</p> \n     </details>\n\
  \     <p></p> \n     <p></p>\n     <details> <summary style=\"“font-weight:\" bold;\
  \ margin-left: 10px;“>[Michael]</summary> \n      <p>Let me just say: what an amazing\
  \ GenCon! It was absolutely incredible to see the energy and excitement as thousands\
  \ and thousands of people picked up the new edition, played the demos, participated\
  \ in organized play up in the Sagamore Ballroom, and just generally had a blast\
  \ playing the products we’ve all been working so hard on. There wasn’t a single\
  \ of the convention that I didn’t enjoy, and I had so many opportunities to interact\
  \ with many of the amazing members of our community.</p> \n      <p>I want to take\
  \ a moment to specifically thank the wonderful Org Play GMs who came out ready to\
  \ give our players an enjoyable and memorable experience. It’s the GMs who go the\
  \ extra mile to make their games fun and exciting, and to create positive memories\
  \ and experiences, that really make GenCon such an awesome convention. It’s the\
  \ folks who go above and beyond to keep players excited to sit at our tables that\
  \ keep our community strong and vibrant.</p> \n      <p>Word has probably gotten\
  \ around by this point that this was John Compton’s last GenCon as a member of the\
  \ organized play team. I want to thank John for all of the wisdom and guidance (not\
  \ to mention countless hours and words!) that he’s shared with me and everyone who’\
  s participated in the organized play program for the better part of the last decade.\
  \ Best of luck in your new role with the Starfinder team John, I’m excited to see\
  \ what you’ve got in store for us!</p> \n     </details>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>Come\
  \ back later today for our first of the month Spotlight blog!</p> \n     <p>Tonya\
