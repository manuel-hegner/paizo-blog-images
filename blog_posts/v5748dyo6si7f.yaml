  \ players! I’m pleased to let you know that the wheels have already begun to spin\
  \ up for 2023’s convention season.</p> \n      <p>For our major shows (such as PaizoCon\
  \ and Gen Con), we have a volunteer organizing committee that runs our organized\
  \ play space. This group works closely with me, as the Organized Play Coordinator,\
  \ to determine the schedule, recruit GMs, and get them everything they need to make\
  \ the show a success!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/d960ad1b-9967-00f9-1158-72274b18312d/e0f195d6-af17-4e8c-950e-914a22e92559/NivisGameTable_OrgPlay_1200x675.png\"\

  \      </div> \n      <p>While we’re still finalizing what our presence looks like\
  \ for Gen Con, we know we’re going to need a few new members of our leadership team.\
  \ Applications for these positions are open until <b>January 1, 2023</b>. After\
  \ that, I’ll anonymize the submissions and discuss them with our existing Gen Con\
  \ Committee.</p> \n      <p>Please note that joining a leadership team is a significant\
  \ commitment, as there is a lot of preparation work to do to get ready for a show.\
  \ More information about the leadership team’s responsibilities and rewards are\
  \ available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QF-do1YTta8NAYxDqrgs3QEjYGP14oxZGIKjuCTsvs/edit?usp=sharing\"\
  >in this document</a>. If you’re not already a Venture Officer, we’ll be asking\
  \ you to sign a volunteer agreement stating that you agree to these commitments.\
  \ Note that anybody is free to apply for a committee; we welcome those who are not\
  \ already Venture Officers!</p> \n      <p>Gen Con 2023 is seeking applicants for\
  \ the following positions:</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Online Committee Member</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>We’re looking to add one member whose sole responsibility will be to\
  \ focus on Gen Con Online. This position is not required to attend the show in Indianapolis\
  \ (and in fact, it will be much easier if they <em>don’t</em>). We’re asking them\
  \ to oversee operations via our Discord during the show: coordinating with HQ, ensuring\
  \ GMs have what they need, and taking responsibility for the Organized Play-related\
  \ activities. It’s a tall order, so we’re looking for someone experienced with online\
  \ conventions.</p> \n      <h3>Academy Assistant</h3> \n      <p>The Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder Academies are our programs designed to teach young players (under\
  \ the age of 18) about our games in a safe, family-friendly environment. We’re looking\
  \ for someone who wants to learn about this program this year, with the goal of\
  \ training them to take over next year. As a result, we’re looking for applicants\
  \ willing to take on a multi-year commitment for this position. The ideal candidate\
  \ enjoys working with children and families and can mentor GMs on playing with young\
  \ children. A background check is required for this position at the applicant’s\
  \ expense; this is only required once the position is offered and accepted, and\
  \ previous checks (such as from a teaching or youth group) will be accepted.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Headquarters Department Head</h3> \n      <p>At major conventions,\
  \ we have a team of HQ volunteers whose task is to support GMs, answer questions\
  \ from players, and muster players to tables. The HQ staff is the backbone of our\
  \ conventions, and we can’t run a show without them. We’re looking for someone to\
  \ serve as our Department Head for this team. They’ll work to train our in-person\
  \ HQ staff on best practices, serve as backup for the team in the event of issues,\
  \ and document methods for future conventions. The ideal candidate has experience\
  \ with running HQ at larger conventions and is able to train new staffers quickly.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>If you’re interested in any of these positions, please fill out the\
  \ form below! If necessary, we’ll contact applicants with follow-up questions and\
  \ notify all applicants of their status before the end of January. We’re looking\
  \ forward to working with you at the Best Four Days in Gaming!</p> \n      <center>\n\
