  \ by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Erasmus was born the youngest scion\
  \ of a minor noble house in Caliphas, Ustalav's capital. Along with his five older\
  \ siblings, he enjoyed the benefits of a fine education and practice in horsemanship,\
  \ swordplay, and tutelage in the arcane arts. Yet he understood he had little hope\
  \ of ever claiming ancestral holdings or heirship. He spent his early life in the\
  \ cosmopolitan pursuits of the idle rich, and he seemed destined for some opportune\
  \ marriage to secure his family's comfort, with the resulting life likely to be\
  \ one of bored leisure.</p> \n     <p>As Erasmus left his teenage years behind,\
  \ though, the heirs of his family began to mysteriously die. Authorities discovered\
  \ Nissa, his eldest sister—a cunning duelist—slain in some underground fighting\
  \ pit by an opponent she severely outmatched. His uncle, a skilled magic-user, was\
  \ torn apart by a summoned creature in his own occult library, while the corpse\
  \ of his son was found broken below his high tower. His second sister, Veldira,\
  \ choked to death on porridge in the Pharasmin cathedral where she served. Erasmus's\
  \ closest confidant, his sly older brother Baylock, was found hanged in a dark alley\
  \ in what authorities ruled a suicide. Amid the turmoil of the deaths, Erasmus's\
  \ father began to waste away in his council chamber, while the family's eldest surviving\
  \ heir, Erasmus's brother Vinn, took control of the family affairs. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>It wasn't long before the voices started.</p> \n     <p>At first they were\
  \ the faintest whispers, which Erasmus dismissed as sleep-deprived hallucinations\
  \ or echoes bouncing through the corridors of his family's estate. But with each\
  \ new death, the whispers grew stronger and their message clearer: \"Murder.\" Erasmus\
  \ ignored the ghostly mutterings as best he could, quietly writing them off as the\
  \ lunacy of grief. But, with his suspicions aroused, he began to investigate the\
  \ whispers' claims. Erasmus told no one of the subtly altered summoning circle he\
  \ found in his uncle's chambers, or of the oily residue that failed to wash from\
  \ his father's used silverware. The more he discovered, the more intense the chorus\
  \ of voices grew in his crowded mind. Servants concealed Erasmus's late-night wanderings\
  \ as best they could, or dismissed his mutterings and wild ravings as overwhelming\
  \ grief. </p> \n     <p>It all came to a head when one of Erasmus's episodes interrupted\
  \ his own father's funeral. Snapping his head back and forth, Erasmus railed against\
  \ a chorus of unseen phantoms. Amid the outburst, he howled that his family was\
  \ victim of his eldest brother's deceit.</p> \n     <p>None who heard truly listened,\
  \ though, all convinced that grief had pushed Erasmus past the brink of insanity.\
  \ Vinn, Erasmus's only remaining family member, committed him to Havenguard Lunatic\
  \ Asylum.</p> \n     <p>For nearly a year, Erasmus languished at the asylum, baffling\
  \ his well-intentioned wardens as they sought to heal the man's troubled mind. But\
  \ on the anniversary of his father's death, another voice called through the darkness.\
  \ From a neighboring cell, a new prisoner calling himself \"the King\" counseled\
  \ the troubled man. With gruff kindness, the stranger with the accent of a northern\
  \ barbarian taught Erasmus not to fight the chorus, but rather to accept and welcome\
  \ it, opening his mind and body to its words. Erasmus gradually identified each\
  \ mysterious voice in turn, and finally understood they were the shades of his family—\
  the spirits of his deceased brothers, father, and uncle—who endlessly dwelled upon\
  \ the circumstances of their deaths. Over time, he learned to sit in quiet communion\
  \ with the voices, and to allow them to exercise their influence upon his mortal\
  \ shell.</p> \n     <p>With the aid of his uncle's mastery of magic, Erasmus easily\
  \ retrieved the keys to his cell to secure his escape. Under the control of his\
  \ battle-eager eldest sister, the asylum's guards had no hope of restraining him.\
  \ But when he gratefully burst open the King's cell, he found it empty. Too harried\
  \ to ponder the implications of his friend's disappearance, Erasmus fled, relying\
  \ on the influence of his roguish brother Baylock to slip through the shadows to\
  \ freedom.</p> \n     <p>Yet, the world had not changed for the better during Erasmus's\
  \ absence. Vinn had used his brother's madness to legally disown him from any claim\
  \ to his family's titles or lands. His murderous brother had also married into a\
  \ prestigious noble family, solidifying his holdings and winning him considerable\
  \ influence in Caliphas's royal court. Seeing little chance at justice, and now\
  \ questioning the source of the mysterious voice that had counseled him back to\
  \ sanity, Erasmus knew he'd need living allies to retake his birthright. He boarded\
  \ a ship crossing Lake Encarthan, the restless spirits of his ancestors following\
  \ close behind.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Brandon Hodge<br> <i>Contributing\
