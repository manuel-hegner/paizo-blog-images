  \ God</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 24, 2009</p> \n   <p>With her\
  \ masterful Skaith trilogy wrapped up in <a href=\"/planetstories/v5748btpy83x7\"\
  ><i>The Reavers of Skaith</i></a>, it's time for Leigh Brackett to take us away\
  \ to yet another world—or rather, another era. For while her latest release from\
  \ <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a>, <a href=\"/planetstories/v5748btpy83x9\"\
  ><i>The Sword of Rhiannon</i></a>, takes place on the same strange and populous\
  \ Mars as <a href=\"/planetstories/v5748btpy7x8f\"><i>The Secret of Sinharat</i></a>,\
  \ the story draws us far back into the past, when Mars was a lush world of oceans,\
  \ pirates, and strange alien races.</p> \n   <p>Originally titled \"The Sea Kings\
  \ of Mars\" when it first appeared in the pulp magazine <i>Thrilling Wonder Stories</i>\
  \ and later rebranded for its publication as a novel, <a href=\"/planetstories/v5748btpy83x9\"\
  ><i>The Sword of Rhiannon</i></a> is the story of Matthew Carse, a Martian archaeologist-turned-looter\
  \ whose discovery of a mysterious tomb and a sword belonging to the dark god Rhiannon\
  \ sends him hurtling back in time to a Mars ruled by corrupt imperialists, their\
  \ tyranny backed by the super-science of sinister snake-men. In this world, only\
  \ the Viking-like Sea Kings and their winged and aquatic alien allies dare challenge\
  \ their oppressors, and with the discovery of Carse's sword, the time has come for\
  \ a last desperate battle. Enslaved by the beautiful but evil princess of the imperial\
  \ Sarks, and somehow tied to the dark god himself, will Carse help lead the rebellion,\
  \ or find himself exterminated by his own allies? For more, check out the following\
  \ excerpt:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Panting, dripping, his mind a whirl of\
  \ confused speculations, he dug outward through the soft soil till a small hole\
  \ of brilliant daylight opened in front of him.</p> \n    <p>Daylight? Then he'd\
  \ been in the weird bubble of darkness longer than he had imagined.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ wind blew in through a little opening, upon his face. And it was a warm wind.\
  \ A warm wind and a <i>damp</i> wind, such as never blows on desert Mars.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Carse squeezed through and stood in the bright day looking outward.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There are times when a man has no emotion, no reaction. Times when all\
  \ the centers are numbed and the eyes see and the ears hear but nothing communicates\
  \ itself to the brain, which is protected in this way from madness.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ tried finally to laugh at what he saw though he heard his own laughter as a dry\
  \ choking cry.</p> \n    <p> \"Mirage, of course,\" he whispered. \"A big mirage.\
  \ Big as all Mars.\"</p> \n    <p>The warm breeze lifted Carse's tawny hair, blew\
  \ his cloak against him. A cloud drifted over the sun and somewhere a bird screamed\
  \ harshly. He did not move.</p> \n    <p>He was looking at an ocean.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ stretched out to the horizon ahead, a vast restlessness of water, milky-white\
  \ and pale with a shimmering phosphorescence even in daylight.</p> \n    <p> \"\
  Mirage,\" he said again stubbornly, his reeling mind clinging with the desperation\
  \ of fear to that one shred of explanation. \"It has to be. Because this is still\
  \ Mars.\"</p> \n    <p>Still Mars, still the same planet. The same high hills up\
  \ into which Penkawr had led him by night.</p> \n    <p>Or were they the same? Before,\
  \ the foxhole entrance to the Tomb of Rhiannon had been in a steep cliff-face. Now\
  \ he stood on the grassy slope of a great hill.</p> \n    <p>And there were rolling\
  \ green hills and dark forest down there below him, where before had been only desert.\
  \ Green hills, green wood and a bright river that ran down a gorge to what had been\
  \ dead sea-bottom but was now—sea.</p> \n    <p>Carse's numbed gaze swept along\
  \ the great coast of the distant shoreline. And down on that far sunlit coast he\
  \ saw the glitter of a white city and knew that it was Jekkara.</p> \n    <p>Jekkara,\
  \ bright and strong between the verdant hills and the mighty ocean, that ocean that\
  \ had not been seen upon Mars for nearly a million years...</p> \n   </blockquote>\
