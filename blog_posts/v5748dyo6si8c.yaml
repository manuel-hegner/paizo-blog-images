  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #187: The Seventh Arch</em></a></h3> \n      <p>When\
  \ Gatewalkers architect Patrick Renie hit me up to write for this AP, I didn’t think\
  \ I had time. Then I heard the pitch, and I made time. As the author of the Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition Campaign Settings <em>The First World</em> and <em> Distant Worlds</em>,\
  \ as well as a former Starfinder Creative Director, I've always been a sucker for\
  \ Pathfinder’s fey realm and other planets, and the chance to write an adventure\
  \ that visits both was simply irresistible. As soon as I finished writing, I immediately\
  \ turned around and launched my own Gatewalkers campaign, and I hope your group\
  \ does as much laughing and screaming as ours!</p> \n      <p>If you’re interested\
  \ in checking out more of my TTRPG work, you can find it at <a href=\"http://jameslsutter.com\"\
  >jameslsutter.com</a> —but my big release this year is actually a young adult romance\
  \ novel! <em>Darkhearts</em> is a queer rom-com all about falling in love with the\
  \ boy who stole your chance at rock stardom, and you can <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59828970-darkhearts\"\
  >preorder it now</a>!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Jason Keeley<br> <em><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-188-They-Watched-the-Stars\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #188: They Watched the Stars</a></em></h3> \n      <p>Hi,\
  \ folks! I'm Jason Keeley, game developer person and author of the second volume\
  \ of the Gatewalkers Adventure Path. I'm a big fan of \"weird stuff\" in adventures,\
  \ so I was happy to contribute to an Adventure Path that is thematically linked\
  \ to the \"weird stuff\" book, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></a>. Moreso than any other adventure I've written\
  \ for Paizo, “They Watched the Stars” is a bit of a road trip, so I got to include\
  \ a bunch of strange vignettes the players can encounter on their way from point\
  \ A to point B.</p> \n      <p>I would love to tell you more, but I don't want to\
  \ spoil the surprises in store. I will say that one of my favorite bits is the initial\
  \ encounter with a halfling ghost pirate captain and the new construct I designed\
  \ that protects their derelict ship. How's that for a tease? If you want to talk\
  \ about more weird stuff with me, you can find me on Twitter @herzwesten. And maybe\
  \ check out my free game about cereal mascots, <a href=\"https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast\"\
  ><em>This Compleat Breakfast</em></a>, available on itch.io here!</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h3>James Jacobs<br> <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy4\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #189: Dreamers of the Nameless Spires</a></em></h3> \n\
  \      <p>Hi there! I’m James Jacobs, one of Paizo’s creative directors and the\
  \ author of the Gatewalkers finale! I came to this project pretty late in the process\
  \ but was delighted to join forces with “TEAM J.” The plot of Gatewalkers—with its\
  \ ties to elves, aliens, and conspiracies—was really up my alley, but particularly\
  \ the last adventure that heads into the frozen north. Horror and cold go together\
  \ perfectly, and being able to dive into inspirations like Lovecraft’s <em>At the\
  \ Mountains of Madness</em>, John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em>, and the quest\
  \ for the Northwest Passage in Dan Simmons’s <em>The Terror</em> was a blast to\
  \ say the least, as well as drawing inspiration from real-world explorations like\
  \ Shackleton’s search for the south pole. And finally, extra thanks to Michael Sayre\
  \ for help and for getting things started with the heart of this particular story;\
  \ I hope I did it justice!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags: Community,\
