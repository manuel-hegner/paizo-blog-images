  \ \n     <p>Snow whipped around Amiri as she stepped out from behind the rock, letting\
  \ her cloak drop away. \"That's far enough.\"</p> \n     <p>The giant looked down\
  \ in surprise. Tattoos the color of woad swirled across ice-blue skin as he towered\
  \ over her, the axes in his hands taller than Amiri herself. Yet she had eyes only\
  \ for the broken horn on his helm. This was him, all right.</p> \n     <p>\"Hail,\
  \ Agmundr Jarl.\" Amiri knew it was pointless to feign diplomacy, but her employers\
  \ had been insistent. They still thought they could solve this without blood. Never\
  \ mind that blood was all that ever really solved anything. Even now, White Elk\
  \ scouts were hiding in the cliffs, watching to see if she could truly do what she\
  \ claimed. \"The White Elk Clan greets you,\" she said sternly, \"and will trade\
  \ if you wish, but your band may not enter their territory. The council forbids\
  \ it.\"</p> \n     <p>The frost giant stared for a moment, then guffawed, a thunderous\
  \ shout that threatened to bring down an avalanche and bury them both. The frozen\
  \ waterfall of his beard split in a malicious grin.</p> \n     <p>\"Forbid?\" His\
  \ voice was the groaning of glaciers. \"Prey does not forbid. Prey runs, and the\
  \ hunter pursues.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So you agree we're done talking, then.\" Amiri\
  \ unslung the sword from her back.</p> \n     <p>The jarl's grin widened as he took\
  \ in Amiri's oversized weapon. \"A giant's blade! And what will you do with that,\
  \ little ermine? Shelter beneath it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Stick around and find out.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Amiri hoisted the sword. Immediately, her biceps began to shake,\
  \ her shoulders cramping. She bit down hard, teeth grinding as she tried to steady\
  \ her traitorous muscles by sheer force of will. Yet the sword's point still bobbed\
  \ like a ship at sea.</p> \n     <p>\"You're too weak, little ermine.\" Agmundr\
  \ laughed again and spat, the spittle freezing in midair with a crack. \"And the\
  \ time for weakness has passed. The last war is nearly upon us.\"</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ it was, then. War. It had always been coming, as inevitable as the winter snows.\
  \ Amiri had known that even before accepting the White Elk Clan's offer.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Yet now she knew nothing. Red haze settled across her vision, painting\
  \ white snow a prophetic crimson. Her heart beat in her temples, a war drum throb\
  \ that flowed hot through her limbs. Pulsing. Eager.</p> \n     <p>\"Say it again,\"\
  \ she growled.</p> \n     <p>\"You're weak.\" He leered down at her, eyes alight.\
  \ \"Too weak to fight. Too weak to even make a proper slave. Nothing but dripping\
  \ fat and marrow for the cook fire.\"</p> \n     <p>The cold was a distant memory.\
  \ Inside Amiri's chest, a blast furnace opened its doors. Her ears filled with its\
  \ roar.</p> \n     <p>The sword steadied, point going as still as a rock viper.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The giant's eyes widened.</p> \n     <p>\"You're right about one thing,\
  \ Jarl.\" She smiled. \"War is coming. So let's get started.\"</p> \n     <p>Sword\
  \ held high, she raced up the slanted stone. Axes made to fell watchtowers rose\
  \ into guard position as the giant stepped back. In her hands, Amiri's giant-made\
  \ blade sang, its frost-forged steel suddenly light as a willow switch, longing\
  \ for the blood of its makers.</p> \n     <p>Around them, the storm shrieked, savage\
  \ and unstoppable.</p> \n     <p>Amiri screamed with it.</p> \n     <p>And leapt.</p>\
