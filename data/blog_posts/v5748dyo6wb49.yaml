  \ one of mutual benefit. It’s therefore no surprise when the academy calls upon\
  \ the Pathfinders to help make sure nothing terrible happens during the play that\
  \ the students will be performing at a nearby theater, the Muse of the Rose. Recently,\
  \ performances there have seen unfortunate accidents. No one has been seriously\
  \ injured, but the performances were all ultimately ruined. It's up to the PCs to\
  \ ensure that the Dacilane Academy's performance doesn't suffer the same fate, even\
