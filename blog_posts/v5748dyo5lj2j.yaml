  \ back at the Paizo office, catching up on events and developments in the world\
  \ of Pathfinder. Which accounts for the lateness of this blog, as I tried to touch\
  \ base and get a status report on some ongoing projects.</p> \n    <p>So, a few\
  \ updates!</p> \n    <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy</h2> \n    <p>Thank you to all\
  \ the volunteers that ran Pathfinder Society Academy events at Gen Con! The youth\
  \ had a blast and the program received some great attention. In reviewing the feedback,\
  \ there are a few tweaks we need to make to the program before rolling it out to\
  \ the general public. So we are pushing back release by a month or two to make sure\
  \ it is the best program we can offer. For those conventions hoping to run it in\
  \ the interim, email me and we can discuss options.</p> \n    <h2>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild Season of the Runelords Adventures 5 &amp; 6</h2> \n    <p>With the\
  \ departure of Tanis and my extended absence from the office, we had another hiccup\
  \ in the release schedule. I apologize profusely for the delay and can only say\
  \ that the goblins have really made a mess of things. We are looking at timelines,\
  \ processes, and workflow so to minimize (and hopefully remove) the issues that\
  \ arose this season.</p> \n    <h2>Venture-Officer Appointments/Information Corrections</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Now that I am back in the office I can get working on adding volunteers\
  \ to the Venture-Officer team and updating contact information. If you sent me an\
  \ email, I am working my way through the requests in the order they were received.\
  \ For those submitting applications to join the team, I am reviewing them as well\
  \ and will be in touch as soon as possible. I thank everyone for their patience!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Roleplaying Guild Guide Revision</h2> \n    <p>There is a Guide revision\
  \ in the works. Thank you to the members of the community who sent feedback on the\
  \ new format or identified issues. The team is aware of the feedback threads on\
  \ the forums and the opinions expressed therein. Sifting through the posts and emails\
  \ will take some time, as well as working the revision into our schedules, so we\
  \ do not have an anticipated release date, but it will be sooner than the launch\
  \ of Season 9!</p> \n    <h2>PAX West</h2> \n    <p>Pathfinder Society will be out\
  \ in force at PAX West this weekend at the Washington State Convention Center, Rooms\
  \ 201-203. There are still volunteer openings available on Friday Night, Sunday\
  \ Night, and Monday. If interested, contact <a href=\"mailto:taenia4000@yahoo.com?Subject=PAX%20West%20Volunteering\"\
  >Venture-Lieutenant Louis Manko Levite</a>.</p> \n    <h2>Upcoming Events</h2> \n\
  \    <p>I'm going to start spotlighting events in the weekly blog. Currently, I\
  \ am looking at events in December/January, to give enough time for people interested\
  \ in attending to book travel and accomodations. If you would like your event featured\
  \ on the blog, please send a one to two paragraph summary of the particulars, including\
  \ what, where, when, and who to contact for more information to <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\"\
  >pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n    <p>As a corollary, the Pathfinder Society\
  \ team is putting together our 2017 travel schedule. If you are hosting a convention\
  \ and would like a member of the team as a special guest at your event, please email\
  \ <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>\
  \ with the particulars. Many factors go into planning our schedules and the more\
  \ information we have, the easier to plan.</p> \n    <p>Lots more irons in the fire,\
  \ but I'm going to pause here for today. For those traveling, stay safe. And remember:\
  \ Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play\
