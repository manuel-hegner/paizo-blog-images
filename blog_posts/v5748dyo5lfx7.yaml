  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Wendy N. Wagner</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Mud, Ice,\
  \ and Blood</h2> <!-- Name of the Chapter Goes Here (this text can be deleted) -->\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Jendara\
  \ dropped onto a fallen log and eyed her companion. \"Are you ready to give up?\"\
  </span></p> \n    <p>The young man's ever-present grin widened. \"Already? We haven't\
  \ shot anything yet!\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara sighed and scrubbed mud off of one jolly\
  \ roger-tattooed hand. She'd grown tired of the stink of mud over the past two weeks.\
  \ She was used to the sea, to sailing on the trading ship <i>Milady</i>, or hunting\
  \ on the wind-battered island of Sorind that she had come to call her home. But\
  \ she and Vorrin, the <i>Milady's</i> captain, had both agreed that this summer\
  \ they'd look for new stops to add to their trade routes, and old friends in Trollheim\
  \ had convinced them to sail upriver for good deals on garnets. </p> \n    <p>Lugh\
  \ squatted down so he could meet her eye. The boy—young man, she corrected herself—\
  was nearly as big as a bear, and almost as hairy. \"You've got your cursing-the-locks\
  \ face on.\"</p> \n    <p>She sighed again. \"I just can't believe we're still waiting\
  \ for the damn locks to be fixed. It's bad enough having to sail up a <i>river</i>.\
  \ Being stuck out here in the mud is just ridiculous.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's ridiculous\
  \ is that we didn't find any ducks.\" Lugh stood up, stretched, and looked around\
  \ himself. \"The villagers said this marsh is packed with ducks and geese, but we\
  \ haven't even seen a blackbird.\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara stood up. At her feet, a\
  \ small stream ran by, hurrying toward the wide marsh she and Lugh had trekked around.\
  \ If she squinted, she could just make out the headland separating the marsh from\
  \ the solid ground the village of Big Cascade stood upon. Vorrin and the rest of\
  \ the crew were probably drinking in the village's pathetic excuse for a tavern\
  \ by now.</p> \n    <p>She turned back to Lugh. He was a new friend, a passenger\
  \ they'd taken on as a favor to his father, who ran a canvas mill in the capital\
  \ city of the Ironbound Archipelago. The <i>Milady</i> had too many sails not to\
  \ curry favor with a man like that, and besides, he'd paid them well. Lugh's family\
  \ was enormously proud of the fact that Lugh and his twin brother had been selected\
  \ for a year's service in the Blackravens, an elite border guard here on the mainland.\
  \ The brother had gone ahead while Lugh had been delayed several months by a leg\
  \ broken during the testing, and now he fairly vibrated with his eagerness to catch\
  \ up. The youth's boisterous good spirits irritated Vorrin, but Jendara didn't mind.\
  \ The boy was no great philosopher, it was true, but she enjoyed practicing her\
  \ swordplay with someone who could laugh about it afterward.</p> \n    <p>\"I don't\
  \ like this place much,\" she admitted. \"Everything feels damp and smells musty.\
  \ The clouds look so heavy, I can feel them weighing down my shoulders.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Lugh clapped her on the back. \"Let's get you back to the village. The food\
  \ might be garbage, but the ale will cheer you up.\"</p> \n    <p>The ale wasn't\
  \ much better than the food, but Jendara knew he was trying to bolster her spirits.\
  \ She gathered up her bow and quiver and led them back toward the rutted logging\
  \ road that followed the edge of the marsh. The mud sucked at their boots, and she\
  \ swore under her breath the whole way. Lugh chuckled as he pushed back a branch\
  \ of a young alder and held it aside for her to step out onto the road.</p> \n \
  \   <p>As she did, a pair of riders rounded the corner. She waved at them, a neighborly\
  \ gesture, but neither the man nor the woman looked like they could be the neighbor\
  \ of anyone in Big Cascade. The villagers earned their keep via the locks, and were\
  \ as soft as people got in the Linnorm Kingdoms. These newcomers were anything but.\
  \ A battered but polished halberd hung on side of the man's saddle, and the woman\
  \ had a fine bow slung across her back, along with an array of blades. Neither spoke\
  \ as they passed by.</p> \n    <p>\"Beautiful horses, weren't they?\" Lugh asked\
  \ Jendara. He looked after them wistfully. As methods of transit went, Jendara would\
  \ always choose a boat over a horse. </p> \n    <p>The woman turned around in her\
  \ saddle, dark eyes wide. \"Caul?\"</p> \n    <p>Lugh beamed. \"You know my brother?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She laughed. \"Merciful Desna! Caul said he had a twin, but I never\
  \ expected you'd be his copy.\" She dismounted and stuck out her hand. \"Irlu Icewine,\
  \ tracker and Blackraven. Caul's assigned to our patrol! \" </p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>A Blackraven is a force to be reckoned with.\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>Lugh's shook her hand with an exuberance that threatened to take\
  \ her arm off. Jendara stepped forward. \"Jendara Eriksson. Pleased to meet one\
  \ of the Blackravens.\"</p> \n    <p>Irlu gave her a quick glancing-over, her eyes\
  \ pausing on Jendara's belt axe and sword, then smiled. With her dark hair and dark\
  \ eyes, she didn't look like the natives of the region—she could almost pass for\
  \ Tian. But her face was open and friendly, and her handshake firm. Several dark\
  \ feathers had been woven into her hair. \"Just doing my part to keep the witches\
  \ of Irrisen and their accursed beasts out of the Linnorm Kingdoms. But any friend\
  \ of Caul's is going to be a friend of mine. Grotnir!\" she called to her companion.\
  \ \"Come down here and meet these fine folks!\"</p> \n    <p>The other Blackraven\
  \ dismounted to join them. \"I see you've found Caul's twin,\" he said, his voice\
  \ a low rumble. \"Did you get held up on your journey to Blackraven Hall? We heard\
  \ the locks were down.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You guess correctly,\" Lugh answered. \"\
  We've been waiting two weeks for the repairs to finish. Jendara and I escaped the\
  \ harbor to try our luck at duck hunting.\"</p> \n    <p>Irlu eyed their muddy clothes\
  \ and empty game bags. \"It looks like your luck failed you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It\
  \ was oddly quiet out there.\" Jendara said. </p> \n    <p>The two Blackravens exchanged\
  \ glances. Grotnir's lips tightened.</p> \n    <p>\"Do you know something?\" Jendara's\
  \ hand went immediately to the axe in her belt. Anything that upset two experienced\
  \ Blackravens was bad news.</p> \n    <p>Irlu's face darkened. \"We've been tracking\
  \ a white wolf that's already killed two of our patrol members, and injured another.\
  \ Caul's with our hurt man, maybe twenty miles back; he took him to the nearest\
  \ healer. We're headed to the logging camp up this hill, because one of the loggers\
  \ reported a sighting.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A white wolf?\" Lugh's eyebrows knitted.\
  \ \"How could a wolf kill two Blackravens?\"</p> \n    <p>Grotnir shook his head.\
  \ \"Not an ordinary wolf, son. A white wolf. Nothing natural about those. They're\
  \ bigger, smarter—they can even talk.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And they can breathe ice,\"\
  \ Irlu added. \"They use it to stun their prey.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We think it's been\
  \ through here before,\" Grotnir said. \"Another patrol passed through this area\
  \ a few months ago and dealt with a particularly vicious pair of white wolves. One\
  \ got away.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It wouldn't have if I'd been on that patrol,\" Irlu\
  \ snapped. \"Their tracker ought to be ashamed of himself.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Are\
  \ the white wolves a big problem in this area?\" Jendara asked. There weren't any\
  \ such creatures on Sorrind. She knew this part of the Linnorm Kingdoms had more\
  \ than its share of dangerous creatures, but this beast was one she'd never encountered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"They're nomadic,\" Grotnir said. \"But they're bad news. If that logger\
  \ really saw a white wolf, the people of Big Cascade don't even know the kind of\
  \ trouble they're in.\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara cocked her head. \"We've been standing\
  \ here talking for a good ten minutes. That's long enough for most birds to stop\
  \ worrying about a person's presence. Why haven't we heard any?\"</p> \n    <p>Grotnir's\
  \ eyes narrowed. \"You're right.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Help! Please, help!\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Lugh stared up the road. \"What the—\"</p> \n    <p>A woman raced down the\
  \ hill toward them, her brown jacket streaked with blood. She tripped on a rock\
  \ and fell hard. With a little cry, she jumped back to her feet and kept running.\
  \ \"Help!\" </p> \n    <p>Lugh raced forward and caught the woman as she stumbled\
  \ again. \"Are you all right?\"</p> \n    <p>She gasped for air. Blisters dappled\
  \ the left side of her face and the skin was puffy and pink, as if she'd been splattered\
  \ with hot oil. \"Something attacked the camp,\" she managed to say, although it\
  \ clearly hurt to talk. </p> \n    <p>Irlu balled her hands into fists. \"The white\
  \ wolf.\" </p> \n    <p>The woman's fingers went to her cheek. \"Its breath burns,\
  \ it's so cold.\"</p> \n    <p>Grotnir was digging in his saddlebags. He tossed\
  \ Lugh a container. \"Ointment. Help her.\" He caught Irlu's eye. \"We've got to\
  \ get to that camp.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Most of us are still in the woods—it's just\
  \ cooks and them's too sick to work today. I'm not sure they can hold it off much\
  \ longer.\" The woman winced as Lugh slathered the cream on her face.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Irlu swung up onto her saddle. She looked unhappy. \"Looks like we caught up\
  \ with it after all.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Finally.\" Grotnir smiled without humor. \"\
  No beast brings down a Blackraven and lives.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We'll help!\" Lugh\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>Irlu frowned. \"You're not a Blackraven yet, boy.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"We can tend the wounded,\" Jendara said. \"If you've got supplies.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Me too,\" the logger added. The presence of four armed warriors seemed\
  \ to have calmed her. \"The beast took us by surprise, but with you four...\" She\
  \ began marching back up the hill toward camp, her mouth set tightly. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"The white wolf is probably gone already. They prefer sneak attacks to drawn\
  \ battles. I'll go ahead.\" Irlu urged her horse into a quick trot and raced past\
  \ the woman.</p> \n    <p>\"I don't like this,\" Grotnir growled at Jendara. \"\
  I should send you back to Big Cascade for reinforcements.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Let's\
  \ take stock of the situation, and if need be, I'll head back to town and organize\
  \ a hunting party,\" Jendara told him.</p> \n    <p>He rubbed his beard and gave\
  \ her a measuring glance. At last he said, \"Well enough. Irlu's right—the beast's\
  \ probably disappeared already. Let's go.\"</p> \n    <p>The hill climbed sharply\
  \ away from the marshes and lowlands of the Rimeflow River valley. The country here\
  \ was rugged, all craggy hills and steep ravines. The dense evergreen forest crowded\
  \ down to the edges of the logging road, a muddy track cut out of the woods, just\
  \ wide enough for a horse-drawn skid. When the locks were up and running, the road\
  \ was probably much busier. Lots of barges and small craft went up and down the\
  \ Rimeflow, and the towns and cities of the Linnorm Kingdoms were hungry for quality\
  \ timber. These trees, no matter how dark and ominous they might feel to Jendara\
  \ at this moment, were worth a great deal.</p> \n    <p>The woman from the logging\
  \ camp gave Jendara a sidelong glance. \"You're no Blackraven.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No,\" Jendara answered. \"Just a sailor out for some hunting.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ woman put out her hand. \"I'm Nola. Good meeting you.\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara shook\
  \ on it. Nola gave her a smile, and fell silent, lost in her own thoughts. As Grotnir's\
  \ horse pulled ahead of the three walkers, Jendara peered into the woods. The late\
  \ morning sunlight that dappled the logging road ended at its edges. The forest\
  \ beyond sat in twilight gloom.</p> \n    <p>A thin, piercing howl split the air.\
  \ Nola went pale.</p> \n    <p>\"The beast!\"</p> \n    <p>She broke into a run.\
  \ Lugh tore after her.</p> \n    <p>Jendara walked faster, the hairs on her neck\
  \ prickling. Everything felt wrong about this situation. The too-quiet forest, the\
  \ attack on the logging camp, and now the wolf's triumphant call. She unslung her\
  \ bow and pulled free an arrow.</p> \n    <p>The road went up one last switchback\
  \ and then widened out into the logging camp, a cleared space filled with at least\
  \ a dozen canvas-sided tent cabins. People darted from tent to tent. Someone screamed\
  \ in pain. Over the top of it all, the panicked braying of mules added a cacophonous\
  \ note.</p> \n    <p>Jendara stood on the edge of the madness, unsure where to go\
  \ or how to even start to help. She couldn't see Irlu's horse or Grotnir's, and\
  \ Lugh was nowhere to be seen.</p> \n    <p>The wolf's call resounded again, and\
  \ the earth shook beneath Jendara's feet.</p> \n    <p>With a tremendous crashing\
  \ noise, the stand of trees on the far side of camp burst into splinters as a boulder\
  \ blasted through it. The massive stone bounced once, twice, and landed in the middle\
  \ of the road, just inches from Jendara. Her heart lurched and she stumbled backward.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A club the size of a small tree smashed down on a tent at the edge of\
  \ camp. Jendara stared at it.</p> \n    <p>\"Hill giant!\" someone screamed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Somewhere nearby, the wolf howled again.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
