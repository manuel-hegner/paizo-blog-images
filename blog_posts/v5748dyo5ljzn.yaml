  >Today on the blog I want to talk about Starfinder. Just kidding, I'm here to talk\
  \ about a Golarion that's still around and some of the things that shaped it thousands\
  \ of years in its past. I'm here to talk about Azlanti long before they had a star\
  \ empire. More specifically, I'm here to talk about the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\"\
  >Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path</a> that drops this August at GenCon.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\">Ruins of Azlant Adventure\
  \ Path</a> takes place in the Arcadian Ocean in a small cluster of islands hundreds\
  \ of miles west of the Inner Sea region where the continent of Azlant once stood\
  \ over 10,000 years ago—before the alghollthu drew meteors from the vacuum of space\
  \ in an attempt to wipe humanity from the face of Golarion. While most of what was\
  \ Azlant was shattered and sunk beneath the waves, scattered islands poke above\
  \ the surface, and some ruins of the ancient civilization remain nearly as they\
  \ were thousands of years ago. Some islands host an abundance of life that has reclaimed\
  \ the surviving pieces of the broken continent.</p> \n    <p>In this Adventure Path,\
  \ the PCs are part of an expedition to establish a colony called Talmandor's Bounty\
  \ on an island named Ancorato. This endeavor is a partnership between the nation\
  \ of Andoran and the Bountiful Venture Company, an Andoren finance company based\
  \ out of Almas. The company spread the word of the expedition far and wide looking\
  \ for the best of what the Inner Sea could offer to take part in this groundbreaking\
  \ venture. Those who answered the call sat for interviews where they explained what\
  \ they could bring to a fledgling colony to help it not only survive but thrive.\
  \ Among these hopefuls are the heroes of this tale—your characters. Leadership in\
  \ the Bountiful Venture Company found something special about the skills and talents\
  \ of each of the PCs in their vetting process, and selected them to join the second\
  \ wave of colonists headed for Talmandor's Bounty to bring more supplies and double\
  \ the population of the colony.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ and Roberto Pitturru</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The campaign begins with the\
  \ PCs, and other eager colonists, standing on the deck of the Peregrine, the ship\
  \ that brought them from the port in Almas to their new home. As the ship enters\
  \ a wide bay and tacks toward the nascent Talmandor's Bounty, something doesn't\
  \ seem right. The chimneys of the buildings tucked behind a partially built palisade\
  \ give off no smoke. Peering through a spyglass reveals that no one walks among\
  \ the wood and stone houses, and as the ship draws closer, the settlement is utterly\
  \ silent. Something has happened to the first group of colonists.</p> \n    <p>If\
  \ you want to find out what happened to the colonists and explore the lore of ancient\
  \ Azlant, apply now* to the Bountiful Venture Company and see the wonders of a new\
  \ world reclaimed from cataclysm!</p> \n    <p>During the course of this Adventure\
  \ Path you get a glimpse into how some people dealt with the final days of the Azlanti\
  \ Empire and a chance to see how some parts of Azlanti society worked. Just some\
  \ of the articles in this Adventure Path include an ecology of the Azlanti's greatest\
  \ enemy, a look at the gods that the Azlanti worshiped, a gazetteer of the region\
  \ as it stands today, information on the Mordant Spire, other secrets of Azlant,\
  \ and much more. The Adventure Path bestiary includes monsters native to the region,\
  \ weird animals and plants you could find there, and a few newly discovered additions\
  \ to the alghollthu family.</p> \n    <p><i>*Applications available** by pre-ordering,\
