  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Among piles of stacked books,\
  \ Marbrook heard the tingle of the front door chimes. The front door whose OPEN\
  \ sign clearly faced inward. The pair of entrants, a goblin in goggles and a human\
  \ with a coat and cane, made themselves at home browsing the bookstore’s shelves.\
  \ Or they were casing the joint to rob. If they were going to rob her later, they\
  \ would be the second most audacious thieves Marbrook had ever witnessed. The most\
  \ audacious thieves, meanwhile, were those the two would be if they were to rob\
  \ her in this very inconvenient moment.</p>\n      <p>The bookseller suppressed\
  \ a huff, feeling her bleaching subside from the annoyance. There were greater challenges\
  \ at hand. Ages ago, someone had rearranged her entire store’s inventory. While\
  \ it was a hilarious prank, Marbrook would rather eject her soul back to the First\
  \ World than run her shop out of alphabetical order. This created her current impasse:\
  \ ignore the intruders or stop replacing the books momentarily.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ choice was obvious. Marbrook let the intruders be, as they were entranced by the\
  \ books floating about the store and seemed to pose little immediate threat. The\
  \ spectral assistants responsible for that spectacle, which she remembered neither\
  \ hiring nor requesting, were both a blessing and a curse. They were handy at keeping\
  \ the shop tidy, and less so in put the books back in order.</p>\n      <p>The human\
  \ of the pair waved at the spectral figures. “Hello! Pardon our intrusion.” The\
  \ spirits said nothing back. “I don’t think they can help us,” the human concluded,\
  \ stroking a trimmed beard.</p>\n      <p>“Not for talking. For cleaning, maybe?”\
  \ the goblin guessed.</p>\n      <p>“The store <em>is</em> spotless. Maybe she planned\
  \ a holiday,” said the human. “They are moving the books about rather… unnecessarily,\
  \ however.”</p>\n      <p>The goblin pointed to the corner furthest away. “Fumbus\
  \ will start over there.” The human watched Fumbus skitter away before realizing\
  \ the goblin meant to search for the source of these ethereal spirits. Following\
  \ his example, the human strolled to the other far corner. With this division of\
  \ labor, Marbrook reckoned she had three minutes before she needed to decide which\
  \ of the two tomes immediately at hand would best suffice as a weapon: the <em>Revised\
  \ History of Taldor, 28th Edition</em>, or <em>Encyclopedia Chelaxia</em>, volume\
  \ 18.</p>\n      <p>Long before that time came, Marbrook heard the familiar squeak\
  \ of the floorboard from the center of the shop. She did not suppress her huff this\
  \ time. She meant to fix that loose board, except books happened.</p>\n      <p>“\
  Quinn!” Fumbus shouted, probably meaning the human. Quinn strode over, footsteps\
  \ crisp and measured. This was followed by whispers, then the rustling of a backpack,\
  \ then the groan and splintering of floorboards. Quinn vocalized dismay. Fumbus\
  \ oopsed.</p>\n      <p>Marbrook stood like a war god roused to battle. She watched\
  \ from behind her book pile as Quinn reached into the new hole in her precious floorboards\
  \ to pull out a bowl of… blue stuff. Marbrook had not put that bowl there. Or rather,\
  \ she did not remember doing so. Maybe her bleaching caused a memory lapse, but\
  \ somehow, that blame felt misplaced.</p>\n      <p>“A ritual.” Quinn drew a sharp\
  \ breath. “For… spirit custodians?”</p>\n      <p>“It can last a year.” Fumbus poked\
  \ the inside the bowl and made a face at the squish. The goblin then sniffed the\
  \ bowl, and made a different face. Finally, Fumbus licked the blue stuff. A wide\
  \ smile appeared. “This one is fresh. Three months.”</p>\n      <p>“That lines up.\
  \ Now, until the duration expires, the spirits continue their task unless ordered\
  \ otherwise. If I recall correctly, it usually gave you one, two, three…” Quinn\
  \ trailed off. There were only three assistants to count. “Fumbus, have you heard\
  \ any gossip lately?”</p>\n      <p>Marbrook did not know why Quinn changed the\
  \ subject, but she did sheathe her inner war god. Reorganizing the books had kept\
  \ her indoors and away from the gossip on the street for too long. Long enough she\
  \ suspected she had bleached a shade. If these intruders were about to share some\
  \ juicy secrets, she would very much like them to continue. She might even forgive\
  \ them for the floorboards.</p>\n      <p>When Fumbus replied “I have. I saw some,”\
  \ Marbrook rejoiced. The bookseller crept out of her book fortress, adjusting a\
  \ small pile of rummaged paperwork as she passed.</p>\n      <p>Quinn sounded equally\
  \ delighted. “Excellent! What have you heard?”</p>\n      <p>“Orange worms!”</p>\n\
  \      <p>The goblin looked expectantly at his companion, whose blank stare rivaled\
  \ Fumbus’s own emotionless goggles. It gave Marbrook time to settle in for a good\
  \ view, and put more paper away. “You don’t say?”</p>\n      <p>“Yes, while <em>you\
  \ </em>were talking to the jeweler about whatever, <em>I </em>was listening to the\
  \ gardeners tending the shop’s flower box. And do you know what Fumbus heard? The\
  \ orange worms are back, and <em>that </em>means the ebon rooks will be back, and\
  \ you know what <em>that </em>means!” Quinn clearly didn’t, but while he had initially\
  \ tried to ignore his yammering companion, the passion with which Fumbus recounted\
  \ the tale pulled him away from his distractions. Marbrook was equally rapt. What\
  \ could the goblin be going on about?</p>\n      <p>For the better part of five\
  \ minutes, the goblin barely paused to take a breath as he led Quinn and Marbrook\
  \ down a roundabout stream of consciousness—some overheard, some observed, and much\
  \ seemingly coming from the random recesses of his overactive mind. Rooks. String.\
  \ The best cucumbers to pickle in this part of the country this time of year. An\
  \ annoying Isgeri folk song stuck in his head. Some alternate lyrics to that song.\
  \ Something about soil composition. Bird droppings (employing rather rude language,\
  \ if Marbrook was being honest).</p>\n      <p>When he reached what seemed the logical\
  \ conclusion of his line of reasoning, he once again stared intently at Quinn. After\
  \ a long, expectant moment, Quinn said, “Yes, I see.”</p>\n      <p>Fumbus’s mouth\
  \ gaped open. “You do <em>not </em>see, Quinn! The orange worms mean the soil is\
  \ especially rich in phosphorus, and the <em>droppings—</em>” (again with the language)\
  \ “—of the rooks after they <em>eat </em>the worms makes the perfect reagent for\
  \ longer burning <em>fire</em>.”</p>\n      <p>“Ah,” Quinn interjected, clearly\
  \ hoping this was the end of it. Marbrook got the sense that this was not the sort\
  \ of “gossip” he’d had in mind when he inquired, and it certainly wasn’t what she’\
  d hoped to overhear.</p>\n      <p>“But!” Fumbus jabbed a finger at his friend.\
  \ “This isn’t the first time Quinn has missed something so obvious to Fumbus.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>Quinn, clearly wanting to escape the conversation, held up the bowl. “\
  So, rituals need help—\"</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  >Pathfinder Player Core 2</a></em></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Fumbus,\
  \ like a flame running out of fuel, lowered his arm and deflated, finally pausing\
  \ to catch his breath. “Was… that enough?”</p>\n      <p>“More than enough. You\
  \ did great.” Quinn squeezed out an assurance. “I think we know now which one of\
  \ our friendly spirits here is the gossip-loving grandmother. I saw some papers\
  \ instead of books being moved.” Quinn turned and looked straight at Marbrook. Into\
  \ Marbrook.</p>\n      <p>“Also flinched when I swore.” Fumbus too met her gaze.\
  \ The red-tinted googles reflected… nothing. No bleachling gnome, nor gossip-loving\
  \ elderly bookseller. Just red glass with a spot of ethereal blue light.</p>\n \
  \     <p>A blush of embarrassment, of being caught eavesdropping, washed over Marbrook.\
  \ Then came an emptiness—ethereal, spirit, void, death. Cold reality sank, disbelief\
  \ hollowed. Blurred emotions unnamed, the swirl reverberated like a bell toll echoing\
  \ <em>dead, dead, dead</em> in crescendo.</p>\n      <p>Marbrook screamed.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"50%\">\n      </center>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <p>Goosebumps ran up Quinn’s arm as the moan crawled under his skin. Beside\
  \ him, Fumbus strangled a shriek. The ghost of Marbrook the bookseller, now in her\
  \ shape in life, closed the distance. Quinn saw a missing eye, a slashed throat,\
  \ and through the translucent body, a stab wound in the back. Such death would make\
  \ a ghost of anyone, and make them want to forget it happened.</p>\n      <p>Crash!\
  \ Glass shattered upon the ghost. Drops sizzled on the floor. Fumbus had retreated\
  \ a distance, then improvised some acid from among his carried reagents to throw.\
  \ Quinn was thankful the alchemist’s aim spared him, still beside the ghost, from\
  \ collateral damage. He was also thankful Fumbus didn’t throw his usual alchemist\
  \ fire. Not that it mattered against the ghost. Neither would have worked.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Quinn made his own retreat, thinking. They were ill-equipped and without\
  \ backup. No blessed weapons, no holy water, no cleric. How do you fight a ghost\
  \ under such circumstances? An intimately familiar voice in his mind answered, <em>“\
  you don’t fight if you can help it; you try talking</em>.”</p>\n      <p>What should\
  \ one talk to a livid ghost about? Hello there, may I inquire why you are a ghost?\
  \ What tragedy befell you? With this bookstore, there were no signs of a struggle,\
  \ no blood suggesting violence, not even a corpse. The shop was immaculately clean\
  \ without even a speck of dust— unless it had not always been so.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ custodians. Their erratic shelving of the books. Quinn looked for the spirits.\
  \ All three were gathered about the acid damage and broken glass, prodding at the\
  \ stains and sweeping. Fumbus was right. The ritual <em>was</em> for cleaning. Cleaning\
  \ up evidence, specifically. What “clean” means beyond stains and messes can be\
  \ ambiguous. In some languages, clean also conveyed “to tidy” or “to organize”.\
  \ One command, and you could not only erase evidence of a crime, but also make a\
  \ store look as if its owner was still about, just… reorganizing inventory.</p>\n\
  \      <p>This was no normal crime, nor an average criminal. This was a professional.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Across the room, Fumbus shrieked with a gurgle, running away from a pursuing\
  \ Marbrook as he downed a vial of red liquid. Quinn stowed the rudimentary criminal\
  \ profile away. The plan for the immediate moment: One, talk Marbrook down from\
  \ violence; two, ask questions without prolonging her suffering; three, leave this\
  \ place alive with Fumbus.</p>\n      <p>Just in case, Quinn made an alternative\
  \ plan which skipped to step three. There were some rook droppings he needed to\
  \ make sure Fumbus had a chance to collect.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n     <p style=\"\
