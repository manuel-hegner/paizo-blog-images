  \ of Golarion</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 2, 2009</p> \n   <p>One\
  \ of the perks about being an intern at Paizo is that I have the privilege of reading\
  \ and editing Pathfinder material that I would normally peruse in my free time.\
  \ In my first week here at Paizo, in fact, I was handed a manuscript for an article\
  \ that will be appearing in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy84bf\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path</i> volume #21</a>, \"The Jackal's Price.\" This article describes\
  \ the various cultures of genies and legends surrounding geniekind, and should prove\
  \ very useful for those GMs seeking to expand their players' encounters with these\
  \ mythological creatures in the Legacy of Fire Adventure Path. I had a chance to\
  \ speak with Wes recently about the historical and mythological sources that were\
  \ referenced in the creation of Golarion's genies.</p> \n   <p>One of the most comprehensive\
  \ sources is <i>The Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern Mythology and Religion</i> by\
  \ Jan Knappert. In the pages of this reference guide, sandwiched between the entries\
  \ for <i>Jilani</i> and <i>Jiris</i> (the Arabic form of the name George, apparently),\
  \ is a fairly long explanation of <i>jinns</i>. Knappert explains that in Islamic\
  \ countries, spirits are divided among jinns, <i>shaytans</i>, <i>ifrits</i>, and\
  \ <i>marids</i>, and that in Ancient Persia some jinns and other evil spirits were\
  \ referred to as <i>div</i> (which also have a role as a new breed of fiends in\
  \ Legacy of Fire). The entry goes on to illustrate examples of genies from myth,\
  \ for instance, Knappert explains that many jinns \"have ugly and terrifying forms\"\
  \ as a result of God's curse for copulating with animals.</p> \n   <p>Another source\
  \ that was referenced is <i>Everyman's Dictionary of Non-Classical Mythology</i>\
  \ by Egerton Sykes. Among other things, this book was used as a reference to further\
  \ develop the shaitans, the new earth-based genie that was created as a replacement\
  \ for closed-content earth genies. The brief entry explains that <i>shaitan</i>\
  \ was the Islamic name for devil, and the it also \"applied to the third species\
  \ of jinn.\"</p> \n   <p>Wikipedia also proved to be an invaluable font of (sometimes\
  \ questionable) knowledge about genies and Middle Eastern mythology in general.\
  \ In the entry for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >ifrit</a>, for example, an ifrit is described as \"an enormous winged creature\
  \ of smoke, either male or female, who lives underground and frequents ruins.\"\
  \ The entry goes on to explain, \"While ordinary weapons and forces have no power\
  \ over them, they are susceptible to magic, which humans can use to kill them or\
  \ to capture and enslave them.\" Already sounding like RPG text, entries like this\
  \ can do a lot to spark GMs' imaginations.</p> \n   <p>Hopefully these sources can\
  \ serve as a launching pad for your own investigations into the nature of the always-unpredictable\
  \ and dangerous genies and can inspire you to flesh out the nature of genies in\
  \ your own games. You can also look forward to a detailed exploration of genies\
  \ and their society showing up in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #21. Also\
  \ check out Jesper Ejsing's djinni illustration appearing on the cover of that volume.\
  \ He starts a series of four cover characters who, while not necessarily specific\
  \ personalities in the Adventure Path, epitomize the genies featuring prominently\
  \ in each.</p> \n   <p>David Eitelbach <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote>\
