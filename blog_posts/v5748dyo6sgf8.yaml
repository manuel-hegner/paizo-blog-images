  description\">December brings us two scenarios dealing with artifacts that play\
  \ a vital role in the story of the Pathfinder Society, and perhaps in the future\
  \ of Golarion itself (not to oversell you on the importance of playing these adventures\
  \ or anything)!</p> \n    <p>The first scenario I'll be talking about is <a href=\"\
  /products/btq01vpl?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1010-The-Shattered-Shield\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #10-10: The Shattered Shield</i></a>, a Tier 1-5 scenario that\
  \ takes the Pathfinders back to the nation of Rahadoum, where organized religion\
  \ is banned and merely being found to possess religious iconography, like a cleric's\
  \ holy symbol, can result in stiff fines or even banishment for repeat offenders.\
  \ Searching for a stolen religious artifact in Rahadoum can prove a challenge, and\
  \ the Pathfinders will find that very few of Rahadoum's citizens are interested\
  \ in making things any easier for them.</p> \n    <p>Adventures in Rahadoum can\
  \ prove difficult, both for the adventurers who must navigate the delicate political\
  \ landscape where some of their most common and vital tools are banned, and for\
  \ the writers who have to make an adventure in such a volatile environment work.\
  \ Fortunately Paizo editor and adventure author Leo Glass rose to the occasion,\
  \ providing an adventure that is both challenging and rewarding. Illicit auctions,\
  \ attempted assassinations, and twisted games of chance all build towards a confrontation\
  \ where the stakes are far greater than they seem. Of course, no adventure is complete\
  \ without memorable friends and foes! I'll let you guess which camp this cloaked\
  \ figure and her poppet fit into.</p> \n    <p>If artifact hunting in the secular\
  \ lands of Rahadoum doesn't strike your fancy, fear not! We've got something a bit\
  \ weirder for our more experienced Pathfinders. <a href=\"/products/btq01vpr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1011-The-Hao-Jin-Hierophant\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-11: The Hao Jin Hierophant</i></a> is a Tier\
  \ 5-9 scenario that explores the Society's efforts inside the Hao Jin Tapestry following\
  \ the events of this year's interactive special <i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-00:\
  \ The Hao Jin Cataclysm</i>. This story will be continued in January with <a href=\"\
  /products/btq01wkq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1013-Fragments-of-Antiquity\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #10-13: Fragments of Antiquity</i></a><i>, </i>and developed\
  \ even further in February with <a href=\"/products/btq01wln?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1015-Tapestry-s-Trial\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-15: Tapestry's Trial</i></a>. The Society has\
  \ fought many bitter battles, both for possession of the magical artifact known\
  \ as the <i>Hao Jin Tapestry</i> and within the eponymous demiplane it contains.\
  \ These battles have weakened the magical fabric of the tapestry to the very breaking\
  \ point, and now no one among the Pathfinders can be certain how much time the tapestry\
  \ has left before it unravels once and for all.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Michele Giorgi</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Traveling\
  \ into the Hao Jin Tapestry, the PCs are tasked with recovering the lore and artifacts\
  \ of an ancient Tian culture all but lost from Golarion. Complications arise as\
  \ the PCs discover the fate of an old ally and wander into a deadly diversion whose\
  \ seeds were planted by an old foe. Adding even more to the challenge, the tapestry\
  \ itself strains to hold its threads together, and strange planar storms and weirder\
  \ phenomena abound! Fortunately adventure author Jessica Redekop was more than up\
  \ to the task of exploring time bubbles, disappearing landscapes, and evil extraplanar\
  \ vegetation! Even if the PCs successfully navigate the hazards laid before them,\
  \ they must still face the steel (or obsidian) of the deadly Hao Jin Hierophant,\
  \ portrayed below by artist Michele Giorgi!</p> \n    <p>We hope you have as much\
  \ fun playing and running these as we had in developing them. Coming up in the next\
  \ several months, we'll be continuing the Hao Jin Tapestry storyline and traveling\
  \ to the far edges of the Inner Sea region!</p> \n    <p>Michael Sayre<br> <i>Organized\
  \ Play Developer</i></p> \n   </div>\n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Michele Giorgi,\
