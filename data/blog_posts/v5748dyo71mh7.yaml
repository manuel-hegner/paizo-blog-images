  \ Loza here!&nbsp;You might have heard that we will be unleashing a massive flight\
  \ of brand-new dragons with the upcoming releases of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0e3k3?Pathfinder-Monster-Core-2\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Monster Core 2</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0e5vf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Draconic-Codex\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Draconic Codex</em></a>. While I love previewing new\
  \ dragons and showing them off one by one like an excited grandfather sharing the\
  \ mass of pictures in his wallet, I won’t be able to do that this time around. Unfortunately,\
  \ we have too many new dragons! With that in mind, the plan is still to preview\
  \ a few dragons over the coming weeks and even give some behind-the-scenes insight\
  \ by sharing the concept art by our very own incredible concept artist, Kent Hamilton.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Our first preview focuses on some of the dragons found in <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Monster Core 2</em>. As some of you may know, our dragons are broken into one\
  \ of four classifications based on the four magical traditions. This time, I’m going\
  \ to showcase a new arcane and a new primal dragon.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div\

  \ and long horns.\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by Kent\
  \ Hamilton</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>This big fella is a rune dragon,\
  \ an arcane dragon with the power to create and manipulate runes. Runes are an important\
  \ part of magic in Pathfinder, and these dragons have an innate control over these\
  \ powerful symbols. A rune dragon’s scales are thick and feature natural runes,\
  \ as well as runes the dragon inscribes themself. These scales are effectively <em>runestones</em>\
  \ and would-be dragon slayers can use these scales to transfer runes to their equipment\
  \ like they would any other <em>runestone</em>.</p>\n      <p>A rune dragon can\
  \ shift the power of the runes on their scale, attuning the runes to a particular\
  \ energy to grant the dragon an immunity to the likes of acid, cold, electricity,\
  \ fire, or sonic damage. In addition to claws and sharp fangs, a rune dragon creates\
  \ runes during combat. They can create an explosive rune and place it on a creature,\
  \ later detonating it for a blast of the same type of damage attuned to their body.\
  \ Instead of a typical breath, a rune dragon’s breath places several runes on creatures\
  \ in a cone and immediately detonates them. As they grow in age and power, a rune\
  \ dragon gains the ability to create other runes with different effects.</p>\n \
  \     <p><em>Pathfinder Monster Core 2</em> also features the phase dragon, an arcane\
  \ dragon with power over teleportation magic that can blink around the battlefield\
  \ and teleport their foes away.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ shape, red coloration, and thick, sharp horns. The sketch includes a close-up\
  \ look of the dragon’s features.\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration\
  \ by Kent Hamilton</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The other dragon we’\
  re looking at today is the cinder dragon, a primal dragon with a focus on fire.\
  \ The cinder dragon fills the roles of older dragons that were known for being red.\
  \ Like their legacy counterparts, cinder dragons are all about fire, but we decided\
  \ to turn that knob up to 11 this time around. Their pyre breath not only deals\
  \ fire damage, but can also set creatures on fire and fills the area with obscuring\
  \ smoke. If a nearby creature is on fire, the cinder dragon can stoke the flames\
  \ and cause them to burn intensely for a moment, causing the creature to take their\
  \ persistent fire damage once more.</p>\n      <p>As they grow in power, cinder\
  \ dragons have greater control over fire. Ancient cinder dragons are capable of\
  \ cursing a creature to transform all of the damage they would cause into fire damage.\
  \ This is an indiscriminate curse, turning the damage from a fighter’s sword or\
  \ a sorcerer’s ice spell into fire alike. It turns out that while it might look\
  \ cool, dealing nothing but fire damage isn’t particularly helpful against a cinder\
  \ dragon!</p>\n      <p>The other found primal dragon in <em>Pathfinder Monster\
  \ Core 2 </em>is the coral dragon, aquatic dragons that live around coral reefs.\
  \ A coral dragon can unleash blasts of water and even meld into their bonded reef\
  \ to travel great distances.</p>\n      <p>That’s all the dragons we can share for\
  \ now. Senior Developer Eleanor Ferron and I will continue to share more in the\
  \ coming weeks, and I hope all you fans of dragons look forward to more previews.\
  \ See you then!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
