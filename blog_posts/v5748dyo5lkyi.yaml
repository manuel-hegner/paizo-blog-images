  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As the Pathfinder Playtest begins,\
  \ Game Masters will need to quickly get up to speed with the new rules. The Game\
  \ Mastering chapter of the <a href=\"/products/btpya0ae?Pathfinder-Playtest-Rulebook-Hardcover\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i></a> is here to help you out! It covers the\
  \ responsibilities of a GM, gives advice on running sessions, and teaches you how\
  \ to adjudicate the rules of the game. Because this is a playtest, there aren't\
  \ details about creating your own campaign or adventures, but rest assured, this\
  \ information will appear in the Pathfinder Second Edition rulebook!</p> \n    <h2>Running\
  \ Modes of Play</h2> \n    <p>A large section of the Game Mastering chapter runs\
  \ through the special concerns of running the three modes of play: encounters, exploration,\
  \ and downtime. The specific rules governing those modes appear in the Playing the\
  \ Game chapter, so this chapter instead talks about how to set the pace of the game\
  \ as you GM. Exploration and downtime get the most focus here, since most the rules\
  \ for running encounters are addressed in Playing the Game. The section on exploration\
  \ goes over exploration tactics characters might adopt, and gives advice on what\
  \ to do when players want to choose tactics that aren't included in the default\
  \ options. It also addresses how to begin and end encounters, including some advice\
  \ on how to use the new initiative rules of the playtest. The section on downtime\
  \ shows you how to play out a single downtime day at the table, and how to cover\
  \ long periods of downtime quickly and keep them interesting. It also talks about\
  \ buying and selling items and retraining abilities.</p> \n    <h2>Difficulty Classes</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Setting DCs is one of your major tasks as GM, and the rulebook covers\
  \ how to create two different types of DCs: those that are appropriate for a certain\
  \ level and those that are static challenges in the world. This first category is\
  \ great when you need the DC of an obstacle created by an enemy of a certain level\
  \ but don't have all their statistics, when you set the DC to Craft an item of a\
  \ particular level, and so on. Levels and categories of difficulty are given in\
  \ a table so you can pick a DC quickly. The level is based on your opposition's\
  \ level, and the category depends on the particular situation. Here's a portion\
  \ of that table.</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block indent\" style=\"width: 350px;\"\
  > \n     <table class=\"table-spacing-large\"> \n      <thead>\n       <tr>\n  \
  \      <th><b>Level</b></th>\n        <th><b>Trivial</b></th>\n        <th><b>Low</b></th>\n\
  \        <th><b>High</b></th>\n        <th><b>Severe</b></th>\n        <th><b>Extreme</b></th>\n\
  \       </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n       <tr>\n        <td>0</td>\n\
  \        <td> 9</td>\n        <td>10</td>\n        <td>12</td>\n        <td>14</td>\n\
  \        <td>17</td>\n       </tr> \n       <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>10</td>\n\
  \        <td>12</td>\n        <td>14</td>\n        <td>15</td>\n        <td>18</td>\n\
  \       </tr> \n       <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td>11</td>\n        <td>13</td>\n\
  \        <td>15</td>\n        <td>16</td>\n        <td>19</td>\n       </tr>\n \
  \     </tbody>\n     </table>\n    </div> \n    <p>Static challenges are everything\
  \ from climbing a tree to identifying a minor noble. These tasks don't really get\
  \ more difficult if the PCs are higher level, but can still be expressed in terms\
  \ of level and difficulty category. The guidelines explain how to select a level\
  \ and category of difficulty. For instance, climbing a rope that's hanging in mid-air\
  \ is a level 1 task, so it's normally a high DC (14), but it might have a low DC\
  \ (12) if you can brace yourself against a wall while climbing through a narrow\
  \ area, and maybe even a trivial DC (10) if you can brace against two walls. Because\
  \ static DCs don't increase as the PCs advance in levels, eventually low-level static\
  \ tasks will become nearly automatic for them. We give guidelines here for GMs crafting\
  \ their own adventures, but it's ultimately up to them what level and DC tasks are.\
  \ (In published adventures, this information is still provided.)</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ you can see, the rules for DCs intentionally put far more choice in your hands\
  \ as the GM. Rather than having a long list of DCs and modifiers pre-defined, we\
  \ wanted to let the GM assess the particulars of any given situation and then use\
  \ some simple tools to set the DC, rather than needing to calculate a DC based on\
  \ rules that aren't always exactly suitable to the challenge facing the players.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This section also speaks to some particular categories of skill DCs for\
  \ crafting, gathering Information, performing for an audience, practicing a trade\
  \ with Lore, recalling knowledge with skills like Arcana or Lore, or training an\
  \ animal.</p> \n    <h2>Rewards</h2> \n    <p>This section contains some rules not\
  \ directly related to <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, but that we want people to take a look\
  \ at and use if they create their own campaigns during the playtest. One thing that\
  \ shows up is rules on awarding Experience Points. This includes XP awards for accomplishments,\
  \ so that you'll have guidance for when the group pulls off important tasks that\
  \ aren't encounters or hazards. As noted previously, it normally takes 1,000 XP\
  \ to level up, but there are also options for varying the players' advancement speed\
  \ by having a new level every 800 XP or 1,200 XP. If you're playtesting your own\
  \ campaign, you might want to have characters level up every 800 XP so you get a\
  \ chance to playtest more levels of the game!</p> \n    <h2>Environment and Hazards</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The last section of the Game Mastering chapter briefly summarizes environments\
  \ and the rules for hazards (such as traps, environmental dangers, and haunts).\
  \ These are covered in more detail in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</i>. They'll\
  \ be in the final version of Pathfinder Second Edition's core rulebook, but the\
  \ <i>Playtest Rulebook</i> didn't have quite enough space for the whole thing!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Are you looking forward to GMing playtest games? What changes are you\
  \ hoping to see? Are you going to run <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, or try some of your\
  \ own adventures too? Sound off in the comments!</p> \n    <p>Logan Bonner<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
