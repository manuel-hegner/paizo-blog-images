  >I have the distinct pleasure to be part of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game digital\
  \ team at <a href=\"https://www.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\">Obsidian Entertainment</a>!\
  \ We are progressing towards an initial release this year starting with the <em>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Base Set</em>.</p> \n    <p>As fans of the physical version of\
  \ the game, we are having a lot of fun bringing it to life on iPads and Android\
  \ tablets. In some cases, we highlight the game's hardcore RPG roots. I think character\
  \ selection brings this to life.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20150416-Kyra.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20150416-Kyra_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>When we played the card game, it was clear that most\
  \ of the character powers were in some way analogous to class powers, feats and\
  \ skills you'd find in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. And in Kyra's case, her powers\
  \ matched the domain powers Sarenrae gave her (Rebuke Death and Sun's Blessing).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For those of you studying this screenshot, the page also has toggles\
  \ for pass-and-play and permanent death. Though I am sure that all of you play by\
  \ the book and destroy characters when they die in the physical game and will continue\
  \ that time honored tradition on the tablet, we are giving new players the option\
  \ to play a more forgiving version of the game. That being said, there will likely\
  \ be specific rewards or achievements for playing through the game as Selinker intended,\
  \ but that's a topic for another day.</p> \n    <p>When we started working on the\
  \ concept for this game, we knew that we had a lot of tools at our disposal to amplify\
  \ the \"adventure\" part of the card game. To that end, we are including things\
  \ like MAPS! I've always loved Pathfinder's beautifully rendered maps and we have\
  \ a perfect opportunity to use them to help tell the story.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150416-Waterfront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150416-Waterfront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Most of the time, Location Cards are analogous to specific\
  \ spots on a map, and we are trying to match the lore as closely as possible (the\
  \ farmhouse pictured has since moved to the outskirts of town). When you go to Magnimar\
  \ or Thistletop, you'll encounter new maps.</p> \n    <p>When you visit and explore\
  \ one of these locations, enhanced versions of the location card art become the\
  \ backdrop for your looting and fighting.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ \n    <p>One handy technical flourishes can be seen at the top left corner. As\
  \ you encounter cards, the numbers underneath the Card Types tick down.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Before, I sign out, I want to give big ups to the team members bringing this\
  \ bad boy to life! Kevin, Andre, Lindsey, Stephanie and Kristian, y'all are making\
  \ a great game!</p> \n    <p>Nathan Davis<br> <i>Producer<br> Obsidian Entertainment</i></p>\
