  \   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <h1>Pathfinder Society Open Call Submissions</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October 30, 2008</p> \n    <p>After reviewing\
  \ nearly half of the submissions for the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/submissions\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Open Call</a>, I want to address a few recurring issues and\
  \ errors. Please note that not all of these issues and errors result in automatic\
  \ rejection and don't assume your submission was rejected if you feel any of the\
  \ items below apply to it. I have not yet selected the finalists.</p> \n    <p><b>Understanding\
  \ the Pathfinder Society</b></p> \n    <p>This is the most important gaff I've seen—\
  authors who don't really understand Golarion's Pathfinder Society. Either the submitter\
  \ hasn't read the entry in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zkr\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #1</a>\
  \ and the entry in the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84eo\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ Campaign Setting</i></a> or he or she is choosing to ignore it. Submitting a proposal\
  \ for Pathfinder Society Scenario #17—Perils of the Pirate Pact and completely ignoring\
  \ the motivations of the Pathfinder Society in your submission makes it feel more\
  \ like a generic adventure and less like a scenario that should necessarily focus\
  \ on Golarion's famed organization of vagabond explorers and thrill-seeking treasure\
  \ hunters.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Avoid Passive Voice</b></p> \n    <p>Don't\
  \ do it. Don't use it. Remove it from your writing style altogether. Passive voice\
  \ is boring, distracting, and authors who use it often miss opportunities to approach\
  \ a description from an evocative direction. For an excellent guide to passive voice,\
  \ read <a href=\"http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/grammar/g_actpass.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this webpage</a> from Purdue's English Department. Removing\
  \ passive voice will strengthen your submissions and strengthen your final turnover.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Spelling Errors and Grammatical Errors</b></p> \n    <p>Use your spell\
  \ check, have a friend read your submission, read your submission out loud—each\
  \ of these is a great way to find errors. While one or two errors won't necessarily\
  \ eliminate your submission, repeated errors will as they show a lack of attention\
  \ to detail.</p> \n    <p><b>Use the Clues</b></p> \n    <p>In the summary for #17,\
  \ for example, there were three clues: ettercaps, a book stolen from a Pathfinder\
  \ Society venture-captain, and dead pirates dangling in spiderwebs over the River\
  \ Sellen. Not using the clues from the summary in your submission makes your submission\
  \ much less likely to be accepted.</p> \n    <p><b>Elaborate X</b></p> \n    <p>Many\
  \ submissions spend more time on elaborate names, elaborate concepts, or elaborate\
  \ scenes than on a good solid plot. While cool names, concepts, or scenes are <i>cool</i>,\
  \ I'd rather see much more time spent making the plot flow well and making it make\
  \ sense than submitters throwing spider pirates and complicated NPC names at me.\
  \ You have one page to wow me—wow me with a good plot. </p>\n    <p>All in all,\
  \ this has been a positive experience and I feel confident that I'll be able to\
  \ reply with feedback to each submission. Check back on the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society messageboards</a> and the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society website</a> on Monday for the names of those selected for the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety/submissions\">Pathfinder Society open call</a>. And importantly,\
  \ don't let a rejection keep you from submitting for the next round!</p> \n    <p>\
