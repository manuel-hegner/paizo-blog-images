  description\">Earlier in the year, I posted <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgyc\"\
  >a lengthy update</a> regarding the Faction Journal Cards we announced at the end\
  \ of 2014. I encourage you to check out that blog if you didn't have a chance to\
  \ read it before. As many of you likely recall, these cards are a new way for the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> campaign\
  \ to address factions, including faction goals that can apply to a wide range of\
  \ adventures and allow the PC to earn up to three faction-specific rewards over\
  \ the course of a season. Over the past week, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lh8l\"\
  >Linda Zayas-Palmer</a> and I have put in a lot of work on these cards.</p> \n \
  \    <p>With that to look forward to, let's also take a look at the upcoming scenarios—\
  as well as two of the talkative personalities that appear this month. The first\
  \ scenario, <a href=\"/products/btpy9am7\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–16:\
  \ Scions of the Sky Key, Part 3: The Golden Guardian</em></a>, is the last installment\
  \ of this Tier 1–5 series that has sent the PCs to Sargava's Bandu Hills and later\
  \ to the Kaava Lands. Having acquired a powerful weapon, the PCs hope to incapacitate\
  \ the legendary warden that watches over the dwarven ruins of Ashkurhall. Those\
  \ who have played through <a href=\"/products/btpy9am4\">the first part of the series</a>\
  \ will no doubt encounter some familiar foes, and the author Mikko Kallio has done\
  \ an excellent job of presenting these creatures by combining a few classic features\
  \ with just as many very clever twists. All told, it's a thrilling conclusion to\
  \ a very fun three-part series.</p> \n     <p>On a related note, Mikko is one of\
  \ the three <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> 2014 finalists as well as\
  \ a judge for this year's contest. By the time this blog goes live, there's probably\
  \ only a narrow window left to vote, but I strongly encourage you to at least check\
  \ out the submissions from the various rounds—especially if you're interested in\
  \ participating in the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/getInvolved\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Open Call</a>.</p> \n     <p>The second scenario this month is <a href=\"/products/btpy9ch1\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–17: Fires of Karamoss</em></a>, which in a way\
  \ is also part of a series. Really it's the spiritual successor of <a href=\"/products/btpy97n5\"\
  >one of the season's first adventures</a>, in which the PCs explored part of the\
  \ Red Redoubt of Karamoss, a siege fortress rife with advanced technology. It seems\
  \ the earlier discoveries have uncovered a more sinister plot, and it's up to the\
  \ PCs to delve deep into the tower's foundation to save a major find—if not Absalom\
  \ itself! The author is one of Paizo's own: the talented <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgqu\"\
  >Joe Homes</a>. Working only a few dozen feet away from an author makes it really\
  \ easy to bounce ideas back and forth, and Joe really impressed me with his ability\
  \ to introduce charming NPCs into what could have easily remained a straightforward\
  \ dungeon crawl. The result is an exciting adventure with a healthy helping of both\
  \ memorable roleplaying and engaging battles.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
