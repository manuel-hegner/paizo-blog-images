  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Who says only monsters get to be haunted? Where's\
  \ the fun in that?</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">With <a href=\"/products/btpy9nft\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Haunted Heroes</em></a>, we wanted to explore\
  \ exactly that—what happens when a PC gets haunted? But that wasn't the ORIGINAL\
  \ incarnation of this book. Once upon a time, back when several of us were shut\
  \ away in one of Paizo's enormous Think Tanks and tasked with coming up with ideas\
  \ for the Player Companion line, many suggestions got bandied about—one of which\
  \ was something called an \"Exorcist's Handbook.\" One of the things that really\
  \ appealed to me about that, of course, is the fact that exorcism movies are one\
  \ of the most enduring and popular sub-genres of horror, and I loved the idea of\
  \ exploring the concept of how you would make an exorcist in Pathfinder. But the\
  \ more we thought about it, the more we realized that there was more to the idea\
  \ than just rules for building exorcists—and so the book expanded into new haunting\
  \ territories.</p> \n    <p>So now, you not only get rules for dealing with what\
  \ happens when your allies get possessed by evil spirits... but you get rules for\
  \ what happens to YOU when you get possessed... and not necessarily by unwelcome\
  \ and/or evil entities.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9471-Retraining.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p>But don't take my word for it. Check out some of the illustrations of\
  \ haunted heroes from the book below. Don't they look like they're having the time\
  \ of their lives? Wouldn't you want your character to have as much fun as them?\
  \ Well, now you can!</p> \n    <p>All you have to do is to tell your GM, the next\
  \ time she or he asks you to roll a Will saving throw for your character... \"Oh,\
  \ no thanks. I'll voluntarily fail that save.\" PRESTO! Instant character upgrade!</p>\
