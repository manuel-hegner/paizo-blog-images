  >Starfinder Near Space</a></em> released last month, and to show off some of the\
  \ new character options available in the book, we present Daytenna Flass, an NPC\
  \ witchwarper that you can use in your Starfinder campaigns. Among her many abilities,\
  \ Daytenna utilizes an alternate damai racial trait, the mediator archetype, a new\
  \ damai-themed witchwarper paradigm shift, and some new witchwarper spells, all\
  \ from <em>Near Space</em>. While NPCs don’t normally use themes, we’ve given Daytenna\
  \ the bureaucrat theme to give you a sneak peek at one of the new themes from the\
  \ book as well. In addition, we offer a brief look at Daytenna’s home world, the\
  \ colossi-infested Daimalko, which is fully detailed in <em>Near Space</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Content from other Starfinder products is marked with the following\
  \ abbreviations: AA2 (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive 2</em>), COM (<em>Starfinder\
  \ Character Operations Manual</em>), and NS (<em>Starfinder Near Space</em>). These\

  \ Daytenna relies on her incredible force of personality and in-the-moment ingenuity\
  \ to get herself out of scrapes, rather than on the survival skills common among\
  \ her fellows. She gains a +2 racial bonus to Bluff and Sense Motive checks. When\
  \ she aids another creature using either of these skills, the aid another bonus\
  \ she provides increases to +3. This alternate racial trait replaces survivor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Bureaucrat Theme</b> Daytenna is a civil servant, operating within\
  \ institutional boundaries to effect change and navigating the proper channels to\
  \ find solutions, skills which serve her well in encounters with organizations across\
  \ the galaxy. Bureaucrats gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Intelligence, Wisdom,\
  \ or Charisma at character creation.</p> \n     <p><b>Empathic Link</b> (Su) Mediators\
  \ tap into an innate emotional and psychological understanding of others to act\
  \ as efficient arbitrators between the innumerable species and civilizations of\
  \ the galaxy. As a full action, Daytenna can touch up to two willing or unconscious\
  \ creatures to create an empathic link between herself and the creatures touched.\
  \ This link lasts for 1 hour or until she ends it for all creatures with a swift\
  \ action. While linked, she and the linked creatures gain the effects of status\
  \ in relation to one another. Whenever a linked creature fails a Will saving throw,\
  \ a different linked creature can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to allow the\
  \ affected creature to reroll the save; if the effect is an emotion or fear effect,\
  \ they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this reroll. An affected creature can reroll\
  \ a given saving throw only once in this manner. Finally, once per day at the beginning\
  \ of combat, each linked creature can swap their initiative result with that of\
  \ any other linked creature within 60 feet.</p> \n     <p><b>Expert in the Field</b>\
  \ When Daytenna spends 10 minutes with a creature that knows about Daimalko’s war\
  \ against the colossi that walk its surface, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus to\
  \ her next attempted Diplomacy check to change that creature’s attitude or Intimidate\
  \ check to bully that creature.</p> \n     <p><b>Phantom Colossus (Su)</b> As a\
  \ reaction, when a hostile creature within 100 feet would take any action to move\
  \ 10 or more feet toward Daytenna or an ally, she can force it to witness an alternate\
  \ reality in which a massive horror covered in tongues, teeth, and armored plates\
  \ is bearing down toward it. The target creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will saving\
  \ throw or it instead loses its action immediately as it is shocked into stillness,\
  \ and it cannot voluntarily take any additional movement until the beginning of\
  \ its next turn. Once an attacker has been affected by this paradigm shift, it can’\
  t be targeted by it again for 24 hours. This is a fear effect.</p> \n     <p>Daytenna\
  \ Flass is a talent scout for the Guardians of Daimalko, who defend the planet’\
  s inhabitants from the roving colossi that rampage across the planet’s surface with\
  \ mystical orbs that allow them to psychically sense and subtly influence the monsters’\
  \ behavior. Now the hunt is on for brave warriors beyond Daimalko who might be willing\
  \ to step into battle against these destructive giants by other, more traditional,\
  \ methods. Daytenna travels Near Space and the Pact Worlds seeking soldiers, saboteurs,\
  \ and assassins with the guts and experience necessary to face down terrifying horrors\
  \ from beyond space and time… and she’s very, very persuasive.</p> \n     <h3>DAIMALKO</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Daimalko is a dry, blasted world orbiting a tiny star in Near Space,\
  \ teeming with rampaging colossi and the struggling survivors of the damai species\
  \ (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em> 2 32). Two hundred years ago, the planet’s\
  \ oceans evaporated, its greenery withered, and earthquakes reverberated across\
  \ the planet as nightmarish colossi—kyokors (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em> 72),\
  \ tekenkis (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em> 3 108), and even stranger monstrosities—\
  rose from the rocky terrain of the empty seabeds. The colossi destroyed the planet’\
  s population centers, forcing the Daimalkans underground, but under the watchful\
  \ eyes of the Guardians, people have begun returning to the planet’s surface for\
  \ the first time in generations.</p> \n     <p>For more character options and more\
