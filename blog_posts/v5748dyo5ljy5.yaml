  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Gods are undeniable entities of immense power\
  \ and in Starfinder, religion provides a measure of assurance that one will be taken\
  \ care of in the afterlife. The people of the Pact Worlds venerate a multitude of\
  \ gods and goddesses, but there are 20 deities who are widely worshiped throughout\
  \ the system—the \"core deities\" of the Starfinder setting. We've revealed details\
  \ on 13 of Starfinder's \"core 20\" gods so far (check the links at the bottom of\
  \ this post if you missed one of the earlier previews)—now it's time to show off\
  \ the rest!</p> \n    <p>First, let's look at some more deities who were worshiped\
  \ on lost Golarion, and who remain popular in the Pact Worlds millennia later.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Desna.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Desna_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <h3>Abadar</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><i>LN god of civilization,\
  \ commerce, law, and wealth</i></p> \n     <p>The Master of the First Vault is dedicated\
  \ to spreading civilization, free trade, and the rule of law across the Material\
  \ Plane, and his church, AbadarCorp, is one of the most powerful corporations in\
  \ the Pact Worlds.</p> \n     <h3>Besmara</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><i>CN\
  \ goddess of piracy, space monsters, and strife</i></p> \n     <p>Once a minor nautical\
  \ deity, Besmara seized her current power and position as her prize when she deposed\
  \ another deity in a daring raid during the Gap.</p> \n     <h3>Desna</h3> \n  \
  \   <p class=\"collapse\"><i>CG goddess of dreams, luck, stars, and travelers</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Desna and her faith have changed little since the pre-Gap era. The Song\
  \ of the Spheres encourages her followers to believe in themselves, indulge their\
  \ desires, experience all they can, express their inner strengths, and trust their\
  \ instincts.</p> \n     <h3>Urgathoa</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><i>NE goddess\
  \ of disease, gluttony, and undeath</i></p> \n     <p>Urgathoa's faith is shunned,\
  \ if not outright banned, on most civilized worlds, but the undead inhabitants of\
  \ Eox openly worship the Pallid Princess, who is said to be the universe's first\
  \ undead creature.</p> \n     <h3>Nyarlathotep</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"\
  ><i>CE Outer God of conspiracies, dangerous secrets, and forbidden magic</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Said to possess a thousand different forms, the Crawling Chaos is an\
  \ Outer God and the prime mover in preparing countless worlds for the devastating\
  \ return of the Great Old Ones.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Finally, let's\
  \ look at two more of Starfinder's new gods, also widely worshiped throughout the\
  \ Pact Worlds: Damoritosh the Conqueror and Ibra the Inscrutable.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb360\" style=\"width: 220px;\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Damoritosh.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Damoritosh_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Ibra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Ibra_360.jpeg\"\
  \ style=\"width: 220px; height: 177px;\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <h3>Damoritosh,\
  \ The Conqueror</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><i>LE god of conquest, duty, and\
  \ war</i></p> \n     <p>Damoritosh is the primary patron god of the vesk, but the\
  \ Conqueror's faith has spread throughout the Pact Worlds to mercenaries, soldiers,\
  \ and warriors of all species. The vesk have always been a race of warriors and\
  \ conquerors, and Damoritosh remains a pillar of vesk society. To them, war and\
  \ conquest are woven into the fabric of the universe. One can choose to embrace\
  \ this truth and secure a place in history with one's triumphs, or one can deny\
  \ it and die a coward's death, scorned and forgotten. War requires sacrifice, however,\
  \ and it is the duty of everyone in society to make whatever sacrifices are necessary\
  \ to propel one's species—or culture, empire, kingdom, or world—to victory.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Damoritosh is a harsh deity, with no concern for freedom or comfort.\
  \ The Conqueror demands soldier-like obedience from all who seek his blessing and\
  \ pushes his followers to strive for victory at all costs. Courage is an admirable\
  \ trait, as is a militaristic sense of honor and oath keeping, but the will to fight\
  \ and the drive to win are far more important than such noble ideals as bravery\
  \ or heroism. Damoritosh is uninterested in diplomacy, as force and military prowess\
  \ can win far greater rewards in a shorter amount of time, but he also encourages\
  \ the acceptance of a foe's honorable surrender to avoid wasting lives for no additional\
  \ gain.</p> \n     <h3>Ibra, The Inscrutable</h3> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><i>N\
  \ god of celestial bodies, the cosmos, and mysteries of the universe</i></p> \n\
  \     <p>The universe is a vast expanse of wonders. Ibra is a god of these marvels—\
  distant galaxies, misty nebulae, all the spinning worlds that orbit countless suns,\
  \ and the empty void that stretches between them. Science can explain all of these\
  \ and more, but the magnificence of the cosmos knows no bounds, and there are always\
  \ new miracles and mysteries waiting to be discovered, explored, and explained.\
  \ Ibra itself is one of these cosmic enigmas. No one in the Pact Worlds knows what\
  \ species first venerated Ibra as a god. It has no gender or defined physical form,\
  \ and it's unclear whether Ibra is a deity who sprang into being when the universe\
  \ as born, some alien paragon who ascended to godhood, or a personification of the\
  \ cosmos itself.</p> \n     <p>Ibra's followers believe that one can find truth,\
  \ serenity, and meaning in the beauty of the cosmos, but it is up to the individual\
  \ to decipher the universe's secrets to discover these rewards. It is not Ibra's\
  \ place to reveal the answers to creation's great questions, and the Inscrutable\
  \ rewards those who push the boundaries of knowledge and science to explore the\
  \ universe and bring its wonders to light. To Ibra, there is no law or chaos, no\
  \ good or evil: only the questions raised by the shining light of a newborn star,\
  \ the beautiful dance of heavenly bodies, and the perfect solitude of the comet\
  \ as it hurtles through the dark, regardless of whether the answers to those questions\
  \ are ever found.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>And that wraps up the 20 core\
  \ gods of Starfinder. But while these deities may be the most ubiquitous in the\
  \ Pact Worlds, every culture has its own gods, traditions, and philosophies, each\
  \ with their own widespread followings. All of these are fully detailed in the upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, but you\
