  \ &amp; 24</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 15, 2009</p> \n   <p>Hello\
  \ and welcome to another installment of the Pathfinder Society Scenario Open Call.\
  \ Last week I selected the authors for scenarios #21 and #22 and they are, respectively:\
  \ C. Robert Brown (<i>The Eternal Obelisk</i>) and Larry Wilhelm (<i>Fingerprints\
  \ of the Fiend</i>). Congratulations, guys!</p> \n   <p>That brings us to the open\
  \ call round for 23 and 24. I'm going to continue with the looser, open format style\
  \ with some general guidelines. We received far fewer submissions last round than\
  \ before and I'm hoping that had more to do with RPG Superstar and the holidays\
  \ than it did with the open format chasing submitters away. Prove me right! As always,\
  \ keep the following guidelines in mind when submitting:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>1. Don't break our world. If you submit something that breaks part of our\
  \ world, it'll be auto-rejected. The scenarios are one-shot, 4-hour adventures—\
  epic story arcs, world-shattering events, wars, mass famine, etc. don't have a place\
  \ in them.</p> \n    <p>2. Understand Pathfinder Society Organized Play before you\
  \ submit. Specifically, understand that the Pathfinder Society is an organization\
  \ of vagabond scholars, thrill-seeking treasure hunters, and extreme explorers.\
  \ They are not necessarily the \"good guys,\" they don't get \"hired\" for their\
  \ adventures, and they're not generally looking to make the world a better place.\
  \ Submitting generic 3.5 \"save the day\" adventure ideas will decrease your chances\
  \ of getting to write one. There are plenty of resources out there to give you a\
  \ feel for the Society: the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84k4\">Guide to Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play</a>, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zkr\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #1</a>, and the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84eo\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign\
  \ Setting</i></a> all have information on the Pathfinder Society. </p> \n    <p>3.\
  \ I need to feel that you've read or played a few scenarios before submitting. I'll\
  \ get this sense through your proposal—our scenarios have a very specific flow to\
  \ them and your outline should follow this flow. Read one or two before submitting.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>4. Pathfinder Society Scenarios must be no more offensive than PG-13.\
  \ Scenarios are played in public at public settings and children will be playing\
  \ them. No more submissions that include violence toward children, please.</p> \n\
  \    <p>5. This is not a contest. This is more like an interview for a job—you're\
  \ showing me your best idea and I'm deciding if the combination of idea and writing\
  \ skill equals you being selected as our next scenario author. I need authors—not\
  \ winners. And I really want to stress the <i>author</i> part of that. Only send\
  \ me your best work that is reflective of your writing style. I can teach someone\
  \ the rules system—I can't teach someone to write.</p> \n    <p>6. Finally, I just\
  \ don't have time to return every submission with feedback. Feel free to post your\
  \ rejected proposals to the Pathfinder Society messageboards for peer review. For\
  \ those of you not submitting, please give feedback to those who do and are rejected.\
  \ </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Rules for submitting Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ outlines are as follows:</p> \n   <blockquote>\n     1. Based on the guidelines\
  \ for the current round, write a 750-word outline that includes the following: \n\
  \    <blockquote>\n      a. A title\n     <br> b. A brief introduction that acts\
  \ as a prologue for the scenario\n     <br> c. A brief summary of how the PCs proceed\
  \ through each encounter\n     <br> d. A brief summary of each encounter—minimum\
  \ five encounters\n     <br> e. A brief conclusion—what happens if the PCs fail\
  \ or succeed\n     <br> f. You <b>no longer</b> need to submit mission ideas with\
  \ your outline \n    </blockquote> 2. By the due date, email your outline to <a\
  \ href=\"mailto:josh@paizo.com?subject=SCENARIO%20NAME_##_YOURLASTNAME\">josh@paizo.com</a>\
  \ with the subject line <b>SCENARIO NAME_##_YOURLASTNAME</b>. Your summary must\
  \ be in a MS Word document, Notepad, or Real Text format—these are files ending\
  \ in <b>.doc</b>, <b>.txt</b>, or <b>.rtf</b>. Your file must be titled SCENARIO\
  \ NAME_##_LAST NAME, i.e., PerilsofthePiratePact_17_Dayon. 3. Include your full\
  \ legal name, email address, physical mailing address, and a contact phone number\
  \ at the top of your submission—this text does <i>not</i> count toward your word\
  \ count. 4. Please allow 72 hours for a response before resending your submission.\
  \ \n    <p>The current open call is for Pathfinder Society scenarios #23 &amp; 24—\
  two of the four June releases. The full schedule for this submission period is as\
  \ follows:</p> \n    <blockquote>\n      • 1/15/09—Open call begins\n     <br> •\
  \ 1/30/09—Submissions due by 11:59 P.M. Pacific Time\n     <br> • 2/6/09—Submissions\
  \ review completed—selections and rejections notified \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p><b>Guidelines</b></p> \n    <p>**<b>SPOILER ALERT: Do not read the guidelines\
  \ below if you wish to avoid spoilers for upcoming scenarios.</b>**</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #23</b><br> Suggested Title: <i>Tide of Morning</i><br> Setting:\
  \ Andoran wilderness (classic forest adventure archetype suggested)<br> Monster:\

  \ Pathfinder Society Scenarios are written with a 4-hour time limit in mind. Your\
  \ outline should reflect 4 hours of solid game play.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n \
