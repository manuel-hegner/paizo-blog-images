  \ Delhi-style</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 2, 2008</p> \n    <p>Even\
  \ more than his writing or game design, Gary Gygax is known for his imagination.\
  \ The number of his unique creations—monsters and gods, spells and artifacts—that\
  \ have entered the collective consciousness is truly mind-boggling. Yet like all\
  \ great artists, Gary's inventions didn't spring full-formed from nothing, but rather\
  \ were rooted in part in his deep love of history. For in order to create new mythology,\
  \ you have to understand the existing ones.</p> \n    <p>This desire to explore\
  \ and create variations of differing real-world belief systems is undoubtedly part\
  \ of what led him to write <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\"><i>Death in\
  \ Delhi</i></a>. While the previous Setne Inhetep books—<a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8a\"\
  ><i>The Anubis Murders</i></a> and <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdq\"><i>The\
  \ Samarkand Solution</i></a>—had allowed him to do great work imagining alternate\
  \ versions of the ancient Egyptian pantheon, Gygax was always looking for new ground.\
  \ And he found it—a whole subcontinent of it, in fact—with <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\"\
  ><i>Death in Delhi</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>One of the more interesting points of Indian\
  \ history, and which plays an important role in the novel, is the concept of Thugee.\
  \ While historians continue to clash on the extent of the practice, and what role\
  \ the British played in expanding and disseminating the stories, the Thugs of India\
  \ were part of a tribal system of organized crime centered around the worship of\
  \ Kali, Goddess of Destruction. Descending in wild charges or carefully infiltrating\
  \ parties over a period of weeks, gangs of Thugs would attack caravans traveling\
  \ long distances and slaughter every man, woman, and child, strangling them with\
  \ yellow handkerchiefs. The spoils would then go to the Thugs, who would carefully\
  \ bury the bodies and remove any trace of evidence, making it seem that the caravan\
  \ simply disappeared. It's from this tradition of mass slaughter and robbery, which\
  \ some have estimated cost millions of lives over a period of centuries, that we\
  \ get the modern English term \"thug.\" </p> \n    <p>Of course, if there's something\
  \ that sinister in our India's past, then you know Magister Setne Inhetep and his\
  \ bodyguard Rachelle are bound to encounter it in Gygax's own Lands of the Peacock\
  \ Throne. </p> \n    <p>For more information on Thugee, check out what <a href=\"\
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a> has to say,\
  \ or pick up a copy of <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\"><i>Death in Delhi</i></a>\
  \ and go straight for Gary's own take on it. </p> \n    <p>Because the only thing\
  \ stranger than fantasy is history.</p> \n    <p>James Sutter<br> <i>Planet Stories</i>\
