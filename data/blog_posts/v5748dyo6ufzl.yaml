  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy Pride! The Starfinder\
  \ team would like to introduce you to our newest iconic character, Dae!</p>\n  \
  \    <blockquote>\n       <p>Dae (they/them)* is a sparkly celebrity from a free\
  \ planet in the Veskarium, a nearby star system ruled by a warlike empire. Dae was\
  \ born on Pulonis, the pahtra** homeworld—a magical jungle world wracked by intense\
  \ magnetic storms that degrade technology and bless the planet with spectacular\
  \ aurora displays. Born last in a large litter from a remote agrarian village, Dae\
  \ has always loved to make a dramatic entrance, and their birth was no exception.</p>\n\
  \       <p>A magnetic storm raged over Pulonis during Dae’s birth, and coils of\
  \ lavender, rose, and golden light fractured the sky over their village in slow,\
  \ chaotic waves, shutting down power in every household and scrambling comms as\
  \ tech infrastructure suddenly failed—a disaster for a pahtra ending a long labor\
  \ by delivering a runt the midwife thought might be stillborn.</p>\n       <p>Dae\
  \ asked the old folks about it later, and they said the storm was Meyel tearing\
  \ the sky apart as she danced for joy.Dae fought through the storm of the century\
  \ alive, dragging a souvenir of the event with them: a tiny orb of starfire that\
  \ blazed like a miniature sun.</p>\n       <br>\n       <br clear=\"all\">\n   \

  \ </table>\n       <br>\n       <p><strong>Dae is a solarian.</strong> At the time\
  \ of their birth, they miraculously manifested a stellar mote. At first, Dae’s family\
  \ believed they’d imagined seeing it, as the mote was a speck and appeared for only\
  \ a second; it was surely a trick of the light. Then the spark emerged when Dae\
  \ cried out in hunger, or flared into being when the baby woke up alone in their\
  \ cradle. Somehow, it could never be captured on video, even when everybody thought\
  \ they had seen it.</p>\n       <p>Dae’s mote became more stable as they grew. Soon\
  \ they learned how to command it, shaping it into armaments: a dazzling sword of\
  \ starlight, a flaming ribbon, a shield made from the aurora they were born under.\
  \ As Dae practiced forging their mote into new shapes, they discovered its attunement\
  \ with gravitic energies. Cycling between these extremes helped them keep control\
  \ of the reckless stunts they performed, using their mote as an anchor to keep balance\
  \ or as a flashlight to see down dark tunnels.</p>\n       <p><strong>Dae is a famous\
  \ performer</strong>, and they have wanted to be seen from the moment they scrambled\
  \ out into the world. From dancing to executing dangerous stunts and elaborate dramatic\
  \ scenes, Dae has always been down for whatever it takes to draw a crowd. Showing\
  \ off was always the norm for them (their aunties and littermates could tell you\
  \ some wild stories), and they grew up performing at local cultural festivals and\
  \ winning awards at regional talent shows.</p>\n       <p>For a long time, Dae uploaded\
  \ their vids for a small but loyal following on local infospheres. Then serendipity—\
  or Meyel herself—struck again: they met Miiyu, a pahtra celebrity pop star. Scrambling\
  \ to dodge the paparazzi, Miiyu ducked into a local café, ran for the back door,\
  \ and nearly smacked right into Dae, who was performing a stunt in the café’s back\
  \ alley in view of their live-recording camera drone. After recovering, clocking\
  \ the live feed, and seeing Dae’s dance moves, Miiyu invited them to costar in a\
  \ music video. The video was a hit, and Dae later joined Miiyu as a backup dancer\
  \ for her sold-out world tour.</p>\n       <p>Miiyu’s no-strings-attached endorsement\
  \ boosted Dae’s career. But that was months ago, and Dae’s only just begun to shine.\
  \ Next up, they want to see the galaxy outside the Veskarium. They’ve used their\
  \ pay from Miiyu’s tour to book their own personal “tour” to the Pact Worlds system,\
  \ starting with the space station at the center of the galaxy.</p>\n       <p>Now,\
  \ Dae’s a rising star hoping to do fame their way. They’re not looking to line the\
  \ pockets of some greedy exec or get tied down with fine print; they care about\
  \ putting on a show and exploring the galaxy, which is why they vibe so well with\
  \ Chk Chk. After meeting as interns working for the Starfinder Society, the pair\
  \ became the best of friends. They’ve even traded friendship bracelets (Dae wears\
  \ theirs every day) and have shared a mystical bond that lets them speak straight\
  \ into each other’s minds (with permission).</p>\n       <p>Where will Dae go next?\
  \ That’s up to you! Stay proud and playtest. &lt;3<br><br></p>\n       <p>*Dae,\
  \ like many pahtras*, is agender, a nonbinary gender identity that isn’t male or\
  \ female. Dae uses they/them pronouns. So, when you see “they” and “them” used in\
  \ place of gendered pronouns like “she” or “him” referring to Dae, that’s why.</p>\n\
  \       <p>Dae is an alien stellar knight and space pop star who doesn’t care what\
  \ you think of their gender, but real people with agender and/or nonbinary identities\
  \ <em>do</em> care if you maliciously misuse their pronouns or make fun of their\
  \ gender expression, so please act in the spirit of fun and kindness when gaming\
  \ with people in your community.</p>\n       <p><strong>**Pahtras</strong> are bipedal\
  \ felinoid aliens (they’re alien cat-people who walk on two legs) from Pulonis,\
  \ a planet in the Veskarium whose people have been fighting a brutal war for independence\
  \ from the vesk-run empire. Pulonis recently achieved freedom and joined the Pact\
  \ Worlds, a federation of independent planets dedicated to maintaining peace and\
  \ prosperity in the galaxy. The Veskarium is currently at war with the Azlanti Star\
  \ Empire and has yet to retaliate against the former colony.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n\
