  artist: "the mysterious Council of Truth allowed me ample opportunity to blend fantasy\
    \ and science to my own peculiar tastes. The generator room (magic-powered and\
    \ water-cooled!), the recycling unit (where corpses turn into valuable potions!),\
    \ the incinerator (get rid of those undesirables!), and the turbines that supply\
    \ the dungeon with air all scratched an itch that rarely gets addressed in a lot\
    \ of fantasy settings. By far the most sci-fi element, however, was one of the\
    \ new monsters: nanites (which were promptly renamed the construct swarm by the\
    \ Powers That Be). Few current trends in science capture my imagination more than\
    \ nanotechnology. Just reading about all the advances in medicine and manufacturing\
    \ that are coming about as we speak due to tiny, autonomous robots makes me giggle\
    \ and start expounding loudly on how We Live In The Future (which, as Jacobs will\
    \ tell you, happens on a regular basis). And while writing D2 I got to thinking:\
    \ most of the reason we've taken so long to get where we are with nanotech is\
    \ due to manufacturing limitations. But with magic, construct technology is already\
    \ in place, and size is changeable at a whim. It seemed to me like a natural choice.\
    \ And if it allowed me to put in a hermetically sealed \"clean room\" and a man\
    \ transformed by a horrible, intelligent swarm that prefers to fight its battles\
    \ in your bloodstream... well, more's the better. So, fully prepared to have to\
    \ rewrite that room, I threw it in. And, to my great surprise, it stayed. For\
    \ that, I give many thanks to the GameMastery team. May they not regret their\
    \ decision. Now just wait until we start talking about Golarion's moon.... James\
    \ Sutter Assistant Editor, Pathfinder"
