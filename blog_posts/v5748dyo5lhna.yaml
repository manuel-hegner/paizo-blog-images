  \  <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Estra never\
  \ wanted to commune with spirits: she only wished for others to believe she did,\
  \ and profit from that belief.</p> \n     <p>Born the daughter of a poor miner in\
  \ the nation of Isger, Estra dreamed of the theaters of far-off cities, and more\
  \ than once nearly ran away with a traveling acting troupe that stopped in her small\
  \ town. Fortunately, her family moved to the capital city of Isger, Elidir, during\
  \ her teenage years, and she swiftly became enthralled with her new, cosmopolitan\
  \ home. Her dreams of joining the theater were even somewhat fulfilled when she\
  \ fell in with a small gang of faux-spiritualists who needed a convincing actress\
  \ to play the role of their spirit-channeling medium. The group engaged in fraudulent\
  \ séances targeting grieving mourners, who paid dearly for confirmation of the smooth\
  \ passing of their loved ones into the hereafter. </p> \n     <p>Within darkened\
  \ chambers and ramshackle theaters, Estra and her confederates spent nearly ten\
  \ years bilking grief-stricken with the promise of communion with their dead relatives.\
  \ Estra proved a talented actress, falling into convincing trances to channel the\
  \ dead and dispense the carefully gathered information her associates had gleaned\
  \ on their targets. Sessions typically culminated with the full-form “manifestation”\
  \ of a bereaved subject's lost relative: actually a confederate dressed in luminous\
  \ robes and clumsy disguises approximating the dead person's appearance.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The arrival of a handsome knight named Honaire changed all that. Stationed\
  \ in Elidir, Honaire had left behind an ailing mother, and in his absence she had\
  \ passed. Honaire sought some comfort in his loss, and turned toward the séances\
  \ of Estra's troupe for assurance that his mother rested in peace. Relieved of his\
  \ grief by the assurances of the spirit-seer, the young knight became smitten with\
  \ Estra's quick wit and streetwise charm. Estra, for her part, found the knight's\
  \ combination of physical strength and gentle courtesy enchanting, even as his strict\
  \ code of honor made her regret her own life of lies. When at last she confessed\
  \ the truth—that she'd never contacted Honaire's mother at all—she expected him\
  \ to fly into a rage. Instead, he thanked her for her courage, and promptly proposed\
  \ marriage. Accepting his proposal, Estra left behind the life of a charlatan, and\
  \ the two spent several happy decades together, with Estra enjoying the social status\
  \ that came from being the wife of an up-and-coming military commander.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Yet this life, too, came to an abrupt end when rumors of a rising alliance\
  \ of goblin tribes reached the capital. Seeing her husband's frustration at the\
  \ government's slow response, Estra urged him to volunteer to investigate, with\
  \ no way of knowing that the goblin assemblies were in fact the precursor to the\
  \ deadly Goblinblood Wars. There in the dark expanse of the Chitterwood, Honaire\
  \ and his unit were unexpectedly ambushed by a horde of maniacal goblins and their\
  \ green dragon ally. Though he fought bravely and saved the lives of many comrades\
  \ in their retreat, Honaire was bathed in the dragon's toxic breath, his armor and\
  \ body rent by the beast's deadly claws. </p> \n     <p>Wracked by guilt and loss,\
  \ set adrift in a devastated nation that suddenly had more to worry about than the\
  \ plight of military widows, Estra turned back to her old means of supporting herself,\
  \ training several new associates in the tricks of the faux-spiritualist trade.\
  \ Yet during the group's first performance, while her confederates secretly lifted\
  \ spirit trumpets with thin threads and caused tambourines to shake as if by unseen\
  \ forces, Estra's fake trance became something more. A wispy, greenish vapor coalesced\
  \ from her mouth, eyes, and nostrils. To the wonderment of those assembled, a spectral\
  \ figure emerged through the curtain of ectoplasmic mists. The ghostly apparition\
  \ was not the luminous confederate Estra expected to emerge from the spirit cabinet,\
  \ but rather the very real specter of her fallen husband. Both comforted and shamed,\
  \ the burgeoning spiritualist pledged once again to never allow deceit to rule her\
  \ life. </p> \n     <p>Though her body is increasingly stooped by age, Estra has\
  \ learned to strengthen her spiritual bond with Honaire so that his ectoplasmic\
  \ form might walk the world again. She tries to emulate her lost lover's selfless\
  \ drive to aid the helpless wherever they might be afflicted—though her impatience\
  \ and sharp tongue sometimes get the better of her. Wandering far from Isger, she\
  \ uses her strange powers to provide comfort and consolation—for real this time—\
  to those who've lost loved ones to the ceaseless violence of the world. Yet all\
  \ the while, she remains plagued by doubt, wondering if her phantom husband's presence\
  \ is the result of the depth of their love, some god's attempt to shepherd her toward\
  \ righteousness, or a manifestation of her own guilty conscience.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
