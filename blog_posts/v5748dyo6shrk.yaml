  \   </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“We can take it.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“But we don’t <em>have</em> to take it.”</p> \n     <p>Coiling an\
  \ arm around the vesk’s shoulder, Veerkea gently pulled her friend into a crouch\
  \ behind the fallen tree they used for cover, directing the vesk to look at her\
  \ lower eyes. “It’s not about ability, Obo. It’s about need. You,” she observed,\
  \ tapping Obozaya’s armor, “are a mighty vesk warrior. But that over there is a\
  \ living creature that’s done nothing to offend you.” All seven of Veerkea’s eyes\
  \ shimmered with empathy as the 5-foot-tall land squid pleaded with her scaly companion.\
  \ “Focus on the mission, Obo.”</p> \n     <p>“I am! Look…” Obozaya stood up and\
  \ glowered toward the clearing. “We came here looking for a crashed starship, right?”\
  \ Veerkea extended her legs, raising her upper eyes high enough to peer over the\
  \ fallen tree. The vesk gestured with her metallic staff as she kept talking, pointing\
  \ out features. “How many rocks—big rocks—have you seen out here? Not many, right?\
  \ But suddenly this clearing’s full of big slabs, and I’m figuring that’s no mistake.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Veerkea alternated between peeking over the massive trunk with her\
  \ upper eyes and squatting to peer under it with her lowers before glancing to Obozaya\
  \ with renewed respect. “Good eye! In fact, those might not be rocks at all, but\
  \ metal plates. And that might mean we’re standing atop the starship and the power\
  \ core we need.” Peering over the trunk again, she wondered, “But what might have\
  \ drawn this creature here?”</p> \n     <p>They both gazed at the beast perched\
  \ atop the clearing’s highest point. Easily 12 feet long from snout to tail, the\
  \ creature resembled a ponderous lizard with eight legs, a barrel-like body, a forest\
  \ of spikes running along its back, and throat scales that occasionally glowed faintly\
  \ as though the creature had swallowed a flashlight that was desperately signaling\
  \ for help. Throughout the ijtikri and vesk’s hushed discussion, the beast had lazily\
  \ watched them with a half-lidded eye, apparently unimpressed by its visitors and\
  \ more interested in dozing in the errant sunbeam that peeked through the forest\
  \ canopy here. As if to signal its nonchalant contentment, it issued a sloppy, snoring\
  \ sigh and shuffled its body slightly to scratch an itch.</p> \n     <p>With wide\
  \ eyes and her voice hushed with uncertainty and awe, Veerkea asked, “Maybe we—\"\
  </p> \n     <p>“—No.” The ijtikri flinched at Obozaya’s interjection. “No. You’\
  re going to say ‘maybe we can talk to it,’ and no. It’s a glowy lizard. You got\
  \ to sing happy songs with those peace-loving slugs earlier. But with big beasts,\
  \ we do things my way!” Veerkea raised her arms to protest, but Obozaya waved her\
  \ off. “No arguing with my scalesense, Vee. Let’s go!” Pushing off the ground with\
  \ her feet and staff, Obozaya vaulted the fallen tree in a single bound.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The flustered ijtikri called after her. “But I think that’s a plasmalisk,\
  \ so we need to—”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6ea0edf9-e52b-4a89-82d8-bfeae232b56a/080421_PLASMALISKBATTLE.jpg\"\

  >Starfinder Tech Revolution</a></em></p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>“—Fight\
  \ fire with fire, got it!” Obozaya barked confidently, as she landed in a controlled\
  \ somersault. Knocking the butt of her staff against the ground as she rolled to\
  \ her feet, she activated the weapon, causing a trio of plasma blades to flare to\
  \ life and transform the shaft into an axe-like doshko. <em>That</em> got the lizard’\
  s attention. Roaring with delight, Obozaya charged forward and drove the doshko’\
  s energy blades deep into the surprised plasmalisk’s flank. The beast staggered\
  \ under the impact, but it seemed unhurt. On the contrary, the creature’s flesh\
  \ seemed to drink in the energy, simultaneously shorting out the doshko and causing\
  \ its body to incandesce with power. The vesk barely voiced her shocked profanity\
  \ before the beast moved with impossible speed that belied its bulk, twisting and\
  \ slamming its tail into Obozaya’s chest and sending her flying back toward the\
  \ fallen tree.</p> \n     <p>Veerkea squeaked in alarm as the vesk hurled overhead.\
  \ Acting fast, she whipped her main arms upward, awakening a multitude of symbiotic\
  \ nanites that spilled from her body in a torrent. The living cloud wrapped around\
  \ Obozaya, cushioning her impact as she collided with a nearby tree. Yet the plasmalisk\
  \ had energy to spare. Before the vesk hit the ground, it spat a fist-sized fiery\
  \ globule toward the intruders. Predicting the blast, Veerkea folded her body against\
  \ the ground and propelled herself under the fallen tree, surfing atop the leaf\
  \ litter to the other side before the projectile shattered against a low-hanging\
  \ branch, enveloping the forest in flames. Even as fiery splinters rained around\
  \ her, her nanites snagged the debris, rapidly breaking it down and using it to\
  \ build more tiny machines to replace the ones she’d lost in the explosion. The\
  \ flames had devastated the nanites around Obozaya, but their improvised shield\
  \ was enough; though groaning in pain, her friend was clearly alive.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The plasmalisk’s roar drowned out Obozaya’s groans as the beast trampled toward\
  \ the ijtikri. Nanites whirled to life in a blinding fog, obscuring Veerkea’s form\
  \ as the beast bit at her in vain. With each attack, the ijtikri sidestepped, her\
  \ body partly discorporating into nanomachines with each defensive leap that carried\
  \ her several body lengths out of harm’s way. As she reformed each time, she made\
  \ a desperate attempt to defuse hostilities. “Excuse me! Please pardon my friend’\
  s aggression, she—! Perhaps we could—oh no!” At last, the plasmalisk cornered her,\
  \ cutting off her escape with its broad tail. But rather than bite her, it stared,\
  \ its eyes glowing with radioactive intensity.</p> \n     <p>Veerkea’s body exploded\
  \ in pain as she began blazing with the same heat raging in those eyes, her very\
  \ cells boiling from the gaze’s energy. As the plasmalisk watched the ijtikri hungrily,\
  \ the nanite cloud stirred. Millions of the airborne machines seeped back into their\
  \ host’s body, diagnosing the ijtikri’s distress and isolating the misbehaving tissues\
  \ to limit their damage. Aided by her myriad medics, Veerkea averted her eyes and\
  \ suppressed the inner flames before they consumed her. The plasmalisk seemed far\
  \ less impressed. Seeing that its prey hadn’t succumbed to its gaze, it closed in\
  \ to finish her off with fangs alone.</p> \n     <p>A projectile slammed into the\
  \ beast’s eye, deflecting its jaws as they narrowly missed the ijtikri. As Veerkea\
  \ scrambled to safety, she nearly tripped over the deactivated plasma doshko that\
  \ Obozaya had just thrown like a javelin. “Hey!” shouted the bristling vesk from\
  \ atop one of the rocky outcroppings. “No plasma? No problem!” As if to punctuate\
  \ her challenge, Obozaya splayed her claws threateningly and growled. Intrigued\
  \ by this new prey, the beast obliged, hissing angrily as it lumbered toward and\
  \ collided with the vesk. The two slashed and bit each other, but with twice the\
  \ size and twice the claws, the plasmalisk quickly gained the advantage. </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Something cold, please!” Veerkea called out to her nanites as she leapt\
  \ atop another outcropping. She tossed a battery into the air as she pivoted toward\
  \ the melee, and her myriad machines complied, neatly enveloping the battery and\
  \ assembling themselves into an energy rifle that landed in her hands. “Nicely done,\
  \ friends,” the ijtikri chimed as she felt the rifle chilling the air even before\
  \ it had been fired. She trained it on the plasmalisk, which had pinned Obozaya’\
  s head in place, forcing the vesk to stare into its burning eyes.</p> \n     <p>Even\
  \ as Obozaya roared in pain, Veerkea fired. Bolts of bright energy impacted the\
  \ giant lizard’s haunches, instantaneously draining the target’s body heat and riming\
  \ the targets with scale-shattering ice. A reflexive shiver forced the plasmalisk\
  \ to drop Obozaya, and another two shots from Veerkea dimmed the glowing heat deep\
  \ within the beast’s body. Panicked, the plasmalisk stumbled away, crashing through\
  \ the foliage to escape the painful onslaught.</p> \n     <p>But Obozaya’s wounded\
  \ roar drowned out the beast’s. Veerkea rushed over the where her friend knelt on\
  \ the ground, pink mist steaming from her body as Obozaya desperately tore off pieces\
  \ of armor to escape the heat building internally. The ijtikri tackled the vesk,\
  \ bracing her head and pinning her flailing claws against the moss while channeling\
  \ nanites into Obozaya’s body to arrest the ionizing affliction. For agonizing moments,\
  \ the vesk reflexively fought both the fires and the ijtikri, but gradually her\
  \ thrashing slowed as her natural fortitude prevailed. Obozaya coughed smoke as\
  \ she came to her senses, blinking in confusion at the ijtikri pinning her before\
  \ shrugging and drinking a healing serum. “So, ah… did we win?”</p> \n     <p>Flustered,\
  \ Veerkea clambered off the vesk and searched the area. “We did, yes, we won. Ah…\
  ” As the adrenaline subsided, she began piecing together the puzzle. “The plasmalisk\
  \ seemed to be basking, but it was clearly drinking in strong energy sources. If\
  \ this the starship and power core we’re looking for, maybe the creature was drawing\
  \ energy not from above, but from below?”</p> \n     <p>“Like a heated rock?” Obozaya\
  \ had regained her feet, picked up her dented doshko, and staggered over. </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Exactly,” confirmed Veerkea as she continued her examination. “To a plasmalisk,\
  \ this probably seemed like an oasis, perfect for warming up or… oh…” Confused by\
  \ the ijtikri’s sudden silence, Obozaya came over to investigate. The beast hadn’\
  t just been basking atop the buried starship’s hatch; it had been incubating. Several\
  \ shells littered the concave hatch, atop which hissed a foot-long plasmalisk, puffing\
  \ its body in a feeble threat display.</p> \n     <p>Spreading her arms to loom\
  \ over the infant, Obozaya silenced the creature through her presence alone. She\
  \ grunted dismissively. “Runt of the litter, last to hatch. Well, hope its instincts\
  \ are good. C’mon, run off to wherever your siblings scampered.” She nudged it with\
  \ the butt of her doshko to clear the way to the hatch.</p> \n     <p>Veerkea pulled\
  \ the doshko to one side. “That’s not how this works, Obo,” she chided. “You picked\
  \ this fight. Needlessly. If you’re so ready to take a life, you need to be ready\
  \ to save a life.” The vesk let her head loll to one side in exasperation, like\
  \ a toddler suffering a lecture. “And it’s not a runt. They were,” observed the\
  \ ijtikri, pointing to the other shells.</p> \n     <p>“Wait.” Obozaya’s attention\
  \ had snapped back to the nest. \"So the clutchmates hatch and fight, with the victor\
  \ eating its siblings?\"</p> \n     <p>Veerkea bobbed sadly. \"I know, nature can\
  \ be cruel.\"</p> \n     <p>But Obozaya shook her head with newfound respect. \"\
  No, I'm hearing that this is a born, blooded warrior.” She scooped up the eight-legged\
  \ lizard that wriggled in protest. “My scalesense doesn’t lie. This is a survivor!\
  \ A worthy companion! A—ow!\" Instinctively wary of large predators and displeased\
  \ with being handled, the baby plasmalisk latched onto Obozaya's finger with its\
  \ needle-like teeth.</p> \n     <p>\"Hylax rejoices, Obo,\" laughed Veerkea as she\
  \ helped disentangle the creature's teeth and eight legs. \"You just made first\
  \ contact.\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
