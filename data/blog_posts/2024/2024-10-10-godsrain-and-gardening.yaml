              <p>Urwal, the enigmatic leader of the Verdant Wheel faction of the Pathfinder Society, took stock of his garden. He decided Skyreach needed a rooftop garden all on his own when he’d chided Sorrina Westyr, the Master of Spells, that the building itself was lacking in nature’s presence. She’d replied that he should try growing a garden on the grounds. Thinking that an excellent solution, he’d secretly transported soil, bricks, and fish for fertilizer near to the top of Skyreach, the towering headquarters of the Pathfinders in Absalom. Urwal had found a location with just enough flat area to create the garden he felt the building needed.

It took years, but the project was finally bearing fruit—literally.</p>
              <p>He decided that its presence should be unknown to the rest of the organization, until the time was right. A garden atop the building should have been noteworthy of notice, but it surprised him just how rarely people looked up. Likely those who did just assumed it was supposed to be there. Though the garden was not a neat and tidy thing and instead resembled a sort of wild thicket in the sky, bordered by magically strengthened brickwork to keep the soil in. There was, of course, a reason for each plant and a purpose for their placement, but Urwal saw no need to share such things. He believed that anyone with the talent and patience to study the stars would understand why he does whatever he does. Though recent events had left even the pillar of self-assuredness that is Urwal incredibly shaken.</p>

              <p>It was not long ago that an incredible and terrifying sight filled the sky: Achaekek slew Gorum, and parts of the now-dead god rained down upon Golarion. Urwal had been going more often to this garden after seeing that spectacle and hearing reports of its effects across the world. This garden was a place of calm for him, where he hoped to find clarity to help guide the Society forward, but even that was failing him now. “I should have seen something in the stars.” He sighed, expressing his frustration to the immobile plants atop the otherwise empty rooftop. He continued quietly to himself, “Omens may be lost, but I’ve seen many hints of things to come before. But this Godsrain, I saw no sign of it. Gave no preparations. Agents were in danger and I did not prepare them.” He paused, looking over his garden. “I must do better.”</p>

              <p>Urwal’s bright yellow scales shone in the afternoon sun as he went to water the various plant life he’d nurtured atop the grand spire, finally finding some mental peace. He even allowed himself a chuckle as he thought of the reaction Ambrus Valsin, the venture-captain in charge of day-to-day operations in Skyreach, would have when this garden was revealed. “It’ll need to happen when Ambrus is in a good mood. He’ll complain about it, but he’ll come around.” As he moved to water a rather healthy raspberry bush, he noticed an unnatural shine coming from the berries upon it. It reminded him of the silver that rained from the sky the day Gorum fell.</p>
              <p>“What have we here?” he asked himself as he quickly finished watering the remainder of his garden before moving to examine the berries more closely. His troubles forgotten, he spent the remaining afternoon into the evening studying the altered fruit. Bringing the full suite of his knowledge to bear, Urwal was able to determine a few things. First, the berries now held divine power within them. He’d heard stories of those who were touched by the silver rains gaining power, but it was strange that only the berries seemed affected and not any of the other myriad plants he’d raised. “Might be the water choice,” he mused as he considered the various springs he’d transport water from. “It’s possible any one of those could be the source,” he thought aloud, recalling the complex web of watering choices largely determined by his astrological readings. Second, these berries did not ripen further or seem to change at all once removed from the bush. “Maybe I didn’t notice the coming of the Godsrain, but it would seem I made preparations all the same.”</p>

              <p>The coming days were filled with experiments and tests, until Urwal decided that he wasn’t going to learn anything significant without some risk. He ate one of the berries. The effect was immediate. It wasn’t so much that he grew stronger as it was that he was more himself than he’d ever been. The confidence he’d always felt concerning his path almost glowed within. “This is… divinity?” An ember of power glowed within him, though he could feel that its power was temporary. “Oh my. These, these must be kept close and safe. I will find a way to use them. The stars will know. This time, I will be better. I will see that they’re prepared for whatever it is that would have our agents needing such power.” A grin crossed his lizard-like face. “After all. I planted these for a reason. Now I need only find out what that reason is.”</p>
