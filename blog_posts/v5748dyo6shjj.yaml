  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the last few months,\
  \ we’ve provided a number of new mechanics in the blog to give Game Masters running\
  \ Otari-based campaigns a few more tricks to add flavor to the region based on the\
  \ exploits of the heroes in Liane Merciel’s ongoing novella, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfz?Pathfinder-Tales-The-Shroud-of-Four-Silences\"\
  >The Shroud of Four Silences</a>. We’re getting to the end of that tale, with Chapter\
  \ 11 going out to our mailing list this week. To avoid spoilers, we’re hiding this\
  \ week’s GM’s Toolkit entry below—keeping it secret, if you will—for only those\
  \ who know the true villains at the heart of the story or who don’t mind learning\
  \ it before reading it for themselves. Make sure you stay on top of future serialized\
  \ fiction offerings by ensuring your <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/account/settings/privacy\"\

  \     <details> <summary><b>Spoilers</b></summary> \n      <h3>Norgorber's Many\
  \ Masks</h3> \n      <p>The evil god Norgorber is unusual in that he maintains many\
  \ guises. His four aspects are Blackfingers, god of alchemy and poison; the Gray\
  \ Master, god of thievery; Father Skinsaw, god of ritual murder; and the Reaper\
  \ of Reputation, god of lies and secrets. His worshipers usually follow just one\
  \ of these aspects, although the heroes in <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>\
  \ discover something that those cultists dedicated to the worship of all four aspects\
  \ of Norgorber might create. </p> \n      <p>Norgorber’s worshipers delight in being\
  \ as crafty as they are cruel, and they might fashion any number of wicked items\
  \ to further their sinister plans. Followers of Norgorber might create one of these\
  \ masks, bearing the aspect of Norgorber they worship. </p> \n      <h4>Secret-Keeper’\
  s Mask — Item 3+</h4> \n      <p><b>Rare, Divination, Enchantment, Invested, Magical</b></p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Usage</b> worn; <b>Bulk</b> — <br> Each of these full-face masks\
  \ is made of stitched materials—often including humanoid skin—and has a single,\
  \ bulbous eye. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks\
  \ to Lie and the mask doesn’t impair your vision. The mask can also be activated,\
  \ with an ability based on its type.</p> \n      <p><b>Type</b> Blackfingers; <b>Level</b>\
  \ 3; Price 60 gp<br> This featureless mask is made of thin, papery skin. Its single\
  \ eye is a fragile bubble of venom-filled glass.</p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b>\
  \ [two-actions] Interact (divination); <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b>\
  \ You twist the mask’s eye and peer at an object. You know whether the object is\
  \ poison or has been poisoned, but you don’t learn the number or type of poisons\
  \ present in the object.</p> \n      <p><b>Type</b> Gray Master; <b>Level</b> 5;\
  \ <b>Price</b> 150 gp<br> This monochrome mask is made of tattered rags of gray\
  \ and black cloth and bleached fragments of skin. </p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b>\
  \ [reaction] Interact (illusion, visual); <b>Trigger</b> You succeed on a Thievery\
  \ check to Steal an item of negligible Bulk; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b>\
  \ You create an illusory duplicate of the item you just stole. This duplicate has\
  \ the appropriate appearance and weight, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate\
  \ smells. The illusion vanishes after 10 minutes, or earlier if anyone examines\
  \ or manipulates the illusory duplicate (such as to try to use it).</p> \n     \
  \ <p><b>Type</b> Father Skinsaw; <b>Level</b> 6; <b>Price</b> 250 gp<br> This mask\
  \ is a patchwork of tanned skins, each with a distinctive scar. It is contorted\
  \ into a caricature of a face with a leering eye. </p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b>\
  \ [reaction] Interact; <b>Trigger</b> You deal persistent bleed damage to a creature;\
  \ <b>Frequency</b> once per day; Effect The bleeding wound you cause is particularly\
  \ mutilating. The DC of flat checks to recover from the persistent bleed damage\
  \ is increased by 2, and the target creature has a –2 status penalty to Deception,\
  \ Diplomacy, and Performance checks while it is bleeding and for 1 minute after\
  \ it ceases bleeding.</p> \n      <p><b>Type</b> Reaper of Reputation; <b>Level</b>\
  \ 3; <b>Price</b> 60 gp<br> This mask is made of gray and black tiles sewn together.\
  \ It has a messy, inky spiral over the mouth. </p> \n      <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action]\
  \ Interact (auditory, linguistic); <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b>\
  \ You touch the mask’s spiral and identify a target creature within 30 feet. For\
  \ the next 10 minutes, any normal speech you utter can, at your discretion, be inaudible\
  \ to all creatures except the target creature, who can hear you clearly regardless\
  \ of ambient sound so long as it is within 1 mile. This ability doesn’t silence\
  \ magical words, such as the verbal component of spellcasting or commands to activate\
  \ magic items.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7980dd7f-722d-40d1-9577-0bc1ef95b46f/011320_SkinsawMask.jpg\"\
