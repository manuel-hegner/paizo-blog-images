  ><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>: Crowe the bloodrager. While the complete rules\
  \ for making your own bloodrager characters will debut this August in the <i>Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</i>, Crowe features in this year’s Free RPG Day adventure, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy959k\"><i>Pathfinder Module: Risen from the Sands</i></a>. Crowe will\
  \ also be a playable character in the not-yet-announced Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game set due for release in February 2015.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>When Crowe was a young man waiting to depart on his first horse gathering,\
  \ he had the same dream every night for five weeks. It always started and ended\
  \ the same way. Each time the storm came. Each time the stampede thundered out of\
  \ the canyon to the south. Each time his body was trampled to pulp before he woke\
  \ up soaking with sweat.</p> \n     <p>Every night.</p> \n     <p>Crowe was born\
  \ under an auspicious sign during a thunderstorm that scoured the Storval Plateau\
  \ one burning autumn evening. After generations of uncertain prophecy by the tribe’\
  s shamans, the holy ones were reluctant to predict much about the newborn aside\
  \ from foretelling that he would one day become a significant force.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>From a young age, Crowe was trained to be a perfect groom, and it was clear\
  \ that in time he would become a good trainer. He learned from his mother and father,\
  \ as well as from his aunts and uncles, for even among the animal-loving Shriikirri-Quah,\
  \ his family had a way with horses. They even supplied many a burn-rider of the\
  \ Sklar-Quah with their signature steeds, and foreigners came from miles around\
  \ seeking to trade for the family’s fearless stallions.</p> \n     <p>Crowe’s father\
  \ was known throughout the Storval Plateau for his skill at capturing and breaking\
  \ wild horses, and his mother could read the face of nature as if it were her own\
  \ child’s. Together, Crowe’s parents trained their horses, content with their lives.\
  \ But their son was becoming unruly.</p> \n     <p>As a youth, Crowe often got into\
  \ fights then claimed that he didn’t remember how the scraps had started. He would\
  \ feel his heart beating against his ribs. He would hear the blood thrumming in\
  \ his ears, and that would be the last thing he recalled. People in the tribe grew\
  \ cautious around the boy. After far too many of these sorts of scuffles, his mother\
  \ began asking him why he was so angry. Crowe claimed again that he didn’t remember,\
  \ that the last thing he had heard before each fight broke out was the storm.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As Crowe grew stronger of frame, he learned the traditional ways of\
  \ Shoanti warfare. He trained with the weapons of his ancestors and learned how\
  \ to protect his people and their way of life. Crowe learned the klar, mastered\
  \ the earthbreaker, and also studied the natural world and the ways of magic that\
  \ his mother followed. Throughout his tutelage, he challenged his elders and was\
  \ challenged by his not-so-infrequent gaps in memory. Some in the tribe thought\
  \ this was simply an excuse for his misbehavior, and many blamed his parents for\
  \ his violent outbursts.</p> \n     <p>Though Crowe was still considered to be too\
  \ young for a long outing, his father decided that taking his son on his first horse\
  \ gathering would teach the boy discipline. The herds would be funneling through\
  \ the canyon in a matter of weeks, and Crowe’s father hoped to gather a few more\
  \ horses, the most prized of which were the foals of Bright Star—a stallion that\
  \ had eluded him for the past five years. Rounding up even one or two of the foals\
  \ would be a major boon to his family’s stock.</p> \n     <p>Crowe, his father,\
  \ and seven other men and women from the tribe traveled for three days. Horses are\
  \ predictable beasts, and the Shoanti knew where the herd moved in the uplands.\
  \ The herd would race through the canyon until it leveled out to a dry riverbed\
  \ that cut through the blistered land. When the herd came through, the hunters would\
  \ be ready with ropes and snares.</p> \n     <p>In order to test Crowe’s patience,\
  \ his father sent the youth ahead to the canyon’s mouth. He wanted his boy to wait,\
  \ to listen to hooves and snorts echoing down the canyon. He wanted him to throw\
  \ the loop around a horse that he could call his own. He wanted Crowe to concentrate\
  \ on his task and listen past the distraction of the storm.</p> \n     <p>Crowe\
  \ crouched upon a flat umber rock, trembling with terror. All he could hear was\
  \ the storm in the distance, a low, rolling rumble that thundered in his eardrums.\
  \ He was sure what he heard was his fear, his rage. This was the canyon. This was\
  \ the night he would die. Why couldn’t he just leave? Just walk away from it all?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tradition.</p> \n     <p>The thunder beating in his ears changed. It\
  \ wasn’t just internal; it was echoing through the canyon. The herd was coming.\
  \ Crowe looked to the sky as dark clouds rolling in from the south obscured the\
  \ setting sun. The others shouted orders and set up positions with their snares.\
  \ Crowe scrambled back to his designated post as hundreds of horses filled the canyon,\
  \ their hoofbeats driving a pounding echo off the canyon walls.</p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ the storm broke. Thunder rumbled and crashed through the canyon and lightning\
  \ bathed its rusty walls in flashes of white.</p> \n     <p>After the storm had\
  \ passed, Crowe awoke to find his cousin sitting on his chest and slapping his face,\
  \ claiming that he was to blame for the carnage spread all around him. More than\
  \ a dozen horses lay dead, and half of the hunting party lay trampled in the riverbed.\
  \ They said Crowe was to blame. They said there was no storm. They said he had done\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p>Slick with blood, confused, and full of no uncertain amount\
  \ of shame, he stumbled through the night. The dawn broke on Crowe’s new life—a\
  \ life not burdened by tradition, a life that was numb to fear.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
