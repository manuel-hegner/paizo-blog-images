  \ his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> \n    \
  \   <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer\
  \ trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> \n       <li><b>Robyn Way</b>,\
  \ played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life\
