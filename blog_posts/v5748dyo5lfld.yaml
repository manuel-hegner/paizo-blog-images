  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">My name is Chris Pramas is I'll be your guest\
  \ blogger today. You may know me as the founder and president of Green Ronin Publishing,\
  \ the author of the <i>AD&amp;D Guide to Hell</i>, a contributor to the Emerald\
  \ Spire superdungeon, or the designer of the Dragon Age RPG. The fine people at\
  \ Paizo Publishing have given me the chance to tell you about Green Ronin's latest\
  \ Kickstarter, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1780208966/advanced-bestiary-for-the-pathfinder-rpg\"\
  >the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i> for the Pathfinder RPG</a>!</span></p> \n     <p>Veterans\
  \ of the d20 years will no doubt recognize the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i>. It originally\
  \ came out in 2005 and was an immediate hit. The book provided over 100 templates\
  \ and a sample creature for each of them. The utility it provided to GMs was immense.\
  \ As we like to say, the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i> makes every other monster book\
  \ you own more valuable.</p> \n     <p>Now we are bringing the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i>\
  \ back and updating it for Pathfinder. This was an easy decision to make because\
  \ we've received so many requests from Pathfinder fans to do so. Last summer, for\
  \ example, I went down to PaizoCon on Sunday. I was there in no official capacity.\
  \ I showed up to take part in the miniatures trade and to hang out in the bar and\
  \ see friends. Nonetheless, multiple people came up to me and said, \"Please update\
  \ the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i>!\" It was something we were already talking about\
  \ after the success of our Freeport Kickstarter earlier this year, but the personal\
  \ pleas certainly brought it home!</p> \n     <p>We realize, of course, that there\
  \ are many Pathfinder fans who were not around in 2005 and that's one reason we've\
  \ had our Pathfinder developer, Owen Stephens, creating some new sample monsters\
  \ using templates from the book. He started with three new creatures, the Cave Ogre,\
  \ Toxic Goblin, and Autumn Genie. Then he took those same base creatures and made\
  \ three different creatures with other templates: the Herald of Ragnarok, Darkling,\
  \ and Umbrated Genie. <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1780208966/advanced-bestiary-for-the-pathfinder-rpg/posts/684458\"\
  >You can download all those sample monsters for free in Wednesday's update</a>.</p>\

  \      <br>Illustration by Shawn Sharp\n     </div> \n     <p>The great news is\
  \ that we've already hit our basic funding goal and unlocked two stretch goals (a\
  \ new cover for the book and 16 pages of new content). You can be assured therefore\
  \ that the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i> is happening and you can pledge in confidence.\
  \ We are pushing to hit at least two more stretch goals, however. If we can get\
  \ up to $45,000, we will print the book in full color and commission brand new color\
  \ art for the whole thing. This is how we really want to do the book and we've got\
  \ until Monday, December 9. Let's make it happen!</p> \n     <p>If you are a loyal\
  \ Pathfinder fan, you've actually been enjoying the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i> for\
  \ years already. Here's a list of all the Paizo books that have used templates from\
  \ the book. Clearly Paizo knows something about the <i>Advanced Bestiary</i>. Check\
  \ out the Kickstarter and find out what!</p> \n     <div style=\"margin-bottom:2px\"\
