  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“REAGENTS!”</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ goblin, Fumbus, came bounding out of the palms onto the beach with something in\
  \ his hands raised triumphantly high. </p> \n     <p>Valeros had to repress the\
  \ urge to pinch his brow and sigh. Whatever the excitable alchemist was on about,\
  \ Valeros did not share his enthusiasm, and had a sinking feeling that was not about\
  \ to change. </p> \n     <p>He had already chipped the blade of his sword beyond\
  \ a whetstone’s help hacking down a half-dozen mahogany trunks for a raft; his mood\
  \ wasn't going to be improving anytime soon.</p> \n     <p>“Reagents!” Fumbus skipped\
  \ up to Valeros to show off his discovery. As soon as they got near Valeros’s nose,\
  \ there was no mistaking what the blackish seed-sized pellets in the goblin's hands\
  \ were.</p> \n     <p>“Eeuughh!” He reared back out of smelling distance. “Don't\
  \ shove it my face, you—” Valeros thought back to all the innumerable goblins who\
  \ had cursed at him to think of a word to really express his displeasure, and then\
  \ gave up on it. “We're already up 'reagent' creek without a paddle as it is.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Fumbus giggled and dropped the bat guano into the patched-up grog barrel\
  \ lying amid the hundreds of other tide-tossed fragments from their reef-broken\
  \ ship strewn across the beach. After a moment of rubbing his hands together, the\
  \ goblin cackled hysterically in a way that Valeros had come to associate with imminent\
  \ explosions.</p> \n     <p><em>“REAGENTS!”</em></p> \n     <p>“I get it! I can\
  \ <em>speak</em> Taldane!” Valeros called after him, but the goblin, mercifully,\
  \ had dashed back into the waving blade-bushes that marked the edge of the jungle,\
  \ presumably toward the source of more nocturnal leavings.</p> \n     <p>He was\
  \ as puzzled at Fumbus’s grog barrel as he was at Fumbus himself. Merisiel had challenged\
  \ him to a drinking contest over that same barrel earlier that evening, back when\
  \ they were all still on the same Arcadia-bound vessel. The voyage had been so long\
  \ and tedious that he'd forgotten his two rules of drinking contests: one, never\
  \ getting into a drinking contest with someone several centuries older than you;\
  \ and two, never get into a drinking contest when there wasn’t more on the line\
  \ than bragging rights. The problem with drinking contests was that no matter who\
  \ wins, the next morning you’re both losing, and neither of you can remember who\
  \ won anyway. Drinking was supposed to be fun, not a competition, after all.</p>\

  all\"> \n     <br> \n     <p>The last memory he had was of the white-haired, black-eyed\
  \ elf’s face going all fuzzy. Then, all of a sudden, everything was salty, wet,\
  \ and getting dark fast—in that order. It took all his strength to kick his armored\
  \ body upward, toward the sun shimmering above him on the ocean's surface; it took\
  \ all his wits to keep from crying out and filling his lungs with seawater.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The bay of this seemingly uninhabited island was choked with the wrecked\
  \ detritus of the brigantine, and every once in a while, the tides disgorged a passenger\
  \ or sailor that Valeros recognized when they were onboard, and alive. Thank the\
  \ Accidental God that all his friends had survived the wreck; sadly, they appeared\
  \ to be the only ones. </p> \n     <p>That is, except Fumbus, whom Valeros had not\
  \ realized stowed away on their vessel back in Absalom until the goblin popped out\
  \ from beneath a coil of beached rope with a sputtering cry that scared him half\
  \ to death. The self-taught alchemist soon began collecting random crap—literally—\
  and filling his reclaimed cask with it.</p> \n     <p>Valeros had no idea what Fumbus\
  \ was making, and once again found himself wishing Seoni was here to tell him. Everyone\
  \ else had fanned out to look for food or friendly locals, and he had been left\
  \ behind, as per usual, to do the grunt work because he had the muscles. He had\
  \ spent several hours picking out, cutting down, and pruning the logs, then laying\
  \ four side-by-side near the water’s edge—to make the completed raft easier to launch—\
  then two under and above those at either end as pressure bars. By the time he was\
  \ pulling down vines from trees, he was contemplating selling his soul for a drink,\
  \ any drink—even water! The sun had had several hours to bake him inside his own\
  \ breastplate. He felt like an engorged sweat sponge.</p> \n     <p>He thought he\
  \ had grabbed the sturdiest vines he could find, but when he tugged the binding\
  \ for the two front crossbeams together, the cord snapped in half, and he dropped\
  \ on his backside in the sand.</p> \n     <p>Loud laughter behind him brought him\
  \ to his feet, drawing his wrecked sword more from pique than caution. The goblin\
  \ had finished whatever contraption he had been working on, having lashed on a conical\
  \ nose to the top of the barrel with some of the vines Valeros had set aside for\
  \ his raft.</p> \n     <p>“Okay, you!” Valeros pointed his sword at the lashed-together\
  \ barrel. “This is what we call 'antisocial behavior.' <em>I</em> tore down those\
  \ vines for my raft. <em>I</em> am trying to save our lives by getting us off this\
  \ gods-forsaken island. <em>You</em> are yelling things in my face and stealing\
  \ my stuff! Those vines are mine by right!” </p> \n     <p>He stepped toward the\
  \ cone-headed barrel, but Fumbus bared his sharp, tiny teeth and leapt in front\
  \ of him. “No no no no no!”</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>Valeros sighed. “You know\
  \ what? You win. I’m sick of this yesterday. I'm gonna go lie down on the ground\
  \ over there. Maybe when Kyra returns, she can tell me what's going on. But I find\
  \ everything you do unfathomable.” </p> \n     <p>He retreated up the beach to the\
  \ shade of the palms, dropped down onto his back, and prayed for a swift death</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The goblin’s head loomed into his field of vision. The makeshift goggles\
  \ the alchemist wore magnified his eyes so they bulged like magic orbs. </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Do you want to see?” Fumbus whispered without prompting and unscrewed\
  \ a scroll case he kept slung across his back</p> \n     <p>“Um, no. That's alright.\
  \ You really don’t need to...” But Fumbus was already pulling out a complex diagram,\
  \ unfurling it on the fighter’s chest. Valeros raised his head far enough to see\
  \ that it depicted a barrel, not unlike the one Fumbus was messing about with at\
  \ the moment. Various incomprehensible symbols had been scrawled across it, but\
  \ one in particular stood out: the word “Droven” bearing the look of a signature\
  \ more than footnotes of a technical schematic. </p> \n     <p>“Droven showed Fumbus\
  \ how to make something like this once,” the goblin said. “With better supplies,\
  \ and different reagents, but I can make it work.”</p> \n     <p>Intrigued, Valeros\
  \ sat up on his elbows and studied the chart. “Your old half-orc buddy? You miss\
  \ him a lot, don’t you, Fumbus? We’ve all lost friends, little guy, and I know it\
  \ can be hard to move on.” He felt suddenly guilty for giving the goblin such a\
  \ hard time.</p> \n     <p>“Droven <em>is</em> lost,” Fumbus blurted with a surprising\
  \ ferocity. “But he can help us even when he’s missing!</p> \n     <p>“Huh?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Fumbus ran down to the barrel halfway down the beach, tugging Valeros’\
  s arm to follow. “Come, come! Make this way!” </p> \n     <p>“For Cayden's sake,\
  \ Fumbus, I just laid down!” </p> \n     <p>When they reached the barrel, Fumbus\
  \ snapped two shards of flint together, and a spark sprung to the oil-slick wick\
  \ Valeros now saw dangled from one side. It began to fizzle and shorten.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Fumbus gesticulated wildly at the cove below. “Into the sea it goes, unless\
  \ you also want to explode!”</p> \n     <p>“Oh, <em>those</em> kind of 'reagents!’\
  \ Well, why didn’t you say so in the first place?” </p> \n     <p>With a curse,\
  \ Valeros hefted the sputtering barrel on his shoulder and threw it as hard as he\
  \ could down the beach. It bounced and arced into the water, floating out several\
  \ yards… </p> \n     <p>Suddenly, Fumbus threw up his arms, blocking his face, and\
  \ Valeros copied him, just as the barrel exploded into a massive waterspout that\
  \ shot straight up into the clear blue sky and dropped a curtain of seawater onto\
  \ their heads, along with a shower of springs, cogs, and steaming twists of metal.\
  \ He managed to grab a bronze tentacle out of the air before it landed on his head.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>An overturned clockwork vessel bobbed in the surf, semi ovoid and in\
  \ the shape of an octopus’s head. Half of its grasping tentacles were severed and\
  \ sputtered with silvery light. Some still grasped chests and gold statues and other\
  \ valuables the apparatus had been trying to loot from the wreck on the ocean floor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Stumbling out one of the shattered bulbous portholes where the octopus’\
  s eyes would be came the apparatus's operator, pale Chelaxian skin bleeding and\
  \ satin finery shredded from numerous miniature shrapnel wounds.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Nice reflexes,” Fumbus said, nodding at the clockwork limb Valeros was still clutching.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Valeros laughed mirthlessly. “Lying in wait for hapless ships to come\
  \ by then scavenging their cargo, eh?” </p> \n     <p>The Chelaxian coughed up seawater\
  \ and tried to swing a boathook-like weapon in his general direction, but Valeros\
  \ didn’t even bother drawing his sword. He backhanded the submariner across the\
  \ face with the bronze tentacle and knocked him flat on his back in the surf.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Valeros placed a heavy boot on the man’s chest, pushing him into the\
  \ soft, wet sand. “You just let me know when you’re ready to tell me everything\
  \ I want to know about whatever scam it is you’re running here.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  And where our friends are,” Fumbus demanded.</p> \n     <p>“Yeah! Tell us what you\
  \ know about them, too!” Valeros glanced back at the treeline. The rest of his party\
  \ had been gone an unusually long time.</p> \n     <p>The Chelaxian spat. “The others\
  \ will have taken care of them by now. I was just sent to dig through the wreckage,\
  \ but the others got to have…a lot more fun.”</p> \n     <p>“Got another barrel\
  \ like that in you, Fumbus?” Valeros frowned. “I have a feeling this chump and his\
  \ metal contraption are going to be the least of our worries.”</p> \n    </blockquote>\
