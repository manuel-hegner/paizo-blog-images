  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This week brings\
  \ the final six reveals for the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles Undead Horde Builder Series</a>, which is set for a September debut. This\
  \ set of 12 figures features new sculpts and repainted favorites to help you swell\
  \ the legions of undead in your Pathfinder campaigns. Figures come one per pack,\
  \ with 24 $2.99 packs in a single \"gravity feed\" display. Our first Builder Series\
  \ release, <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins!</a> came out last week,\
  \ and reviews have been very positive. We think you'll like the <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\"\
  >Undead Horde</a> just as much!</span></p> \n    <p>But enough preamble! Let's get\
  \ right to the miniatures!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Ghoul.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Ghoul_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week we have the Ghoul, everyone's\
  \ favorite long-tongued bad guy this side of Gene Simmons. The figure debuted in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> set, and has since\
  \ become one of the most popular singles from that collection. This time he's got\
  \ a chalkier, grayer cast to his skin. We though he deserved a repeat performance.\
  \ The Ghoul is a common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-LadyGhoul.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-LadyGhoul_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We didn't want the Ghoul to be too lonely\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde</a>, so we decided to also\
  \ include this charming Lady Ghoul. While this figure may look like a new sculpt,\
  \ in fact it's a repaint of a <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ figure we haven't previewed yet, so consider this an ominous hint of things to\
  \ come on the deadly seas ahead of us. The Lady Ghoul is a common figure.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Festrog.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Festrog_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a genuine new sculpt, the Festrog, an\
  \ undead creature that crawls on all fours that we first introduced way back in\
  \ the old GameMastery Modules line (<a href=\"/products/btpy85en\">Hungry are the\
  \ Dead</a>, to be specific). The CR 1 creature's statistics got a Pathfinder upgrade\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Bestiary 3</a>. Since Festrogs often appear\
  \ in gangs or packs, we slated him at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Ghost.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Ghost_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This familiar face originally appeared as the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8qjd&quot;\">Spectre</a> from our first set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>. The sculpt resurfaced as the <a href=\"/products/btpy8uae\"\
  >Festering Spirit</a> for last year's convention season promotional figure, and\
  \ now he makes his third (and likely final) appearance as a Ghost. The Ghost is\
  \ a rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Vampire.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Vampire_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Another favorite from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, the Vampire returns in <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\"\
  >Undead Horde</a> with an all-new paint scheme and the same dark designs on your\
  \ player characters. The Vampire is a rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Wraith.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71174-Wraith_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week we've got the Wraith, a new paint scheme\
  \ on a favorite figure from <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>.\
  \ Now with deep purples but with the same malevolence as ever, the Wraith looks\
  \ forward to wrapping your player characters in an energy-draining embrace. Give\
  \ him a hug! The Wraith is a rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this set. Next\
  \ week we'll return to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ preview, and I've got some exciting developments to reveal shortly thereafter.\
  \ Believe it or not, we're currently finalizing the set list for THREE sets from\
  \ now, and that's not including additional Builder Series and Encounter Pack releases\
  \ that will be making their way to you throughout the rest of 2013 and into 2014!</p>\
