  >SPECIAL ABILITIES</p> \n       <p><b>Alluring Aroma (Su)</b> The feast golem exudes\
  \ a powerful scent that compels creatures to physically attack it. Affected creatures\
  \ are compelled to attack the feast golem using only a bite attack for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ Creatures that normally do not possess a natural bite attack temporarily gain\
  \ one while under the alluring aroma’s effect; this attack inflicts (1d3 + Strength\
  \ modifier) damage for Medium creatures (1d2+Str for Small creatures) and does not\
  \ provoke attacks of opportunity from the golem. Creatures may make a DC 19 Will\
  \ save to resist the feast golem’s alluring aroma and act normally. Creatures who\
  \ succeed at their saving throw are immune to this ability for 24 hours. This save\
  \ is an enchantment (compulsion) effect and does not affect creatures that do not\
  \ need to eat.</p> \n       <p><b>Amorphous Anatomy (Ex)</b> Composed of many different\
  \ dishes, the feast golem has no discernible anatomy. This grants it a 50% chance\
  \ to ignore additional damage caused by critical hits and sneak attacks and grants\
  \ it immunity to polymorph effects. A feast golem recovers from physical blindness\
  \ or deafness in 1d4 rounds as it regrows new sensory organs.</p> \n       <p><b>Bountiful\
  \ Corpse (Sp)</b> Consuming the corpse of a feast golem grants the effect of a heroes’\
  \ feast, but those that partake are fatigued for 1 day.</p> \n       <p><b>Delicious\
  \ (Ex)</b> Feast golems take a -2 penalty on Escape Artist and combat maneuver checks\
  \ made to escape a grapple against any creature that has a bite attack with the\
  \ grab ability.</p> \n       <p><b>Immune to Magic (Ex)</b> A feast golem is immune\
  \ to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,\
  \ certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted\
  \ below. A feast golem's spell-like abilities cannot be used to affect itself or\
  \ other feast golems.<br> </p>\n       <ul>\n        <li><i>Create food and water</i>\
  \ instantly heals the golem for 3d6 hit points.</li> \n        <li><i>Feast of ashes</i>\
  \ negates the feast golem’s alluring aroma and fast healing abilities for 24 hours.</li>\
  \ \n        <li>A <i>heroes’ feast</i> spell cast directly on the golem increases\
  \ its size by one category, doubling its height and increasing its weight by a factor\
  \ of 8 for one hour. The golem gains a +4 size bonus to its Strength, a -2 size\
  \ penalty to its Dexterity, an extra 10 feet of movement speed, and increases its\
  \ reach by 5 feet.</li> \n        <li><i>Putrefy food and drink</i> causes portions\
  \ of the golem’s body to rot and fall away, inflicting 1d4 points of damage (no\
  \ save).</li> \n       </ul> \n       <p><b>Indestructible (Ex)</b> A feast golem\
  \ is nearly impossible to destroy. Even reduced below 0 hit points, its fast healing\
  \ continues to restore hit points, though the golem is helpless unless above 0 hit\
  \ points. It can only be destroyed if the golem’s heart is consumed: an ossified\
  \ loaf of fruitcake, reeking of bad liquor and covered in various colorful molds.\
  \ In order to successfully eat the golem’s heart, a creature must make a DC 17 Fortitude\
  \ saving throw every round for 4 rounds—somewhat of a challenge due to its dryness\
  \ (and the feast golem’s fast healing). Failing this saving throw indicates that\
  \ the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. This ability is Charisma-based.\
  \ </p>\n       <p><b>Slippery (Ex)</b> Oozing butter, fat, and sticky syrup from\
  \ every crevice in its misshapen form, the feast golem has a +8 bonus on all Escape\
  \ Artist checks and to its CMD against grapples.</p> \n       <p><b>Unstoppable\
  \ (Ex)</b> The feast golem ignores penalties for difficult terrain, and its movement\
  \ increases by 10 feet.</p> \n       <p>The unholy machinations of mad sorcerer-chefs\
  \ or unstable goblin alchemists, feast golems are walking amalgams of food, drink,\
  \ and flatware given horrible purpose by magic. Stitched together from leftovers\
  \ and hearty meals, no two feast golems look exactly the same. The same magic that\
  \ animates their delectable flesh also maintains their various ingredients at appropriate\
  \ temperatures, preserving both hot and cold dishes indefinitely. Affluent fey or\
  \ magically-versed nobles may employ the creations, disguised as a sumptuous meal\
  \ to deter would-be assassins at the dinner table, but just as often their creation\
  \ is an accident wrought from the overeager joining of edibles and enchantment.\
  \ The precise origins of the feast golem remain a mystery, and its means of destruction\
  \ not for the faint of stomach.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n     </div>\n    </div>\
