  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">When Quinn needed to work,\
  \ he liked to get out. It was amazing what a walk, a chat with a neighbor, or a\
  \ fresh environment would do to dislodge stray thoughts or connect fresh insights.\
  \ Of course, that wasn’t the only reason Quinn found himself at his usual corner\
  \ at Amberlight, his table covered in ledgers, timetables, and a map of the city.\
  \ The Merrymead Menace had struck again. There were only a few more days until the\
  \ festival, and the thief was taking it upon themself to rob a different restaurant\
  \ or inn every night.</p>\n      <p><em>Not that they’d bother hitting here</em>,\
  \ Quinn thought. <em>Target pattern: establishments with occupancy over one-hundred-twenty-five\
  \ guests, catering primarily to out-of-town clientele</em>. The exact opposite of\
  \ this cozy cafe. The Merrymead Menace was clearly looking to separate some wealthy\
  \ tourists from their valuables, then blend back into a crowd. If it weren’t for\
  \ their seemingly impossible scale of activity and a certain flair for the dramatic—\
  last night’s inn had seen every single safe box emptied, jewelry and gold and letters\
  \ of banking replaced by a single dull copper coin in each—they’d would hardly stand\
  \ out against the lost purses that inevitably happened around the winter holiday’\
  s raucous pub crawls and outdoor parties.</p>\n      <p>With one last look around\
  \ the room for his favorite barista—<em>Odd... New scent in the air.</em>—Quinn\
  \ turned back to his work, tapping his pen against the alchemical flask sitting\
  \ on the table in the hope the damn thing would change colors. No luck. He scratched\
  \ another region off the map. <em>Not from the Looms, either, then. </em> While\
  \ Quinn appreciated knowing he wouldn’t have to spend the rest of the day canvassing\
  \ up and down the clothing district’s notorious hills, he’d have preferred to know\
  \ where <em>to</em> look, rather than where not to. A bit of flattery and a fresh\
  \ lemon cake from the local bakery had bought Quinn a favor with the local constabulary’\
  s evidence department, but he’d been able to borrow only enough of the mud collected\
  \ from a windowsill to run one more test. Quinn furrowed his brow as he shook another\
  \ vial.</p>\n      <p><em>He always</em> was <em>better at this sort of thing.</em>\
  \ Quinn split his thoughts, setting the majority of his mind on the notes in front\
  \ of him. But with one part, Quinn drifted to the past. He’d met Arlo right when\
  \ he’d been getting his start as a freelance detective. He’d needed a consult on\
  \ the case of the vanishing coins, and several recommendations had pointed him in\
  \ direction of a talented forensic chemist. Frankly, Quinn had disliked the man\
  \ when they first met, with his adherence to protocol, but he’d identified the solvent\
  \ used in the case with nothing more than a cursory glance, so Quinn resolved to\
  \ work together.</p>\n      <p>Time and shared ambitions have a way of bridging\
  \ the gaps between even the most different people. Waiting for lab work or a long\
  \ stakeout left plenty of time to talk. Talks of the theater turned into a date\
  \ to see <em>Echoes of Everfall</em>; talks of the virtues of Taldan white wines\
  \ compared to Chelaxian reds flowed into a weekend getaway to the vineyards of Carpenden.\
  \ Talks of a longer partnership turned naturally into a marriage, and for a time,\
  \ everything was perfect.</p>\n      <p>But time can separate two ambitious people\
  \ when their aims begin to diverge. First it was a canceled dinner here or there,\
  \ spurred on by a breakthrough in a case (both men understood that you had to strike\
  \ when a breakthrough came). Then it was a few weeks’ deployment to investigate\
  \ this village or that town. When they did talk, it was less and less of theater\
  \ or wine, more and more of work. By the time Arlo was scouted by the Qadira division\
  \ of the Society of the Scales and Quinn had received that offer in Andoran, there\
  \ wasn’t any doubt that it was a parting. They were two brilliant detectives at\
  \ the height of their careers—they could deduce how things were going to end.</p>\n\

  \ Menace.<br>\n         Art by Kiki Moch Rizky.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <p>A footstep to Quinn’s left, intentionally loud enough to be audible but\
  \ not so much to be alarming, pulled him back to the present. Without turning his\
  \ eyes from his notes, Quinn smiled as he moved his hand to clear a spot on the\
  \ table. “Quinn, you know the only person I let do alchemy in my establishment is\
  \ the chef.” Rhys placed a cup of (unordered) coffee on the table. “I can’t be making\
  \ exceptions, even for my favorite customer.”</p>\n      <p>Quinn hastily noted\
  \ the color in the vial before moving it back to his bag. “They have me on the case\
  \ of the Merrymead Menace,” the investigator said as he attempted to piece together\
  \ some numbers in a ledger before he became too distracted. Rhys nodded. “This residue\
  \ narrows the culprit down to either the riverbanks, central square, or old ironworkers’\
  \ quarters, but there’s too many establishments to cover.”</p>\n      <p>“Maybe\
  \ you could investigate during the festival?”</p>\n      <p>Quinn shook his head.\
  \ He tried to keep business and pleasure as separate as possible, these days—and\
  \ turned to Rhys. “By that time, the culprit—\"</p>\n      <p><em>Apron steamed\
  \ two days earlier than normal. Fresh haircut. That same floral scent.</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>“Roses.” Quinn didn’t need to look behind the man’s back to notice the\
  \ bouquet. “You’re going all out decorating this year, aren’t you?”</p>\n      <p>Rhys\
  \ coughed a bit, taking the bouquet out from behind his back. “I… thought they’\
  d look nice along the bar?”</p>\n      <p><em>Slight flush. Eyes turning to door.\
  \ A charming vocal hitch.</em> “Or maybe they’re for a gentleman you’re planning\
  \ on asking to a Merrymead party?”</p>\n      <p>Rhys laughed, and the sound warmed\
  \ the cafe. “Really, Quinn, nothing gets past you. I enjoy the big night out with\
  \ the group as much as the next guy, but I was thinking a quieter festival for two\
  \ might be nice this year.”</p>\n      <p>Quinn agreed—he was about the same age\
  \ as Rhys, and by now a quieter Merrymead for two sounded nicer than a loud party.\
  \ Two people enjoying a walk along the river, two cups of spiced wine, two… Quinn\
  \ bolted to his feet. “Say that again.”</p>\n      <p>Rhys stood up, smoothing out\
  \ his apron and running a hand through his hair, tightening his grip on the bouquet\
  \ slightly enough that even Quinn’s finely honed senses didn’t notice. “I was saying\
  \ a quiet festival for two might—\"</p>\n      <p>But Quinn was already shoveling\
  \ his notes into his bag. “Exactly! For two—two of them! That’s how they’re covering\
  \ that much space. Identical build, height, weight as well—it’s the Extrina Twins\
  \ back in town, I’m sure of it!” He dashed for the door “Perfect! Absolutely perfect!\
  \ Thank you!”</p>\n      <p>It was only when the chill of winter’s air touched Quinn’\
  s face that something clicked in his mind, something obvious that he should say.\
  \ He opened the door again, locking eyes with the barista.</p>\n      <p>“Good luck\
  \ on your date!”</p>\n      <p>Rhys sighed to himself as the master investigator’\
  s coat swept out into the streets. “Really, Quinn, nothing gets past you.”</p>\n\
