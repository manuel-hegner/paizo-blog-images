  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When we were first dividing\
  \ the nations of the Inner Sea region into the ten meta-regions that comprise the\
  \ Age of Lost Omens campaign setting, one of the first ones we floated as a proof\
  \ of concept was the Impossible Lands—the nations of Geb, Nex, and Jalmeray, and\
  \ the magic blasted wilderness of the Mana Wastes. This is the \"high magic\" part\
  \ of the core setting, where centuries of warfare between archmages shaped the land\
  \ and imbued the local culture with magic unlike anywhere else on Golarion. </p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>At the heart of this region are the nations of Geb and Nex,\
  \ each named for the mighty archmage who founded it and home to incredible wonders,\
  \ even millennia after the conflict that came to define them. In Nex, the northern\
  \ of the two lands, the mysterious Arclords carry on the magical research started\
  \ by their founder, who disappeared into an extraplanar realm at the climax of his\
  \ war with Geb. In Quantium, the nation's capital, towers soar above vast palaces\
  \ illumined by the ethereal glow of perpetual arcane lights, and visitors are as\
  \ likely to run into a golem on the street as they are an ambitious scholar of wizardry.\

  \     </div> \n     <p>To Nex's south lies Geb, a land of undead ruled by the ghostly\
  \ necromancer of the same name. The debauchery of the Blood Lords who govern the\
  \ nation at Geb's behest is legendary, and nearly every day visitors to the capital\
  \ of Mechitar can witness glorious feasts of humanoid flesh, parades to the glory\
  \ of Geb and Urgathoa, or misery wrested upon the living for the pure enjoyment\
  \ of the ruling class. Geb's fertile fields are the breadbasket of the region, for\
  \ nearly all of its produce can be exported to other nations, Geb's own populace\
  \ needing no sustenance from the earth. A constant target for enemies of undead—\
  from the displaced Lastwall Knights to the church of Pharasma—Geb has no shortage\
  \ of adventure for those who dare risk passage across its forsaken borders.</p>\

  \   </div> \n     <p>Between Geb and Nex stretches the Spellscar Desert of the Mana\
  \ Wastes. Having changed hands countless times in the centuries of magical warfare\
  \ between the two nations, the wastes were a constant battlefront, and ages of arcane\
  \ attacks and defenses did irreparable harm to the land itself. Primal storms of\
  \ raw magical energy flow in unnatural patterns through the unforgiving desert,\
  \ and pockets of dead magic leave travelers with no defenses against the mutated\
  \ inhabitants of the scarred region. In the Duchy of Alkenstar, however, the innovative\
  \ inhabitants have embraced technology as a defense against the wastes' threats,\
  \ developing new alchemical and clockwork wonders to protect them. The most closely\
  \ guarded of their secrets is the key to firearms, which have slowly spread from\
  \ Alkenstar throughout other parts of the world, but which are still largely produced\
  \ in the duchy itself, guaranteeing a stable economy for the isolated city-state\
  \ even amid the chaos of the Mana Wastes.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Across the Obari Ocean from Nex lies the island nation of\
  \ Jalmeray, home to a large population of ethnic Vudrani. Here the mystical practices\
  \ of psychic magic are common, and students of more martial pursuits harness the\
  \ elemental powers within themselves in the monastic Houses of Perfection. Just\
  \ as Qadira serves as the Inner Sea's gateway to the riches and wonders of the Padishah\
  \ Empire of Kelesh, Jalmeray offers just a taste of the mysteries and power of distant\
  \ Vudra, and many heroes stop here on their journey eastward around Casmaron only\
  \ to find enough adventure here to keep them in Jalmeray for decades.</p> \n   \
