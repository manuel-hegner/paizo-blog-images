  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings! I'm Liz Spain, the newest\
  \ game designer press-ganged to join the <a href=\"/pacg\">Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game</a> design team. It's electrifying to work with such an amazing team\
  \ and get to play with adapting such a rich world. You might know me as the mad\
  \ mastermind behind the steampunk exploration game, <a href=\"http://incredibleexpeditionsgame.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Incredible Expeditions: Quest for Atlantis</a>, which hits wide\
  \ release in January.</p> \n    <p>Since the work I'm putting into the next set\
  \ for the Pathfinder ACG remains tightly under secret protection by blood-oath and\
  \ ninja guards, it seems like a good time to wax rhapsodic on game design.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Designing the Aesthetics of Gameplay</h2> \n    <p>Even the thinkiest of\
  \ games can be considered an aesthetic experience. The feeling of rolling smooth,\
  \ cool dice, the laughs you share with friends, and the calculations you run in\
  \ your head all add up to the experience of the game as a whole. A well-crafted\
  \ game design builds highs and lows into the gameplay.</p> \n    <p>The first scenario\
  \ of \"The Wormwood Mutiny\" executes this idea beautifully. The adventurers have\
  \ finished the base scenarios; they've defeated a number of villains and scavenged\
  \ some good equipment. Spirits are running high. Everyone's excited to open the\
  \ box of Adventure 1 to continue kicking pirate butt. Instead the table goes quiet\
  \ as they read the first scenario and it's implications become clear:</p> \n   \

  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-PressGanged_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Where I come from, the DMs call this \"a kick in the\
  \ teeth.\" The tricks the players have learned won't help them here. Each person\
  \ has only the one precious thing they managed to slip in a boot before being captured.\
  \ A cadre of tough henchmen before you, with one card in hand you feel exposed and\
  \ desperate. The sudden transition from the highs of finishing the base set to losing\
  \ nearly everything is a cold-water shock. Starting with only one card in hand makes\
  \ the stakes of every card draw more intense.</p> \n    <p>Suddenly, scavenging\
  \ and cooperation are paramount to the group's survival. Of course, holding this\
  \ tension is nerve-wracking, so, if successful, the characters ramp back up to their\
  \ expected power quickly. If our heroes survive, they'll be all the stronger for\
  \ it and proud of their victory. From high to low and back again. The timing of\
  \ these feelings is something game designers work to create. And if they're really\
  \ good, we experience it as a seamless whole, without ever realizing their intent.\
  \ Mwah ha ha ha!</p> \n    <h2>Events at Board Game Geek Con</h2> \n    <div class=\"\
