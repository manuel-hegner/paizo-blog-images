  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">July 2022 marks the 20th anniversary\
  \ of Paizo as well as the 15th anniversary of the world we now know as the Lost\
  \ Omens campaign setting. In 2007, with the licenses for <em>Dungeon and Dragon</em>\
  \ magazines set to expire, Paizo had to take some big risks to stay in business—\
  risks that ultimately paid off. With a much smaller staff taking a stab at something\
  \ new, Paizo released a series of short standalone adventures telling the tale of\
  \ the rise (and fall) of the kobold king, Merlokrep, in the northern wilderness\
  \ of Andoran. Over three adventures, <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy82r0?GameMastery-Module-D0-Hollows-Last-Hope\"\
  >Hollow’s Last Hope</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ase?Pathfinder-Adventure-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King\"\
  >Crown of the Kobold King</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy85en?Pathfinder-Module-D4-Hungry-Are-the-Dead\"\
  >Hungry Are the Dead</a></em>, authors Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Nicolas Logue,\
  \ and F. Wesley Schneider established the foundations for what would grow into the\
  \ Lost Omens setting we continue to explore and expand today. </p> \n     <p>Paizo’\
  s Director of Game Design, Jason Bulmahn, recounts:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n \
  \     <p>Losing the magazines was a scary time at Paizo. Exciting, but scary. None\
  \ of us really knew how things were going to shake out long-term, but we had a plan\
  \ to carry on making Adventure Paths, something we were known for from the pages\
  \ of <em>Dungeon</em> magazine. The only problem was that we only needed three people\
  \ to make the Adventure Paths happen, and we had six folks on the editorial staff.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>My job back then was to create everything else, from maps and cards\
  \ to standalone adventures. And that is where <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>\
  \ came in. While the Rise of the Runelords was fleshing out Varisia, Mike McArtor,\
  \ Jeremy Walker, and I worked to create Darkmoon Vale, a small wilderness area in\
  \ which to set a couple of standalone adventures to get us started. Although <em>Hollow’\
  s Last Hope</em> was technically first, it was a smaller adventure for Free RPG\
  \ Day, and Crown was set to be our true premier.</p> \n      <p>We were lucky to\
  \ get Nicolas Logue as our author. We were still putting together our styles, but\
  \ Nick’s bombastic encounters made for a fun, exciting dungeon romp. This adventure\
  \ would also serve as the very first step into a much bigger story. Around this\
  \ time, we were picking up the pieces of some of our older products, looking for\
  \ ideas to add to Golarion. One place we searched was the “Compleat Encounter” line\
  \ of products. One of these was the <em>Vault of the Whispering Tyrant</em>, which\
  \ introduced an important character to our world. In these very early days, although\
  \ we knew little else about him, we decided that he was sealed away, kept at bay\
  \ by three seal stones. One such stone was already broken, and its remains were\
  \ under the dungeon of this adventure (you can see a hint for it in area 28, the\
  \ Forsaken Tunnel). </p> \n      <p>Honestly, looking back at this adventure brings\
  \ back memories of a Paizo long past, where we were all just scrappy kids making\
  \ the stories that would come to define a world. I am excited to see this story\
  \ polished up for a new generation of gamers!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>To\
  \ celebrate Paizo’s anniversary and 15 years of the setting we all love, Paizo is\
  \ releasing a hardcover compilation of the Crown of the Kobold King saga, updated\
  \ from its original 3.5e rules (this predates even Pathfinder first edition, after\
  \ all) to Pathfinder Second Edition, and including a whole new chapter by original\
  \ Kobold King scribe Nicolas Logue. The book’s lead developer, Creative Director\
  \ James Jacobs, has the following to say about the process.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>It took over half a decade to do it, but we got there eventually. Originally,\
  \ we planned on doing a compilation of the Kobold King adventures in a big adventure\
  \ to support first-edition Pathfinder at about halfway through that edition’s life\
  \ cycle—that’s when I hired Nick Logue to write the “missing level” after all. But\
  \ then, for various reasons, we didn’t move forward with the project and the final\
  \ level just sat in limbo on my hard drive. Fast forward to 2021, when we were facing\
  \ a lot of challenges with the standalone adventure line’s schedule and availability\
  \ for folks to work on it. With the renewed look and interest on kobolds, it seemed\
  \ like a good time to go back!</p> \n      <p>Combining the adventures together\
  \ into one single adventure presented a few unusual challenges as well, beyond the\
  \ known challenge of converting from 3.5 rules to Pathfinder Second Edition. Most\
  \ significantly, the individual plots for the previously published adventures, which\
  \ were meant to be stand-alone themselves, kind of clashed and didn’t work well\
  \ together. It was sort of like having three different openings to the story. And\
  \ so those plots got minimized, turned into background elements, or got written\
  \ out/replaced entirely, and I focused more on what was itself a “background element”\
  \ of the original adventures—the presence of one of the seals that helped keep the\
  \ Whispering Tyrant imprisoned. At the time of the original publication, that plot\
  \ was very much in the category of “teasing future potential stories” but didn’\
  t have much to do with the main adventures. Today, that plotline is the most important\
  \ one, and so I focused the revision on those events. In doing so, and in bringing\
  \ in the final “lost level” that Nick wrote years ago, a brand new plot came into\
  \ being—one that, for the first time, reveals where the Crown of the Kobold King\
  \ came from, what it was for, and what might happen if King Merlokrep’s plans come\
  \ to fruition!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>A lot has changed in 15 years,\
  \ but at its core, the same exciting adventures that launched Pathfinder are still\
  \ as dangerous and engaging as ever. With fully updated art to reflect our reimagined\
  \ Second Edition kobolds and the brand’s evolving visual style, the 128-page hardcover\
  \ is sure to launch a new generation into an adventure-filled exploration of Golarion,\
  \ or take old veterans back where they first began. Pick your copy up at your local\
  \ game store or bookseller this fall, or preorder on paizo.com today. </p> \n  \
