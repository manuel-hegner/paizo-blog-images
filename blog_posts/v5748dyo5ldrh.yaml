  \ Things About the Refreshed Player Companions</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ August 9, 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <div style=\"float:\

  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Readers with subscriptions to the Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion line have already started getting a glimpse of <a href=\"/products/btpy8tim\"\
  ><i>Varisia: Birthplace of Legends</i></a>, with its refreshed format and philosophies.\
  \ But for everyone still waiting for their hard copies, who haven't checked out\
  \ the Player Companions in the past, or who just want to see a bit of what all the\
  \ hubbub is about, here are ten new awesome things you can expect from Player Companions\
  \ going forward.</span></p> \n    <p><b>Something for YOUR Character!</b> Every\
  \ Player Companion begins with a new \"For Your Character\" introduction, enumerating\
  \ which character classes receive the most focused love, as well as new features\
  \ great for characters of any class! Regardless of the type of character you're\
  \ playing, each Player Companion will always have something for you! </p>\n    <p><b>Questions\
  \ to Ask Your GM!</b> You're not playing Pathfinder by yourself. To make the most\
  \ of the content in every Player Companion, there's a list of questions for players\
  \ to ask their GMs regarding that month's topic. <a href=\"/products/btpy8ruo\"\
  ><i>Player Companion: Knights of the Inner Sea</i></a> is going to have lots of\
  \ players excited to don their shining armor, but if your GM is about to take you\
  \ under the sea, maybe you should put that character concept on hold. Make sure\
  \ you've got the right character for your campaign with just a few simple questions.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Rules Index!</b> Want to cut right to the chase and find the feats,\
  \ traits, archetypes, and other rules elements that your character has to have?\
  \ Flip to the rules index for a comprehensive listing of the crunchiest elements,\
  \ by type and with associated page number. Stop wadding through pages searching\
  \ for that lost trait and get back to playing! </p> \n    <p><b>Did You Know?</b>\
  \ Making the Pathfinder RPG has been a weird and wild ride. Learn behind-the-scenes\
  \ secrets and weird Pathfinder trivia with the quick new \"Did you Know?\" call-outs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Almost a Centerfold!</b> Player Companions are some of the only Pathfinder\
  \ products that lie absolutely flat (there's no gutter between pages for words or\
  \ art to get lost in). This gives us the opportunity to do jaw-dropping, uninterrupted,\
  \ two-page art pieces right in the center of every book. In <i>Varisia: Birthplace\
  \ of Legends</i>, that means a massive player-friendly map of all Varisia (complete\
  \ with routes and travel times to some of the most exciting locations), but down\
  \ the road it'll mean month after month of lavish, artistic depictions of regions,\
  \ topics, and themes central to that month's Player Companion. If you want a lot\
  \ of information without a lot of words, here's the place to look!</p> \n    <p><b>Vistas\
  \ and Double Truck Art!</b> See the Pathfinder Campaign Setting like never before\
  \ with huge, double-page-spanning art pieces. Beyond just the huge piece in the\
  \ center spread, expect to see sweeping views of some of the most exciting lands\
  \ and epic scenes from across Golarion, with art pieces only the format of Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion can provide. Check out just a few of the most awesome vistas\
  \ from <i>Varisia, Birthplace of Legends</i> and next month's <i>Knights of the\
  \ Inner Sea</i>, included here!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ Players Welcome!</b> Weren't here for <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #1</i></a>? Didn't play <a href=\"/products/btpy82r0\"><i>Hollow's\
  \ Last Hope</i></a>? That's just fine, and welcome aboard! Pathfinder Player Companions\
  \ are designed to be entry points for players who know nothing about the subject\
  \ of the month, giving you the backstory on existing topics, overviews of regions\
  \ detailed at length elsewhere, and quick briefs that bring you into the know with\
  \ gamers who have been playing Pathfinder for years!</p> \n    <p><b>The Veteran's\
  \ Arsenal!</b> Player Companions are your new one-stop arsenal for the best gear,\
  \ archetypes, spells, magic items, traits, and other character options related to\
  \ the month's topic. Also, don't worry about just getting rehashes of information\
  \ presented elsewhere—with every overview you can also expect Player Companions\
  \ to drill down deeper into details players need to know on some of the richest\
  \ subjects in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting. Think you knew everything there was\
  \ to know about Varisia? In <i>Varisia, Birthplace of Legends</i>, you'll learn\
  \ all about the territories and totems of Shoanti quahs, the most traveled routes\
  \ of Varisian wanderers, the fastest travel times between major locations, arcane\
  \ schools from across Varisia, freshly updated Varisian equipment, and much, much\
  \ more!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb120\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy8ruo\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9426_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p><b>What You Need—NOW!</b> We know players don't always have the\
  \ time to read an entire book's worth of material to make their character—especially\
  \ when they need that character right away. Player Companions are now built with\
  \ every two-page spread focused on a single topic, giving you everything you need\
  \ to know on the subject at a glance, or allowing you to page quickly past material\
  \ you don't need in search of what you want. These focused sections give players\
  \ in a rush the opportunity to make the right choices for their characters and learn\
  \ about the Pathfinder Campaign Setting without having to read dozens of pages.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Roles!</b> Heard about a great idea from the Pathfinder Campaign Setting,\
  \ but not really sure how to build it? Then you need a role! Roles can be considered\
  \ builds, templates, or kits that give you suggestions on what rules and roleplaying\
  \ themes you should consider if you want to play a character related to some of\
  \ the most exciting cultures and organizations in Golarion—folks like Varisan fortune-tellers,\
  \ Sczarni toughs, and Sable Company marines (to name just a few from <i>Varisia:\
  \ Birthplace of Legends</i>). Roles draw on rules and options from across the whole\
  \ spectrum of Pathfinder RPG products so you don't have to hunt through book after\
  \ book for the perfect feat or that archetype you know you saw somewhere. Additionally,\
  \ roles are as much about how you play your character as what stats go into building\
  \ it, so you'll also find tips on how to roleplay, preferred gear for your character,\
  \ and even considerations on relationships you might want to share with other members\
  \ of your party. At the same time, every role is entirely a suggestion—an idea of\
  \ how we here at Paizo might build a type of character—so if you want to play an\
  \ exception to the rule, well, being exceptional is what being a PC is all about!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Monthly!</b> Player Companions have gone monthly! Now subscribers\
  \ can expect a new host of options for their characters and details on the hottest\
  \ topics in Golarion every single month. (After all, you're a player every month,\
  \ right?) Get all the backup you need—now twice as often! </p> \n    <p><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8tim\"><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Varisia, Birthplace of Legends</i></a>\
  \ is available now, so if you've never taken a look at Pathfinder Player Companions\
  \ before or didn't think they were for your game, now's the perfect time to take\
  \ another look. We've put a lot into refreshing this series, and I think you're\
  \ really going to like what you see. Thanks for checking them out, and be sure to\
  \ tell us what you think!</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\
