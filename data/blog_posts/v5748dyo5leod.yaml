  \ <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 18, 2013</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">There are some big changes in store for\
  \ the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign, beginning in <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/scenarios/season5\"\
  >Season 5â€”the Year of the Demon</a>. We highlighted a few of them in <a href=\"\
  http://youtube.com/watch?v=gmKTE6XGxyc\" target=\"_blank\">a sneak peak on the Know\
  \ Direction podcast</a> last night but we also wanted to make sure those who did\
  \ not listen to it were aware of the changes.</span></p> \n     <h2>Campaign Announcements</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Below are a few of the changes we wanted to bring to light that are\
  \ coming down the pipe in the next few months, culminating at Gen Con in August.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>We are removing two factions from the campaign as character\
  \ choices. The first to be phased out will be the Lantern Lodge faction. When <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8we1\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-21: Way of the Kirin</i></a>\
  \ is released in late May, members of the faction will get to participate first-hand\
  \ in the culmination of their faction's plot. At PaizoCon in early July, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8we3\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-23: Rivalry's End</i></a>\
  \ will similarly conclude the Shadow Lodge faction's involvement at a PC organization\
  \ in the campaign. Members of each retiring faction will receive a special boon\
  \ in their respective retirement scenario exclusive only to members of the affiliated\
  \ faction.<br><br> Members of eliminated factions will be able to join one of the\
  \ eight remaining factions at no cost of Prestige Points, and must do so by August\
  \ 14, 2013. Characters will be able to keep faction-specific traits, boons, vanities,\
  \ and prestige awards received while members of the Lantern Lodge and Shadow Lodge,\
  \ with one exception. The \"no one left behind\" prestige award found in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Field Guide will no longer be available for play.<br><br></li> \n    \
  \  <li>There will be a fundamental change in how faction missions work in scenarios.\
  \ The biggest change is that individual scenarios will no longer provide faction\
  \ mission handouts except in rare circumstances. Scenarios will be written with\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's goals in mind first and foremost, and many will also\
  \ involve the specific interests of one or more, much like <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0h\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-11: The Disappeared</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0j\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-13: Fortress of the Nail</i></a> involved the\
  \ entire society working toward a goal that had special significance to members\
  \ of the Cheliax faction. Choices and successes will matter and we are instituting\
  \ additional reporting conditions that will allow us to help the player base shape\
  \ not only the future direction of the campaign, but also the fundamental beliefs\
  \ and directions of their own factions.<br><br></li> \n      <li>We are reviewing\
  \ a change in wealth earned in scenarios, specifically regarding characters playing\
  \ outside their designated subtier. We have several ideas in mind and are requesting\
  \ feedback from the player base to find the best solution to the problem. We encourage\
  \ anyone interested in participating in this process to visit the paizo.com messageboards\
  \ to add your input to the discussion.<br><br></li> \n      <li>We want to ensure\
  \ the community is aware that we will continue to sanction past Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Paths over the coming months. The next to be released for sanctioned play will\
  \ be the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skulls &amp; Shackles\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, and the current plan is to continue working backward in order\
  \ of release until all APs released under the Pathfinder RPG rules are legal for\
  \ Pathfinder Society credit. In addition, we will continue to sanction future releases\
  \ of APs when we can and when it makes sense for the campaign. We are currently\
  \ reviewing the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> to see if it is possible to sanction an adventure\
  \ path that relies heavily on the use of the new <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8c\"\
  >Mythic rules</a> scheduled to release at Gen Con.<br><br></li> \n      <li>Finally,\
  \ we are revamping the format of the Chronicle sheets awarded for reading novels\
  \ in our Pathfinder Tales fiction line. Instead of providing a distinct Chronicle\
  \ sheet for each individual novel, we will begin releasing Chronicle sheets that\
  \ cover four novels. Each new Chronicle sheet will release with the first novel\
  \ of a four-book series, and contain information on the three novels that will be\
  \ released later in the year. Each novel with have a boon or unique item tied specifically\
  \ to the flavor or location of that novel. A player who brings a copy of a novel\
  \ to a Pathfinder Society game along with the associated Chronicle sheet gains access\
  \ to the novel's boon, and can apply that boon to any of her characters. When a\
  \ GM has initialed all four novels on a single Chronicle sheet, the player can select\
  \ one of the four boon as a permament or reusable boon which she can assign assign\
  \ to one of her characters.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>The first of these new-format\
  \ Chronicle sheets will cover <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1j\"><i>Liar's Blade</i></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc7\"><i>Pirate's Honor</i></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8wbz\"\
  ><i>Wizard's Mask</i></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8j\"><i>King of Chaos</i></a>,\
  \ and should be available in the next few weeks. We'll release a new Chronicle sheet\
  \ shortly after Gen Con to cover the next batch of four novels coming out later\
  \ in 2013 and early 2014.</p> \n     <h2>Gen Con Volunteer Update</h2> \n     <p>Speaking\
  \ of Gen Con, I still have a few volunteer positions left to fill. I have a small\
  \ number of tables remaining that need Pathfinder Society GMs, including one Tier\
  \ 1 GM spot left to fill. So, if you need free crash space at a hotel, a free 4-day\
  \ badge, paizo.com store credit, four free GM-exclusive goblin t-shirts, a copy\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8c\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures</i>\
  \ hardcover</a>, and a special GM boon that alternatively opens the grippli as a\
  \ legal character race or grants you a one-time complete character rebuild, please\
  \ email me. This spot is likely to go fast!</p> \n     <p>Additionally, I have just\
  \ been allocated two additional hotel rooms at the Omni for volunteers interested\
  \ in running <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game</i></a> demos in the Paizo booth during exhibit hall hours. If you are looking\
  \ for a share of a free hotel room, a free 4-day badge, as well as paizo.com store\
  \ credit, your choice of a copy of the Mythic Adventures hardcover or the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game, and four purple volunteer goblin shirts, please email me\
  \ at <a href=\"mailto:mike.brock@paizo.com?subject=Gen Con Volunteer\">mike.brock@paizo.com</a>.\
  \ I have enough room for eight such volunteers for the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game</i>.</p> \n     <p>As always, we look forward to trying to create the best\
  \ organized play experience we can for all of you. Please head over to the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ messageboards</a> and let us know what you think. Thanks again for being the best\
  \ fan base any gaming company could ask for.</p> \n     <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
