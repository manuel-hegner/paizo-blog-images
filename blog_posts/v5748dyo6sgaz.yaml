  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings from Playtest HQ! The time has come\
  \ for us to move on from the River Kingdoms, closing out Part 4 of <em>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</em>. Now we turn our attention north, to a land ruined by demonic powers.\
  \ That's right, we're going to the Worldwound in <em>Part 5, The Heroes of Undarin</em>!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now, I don't want to give away any spoilers, but for those of you who\
  \ are playing, make sure to touch base with your GM, as they have very special instructions\
  \ for you as to how you should make your character for this dangerous mission!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As a reminder to all of you playtesters out there, the surveys for all\
  \ of the previous parts of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> are still open. Once you and your\
  \ group have completed playing <em>Part 5, The Heroes of Undarin</em>, make sure\
  \ to take the following surveys! Your feedback is vital in making sure we get the\
  \ game right for its final release!</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:center;margin:2rem;\"\
  ><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP5PC\" target=\"_blank\">Player\
  \ Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP5GM\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Game Master Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP5OP\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Open Survey</a></p> \n    <p>If you have completed the <em>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</em> surveys, consider giving us your feedback in the general surveys for\
  \ Ancestries, Classes, Rules, and the Bestiary. These surveys can be found on the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest#playtesting\">Pathfinder Playtest landing page</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Update 1.4 - All About Ancestry</h2> \n    <p>The past two weeks have\
  \ been a real whirlwind for us in the design pit. In the two weeks since the release\
  \ of Update 1.3, which brought some pretty big changes to the game, we've been hard\
  \ at work on Update 1.4. While this one is much more modest in terms of scope, it\
  \ nevertheless brings a pretty big change to your game: an overhaul of the ancestries!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The one thing we've heard mentioned over and over (as well as in our\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPAncestry\" target=\"_blank\">Ancestry\
  \ Survey</a>) is that many of you felt like the ancestries weren't quite giving\
  \ enough at 1st level. We also saw a number of responses saying that taking a feat\
  \ to be a half-elf or half-orc was too steep a price to pay. This update makes changes\
  \ to the way that ancestries work, while also giving you some additional high-level\
  \ ancestry feats to use in your game!</p> \n    <p>Starting with this update, when\
  \ you make a character, you select not only an ancestry, but also a heritage from\
  \ within that ancestry. Your heritage gives you additional physical characteristics\
  \ based on your lineage, and your choice of heritage is in addition to the ancestry\
  \ feat that you gain at 1st level. Half-elf and half-orc are now choices within\
  \ the human heritage list, which means that you can play a character from one of\
  \ these heritages, and still take a 1st-level feat from either of your parents as\
  \ well!</p> \n    <p>So go grab Update 1.4! Those new feats might just give your\
  \ characters a shot in the arm for the upcoming challenges they must face in the\
  \ horrible, demon-infested lands to the north!</p> \n    <blockquote>\n     <div\
