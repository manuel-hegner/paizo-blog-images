  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>Misery's Mirror</h1> \n    <p>by Liane Merciel</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Chapter One: A Death in Nisroch</h2> \n    <p>\"I need a favor,\" Ascaros\
  \ whispered, stopping before Isiem's library table.</p> \n    <p>\"Of course you\
  \ do,\" Isiem murmured back, unsurprised. He did not lift his head from the scroll\
  \ he was copying.</p> \n    <p>Once, he and Ascaros had been friends. As children\
  \ in the village of Crosspine, they had been almost brothers. That friendship had\
  \ survived the early years of their tutelage in the Dusk Hall of Pangolais... but\
  \ only the early years. The isolating influence of Zon-Kuthon's faith and the weight\
  \ of their respective sins of survival had pushed them apart. Now, as they neared\
  \ the end of their time as students, that childhood friendship seemed nearly as\
  \ distant as childhood itself.</p> \n    <p>The last time they had spoken seriously,\
  \ almost two years ago, it had been Isiem who asked a favor of Ascaros. His friend\
  \ had refused him then, Isiem reflected. It was tempting to do the same in turn.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But there was real fear in Ascaros's voice, under his Nidalese reserve,\
  \ and Isiem had never been one to abandon his friends—even old friends, even strained\
  \ ones—in times of need.</p> \n    <p>Besides, he was curious. What could be so\
  \ important that it would drive Ascaros to this desperate attempt at reconciliation?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Isiem put his pen aside and looked up. Ascaros was still standing before\
  \ his table, unmoving. His left arm, wrapped from fingers to elbow in white linen,\
  \ rested useless in a sling, as it had for years; his right hand gripped the incense-filled\
  \ Osirian staff he used to mask the odor from that ruined arm. The dim silver magelights\
  \ of the Dusk Hall's library made it difficult to read Ascaros's expression, but\
  \ Isiem would not have expected to see much anyway. No Nidalese worth his name let\
  \ pain show on his face.</p> \n    <p>\"What do you need?\" he asked.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Ascaros ran his good hand through his dark, curly hair. In Crosspine that hair\
  \ had been a rich russet, but years of living under the shadow of Pangolais had\
  \ drained the ruddy warmth from the boy's locks. Now his hair was almost black,\
  \ with only the barest hint of red remaining. Compared to some of the other changes\
  \ the Dusk Hall had wrought in them, Ascaros's hair was a small thing, but Isiem's\
  \ eye was often drawn back to it. They were not who they had been, either of them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Not here,\" Ascaros said after a long hesitation. He glanced down the\
  \ hushed rows of shelves. \"Can we talk in your room?\"</p> \n    <p>\"If you like,\"\
  \ Isiem said. He was due to begin an apprenticeship with a Chelish wizard soon,\
  \ but his new mistress had not yet come to claim him, so he still had student's\
  \ quarters in the Dusk Hall. Although small and spare, they offered more privacy\
  \ than the library did.</p> \n    <p>He stood, closed his scroll case, and led the\
  \ way back to his room.</p> \n    <p>With the door locked behind them, Ascaros relaxed.\
  \ He leaned the silver staff against Isiem's wall and sank into a black iron chair,\
  \ leaning into its spike-filigreed back as if the thorny metal were a silk cushion.\
  \ Eyes closed, he said: \"I'm going to Nisroch.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nisroch?\" Isiem\
  \ echoed. \"Why?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Misanthe. My aunt. The one who served in the Midnight\
  \ Guard. She... died.\" Ascaros rubbed his dead arm through its wrappings. \"I don't\
  \ have many details, but it happened in Nisroch, two days past. The Dusk Hall wants\
  \ me to investigate.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Why you?\" Isiem asked quietly.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Because she was my aunt, I suppose.\" Ascaros shrugged. \"And because I am\
  \ a student here, and they have some measure of control over me. Misanthe had several\
  \ objects of value, and I imagine the Dusk Hall intends to claim them. I am her\
  \ last living relative—or the last with any standing, which amounts to the same—\
  so if I do not object...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Will you object?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Isiem.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Isiem_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> Isiem no longer puts much stock in friendship.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  I don't even know what she had.\" Ascaros pursed his lips unhappily. \"An enchanted\
  \ staff, a silver necklace. I remember a black mirror, too. It might have been a\
  \ nightglass.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, that could cause trouble,\" Isiem murmured.\
  \ Nightglasses were powerful tools, and dangerous ones. An apprentice with a nightglass\
  \ could summon shadowbeasts that would strike fear into a master wizard's heart.\
  \ The Dusk Hall held the largest collection of nightglasses in Nidal, and it coveted\
  \ more. It was not difficult to believe that their superiors would send a student\
  \ to retrieve one—even from that student's dead kin.</p> \n    <p>Whether the Dusk\
  \ Hall had any legitimate claim to the glass almost didn't matter. The Hall wanted\
  \ it. Ascaros would therefore have to retrieve it, or risk facing their masters'\
  \ wrath. After years of seeing the scars that their teachers inflicted for far lesser\
  \ transgressions, Isiem doubted his friend would be eager to disobey.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"When do you leave?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p>Ascaros raised his head and looked\
  \ at him. \"Tomorrow. I am allowed one companion. One of the masters offered, but...\
  \ I would feel better if I had a friend. Will you come?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course,\"\
  \ Isiem said.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p> Black and swollen\
  \ and slow, the Usk River poured from the hinterlands of Nidal into the sea. It\
  \ carried the shadowcallers' vessel from the Uskwood to the coast, and it bore them\
  \ past the massive, rust-streaked Rivergate that filtered incoming traffic. At the\
  \ Rivergate their documents were checked three times, their identities questioned,\
  \ every parcel in their belongings opened and examined—but all of it was done in\
  \ under twenty minutes. Nisroch saw more merchants and travelers than any other\
  \ city in Nidal, and its sternly efficient officials kept its traffic moving.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Isiem's first impression of the city, as their boat passed through the\
  \ rain-swept walls, was of towering gloom. Nisroch was known as the Maw of Shadow,\
  \ and while it did not have Pangolais's black trees to cast its inhabitants into\
  \ an eternal twilight, its dense gray storm clouds had much the same effect. He\
  \ wondered whether the hand of Zon-Kuthon kept those massed clouds hanging over\
  \ the city; surely no natural storm would linger so long.</p> \n    <p>Spires and\
  \ mausoleums crowded the banks of the city's wealthy northern quarters, throwing\
  \ jagged shadows across the river. To the south, the city's laborers and commoners\
  \ lived in smaller homes of basalt and dark wood. Two immense bridges, their wet\
  \ black stone carved into lovingly detailed depictions of tormented petitioners,\
  \ connected the halves of the city. Rainwater cascaded down the bridges' sides in\
  \ shivering cascades, drenching the boats that passed below.</p> \n    <p>High above\
  \ the Nisrochi nobles' silver-edged towers and iron-gated mansions, the Cathedral\
  \ of Bone loomed. Sixty feet high and raised even higher on an artificial hill of\
  \ stepped stone, the cathedral was a gleaming white pearl in a grim black city.\
  \ It was built entirely of human bone—and the building, legend claimed, was never\
  \ done. Squinting through the rain, Isiem thought he could make out a lattice of\
  \ scaffolding clinging to the west side. Somewhere nearby, he knew, Kuthite torturers\
  \ would be stripping more bones from victims' bodies and washing them in acid to\
  \ cleanse them for the faith.</p> \n    <p>\"We'll go there first,\" Ascaros said.\
  \ \"We must report to the Over-Diocesan and be formally welcomed into the city.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And if we don't?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It isn't a choice.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Ascaros's prediction proved correct. No sooner had their boat docked than\
  \ five Nisrochi officials approached them on the pier. Three wore the harbormaster's\
  \ silver pin over their plain black robes. Two wore the spiked chain of Zon-Kuthon.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We welcome you to Nisroch,\" one of the Kuthites said. She was a short,\
  \ round woman, her fingernails gnawed to uneven stubs. Her eyebrows were plucked\
  \ completely bald, an affectation that Isiem had noticed among several of the harbor\
  \ officials as well.</p> \n    <p>The other Kuthite was a man. He seemed younger\
  \ than his companion, or perhaps merely subservient to her. His eyebrows, too, were\
  \ plucked bare, and his head was shaved clean—a look that did not flatter his bumpy\
  \ scalp or pallid gray complexion. Although he was not fat, the skin of his jowls\
  \ hung around his chin in loose, sagging folds. He carried himself hunched inward,\
  \ as if perpetually cringing away from the unseen blows of fate.</p> \n    <p>Isiem\
  \ disliked him instantly. But the shadowcaller kept his manner neutral as he replied:\
  \ \"We are grateful for your welcome.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The Over-Diocesan invites\
  \ you to pay your respects at the Cathedral,\" the woman said.</p> \n    <p>\"We\
  \ are honored to accept,\" Ascaros said.</p> \n    <p>\"I'll have your belongings\
  \ brought up shortly,\" the boat's captain called behind them as his passengers\
  \ departed. Neither the shadowcallers nor the Kuthite clerics acknowledged his words\
  \ as they crossed the rain-slick pier. All knew the captain would have been badly\
  \ beaten if he had failed to observe the proper courtesies. Impoliteness was not\
  \ tolerated in Nidal, least of all impoliteness to one's betters.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ was a thought that loomed large in Isiem's mind as they approached the Cathedral\
  \ of Bone. A single steep, narrow staircase led to the cathedral, slicing through\
  \ the immense stone steps that supported the macabre edifice.</p> \n    <p>Small\
  \ shrines flanked the stairs, each attended by one to three black-clad Kuthite dedicants\
  \ and an equal number of petitioners offering themselves up for a show of piety\
  \ in pain. The oldest of the shrines were built entirely of human bone; the newer\
  \ and poorer ones still had animal bones woven into their walls.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ suffering that took place within those shrines was voluntary—mostly—but the screams\
  \ and whimpers echoed in Isiem's ears as he walked past, keeping his gaze fixed\
  \ on the church's doors so he would not have to see. Iron pincers, liars' masks,\
  \ thumbscrews, salt knives, branding by frost and fire... and those were the tortures\
  \ people chose to undergo. There were worse things in the dungeons under the Dusk\
  \ Hall, and Isiem did not doubt that there were worse yet in the depths of the cathedral.\
  \ The ascent was a pointed reminder of what a breach of etiquette could cost.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It was not the Over-Diocesan who met them at the cathedral's ornate bone\
  \ doors, however, but a younger priestess wrapped in a clanking mantle of chains.\
  \ Deep red scratches covered every inch of her skin except for her face, creating\
  \ the impression of a flayed undead creature wearing a perfect porcelain mask.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You will be Ascaros of the Dusk Hall,\" she said. \"Your companion?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Isiem, also of the Dusk Hall.\" Ascaros inclined his head slightly\
  \ over his folded hands. Beside him, Isiem did the same. \"We thank you for your\
  \ welcome, but we are eager to begin our work.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. Of course.\
  \ The death of Misanthe.\" The cleric raised her bald eyebrows. \"A member of the\
  \ Midnight Guard, was she not? Remind me, please: what is the Dusk Hall's interest\
  \ in that?\"</p> \n    <p>\"She was a Midnight Guard,\" Ascaros said. \"But she\
  \ was also one of our masters. Assignment to the Midnight Guard is temporary; membership\
  \ in the Dusk Hall is not. She had finished her assignment in Cheliax and was on\
  \ her way back to us when she died. And,\" he added, as though it were an afterthought,\
  \ \"she was my aunt.\"</p> \n    <p>The priestess dismissed that bit of information\
  \ with a grunt. \"I suppose the Dusk Hall does have some stake in it, then. Very\
  \ well. She died while clearing the Hovels. The vermin were fighting back this time,\
  \ so we asked if she would assist our own efforts. She kindly agreed to assist us.\
  \ Unfortunately, it seems the vermin had a nastier bite than she realized.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"My aunt was slain by... paupers?\" Ascaros sounded strangled.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Calling them paupers would be kinder than they deserve. They are wretches.\
  \ Human filth. They cling to our city like barnacles to a ship, and like barnacles,\
  \ they must be scraped off.\" The priestess shrugged. \"In any case, you are welcome\
  \ to go to the Hovels if you like, although no guard can be spared for you. You\
  \ may also collect her belongings. They are being held in storage at the cathedral.\
  \ Voraic will show you the way.\" She gestured to the bald, stooped man who had\
  \ accompanied them from the pier. \"There may be more he can tell you. He was her\
  \ apprentice, and the last to see her alive.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Were you,\" Ascaros\
  \ said flatly, turning to the man. By his tone, he liked Voraic even less than Isiem\
  \ did.</p> \n    <p>The bald Kuthite bowed his head. The silver hoops threaded through\
  \ his ears clinked against one another. \"Yes.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How did she die?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Bravely.\" Voraic kept his gaze fixed downward, looking at none\
  \ of them, but Isiem still caught the grimace that wracked the gray man's face as\
  \ he spoke. \"But badly.\" He hesitated. \"I can take you there, if you would like\
  \ to see the place.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Show us,\" Ascaros said.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
