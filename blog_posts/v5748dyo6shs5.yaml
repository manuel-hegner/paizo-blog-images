  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Earlier this year, Digital Dragon Studios unveiled\
  \ the official Pathfinder 2nd Edition Combat Tracker App for everyone to try, and\
  \ we've had a great deal of fun listening to all the ways folks are using it! Thanks\
  \ to your feedback, we’ve made quite a few alterations over the last few months,\
  \ from two new systems to a variety of in-app improvements, and we’re excited to\
  \ share them with you!</p> \n     <p>While the Combat Tracker App is meant to be\
  \ used by your whole party, with each person joining via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and\
  \ thus always remaining on reset, many of our users also operate it solo. This means\
  \ that some GMs are performing the time-consuming tasks of entering each party member\
  \ in every battle. We’ve made some tweaks to make that just a bit easier by allowing\
  \ the GM to save manually entered combatants from one round to the next. This means\
  \ when you hit the reset button, only the non-saved characters are removed from\
  \ combat, leaving the party together for the next encounter and eliminating the\
  \ need to re-enter consistent characters. </p> \n     <p>Other oft-requested features\
  \ have been the bulk adding of combatants and the ability to delete a character\
  \ during battle. We’re happy to report you can now add as many zombies as you like\
  \ to any combat with just one entry, and it auto-populates each of their tabs! If\
  \ you leave the dice setting on random, it even rolls different initiatives for\
  \ them all. Just to make game life a teeny bit better, we also added a long press\
  \ menu for each combatant on the combat screen. Pressing for a few seconds on a\
  \ tab now brings up a menu allowing you to change an initiative, save newfound party\
  \ members, and delete those lost in battle all in one place. </p> \n     <p>Not\
  \ enough? We also found time to adapt two other game systems, creating combat tracking\
  \ apps for the many fans of Pathfinder 1st First Edition and the space-faring Starfinders!\
  \ Whichever game you prefer, we hope you have fun with it, and we can’t wait to\
  \ share our next updates with you. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
