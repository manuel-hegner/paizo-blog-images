  \   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 1, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Ever since we introduced the little buggers\
  \ way back in <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #1</a>, the\
  \ lowly goblin has become a sort of mascot for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\
  \ With several new attributes like hatred of dogs, fear of horses, and a delightful\
  \ penchant for singing (and a fresh new visual design from superstar artist Wayne\
  \ Reynolds), Pathfinder goblins are a great symbol of what we're trying to accomplish\
  \ with Pathfinder in general—providing new and exciting spins on classic elements\
  \ of fantasy and sword &amp; sorcery.</span></p> \n    <p>As far as Pathfinder goes,\
  \ it doesn't get much more classic than goblins. Since their first appearance, we've\
  \ introduced <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfk\">ways to play goblin player characters</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderAccessories/plush\">stuffed goblins</a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ubl\"> goblin t-shirts</a>, and more.</p> \n    <p>We've also produced\
  \ several goblin miniatures for the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> line. All of them have been extremely popular with gamers\
  \ and collectors, and despite most of them being commons, the goblins have been\
  \ the highest-demand figures we've produced to date. And they're not going to last\
  \ forever.</p> \n    <p>Enter the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">Pathfinder Battles\
  \ Builder Series We Be Goblins</a> set, a new product format from WizKids designed\
  \ to help you build your goblin hordes quickly and affordably. Each display box\
  \ contains 24 blind-bagged randomly assorted single-figure packs, each with its\
  \ own goblin miniature. With 12 figures in the set, each display box is designed\
  \ to provide a complete set—and then some! Individual packs retail for $2.49, and\
  \ are scheduled for release on May 29, 2013, just in time for use with our just-announced\
  \ Free RPG Day Pathfinder Module, <a href=\"/products/btpy8wvm\">We Be Goblins,\
  \ Too!</a>, which comes out June 15th as part of the worldwide Free RPG Day promotion.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Additional Builder Series sets are in the planning stages, and we hope\
  \ to have a couple more out by the end of 2013. Folks with a <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles Ongoing Subscription</a> can use their Encounter Pack discount\
  \ codes on display boxes of the We Be Goblins set (they are not part of the automatic\
  \ case subscription, and will need to be ordered separately).</p> \n    <p>The We\
  \ Be Goblins Builder Series set contains five all-new sculpts in addition to repainted\
  \ versions of seven previously released favorites, and I've got to say I think they're\
  \ some of the best goblins we've seen from WizKids yet! I'll reveal two figures\
  \ a week for the next few weeks, starting right now!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ appeared in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> set.\
  \ This warbling warrior doesn't appreciate your cruel words about the ineffectiveness\
  \ of bards, and she's eager to show you the error of your ways with her nasty whip.\
  \ Look out! The Goblin Warchanter has a brand new paint job, and she's looking forward\
  \ to keeping your growing goblin army in line!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130201-Poog_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Last up today we have the almighty Poog of Zarongel, a frightening\
  \ little cleric of the goblin god of dog-killing, fire, and most holy mounted combat.\
  \ Poor Poog is not very good at mounted combat and he has yet to kill his first\
  \ dog, but he's a very, very effective pyromaniac. His boon companion, the frog\
  \ \"Dogfinder,\" rests atop his bald pate. Poog is a player character in both the\
  \ original <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\">We Be Goblins</a> adventure and this year's\
  \ exciting sequel, We Be Goblins, Too!, both written by the demented genius Richard\
  \ Pett.</p> \n    <p>That's it for me this week! I hope you're all enjoying opening\
  \ your new <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> figures, and that you\
  \ enjoy looking at and playing with your new figures as much as we enjoyed making\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, we've approved more than 50 sculpts for upcoming\
  \ releases over the last couple of weeks, and we'll soon move beyond goblins to\
  \ get into some juicy reveals from upcoming full sets!</p> \n    <p>Next week I'm\
  \ out of the office for a much-needed vacation to Hawaii, but I plan to pre-load\
  \ the next couple of preview blogs so you guys can enjoy goblin goodness in my absence.</p>\
