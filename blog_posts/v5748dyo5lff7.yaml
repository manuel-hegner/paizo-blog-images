  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    <p></p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >This week sees the official release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends\
  \ of Golarion</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted\
  \ plastic figures, and I couldn't be more excited. This set is extra special to\
  \ me, because unlike previous sets, it takes its inspiration not from one of our\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a> campaigns,\
  \ but instead from the whole breadth of all Pathfinder releases to date. This set,\
  \ more than any of its predecessors, includes lots of original Pathfinder creatures\
  \ like the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf4k\">Sandpoint Devil</a>, <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf4k\">Seugathi</a>, and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfcr\"\
  >Marsh Giant</a>.</span></p> \n    <p>Due to an ill-timed vacation on my selfish\
  \ behalf, the world was left without a <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> preview last week, and I felt the reverberations and gnashing of teeth\
  \ all the way across the country on the floor of New York Comic Con. So as penance\
  \ for my breach of etiquette, I feel the only remedy is to preview ALL FIFTEEN remaining\
  \ figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>, from the\
  \ lowest mooks to the mightiest demons! </p> \n    <p>We have a ton to cover today,\
  \ so let's get started!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-07.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-07_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Up first we have the Tooth Gang Knifer, a masked street thug\
  \ from the cover of the <a href=\"/products/btpy86j8\">Guide to Absalom</a> sourcebook\
  \ on the city at the center of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting. I've long wanted\
  \ to add some thugs to the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ line, and this guy fit the bill perfectly. He's got a simple, dark paint scheme\
  \ fitting with his common rarity, but also fitting with the fact that the only money\
  \ he has to spend on clothes he intends to steal from the purses of dead player\
  \ characters. The Tooth Gang Knifer is a Medium common figure, and he is not aloneâ€¦\
  </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-08.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-08_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>I like this guy even better. Here we have the Tooth Gang Brute,\
  \ positioned mid-scream with a big old club he plans to use to see what the inside\
  \ of someone's head looks like. He is garbed similarly to his companion in the Tooth\
  \ Gang, and both wear a tooth on a necklace, identifying their allegiance. The Tooth\
  \ Gang Brute is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-09.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-09_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up we have the Akata, inspired by\
  \ the classic <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\">Second Darkness\
  \ Adventure Path</a> adventure <a href=\"/products/btpy85ed\">\"Children of the\
  \ Void,\"</a>wherein threats from outer space make themselves known on the world\
  \ of Golarion. Akatas live on dying planets, asteroids, and even comets, terrorizing\
  \ the galaxy as only blue space lions with two tails can. (They also dwell, of course,\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</a>!)</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-12.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-12_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>And while <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>\
  \ gives us the opportunity to focus on purely Golarion creatures like the Akata\
  \ and certain NPCs, it's also a chance for us to fill out the ranks of common creatures\
  \ and adversaries, and it's difficult to find creatures more common or more adversarial\
  \ than orcs! Here we have a great Orc Archer. The detail on the sculpt is really\
  \ fantastic for a figure at the common rarity, and you can combine your Orc Archers\
  \ with other orcs in this set and those in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</a> to build a huge orc warband! The Orc Archer is a Medium, common\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-13.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-13_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>That orc warband is going to need a lot of rank and file troopers.\
  \ Might I suggest the Orc Soldier? This handsome devil comes complete with his own\
  \ sword and armor. Just provide the player characters and let him do his dirty work.\
  \ The Orc Soldier is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-14.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-14_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Any good orc warband needs to have a lot\
  \ of heart, and the Orc Mystic is only happy to provide, since he happens to be\
  \ holding one in his bloody left hand! Looking at this figure I am again amazed\
  \ at the sculpt quality WizKids is able to work into their common figures. The Mystic's\
  \ screaming face and double-skull staff would look cool on a rare figure. The Orc\
  \ Mystic is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \  <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-22.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-22_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Back to Golarion, for a bit. Here we have\
  \ the Eagle Knight, brave warrior of the goodly kingdom of Andoran, on the Inner\
  \ Sea. Andoran is one of the most popular factions in the 55,000-player <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> campaign, where Eagle\
  \ Knights are a very important player organization. They've also played a role in\
  \ the campaign setting since the very beginning. This female Eagle Knight wields\
  \ a cool greatsword and wears the traditional colors of her order. The Eagle Knight\
  \ is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-23.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-23_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This Eagle Knight Officer makes the perfect\
  \ companion for the Eagle Knight. He has a great mid-swing pose and a cool ponytail.\
  \ The Eagle Knight Officer is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-24.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-24_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>This scummy aquatic humanoid comes from the most prolific and\
  \ successful of the countless races created by ancient aberrations who once ruled\
  \ the world. The Ulat-Kini makes a great stand-in for any sort of subterranean or\
  \ aquatic lurker. The figure has surprising paint gradients and details for its\
  \ rarity, and is one of my favorite \"rank and file\" figures in the set. The Ulat-Kini\
  \ is an uncommon, Medium figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-26.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-26_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This Snow Leopard is a perfect match for\
  \ Droogami, the animal companion of the iconic druid Lini (who also appears in this\
  \ set). It also makes a good generic great cat figure, with or without its gnomish\
  \ partner. The Snow Leopard is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK//WZK71244-8-27.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK//WZK71244-8-27_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Golarion has many heroes, but few have such a strong claim\
  \ to that title as the Knights of Ozem, ancient protectors of Lastwall and outright\
  \ enemies of evil in all its forms. This female Knight of Ozem wears beautiful golden\
  \ full plate and rushes toward enemies with a longsword held aloft and a mighty\
  \ shield ready to defend her from certain doom. With a heroic pose and a paint scheme\
  \ that screams \"I'm a paladin,\" this figure makes a great proxy for a heroic player\
  \ character, as well. The Knight of Ozem is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-32.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-32_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The imposing Calikang comes straight from the pages of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\">Inner Sea World Guide</a>. Legend holds that, an\
  \ untold number of eons ago, one of the thousand deities of distant Vudra failed\
  \ at a task, and the first calikangs were born from that god's severed fingers.\
  \ They have a powerful sense of guilt and shame of their divine source's ancient\
  \ failings, and they believe that if enough calikangs protect worldly holdings from\
  \ robberies or destruction, this inherited sin will someday be wiped clean. That\
  \ makes them awesome treasure guardians, and the fact that they're CR 12 makes them\
  \ awesome enemies for your greedy PCs. The Calikang is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-35a.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-35a_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the croaking Toad Demon, a hideous creature\
  \ that dwells in vast Abyssal swamps and waterways. Toad Demons prefer torture,\
  \ slumber, and other lazy activities, but man, they pack a mean punch in a fight.\
  \ The Toad Demon is a Large, uncommon figure. You'll want to stock up on a few of\
  \ them before playing the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, I imagine.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-36a.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-36a_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Speaking of minis that will be helpful with the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, this unusually colored Serpent Demon\
  \ has six swords of different skymetal to kill you six different ways. She looks\
  \ amazingly cool, and at the uncommon rarity she'll be a great encounter builder\
  \ with other figures from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous Pathfinder Battles</a> set. The Serpent Demon is a Large figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-37a.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-37a_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is probably my favorite figure in the entire\
  \ set. Here we have the mature form of the Death Demon, creatively named the Greater\
  \ Death Demon (you'll have to wait one set to get the junior version). I like pretty\
  \ much everything about this figure, from the cool cross-armed forward-lunging pose\
  \ to the blackfire weapons to the gradient paint job on its fleshy wings. Whatever\
  \ you do, don't let it eat you! The Greater Death Demon is a (sweet-looking) Large,\
  \ uncommon(!) figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-54a.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-54a_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The last figure we'll preview today is the Fire Demon,\
  \ an amazing adversary that dwells on the top of the normal demonic food chain.\
  \ He's got a cool flaming whip sculpted in clear plastic and a neat face that took\
  \ us something like 9 tries to get right. I'm very happy with this figure, and hope\
  \ you will be too! The Fire Demon is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And THAT'S\
  \ IT for the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> set. We've got\
  \ a ton of figures from upcoming sets to preview in future weeks, so be sure to\
  \ come back next Friday for absolutely 100% new figures no one outside the office\
  \ or the factory has ever seen before. </p> \n    <p>Until then, please consider\
  \ setting up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>.\
  \ This option is the best way to make sure you don't miss a single figure, and comes\
  \ with great discounts on Encounter Packs and single figure purchases!</p> \n  \

  >Legends of Golarion Singles</a> we've just put on sale and pick your figures one\
