  artist: "Perdido Street Station, and how he seamlessly blended a mishmash of cultures\
    \ and created a believable and vibrant city. In fact, New Crobuzon served as the\
    \ primary influence for Kaer-Maga, the city I created for the module Seven Swords\
    \ of Sin; it's a city of outcasts that have come together, a place where a lot\
    \ of different cultures all intermingle but still manage to work. Among other\
    \ books, Joel Rosenberg wrote the \"Guardians of the Flame\" series, in which\
    \ the main characters are literally pulled into the game world of the RPG they're\
    \ playing. Those books were my first introduction to the concept of roleplaying,\
    \ and as a result the world created by Rosenberg is pretty much the archetypal\
    \ setting I envision for fantasy roleplaying games. Richard Knaak's \"Dragonrealms\"\
    \ series was also very inspirational for me early on, as The Crystal Dragon was\
    \ the first adult fantasy I picked up (mainly because it had a shiny holographic\
    \ dragon on the cover). More than fantasy, though, I'm primarily influenced by\
    \ science and science fiction—possibly more so than anyone else at the Paizo.\
    \ I think I've learned more about world building"
