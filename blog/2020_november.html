  <h1>Giving Thanks to Our Community</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2020-11-26T17:30:00Z">Nov 26, 2020, 09:30 am</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">Today is Thanksgiving in the United States, and several other countries celebrated their day of giving thanks over the past months. While celebrations look very different for all of us this year, we wanted to take a moment to give thanks to our Paizo community. Without you all, the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder would be just stories we told ourselves. We’re grateful for all your support, and wish you well as this year comes to a close. We also want to thank the Organized Play community organizers for supporting our programs in the face of tremendous adversity.  Without the venture-officers, we would lack structure and without GMs, games. To all of you who spend time planning schedules and completing tasks behind the scenes, a huge shout out of thanks!</p>

            <br clear="all"/>
            
            <p>Every year we have several dozen conventions/events which support charities. We developed the charity boon programs to support these efforts. This year, without physical gatherings, we thought the support for charities would diminish. In light of this year’s adverse conditions, we’re especially thankful for the tremendous generosity of our players. We’d like to recognize a few the events who conducted charitable activities and supported the charities’ good works!</p>
            
            <p><b>Contingency 2020, Hunstanton, England</b><br />
This event in February raised <b>£7500</b>, or <b>$9934</b> USD, for <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/">Alzheimer's Society UK</a>.</p>
            
            <p><b>Owlcon 2020, Houston TX</b><br />
            The Texas Organized Play community ran over 50 tables and raised <b>$260</b> for <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/" target="_blank">Extra Life</a>in February of this year.</p>
            
            <p><b>PFS MANCon, Manchester, England</b><br />
            While this event was cancelled due to the start of the pandemic, many of the attendees donated fees and refunds to the nominated charity. The equivalent of <b>$635</b> USD was donated to the <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s Society</a> to help tackle dementia.</p>
            
            <p><b>CoVcon, Pittsburgh PA</b><br />
            COSCON quickly moved online when lockdown began in March. Through their efforts, they raised <b>$268</b> to support <a href="https://rfk.org/" target="_blank">Royal Family KIDS</a> and the <a href="https://covid19responsefund.org/en/" target="_blank">COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization</a>.</p>
            
            <p><b>CritterCon 3, Online</b><br />
            The <a href="" target="_blank">Cosmic Crittermanders</a> ran their third event to benefit <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a> in April of this year, raising <b>$6741</b> and running 76 tables.<p>
            
            <p><b>PaizoCon Francia, Geneva, Switzerland</b><br />
            One of our few in-person events, this convention raised around 500 Swiss Francs, or <b>$550</b> USD, for <a href="https://www.hospicegeneral.ch/fr/fonds-mimosa" target="_blank">Fonds Mimosa</a>.</p>
            
            <p><b>Displacement Con, Grand Rapids MI</b><br />
            The unofficial replacement for Grand Con, this event featured board games and Adventurer’s League in addition to Paizo Organized Play games. A total of <b>$225</b> was raised for <a href="https://wish.org/michigan" target="_blank">Make-A-Wish of Michigan</a>.</p>
            
            <p><b>Gen Con Online, Indianapolis IN</b><br />
            The charity auction at Gen Con raised <b>$11,008.66</b>, which will be donated to Gen Con Online’s partner charities: <a href="https://www.takethis.org/" target="_blank:">Take This</a>, <a href="https://www.trinityhavenindy.org/" target="_blank">Trinity Haven</a> and <a href="http://www.ineeddiversegames.org/" target="_blank">I Need Diverse Games</a>.</p>
            
            <p><b>Pittsburgh Con Online, Pittsburgh PA</b><br />
			A new event, this online convention raised <b>$188</b> for the <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/" target="_blank">Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank</a>. The local volunteers hope to run the event again next year!</p>

			<p><b>Tavern Con 2020, Ithaca MI</b><br />
			This event raised <b>$460</b> for <a href="https://gamingforacure.org/" target="_blank">Gaming for a Cure</a>.</p>

			<p><b>SkålCon Online 2020, Minneapolis MN</b><br />
			This online convention was attended by several members of the Organized Play team, and it raised <b>$4700</b> for local charity <a href="https://www.tubman.org/" target="_blank">Tubman</a>.</p>
            
            <p><b>Defenders of the Healing Flame, Multiple Lodges</b><br />
			Unable to conduct in-person marathons, 7 lodges teamed up to raise money for <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=52168" target="_blank">Extra Life</a>. Through 55 tables of play, they raised <b>$6,529</b> for Children’s Miracle Network. Thanks to the members of Bluegrass Lodge in Kentucky, Queen City Lodge in Cincinnati, Virginia Lodge, Boston Metro Lodge, Mid-Maryland Lodge, Central Jersey Lodge, North Shore MA Lodge and the NE Indiana Organized Play community for all your efforts!</p>

			<p><b>CONGlomerate, Online</b><br />
			Just this month, the online region raised <b>$1,070</b> for <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/" target="_blank">Extra Life</a> and the <a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Childrens’ Hospital</a>.</p>

			<p>In total, this year our Organized Play community raised more than <b>$42,000</b> for charity. Thank you all so much for your incredible efforts! All charities are linked above, if you would like to support your community’s fundraising or learn about the charities’ goals. Your efforts truly exemplify the “Cooperate” portion of the Pathfinder Society motto, and we can’t wait to see what the community will do in 2021 and beyond.</p>
         
			<p>Check back next week for our Monthly Update! Until then: Explore! Report! Cooperate! </p>

            <p>Our first offering, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026l2?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight"><em>Junker’s Delight</em></a>, is scheduled for July 2021. Written by Starfinder developer Jason Keeley with Misha Bushyager, this 1st-level adventure puts player characters in the role of “junk tourists” on the red planet Akiton, searching for riches in the graveyard of crashed starships just outside the settlement of Khefak Depot. </p>
            
            <p>Another new adventure follows <em>Junker’s Delight</em> in September 2021, so keep your communication channels open to the Paizo blog for further details on this adventure and more to come in the future!</p>
            
            <p>Starting in June 2021, the Starfinder Adventure Path will be returning to a bimonthly schedule with <em>Planetfall</em>, the first volume of the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path. The Adventure Path will otherwise remain unchanged, featuring the same multi-part campaigns and articles full of new setting material, new player options, and new alien creatures that you’re used to. There’s just so much fun adventure content heading your way that we want to make sure people have the time to play them all!</p>

        <h3 style="color:DarkOrange">Abandoned Shack — Moderate 1</h3>
        
        <p>This encounter takes place in or near an isolated shack by a weathered monument toppled long ago. A necromancer alchemist animated the bodies of four hapless goblins, stuffing their stomachs with alchemical supplies that detonate when they’re destroyed. The goblins are lurking in the shack to exterminate trespassers, or perhaps to protect some clue or treasure.</p>

        <p><b>Creatures</b>: The four goblin zombies moan and lurch out of the shack whenever a living creature approaches. They spread out and attack whichever foes are closest, fighting until destroyed in an alchemical explosion.</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Nov 29, 1:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>We know that a lot of our customers use these new-fangled flat computers with pens, or portable computers with keyboards, and that their characters have adventures to chronicle (beyond finding outlets or spilling their mead into the keyboard). </p>
 
        <p>So select the $25 dollar Electronic Tier! Then, when the kickstarter is complete, you can select one of the unlocked character classes! </p>
 
        <p>Or, even better, select the Electronic Party Pack at $90, and select 4 of the unlocked classes when the Kickstarter is complete.</p>
 
        <p>So onwards then! Let's get that next Character Class unlocked!</p>

            <h3>What is Hell’s Rebels?</h3>
            
            <p>Hell’s Rebels is a six part adventure path that takes players into the tumultuous city of Kintargo, where someone needs to take a stand against an unjust government. Given the current state of affairs, we thought that everyone could use a little escapism into a world where a few courageous heroes change the fate of the world for the better. The tone of this story is triumphant and cheerful, in stark contrast to our Patreon-exclusive Tyrant’s Grasp podcast which serves up bi-weekly survival horror.</p>
            
            <p>To quote from the back of the adventure: </p>
            <blockquote>
            	<p>The city of Kintargo has a new lord-mayor, but he's not someone interested in maintaining that city's free spirit. Paracount Barzillai Thrune has placed the city under martial law, and his cruel proclamations and sinister plans for the city bode ill. Can a small group of heroes and would-be rebels stand against the might of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus and save their home town from being crushed under the boot of an infernal tyrant? Will one of Cheliax's most powerful inquisitors make the city his playground, or can the rebels known as the Silver Ravens rise up to bring a new era of freedom to the so-called Silver City of Kintargo? Join the rebellion! Save Kintargo! DOWN WITH THRUNE!</p></blockquote>
                
            <p>Rick Sandidge has converted <em>Hell’s Rebels</em> from Pathfinder First Edition to Second Edition, and will be gamemastering this audio adventure. He even converted the original campaign traits to Second Edition backgrounds for the players to use. Rick has many years of experience GMing, and will continue the tradition of masterful storytelling on the Find the Path. While the podcast will be free for everyone to listen to, Rick’s conversion notes and other goodies will be available to Patreon supporters. More details to come!</p>
            
            <h3>Who is playing in <em>Hell’s Rebels?</em></h3>
            
            <p>We will have five players on the show: Heather Allen, Jessica Peters, Jordan Jenkins, Rachel Sandidge, and Ross Scoggin. No surprises here. We’ve kept the same personalities and chemistry that we’re known for and haven’t added any new cast members.</p>

            <p>Heather is playing Cesare Nightbloom, an ex-Asmodean elven wizard with an adorable black cat familiar and a real arcane bent. </p>

            <p>Jessica is playing Adria Sylla, a half-elven artisan Storm Order druid with a sordid past and an empty nest.</p>

            <p>Jordan is playing Lucia Sarini, a human child of Kintargo swashbuckler with a flair for the theatrical!</p>

            <p>Rachel is playing Vittoria Scordado, a half-elven urban sleuth investigator with an eye for details and a drive to do good. </p>

            <p>Ross is playing Niccolo Aita, a tiefling (human) natural born leader rogue with a penchant for union organization.</p>

			<h3>Who is Find the Path Ventures?</em></h3>
            
            <p>Comprised of a group of longtime friends, Find the Path produces content that invites gamers and non-gamers alike into the world of the Pathfinder RPG system. Known for their strong grasp of the Pathfinder rules system and genuine, cooperative table dynamics, Find the Path tells engaging and exciting stories full of diverse, multifaceted characters and epic fantasy adventure. Their deep understanding and respect for real-world history and culture truly brings the Age of Lost Omens to life for listeners, and their ability to seamlessly weave explanations of the rules into the story is a great way for those who want to play Pathfinder to get an introduction to the system. Along with high quality audio and a respectful attitude toward each other and listeners, Find the Path is building a vibrant, positive community.</p>
            
            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
            
            <p>The first three episodes of Hell’s Rebels will release January 6th, 2021 at 12:00am CST on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and many other podcatchers. Listeners can then expect a new episode every other Wednesday. Supporters on Patreon (<a href="https://patreon.com/findthepath" target="_blank">https://patreon.com/findthepath</a>) will have access to Rick’s conversion notes as well as other goodies.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">As promised in our <A href="https://paizo.com/blog/november-update-conventions-sanctioning-stars-novas-and-more">monthly update blog</a>, we’ve been working hard on sanctioning playable content for Pathfinder Society (second edition). Today, we’re pleased to announce that the adventure “Menace Under Otari,” part of the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox"><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a>, awards credit for Pathfinder Society characters!</p>
            
            <p>We’ve sanctioned the adventure in campaign mode as a two-chronicle adventure. The story lends itself nicely to splitting into two parts, each of which we believe should be playable in 4-5 hours. Players should either use one of the provided pregenerated characters or build their own using the Beginner Box rules. Each chronicle must be applied to a 1st-level character and grants 4 XP, 10 Treasure Bundles, and 4 Reputation for their chosen faction. We’ve also designated the adventure <b>repeatable</b>, so players earn credit each time they play through the adventure.</p>
            
            <p>The Beginner Box is designed for new players. To encourage GMs and experienced players to use it as an onboarding tool for new players, we decided to award <b>double AcP</b> for sessions run as part of the Pathfinder Society. This means players earn 8 points and GMs earn 16 points, plus any adjustments for premiere and premier plus events, allowing everyone to purchase new boons faster!</p>
            
            <center><p><b><A href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Beginner+Box+Sanctioning.pdf">Download the sanctioning document and chronicle sheet here!</a></b></p></center>
            
            <p>As noted above, the <em>Beginner Box</em> is the perfect introduction into the world of Pathfinder.  From there, we’ve put together a series of next steps leading adventurers to a career in the Pathfinder Society. First up, we recommend the upcoming Bounty titled <em>The Road from Otari</em>, scheduled to debut in January. The story builds on Menace Under Otari, leading your first-level characters from Otari to Absalom, where you arrive at the Grand Lodge to begin your career as a Pathfinder! From there, we recommend <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation"><em>PFS 1-01: The Absalom Initiation</em></a>, where new characters can meet the various important Society NPCs, and the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dg?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-212-The-Pathfinder-Trials"><em>PFS 2-11: The Pathfinder Trials</em></a>, which gives a peek into how the Society trains its initiates. Post-training, a good start to the Year of Corruption’s Reach, this year’s metaplot, is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024wy?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-201-Citadel-of-Corruption"><em>PFS 2-01: Citadel of Corruption</em></a>, or characters can dive into being Pathfinders via any other Pathfinder Society adventure!</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, we don’t have any sanctioning this month for either Starfinder Society or Pathfinder Society (first edition). Next up on our sanctioning docket is <em>The Slithering</em> for Pathfinder (second edition), the Devastation Ark Adventure Path and <em>Alien Archive 4</em> for Starfinder, and the remaining Pathfinder (first edition) content as time permits. Keep an eye on the monthly update blogs. We’ll keep you posted on our progress as we have news to share.</p>

            
            <p>Until next time: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

		<p itemprop="description">Adventurers don’t spend every waking moment in moldering crypts or dangerous fens. When heroes need a break, they can take some downtime in a friendly town like Otari! The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults">Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a> provides new downtime options for characters who have befriended some of the town’s notable characters. Here are some downtime activities the heroes can take at Otari’s largest temple, the Dawnflower Library.</p>
        
        <p>The Dawnflower Library is constructed on a shelf of land west of town so that its dome and minarets gleam in the rays of the rising sun. Although principally a temple to the sun goddess Sarenrae, the building also holds shrines to Cayden Cailean (drunken god of heroes), Erastil (god of hunting and community), and Gozreh (deity of the wind and sea). Yet most of the building’s interior is dedicated to the stacks; the Dawnflower Library holds an incredible number of books, and its knowledge is open to all. </p>
        
        
            
           <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b6d1a391-fd45-4543-9a74-1a944f579228/111820_VANDY-BANDERDASH.png"><img width=300 src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b6d1a391-fd45-4543-9a74-1a944f579228/111820_VANDY-BANDERDASH.png" hspace="5" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="A blonde-haired halfling woman wearing a holy symbol of Sarenrae"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Vandy Banderdash by Nikolai Ostertag</p>
        
           <p>A chatty halfling woman named Vandy Banderdash is the temple’s current high priestess. She is welcoming and kindly, with an uncanny ability to recommend the best possible book to someone she’s only just met. Anyone who befriends Vandy can engage in the following downtime activities in the Dawnflower Library.</p>
           
           <p><b>Exemplary Resources</b>: The reference materials in the Dawnflower Library are superb. Heroes can use a scholarly-focused lore skill such as Academia Lore, Legal Lore, or Library Lore to Earn Income (<em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook 236</em>) with a +1 circumstance bonus to the skill check. The first time a hero critically fails at such a check, Vandy gives them a stern lecture about taking better care of the library’s resources. The hero isn’t prohibited from Earning Income here again, but doesn’t gain the circumstance bonus any longer, as the acolytes are more judicious about which texts the hero is permitted to access.</p>
           
             <br clear="all">
             
             <p><b>Reshelving</b>: Vandy wants the Dawnflower Library’s collection to be as useful to the community as possible, so she’s always looking at ways to rearrange or cross-reference the library books. A hero who takes a day of downtime to help rearrange the collection gains a 10% reduction in the price of the next spellcasting service purchased from Vandy or her acolytes (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 294; 3rd level or lower divine spells).</p>
             
             <p><b>Tend to the Injured</b>: The Dawnflower Library is the first place many in Otari think of when they need medical care, due to the number of clerics working there. Yet not all injuries require divine magic to repair. The hero can use the Medicine skill to Earn Income at the Dawnflower Library. On a critical failure, the hero injures someone placed in their care, which might have roleplaying repercussions at the GM’s option.</p>
             
             <p>For more adventures in Otari, be sure to pick up your copy of the Pathfinder Beginner Box, the follow-up adventure, Troubles in Otari, and the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. You can also get a new chapter of The Shroud of Four Silences novella by Liane Merciel, set in Otari, emailed to you each week by signing up for our mailing list in your paizo.com account preferences!</p>

        <p itemprop="description">Hello to everyone in the Paizoverse, Steve here from Hideous Laughter Productions and today I’m thrilled to help announce that Paizo and our network have signed a licensing deal to help us grow our shows and continue sharing our adventures across the globe!</p>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b477c7aa-be13-4ad7-a2fd-87030224f8e0/111720_FullPodImage.jpg"><img  src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b477c7aa-be13-4ad7-a2fd-87030224f8e0/111720_FullPodImage.jpg" width="80%" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="The team behind Hideous laughter productions standing for a group photo holding a sign with their skull shaped logo in the center"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
        
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>For those of you who don’t know us, Hideous Laughter Productions is a Columbus, OH based podcast network. Our flagship show is the Hideous Laughter Podcast where four of my best friends and I get to disconnect from the real world every week and tell the story of adventurers unwrapping a mystery and stirring up some scares in Paizo’s gothic horror Pathfinder 1E adventure path Carrion Crown. Our “brand” per se is that we want every listener to feel like they’re at the table with us and invoke the feeling of gaming together with your friends on a Friday night. What does that mean? For us, the atmosphere around the table is just as important as the rules or setting on the table! Over the last few years of turning our adventures into a podcast, we’ve laughed, cheered, and cried together as our characters and story grew beyond what any of us ever expected. We pride ourselves in bringing our all every week and delivering a show with top-notch audio quality and storytelling!</p>
        
        <h3>Why Pathfinder?</h3>
        <p>At any given time, between the Pathfinder Tales novels, the core rulebooks, and lore supplements, there are easily 4+ Paizo publications on my bedside table in some stage of being read through, and I know my enthusiasm for the system is not unique among my fellow players at Hideous Laughter Productions! From the mysterious depths of Golarion, to distant space far beyond the Pact Worlds, and everywhere in between, I (and the rest of my fellow HLP gamers) love exploring the universe Paizo has created and crafting stories in it! Our group has gamed together long before the show and has played through several adventure paths across both the Pathfinder and Starfinder systems. We’re absolute nerds for the game mechanics and lore, so when we decided to start a podcast two years ago the Pathfinder system was a no brainer!</p>
        
        <h3>What Else? Beyond Carrion Crown!</h3>
        <p>Though our podcast network debuted with our flagship Carrion Crown show, quickly we began to realize that we had an appetite for more! Releasing the regular show was great, but what else could we do? What other stories could we tell?</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Zone of Truth</b> - Along with the main show, our main podcast feed also hosts the Zone of Truth, a biweekly podcast where Griffin (our GM for Carrion Crown) and myself host a conversational and interview-style show where we discuss what’s happening behind the screens from a GM and player perspective, review new and upcoming Paizo and Pathfinder related products, deep dive into some of the juiciest Pathfinder lore, and interview exciting content creators in the TTRPG space!</li>
        	<li><b>HLP Evil Interlude</b> – Also on the main feed and a prequel-companion show to Hideous Laughter Productions’ flagship Carrion Crown adventure run, the HLP Evil Interlude stars four evil “heroes” setting the stage for some of the biggest moments in Carrion Crown! Homebrewed and run by GM Griffin, this show is a must-listen for fans of deep Pathfinder lore and folks who enjoy listening to something different from an Adventure Path. And what can I say, sometimes it just feels good to be bad!</li>
        	<li><b>Linked Legacy</b> - This anthology series departs from HLP tradition, putting different members of the HLP into the GM seat to tell new stories set against the backdrop of classic pathfinder modules. Available to all subscribers to the HLP Patreon at the $5 tier or above, the Linked Legacy podcast is sure to surprise and delight new and longtime listeners of the show alike!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>So, What Now?</h3>
        <p>With the partnership between Paizo and Hideous Laughter Productions made official, adventures truly await, and Hideous Laughter Productions is looking forward to doing bigger and better things than ever before! I sincerely hope you check us out and fall in love with our characters and story just as much as we have. Below I’ve hyperlinked our link tree site and from there you can find us on all your favorite social media sites, our website, Patreon, and many of the world’s biggest podcast platforms. To all the horror buffs and more traditional fantasy roleplaying fans out there, to all the number crunchers and RP enthusiasts, we’ve got something for everyone in our show and I look forward to sharing our stories with you and interacting with you all online! See you there!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Nov 22, 1:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Marcus Farabellus strides into the common room, looks around at the handful of agents lounging on the benches, then points his finger at several individuals in quick succession. “Belker, Nepsin, Hoger, Klar, Tennit, Greensward.” Grab your kits and head to Valsin’s office. He’s got a task for you over at the Blakros Museum. Farabellus gives them a friendly smile and nods, then turns sharply on his heel and leaves the room, ignoring the uproar his announcement generates.</p>
            
            <p>The six quickly stand and gather their gear, chattering over each other in tense excitement.</p>
            
            <p>“Abadar save us, not the Blakros Museum again!” exclaims Nathaniel Tennit. Wonder what it is this time?”</p>
            
            <p>“Did you hear about the monkey infestation a few years back?” asks Asha Belkar. “Or the haunts around the mysterious orrery in the attics?”</p>
            
            <p>“Well you know they traffic in all sorts of unsavory practices. Like sacrificing their own daughters to extraplanar beings,” Zander Hoger makes a grimace of disgust. “Makes one want to burn the place down.”</p>
            
            <p>“You wouldn’t be the first one to try, Xander,” Murphis Klar replies. “Both Medda and Tavvar Hamavsi let eldritch energies loose that could have destroyed the entire structure, or worse, the entire Wise Quarter. We don’t need to give the Peacebuilders any more ammunition against the Society.” Murphis slams their fist on the table in emphasis.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, you know Nigel was an agent years ago. I heard he had some sort of mutual assistance agreement with a prior venture-captain, maybe even the Decemvirate. Important enough to send agents to one of Hestia Blakros’ daughters’ wedding. Sema Greensward sighs. “Now that’s a mission I’d enjoy going on. Think of the food!”</p>
 
            <p>Quenila Nepsin shoulders her pack. “Personally, I’d prefer to be up at Iceferry Lodge right now--I hear Venture-Captain Torrsen and some Frostfurs found a pass into Irrisen, and I’d take the icy frontier over the museum any day. But we better go! Valsin doesn’t appreciate lollygaggers. If we don’t get to his office pronto, he may just assign us sewer duty.”</p>
 
            <p>Groaning at the thought of delving into the subterranean depths of Absalom’s sewers, the group grabs their gear and leaves the room. The remaining agents look at each other, relief at not being chosen the foremost emotion in the room.</p>
 
            <p>“Guess no one told them about the break-in at the museum a few weeks ago,” mutters one of the agents left behind.</p>

          <p>We’ve got a fresh batch of scenarios this month! First, there’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0251q?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-207-The-Blakros-Deception"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario 2-07: The Blakros Deception</em></a>, a level 5–8 adventure by Charlie Brooks. The storied Blakros Museum has seen more than its fair share of misfortune over the years, and this scenario will give players a chance to investigate the institution for themselves. Meanwhile, it’s starting to get cold here in the Seattle area, but certainly not as chilly as in Irrisen, where Mikhail Rekun takes us for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0251r?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-208-A-Frosty-Mug"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario 2-08: A Frosty Mug</em></a>. This level 5–8 adventure sees the PCs making their way into the Land of Eternal Winter, with directions to chart the pass and the lands beyond, encountering winter, magic, and inhabitants from a strange, faraway world. </p>

            <p itemprop="description">“You have sixty seconds to eject your stolen cargo before my gunners blast you out of the sky,” Brigadier Tassada Kor barks into the comms, watching the battle from her position on the bridge. The decorated vesk officer commands  the dreadnought <em>Talon’s Razor, crewed by</em> 435 stalwart souls loyal to the Veskarium, and she did not tolerate pirates in her corner of space. The targets of her ire, three smaller ships darting and wheeling in the viewport in front of her, spit lasers as they arced close before speeding out of range of her vessel’s firing arcs. The <em>Razor’s</em> hull shakes violently, sparks raining into the black as enemy weapons slam into the shields. Tenacious opponents, Tassada admired them for it, but their insolence must end. When Tassada directed her crew to the outskirts of Veskarium space to investigate reports of piracy, she unintentionally kicked a hornets’ nest of smugglers and their mercenary escorts. The vessels in her crosshairs now were the last of the ragtag armada challenging the <em>Talon’s Razor</em>.</p>
            
            <p>Tassada grins, feeling the thrum of the gatling cannons firing as her gunners retaliated. A spray of cartridges slams into one of the enemy ships and it explodes into bits of metal. Tassada wheels her mobility chair forward to better focus her cybernetic eye on the wreckage. Aided by her augmentation’s magnification capabilities, she quickly pinpoints a cluster of escape pods and a polycarbonate cube stamped with the Veskarium’s official seal.  </p>
            
            <p>“That’s one way to take back our cargo,” Tassada tells her crew, not bothering to switch channels, wanting the remaining smugglers to hear. “Engineering, report.”</p>
            
            <p>“Our super orbital particle cannon is back online.” A male voice replies. Tassada grips the doshko holstered to her chair in anticipation.</p>
            
            <p>“What are you waiting for?” She yells at the gunners. “Fire at will!” A blast of blazing white light envelops the viewport, searing the image of disintegrating spacecraft onto Tassada’s retina. </p>
            
            <center><hr width="50%"></center>
            
            <p>“My crew easily overpowered the pirates near sector 5 and are detaining survivors. Unfortunately, we were not able to recover all the stolen goods,” Tassada explains. She taps a claw against the datapad, sending the report off to her superiors. Needing a place to dock the heavily damaged dreadnought for repairs, she heads to Spaceport 5.1. Encountering an electrical storm on the approach means grounding the <em>Talon’s Razor</em> for some time, though being this close to the satellite grants Infosphere access, and she decides to be prudent and file her report while her crew lands the craft.</p>
            
            <p>Tassada frowns at an incoming transmission signal from her datapad. “Brigadier Kor, this is Command 5. We received reports of a squad of pahtra insurrectionists absconding with a cache of experimental weapons. They are suspected to be in this sector now. Track them down and make sure the weapons don’t make it into the hands of the rebels on Vesk-6.”</p>
            
            <p>The brigadier growls at the thought of rebels stealing Veskarium property while she idles in the spaceport. She scrolls through the station’s secure feeds while composing an acceptable response to her superior. She stops at a docking request from a Starfinder vessel. Scanning the associated records, Tassada discovers the Starfinders docked at Spaceport 5.1 four days ago and just completed repairs to their own ship. A working ship and a capable crew were all she needed. </p>
            
            <p> “It’s not over yet.” Tassada mutters as she heads to the Starfinder ship. </p>

           <h2>Morlibint, Small-Town Bookseller</h2>
           
           <p>Odd Stories is one of Otari’s most distinctive shops: a three-story stone tower looming over a one-story wooden bookstore. The shop is the home and business of the wizard Morlibint, a scholar who enjoys talking about magical theory only slightly less than thrilling fiction. Imagination, he insists, is the most wondrous magic of all. Morlibint is a middle-aged man with short, red hair and a perpetual scowl that quickly transforms into a smile when he identifies a fellow bibliophile. </p>
           
           <p>Odd Stories is an excellent place for anyone seeking gripping novels, clever anthologies, or useful textbooks, and Morlibint is a valuable contact for any party. He’s happy to exchange spells with another wizard, sell arcane scrolls to adventurers, or buy rare tomes that heroes come across in their travels. He never accompanies adventurers on their quests, however, instead finding excitement in treasured books from the safety of his favorite fireside armchair.</p>

		<h3>Plot Hooks</h3>
        
        <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating the bookseller Morlibint into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p>
		<ul>
        <li>Morlibint’s rarest almanac has been stolen and he hires the heroes to discover who took it and why. </li>
        <li>The heroes consult Morlibint to learn more about a creature’s peculiar ability or resistance. Morlibint searches through fictional accounts of the creature to find the answer, which might not be entirely accurate.</li>
        <li>Morlibint has learned the location of a particularly valuable tome and offers the heroes both the opportunity to retrieve it (he only wants to copy a few pages from it) and hints about the curse the tome reputedly imparts on those who carry it.</li>
        </ul>

After a string of seemingly unrelated crimes is revealed as part of a much larger criminal plot, the members of one select squad find themselves at the center of things and must put their badges on the line to prevent the city from falling into chaos. By the end of this six-part monthly Adventure Path, there's just one group that can lay down the law and save Absalom: the Agents of Edgewatch</p>

        <h3>Prison Breakers</h3>
        <p>The Edgewatch agents have been disgraced and the primarch thrown behind bars! In this, their darkest of hours, the heroes must delve into Absalom’s criminal underbelly in order to reach the light. After earning the favor of one of Absalom’s most notorious crime lords, they infiltrate the Black Whale, Absalom’s infamous floating prison, to rescue the primarch and clear their names. The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues with “Belly of the Black Whale,” a complete adventure for 15th- to 18th-level characters.</p>

        <p>As we went through all the feedback on the original Beginner Box, it became clear that some players wanted a way to continue their Beginner Box adventures, so this new version allows the campaign to continue with a follow-up adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari"><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a> (Available Dec. 6th, 2020), which advances characters to level 5, all using the Beginner Box rules.

Many thanks to those of you from paizo.com and other fan communities who helped find potential errata. While there’s a variety of small improvements, here’s a list of five of the changes that appear in the errata that had the most scope. Some of these were also present in the first set of errata:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>All classes increase their unarmed attack proficiency along with their weapons.</li>
		<li>Alchemists gain a scaling item DC without taking a feat and can make more of their field specialty items at 1st level, instead of 5th. They all gain medium armor proficiency in addition to unarmored and light armor.</li>
		<li>We simplified how you carry items into held, worn, and stowed items, making it easier to determine where you can find each of your items without needing to go nitty gritty and buy every bandolier, pouch, and pocket to contain them.</li>
		<li>We lowered the Bulk of several items and separated out the alchemist’s kit, which is for travel, from the alchemist’s lab, which is very heavy. These changes make it easier to carry your important tools on the go.</li>
		<li>We clarified Sustained spells to make it clear whether you could Sustain them multiple times in the same turn and get a benefit.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-cg.jpg"><img  src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-cg.jpg" width="80%" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt=""></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
        
        <p>We hope these errata make the game even easier and more fun to play and run. Thanks to all the editors and playtesters for the <em>Core Rulebook</em> for helping us put out a product with relatively few errors despite how massive it is. While of course, no book is ever perfect and more errata may come down the line, we’re expecting that there won’t be any future updates of this size.</p>

        <p>Oozes have been a staple of adventurers' bad dreams for decades of this game now, and tales of the "the room with the ooze" from any given dungeon are fairly common on the messageboards. However, a module that features ooze as part of its central plot can be difficult to find--for good reason--which is why this adventure and the myriad oozes within it deserve the highest level of appreciation we can give them. Throughout this adventure, any player whose character is hit by an ooze during combat must stick their hand into a five-gallon bucket of disgusting slime, and retrieve a die at the bottom of the bucket for each hit they received. We told you we push the envelope!  </p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Module</b>: The Slithering</li>
        	<li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 61 hours</li>
        	<li><b>Session Hours</b>: 29hrs, 40min</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/db8dcb70-db4c-4964-bcf9-a58fd50552c7/110620_MarketOozeShotBlack2.jpg"><img width=45% src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/db8dcb70-db4c-4964-bcf9-a58fd50552c7/110620_MarketOozeShotBlack2.jpg" alt="A model of a town marketplace, The players' figures suround and defend the market from a large Ooze"></a>

       <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
        
        <p>The Order has between ten and fifteen active members at any given time, and each roster is unique to each project. The team for The Slithering Salve is our most diverse and perhaps most challenging, in that we have ages ranging from forty-seven to fourteen, and experience varying from veterans with over thirty years to even a complete newcomer to the game. We also have a friend and patron along for this project: Karee Vogrin of <a href="https://criticalhitcookies.com/" target="_blank">Critical Hit Cookies</a>, with hair dyed green to match Lini! Finally, with such a diverse array of locals across the city of Kibwe, our GM tapped two additional members of the Order for live-NPC roles throughout our journey.</p>
        
        <h3>Highlights From <em>The Slithering</em>:</h3>
        
        <ul>
			<li>Are your veterans too familiar with the various kinds of oozes in Pathfinder? Perhaps you're worried about them metagaming which types of damage to apply? Enter the fuming sludge, a new ooze that put three of our characters on the ground and slithered over their precious hero points with its ability to prevent the curing of persistent bleed. Oh, you're going to do the run-away-and-shoot routine? Hope you can duck ejected globs of sludge!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Oozes aren't the only thing we fought in <em>The Slithering</em>. Inside one of the oldest buildings in Kibwe, Jirelle opened a door and peered through the torchlight. Staring back at her--six times before help got there--were a pair of basilisks. Six successful saving throws made, never tell a swashbuckler the odds!</li>
            <br>
            
            <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/307edf54-0b8f-4054-a348-3507f91e8c1c/110620_LizardShotBlack.jpg"><img width=45% src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/307edf54-0b8f-4054-a348-3507f91e8c1c/110620_LizardShotBlack.jpg" alt="A mini figure large lizard-like creature stands over our players' figures, standing out ominously in the torchlight"></a>
        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/68fb21d0-5812-4b84-ac69-9955f48ad123/110620_BoggardsShot.jpg"><img width=45% src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/68fb21d0-5812-4b84-ac69-9955f48ad123/110620_BoggardsShot.jpg" alt="Player mini figures in the dark, surrounded by a hoard of boggard figures"></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
        
            <li>We decided to employ the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024tn?Pathfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck">Critical Hit Deck</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024ud?Pathfinder-Critical-Fumble-Deck">Critical Fumble Deck</a>, with deadly variants applied to both, causing a card to be drawn on any crits/fumbles (not just natural 20s or 1s). In total, we saw twenty-seven critical hits and sixteen fumbles throughout the first half of the adventure. This resulted in some raucous combats, like the one where Zithembe the catfolk fighter threw his greataxe (not by choice), drew his greatclub, and proceeded to break it--in the same round!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Playing iconic characters has moments when a player gets to add to the lore of the iconic. While lifting up a map inside a caravan house belonging to the Aspis Consortium, Korakai discovered a <em>feather token (fan)</em>, just like the one his <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9p?Meet-The-Iconics-Korakai">grandfather used to dance with</a>. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Kibwe was reason enough to play this adventure. The soundtrack to <em>Tsotsi</em> accompanied us as we explored nearly every block of the ten distinct districts of the city and met its inhabitants. As one of the adventure's more memorable encounters, we had to persevere in a heated debate in front of a large crowd (complete with module-specific debate system) about the contributions of non-humans and the value of diversity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Salve:</h3>
        
        <p>We weren't sure how we were going to feel playing an adventure about an out-of-control curse, spreading throughout the population of Kibwe with the backdrop of 2020 all around us. This being OAD though, we weren't going to shy away from any adventure that provides something new for us, and we were willing to make heavy sacrifices to have such a unique experience. We spent the weekend contact-tracing in Kibwe, discovering as much as we could about how the curse was spreading and even daring to visit the quarantined victims--eventually coming to the understanding that our own characters might now be vectors. The group agreed that as an out-of-game experience we found it cathartic, even a somewhat surprising outlet for expression during this challenging time. There was a great sense of hope that our characters could do what we at the table could not. By the end of the weekend, we came to feel as if the "Salve" in our project's title has several meanings, one of which applies to the players.</p>

		<h3>Character Deaths:</h3>
        
        <p>None! Our characters were built solid and in good hands with the expertise of OAD Player Captain, Matt Hardin</p>
        
        <h3>Best Quote From Marathon 1:</h3>
        
        <p>(with the party facing two large ochre jellies)</p>
        
        <p>Lini: "Well, let's see what works!" (casts <em>electric arc</em>, two jellies become four jellies)<br />
Droogami: "Grrrrrr..." (bites, and four jellies now become five)<br />
Korakai: "Caw!" (wields electricity, five jellies become six)<br />
Zithembe: "Rraaawwwrrr!" (attacks with greataxe, six jellies become seven) <br />
Jirelle: "This sounds like a good time to get out of Kibwe, honestly."</p>

		<h3>Current Situation:</h3>
        
        <p>We managed to discern the origin of the curse affecting Kibwe; unfortunately, the remedy appears to be one of the ancient pillar-watchers of the city, known as Cursebreaker. After chasing down clues, we must venture 140 miles deeper into Mwangi, to a place called Holy Xatramba. Little is known of the ruined city, both in-game and from Paizo's published material on it. There are demons within, we do know that...</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Nov 15, 1:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>OPM Musings</h2>
            <p itemprop="description">We’ve kinda slowed down a bit on the convention front, with PAX Online being our last big show of 2020, but that doesn’t mean the program slowed down.  On the editorial side of the team, we have earlier than last Wed of the month release dates for Nov and Dec scenarios to avoid releasing items on American Thanksgiving or Christmas/Kwanzaa. We also hope to have space to allow our team to take some time off over the holidays.</p>
            
            <p>In this downtime between active conventions, we also do quite a bit of our planning for the upcoming years. Look for more information in blogs after the first of the year.  We also use the time to complete outstanding tasks, like mailing charity boons and producing goblin songs. Finally, we like to take this time to get 2021 conventions spun up and the background items put into place.</p>
            <br clear="all"/>
            
            <p>To that end, we’re currently in talks with volunteers at the Organized Play Foundation about the makeup of our 2021 convention teams.  With the uncertainty of in-person shows as well as digital platform use for conventions, we’ve got to shake up how we are doing things, including revamping the Department Head structure, looking to have a hybrid digital-physical committee, and streamlining volunteer registration processes. As these changes deal with volunteers, the specifics will appear on the <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/convention-volunteer-registration/" taret="_blank">Organized Play Foundation website</a>. As soon as the information is posted, we will bump this blog. Expect this to happen in the next week or so. </p>
            
            <h2>Fame Conversion Status</h2>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, we did not quite make our October goals.  We did get every boon into the system, but we did not publish the conversion guide out to our community. With the accelerated production schedule of Nov and Dec, to get products out before the holidays, we just could not put one more thing into our schedule. We still have this on our radar and hope to have more information out to you, but we don’t want to prioritize it over getting out the monthly scenarios. We will keep you updated via blogs on where we are and what our new timeline is expected to be. We are also adjusting schedules so that a delay on our end doesn’t remove integration time from the community. Thank you for your patience.</p>
            
            <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
            
            <p>A new batch of sanctioning was <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shft?Sanctioning-Update-Adventure-Paths">posted last week</a>! This included the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse"><em>Extinction Curse</em> Adventure Path</a> for Pathfinder Society (second edition), as well as the remainder of <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy"><em>The Threefold Conspiracy</em></a> AP for Starfinder Society. If you’re new and want to know more about what sanctioning is and why we do it, there’s some good information in that blog as well, check it out!</p>
            
            <p>Next in the queue for sanctioning is the Pathfinder (second edition) Beginner Box, which we do hope to have sanctioned before the end of the month. After that, we’ll take a look at <em>Devastation Ark, The Slithering</em>, and the remaining PF1 Adventure Paths to determine what’s next on our priority list</p>
            
            
            <h2>Stars/Novas/Glyphs</h2>
            
            <p>This month, we had time to review all outstanding four-star and four-nova GMs. Now that the system is more automated, we are able to keep closer track of those GMs on the road to the top. We believe that we have contacted every GM on that list to let them know what’s left to become a five-star or five-nova GM. If you were not contacted and feel you should have been, please email us at organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com and we’ll check it out.</p>
            
            <p>As a result of this process, we discovered several GMs who had completed all their requirements. They are recognized below; congratulations, and thank you for all the time you have devoted to Organized Play!</p>
            
            <p>Congratulations to:</p>

       <p itemprop="description">Hey, Pathfinder fans! It’s Mark Moreland, your friendly neighborhood Director of Brand Strategy, with a bit of exciting news about web fiction over the next few months. Today, to celebrate the release of the second-edition <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> next week, we’re launching the first chapter of a serialized novella by fan-favorite author, Liane Merciel (<em>Nightglass, Nightblade, Hellknight</em>).</p>
       
       <p><em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em> takes place in the town of Otari, pictured here, which serves as the setting for not only the Beginner Box, but also the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023dy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari"><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a> adventure and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults">Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a>. Like new players taking their first steps into the game and world of Pathfinder with the Beginner Box and our other Otari content, the heroes of this tale are new to adventuring, but quickly find themselves embroiled in a plot that could threaten the entire town.</p>
       
       <p>This return to long-form Pathfinder fiction also gave us another opportunity to try something new, so after this week, you won’t see the remaining chapters of <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em> here on the Paizo Blog. Instead, you can get each week’s chapter emailed directly to you by ensuring you have opted in to receive “Products, Offers, News, and Events” emails in your <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/account/settings/privacy">account privacy settings</a>. We’ll still have Otari-related blogs coming out on Wednesdays for the duration of <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>’s release, but they’ll be encounters, No-Prep Characters, and other content you can use at your table. If they happen to also be relevant to the current chapter of Eleukas, Wendlyn, and their companions’ story, I’m sure that will be entirely accidental.</p>
       
       <p>So without further ado, I present to you: <em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em>.</p>

        <center><p>Chapter 1</p></center>
        <center><h3>WORK DETAIL</h3></center>
        
        <p>Come on,” Eleukas coaxed. “Just one more load and you’re done.”</p>
        
        <p>“’One more load,’ he says,” Wendlyn muttered, flexing her scratched and sawdust-smeared shoulders. “’One more.’ My arms are about to fall off, and he wants me to cheer up because there’s ‘just one more load.’”</p>
        
        <p>“You were the one who opted for a work detail over a night in the cells.” Otari’s lumber companies gave away their split, hollowed, and beetle-weakened discards for firewood, provided people used their own carts to haul the loads away. Wood splitting was one of Captain Longsaddle’s favorite punishment details, since the Otari Garrison was in perpetual need of firewood, and whatever they didn’t use could be given to townspeople too ill or infirm to chop their own. The need never ended, which meant the work never ended.</p>
        
        <p>“Well, <em>obviously</em> A night in the cells is a night in the cells. Rats, damp, terrible food. Whereas with this, I’m out in the fresh air and sunshine, plus you end up doing all the work.” Wendlyn dragged another hollow log over to Eleukas’s stump and dropped it.</p>
        
        <p>“You could always stop stealing things,” Eleukas pointed out, heaving the log into position and hefting his hatchet. A maul would have been more efficient, but efficiency wasn’t the point of punishment details. “What’d you get this time? A handful of coins from some drunk sailor? Was it really worth it?”</p>
        
        <p>It was the closest he’d ever come to openly chastising his friend for her unending larceny, and Eleukas held his breath for a beat, afraid he’d pushed their friendship too far. To fill the silence, he began hacking at the log, splitting it neatly with a few sharp blows.</p>
        
        <p>But Wendlyn just shrugged and went back to the reject heap for another log. “When else do I get to see my oldest friend? Seems like these work details are our only chance to catch up.”</p>
        
        <p>That stung. Eleukas contented himself with splintering the new log as he tried to think of a response. It was true that since he’d joined the Otari Guard, he hadn’t had much time to sit around in taverns with his friends, even though—or maybe because—he was only a raw recruit and felt so far behind in his training. There was always some new technique to learn, or another bit of wisdom to pry from some grizzled veteran, and he was so full of questions about his new life that sometimes he forgot to keep up with the old one.</p>
        
        <p>It really was only on these work details, when Eleukas contrived to get himself assigned to guard duty after Wendlyn’s latest arrest, that he saw her anymore. And it was true that he volunteered to do most of the work, partly because he felt so guilty about letting their friendship lapse, even though she was the one who was supposed to be improving her character through labor.</p>
        
        <p>“Maybe I could—” he began, but Wendlyn cut him off with a sudden, intent look at the tree line beyond the lumber yard.</p>
        
        <p>“Did you hear that?” She rose up on her toes, leaning toward the forest like a hound casting for scent.</p>
        
        <p>Eleukas mopped his brow, pushing sweat-soaked black curls aside. He hadn’t heard anything over the thunk and thud of splitting wood, but her half-elven ears had always been better than his.</p>
        <p>“No,” he started to say, cautiously, when a scream split the sap-scented air.</p>
        
        <p>It was a howl of raw rage, and although Eleukas couldn’t have said whether it was made by person or beast, he knew it was a battle cry.</p>
        
        <p>“Come on.” Wendlyn was already running toward the trees. “Bring your axe.”</p>

        <p>Eleukas didn’t waste any more time with questions. Otari was a close-knit town, where you helped your neighbors if they needed it, and the forest could be dangerous. Kobolds, wild animals, worse. There were even rumors of saboteurs targeting the log flume that was Otari’s economic lifeblood, and though Eleukas didn’t like to credit such tales, that cry <em>had</em> come from the direction of the flume.</p>
        
        <p>Gripping the sweaty hatchet, he ran after her.</p>
        
        <p>Branches whipped Eleukas’s face and undergrowth snarled at his feet as he charged through the wood, trying to keep Wendlyn in view. The half-elf darted through the trees as easily as a shuttle through thread, and if it hadn’t been for the bright blaze of her red ponytail waving through the greenery, he’d have lost her. Wendlyn never remembered to wait for anyone slower than she was.</p>
        
        <p>Ahead, the clattering bulk of Giant’s Wheel loomed over the treetops, creaking and grinding and throwing a rhythmic rain up to the sky as it harnessed the Osprey River’s power to carry logs down to the sea. Its immense clacking rush drowned out anything as small as a human voice, but Eleukas didn’t need to listen for screams anymore. He could see the person who’d made them.</p>
        
        <p>No, not person. Corpse.</p>
        
        <p>Even as he crashed through the forest’s edge and heaved for breath in the clearing beyond, Eleukas registered the unnatural angle of the neck, the blood that drenched the clothes, the terrible gaping wounds in throat and torso. He’d never actually seen a person murdered before, but he knew immediately that it was too late to save this man. And he knew it would be scorched onto his memory forever: a thing he had trained for, a thing he had expected, and a thing for which he could never have been prepared.</p>
        
        <p>The fight wasn’t over, even if its first victim was dead. Two patchy-furred rats, each the size of a large dog, were menacing Wendlyn with loud hisses and bared fangs. The bright afternoon sun didn’t cow them, and neither did the darting thrusts of her short sword. The rodents worked with uncanny coordination, one feinting at Wendlyn to draw her attention while the other lunged in to bite.</p>
        
        <p>Eleukas had never seen Wendlyn fight before, and was surprised by how deftly she handled her blade. He’d always assumed she just carried it as an affectation, but it was clear she’d had some real training. She was holding her own against the rats. One was bleeding from its jaw, and the other bore a deep cut along its ribs, although they’d torn their share of ugly scratches across Wendlyn in return.</p>
        
        <p>“I’m here!” Eleukas shouted, hoping to distract them. One of the rats turned on him, snarling. He swung at it but missed. The rat snapped at him, sharp teeth grazing the hair on his forearm. Its spittle flecked him like warm rain.</p>
        
        <p>Adjusting his footing, Eleukas tried again. This time he read the animal’s momentum and chopped low in the other direction, misjudging the aim a little—the hatchet was designed for splitting firewood, and was considerably shorter and smaller than the battle axe he normally used—but catching the rat hard in the forequarters all the same.</p>
        
        <p>Bones crunched, and the rat fell squealing. Yet the other one, to Eleukas’s astonishment, didn’t run. Its greasy brown fur puffed up higher, its spine arched stiffer, and its hisses grew louder. Despite the posturing, it seemed oddly reluctant to commit, hopping back and forth just out of reach instead of coming at either of them.</p>
        
        <p>A second later, Eleukas realized why. It wasn’t alone. Something stirred in the underbrush, creeping toward them as the rat spat and snarled in distraction.</p>
        
        <p>“You take the rodent,” Eleukas said, standing back-to-back with Wendlyn so he could focus on the new threat.</p>
        
        <p>It was hard to pick out from the leaves. He glimpsed a gaunt, clawed black hand, its skin hard and glossy as polished leather, its nails curved into sharp talons. The body was a shapeless mass of damp fur or filthy rags, blending into the brush so that Eleukas couldn’t guess its size. And the face—</p>
        
        <p>When he saw its face, he froze. There was no face. From the stump of its neck rose a vortex of shadow, sucking inward to an infinitude of nothing.</p>
        
        <p>The emptiness at the core of that non-face dragged Eleukas’s consciousness into its chilling depths. He felt, in some place beyond rational thought, that if he let it pull him in, he would be torn apart and devoured so completely that nothing of his mind or soul or awareness could remain.</p>
        
        <p>Terror closed cold around his heart. Fear swallowed every shred of reason in his mind. And then, just as Eleukas braced himself to try, somehow, to pull away from the deadly grip of the whirlpooling dark, a plume of soft black powder blew up from the depths of that devouring emptiness into his face.</p>
        
        <p>Blindness seized him. He couldn’t see, couldn’t breathe. A thick warm wall choked the air away from his gasping mouth. Eleukas tried to scream, but that heavy, blanketing warmth buried the cry in his throat.</p>
        
        <p>He fell, suffocating, into oblivion</p>

<div class="blurb180" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/Blog/102920_SFSocietyPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/102920_SFSocietyPreview_500.jpeg"></a></div>
			<blockquote>

            
            <p itemprop="description">With the release of the Precog Playtest, the Starfinder Society Organized Play Program is also opening its doors to a limited form of playtest, specifically for the Precog class. Since this class won't be for some time, we're looking at allowing players the chance to test out this new during the playtest period.</p>
            
            <p><b>Playtest Period</b>: The availability for these rules runs from the publishing of this post until the end of the playtest period (December 25, 2020.) Once this period has expired, players can no longer use the Precog Playtest class until its publication in a future Starfinder product.</p>
            
            <p><b>How It Works</b>: We're opening up Society play for the playtest class via the use of custom created characters that operate much like our pregenerated characters. We believe this should encourage players to test the waters with custom builds, be it with current scenarios or through our growing stable of repeatable options.</p>
            
            <p><b>Creating a Playtest Character</b>: Prior to playing a scenario in the playtest period, a player can determine if they want to playtest the new class. Depending on the tier of the scenario, the player can then use a 1st-, 4th- or 8th-level character using the Precog class presented in the Playtest and created using the following guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Class</b>: The character must have all levels in the Precog class. Although multiclassing ramifications are important for the playtest as a whole, we're keeping to single classes in the organized play portion of the playtest for simplicity.</li>
                <li><b>1st Level</b>: The character can be created using the character creation rules presented in the <em>Starfinder Core RulebookM</em> and <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em>.</li>
                <li><b>4th Level</b>: This character follows the same rules as above, except it can select one 4th level armor or weapon and one 3rd level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 4,000 credits on other available equipment.</li>
                <li><b>8th Level</b>: This character follows the same rules as above, except it can select one 8th level armor or weapon and one 7th level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 18,000 credits on other available equipment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Credit</b>: The credit earned for playing a playtest character follows the same rules and guidelines as presented on page 7 of the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em>. This means that you must choose which of your characters will receive the credit at the beginning of the adventure. Credit must be assigned to characters of lower level than the playtest character.</p>
            
            <p><b>Resolving Conditions</b>: We recognize that players taking the opportunity to playtest these characters are performing a service for the game and campaign. As a result, whenever a player playtests a 4th- or 8th-level version of these characters, the cost to purchase a <em>raise dead</em> is reduced to 6 Fame and subsequent restorations to remove the negative levels are only 1 Fame each. This means that there's still some risk to your established characters, but the penalty for dying as a playtest character is far less onerous than it would be for a normal character or pregenerated character.</p>
            
            <p><b>Applying Credit</b>: As we want to encourage extra play of the higher-level versions of the Precog, we're also going to open up the rules for applying credit when playing a playtest character. A player using a non-1st-level playtest character may choose to apply the earned Chronicle Sheet to an existing Organized Play character. To do so, simply replace the credits earned on the Chronicle Sheet with credits from the list below that match the level range of the existing player character.</p>
            <ul>
			<li>Levels 1-2: 720 credits (2,160 credits for Adventure Path module)</li>
			<li>Levels 3-4: 1,460 credits (4,380 credits for Adventure Path module)</li>
			<li>Levels 5-6: 4,085 credits (12,255 credits for Adventure Path module)</li>
			<li>Levels 7-8: 5,835 credits (17,505 credits for Adventure Path module)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>With all this in mind, we encourage our players to take an active part in the playtest, both by sharing your opinions online in the Playtest forums and by completing the playtest surveys. We hope that by opening up the means in which players can create and customize characters for the playtest, that we can see some unique and fun builds using this new class and that such tests will provide the design team with priceless "field agent" feedback!</p>
            
            <p>I look forward to hearing from each of you about your experiences with the Precog class and am even more excited to see this class join the roster of Starfinder classes sometime in the future!</p>

      <p>This playtest is your chance to get a look at an early version of this new class and have a hand in its development before it hits shelves in an upcoming book!</p>
      
      <h3>Playtesting the Precog</h3>
      <p>The precog playtest launches on <b>November 16, 2020</b>, and runs through <b>December 25, 2020</b>. So how can you help playtest this new class? First, you’ll want to download the free PDF of the playtest from <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">starfinderplaytest.com</a> (available starting on November 16th). Then you can create a brand new precog of any level using the new rules. We're most interested in feedback from actual play, so it's best if you can get some friends together and play a few sessions using your new character. If possible, make up characters at different levels to get a sense of how they work at different points in their career. There's no accompanying playtest adventure—you can use the new class in existing adventures like Starfinder Society scenarios or Starfinder Adventure Paths, or even mock combats that you create yourself using the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook’s</em> encounter-creation rules. It might be helpful to take some notes during play, so you can remember your thoughts on the experience after the game session. To gather the most useful data for this playtest, we ask that you avoid using house rules and play these characters using only published rules from the Starfinder RPG.</p>
        
        <br clear="all">
        
        <h3>Playtesting in the Starfinder Society</h3>
        <p>Players participating in Starfinder Society Organized Play can also join in the worldwide playtest to test the precog class. From November 16th until the playtest's completion, players can create custom precog characters of levels 1, 4 and 8. These custom characters use many of the same rules as pregenerated characters, though the Organized Play team has slightly relaxed the rules in order to encourage playtesting these new classes. For more information, check out this afternoon's blog about using the precog in Starfinder Society.</p>
        
        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <p>Our primary means of collecting feedback for the playtest is through a survey that we would like everyone participating in the playtest to complete. A link to the survey will be available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">playtest page</a> starting on November 16th. Please make sure you've filled out your survey by <b>December 25,2020</b>.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to responding via the official survey, you can engage with other players and designers on the playtest forum—a link will appear on <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">starfinderplaytest.com</a>—to discuss the precog and possibilities for the future. While we want to focus on actual-play feedback, we're interested in hearing all of your ideas about the class.</p>
        
        <p>What are your thoughts about the playtest? Are you excited? Do you have any questions about the playtest process? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

  <h1>Secrets of Magic Playtest Aftermath</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2020-11-02T22:30:00Z">Nov 2, 2020, 02:30 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">Hi, folks! Logan here. We’ve had some time to look over the survey results and messageboard posts after the <em>Secrets of Magic</em> playtest concluded, and had team discussions about potential changes ahead. Thanks to everyone who participated in the playtest, playing characters, finding problems, taking surveys, and giving feedback! We wanted to give you a bit of an idea of the direction we’re looking at taking the magus and summoner for the final book. Not everything here is set in stone, though. We still have rewrites to do, more internal conversations to have, and additional data to look at. There are also hundreds of little things we’ll be changing, from individual feats to story elements—this blog is just hitting the main points. And, hey, if you stick around to the end of the blog, we have an extra treat for you!</p>

		<p itemprop="description">Hi, folks! Logan here. We’ve had some time to look over the survey results and messageboard posts after the <em>Secrets of Magic</em> playtest concluded, and had team discussions about potential changes ahead. Thanks to everyone who participated in the playtest, playing characters, finding problems, taking surveys, and giving feedback! We wanted to give you a bit of an idea of the direction we’re looking at taking the magus and summoner for the final book. Not everything here is set in stone, though. We still have rewrites to do, more internal conversations to have, and additional data to look at. There are also hundreds of little things we’ll be changing, from individual feats to story elements—this blog is just hitting the main points. And, hey, if you stick around to the end of the blog, we have an extra treat for you!</p>

He wears ornate robes and carries a sword in one hand. Magical fire dances in his other hand."></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Seltyiel, the iconic magus, sketch by Wayne Reynolds</p>
            
         <h2>Magus</h2>
         
         <p>Much of the feedback on the magus indicated that it felt too restrictive and too random. The class could be quite powerful, but required really specific play patterns and choices to get there. We don’t want a class that can do a huge nova attack if you stack your <em>true strikes</em> correctly but isn’t satisfying for doing much else. Our focus for further magus development will be adding more varied strategies, making the action economy less difficult to deal with, and giving more clear paths to build toward what you want your magus to do.
         
         <p><b>Striking Spell</b>: This ability, unsurprisingly, was the focus of much of the conversation from the playtest. In surveys, it was rated as being interesting, but not powerful enough. It was also rated as being difficult to understand. Players noted that it could be frustrating to spend your whole turn casting a Striking Spell spell, then miss with the Strike. Even having more chances at it didn’t take out the sting of needing to wait for another turn to try again. Often, even if the spell came off later, the magus had missed enough opportunities that it didn’t seem worth it.</p>

        <br clear="all">
        
        <p>Making changes to Striking Spell won’t be straightforward, and we still need to do a lot of experiments to find something that’s fully satisfying. One of the major drivers for the playtest version was making it highly flexible to allow for using a wide variety of spells (compared to, say, Eldritch Shot) and let you use your stored spell with other abilities (like Flurry of Blows or Power Attack). Ultimately, these came at the expense of having a straightforward, solid special ability that was dependable. And it also meant that many paths to doing cool things required multiclassing, which leaves the class itself feeling lackluster.</p>
        
        <p>We know for sure that we want to restructure the action to make its presentation clearer. We’re also going away from using a special benefit that relies on a critical hit, as that led to the ability feeling too random and giving too strong an incentive to load up on <em>true strike</em> and put all your eggs in one basket. For actual effects of the ability, there are a lot of options on the table, such as having a stored spell with a spell attack roll not increase your multiple attack penalty, or going a bit farther and using the same roll for your Strike and spell (similar to Eldritch Shot), or having some type of buff you gain while you have a stored spell so you don’t necessarily want to use it right away. Some changes might require Striking Spell to no longer be at-will, so using it is a more impactful moment rather than repetitive. Lowering its frequency, of course, requires some other tools to give your other turns that magus flavor. We’re still workshopping ideas on that front.</p>
        
        <p><b>Spells</b>: The spell progression for magus has a total of four slots maximum. We knew the spell progression would also be a major topic of discussion. Players were pretty divided among which path to take, with about 40% of survey respondents happy with the playtest path, and a wide variety of opinions about alternatives with no clear victor. One of the common notes we saw was that the four slots didn’t allow for many interesting or fun utility spells, but that the Martial Caster feat brought some back in. To that end, we’re looking at adding a class feature similar to Martial Casting around 7th level. That will link to our next topic...</p>
        
        <p><b>Magus Synthesis</b>: Much of the discussion about the magus suggested slide casting felt like a mandatory pick. In the surveys, while slide casting was chosen the most, the selections were much more varied than we expected. And beyond that, shooting star had the best numbers on the “fun scale.” With the intention to make the action economy of Striking Spell more player-friendly, we also want to make the synthesis options more distinctly focused on certain playstyles rather than one appearing like a mandatory choice for action economy purposes. There will likely be more syntheses coming, too, as we add options for the final book. </p>
        
        <p>We intend to give more of a story hook to syntheses, since they’re currently a bit dry compared to similar options in other classes. These will likely also come with some extra benefits that give a bit of a leg up to certain playstyles, such as adding more spells to your spellbook or influencing what you get from the Martial Caster benefit, as noted above. We’re also planning to change the name to avoid confusion with the summoner, who has had a synthesis option since 1st Edition. Finally, we heard you when you said Raise a Tome doesn’t work with the syntheses, and will be fixing that.</p>
        
        <p><b>Spell Proficiency</b>: This part is pretty straightforward. It was noted that the magus has a slower spell attack roll and spell DC progression than the champion or monk can get with their focus spells. The magus will be getting a faster progression.</p>
        
        <p>Battle Spells</b>: The magus potency spell wasn’t that popular. People have been asking for a special attack spell as a focus spell instead, particularly a 1-action spell. We had avoided that for two reasons: first, if the spell is strong, fights can end up really repetitive, and second, we had intended for cantrip choice and their use to be an important part of playing a magus. Cantrips ended up not feeling like a good enough value to be worth using with Striking Spell, though. The battle spell will be changing from magus potency, but the specifics aren’t settled yet. It might be an attack spell with a Striking Spell benefit; it might be based on your synthesis if those would benefit from being differentiated in this way—this depends a lot on how the rest of the class shakes out and we won’t have a clear answer for a while yet.</p>
        
        <p>And now I’ll turn this over to Mark to talk about the summoner!</p>

           <h2>Summoner</h2>
           
           <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the summoner class. First of all, thanks to everyone who participated in the summoner playtest, running games, posting playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and more! The summoner class had quite a bit of online interaction this time around, and there were a lot of interesting and cogent discussions with many good points made by folks with differing opinions. </p>
           
           <p>Overall people really liked the summoner, with the second highest overall approval after the swashbuckler, but there were also some pitfalls, from small to moderate, that people were looking to see fixed, and they all interact in different ways, which makes it a little harder than for the magus to go into great detail on what changes will happen. Finding a fix for a new issue might require revisiting our decision for one we had an idea of how to solve.</p>
           
             <br clear="all">
             
             <p><b>Main Takeaways</b>: Some outcomes are clear. We’re strongly leaning toward changing Act Together to a variable-action activity, allowing either the summoner or eidolon to use a 1-, 2-, or 3-action activity and the other to use a single action. The summoner will be getting proficiency increases to spell attack roll and spell DC sooner, just like the magus. We also want to allow more customization of your eidolon at 1st level without loading up too many choices to make, so we’re leaning towards more evolutions being available at 1st level and giving you a free evolution to choose from at 1st level. We’re also looking into a few other avenues to potentially increase versatility—but there’s an upper limit on how complex the class can be, so there’s likely to be a process where we add and subtract things until we’re satisfied. As such, I don’t want to get too specific in case it changes.</p>
             
             <p><b>Eidolon Types</b>: We plan to increase from the four eidolon types presented here to between eight and 10 eidolon types in the final version. Expect them to be chosen from among the ranks of the eidolon types mentioned, but not presented, in the playtest, such as fey and demon eidolons.</p>
             
             <p><b>Spellcasting</b>: One issue that had a lot of discussion was how to handle spellcasting, whether to keep it the same, remove spell slots for other options like eidolon abilities or focus spells, increase spell slots and weaken the eidolon’s offense, or take a different approach. Based on the plurality of responses in favor of keeping the spellcasting the way it currently works, we are leaning towards that option. We’ve seen some positive playtest results with regards to diverse spell selection and usage.</p>
             
             <p><b>Synthesis</b>: There was a lot of feedback on the Synthesis feat that allowed you to merge with your eidolon; it was popular but many folks said that being an option you choose each time you Manifest rather than mandatory didn’t fulfill the fantasy and that the ability to use both options caused it to have quite a few restrictions it might not need otherwise. Right now we are leaning towards changing the feat’s name and flavor to be clear that it is meant for an optional ability, and then make the synthesist a class archetype in a later book, with trade-offs based around having only the option to merge with the eidolon, not to Manifest it normally.</p>
             
             <h2>Incarnate Spell Preview</h2>
             <p>That’s a lot to read, so let’s finish things off with a preview of a new type of “mega summoning” wherein you summon a powerful thematic creature that sticks around briefly and has a big impact! This is still early in the process, so any elements of this, including names, might still change. And because this is just a preview, don’t go trying to use this in Pathfinder Society! Though if I were your home GM and you gave me some cookies, I’d allow it, personally.</p>
             
             <h3>Incarnate Trait</h3>
             <p>A spell with the incarnate trait operates as follows, rather than conjuring a minion with the summoned trait and allowing you to direct its actions. When summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action. At the end of your next turn, the summoned creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. Then the spell ends.</p>
             
             <p>An incarnate spell directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible. The incarnate spell’s effect is not quite a creature. It can’t take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but does not block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.</p>
           
           <h4>Summon Vengeful Dead — Spell 7</h4>
           <p><b>Incarnate, Necromancy</b></p>
           <p><b>Traditions</b> divine, occult<br />
           <b>Cast</b> [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal<br />
           <b>Range</b> 100 feet<br />
           <b>Duration</b> until the end of your next turn<br />
           You channel the forces of undeath to briefly call forth an amalgam of the vengeful dead slain by your enemies and allies alike. This amalgam manifests as a large tornado of insubstantial, howling faces. It occupies the space of a Huge creature and has a Speed of 60 feet.</p>
           
           <p><b>Arrive</b> (negative) All enemy creatures within a 60-foot emanation must attempt Fortitude saves.</p>
           <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  			<li><b>Critical Success</b> The creature is unaffected</li>
  			<li><b>Success</b> The creature is drained 1.</li>
  			<li><b>Failure</b> The creature is drained 2.</li>
            <li><b>Critical</b> Failure The creature is drained 3.</li>
			</ul>  
            
            <p><b>Depart</b> (emotion, fear, mental) The vengeful dead lets out an anguished scream. All your enemies within a 100-foot emanation must attempt Will saves.</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  			<li><b>Critical Success</b> The creature is unaffected.</li>
            <li><b>Success</b> The creature is frightened 2.</li>
            <li><b>Failure</b> The creature is frightened 3.</li>
            <li><b>Critical Failure</b> The creature is frightened 3. It’s also fleeing for 1 round or until it is no longer frightened, whichever comes first.</li>
            
            <p>regards,</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Nov 8, 1:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
