  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">As I suggested I might, I'm going to give you the\
  \ general guidelines for the mysterious \"Create a Map\" round the Top 32 will face\
  \ starting Tuesday. This isn't official (the official rules will be posted Tuesday),\
  \ but it's not a trick either—this is just a casual discussion of what we're looking\
  \ for, and what we expect.</p> \n    <p>For Round 2, contestants will be asked to\
  \ provide a full-page map, or a previously unmapped fantasy-themed location in Golarion.\
  \ Submissions will need to be sent by email before the deadline. It needs to be\
  \ 8.5\" x 11\", and approximately 150 dpi when submitted. Your map may be color,\
  \ grayscale, or black and white, and may be hand-drawn or computer-generated.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The map itself is the entry, so it is important to make it interesting\
  \ and creative. Above and beyond all the tips on making your map legible and having\
  \ enough information for a cartographer to be able to create a publishable map from\
  \ your entry, it's crucial you make sure you map something that really needs a map.\
  \ If the map isn't needed to understanding what the area is like and how characters\
  \ may move around in it, then it's a waste of space that could be used for something\
  \ else. If the map is boring, no one will care about the location it represents.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>No one needs a map of a 20-foot by 20-foot room with a door centered\
  \ in the north and west walls, or of a forest that's six miles long and three miles\
  \ deep with a single road and one town in the middle. Your map should be something\
  \ that sparks the imagination, and leads to interesting encounters. It should also\
  \ use the 8.5\" x 11\" space well. A map that clearly ignores half or more of the\
  \ page will be disqualified.</p> \n    <p>Your submission need not be something\
  \ that could be published, but it must be something that could be used by a GM to\
  \ run a game set in the mapped location, and it must have all the information a\
  \ cartographer needs to make the final map. Voters are asked to vote not on artistic\
  \ talent, but on clarity, imagination, and usefulness.</p> \n    <p>Maps are incredibly\
  \ important, and they are a skill we simply haven't emphasized enough in the past.\
  \ A good map can get a GM or players excited about a location before they have read\
  \ a single word, while a bad map wastes space and may even confuse people. Even\
  \ very good adventure writers can produce maps that have to be entirely redrawn\
  \ by our developers or (worse) be so incomprehensible we have to abandon them and\
  \ rewrite an adventure to use a map we can create ourselves.</p> \n    <p>Freelancers\
  \ able to create clear and imaginative maps that don't need us to do anything but\
  \ send them to a cartographer have a huge advantage over those who can't (and may\
  \ even get work to create sketches of maps we then hand to adventure writers).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It's a big challenge, but it's also part of what I was talking about\
  \ when I said if you are a finalist this year, I want you to be confident you have\
  \ the skills it takes to become a successful RPG freelance adventure writer.</p>\
