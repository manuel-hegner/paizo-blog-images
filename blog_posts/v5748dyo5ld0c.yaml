  \ entire Pathfinder Society program, as well as to continue tying up lose ends,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8kc4\"><i>The Worldwound Gambit</i></a> by Robin D. Laws\
  \ has now been incorporated into the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n   <p>Because of\
  \ the differences between reading a novel and playing a game, there are specific\
  \ rules needed for using sanctioned content from a Pathfinder Tales novel during\
  \ play and we'll be providing a Chronicle sheet for players to use with their characters.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Sanctioned novels you ask? How do you sanction a novel? Because Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novels are stories first, there is no easy way to sanction items, spells,\
  \ feats, or other special abilities whole cloth. Therefore, the Chronicle sheets\
  \ use the following rules.</p> \n   <ol>\n    <li>Only items, feats, boons, or abilities\
  \ found on the Chronicle sheet are legal for play.</li> \n    <li>Each player must\
  \ have a copy of the Chronicle sheet with his or her character at all times.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>In order for the Chronicle sheet to be considered legal for play, the\
  \ player must show to the GM a copy of the Pathfinder Tales novel, either in printed\
  \ or digital format.</li> \n    <li>A Chronicle sheet may be applied to each character\
  \ the player currently has or creates in the future.</li>\n   </ol> \n   <p>GMs\
  \ are advised to work with players to make the sanctioning of Pathfinder Tales Chronicle\
  \ sheets easy and fast. As long as the player has her copy of the book, she should\
  \ be able to use the Chronicle sheet just like any other.</p> \n   <p>If you would\
  \ like to learn more about the Pathfinder Tales line, please visit paizo.com or\
  \ your local bookstore. Other novels in the line include <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfm\"\
  ><i>Master of Devils</i></a> by former Dragon Magazine editor Dave Gross, and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8iqp\"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> by Andrew Jones.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Also, don’t forget the awesome Pathfinder Tales Three-for-all sale that\
  \ is continuing through the end of January. For every two Pathfinder Tales novels\
  \ you purchase—whether in print or PDF/ePub—you'll get the third for free. Or purchase\
  \ any two Pathfinder Tales short fiction ePubs and get the third for free. Just\
  \ add them to your cart, and we'll discount the lowest-priced qualifying item at\
