  \ headscarf that is topped by a conic, pointed hat with a green ball near the top\

  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">You've created your character. You've tasted\
  \ that first bite of toil and heroics, earned your first thousand Experience Points,\
  \ and come back to town a hero. Is it time to hang up the sword, sidle into the\
  \ local tavern, and get free drinks for years in return for spinning yarns of your\
  \ youthful adventuring day? </p> \n     <p> Hell no. It's time to level up your\
  \ character so you can do it all again! </p> \n     <p> This week we're going to\
  \ examine how you advance your characters in Pathfinder. We are going to start with\
  \ your young fighter who resists the urge to retire and sit on his laurels and instead\
  \ decides that adventuring is his jam. Let's start by advancing the hero of our\
  \ story—a human (skilled) fighter, with the nomad background. Let's call him Kaliban.\
  \ </p> \n     <h2>First Steps</h2> \n     <p>Each time you gain a new level, there're\
  \ a few things you're going to want to do first. First, you're going to increase\
  \ your level by one and subtract 1,000 Experience Points (XP) for your XP total.\
  \ Then you're going to increase your Hit Points by the amount determined by class\
  \ and then add your Constitution modifier. </p> \n     <p> Kaliban is a fighter,\
  \ so his Hit Points increase by 10 + his Constitution bonus (let's say he has Con\
  \ 14) so his total Hit Points at 2nd level become 32. </p> \n     <p> Lastly, you're\
  \ going to take a look at your class progression table and apply any class features\
  \ that aren't feat choices, ability boosts, or skill increases. We'll take a closer\
  \ look at that later, at 3rd level when Kaliban gains the bravery class feature,\
  \ but at 2nd level, Kaliban gains a fighter feat and a skill feat as class features,\
  \ so we are going to move on to the next step. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"Table 3-12: FIGHTER ADVANCEMENT. Column 1: Your Level. Column 2: Class Features.\
  \ 1 | Ancestry and background, initial proficiencies, attack of opportunity, fighter\
  \ feat, shield block. 2 | Fighter feat, skill feat. 3| Bravery, general feat, skill\
  \ increase.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\"> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Choose Your\
  \ Feats</h2> \n     <p>In terms of pure role and effectiveness oomph, choosing a\
  \ new class feat is often the most exciting choice you can make when advancing your\
  \ character. First off, let's assume that during character creation Kaliban had\
  \ already taken Power Attack.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img\
  \ src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-powerattack.jpg\" alt=\"\
  Power attack. Two actions. Feat 1. Fighter. Flourish. You unleash a particularly\
  \ powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee\
  \ Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.\
  \ If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least\
  \ 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level,\
  \ increase it to three extra dice.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\"> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Kaliban likes power. And Power Attack allows Kaliban to deal even more\
  \ damage with his favorite weapon—a maul. At 2nd level, he could continue on this\
  \ punishing path by taking the Brutish Shove fighter feat, which allows him to throw\
  \ his enemies around the battlefield.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n\
  \      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-brutishshove.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Brutish Shove. One action. Feat 2. Fighter. Press. Requirements: You are\
  \ wielding a two-handed melee weapon.  Description: Throwing your weight behind\
  \ your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a\
  \ Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you have a target that is your size\
  \ or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and\
  \ you can automatically Shove it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including\
  \ the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to\
  \ follow the target, your movement doesn’t trigger reactions.  This Strike has the\
  \ following failure effect: The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your\
  \ current turn.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\"> \n     </div> \n     <p>This\
  \ seems like the obvious choice, but let's imagine Kaliban is not your typical fighter.\
  \ He's a particularly smart fellow (Intelligence 14). Let's also imagine that during\
  \ his first adventure, he came across a frightfully competent gnoll evoker who gave\
  \ Kaliban and his companions a tough time of it. And during that encounter, while\
  \ taking the abuse that gnoll was dishing out, Kaliban wondered what it would be\
  \ like to mix martial prowess with that kind of arcane might. Lucky for Kaliban,\
  \ once he reaches 2nd level, the fighter has the opportunity to grow in a different\
  \ direction. He can choose to multiclass. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > \n      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-wizarddedication.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Wizard Dedication. Feat 2. Archetype. Dedication. Multiclass. Prerequisites:\
  \ Intelligence 14. Description: You cast spells like a wizard, gaining a spell book\
  \ with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain the Cast a Spell activity.\
  \ You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spell book. You’re trained in\
  \ arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs.Your key spell casting ability for wizard\
  \ archetype spells is Int, and they are arcane wizard spells. You become trained\
  \ in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in\
  \ a skill of your choice. Special: You can’t select another dedication feat until\
  \ you have gained two other feats from the wizard archetype.\" style=\"padding-bottom:\
  \ 20px;\"> \n     </div> \n     <p>It's not a bad deal. A spellbook with four cantrips,\
  \ the ability to prepare two of them a day, and training in Arcana strikes the fighter\
  \ as more promising than just pushing around his enemies. Some fighters might scoff\
  \ at such dalliance, but Kaliban decides to go the fighter/wizard route. Taking\
  \ a quick look at the arcane cantrips, he chooses to scribble daze, mage hand, shield,\
  \ and telekinetic projectile in his spellbook. Most adventuring days, he typically\
  \ leans on shield and telekinetic projectile as his prepared cantrips.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>After picking his class feat, Kaliban picks a skill feat. He has training\
  \ in the following skills: Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Crafting, Desert Lore,\
  \ Intimidation, Nature, Society, Stealth, and Survival, so he has a lot of choices.\
  \ But let's say Kaliban has become enamored with his brief magical studies and chooses\
  \ Arcane Sense. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-arcanesense.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Arcane Sense. Feat 1. General. Skill. Prerequisites: trained in Arcana.\
  \ Description: Your study of magic allows you to instinctively sense its presence.\
  \ You can cast 1st-level *detect magic* at will as an arcane innate spell. If you’\
  re a master in Arcana, the spell is heightened to 3rd level; if you’re legendary,\
  \ it is heightened to 4th level.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\"> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>This way Kaliban can always be on the lookout for more magic to supplement\
  \ his spellbook, equipment, and his split aspirations. </p> \n     <p> With his\
  \ skill feat chosen, all he has to do is adjust his various skills, attack rolls,\
  \ and DCs to reflect his increased level and new bonuses, and he is done. He has\
  \ everything he needs to continue adventuring with more than a few new tricks up\
  \ his sleeve. </p> \n     <h2>Each New Level, Repeat</h2> \n     <p>Each time you\
  \ gain a level, the method by which you increase your level stays the same. Only\
  \ the details and choices change. To make it easy for you to remember what you need\
  \ to do each level, there's a bullet-point list on page 31 of the Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition Core Rulebook. Follow those directions each level, and you'll be set.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-levelingupchecklist.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Leveling-up Checklist. Every time you gain a level, make sure you do each\
  \ of the following: \r\n- Increase your level by 1 and subtract 1,000 XP from your\
  \ XP total.\r\n- Increase your maximum Hit Points by the amount listed in your class\
  \ entry in Chapter 3. \r\nAdd class features from your class advancement table,\
  \ including ability boosts and skill increases.\r\n- Select feats as indicated on\
  \ your class advancement table. For ancestry feats, see Chapter 2. For class feats,\
  \ see your class entry in Chapter 3. For general feats and skill feats, see Chapter\
  \ 5. \r\n- Add spells and spell slots if your class grants spell casting. See Chapter\
  \ 7 for spells.\r\n- Increase all of your proficiency bonuses by 1 from your new\
  \ level, and make other increases to your proficiency bonuses as necessary from\
  \ skill increases or other class features. \r\n- Increase any other statistics that\
  \ changed as a result of ability boots or other abilities.\r\n- Adjust bonuses from\
  \ feats and other abilities that are based on your level.\" style=\"padding-bottom:\
  \ 30px;\"> \n     </div> \n     <p>When Kaliban reaches 3rd level, even though he's\
  \ multiclassed into wizard, he is still primarily a fighter, and he is going to\
  \ advance as a 3rd-level fighter. He'll gain 12 more Hit Points (bringing his total\
  \ to 44) and get the bravery class feature, along with a general feat and a skill\
  \ increase. First, let's take a look at bravery.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > \n      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-bravery.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Bravery. 3rd.\r\nHaving faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you\
  \ have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. Your\
  \ proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at\
  \ a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.  In addition,\
  \ any time you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1.\" style=\"\
  padding-bottom: 20px;\"> \n     </div> \n     <p>While Kaliban is trained in Will\
  \ saving throws, during character creation he chose to boost Intelligence instead\
  \ of Wisdom, so bravery is going to be a big help. At second level his Will saving\
  \ throw was +4. Thanks to bravery it jumps up to a +7 while granting him some extra\
  \ protection against fear effects. </p> \n     <p> The skill increase allows him\
  \ to either become trained in a new skill or to become an expert in a skill he's\
  \ already trained in. Kaliban has a pretty robust set of skills, especially for\
  \ a fighter, so he is going to invest the skill increase in raising one of his skills\
  \ to expert proficiency. Since he's been focusing many of his build resources into\
  \ his magical training, this time he'll use his skill training to become an expert\
  \ in Athletics. </p> \n     <p> What about that general feat? Well, it just so happens\
  \ that Magical Crafting pops up at 2nd level, so maybe Kaliban can find a way to\
  \ increase his power in the magical arts after all. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ the end, each level that you attain increases your ability to customize your character.\
  \ We only completed two levels of Kaliban's advancement, and he has made many exciting\
  \ and diverse choices, most of which were out of the ordinary. Not only does the\
  \ fighter have an abundance of choice with just fighter class feats, but by taking\
  \ dedication feats to multiclass or take on an archetype, the fighter increases\
  \ the number and variety of choices available to him at each new level. Add to that\
  \ further customization through skill advancement, general feats (skill and otherwise),\
  \ and ancestry feats gained after 1st level, and at every level your adventurer\
  \ becomes a unique legend sure to leave a mark on your campaign's story and the\
  \ world of Pathfinder.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
