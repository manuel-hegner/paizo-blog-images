            <p itemprop="description">Janira consults her notes, then stares at the box in her hands.  She feels around the carved surface, fingers tracing the grooves etched in the wood.  She pauses, her fingers splayed across the surface, as she looks back to the parchment spread out in front of her.  Holding still, her fingers not moving from their assigned points on the box, she skims the notes again, then looks up at the grey-robed Pathfinder Initiate sitting across from her.</p>
            
            <p>“Okay, Sidney! Before I apply pressure, I want you to confirm I’ve got the right points.” </p>
            
            <p>The initiate reaches for the notes sitting before Janira, pulling the paper closer to them. Reading off the list of notes, they indicate pressure points necessary to open the box. </p>

            <p>“Rose. Nasturtium. Gallardia. Poppy. Anemones. Strawberry. Primrose. Viola,” they intone.</p>

            <p>Janira turns the box, careful not to move her fingers.  “Check! Alright, step back now. If something goes wrong, only one of us needs to pay the consequences.”</p>

            <p>Sidney moves across the room and opens the door, weight shifted to the balls of their feet for quick movement. They turn and look at Janira. “Are you sure you don’t want help?”</p>

            <p>“Nope. I got this!” she replies cheerily, though a slight waver underlies her concern.  “Ready?”</p>

            <p>She applies pressure, her fingers depressing the centers of the flowers.  A faint click echoes from deep inside the box. She smiles and tries to lift the top. Unsuccessful, she sighs. “Nope. Back to the notes. This puzzle won’t answer itself.”</p>

            <p>Sidney returns to her side, shaking their head.  “Unfortunate. We thought we had the answer.”</p>

            <p>Janira frowns briefly and lets out a little sigh. “Not this time. But we won’t give up. There are more records to comb and papers to go through.  How about you head down to the library and see if they’ve dug up any more information.  I’ll go check with Master of Scrolls Kreighton Shaine and see if he’s in a mood to talk about the box or still waxing poetic about the new blooms in the south garden.”</p>

            <p>Clapping Sidney on the shoulder, Janira smiles. “Don’t give up hope, Sidney. We’ll get through this sooner or later.”</p>

			<p>A quick Pathfinder Society (second edition) Achievement Point (AcP) update.  We’ve dug into the issues, kicked a few things loose, and as a result, seen some changes in player and GM AcP numbers.  Unfortunately, they still aren’t reflecting all games at the right totals. Looking into the number discrepancies, we think we have identified some of the issues holding back the rollout of Achievement Points. This week, we’re working on some implementation plans and will have another update next week as part of the May Update!</p>
            
            <p>For those that didn’t see it yet, PaizoCon is back as PaizoCon Online! Check out <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh77?PaizoCon-Online-Will-Be-Scheduled-For-May-2631">Monday’s blog</a> post for more information.</p>
            
            <p>Until next time,</p>
            
            <p>Explore, Report, Cooperate – and Wash Hands!</p>

Imagine that there are dice for revealing cosmic conspiracy theories. These dice could be a player’s best choice in their fight against twisted alien masterminds and their sinister plot. This set is dark gray with yellow paint to mark the digits and rich engravings. The whole design is inspired by science fiction movie thrillers, where the enemy is alien, unknown and hidden in dark corners of spaceships. On the highest face, there is the symbol of mysterious three triangles that symbolize three layers of space conspiracy. </p>

			<p>Each dice set has a $13.00 MSRP and available today at <b>paizo.com</b> and <a href="https://q-workshop.com/en/">q-workshop.com</a>. </p>

                <p>The heroes and their circus arrive in Willowside, a swamp community in dire need of diversion from the relentless expansion of the blighted land known as the Welt. Willowside soon experiences a problem of a different sort, as dinosaur-riding xulgaths blockade the town. The heroes mount a defense of the village and learn what has brought the xulgaths to this isolated settlement. When the heroes break the siege, they learn that the xulgaths follow a monstrous ex-slave and have forsaken their directive to assault a nearby aeon tower. The tower's current occupants know more, and put the heroes on the path to reach the fifth and final <em>aeon orb</em>.</p>

This volume also includes a gazetteer of the town of Willowside and lore about the inhabitants of the Abyssal realm of Gluttondark, as well as new monsters and xulgath-themed rules.</p>

            <p>Whether you're the hunter or the hunted, <em>Pathfinder Chase Cards</em> make your choices during the pursuit matter. Each full-color card in this beautifully illustrated 55-card deck contains obstacles to overcome during your chase, from an angry barking dog to an imposing stone wall, each one using checks from the Pathfinder Second Edition Roleplaying Game. Make the right check to overcome the obstacles and you might just catch your prey, but fail and you might be left with a cold trail. Lay the cards down on your table to create the path of your chase, allowing you to track each character's progress and determine the die rolls needed to avoid or navigate unexpected dangers. Lay out a desperate pursuit through a crowded city, a dangerous race through hostile wilderness, and a nerve-wracking run through deadly ruins and abandoned buildings—or mix and match the cards to create a chase that moves through multiple regions!</p>

            <p>An unexpected alliance begins! The masked priest Narsen invites the Pathfinders to the city of Xer in Razmiran, a closed nation dedicated to Razmir, the Living God. Normally insular and isolated, access to Razmiran represents a unique opportunity for the Pathfinder Society. Narsen has even sweetened the pot by offering to fund the repair of an old keep to serve as the Society's new lodge. As the first Pathfinders arrive to oversee repairs on the lodge-to-be, will this mark the historic first moment in an unlikely partnership, or will it trigger a disaster of unmitigated proporitions?<br />Written by: Alex Greenshields</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, May 3, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<div class="blurbCenter">
        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharBack.jpg "><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharBack.jpg "/></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
        
        <h3>Core Set Valeros</h3>
        
        <p><b>Best Skill:</b> Strength (d10)<br />
			<b>Character Type:</b> Warrior, Melee</p>

			<p><b><em>Skills</em></b>. Valeros doesn’t have the Strength of Amiri, but d10 isn’t bad. Overall, it’s pretty easy to remember his strengths and weaknesses: physical stats are good, mental stats are bad. Valeros makes up for his d10 die with four different subskills. He can choose to fight hand-to-hand (Melee: Strength +2) or from afar (Ranged: Dexterity +1). Melee is on average two points better, but Ranged is a slight rarity, shared by just two other Core Set characters: Fumbus and Harsk. So Valeros might go in that direction just to have a protected niche. Otherwise, Valeros’ subskills are all common as dirt: Diplomacy, Fortitude, and Melee are shared by five different characters each!</p>

       
			<p><em>Weaknesses</em>. Valeros’s d4 is in Intelligence. He probably doesn’t care.</p>
            
            <p><b><em>Cards</em></b>. Valeros’s focus is obviously on combat, with weapons (4) and armors (3) taking up almost half of his card slots. Valeros also has a good count of allies (3) and blessings (3), which gives him plenty of opportunity to take additional turns. Besides his total lack of spells (0), Valeros is also somewhat limited in items (2), which gives him slightly less variability. Unlike some versions of Valeros, the Core Set character won’t get his hand clogged with weapons, as he can cycle them for local combat bonuses. Nonetheless, he’ll probably want to increase his counts of weapons, items, allies, and blessings in tandem, to remain a balanced character. Valeros is a great example of how to build a balanced character without a lot of complexity, which is what makes him (still) a simple character.
            
            <p><em>Allies</em>. If you’re planning to pick the Compatriot role for Valeros, allies are especially important. Allies with local powers are especially complementary for Valeros, as he should be teaming up with other people, so take a look at cards like the Bodyguard, the Crow, or the Soldier. Compatriot Valeros will also be able to recover allies from the discard pile, so don’t be afraid of those scant allies that have discard-only abilities (like the Merchant in <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>).</p>
            
            <p><em>Armor</em>. Because Valeros is proficient with armor, he’ll want the good stuff that requires proficiencies for full usage. Spiked Half-Plate gives some nice combat bonuses, while Chain Mail can be buried to fully resist damage (and maybe even recharged). There are many others. Though most characters don’t like shields because they have no display power and so tend to get stuck in the hand, that’s not a problem for Valeros since he can choose to recharge or reload one at the end of his turn. Something like the Covering Heavy Shield, which can be used to protect others, is particularly nice for a low-level Valeros (though a higher-level Valeros Compatriot can get a similar power on every shield).</p>
            
            <p><em>Blessings</em>. Valeros is sometimes a follower of Cayden Cailean, but he might also want blessings from Gorum (which tend to help physical combat), Torag (which tend to boost Strength and Constitution), or Lamashtu (for killing monsters).</p>
            
            <p><em>Items</em>. If you’re planning for the Drunken Avenger role, you might want to stock up on Liquids. This tends to mean Alchemical items, although there are a few exceptions, including Holy Water and Liquid Courage in Curse of the Crimson Throne. To hold on to these items, Valeros will have to take the Liquid proficiency power feat (which will also give him a 1d12 bonus to the various Craft or Divine roles needed to recharge).</p>
            
            <p><em>Weapons</em>. Valeros is a sword-and-board fighter, so he’ll want to grab all the Sword weapons, right? Not necessarily. In the Core Set, Sword weapons tend to activate their special powers when they reload, but since Valeros can recharge or reload weapons from his discard pile, he may want to consider grabbing more powerful non-Sword weapons that discard for their main ability, such as the Battleaxe or Mace, or even ranged weapons like the ever-popular Deathbane Light Crossbow. Obviously, Sword weapons that discard, like the Dogslicer, are great choices too. And since Valeros’ favored card is specifically Sword weapons, you may want to limit yourself to just one favorite one, ensuring you start every game with it in hand. (And that does suggest that all of this strategy goes against Valeros’ intended theming, but so be it: mechanics rule.) Just be sure not to grab Two-Handed weapons unless you’re explicitly avoiding shields.</p>
            
            <h3>The Power of Fighting</h3>
            
            <p>Valeros’ combat-focused feats are all pretty easy to use, but there’s nonetheless some subtlety in them too.</p>
            
            <p><em><b>Stick with Your Fellows</em></b>. Valeros has always been a team player, and that remains the case in his Core Set incarnation. Not only can he add to local combat checks by temporarily giving up his weapons and armor, but his roles have some additional team-up powers, and he’s also a cheap avenge (more on which momentarily). So, the simplest rule for Valeros is: hang with your buds. You might stay with another character who can support local characters (creating a synergistic relationship) or you might support someone who’s not a fighter. Of course, you could team up with someone who meets both of those criteria: Lem is a particularly great fellow for Valeros.</p>
            <blockquote><p><em>Clarification: What is a local check?</em> Local means “at your location” (see page 6 of the Core Set rules), so a local check is a check by a character at your location—including yourself. The important thing to remember about Valeros’s ability to add a bonus to local combat checks is that he can help his friends or <em>himself</em>(!).</p></blockquote>
            
            <p><b><em>Use Swords (and Armor) as Damage</em></b>. Because of Valeros’ ability to recharge discarded weapons and armor, you should discard those cards when you take damage, because you can put one back into his deck each turn. Make sure you don’t empty your hand of weapons, but if you have extras, you can toss them into the discards. Armor will more often be used to <em>reduce</em> damage than discarded as damage, but when an armor just doesn’t protect from the right sort of damage (or alternatively, when it might have to be buried or banished otherwise), then it should be thrown out, to later be recovered.</p>
            <blockquote><p><em>Clarification: Can you discard displayed armor as damage? </em> No. When you display a card, it is “not part of [your] hand, deck, or discards” (see page 7 of the <em>Core Set</em> rules). But that also means that you get to keep your displayed armor, even when you empty your hand due to damage. There are times when you might make that decision!</p></blockquote>
            
            <p><b><em>Avenge Your Friends</em></b>. One of the reasons that Valeros should stick with his friends is so that he can avenge them. For most characters, avenging is expensive, requiring them to bury a card), but Valeros can make the cost more bearable (by discarding, which he can recover if it’s a weapon or armor) or even cheap (if he buys the “recharge to avenge” feat). Though avenging doesn’t save the original character from the bad effects of losing an encounter, it usually saves an exploration’s worth of time (presuming that Valeros doesn’t expend a card that would otherwise give him another exploration) and it’s particularly helpful when fighting a villain that would otherwise escape.</p>
            <blockquote><p><em>Clarification: What can you avenge?</em> A “local” character can avenge “an undefeated bane” (see page 10 of the Core Set rules). This typically means they can fight a monster or a barrier that a local character failed to beat. This can include a summoned bane, which can be used to good effect. (For example, a local character might have drawn a Warband barrier, which causes everyone to fight a monster. If the local character lost their own fight against the monster, Valeros could choose to avenge the original Warband card, which would cause everyone to fight again, but he’d do better to avenge the monster fight.) It can also include avenging a villain, because you are “ignoring steps and effects that would cause the bane to go anywhere.” Note, however, that you can’t avenge most location closing attempts, because they’re typically just die rolls, not banes. The exception, obviously, is when closing summons a bane that must be defeated!</p></blockquote>
            
            <p><b><em>Take Your Choice of Power Feats</b></em>. Most characters have a power feat that goes straight to the heart of their character powers, and is thus a pretty obvious first choice. For Valeros, the closest is the ability to increase his local combat help from +1d4 to +1d6, an average of a +1 increase on every local combat roll. But his 4 hand size is brutally low, and should be increased to 5 quickly—especially since providing help requires him to have cards in his hand—so that’s another strong first choice. Finally, a Diplomacy scarcity in the party might cause him to go in that direction. (The ability to avenge with a recharge is perhaps the least compelling as a first power feat.)</p>
            
            <h3>The Power of Cycling</h3>
            <p>Valeros isn’t one of the legendary cyclers like Lem and Seoni, but in the Core Set, he can do a solid job of keeping his cards flowing.</p>
            
            <p><b><em>Cycle Your Deck</b></em>. Cycling your deck—drawing new cards into your hand and putting old cards back into your draw pile—is a particularly important aspect of the game. It ensures your hand doesn’t get clogged with cards you don’t use and it digs through your deck to the good stuff. Fortunately, Valeros has multiple ways to cycle. He can choose to either reload or recharge armors or weapons to grant combat bonuses, so he should do so in a way that spreads each type of card out over the entirety of his deck. Sometimes, Valeros will want to provide a bonus in combat even when the odds are already pretty good, just to clear his hand. And don’t forget about his power to recharge at the end of the turn: though the best use is to recharge a card from Valeros’s discard pile (providing a bit of healing), you can also recharge from Valeros’s hand to help clear it, especially if he didn’t have a combat encounter on his turn.</p>
            <blockquote><p><em>Clarification: Can you reload or recharge a displayed armor? </em>No, because it’s not in your hand. Valeros’ end-of-the-turn recharge power clearly says that the card has to be in his hand or discard. His help-a-local power isn’t as specific, but the rules (see page 8) clarify this situation: “If you are instructed to play, reveal, display, reload, discard, recharge, bury, banish, or otherwise manipulate a card, that card must come from your hand unless you are activating a power on a displayed card.” So, if you want to be able to use one of Valeros’ armors to help someone out, don’t display it. (Usually, this means you should display your armor just before you draw cards, to have it available up to that minute.)</p></blockquote>
            
            <h3>The Valeros Roles</h3>
            <p><em>Valeros’ two roles are clearly segregated: the Compatriot is all about allies and the Drunken Avenger is all about Liquid boons. Choose the one that suits your play and Valeros’ deck better—though if you’re playing the Core Set that’s likely to be Compatriot just because of the paucity of Liquids in that set.</em></p>
            
            <div class="blurbCenter">
        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg"><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosDrunkenAvenger.jpg"><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosDrunkenAvenger.jpg"/></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
            
            <p><em><b>Compatriot</em></b>. This lets Valeros easily acquire allies and use them to fuel his powers. The ability to acquire an ally that a local character missed is one of his best powers, and almost always worth it, as you’re usually trading a so-so card for a go-again. This role also makes Valeros’ shields better than ever. Generally, take this role if you’ve collected shields or allies or if you’re focused on Valeros’ supportive role.</p>
            
            <p><em><b>Drunken Avenger</b></em>. Similarly, this role lets Valeros easily acquire Liquids and use them to fuel his powers. That might be a little weak currently just because of the limited number of Liquids in the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>, but it’s a lot of fun. The role also offers some powers to make Valeros’s avenging more powerful, plus what may be the worst power in the game: one that forces Valeros to move randomly, but lets him heal when he does so. Since most games are won or lost on character positioning, this can be horrible—but somewhat resolvable if you also have Amiri in your party. Generally, take this role if you’ve collected Liquids, if you’ve focused on Valeros’s avenging role, or if you just want something that’s funny and fun.</p>

			<p itemprop="description">Hello everyone! The Organized Play team has been hard at work on the summer round of scenarios, including the launch of Starfinder Society’s third year: the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh4f?Starfinder-Society-Twitch-Stream-Recap-and">previously announced</a> <b>Year of Exploration’s Edge</b>.

            <p>As with every new year of Starfinder Society play, the Organized Play team, in conjunction with our amazing Art Team, puts together a new symbol to represent the events of the upcoming year. The three different images within this year’s symbol really tie-in with three distinct story arcs scheduled to come out as part of this upcoming year of content—we also couldn’t help but sneak in more art of the Starfinder Society’s newest vessel, the Gorgon! We really think that this symbol brings together a lot of what the upcoming set of scenarios is going to deliver.</p>

            <p>One big change in this year is an entirely new cover layout for scenarios that more closely matches the covers of other Starfinder adventure products. In order to make this change, not to mention get some cool looking art for an updated website, we needed a half-page art piece that really showcased what the Year of Exploration’s Edge was all about. Keen eyes may notice that the right-hand side of the image is a bit sparse, but fear not, the team is going to be filling that space with art throughout the year!</p>

            <p>There’s still a few weeks before we start showcasing our new scenarios, including some new pretty useful updates to layout that should be welcome by both Organized Play participants and those GMs looking to run adventures outside of Organized Play. Until then, stay tuned to this blog for the latest updates on Starfinder Society and Organized Play!</p>

			<blockquote>
            
            <p itemprop="description">Ambrus reaches up and pinches the bridge of his nose, looking away from the stacks of reports piled on his desk. The reports got a little harder to read each year, and not just the ones with the names of friends and students listed in the casualty reports.</p>
            
            <p>“About time for someone from the next generation to take over,” Ambrus mutters to himself. “Fola hasn’t won over the entire Decemvirate yet, but she will if she just spends a bit more time at the lodge. Ah well, no point dwelling on things to come when there’s a task to be done now.”</p>
            
            <p>Finishing his sentence, Ambrus plucks the next report off the pile in front of him. “Muesello’s team is all outfitted... Good. If we’re going to claim the wayfinder as our badge of office, we should at least make sure we know everything there is to know about the things! Hmm... Looks like he’s using the captain I recommended for transport. He’s a cagey old fellow, he’ll keep things under wraps until we know what’s going on.” His ruminations complete, Ambrus quickly applies his seal to the document and moves it to the tray for reports marked “Not for Publication”.</p>
            
            <p>The steward rolls his eyes and lets out an incredulous snort as he picks up the next set of reports and views their submitter’s mark. Two separate files, one stamped with the image of a mask in silver and the other containing Venture-Captain Holgarin Smine’s seal pressed into a lump of charcoal-blackened candle wax. Flipping through the pages, Ambrus suppresses a wry smile. “Should’ve known Smine wouldn’t be happy about me accepting that Razmiri’s application for a lodge. Of course, they’re up to trouble, old friend, that’s why I want us to be the ones keeping an eye on them. Gods preserve us if they team up with the Aspis or someone else with more ambition than sense. And Narsen... That one’s trouble even for one of his ilk, but he’s the finest magical crafter I’ve met since Muesello, and he’s not like any Razmiri priest I’ve ever met before.” Ambrus sets down the reports for a minute and sighs. “I hope you’re worth it, priest. If I’m wrong about you, it’ll be my own Pathfinders who run me out of here before whatever trouble you bring reaches me.”</p>
            
            <p>Setting the reports in the bin marked “For Archival Review”, Ambrus picks up the next file, this one written on expensive white vellum in a crisp hand. “Always so precise, Sheila. Who’d have thought I’d be reading your report on recruiting...  a squad of hobgoblin field agents from Oprak? Of all things! As though our last confirmation class promoting half a dozen goblins to full Pathfinder agent status wasn’t enough!” Ambrus sighs again before flipping to the second page. “Smart move to meet the new recruits in Kaer Maga. They’ll stand out a bit less and it might give us an opportunity to learn a bit more about the state of things over there—it’s been a bit too quiet lately.”</p>
            
            <p>Finishing his stack of reports, his desk clear for a few blessed moments, Ambrus smiles and pulls a small cord near his desk, ringing the bell to summon a fresh pot of tea. “They’ll be fine. We’ve got good people. This lodge was here before me, and it’ll be here long after I’m gone.”</p>
            
            <p>“What’s that, sir?” A young, gray robed halfling wheeling a small cart enters as Ambrus finishes his thought and looks up with confusion plain on his face.</p>
            
            <p>“Nothing lad,” Ambrus replies, “just talking to myself. You’ll find that happens when you get a few more years on you and spend most of your days locked in a room reading over reports. Now, about that tea...”</p>

			<p itemprop="description">Celita reviewed the scrolling information displayed on the terminal in front of her. She had come to appreciate intaking data through terminals, rather than directly through optical implants, ever since her decision to retake her original name. As she reviewed the final decoded information, Celita could not help but shift her eyes to the vesk pacing around the small office chamber: Radaszam of the Acquisitives.</p>
            
            <p>“Still no word from Fitch or Ziggy?” Radaszam asked aloud, though the question was more directed to the walls than to Celita.</p>
            
            <p>“Nothing new. Fitch requested Zigvigix’s presence on the Master of Stars due to what she referred to as a ‘very very serious serious situation’ involving some sort of illicit shipment of creatures that may have gotten loose on Absalom Station. She said that she has a group of agents assembled to handle the situation and that it did not concern either of us. I trust her judgement on such matters, and you should learn to as well.” Celita paused in her speaking as the data finished moving through. “Here we are, our data package is complete.”</p>
            
            <p>Without a sound of movement, Radaszam suddenly loomed over Celita’s terminal. The vesk’s reptilian head took the data in at an odd angle and Celita gently pushed her chair back to accommodate a better viewing position for her fellow faction leader.</p>
            
            <p>“Ha ha! You and your agents did it, Celita! It looks like we have finally decoded the coordinates on that beacon found by agents last year. You know what this means? It means we can keep on trailing Jelev Rasheen and her fabled fleet. You get this prepared and I’ll assemble the best team of agents I can find. Oh, Celita my friend, I can smell the credits and fame already! HA HA!”</p>

        <center><h2><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/fiction/tales/shorts">Pathfinder Tales on ePub</a></h2></center>
        
        <p>Are you looking for another, perhaps more flexible format to enjoy the free web fiction from last week? Well, forty-six of the titles were converted into a downloadable ePub format. Other short fiction titles were consolidated for you from material originally published over the course of multiple Pathfinder Adventure Paths. Now, they are on sale for a mere handful of copper pieces (25% off) during our Spring Social sale.</p>
        
        <p>If you don’t know, EPUB is an e-book file format that uses the ".epub" file extension. The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub. EPUB is supported by many e-readers, and compatible software is available for most smartphones, tablets, and computers. Now you know.</p>
        
        <p>These stories come from a diverse cadre of talented experienced authors, from fan-favorite authors like Amber E. Scott, Dave Gross, Liane Merciel, Richard Lee Byers, and Kevin Andrew Murphy, to acclaimed game designer–authors like James L. Sutter, Robin D. Law, and Monte Cook, You’ll find two sets of tales from New York Times best-selling author Elaine Cunningham (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8lx3?Pathfinder-Tales-The-Illusionist-ePub"><em>The Illusionist</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8k9m?Pathfinder-Tales-Dark-Tapestry-ePub"><em>Dark Tapestry</em></a>), and one from legendary game designer and author Ed Greenwood (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8lwz?Pathfinder-Tales-Guns-of-Alkenstar-ePub"><em>Guns of Alkenstar</em></a>), creator of Elminster and the Forgotten Realms. Hugo Award-winner Tim Pratt (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy92ne?Pathfinder-Tales-A-Tomb-of-Winters-Plunder-ePub"><em>A Tomb of Winter's Plunder</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy92nb?Pathfinder-Tales-Bastard-Sword-ePub"><em>Bastard, Sword</em></a>) is there too!</p>

        <p>Just look at the places they’ll take you! The conflict-ridden Goblinblood Wars, the plane-breaking Worldwound, the undead-ruled land of Geb, the devil-worshiping nation of Cheliax, Lastwall, before the fall, the magical college known as the Magambyaa in the Mwangi Expanse, faraway Tian Xiathe, the mean streets of Magnimar, and the River Kingdoms of <em>Kingmaker</em> fame are just of the few of the localities. You can explore organizations like the disciplined Hellknights, the rich merchant lords of Katapesh, the mysterious Shadowcallers of Nidal, the insidious Gray Maidens, and the pirates of the Shackles to name but a few—all written under the guidance of the Pazio Creative Directors.</a>

     <p>Perhaps some of them may inspire your next character, NPC, and villain concept in your game, so read on Pathfinders. Let us know what you find, what was meh, and what was YAY! Next week we will dive into the Pathfinder Tales novels themselves, which are available in many formats. In a few short weeks, we will be back with more original free web fiction.</p>
     
     <p>Adventures Ahead!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, April 26, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

           <p itemprop="description">Janira rushs into Ambrus’ office, excitedly waving a parchment in the air. Her hurried entrance caused enough of a disturbance to rustle the papers lying on his desk. He glances up from the paper in hand, a look of irritation briefly passing over his features. </p>

			<p>Laying the parchment onto the stack before him, Ambrus took a deep breath. “What is it this time, Janira?” he asks, trying to keep the exasperation from his voice. </p>

			<p>“Great news from Pathfinders to the east! They’re holding a version of our Convocation in their area. With a pool! And beer! And people! Now I just need to convince the Decemvirate that I should attend.” She bounces on the balls of her feet, her uncontainable enthusiasm preventing her from standing still.</p>

			<p>“I’m sure they will say yes. Just complete the necessary request paperwork.” He reaches into his right desk drawer and draws out a roll of parchment, looks up at the lively halfling, then sighs and dips his quill into the inkpot on his desk. “How about I help, since you don’t look like settling down to write anytime soon. What are the particulars?”</p>

			<p>Together, they completed the paperwork. “Thanks for helping!” Janira leans over and gives Ambrus a quick hug, then hurries to the door. “You’ll file that today, yes? I don’t want to wait too long for an answer!” Before he can reply, she opens the door, finding a large group of Pathfinders waiting outside. The group parts, allowing her to move into the corridor. Ambrus’ chuckles briefly and motions the Pathfinders to enter. A faint “goodbye” drifts back into the room, caught on the breeze, as Janira runns to her next encounter.</p>

            <p>We are pleased to announce the launch of PaizoCon Francia under the direction of Regional Venture-Coordinator Benoît Gros. In his words, “After 6 consecutive years, GardenCon evolves into PaizoCon Francia. Come enjoy the only open-air PaizoCon in the beautiful Geneva countryside. Not convinced yet? How about a laidback schedule, local craft beer, and tables played in English or French to fulfill your mid-August gamers needs! Still not convinced? Did we mention there's also a pool?”</p>
            
            <p></b>PaizoCon Francia</b> will be held at the Route de la Craz, Thônex, Geneva, from <b>August 13th to 16th, 2020</b>. More details will appear as the organizing team passes them to us, including registration information.</p>
            
            <p><em>Before you go</em>…We have a procedural announcement that we will include in our next monthly update, but that we wanted to announce to our society GMs and organizers before the first week of May.</p>
            
            <p>Feedback from our communities regarding tables for Pathfinder Society (second edition) indicates that 7-player tables aren’t working. So, we are phasing them out. Starting as soon as possible, we ask GMs to move to 6-player tables. We are giving a transition period so that we don’t cause issues for conventions and events already planned. As of June 1st, seven players will not be legal tables. In cases of 7 players, the tables should be split into two. This will make a more balanced experience and works better within the scaling mechanisms of the program.</p>
            
            <p>That’s all for today. Come back next week when we preview the April scenarios and quest. Until then, may you all stay safe and remember to Explore, Report, Cooperate, Wash Hands!</p>

    <p itemprop="description">No two characters worship the same way. How and why they worship their deities are as varied as the player base of Paizo’s organized play campaign. Many players choose for their characters to follow the examples of several deities, seeing a personal connection between them that motivates and inspires their journey.

            <p itemprop="description">No two characters worship the same way. How and why they worship their deities are as varied as the player base of Paizo’s organized play campaign. Many players choose for their characters to follow the examples of several deities, seeing a personal connection between them that motivates and inspires their journey. In some cases, adventuring parties form around one of these custom pantheons, becoming regional memes that take on a life of their own. Perhaps you have created a Pathfinder pantheon yourself?</p>
            
            <p>Now you have the chance.</p>
            
            <p><em>Lost Omens: Gods & Magic</em> introduced us to a set of rules for creating and worshiping polytheistic pantheons. Developer Luis Loza graciously showed us more examples in his blog post, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh2v">Friends in High Places</a>. The Know Direction Network in collaboration with the Organized Play Team invites you to submit a brand-new pantheon, with the best submission becoming a sanctioned option for the Pathfinder Society!</p>
             
			<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-godesses.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="max-width:75%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20200121-godesses.jpg" alt=""></a><p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>
            
            <p>There will be several stages to the contest. Upon receipt, Know Direction staff will review all submissions for contest criteria compliance (say that five times fast). After that, Know Direction judges will select their top pantheons from the anonymized entries and send them to Paizo Organized Play staff, for vetting as potential includees in the organized play program. From the vetted pool, the Know Direction judges will select their favorites. Paizo will host a highlight blog about the finalists and launch a period of voting by the public. Once voting closes, the winner will be announced via blog post on paizo.com, invited to participate in an episode of the Know Direction podcast, and the pantheon will be sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder (second edition) Society.</p>

            <h3>Free Web Fiction</h3>
            
            <p>In <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/fiction/tales/serial">Pathfinder Tales Web Fiction</a>, Paizo's talented authors presented Pathfinder Tales web fiction, short multi-part adventures featuring the exploits of daring denizens of the Pathfinder world. These completely free adventures gave a taste of the thrills to come in Pathfinder Tales novels, and often featured some of the very same characters from the same cast of superstar authors and game creators!</p>
            
            <p>Whether you are new to the Lost Omens setting or have been exploring it for a decade, you’ll find nearly sixty free stories to immerse yourself in lore and art. Some of these stories took place years ago in-game. Where are they now? What new player characters, NPCs, and villains can be discovered?</p>

            <p itemprop="description">If you’ve been following the ground-breaking <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh1m?-Alexa-Play-Starfinder">arrival of Starfinder on Amazon Alexa</a>, I have some exciting news—earlier this month, a meatier, shinier version of “Scoundrels in the Spike”, my adventure adapted for Alexa’s voice game—was released to the entire world!</p>

            <p>You can now play through the game on Amazon’s cloud-based voice service as two additional player characters, Obozaya, the reptilian vesk soldier and Keskodai, the bug-like shirren mystic. </p>
            
            <p>Those of you familiar with Obozaya will find that she’s just as tough, honorable, and devastating in close-quarters combat in the voice game as she is in the tabletop RPG. Those who fancy Keskodai will find that he’s a wise healer who still absolutely revels in meeting new people and gaining new experiences. Obozaya and Keskodai join the existing cast of player characters: Navasi, the human envoy; Quig, the ysoki mechanic; and Iseph, the android operative. Raia, the witty and curious lashunta technomancer, is available to join players as an adventuring buddy.</p>
            
            <p>The pilot episode also now includes a streamlined introduction, which cuts down the time it takes to get straight into the science-fantasy action. Plus, more achievements! The re-released pilots includes a few more, bringing the total to 12. I won’t spoil them for you, but fewer than 1% of players have unlocked the “skitter hater” award.</p>
            
            <p>Simply say “Alexa, play Starfinder!” to check out the new goods. Don’t forget that anyone with a mobile device can download the Amazon Alexa app and play the voice-based game, too!</p>
            
            <p>And if this is the first you’re hearing about this project, check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh18?STARFINDER-TO-LAND-ON-AMAZON-ALEXA">details</a>!</p>
            
            <p>We’re prouder than a pack of helpful skittermanders at how well the pilot episode has been received so far. But don’t take my word for it—over on Amazon.com, the episode is rated on average 4.7 out of 5 stars, with more than 290 total reviews! One review states: “I am a new player to Starfinder and this app is such a great way to get familiar with the typical gameplay and is great fun too! I can’t wait for more!”</p>
            
            <p>As for the timing of the release of the voice game’s premium episodes, we don’t have news to share yet. The novel coronavirus is impacting our production schedule, but we’re working to realign it as fast as is responsibly possible. As soon as we have information to share on that front, we will!</p>
            
            <p>Until then, Alexa, let’s play some Starfinder!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, April 19, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

She darts past enemies like a shooting star in the night, spiriting herself away in the ship’s cargo hold. She steals her ride as easy as if she’d harnessed a runaway enercycle. The plot moves on.</p>
        
        <p>Except real life ain’t the holovids, and I’m no hero. My name is Rayuhl Rengott. Technically, I’m a thief. Also technically, I’m a murderer. That last one is patently false, but we’ll get to that later.</p>
        
        <p>I’m not beautiful or savvy, either. I hiss when I talk—and I don’t even have hair. I’m as bald as the dead landscape of my beloved homeworld. Unlike most of my fellow Eoxians, though, I’m very much alive.</p>
        
        <p>Yes, there are creatures on Eox other than just putrefied corpsefolk, skeletal bone troopers, and necrovite spellcasters. And we aren’t all Absalom Station’s most foolhardy traders or undead wannabes living in dystopian bubble cities.</p>
        
        <p>Some of us are living, breathing elebrians. Those long-skulled, dead-eyed, shrivel-skinned monsters you think of when you hear the name “Eox”? They were once us, except now they’re among the most powerful walking dead. And we are at their mercy.</p>
        
        <p>You seem confused. Fair enough. I’ll explain.</p>
        
        <p>Long, long before the Gap, a handful of elebrians survived our kin’s annihilation of the world. As second-class citizens, we’ve lived on our destroyed planet for untold generations ever since, passing flesh-and-blood legacies to our descendants. We try to keep the ravenous undead at bay for a half-dozen decades or so before we expire. We live only where our undead overlords deign to create hospitable environments for us. We perform the jobs they graciously hand out—if we’re lucky, it’s hard labor. If we’re not, we fight to the death for their amusement and profit in sick events streamed galaxy-wide from the Halls of the Living.</p>
        
        <p>Like I said, we’re at their mercy. For most of us, it’s the only way to stay alive.</p>
        
        <p>Which brings me to my current predicament. I’m peering out of the open cargo bay of this starship I hopped from Absalom Station. All around me are desolate hills, fossilized trees, miasmic eddies—you know, typical Dead Planet stuff. This is Eox, all right, but it’s not my beloved home city of the Pyre. Instead, it’s some desiccated place nearby, with the Pyre’s power-generating tower off in the hazy distance. </p>
        
        <p>And I’m staring right at the bone sage who issued my death-warrant—a destroy-on-sight, as I believe the Eoxian authorities call it—over high crimes of murder and theft from his personal palace.</p>

		<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/030820_Eox_WestonTJones.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/030820_Eox_WestonTJones.jpg" alt="" /></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Weston T. Jones</p></div>
        
        <p>Remember when I said I wasn’t savvy?</p>

 		<p>I thought I was stowing away on an AbadarCorp freighter bound for the loading docks of the Pyre. The plan was simple. I’d slip into the city, meet up with my old Redbloods crew, and help them pull a job big enough to buy a new life for all of us—one meant for the living!— on Absalom Station. They’d lined up the heist in the elite suites of the arcology, and I’d leveraged my Absalom connections. This job would buy me a whole new identity, and it would afford my friends enough credits to comfortably emigrate from this dead rock. Win-win.</p>
        
        <p>Except for that planet-blasted bone sage Kalantrodoch. He calls himself the Unburning. I call him the Bum-squirming. He’s a rabid zombified squox-rat if there ever was one. He also happens to rule the Pyre. And he’s the reason I had to flee Eox three years ago. </p>
        
        <p>Look, I was minding my own business—okay, okay, I had broken into Kalantrodoch’s sky-mansion. I planned to steal some ancient tech artifact the Redbloods had heard he’d smuggled in from Castrovel. I had the thing in my hot little hands, too. It looked like a small datapad, but it was made from a strange metal covered in Elven runes, and was meant to be strapped on the wrist or ankle.</p>
        
        <p>Just as I was ducking out of that awful place, I heard footsteps coming into the vault. I hid behind some technosafes, and I heard Kalantrodoch himself chatting in his horrifically sibilant voice to some of his cronies.</p>
        
        <p>“We’ll put it in the water,” the bone sage had said. “In a fortnight, our problem disa—”</p>
        
        <p>Whatever <em>that</em> meant. I didn’t hear the rest, because Kalantrodoch happened to walk past that particular technosafe at that particular time, and the jig was up. He would have caught me and likely thrown me into prison for life had I not had a vial of rotdust on me. I threw it in his face and he breathed in ground-up undead skin. Corpses hate that—they find it disgusting, on par with cannibalism. Go figure.</p>
      	
        <p>Anyway, it was just the distraction I needed to duck out of the vault. From there, I slinked out of the sky-mansion, and I promptly pawned the Castrovellian tech on the Station.</p>
        
        <p>That’s how I earned my death-warrant from Kalantrodoch the Unburning. Why he decided to tell the Pact that I murdered someone is beyond me. I guess he takes thefts from his personal home rather personally. Either way, it doesn’t matter, because ol’ Bum-squirming has made sure I can never safely return to Eox in my current identity. Hence the current plan. And my current predicament.</p>
        
        <p>Because I can tell that the bone sage I’m seeing is Kalantrodoch by his eyes, which do burn like some sort of unholy Asmodean forges. Why he’s out here in the gods-forsaken wastelands outside the Pyre is beyond me. And why he’s meeting an apparently legitimate Abadaran merchant is also a mystery. </p>
        
        <p>My best bet is to creep undetected around these cases of cargo—probably supplies for those monstrous necrovites in the arcology—and simply vanish. Then, I’ve just got to hope my environmental protections last long enough for me to hike the rest of the way to the Pyre. This job can still happen.</p>
        
        <p>I have to get dangerously close to Kalantrodoch as I pick my way around the ship’s perimeter, though. I see he’s got two corpsefolk cronies with him. Ugh, at least I don’t have to smell the stench of rotting flesh no doubt wafting up from them. Thanks to the tympanal cluster implants in my ears, I can even hear what they’re whispering to each other while they’re waiting for the Abadaran to review the cargo manifest.</p>
        
        <p>“That’s the crate,” Kalantrodoch says, nodding to one small, inconspicuous box. “Undetectable, and the scientists promised it’d work this time. They’ve learned much in three years.” </p>
        
        <p>I stop cold, heart racing. What is he saying?</p>
        
        <p>“We’re just weeks away from ten thousand fewer breathers.”</p>
        
        <p>I stifle a shocked gasp. What I heard three years ago suddenly makes sense.</p>
        
        <p><em>Our problem disappears. Ten thousand fewer breathers.</em></p>
        
        <p>Kalantrodoch is planning to wipe out most of the living elebrian population in the Pyre. With some sort of undetectable poison? I can only imagine the horrors he means to visit on my kind. Our numbers are well known, and for years the bone sage has subtly complained to Orphys that his living workers are a drain on resources. </p>
        
        <p>Looking around wildly, I assess the scene. There are stacks and stacks of crated goods—this is not a small shipment; Kalantrodoch is smuggling the highly illegal poison in with a vast array of legitimate goods. That’s probably why he’s meeting the Abadaran outside the city limits. </p>
        
        <p>I do see a rack near me with a few high-octane enercycles. I could take one of them and flee to the city. But they’re noisy, and the walking corpses would blast me away before I could get too far. And I’ve got to get to the city without heat on my trail, because I have to warn my friends.</p>
        
        <p>Desperately hoping to find anything that might help, I start quietly prying lids off crates. There’s one with a dozen second skin suits, one with assorted computer circuitry, and finally, one I can work with.</p>
        
        <p>A crate full of grenades.</p>
        
        <p>I’m going to have to time this perfectly if it’s going to work. Thinking quickly, I lash the open crate of grenades to the back of one of the bikes, then I grab another cycle. Standing between them like I’m leading two prize show shotalashus, I slowly walk the bikes around the perimeter of the site. </p>
        
        <p>I position myself just out of sight of the bone sage and the Abadaran. I’ll set one bike off riderless to distract them, I think. Then, when chaos reigns, I’ll ride in the opposite direction—toward Pyre—and none of them will be the wiser. The crate of grenades is mine, just in case I need any weapons once I slink into the city.</p>
        
        <p>It’s a great plan, I think, as I start up the enercycles’ engines as quietly as I can. Until I realize I’ve misjudged the bone sage and his cronies’ line of sight.</p>
        
        <p>“A breather!” one of the corpsefolk shouts, pointing in my direction. Both zombies pull out massive arc rifles and level them in my direction.</p>
        
        <p>Instinctively, I rev the boom-cycle’s engine. Yanking a grenade out, I pull the pin and drop it back into the crate. I let the boom-cycle fly toward the corpses and the Abadaran, and I hop on the other cycle, shooting toward the spire in the distance.</p>
        
        <p>The blast wave from the ensuing explosion nearly knocks me off balance. I can hear the shrieks of Kalantrodoch and his minions. I hear nothing from the Abadaran, and I can only hope that they survived.</p>
        
        <p>I did say I wasn’t a hero. </p>
        
        <p>A few minutes pass as I zoom along the shriveled Eoxian landscape toward the spire. When I dare to look back, it seems my plan didn’t sideline ol’ Bum-squirming for as long as I’d hoped. He’s racing behind me on a scorched enercycle, minions nowhere to be found, his long canines dripping with acidic saliva and his horrific, fiery eyes screaming with rage. </p>
        
        <p>“Rengott!” he shouts. </p>
        
        <p>Great. He knows it’s me. I kick the enercycle, bobbing and weaving, hoping I’ll be able to lose him.</p>
        
        <p>This could be an awkward homecoming. I’ve just got to make it to Pyre alive…</p>

  <h1>Characters of Near Space: Daytenna Flass</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2020-04-07T17:42:00Z">Apr 7, 2020, 10:42 am</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description"><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space">Starfinder Near Space</a></em> releases this month, and to show off some of the new character options available in the book, we present Daytenna Flass, an NPC witchwarper that you can use in your Starfinder campaigns. Among her many abilities, Daytenna utilizes an alternate damai racial trait, the mediator archetype, a new damai-themed witchwarper paradigm shift, and some new witchwarper spells, all from <em>Near Space</em>. While NPCs don’t normally use themes, we’ve given Daytenna the bureaucrat theme to give you a sneak peek at one of the new themes from the book as well. In addition, we offer a brief look at Daytenna’s home world, the colossi-infested Daimalko, which is fully detailed in <em>Near Space</em>.</p>

			<p>Special Abilities</p>
            <hr width=50%>
            <p><b>Brazen Bravado</b> Daytenna relies on her incredible force of personality and in-the-moment ingenuity to get herself out of scrapes, rather than on the survival skills common among her fellows. She gains a +2 racial bonus to Bluff and Sense Motive checks. When she aids another creature using either of these skills, the aid another bonus she provides increases to +3. This alternate racial trait replaces survivor.</p>
            <p><b>Bureaucrat Theme</b> Daytenna is a civil servant, operating within institutional boundaries to effect change and navigating the proper channels to find solutions, skills which serve her well in encounters with organizations across the galaxy. Bureaucrats gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma at character creation.</p>
            
            <p><b>Empathic Link</b> (Su) Mediators tap into an innate emotional and psychological understanding of others to act as efficient arbitrators between the innumerable species and civilizations of the galaxy. As a full action, Daytenna can touch up to two willing or unconscious creatures to create an empathic link between herself and the creatures touched. This link lasts for 1 hour or until she ends it for all creatures with a swift action. While linked, she and the linked creatures gain the effects of status in relation to one another. Whenever a linked creature fails a Will saving throw, a different linked creature can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to allow the affected creature to reroll the save; if the effect is an emotion or fear effect, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this reroll. An affected creature can reroll a given saving throw only once in this manner. Finally, once per day at the beginning of combat, each linked creature can swap their initiative result with that of any other linked creature within 60 feet.</p>
            
            <p><b>Expert in the Field</b> When Daytenna spends 10 minutes with a creature that knows about Daimalko’s war against the colossi that walk its surface, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus to her next attempted Diplomacy check to change that creature’s attitude or Intimidate check to bully that creature.</p>
            
            <p><b>Phantom Colossus (Su)</b> As a reaction, when a hostile creature within 100 feet would take any action to move 10 or more feet toward Daytenna or an ally, she can force it to witness an alternate reality in which a massive horror covered in tongues, teeth, and armored plates is bearing down toward it. The target creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will saving throw or it instead loses its action immediately as it is shocked into stillness, and it cannot voluntarily take any additional movement until the beginning of its next turn. Once an attacker has been affected by this paradigm shift, it can’t be targeted by it again for 24 hours. This is a fear effect.</p>
            
            <p>Daytenna Flass is a talent scout for the Guardians of Daimalko, who defend the planet’s inhabitants from the roving colossi that rampage across the planet’s surface with mystical orbs that allow them to psychically sense and subtly influence the monsters’ behavior. Now the hunt is on for brave warriors beyond Daimalko who might be willing to step into battle against these destructive giants by other, more traditional, methods. Daytenna travels Near Space and the Pact Worlds seeking soldiers, saboteurs, and assassins with the guts and experience necessary to face down terrifying horrors from beyond space and time… and she’s very, very persuasive.</p>
            
            <h3>DAIMALKO</h3>
            <p>Daimalko is a dry, blasted world orbiting a tiny star in Near Space, teeming with rampaging colossi and the struggling survivors of the damai species (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em> 2 32). Two hundred years ago, the planet’s oceans evaporated, its greenery withered, and earthquakes reverberated across the planet as nightmarish colossi—kyokors (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em> 72), tekenkis (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em> 3 108), and even stranger monstrosities—rose from the rocky terrain of the empty seabeds. The colossi destroyed the planet’s population centers, forcing the Daimalkans underground, but under the watchful eyes of the Guardians, people have begun returning to the planet’s surface for the first time in generations.</p>

           <p>If the implication from this totally-legitimate promotional text isn’t clear, allow me to elucidate: yes, Paizo is kicking off a new Starfinder actual play stream.</p>
           
           <p>And yes, it’s about amateur wrestling.</p>
           
           <p>To be more specific, on Wednesday, April 8, I’ll be GMing for some wonderfully accommodating Paizo folks, who each will be playing a PC moonlighting as an amateur, WWE-style wrestler. This stream follows the antics of the Pact Worlds-based league, XenoTrouble Wrestling Entertainment Matches (created specifically for this game!). Hence the name of the stream: X.T.R.E.M.!</p>
           
           <p>Although this league has specialized in small-time, rough-and-tumble wrestling matches in the past, Wednesday marks its first attempt at a big-time event, complete with a high-profile guest wrestler, fancy production values, and even a cameo from Zo!, the famed Eoxian media mogul. Of course, like any good Starfinder game, things are going to go awry, and quickly (but don’t tell the players!).</p>
           
           <p>Playing in the game are John Compton, Starfinder Senior Developer; Payton Smith, Social Media Producer; Jason Tondro, Starfinder Developer; and Andrew White, Front-End Engineering Lead.</p>
           
           <p>And oh boy, have they come up with a cast of characters for you. </p>
           
           <p>John’s embri biohacker, for example, is a masked luchador known in the ring as La Malscripcion, who saves lives as a doctor by day and cheats, taunts, and is a general heel to her opponents by night. </p>

           <p>Payton’s uplifted bear vanguard reveals only his moniker of Bear Drills, a reference to one of his devastating finishing moves. </p>

           <p>Jason’s kasatha solarion, Hieronomo Jones, always insists on a fair fight based on the four-fold path of truth, valor, honor, and peace—and each of these words is tattooed on a fist.</p>

           <p>Andrew’s dirindi witchwarper is a personal injury attorney by day and The Litigator by night, when his unitard that’s screen-printed with a suit and tie is often the last thing his opponents see before it’s lights out. </p>

           <p>I’ll avoid any more spoilers now and say only this: I can’t wait for you all to watch us play this game! So, on Wednesday from 2–5 p.m. PDT, come stop by the Paizo Twitch stream, say hi, and watch some weird Starfinder wrestling.</p>

                <p>Until Wednesday!</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, April 12, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catch <i>Court of Corvids</i> being hosted live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo’s Official Twitch Channel</a>, or directly on their channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queuetimes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>“Player types” is one of those perennial topics in games and game design, equally as likely to come up in discussion of everything from the first tabletop RPG to the latest AAA console title. Anyone who’s looked into any of the academic, professional, or hobby-level study of games and gaming is likely to have run across at least one attempt to analyze things from the player point of view. Whether it’s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types>Bartle’s Taxonomy</a>, lists of fantasy roleplaying archetypes, <a href=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes>3 well-known player psychographics</a>, or the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_theory>G/N/S model</a>, both gamers and game designers frequently revisit the (important!) idea that different parts of games are better for different kinds of game experiences. There are many examples of this in PACG, but few stand out as clearly as our awesome halfling helper, Lem.</p>
        
        <p>When we first put together characters for <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, we knew that we wanted Lem to be good at all sorts of things. As a bard, we wanted him to have a bunch of skills. Mike flat-out refused to let him out the door without Knowledge. Gaby wanted him to be charming and friendly, and Paul and I both wanted to make sure that he was good enough at a variety of things that he could choose to fill any gaps in your particular party. That said, he’s a halfling with a troubled history, so he clearly had some weaknesses. We gave him a large Knowledge bonus, made him a Charisma powerhouse to sometimes rival Seoni, and made sure he had a respectable starting point for Ranged weapons and both Arcane and Divine spellcasting. For his cards list, he has a good spread of card types, letting him dabble in any type while also giving him multiple choices for focus. A large hand size represents his inherent versatility as well as a relative fragility, and the option to get into either weapons or light armor means that he can make use of almost any card you find.</p>
        
        <p>For most people, though, Lem’s powers are really where he shines brightest. With a long list of skills and proficiencies, we knew that we’d need his powers to be relatively concise (a theory that I think we proved, the bad way, in Skull & Shackles). We wanted to emphasize his helpfulness and his versatility, so he got one power for each. The first lets him spend cards from his hand to help other nearby characters at <em>whatever they wanted to do</em>. This power has a cost—putting a card from your hand on the bottom of your deck—which helps make it an interesting choice. Over time, players are likely to realize that this “cost” is often a benefit: if you have cards in your hand that are useful some of the time, but just not right now, you can tuck them away for later use, opening up space to draw new cards without the increased risk of death that comes from just discarding at the end of your turn. </p>
        
        <p>The second power helps create the “just the thing!” moments, since it’s easy for him to swap out a “good, but not right now” card for an especially relevant card from his discard pile. These two powers together let Lem invest in a wide variety of cards, even cards with potentially niche utility. If you find that a particular card isn’t useful right now, you can recharge it to help (first power) or swap it for something more relevant in your discard pile (second power). There’s also an element of mastery at play here—once you get a good handle on the game, you realize that after Lem casts a spell, he might want to recharge it—and thus get it back for “free,” but not immediately. Or he might want to fail to recharge it, so he can swap another spell for it next turn. The latter approach costs him a “hit point” if he’s going to take damage, but it lets him have more control over when he has certain key cards in his hand.</p>

        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_RoRLemFront.png"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_RoRLemFront.png"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_RoRLemBack.png"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_RoRLemBack.png"/></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">His friends get by with a little—or a lot—of help from Lem.</p></div>
        
        <p>When we were putting together characters for <em>Skull & Shackles</em>, we knew we wanted to change things up a little. Ideally, the characters would feel recognizably themselves, but would also be changed by their experiences at sea. (If you’re familiar with Lem’s history, you probably understand that falling victim to a press gang is especially transformative for him!) While S&S was letting us swap in some new iconics, we all agreed we wanted to bring back Lem in some form: Swashbuckling Lem, Sea Captain Lem, Dread Pirate Lem.</p>
        
        <p>With that in mind, and with apparently wanton disregard for the extra pain we were dropping on the shoulders of the Paizo layout team (<em>To Sonia, Crystal, and Sarah: we apologize. Deeply. Again.</em>), we added Craft to Lem’s list of skills (enabling both Alchemy and ship repair) and gave him our new power for Finesse weapons. This new, tougher Lem swapped a spell out for a weapon, dropped hand size by one, and gained weapon proficiency. His “resourcefulness” power was reduced to let him get back recharged cards more quickly (by shuffling), and his “helping” power was increased to let it apply to himself. It’s still possible to build a super-helpful Lem, but now he can also be a bit more selfish if he wants.</p>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter">
        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_SSLemFront.png"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_SSLemFront.png"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_SSLemFront.png"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_SSLemBack.png"/></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">He <em>is</em> the very model of a modern major pirate lord!</p></div>
        
        <p>For his <em>Bard Class Deck</em> treatment, we wanted to change the focus again, so we looked more to the magical side of bardishness—but not bardiche-ness. (This also contrasted nicely with the other bards in that deck.) Class Deck Lem got a die bump to the top-end d12 Charisma, pushed his hand size back up to variety-and-fragility, and focused his powers more on spells. His helping power gained a new trick: if he used a Healing card to help others, he also got a little self-healing out of it; everybody wins!</p>

        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_CDBardLemFront.png"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_CDBardLemFront.png"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_CDBardLemBack.png"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_CDBardLemBack.png"/></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Bring the Boom <b> and</b> the Balm.</p></div>
        
        <p>Finally, we come to the new <em>Core Set</em>. We wanted to build a friendly, helpful, “classic” Lem, using our new templates and layout methods. The switch to a vertical layout let us add yet another skill to one of our skill-monkey characters without causing the designers so much pain (again, we’re sorry!); this let us give Lem Acrobatics out of the gate, which makes him seem more like the halfling he is, and also opens up some weapons options without requiring two lines of powers text. Adding Instrument proficiency lets us cleanly represent his facility without recourse to the clumsy “if you have the Bard or Skald trait” wording on each instrument. </p>
        
        <p>His Knowledge and spellcasting skills drop back down to “great” (from “outstanding”), and his first power lets him make up the difference when it counts most. His deck list spreads out evenly while giving him at least one weapon (you might choose a strong Acrobatics-based weapon, or one of Core’s new helpful weapons). Finally, his second power gives him back some of that resourcefulness while avoiding the potential repetitive play concerns I always drone on about, and also moves the processing to the end of the turn (while the next player is likely already starting).</p>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter">
        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterFront.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterBack.jpg"><img style="max-width:40%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032420_LemCharacterBack.jpg"/></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Snazzy new look, classic great flavor.</p></div>
        
        <p>Once you get a couple adventures under his belt, you can choose to focus in either <b>Busker</b> or <b>Poet Laureate</b>. Both roles are meant to reflect the performance aspects of Lem, with Busker offering access to some nifty street-performer tricks for getting by, especially in Urban settings (my favorite being “I’m afraid I cannot fight you… <em>but they can!</em>”). Poet Laureate leans more towards the occult power of Lem’s performances. Also, who doesn’t like drawing cards at the start of their turn?</p>

			<p itemprop="description">I wasn’t planning to hit you with a weekly update when I started these, but things keep changing so quickly and new information is reaching us almost daily, that I felt that you needed an update, especially with our new April products scheduled to release in a few weeks.</p>
            
            <p>As many of you are probably aware, various shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the world have left many brick and mortar hobby game stores and bookstores closed for an indefinite period of time. Some stores are still open, while others have pivoted to online sales, doing curbside pick-up, or even hand-delivering game products to customer’s homes! If your local stores are finding creative ways to get our products into your hands, please support them in these tough times!</p>
            
            <p>However, the temporary shutdown of many of these stores, as well as local shutdowns of nonessential businesses, has forced most of our distribution partners to close their operations temporarily. This means that most won’t be ordering our new releases when they come out at the end of April unless things improve before then. For the last three weeks, Amazon has stopped all restocks of nonessential items to give their warehouses the opportunity to provide their customers with essential products to get through this pandemic. To complicate matters, even when Amazon starts restocking our products, the distributor which sells to them for us has been shut down for who knows how long.</p>
            
            <p>The long and short of all of this is that it may be difficult for you to find our new products while traditional distribution is mostly shut down. We are hopeful about being able to open up our warehouse to start shipping products in a week or two if the local situation continues to improve as it has lately (all while practicing safe social distancing). So with a bit of luck, we will be shipping all orders of new product in the second half of April, both for orders you placed through paizo.com and for distributors and retailers that remain open. Hobby game stores can also buy directly from us by registering their store at <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/retailers">Paizo.com/retailers</a>.</p>
            
            <p>If you are interested in any of our new April products, then please reach out to your local hobby game store to see if they will be stocking them. Paizo ships our e-commerce all over the world, so if we are open to ship, then that is also an option for you. And finally, for those that are interested in PDF versions of our April releases, those should be available at the end of the month as usual.</p>

            <p>Also, a huge thank you from our team to the community for their patience and understanding.  As we scattered to the winds and socially distanced ourselves, we found everything taking more time and more energy.  From getting remote offices set up to putting together this month’s scenario releases, it all was a bit wonky. We thank our community for coming together, helping each other, and supporting our hobby.  You are awesome!</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, not all of our community avoided their encounter or rolled a success on their fortitude save. We have several community members, and adjacent community members, who are dealing with the disease.  Please keep them in your thoughts!

			<h3>Sanctioning</h3>
			<p>We have no sanctioning in the pipeline this month, as the transition to work-from-home put some wrinkles in our plans.</p>
            
            <h3>Achievement Points</h3>
            <p>This month, our tech team was forced to shift focus for several weeks as they ensured we all had the equipment necessary to work from home in the fact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As we finish settling into this new way of doing business, we are hopeful that their attention will be able to move back to getting this system up and running.</p>
            
            <h3>Campaign Coins</h3>
            <p>With no travel to conventions, we awarded no coins in the past month. As conventions continue to cancel, alternative awarding methods will be devised so we don’t have a prolonged gap in recognizing the communities’ volunteers.</p>
            
            <h3>Stars, Novas & Glyphs</h3>
            <p>The move to virtual games slowed some of the GM achievement progress. Thus, we have no new five-nova or five-star GMs this month.</p>
            <p>Several of our community noted that they’ve seen their stars/novas disappear in different parts of the forums.  This is due to our continual upgrade to the website and splitting of how the site accesses data.  We’d ask for our GMs not to worry. The data remains in the database and we will re-hook in all the items as we get the new pages established.</p>
            
            <h3>Venture-Officers</h3>
            <p>Over the past month, one of our primary tasks has been updating the venture officer rosters so that everybody has access to the scenarios they need to run games. We are fast approaching the point where the system will be fully updated! At this point, all but one region’s current rostered venture-officers should have received emails.  If you are volunteering and have not received an email, please contact your regional venture-coordinator. Their contact information appears <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/organized-play-regions/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>Charity Boons</h3>
            <p>Early in the month, we sent out all outstanding charity boons to their respective owners.  Anybody whose information had been submitted should have received theirs by now!  If you have not, check with the convention’s event organizer and confirm they submitted your info. If you aren’t sure who the organizer was, send an email to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> and we will help you get records updated.</p>
            
            <h3>Online Resources</h3>
            <p>In the face of the current pandemic, our online venture-officers have stepped up and done a tremendous job of getting the rest of us up and running with online play.  Our VTT and PBP communities are now larger than ever!  They’ve shared a number of resources with all of us, as detailed in two blog posts last week. Here are links to <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5u?Guest-Blog-Online-Region-Resources-part-1">part 1</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5z">part 2</a> of the blog.</p>
            <p>Be sure to check Warhorn, local meetups, and other community pages for online games supported by local lodges.</p>

            <h3>Premier Conventions</h3>
            <p>As we announced last week, PaizoCon2020 has been cancelled; see the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5y?PaizoCon-2020-Cancelled">announcement here</a> for more details on refunds and rolling over tickets.  UK Game Expo has been postponed until August 21-23, 2020.  Origins posted their intention to announce a decision on or before May 1.  At this time, Gen Con continues as planned, though the convention aims to assess the situation closer to the show dates.  We look forward to seeing you all when conventions resume!</p>

            <p>Check back next week for more Society news!</p>
                
			<p>Until then – stay safe and Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

                <p><b>Starfinder Against the Aeon Throne AP 1: The Reach of Empire</b></p>
                
                <p>This first adventure path sends you to a fog-shrouded world in the Vast, where you will soon discover that a small military force from the Azlanti Star Empire has invaded and occupied the Pact Worlds colony there. Will you be able to liberate the settlement from its merciless oppressors?</p>
                
                <p>“I was really honored to write the first volume of the Against the Aeon Throne AP. I wanted to give a real “rebels against a powerful invading force” vibe, so I focused on encounters about getting to know the beleaguered locals, making strikes against the oppressors, and finally freeing the planet from their evil influence.” - Author Ron Lundeen</p>

                <p>A cacaodaemon appears at first glance to be an ordinary cacao pod, burnt-red in color and shaped like a football. But don’t let the promise of a sweet treat fool you—what looks like a crack in the rind is really a hideous maw filled with dozens of craggy, brown nib teeth. However, when extracted and roasted, the teeth are actually quite delicious.</p><hr width="50%">

                <p>In response to the Gap, a cosmic event that erased memories and records across the planes, the multiverse reflexively attempted to rectify the countless paradoxes and uncertainties like a blind surgeon stapling flesh. Among the results were skittergoblins, amalgams of several impetuously innovative humanoids that combine goblins’ destructive curiosity with skittermanders’ compulsive drive to help out. The boldest of these creatures (known as deckcutters) haplessly learn how to bridge time and space, tumbling through infinite realities where even the underlying multiverse’s mechanics vary wildly—and in rare cases drawing bystanders into these alien realms.</p>

Instead of these attacks taking a –4 penalty, the first attack takes a –2 penalty, the second attack takes a –4 penalty, and the third attack takes a –6 penalty. If the skittergoblin has another ability that allows them to make three or more attacks, the skittergoblin takes reduces the attack penalties for three-action gambit by 1.</p>

                <p>Few phenomena are as feared as the deadly squirrelwind. The exact nature of squirrelwinds is a subject of some debate; many scholars believe they are intentionally created by vengeful druids, while others believe they are a bizarre but natural phenomenon created when a tornado touches down in an area rich in both magical energy and heavily populated in squirrels. Despite their deadly and destructive nature and reputation, squirrelwinds are responsible for surprisingly few casualties outside of plants and wildlife, as their chittering can be heard for miles around. </p>

When a group of indecisive adventurers reaches a culinary crossroads and can't decide which tavern to peruse for post-dungeon drinks, a weredigo is destined to appear and put these foolish foodies out of their misery.
