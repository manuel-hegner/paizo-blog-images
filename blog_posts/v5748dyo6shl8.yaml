  \ and Heritages</h3> \n     <p>The first half of the book provides an in-depth look\
  \ at ancestries and versatile heritages that premiered in previous book. Each entry\
  \ presents information on how each ancestry or heritage fits in the Lost Omens setting\
  \ as well as provide new ancestry feats, heritages, and lineages. The section includes\
  \ the following entries.</p> \n     <p><b>Aasimar (Calder CaDavid):</b> Aasimars\
  \ result from celestial influence, but only rarely are they literally descended\
  \ from celestials, more often coming from special blessings or the residual energies\
  \ in holy places. This book presents three new lineages, emberkin, idyllkin, and\
  \ plumekith, for aasimars descended from peris, agathions, and garudas respectively.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Azarketi (Jessica Catalan):</b> Often known as “gillmen” or “Low\
  \ Azlanti,” azarketis are the descendants of the Azlanti Empire. They survived Earthfall\
  \ by being mutated by their foes, the alghollthus, to become an aquatic people tied\
  \ forever to seas and waterways—but their history draws them back to the land. This\
  \ book presents new azarketi options, exploring their magical connection to water\
  \ and adds the inured, murkeyed, spined, and tactile azarketi heritages.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Check out the Azarketi ancestry today with this <a href=\"https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Azarketi+Ancestry.pdf\"\
  >pdf download</a>!</p> \n     <p><b>Catfolk (David N. Ross):</b> Native to the nation\
  \ of Murraseth in southern Garund, catfolk are feline humanoids who believe they\
  \ were created to hunt down threats to Golarion as a whole. This book presents new\
  \ options to double down on catfolk’s agility and luck and adds the flexible, liminal,\
  \ and sharp-eared catfolk heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Changeling (Isabelle Thorne):</b>\
  \ The offspring of wicked hags, changelings are often left in the cradles of their\
  \ mortal parent’s people and raised without understanding what makes them different.\
  \ They often feel disconnected from their communities early in life, the subtle\
  \ call of their hag mother coaxing them to abandon those they love. This book presents\
  \ the moon may, snow may, veil may, and virga may lineages for changelings descended\
  \ from moon hags, winter hags, blood hags, and storm hags respectively.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Dhampir (Lyz Liddell):</b> Dhampirs are mortals descended from a living\
  \ and a vampiric parent. Marked forever by their hungers, some may learn to draw\
  \ strength from the blood of others, while others drink subtler substances, such\
  \ as pain. This book presents three new lineages, adhyabhau, cel rau, and ru-shi,\
  \ for dhampirs descended from psychic, strigoi, and jiang-shi vampires.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Duskwalker (Mikhail Rekun):</b> Reincarnated souls, duskwalkers gained\
  \ leave to have one more chance at life. All duskwalkers have strong connections\
  \ to their previous identities, but each must decide for themselves whether to learn\
  \ more about their past or forge a new path. This book contains options for duskwalkers\
  \ based on how their previous life ended.</p> \n     <p><b>Hobgoblin (Owen K.C.\
  \ Stephens):</b> Many hobgoblins have been drawn toward the nation of Oprak, which\
  \ seeks to forge pacts and earn respect through methods other than war and conquest.\
  \ While clearly related to their goblin cousins, hobgoblins are less frenetic and\
  \ more careful planners. This book contains options for hobgoblins to assist their\
  \ fellow warriors or to tap into the legendary Cantorian Spring—the source of the\
  \ hobgoblin ancestry—to gain healing effects. It also introduces the shortshanks\
  \ and steelskin hobgoblin heritages.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c1266455-b649-4567-b8ee-bb277569c79b/022421_cactusleshy.jpg\"\

  \ living cactus is squat and spherical with a small flower on the top of its head.\"\
  ></a>\n     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Art by Alex Stone</p> \n     <p><b>Kobold\
  \ (Owen K.C. Stephens):</b> These expert trap makers often live in secluded places\
  \ that most other ancestries eschew. Kobolds operate in a world of larger, stronger\
  \ creatures who often dismiss them—until these cunning survivors reveal what they\
  \ can unleash on their foes. This book contains options for kobolds to improve their\
  \ use of traps and kobold weapons, and even to grow draconic wings. It also includes\
  \ the caveclimber and tunnelflood kobold heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Leshy (Linda\
  \ Zayas-Palmer):</b> Leshys are immortal spirits temporarily given mortal forms\
  \ in bodies made of plants and fungi. Created by powerful primal rituals, leshys\
  \ come into the world fully formed and self-sufficient, independent of any settlement\
  \ or even the ritualist that gave them form. This book grows the leshy options by\
  \ adding the cactus, fruit, lotus, root, and seaweed leshy heritages.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Lizardfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</b> The powerful reptilian lizardfolk call\
  \ themselves iruxi and have a history that stretches back thousands of years. Patient\
  \ and confident, lizardfolk explorers travel from their ancient nations to explore\
  \ the world of younger ancestries and kingdoms. This book contains options for lizardfolk\
  \ to gain insights from astrology or power from the bones of their ancestors and\
  \ adds the cloudleaper and woodstalker lizardfolk heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Orc\
  \ (Calder CaDavid):</b> Orcs were driven from their homelands by the dwarven Quest\
  \ for Sky and thrust into a foreign world where they had to carve a place for themselves.\
  \ A troubled history of warfare and grudges has left most orcs at odds with other\
  \ surface ancestries. This book contains options for orcs to gain power from special\
  \ painted warmasks. It also introduces the battle-ready, grave, and winter orc heritages.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Ratfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</b> Small rodentlike humanoids, ratfolk\
  \ are clever, adaptive, and communalist. Known amongst themselves as ysoki, ratfolk\
  \ are natural explorers, travelers, and, most of all, merchants. This book contains\
  \ options for ratfolk to squish, sneak, roll, and otherwise move about. It also\
  \ adds the snow and tunnel rat heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Tengu (Eleanor Ferron):</b>\
  \ The beaked and feathered tengu originate from Tian Xia. Nearly always in the minority,\
  \ tengu have learned to use their knack for languages and blades to find space for\
  \ themselves. This book contains options for tengu to store magic in specially made\
  \ fans and adds the dogtooth and wavediver tengu heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Tiefling\
  \ (Mikhail Rekun):</b> Tieflings are planar scions born with a fiendish stain in\
  \ their blood. Though tieflings are not inherently evil, they are often mistrusted\
  \ and many do find that fiendish powers and associated temptations come easily.\
  \ This book presents the beastbrood, riftmarked, and shackleborn lineages for tieflings\
  \ descended from rakshasas, qlippoths, and velstracs respectively.</p> <a href=\"\

  \ Scavariello</p> \n     <h3>New Ancestries and Heritages</h3> \n     <p>The latter\
  \ half of the book introduces new ancestries and heritages to Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition. Some of these entries include old favorites making their second edition\
  \ premiere and even includes some brand new entries, each with their own rules options.\
  \ The section includes the following entries.</p> \n     <p><b>Android (Jessica\
  \ Catalan):</b> Brought to Golarion by a starship crash in the land of Numeria,\
  \ androids are half organic, half-machine lifeforms produced by alien technology.\
  \ Though often looked upon with fear by superstitious communities surrounding the\
  \ crash site, changing politics and the rise of the android goddess Casandalee have\
  \ led to androids expanding their influence in nearby regions. The section includes\
  \ feats that allow androids to tap into the power of their nanites and the artisan,\
  \ impersonator, laborer, polyglot, and warrior android heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Aphorite\
  \ (Andrew Mullen):</b> Aphorites are beings with a mortal base infused with the\
  \ pure essence of law by the enigmatic axiomites of Axis. Originally designed to\
  \ form a diplomatic bridge between the perfect logic of the axiomites and the constant\
  \ contradictions of free-willed creatures, aphorites’ ability to choose has seen\
  \ them grow beyond their original intent and into their own people. This versatile\
  \ heritage allows a character use the crystalline motes that cover their body to\
  \ conceal themselves or their allies.</p> \n     <p><b>Beastkin (Luis Loza):</b>\
  \ While most werecreatures are cursed with bloodlust at the sight of the full moon,\
  \ some of their kin are born without this dire affliction. These beastkin are a\
  \ source of respect and envy among their fellows, as they also lack werecreatures’\
  \ burning vulnerability to silver. This versatile heritage allows for characters\
  \ with a connection of animals of any type that can tap into their animalistic instincts\
  \ and senses.</p> \n     <p><b>Fetchling (Andrew Mullen):</b> Fetchlings are scions\
  \ of Ancient Azlant who escaped the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing to the Shadow\
  \ Plane. As generations passed, more and more supernatural gloom seeped into these\
  \ refugees until they evolved into something beyond their human origins. Fetchlings\
  \ can gain control over their shadows and are shaped by the bright, deep, liminal,\
  \ resolute, and wisp fetchling heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Fleshwarp (Ron Lundeen):</b>\
  \ Fleshwarps are beings transformed either by magic or by technology beyond Golarion’\
  s ken. Most commonly, they result from drow or other sinister forces transforming\
  \ their victims out of sadism, yet fleshwarps can also be created from scratch through\
  \ magical or alchemical manipulation of raw tissue. Fleshwarps are capable of transforming\
  \ their bodies further to gain darkvision or grow new weapons. Depending on the\
  \ nature of their transformation, a fleshwarp will have the created, mutated, shapewrought,\
  \ or technological fleshwarp heritage.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/832395d7-dd45-495d-ba1f-4bbc1b2669fc/022421_eaglekin.jpg\"\

  \ align=\"left\" width=\"300\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"An eaglekin. This\
  \ humanoid has the head and wings of an eagle. They are clad in mage’s robes and\
  \ are producing a magical flame in their hands.\"></a>\n     <p style=\"font-size:\
  \ 13px;\">Art by Rashad Pozdnyakov</p> \n     <p><b>Ganzi (Isabelle Thorne):</b>\
  \ Born wherever and whenever they’re least expected, these scions of chaos rarely\
  \ conform to any overarching culture among themselves. Ganzi reside in the greatest\
  \ numbers in the nation of Holomog, with their influence spilling out into Nex,\
  \ Geb, and the Mwangi Expanse. The ganzi versatile heritage allows characters to\
  \ tap into the power of chaos and produce random magic or new body parts.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Geniekin (Jessica Redekop):</b> Kin to the elements and infused with\
  \ the power of the planes within the Inner Sphere, geniekin live scattered all over\
  \ the world, especially wherever extreme environments provide a conduit to primal\
  \ energy. Most commonly found in Katapesh and Qadira, many geniekin gather in small\
  \ communities both within and outside of major cities. Geniekin include five new\
  \ versatile heritages: ifrits, keepers of elemental fire; oreads, wardens of elemental\
  \ earth; sylphs, followers of the freedom of elemental air; undines, individuals\
  \ adaptable like elemental water; and sulis, embodiments of the complex relationships\
  \ between multiple elements.</p> \n     <p><b>Kitsune (James Case):</b> Kitsune\
  \ change shapes as easily as clothing, often living undetected among other peoples.\
  \ Though these mischievous tricksters almost never gather in numbers large enough\
  \ for political clout, their natural charisma and cunning mean they can have a significant\
  \ impact on worldly events. Kitune are wielders of powerful magic and have the celestial\
  \ envoy, dark fields, earthly wilds, empty sky, and frozen wind kitsune heritages.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Sprite (Mark Seifter):</b> As denizens of the First World, sprites\
  \ sometimes tire of their realm where choices hold no permanence and consequences\
  \ don’t matter. These Tiny fey venture into the Material Plane in hopes of making\
  \ their own mark. Sprites can empower their wings to grant them flight and sprite\
  \ heritages vary to include draxies, grigs, luminous sprites, melixies, nykterasm,\
  \ and pixies.</p> \n     <p><b>Strix (Samantha Phelan):</b> These avian humanoids\
  \ maintain small populations within Cheliax and the surrounding environs. Long persecuted\
  \ by the humanocentric rule of House Thrune, strix have been enemies of the Chelaxian\
  \ state for almost a century. This section provides feats that allow strix to take\
  \ to the skies and attack with their wings, as well as the nightglider, predator,\
  \ scavenger, shoreline, and songbird strix heritages.</p> \n     <p><b>Ancestral\
  \ Gear (Luis Loza):</b> The book’s final section provides new weapons and magic\
  \ items with ties to the ancestries of Golarion.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
