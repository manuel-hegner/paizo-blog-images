  date\">Friday, August 21, 2009</p> \n   <p>With the release of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</i></a>, there are a lot of new faces\
  \ here on the board, so we thought that this would be a good time to say hello and\
  \ to give folks a quick tour of the site.</p> \n   <p>I suspect that many of the\
  \ new folks are here because of the Pathfinder RPG, so there is no better place\
  \ to start than our new <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>.\
  \ Of course, we have much more in store for this game, so you definitely want to\
  \ visit the <a href=\"pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder RPG main page</a> where you can\
  \ see a summary of all of our upcoming products. Be sure to check out the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy89m5\"><i>Bestiary Preview</i></a> and the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy89m6\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Conversion Guide</i></a>, both of which can be downloaded for\
  \ free. All you need is an account. Tip to the wise, make sure you have the most\
  \ recent version of Adobe Reader installed on your machine to read these pdfs. Both\
  \ of these free products, along with a host of other valuable free documents, can\
  \ also be found on the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/resources\">Pathfinder RPG resources\
  \ page</a>, which also contains our <a href=\"/paizo/about/communityuse\">community\
  \ use policy</a> (for those thinking about setting up a fan website) and the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/compatibility\">compatibility license</a> (for those planning\
  \ to make products using the Pathfinder RPG rules). The resources page also has\
  \ the most recent errata document for the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, which contains a\
  \ number of small changes and fixes to ensure that your game is running smoothly.</p>\
  \ \n   <p></p>Next up, if you need to quickly reference the Pathfinder RPG online,\
  \ there is no better resource than the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/\">Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game Reference Document</a> (or PRD for short). The PRD contains all\
  \ of the rules from the game, organized just like the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, making\
  \ them easy to find. If you are playing your game in reach of a computer, I might\
  \ recommend a bookmark or three.\n   <p></p> \n   <p>We really want <b>paizo.com</b>\
  \ to be a great community for gamers of all stripes, whether your passion is the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG, other RPGs, board games, card games, or anything in between. Our\
  \ messageboards are home to thousands of gamers just like you, looking for advice,\
  \ sharing stories, forming groups, and getting answers to rules questions. If you\
  \ are navigating the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards\">messageboards</a>, look out\
  \ for the following forums.</p> \n   <p>First up is the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG\"\
  ><b>Pathfinder RPG messageboard</b></a>, which includes a large number of useful\
  \ forums. The <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/general\"\
  ><b>General Discussion Forum</b></a> is where you can discuss nearly anything related\
  \ to the game, from reviews to announcements. The <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/rules\"\
  ><b>Rules Question Forum</b></a> is where you can ask questions about the game.\
  \ If one of your fellow fans does not help you out, one of our staff will try to\
  \ help get an answer to your question. There is a lot of great discussion going\
  \ on right now on the boards about the game, but I do want to take this moment to\
  \ offer some advice. The rules are brand new, and there is a lot of information\
  \ to digest. Before posting, make sure to take a good look through the book to see\
  \ if your question is answered elsewhere. Since the game is a revision to the 3.5\
  \ rules, there are a number of discussions going on right now comparing the two\
  \ and weighing the pros and cons of each change. While this is only natural, I do\
  \ want to remind folks that many of these changes are designed to have a specific\
  \ effect or to work in combination with other changes, making the whole of the game\
  \ easier and better to run. If the rule in question still doesn't work for your\
  \ group, do not hesitate to change it. It is your game after all, and you should\
  \ feel free to change it in any way that would add to the fun and excitement of\
  \ your campaign. Alright, back to the tour. </p> \n   <p>Next up in the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG section is the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/products\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Products Section</a>, which includes two forums for discussing individual\
  \ products. One for Paizo products and one for any 3rd party product that is compatible\
  \ with the game. After those forums are the Community Content forums. The first\
  \ of these is the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/communityContent/houseRules\"\
  ><b>House Rules Forum</b></a>, which contains a host of tips, tricks, and suggestions\
  \ used in the games of fellow messageboard members. This forum also includes brand\
  \ new rules content created by fans. The second forum is the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/communityContent/conversions\"\
  ><b>Conversions Forum</b></a>, which contains fan-made conversions of a host of\
  \ 3.5 rules and products, making them easier to use with the Pathfinder RPG.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In addition to the Pathfinder RPG forums, you will find an array of other\
  \ forums for our other products. The <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/general\"\
  ><b>Pathfinder General Discussion Forum</b></a> is for talking about any product\
  \ with the Pathfinder logo, focusing on products that are compatible with the Pathfinder\
  \ campaign setting (such as the <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles\"\
  >Pathfinder Chronicles</a>, <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion\"\
  >Pathfinder Companion</a>, <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinder/pathfinderModules\"\
  >Pathfinder Modules</a>, and <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinder/pathfinderAccessories\"\
  >Pathfinder Accessories</a> products). The <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventurePath\"\
  ><b>Pathfinder Adventure Path Section</b></a> contains a forum for each one of our\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Adventure Paths</a>. These products represent\
  \ complete campaigns, taking your characters from 1st level to the heights of power.\
  \ The forums contain tips, tricks, and tools to use for each Adventure Path, as\
  \ well as a number of great stories and anecdotes from the campaigns of fellow members.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This is also a good time to talk about the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a>. This program allows you to play the Pathfinder RPG around\
  \ the world, using the same character for each event. Pathfinder Society events\
  \ can be found at most major conventions and in a number of game stores. In addition,\
  \ your GM can download these PDF adventures and run them for you at home. For discussion\
  \ about these exciting events, check out the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety\"\
  ><b>Pathfinder Society Forums.</b></a></p> \n   <p>Concluding our tour of the messageboards,\
  \ you might want to investigate the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/community\"><b>Paizo\
  \ Community Forums</b></a>, which includes forums for 3.5, 4th edition, board games,\
  \ card games, play-by-post games, movies, books, television, and the always busy\
  \ off-topic discussion (drive up your post count with a 3-word game today!).</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Before this blog gets way too long, I want to take a moment to talk about\
  \ the <a href=\"/store\">Paizo Store</a>, which features just about every RPG, board\
  \ game, card game, miniatures game, and accessory known to man. Be warned, there\
  \ are a lot of good products hiding in there, and my wallet has paid for my curiosity\
  \ mightily over the years.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
