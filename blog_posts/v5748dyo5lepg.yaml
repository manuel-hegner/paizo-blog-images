  \ symbol of my dominance.\n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Greetings!\
  \ I am Aslan. Cassidy (Mom) told me she introduced herself to all of you, but I\
  \ was far more popular than she could ever hope to be. Considering she's one of\
  \ my subjects, I think this is only fitting.</span></p> \n    <p>Mom brought me\
  \ home earlier this year. All she was looking for when she walked into the pet store\
  \ was a puppy fix, but per my previous brainwashing of the pet store staff, they\
  \ put me in her arms instead. That she could be easily manipulated was immediately\
  \ obvious. I pretended to be a loving, docile creature like all the other rabbits\
  \ and ten minutes later, we were en route to my new domain.</p> \n    <p>Once we\
  \ arrived, I put my master plan into action, transforming a previously unsophisticated\
  \ realm into the grand kingdom of Livingroom. I used my powers of persuasion and\
  \ adorably fluffy ears to secure my influence over Mom and her fianc√© (Dad). I arranged\
  \ for daily tribute deliveries of pellets, hay, and leafy greens. A castle was built\
  \ in my honor. Cassidy's mother, who has become a powerful ally and my Grand Minion,\
  \ intervened during my castle's construction to insist I be given a turret. While\
  \ I was initially annoyed at her presumption, the turret has become one the most\
  \ important pillars of my rule as it allows me survey my domain. Grand Minion will\
  \ be spared my wrath.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20130427-Aslan2_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\">\n     <br> Chew Toy Dragon is defeated!\n    </div> \n    <p>After\
  \ ensuring my own kingdom's stability and training my minions to see to its day-to-day\
  \ administration, I set forth to forge relations with a neighboring realm. Random,\
  \ their dignitary, traveled from the far-off land of Duvall to meet with me. (Between\
  \ you and me, he's the funniest-looking rabbit I've ever met.) After establishing\
  \ both trade and security treaties, we cemented our bond by joining forces to purge\
  \ Livingroom of its greatest threat: Chew Toy Dragon. Together, we defeated the\
  \ abomination, stripping it of its teeth and forcing it to pledge its fealty to\
  \ us.</p> \n    <p>Currently, I'm working on my greatest challenge yet: communicating\
  \ my insatiable need for carrots and raisins to Mom and Dad. Though they seem earnest\
  \ in their attempts to please me and provide me with these items on occasion, I\
  \ am beginning to suspect they are taking directives from The Vet, self-appointed\
  \ court dietician and my greatest enemy. Despite my suspicions, I will allow Mom\
  \ and Dad to remain in my kingdom... for now. In the meantime, I will lurk in my\
  \ castle, plotting new conquests and my next campaign with Random.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ next time, loyal subjects.</p> \n    <p>Aslan<br> <i>Emperor of Livingroom<br>\
  \ Nibbler of Dragons<br> Lord and Master of all He Surveys</i></p> \n   </div> \n\
