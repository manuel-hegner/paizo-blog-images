  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">A few blogs ago, I mentioned some upcoming\
  \ plans for <a href=\"http://extra-life.org\" target=\"_blank\">Extra Life Charity</a>\
  \ involving Pathfinder Society. Well, we went a little bigger than originally planned!\
  \ This Saturday, November 5th, Paizo will be teaming up with Dead Gentlemen/Zombie\
  \ Orpheous Entertainment as <a href=\"http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=28528\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Team Zodgepodge</a> to participate in Extra Life's Game Day\
  \ 2016. Streaming live from Zulu's Board Game Café in Bothell, three Pazionians\
  \ and three ZOEs will face a tag-team of 5-Star Pathfinder Society GMs out to cause\
  \ mayhem and madness.</p> \n     <p>Why Extra Life? According to their website,\
  \ \"Extra Life unites thousands of players around the world in a 24 hour gaming\
  \ marathon to support Children's Miracle Network (CMN) Hospitals. Since its inception\
  \ in 2008, Extra Life has raised more than $22 million for local CMN Hospitals.\"\
  \ Each of us involved has a reason for wanting to support the Extra Life organization.\
  \ Check out our Extra Life pages for our stories. But in the end, we get to play\
  \ games, have fun, and support kids. What could be better? </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20161031-ExtraLife_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Under the guidance of Jennifer Hilmo and her team of techs,\
  \ our six stalwart players face trials and tribulations in a custom adventure by\
  \ Daniel Ward. Set in the world of Journey Quest &amp; The Gamers, the adventure\
  \ utilizes Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules. The live feed event starts Saturday,\
  \ November 5th, at 8:00 AM Pacific Time and runs until 8:00 PM Pacific time. The\
  \ stream will be available on <a href=\"https://m.twitch.tv/thyssyk\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Technician Thyssyk's Twitch channel</a>.</p> \n     <p>Playing for Paizo\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Developer Amanda Hamon-Kunz</a>. From the ZOE side are <a href=\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Matt Vancil</a>. These six stalwarts must survive shenanigans\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Venture-Lieutenant Louis Manko Levite</a>.</p> \n     <p>But,\
  \ there is a twist! There is always a twist! Log onto the <a href=\"http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=28528\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Team Zodgepodge Extra Life page</a>, select a team member, make\
  \ a donation, and choose a way to mix it up in the world. Want to add some bonuses?\
  \ Take away some modifiers? Make them reroll their save? Again? And Again? And Again?\
  \ You can do that. The power is in the viewer's hands!</p> \n     <p>If you want\
  \ to make life more interesting for our players, consider donating to our GMs for\
  \ increased pandemonium! Donations direct to players will assist them in game. After\
  \ the first $100 in donations, the players unlock a companion to journey with them.\
  \ Make a donation of $20 to Jason Buhlman and he will play a character of the donor's\
  \ creation. So bring on the crazy, the zany, and the kooky and watch our lead designer\
  \ breathe life into them. Enjoyed a campaign setting? Donate to Amanda and give\
  \ her a bonus power from one of the books she brought to life! Are you a fan of\
  \ the increased social encounter in Pathfinder Society? Donate to John and help\
  \ him succeed at the skill based challenges! Stumped for ideas? Check out <a href=\"\
  https://m.twitch.tv/thyssyk\" target=\"_blank\">Technician Thyssyk's Twitch channel</a>\
  \ for a list of possibilities.</p> \n     <p>From the main <a href=\"http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=28528\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Team Page</a>, you can click on the Roster title and get to\
  \ any team member page. Click the donate button and follow the steps. Use the comment\
  \ section of the donation to note the effect you wish your donation to have on the\
  \ game, if any. The donations go straight to Extra Life—they get 100% of monies\
  \ raised—and are potentially tax-deductible (talk to your tax advisor).</p> \n \
  \    <p>Zulu's Board Game Café, our hosts for the event, are staying open 24 hours\
  \ in support of Extra Life. Besides the streamed game, they have space for anyone\
  \ wishing to come out and play. Come join us with your favorite game or borrow one\
  \ of theirs!</p> \n     <p>But Team Zodgepodge isn’t the only Pathfinder participation\
  \ in Extra Life. This Friday, I travel to Spokane, Washignton, to participate in\
  \ their Extra Life II convention. I’m running the retired adventure \"Eye of the\
  \ Crocodile King\" as a charity game. We are raffling seats at the table, so if\
  \ you are in Spokane consider stopping by! If you can’t make it to Spokane, but\
  \ want me to spice things up a bit for the players, donate to my Extra Life page\
  \ and I’ll give the characters a run for their money!</p> \n     <p>Other Extra\
  \ Life events are going on as well! In Boise, Venture-Captain Ebee Roper is helming\
  \ Extra Life 24 Hr Gaming. Last weekend, Cary, NC, played host to Extra Life 3:\
  \ Revenge of the GM. In addition, many of our players are participating in other\
  \ events or direct from their homes via online games. Where are you playing this\
  \ weekend?</p> \n     <p>To all players supporting Extra Life, I thank you for your\
  \ generosity.</p> \n     <p>Until next week—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n \
