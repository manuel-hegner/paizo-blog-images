  \ month the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange Aeons Adventure\
  \ Path</a> wraps up, and by the time this blog goes live some subscribers will have\
  \ already dug their claws into the adventure while others have to wait for stores\
  \ to put them on the shelves next Wednesday.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Over the course of this Adventure Path, readers have seen how subtle corruptions\
  \ can boil over into dangerous territory, leaving those that witness them to gestate\
  \ further horrors in their own minds that can threated the world at large. Within\
  \ this Adventure Path, we got a look at the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods that make\
  \ up the Elder Mythos. We explored Hastur's cult and had a glimpse into what might\
  \ happen if that Great Old One was to rise as an Outer Gods. We got to look deeper\
  \ into the vile evil of the Necronomicon, and explored the strange world of the\
  \ Dreamlands. We ventured to forgotten locations in Golarion and stepped beyond\
  \ the gap between worlds to set foot on lost Carcosa. In the Adventure Path bestiary,\
  \ we got to show you new statistics for a Great Old One in each installment, as\
  \ well as a double handful of other Mythos creatures throughout. It's been a strange\
  \ journey to say the least.</p> \n    <p>I'm terrible at picking favorites, be it\
  \ a favorite color, favorite song, favorite food, whatever. However, since I had\
  \ so many great writers on this Adventure Path, I felt the need to pick my favorite\
  \ thing that they created in each of the six adventures. Like always, it's difficult\
  \ picking my favorite things that I liked about each one, so in some cases I just\
  \ went with my gut when picking from my lengthy lists. Here goes!</p> \n    <blockquote>\

  \ \n    <p>Today we're also excited to announce that our partners at <a href=\"\
  /companies/syrinscape\">Syrinscape</a> have released the first Strange Aeons SoundPack!\
  \ Ben has, yet again, worked his magic on bringing <a href=\"/products/btpy9r6p?Syrinscape-Strange-Aeons-1-In-Search-of-Sanity-SoundPack\"\
  >\"In Search of Sanity\"</a> alive in all of its delightfully creepy beauty. After\
  \ listening to it at my desk, I nabbed Wes so he could get a chance to hear the\
  \ demented sounds of his adventure. This SoundSet really captures the fear and uncertainty\
  \ of trying to survive an asylum that has descended into monstrous chaos. I loved\
  \ hearing the sounds for the argus wall, and the encounter with what Debis Lieklan\
  \ has become is especially unnerving. Listening to this also made me realize that\
  \ I need to put more dialog in adventures, as it was great hearing the NPCs in this\
  \ adventure come to life.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The first volume in the\
  \ new Strange Aeons Adventure Path, \"In Search of Sanity\", is a fantastically\
  \ intense and ghastly adventure needing equally fantastic and horrible sounds. You\
  \ can get a peek at the process behind how the Syrinscape team worked their magic\
  \ to bring this adventure to spine tinglingly disturbing 3D life <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSSh9w0Ge7I\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">on our YouTube channel</a>. (<i>Who would have thought you could\
  \ voice a Nightgaunt with a fur seal?</i>)</p> \n     <p>With the <a href=\"/products/btpy9r6p?Syrinscape-Strange-Aeons-1-In-Search-of-Sanity-SoundPack\"\
  ><em>In Search of Sanity SoundPack</em></a> you'll be able to carefully and finely\
  \ tune your player's discomfort. Subtly ramping up or down from one so-called \"\
  Tension Level\" is simply a matter of touching a single button. Your players probably\
  \ won't even notice just how intensely immersed and involved they've been in the\
  \ adventure session. Not until you stop Syrinscape to take a break and the mood\
  \ weirdly drains from the room will they know just how you've been masterfully you've\
  \ been controlling the ebb and flow of this horror adventure with a few subtle mostly\
  \ subliminal tones.</p> \n     <p>Watch the demo below and grab the <a href=\"/products/btpy9r6p?Syrinscape-Strange-Aeons-1-In-Search-of-Sanity-SoundPack\"\

  \ \n    <h2>Crossing the Streams</h2> \n    <p>For those of you who want more Call\
  \ of Cthulhu chocolate in their Pathfinder peanut butter (or vice versa—it's your\
  \ metaphor to manipulate as needed), James Jacobs worked up a clever system in the\
  \ Continuing the Campaign article to merge your Strange Aeons characters with investigators\
  \ working against the sinister machinations of the Mythos in this final Strange\
  \ Aeons Adventure Path volume, <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcm?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-114-Black-Stars-Beckon\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #114: Black Stars Beckon</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>When\
  \ using this system, at the climax of the Adventure Path, the PCs don't return to\
  \ Golarion, but instead a magical vortex opens in Carcosa that blasts their consciousness\
  \ out to the stars where they arrive in the minds of humans on a planet with a strong\
  \ connection to Carcosa—Earth.</p> \n    <p>This provides an option to play adventures\
  \ with the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/c/chaosium/byProductType/roleplayingGames/callOfCthulhu\"\
  >Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game</a> where the investigators have the spirit essences\
  \ of the characters the players controlled throughout the Strange Aeons Adventure\
  \ Path inhabiting their minds on Earth. These spirit essences want to return to\
  \ Golarion, but can't make the transition until they achieve some goals on Earth\
  \ such as preventing the rise of eldritch forces and fighting against Mythos influence.\
  \ With enough successes, the characters' spirit essences are freed from the human\
  \ investigators and can safely return to their selves on Golarion.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ is an interesting approach to merging two different games and campaigns, and I'm\
  \ interested in seeing how folks use it.</p> \n    <p>This month's Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path closes out the Strange Aeons Adventure Path and I hope that you've enjoyed\
  \ the weird ride as much as we've enjoyed bringing to you. Stay tuned to this blog\
  \ for deeper looks into the Adventure Path as we bring you more reports from the\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/orderOfTheAmberDie\">Order of the Amber Die</a> as\
  \ they run marathon sessions of the remaining adventures in this campaign. You're\
  \ not getting this Adventure Path out of your head that easy.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
