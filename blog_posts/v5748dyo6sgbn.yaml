  \ an alternate version of the item Resonance system for testing using the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak\"\
  ><em>Raiders of Shrieking Peak</em></a> adventure and an encapsulated set of rules.\
  \ So, how did we get to this release, how do you use it, what's different, and what\
  \ do we expect out of it?</p> \n    <h2>The Survey Data</h2> \n    <p>First, let's\
  \ talk about what our survey data has shown us. All the surveys you've been filling\
  \ out during the playtest process have helped us immensely, and the Rules Survey\
  \ in particular is telling us a lot about how the rules are being received. The\
  \ Rules Survey asked quite a few questions about the Resonance system. As you can\
  \ probably tell from some of the questions on that survey, we looked at things people\
  \ in the community were already saying to gauge how widespread those sentiments\
  \ really were. For example, we had seen a lot of people comment that they thought\
  \ it didn't make sense for potions to cost Resonance Points, so we included this\
  \ in the survey to gather more information. The results so far show that 55% of\
  \ respondents have said that while it makes sense that other items cost Resonance,\
  \ it doesn't make sense for potions. (26% have said it doesn't make sense that <i>anything</i>\
  \ costs Resonance.)</p> \n    <p>The main set of questions we asked about Resonance\
  \ showed us pretty strongly that Resonance as printed was highly unpopular. Few\
  \ people thought characters had the right number of points, there was too much tracking,\
  \ the rules on overspending weren't engaging, and only about 20% of respondents\
  \ thought the system was a clear improvement over First Edition. When introducing\
  \ a <i>new</i> system, it's especially important that the system be seen as a clear\
  \ improvement, or it's not pulling its weight.</p> \n    <p>However, not all of\
  \ the feedback was negative. The rules had good ratings on being easy to understand,\
  \ and there was strong support (both in the surveys and in forum posts we've been\
  \ seeing) for Resonance as a way to make it easier to track multiple-use items.\
  \ Though we didn't ask about it directly in the survey, we've also seen solid support\
  \ for a more flexible system of worn items compared to First Edition's item slots.\
  \ So, the new iteration of the Resonance system looks to expand on these few elements\
  \ that were well liked, while reducing the elements that felt like burdens.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>How to Test Resonance</h2> \n    <p>I'm going to go into plenty of detail\
  \ on why we're testing the changes we are, but some of that info is also in the\
  \ test document. So, if you want to just get on with it and pick up the file, here's\
  \ how.</p> \n    <p>To test the new Resonance system, you'll need to download two\
  \ files: the adventure <em>Raiders of Shrieking Peak</em> and the Resonance Test\
  \ file. The adventure is the same as the preexisting Pathfinder Society Playtest\
  \ Scenario (and as we've mentioned before, you can run either version in Pathfinder\
  \ Society for credit). The Resonance Test file contains the rules for this alternate\
  \ system, design notes on our intent with various rules, lots of new versions of\
  \ items, the pregenerated characters to use in the adventure, and a short GM section\
  \ with the few thematic adjustments you need to make to the adventure and items\
  \ that appear in the adventure.</p> \n    <div style=\"max-width:555px; margin:2rem\

  >Resonance Test Survey</a> and tell us what you thought! This survey will give you\
  \ questions depending on whether you ran it, played in it, read it, or any combination\
  \ thereof. We expect this survey will remain open till the end of the year like\
  \ the other surveys.</p> \n    <h2>The Changes</h2> \n    <p>So what did we change?\
  \ As we said from the outset, the Resonance Points system in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em>\
  \ was highly experimental, and it was clear that experiment had failed. Jason quite\
  \ correctly pointed out that we needed to show where our line of thinking is going\
  \ in the wake of this and solicit additional feedbackâ€”telling everyone to wait for\
  \ the final rules isn't enough. Hence, this new experiment takes what we learned\
  \ from play and the surveys and takes a crack at something we think is more interesting\
  \ and flexible, and that we hope you feel the same way about. Much of what I'm about\
  \ to say here is replicated in the document, and just included here to give you\
  \ the full perspective.</p> \n    <p>This test is checking to see whether some version\
  \ of the system is satisfying. Resonance has its roots in concepts that appeared\
  \ in First Edition through the occultist class, resonant powers between certain\
  \ magic items, and several other places in the lore. Is there something valuable\
  \ in the idea that items can be made stronger though the user's strength of personality\
  \ and essence?</p> \n    <p>First off, let's clarify that while the term \"Resonance\
  \ Points\" is still in the document, that's not what's being used to activate items\
  \ any more (we'll get to those in a bit). Instead, Resonance Points are just to\
  \ track your capacity to wear items. This aspect of Resonance had a favorable response,\
  \ and so we're hoping to maintain the flexibility of item choice that comes with\
  \ removing item slots. However, the point value for Resonance is now different.\
  \ You get 10. At 1st level, at 20th level. This is because when we use Resonance\
  \ for just worn items, we're only looking to prevent extreme cases of abuse and\
  \ discourage extreme item loadouts. For most characters, 10 worn items is plenty.\
  \ Think of it like Bulk, where the number is high enough that characters rarely\
  \ need to worry about it unless they have extremely low Strength or they try to\
  \ carry way too much.</p> \n    <p>As for getting more out of items, that's where\
  \ Focus Points come in. This new pool unites two similar concepts: the extra spells\
  \ you could cast via Spell Points and the extra energy you could put into magic\
  \ items to get more out of them (think of this along the lines of the occultist's\
  \ focus powers or the Charisma-based Use Magic Device skill from First Edition).\
  \ Unlike Spell Points, all characters have Focus Points, and your number per day\
  \ is equal to your Charisma modifier plus 1 or 2, depending on your ancestry. You\
  \ can spend a Focus Point to cast a power (in the Resonance Test, this is a cleric's\
  \ domain power or a sorcerer's bloodline power), or can spend a Focus Point when\
  \ activating an item to improve its effect.</p> \n    <p>Notice I said <i>improve</i>\
  \ it. In this test, items don't normally cost anything to activate. If you use a\
  \ scroll or drink a potion, you spend nothing but the consumable itself. You can\
  \ activate your <i>bracers of missile deflection</i> once per day, spending nothing\
  \ to do so. What you get out of spending a Focus Point depends on the item: A healing\
  \ potion doubles its healing, the <i>bracers of missile deflection</i> can be activated\
  \ again, the splash damage from an <i>alchemist's fire</i> has a bigger area, and\
  \ so on. One of my favorite little distinctions is the <i>invisibility potion</i>.\
  \ If you only need to move into a combat and make an attack while invisible, you\
  \ can drink the potion to get 1d4 rounds of invisibility. However, if you have a\
  \ lot of sneaking around to do before you plan on fighting, you can extend the effect\
  \ to 10 minutes instead by spending a Focus Point!</p> \n    <p>The pool of Focus\
  \ Points doesn't grow as huge as the Resonance Point pool did, since your level\
  \ isn't added to it and, unlike Spell Points, you don't get more points when you\
  \ take new powers. The goal here is to make each use of Focus more exciting and\
  \ interesting. When someone spends a Focus Point, it should be a capital-M Moment.\
  \ One of the overall goals for the Second Edition is to make your individual decisions\
  \ during play more impactful and exciting, with fewer set routines. The printed\
  \ version of Resonance didn't do that, and we're hoping Focus Points give you something\
  \ exciting to look forward to rather than a chore to carry out. If you look at the\
  \ cleric and sorcerer powers from the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> compared to the\
  \ ones in the Resonance Test, you'll see that they got stronger, because they now\
  \ cost a more precious resource.</p> \n    <p>I want to address a couple concerns\
  \ briefly. One is that classes that thematically should have a decent number of\
  \ Focus Points will be left out if the pool is Charisma-based. We expect that these\
  \ classes would have solid methods to adjust their number of points. For instance,\
  \ a wizard might get some points each day from his arcane focus, or a ki-using monk\
  \ might meditate to refresh some Focus Points. However, we'd be looking at these\
  \ remaining Charisma-based, so a wizard who wants to increase Charisma gets a Focus\
  \ Point benefit from it just like a fighter would. The other concern is that we're\
  \ weakening items to make room for these Focus Point abilities, such as the shorter\
  \ duration for the <i>invisibility potion</i> mentioned above. Some of the baseline\
  \ effects of these items are weakening for another reason. Namely, when removing\
  \ the Resonance Point requirement for activation, we do need to rein in some of\
  \ the baseline abilities, since now money is the only limit on how often you can\
  \ use them. The Focus Point additions are on top of this adjusted baseline power,\
  \ and if they were removed, the base items would <i>not</i> end up as strong as\
  \ they are in the current printed version of the book, when they cost a Resonance\
  \ Point each time.</p> \n    <p>Will having Focus Points be entirely optional satisfy\
  \ people's desires for a different system? Will the folks who said spending Resonance\
  \ on items doesn't make sense think any differently now that Focus is an addition\
  \ that allows characters to gain more power or benefit out of their items? Will\
  \ a substantial number of people think that it's a cool system, but that there's\
  \ still too much bookkeeping? That's what we'll be looking for you to tell us in\
  \ the survey and your comments.</p> \n    <h2>The Long Term</h2> \n    <p>So, if\
  \ this test (or parts of it) goes well, what can you expect the long-term changes\
  \ to be? First off, we need to be clear: Regardless of what people think of the\
  \ system, there's just no way, logistically, to implement a full change within the\
  \ playtest period. We mightâ€”and I stress <i>might</i>â€”be able to put out some more\
  \ samples or previews of where we think we're going, and possibly even guidelines\
  \ to adapt the printed Resonance system further, but you won't be seeing a total\
  \ rewrite of the rules.</p> \n    <p>It's also unlikely that the final items in\
  \ the book or the final system rules will look exactly like what you see in the\
  \ Resonance Test, even if the test goes great. Opening up more free magic might\
  \ necessitate some other changes once players would gain unbounded access to crafting\
  \ magic items. For example, wands, staves, or scrolls might need to be a higher\
  \ level or more expensive. And if we get feedback that the Focus Points system should\
  \ be scuttled entirely, an item like a wand might need to go still higher regardless.\
  \ We're going to try and minimize that as much as we can, though! Keeping magic\
  \ items magical and coming to your character when their abilities are still useful\
  \ is hugely important, and we don't want to go from one system that feels too restrictive\
  \ to another that feels restrictive, just in a different way.</p> \n    <p>Some\
  \ of the terminology and presentation of the rules might change too. \"Resonance\
  \ Points\" might make a little more sense if phrased in a different way, such as\
  \ an interference field that builds up from 0 to a limit of 10 rather than points\
  \ you spend from 10 down to 0â€”for the purposes of this Resonance Test, some of the\
  \ wording was just kept intentionally close to the printed text so it's easier to\
  \ understand and compare for readers who've been keeping up with the playtest from\
  \ the start.</p> \n    <p>We can say with confidence that the printed rules in the\
  \ <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> won't be in the final version of the book as is. The\
  \ Resonance Test is an experiment to see whether there's still an interesting idea\
  \ in there. The most extreme case we might end up with looks more like Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition, with something like the items you see in the Resonance Test, but\
  \ with no extra benefits for spending Focus Points.</p> \n    <p>And all this, of\
  \ course, relies on you and what you have to say. We deeply appreciate all the time\
  \ you've put into playtesting this game. If you have time to playtest the Resonance\
  \ Test, that's fantastic! The playtest schedule is tight, and if you only have time\
  \ to give the test a read but not to play, that's also so, so helpful. We look forward\
  \ to hearing more from you as you lament the fates of your characters, struggle\
  \ against the clock, achieve the impossible, punch holes in the rules, and click\
  \ through another set of surveys. From Jason, Stephen, Mark, and me, thank you all!</p>\
