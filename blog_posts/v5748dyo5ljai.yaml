  \ Workbookâ€”Inside Issue #2!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 16,\

  \     <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYN0032-E_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The second issue of Dynamite's\
  \ sword &amp; sorcery superstar crossover series, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> releases TODAY in comic shops, and is now shipping from\
  \ the paizo.com store! The issue features a foreboding jungle adventure in which\
  \ Seoni the sorcerer awakens in a deadly dimension that harvests the deadliest warriors\
  \ of three worlds. Before she can reunite with her friends Valeros, Kyra, and Merisiel,\
  \ she must first survive the jungle alone. Her adventure sees her face a 10-legged\
  \ Barsoomian banth, the mysterious forest goddess (and first female super-hero in\
  \ history) Fantomah, Frank Frazetta's jungle lord Thun'da, and Tars Tarkas, the\
  \ green Martian best friend of John Carter of Mars.</p> \n    <p>Like all Pathfinder\
  \ comics, <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #2</em></a> contains\
  \ a short Pathfinder RPG rules appendix and a pull-out poster map. The poster for\
  \ the issue continues the jungle scene presented in <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, with a focus on an immense tree with ritualistic\
  \ significance. You can put each of the two maps together to create a double-sized\
  \ jungle encounter!</p> \n    <p>The text of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\">issue\
  \ #2's</a> RPG appendix focuses on green Martians, everyone's favorite four-armed\
  \ original creations of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Mars novels. I'd originally intended\
  \ to include stats for Tars Tarkas himself in this issue, but the background of\
  \ the race and its various abilities ended up hogging up so much space that Tars\
  \ himself will appear later, most likely in issue #5, where the character again\
  \ plays a significant role. This issue is more about creating the rules elements\
  \ that I'll later use to make that character, as well as a couple of weapons that\
  \ will also come into play next month, when we get to John Carter himself.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I used the race builder rules from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><em>Advanced\
  \ Race Guide</em></a> hardcover to build the green Martian rules. As with previous\
  \ Worldscape adaptations, I let the source material dictate my choices. For example,\
  \ Large size and four arms are both extremely \"expensive\" traits in the race builder\
  \ system (because of their significant impact on play), and those two powers alone\
  \ make the green Martian a 15-point race, putting them on par with something like\
  \ the fetchling or suli (by contrast, a halfling is 9 points).</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161116-GreenMartians.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161116-GreenMartians_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But there's more to green Martians than their arms and\
  \ size. There's also their ability to detect thoughts, their weapon familiarity\
  \ with longswords and spears, their legendary ferocity, and a few other powers to\
  \ boot. At the end of the day, green Martians are more like 23-25 points, putting\
  \ them on par with the likes of svirfneblin (24) or trox (28), but well short of\
  \ drow nobles (41).</p> \n    <p>The issue also includes rules for Barsoomian radium\
  \ pistols and rifles, but I'll discuss that more in future blogs.</p> \n    <p>I've\
  \ been very pleased by reaction to the first issue of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a>. I can't wait to hear what you think of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\"\
  >issue #2</a>, and look forward to hearing about your green Martian Pathfinder heroes\
  \ and villains for years to come!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n  \
