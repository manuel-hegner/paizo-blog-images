  m Director of Operations at the Know Direction Network. Writing for <em>Lost Omens:\
  \ Legends</em> is my first Pathfinder 2e work for Paizo, and my first Paizo credit\
  \ since my oldest daughter was born. I am glad to be back, and was ecstatic to be\
  \ assigned Khismar Crookchar. He was one of the book’s blankest slates, only appearing\
  \ in a sidebar in the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em> that alleged he was a notable\
  \ figure in the Broken Lands. With four pages of freedom, I got to turn this blue\
  \ streaked gnome into a hype-dealing hype addict, protected by layers of back-up\
  \ plans because he is paranoid that everyone is as deceptive as him.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>I loved the collaborative way in which Luis and Eleanor managed us Legends\
  \ freelancers, and particularly enjoyed working with Ashton Sperry to flesh out\
  \ Khismar’s relationship with Kevoth-Kul. I love the dynamic of their relationship;\
  \ it’s like Conan with a laser sword hanging out with Salacious Crumb on Red Bull.</p>\

  \ Hornyak</b><br> Hello folks! My name is Nicolas Hornyak, and on <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Legends</em>, I got to write the story of Magdelena and Martum Fallows, a pair\
  \ of halfling abolitionists who are the current Farmers for the Bellflower Network.\
  \ This was my first time writing with Paizo, and I was brought aboard in an active\
  \ effort to recruit more freelancers from the Latinx community</p> \n      <p>From\
  \ the very start, I knew that I’d taken on a huge responsibility. Even in fantasy,\
  \ you cannot write about slavery (and subsequently, abolitionists) without acknowledging\
  \ that real people are still affected by the enslavement of their ancestors every\
  \ day. And even though I’m a Latinx individual, I have not been subjected to racism\
  \ in the same ways that Black and Brown people have. So I opted to be as cognizant\
  \ as possible. I read books, listened to podcasts, and dug up articles, because\
  \ even in Golarion, we must be as diligent as possible when approaching the parallels\
  \ between fantasy and reality.</p> \n      <p>What emerged was a pair of halflings\
  \ who were enabled to seize their own destinies, who understood that the law would\
  \ neither serve nor protect them in the fight ahead. Magdelena came to represent\
  \ the station masters and conductors operating the Underground Railroad, while Martum\
  \ stood in for abolitionists securing money from stockholders. Meanwhile, the Bellflower\
  \ Network uses quilts to send messages to halflings escaping slavery, while slave-hunters\
  \ are known to kidnap halflings who were never slaves. All of these details were\
  \ part of the reality for Black people on the road to freedom and deserved acknowledgment.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Even though I attempted to be as responsible as possible, I wrote this\
  \ material for people who play Pathfinder. Once the Fallows enter your game, I don’\
  t know what will happen to them. But I hope that players and game masters will also\
  \ acknowledge the responsibility that comes with approaching topics such as slavery\
  \ and abolitionism. It’s my hope that, like Earth, slavery in Golarion is considered\
  \ so evil by Pathfinder players that no PC would support or enable it. It would\
  \ be a line they wouldn’t cross, no matter what.</p> \n      <p>I sincerely hope\
  \ that I did Magdelena and Martum the justice they deserve. But if I made mistakes,\
  \ I’d rather learn about them than trick myself into thinking I did everything right.\

  \ \n      <p><b>Andrew Mullen</b><br> Howdy, folks! I'm Andrew Mullen, and you might\
  \ recognize me from adventure backmatters, insufferable puns on social media, or\
  \ the Magaambya section of the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>. Working on the\
  \ latter was a big boon for my part in <em>Legends</em>: Old-Mage Jatembe! I was\
  \ thrilled to write about the early days of one of my favorite in-world figures,\
  \ particularly because I read a ton of folklore and myths as a kid, and portraying\
  \ his discovery of magic in that style felt like a natural fit. It was also lovely\
  \ to provide another glimpse at Magaambyan life through the lens of perhaps the\
  \ most important NPCs in all of Golarion—the spider boyfriends on <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Character Guide</em> page 99!</p> \n      <p>There are a few other recent pieces\
  \ I hope you'll check out. I have xulgath variants in every book of the Extinction\
  \ Curse AP, as well as a look at xulgath culture in <em>Legacy of the Lost God</em>\
  \ that I'm particularly proud of. I wrote about giant trees and Ghorus Prime for\
  \ <em>Near Space</em>. Finally, you can hear a recent interview with me on the <a\

  \ Murphy</b><br> Hey, I’m Hilary Moon Murphy, aka Hmm. I’m a librarian, freelancer,\
  \ mom, and proud GM with Paizo’s Organized Play program. Writing the Artokus Kirran’\
  s section of this book was an utter delight because I got to resolve two apparently\
  \ conflicting pieces of information in Artokus’s story: first, that he taught students,\
  \ and second... that no one had seen him in living memory! I wrote a piece of short\
  \ fiction illustrating a day in Artokus’s life, and tell a side of his story that\
  \ no one has seen before... and introduce two characters pivotal to Artokus’s story.\

  атели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may best know me as the author\
  \ of the Kortos Mounts Gazetteer (AP #156), PFS 1-15 <em>Blooming Catastrophe</em>,\
  \ and the human ethnicities in <em>Lost Omen Character Guide</em>. When not writing\
  \ about Abyssal leshys and depressed lich-queens, I’m a Russian-American historian\
  \ and educator (I have a book! <em>How Russia Lost Bulgaria, 1878-1886: Empire Unguided</em>,\
  \ Lexington Books, 2018).</p> \n      <p>In <em>Legends</em>, I wrote Baba Yaga\
  \ and Eutropia. Baba Yaga is a figure of enormous cultural significance in the former\
  \ Soviet Union, and writing her was, truthfully, an honor. It was also the first\
  \ and probably the last time that the rest of my family actually understood what\
  \ I was writing.</p> \n      <p>Eutropia, meanwhile, was great fun. <em>War for\
  \ the Crown</em> is perhaps my favorite Adventure Path, and the narrator of her\
  \ section, Samel Maleagant, Senior Priest-Advocate of the Court of Black Paper,\
  \ is an old PC of mine and someone you’ll be seeing again – he features in <em>Absalom,\
  \ City of Lost Omens</em>. I’ve a few more projects forthcoming from Paizo, so until\

  \ Howdy, I'm Ashton Sperry, writing to you from a hot summer day in Boise, Idaho!\
  \ I wrote the entry on Kevoth-Kul, one of my favorite characters from one of my\
  \ favorite corners of Golarion. Before this, you might recognize my name from the\
  \ Pathfinder Paper Minis line, or as N'wah on the boards here.</p> \n      <p>I\
  \ could understand a lot of folks dismissing the old Kevoth-Kul, a puppet warlord\
  \ addicted to Numerian fluids and controlled by the Technic League. Some groups\
  \ may have even killed him in <em>Iron Gods</em>! But I thought the idea of the\
  \ immortal, powerful black sovereign, now in full control of his faculties and out\
  \ from under the League's thumb, looking to unite all the Kellid clans under one\
  \ banner, to be compelling. Hopefully you will too. And wait 'til you check out\
