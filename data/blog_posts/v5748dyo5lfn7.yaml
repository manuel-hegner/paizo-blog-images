  \    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Has\
  \ it really been four weeks already? The playtest of the new classes set to debut\
  \ in the Advanced Class Guide is drawing to a close. Today at 5:00 PM Pacific time,\
  \ the boards and surveys will be closed, marking the end of one of our more successful\
  \ playtests. It's been a wild ride for us here on the design team and the classes\
  \ have seen marked improvement from their initial designs. For that, we have you\
  \ to thank.</span></p> \n     <p>Playtests of this nature are a tricky process to\
  \ manage. There are disagreements, heated discussions, wildly varying design philosophies,\
  \ and threads that seem to go on for countless pages. Through it all, we have endeavored\
  \ to read and respond as much as our time would allow, while still putting time\
  \ in on the classes themselves to improve them and clarify their abilities. We released\
  \ a second version of the classes just last week, to show off some of our progress,\
  \ but we are not done yet. The work will now continue in house as we dial in our\
  \ final changes to make these classes a great addition to your game. It's a lot\
  \ of work, but it is well worth the effort.</p> \n     <p>This will be our final\
  \ update on this book until its release this coming August. Expect to see a number\
  \ of previews, showing off some of the final designs, as we approach that date.\
  \ For those of you playing these classes in Pathfinder Society games, continue to\
  \ use the second playtest versions of the classes until the book is released. For\
  \ the rest of you, I can honestly say that we are excited to show off our final\
  \ work on these classes and I am sure that most of you will be happy with the results.\
  \ As an side note, I will be posting up a thread in the Pathfinder general discussion\
  \ forum for folks to give us feedback on the playtest process itself, so that we\
  \ can continue to improve our playtest process. Look for that thread after the playtest\
  \ has closed.</p> \n     <p>Finally, I want to remind all of you to update your\
  \ survey results right now! The surveys come down today at 5:00 PM Pacific time\
  \ as well, and we want to make sure that we get your opinions on the revised versions\
  \ of the classes. You can find the surveys right <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/advancedClassGuide/survey\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n     <p>So, in closing, the design team would like to off up our\
  \ thanks for all of your hard work on this playtest. Although we are now mentally\
  \ exhausted and ready for a nap, we greatly appreciate you putting us through our\
  \ paces on these designs. I think you will find that all of the long hours reading\
  \ PDFs and playtest boards will have paid off. The Advanced Class Guide is shaping\
  \ up to be an awesome addition to the Pathfinder game.</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
