  ><em>Lost Omens Highhelm</em></a> has been out for some time now, we wanted to take\
  \ one last look at the book and the authors who made it possible. Dwarves are known\
  \ for their fine crafts and the work these authors put into <em>Highhelm</em> would\
  \ make any dwarf proud to display this book next to their finest blades and armor.\
  \ As these authors share a bit about them and their work, consider letting them\
  \ know if you like their work in the comments or following them on social media!</p>\

  \ and I was thrilled to contribute The Depths section of <em>Lost Omens: Highhelm</em>.\
  \ I had a lot of fun thinking about the different countercultural elements that\
  \ might bubble up in a less-structured part of the city and how they would interact\
  \ with the dominant customs that shape the rest of Highhelm.</p> \n      <p>If your\
  \ PCs ever venture out of the main city, I hope they take the chance to learn the\
  \ local legends (and perhaps rescue some local daredevils) at Diomira's Drop, splurge\
  \ for a snail mucin facial at The Smelted Bank, or perhaps get in on the action\
  \ at The Fight Pits!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Michelle Jones</h3> \n      <p>What's\
  \ up gamers! It's ya girl, Michelle Jones, here once again, back to provide you\
  \ with the finest player options in all of King's Crown (and the only player options\
  \ in King's Crown... cause I wrote them all). If you want weapons that literally\
  \ deal death, then there's no topping Ornmarr's Fell Arms. If you want stealthy,\
  \ political intrigue, there's plenty for that too. And for the GMs who love to confound\
  \ and terrify their players, I have created a special gift in the bestiary, known\
  \ as the Bloodstorm.</p> \n      <p>If you want to keep up with me, you can follow\

  \ including <a href=\"http://everybodygames.net/\">Everybody Games</a> and <a href=\"\
  https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/\">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> \n      <p>I was\
  \ excited to expand on the cultures, subcultures, and countercultures of the great\
  \ city of Highhelm, as well as to bring the fiery god Angradd into Second Edition.\
  \ My favorite contribution to the book was the gazetteer of the Five Kings Mountains;\
  \ it has everything you need for an adventure right outside Highhelm's doors. If\
  \ you need directions from Fort Dagh to Mount Gustus, I'm your guy!</p> \n     \

  !&nbsp;My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Ukrainian-American author\
  \ and historian. You may know me from prior works such as&nbsp;<em>Dark Archive</em>,&nbsp;<em>\
  \ Impossible Lands</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Mwangi Expanse</em>, alongside a couple\
  \ dozen other Pathfinder works.</p> \n      <p>Here in <em>Highhelm</em>, the section\
  \ I wrote up was limited to King's Crown. So, if you get yourself eaten by a very\
  \ charming shadow ooze or caught in a nuclear explosion created by a dwarven apocalypse\
  \ cult, blame me (I am not sorry).</p> \n      <p>When not working on bringing nukes\
  \ into Golarion, I'm the Creative Director of the Luminant Age campaign setting,\
  \ a post-apocalyptic weird fantasy swashbuckler. It also has nukes (we call it the\
  \ omphalic flame), alongside mecha-cultists, psychic angel-trees, and whatever-it-is\
  \ a Masqued Strix is. You can find us&nbsp;on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuminantA\"\
  >https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>&nbsp;(assuming Twitter still exists when this\
  \ goes up) or check out our published products at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://luminant-age.itch.io/\"\

  \ forthcoming Kickstarter,&nbsp;<em>Paragons of the Luminant Age</em>, a book full\
  \ of archetypes and NPCs—including the Esseweaver, written by the one and only Mark\
  \ Seifter!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Erin Roberts</h3> \n      <p>Hey y’all,\
  \ I’m Erin Roberts and I had the absolute pleasure of writing the Stonebreach section\
  \ of Highhelm (including the Stonebreach options). I’ve lived in cities my entire\
  \ life and getting a chance to give some love and new depth to a fictional city\
  \ was a real joy. I was especially excited to work on Stonebreach, the most working-class\
  \ area of Highhelm, and try to capture the hardworking, hard-playing, sometimes\
  \ hard-up but rarely hardhearted vibe that I envisioned being a part of daily life\
  \ there.</p> \n      <p>In addition to being a city dweller, I’m a writer of stories\
  \ and games. I usually have at least two projects going at any one time and was\
  \ thrilled to be recognized this year as one of the winners of the Diana Jones Awards\
  \ Emerging Designer program. I have lots of cool stuff coming up, including an article\
  \ in the final issue of MCDM’s&nbsp;<em>Arcadia</em>&nbsp;(out in late July). To\
  \ keep up with what I’m up to, visit me at&nbsp;<a title=\"This external link opens\
