  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Evey Brett</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Loyalties</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">An hour's\
  \ walk took them to a small cave along the rocky shoreline, one exposed by the low\
  \ tide and grown brown and slippery with algae. Anandi followed Ravi inside, careful\
  \ of his footing. \"Well?\" he asked, impatient.</p> \n    <p>Instead of answering,\
  \ Ravi curled his hand around the back of Anandi's neck and pulled him close. The\
  \ kiss tasted of wine and pesh. Anandi let it last longer than he should have, surprised\
  \ by how much he liked feeling the firm body pressed against his. Gently, Anandi\
  \ pushed him back. \"Is this your price?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I owe you for taking care\
  \ of me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You owe me nothing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But...\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Nothing. Understand?\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi didn't. Anandi could see his confusion\
  \ and wished he had a way to explain it better, but he didn't have time. <i>Two\
  \ can play this game.</i> He cupped Ravi's face in his palms and kissed him. As\
  \ he'd expected, Ravi sank into his arms, pliable as soft clay. Anandi was tender\
  \ with him, working from his mouth to his neck and shoulders. Ravi tried to return\
  \ the gestures, but Anandi nudged him against the wall and pinned him there, mindful\
  \ of Ravi's bruises. Once he'd gotten Ravi properly aroused, he said, \"The bottle\
  \ isn't here, is it?\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi froze. \"No. It is. I swear.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Where, then?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I can't tell you.\" Ravi turned his head\
  \ to the side, cringing as if expecting a blow.</p> \n    <p><i>Gods grant me patience.</i>\
  \ Anandi kissed him again, nibbling gently at his ear and neck. \"I won't hurt you,\
  \ and I promise I won't tell the captain.\"</p> \n    <p> For once, Anandi had cause\
  \ to be glad of the pesh addiction. The effects were wearing off, which made Ravi's\
  \ emotions unstable. He started to ramble. \"He'll kill me if I tell. I wasn't supposed\
  \ to see. It was an accident I came along in the first place. I followed them, because\
  \ I thought it might be fun to... you know... out on the beach and all... but when\
  \ Cap saw me, he gave me an awful beating. Said I was dead if I ever told.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Now that wasn't very nice of him. If you tell me, I'll give you a treat.\"\
  \ He ran a finger down Ravi's chest, stopping just below his navel. \"Where's the\
  \ bottle, Ravi?\"</p> \n    <p>Trembling, Ravi jerked his head at the beach. \"\
  Out there near the water. It's in the tide pool.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Show me.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ravi led him unerringly to the aforementioned tide pool. Lying on his\
  \ belly on the slick rocks, he fished in the water with his hand and soon drew out\
  \ a lead casket sealed with wax. \"In there.\" He slid it toward Anandi, then sat\
  \ up with his knees pulled to his chest, rocking back and forth.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ weren't any sigils of warding on the box, but that didn't mean the lock wasn't\
  \ spelled or set with a trap. Anandi spent a few moments inspecting the lock, then\
  \ dug out a pick from his pouch and worked it open. Inside, nestled in a bed of\
  \ silk, was the bottle. </p> \n    <p>As soon as he saw the plain-looking stopper,\
  \ the hastily scratched runes and fresh wax on the seal, he knew why it had been\
  \ so shoddily protected, and his heart sank. He glanced back at Ravi, wondering\
  \ if he knew the truth or if he was being used once again.</p> \n    <p>Not wanting\
  \ to draw suspicion, Anandi tucked the bottle into his purse, then hastily locked\
  \ and resealed the box. He found the hiding place without too much difficulty. The\
  \ tide was already coming in, which meant their tracks would soon be covered over.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Thanks. I owe you,\" Anandi said. He pulled out a small purse of coins\
  \ and tossed it to Ravi, even though he knew it would only be wasted on drink and\
  \ drugs.</p> \n    <p>Ravi made no move to touch it. He sat gazing glumly out toward\
  \ the water.</p> \n    <p><i>Damn it.</i> He hadn't meant to hurt the man's feelings.\
  \ \"Ravi? What's wrong?\" </p> \n    <p>For a long time, Ravi was silent. Then his\
  \ face crumpled. \"I'm sorry.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You haven't done anything that—\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"About them.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi looked up the beach, where at\
  \ least ten pirates were bearing down on them, fast. He was more than capable of\
  \ using the sword buckled to his waist, but it wouldn't do much good when he was\
  \ this outnumbered. Captain Maldak wasn't taking any chances. </p> \n    <p>\"Why?\"\
  \ Anandi asked.</p> \n    <p>\"Because Cap and I got paid to set you up.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Figures. The Maurya-Rahm probably sent me over here knowing I'd get killed,\
  \ and this way they could tell Asa I'd gotten myself into trouble.</i> \"By whom?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I just did what Cap told me.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi yanked the half-elf\
  \ to his feet and set a dagger to his throat. Ravi was dazed, giggling as he saw\
  \ his pirate friends with swords and knives drawn. With a sickening feeling, Anandi\
  \ guessed it wasn't the first time Ravi had been used as a bartering chip. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Touch me, and I'll kill him,\" Anandi told the captain.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DiamondInTheRough-CaptainMalthak.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DiamondInTheRough-CaptainMalthak_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Captain Maldak never passes up an opportunity to make some gold.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Maldak waved his men to halt, then shrugged. \"He's of no more\
  \ use to me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Liar!\" Ravi shouted back. \"You need me.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"There are always more whores, boy.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi let out a screech\
  \ of anguish that burned Anandi's ears. \"Come on,\" he told Ravi. He grabbed the\
  \ half-elf's wrist and hauled him up the slope that rose to the old city.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Once in the streets, Anandi grabbed Ravi's wrist and hung on as he dodged\
  \ past vendors, drunkards, and traders. He kept the western side of the island in\
  \ sight. Beyond the crumbling city's wall were the cane fields, now neglected and\
  \ overrun. Anandi dragged Ravi toward them. \"In there. Give me any trouble, and\
  \ I'll stab you in the gut.\" Hopefully it wouldn't come to that. He didn't want\
  \ to harm the half-elf, and injuring him would only slow their progress.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The threat worked, however, as did Anandi's dagger-tip lightly pressed against\
  \ Ravi's spine. Anandi didn't let up as they ran blindly through the tall cane and\
  \ hoped like hell the pirates wouldn't be able to track them. </p> \n    <p>\"Let\
  \ me go. I'll kill that son of a bitch. I'll kill him. He promised. He promised...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Whatever the captain had promised, Anandi didn't find out. Ravi broke\
  \ down sobbing, tears and snot streaming down his face. The only benefit was that\
  \ his anger gave him speed, and he ran hard, heedless of where he was going. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anandi herded him to the coast, where he called the two djinn that he'd\
  \ left there when he'd arrived. Ravi dropped in the dirt, his face a mask of fury.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The pirates weren't far behind. Ravi looked over his shoulder, saw them,\
  \ and rose shakily to his feet.</p> \n    <p><i>Ravi will die if he goes back to\
  \ them. But I can't take him back to the Conservatory...</i></p> \n    <p>Maldak\
  \ was nearly upon them, sword aimed straight at Ravi's heart.</p> \n    <p>Anandi\
  \ shoved Ravi at the nearest djinni. \"Get us out of here.\"</p> \n    <p>The djinn\
  \ obeyed without question, lifting both him and Ravi and whisking them across the\
  \ sea toward the safety of Grand Sarret. The rush of air didn't cool Ravi's fury.\
  \ Almost immediately he started wriggling and trying to escape. When that failed,\
  \ he settled for clawing at the djinni's arms and cursing loudly. Their landing\
  \ in the courtyard of the Conservatory attracted attention from a number of people,\
  \ many of whom grumbled about being disturbed by such racket. Anandi was glad to\
  \ see Chakori, one of the resident healers, in the crowd.</p> \n    <p>\"I need\
  \ you,\" Anandi said, guiding her, Ravi, and the djinni still holding him to one\
  \ of the spare rooms in the courtesans' building.</p> \n    <p>It took two soldiers\
  \ and a djinni to hold Ravi still long enough for Chakori to tend to him. Even so,\
  \ he wriggled and thrashed as she forced him to open his mouth and drink the tincture.\
  \ She gave Anandi a dark look that said, You owe me.</p> \n    <p>A light tinkling\
  \ of bells alerted him to another visitor. Damn. There was nothing he hated more\
  \ than the thakur's insipid little advisors trying to coax information out of him.\
  \ \"His Eminence would like a report of your journey,\" said this one, a woman whose\
  \ name he couldn't remember. </p> \n    <p>They always invoked the thakur's name,\
  \ even when Anandi knew for certain the thakur didn't give a damn what was going\
  \ on. \"Here.\" He turned his back to everyone in the room but the advisor and took\
  \ out the bottle. \"We damn near got killed getting it for you.\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ watched her face, searching for the slightest hint of betrayal, but her expression\
  \ showed nothing beyond banal gratitude. \"Excellent. I'm sure His Eminence will\
  \ reward you for your efforts.\" She took the bottle, wrapped it in a cloth, and\
  \ tucked it away in a pouch at her waist. </p> \n    <p>\"Tell Asa I want to see\
  \ him. Please.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll take that under advisement,\" she said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"<i>Tell</i> him.\" He handed her a heavy purse.</p> \n    <p>She nodded.\
  \ \"I will do my best. But tell me, what reason did you have to bring that with\
  \ you?\" She jerked her pretty chin at the unkempt figure on the bed.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"There's no one better to ask about the pirates. Trust me.\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ raised an eyebrow. \"The Conservatory isn't the place to keep that sort of rubbish.\
  \ His Eminence will be most displeased.\"</p> \n    <p>Which meant the Maurya-Rahm\
  \ did not approve. Anandi wondered if he'd just earned himself another attempt on\
  \ either his life or Ravi's. \"He won't be here for long. I'm only keeping him to\
  \ answer a few questions on subjects that might prove of interest to the thakur.\
  \ I'll send you a full report, of course.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\" To his relief,\
  \ she left him in peace. The two guards remained nearby, and the djinni aided Chakori,\
  \ fetching cloths and bowls of ointments.</p> \n    <p>At last the healer came over\
  \ to him, scowling. \"That's a right little bastard you have in there. No manners\
  \ at all. Where did you find him? In a slave's galley?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Close to\
  \ it,\" Anandi admitted. \"He was a pirate's boy. How is he?\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ shrugged. \"Going without that damned drug is doing a number on him. There's not\
  \ much I can do, and in my experience, it's better to let them suffer a little so\
  \ they can learn. Make it too easy, and they'll go right back to pesh the first\
  \ chance they get.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What else?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm not going to\
  \ bother telling you everything I found. You can probably guess. I will say that\
  \ he's now clean and I mended as many of his bumps and bruises as I could. Other\
  \ than that, he's malnourished and dehydrated, and he's going to get worse before\
  \ he gets better.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you,\" Anandi said, and handed her a small\
  \ purse for her troubles.</p> \n    <p>\"That's all?\"</p> \n    <p>He kissed her\
  \ cheek. \"I'll see you later.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You'd better.\"</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>\"You bastard. Why the hell am I here?\
  \ What do you want from me?\" Ravi paced the room like a wild thing in a cage, circling\
  \ round and round. \"I'm not going to tell you a damn thing. Take me home.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anandi sat calmly in a chair near the door, having sent the guards to\
  \ stand outside. They were there to protect Ravi as much as to protect others from\
  \ him, but no need to make the young man any more nervous by telling him that. \"\
  If I take you home, they'll kill us both.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You don't know them like\
  \ I do. All it'll take is a little sweet-talking and I'll be back in their good\
  \ graces. I've done it before.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You mean, you'll be back in their\
  \ beds.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi shot him a dirty look and kept walking. \"It's the best\
  \ place to knife them while they sleep.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi had patience. It was\
  \ only a matter of time before the Ravi exhausted himself. The djinni hovered nearby,\
  \ serenely watching half-elf's agitated movements, alert for any request. </p> \n\
  \    <p>An hour passed. Desperation replaced the anger in Ravi's expression. \"\
  I need some pesh. I'll do whatever you want. Just... <i>please</i>.\" </p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"You're not getting any more pesh. Ever.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi snarled and\
  \ tore at the bedclothes, flinging pillows, sheets, and comforter to the floor.\
  \ Then, with a show of strength, he ripped off the mattress and sent it hurtling\
  \ against the wall. The effort tired him. He doubled over, panting and trembling\
  \ while the djinni remade the bed.</p> \n    <p>After two more hours, the pleading\
  \ grew more frantic. He knelt beside Anandi's chair and clawed at Anandi's pants.\
  \ \"I need some pesh. Please. If you don't give it to me, I'm going to die.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You're not going to die. I promise you that.\" He gripped Ravi's chin\
  \ and forced him to look into his eyes. \"Hear me? I won't let you die. I need your\
  \ help.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi laughed, a hollow, depressing sound. \"There's only\
  \ one thing people need my help for.\" He broke away and resumed his pacing. He\
  \ shivered and chafed his arms. \"It's freezing in here.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi found\
  \ the temperature quite pleasant, almost too warm, but recognized the symptoms of\
  \ withdrawal. \"I'll get you a blanket.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You can get me some pesh\
  \ or a bottle of wine, at least.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No.\" Anandi gestured to the djinni,\
  \ who magicked a blanket into existence and draped it around Ravi's shoulders. Ravi\
  \ tossed it aside. \"It itches.\" </p> \n    <p>By nightfall, Ravi had slumped against\
  \ the bed and was shivering uncontrollably. Again, the djinni covered him with the\
  \ blanket. This time, Ravi left it where it was. \"Please,\" he begged, though his\
  \ voice was hoarse now. \"I don't want to die.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Come on. Into bed.\"\
  \ He went to help the youth up. Ravi shook so badly he could barely stand. Even\
  \ so, he jerked away from Anandi's touch.</p> \n    <p>\"Easy,\" Anandi said, gripping\
  \ his arms and setting him on the bed. Hoping Ravi had been broken down enough to\
  \ answer, he asked, \"Who paid off your captain to have me killed?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Will you get me some pesh?\" He was childlike now.</p> \n    <p>Anandi hated himself\
  \ for lying. \"If you tell me the truth. Who was it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I...\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But it was too late. Ravi's eyes rolled back and he convulsed in Anandi's\
  \ arms.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The long arm of power in Chapter Four\
