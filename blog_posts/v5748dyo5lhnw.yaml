  >Pathfinder Online</a> is something we call crowdforging. Crowdforging brings into\
  \ play a symbiotic relationship between the developers and the players. The players\
  \ become partners as we design and develop the game over the course of many years.\
  \ It's more than using customer feedback—it's having players actively contribute\
  \ to the design by giving us real information from actual gameplay. In addition,\
  \ the players are creating a vibrant world from an empty sandbox—all the stories,\
  \ quests, personalities, and most of the gear comes from their hands, forged as\
  \ they played the game.</p> \n     <h2>Crowdforging the Gameplay</h2> \n     <p>When\
  \ we started building Pathfinder Online, we created an initial design document—\
  a tome that would guide us as we started to make the game. It laid out our vision\
  \ for Pathfinder Online, conceptualizing different game systems and how they would\
  \ interact with each other. In traditional MMO design and development, the design\
  \ document would be fully implemented before a single player would be let into the\
  \ game, even in alpha or beta testing. In these games, player can have very little\
  \ impact on the fundamental design of the game design. If the designers were off\
  \ base with part of their design, there is little they can do at this point without\
  \ costly changes and long delays, so the only problems that get fixed are the things\
  \ that are either relatively easy to deal with, or the most egregious. Things that\
  \ work \"well enough\" don't usually get much attention, even if they <i>could</i>\
  \ work much better.</p> \n     <p>Instead of locking ourselves into our design document,\
  \ we created the base systems of the game—the fundamental things that every MMO\
  \ has, such as running, fighting, inventory, weapon slotting, and crafting. Then\
  \ we began bringing players into the game during a phase we called Early Enrollment,\
  \ while we were starting to work on the systems that make Pathfinder Online unique.\
  \ As we launch each of those systems, the players give us real-time feedback that\
  \ allows us to maneuver our design away from problems we didn't foresee in a way\
  \ that you just can't do with traditional MMO design.</p> \n     <p>Of course, while\
  \ the players are helping us refine our design, they are also populating the Echo\
  \ Woods, creating settlements, putting up holdings, fighting off monster incursions,\
  \ gathering loot and raw materials, and crafting finished goods such as weapons,\
  \ armor, potions, and other things that characters need to survive in the world.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It has been a really great process for us at Goblinworks. Our current\
  \ players are pioneers in the game, forging a world from the wilderness, creating\
  \ an economy, developing political alliances and enemies, and forging real friendships.\
  \ All the while, their experiences are helping us make the game better for them.\
  \ Let's talk about some examples!</p> \n     <h2>The Monsters Are Coming</h2> \n\
  \     <p>One of the new concepts you'll find in Pathfinder Online is the escalation.\
  \ There are areas of the world where different groups of NPCs—human or otherwise—\
  have staked a hold on the land to try to fulfill their own agenda. The Skullbasher\
  \ ogres are trying to fill their stew pots with meat. The Mordant Spire elves are\
  \ searching for Azlanti treasures. The duergar are looking for slaves to take back\
  \ to their underground cities.</p> \n     <p>In our original design document, these\
  \ escalations would enter the world in a particular hex and, unless they were stopped\
  \ by the players, they'd grow in power and expand into surrounding hexes. We thought\
  \ this tension would be great, but through months of gameplay, we realized that\
  \ because the pressure was always on, the players felt they were being forced to\
  \ attack escalations even when they might prefer to be doing something else. And\
  \ if they let the escalations go for a while so they could do other things, the\
  \ escalations soon got out of hand.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150627-Escalation.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150627-Escalation_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>The Bloodstone Swords join with the Pathfinder University Faculty\
  \ to battle some Charred Goblins.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>So working with the\
  \ community, we started to change the fundamental ideas behind escalations. Players\
  \ were happy when they could chip away at escalations over the course of a few weeks,\
  \ but all their hard work was evaporating when the escalation grew back from its\
  \ losses. So we changed escalations so they grow much more slowly and don't infect\
  \ other hexes as quickly. And instead of having every escalation start small and\
  \ grow, we created an escalation that came in strong, but because the monsters were\
  \ in control, they only left their lower-powered soldiers around. Then, as the players\
  \ succeeded against the escalation, more powerful minions would get sent in, with\
  \ the escalation getting harder as you got closer and closer to victory. Also, in\
  \ the next patch of the game, various events that had been on timers in the past\
  \ will have those timers removed so that progress against them won't be lost.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>All of these changes came through direct feedback from players. Without\
  \ this feedback, we would have never known that our original plans had flawed assumptions\
  \ about the way that players wanted to interact with that part of the game—at least,\
  \ not until it was too late.</p> \n     <h2>Getting the Balance Right</h2> \n  \
  \   <p>Another part of the game where crowdforging has made a difference is in balancing\
  \ the classes and the various equipment in the game so there isn't a single, sure-fire\
  \ winning strategy. This is pretty hard to do in a vacuum—game designers need real\
  \ game feedback from real players to understand why they behave in unanticipated\
  \ ways.</p> \n     <p>For instance, Pathfinder Online has a number of consumable\
  \ items that the designers thought would be a part of every player's arsenal. Tokens\
  \ are one example—they're small one-shot magic items that do a single thing, such\
  \ as heal you, improve your armor, give you resistance to energy attacks, etc. You\
  \ get them as drops from killing monsters, so you are constantly getting more. The\
  \ designers thought that even though the effect of a single token isn't huge, players\
  \ would slot them and use them regularly because they were effectively free and\
  \ they did provide a benefit. But the reality was that they just weren't powerful\
  \ enough for folks to bother with. Incredible amounts of tokens built up in character\
  \ vaults because they weren't being used in the game. So the designers amped up\
  \ the effects, and now tokens are getting used on a regular basis.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ same happened for potions. The designers thought there would be a big demand for\
  \ various potions, but only a few select potions (healing and speed) were crafted\
  \ by most people. The problem was similar to tokens: they just weren't powerful\
  \ enough to be part of a regular arsenal. Changes have been made based on player\
  \ input, and the jury is still out on whether potions are where they need to be.\
  \ Only time and actual gameplay will tell.</p> \n     <p>These are just a couple\
  \ examples of how crowdforging is working. There are many other areas where the\
  \ players have helped to evolve our design document: the auction house, rogue abilities,\
  \ the way feuds will work. This symbiosis is the crux of how we are making Pathfinder\
  \ Online the best game it can be.</p> \n     <h2>Player Profiles</h2> \n     <p>We\
  \ have a very diverse and colorful cast of characters in the game already and I\
  \ want to showcase that diversity in this blog. But due to some mix-ups on my behalf,\
  \ I don't have a player profile for this week. I have a number of profiles in the\
  \ works, and should soon have a bunch in the hopper for future weeks. But in the\
  \ spirit of crowdforging, I would love to hear your thoughts on players that you\
  \ think should be profiled, so post your thoughts in the discussion thread—I'll\
  \ be taking notes!</p> \n     <p>Lisa Stevens<br> <i>CEO</i></p> \n    </div> \n\
