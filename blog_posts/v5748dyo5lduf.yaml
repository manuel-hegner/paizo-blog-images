  \ Untimely Demise</h1> \n   <p>by Robin D. Laws</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Treasure</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Where is what?\" Luma asked, withdrawing her hand from her trickbag.\
  \ If it came to a fight, she could reach out to Magnimar's spires and towers, gather\
  \ their memories of the lightning that struck them with every thunderstorm, and\
  \ from this summon a bolt of energy to strike the dwarf down. Unlike some of her\
  \ other magics, it required no props, just concentration, a gesture, and a few words\
  \ of entreaty to the city. But she was here to learn, not to do battle.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"Don't play stupid with me.\" The dwarf showed a mouth full of jagged, rotting\
  \ teeth. \"You know very well what.\" He shook his axe for emphasis.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I would like nothing more than to understand what you're talking about.\" Luma edged\
  \ in front of the cabinet behind which Seriza cowered. \"Start at the beginning,\
  \ maybe?\"</p> \n   <p>The dwarf peered past her at the widow. \"You aren't Aruhal's\
  \ wife?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I am Luma of House Derexhi, hired to perform a service on\
  \ his behalf.\" </p> \n   <p>The intruder elevated an eyebrow. He pointed his weapon\
  \ at the cabinet. \"She's the widow?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Lay out your grievance, dwarf.\"\
  \ Luma spoke evenly, her confidence steady, as it always was when her siblings weren't\
  \ watching. She'd sooner face this frothing dwarf, outweighing her by two to one\
  \ and bristling with menace, than a single exasperated glance from one of her sisters.\
  \ \"Perhaps I can sort it out.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You address Jordyar, warrior of the\
  \ First Stone, son of Jordgar, true inheritor of the axe of Skrellim.\" He hefted\
  \ it again, this time as an expression of pride. \"To speak ill of the dead is not\
  \ my wont. But that woman's husband was a liar, a cheat, a betrayer, and a thief\
  \ from his own friends. Did you know Aruhal?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma shook her head.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Then you missed the chance to acquaint yourself with a kill-stealer\
  \ and a credit-grabber. A blasphemer against the gods, a drunkard on watch, a coward\
  \ in a scrap, and a tent-farter of the worst order.\"</p> \n   <p>\"So you were\
  \ comrades.\"</p> \n   <p>Jordyar stalked over to the divan, as if wondering whether\
  \ sitting would show weakness. \"For three years, two decades ago, we strove together\
  \ as treasure-seekers. We plumbed the depths of the Riddle Canals, scoured the Haunted\
  \ Hills, and stormed the Citadel of Xerkas Xaan. But the day after our greatest\
  \ triumph, he deserted us—taking the treasure with him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And this\
  \ treasure is what you think he had when he died?\"</p> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Warming to the subject, the dwarf puffed out his chest and paced the\
  \ room, gesticulating with the axe. \"Oh, what that cost us! We fought giants, demons,\
  \ mind-eaters. Upon entering the Demonsweald's innermost crypt, the best of us all,\
  \ Corin the Bright, was beheaded by a trap. Which Aruhal thereupon disarmed.\" Jordyar\
  \ stomped into the hallway, then returned, holding aloft the strange doorknocker\
  \ that had tweaked Luma's curiosity on her way in. \"This! This is the flying ring\
  \ that sliced through Corin's neck. I can't believe that he would take that and\
  \ display it on his door, as if mocking the memory—\" A frustrated groan caught\
  \ in Jordyar's throat. He backhanded the ring away; it lodged, quivering, in the\
  \ wooden lintel of the sitting room's doorway. A fresh flush of crimson rose through\
  \ his face. \"So yes, Aruhal owes me. This treasure, we had a deal to sell it for\
  \ a wagonload of gold. Enough to forever conclude my grubbing and sweating, sleeping\
  \ in cold crypts with the doors spiked shut, fighting for rest as ghouls and bloodsuckers\
  \ scratch at the sill. To retire for good and all, on the one great score every\
  \ looter dreams of. That is the life Jordyar deserved. The life that Aruhal plucked\
  \ from my grasp!\"</span></p> \n   <p>He lunged at the cabinet where Seriza quietly\
  \ wept. </p> \n   <p>Luma stepped up, her sickle drawn. After a moment of tension,\
  \ the dwarf relented, sticking his axe in his belt. He stretched out open hands,\
  \ as if ready to grab Luma by the front of her tunic. His eyes glistened. \"You\
  \ must let me question her. He must have told her. Our customer never bought it\
  \ from him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Or so they told you,\" Luma ventured.</p> \n   <p>Jordyar\
  \ wiped his nose with the back of his liver-spotted hand. \"Or so they did. But\
  \ they say that even now they will buy it, if I can produce it. It changes nothing—\
  he either sold it and has the gold, or kept it. And it is mine.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  And if he did keep it, what is it, exactly? A magical relic?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Scarcely.\
  \ A historical curio—a reliquary containing the ashes and bones of a saint: the\
  \ holy warrior Lovag. A globe of gold, studded with gems. It would be worth much\
  \ to a collector, but more to the church.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Which church?\"</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ontor.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ontor_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    <br> Jordyar's glory days are behind him.\n   </div> \n   <p>Jordyar's\
  \ snort sent spittle flying. \"So you can sell it to them when you find it? You\
  \ take me for a fool, girl.\" He twitched, as if realizing he'd given away too much\
  \ already by naming the saint.</p> \n   <p>\"I'm not here for this treasure,\" Luma\
  \ said. \"I'm here to find out who killed Aruhal.\" </p> \n   <p>\"No one killed\
  \ Aruhal,\" Seriza sobbed, white fingers clutched around the cabinet. \"I told you\
  \ that already. It was pleurisy—a pain when he breathed. It just got worse, until...\"\
  \ She trailed off into another burst of tears.</p> \n   <p>Jordyar angled for a\
  \ better view of her. \"You look a pretty creature. You don't propose to tell me\
  \ a wretch like Aruhal caught a wench like you without a great bag of gold swinging\
  \ over his shoulder?\"</p> \n   <p>The widow's face froze into a wordless plea directed\
  \ at Luma. Its meaning was clear: please get him out of here.</p> \n   <p>Luma again\
  \ stepped between the widow and the dwarf. \"It sounds like you had all the reason\
  \ in the world to kill Aruhal.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You speak truth there.\" He spat\
  \ onto the bare floor, just missing the boar's hide rug.</p> \n   <p>Luma crossed\
  \ her arms. \"But you want me to believe you didn't.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm done answering\
  \ your questions. That one will tell me where it is—gold or relic, I'm taking it\
  \ now.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I don't know anything about any relic,\" Seriza sniffled.\
  \ \"And as for gold—look around you. I can't see how I'll afford to fix that door.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Aruhal never had money?\" the dwarf asked.</p> \n   <p>\"A little.\
  \ At first. He worked as a locksmith. It wasn't money I loved him for.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Jordyar bellowed out a laugh. \"Then he was holding out on you, too.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Luma crowded him. \"So why didn't you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Why didn't I what?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Kill him.\"</p> \n   <p>Trepidation flashed across the dwarf's face.\
  \ \"I'm not the swine he was.\" He flexed his shoulders, regaining his composure.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Luma twined a lock of her hair between her fingers—a habit her family's\
  \ scolding had never quite cured her of. \"I don't think that's it.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Matters not to me what you think.\" Jordyar knocked on the nearest wall. \"I should\
  \ tear this place apart.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You're not going to do that,\" Luma said.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Jordyar stiffened. \"Is that so?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma let her fingers brush\
  \ against her trickbag.</p> \n   <p>The dwarf took it in. \"A magicker, are we?\
  \ What kind?\"</p> \n   <p>\"You don't want to find out,\" said Luma. Depending\
  \ on how tough the dwarf was, it was either a well-calibrated act of intimidation,\
  \ or a reckless bluff.</p> \n   <p>Jordyar wove past her to address Seriza. \"This\
  \ is all a shock to you. Your husband dying and now this.\" He gestured to the broken\
  \ door as if it were a catastrophe unconnected to himself. \"I approached this too\
  \ strong, didn't I? I believe you when you say you had no inkling of the relic.\
  \ Or the gold your rodent of a spouse sold it for. So I'm telling you this.\" He\
  \ jabbed his leather-gloved finger at her. \"You cogitate long and hard on where\
  \ Aruhal might have stashed a pile of gold, or a treasure about yay big.\" With\
  \ open hands about a foot apart, he mimed a roughly globular object. \"Because there's\
  \ no chance in hell that he doesn't have it. Maybe he tried to tell you, when he\
  \ was sick. Search your mind for clues of that nature. Because in forty-eight hours,\
  \ I'll be back, and I'll take what Aruhal stole from me. Or you'll have more to\
  \ mourn than your husband. Understand?\"</p> \n   <p>Seriza said nothing—a rabbit\
  \ transfixed by a snake.</p> \n   <p>He poked Luma's shoulder. \"And if you want\
  \ to test your spells against my axe then, you're welcome to try.\" He stamped for\
  \ the door, reclaiming the sharpened ring from the lintel on the way out.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Luma rushed to the window. Jordyar had turned westward, toward a main thoroughfare,\
  \ the Avenue of Honors. He proceeded with the attentive uncertainty of a visitor.\
  \ Consulting her mental map of the city, Luma plotted a route of alleyways. If she\
  \ got going right away, she might well beat him to the high street, and trail him\
  \ unseen from there. She plunged into Seriza's kitchen and out the back exit. The\
  \ widow called after her, either asking why she was following the dwarf, or asking\
  \ who would pay for the door. Luma didn't attempt a reply.</p> \n   <p>On the second\
  \ question, it was not up to the Derexhi family to pay Jordyar's reparations. As\
  \ to the first, the old adventurer knew more than he was saying. Were there anything\
  \ here to investigate, the path to it could well lead through him. Missing treasure\
  \ certainly sounded like a motive for murder. </p> \n   <p>There was more to hear\
  \ from the widow, too, but that would have to wait. Luma knew where to find her.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Reaching the Avenue, she spotted Jordyar's head bobbing between a pair\
  \ of laggardly porters carrying wine crates for a doddering master. Luma wished\
  \ she had her brother Ontor with her—shadowing was both safer and easier with two.\
  \ Still, her street-honed instincts kept the dwarf in sight, and he showed little\
  \ propensity for looking back. The fat-purses and liveried servants who populated\
  \ the street at this hour gave wide berth to her battle-ready, fuming subject. Picking\
  \ up speed as he stomped along, he passed hawkers, criers, and store guards, merchants,\
  \ traders, and grandees. He traversed the length of the avenue, turning at the Pediment\
  \ Building and continuing down the long stone slope that served as the bypass for\
  \ the Seacleft, the great cliff dividing the city into high and low, the Summit\
  \ and the Shore.</p> \n   <p>From its base, the dwarf wended through the clamorous\
  \ Bazaar of Sails, bypassing stalls and skirting around tents. A trio of urchins,\
  \ in the sparkling glad-rags of the Varisian minority, chased a fist-sized jewel\
  \ bug into his path. Jordyar roared at them, sending them scattering. Luma halted;\
  \ his swivel to shout curses at the children placed her in his line of sight. But\
  \ he seemed not to notice her, and continued on. Heedless of Luma's pursuit, he\
  \ plunged into Dockway's narrow streets, lined by salt-crusted depots and sturdy\
  \ taverns.</p> \n   <p>Abruptly abandoning her chase, Luma darted into an alleyway\
  \ between an alehouse and a whorehouse and drew her sickle. As soon as she was past\
  \ its threshold, she pressed her back against the crumbling brick of the tavern\
  \ wall. A rake-thin man clad all in black, from boots to leggings to tunic to skullcap,\
  \ hustled in after her. She thrust out the sickle, wrapping its curving edge around\
  \ his ankle. As she pulled it up, she twisted the blade, so that it would trip him\
  \ without cutting into his leg. He fell into the wall, bashing his snowy-bearded\
  \ chin against the brick, and tumbled to the ground. Luma leapt onto his back, pinning\
  \ him with her knee, and pressed her blade around his throat, positioned for a slaughtering\
  \ cut.</p> \n   <p>\"Who are you?\" she asked, \"and why are you following me?\"\
