  \ itemprop=\"description\">Hello everyone, and happy December! This blog is a week\
  \ later than usual because I’ve just returned from PAX Unplugged, which was a tremendous\
  \ success! It was our first visit since 2019, as well as my first visit overall,\
  \ so I wasn’t sure what to expect. My worst fear was that nobody would be interested\
  \ in our games, and we’d be sitting around all day bored out of our skulls.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I am delighted to report that we had the exact <em>opposite</em> problem.\
  \ We got a <em>ton</em> of attention from attendees, many of whom were excited to\
  \ talk about the Pathfinder Remaster and pick up the newest books. Our retail partner,\
  \ Card Titan, ran out of books by the end of the show!</p>\n      <p>But by far\
  \ the biggest star throughout was Starfinder 2! We ran alpha demos of the game,\
  \ which were a roaring success. We had attendees waiting <em>hours</em> in line\
  \ to play, and everyone who walked away from the table was excited about the new\
  \ edition. I can’t wait until we get to start showing it off to a wider audience!</p>\n\
  \      <p>With that said, let’s dive into our update!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Digital\
  \ Adventure Releases</h2>\n      <p>These adventures will be available on December\
  \ 20, 2023.</p>\n      <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>\n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02es7?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-508-Protecting-the-Firelight\"\

  \ of a subscription</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Lorespire Wiki</h2>\n      <p>Last\
  \ month, the hosting for the Guides to Organized Play went down for a couple of\
  \ very chaotic weeks. I’m delighted to announce that they are back online in their\
  \ new home, the <a href=\"http://lorespire.paizo.com/\">Lorespire Wiki</a>! You\
  \ can access this wiki at <strong>lorespire.paizo.com</strong>. This is a Paizo-hosted\
  \ server, so it should remain online for as long as the rest of our website is.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Our Guide Team has been hard at work both restoring service and updating\
  \ the Pathfinder Society Guide to be in line with the Remaster. In coming weeks\
  \ we’ll also be looking at hosting additional resources here, such as region homepages\
  \ to help players find games. Stay tuned for new and exciting things on this front!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Pathfinder Remaster</h2>\n      <p>The Pathfinder Remaster\
  \ launched last month to great success! The books have been flying off the warehouse\
  \ shelves, and Pathfinder Society characters are converting like never before! A\
  \ reminder that the guidelines for these changes are available on the <a href=\"\
  https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Pathfinder-2e-Remaster\"\
  >Lorespire Wiki</a>.</p>\n      <p>We’ve made a couple of updates to the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\">Character Options</a> and\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq\">FAQ pages</a> since the launch,\
  \ so be sure to keep an eye on those for future changes. Thank you all for your\
  \ patience and understanding, and for your helpful questions in the forum threads\
  \ as we stamp out any issues. It’s our hope that all this work will make the launch\
  \ of <em>Player Core 2</em>next summer as smooth as possible.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>2024 Major Conventions</h2>\n      <p>This is just a heads-up that very\
  \ soon, we’ll be soliciting GMs for PaizoCon Online as well as Gen Con Indy! Stay\
  \ tuned to the Paizo blog for more information on this in January but mark your\
  \ calendars now. We’re hoping to make both conventions better than ever before,\
  \ and to do that we need talented volunteers like you!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>GM\
  \ Recognition</h2>\n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>\n      <p>This month,\
  \ several new Campaign Service Coins were awarded at local conventions! We award\
  \ these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide\
  \ an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based\
  \ on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this\
  \ award (whether they are a Venture Officer or not), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com\
  \ with their name and the reasons they deserve the award.</p>\n      <p>Congratulations\
  \ to:<br><strong>Wally Waltner</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID\
  \ #872<br><strong>Barb Crase</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #901<br>\n\
  \        and <strong>Nicholas Ruchlewicz</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin\
  \ and OP ID #906</p>\n      <h3>GM Ranks</h3>\n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or\
  \ glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of\
  \ time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least\
  \ 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 must be special scenarios, as well as run between\
  \ one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate\
  \ of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>\n      <p>This\
  \ month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>\n      <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>:\
  \ Doug Edwards (our third 5/5/5 GM!)</p>\n      <br>\n      <p>That’s all from me!\
  \ Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! I’ll see you next year!</p>\n  \
