  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Do you want to hear a scary story?</p> \n \
  \    <p>It all began on a cold, dreary winter's night. A thin mist covered the ground,\
  \ and the streetlights did little to pierce the gloom. Most people were in their\
  \ homes, huddling under blankets, sipping warm cocoa, and basking in the comforting\
  \ glow of their television sets. Most sane people, that is. But one man shunned\
  \ the comforts of the hearth to sit hunched over a laptop, typing furiously. The\
  \ computer's sickly light emphasized his haggard appearance, making him look more\
  \ like an animated corpse than a living person. He composed an unhinged manifesto\
  \ of shadowy horrors, blood-curdling mutilations, and the seductive nature of evil.\
  \ And when he was done, he slumped across the keyboard dead asleep, not caring about\
  \ the nightmares that would most assuredly come.</p> \n     <p>â€¦That man, dear reader,\
  \ was yours truly! *lightning flashes* *thunder rumbles* And that screed I wrote\
  \ was none other than the outline for the upcoming <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams\"\
  >Signal of Screams Adventure Path</a>! *more lightning and thunder* *also, a wolf\
  \ howls in the distance for some reason*</p> \n     <p>Seriously though, this three-part\
  \ space horror Adventure Path is the first Starfinder product that I had the pleasure\
  \ of concepting and developing from start to finish, and I couldn't be prouder or\
  \ more excited to share it with you. While I didn't actually spend any late nights\
  \ putting it all together, I couldn't have done it without the entire Starfinder\
  \ team (who helped brainstorm the spookiest of ideas) and all the terrific authors\
  \ that agreed to work on this project! And of course, I can't forget the artists\
  \ who helped bring these chilling visions to life, as well as the art, editing,\
  \ and other departments here at Paizo that make sure you get the best product possible!</p>\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The first adventure, <a href=\"/products/btq01vb2?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-10-The-Diaspora-Strain\"\
  ><i>The Diaspora Strain</i></a>, comes out very soon and sees a group of 7th-level\
  \ characters get invited to the grand re-opening of a luxury resort asteroid in\
  \ the Diaspora called New Elysium. The facility has been newly automated with a\
  \ virtual intelligence program and the PCs, along with a handful of celebrities,\
  \ will be the first guests to put the system to the test. I don't want to spoil\
  \ any surprises, but of course, things don't go quite as planned. Author (and fellow\
  \ Adventure Path developer) Chris Sims has put together a spooky adventure that\
  \ will have player characters question their sanity.</p> \n     <p>In addition to\
  \ some creepy new monsters and details on a lonely world accessible only through\
  \ the Drift, this first volume features an article about a corruption system new\
  \ to Starfinder that will get used throughout the campaign (by me) and advice on\
  \ to run and play in Starfinder horror adventures by Epidiah Ravachol, author of\
  \ the very popular indie horror RPG Dread!</p> \n     <p>What is the mysterious\
  \ Signal of Screams? Find out this winter, if you dare!</p> \n     <p>Jason Keeley<br>\
