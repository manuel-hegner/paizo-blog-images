  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">An arc of electricity shorted\
  \ whatever communication device the void-eyed figure was wearing as Seltyiel’s sword\
  \ slid through it, cutting yet another one down. Black shadows clung to his blade,\
  \ dulling its shine. His face morphed into a mask of disgust for a moment before\
  \ the sound of shattering glass drew his attention.</p>\n      <p>“I’d like to ask\
  \ again—where are we and what the hell are these things?” He hissed.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>“Whenever we have a moment to breathe, I’ll work on an answer.” Kyra’s voice\
  \ was cool and calm with an edge of humor to it—Seltyiel could tell from the curve\
  \ of her mouth that she was teasing him in that friendly way of hers. But there\
  \ was worry in her expression too as she burned a hole through another of the empty-eyed\
  \ creatures, leaving a smoking, shimmering ember in its core as it fell.</p>\n \
  \     <p>“Tsk.” With a snort and a click of his tongue, Seltyiel accepted her answer.\
  \ The creatures’ faces were identical, and while their bodies seemed solid enough,\
  \ they melted into shadow when he cut them down. “Copies are never a good sign.”\
  </p>\n      <p>“Neither is this.” Kyra gestured down the hallway the creatures had\
  \ slunk down, drawing his attention to the path of draining color everywhere they\
  \ had touched, the imprint of their footsteps growing by inches and degrees. “Especially\
  \ not if we are where I think we are.”</p>\n      <p>“Oh, you’ve got that answer?\
  \ That might be the best news I’ve heard since we got here,” Seltyiel quipped. He\
  \ adjusted his grip on his sword, watching the door at the end of the hall, hearing\
  \ the distant crashes of destruction.</p>\n      <p>A sigh escaped Kyra’s lips as\
  \ she uttered a quick prayer, watching the bleached skin melt off one of the foes\
  \ she’d blasted, revealing a shadowy mass underneath. “Normally, I would agree with\
  \ you. This place is special—if I am right—and I would be thrilled to find myself\
  \ here. But to see what these monsters are doing to the Radiant Palace of Possibility?\
  \ It makes me sick.”</p>\n      <p>The words brushed against a thread of memory:\
  \ a book on a table years ago, candlelight barely warming the words on the page.\
  \ A mythological place, said to have been spun into existence by the Radiant Prism\
  \ themselves, an intersection at the point where all threads of reality met and\
  \ reflected each other. A boundless demiplane ruled only by love. A horrible place\
  \ to be shattering under the invasion of same-faced undead.</p>\n      <p>“Divinity’\
  s not much my business—I’ll leave that to you. But I agree that this needs to be\
  \ stopped.” Seltyiel was not entirely sure how to stop a seemingly endless onslaught\
  \ of copycat ghosts, though.</p>\n      <p><em>Find their source and rout them out.\
  \ </em></p>\n      <p>The whispers on the edges of his consciousness urged him forward\
  \ down the hall, closer to the source of the sounds. Gritting his teeth, Seltyiel\
  \ gestured with his blade. “Something’s happening over there.”</p>\n      <p>Following\
  \ the trail of sapped color as panes of iridescent crystal turned dull, murky gray,\
  \ Seltyiel led the way further into the palace, Kyra watchful at his back. As they\
  \ approached, the sounds of destruction grew louder, crashing off the walls.</p>\n\
  \      <p>So focused on hunting the trail that the whispers were guiding him toward,\
  \ Seltyiel bit his tongue in shock when Kyra pulled him back behind a pillar of\
  \ crystal as hurried footsteps approached. She hid them just in time. A priestess,\
  \ garbed in robes of rainbow silk that seemed to be losing color with each step,\
  \ streaked out from behind cover and ran for the doorway. She stumbled and was caught\
  \ by the two ghosts behind her. Her starknife clattered to the floor and she screamed.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Before either Seltyiel or Kyra could react, the undead pulled her face\
  \ from her body, her skin slithering up the figure’s arm to settle atop its own\
  \ skull, framing the void eyes with the priestess’s final expression of terror.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Join us. Welcome to the fleet. We are one, we are all,” the monster wearing\
  \ her face said in a thousand voices.</p>\n      <p>The voices that came from the\
  \ creature’s mouth spoke in unison without feeling. The priestess’s stolen face\
  \ turned empty and blank as the monster reached down, shadows and void energy pouring\
  \ into her corpse. The void slid over her body, consuming her and erasing the marred\
  \ flesh of her face into an empty space.</p>\n      <p>The two creatures pulled\
  \ her to her feet, one of them handing her another mechanical device—a firearm,\
  \ but not like one Seltyiel had ever seen—and marching her back to the central chamber.\
  \ She was now a member of their ranks.</p>\n      <p>“Everlight, keep us safe while\
  \ we rescue the servant of your beloved Starsong.” Kyra’s prayer was quiet and whispered,\
  \ her hand gently touching Seltyiel’s shoulder and carrying with it the soft warmth\
  \ of sunlight. He knew she meant to fight. But first they needed to know more about\
  \ the enemy.</p>\n      <p>Taking a breath, Seltyiel drew a sigil with his free\
  \ hand, his body shimmering out of view as he snuck into the central chamber, scoping\
  \ out the field. A large airship—far more technologically advanced than anything\
  \ he had ever witnessed—dominated the center of the room, surrounded by dozens of\
  \ uniform-clad undead wearing the same masked face over empty eyes. Closest to the\
  \ ship, presumably giving the orders, were several floating heads in glass baubles\
  \ held aloft by a tiny propeller, with no bodies save for the spindly metal limbs\
  \ that hung down from their chassis. Strange, angular runes shimmered down one of\
  \ their limbs as the floating head hissed a spell in a language that sounded suspiciously\
  \ like Necril, the tongue of undead on his world.</p>\n      <p>The faceless creatures\
  \ awaited their orders, some platoons already set on destroying the shaped crystal\
  \ and mirror glass, leaving colorless clutter in their wake. Blood splattered on\
  \ the floor was the only sign remaining of any resistance, their corpses recruited\
  \ to join in the very destruction they hoped to prevent.</p>\n      <p>Seltyiel\
  \ returned to their hiding spot behind the crystalline pillar, expression grim.\
  \ “I don’t like our odds. Two of us, hundreds of them—and they can just keep making\
  \ more.”</p>\n      <p>“The surest way to lose is to give up before we’ve started.\
  \ We are in a holy place—there is power here those creatures cannot hope to understand.\
  \ We need only reach out and tap into it.”</p>\n      <p>Seltyiel bit back a snarky\
  \ remark as a shockwave rattled the chamber. One of the crystalline chandeliers\
  \ collapsed into millions of shards—crushing an entire squad of faceless troopers.\
  \ None of them flinched. After all, units were expendable in pursuit of the overall\
  \ goal.</p>\n      <p>“Don’t let those things take my face when I die.” Seltyiel\
  \ shifted his weight back and forth, adjusting his grip on his sword and waiting\
  \ for Kyra’s nod before hurrying into the room, leaping into a platoon of the faceless.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The glowing arc of Kyra’s scimitar cut through a line of undead as she\
  \ followed suit, each of them now surrounded by encroaching hordes of empty-eyed,\
  \ hollow masked creatures with blank smiles on their faces.</p>\n      <p>“Abandon\
  \ yourself. Become one. Become us. You are nothing. We are all.”</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ words came from nowhere and everywhere and made Seltyiel’s stomach turn, anger\
  \ flaring up in the pit of his stomach as he feinted left and swung right, slicing\
  \ directly through one of the creatures and watching it dissipate into nothing.</p>\n\
  \      <p>They were wrong—he wasn’t nothing. But two individuals against a sea of\
  \ endless copies could only hold out so long.</p>\n      <p>“Looks like we’re late\
  \ to the party!”</p>\n      <p>An unfamiliar voice sounded from a balcony above.\
  \ The faceless turned to seek out the new life force, giving both Seltyiel and Kyra\
  \ an opportunity for a quick series of blows and a moment to breathe.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>A human woman in sleek diamond armor and a catfolk figure dressed in wildly\
  \ colorful garb stood on the balcony. Somehow, Seltyiel knew the catfolk wasn’t\
  \ an amurrun from his world, but a <em>pahtra</em> from somewhere else. The human\
  \ pointed another strange firearm down at the faceless horde and the pahtra cracked\
  \ what appeared to be a ribbon made of fire. The glee in their catlike face was\
  \ unmistakable, sharp teeth flashing in a grin. “Come and get me, Corpse Fleet clones!\
  \ First one to the mirror gets an autograph!”</p>\n      <p>The pahtra jumped off\
  \ the balcony with a graceful flip, landing on their feet in front of a trio of\
  \ mirrors. The moment they landed a rainbow aura surrounded them, making it almost\
  \ impossible to look away as thousands of different reflections appeared in the\
  \ mirrors’ faces.</p>\n      <p>Beams of red fire streaked down from above as the\
  \ human shot her gun—a laser pistol, Seltyiel thought, but how did he know that?—\
  and pointed at her ally’s position with her free hand. “Get over there!”</p>\n \
  \     <p>Under the cover of laser fire that singed the air like a spray of <em>blazing\
  \ bolts</em>, Kyra and Seltyiel dashed across the room past dazed faceless to the\
  \ mirrors where the pahtra stood. “I’m Dae, that’s Navasi. You look like hot garbage,\
  \ but I love your ‘fits,” the pahtra said cheerfully. “Are they vintage? Oh, and\
  \ I hope you don’t mind, but I’m recording right now.” They beamed at a tiny mechanical\
  \ device hovering overhead that Selytiel had only just noticed.</p>\n      <p>Seltyiel\
  \ faced the mirror to see what Dae was talking about. He and Kyra were panting,\
  \ cut up, and bloody. Color had been sapped from their torn clothing. His hair was\
  \ disheveled and not in a fetching way. Their reflections looked a mess for a moment,\
  \ but then the images in the mirror began to change.</p>\n      <p>“My name is Seltyiel,”\
  \ he said. “We appreciate your intervention.”</p>\n      <p>“I am Kyra.” Kyra clasped\
  \ Dae’s hand. “I can see the Everlight shining in you. Thank you for your help.”\
  </p>\n      <p>The warping visions of himself pulled Seltyiel’s eyes back to the\
  \ mirrors, and he didn’t notice Navasi dash over to the group, pursued by more faceless\
  \ undead.</p>\n      <p>“The mirror—” he started to say, but it was already too\
  \ late. As each hero turned to face the multifaceted, multidimensional crystal wall,\
  \ they were shocked by what they saw. The mirrors showed more than just their reflections.\
  \ Infinite versions of themselves borrowed from memories and dreams and other realities\
  \ fractalized in the shining crystal.</p>\n      <p>Navasi watched herself cock\
  \ her gun with a wicked smile in one facet, clench bloody credsticks in a robotic\
  \ fist in another, and press a kiss to a blue-skinned woman’s cheek in a third.\
  \ In yet another facet, she walked beside a handsome diplomat dressed to the nines\
  \ as his security detail and date all in one. The many versions of Navasi were all\
  \ equally complicated and stunning, and she watched with delight as a troupe of\
  \ her other selves talked their way into—and out of—infinite situations.</p>\n \
  \     <p>Every Dae was in the spotlight. They performed old-timey canticles clad\
  \ in spectacular costume at Golarion World, backflipped into a ribbon spiral in\
  \ front of a cheering audience, sunned themself in the viewport of a solar yacht,\
  \ and seamlessly rescued a crowd of fans from armed attackers without missing a\
  \ step of their dance routine. And of course, Dae’s kaleidoscope included their\
  \ moody bestie. In one mirror, the two piloted a mech together cutting down colossi\
  \ with a gigantic chainsword and powered glaive.</p>\n      <p>Seltyiel bit back\
  \ a sneer as he made eye contact with the many broken, beaten versions of himself—\
  past, present, and future. But there were more facets behind that. He saw a proud\
  \ man holding an ornate blade, electricity arcing up and down its length; there\
  \ was a cozy candlelit chamber, Seltyiel’s reflection bent to a book as a beautiful\
  \ yet unfamiliar man fell asleep beside him, snuggled against his side; Seltyiel\
  \ stealing a last sharp kiss from a lover turned enemy, her dagger gleaming across\
  \ his cheekbone as he pulled away to toss a ball of gleaming magic, its trail pointing\
  \ directly to the heart of the devil it struck. Power, magic, anger, affection,\
  \ and more feelings than Seltyiel had words for coursed through him as he grappled\
  \ with his many reflections.</p>\n      <p>Kyra’s mirrored selves were all limned\
  \ in fire. The Everlight illuminated a glimpse of every world that she had the luck\
  \ and joy to live in: simple, humble Kyra who served a rural temple in threadbare\
  \ robes; a radiant woman touched with godhood, fire in her hair and sunlight pouring\
  \ from her eyes; her scimitar cutting through a ghoul just as Merisiel’s blade found\
  \ its head, pulling the creature’s body in two directions; Kyra as a blushing bride\
  \ in ceremonial robes joining hands with the same, now her wife. Though the images\
  \ had no sound, Kyra could hear Merisiel’s precious laughter in her memory. <em>“\
  Here, you are all infinite. Now you can become every version of yourself.” </em>Kyra\
  \ recognized the Voice speaking—her goddess Sarenrae, the Everlight, who formed\
  \ the Radiant Prism with goddesses Desna and Shelyn as a divine expression of their\
  \ romantic relationship.</p>\n      <p>Curious and compelled, Seltyiel watched Dae,\
  \ Kyra, and Navasi touch the crystal mirrors. Rainbows swirled around them and their\
  \ forms blurred. He’d rather die alone than become part of the shadow army pillaging\
  \ this palace, but those weren’t his only choices. He reached for the mirror. For\
  \ a moment, all witnessed a sight most mortals could only dream of. The reflections\
  \ melted away and were replaced by a trio of goddesses, fingers intertwined as they\
  \ held hands. Anyone in the Universe would know them—Sarenrae, a burning star forged\
  \ into a woman’s form; Desna, a moth-winged alien with elfin ears and a fickle smile;\
  \ Shelyn, beauty made flesh with rainbow hair and a tender smile.</p>\n      <p>They\
  \ blew the heroes a triple kiss that floated on butterfly wings, exploding into\
  \ a visual cacophony of sparks and mirrors. All the reflections of the heroes poured\
  \ into them, filling them with light and power.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The Radiant Prism was gone but their power thrummed\
  \ in Seltyiel’s veins. He and his allies turned from the mirrors feeling stronger\
  \ than ever before. Where their footsteps fell, the gray, conforming magic of the\
  \ invaders was pushed back, replaced with radiant color.</p>\n      <p>Defiant grins\
  \ on their faces, Seltyiel, Kyra, Navasi, and Dae held their weapons aloft, free\
  \ hands ready to cast or block. Their very silhouettes seemed to shift and morph,\
  \ vibrating with the power of their alternate selves as they clashed with the faceless\
  \ troops, tearing through them with ease. Copies are never a match for the real\
  \ thing.</p>\n      <p>Seltyiel grinned as the last foe dissolved in a wisp of smoke.\
  \ Only the bodies of the doomed priestess and siblings of her order remained, slumped\
  \ on the floor and already stirring as color leeched back into their garments and\
  \ their faces reformed from emptiness. The airship—or starship, as Dae would correct\
  \ him later—had blinked out of space, leaving a hole in the palace wall that was\
  \ already starting to repair itself. Gentle music replaced the harsh sounds of battle\
  \ and conquest.</p>\n      <p>Seltyiel’s eyelids fluttered as the same music soothed\
  \ over his mind, returning him to sleep where his body and spirit could slip out\
  \ of the Radiant Palace of Possibility back to his own home, his own time. Later\
  \ he’d ask Kyra about the dream, and she’d remember it the same way, down to the\
  \ last detail. He couldn’t ask Dae and Navasi, but he was sure they were out there\
  \ somewhere, changed by their adventure.</p>\n      <p>He was sure they must feel\
  \ it too—the echo of the encounter lingering, a thrumming mantra in his mind.</p>\n\
