  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi Pathfinders!</p> \n     <p>Familiars and\
  \ animal companions are loyal allies that can be of great assistance to your PCs.\
  \ Adjudicating rules around them can get messy, however, particularly in an organized\
  \ campaign like the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild</a>. When we updated the Pathfinder Society FAQ a few months ago, we left\
  \ a big \"We'll get back to this\" at the top of the question regarding familiars\
  \ and magic item use. We knew this was going to be a hugely time-consuming project,\
  \ so we enlisted help from a team of community members: Lau Bannenberg, Steven Lau,\
  \ Bradley McTeer, and Roger Sidebotham. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to\
  \ pull together a comprehensive guide to every magic-item related question we could\
  \ think of for familiars. In addition to updating the list of who can use wands,\
  \ we tackled the thorny question of magic item slots. Many hours of \"Does a floating\
  \ head have different magic item slots than a floating helmet?\" later, we created\
  \ a magic item slot chart for every familiar that it is possible to acquire in the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n     <p>All of this information will\
  \ appear on the FAQ soon, along with a few other smaller updates. For now, here\
  \ it is, spoilered for length.</p> \n     <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"> \n   \
  \   <p style=\"display: inline; padding-right: 5px;\"><b>Can my familiar wield weapons\
  \ or use magic items?</b></p> \n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"\
  spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\"> \n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"\
  > \n       <p>By default, familiars do not have any magic item slots, but they can\
  \ unlock magic item slots associated with their respective body shape. See below\
  \ for a list of which body slots each familiar is eligible to unlock. To unlock\
  \ a magic item slot, a familiar must take the Extra Item Slot feat, which appears\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8w7p?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Animal-Archive\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Animal Archive</em></a> and will be reprinted in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> as of version 9.0. In the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild, familiars of all body shapes may take this feat, including\
  \ humanoid-shaped familiars. When you gain a familiar, you may exchange one of its\
  \ feats for Extra Item Slot for free. Familiars may also carry slotless magic items\
  \ and activate ioun stones.</p> \n       <p>The following chart specifies the magic\
  \ item slots that each familiar can unlock. Available slots followed by either (saddle)\
  \ or (horseshoes) denote that creatures of that body type can only wear magic items\
  \ in those slots if they are saddles or horseshoes, respectively. Creatures without\
  \ these notes cannot wear saddles or horseshoes. Celestial, entropic, fiendish,\
  \ and resolute familiars use the same slots as typical animals of their kind.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>All familiars can activate the abilities of their use-activated magic\
  \ items, so long as these abilities do not require a command word. The following\
  \ familiars can use spell trigger and spell completion magic items, including wands\
  \ and scrolls, as well as magic items with a command word: arbiter, brownie, cassisian\
  \ (in small humanoid form), faerie dragon, imp, leshy (any), liminal sprite, lyrakien,\
  \ mephit (any type), nosoi, nuglub, pooka, pyrausta, quasit, shikigami, soulbound\
  \ doll, sprite, and zhyen. For more information on these magic item categories,\
  \ see page 456 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a>.</p> \n       <p>Familiars in categories\
  \ marked with an asterisk (*) are able to grasp and carry one object at a time in\
  \ their paws, claws, or hands, including weapons, rods, wands, and staves, as long\
  \ as their carrying capacity is sufficient. Most familiars cannot wield weapons\
  \ in combat. The following familiars can wield weapons: arbiter, brownie, cassisian\
  \ (in small humanoid form), imp, leshy (any), liminal sprite, lyrakien, mephit (any),\
  \ nuglub, pooka, quasit, shikigami, soulbound doll, sprite, and zhyen.</p> \n  \
  \     <p>Some familiars have natural shapeshifting ability. One of the most striking\
  \ cases is the cassisian familiar, which is listed below in both its humanoid form\
  \ and its helmet form. Whenever a familiar changes from a form that has access to\
  \ a magic item slot into a form that does not, the item melded into its body. A\
  \ melded item provides no benefits. For familiars that can take the shapes of animals,\
  \ use the standard item categories for that animal listed below.</p> \n       <p>Please\
  \ review <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/rpg/additional\">Additional Resources</a>\
  \ before selecting a familiar. Some of the listed familiars are only legal choices\
  \ if your character has a Chronicle sheet boon or an archetype that grants access\
  \ to them.</p> \n       <blockquote> \n        <p><b>Arbiter* (eyes, hand, headband,\
