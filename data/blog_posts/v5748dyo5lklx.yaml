  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">By now many of you have heard that Paizo's launching\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">a playtest for a second edition of Pathfinder\
  \ RPG</a>. This sort of news inspires all sorts of questions, so be sure you've\
  \ checked out the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest/faq#v5748eaic9wes\">Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ FAQ</a>. In short, Paizo will release the playtest book, pdf, and a playtest adventure\
  \ at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con 2018</a>, gathering\
  \ your input to revise the game and release it in full at Gen Con 2019.</p> \n \
  \    <p>A new edition inspires changes in other programs, including <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. When the new edition releases in August\
  \ 2019, we will be launching a Pathfinder Society campaign using the new rules.\
  \ Scenarios from that month onward will use the new edition, but that doesn't stop\
  \ you from continuing to play first edition adventures (hundreds scenarios and dozens\
  \ of sanctioned modules and Adventure Paths) with your first edition PCs.</p> \n\
  \     <p>We answer a lot of preliminary questions in <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest/faq#v5748eaic9wfp\"\
  >the Pathfinder Society section of the FAQ</a>, but there's a lot more to creating\
  \ a new campaign than nine questions can detail. Over the next few weeks we'll be\
  \ sharing more information and soliciting feedback on much more. After all, we've\
  \ had a long time to consider strategies, but we've had only a little more than\
  \ a week to discuss the matter with the community without spoiling the announcement.\
  \ And discussion's an important part of the equation for organized play community;\
  \ we thrive on incorporating player, GM, and organizer feedback into our decisions\
  \ to ensure the most fair and fun experience.</p> \n     <p>So lets look at some\
  \ preliminary answers together.</p> \n     <h2>Lessons from Starfinder Society</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>By the time we began creating the Starfinder Society campaign—with much\
  \ of the heavy lifting done by Thurston Hillman—everyone on the team had years of\
  \ playing in, designing for, and managing the Pathfinder Society campaign. This\
  \ was also our first time building an organized play campaign largely from the ground\
  \ up, and it was gratifying to identify what had worked and what hadn't aged well\
  \ in order to create a great program. In saying this, I do want to dispel one myth:\
  \ Starfinder Society wasn't a prototype for a second edition Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign. It represented our creating a great organized play campaign informed\
  \ by hard-learned lessons and years of inspiration. As we look toward creating a\
  \ new Pathfinder Society campaign, we're learning from both the first edition experiences\
  \ and Starfinder Society's success to create another great organized play program.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So what's worked well for Starfinder Society? Short answer's \"A whole\
  \ lot of things,\" and the team's impression is that many of these could work very\
  \ well in Pathfinder Society, too. Let's break that down into subtopics. </p>\n\
  \     <p><b>Smaller Tiers</b>: Pathfinder Society's first edition uses a 5-level\
  \ spread for its tiers (e.g. Tier 1-5), breaking that into two subtiers (e.g. Subtiers\
  \ 1-2 and 4-5). Although this has worked well from the perspective of allowing as\
  \ many characters as possible to play each adventure, it leaves an awkward out-of-subtier\
  \ gap. Also, the wider the level range, the easier it is for someone on the low\
  \ end of that range to end up facing a wildly overpowering foe in the higher subtier;\
  \ the same's true for very high level PCs practically walking over low-subtier threats.\
  \ On the other hand, Starfinder Society uses a 4-level spread for its tiers (e.g.\
  \ Tier 1-4) with two subtiers (e.g. Subtiers 1-2 and 3-4), eliminating the out-of-subtier\
  \ gap and tightening the difficulty ranges for the encounters.</p> \n     <p>Overall,\
  \ we're inclined to switch to this 4-level tier model, which would include Tiers\
  \ 1-4, 3-6, 5-8, 7-10, and so on. We've opened up a <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ux62?Tiers-Level-Gain\"\
  >Tiers and Level Gain thread</a> to solicit your insights, so be sure to join the\
  \ conversation there.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-StarfinderSociety.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-StarfinderSociety_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Boons</b>: Starfinder Society boons—everything from\
  \ the story awards earned during scenarios to the incentives distributed at public\
  \ events—underwent a major revision in the form of boon slots. With some exceptions,\
  \ each boon belongs to one of six categories: Ally, Faction, Personal, Promotional,\
  \ Social, or Starship. At the beginning of each scenario, after hearing the mission's\
  \ briefing, each player takes a moment to assign up to one boon of each type into\
  \ its respective boon slot. There were several goals here. First, it gave us a clean\
  \ way to handle our new faction model (see below). Second, it meant that players\
  \ didn't have to shuffle through piles of Chronicle sheets mid-game to find a boon\
  \ but could instead ready boons at the beginning of the adventure. Third, it helped\
  \ us balance boon design around the idea that each PC would have a limited number\
  \ of boons rather than dozens upon dozens of minor bonuses for which the Pathfinder\
  \ rules simply don't account. By being really clear in scenarios when a boon might\
  \ be useful to a player, I feel we've also promoted transparency, not yanked out\
  \ the rug from under players.</p> \n     <p>All told, we've been really happy with\
  \ how Starfinder Society boons work, and our inclination is to translate that system\
  \ over to our second edition campaign. Naturally, we'd replace the Starship slot\
  \ with something more genre appropriate (I know, I know... I just ruined one of\
  \ your character concepts, didn't I?).</p> \n     <p>But that's our take, and we\
  \ want to know how you feel about how boons would factor into the new campaign.\
  \ Let us know in the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ux64?Boons\">Boons thread</a>.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Factions and Fame</b>: Okay, let's get one complaint out on the table:\
  \ the Prestige Points/Fame/Reputation definitions aren't completely consistent between\
  \ Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society. We recognized that going in, but we\
  \ also balanced that against a desire to set Fame and Infamy in opposition to each\
  \ other and just have shorter, cleaner terms overall. The odds are good that we'll\
  \ adopt similar terminology in the new campaign.</p> \n     <p>Starfinder made some\
  \ significant changes to how factions and Fame work. The most dramatic change is\
  \ that each PC can work with any number of factions, slotting in a different faction\
  \ champion boon at the beginning of any adventure to represent that allegiance.\
  \ The especially devoted can stick to one faction, of course, but the options are\
  \ there. What's more, factions in Starfinders provide about a dozen purchasable\
  \ boons each, many of which might remind you of the vanities from Pathfinder Society.\
  \ The more you serve a faction, the higher your status with them, and the more impressive\
  \ the boons you can buy with your Fame. The drawback's that these took us a lot\
  \ of time to create (especially Thursty, who handled the majority of the wordsmithing),\
  \ but they've given each faction a much deeper role, both narratively and mechanically.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We're strongly looking to adopt the same faction model for second edition,\
  \ giving PCs the freedom to work with an assortment of factions and purchase faction-themed\
  \ benefits. We want to hear what you think in the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ux66?Factions-Fame\"\
  >Factions and Fame thread</a>.</p> \n     <p>During the first few seasons, the Society's\
  \ factions fought with one another in the Shadow War for control over Absalom. The\
  \ intrigue was compelling, but the tight-lipped secrecy and occasional elements\
  \ of backstabbing weren't especially conducive to playing a cooperative game. In\
  \ the past five years I feel the factions have reached a comfortable equilibrium\
  \ of working with the Society while also pursuing their own objectives (and sometimes\
  \ pulling the Society along for the ride). Starfinder Society's also done a great\
  \ job with this, showing how each faction is a facet of what drives the diverse\
  \ cast of Starfinders. What's your take? Let us know in that discussion thread.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Finally, any discussion of the factions begs the question \"Which factions\
  \ will appear in second edition?\" Well, we already know about some more faction\
  \ developments coming down the pipeline later in Season 9 and Season 10. Beyond\
  \ that, though, I'll be frank: we haven't locked in anything. Some factions might\
  \ step back or merge. Some new ones might appear. All I can say is that the fewer\
  \ the factions, the more we attention we can give them.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Chronicle Sheets</h2> \n     <p>Around four years\
  \ ago, the team created numerous prototypes for a new Chronicle sheet, shifting\
  \ all of the information boxes to the top (rather than splitting it along the top,\
  \ bottom, and side), juggling various features, and even eliminating certain entries\
  \ altogether. We eventually returned to the original concept but tinkered with the\
  \ layout and information fields in smaller ways. I admit that at this point I'm\
  \ comfortably fond of the current design. I'm also not a graphic designer, and I'm\
  \ sure that there are countless ways we could improve the Chronicle sheet to make\
  \ it easier for players to find information and easier for GMs to fill them out—\
  all while maintaining a visually attractive format.</p> \n     <p>At this point\
  \ there's no final design. Instead, we're soliciting your feedback in the <a href=\"\
  /threads/rzs2ux6a?PFSChronicle-Sheets\">Chronicle sheets thread</a>. What would\
  \ help you keep track of your rewards, minimize paperwork, and not impose an undue\
  \ burden on the GMs?</p> \n     <p>Oh! I almost forgot: there are already plans\
  \ in the works for how to ensure that items on the Chronicle sheets are relevant\
  \ without undermining a PC's general access to other gear through Fame (or a similar\
  \ mechanic). Until there's more news from the design team about equipment, though,\
  \ I'm going to leave it at that.</p> \n     <h2>Organizing the Guide</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>A new campaign demands a new <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a>. The Guide's gone through\
  \ around 10 revisions in its lifetime, and it's certainly become a complex creation\
  \ over the years. That said, Tonya's efforts to reorganize the document with major\
  \ help from our guide review team (a group of venture-officers who help us identify\
  \ inconsistencies and places for improvement) have helped break the veritable tome\
  \ into more easily printed, essential sections.</p> \n     <p>We feel the Guide's\
  \ in a pretty good place now, and we'll certainly apply many of the lessons learned\
  \ when creating the next Guide. That said, we want to hear from the people who are\
  \ using this document on a regular basis. Tell us what you'd want to see in a redesigned\
  \ Guide—layout, organization, information, and more—in our <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ux65?Structure-of-the-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  >Structure of the Roleplaying Guild Guide thread</a>.</p> \n     <h2>Character Numbers</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Player numbers are going to stay the same in the new edition's campaign.\
  \ Much as Starfinder Society character numbers began at -701, you'll find that any\
  \ playtest characters are going to start at -1501, and second edition characters\
  \ will start at -2001. I imagine this won't be contentious, but speak up if you\
  \ foresee some hidden issue with this numbering scheme.</p> \n     <p>That does\
  \ raise the question of how we're tracking playtest credit, doesn't it? Does that\
  \ credit translate into second edition Chronicle sheets? Not quite, but potentially.\
  \ That's something for a later blog.</p> \n     <h2>GM Stars</h2> \n     <p>When\
  \ Starfinder Society started up, we recognized that five GM stars wouldn't necessarily\
  \ correspond to proficiency with the Starfinder rules. Certainly GM stars conveyed\
  \ dedication to organized play as a whole and comfort \"behind the screen,\" yet\
  \ we needed a separate means of tracking one's Starfinder Society accomplishments.\
  \ As we look toward the second edition of Pathfinder RPG, we're seeing similar indicators.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That means a few things. First, it means that we're looking to introduce\
  \ an additional means of tracking GMs' efforts in second edition games. Second,\
  \ it means that first edition GM stars aren't disappearing; their principle impact\
  \ is on the first edition campaign, and they remain the celebrated badge of honor\
  \ for a GM's contributions. Third, we recognize that this may disappoint some folks,\
  \ and we're looking at ways to balance this by making players' experiences and GMs'\
  \ efforts relevant in the new campaign. We're reviewing the ongoing commentary and\
  \ soliciting opinions in an ongoing process of establishing this policy's details—\
  matters we'll discuss in a future blog.</p> \n     <h2>Character Conversions</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>As we stated in the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest/faq#v5748eaic9wfq\"\
  >Pathfinder Playtest FAQ</a>, we are not converting first edition characters into\
  \ second edition characters. This may be the toughest decision we've had to make.\
  \ Like me, you probably have several folders of characters with lots of Chronicle\
  \ sheets and tales yet to be told. Not only are we providing lots of options to\
  \ tell meaningful stories with those characters in the coming months, but we're\
  \ also including various ways to carry your gaming experience over from one campaign\
  \ to the next. This is an ongoing process and one that we'll address in a future\
  \ blog.</p> \n     <h2>Season 10</h2> \n     <p>Okay, that's a lot to digest for\
  \ the second edition. Let's talk a little about Season 10. I've seen a lot of threads\
  \ and posts noting that Season 10 needs higher-level scenarios, should wrap up some\
  \ ongoing stories, and should go out with a bang.</p> \n     <p>The organized play\
  \ team agrees entirely!</p> \n     <p>We traditionally announce our new season's\
  \ name at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> and hint at some of the awesome stories\
  \ to come, and I'm not going to spoil that today. I will, however, say that we have\
  \ some Big Plans for the first edition campaign's final scenarios. We're also thoroughly\
  \ aware that many of you want to pit your favorite characters against higher-level\
  \ challenges, so we're reducing the number of lower level scenarios published noticeably\
  \ for Season 10 while increasing the number of Tier 5-9, 7-11, 12-15 adventures\
  \ (perhaps higher). There's so much great story content in the works, and we look\
  \ forward to sharing it over the coming months.</p> \n     <h2>Our New Developer</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>We have a lot on the horizon and a lot of work ahead, and we're excited\
  \ to have Michael Sayre join the organized play team as a developer. He's been working\
  \ on the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjz/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-16-Fallen-Family-Broken-Name\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-16: Fallen Family, Broken Name</em></a>, and\
  \ we're looking forward to the great things he'll bring the Pathfinder Society campaign.\
  \ With Michael on board, I'll be spending more of my time helping Thursty on Starfinder\
  \ Society development and working on the upcoming playtest scenarios, and our larger\
  \ team means more opportunity for all of us to help spin up the next edition's Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead\
