  \ class=\"date\">Monday, November 23, 2009</p> \n   <p>Working in the RPG publishing\
  \ business is a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. It's a joy to get paid to think\
  \ about things like new oracle class abilities, which products to release in 2012,\
  \ and what we should have artists like Wayne Reynolds paint for our next hardcover\
  \ release, but in some ways working in the main office of the sausage factory can\
  \ take the fun out of things, or at least lessen the surprise.</p> \n   <p>New products\
  \ are a great example of this. Back in my fan days, I'd rush to the game store on\
  \ a near-weekly basis, eagerly scanning the racks for the latest releases from my\
  \ favorite publishing companies. Now that I effectively run my favorite publishing\
  \ operation in the business, the frisson of excitement brought by a new product\
  \ often isn't as strong as it once was.</p> \n   <p>By the time a \"brand new\"\
  \ product hits my desk, for example, my mind is already several months ahead, working\
  \ feverishly on the products almost on their way to the printer or dreaming up new\
  \ products that won't be released for more than a year. In some sense, the actual\
  \ arrival of a new product is the <i>last</i> step in a long process, not the first.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>There are, of course, exceptions. Huge, incandescent exceptions that glow\
  \ with the light of a hundred suns. Yeah, sure, by the time my adventure for <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy8735\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #19: \"Howl of the Carrion\
  \ King\"</a> came out last spring, my personal connection to the adventure—writing\
  \ it—was already more than 5 months in the past. I'd already proofed the adventure\
  \ in galleys, I'd already signed off on the final PDF, I'd already moved on, more\
  \ or less, to something else. Actually holding the printed product was just a physical\
  \ expression of the end of a long process, and given mounting pressures related\
  \ to products that hadn't come out yet, I barely even had time to stop and think\
  \ about that before moving to the next emergency email or the next staff meeting.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But even if the actual thrill of getting a printed product is diminished,\
  \ I always marvel when Paizo fans find a way to remind me how awesome this game\
  \ and hobby really is, even if I've become somewhat jaded in my old age here in\
  \ the tenth year of my RPG career. This happened recently upon a visit to the <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.twitter.com/paizo\" target=\"nofollow\">Paizo Twitter feed</a>,\
  \ where I encountered an image that brought the thundering excitement that was <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy8735\"><i>\"Howl of the Carrion King\"</i></a> crashing\
  \ back to the forefront. Paizo fan Snaggled posted some images of a 3D model of\
  \ the Kelmarane Battle Market—the major tactical site of the adventure—created by\
  \ his GM, Dave Dostaler. My chin has yet to come up from the floor since the moment\
  \ I saw these images:</p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <table border=\"0\">\n\
  \     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/Blog/3DBattleMarket1.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/3DBattleMarket1_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/Blog/3DBattleMarket2.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/3DBattleMarket2_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/Blog/3DBattleMarket3.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/3DBattleMarket3_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td align=\"center\" class=\"tiny\"\
  >Photography by Todd Warnke</td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table> \n  \
  \ </div> \n   <p>WOW! Thanks to Dave Dostaler, photographer Todd Warnke, and all\
  \ of Dave's players for sharing their \"Howl of the Carrion King\" experience with\
  \ me. It's moments like this—seeing what other creative gamers do to make the stuff\
  \ we create even better—that returns the giddy excitement to those of us on <i>this\
  \ side</i> of the GM Screen, and speaking as the publisher, I can't thank you guys\
  \ enough for this type of thing. It really makes all of the hard work worthwhile!</p>\
