              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Howdy, minis hounds! Last week, while I was trapped in the dreaded Paizo Conference Room (CR 23), the able Chris Lambertz took the wheel to show off digital renders of WizKids' incredible <a href="/products/btpy9f9p"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 5</em></a> for the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line of prepainted plastic miniatures.</p> 
               <p>I'm happy to report that the actual figures have arrived at Paizo and out in the wild, so this week we move from digital renders to actual photographs of the figures in the set. Would you like to take a peek? Of course you would!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Kess.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Kess_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have Kess, Human Brawler. Kess is perfect for any unarmed female PC (though she'd honestly double as a male fairly convincingly), and even works as an NPC thug leader. I love her fist-forward pose, and the color detail on the face of the figure I have on my desk is very well done.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Oloch.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Oloch_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next up is Oloch, Half-Orc Warpriest. Oloch is probably my favorite figure in this bunch, and one of my favorite miniatures in the entire <a href="/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">Iconic Heroes</a> range. He is a sentimental favorite, as I've been having a blast writing him in Dynamite's ongoing <a href="/products/btpy9gs3"><em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> comic series, but boy, what an intimidating, awesome figure. The banners on Oloch's back feature amazing detail. I really love this guy.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Zadim.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Zadim_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Zadim, Human Slayer is another sentimental favorite, since <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgbw">I wrote his "Meet the Iconics" backstory</a>. This figure's pose is really interesting, depicting Zadim mid-strike with one of his deadly kukris. WizKids has done a phenomenal job properly painting the various layers of his voluminous robes.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Enora.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Enora_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Enora, Halfling Arcanist is another highly versatile figure, either as a spellcasting player character or as an NPC. We haven't done too many halflings in <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> so far, so she fills a very useful niche. Her eyes, at least on the version I have in hand, are among the best I've yet seen on a WizKids figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Adowyn.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Adowyn_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Is this set specifically designed to strum my heartstrings with sentimental favorites? Adowyn, Human Hunter is based on a character from my weekly Pathfinder campaign, run by my neighbor and Pathfinder's Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn. It's fun to see a character I've known for so long come to life, first as an amazing illustration by Wayne Reynolds and second as a sweet miniature from WizKids. You can really use Adowyn for any kind of archer character, but her flowing cape and overall aura of awesomeness almost demand that she be a player character. An amazing figure, overall!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Leryn.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Leryn_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last up in <a href="/products/btpy9f9p"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 5</em></a> is Leryn, Adowyn's animal companion wolf. In the campaign, her animal companion is a gibbon, but perhaps <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> is not quite ready for that level of awesomeness. A wolf is, nonetheless, a highly versatile, useful miniature. With a run on its head and a mean black stripe running down its back, Leryn makes an even more imposing foe than friend. Team Leryn up with a pack of wolves from our first set, 
                <link>Heroes &amp; Monsters, and watch your players run for the hills!</p> 
               <p><a href="/products/btpy9f9p"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 5</em></a> is currently shipping from paizo.com, and is on shelves at your local game store. With premium paint jobs, <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">unique Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> cards, and some of the best sculpts yet in this range, this is one you won't want to miss!</p> 
               <p>I'm still hoping to get some new sculpts for our next big set so I can start off a new round of brand new reveals. It's coming very, very soon now...</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain,</p>

But when the crew's old friend and secret agent Vreva Jhafe uncovers rumors of a terrifying new magical weapon in devil-ruled Cheliax—one capable of wiping the abolitionist nation of Andoran off the map—will even their combined forces be enough to stop a navy backed by Hell itself?</i></p>

               <p itemprop="description"><i>In <a href="/products/btpy9e44"></a></i><a href="/products/btpy9e44">Pirate's Prophecy<i></i></a><i>, Captain Torius Vin has given up the pirate life in order to bring freedom to others. Along with his loyal crew and Celeste, the ship's snake-bodied navigator and Torius's one true love, the captain of the Stargazer uses a lifetime of piratical tricks to capture slave galleys and set the prisoners free. But when the crew's old friend and secret agent Vreva Jhafe uncovers rumors of a terrifying new magical weapon in devil-ruled Cheliax—one capable of wiping the abolitionist nation of Andoran off the map—will even their combined forces be enough to stop a navy backed by Hell itself?</i></p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Chapter 3: Prophecy and Deception</h2> 
                <p>Water as dark as a devil's soul slipped past <i>Stargazer</i>'s hull. The hiss of foam, creak of wood, and occasional flap of canvas would have been soothing to Celeste if not for the low scudding clouds that blocked the moon and stars. She felt stifled, as if a blanket of ignorance had been pulled over her head. Even the steady, familiar scuff of Torius's boots as he paced the quarterdeck couldn't assuage her frazzled nerves. </p> 
                <p><i>Without the stars, I'm blind.</i></p> 
                <p>They were following their usual indirect route to Almas, first sailing southeast toward Osirion to avoid any encounter with the Chelish navy, but had yet to make their turn northeast toward their true destination. Unfortunately, with the continuous low overcast, Celeste had been unable to accurately fix their position for several days. She only knew that they were approaching the Garund coast. Dead reckoning put them somewhere north of the Alamein Peninsula, but without the stars, her estimate could easily be off by fifty miles. Even if they missed the peninsula itself, such an error could put them on the unforgiving rocks of the Coast of Graves.</p> 
                <p><i>Who names places like that</i>? She stared southward and saw nothing but blackness. Where was the light at Djedefar? <i>Could the monks have let it go dark for some reason? </i>Celeste tried to keep her tail from twitching. Generations of mariners had used the light of the tower for navigation—not because it was a designated lighthouse, but because monks faithful to Irori kept the Stepped Tower lit for their own inscrutable reasons. Had she missed some significant date or convergence of the stars that would signify a darkening of the beacon? Not seeing the stars for two days was bad enough. Approaching an unseen shore only made her more nervous.</p> 
                <p>Torius paused behind her, so close she could taste his intimately familiar scent on her sensitive tongue. The brush of his hand along her smooth scales eased her anxiety a little.</p> 
                <p>"Don't worry, love. The mercury in the weatherglass has been rising since sunset. The stars will show themselves soon." The confidence in Torius's voice might have been affected, but it was welcome."</p> 
                <p>"Right now I'm more worried about rocks than stars. I hate approaching a shore in the dark with no solid navigational fix."</p> 
                <p>"It's quiet enough to hear surf from a mile off, and we can tack in a heartbeat if we spot the shore. I just want to get a solid position fix so we can set a proper course."</p> 
                <p>"I know." Without the stars, a sighting of shoreside landmarks was the only sure way to know where they were. "It concerns me that we haven't seen the light of the Stepped Tower. If there's fog on the coast—"</p> 
                <p>"There!" Torius pointed low on the eastern horizon. "A break in the clouds."</p> 
                <p>Celeste caught sight of a single star glimmering to the east through the overcast for a moment before it vanished. More gaps in the clouds gave tantalizing glimpses of the heavens, but were too fleeting to distinguish constellations or identify individual stars. Celeste glanced at the rack of hour and minute glasses she used to keep time, and quickly calculated where the planets would be in the sky. Those she could identify even without constellations, but none of them shone through the overcast yet.</p> 
                <p><i>Bretheda, Verces, Castrovel </i><i>...</i><i>where are you, my dears</i>?</p> 
                <p>Celeste floated up her silver sextant in preparation. All she needed was a clear sighting on two of the three planets, and she would have their position.</p> 
                <p>"There!" She caught sight of Bretheda and raised her sextant to take a sighting.</p> 
                <p>A glint of red light on the instrument's polished silver caught her eye. At first she thought it was a reflection of the lamp from the binnacle compass, but the helm was behind her, blocked by her body. Lowering the sextant, she stared into the darkness, scanning the invisible horizon from windward to leeward. <i>Nothing</i>. <i>What the</i>... Then she looked up. A faint glow pulsed red through the thick, low clouds directly in front of the ship. Even as she opened her mouth to cry out a warning, the color shifted to purple, and Celeste knew exactly what it was.</p> 
                <p>"Torius! The Hor-Aha light!"</p> 
                <p>At the same moment, the lookout shouted down, "Light off the port bow! Up in the clouds!"</p> 
                <p>The Hor-Aha tower loomed out of the heavy mist not four ship-lengths ahead. Deadly stonework soared hundreds of feet high, a line of white surf frothing about the razor-sharp rocks at its base.</p> 
                <p>"Wear ship!" Torius thundered. "Sheet in the main! Man the braces!"</p> 
                <p>"Helm's hard astarboard!" Windy Kate called out as she hauled the big wheel over.</p> 
                <p>The crew responded like a well-oiled machine. Feet pounded down the deck, and callused hands pulled frantically on lines. Surf rumbled over black rocks a stone's throw off the port side. The deck leveled briefly as <i>Stargazer</i> turned downwind, then the heavy mainsail boom swept overhead with a lurch, and the deck heeled sharply to port as they rounded to the north. The rack of finely calibrated sand glasses and the small leather bag with Celeste's instruments started to slide toward the edge of the deck. She snatched the bag up with magic, and slithered to block the heavier rack of sand glasses with her coils. </p> 
                <p>As the brigantine steadied on her new course, slipping easily through the sea once again, Celeste watched Hor-Aha's lurid red shift to deep purple, then vanish into the mists in the ship's wake. The ancient lighthouse had once served as a navigational aid and warning for pending storms to Osirian ships, but the light had gone dark ages ago. Only recently had the light renewed, though it now only showed red and purple, the chromatic code for violent gales. Rumors about haunts and curses abounded, and the weather and currents around the spire were unnatural and unpredictable.</p> 
                <p>"Well, <i>that</i> was close." Torius plucked the rack of sand glasses from Celeste's coils and put it down on the upwind side of the quarterdeck. Nervous laughter sounded around the middeck as the crew settled from the near catastrophe.</p> 
                <p>"Too close." She put her bag of instruments down beside the rack, and glared down at the chart she'd pinned to the deck. "We're forty miles <i>east</i> of where I had us plotted. There must have been a countercurrent off the Alamein Peninsula that pulled us off course." </p> 
                <p>"Don't fret about it. I told you we could turn in a heartbeat." Torius caressed her scales and smiled.</p> 
                <p>Celeste fought to still her pounding heart as she looked to the east. More stars winked in the sky along the horizon as the overcast broke up. "Of course, <i>now</i> I can get sightings, since I no longer need them." She snatched a pencil out of her bag and marked an X on the chart right next to the symbol representing the ancient lighthouse.</p> 
                <p>"Gozreh's luck." Torius brushed her cheek with the back of his knuckles. "Good eye spotting the light." </p> 
                <p>"Thank you." Celeste smiled and leaned into the caress. Between her lover's touch and the stars now twinkling overhead, her stress slowly ebbed away. She drew a deep, calming breath and gazed skyward.</p> 
                <p>"After days of clouds, it's no wonder you're tense... " Torius pulled her close. "I'll leave you to enjoy the stars. We're headed for open sea, so I won't need a fix for the rest of my watch."</p> 
                <p>"Very well, my captain." Grogul wouldn't come up for the morning watch for an hour, so Celeste tucked her instruments back into her case. </p> 
                <p>Raising her face to the sky, she took in the beauty of the emerging stars. As the blanket of clouds swept to leeward, the heavens unfolded like a mound of glittering treasure. Overhead marched the constellations of the Cosmic Caravan, the planets scattered among them like brilliant escorts. For a little while, she tried to put aside her worries and just enjoy the view.</p> 
                <p><i>Spies</i>... Never had Celeste thought that they would one day be trafficking secrets in a covert war for freedom. She remembered when freedom meant sailing the sea in search of plunder, taking fat merchant ships, stealing their illicit or smuggled cargo, and selling the ill-gotten prizes in Katapesh's dark markets. Now freedom meant fighting to free others, sailing the same circuitous route from Almas to Ostenso month after month, living in a ship full of lies. Glancing at the crew toiling about the deck, she wondered if any shared her misgivings. Torius's choice to get involved in Andoran's covert war against slavery had very nearly destroyed them all, but not a single member of the crew had abandoned ship. </p> 
                <p><i>They'll never abandon their captain, and neither would I, but</i>... <i>is this the only life for us</i>?</p> 
                <p>Panged by guilt, Celeste gazed up at the stars. She often sought guidance in the heavens, seeking answers among the paths of the planets among the constellations. She had faith in the cosmos. It wasn't capricious or vindictive, and didn't take sides in right and wrong, good and evil. Its message might not always be easy to interpret, but the stars never lied. Tonight, Bretheda—the Cradle—shone from within the Stargazer, Celeste's birth sign, which had no immediate significance, and Castrovel approached the Lantern Bearer, which was Torius's. Celeste smiled. She'd never really noticed an increase in her lover's libido when the planet of lust and fertility crossed his sign.</p> 
                <p><i>Perhaps I'll start taking data</i>. </p> 
                <p>The only other planet in the sky, Verces, glimmered between the constellations of the Stranger and the Follower. <i>Interesting</i>... Verces, the Line, signified choice<i>. Between a stranger and a follower? How might that apply to us</i>? The answer was there, if only she could discern it. <i>If I could just see it clearly in the stars, hear it in the song of the heavens</i>.</p> 
                <p>The celestial chorus sang through her soul... </p> 
                <p>"Sails!"</p> 
                <p>Celeste blinked. To the east, the sky glowed with the light of dawn. Hours had passed since Torius had left her to her musing. She'd lost herself among the stars yet again, oblivious to the bustle of sailors around her, undisturbed even by the changing of the watch. <i>Damn it</i>... Celeste felt as if a piece of her life had been stolen away, angry at her lapse, but also frightened at her loss of control.</p> 
                <p>"Where away, and what type of sails?" Grogul's bellow to the masthead lookout rattled Celeste's eardrums.</p> 
                <p>"Southeast," came Lacy Jane's answer. "Lateen rig. Two masts, but it's too dark to tell the color. She's hull down. Could be a felucca or a galley."</p> 
                <p>A felucca meant a merchant or fisherman. A galley could be a slaver.</p> 
                <p>Celeste opened her case and lifted out her telescope with a flick of magic. It was a far finer instrument than any other aboard. "Grogul." She floated the telescope to him. "Do you want to send this up to Lacy?"</p> 
                <p>"Sure, if you promise not to bite me if it goes overboard." He knew she cherished the instrument, and obviously appreciated the offer.</p> 
                <p>Celeste knew he was joking, but smiled to show her fangs. "I promise. I haven't bitten anyone in <i>days</i>!"</p> 
                <p>"Thanks." Grogul turned to his bosun's mate. "Kalli, run this up to Lacy."</p> 
                <p>"Aye!" Kalli the gillman tucked the telescope through her belt and climbed up the ratlines, her webbed hands and feet sure on the ropes.</p> 
                <p>In moments, Lacy Jane called down, "Galley! Yellow sails! She's turning north!"</p> 
                <p>"They're turning to follow us."</p> 
                <p>"Seems that way." Grogul's predatory grin spoke volumes. He shouted orders to the crew. "Maintain course, but slack the sheets to slow us down a bit. Someone wake the captain."</p> 
                <p>Celeste looked to the sky, but the light of dawn had already dimmed the stars. She would get no more guidance from there, but she remembered her earlier observations. <i>Verces between the Stranger and the Follower. A choice</i>... As usual, the signs could be interpreted numerous ways. If the ship they'd spotted was the follower, who was the stranger? Or perhaps the choice wasn't between a follower and a stranger, but between fleeing or fighting the stranger who followed them? If they chose to fight, they risked more than the ship and their lives, for they carried Vreva's coded logbook, a repository of secrets invaluable to the Andoren cause. They could never let slavers get their hands on that book.</p> 
                <p>Torius and Thillion hurried up to the quarterdeck. Snick followed, rubbing her eyes, her sea-green hair sticking up at all angles. She dyed it blue for her disguise in Ostenso, but insisted on washing it clean every time they left port, just like she insisted upon changing the identity of the ship from <i>Sea Serpent</i> to <i>Stargazer</i>.</p> 
                <p>"Looks like an Okeno slaver, sir," Grogul reported. "Still hull down, but they've turned to follow. I slacked sheets to slow us, and in this light wind, they'll catch up quickly. We should get a better look soon."</p> 
                <p>"Thanks, Grogul."</p> 
                <p>"Couldn't you have waited until after breakfast to bellow like a bull elephant?" Snick glared up at the bosun and tried to smooth her hair.</p> 
                <p>"Sorry to interrupt your beauty sleep. I know you need it." Grogul grinned down at her, showing his tusks.</p> 
                <p>The gnome made a face. "You should get some, too."</p> 
                <p>"We could lure them in and take them, Captain." Thillion squinted to the south, his elven eyes sharper than theirs by far. "Unless she turns out to be as big as the <i>Bloody Scourge</i>, of course."</p> 
                <p>Celeste could only agree. That ship had very nearly been the death of them all.</p> 
                <p>"We may have to let this one pass." Torius squinted at the sea and sky, obviously gauging the variables that might affect their chances. From his frown, he was also undoubtedly thinking about Vreva's logbook. He turned to Celeste and cocked an eyebrow. "Unless you have some insight from the stars?"</p> 
                <p>"I don't... " Celeste paused and considered the choice that faced them. <i>Should we fight and risk Vreva's book</i>?</p> 
                <p>"Yes." The answer came out of Celeste's mouth before she knew what she was saying. She had no idea where the overwhelming feeling of promise had come from, but it couldn't be denied. The song of the heavens sang it loud in her soul, a familiar rightness, just as when she'd considered facing Lothera Cothos.</p> 
                <p>Everyone looked at her in surprise.</p> 
                <p>"You <i>do</i> have some guidance from the stars?" Thillion sounded dubious.</p> 
                <p>Torius had learned to respect her astrological prophecies, but knew better than to ask for specific information. Long experience had taught him that her predictions were fraught with uncertainty, often only becoming clear in retrospect. The rest of the crew still often saw her prophecies as more troublesome than accurate. But this time, she was certain.</p> 
                <p>"Yes, I have. The choice is clear. We should take them."</p> 
                <p>"Captain!" Lacy Jane called down from the foretop. "She's hull up! One deck of oars, and she's pulling hard! They're coming after us!"</p> 
                <p>Torius turned to Celeste. The slaver wasn't so large that <i>Stargazer</i> couldn't take her, but there was still doubt in his eyes. "You're <i>sure</i>?"</p> 
                <p>"I'm sure, my captain." Celeste reared up, more sure of this than she had been about anything lately. "We should take that ship. Trust me!"</p> 
                <p>Torius grinned. "I was hoping you'd say that." He turned to his officers. "We take them! Thillion, I like your idea of luring them in. Let's make like we're a merchant fleeing in panic. Grogul, something aloft is going to break. Nothing catastrophic, just enough to foul the rigging and kill our speed. You'll command the main boarding party amidships."</p> 
                <p>"Aye, sir!" The half-orc hefted his axe and thumbed the razor edge.</p> 
                <p>"Snick, put the <i>Sea Serpent</i> placards back on, and load your babies with the usual tricks. We'll take them by surprise."</p> 
                <p>"Surprises are my specialty, Captain!" The gnome scurried off to tend her ballistae. <i>Stargazer</i> would look like a benign merchant until the cunningly disguised firing ports opened and the tips of six of Snick's specialized ballista warheads nosed out.</p> 
                <p>"Thillion, you and your archers will rake their deck from our forecastle as they come alongside, then board and continue the barrage from their own foredeck."</p> 
                <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

                </div> 
                <p>"Celeste, you, Windy, and the bosun's mates will board aft with me. Once we've cleared their quarterdeck, I want you to rake their middeck with your spells."</p> 
                <p>"It'll be my pleasure." Celeste's heart raced in anticipation of the battle. Having suffered in chains herself, there were few things in life she enjoyed more than blasting slavers with destructive magic.</p> 
                <p>"Good! Windy, start steering wild. Grogul, tell the crew to handle the sheets and braces like lubbers. Thillion, pick your archers and stand ready. Remember, we're merchants until the trap is sprung!"</p> 
                <p>Canvas and tangled cordage flapped in the wind, and sailors scurried around the deck in apparent panic. The slaver was closing fast, near enough now that Torius could read the placard on her bow. The <i>Golden Chain</i> bore a figurehead of a woman bound in gilded manacles and a collar.</p> 
                <p>"Keep coming, you bastard." Torius lowered his glass and turned to shout panicked orders to his crew. They had to play this right. If the slaver got a whiff of the trap, they would rake <i>Stargazer</i> with arrows and ballista bolts from afar. But Torius had learned how to play on slavers' greed by appearing vulnerable. To traffickers in flesh, sailors were potential merchandise, not to be damaged unless they resisted. Few merchantmen could offer much of a fight. Most would choose slavery over death.</p> 
                <p>Torius knew better. He'd die before he became a slave again.</p> 
                <p>"Yaw to starboard, Windy. We're panicked, remember."</p> 
                <p>"Shakin' in my boots, sir." She grinned at him and hauled the wheel to starboard, her strong right hand working in concert with the hook-and-pike combination that had replaced her left. A slaver had taken that hand some months ago. Already, Windy had filed five notches in the pike for the slavers she'd killed as payback.</p> 
                <p>"<i>Sea Serpent!</i> Heave to and nobody dies!" The bellowed command from the bow of the <i>Golden Chain</i> brought a cold smile to Torius's lips. </p> 
                <p>Glancing over his shoulder, Torius assessed their foe. Slavers armed with nets, grapples, and cutlasses crowded the galley's middeck, ready to board. On the forecastle, a ballista crew stood ready beside their engine, but the adjacent catapult wasn't even loaded. There were no archers. There were, however, more slavers than Torius had counted on. He hoped he hadn't underestimated this foe.</p> 
                <p>"Kalli, ready the colors. I want to scare yesterday's breakfast right out of those bastards!" The instant the slavers saw Andoran's flag, they'd know they were in for a fight, and <i>Stargazer</i> had a deadly reputation in Okeno. "Dukkol, pass the word down to Celeste. Two minutes."</p> 
                <p>The two bosun's mates hurried to comply, the gillman clipping the flags to the mainmast halyard, and the one-eyed dwarf thumping down the stairs to where Celeste hid inside the sterncastle door. Moments later, the dwarf returned, and Torius heard the rasp of scales on the deck beside him.</p> 
                <p>"Ready, my captain." Celeste's disembodied voice sounded like music to his ears.</p> 
                <p>"Good. You know your target."</p> 
                <p>"Anyone who looks like they're about to cast a spell."</p> 
                <p>"Right." Recently the Okeno slavers had begun contracting powerful wizards to protect their ships. Torius winced as he recalled the Gray Corsair <i>Gold Wing</i>, sunk by a blast of magic before their eyes. That was another reason he chose to lure their prey in for the kill. Up close, a caster was an easier target. With any luck, Celeste could neutralize the threat before they had a chance to blast <i>Stargazer</i> to kindling.</p> 
                <p>Torius glanced over his shoulder again, trying to look scared as he gauged the angles and distances between the two ships. He muttered a prayer to Gozreh that Celeste's guidance on this battle would prove true. They were taking a serious risk in this venture. He'd probably catch hell from Marshal Trellis for putting Vreva's logbook at risk, but they did have to maintain their reputation as privateers. That meant actually taking on a slaver now and then. Besides, Torius never tired of killing slavers and freeing slaves. The looks on their faces—the horror of the slavers and the amazement of the slaves—when they realized what was happening made him feel more alive than just about anything else in the world.</p> 
                <p>"Yaw to port, Windy! Keep them guessing."</p> 
                <p>"Aye, sir!" <i>Stargazer</i> slewed to port. The slaver shifted course accordingly.</p> 
                <p>"<i>Sea Serpent!</i> Heave to, or we'll fire on you!" The crack of a ballista backed their threat, but the warning shot flew harmlessly overhead, a holed sail the only damage.</p> 
                <p>"Don't shoot! We surrender!" Torius dashed to the taffrail, waving his arms in a panic. "Let fly sheets! Helm to windward!"</p> 
                <p><i>Stargazer</i> turned to starboard and <i>Golden Chain</i> back-paddled her starboard sweeps to come alongside. Torius scanned the galley's deck, noting the satisfied smiles and laughter among the slavers. <i>That's right, just keep laughing</i>... The two ships closed to barely ten yards.</p> 
                <p>"I have the caster, Torius." Celeste's voice came from right beside him.</p> 
                <p>"Do it."</p> 
                <p>Arcane words flowed, harsh and garbled to the captain's ear. Celeste materialized as lightning lashed out toward <i>Golden Chain</i>'s quarterdeck. The bolt struck a robed woman there, blasting her to the deck in a flutter of smoldering cloaks. </p> 
                <p>"<i>Stargazer</i>!" Torius drew his sword and thrust it high, the familiar rush of adrenaline surging through his veins.</p> 
                <p>Two flags flew up the mainmast, the golden eagle of Andoran on a blue-and-gray shield, and directly beneath it, <i>Stargazer</i>'s own long black-and-silver pennant bearing a serpentine silhouette of a naga with flowing white hair. Thillion's archers leapt up from hiding to rake the galley's forecastle with a deadly volley. The crew of the enemy ballista fell, riddled with arrows. <i>Stargazer</i>'s deck shuddered beneath Torius's feet as six ballistae cracked in perfect unison. The bolts cleared the galley's rail by mere inches, and the triggering tethers came taut, detonating the ceramic warheads. Blue-white liquid splashed forth onto the astonished slavers, encasing them in freezing alchemical ice. Grogul and his boarders boiled up from the main hatchway, heaving grapples to pull the two ships closer.</p> 
                <p>"Celeste, Dukkol, Windy, Kalli, with me!" The helmswoman and bosun's mates drew weapons and ran with him to the rail, but Celeste didn't move. When he glanced back, she just stared at him with a questioning look. "Come on!"</p> 
                <p>"<i>Que towlre nokta?</i>" Celeste gaped at him wide-eyed.</p> 
                <p>Torius stared at Celeste, trying to interpret what she'd said. "Celeste! Come on!" </p> 
                <p>She blinked at him, uncomprehending, and spoke again, but her words came out as a string of gibberish.</p> 
                <p><i>What the hell language is she speaking</i>? </p> 
                <p>The two ships met with a crash. Torius couldn't wait, even for her. He leapt the rail onto the enemy quarterdeck, parrying a pike thrust even before his feet touched the deck. Windy gutted the pikeman as she landed beside him, and parried a cutlass with her hook. Kalli lunged to skewer a slaver officer through the neck with her rapier. Dukkol bellowed a curse as he took a pike in the leg, but his axe clove through his opponent's arms in riposte. More slavers closed in on them, pressing them hard. Torius parried wildly, glimpsing the slaver captain beyond the flashing blades. The officer knelt over the smoldering form of the fallen wizard, a blue glass bottle in one hand. The caster reached up for the bottle with one charred hand.</p> 
                <p>"The caster's still alive!" The Stargazers were holding their own so far, but if the slaver captain healed the wizard, they'd be in trouble. "Celeste!" </p> 
                <p>Torius couldn't break through the flashing blades before him, but the answering crackle of lightning was all he'd hoped for. The bolt caught both the wizard and the captain in its fury. The caster was reduced to a smoldering corpse, but the captain rolled to his feet and drew a pair of hooked silvery hand axes from his belt. Ignoring the smoke trailing from his singed jacket, the man charged to the attack.</p> 
                <p>Torius pressed his opponent hard, slashing through her guard to open a horrible gash in her leg. The woman stumbled, and Windy took the opening to slash her cutlass across the slaver's neck. The helmswoman took a cut to her other arm from her own opponent, but Kalli put her rapier in the slaver's ribs. Dukkol, though limping, guarded their flank as more slavers charged up the steps from the middeck to reinforce their officers.</p> 
                <p>Torius kicked away the twitching corpse and met the captain's attack, parrying one gleaming axe and dodging the other. The man was quick, however, and Torius missed his next parry. The slaver's blade ripped through the fine mail beneath his shirt, gouging a furrow down his ribs. Pain took his breath away and weakened his knees.</p> 
                <p>"Gozreh's guts!" Torius was no stranger to injuries, but this felt like he'd been plunged into boiling oil. He managed to evade the other axe and slash at the man's legs, driving him back.</p> 
                <p>The slaver captain grinned maniacally and flourished his weapons, which glimmered strangely. "You're no match for—"</p> 
                <p>A beam of searing energy from Celeste caught the man square in the face. The axes clattered to the deck and a horrible scream rose from the slaver captain's blistered lips, his hands clawing at eyes charred to cinders in their sockets.</p> 
                <p>"Match that, asshole!" Torius silenced the captain's screams with a slash of his sword. Clutching the wound in his side, he clenched his teeth against the excruciating pain and turned to face the enemy charge.</p> 
                <p>Then Celeste was beside him, her scales shimmering with a starry radiance. At first, Torius thought it was the mesmerizing shimmer she often used to distract an enemy, but the effect was different. Instead of her scales shimmering, it looked as if she wore a luminous cloak of glittering motes. A slaver lunged at her, and Torius thought the cutlass would surely rake her, but the starry nimbus turned the blade before it touched her side. Celeste struck like a viper, sinking her fangs into the slaver's throat. His screams died in a gurgle, and she flung the twitching corpse aside with a twist of her body.</p> 
                <p>Torius spared a moment to assess the battle. Thillion and his archers had taken the foredeck, and their bows sang a song of death, shots picking off slavers as they struggled against Grogul's boarders. Two Stargazers had turned the enemy ballista around to fire down upon the slavers crowding the middeck. Snick's ballista crews now fired crossbows from the conjoined rails, and Torius spotted the shock of the gnome's green hair as she scrambled toward the enemy forecastle. The surprise of their assault had given them a foothold, but they were still outnumbered. Here on the quarterdeck, slavers poured up two flights of steps to oppose them. Even with Celeste's aid, they were being pressed hard. </p> 
                <p>"Rally!" he called out in encouragement. "We've got to take the quarterdeck!"</p> 
                <p>Celeste shouted something unintelligible, but her tone bespoke urgency.</p> 
                <p>"I can't understand a word you're saying, Celeste!" Had the wizard gotten off a spell to tangle her tongue? Torius swallowed his worry for her and slashed to drive the enemy back. If they could take the quarterdeck, Celeste could rake the middeck with her spells, but not while fighting at close quarters.</p> 
                <p>A flight of glowing motes shot from the naga to riddle the enemy, and Torius breathed easier. Two dropped their weapons, and were instantly skewered, and Dukkol hacked the legs out from under another. The Stargazers surged forward, and Torius drove his opponent over the forward rail.</p> 
                <p>They had taken the quarterdeck.</p> 
                <p>Lightning lashed out from Celeste, arcing the length of the deck to blast a furrow through the enemy force. Arrows streaked from the rear of the slaver ranks in reply. Kalli took a shaft in the shoulder, and Torius felt a burning sting as one creased his thigh, but the one aimed at Celeste glanced off her starry shield.</p> 
                <p>"Nice spell, Celeste!" He slashed at another slaver trying to regain the quarterdeck, sending her tumbling down the steps. "Dukkol, block the stairs! Don't let them get a foothold! We've got to give Celeste cover!"</p> 
                <p>Celeste yelled something else, but still he couldn't understand her. Fortunately, she knew her role. Another searing bolt of lightning blasted the enemy force. Grogul and his fighters were pressing the slavers against the far rail now, so reduced were their numbers. Celeste slithered quickly to the port side of the quarterdeck.</p> 
                <p>"Guard the stairs!" Torius commanded the others. "Nobody gets—" His orders died on his lips as a burly slaver with a hooked falchion leapt down at Celeste from the ratlines. The full force of the man's falling mass backed the two-handed stroke. "Celeste! Look out!"</p> 
                <p>Celeste turned to Torius, eyes uncomprehending as the blade fell like a guillotine toward the back of her head.</p> 
                <p>An iron-tipped ballista bolt struck the slaver the instant before the blade would have cloven her skull. The heavy falchion sheared away a lock of the naga's platinum hair, then skittered down her scales. The glancing blow brought her around in a flash of fangs, ready to strike, but the shaft had spitted the slaver through the chest. Her would-be assassin lay twitching on the deck, clutching the wrist-thick bolt and gasping for breath.</p> 
                <p>With a sigh of relief, Torius traced the bolt's trajectory back to the foredeck, where a grinning gnome leapt with delight at her life-saving shot. He'd have to remember to thank Snick, but the battle wasn't over yet. </p> 
                <p>"Celeste!" Torius pointed to the deck, since in her current state she seemed incapable of understanding him.</p> 
                <p>Celeste turned away from the dying slaver and cast her lightning yet again, blasting the tightly pressed slavers and thinning their remaining ranks by half.</p> 
                <p>The devastation shattered the enemy's waning morale. Some dropped their weapons to plead for mercy, while others, rightly assuming that none would be given, leapt over the side. This proved a poor tactic, however, for the school of sharks that often followed slave galleys had been alerted to a pending meal by the blood running from the ship's scuppers. The water roiled, and shrill screams rose above the din of battle.</p> 
                <p>The surviving slavers fought grimly on—ravaged by Grogul's boarding party, Thillion's archers, and Celeste's spells—until the last fell in a welter of blood. A cheer rose up from the Stargazers, and Torius thrust his bloody sword to the sky in triumph.</p> 
                <p>"Grogul, search the ship and free the slaves! Snick, see to the wounded! Thillion, pick a prize crew and take stock of all she's carrying. You'll be taking her into Almas as usual." As the three hurried to follow his orders, he turned to find Celeste coiled over the slaver who had attacked her. She had ended his suffering with a bite to the throat, a kindness Torius doubted the slaver would have returned. Her cloak of starlight had vanished, and her black scales were spattered with blood, but she seemed unhurt. "Celeste! Are you all right?"</p> 
                <p>She turned to him with a startled look. "I'm... fine." She glanced down at the gash in his side. "You're bleeding."</p> 
                <p>"I'll live." He winced as he flexed his side. It still hurt abominably, but the crippling pain was gone. The blade had skittered across his ribs like a stick along a picket fence, but the wound wasn't life-threatening. "What happened to you? I couldn't understand a word you said."</p> 
                <p>"I... don't know. I couldn't understand you, either." She gazed at the charred corpse of the slaver wizard. "Maybe she cursed me."</p> 
                <p>"Well, it's lapsed, at least." He ran a hand down her truncated hair. "Though it cost you a haircut."</p> 
                <p>"Yes... I didn't see him." She looked forward. "Snick saved my life."</p> 
                <p>"Yes. She's certainly got a way with ballistae. That was an amazing shot. I'll have to give her a bonus. But that cloak-of-starlight saved you as well. That's a handy spell." He laughed, but was surprised to see that his mirth wasn't mirrored in her eyes. Instead, she looked rather shaken. "You sure you're okay?"</p> 
                <p>"Just a little rattled, I think." Celeste smiled weakly. "Close call, you know. But we won."</p> 
                <p>"That we did." Torius surveyed the deck. "Your prophecy was spot-on!"</p> 
                <p>The Stargazers were hard at work, and already the deck looked less like a slaughterhouse and more like a ship. Snick and her ballista crews tended the wounded with a satchel full of potions for those close to death and bandages for the rest. At a glance he saw only two dead Stargazers. They'd be in Almas in just a few days, and there was enough in the death fund they all paid into to have them brought back by the priests there. Torius looked over his crew with a surge of pride; taking on such a superior force with only two deaths was an amazing feat. </p> 
                <p>He cleaned his sword on a dead slaver's shirt and slipped it into its sheath. "Yes, it's a good day to be a pirate."</p> 
                <p>"<i>Privateer</i>, you mean," Celeste corrected.</p> 
                <p>"I suppose." He gave her his best piratical grin and laughed. "Doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but I must admit there are advantages." </p> 
                <p>The first of the freed slaves stumbled onto the deck, pale and blinking in the sunlight. That look of delighted astonishment on their faces made all his pain worthwhile.</p> 
                <p>I still think I should go in with you. Mathias rubbed up against Vreva's leg and lashed his tail. You might need my help.</p> 
                <p>"Not this time, love." Vreva took a calming breath and peered out the window of the carriage as it turned onto Ostenso's waterfront. She loved Mathias and might have used his help, but having him along would distract her. In the belly of a Chelish flagship, surrounded by a thousand sailors and marines, the last thing she needed was a distraction. "It's just dinner. I'll be in and out in a trice."</p> 
                <p>Dinner with you is never <i>just</i> dinner. Mathias knew better than to be put off by her assurances. Tell me you're not planning to befuddle his brain with your feminine charms, drug his wine, break into his mind with magic, and steal his every secret right down to his mistress's favorite color.</p> 
                <p>"Mathias!" She reached down and scratched him behind the ears. "Never <i>all</i> of that on the first date."</p> 
                <p>Right. He didn't sound convinced.</p> 
                <p>The truth was, Vreva didn't have much of a plan other than to make her best possible first impression on Admiral Ronnel. She'd done some digging on him, of course, and deemed him a hard man, a brilliant naval tactician, a political hawk, and—thank Calistria—a ladies' man. The only way she could get more information about him and this Kellid witch and her weapon, neither of which they had seen in several days of Mathias spying from the waterfront alleys, was to meet him in person. Unfortunately, her letter of introduction and invitation to a private dinner at the Officers' Club had been answered with regrets and an explanation that his duties would not let him leave his ship—but also with a return invitation to visit him aboard his flagship, <i>Devil's Trident</i>. If she got him alone, and detected none of the magical precautions so common among the powerful and paranoid, she might risk casting a spell on him or drugging his wine. Then, with some careful suggestions, she might attempt to discover what this secret weapon was. Vreva was experienced enough to know that things like this took time. Besides, the admiral wasn't going anywhere soon. Rumor had it that <i>Devil's Trident</i> would be tied to the dock for some time yet awaiting an unknown deadline.</p> 
                <p>The carriage rumbled to a stop, the iron wheels sounding hollow on the thick wooden planks of the wharf. Vreva smoothed her dress, and then cast a spell on Mathias that made him vanish from sight. Her familiar would skulk about the docks within range of her empathic messages. If something untoward occurred, at least he would know.</p> 
                <p>Vreva stepped from the carriage and tamped down her trepidation. She'd been in many dangerous places in her career, but never had she stepped aboard such an intimidating ship. This close, the sheer immensity of <i>Devil's Trident</i> made her feel as if she stood before the ramparts of a castle. Looming over lesser ships, the flagship's four towering masts soared so high they seemed to pierce the evening sky. Three rows of ballista ports checkered the hull, more than she'd ever seen on one ship. The gangplank looked more like a drawbridge than a simple ramp, sporting gilded rope handrails and carpeted steps that led up to a wide boarding hatch on the middeck.</p> 
                <p>Vreva approached with an easy, fluid gait that belied her tension. She had taken great care with her attire for the evening, remembering one of her very first lessons as a courtesan: you have only one chance to make a good first impression. Her gown—deep crimson silk brocade with gold accents—plunged low at both neckline and back, though a shawl clasped at her throat currently hid the full effect. </p> 
                <p>Security around the ship was tight, especially since it was docked not at the naval pier, but rather at the main commercial pier of the port. A score of Chelish marines were stationed all along the dock, and another ten in formation at the base of the gangplank, all of them resplendent in black-and-red uniforms. An army couldn't have easily breached the flagship's defenses—but Vreva could. She'd done some careful reconnoitering earlier in the day, looking for magical defenses, wards, traps, and the like. Though she'd found none, her skin crawled with unease. She had no doubt there were spellcasters aboard. For this first incursion, she'd taken great care to leave all of her magical trinkets and lethal poisons behind—nothing that would raise suspicions if discovered. </p> 
                <p>The marines at the gangplank snapped to rigid attention, but couldn't hide their covert glances at the admiral's guest.</p> 
                <p>"Madame Korvis." A tall lieutenant bowed stiffly, his face a mask of propriety. "Lieutenant Draell of the Imperial Marines at your service. The admiral's expecting you."</p> 
                <p>"And he's supplied me with quite a dashing escort." She proffered a silk-gloved hand. "Delighted to meet you, Lieutenant Draell."</p> 
                <p>He took her hand in a formal fingertip grasp and bowed again, his unsmiling face flushing slightly. "You'll excuse the formality, ma'am. We're under very strict security." He placed her hand on his arm and gestured to the gangway. Four of the marines fell in around them, their faces chiseled from stone.</p> 
                <p>"Well, I'm honored to receive such royal treatment." She wasn't really. Five soldiers surrounding her meant she couldn't make any haphazard observations en route to the admiral, but that wouldn't stop her from learning as much as she could. "I've never been aboard a <i>flagship</i> before. Perhaps you could point out a few things on the way."</p> 
                <p>"I'd be happy to, ma'am."</p> 
                <p>At the boarding hatch, another squad of marines stood around a man in a black jacket with two silver emblems on his lapels, a pair of crossed lightning bolts and a junior officer's insignia. He was young and good-looking, and Vreva knew instantly that he was a spellcaster. Here, it seemed, was the magical security.</p> 
                <p>"One moment please." The darkly clad caster stepped forward and held up a hand, his fingers bent in a crooked gesture as a whisper of arcane words issued from his mirthless lips. His hand shimmered briefly in the dim light of the deck lanterns.</p> 
                <p>"Magic?" She cocked an eyebrow at her escort. "You <i>are</i> being very careful, aren't you?"</p> 
                <p>"Just a precaution, Madame Korvis." Draell's face remained impassive. "I'm sure you understand."</p> 
                <p>"I understand perfectly." She fixed her features in a facade of mild affront. "Will there be a search of my <i>person</i>, as well?"</p> 
                <p>Draell looked momentarily horrified. "No, ma'am. We just look for magic."</p> 
                <p><i>That's good to know</i>. She sighed as if mildly put out.</p> 
                <p>"Nothing." The caster nodded respectfully and tipped his tricorne, but remained impassive. "Your pardon, ma'am."</p> 
                <p>Vreva smiled sweetly at him, then turned back to Draell. "Now, about this wonderful ship, Lieutenant... "</p> 
                <p>Vreva feigned rapt interest as Draell happily spouted nautical mumbo-jumbo, drowning her in meaningless details about buntlines, cat-harpins, and double-preventer stays. Only once they entered the lofty sterncastle did the deluge of sailor-speak ease to a trickle, and her attention sharpen. She memorized every twist and turn of the corridors in case she had to make a quick escape. Surviving such an escape, however, seemed unlikely with all the sailors and soldiers about. Dour marines stood at many of the doors, and every passage branch. If she had to flee, she'd need to sprout wings and go out a porthole.</p> 
                <p>Finally, they came to a pair of double doors guarded by two more marines and narcissistically emblazoned with the crest of the Admiral's house. Cheliax's queen had granted Ronnel the title of baronet for his service to the empire, which barely qualified as nobility. At Lieutenant Draell's knock, a white-jacketed steward opened the door and stepped aside.</p> 
                <p>Draell escorted Vreva inside, and executed a crisp military bow. "Milord Admiral Vaetus Ronnel, Madame Virika Korvis."</p> 
                <p>A slim man of perhaps fifty years wearing an immaculate dress admiral's uniform turned from the broad expanse of stern gallery windows. "Madame Korvis, how very delightful of you to accept my invitation." Ronnel approached with a smile and a conspicuous brush of the golden epaulets atop his shoulders. "I regret <i>terribly</i> that I couldn't meet with you at your establishment, but the duties of command never end, and my presence is required here." The admiral executed a precise quarter-bow, the proper formality for a noble greeting a guest of lower standing.</p> 
                <p>Ronnel was surprisingly handsome, which didn't matter in the slightest. What did matter was his obvious arrogance. She could use that to her advantage. From her youth in Egorian, Vreva was all too familiar with the propriety and pomposity of the new nobility. She'd be living in that world still, had she not abandoned her true name, family, and heritage. She also knew enough about Ronnel to be on her guard. The man was skilled, intelligent, and ruthless. He was also an idiot when it came to money. Without a war to supply him with prize money from naval conquests, his lavish habits had resulted in a considerable debt. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, he enjoyed female company.</p> 
                <p>"Milord Admiral." Unclipping her shawl, Vreva handed it off to the steward and curtsied gracefully, giving the admiral a delicate smile and a perfect view of her daring neckline. "It's such a pleasure to finally meet the commander so highly spoken of by his officers. I'm thrilled to be invited aboard such a <i>fabulous</i> ship!"</p> 
                <p>The last part, at least, was the absolute truth; she was thrilled by this opportunity to spy on a fleet admiral, and the ship was indeed fabulous. The great cabin was nothing short of palatial. Polished brass lamps hung from every beam, bathing the teak-paneled walls in a soft golden glow. The decor was both masculine and military. A large desk stood to the right, emblazoned with yet another coat of arms, a pair of crossed swords displayed on the wall behind it. A table set with burnished silver plates and sparkling crystal stood in front of high, gilt-framed windows that arched along the entire back wall, providing a glorious view of the harbor. White-gloved servants stood behind each chair, ready to attend. </p> 
                <p><i>Not exactly intimate</i>. <i>I'll have to get him alone somehow</i>.</p> 
                <p>"Everything's so lovely and bright." She beamed at Ronnel and placed her hand on his proffered arm. "I expected a military vessel to be stuffy and cramped."</p> 
                <p>"We keep <i>Devil's Trident</i> in fighting trim," he said, puffing up his chest, "but I also enjoy my comfort. As Admiral of the Ostenso Fleet, I <i>do</i> require accommodations to entertain guests." He dismissed Draell with a wave and gestured toward the table. "A glass of wine before dinner?"</p> 
                <p>"I'd prefer whiskey, if you have a single malt handy."</p> 
                <p>"Whiskey?" Ronnel looked at her as if she'd asked him for a cup of freshly drawn blood. "Really?"</p> 
                <p>"<i>Really</i>, Milord Admiral." Vreva curved her lips in a licentious smile. Her request had caught him off guard, accomplishing exactly what she intended. "A dear friend introduced me to the pleasure of a finely crafted single malt whiskey." Memories of that friend and their ill-fated romance muddled her mind for a moment, but she thrust them aside and focused. "The flavor is so very... <i>smoldering</i>, don't you think?"</p> 
                <p>"I've never really tried whiskey, but I think my steward might be able to find something you'll like." Dragging his eyes away from hers, the admiral snapped his fingers and his steward hurried off, doubtlessly to delve the flagship's cellars. "You're a woman of eclectic tastes."</p> 
                <p>"Eclectic?" She shrugged and squeezed his arm. "Not to my thinking. I like my liquor like my men, strong and straight up."</p> 
                <p>Ronnel gaped at her for a moment, then laughed out loud. "By the stones of Asmodeus himself, you really <i>are</i> something!" He laughed again, fully and without reservation. "Quite refreshing! Quite refreshing indeed after so many simpering shrews. A <i>real</i> woman, not afraid to speak her piece to someone above her station. Quite refreshing!"</p> 
                <p>"Why, thank you, Admiral." <i>First task accomplished</i>. Vreva had just set her first impression in stone, distinguishing herself from any other woman the admiral might entertain. Squeezing his arm again, she joined in his laughter. "Not every man has the self-assurance to recognize me for what I am, but you've hit the proverbial nail on the head with the first stroke. No doubt one of your officers has told you of me."</p> 
                <p>"They have not. I swear it on my honor." Ronnel placed his hand over his heart and bowed. "Please, let's forget all this propriety and simply enjoy ourselves. I can't think of a single person with whom I'd rather spend an unabashed evening of frivolity."</p> 
                <p>"Unabashed frivolity just <i>happens</i> to be one of my favorite pastimes, Admiral." Vreva beamed up at him, enjoying the blush that rose to his cheeks. She had him exactly where she wanted him: mirth up, inhibitions down, and his libido ready to jump out of his pants and prance around the cabin.</p> 
                <p>"Very good!"</p> 
                <p>The steward arrived with a bottle that looked like it had spent several years rolling around the ship's bilge. The label was barely legible, but when the steward proffered it for inspection, she recognized the crest of a New Stetven distillery in distant Brevoy.</p> 
                <p>"Ah, you have good taste, Admiral! Let's give it a try."</p> 
                <p>"Damn the ballistae and full sail ahead! Ha ha!" The admiral snatched up two tumblers from the sideboard and clapped them down on the table. "I do believe I'll join you!"</p> 
                <p>"Please, allow me to serve your first taste!" Vreva plucked the bottle from the startled steward's hands, expertly cracked the seal, and twisted the stopper free with a resonant pop. She poured a measure into each glass and held one out to Ronnel. "To a night of unabashed frivolity."</p> 
                <p>He took his glass and glowed at her. "To that, Madame Korvis, I will drink!"</p> 
                <p>And they did.</p> 
                <p>The heady flavors of smoky peat and malt exploded in Vreva's senses, but she was prepared for the shock of it. She gasped in a cleansing breath, enjoying the liquid fire that warmed her throat and stomach. The admiral's gasp evolved into a fit of coughing, his face turning an astonishing shade of scarlet before he managed to draw a full breath.</p> 
                <p>"Rather takes you off guard, doesn't it?" She relieved him of his tumbler before he dropped it.</p> 
                <p>"Like a summer squall!" He coughed again and tried to smile. </p> 
                <p>"It's an acquired taste."</p> 
                <p>"I think I'll stick with wine." Ronnel motioned the steward forward.</p> 
                <p>"To each his own poison." Vreva strolled around the vast cabin, brushing her fingers lightly over the requisite portrait of Queen Abrogail II, and peering in admiration at the crossed swords mounted on the bulkhead behind Ronnel's broad desk. "This cabin is positively lovely! Would it be possible to get a tour of the rest of the ship?"</p> 
                <p>"After dinner we can take a turn on deck, but I'm afraid most of the ship's off-limits to visitors." The admiral joined her, sipping a glass of deep-red wine. "This cabin is for formal dinners and meetings, mostly. I sometimes host dinners for the captains of the fleet here, but I generally use it as an office. I have more intimate quarters for entertaining... special friends."</p> 
                <p><i>Not too subtle, are we, Admiral?</i> Vreva gave him a sultry smile. "I'd love to see them."</p> 
                <p>"After dinner, then." He guided her back to the table with a hand at the small of her back as two stewards entered bearing several covered dishes. "I've arranged quite a feast for us. I have one of the finest culinary slaves money can buy, you know."</p> 
                <p>"Really?" Vreva wondered about people who used slaves as their personal chefs. Didn't they realize how easy it was to poison someone? </p> 
                <p>Hoping that tonight wasn't the night the enslaved chef decided to rebel, Vreva took the seat a servant held for her. Just as Ronnel took his own seat, however, a knock sounded at the door. When the steward answered, a harried lieutenant burst into the cabin, gasping for breath and dabbing a handkerchief at four parallel scratches etched across his cheek. Vreva recognized him from the Officers' Club—the disgruntled lieutenant.</p> 
                <p>"Milord Admiral!" The officer saluted stiffly. "I beg your pardon, but there's an emergency, sir." </p> 
                <p>The admiral flushed crimson, the veins in his neck and face bulging. "Pardon me for a moment, my dear. The drudgeries of command again, I'm afraid."</p> 
                <p>"I understand perfectly, Admiral." Vreva smiled sweetly and sipped her whiskey as her host thrust himself out of his chair.</p> 
                <p> Ronnel stalked over to the injured lieutenant and backed him up against the door, his voice harsh and low. "This <i>better</i> be important, Lieutenant Emero, or you'll be scrubbing the bilges for a month!"</p> 
                <p>"It's that <i>witch</i> again, sir!"</p> 
                <p>Vreva could just make out the officer's hushed words. She gazed out the window as if entranced by the view, covertly watching the two men's reflections in the glass. She longed to cast a mind-reading or eavesdropping spell, but didn't dare with a servant hovering at her elbow. Even casting a silent spell might be noticed.</p> 
                <p>"What's she done now?" the admiral demanded.</p> 
                <p>Emero lowered his voice further, and Vreva strained to hear.</p> 
                <p>"She's... with that... and that bloody devil hit my... the infirmary... and when I... blood on my... immediately... "</p> 
                <p>"Right now?"</p> 
                <p>In the window's reflection, Vreva saw the admiral cast her a quick glance, then turn to glare at the poor lieutenant. </p> 
                <p>"I'm sorry, sir, but she... "</p> 
                <p>"Oh, <i>fine</i>! Wait here." Ronnel returned to the table and bowed to Vreva. "I'm very sorry, my dear, but I'm afraid I'm being called away."</p> 
                <p>"Oh, how <i>dreadful</i>!" Vreva put on her best pout and stood. "Can I wait for you here?"</p> 
                <p>"I don't know when I'll get back, but if you like, please stay and enjoy the meal. I'll be an hour, at least, but could be longer."</p> 
                <p>"Oh, I could never accept your hospitality without the pleasure of your company, Admiral." Vreva leaned forward to brush his cheek with her own, her voice a sultry whisper. "There's no hurry. An unabashed evening of frivolity must be done properly, you know." She trailed her nails down his taut waistcoat.</p> 
                <p>"Oh, I agree." Ronnel stepped back and took her hand in his, bending to kiss it. "I'll arrange another dinner, and we'll do it properly. You have my pledge of honor."</p> 
                <p>"I'll hold you to it, Admiral." Vreva curtsied again.</p> 
                <p>"Jensen, escort the lady off the ship and hail a carriage." The admiral cast Vreva one more longing glance before stalking out of the cabin, Lieutenant Emero at his heels.</p> 
                <p><i>Well, that was a waste of time!</i> Smiling sweetly despite her disappointment, Vreva accepted her shawl from the steward and wrapped it around her shoulders. She looked wistfully at the dishes on the table. The covers hadn't even been removed, but the tantalizing aromas made her mouth water. Maybe she should have taken Ronnel up on his offer and dined alone, but it would have given the wrong impression. She'd done the right thing. She did, however, finish her whiskey before she followed the steward back through the labyrinthine passages. She caught the faint sound of distant raised voices, and considered what she'd overheard. <i>Devils and witches and blood, oh my</i>... </p> 
                <p>As her carriage approached, Vreva felt a surge of urgency. <i>Mathias</i>. She sent him a nudge of affirmation, and feigned a misstep as she boarded the hackney. Her marine escort caught her arm, and she pressed against him long enough for Mathias to slip ahead of her, his black fur rendering him virtually invisible in the darkness. Thanking her escort, she stepped up and settled into the carriage.</p> 
                <p>What the hell happened? Mathias mewed as they jerked into motion. </p> 
                <p>"The admiral was called away. Something to do with this witch of theirs. There might also be a devil involved, too, though it could have been just a turn of phrase."</p> 
                <p>Are you kidding me? This is Cheliax! If someone says devil, they're probably talking about a <i>real</i> one!</p> 
                <p>"Regardless, I think we need a different strategy."</p> 
                <p>A little feline reconnaissance?</p> 
                <p>"Exactly." Vreva scratched Mathias under the chin, but he was already purring with excitement. "One more ship's cat should go unnoticed, though getting you aboard might be tricky. They scan everyone who comes aboard for magic."</p> 
                <p>As long as you don't use a <i>cat</i>-apult, I'm in!</p> 
                <p>"Oh, my love, that was dreadful." She picked him up and nuzzled the back of his neck. Born an ordinary cat, Mathias had only been speaking since becoming her familiar less than a year ago, and was still learning the finer points of language. Unfortunately, he was also learning how to pun. "Stick to chasing rats."</p> 
                <p>I'm so unappreciated... </p> 
                <p>"Celeste?"</p> 
                <p>Something brushed through her hair, shattering the song of the heavens into a thousand shards. Celeste whirled and lashed out, fangs extended.</p> 
                <p>"Celeste!" Torius jerked his hand back. "Gozreh's guts! What's gotten into you?"</p> 
                <p>"Torius!" She slithered back, her panic receding, though her heart still raced. Then she saw the blood on the back of his hand. "By the stars! Torius, I'm sorry! I didn't... Clean it! Quickly!" If any of her venom got into his bloodstream, his addiction might flare back to life. Lunar naga venom was dangerously habit-forming, and that dependency had nearly destroyed their relationship once before. He'd all but accused her of trying to enslave him, and she'd thought he wanted to be rid of her. The last thing either of them wanted was to go through that again. </p> 
                <p>"I'm fine. It's just a scratch." He wiped the tiny trickle of blood away and sucked on the wound. "Be more careful, will you?"</p> 
                <p>"You startled me!" Dread descended on her like a shroud. Once more, she'd lost herself so deeply in the stars that she'd been oblivious to her surroundings. <i>What's happening to me</i>? <i>Maybe I </i>have<i> been cursed</i>... </p> 
                <p>Celeste didn't know what to think. Her inability to speak or understand a word of Taldane during the battle with the slavers might have been a spell cast by the dying wizard, but she wasn't sure. The shimmering cloak of stars that shielded her from enemy blades and arrows, however, had come from within her. She had felt the magic arise from deep inside her. It hadn't been a spell, at least not in the way she was used to casting spells, but something... internal. The magic might have protected her, but it also scared the hell out of her. And now she had bitten Torius.</p> 
                <p>"You're sure you're okay? How do you feel?"</p> 
                <p>"I'm fine." He sucked again at the tiny scratch and spat over the rail. "No venom got in. Believe me, I'd know."</p> 
                <p>"Thank the stars!" She felt a flood of relief, but still the nagging worry. <i>Cursed</i>... "Don't touch me like that when I'm stargazing. You startled me."</p> 
                <p>"Well, you can bet your scaly tail I won't do it again!" </p> 
                <p>"I <i>said</i> I was sorry."</p> 
                <p>"Forget it. No harm done." Torius reached out to touch her again, but she reared back out of reach. He stopped and stared at her. "What's <i>wrong</i> with you?"</p> 
                <p>"Nothing. I'm just rattled, I guess." Celeste glanced around the quarterdeck, but nothing seemed amiss. They were still sailing northbound, though the lights of Almas weren't yet visible. In fact, the only lights other than the stars were those of the captured galley following a mile in their wake. "What's going on?"</p> 
                <p>"Nothing serious. I just need our position. It's almost midnight."</p> 
                <p>"Of course." She had apparently been lost for hours again, and hadn't even heard the ship's bell tolling the watch change. <i>Cursed</i>... She took quick sightings on Bretheda and Castrovel, and ran through her calculations, grateful for something to occupy her mind for a while. Only after marking the chart and jotting down the time did she realize that Torius was staring at her. "What?"</p> 
                <p>"Nothing. You just seem jittery." He noted their position on the chart, ordered a minor course change, then returned to her. "You're sure you're all right?"</p> 
                <p>"I <i>am</i> a little jittery, I guess. I don't know. Perhaps that close call aboard the slave galley unnerved me." She wanted to tell him about the strange spell, that she felt it might be linked to her inability to communicate during the fight, but couldn't force herself to form the words. Celeste glanced about the quarterdeck at the sailors bustling about in their duties. Sailors were notoriously superstitious, so later might be better, when they could talk privately. Or maybe she shouldn't tell him at all. <i>Should I tell him about this</i>?</p> 
                <p>A curious feeling washed over her. The song of the heavens resounded in her mind, but unlike the feeling of rightness she'd felt when she suddenly knew taking the slave ship was the correct thing to do, she now felt a swirling uncertainty, a morass of good and bad, benefit and detriment, boon and bane. She shook her head at the strange sensation, and thought for a moment she heard musical laughter. She twisted, scanning the deck for the source, so clear and loud, but it wasn't any voice she'd ever heard. <i>Now I'm hearing voices in my head! What the hell's happening to me?</i></p> 
                <p>"Celeste!" Torius reached out to her again, and she couldn't shy away. Not from him. His warm hands felt good on her scales. Soothing. Familiar. "What's wrong? You look like you just saw a ghost!"</p> 
                <p>"I... don't know." That was the truth at least. <i>Hearing voices, strange spells, speaking in tongues</i>... Her mind whirled with potential causes, none of them good. <i>Is this what it feels like to be possessed by a spirit or demon</i>? "I just... feel strange. I can't explain it."</p> 
                <p>"Just try to relax." He pulled her into a comforting embrace. "We'll be in Almas today, and it'll take at least a couple of days to get the ship straightened out. Snick said we sprung a few joints coming up against that galley, and they'll need to be repaired. We can afford to take a little time for ourselves."</p> 
                <p>"Time—you mean a few days off?" Maybe that was all she needed.</p> 
                <p>"Sure. We'll have to meet with our contact, of course, but after that... how about a night on the town? Almas is a big city. There are lots of places you haven't visited yet."</p> 
                <p>"That would be nice." Celeste smiled and leaned into Torius's warm arms. Almas also undoubtedly had innumerable wizards and clerics who might be able to discern what was wrong with her. <i>Maybe I can even find someone to lift this curse</i>... </p>

                <p>Emil became the source of great scandal when he was born to a pair of affluent merchants in the Andoren capital of Almas. Normally a tiefling in Andoran wouldn't raise many eyebrows; however, Emil's parents were former nobles who had refused to face exile and instead grudgingly capitulated to the growing zeitgeist that gripped Andoran during the People's Revolt. Though they had never roused enough ire to warrant a visit from the Eagle Knights, the Kovkorins were quite vocal about their dissenting opinions on the eradication of the aristocracy, often clashing with their nation's lofty, democratic ideals.</p> 
                <p>Emil's parents tried to hide the boy's fiendish nature from the public, but the young tiefling's distinctive tail—and the smoke that poured out of his differently colored eyes whenever his emotions got the better of him—made their attempts futile. Convinced that the old money in Andoran took part in seditious practices against the government, rabble-rousers pointed at Emil as proof that the former nobility were truly loyal to themselves, House Thrune, and even Hell itself. Enemies of Emil's family used the boy as a rallying point for those who shared their views about Andoran's overthrown class system, and fingered the family for being part of the Seven Houses, a conspiracy of one-time nobles who still used their wealth to influence the nation.</p> 
                <p>In truth, Emil's parents did indeed belong to the Seven Houses, and had recently accepted a large sum of money and promises for security from House Thrune in exchange for swaying votes in the People's Council in favor of laws that might benefit Cheliax and delivering information on Eagle Knight activities. At first, these accusations hardly mattered to the furious noble couple, who had faced the same opposition before. However, they saw their Hell-spawned son as a political liability and locked him away in a cellar beneath their impressive manor house. But when the Eagle Knights finally came calling to their estate, Emil's parents chose exile over death, and abandoned their 8-year-old son along with their other gifts from House Thrune.</p> 
                <p>The estate fell to the government, and a few weeks later, the bureaucrat who came to catalog the new assets—an elderly minister of trade and commerce from the Demarchy Assembly—discovered Emil in the basement, sitting in a cloud of smoke and tears. Whether in an act of egalitarian charity or wily foresight, the minister adopted Emil as his ward, taking the boy back to his home.</p> 
                <p>For the first time in his life, Emil freely walked the streets of his home city, though he soon learned that his noble heritage attracted as much negative attention as his fiendish one. He quickly became deft with disguises—much more so than his parents had been. He found that he enjoyed the feeling of power that came with anonymity and a changeable identity in these undercover excursions, though he struggled to find an identity that fit him. Under various guises he fought in brawls down in Portside, spied on the logging operations in Timberfell, and snuck in to performances in the Theater District.</p> 
                <p>He also had a taste of his parents' former high-class lifestyle, thanks to his mentor. The old man groomed the lad for a landscape of political intrigue, paying for a swordfighting trainer and bringing Emil along to dinners, balls, and other high-society functions in Almas. Emil never wore a disguise at these events, at his mentor's request; the crafty politician liked how the tiefling's eerie eyes unsettled his political opponents.</p> 
                <p>Emil delighted in this as well, and soon began finding other ways to subtly advance his mentor's agendas—in secret, of course. A rival politician might lose an important document, for example, or an uncooperative union organizer might get in a fight with a stranger on the street and end up with a broken jaw. Emil never cared much about the actual politics involved, but thrilled to see his power displayed in his targets' suffering. With each misdeed, Emil's schemes grew increasingly cruel, vindictive, and enjoyable.</p> 
                <p>All this came to a head one day when Emil returned home to find his mentor fretting about international trade negotiations. A Drumish diplomat apparently had some incriminating evidence against Emil's patron, and threatened to expose everything unless Druma received extraordinarily generous terms. With sudden inspiration, Emil excused himself calmly and walked down the hall to his chamber, his eyes wafting trails of smoke in barely contained excitement.</p> 
                <p>Later that night, a half-elven Eagle Knight approached the Drumish embassy—which had once been the mansion of Emil's parents—with an urgent message for the diplomat to be delivered to his hands only. The earnest young Eagle Knight was granted an audience, and as soon as he and the diplomat were alone in the mirror-trimmed parlor, the disguised Emil pounced, driving a dagger up through the man's jaw. As the would-be blackmailer bled out in the tiefling's arms, Emil caught his reflection in one of the large silver mirrors on the wall. Smoke coursed from his eyes—one black, one red—and the warm blood flecking his skin made his sharp-toothed grin all the wider.</p> 
                <p>As he dropped the lifeless body to the ground, he realized he'd been searching for this identity all along, the mask he would wear forevermore: he would be the face of death in Almas.</p> 
                <p>Since that night, Emil has claimed dozens of unsuspecting lives—sometimes for gold, sometimes for fun. He has never lost the thrill of walking in public disguised, knowing he possesses the power to end the life of any person he meets on the street unnoticed. Nor has he forgotten the exhilaration of watching a victim die, not even when he took a bag of gold from a Lumber Consortium officer to end the life of his adopted father.</p> 
                <p>Emil doesn't frequent state events anymore unless he is working, but he is intimately familiar with the already-rotting underbelly of the ruling class in the young nation of Andoran, and takes contracts from government officials as often as from those with more private interests. Each time he kills, he lingers to watch death take hold of his new victim before vanishing back into the night, leaving nothing more than a few wisps of smoke.</p>

               <p>The two slots on Monday were eerily repetitive yet uniquely enjoyable because I first played then GMed <a href="/products/btpy9hh0"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-13: Captive in Crystal</em></a>. The first table (expertly run by Venture-Lieutenant Landon Hatfield) had some of the most bizarre characters, including a kitsune cleric of Daikitsu who stayed in Tiny fox form, a body-building monk/paladin of Kurgess (for some reason I never considered Kurgess as a patron of paladins, but it was fun), and an extraordinarily plucky investigator/swashbuckler fashioned after Nancy Drew—all teamed up with my "cleric" of the reformed Church of Razmir. When I ran the same adventure a few hours later, I had the pleasure of introducing a player's black blade magus to his intelligent sword ("What's your blade's agenda? Oh, would you like me to help you come up with one? Oh good..."), which kept whispering promises about something called "the Reclamation." We figured out that the chaotic good scimitar has somewhat cutthroat dreams of destroying Taldor and conquering it in Qadira's name, and by the end of the adventure, the magus had secured substantial resources that might fuel Kelishite aggression against their northern neighbors.</p> 
               <p>All in all, it was a great deal of fun. If you have a chance to make the trip to SCARAB in the future, I strongly encourage you check it out.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>In the meantime, why not plan ahead to experience some new stories together? This month we have two new adventures debuting this week. The first launches a three-part, Tier 1-5 series called "Faithless and Forgotten," in which infernal Cheliax opens its borders once more to Pathfinder explorers. During <a href="/products/btpy9huv"><em>Let Bygones Be</em></a>, the PCs are among the first sanctioned Pathfinders to travel Cheliax in decades, and their first destination is a relic of the Chelish civil war. In order to get there, they'll need to travel through the fortified port of Corentyn, where the streets are dangerous despite—or perhaps because of—the brutal regime's guards. It's up to the PCs to make a good first impression and make the most of this preliminary foray. Of course, the last time we traveled to Cheliax on official business, the Pathfinder Society had an official liaison to that nation: Paracountess Zarta Dralneen. Always one for formality, Cheliax has issued a new liaison to the Grand Lodge. As you can imagine, Zarta is going to be so thrilled to meet her replacement. This was also a great opportunity to revisit some known locations and personalities in Corentyn, including one Zefiro Balinger who plays a rather central role in the upcoming adventure.</p> 
               <p>About three years ago, the organized play campaign retired the Lantern Lodge as a playable faction, and it's certainly easy to assume that the Lantern Lodge itself (an estate in Goka) just faded into obscurity. In fact, the faction retired largely because it had fulfilled its goals of achieving recognition and resources for the Society's exploration of Tian Xia. I like to revisit the continent several times a season, and this month we're doing something a little different. Rather than just letting the players know that Venture-Captain Amara Li is still in charge of a thriving lodge, this time the PCs are working for her directly to hunt down an Aspis Consortium aggressor. What's more, this adventure has special metaplot opportunities for former members of the Lantern Lodge faction. That's not the only unique element in <a href="/products/btpy9huw"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-15: The Deepmarket Deception</em></a>. We're also exploring a hitherto unseen part of that metropolis: the Deepmarket tunnels that crisscross the city's foundation and overflow with smugglers and illicit commerce. Prepare for a Tier 3-7 challenge that expands on the events of <a href="/products/btpy9cu0"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a>!</p>

               <p>As we gear up for this year's convention season, it's time again to solicit volunteers!</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">Paizo is once again a co-sponsor of Gen Con 2016. As with last year, we will have a booth &amp; card game demos in the Exhibition Hall, seminars in the Convention Center, and Pathfinder Society running in the Sagamore Ballroom.</p> 
               <p>Last year saw the culmination of several years' growth, during which Pathfinder Society at Gen Con expanded from a side room to all of the Sagamore Ballroom. While we aren't adding any space this year, we're changing up some of the programming. The <a href="/pfsacg">Adventure Card Guild (ACG)</a> will have 20 tables in its own area of the ballroom, where they are going to run Season of the Runelords. In addition, the ACG Open returns to test the mettle of our Card Guildees, and the Friday night interactive will include an ACG component. There are a few other programming related plans to finalize, and we'll reveal more information on those on the blog sometime in Febraury.</p> 
               <p>On the <a href="/pathfindersociety">Roleplaying Guild</a> (RPG) side, we're offering scenarios covering the second half of Season 7 and the first few of Season 8, as well as bringing back a few favorites. We have several special events planned, including an all-new interactive on Friday evening! In addition, a new series of quests will debut, and there are a few other things up our sleeve to be announced in February.</p> 
               <p>One of the biggest changes this year is the new "Pathfinder Society Academy" (PSA). Encompassing the <a href="/products/btpy8vq8"><em>Kid's Track</em></a> offered in prior years, it expands to a third lesson track focusing on transitioning to full scenarios. With 10 tables in their own area of the ballroom, the PSA includes space for our younger GMs and players to have an experience tailored just for them. Games in PSA are family-friendly and sure to bring a smile to our younger players' faces.</p> 
               <p>The Gen Con lead volunteers and the PFS team worked together to determine a scheduling method to cover volunteer needs for slots while also maximizing free time (allowing folks to join in some of the fantastic Gen Con activities). One of the changes you'll see is the additional of a break between the morning and afternoon slots. This year, games in the Sagamore Ballroom will be run in three slots (8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM), with the exception of Sunday (9:00 AM to 2:00 PM). The Exhibition Hall demos will be run from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with the exception of Sunday (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM).</p> 
               <p>Volunteer slots are scheduled as follows:</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Here at PACG Headquarters, we love making promo cards! Sometimes, we get a little... out there. For example, Sweet Dragon Costume is a goblin in a kobold suit who is so completely convinced that he's a dragon that he can <i>scare monsters to death</i>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Promo-SweetDragonCostumer.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Promo-SweetDragonCostumer_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Rawr.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>But okay, there's one place we take promo cards very seriously. That's in the <a href="/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes</a> miniatures boxes, because man, have you seen how cool those minis are? We want to hold up our end of the bargain. Now, you've already seen <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgw7">what we did with sets 1 through 3</a>. So check out some of these swank promo cards in <a href="/products/btpy9f9q">Set #4</a> and <a href="/products/btpy9f9p">Set #5</a>.</p> 
               <h2>Iconic Heroes Set #4</h2> 
               <p>Here are some cards for three of our most complex characters. Note that all these cards have the Owner trait; that means that the character whose name is on the card can treat it as a Basic card. That's <i>huge</i>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-BloodcrowRapier.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-BloodcrowRapier_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-ShoantiEarthbreaker.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-ShoantiEarthbreaker_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-RitualCenser.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-RitualCenser_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>You'd look grumpy too if Shardra boiled stuff behind your face.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The goal with these promos is to interact well with what the character does naturally. So Jirelle's Bloodcrow Rapier not only scales up with her by adventure deck number, it has a power which enables her to add the Swashbuckling trait to any check to defeat a bane—even if it's not a combat check. For example, the Skull &amp; Shackles villain Caulky Tarroon can be defeated by a Dexterity check, but if you don't add the Swashbuckling trait, she's gonna banish the top card of someone's deck. Bloodcrow Rapier makes that problem go away.</p> 
               <p>Shoanti Earthbreaker deals with one of the most frustrating types of cards in the game: Constructs. Golems and other Constructs routinely turn off spellcasters' powers, including those of Crowe. The Earthbreaker means he doesn't really worry about that much. He just pummels them into oblivion.</p> 
               <p>Ritual Censer is one of my favorite cards in this group. Not only does it help Shardra acquire spells, but it feeds off her natural tendency to have characters bunch up around her. While she's helping people with their checks to defeat banes and succeed at Knowledge checks, Ritual Censer helps <i>other characters</i> succeed at checks to close Shardra's location. That's some fine synergy at work.</p> 
               <h2>Iconic Heroes Set #5</h2> 
               <p>By the way, these cards aren't limited to the characters who own them. Take a look at Kess's card. Who wouldn't want to punch their way into better Diplomacy checks? And everyone can, because you don't need to be Kess to play it. And this is good, since we kinda haven't released Kess yet.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-IronKnuckles.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-IronKnuckles_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-OrcWarDrum.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-OrcWarDrum_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Watch out for the spikes.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>On the other hand, you want to be Oloch when you play the Orc War Drum. Oloch might be the best character at moving cards around. Displaying weapons and blessings to add to checks, discarding armors and blessings to heal, banishing allies to explore—if it's a card, he can do something cool with it. Orc War Drum lets him get some of those cards back, and enable others to burn allies to boost anybody's check at your location.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Leryn.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Leryn_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-Leryn.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-Leryn_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Double your pleasure, double your fun! Have two Leryns instead of one!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Hey, it's Leryn! As an ally! When Adowyn uses one of her powers that says "a card that has the Animal trait," Leryn is suddenly available for her—<i>twice</i>. Now it's not such a big deal to shuffle the cohort Leryn into Adowyn's deck, because the ally Leryn is waiting to be played. That's versatility right there.</p> 
               <p>Pretty cool stuff, says me. Promo-worthy, you might say.</p>

               <p>At least that's how I'd rather remember it. Ultimately, it comes down to telling a fun story, and today we add two more fun stories to the list of sanctioned Adventure Paths: <em>Iron Gods</em> and <em>Giantslayer</em>. I recognize that it's been quite a while since I first acknowledged that I would sanction these adventures for the organized play campaign, and I know that some of you already started playing them. In the past, we've prohibited retroactive credit for adventures played before the Chronicle sheets were available. This time we're doing something a little different. If you are still in the middle of playing one of these Adventure Paths but have not yet concluded it, you can receive retroactive credit for all of that Adventure Path's earlier volumes the next time you earn a Chronicle sheet for that campaign. For example, if you're just about to finish #93 of <em>Giantslayer</em>, when you receive that Chronicle sheet, you can also earn the Chronicle sheets for #91 and #92.</p>

               <p itemprop="description"><a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of prepainted plastic <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> fantasy gaming figures is officially out and available in the wild! You can pick them up from your local retailer order the figures by <a href="/products/btpy9er4">case or brick</a>, or select your favorites from the list of <a href="/pathfinderbattles/singles/rustyDragonInn">singles</a> available from the set. I've been hearing from folks with an <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Ongoing Case Subscription</a> that subscriber cases have begun to arrive, and as you're all opening your minis or deciding which ones to get, I'd like to take a moment to look at the set as a whole and share some of my thoughts about how it came together, and how it turned out.</p> 
               <p>I've always wanted to do a <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set themed around a tavern. Most of my own campaigns tend to spend a lot of time in the city, and player characters can't help but get themselves into trouble when they're visiting the local watering hole. Paizo's tavern-themed <a href="/pathfinder/maps/flipMats">Flip-Mats</a> almost always sell out soon after we print them, proving that I'm not the only one who says "roll initiative" as often as "what'll you have?" when my player characters enter the tavern.</p> 
               <p>When we announced <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set several months ago, I knew that some folks would be concerned that the set was too NPC-heavy, so I made sure to include as many cool monsters as I possibly could, with a slight bias toward creatures I thought worked well in an urban environment (namely, ghouls). We also had a few hold-overs originally intended for earlier sets, like <a href="/products/btpy9it5">Zilvazaraat</a>, the <a href="/products/btpy9it3">Large Silver Dragon</a>, and the <a href="/products/btpy9ist">Gorgon</a>. And, perhaps most importantly, the set gave us a chance to execute an idea I've been kicking around with WizKids for a long time—doing a major terrain piece as a special limited edition "case incentive" figure, in this case the <a href="/products/btpy9ehn">Tavern Bar</a>. Add to this the continuing experiment with dungeon dressing and my first chance to include things like the <a href="/products/btpy9itb">Cart</a> and <a href="/products/btpy9itc">Large Cart</a>, and you've got a set I've been excited about for a long, long time. It's finally here, and here are some of my own thoughts from along the way, and especially from opening my own personal case last weekend.</p> 
               <h2>Dungeon Dressing</h2> 
               <p>I'm thrilled with how the dungeon dressing came out for <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>. From a gamer perspective, like a lot of you, I'd prefer more <a href="/products/btpy9it7">tables</a>, <a href="/products/btpy9ita">crates</a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9it8">barrels</a> than are included in a single case, but I'm also sensitive to folks who don't enjoy their monster or NPC figures being swapped out for a piece of furniture. Demand for these pieces is extremely high (I think they all sold out within a couple of days of our first singles release batch), and that's a factor we will continue to weigh with WizKids to determine the best mix in future releases. The next set also contains a bunch of cool dungeon dressing pieces, and I'm eager for you to get a look at them. Beyond that, anything is possible. Please leave a note in the comments with suggestions of additional pieces of dungeon dressing you'd like to see in future sets.</p> 
               <h2>Singles Sales</h2> 
               <p><a href="/pathfinderbattles/singles/rustyDragonInn">Singles</a> from <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> have sold incredibly well, with 14 figures already out of stock on paizo.com within the first week of the set's release. That's a phenomenal show of support for the set, and I think it probably bodes well for the overall sales we're expecting to see this time around. We know that the new paizo.com sales strategy for singles (ending sales at the end of the month) caused some alarm with subscribers who did not have their case to know what they might want or need before high-demand singles started vanishing from the site, and I've had a chat with our warehouse and web store team, and I'm confident that we will be releasing at least one more "wave" of singles before the end of the month, timed after we believe most subscribers will have received their cases. Watch this space very closely in the coming weeks for an announcement when this next batch goes on sale. We'll do the best we can to make sure that if you want a single from this set, you'll have a good chance of getting it, so long as you act quickly.</p> 
               <h2>Rusty Dragon Flip-Mat?</h2> 
               <p>In recent comment threads regarding the set, I've seen a lot of suggestions that we release a Rusty Dragon Inn Flip-Mat scaled to the <a href="/products/btpy9ehn">Tavern Bar</a> case incentive and designed for optimal use with the set. I think that's a fantastic idea, and I'm relatively confident that we'll do it—eventually. The actual size and contents of the <a href="/products/btpy9ehn">Tavern Bar</a> set were in flux until very late in the game, and I want to be able to match the scale on this stuff exactly so that everything fits the way it should. Suffice it to say, this is very likely coming, but probably not as rapidly as you might like it to. A good idea is worth taking the time to do right.</p> 
               <h2>Overall Impressions</h2> 
               <p>I'm thrilled with this set overall. As usual when you crack a case, some elements of rarity choices become more clear in your hand and on your table than they did in your head. Had I a chance to do it again, I might move the <a href="/products/btpy9is5">Bunyip</a> to uncommon, for example, but that's really just a quibble. The paint jobs on the rares are remarkable (especially <a href="/products/btpy9isx">Allevrah, Elf General</a>), and overall I think the factory did a good job, even on the faces (which is one of the toughest aspects of making these miniatures). I'm really happy with a lot of the figure and rarity choices, and I'm eager to use these figures on the table. I've already used the <a href="/products/btpy9isw">Half-Elf Enchanter</a> as a conductor leading a little band of a <a href="/products/btpy9isv">Half-Elf Bard</a>, a small circle of <a href="/products/btpy9ise">Dwarf Bard</a> drummers, and three <a href="/products/btpy9is9">Dancing Girls</a>. That's an encounter right there. I love it when random collections of figures from a single set fit so well together.</p> 
               <p>So, what do you think of the set? What are your favorite figures? Where do you think we could have done a better job? And, as always, what else would you like to see in future sets?</p> 
               <p>Let's debrief <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> in comments!</p> 
               <p>I'll bring the beer.</p> 
               <p>Until next time, I remain...</p>

               <p itemprop="description">A few weeks ago, I announced the first in a series of competitions aimed toward Pathfinder Society members. The response illustrates the fantastic talents our players possess. While their creations graced tables, it took being in the right place at the right time to admire them. On that note, thank you to the artists for sharing your creations. Submitting items for public perusal can be daunting and I appreciate your willingness to let us look.</p> 
               <p>But enough of me typing, let's get to the fun part—looking at all the images and choosing your favorite. Voting opens now and continues until Friday, February 5 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. I'll announce the winners in the Pathfinder Society blog the following Monday, along with the next competition category.</p>

               <p>Not all spellbooks are created equal—and I'm not talking about the handy waterproof or travel-sized versions. In <a href="/products/btpy9fqk"><em>Arcane Anthology</em></a>, certain tomes will grant additional abilities when you prepare from them with the Ritualistic Preparation feat, like the formula book known as the <em>Galtan Cookbook</em>, which grants the blast finesse action for alchemists.</p> 
               <p>Oh yes, there are more options in here than just for wizards—pretty much every arcane spellcaster is going to want to grab the <a href="/products/btpy9fqk"><em>Arcane Anthology</em></a>, for reasons such <em>force sword</em>, <em>grand destiny</em>, <em>Last Azlanti's defending sword</em>, and <em>splinter spell resistance</em>.</p>

                <p class="stat-block-1">You create a <em>+1 longsword</em> of pure force sized appropriately for you that you can wield or give to another creature like any other longsword. At 8th level, the <em>sword</em> functions as a <em>+2 longsword</em>. At 13th level, it functions as a <em>+3 longsword</em>. A <em>force sword</em> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic"><em>dispel magic</em></a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/disintegrate.html#disintegrate"><em>disintegrate</em></a>, a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/magicItems/artifacts.html#sphere-of-annihilation"><em>sphere of annihilation</em></a>, or a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/magicItems/rods.html#rod-of-cancellation"><em>rod of cancellation</em></a> affects it.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1">If a creature you attack with the <em>sword</em> has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the force sword strikes it. If you fail the check, the spell is dispelled. If you succeed, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>

               <p>In the Age of Anguish, there was one spellcaster whose name has survived even to the current Age of Lost Omens: Jatembe. Angels, gods, demons, the Ten Magic Warriors—these are the stuff of legends, and now your spellcaster can use the same legendary magic themselves. Spells like <em>celestial healing</em>, <em>Jatembe's ire</em> (which supposedly eradicated the lost city of Ird), and a number of mask-based feats help capture the glory that Old-Mage carved out of those terrible times in Golarion's past.</p> 
               <p>While this volume is called <a href="/products/btpy9fqk"><em>Arcane Anthology</em></a>, this is not solely devoted to students of the arcane. The eldritch scoundrel archetype for rogues, not to mention the Child of Acavna and Amaznen fighter archetype, are just some of the new content within—and it's shipping to your Friendly Local Gaming Store and subscribers now.</p> 
               <p>May you succeed on your next caster level check,</p>

               <h2><a href="/products/btpy9e8d">Barbarian</a></h2> 
               <p>As you might know from our excellent <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la16">Meet the Iconics</a> blog series, Amiri is a bad-ass chick with a big-ass sword from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, complete with Paizo Tragic Backstory™. We did a version of her giant-forged sword for <a href="/products/btpy98sx"><em>Iconic Heroes #2</em></a>, and we gave her some comfy armor in the Barbarian Class Deck.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZKPROMO-FrostGiantSword.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZKPROMO-FrostGiantSword_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-PeltOfTheUlfenWolf.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-PeltOfTheUlfenWolf_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Smashing in style!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The characters in this deck were designed with the <a href="/products/btpy9c25"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a> version of the barbarian's mechanics in mind, so expect to see a bit more variety and utility in their rage powers. As a clue, let me reveal that Amiri's new roles are called Immovable Object and Unstoppable Force.</p> 
               <h2><a href="/products/btpy9ezo">Oracle</a></h2> 
               <p>The next deck in the release schedule is for all you scouting fans out there: the <em>Oracle Class Deck</em>. To kick off the design process, the design team spent a delightful afternoon learning about the different and fascinating methods of divination used throughout human history. These include <i>armomancy</i>, or divining by examining one's shoulders, <i>labiomancy</i>, or divination by lip reading (which seemed a bit cheaty to us,) and <i>kephalomancy</i>, or divination by using a baked ass's head. We recommend setting your oven to 425° for that last one.</p> 
               <p>Technically we didn't use any of those divinatory methods in the final design, but you've gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet. (Talk to Chad about <i>oomancy</i> sometime.) We did, however, come up with Ramexes, a pitborn oracle who specializes in <i>haruspication</i>, or the reading of entrails, and we gave Alahazra a fancy hat in <a href="/products/btpy98sw"><em>Iconic Heroes #1</em></a>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br> <i>Oracles dress for the weather—there's actually another hat under this hat.</i>
               </div> 
               <h2><a href="/products/btpy9fqi">Alchemist</a></h2> 
               <p>To close out this week's column, we've got a sneak peek at the <i>Alchemist Class Deck</i>. Designers Liz Spain and Paul Peterson took point on this deck, which should terrify anyone who knows them. In addition to Damiel and his portable alchemy lab from <a href="/products/btpy99z3"><em>Iconic Heroes #3</em></a>, we're introducing the archetypal gnome alchemist. Meet Cogsnap:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br> <i>Tell me he's not exactly what you expected.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Cogsnap is fond of cards that have the Automaton trait, and you'll see a few new ones in his deck.</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week—until next time, Pathfinders!</p>

               <p>As anyone who has ever seen the official list of <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources">Additional Resources</a> knows, Pathfinder Society characters have many options. As anyone who is a regular on our forums knows, some of these options can be interpreted in different ways. When these rules ambiguities crop up in a home campaign, where a player is likely to have only one GM, the GM and the player can work together to find a satisfying solution. In the organized play campaign, where players are likely to have many GMs over the course of each character’s adventures, these ambiguities can lead to substantially different rules interpretations from table to table. We created this document to help reach one of goals of organized play—to provide an equitable gaming experience to players all over the world. The Clarifications Document is a centralized place for us to offer official rulings for ambiguous rules.</p> 
               <p>Many of these interpretations are the suggestions of the developers who worked on the rules in the first place, which have until now been unofficial posts on the messageboards. Others come out of Additional Resources, which we will be trimming down a bit in the next update. The last source is a list of ambiguities I’ve been saving until we had a clear plan for how to address them. I’m sure some of you will notice a couple of rules elements mentioned in the Clarifications Document that are not currently legal in Pathfinder Society. These elements will appear in our next update of <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources">Additional Resources</a>.</p> 
               <p>While GMs are free to use clarifications from this document in their home campaigns if they wish, these are not official errata. The Clarifications Document principally addresses rules material that appears in softcover sources such as the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/campaignSetting">Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a> and <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/companion">Pathfinder Player Companion</a> lines, rather than the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a> hardcover books. As part of our Additional Resources process, we plan to revisit this document each month and make changes if necessary. What rules ambiguities have you seen in your Pathfinder Society games that you would like to see resolved?</p>

               <h2>Singles Sales</h2> 
               <p>
                <link>Single figures from the set are on sale now here at paizo.com. We're changing the way we stock and sell single figures for the foreseeable future, starting with <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>. Henceforth Paizo will be stocking significantly fewer singles for all new sets, with sales lasting as long as our limited supplies last. Singles sales of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> on paizo.com will cease at the end of January. It's possible that some will re-appear later, but these will be figures cycled through the secondary market rather than from a vast supply that we keep in our warehouse. If you prefer to snipe the handful of figures you want as singles rather than buying boosters, bricks, or cases, be aware that you're going to have to act more rapidly than you're used to in order to get the figures you want. We MAY restock singles during January, but after that the entire set will be removed from singles sales indefinitely.</p>

               <p>WizKids has taken the opportunity of this set's release to re-release repainted versions of two figures that did not match their quality control standards from previous sets, namely King Irovetti from <a href="/products/btpy909j"><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a> and Feiya, Human Witch from <a href="/products/btpy92s9"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a>. These figures are repainted versions of the same sculpts, with improved paint application from their previous versions. WizKids has packed both replacement figures into a single unmarked "super-booster" in each case of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>. The two figures are in addition to the four regular figures in each booster, totaling six figures per "super-booster."</p> 
               <p>If you're already an <a href="/products/btpy8o6b"><em>ongoing Pathfinder Battles case subscriber</em></a>, you need do nothing to receive these two free replacement figures. Customers buying a full case of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> will likewise receive the super-booster. As usual with these sorts of things, collation is not guaranteed.</p> 
               <p>If you own an unsatisfactory original version of Feiya or King Irovetti but are not currently an <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">ongoing Pathfinder Battles case subscriber</a> you can receive a replacement figure direct from WizKids through their <a href="http://wizkidsreplacementsystem.com" target="_blank">standard figure replacement system</a>.</p> 
               <p>We've listed a small number of the <a href="/products/btpy9iyg">Feiya</a> and <a href="/products/btpy9iyh">King Irovetti</a> repainted figures for purchase as singles on paizo.com.</p> 
               <div class="blurb180">

               <h2>Beds, Beds, Beds!</h2> 
               <p>Lastly this week, when I saw the amazing dungeon dressing figures for this set come through approvals, I knew GMs would want more than the number of beds they were likely to get in their cases. As a result, we had WizKids create a special promotional version of the bed figure with a blue bedspread (rather than the standard red). These promo beds were produced in very limited quantities. Once they're gone, they're gone for good. <a href="/products/btpy9iyi">You can get as many as you'd like (for now) here.</a></p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week. I'm quite pleased with the few boosters of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> I've opened so far, and look forward to diving into the rest of my personal case this weekend! I hope to be back next week with some news to reveal. The next set is even better than this one!</p> 
               <p>See you then!</p>

Those games got filmed, and over the coming weeks we’re going to be making the full footage available for folks who want to see some of their favorite authors kick ass as heroes (and goblins!).

Even if you don't work on costumes yourself, I think we can all appreciate the level of detail that goes into making these works of art.

               <p>So what does the New Year bring? Last week, John looked back on Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild in 2015 and some of his plans for 2016. John focused on the development side, and there’s more on the organizational front. So here we go!</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/tags/genCon">Gencon</a>! <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>! PAX Prime! The turn of the year brings us back to convention season, and with it comes a need for GM and Headquarter volunteers. I got my start in PFS coordination by organizing a convention. Working a convention brings fantastic opportunities to meet people and see the hidden side of Pathfinder Society. So, watch this space for my call to arms, er, pens, as I will post a separate blog soon with the details! Also on the convention front, I’m working on a Convention Organizer Handbook aimed at giving new organizers the basics and providing tips and tricks for the experienced planner. If you have ideas for inclusion, email them to me! I would love this to be a group effort.</p>

               <p>The <a href="/pfsacg">Adventure Card Guild</a> returns to its roots with Season of the Runelords. While I’ll leave it to Tanis to give the details, we are delving back in with our favorite NPCs like Ameiko and villains like Karzoug. I loved running the Adventure Path for my home crew in England and look forward to seeing it translated into the Card Game. Look for me at the ACG tables at a convention near you!</p> 
               <p>Which brings up another point—travel! I’m still finalizing my travel schedule, but have a few locked and loaded! I’m hoping to get to a variety of locales this year to include Minnesota, Edmonton, Birmingham (UK), Quad Cities, Fort Wayne, San Francisco! As plans solidify, I will post more details here on the Paizo blog. In any case, please come introduce yourself—I love to meet fellow Pathfinders!</p> 
               <p>Just before the holidays, I announced a Pathfinder Society competition. You still have time to get your entries in before the January 11 deadline. If you missed the original post, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5libk">here it is</a>!</p> 
               <p>One new big project for 2016 is the launch of Pathfinder Society Academy. It is Pathfinder Society for our younger players, with new Kid’s Track lessons, youth-friendly tables, a Young GM mentor program, and other youth-focused initiatives. Up to now, we only offered Kid’s Track at Gen Con. The Academy allows us to offer Kid’s Track to convention organizers worldwide, as well as support youth gaming. Here’s to a new generation of gamers!</p> 
               <p>Thank you, Pathfinders, for making 2015 a fantastic year. Here’s to an even better 2016!</p> 
               <p>Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>
