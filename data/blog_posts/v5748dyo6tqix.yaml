  \ Art by Luca Sotgiu.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p><em>The elements have\
  \ a life of their own. I have always believed that birds embody these elements particularly\
  \ well—phoenixes, thunderbirds, and tidehawks to name a few—but each of these creatures\
  \ is so different from one another. They make their homes in different habitats\
  \ and approach life with such different philosophies that they rarely meet without\
  \ clashing.</em></p>\n      <p><em>My question, dear reader, has always been about\
  \ the connection between these birds. Most sources say there is no doubt the three\
  \ creatures have a common ancestor. What could that creature be? And does it still\
  \ live?</em></p>\n      <p><em>I needed to trace the birds back to their commonalities\
  \ for an answer. The Zoetrope could not take us back in time, but my studies could,\
  \ and I soon found several similarities within a handful of creation myths. In ages\
  \ past, the world was said to be in an everlasting tempest. Volcanoes spat fire\
  \ into the sky, lightning jumped between clouds of ash, and sharp ice fragments\
  \ whipped through the wind. It was the storm from which all other storms were born.\
  \ How fitting would this primordial tempest be as the birthplace of the species\
  \ of elemental bird from which the others evolved?</em></p>\n      <p><em>I searched\
  \ volcanoes for the creatures known as chaos falcons, waiting for a violent eruption\
  \ to give me a glimpse into the world of the past. It was in the Kullan Dei mountains\
  \ that I at last found it.</em></p>\n      <p>This journal entry was written for\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em> by Caryn DiMarco.</p>\n      <p>How odd,\
  \ it seems Baranthet also included some notes about the chaos falcon’s “abilities.”\
  </p>\n      <h4><u>CHAOS FALCON — CREATURE 10</u></h4>\n      <p><b>Dive-bomb</b>\
  \ [two-actions] (earth, fire, primal) <b>Requirements</b> The chaos falcon is Flying;\
  \ <b>Effect</b> The chaos falcon Flies twice straight down. If they reach the ground\
  \ or a similarly solid object at the end of this movement, their landing shatters\
  \ that surface into sharp shards, and droplets of molten stone deal 4d6 fire and\
  \ 3d8 piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) to all other creatures within 20\
  \ feet.<br></p>\n      <p><b>Storm Bolt</b> The chaos falcon's bolt Strike always\

  \      </div>\n      <p><em>During our journey, we were lucky to stumble into the\
  \ Monkeros Sanctuary, a hidden forest doubling as both a nature reserve and home\
  \ for a small herd of unicorns. Of course, I will not share its location—indeed,\
  \ publicizing the location of any unicorn poses a terrible danger to them. With\
  \ that in mind, many who support the sanctuary do so without ever seeing the unicorns\
  \ they protect. A rare few academic visitors are allowed along with a handful of\
  \ mercenaries, both vetted through the churches associated with Monkeros and further\
  \ by the unicorns themselves.</em></p>\n      <p><em>Although unicorns have the\
  \ capacity for speech far surpassing my own eloquence, their nervousness around\
  \ outsiders makes direct interviews difficult. It was only by enlisting the aid\
  \ of ten-year-old Theom, the son of a visiting scholar, that I was able to establish\
  \ something of a dialogue with the most outgoing of the unicorns. Theom knew the\
  \ unicorn as “Periwinkle,” which she seemed happy to accept—much like our own Ten\
  \ has adopted their moniker. Even in the oldest stories and tales, the true name\
  \ of a unicorn is always missing. It seems too much of a coincidence that this detail\
  \ is so persistently lacking; I’m left to believe that unicorns must have a very\
  \ good reason to protect the secrecy of their true name.</em></p>\n      <p>This\
  \ journal entry was written for <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em> by Jessie “\
  Aki” Lo.</p>\n      <p>Another note—perhaps Baranthet has found a system of denoting\
  \ abilities across the wide variety of Golarion’s wildlife... Apparently, unicorns\
  \ comprise not just the eponymous species, but many others as well, such as the\
  \ flying alicorn.</p>\n      <h4><u>ALICORN — CREATURE 15</u></h4>\n      <p><b>Draw\
  \ in Magic</b> [reaction] (arcane, concentrate) <b>Trigger</b> A creature within\
  \ 30 feet of the alicorn Casts a Spell; <b>Effect</b> The alicorn attempts to counteract\
  \ the triggering spell (counteract modifier +28, counteract rank 8th). If successful,\
  \ the alicorn can choose to gain the effects of the triggering spell as its sole\
  \ target.</p>\n      <p></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
