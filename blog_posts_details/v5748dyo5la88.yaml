  artist: "sharing what passes for a casual gaming collection around here: the Paizo\
    \ bookshelf. This bulky display holds a staggering array of RPGs, enough to bury\
    \ a grown man (or several small children). Ready to be thumbed through for inspiration,\
    \ relaxation, or pure nostalgic bliss, these dusty tomes are outdone only by the\
    \ complete volumes of Amazing Stories that march one after another across the\
    \ top like some sort of Hugonian crown. And if you didn't feel like reading, you\
    \ could always just play a game of Star Wars foosball! How anyone gets any work\
    \ done with this kind of distraction is a wonder... Hank Woon Editorial Intern"
