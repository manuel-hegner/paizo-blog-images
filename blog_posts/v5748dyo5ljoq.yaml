  >reveal of <em>Pathfinder RPG: Bestiary 6</em>'s fiendishly ferocious cover last\
  \ week</a>, the time is finally right to start looking INSIDE of this book... or\
  \ should I say the STARS are right? Because yes indeed we've got three more of Lovecraft's\
  \ Great Old Ones appearing in this book. In fact, one of the recurring themes you'll\
  \ notice right away (it's right there on the cover) is that we're including more\
  \ statistics for demigods in <a href=\"/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 6</em></a> than any other bestiary we've done. Now, obviously a stat\
  \ block for a creature of CR 26 to CR 30 in power isn't going to be useful for every\
  \ game, but that's not the only way to use a demigod in your game. These are foes\
  \ not only intended to be the end bosses for full-on mythic campaigns, but movers\
  \ and shakers for multiple campaigns. Demigods work best when they're NOT just stacks\
  \ of hit points for your players to deplete... but printing statistics for them\
  \ helps to quantify in a player's mind just how powerful they really are. In addition,\
  \ each demigod entry is fully supported with rules for how their worshipers function,\
  \ including information on cleric domains, subdomains, and favored weapons. We've\
  \ also added a new appendix to this bestiary at the very end that reprints several\
  \ domains and subdomains that have never before been printed in the RPG line, making\
  \ it easier than ever to play a character who wants to use powers from the Scalykind\
  \ domain or the Revelry subdomain, for example.</p> \n    <p>But enough about that.\
  \ The point of this blog (and the next several to come over the following weeks)\
  \ is to show off some art!</p> \n    <p>In <em>Bestiary 6</em>, we've got 4 categories\
  \ of demigod represented—archdevils, empyreal lords, Great Old Ones, and the Horsemen\
  \ of the Apocalypse. We've also got representation from the next tier down—so called\
  \ \"quasi deities\" like qlippoth lords or the verdant Green Man. I've chosen three\
  \ of these to illustrate below, focusing on new illustrations for each: the archdevil\
  \ Baalzebul, the aforementioned Green Man (of which there are multiples—some neutral,\
  \ some good, and some evil), and Tawil at'Umr.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Actually, that last one's a somewhat unusual case. As an avatar\
  \ of Yog-Sothoth, Tawil at'Umr has never really been quantified as a Great Old One\
  \ before, but the Lovecraft mythos are nothing if not mutable and accommodating.\
  \ And rather than invent a brand new category of demigod, I decided that this eldritch\
  \ master of time and space would work best in the Great Old One category. He (she?\
  \ they?) certainly fits into the category, rules-wise, with the ability to kill\
  \ you in your dreams only to immediately reincarnate you into a new body on another\
  \ world, or the power to hurl those who gaze upon its true form into their own permanent\
  \ microcosms. Tawil at'Umr was first introduced to the world in \"Through the Gates\
  \ of the Silver Key\" by H. P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffmann Price. In the story, the\
  \ entity is referred to as 'Umr at-Tawil, but in <em>Bestiary 6</em> I decided to\
  \ shift the name around a little to match Chaosium's preferred (and more grammatically\
  \ correct when one interprets the name as being inspired by the Arabic language)\
  \ version used in their <a href=\"/store/byCompany/c/chaosium/byProductType/roleplayingGames/callOfCthulhu\"\
  >Call of Cthulhu RPG</a>, but just like all of these mythos monstrosities, changes\
  \ to names or roles in world likely won't matter if your character decides to throw\
  \ down against them. Tawil at'Umr is probably the toughest monster in the book,\
  \ and in fact, might be the toughest monster we've ever statted up in a bestiary.\
  \ He's \"only\" CR 30, but as an avatar of Yog-Sothoth, killing it isn't gonna stop\
  \ it. From the Great Old One's Immortality entry in it's stat block:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>\"If Tawil at'Umr is killed, Yog-Sothoth can create a new avatar\
  \ immediately. The replacement Tawil at'Umr typically does not reappear where it\
  \ was killed, and it usually does not seek revenge against those who slew its predecessor.\
  \ Usually.\"</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p>\
