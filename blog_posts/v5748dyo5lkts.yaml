  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">While the kind of armor you wear, weapon you\
  \ wield, and spells you know can be important measures of your character's power,\
  \ your choice in skills is indicative of your character's depth. Is your character\
  \ good at feats of acrobatics? Can they recall knowledge with scholastic effortlessness?\
  \ Are they the sneakiest sneaker in the sneakerverse? Your skills may aid you in\
  \ the thick of a fight, but they also enhance your effect on the world when the\
  \ ringing of steel and the whizzing of spells subside.</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest deals with skills a bit differently than the first edition did. First\
  \ and foremost, we have cut down the skill list to 17 base skills (down from 35\
  \ base skills in Pathfinder First Edition). Now, I say \"base skills\" because the\
  \ Lore skill can be split into numerous different lores, but for many purposes,\
  \ like for this blog post, we can describe it as being a single skill.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Much of the reduction came from consolidation; for instance, we put the general\
  \ functions of Use Magic Device into each of the various knowledge skills that focus\
  \ on magical traditions, and we wrapped up a bunch of Strength-based skills into\
  \ a general Athletics skill. In most cases, we coupled the consolidation with being\
  \ a tad more generous in the number of skills you can be trained in (for instance,\
  \ the fighter has 3 + Intelligence modifier trained skills in the playtest rather\
  \ than 2 + Int in Pathfinder First Edition), making it easier to have a well-rounded\
  \ character.</p> \n    <p>So what exactly are these 17 skills? They (and their key\
  \ ability scores) are: Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Crafting\
  \ (Int), Deception (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidation (Cha), Lore (Int), Medicine\
  \ (Wis), Nature (Wis), Occultism (Int), Performance (Cha), Religion (Wis), Society\
  \ (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Thievery (Dex).</p> \n    <h2>Skill\
  \ Proficiency</h2> \n    <p>Like many things in the Pathfinder Playtest, skills\
  \ interact with the proficiency system. While a detailed description of the system\
  \ can be <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkm3?Are-You-Proficient\">found here</a>,\
  \ here's the nitty-gritty. Your character can be untrained, trained, an expert,\
  \ a master, or legendary in a skill. Being untrained grants you a modifier of your\
  \ level - 2, while being trained grants you a bonus equal to your level, expert\
  \ a bonus equal to your level + 1, master a bonus equal to your level + 2, and legendary\
  \ a bonus equal to your level + 3. Then, of course, you add your ability modifier\
  \ in the key ability for that skill, and apply any other bonuses or penalties. But\
  \ the new skill system is more than just the bonus you gain. Each level of proficiency\
  \ unlocks skill uses that are either intrinsic to the skill itself or that are uses\
  \ you select as your character advances.</p> \n    <h2>Skill Uses</h2> \n    <p>To\
  \ give you an idea of what this means, let's take a quick look at the Medicine skill.\
  \ Whether you are trained in Medicine or not, you can Administer First Aid.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[A]] Administer First\
  \ Aid</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Manipulate</b></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Requirements</b> You must have healer's tools.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is at 0 Hit Points\
  \ in an attempt to stabilize or revive it. You can also perform first aid on an\
  \ adjacent creature taking persistent bleed damage. The DC for either is 15. If\
  \ a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which one you're trying to end before\
  \ you roll. You can Administer First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"><b>Success</b> The creature at 0 Hit Points gains\
  \ 1 Hit Point, or you end the persistent bleed damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-2\"\
  ><b>Critical Failure</b> A creature with 0 Hit Points has its dying condition increased\
  \ by 1. A creature with persistent bleed damage takes damage equal to the amount\
  \ of its persistent bleed damage.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Basically, this\
  \ skill use allows anyone who has a healing kit to treat another creature who is\
  \ dying or suffering from bleed damage, which is super useful. Of course, being\
  \ untrained reduces your chances to save your friend and increases your chances\
  \ to hurt them accidentally, but it's worth trying in a pinch. If you are trained\
  \ in the skill, not only do your chances to help a friend by Administering First\
  \ Aid increase, but you also gain the ability to use the skill to Treat Disease\
  \ and Treat Poison, something that someone untrained in the skill cannot do.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Skill Feats</h2> \n    <p>These default uses are just the beginning.\
  \ As you increase in level, you periodically gain skill feats, usually at even-numbered\
  \ levels (unless you're a rogue—they gain skill feats every level instead). Skill\
  \ feats are a subsection of general feats, which means that any character can take\
  \ them as long as they meet the prerequisites. Moving forward with the example of\
  \ the Medicine skill, as long as you are at least trained in Medicine, you can take\
  \ the Battle Medic skill feat. This feat allows you to apply straight-up healing\
  \ to an ally through nonmagical means, which is nice when your cleric is knocked\
  \ to the ground or has run out of uses of channel energy.</p> \n    <p>For a higher-level\
  \ example, Robust Recovery is a Medicine skill feat you can take after becoming\
  \ an expert in that skill, and increases the bonus to saving throws against poison\
  \ and diseases when you treat creatures with those trained skill uses. When you\
  \ become legendary in Medicine, you can gain this skill feat:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Legendary Medic <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Feat 15</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>General, Skill</b></p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> legendary in Medicine</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You've invented new medical procedures or discovered\
  \ ancient techniques that can achieve nearly miraculous results. Once per day for\
  \ each target, you can spend 1 hour treating the target and attempt a Medicine check\
  \ to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, drained, or enervated condition.\
  \ Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition.\
  \ If the effect's source is an artifact, a creature above 20th level, or other similarly\
  \ powerful source, increase the DC by 5.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The more\
  \ powerful or useful the skill feat, the higher the proficiency required to take\
  \ it. Legendary Medic grants you the ability to perform amazing feats of healing\
  \ through skill and experience rather than magic, but you must gain that skill and\
  \ experience first. Of course, the Medicine skill is just the tip of the iceberg.\
  \ This structure is replicated with every skill, including nearly every rogue's\
  \ favorite—Stealth.</p> \n    <p>Stealth is a bit of an outlier in that all of its\
  \ initial uses can be attempted untrained, but training and later proficiency in\
  \ the skill yields some very subversive results. The Quiet Allies skill feat allows\
  \ you to use your expertise in Stealth to reduce those pesky armor check penalties\
  \ on allies' skill checks, while Swift Sneak allows a master in Stealth to move\
  \ at their full speed when they Sneak. Upon becoming legendary, you further enhance\
  \ your skill by no longer needing to specifically declare the sneaking exploration\
  \ tactic when you are in exploration mode, allowing you to sneak everywhere. You're\
  \ just that good.</p> \n    <p>But this is all just the start. Mark will take up\
  \ more aspects of what you can do with skill feats this Friday!</p> \n    <h2>Constant\
  \ Progress</h2> \n    <p>Like many aspects of the Pathfinder Playtest, the goal\
  \ of skills is not only to gain the greatest bonus, but also for you to expand outward\
  \ and create a unique character who uses skills the way you want them to be used.\
  \ Much like how ancestry feats allow you to choose the type of human, dwarf, elf,\
  \ or whatever you want to play, the proficiency and skill feat system will enable\
  \ you to determine what kind of knowledgeable, athletic, or sneaky character you\
  \ want to play. Over time, this system gives us the opportunity to add more skill\
  \ uses by way of skill feats, which will allow the game to become more dynamic as\
  \ we add options. This also allows you to continue to grow your skills in new and\
  \ surprising ways without us having to pull out the wires of the underlying skill,\
  \ which is something we are always loath to do. In this way, as the game progresses,\
  \ we can expand skill options in an open-ended way, without invalidating the gateway\
  \ mechanics.</p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Senior Designer</i></p>\
