  PTales\"></span></a> \n    <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">The Irregulars</h1> \n    <p>by\
  \ Neal F. Litherland</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: The Setup</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">They marched like human\
  \ cattle through the arid throat of the mountains. Men and women, old and young,\
  \ were all subsumed into a single, shuffling, iron-bound mass. They walked with\
  \ their heads down and bodies slack, broken through and through. Men wrapped in\
  \ leather and steel rode snorting horses and shepherded the herd like overzealous\
  \ hounds. Lashes snapped, the loud cracks of cruelty that made words unnecessary.\
  \ Dust rose from bare feet and shod hooves, and the hot wind reeked like the breath\
  \ of Hell welcoming new pilgrims. Just more meat for the grinder of Molthune's aspirations.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"There're more of them than when we saw them three days ago,\" Trilaina\
  \ whispered. The scout lay on a flat rock, a rumpled, no-color cloth thrown over\
  \ her and weighted down with sandy soil.</p> \n     <p>\"More slaves or more guards?\"\
  \ Chaplain asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Both,\" the half-elf replied, her lips barely\
  \ parted enough to speak. Chain shifted below, down in the shade where the cleric\
  \ was keeping out of sight.</p> \n     <p>\"Torag will provide,\" Chaplain said.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Trilaina resisted the urge to turn and glare at the dwarf. \"That's\
  \ what you always say.\" </p> \n     <p>The cleric shrugged her shoulders again.\
  \ \"The day that I'm wrong, child, you may feel free to say 'I told you so.'\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The herd came close enough that shouts and cries pulled apart and became\
  \ words. Trilaina saw faces over the groove of her crossbow, every one of them minted\
  \ with the hopelessness a forced march brought. An older woman, her strength finally\
  \ failing, fell over. She didn't move when the lash opened her cheek, but blood\
  \ ran fast enough to testify that she wasn't dead. Not yet, anyway.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Patience,\" Chaplain said, her words more of a prayer than a caution. \"Be calm,\
  \ and wait for the signal.\"</p> \n     <p>Trilaina's mouth opened to reply when\
  \ a howl rolled the across the valley. As one, the guards looked, goggling like\
  \ children scaring each other with campfire stories. A black she-wolf, silver in\
  \ her muzzle and fire in her eyes, appeared on an outcrop. She growled down at the\
  \ mass of men like a judgmental goddess, unafraid of their slings and arrows. One\
  \ of the caravan guards cranked his own crossbow, raised it up, and shouted something\
  \ to the others. The others laughed in reply. Trilaina couldn't hear what he said,\
  \ but they were his last words.</p> \n     <p>A loud twang snapped like a split\
  \ harp string, and a bolt skewered the would-be archer's head like a practice pumpkin.\
  \ He sat his saddle another moment, blood dribbling to the thirsty earth, before\
  \ falling like a sack full of meat. Trilaina took a breath, found her mark, and\
  \ squeezed. It wasn't until her bolt tore into another guard's guts, right through\
  \ the weak spot where his armor laced together up the side, that the others realized\
  \ they were under attack.</p> \n     <p>Swords cleared scabbards and arrows were\
  \ loosed into the rocks. Bottles smashed against the hills, and gouts of liquid\
  \ fire spumed up like dragon's breath. In response, more shafts fell from both sides\
  \ of the canyon, every one of them striking home. The imprisoned horde, scenting\
  \ that its captors were wounded, woke up. They attacked in ones and twos at first,\
  \ but then the floodgates opened full force. They pulled men off horses and snatched\
  \ weapons from hands and belts. The guards that went down screamed and didn’t rise\
  \ again. The horses, panicked by the potent combination of fear and rage in the\
  \ air, bolted. The remaining slavers, facing the ragged wraiths bent on vengeance,\
  \ followed the riderless mounts.</p> \n     <p>\"They're getting away,\" Trilaina\
  \ grunted. She snapped the reload lever and slipped another shaft along the groove.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Not for long,\" Chaplain observed. </p> \n     <p>No sooner had the\
  \ words been spoken than a thick rope leaped out of the soil and barred the way.\
  \ It caught the riders and sent them flailing and crashing to the dirt. Trilaina\
  \ sighted and squeezed carefully, catching the first to rise from the heap between\
  \ the shoulder blades. The others chose to stay down, bellies up like dogs.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You know, it's scary how you do that.\" Trilaina cocked the crossbow\
  \ again. Chaplain hefted her hammer and smiled. She always looked matronly when\
  \ she did that. Stern, but matronly.</p> \n     <p>\"When you've been around as\
  \ long as I have,\" the dwarf started.</p> \n     <p> \"Then I'm sure I'll recognize\
  \ the signs,\" Trilaina finished. She tried to brush some of the grit out of her\
  \ eyes—returning her hair to its previously golden hue was going to take nothing\
  \ short of a wish. She brought her weapon back into firing position. \"Let's just\
  \ get this over with, huh?\"</p> \n     <p>\"As you wish.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Trilaina.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n      <br> Trilaina has little sympathy for those who traffic in flesh\
  \ and misery.\n     </div> \n     <p>They clambered down the rocky slope, each watching\
  \ carefully while the other descended the rough patches. It wasn't pleasant, and\
  \ if anyone with ill intent had been paying them the slightest mind, they could\
  \ have turned both women into pincushions. But no one was watching, and soon enough\
  \ their boots were back on level ground. They took a single moment to sweep the\
  \ area, then headed for the far end of the battlefield, where an interesting little\
  \ group had gathered.</p> \n     <p>Four former guards sat on the ground, rusty\
  \ irons around their wrists. It was amazing the difference that only a few moments\
  \ made in their bearing. The wolf—Denna—stood to the left with her head down and\
  \ her hackles up. Gunner sat on the wolf's back, holding the infernal collection\
  \ of gears, levers, and bow strings that made up his bizarre heavy crossbow. If\
  \ not for his eyes—the same verdant green as his hair and mustache—the gnome could\
  \ have been a statue in woodsman's clothes. On the right, glaring over his crooked\
  \ nose, stood Garm. The half-orc breathed easy, stripped to the waist, muscles like\
  \ steel cables flexing under his charcoal skin. Between the two of them, facing\
  \ the little crowd of captives, stood the Lieutenant.</p> \n     <p>Even in a motley\
  \ crew like this, Lieutenant Sturgeon Hook was impossible to miss. An old buzzard\
  \ of a man, Hook seemed to have been named for the prominent nose that jutted out\
  \ like a beak over his pointed chin and wispy beard. What hair he had left was white,\
  \ and his skin was the ratty testament of a violent vagabond who'd weathered a storm\
  \ of swords in his day. Of all the team members, he was the only one who wore a\
  \ proper uniform—the faded and dust-stained blue coat of an officer in the Andoren\
  \ army—yet the real proof of his rank lay in his bearing. He glanced up at the last\
  \ two members of his unit, then went back to studying the prisoners.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Looks like you caught something, Garm,\" Trilaina called. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ half-orc nodded, his expression thoughtful. \"Trying to decide which one to keep,\"\
  \ he finally said in his sonorous baritone.</p> \n     <p>\"I'd throw em back,\"\
  \ Gunner grunted, gesturing with the business end of his miniature ballista. \"\
  Watch ’em try to swim.\"</p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant ignored the banter and leaned\
  \ towards the man in the center. The captive wore no armor, but was swathed in desert\
  \ robes that had probably been fine some time ago. His mustache was ridiculous,\
  \ his boots were ostentatious, and his fat fingers each bore a multifaceted gemstone\
  \ set in heavy gold. The Lieutenant smiled, and the man on the ground shuddered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Harlon Robbes,\" the Lieutenant croaked, the smile transforming into\
  \ a sneer. \"A more aptly named rut-smear there never was. Where were you planning\
  \ on going with so many unwilling passengers, Robbes?\"</p> \n     <p>\"The South\
  \ Menador Mine,\" the slaver said. Frightened as he was, his voice was still as\
  \ smooth as oiled clockwork. \"They have an iron quota to fill, and they aren't\
  \ shy about how they wrest the ore from the mountain.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And since\
  \ you're a patriot, you venture forth to recruit the best and the brightest to clap\
  \ in irons,\" the Lieutenant said. The slaver shrugged, a single, spasmodic jerk.\
  \ \"When are they expecting you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Shortly,\" Robbes replied, licking\
  \ sweat from his cracked lips. \"I was told to expect an escort by noon tomorrow.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Ah,\" the Lieutenant said, as if that single fact explained everything.\
  \ One of the men moved, and Denna lifted her lips. The sharp, white fangs made him\
  \ decide that whatever itch he had could wait a little while longer.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"What do you think, boss?\" Trilaina glanced over at the newly freed slaves.\
  \ The mob looked back, a herd of sheep that had stampeded the wolves, but which\
  \ still wasn't quite sure what to do.</p> \n     <p>\"I think the best cure for\
  \ a blight like this is a taste of its own medicine.\" The Lieutenant stepped back\
  \ and nodded to Garm. The half-orc grabbed the manacle chain and lifted the nearest\
  \ guard like a child caught misbehaving, and marched him toward the eager crowd.\
  \ Chaplain grabbed a second, and Gunner gestured at a third. Before the third man\
  \ could rise though, Robbes snatched the man's belt, hauled them both to their feet,\
  \ and ran.</p> \n     <p>The other captives all tried their own runs for the sun.\
  \ The first man struggled, wrenching his wrists and trying to throw Garm over his\
  \ hip. The guard was big and broad-shouldered, but it wasn't enough. Garm smashed\
  \ an elbow into the side of the slaver’s head with a hollow crunch, and the man\
  \ went down like a slaughterhouse bull. The second guard pulled, and Chaplain let\
  \ go. Before the prisoner could enjoy his freedom, Chaplain rung his bell with the\
  \ side of her hammer, and he sprawled out flat. The third man made it four steps\
  \ before something wet and sticky exploded against his back like a resinous pustule.\
  \ He tripped over his own feet as the alchemical bag turned him into another graceless\
  \ lump on the valley floor. Trilaina snickered, always happy to use one of her favorite\
  \ toys.</p> \n     <p>Robbes hadn't relied on his own legs in some time, and it\
  \ showed. Galvanized by fear, however, and with the chill of the grave on the back\
  \ of his neck, he ran fast enough. The Lieutenant swore as he snatched a vial from\
  \ his belt and hurled. The explosion of the bomb sent up a spray of rocks and dirt\
  \ that sent the man stumbling. Gunner sighted and fired, his hands just one more\
  \ part of the complex weapon. The bolt screamed, a steel-tipped falcon that slashed\
  \ along the heavy, meaty expanse of the lead flesh-merchant’s shoulder. He yelped\
  \ like a stuck pig and ducked, running even faster. A horse whinnied, and by the\
  \ time the dust had cleared both horse and the rider were dark smudges far down\
  \ the canyon.</p> \n     <p>\"I told you to miss him,\" The Lieutenant said. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Gunner shrugged and reloaded. \"He'll run faster if he's winged.\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Hook blew out a long breath and shook his head. \"We don't want him\
  \ running too fast.\"</p> \n     <p>Gunner straightened in the saddle. \"Sir.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Lieutenant Hook nodded and looked around at his team. They all\
  \ nodded back.</p> \n     <p>\"Anyone hurt?\" he asked. They all shook their heads.\
  \ \"Good. Fine work, everyone. Consider this a step toward the final goal.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Lieutenant knelt down, wincing, and snatched a heavy, rusted key\
  \ off a dead guard's belt. He tossed it to Garm, and Trilaina took a nearly identical\
  \ key off a second's man's belt. The Lieutenant nodded and rubbed at his bad knee.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"All right, let's get to work. Gunner, round up the horses and butcher\
  \ them—these people are going to need some proper meat once they're not carrying\
  \ around half a measure of iron each. Chaplain, soothe them as well as you can.\
  \ There's quite a bit of day left to burn, and we've got to make these people disappear.\
  \ The sooner we get that chore done, the sooner we get to go and play king of the\
  \ mountain. Hop to!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Swift justice to agents\
