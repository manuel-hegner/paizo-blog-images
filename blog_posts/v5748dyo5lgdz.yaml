  date\">Saturday, August 9, 2014</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Greetings,\
  \ Pathfinders.</p> \n    <p>We hope you're excited for the launch of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guildâ€”we certainly are!</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Unfortunately, we've had some very bad news this week from our card\
  \ printer. They had a problem with one of their presses, and many of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\">Class Decks</a> they printed had to be\
  \ destroyed. As a result, the retail release date for the Class Decks is moving\
  \ from August 14 to September 3, and we won't be able to ship paizo.com preorders\
  \ until shortly before that. And because you must have a Class Deck to participate\
  \ in the Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild, that means that retailers won't\
  \ be able to launch the program until September 3.</span></p> \n    <p>The good\
  \ news is that this won't stop us from launching the Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> next\
  \ week. Our friends at <a href=\"https://www.drivethrucards.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >DriveThru Cards</a> are rushing to print versions of the Class Decks that we can\
  \ use in the Adventure Card Guild room, and we'll be providing printed character\
  \ sheets for the characters you choose so you can register your character on Paizo.com\
  \ and keep track of your rewards and deck upgrades as normal.</p> \n    <p>Our printer\
  \ is also working to deliver some finished decks to Gen Con, though they may not\
  \ arrive until later in the show. We promised a free Class Deck to any player who\
  \ purchased 4 or more Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild events, and we will\
  \ make those available for pickup in the PFSACG room as soon as they arrive. (And\
  \ if the official decks arrive too late for someone to pick up, we will take that\
  \ person's name and address and ship the chosen Class Deck as soon as copies arrive\
  \ in our warehouse.).</p> \n    <p>We're very sorry about this situation, but we\
  \ are committed to delivering the full amount of fun that everyone expected to have,\
  \ albeit not on our desired schedule.</p> \n    <p>We still expect to have the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy92zj\">Skull and Shackles Base Set</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy92zk\"\
  >Character Add-On Decks</a> to be available for purchase in the dealer hall, as\
  \ well as all the available play mats and card sleeves from our partners at Ultra\
  \ PRO.</p> \n    <p>Please use the thread below to ask any questions you need answered.</p>\
