  \ James L. Sutter (Part 2)</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 19, 2009</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Here follows Part 2 of my interview with Editor James L. Sutter, in which\
  \ he discusses his influences for Golarion's solar system, monster ecologies, and\
  \ the island nation of Hermea.</p> \n    <p><b>James</b>: For <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy85ed\"\
  >Golarion's solar system</a>, I wanted to include elements of real science, because\
  \ there are so many phenomena in different scientific fields, such as astronomy,\
  \ that are already so bizarre as to seem magical. Erik and his love of the pulps\
  \ made it a given that we'd include classic versions of the Red and Green Planets\
  \ as homages to sword &amp; planet fantasy, but for the rest of the solar system\
  \ I was given more or less free reign to introduce more science fiction elements.\
  \ My goal was to create a wide enough variety of worlds that you could have wildly\
  \ differing SF-feeling settings without ever leaving Golarion's system. Some of\
  \ them were inspired primarily by setting concepts (Liches in space suits? Try Eox.\
  \ Lovecraft-esque planet of mystery? Aucturn, baby!), but others came straight out\
  \ of Astronomy 101—what kind of society would evolve on a planet that's tidally\
  \ locked (meaning one side always faces the sun), or one that's tidally heated?\
  \ What about a planet with an eccentric orbit—could an ecology or society grow up\
  \ around seasons that last not months, but years? For me, the conditions that create\
  \ a crazy setting are often as interesting as the setting itself.</p> \n    <p>Similarly,\
  \ when writing monster ecologies, I like to figure out how a monster could have\
  \ evolved into its ecological niche in a realistic fashion. The explanation that\
  \ \"this monster was created by a wizard's experiment gone wrong\" is fine for classics\
  \ like the bulette, but it's been done way too often. When writing the entries for\
  \ lizardfolk in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy82r5\"><i>Classic Monsters Revisited</i></a>\
  \ and the rust monster in <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy87v1\"\
  ><i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i></a>, for instance, I tried to make their ecologies\
  \ as plausible as possible. There are good reasons why rust monsters don't <i>actually</i>\
  \ exist, of course, and I'm not averse to a little magic here and there, but it's\
  \ easy to let magic be a crutch if you're not careful. (I should also stress that\
  \ I'm not a scientist, by any means—I just know a lot of them, and enjoy listening\
  \ to them explain how my proposed ecologies butcher biological and physical laws.)</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Another big influence for me is the concept of moral ambiguity—to me,\
  \ the best villains are always the ones who passionately believe they're doing the\
  \ right thing. The island nation of Hermea, for instance, was born out of my desire\
  \ to see how a fantasy society would tackle the dicey question of eugenics. One\
  \ of my roommates is a geneticist, and eugenics is a real topic of concern for him.\
  \ It seems like every week or so we end up in complicated debates and thought experiments\
  \ with friends about the morality and wisdom of actively seeking to \"improve\"\
  \ humanity through science. It's an extremely touchy subject, because the word \"\
  eugenics\" reminds a lot of people of the atrocities of the Holocaust, in which\
  \ the concept was thinly draped over hatred and genocide. Yet at its base definition,\
  \ eugenics is happening every day in commonplace medical practices like amniocentesis.\
  \ So where are the lines drawn?</p> \n    <p>The question of whether or not eugenics\
  \ can be used for the greater good became the core concept behind Hermea, and led\
  \ to some heated inter-office debates and jokes (at some point in the campaign setting\
  \ outline, someone penciled it in as \"Codename: Dragon Hitler\"). But in the end,\
  \ the idea saw light: in Hermea, a nominally good gold dragon, in all of its wisdom,\
  \ is trying to guide humanity to perfection by selectively breeding the best and\
  \ brightest volunteers for their desirable traits. Whether or not this goes against\
  \ his alignment is up to each individual GM to decide. Personally, I believe that\
  \ eugenics happens every day, as we continue to wipe out diseases and detect genetic\
  \ disorders early on. Evolution and natural selection didn't stop with the rise\
  \ of civilization; the only difference is that we're now beginning to put ourselves\
  \ in the driver's seat. It's an exciting time to be a human.</p> \n    <p>All in\
  \ all, my inspiration comes from a little bit of fantasy, a lot of science fiction,\
  \ and a <i>lot</i> of hard science.</p> \n    <br> \n    <p>Thanks for reading,\
  \ Paizonians! Stay tuned for more of Paizo's Appendix N in the near future!</p>\
