  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">At the onset\
  \ of Season 5, the means by which characters earned Prestige Points changed dramatically.\
  \ No longer was fame tied to performing faction missions, but rather its award would\
  \ be tied to secondary success conditions—\"secret\" missions that were tied to\
  \ going above and beyond the primary success condition or seeking out additional,\
  \ perhaps unforeseen ways to further the goals of the Pathfinder Society. As part\
  \ of this change, we retired the existing model of faction missions, but the earlier\
  \ scenarios did not have any secondary success conditions established already as\
  \ replacements.</span></p> \n    <p>I'm pleased to announce that we will have the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy928k?\">Secondary Success Conditions</a>—all 126 of them—\
  available for download. After considering how best to distribute these, we decided\
  \ it would be best to make the entire file available for download instead of adding\
  \ an extra file to each download. I recognize that this makes it easier for the\
  \ unscrupulous to peek at the secondary missions, but it also makes it far less\
  \ onerous for GMs to acquire the updates all at once. I'm trusting the community\
  \ to use this resource responsibly</p> \n    <p>These will become available tomorrow,\
  \ so this means that the <a href=\"/threads/rzs2q1gy\">the temporary fix issued\
  \ in August</a> will no longer be in effect. Any games started on or after October\
  \ 1, 2013 must use these secondary missions.</p> \n    <p>No doubt some of you are\
  \ curious as to what these look like but don't want to spoil any scenarios by peeking\
  \ at the reference document. To provide some examples, I shall recreate here the\
  \ entries for three scenarios that do not exist.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>#3–\
  14159: Death by Pie</b><br> <i>Primary:</i> The PCs recover at least three pastries\
  \ and return them to Venture-Captain Sheila Heidmarch.<br> <i>Secondary:</i> The\
  \ PCs use the cipher found in area B3 to learn the next five digits in the sequence:\
  \ 2–[blueberry]–5–[rhubarb]–5, thus giving the society advance warning of a major\
  \ attack on the Grand Lodge.</p> \n     <p><b>#5–513: The Doppelganger's Prey</b><br>\
  \ <i>Primary:</i> The PCs defeat the doppelganger.<br> <i>Secondary:</i> The PCs\
  \ accidentally slay no more than one of the following during the course of the adventure:\
  \ Sheila Heidmarch, Drandle Dreng, or Ambrus Valsi.</p> \n     <p><b>#4–117: All\
  \ the Doors are Trapped</b><br> <i>Primary:</i> The PCs successfully escape the\
  \ dungeon.<br> <i>Secondary:</i> The PCs trigger and are damaged by no more than\
  \ two of the traps in the scenario.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>My thanks to\
  \ those campaign volunteers who helped out in reviewing my drafts and suggesting\
  \ lots of possible secondary missions.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
