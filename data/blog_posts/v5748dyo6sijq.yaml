  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The next morning\
  \ dawned bright and clear, no trace of the previous day’s storm left on the horizon.\
  \ Dr. Pom joined me on the research deck for our customary morning tea, sipping\
  \ in companionable silence until we’d finished our first cup and were contemplating\
  \ our second.</p>\n      <p>“How are you feeling, Baranthet?” she asked kindly as\
  \ she held out her cup for a refill. “That was an intense day of travel yesterday.”\
  </p>\n      <p>“Quite well, thank you,” I said as I poured, reveling in the wisps\
  \ of aromatic steam rising from our mugs. “How are you? Are you used to storms like\
  \ that where you’re from?”</p>\n      <p>She took a moment to consider this, her\
  \ eyes following the gulls soaring over the cliffs. “We did have some mighty storms,\
  \ yes, but it’s different now,” she said thoughtfully. “The instinct to seek shelter\
  \ is the same, of course, but there’s... a deeper appreciation, I suppose. A sense\
  \ of thinking about the past and the future, whereas before there was only the present\
  \ moment. I find joy in their beauty and feel appreciation for the sheer primal\
  \ power of the skies. Though,” she said with a laugh, “I never expected to be <em>flying</em>\
  \ in those skies in the middle of one!”</p>\n      <p>“Neither did I,” I admitted,\
  \ grinning. “A humbling and awe-inspiring experience, to be sure!”</p>\n      <p>We\
  \ sat in comfortable silence for a while as the others drifted in for breakfast\
  \ or set about their tasks for the day. I wondered idly where my <em>Spiridendra</em>\
  \ book had gone and what we might find next in our journey as I watched Telero and\
  \ Ten examine one of the ship’s wings—they’d been busy checking and recalibrating\
  \ this and that after the flight through the storm the day before. For my part,\
  \ it was nice to have a slower morning before returning to the expedition.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“It’s wild, isn’t it,” Dr. Pom said softly, “looking back on the changes\
  \ you’ve weathered in your life?” Her eyes met mine, and though we were close in\
  \ years, I sensed she wasn’t talking merely about aging.</p>\n      <p>“I certainly\
  \ never thought I’d go from ink-stained librarian to bold explorer,” I said fervently,\
  \ and she chuckled, her small spectacles slipping down her striped snout. “When\
  \ you awakened, did you ever plan on having such adventures?”</p>\n      <p>“It\
  \ was hard to make plans at all, at first.” She adjusted her glasses and looked\
  \ back out over the cliffs. “Awakening is... a turbulent time, for most. There’\
  s a lot of information to process all at once, and many of us are overwhelmed by\
  \ the concept of a vaster and more specific future than what we’d previously had\
  \ the capacity to consider. But I always felt called to be a healer,” she added,\
  \ and smiled again. “I know what it’s like to be hurt, and afraid. It gladdens me\
  \ to provide comfort and support where I can.”</p>\n      <p>I reflected on this\
  \ as I watched Telero hoist Ten higher up the wing, where they began to hammer at\
  \ one of its joints. Suddenly, tension released in an explosive pop, the wing springing\
  \ back into place… and catapulting our mechanic overboard, falling past Telero’\
  s arms to land with a thud and a yelp in the water below.</p>\n      <p>“Goodness,\
  \ not again!” Dr. Pom and I were on our feet at once, tea abandoned. Grefu surfaced\
  \ in the waves near our mechanic (no doubt he was enjoying his morning constitutional),\
  \ and swam Ten over to the research deck, hoisting them aboard. Their eyes blinked\
  \ rapidly at us as we gathered around.</p>\n      <p>Dr. Pom knelt next to them,\
  \ illuminating the lamp at her shoulder and setting her bag down as she looked them\
  \ over.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/790ae6c8-b1a8-4310-8ad9-1b811dc6b14e/PZO2114_DrPomPhotograph_1200.png\"\

  \    <p>“It’s my fault, Professor,” Telero said in anguish. “I tried to catch them—\
  ”</p>\n      <p>“It is not his fault; the wing was badly jammed from the storm;\
  \ it was more badly misaligned than I thought,” Ten chirped in their customary staccato\
  \ tone, their eyes glittering as Dr. Pom shone her light in one and then the other.\
  \ “Do not fret; I feel fine; and that should be the last of the repairs!”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“I keep telling you to use your safety lines when you’re doing repairs,”\
  \ said Dr. Pom, ignoring this tale of triumph as she peered into her patient’s eyes.\
  \ “You seem coherent, but I’d like to confirm, please. What’s your name?”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Whose Antenna Is Askew,” they replied promptly, wiggling the appendage\
  \ in question. “You know me; I am the ship’s mechanic; you’ve patched me up many\
  \ times before.”</p>\n      <p>Dr. Pom smiled wryly and looked up at me. “They’\
  re all right.” She rummaged about in her belt, retrieving a slip of paper and weighing\
  \ several powders and herbs onto it. “Take this before you tuck in tonight. It should\
  \ help your carapace mend.”</p>\n      <p>An aggrieved Telero relaxed slightly next\
  \ to me as Ten withdrew the frayed checkered cloth that was always at their toolbelt\
  \ and dried their face. “Telero; now the repairs are done; do you want to check\
  \ the cliffs for geodes?” they said, pointing at the shore.</p>\n      <p>Dr. Pom\
  \ and I left the young friends to their explorations as they boarded the airskiff\
  \ for shore, but I checked in on our mechanic later that evening. They were in the\
  \ engine room, as usual, cleaning various gears and leaning close to the engine\
  \ to listen to its steady hum.</p>\n      <p>I knocked on the doorframe. “Doing\
  \ all right, Ten?”</p>\n      <p>They jumped and dropped what appeared to be an\
  \ armful of wrenches, the tools clanging on the floor and narrowly missing their\
  \ feet. “So sorry; you surprised me; please come in; hello.”</p>\n      <p>“Oh!\
  \ The fault is mine,” I said, crouching down to help them collect everything. “\
  You’re still feeling well?”</p>\n      <p>Ten nodded. “My carapace is very tough;\
  \ it’s held up through worse falls; I am fine; thank you.”</p>\n      <p>I smiled\
  \ at their earnest assurances. “I’m glad to hear it! And the <em>Zoetrope</em>?\
  \ Everything running smoothly?”</p>\n      <p>“Running like a dream,” Ten said,\
  \ casting their expert eye over the complex machinery that made our expedition possible.\
  \ “The good kind of dream; the ones with friends; and cookies; and adventures. Like\
  \ what we have.”</p>\n      <p>How had I been so fortunate as to find such bright,\
  \ kind, brave, and talented companions? “Like what we have,” I agreed, handing over\
  \ the last of the wrenches. “A dream come—”</p>\n      <p>“Come quick!” a voice\
  \ yelled from above. “One of the specimens has escaped from the menagerie!”</p>\n\

  \       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n      <br>\n      <p>Hi everyone! James\
  \ here again to talk about the last two ancestries featured in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>.\
  \ We’ve saved the awakened animal and surki for last, as they’re quite different\
  \ from the ancestries we’ve put out so far! Each uses its heritage in a pretty different\
  \ way than any ancestries we’ve published previously, so we’ll be previewing those\
  \ here instead of some feats.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;The awakened animal freely chooses\
  \ their size (from Tiny to Large) as a part of character creation, which also determines\
  \ their starting Hit Points. Afterward, they choose a heritage that represents their\
  \ general body plan. Your heritage will usually give you some suggestions for an\
  \ unarmed attack that replaces the fist attack that most ancestries get, but given\
  \ how broad the animal world is—some aquatic animals have wing attacks, after all—\
  these are treated as suggestions to work out with your GM rather than as hard restrictions.\
  \ The climbing animal heritage showcased below is great for a bipedal animal, like\
  \ Dr. Pom.</p>\n      <h3>Climbing Animal Heritage</h3>\n      <p>You are an animal\
  \ whose limbs are adapted to grab, climb, and brachiate. You might be dexterous\
  \ and ready to use tools like a chimpanzee or otter, or you may simply be a quick\
  \ climber like a bear, raccoon, or sloth.</p>\n      <p>You have a land Speed of\
  \ 20 feet, a climb Speed of 20 feet, and one animal attack of your choice (typically\
  \ claw, fist, or jaws; see the animal attacks sidebar).&gt;[?</p>\n      <p>Surkis\
  \ also approach heritages in an unusual way. Surkis absorb magic as larva and young\
  \ adults, which accumulates in nodes throughout their bodies. All surkis freely\
  \ choose a tradition of magic at character creation that represents the type of\
  \ magic they most consumed as a larva, which affects the tradition of their magical\
  \ abilities (plus a few others). Then, they also choose a heritage. A surki can\
  \ then, later in life, undergo metamorphosis to develop these nodes into unique\
  \ magic-projecting organs. Each surki heritage has a base ability as well as two\
  \ possible directions they can evolve the ability later by taking feats such as\
  \ the 9th-level Grand Metamorphosis. Surkis can even gain multiple heritages or\
  \ change their heritage late in life with various feats as well! We can take a look\
  \ at this with the light-emitting lantern surki heritage below:</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>Lantern Surki</h3>\n      <p>The nodes in your abdomen are particularly\
  \ luminous. You can use an Interact action to shed light from your abdomen in a\
  \ 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). This is a magical light effect\
  \ with a level equal to your own. You can change the color of the light or extinguish\
  \ it with another Interact action.</p>\n      <p><b>Evolution</b> Your abdominal\
  \ nodes have evolved into a pair of secondary limbs that project a magical focusing\
  \ lens. You gain the Lantern Beam action.<br><b>Lantern Beam</b> [one-action] (light,\
  \ fire, magical) <b>Requirements</b> Your lantern light is shining; <b>Effect</b>\
  \ Your lenses focus your light into a searing beam. You deal 5d4 fire damage to\
  \ all creatures in a 30-foot line, with a basic saving throw against the higher\
  \ of your class DC or spell DC. Your lantern light then extinguishes, and you can’\
  t use this ability or use your lantern light again for 1d4 rounds. At 11th level\
  \ and every two levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.</p>\n      <p><b>Evolution</b>\
  \ Secondary light emitters grow from your shoulder nodes that flash in time with\
  \ your lantern. You gain the Lantern Strobe action.<br><b>Lantern Strobe</b> [two-actions]\
  \ (light, magical, visual) <b>Frequency</b> once per hour; <b>Effect</b> As you\
  \ pulse your lantern, your emitters flash erratically, disorienting your opponents\
  \ that see it. Each opponent in a 15-foot cone must attempt a Fortitude save against\
  \ your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a failure, the creature is\
  \ dazzled for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round\
  \ and dazzled for the following round.</p>\n      <p>“But wait,” you might be asking.\
  \ “My explosive surki sorceress, Blastrellina, isn’t just a surki; she’s also a\
  \ nephilim because she fed upon the lingering unholy magic of the Worldwound! How\
  \ will these ancestries interact with versatile heritages?” We know that versatile\
  \ heritages are very popular, and so if you want to take one with either an awakened\
  \ animal or a surki, you can! In this case, you still select a heritage purely to\
  \ define your character’s story and cosmetic appearance, and you gain some basic\
  \ benefits but not their specialized heritage abilities. However, you can take either\
  \ the Late Awakener or Secondary Adaptation feat later to gain these benefits.</p>\n\
