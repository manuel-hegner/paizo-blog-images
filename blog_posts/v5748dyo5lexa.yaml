  \ night at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet, we announced the release of our next Pathfinder\
  \ Battles prepainted miniatures set, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>!\
  \ This 55-figure set is scheduled for an October 2013 release. It features monsters\
  \ and characters inspired by the Pathfinder Campaign Setting and Pathfinder releases\
  \ going back to the very beginning. Long-time Pathfinder fans will discover miniatures\
  \ of old friends from classic Adventure Paths and Pathfinder Modules, while gamers\
  \ new to Pathfinder will discover a set packed with high-use creatures like orcs,\
  \ kobolds, and awesome monsters from the Pathfinder Bestiaries.</span></p> \n  \
  \  <p>Today I'd like to show off a few figures from the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> set. You'll learn a lot more about the set in the coming\
  \ months as we march our way toward its release, but we wanted to give you an early\
  \ look at a few of the set's coolest figures now as a special PaizoCon treat.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Pyros.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Pyros_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>It wouldn't be a Pathfinder-inspired set without a\
  \ few of our favorite pyromaniacs! Legends of Golarion finally gives us a chance\
  \ to add torch-bearing firebugs to your goblin armies. The Goblin Pyros are perfect\
  \ for <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ or any Pathfinder game that would benefit from a little not-so-friendly fire.\
  \ Both Goblin Pyros in the set are common figures.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KingAndQueen.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KingAndQueen_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a regal pair from very different backgrounds.\
  \ King Irovetti is a rough-and-tumble bandit lord from the River Kingdoms. Queen\
  \ Ileosa is a contemptuous monarch from the Varisian city of Korvosa. He's from\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ she's from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a> campaign. Their miniatures make for a cute couple, but\
  \ I certainly wouldn't tell them that to their faces. Both are a bit on the despotic\
  \ side, I'm afraid. Both figures are slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Efreeti.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Efreeti_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is an Efreeti inspired by Jesper Ejsing's gorgeous\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/legacyOfFire\">Legacy of Fire Adventure Path</a>\
  \ cover paintings. We liked his Efreeti so much we made it the default illustration\
  \ for the creature in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>.\
  \ I could hardly wait to put him on a miniatures list, and I'm pleased to announce\
  \ his time has finally come. This Large figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Dragon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Dragon_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  >Gargantuan Green Dragon</a>, the case-incentive promotional figure for the Legends\
  \ of Golarion set. Like the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqo\">Rune Giant</a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v08\">Gargantuan Blue Dragon</a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy8xrp\"\
  >Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a> of previous sets, the Gargantuan Green Dragon is\
  \ produced in extremely limited quantities. <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles Case Subscribers</a> or folks who preorder a Standard Booster case may\
  \ order 1 Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon per case purchased. The Gargantuan Green Dragon\
  \ stands about as tall as the Gargantuan Blue Dragon in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"\
  >Shattered Star</a> set (about 7 inches tall). It retails for $39.99 (although Pathfinder\
  \ Case Subscribers enjoy a 75% discount on this price).</p> \n    <p>Legends of\
  \ Golarion Standard Boosters come in the now-familiar format of three Small or Medium\
  \ figures and one Large figure per booster box. See the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >product page</a> for more information on price, case quantities, and other details.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This Friday, we return to the high seas with more previews of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set.</p> \n    <p>And hey,\
  \ if you're currently at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>, be sure to stop by\
  \ my annual Miniatures Trading Afterparty in the hotel bar from 1:00-3:00 PM!</p>\
