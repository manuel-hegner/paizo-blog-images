  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Illusions of Ice</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Have you ever slain a demon, sword?\" Manius addressed\
  \ Hrym directly for the first time. </p> \n    <p>\"Probably,\" Hrym said. \"I can't\
  \ be expected to remember every kind of thing I've slain. Listen, Manius, before\
  \ we begin our crusade, do you mind giving me a few moments alone with Rodrick here?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Manius narrowed his eyes. \"Why?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We faced horrors\
  \ together in that tomb,\" Hrym said. \"Monstrous serpentine creatures of darkness—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>\"And an angry dwarf,\" Rodrick chimed in.</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, that\
  \ too,\" Hrym said. \"We became blooded comrades in arms together, and while I'm\
  \ eager to join you in your battle, Manius, I wish to give my fellow warrior Rodrick\
  \ my blessing before he goes on his way.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, certainly, the camaraderie\
  \ of battle, I understand.\" Manius nodded sagely, with the full understanding of\
  \ someone who'd never been anywhere near a real battle. \"I shall return shortly.\
  \ I have men waiting in the hallway, Rodrick, if you need anything in the meantime.\"\
  </p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Rodrick nodded, smiling, absorbing\
  \ the not-so-subtle reminder that Manius knew he was a thief, and would be watchful.\
  \ Manius handed the sword off to Rodrick and strode out of the room, a busy man\
  \ with big plans.</span></p> \n    <p>\"I was promised a bed of gold,\" Hrym said.\
  \ \"Not a one-way trip into the heart of demon country! This fool will get himself\
  \ killed, and I'll rot in some fecal swamp!\"</p> \n    <p>\"That does seem a likely\
  \ outcome,\" Rodrick admitted. \"I'm sorry—Manius didn't share his ambitions with\
  \ me when he hired me to break into the barrow and bring you back. I assumed you\
  \ were just going to be another collector's item. But don't despair. You're immortal.\
  \ Someone will come along and pick you up from the battlefield eventually, and—\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Piss on that,\" Hrym said. \"Get me out of here.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ shook his head. \"I don't see how I can. Manius doesn't trust me—he hired me to\
  \ steal you, so he's prepared for me to try to steal you again. Short of using you\
  \ to kill everyone between me and the outskirts of his property, I don't see how—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>\"Then start thinking,\" Hrym said. \"Remember what I said about\
  \ how you'd need to become more cunning? Now's your chance.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I appreciate\
  \ the difficulty of your situation, but I'm afraid—\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ Hrym is no ordinary magic sword.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"I have no intention of\
  \ going to the Worldwound, Rodrick. If you don't save me, then I'll wait until Marius\
  \ assembles his crusaders to start marching, and I will freeze every single one\
  \ of them in place. They will be a forest of dead statues. And when that grim site\
  \ is discovered, I'll start screaming 'Rodrick made me do it'!\"</p> \n    <p>They\
  \ sat together in silence for a moment. Then Rodrick said, not without admiration:\
  \ \"That's blackmail, Hrym.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I prefer to think of it as forceful\
  \ persuasion.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps...\" Rodrick murmured. \"Listen, Hrym, this\
  \ might take me a few days. But tell Manius you're going to stop talking until you\
  \ reach the Worldwound—a vow of silence, or a period of meditation to help you prepare\
  \ for the rigors of the struggle to come—whatever. The point is that you have to\
  \ shut up. Can you do that?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I didn't say a word for years in that\
  \ barrow. Silence is within my considerable capabilities. But I don't see why—\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I know this is a laughable statement on the face of it, but: just\
  \ trust me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And you trust me,\" Hrym said. \"If you don't come\
  \ back for me, remember: a field of frozen crusaders.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Consider\
  \ me motivated.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Rodrick took his\
  \ money—beautiful money, of which he suspected he'd have to spend nearly all of\
  \ it—and then took his leave of Manius. He headed to Carpenden, the nearest town\
  \ of size, and began making some inquiries.</p> \n    <p>Carpenden was prosperous,\
  \ home to wealthy landowners and the merchants who catered to them, but it was also\
  \ a military town, housing a large portion of Andoran's army. The real military\
  \ types Rodrick encountered didn't give Manius's planned expedition great odds of\
  \ success. They allowed that even a well-prepared force of hardened paladins led\
  \ by a veteran warrior couldn't expect to win any decisive battles in the Worldwound.\
  \ As for a mixture of unaffiliated crusaders and mercenaries led by a gentleman\
  \ farmer who'd read a few textbooks on military tactics? A noble undertaking, in\
  \ a way, yes—but hopeless. </p> \n    <p>Like anyone in his line of work, Rodrick\
  \ knew people, and the people he knew knew other people, and so two days after leaving\
  \ Manius's house he sat down in the back room of small gambling house with an illusionist\
  \ named Horwick. The illusionist was fat, and wore a threadbare red velvet robe,\
  \ and picked at his teeth endlessly with his over-long pinky fingernail. </p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Do you know the goldbrick trick?\" Rodrick said. </p> \n    <p>The illusionist\
  \ considered the smear of old food stuck on his fingernail and grunted. \"You offer\
  \ to sell someone a gold brick, and at the last minute, you switch it with a lead\
  \ brick covered in a thin coating of gold leaf. But you don't need an illusionist\
  \ for that. You barely need a paintbrush.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm working a sort of...\
  \ variation,\" Rodrick said. He explained the two things he needed. </p> \n    <p>Horwick\
  \ allowed that he could provide those items, if the price was right. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>The right price, as Rodrick had expected, was ruinously expensive.</p> \n \
  \   <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Rodrick returned to Manius's house with\
  \ an old sword strapped to his back and a pair of wands tucked away in his shirt.\
  \ The crusaders were more organized now, clearly preparing for departure, but they\
  \ still paid no attention to him as he rode up to the front steps. He wandered into\
  \ the house again—depressed at the lack of small, valuable objects to steal—found\
  \ the chamberlain, and requested an audience with Manius.</p> \n    <p>After a while,\
  \ Manius appeared in the sitting room, which now contained only a single chair,\
  \ the other having presumably been sold for sword polish or something. Rodrick rose\
  \ to greet him, noting Hrym's hilt sticking up from scabbard at Manius's belt. \"\
  Your talk of crusade moved me,\" Rodrick said. \"I'd like to join your party.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Manius grunted. \"We're not on a quest for gold, Rodrick. Only glory.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Rodrick pressed a hand to his chest and put on his most sincere face,\
  \ one that had charmed the coinpurses off men and the underclothes off women many\
  \ times. \"I've spent the past three days thinking about the empty hollowness of\
  \ my life, and my need for a greater purpose. Please. Allow me to join you.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It does my heart good to see you make that choice. My hope for humanity\
  \ has never been stronger.\" Manius stroked his chin. \"I could send you to report\
  \ to one of the crusader leaders... but I think I'd like to keep you closer, as\
  \ part of my personal retinue.\" </p> \n    <p>Rodrick beamed. \"That would be an\
  \ honor.\" He knew it was more likely because Manius didn't trust him and wanted\
  \ to make sure he didn't steal the horses and provisions, but that was fine. If\
  \ Rodrick was sleeping in the house, it would spare him having to sneak in later.\
  \ \"How are you, Hrym?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The sword is spending the foreseeable future\
  \ in silent contemplation, marshaling its powers for the great battles ahead,\"\
  \ Manius said. \"It's just as well—it strikes me as a bit unseemly, having a sword\
  \ speak.\"</p> \n    <p>He can still hear you, Rodrick thought, amazed at the man's\
  \ arrogance. He seemed to think Hrym was just a curiosity, when the sword was really—\
  </p> \n    <p>Well, not a person in the normal sense, obviously. But he was still\
  \ a person.</p> \n    <p>\"We could all probably do with a little less talking,\"\
  \ Rodrick said.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Late that night,\
  \ Rodrick slipped from his bedroll in the corner of an empty storage closet and\
  \ crept through the house to Manius's chamber. The door was unguarded, and why not?\
  \ There was literally an army on the grounds. Rodrick opened the door and slipped\
  \ in, then waited for his eyes to adjust to the dimness, listening to the rich man's\
  \ snores from the overstuffed bed in the center of the room. The only light came\
  \ from the fires outside shining faintly in the windows.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick was\
  \ making a terrible habit of sneaking into places where dangerous creatures were\
  \ sleeping in order to retrieve a magical sword. At least this time he was armed,\
  \ though he desperately hoped he wouldn't have to stab anyone with the sword on\
  \ his back.</p> \n    <p>\"Psst,\" Hrym said. \"Rodrick? Is that you? I'm over here.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Rodrick crouch-walked over to a large wooden wardrobe. Hrym was still\
  \ in his scabbard, slung over the back of a chair. Not even a bed of coins. Rodrick\
  \ eased the blade out of the scabbard.</p> \n    <p>\"Let me out of this thing,\
  \ I can't see—\" Hrym began, and Rodrick shushed him, listening to Manius mutter\
  \ in his bed for a moment before deciding he wasn't waking up.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ drew the old, battered longsword from the sheath on his back and laid it on the\
  \ ground before him. He felt in his shirt for the right wand—it had a golden band\
  \ around one end, while the other was plain wood—and withdrew the slim and expensive\
  \ bit of magic. He touched the wand to the sword, and watched the illusion take\
  \ hold.</p> \n    <p>The beaten sword shimmered and turned bluish-white. In a moment,\
  \ it was a perfect copy of Hrym, sparkling like ice. He then took Hrym out of the\
  \ scabbard. </p> \n    <p>\"You sly bastard,\" Hrym said. \"It's my spitting image—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>\"Your turn,\" Rodrick whispered, and touched Hrym with the other\
  \ wand. The sword was transformed into a battered, notched longsword, decidedly\
  \ unmagical. He shoved the disguised Hrym into his scabbard, ignoring the sword's\
  \ outraged squawk. Then he placed the false Hrym in Manius's scabbard and hung it\
  \ back over the chair. Horwick had assured Rodrick that the illusions were long-lasting\
  \ enough to let Rodrick escape undiscovered with time to spare, but he didn't want\
  \ to test that.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick was nearly to the door when he heard the mattress\
  \ creak. \"Who's there?\" Manius demanded.</p> \n    <p>The thief stopped breathing,\
  \ and tried to think like a shadow. Manius padded over to the chair, drew the false\
  \ Hrym halfway from the sheath, and grunted. \"Still not talking?\" He rattled the\
  \ sword and then shoved it back in the scabbard, sighed, and returned to bed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Rodrick counted to a hundred fifteen times before he was convinced Manius\
  \ was asleep again, then slipped into the hallway and away.</p> \n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>\"Do you think he'll realize the sword is fake before\
  \ or after he tries to charge directly at a demon lord?\" Hrym asked as they dawdled\
  \ along a road many miles south the next day. He'd instructed Rodrick to stick him\
  \ on the outside of the scabbard on Rodrick's back, and Hrym had frozen himself\
  \ in place there—that way Hrym could see. Drawing Hrym was a lot easier when he\
  \ wasn't actually in the scabbard, too. Wearing a longsword strapped on your back\
  \ made you look impressively dangerous, but it was practically difficult to draw\
  \ four feet of icy blade from a sheath on your back in a hurry, unless you had freakishly\
  \ long arms.</p> \n    <p>\"Before, if he's lucky.\" Rodrick jingled his coinpurse,\
  \ or tried to; it contained three pieces of copper and one of silver, which didn't\
  \ make for much of a jingle. He'd had to sell his lovely blue boots, too, and he'd\
  \ never even walked on water with them. \"Wands are damnably expensive, Hrym. I\
  \ wish I was sure you're worth it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The wands still work, don't\
  \ they? Can't they cast the same spell dozens of time?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, I\
  \ suppose, but—\" He paused. \"You're a genius, sword. I could sell you. Over and\
  \ over again.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You could use me to put on a dazzling demonstration,\
  \ then sell worthless hunks of metal that looked like me,\" Hrym said. </p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Oh, this could work out,\" Rodrick said.</p> \n    <p>\"We just have to\
  \ settle how to divvy up the profits,\" Hrym said. \"Since without me there would\
  \ be no profits, I suggest a ninety-ten split, in my favor.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ha!\
  \ More like ninety-ten in my favor. I'd like to see how much gold you'd make on\
  \ your own if I stuck you in the bottom of a bog, sword.\"</p> \n    <p>They rode\
  \ on, bickering amicably, into their golden future.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next\
