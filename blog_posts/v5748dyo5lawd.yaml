  \ a winner!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 23, 2010 </p>\n   <p>Paizo\
  \ challenged amateur game designers from around the world to show off their skills\
  \ in RPG Superstar 2010, the third season of Paizo's search for great undiscovered\
  \ game designers. Judges Clark Peterson of Necromancer Games and Paizo's own Sean\
  \ K Reynolds and F. Wesley Schneider narrowed the field to 32 would-be RPG Superstars,\
  \ and guest judges including game designer Greg A. Vaughan, cartographers Corey\
  \ Macourek and Robert Lazzaretti, and Paizo’s Creative Director James Jacobs, plus\
  \ last year's finalists Kevin Carter, Eric Bailey, Matt Stinson, and 2009 RPG Superstar\
  \ Neil Spicer provided their advice as the contestants answered each new challenge.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In the final round, we asked this year's Top 4 to propose a 32-page Pathfinder\
  \ Module for use with Paizo's <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game</a>. Contestants Alexander MacLeod (Raleigh, North Carolina), Jim Groves\
  \ (Ontario, Oregon), Matt Goodall (Cheltenham, Victoria, Australia), and Matthew\
  \ McGee (Davis, California) responded with four excellent submissions, but there\
  \ can be only one RPG Superstar 2010, and so after the judges offered comments,\
  \ the general public selected one winning proposal to be published by Paizo in early\
  \ 2011.</p> \n   <p>Congratulations to <b>Matt Goodall</b> for his victorious proposal,\
  \ <b><i><a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/previous/2010/round5/cultOfTheEbonDestroyers\">Cult\
  \ of the Ebon Destroyers</a></i></b>. Here's a brief description of the adventure\
  \ from Matt Goodall’s winning RPG Superstar 2010 submission:</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Now is the time to bring down the Ebon Destroyers!</p> \n    <p>Too long\
  \ have the secretive Vudran cultists known as the Ebon Destroyers gone unpunished\
  \ for their crimes of murder and assassination. Too long has the Isle of Jalmeray\
  \ suffered from their deadly machinations. The Thakur of Jalmeray has outlawed the\
  \ cult, and received in response an ultimatum stating that if he doesn’t revoke\
  \ his edict, he and his family will die before the month is out. The PCs must locate\
  \ the Ebon Destroyers’ hidden temple headquarters, battle the cult leaders, and\
  \ save the Thakur himself!</p> \n    <p><i>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</i> is an\
  \ adventure for 8th-level chararacters, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\
  \ and compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world's oldest RPG. Inside you'll find\
  \ intrigue and espionage in the slums and palaces of the city of Niswan and a perilous\
  \ trek through the dense jungle and rugged hills of southern Jalmeray to the depths\
  \ of a diabolical shrine.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>As RPG Superstar 2010's\
  \ Grand Prize, Paizo will contract Matt Goodall to write <i>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</i>,\
  \ which we will release as a <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderModules\">Pathfinder\
  \ Module</a> in January, 2011.</p> \n   <p>But you don't have to wait until January\
  \ to reserve your copy! Head over to the new <b><a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8dv6\"\
  ><i>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</i> product page</a></b> here on paizo.com to preorder\
  \ your copy of Matt Goodall’s winning adventure! If you're already a Pathfinder\
  \ Modules subscriber, <i>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</i> will arrive as part of\
  \ your subscription.</p> \n   <p>On behalf of our judges as well as the whole Paizo\
  \ Publishing family, congratulations to Alexander MacLeod, Jim Groves, Matthew McGee,\
  \ and Matt Goodall. Though only one earned the title RPG Superstar 2010, you'll\
  \ likely be hearing from all of them, and from other RPG Superstar 2010 contestants,\
  \ in the months and years to come.</p> \n   <p>And we'd like to offer one final\
  \ thanks to you, the readers of paizo.com, and to anyone who submitted an entry\
  \ or voted during RPG Superstar 2010.</p> \n   <p>And for those of you who didn't,\
  \ RPG Superstar 2011 is less than a year away!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> <a\
