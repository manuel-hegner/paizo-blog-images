    \ tip that he’s using to cast some powerful cold spell. Color palette focuses\
    \ for this piece are purples, whites, gold."

  alt: "This illustration depicts a female kitsune. She has bright, white fur with\
    \ red markings on her cheeks, forehead, and the tips of her nine tails. She wears\
    \ a sheer, dusty grey-blue dress that has silver accents and fittings (like shoulder\
    \ guards, and silver ribs like a corset; see reference). In one hand, she has\
    \ a silver and blue wand with a star and moon motif. Her other hand is stroking\
    \ a small, pale, white and blue dragon (an east Asian dragon shape, more like\
    \ a snake) that’s coiled up on her shoulders. It has a ruff of fur around its\
    \ head, white like the kitsune’s."

  alt: "Dond Oom is a half elf of Garundi descent. He has warm brown skin, pointed\
    \ ears that protrude from the loose curls of his jet black hair, and brown eyes.\
    \ He’s dressed in elaborate, finely tailored clothing, including a finely made\
    \ tunic under an embroidered vest as well as well-made trousers tucked neatly\
    \ into mid-calve boots. Over his vest, he has a navy blue long-coat. In one hand,\
    \ he has a fan of playing cards (he’s a gambler by trade), and in the other, he\
    \ has a wide-bladed shortsword that has a hint of magic running up and down the\
    \ blade, flowing from his hand."

  alt: "Ha female Uhlam halfling. She has light skin with freckles and a rosy completion\
    \ from having spent long days out in the wild. Her hair is reddish/brown, and\
    \ it runs a bit wild with twigs, leaves, and maybe even a small vine wrapped up\
    \ inside (some of it looks accidental, but a few bits might be intentionally placed).\
    \ She’s barefoot, wearing a rough spun tunic and simple breeches that mostly have\
    \ earth tones with green highlights and leaf patterning. Overall, it looks like\
    \ she might have rolled around in a bush a bit. Around her neck, she has a wolf-tooth\
    \ pendant. She holds a gnarled walking staff in one hand, while mystical green\
    \ runes surround her other hand, as if she’s casting a spell. Finally, she has\
    \ a mystical symbol on her neck, like three comets trailing each other. This symbol\
    \ is identical to the one on her wolf companion."

  alt: "This image is of a full-sized wolf. It’s large enough for Fairel to ride.\
    \ Its coat is mostly gray, but it has some brown/red highlights. It too looks\
    \ like it has rolled around in the underbrush a bit, as it has leaves and twigs\
    \ caught in its fur. On its neck, it also has a mystical symbol, like three comets\
    \ trailing each other. The wolf has a fierce expression, but it isn’t actively\
    \ snarling. Color palette focus here is on greens and warm browns."
