  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"> Hi everyone, Mark Seifter\
  \ here. I’m excited to announce the hotly anticipated 2023 edition of <strong>RPG\
  \ Superstar</strong>, as the premiere Tabletop RPG design contest returns for another\
  \ great year! For those of you who aren’t familiar, RPG Superstar is a contest for\
  \ aspiring designers, originally created by Paizo and licensed by Roll for Combat\
  \ for the last few contests. Like in the last contest (<a href=\"https://battlezoo.com/products/preorder-battlezoo-bestiary-strange-unusual-pdf\"\
  >RPG Superstar Strange &amp; Unusual, whose final bestiary is coming out very soon</a>),\
  \ I’ll be your head judge again this year, and we’re gathering a bigger and broader\
  \ group of judges than ever before, including some new surprise faces on the panel.</p>\

  \  <p>As for this year’s RPG Superstar contest, you can submit up to three monsters\
  \ written for Pathfinder 2nd Edition while following this year’s theme – <b>Elemental\
  \ Storm!</b> After you’ve submitted your monsters, there will be two rounds of judging,\
  \ first by the community to whittle down the submissions to the best of the best\
  \ and then by a group of professional judges with a broad set of skills in the TTRPG\
  \ industry. The top entries, as determined by the judges, will receive prizes, ranked\
  \ from lowest to highest: copper, silver, gold, platinum, and grand. If you win\
  \ a prize, your monster will be published in our next Battlezoo Bestiary, and if\
  \ you win a platinum or grand prize, you’ll get to expand your monster into a whole\
  \ family! </p> \n     <p>This year’s theme, as we announced at PaizoCon 2022, is\
  \ called Elemental Storm! However, these are not exactly the same elements found\
  \ in the usual elemental planes. To win, you’ll need to submit a monster associated\
  \ with one to three of the twenty elements detailed below. For more information,\
  \ including a list of all the contest’s rules, check out <a href=\"https://rpgsuperstar.com/\"\

  \ 2023</b> <em>and the Elemental Storm elements! </em></p>\n     </div> \n     <br\
  \ clear=\"all\"> \n     <ul> \n      <li><strong>Fire </strong>is the element of\
  \ flames, heat, and burning. Creatures associated with fire usually have the fire\
  \ trait or special abilities with the fire trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Water\
  \ </strong>is the element of water, rain, and bodies of water. Creatures associated\
  \ with water usually have the water trait (and often the amphibious or aquatic trait\
  \ too), and they might have special abilities with the water trait.</li> \n    \
  \  <li><strong>Earth </strong>is the element of earth, rock, soil, and the like.\
  \ Creatures associated with earth usually have the earth trait or special abilities\
  \ with the earth trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Air </strong>is the element of\
  \ air, wind, and the sky. Creatures associated with air usually have the air trait\
  \ or special abilities with the air trait, and can often fly.</li> \n      <li><strong>Wood\
  \ </strong>is the element of wood, plant life, and flora of all kinds. Creatures\
  \ associated with wood usually are plants, have special abilities associated with\
  \ plants, or both.</li> \n      <li><strong>Ice </strong>is the element of cold,\
  \ ice, snow, and other frozen substances, but not liquid water. Creatures associated\
  \ with ice usually have the cold trait or special abilities with the cold trait.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><strong>Lightning </strong>is the element of electricity and lightning.\
  \ Creatures associated with lightning usually have the electricity trait or special\
  \ abilities with the electricity trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Force </strong>is\
  \ the element of mystical telekinetic force. Creatures associated with force usually\
  \ have some kind of telekinetic abilities or other special abilities with the force\
  \ trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Life </strong>is the element of raw life force,\
  \ birth, and vital essence. Creatures associated with life usually have the positive\
  \ trait or special abilities with the positive trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Death\
  \ </strong>is the element of death, quietus, and the natural order of the reaping\
  \ of life. Creatures associated with death usually have abilities with the death\
  \ trait. They are very rarely undead (as undead have found a way to escape the fate\
  \ of the death element), but they might be psychopomps or other natural bringers\
  \ of death.</li> \n      <li><strong>Light </strong>is the element of light, illumination,\
  \ and vision. Creatures associated with light usually have special abilities with\
  \ the light trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Darkness </strong>is the element of\
  \ darkness, the absence of light, and sometimes the shadows that play upon the liminal\
  \ spaces where light and darkness meet. Creatures associated with darkness usually\
  \ have special abilities with the darkness trait or shadow trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Mind\
  \ </strong>is the element of thoughts, emotions, and mental effects. Creatures associated\
  \ with mind usually have special abilities with the mental trait. They might potentially\
  \ have the astral or dream trait.</li> \n      <li><strong>Spirit </strong>is the\
  \ element of disembodied spirits built out of spiritual building blocks. Creatures\
  \ associated with spirit are usually incorporeal spirits themselves, though perhaps\
  \ they might not be if they have notable special abilities involving spirits.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><strong>Body </strong>is the element focusing on raw body, muscle,\
  \ and the physical building blocks that make up a creature’s form. Creatures associated\
  \ with body usually have strong martial attacks with the brute roadmap, or perhaps\
  \ the soldier roadmap.</li> \n      <li><strong>Music </strong>is the element of\
  \ music, harmony, and sound. Creatures associated with music usually have auditory\
  \ or sonic abilities, which often (but not always) include a musical motif.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><strong>Metal </strong>is the element of ore, smithing, and metal.\
  \ Creatures associated with metal usually have abilities associated with metal,\
  \ which might include the ability to create or boost metal items, or the ability\
  \ to make attacks that mimic certain types of precious metals.</li> \n      <li><strong>Time\
  \ </strong>is the element of the past, present, and future. Creatures associated\
  \ with time usually have some abilities to manipulate time. Be cautioned if you\
  \ write a creature for this element that time abilities are especially difficult\
  \ and tempting to write something too complicated or powerful; a true Superstar\
  \ can write a time ability that is elegant and easy to use without breaking the\
  \ action economy.</li> \n      <li><strong>Space </strong>is the element of distance,\
  \ the concept of three dimensional space, as well as the emptiness of space that\
  \ contains nothing else. Creatures associated with space usually have abilities\
  \ with the teleportation trait, abilities based on entering or living in outer space,\
  \ or perhaps both.</li> \n      <li><strong>Poison </strong>is the element of poisons,\
  \ toxins, venoms, and other such substances inimical to living things. Creatures\
  \ associated with poison usually have special abilities with the poison trait.</li>\
  \ \n     </ul> \n     <p>Good luck to everyone! We can’t wait to see what you come\
  \ up with!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
