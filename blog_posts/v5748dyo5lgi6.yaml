  \ outsiders as well as its own residents. We've said a lot about the region, but\
  \ a lot of this information is scattered throughout different books and product\
  \ lines. For those who are new to Belkzen or who just can't get enough of the orc\
  \ nation, here's a brief breakdown of some of the most interesting aspects of this\
  \ savage region as well as links to where you can find more information on these\
  \ topics.</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurb120\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9268-OrcGladiator.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><b>Beasts:</b> Orc rangers and beastmasters have \"domesticated\" many\
  \ animals and monstrous beasts native to the valleys of the Tusk and Kodar Mountains,\
  \ though in most cases this simply means caging wild animals until they're to be\
  \ released on the field of battle. From dire wolves to <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"\
  >the strange and tempestuous gorthek</a>, orc tribes rear a number of different\
  \ monsters to serve as their mounts or hounds. Beyond these brutes, even fiercer\
  \ beasts lurk in the hills around the Hold of Belkzen (including a number of all-new\
  \ Belkzen animals detailed in the <a href=\"/products/btpy96ps\">forthcoming Giantslayer\
  \ Adventure Path bestiaries</a>).</p> \n     <p><b>Half-Orcs:</b> The progeny of\
  \ orcs and humans are treated somewhat paradoxically among the orcs of Belkzen.\
  \ On one hand, orcs treat their half-blooded brethren as weak, and bully or abuse\
  \ them to prove their inferiority. On the other hand, talented half-orcs (especially\
  \ spellcasters) can achieve statuses among their tribe as seers or witch doctors.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8fvz\">Many half-orcs consider themselves prisoners in\
  \ their own homelands</a>, and wrestle with the inherent savagery that flows through\
  \ their blood. Others flee the Hold as soon as they are able, becoming storied adventurers\
  \ or even <a href=\"/products/btpy93na/\">founders of peaceful settlements that\
  \ they can fearlessly call home</a>.</p> \n     <p><b>Atrocities:</b> The horrors\
  \ of war are not solely restricted to the orc side of Belkzen's borders, and the\
  \ human knights and soldiers who clash with these monsters sometimes inherit more\
  \ of the orcs' savagery than any would care to admit. <a href=\"/products/btpy8odc\"\
  >Servants of Zon-Kuthon often go to the ravaged battlefields of Belkzen</a> to commemorate\
  \ the unfathomable acts of savagery that transpired there, and rumors persist of\
  \ orcs being held prisoner and <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvg\">brutally interrogated\
  \ in such Lastwall border strongholds as Castle Everstand</a>.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>With a slew of orc-related products coming out this winter—including\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96ps\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #91: Battle of Bloodmarch\
  \ Hill</i></a> (written by yours truly), the much-anticipated <a href=\"/products/btpy97lw\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Belkzen, Hold of the Orc Hordes</i></a>, and <a\

  \ by Viktoria Jaczko, winner of the 2014 <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar\
  \ contest</a>)—you can be sure we're going to be posting a lot of Belkzen banter\
  \ on the blog in the coming months.</p> \n    <p>Patrick Renie<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
