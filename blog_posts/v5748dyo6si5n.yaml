  description\">Happy October! It’s fall, and the winds of change are blowing. When\
  \ this blog is posted, I’ll be on a plane to Cincinnati for CinCityCon, and then\
  \ in just a couple of weeks I’ll be headed to Asheville for Scarefest. I can’t wait\
  \ to see you all! Getting to visit conventions is one of the best parts of my job;\
  \ it really helps remind me why what I’m doing is important. If you’re in the area\
  \ of either of these conventions, come on out and join us!</p> \n     <p>Plenty\
  \ to talk about this month so I won’t pontificate too much, let’s get right into\
  \ it!</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <h2>New Boons</h2> \n     <h3>Spooky\
  \ Scary Skeletons (Send Shivers Down the Boon Store)</h3> \n     <p>Back when <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb\"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a> was\
  \ sanctioned, we let you know that we had plans for allowing the skeleton ancestry\
  \ in a limited capacity. Here, in the spookiest month, I’m delighted to announce\
  \ that the time has come!</p> \n     <p>Those of you who have already played <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02du4\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-02:\
  \ Return to the Grave</em></a> know that, thanks to a recent expedition into the\
  \ Gravelands, several skeletal adventurers were returned to Absalom. Those adventurers\
  \ have elected to join us in the Pathfinder Society as they cope with their new\
  \ existence!</p> \n     <p>There is now a boon in the Achievement Point store called\
  \ “Steadfast Refugee.” This boon costs 206 Achievement Points* and can only be purchased\
  \ once per player. It allows you to build and play a skeleton adventurer who was\
  \ traveling through Lastwall before meeting their untimely demise and rebirth</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Make no bones about it: while your character may be a skeleton, they\
  \ are still expected to adhere to the ideals of the Pathfinder Society. They cannot\
  \ be evil, and you as a player are expected to remember that other players have\
  \ various tolerance for horror themes (not to mention that “playing the xylophone\
  \ with your ribs” is funny a maximum of twice per session). Playing a skeletal character\
  \ is naturally more perilous; other characters built for healing may not be able\
  \ to heal you, so you may have to be more self-sufficient than normal.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Other characters can also be assured that traveling with a skeletal Pathfinder\
  \ does not violate their anathema in any way. Pharasma has been consulted on this\
  \ one and while she’s not thrilled, she understands that these Pathfinders didn’\
  t willingly become undead, so you are under no obligation to smite them on sight.\
  \ PVP is still prohibited, even if your party member is using their own skull as\
  \ a basilisk ball.</p> \n     <p>*(get it, because that’s how many bones most humans\
  \ have)</p> \n     <h3>Condition Removal</h3> \n     <p>We’ve also added a couple\
  \ of new boons for condition removal in Pathfinder Society, based on requests from\
  \ the community.</p> \n     <p>First up, the Pathfinder Condition Removal boon is\
  \ available for 20 AcP. It can heal a number of conditions that could also be removed\
  \ by purchasing healing services with gold; however, it provides another avenue\
  \ should your character find their coin purse a bit light as they slowly turn to\
  \ stone. The full text is available on the FAQ page.</p> \n     <p>Second is the\
  \ Penitent Pathfinder boon! Since the beginning of the campaign, we’ve said that\
  \ all characters have access to the <em>atone</em> ritual, should they violate their\
  \ anathemas enough to require it. However, it’s been unclear how one learns the\
  \ ritual or casts it, so we’ve simplified it. This 20 AcP boon provides the benefits\
  \ of a successful <em>atone</em> ritual, provided your character still spends the\
  \ 30 days of downtime in penance as required by the ritual.</p> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2> \n     <h3>Kingmaker Adventure Path</h3> \n  \
  \   <p>At long last, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/kingmakerap\"\
  >Kingmaker Adventure Path</a> arrives later this month! We’re all excited to bring\
  \ you this update of one of our most beloved adventures, and I’m even more delighted\
  \ to announce how sanctioning will work!</p> \n     <p>This adventure is unlike\
  \ any other. As a sandbox adventure in one volume, it’s nigh impossible for us to\
  \ determine the exact points where Chronicle Sheets should be awarded to players…\
  \ so we’re not going to. The sanctioning documents will include one generic Chronicle,\
  \ which GMs are instructed to award to their players for every three levels your\
  \ characters achieve. This means that once characters reach levels 4, 7, 10 and\
  \ so on, a Chronicle Sheet will be awarded, up to a maximum of six. You can apply\
  \ these to one character or spread them across multiple as usual.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ a bonus, we’ll also be sanctioning the adventures in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide\"\
  ><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a>! Sanctioning the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive\"\
  >Dark Archive Case Files</a> has gone over well, and these small personal quests\
  \ with your companions are complete enough to function as standalone adventures\
  \ as well. You may also find that completing these adventures unlocks new options\
  \ from your companions as well…</p> \n     <p>All these sanctioning documents will\
  \ be posted on the product pages prior to street date later this month. We hope\
  \ you all enjoy this new iteration of the adventure!</p> \n     <h3>Starfinder Adventures</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>In addition to Kingmaker, we’ve got two Starfinder adventures ready\
  \ for sanctioning this month! Both the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0y?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Dead-Suns\"\
  ><em>Dead Suns Adventure Path</em></a> compilation and the final volume of the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers\"\
  >Drift Crashers Adventure Path</a> release this month. Sanctioning documents and\
  \ Chronicle Sheets for both will be posted by the end of the month as well!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The <em>Dead Suns Adventure Path</em> will be very similar to the previous\
  \ sanctioning for the six-volume iteration, and you’ll see many of the same boons\
  \ as well. There’s no new rules content in this book, so you won’t see a new entry\
  \ on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\">Character\
  \ Options page</a>, though ownership of this compilation gives you access to any\
  \ character options published in it. The Drift Crashers Adventure Path will be added\
  \ to the Character Options page at the end of the month as normal.</p> \n     <h3>Sanctioning\
  \ Rule Updates</h3> \n     <p>Finally in sanctioning news, we have two rule updates\
  \ to announce. First, we’ve updated the text on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a> to be clearer about how one gains\
  \ access to an option printed in a Pathfinder Adventure or Adventure Path. Previously,\
  \ the rule could be read incorrectly to mean that all characters had access to anything\
  \ printed in an Adventure. The new text has been added to the Character Options\
  \ page and is quoted below, which should hopefully be clearer to all!</p> \n   \
  \  <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Using Options from Pathfinder Adventures or Adventure\
  \ Paths</b><br> Typically, characters cannot select options from a Pathfinder Adventure.\
  \ However, Chronicle Sheets from sanctioned Adventures or boons from the Achievement\
  \ Points store often grant characters access to options from these Adventures.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Ownership of Adventures or Adventure Paths is not required for Character\
  \ Option use in the Pathfinder Society campaign, as long as rules are referenced\
  \ from the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/prd\">official Pathfinder Reference Document\
  \ (prd)</a>.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Second, with the release of the\
  \ Kingmaker Adventure Path comes our first foray into producing content in-house\
  \ for “the world’s oldest RPG!” We wanted to give our dedicated players a way to\
  \ earn Pathfinder Society credit for running this content, even if their gaming\
  \ group might be a little reluctant to switch systems. As such, the following text\
  \ has been added to the Guide to Organized Play:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n    \
  \  <p>If Paizo has released an official conversion of a sanctioned adventure to\
  \ another game system (such as the ''Pathfinder Kingmaker Bestiary (5e)'' or ''Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path: Abomination Vaults (5e)''), GMs and players may play these adventures\
  \ using those rules and earn credit as if they had played it using Pathfinder rules.\
  \ Adventures that have not been converted by Paizo in this way must be played using\
  \ standard Adventure Mode rules.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <br> \n     <h2>GM\
  \ Recognition</h2> \n     <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> \n     <p>We award Campaign\
  \ Service Coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide\
  \ an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based\
  \ on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this\
  \ award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com\
  \ with their name and reasons.</p> \n     <p>This month, several RVCs were able\
  \ to award Campaign Coins on my behalf at Hurricon, SkålCon, and SydCon. Congratulations\
  \ to:</p> \n     <p><b>Shane Murphy</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized\
  \ Play ID <b>#864</b><br> <b>Greg Ferguson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and\
  \ Organized Play ID <b>#865</b><br> <b>Sandra Wilkinson</b>, who now holds a Campaign\
  \ Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#867</b><br> <b>Ryan Blomquist</b>, who now holds\
  \ a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#871</b></p> \n     <h3>GM Ranks</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program\
  \ involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must\
  \ run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios\
  \ as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent).\
  \ A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Star for PFS1, two GMs earn\
  \ their 5th Nova for SFS, and three GMs earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Kyle Ashcraft<br> <b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Milan Badzic,\
  \ Jim Crase<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Brad Fiske, Ivis Flanagan, Shannon Steward</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I want to recognize Milan Badzic in particular. He is, to the best of\
  \ my knowledge, the first person to complete the Triple Crown, having earned the\
  \ 5th rank in Pathfinder Society (first edition), Pathfinder Society (second edition),\
  \ and Starfinder Society. That’s no easy feat, and I truly don’t know if we’ll see\
  \ it matched anytime soon. Congratulations, Milan, and please enjoy some time off,\
  \ you’ve earned it!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n     <p>As I mentioned\
  \ at the top, I’ll be attending CinCityCon and Scarefest this October, and I’ll\
  \ also be joining the Minnesota crew at <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/skalconline-2022\"\
  >SkålCOnline</a> in November for some Dark Archive weirdness. But as the year closes\
  \ out, we’ve got plenty of events, both online and in-person, for you to finish\
  \ strong! Check out our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">convention calendar</a>\
  \ for all the latest listings. </p>\n     <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate!\
  \ And have a spooktacular month!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
