  \ itemprop=\"description\">Born to a poor family barely eking out a living in the\
  \ small settlement of Estuar on Akiton, Quig Dexel developed a fascination at an\
  \ early age with the various water-purification plants that skirted the nearby polar\
  \ ice caps. Spurred by this curiosity, he taught himself the basics of engineering\
  \ by stealthily tinkering with valve-control mechanisms and reverse-osmosis regulators\
  \ until he was old enough to work for one of the shady syndicates that controlled\
  \ the flow of water out of town. Initially hired as a de-icer, he made sure that\
  \ the storage tanks' outflow lines didn't freeze over during the cold nights. Though\
  \ he worked odd hours, he was able to make friends by helping his coworkers when\
  \ their shoddy flamers malfunctioned.</p> \n     <p>In his spare time, Quig began\
  \ constructing the first iterations of what would become his drone companion, Scout,\
  \ using spare parts he scrounged from Estuar's junk heaps and alleys. One early\
  \ morning after his shift, as Quig hunted for scraps that he could fashion into\
  \ an actuator, he was winged by a stray laser blast from a passing firefight waged\
  \ between a shobhad bounty hunter and her human quarry. Ignoring the pain, Quig\
  \ dropped the hunk of metal he was holding and chased after the fracas. He arrived\
  \ on the scene in time to see the bounty hunter tackle the fugitive and slap him\
  \ in restraints. Flushed with adrenaline, Quig realized then and there that this\
  \ was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.</p> \n     <p>That afternoon,\
  \ after gathering up all of his belongings and mounting a pistol to Scout's undercarriage,\
  \ Quig said farewell to his family and set off into the wider world. He eventually\
  \ made his way to the bustling streets of the Hivemarket, where he signed on as\
  \ a caravan guard with a group of ikeshti traders. Quig spent the first few hours\
  \ of the journey questioning the lizardfolk about their society, until several pointed\
  \ stares gave him the hint that he should keep to himself. He proceeded to valiantly\
  \ suppress his curiosity and tinker quietly on Scout for much of the trip, pausing\
  \ only when a flock of hungry norkasa swooped too close to the caravan and gave\
  \ him the chance to impress the ikeshti with the improvements he'd made to his trust\
  \ de-icing flamer.</p> \n     <p>The journey ended in the ancient city of Arl, a\
  \ haven for blood sports in the coliseum known as the Crimson Forum. After getting\
  \ paid, Quig explored the city's labyrinthine streets and was promptly ambushed\
  \ by a gang of street thugs who not only took his money, but disabled and absconded\
  \ with Scout. Enraged yet already streetwise enough to be suspicious of the city\
  \ authorities, young Quig began asking around about other gangs or freelancers that\
  \ could help him get his revenge.</p> \n     <p>It was there, in one of Arl's seediest\
  \ dive bars, that Quig ran into Dhareen the Vise, the same shobhad bounty hunter\
  \ who inadvertently set him on his life's path. As an awestruck Quig launched into\
  \ his entire life story, Dhareen sighed wearily and told him to forget about his\
  \ lost drone and head back to his backwater town. But at last Quig said the four\
  \ words the shobhad lived to hear:</p> \n     <p>\"I can pay you.\"</p> \n     <p>Dhareen\
  \ scoffed, but as the ysoki pointed out a dozen ways she could improve her gear,\
  \ the bounty hunter reluctantly agreed, and the two planned a raid of the gang's\
  \ headquarters.</p> \n     <p>One week later, Quig and Scout had been reunited,\
  \ and the ysoki was apprenticed to Dhareen, having impressed her with his quick\
  \ thinking during the rescue of his drone. Quig learned much from the gruff shobhad\
  \ over the next year as they traveled the system, and though they often butted heads\
  \ over methods of tracking and capturing their quarries, the two enjoyed a relationship\
  \ of mutual respect. Upon the completion of a sizable job where they collected five\
  \ bounties simultaneously—right under the noses of several competing bounty hunters—\
  Dhareen announced that she was ready to retire and travel with her clan once more.\
  \ Quig was saddened about the dissolution of their partnership, but also felt ready\
  \ to operate on his own. The shobhad returned to Akiton to live what she hoped would\
  \ be a quieter life, while Quig continues to make a name for himself across the\
  \ Pact Worlds.</p> \n     <p>Quig is personable and outgoing—often significantly\
  \ chattier than his comrades would like—and his constant traveling for work has\
  \ left him with friends and contacts across the Pact Worlds. He prides himself on\
  \ being a good judge of character, and while he's savvy enough to withhold actual\
  \ trust until it's been earned, he's not above throwing himself into a fight on\
  \ behalf of a near-stranger if he's got a good feeling about them. Though fully\
  \ capable of working alone, he tends to get bored easily without people to talk\
  \ to, and thus prefers to sign on with teams of adventurers, where he can act as\
  \ the group's resident tracker and starship engineer. While he still keeps in touch\
  \ with his family, he doesn't speak about his hometown much, as he's a bit embarrassed\
  \ by his unglamorous upbringing—when he does mention it, it is with a liberal helping\
  \ of humor. He's a fan of both taking minor trophies from previous jobs and scavenging\
  \ spare parts that he's <i>positive</i> may come in handy someday, inevitably turning\
  \ his cabin or bunk into a riotous nest of cherished junk.</p> \n     <p>Quig's\
  \ closest companion is his drone, Scout, and he spends the majority of his downtime\
  \ puttering about in the robot's systems. He often talks to Scout as way of thinking\
  \ out loud or voicing his innermost thoughts, attributing them to the drone in a\
  \ way that can make him seem a bit unbalanced to those who don't know him well.\
  \ (And in truth, sometimes to those who do.) When he's captured a bounty and is\
  \ feeling particularly mischievous, he often pretends to consult with the robot\
  \ about the person's fate, ultimately claiming that he sympathizes and would like\
  \ to let the target go, but \"the robot says otherwise.\"</p> \n    </blockquote>\
