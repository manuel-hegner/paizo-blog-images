  \   <br> \n     <h3>The Worldwound Opens!</h3> \n     <p>At the dawn of the Age\
  \ of Lost Omens, a massive rift in reality destroyed the nation of Sarkoris and\
  \ left a permanent portal between Golarion and the Abyss. Known as the Worldwound,\
  \ this extraplanar chasm left the world vulnerable to invasion by ravenous demonic\
  \ hordes. An alliance of knights, barbarians, and other heroes stemmed the demon\
  \ army and contained it within the Worldwound, and for the next century, crusade\
  \ after crusade tried to defeat the demons only to fail time and time again. Their\
  \ greatest success, the line of magical artifacts known as wardstones that stand\
  \ sentinel along the Worldwound's border, barely manages to contain the demons.\
  \ When one of the wardstones is sabotaged, the demons within surge out in a massive\
  \ assault like none before. Even before the Fifth Crusade has begun, fiends have\
  \ brought down a city and slayed some of the crusaders' greatest defenders and heroes.\
  \ </p> \n     <h3>Unleash the Wrath of the Righteous</h3> \n     <p>In the <em>Pathfinder:\
  \ Wrath of the Righteous</em> computer RPG, you take on the role of the Commander,\
  \ who witnesses the tragic events that precipitate Golarion’s final stand against\
  \ the invading demon armies. Over the course of the game, the Commander will assemble\
  \ a band of loyal companions, from the redeemed succubus Arueshalae to the aasimar\
  \ noble Daeran; marshal the armies of the crusade and command them in battle; and\
  \ tap into mythic power to alter the very fabric of reality.</p> \n     <h3>The\
  \ Perfect Companions</h3> \n     <p>Each companion offers a rich background and\
  \ side plots to flesh out their history, relationship to the Commander, and role\
  \ within the crusade. Companions both make up the adventuring party you’ll take\
  \ through the game and serve as advisors, lieutenants in the ongoing war, and in\
  \ some cases, even romantic partners. Your choices, alignment, and mythic path selection\
  \ all impact the companions’ relationships with the Commander, ensuring that each\
  \ playthrough offers a unique experience! Check out the shaman Camellia; the ranger\
  \ Lann, one possible Commander; the Hellknight Regill; and Seelah, our own iconic\
  \ paladin—just four of more than a dozen companions available to augment your game.</p>\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Take Command</h3> \n     <p>You’ll feel the scale of the\
  \ conflict in Wrath of the Righteous with the Crusade system, a new strategic layer\
  \ of gameplay built specifically for this adventure. At a certain point in the game,\
  \ you will be granted command of the Fifth Crusade: a grand push against the demons.\
  \ From that point on, you venture forth not only with your party but by recruiting\
  \ troops and their leaders. Gradually, you will build up armies of thousands and\
  \ march them across the Worldwound to seize back the territories and their treasures\
  \ from the enemy.</p> \n     <h3>With Mythic Power…</h3> \n     <p>Further customizing\
  \ the story to your choices, the mythic path you select grants your character a\
  \ unique set of skills that push the limits of the Pathfinder RPG. It also presents\
  \ a distinct narrative arc, ultimately leading to your mythic transformation into\
  \ a being of unmatched power! As Commander, you can become a celestial angel, a\
  \ raging demon, a powerful lich, a cunning trickster, an otherworldly aeon, a rebellious\
  \ azata, a wise gold dragon, or an insatiable swarm-that-walks; you can even remain\
  \ mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living legend. With mythic\
  \ transformations, you can increase the rank of your chosen path to earn new skills\
  \ and abilities while also having a great impact on the world around you.</p> \n\
