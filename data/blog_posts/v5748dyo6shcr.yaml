  \   <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">We’re taking a pause in our\
  \ usual organized play program updates this week and shifting gears slightly. Building\
  \ the program is important and provides lots of games, but that is only half of\
  \ the equation of organized play.</p> \n      <p>The other half is the community\
  \ that uses the games and the volunteer leaders who support their communities. For\
  \ that, Paizo’s teamed up with the Organized Play Foundation (OPF), a not-for-profit\
  \ entity focused on community building. Paizo has a license agreement with OPF so\
  \ that the community volunteers gain access to Org Play program materials while\
  \ donating their time to help their local groups. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></p>\n      </div> \n      <h3>Community Volunteers</h3> \n      <p>The community\
  \ volunteers fall into two main categories. The first, known as venture-officers\
  \ (VO), focus their energies on public game events in a geographical location -\
  \ whether that be a store, community center, town, state, country, or region. There\
  \ are four levels of venture-officers, based on the size community they organize.\
  \ Venture-officers gain access to Paizo published materials based on their rank.\
  \ They do sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), as oftentimes VOs know program\
  \ plans before public release. For more information about being a venture officer,\
  \ including how to apply, visit the <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/volunteer-coordinator-page/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Volunteer Coordinator Page</a>. Questions regarding the volunteer\
  \ program as a whole should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:volunteeragreements@organizedplayfoundation.org\"\
  >volunteeragreements@organizedplayfoundation.org</a>. </p> \n      <p>The second\
  \ category of volunteers are the convention volunteers. These range from members\
  \ of the convention organizing committee to GMs running games and HQ staff performing\
  \ admin tasks. Paizo sponsors a number of conventions each year and contracts the\
  \ OPF as the volunteer management organization. The 2021 sponsored shows aren’t\
  \ 100% decided yet, so it’s not quite time for a full open call, though we expect\
  \ openings on the PaizoCon (May), UKGE (June) and PAX Unplugged 2021 (Dec) organizing\
  \ committees. More information on volunteering for events appears on the <a href=\"\
  http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/volunteer-coordinator-page/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Volunteer Information</a> section of the Organized Play Foundation website.\
  \ The page information, including how to volunteer, will be updated once the 2021\
  \ shows are determined. Currently, the open conventions are PAX Online and the upcoming\
  \ convention is PAX Unplugged.</p> \n      <h3>Task Forces</h3> \n      <p>For those\
  \ who are already venture officers, or who may be joining the team, the community\
  \ is spinning up a number of small-group initiatives collectively known as task\
  \ forces. These teams will work to aid the OPF in managing various aspects of community\
  \ integration and OPF operations. </p> \n      <p>A list of task forces <a href=\"\
  http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/?page_id=787\" target=\"_blank\">clicking\
  \ this link</a>. To join a team, complete the registration form at the bottom.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>There is no hard deadline for joining a team, as people rotate through\
  \ the VO corps they will also rotate through the task forces, though anyone interested\
  \ in helping launching a team should apply by September 15th, 2020.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Until later today, when we discuss Rarity and Access as used in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition) program!</p> \n      <p>Explore, Report, Cooperate (and\
  \ wash your hands!) - </p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
