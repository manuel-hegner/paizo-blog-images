  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo is pleased to announce\
  \ that Maggie Gallagher and Rai Kong have been promoted to the Leadership Team.\
  \ Both have also received promotions in-line with that responsibility. Rai Kong\
  \ is now Vice President of Technology, and Maggie Gallagher is now Vice President\
  \ of People &amp; Culture, both reporting directly to Paizo’s President.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“I’ve worked closely with Maggie and Rai during their time here at Paizo,\
  \ and I’m excited to add their expertise and vision as we lead Paizo into its third\
  \ decade of gaming,” said Jim Butler, Paizo President.</p> \n     <p>Maggie Gallagher\
  \ joined Paizo in January 2022 with over 20 years of HR experience and Diversity,\
  \ Equity, and Inclusion expertise. She has served as an instructor, volunteer, and\
  \ presenter for several LGBTQ+ organizations. Most recently, she has focused on\
  \ groups and organizations that actively advocate for the rights of transgender\
  \ individuals. </p> \n     <p>“I'm excited to join the Leadership Team and to participate\
  \ in the strategic direction of the company,” said Maggie Gallagher.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Maggie can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:maggie.gallagher@paizo.com\">maggie.gallagher@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Rai Kong started her career in web design/UX and web development in\
  \ the computer gaming industry, working for both computer software companies and\
  \ gaming review websites before continuing her career in other sectors. She joined\
  \ Paizo in 2018, bringing extensive e-commerce, web development, and management\
  \ experience from over a decade of working in technology at Nordstrom.com, where\
  \ she used her skills to help lead cross-company efforts in Modernization and Agile\
  \ transformation initiatives.</p> \n     <p>She loves games of all kinds and is\
  \ just as likely to be found playing board games—her current favorite is Terraforming\
  \ Mars—and pinochle as she is tabletop RPGs or video games.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm\
  \ pleased to participate in shaping the future of Paizo and lending my voice to\
  \ meet the needs of our customers,” said Rai Kong.</p> \n     <p>Rai can be reached\
  \ at <a href=\"mailto:rai.kong@paizo.com\">rai.kong@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Paizo Leadership Team now includes:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Jim Butler, President</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Maggie Gallagher, Vice President of People &amp; Culture</li> \n \
  \     <li>Rai Kong, Vice President of Technology </li> \n      <li>Erik Mona, Publisher\
  \ and Chief Creative Officer </li> \n      <li>Mike Webb, Vice President of Sales\
