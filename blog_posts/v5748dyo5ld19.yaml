  \ Game Mastery <a href=\"/products/btpy8l2k\"><i>Plot Twist Cards: Flashbacks</i></a>,\
  \ a sequel to the original <a href=\"/products/btpy8b8m\"><i>Plot Twist Cards</i></a>\
  \ deck. The point of using Plot Twist Cards is to break out of the mindset that\
  \ you have to have a precise rule for everything that happened, happens, or could\
  \ happen in a game. You don’t have to explain why the paladin never mentioned his\
  \ days as a street thief, or how the “Abyssal bloodline” sorcerer is suddenly manifesting\
  \ nagalike powers. In a world where magic is real, genetics are subservient to magic,\
  \ and a spell can create or alter memories, revealing a previously unknown backstory\
  \ is easy.</p> \n    <p>Designer Rob Heinsoo and I call this the “soap opera reveal”\
  \ of character development—as in, “your grandfather wasn’t a powerful sorcerer—\
  he was actually a demon!” Amnesia, secret plans for vengeance, evil twins, clones,\
  \ demonic possession, dream sequences, mind control, undiscovered siblings, psychic\
  \ visions, and characters coming back from the dead are all perfectly plausible\
  \ elements of a Pathfinder campaign. James Jacobs used a derro lab full of clones\
  \ of Wes Schneider’s character in the Shadow under Sandpoint campaign. Monte Cook\
  \ used a memory-erasing witch to have his Praemal campaign PCs re-explore a lair\
  \ they had already explored. Chris Perkins played identity-switching twin elf brothers\
  \ in Monte’s original Ptolus campaign. I used a dream sequence orchestrated by mi-go\
  \ to retcon some campaign-derailing events in my Exiles of Zirnakaynin campaign\
  \ caused by “evil sibling” Rob McCreary and James’s demon-possessed bard.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Using narrative tools like this, even though there aren’t specific rules\
  \ for them (What’s the saving throw DC to resist a dream sequence? What’s the Perception\
  \ DC to realize your ally is actually her evil twin?) lets a GM create interesting\
  \ story arcs for a campaign. Likewise, a player can use these tools to explain gaining\
  \ an unusual ability, feat, spell, or even something as mundane as suddenly investing\
  \ 5 skill ranks in a new skill. For gamers hesitant to go outside the bounds of\
  \ the rules, <i>Plot Twist</i> cards give players and GMs a way to fiddle with bits\
  \ of the story under agreed-upon constraints.</p> \n    <p>(As a side note: The\
  \ woman in the Shadenfreude card illustration is based on Paizo Art Director Sarah\
  \ Robinson. I can neither confirm nor deny that the illustration is based on an\
  \ actual event.)</p> \n    <p>How have you used flashbacks, amnesia, twins/doppelgangers,\
  \ and similar “soap opera reveals” in your campaign? Would you like to see more\
  \ examples of doing this, or rules establishing a framework for doing so? </p> \n\
