  \ by Suzanne Helmigh</i>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The kineticist\
  \ is the odd girl out in <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>.\
  \ All the other occult classes are spontaneous spellcasters, but the kineticist\
  \ isn't a spellcaster. Instead the power of the elements surges through her, and\
  \ she controls the fundamental building blocks of reality in her own way, using\
  \ her own body as a conduit to unleash and shape raw bursts of power and to assist\
  \ her in every aspect of her adventuring career. The kineticist class lets you play\
  \ characters with strong elemental themes, just like those from all sorts of books,\
  \ TV shows, movies, and other popular media. She can infuse both form (to change\
  \ the shape and the delivery mechanism for her blasts) and substance (to add extra\
  \ effects to her blast), making her blasts an extremely versatile weapon indeed\
  \ in the hands of an experienced kineticist. The kineticist needs the Constitution\
  \ to withstand those energies and the Dexterity to shape them, which also makes\
  \ her an oddity among all the classes in the way she operates. She can use her powers\
  \ at a baseline all day long, but she can also overclock them, pulling in more energy\
  \ than her body can normally withstand to gain impressive short-term benefits and\
  \ the lasting advantages of extra elemental energy coursing through her, but at\
  \ a great cost to her durability.</p> \n     <p>In the playtest, I was lucky enough\
  \ to have the most active playtesters for the kineticist, nearly more feedback than\
  \ all five of the other classes combined, and I was able to work with those playtesters\
  \ to refine the kineticist and add more options to open up more possibilities for\
  \ each element. The final version not only has many more wild talent choices in\
  \ her pages, she also gains about twice as many wild talents over the course of\
  \ her career (split out between infusions and utility talents), as well as twice\
  \ as many base skill points each level (4 instead of 2). This allows the kineticist\
  \ to branch out and cover more areas instead of being super-specialized like in\
  \ the playtest. In terms of what else is new, internal buffer grants her an ability\
  \ to store a very small pool of extra energy to use instead of burning herself,\
  \ and elemental overflow now provides more benefits than ever before, especially\
  \ if you wind up taking large amounts of burn and begin taking on more and more\
  \ elemental aspects within your own body. Infusion specialization now works on both\
  \ types of infusion, so you don't have to pick between form and substance; whichever\
  \ kind you use, it's reduced automatically. While the kineticist was always able\
  \ to gather power in order to reduce the burn cost of her next blast, now she gains\
  \ improvements at higher levels; a kineticist with the supercharge ability and a\
  \ round to prepare can reduce the burn cost of her blast by a whopping 5! For reference,\
  \ especially for those not involved in the playtest, that's enough to both empower\
  \ the blast and double it, essentially shooting out two blasts for 1.5x damage!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Every single element has gotten something new and cool (and since there\
  \ are new and cool universal talents that anyone can take, that adds even more options).\
  \ Here's s little bit for each element (there are more for you to discover on your\
  \ own!): Aether gains telekinetic invisibility, which lets you use strands of aether\
  \ to dampen sound and refract light around yourself, potentially fooling sound-based\
  \ blindsense like the <i>echolocation</i> spell. Air can gain evasion and can even\
  \ <i>haste</i> the whole party by either spending your turn or taking burn to keep\
  \ it active. Earth can create deadly areas of difficult terrain that cause reduced\
  \ blast damage—and special substance effects of course!—to everyone inside everyone\
  \ (pair with grappling infusion substance to make grasping hands of earth that hold\
  \ them in place to take damage again and again). Fire can burn away an enemies buffs\
  \ and has fan of flames, a cone-shaped blast available at 1st-level. Water can summon\
  \ a tsunami to annihilate entire settlements.</p> \n     <p>Alright, whew! Too many\
  \ goodies to describe them all, but let's move on to the archetypes. The kineticist\
  \ archetypes are pretty high-impact, in that they can strongly alter the kineticist\
  \ in a way that opens up whole new avenues of play. Much of that is thanks to the\
  \ playtesters who desired alternate styles of play, allowing me to see what we needed\
  \ most. In the end, I managed to fit five archetypes in there somehow, enough to\
  \ cover many of the archetypes that playtesters wanted most of all. The blood kineticist\
  \ gains mastery of blood and can injure a foe without an attack roll by twisting\
  \ the blood within their body. Sounds good for a vampire, right? So I'll skip alphabetically\
  \ to the overwhelming soul, which uses Charisma instead of Constitution and doesn't\
  \ conflict with the blood kineticist; the overwhelming soul uses mind over matter\
  \ to avoid burn, gaining some of the benefits of a kineticist who took a lot of\
  \ burn through sheer focus. Overwhelming soul is perfect for a kineticist face character,\
  \ or for players who don't want to handle the tactics and economy of burn, like\
  \ a small group of the playtesters. Next up is elemental annihilator. This archetype\
  \ is all about killing things with blasts, and she trades out all utility talents\
  \ for increased combat boosts, free combat feats that ignore prerequisites, and\
  \ a special form infusion that grants her a versatile stream of mixed melee and\
  \ ranged attacks. The elemental ascetic combines monastic wisdom with elemental\
  \ powers, adding elemental damage (and of course, the true power of the archetype:\
  \ delicious extra substance effects like trip, entangle, stagger, and more) to every\
  \ punch in his flurry of blows. Finally, the peaceful kinetic chirurgeon is the\
  \ polar opposite of the elemental annihilator and the perfect archetype for a support\
  \ healer kineticist, giving up infusions and blast-based metakinesis abilities to\
  \ gain a large number of paladin mercies (1.5x as many as a paladin gets), metakinesis\
  \ that affects her kinetic healer (like extra healing, healing that brings back\
  \ a recently-dead target, and quickened healing), and a double size internal buffer\
  \ that only works for healing. And remember, this healer heals <i>a lot</i> of hit\
  \ points each time to a single target. Way more than a <i>cure</i> spell.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I hope you enjoy the kineticist and use her to make all the elemental-focused\
  \ character builds you've only dreamed about playing until now, based on all sorts\
  \ of books, TV shows, and movies. It's going to be a (kinetic) blast!</p> \n   \
