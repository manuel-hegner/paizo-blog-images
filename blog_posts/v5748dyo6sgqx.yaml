  \   </div> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">If you’ve picked up the brand new\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game:\
  \ Core Set</a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8\">Curse of\
  \ the Crimson Throne</a> Adventure Path, you may have noticed we reached an important\
  \ milestone: For the first time, every iconic hero developed by Paizo has now appeared\
  \ in PACG. How we got here was quite a journey.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <p>The Class of 2013: Ezren, Kyra, Merisiel, Sajan, Seoni, Seelah, Amiri, Harsk,\
  \ Lem, Lini, Valeros</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>We started, of course, with the\
  \ \"Core Eleven,\" the iconics representing the classes from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</a>. In August 2013, the wizard <b>Ezren</b>, the\
  \ cleric <b>Kyra</b>, the ranger <b>Harsk</b>, the bard <b>Lem</b>, the rogue <b>Merisiel</b>,\
  \ the sorcerer <b>Seoni</b>, and the fighter <b>Valeros</b> became the centerpiece\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy951a\">Rise of the Runelords Base\
  \ Set</a>, and are without a doubt the most played characters in PACG history. For\
  \ those who wanted a slightly more complex set of characters, the barbarian <b>Amiri</b>,\
  \ the druid <b>Lini</b>, the monk <b>Sajan</b>, and the paladin <b>Seelah</b> were\
  \ featured in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy91un\">Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Character Add-On Deck</a>.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2014.jpg\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2014_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n       <p>The Class of 2014: Alahazra, Damiel, Feiya, Jirelle, Lirianne,\
  \ Oloch, and Seltyiel</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>As satisfying and… well, iconic\
  \ as those characters were, we were hot to introduce a bunch more. While we spooled\
  \ out alternate options for those 11 classes in our first waves of class decks,\
  \ we introduced a handful of less traditional iconics in August 2014. The <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy92zj\">Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</a> gave us\
  \ the oracle <b>Alahazra</b>, the swashbuckler <b>Jirelle</b>, the gunslinger <b>Lirianne</b>,\
  \ and the magus <b>Seltyiel</b>, while the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy92zk\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Character Add-On Deck</a> was home to the alchemist <b>Damiel</b>\
  \ (more on him later), the witch <b>Feiya</b>, and the warpriest <b>Oloch</b>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We’d now introduced roughly half the known Iconics, and people started\
  \ clamoring for the rest. There was a particularly loud drumbeat for the investigator\
  \ Quinn, whom people presumed would make his debut in our next set. This did not\
  \ occur.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2015.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2015_500.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n       <p>The Class of 2015: Adowyn, Alain, Balazar, Crowe, Enora, Imrijka,\
  \ and Shardra</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>May 2015 launched the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9a46\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</a>, where the cavalier <b>Alain</b>, the summoner\
  \ <b>Balazar</b>, the arcanist <b>Enora</b>, and the inquisitor <b>Imrijka</b> arrived.\
  \ Those first two mandated a whole new card type, the cohort, to account for their\
  \ respective warhorse Donahan and chicken-snake eidolon Padrig. The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9h3j\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Character Add-On Deck</a> gave spots to the hunter <b>Adowyn</b>,\
  \ the bloodrager <b>Crowe</b>, and the shaman <b>Shardra</b>, with Adowyn and Shardra\
  \ accompanied by the wolf cohort Leryn and the stone spirit cohort Kolo. Quinn,\
  \ an urban character, would have to wait until we were done sacking the Abyss.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We were nearing the goal line, except the RPG folks were moving the\
  \ goalposts. Suddenly, there were about to be a lot more iconics.</p> \n      <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2016.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2016_500.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n       <p>The Class of 2016: Estra, Mavaro, Yoon, and Zadim</p>\n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>For the next set, we had a choice to make: complete the existing iconics\
  \ or branch out with a few more story-based characters. The design team was split:\
  \ yeah, we wanted to wrap up the iconics in a dainty bow, but there were just too\
  \ many other cool characters we wanted to make. In October 2016, the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbg\">Mummy’s Mask Base Set</a> featured the slayer\
  \ <b>Zadim</b> and the first two of our mental-focused iconics, the spiritualist\
  \ <b>Estra</b> and the kineticist <b>Yoon</b>, along with Estra’s ghost ally Honaire.\
  \ Another of those, the occultist <b>Mavaro</b>, appeared in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9reo\"\
  >Mummy’s Mask Character Add-On Deck</a>.</p> \n      <p>But that’s only four new\
  \ iconics. We slowed our roll a bit, saving room for new non-iconics in our core\
  \ boxes for the first time: the rogue Simoun (whom we made up), the magus Ahmotep\
  \ (ditto), the druid Channa Ti (from Elaine Cunningham’s stories), and the cleric\
  \ Drelm (from Howard Andrew Jones’s stories). This made for a richer story than\
  \ if we’d dropped Quinn into the middle of the undead-filled desert. We would later\
  \ follow that inclusion of non-iconic characters from Pathfinder fiction by introducing\
  \ James Sutter’s Salim in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9gdq\">Inquisitor\
  \ Class Deck</a> and Dave Gross’s Alase in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbi\"\
  >Summoner Class Deck</a>. We also added the trio of Dave’s wizard Varian and bodyguard\
  \ Radovan (both previously seen as a cohorts in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v\"\
  >Season of the Righteous</a>) and Chris A. Jackson’s lunar naga astrologer Celeste\
  \ in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2e\">Pathfinder Tales Character\
  \ Deck</a>.</p> \n      <p>At this point, we needed to make some calls. We didn’\
  t have the next base set on the horizon yet, but we wanted to keep bringing out\
  \ characters. So the practice of only debuting iconics in Adventure Paths needed\
  \ to be reconsidered. The other obvious place was the class decks, but were we really\
  \ going to want to write a class deck solely for mesmerists? We needed a new approach.\
  \ </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2017.jpg\"\

  \ \n       <p>The Class of 2017: Emil, Lazzaro, Linxia, Nyctessa, Urgraz, and Zelhara</p>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>In October and November 2017, we debuted the first character\
  \ decks united around an Adventure Path. The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell’s Vengeance</a> Adventure Path features six evil characters—the so-called\
  \ \"evil iconics,\" even though they’re not technically iconics—and we wanted our\
  \ players to get to play the baddies too. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2o\"\
  >Hell’s Vengeance 1 Character Deck</a> featured the cleric <b>Lazzaro</b>, the hellknight\
  \ <b>Linxia</b>, and the antipaladin <b>Urgraz</b>, while <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjy\"\
  > Hell’s Vengeance 2</a> contained the assassin <b>Emil</b>, the necromancer <b>Nyctessa</b>,\
  \ and the torturer <b>Zelhara</b>. I admit that when I designed the first iteration\
  \ of this game, I did not expect a torturer character. But hey, it takes all kinds.\
  \ </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2018.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2018_500.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n       <p>The Class of 2018: Aric, Erasmus, Hayato, Meligaster, the Red Raven,\
  \ Reiko, Rivani, and Zova</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>In the same design cycle,\
  \ we did it again, this time with all of the iconics from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu\"\
  >Occult Adventures</a>. In addition to Estra, January 2018’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9teh\"\
  >Occult Adventures 1 Character Deck</a> starred the mesmerist <b>Meligaster</b>\
  \ (Lem’s bro!) and the psychic <b>Rivani</b>. The next month, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9u08\"\
  > Occult Adventures 2</a> had the return of Mavaro and Yoon, plus the debut of the\
  \ medium <b>Erasmus</b>. This approach allowed us to make the occult boons that\
  \ all of them could use, including all the psychic spells.</p> \n      <p>And now\
  \ we were down to stragglers. At this point there were only six iconics left, and\
  \ no clear plan to deal with them. For example, were we ever going to make the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/jadeRegent\">Jade Regent</a> Adventure Path? I mean,\
  \ maybe? But not soon. So what to do with the samurai and the ninja? A Jade Regent\
  \ Character Deck? Sounded cool, but I had another idea.</p> \n      <p>Based on\
  \ complaints I heard at PaizoCon and elsewhere that the first seven class decks\
  \ had essentially been lapped by the creations we made afterward, I proposed to\
  \ Paizo a new line of decks designed to supplement the class deck line. Using the\
  \ four “Ultimate” RPG books as inspiration, we would make four “Ultimate Decks,”\
  \ each with a bunch of experimental boons and one character each. That character\
  \ would be one that we probably never would make a class deck for. For example,\
  \ with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy97if\">Wizard Class Deck</a>\
  \ and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy97ie\">Sorcerer Class Deck</a>\
  \ already in existence, did we really need a deck with three arcanists in it? One\
  \ would do. So Enora reappeared in April 2018’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vtb\"\
  >Ultimate Magic Add-On Deck</a>.</p> \n      <p>But now we had a chance to get three\
  \ more iconics out: the samurai <b>Hayato</b> in March 2018’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vmz\"\
  >Ultimate Combat Add-On Deck</a>, the ninja <b>Reiko</b> in June 2018’s <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x03\">Ultimate Equipment Add-On Deck</a>, and—in\
  \ one of the most bizarre things we’ve ever done—the dual-character vigilante <b>Aric</b>/the\
  \ <b>Red Raven</b> in May 2018’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wmw\"\
  >Ultimate Intrigue Add-On Deck</a>. Which would— Hold on. As we were plotting these\
  \ out, Erik and Vic let slip that a new book called <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\"\
  >Ultimate Wilderness</a> was on the way, and it would feature a new shifter class\
  \ with a not-yet-named iconic. After some quick schedule rejiggering, <b>Zova</b>\
  \ appeared in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdn\">Ultimate Wilderness\
  \ Add-On Deck</a> in July 2018.</p> \n      <p>All right, just three to go! I had\
  \ lobbied that our new versatile base set contain all the Core Eleven iconics done\
  \ from scratch. My co-designers told me this would be challenging—actually, I think\
  \ the word they used was “impossible.” No single box before could ever hold 11 characters,\
  \ but I was sure we could do it. Eleven was tight, but we could just make it. </p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2019.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190621-classof2019_500.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n       <p>The Class of 2019: Fumbus, Hakon, Kess, and Quinn</p>\n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>But the folks in RPG R&amp;D had one more surprise first. With the\
  \ long-awaited Second Edition <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0k\">Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</a> underway, they wanted to introduce a goblin iconic. Totally\
  \ cool by me, I said, and then they said they wanted it to be an alchemist. “But,\
  \ but… we already have an iconic alchemist,” I said. They would shed no tears for\
  \ poor Damiel, and neither did I when I saw the crazily goggled nutball they were\
  \ planning to make. “What’s his name?” I asked. “Oh, he’s still in testing,” they\
  \ said. “We won’t know that for months.” I don’t draw many lines with Paizo, but\
  \ this time I had no choice. “Our game comes out three months before yours does,”\
  \ I said. “So if you don’t name this goblin quickly, he’s gonna be named ‘Gobbo\
  \ McBoomy.’” Bingo-bongo, the iconic goblin alchemist <b>Fumbus</b> was born. Alongside\
  \ the other members of the newly expanded “Core Twelve,” Fumbus appeared in May\
  \ 2019’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7\">Core Set</a>.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>Core’s companion Adventure Path, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, finally gave us the urban setting we’d been longing\
  \ for, and we could bring in the last three iconics. Along with a new version of\
  \ Varian (with Radovan as a cohort), Curse debuted the skald <b>Hakon</b>, the brawler\
  \ <b>Kess</b>, and, at long last, the investigator <b>Quinn</b>. Iconic collection\
  \ 100% complete.</p> \n      <p>That’s 41 iconic characters (since Aric and the\
  \ Red Raven have separate character cards) plus 6 “evil iconics”, amid—get this—\
  163 total characters and 329 roles. (Why not 326, you ask? At the risk of spoilers,\
  \ I leave that question for the trivia-minded among you.) It’s been a great journey\
  \ with a whole lot of great characters. We hope you’ve enjoyed playing each and\
  \ every one.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure Card\
