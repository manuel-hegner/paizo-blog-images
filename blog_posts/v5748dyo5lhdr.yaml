  \ we're taking a break from our regularly scheduled Web Fiction, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/theGem\"\
  >\"The Gem\"</a> to have author Gary Kloster talk about the elements that were brought\

  ></a></i><a href=\"/products/btpy9cqn\">Firesoul<i></i></a><i>. \"The Gem\" will\
  \ return with it's third installment next Wednesday!</i></p> \n    <p>I always have\
  \ trouble answering questions like that. The problem is that I'm pretty chaotic\
  \ neutral when putting together a new project. I start out with a mess of random\
  \ ideas, plot, and characters, churning around in my head until it all clots into\
  \ something that vaguely resembles a story. Then I get to spend a lot of quality\
  \ time with a word processor prettying things up. So I'm going to pretend that I'm\
  \ really a lawful good book planner, and slap a false veneer of organization over\
  \ my chaos with the classic five question approach: who, what, where, why, and how.</p>\

  /image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8525_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>What\
  \ class should my protagonist be?</b> I wanted this story to be rooted in a place,\
  \ with a main character that had a strong connection to that place. A druid fit\
  \ that well. And druid happens to be the class of the first character that I ever\
  \ role played, which means I have a huge soft spot for them.</p> \n    <p><b>Where,\
  \ in all of Golarion, should this story take place?</b> The Mwangi Expanse. I wanted\
  \ someplace rich in history, cultures, and nature. And I wanted a place that I haven't\
  \ seen a lot of yet in Pathfinder fiction, especially from the viewpoint of the\
  \ people who live there. Also, just to be honest, there are dinosaurs in the Expanse.\
  \ And dinosaurs are awesome.</p> \n    <p><b>Who should the story be about?</b>\
  \ Like I said, I wanted someone with a strong connection to the place she is from.\
  \ But I didn't want that connection to be easy. Jiri Maju, the young woman who is\
  \ the heart of <em>Firesoul</em>, comes from a part of the Mwangi that bears a curse.\
  \ Fire burns hotter and more eagerly there than it should. That curse runs through\
  \ Jiri, and is a part of her gift for bargaining with the nature spirits that share\
  \ their magic with her. Some of those spirits, the ones that burn hot and bright\
  \ and dangerous, have always been too eager to serve her. Especially when she loses\
  \ her grip on her emotions.</p> \n    <p><b>Why does the story begin?</b> What happens\
  \ when a group of adventurers find the Pyre, the hidden ruin that lies beyond Jiri's\
  \ village of Thirty Trees? What happens when they ignore the warnings and break\
  \ into that ruin and release something terrible that had been imprisoned there long\
  \ ago? For the adventurers, the answer is simple—they grab the loot they came for\
  \ and run. This place isn't anywhere they care about.</p> \n    <p>But it's Jiri's\
  \ home.</p> \n    <p><b>How does it all end?</b> Well that's the plot, and I don't\
  \ want to give too much of that away. So instead, I'm going to talk about how I\
  \ tried to prepare for writing this story, which, as usual involved a lot of reading.\
  \ There was the background information, of course. Besides the <em>Inner Sea World\
  \ Guide</em>, I drew from the <em>Heart of the Jungle</em> source book and the <em>Serpent's\
  \ Skull</em> Adventure Path. For setting details, there was a lot of googling about\
  \ jungles, along with questioning friends of mine who had lived or grown up in Africa\
  \ and southeast Asia. Finally, I read books like Ocatavia Butler's Wild Seed, and\
  \ Nnedi Okorafor's Who Fears Death, hoping that a little of their talent would rub\
  \ off on me.</p> \n    <p>Despite the chaos of its beginnings, I really like how\
  \ Jiri and her story finally came together. There's discovery, meaning, and growth—\
  and monsters, magic, blood-drinking spears, and snark.</p> \n    <p>Oh, and of course\
  \ there are dinosaurs too.</p> \n    <p>Gary Kloster<br> <i>Pathfinder Tales Author</i></p>\
