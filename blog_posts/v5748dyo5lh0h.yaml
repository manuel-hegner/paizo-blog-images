  description\">As the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</a> campaign and the Pathfinder RPG itself has developed over the last several\
  \ years, players have expressed increasing concerns about the availability of replay,\
  \ new players being overwhelmed or overshadowed by over-optimized characters, Chronicle\
  \ sheet rewards not having much meaning, and other concerns related to the sheer\
  \ amount of information and options available to PFS players. With the help of our\
  \ dedicated venture-captains, the team here at Paizo has developed a solution designed\
  \ to solve all of these problems—and more. We call this solution the Core Campaign,\
  \ a new mode of PFS play that utilizes all of the campaign's current scenarios and\
  \ resources—only with a significantly lower barrier to entry. Here are some of the\
  \ highlights:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>The current Pathfinder Society campaign\
  \ remains unchanged with use of all of <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources</a>. It is still named Pathfinder Society Organized Play.\
  \ The new option will be titled Pathfinder Society Core Campaign. Both campaign\
  \ \"modes\" use the same scenarios, modules, and other sanctioned adventure resources.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Every new and veteran player may participate in both the current and\
  \ Core Campaign at the same time.</li> \n     <li>For players participating in the\
  \ Core Campaign, only the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/resources\">Character Traits Web Enhancement</a>, and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em></a>\
  \ may be utilized for character creation.</li> \n     <li>At no time may any trait,\
  \ feat, equipment, magic item, skill, animal companion, familiar, or any other character\
  \ option come from a source beyond these three resources unless it appears on a\
  \ Chronicle sheet. Race boons found on Chronicle sheets may not be used in the Core\
  \ Campaign.</li> \n     <li>If an item appears on a Chronicle sheet, a PC may purchase\
  \ and use it regardless of the book it comes from, with the exception of a boon\
  \ that opens up a different character race.</li> \n     <li>Just like in the current\
  \ campaign, a player may receive credit once for playing and once for GMing a scenario\
  \ in the Core Campaign; this credit is independent of player and GM credit in the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign. This means a player can play once\
  \ in each of the two campaigns and GM for credit once in each of the campaigns (four\
  \ credits total, two per campaign), not including any limited replay opportunities\
  \ established in the <em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em>.</li> \n\
  \     <li>At any point a player wants to transition their character from the Core\
  \ Campaign to the existing campaign, they may do so. However, they may not bring\
  \ that character back to the Core Campaign. As set forth in the current rules, a\
  \ character may not have two of the same Chronicle sheet assigned to him, regardless\
  \ of whether it was earned in the Core or existing campaign.</li> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ <li>GMs may utilize whatever books a scenario, module, quest, Adventure Path,\
  \ or other sanctioned adventure utilizes.</li> \n     <li>The Core Campaign offers\
  \ limited replay opportunities for players who have already experienced an adventure\
  \ in the standard campaign. There have been comments that veteran players have limited\
  \ opportunities to play with new players and \"show them the ropes.\" Opening up\
  \ every adventure for replay an additional time allows for veteran players to play\
  \ a scenario with a new player and still receive credit.</li> \n     <li>This initative\
  \ allows for an immediate influx of four new play opportunities every month—two\
  \ new senarios playable in the existing campaign and the same two scenarios avalable\
  \ for play in the Core Campaign.</li> \n     <li>Game mechanics outside of the <em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em>, such as reposition and dirty trick, are not allowed unless a Chronicle\
  \ sheet specifically opens it as a character option.</li> \n     <li>Retraining\
  \ may be utilized as the rules currently allow, but only when a PC retrains to take\
  \ an option from one of the allowed Core Campaign resources.</li> \n     <li>GMs\
  \ will receive star credit for GMing a game, regardless of whether it was an existing\
  \ campaign or Core Campaign game.</li> \n     <li>If a <em>Core Rulebook</em> option\
  \ advises that something found in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> is clarified in the\
  \ <em>Bestiary 1</em>, then the player uses that specific option out of the <em>Bestiary\
  \ 1</em> to meet the requirement set forth in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. That would\
  \ include, but is not limited to, animal companions, special abilities, summon spells,\
  \ etc... Only the <em>Bestiary 1</em> is available for these extra options outside\
  \ of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>The next question I think\
  \ people will ask is: when we will be able to start playing games in the Core Campaign?\
  \ We're planning to have this system publicly available and ready for you to use\
  \ later this week! When creating a new event, the new system will allow you to select\
  \ if a scenario is being run in the existing campaign, Core Campaign, or both (for\
  \ multiple tables of the same adventure). Likewise, when reporting data from completed\
  \ sessions, the system allows the person entering data to choose to report which\
  \ campaign the session was run in.</p> \n    <p>We hope that this new initiative,\
  \ along with the new faction journal cards highlighted in last week's blog, will\
  \ bring an exciting new energy to the campaign on a global scale. I look forward\
  \ to reading thoughts about the new Core Campaign and how it will help your local\
  \ Pathfinder Society community.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">Mike Brock<br>\
