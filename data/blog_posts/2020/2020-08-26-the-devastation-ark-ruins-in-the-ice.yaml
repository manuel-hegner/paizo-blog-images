  description\">The tunnel ran smooth and deep, a gullet boring down into frozen ground,\
  \ beckoning explorers into its belly. Ariad-N5 planned to accept its invitation.\
  \ Nifri joined Ariad at the edge of the chasm.</p>\n              <p>“This is it,”\
  \ the kasatha said, cross-referencing the coordinates displayed on his datapad.\
  \ Together they peered down at the decrepit ramp that curled nautilus-like within\
  \ the tunnel.</p>\n              <p>“I’m ready to get out of this cold,” Talla grumbled.\
  \ The quorlu trudged through the deep snow, her movements slowed by the thermal\
  \ suit she wore to protect her sensitive skin from the frigid temperatures. This\
  \ was a first; in all their years working together, Ariad had never heard her complain.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Construction’s delayed until we survey the ruins, so AbadarCorp\
  \ wants us in and out.” Talla explained.</p>\n              <p>“What’s our timeline?”\
  \ Ariad asked. “We need a few weeks to—”</p>\n              <p>“The corp gave us\
  \ 12 hours,” Talla snapped. Ariad and Nifri exchanged concerned looks, but their\
  \ leader appeared unphased by the impossible deadline. She studied the ramp and\
  \ shook her head decisively. “Looks unstable. We’ll rappel down.” Nifri helped her\
  \ create an anchor using two ice screws connected by a sling, then ran a cable line\
  \ through it. The three explorers clipped in with practiced technique. Nifri rappelled\
  \ down first, the crunch of boots against ice echoing through his open comm channel.\
  \ Then, he looped his cable through a belay device to assist Talla, leaving the\
  \ android alone in a swirl of snow at the edge of the ruins.</p>\n             \
  \ <p>“Your turn,” Nifri said finally. “I’m on belay.”</p>\n              <p>“On\
  \ rappel.” Ariad gripped their cable and kicked off from the ledge. They watched\
  \ the sky shrink as they walked down the side of the tunnel in a controlled descent.\
  \ Suddenly, their toe caught a patch of ice, and they plunged downward. Ariad grabbed\
  \ for the nearby ramp, but it crumbled in their grip. The cable snapped taut as\
  \ Nifri caught them, and a chunk of debris plummeted toward their teammates below.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Rock!” Ariad shouted. Nifri sidestepped and the rubble shattered\
  \ harmlessly on the ground beside him.</p>\n              <p>“Close one, thanks!”\
  \ He yelled.</p>\n              <p>When the android reached the end of the cable,\
  \ a dim halo of light was all that remained of the world above. Their eyes roamed\
  \ over the alien architecture surrounding them. The walls were mottled red and purple\
  \ like the exposed intestines of a great beast. Brown, scabby patches festered in\
  \ places, but there was no scent of decay. Metallic panels embedded into the fleshy\
  \ walls reinforced the structure, and a glowing blue pillar towered at the center\
  \ of the cavernous chamber. The wall rippled as a constellation of arcane symbols\
  \ flashed across its surface.</p>\n              <p>“Did you see that?” Ariad whispered.\
  \ Talla gasped as the same symbols wriggled into view across the room.</p>\n   \
  \           <p>“Fascinating,” she breathed. “There’s magic all around us.” Nifri,\
  \ transfixed by the blue pillar, ignored them.</p>\n              <p>“Old wards,\
  \ perhaps, or maybe this peculiar building material is magical,” Ariad observed,\
  \ peering at the wall where the symbols had appeared. They avoided touching the\
  \ nonmetal parts during their examination; the spongy reddish substance made their\
  \ dermis crawl.</p>\n              <p>“Let’s move on,” Talla directed, and motioned\
  \ toward an aperture on the far side of the room. Before she stepped through it\
  \ a deep, percussive boom reverberated through the ruins. A shape charged out of\
  \ the shadows, and Talla instinctively reached for the pistol holstered at her belt.\
  \ She relaxed when she recognized Nifri, all four of his arms flailing as he sprinted\
  \ toward them.</p>\n              <p>“It…shocked…me,” he panted, skidding to a halt.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“What shocked you?” Ariad asked. They peered into the kasatha’\
  s eyes, examining him for pupil dilation and other signs of trauma. Then they noticed\
  \ his bare hands. “What happened to your safety gloves?”</p>\n              <p>“\
  I took them off before I touched the pillar,” Nifri admitted. “I know it’s against\
  \ protocol, but I wanted to gauge its temperature.”</p>\n              <p>“You should\
  \ have used a thermal scanner,” Ariad scolded.</p>\n              <p>“Enough,” Talla\
  \ pronounced calmly. “Once, I got so enthusiastic about an excavation that my team\
  \ leader had to pry me off a trapped statue.” She chuckled at the memory. “Not my\
  \ finest hour. Are you hurt?”</p>\n              <p>“Only my pride,” Nifri said\
  \ sheepishly. Talla smiled at him.</p>\n              <p>“Remember your training,\
  \ and stick with safety protocols from now on,” Talla commanded. With the incident\
  \ dismissed, they emerged into a hallway studded with valve-like openings that hinted\
  \ at a vast network of chambers within the ruins. As they passed the abandoned rooms,\
  \ Nifri’s flashlight illuminated the silhouettes of machinery somehow both antiquated\
  \ and advanced, now immortalized in disrepair.</p>\n              <p>“If you’d purchased\
  \ those retinal reflectors I recommended, you wouldn’t need that.” Ariad nodded\
  \ to Nifri’s flashlight.</p>\n              <p>“I’m saving my credits for a tropical\
  \ vacation. I got more than enough hands, so don’t worry, Ensie.” Nifri retorted,\
  \ but his voice lacked its usual confidence. Ariad often struggled to read others’\
  \ emotions, but they had no problem interpreting their colleagues’ behavior. Nifri’\
  s shallow breathing and Talla’s frantic heartbeat betrayed their fear. Ariad noted\
  \ the prickle of adrenaline in their own system. They knew the source of these symptoms—\
  the hideous decaying walls, unidentified magic crawling through the air, the ruins’\
  \ reaction when Nifri touched the pillar—this was not a routine survey.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>Talla’s authoritative voice broke the silence. “Let’s split up to\
  \ cover more ground. Nifri, the gloves stay on this time, please.”</p>\n       \
  \       <p>“You got it, boss.,” Nifri nodded and disappeared around a bend. Determined\
  \ to master their own unease, Ariad followed Talla’s directions without comment.\
  \ They chose a room close to the entrance that housed rows of gyroscope-like contraptions.\
  \ Strangely, each device contained a seat designed to accommodate a small creature.\
  \ Ariad had only completed a cursory inspection of the machines when their comm\
  \ unit crackled to life.</p>\n              <p>“Ari, come take a look at this.”\
  \ Talla sounded calm, but she must have found something interesting. Talla stood\
  \ in front of a hexagonal column they hadn’t noticed before. Unfamiliar pictograms\
  \ studded its seamless obsidian metal surface, forming an incomprehensible cipher.</p>\n\

  \ by Pixoloid Studios.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>“At least this\
  \ text is stationary.” Ariad said. They scanned the symbols, cross-referencing their\
  \ own internal database of language and magical code. Unfortunately, their cybernetically-\
  \ enhanced eidetic memory proved no match for the strange writing. Talla waved a\
  \ chemalyzer along the length of the pillar. The device beeped and Talla’s eyestalks\
  \ craned eagerly toward the readout. The knitted thermal cap she wore to protect\
  \ her delicate organs bobbed comically as she shook her head in confusion.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Strange, these isotope levels look…pre-Gap?” Talla gave the device\
  \ a solid tap to ensure it was working properly. “Yeah, probably pre-Gap.” Talla\
  \ sighed, clearly frustrated. With hundreds of successful excavations under her\
  \ belt, she was team leader for good reason, and not used to being thwarted like\
  \ this. “This writing isn’t in any language I’m familiar with.”</p>\n          \
  \    <p>“I don’t recognize it either,” Ariad confessed.</p>\n              <p>“\
  Too bad. I was hoping you could translate,” Talla said in a muffled voice as she\
  \ rummaged through her pack.</p>\n              <p>“Where’s Nifri?” Ariad asked.\
  \ Concern for their absent colleague suddenly gripped them. Nifri was a competent,\
  \ though inexperienced, professional. His earlier judgment lapse was uncharacteristic,\
  \ but what if he ran into more trouble?</p>\n              <p>As if on cue, Nifri’\
  s voice exploded from Talla’s comm unit. “Boss, I don’t think we’re in a tomb. This\
  \ room has cryo-storage and an operating theater. I found some partial specimens\
  \ that look like—no, that can’t be.” Nifri’s voice trailed off, distracted by his\
  \ latest discovery.</p>\n              <p>“Roger, Nifri,” Talla responded. “Ari\
  \ and I are finishing up here. Take samples while you wait for us.” Ariad wondered\
  \ how she could sound confident when they weren’t any closer to unraveling the mystery\
  \ of the ruins.</p>\n              <p>“We need an icebreaker,” she declared, and\
  \ produced a glob of iridescent putty from her pack. She attached it to the pillar\
  \ the way a child might stash a piece of gum beneath a desk for safekeeping. It\
  \ rolled slowly over the object, seeking concealed edges and mechanisms invisible\
  \ to the naked eye. Talla grinned when it settled and revealed the outline of a\
  \ control panel.</p>\n              <p>“What is that?” Ariad wondered. They gasped\
  \ when the panel popped out from the pillar as though activated by their voice.\
  \ At this angle, they realized it housed a keypad labeled with unfamiliar pictograms.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Let’s find out,” Talla flashed them a mischievous grin. She reached\
  \ toward the keypad, then jumped back as the panel immediately retracted. A loud\
  \ whirring sound filled the room and the column’s six faces began to rotate. The\
  \ object lowered, spinning, into the floor as its exterior surfaces unfurled, revealing\
  \ a central core of blue plasma. A hologram depicting an unknown species materialized\
  \ in the glow. The plasma flickered and warped, forming distorted images that hinted\
  \ at the creature’s anatomy. It stood atop four overlapping tentacles, its segmented\
  \ neck arching forward from the far side of its body like a striking serpent. Three\
  \ sets of clawed arms protruded from its ribbed belly. Its only discernable facial\
  \ features were two pairs of mismatched eyes that blazed with inscrutable intent.\
  \ Its mandibles twitched in synchronization with its vestigial front arms as it\
  \ vocalized. A roar of growls and glottal stops that Ariad’s linguistic processors\
  \ registered as noise filled the corridor. Suddenly, an arc of electricity shot\
  \ out from the panel.</p>\n              <p>“Watch out!” Ariad screamed, shoving\
  \ Talla out of the way. The bolt surged and struck the floor where she had just\
  \ been standing. Residual static pulsed through the android’s synthetic skin as\
  \ they stared at the charred spot left behind.</p>\n              <p>“Thank you,”\
  \ Talla gasped. “I thought—” A howling klaxon from the ruined complex’s core interrupted\
  \ her. This warning needed no translation, and the two researchers fled toward the\
  \ entrance. A magnified voice boomed overhead as they ran, speaking the holographic\
  \ creature’s dissonant language. A series of crashes chased them down the hall as\
  \ shutters lowered over doorways they’d planned to investigate. A metal slab slammed\
  \ down in front of them, blocking the exit.</p>\n              <p>“Over here!” Nifri\
  \ called from behind them. He stepped into the hallway and waved his team toward\
  \ an accessible room. Ariad and Talla sprinted through the doorway seconds before\
  \ it sealed itself shut.</p>\n              <p>“I think we’re safe in here,” Nifri\
  \ said. Ariad wasn’t so sure. Their refuge was a control room crowded with dusty\
  \ consoles and machinery. A hundred orange eyes blinked awake as the ancient equipment\
  \ rumbled and whined, booting up for the first time in millennia.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>“I can’t find a signal in here.” Talla paced while frantically typing\
  \ into her comm unit, but her companions’ attention snapped back to the room’s central\
  \ console. A holoprojection of a planet floated above it. A beacon at the center\

  \            <p>Eisyfina’s datapad pinged with an incoming message, a video file\

  \ Ark</p>\n             <p>In the Devastation Ark Adventure Path, the discovery\
  \ of a series of millennia-old ruins sets off a chain of events that puts an ancient\
  \ titanic spacecraft on course to the Pact Worlds. Will the heroes be triumph in\
  \ stopping the dreadnaught? Or will the alien species take the Pact Worlds as its\
  \ new home and conquer the galaxy? This three-part Starfinder campaign is designed\
  \ to take player characters from level 13 to 20 and can serve as a sequel to any\
  \ previous Starfinder Adventure Path.</p>\n            </div>\n           </article>\n\
