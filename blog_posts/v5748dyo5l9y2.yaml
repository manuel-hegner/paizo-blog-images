  \ Great Monsters!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 1, 2008</p> \n \
  \  <p>We've had an awful lot of spider-themed monsters in the pages of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder\"><i>Pathfinder</i></a> over the past year or so. Enough that we've\
  \ actually heard some complaints about how many of the new monsters are spider-themed.\
  \ Furthermore, when we revealed that the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\"\
  >third Adventure Path</a> was going to revolve around the drow, we heard an even\
  \ more vocal outcry against spiders. I'm not sure how much of the spider backlash\
  \ is due to all the spider stuff we've been doing in <i>Pathfinder</i> and how much\
  \ is fueled by arachnophobia, but in the end we <i>are</i> trying to do less spider\
  \ stuff.</p> \n   <p>But it's hard to say no to something like the cutlass spider,\
  \ one of four new monsters appearing in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tp\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #15</a>'s Bestiary. And even though we have a lot of drow in this month's adventure,\
  \ the cutlass spider's not actually a drow creation. It's actually a construct that\
  \ often sees use on pirate ships and other nautical locations, where they serve\
  \ as guardians, bodyguards, or even assassins. One of the most interesting things\
  \ about them, though, is that they can add magic weapons to their bodies, and in\
  \ so doing gain the properties of that magic weapon to their natural attacks. A\
  \ cutlass spider that snatches a <i>vorpal sword</i> would be a menace indeed. And\
  \ guess what happens if a cutlass spider absorbs an intelligent weapon in this manner?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In any event, for those of you who are growing tired of spider monsters,\
  \ I apologize. As it turns out, spiders are just too awesome a source of monster\
  \ inspiration to resist for long!</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i>\
