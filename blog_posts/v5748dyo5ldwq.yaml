  \ Schneider</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Silvered Skin</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p>\"Two brothers. Sczarni.\" My words took on the hollow, metallic ring\
  \ of my sealed visor. \"Their blood is on your hands.\"</p> \n    <p>The gambler's\
  \ eyes bulged like a panicked animal's, his gaze torn between my sword point and\
  \ the copper-scented mess spreading about my feet. \"What?! No! I'm just a dicer,\"\
  \ he stammered—a total coward, and doubtlessly a liar. Obnoxiously, his voice had\
  \ also gone up an octave. \"We roll a friendly game here. Dice—just dice. The weapons\
  \ are just for protection, you never know who—\"</p> \n    <p>He screamed like a\
  \ farm lass thrown from her horse, a surprised shriek followed by a stream of blubbering.\
  \ Good the guards never patrolled these docks, as to someone above the noise surely\
  \ sounded like something far worse than a thief getting what he deserved. I brought\
  \ my sword level once more, Quil's cheek reddened from the slap, but was no more\
  \ bloodied than by a bad shave.</p> \n    <p>\"You killed them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No!\" he whimpered. </p> \n    <p>My blade crossed his other cheek, releasing new\
  \ reserves of pathetic noise. He dropped to the ground.</p> \n    <p>\"Please!\"\
  \ he bawled. My blade rose. \"No! The Calavetti brothers. You mean the Calavettis.\
  \ I know why they're dead, but I didn't kill them!\" The words spilled out almost\
  \ faster than I could follow. When the sharp steel didn't fall, the gambler ventured\
  \ a glimpse at me between his upraised arms.</p> \n    <p>\"They came to my game\
  \ a week ago—less than that. They lost. But that happens—that's the game—and they\
  \ knew the risks when they got into it.\" His shielding arms, slowly lowered. A\
  \ twitch of my still-wet blade was all it took to jerk them back to position.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"All their coin, every copper, and more—they lost it all, but they didn't\
  \ know how to quit. There was some jewelry, a necklace, the hat off one of their\
  \ heads. They got in that deep, and lost.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You cheated them.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It's cheater's dice!\" he squawked. Another steel twitch, and he cowered.\
  \ \"No! No special way. No gimmicks, no rigging, no finger waggling. They knew the\
  \ game—probably thought they had it all worked out—and they lost bad. We threw them\
  \ out once they started getting... impolite. But they came back.\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ paused, waiting for me to urge him on. His discomfort in the resulting silence\
  \ did that for him soon enough.</p> \n    <p>\"The bastards jumped us as we were\
  \ headed back into town. They wanted their money and everything else back. Scum\
  \ like them's why I hire protection and keep it well paid.\" He flashed mangled\
  \ teeth, momentarily forgetting I wasn't some taproom floozy. When I remained silent,\
  \ he quickly came back to the moment. \"But before we'd even seen those two Sczarni\
  \ saddle boys one of my men was fishing a bolt out of his side. I sure wasn't polite\
  \ about it, but I gave them their coin back. Then they got greedy and took the rest—\
  the entire night's haul.\" He'd gotten his dander up. \"I told them that wasn't\
  \ going to be the end of it, and it sure as hell wasn't!\"</p> \n    <p>\"You and\
  \ your men tracked them down.\" I still hadn't heard anything leading me to reconsider\
  \ my condemnation.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-GreyMaiden.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-GreyMaiden_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     <br> A Gray Maiden's armor is as much a part of her as her skin.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"No,\" he said, sounding almost offended. \"There's people\
  \ for that kind of work.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Hired killers. Assassins.\" But of course\
  \ I knew that nearly anyone in the old city would cut a man's throat for contemptibly\
  \ low prices.</p> \n    <p>\"Nah. There's a man who's been lurking around here the\
  \ last few weeks—a nasty sort. Unpredictable, but thorough.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You\
  \ paid him to kill the Calavettis.\" It wasn't a question.</p> \n    <p>\"Why pay\
  \ when he does the work for free? I just had one of my boys find him, explain what\
  \ happened, give him the name of the sty they spend most of their nights in, and\
  \ he tracked them down himself. Those two were dead the next morning.\" He nodded\
  \ purposefully, gloating over the revenge he'd had another take for him. \"But I\
  \ still don't have my money back! You can see I'm kind of like the victim in all\
  \ this.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's this killer's name?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Damned if I\
  \ know,\" he said. He was getting some of his spirit back. I let it pass for the\
  \ moment. \"He's some crazy who's shacked up on the Slug's Trail.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You're still the reason they're dead.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They robbed me! That much\
  \ silver was worth plenty more than the lives of two Sczarni sleazes.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Your crooked game lures in the desperate. Your accomplices spread lies\
  \ and prey upon the hopes of the poor. You bully and rob those who come. You kill\
  \ any who try to take back what you steal. You are a cheater, a thief, a murderer,\
  \ and a coward.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What!? I don't force anyone to come here!\" His\
  \ excuses sounded like a piglet's squeals as he scooted back against and up the\
  \ curved wall, trying to regain his feet. \"And it's not my fault if they don't\
  \ have the money to play. I'm no murderer!\"</p> \n    <p>\"You are.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>It wasn't as clean as that. The dead men's sister hadn't muddied her brothers'\
  \ memories with unflattering truths. And Quil hadn't murdered them with his own\
  \ hand. His confession had even pointed me toward someone who might be even more\
  \ dangerous. But being a lesser evil didn't make him innocent.</p> \n    <p>My steel\
  \ flashed again. This time Quil didn't whimper.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗\
  ∗</p> \n    <p>The back alleys and forgotten streets of the old city wound together\
  \ into a singularly wretched urban quagmire. At times I found myself wading waist-deep\
  \ through piles of trash, the wreckage of broken lives, and the filth mountains\
  \ of rodent despots. At others I had to retrace my steps entirely to avoid a collapsed\
  \ building or a gang's territorial barrier. Fortunately, the prisoners of this labyrinth\
  \ didn't bother me—those who even roused at my passing knew well enough to squeeze\
  \ their eyes back closed and hastily forget. But some things were bolder, and knew\
  \ or cared less about my armor's infamous reputation. More than once a hail of loose\
  \ shakes clattered onto the cobbles behind me as something skidded upon the rooftops.\
  \ I never saw more than a dash of shadows or the reflection of the moon off oily\
  \ eyes, but I knew that more than men preyed upon those lost among these streets.\
  \ In the old city, garbage collected in the gutters along both streets and shingles.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Despite the debris and denizens of the slums, I soon reached my\
  \ destination. The Slug's Trail was little more than a blind alley leading to the\
  \ walled-in courtyard of a half-collapsed insula. It took its name from both its\
  \ short length and the years of discarded oils and cooking greases that coated its\
  \ walls, thrown from the rear stoop of a long-emptied fish fry. Flies congregated\
  \ here in droning plagues, and the squirming things they spawned weren't slugs.\
  \ But despite the swarms of shit-eaters, this had also become a kind of wretched\
  \ safe house for the most pitiable street dwellers. No gang or roof crawler cared\
  \ to contest the flies for their home, and the high walls of the surrounding buildings\
  \ sheltered against much of the wind and weather. The alley was filthy, infested,\
  \ and disgusting, but still preferable to many of the hunting grounds where gangs\
  \ of self-proclaimed slumlords insisted upon rents paid in either silver or skin.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tonight, though, the Slug's Trail was something other than a glimpse\
  \ of urban Hell. It was empty.</p> \n    <p>Narrow and largely uncluttered, its\
  \ shadows shallow, the alley's rough stone formed an unobstructed channel to a sagging\
  \ entryway, the inner yard beyond visible in ghostly shades as moonlight filtered\
  \ through the night's pooling mist. Barely noticeable in the dark, a narrow, uneven\
  \ window watched from just above that opening, a single lazy eye lolling over the\
  \ ugly alley.</p> \n    <p>It wasn't difficult to recognize this for what it was—\
  not just a dirty cul-de-sac, but a killing ground. Anyone attempting to enter the\
  \ insula would have to pass beneath that window and whoever might be lurking amid\
  \ the shadows within. I considered that I might be paranoid, but if I was hunting\
  \ a killer, I preferred not to give my quarry any undue opportunity.</p> \n    <p>Somewhere\
  \ over the buildings and across the nearby docks, a ship's bell rang out the meager\
  \ hour. By the time its echo had faded I'd found another of the insula's exterior\
  \ walls and, using slanting bricks as handholds, climbed through the window into\
  \ a second-story apartment. There were few who could move as I did in full armor—\
  but then, few had their armor specially fitted to their body's every angle, the\
  \ skin they were born with overridden by steel. I could hardly call it a blessing,\
  \ but I am the creature I am, and tonight steel moved as soundlessly as silk.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The apartments within obviously hadn't been rented for years, but also\
  \ hadn't wanted for residents in that time. Broken glass, shattered furniture, and\
  \ other garbage littered the floor, while layers of crass graffiti and outdated\
  \ gang symbols covered what remained of cheap plaster walls. The rats had been at\
  \ the place as well. I didn't see them, but their smell was thick in the air. Time\
  \ and violence had thoroughly devastated the interior, reducing the multiple apartments\
  \ into a broken hall, cornering at right angles around the central courtyard and\
  \ divided only by the low remnants of walls and splintering supports.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Slipping through the wreckage as stealthily as the irritable floorboards allowed,\
  \ I reached a corner and looked down another row of rooms. Here would be the one\
  \ with the window overlooking the Slug's Trail. There was more, though. By weather,\
  \ shoddy construction, or more deliberate violence, much of the inner wall had fallen\
  \ away, calving in great pieces into the courtyard below. </p> \n    <p>A figure\
  \ in black, his form concealed by shadow, knelt at the window, his head resting\
  \ upon the sill. I jerked back into the dark, not eager to lose my advantage if\
  \ he looked over his shoulder. It seemed my caution had proved warranted. If I'd\
  \ come down the alley, the hiss of a crossbow bolt would likely have been the last\
  \ thing I heard.</p> \n    <p>A momentary gap in the night's clouds threw a weak\
  \ wave of moonlight over the figure. At first I thought he was much bigger than\
  \ a man, his shoulders impossibly broad, but a glint of steel suggested that heavy\
  \ spaulders had inflated my impression. The shoulder guards weren't out of place,\
  \ either, as plates weighty enough to bring the unaccustomed to their knees girded\
  \ all but his head. </p> \n    <p>This was something I hadn't expected. I thought\
  \ for sure that Quil had lied to me, or gotten lucky by finding some thug with actual\
  \ skill, but here was something else—someone either trained to wear that armor or\
  \ suffering the worst kind of madness. Of his features, I could see little, the\
  \ outline of a head shaved nearly bald being the only hint of a man beneath the\
  \ steel plates. If he was armed, I couldn't tell, the night and his dark steel conspiring\
  \ to make him a shadow only slightly more lustrous than the rest crowding the wreckage.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>At first I thought he was waiting—perhaps even for me. Could he be a\
  \ guard, and this some elaborate trap? But as I waited and watched from the darkness,\
  \ I began to see his head nod almost imperceptibly, slowly, with even breaths. He\
  \ was asleep. This didn't seem careless, though, with his vantage over the best\
  \ approach and armor still fastened. He seemed more like a soldier in hostile territory,\
  \ as ready as he could be while still at rest. Or it was a ruse.</p> \n    <p>Either\
  \ way, I moved cautiously as I slipped around the corner, picking through the ruin\
  \ to come upon him from behind. During my nearly silent approach he hadn't moved.\
  \ That changed quickly as I clamped one hand around his neck, digging my thumb into\
  \ a tender point, my other lifting his chin with the cold length of my dagger. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Who are you?\" I demanded, the rasp echoing hollowly within my locked\
  \ helm. </p> \n    <p>I could feel him jar to wakefulness and tense with surprise,\
  \ but that passed in an instant—not a good sign. He'd been trained to control his\
  \ shock, his instinct to go rigid. Without a word he reversed his balance, throwing\
  \ his weight against my chest.</p> \n    <p>My own training countermanded my curiosity,\
  \ and my blade slid across his throat. But instead of being gripped by the slight\
  \ resistance of separating skin, the dagger screeched across a gorget hidden in\
  \ the dark, doing nothing to slow the armored figure's rearward charge. I suddenly\
  \ became aware of the crumbled inner wall behind me, my legs kicking backward to\
  \ keep me upright, heels skidding on glass and garbage. The remains of a plaster\
  \ window frame caught me in the small of my back, and I reflexively released my\
  \ grip, lashing out for any handhold in reach. I snagged a piece of wooden beam,\
  \ only to have it crumble like a chunk of clay. </p> \n    <p>A vision of clouds\
  \ made ghostly by moonlight blurred through my vision as I toppled backward through\
  \ the air.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Two of the most notorious knightly\
