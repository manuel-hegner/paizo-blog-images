  \ class=\"date\">Wednesday, February 9, 2011</p> \n   <p>As we find ourselves deep\
  \ in the midst of RPG Superstar 2011, it is fitting that last year's winning adventure\
  \ proposal is shipping out to subscribers this week. Matthew Goodall's <i><a href=\"\
  /pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8ihu\">Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</a></i> pits the\
  \ PCs against a despicable cult of assassins and murderers from the distant land\
  \ of Vudra. Among the many new Vudran elements featured in the module is the book's\
  \ new monsterâ€”the garuda. These avian native outsiders typically inhabit rugged\
  \ hills and sometimes serve as protectors of isolated human settlements. Due to\
  \ space constraints, we had to cut much of the garuda's world flavor from its write-up\
  \ in the adventure itself, but it seemed a waste to simply leave it in my ever-growing\
  \ cut text scrapbook file. What better way to show off Matt's debut adventure than\
  \ feature his winged creation on the Paizo blog?</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>Garudas\
  \ are distant descendants of the goddess Janasini, the mother of birds. Legend tells\
  \ that Janasini made an unwise wager with her sister Ravithra, the goddess of nagas\
  \ and snakes. Ravithra cheated, and Janasini lost and became the slave of Ravithra's\
  \ naga children. Sudachala, the first of Janasini's garuda children, offered to\
  \ complete any task to free his mother. The nagas demanded a legendary bowl of nectar\
  \ said to rest atop the tallest mountain in Vudra. Sudachala flew to the mountain\
  \ and overcame many obstacles to retrieve the bowl, as detailed in the <i>Azvadeva\
  \ Pujila</i>.</p> \n    <p>As Sudachala flew back, the god Gruhastha appeared and\
  \ told Sudachala that the nectar was the elixir of immortality. The wicked nagas\
  \ had tried to trick Sudachala into stealing the elixir from the gods' hiding place\
  \ so they could drink it and live forever. </p> \n    <p>Sudachala alighted in front\
  \ of the waiting nagas, placing the bowl on some sedge grass, and the nagas freed\
  \ Janasini from servitude. But when the nagas tried to drink from the bowl, they\
  \ cut their tongues on the sharp grass, for as Sudachala and Gruhastha had planned,\
  \ the god had whisked the true elixir away, leaving only an illusion in its place.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Since then, garudas have been the mortal enemies of nagas. Only the most\
  \ depraved and outcast garuda would knowingly associate with any kind of aberrant\
  \ serpent.</p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Additionally, we've released rules to run\
  \ the module as part of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign, complete\
  \ with a unique Chronicle and advice on running it within the organized play format,\
  \ available as a free download <a href=\"/download/pathfinder/PZO9529-PFSRules.zip\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
