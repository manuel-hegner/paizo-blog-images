  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week we revealed a number of figures for\
  \ October's <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of prepainted\
  \ plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures, and the\
  \ response at the show has been fantastic. I've seen a few of the images show up\
  \ online from cameraphones in the audience, but today I'd like to reveal the four\
  \ new figures I showed off at the preview banquet here on the blog, to give you\
  \ all a MUCH better look at them!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160603-Salamander.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160603-Salamander_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first is the Salamander, everyone's favorite snake-bodied\
  \ denizen of the Plane of Fire. The Salamander has a cool spear and stands ready\
  \ to scorch your player characters into ashes. The Medium figure is slated at the\
  \ common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160603-PFSLeader.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This masked Pathfinder Society Leader is a member of\
  \ the Decemvirate, the 10-person group of mysterious masked leaders who run the\
  \ Pathfinder Society from the shadows. Are they good guys? Bad guys? WHO KNOWS?\
  \ That's part of the fun of working for the Pathfinder Society. Every day is a surprise!\
  \ The Pathfinder Society Leader is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160603-PitDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160603-PitDevil_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>At long last I'm pleased to reveal the Pit Devil, a paragon\
  \ of law and evil that serves as a fitting end-boss to any fantasy campaign. Or,\
  \ you know, throw him at your third-level heroes and see what happens, just for\
  \ fun. The Pit Devil is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160603-BookOfTheDamned_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>At the PaizoCon Preview Banquet I also revealed the first\
  \ piece of \"dungeon dressing\" in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly\
  \ Foes</em></a> set, the Book of the Damned itself! Like all of the other dungeon\
  \ dressing in the set, this guy comes one per case, and is randomly swapped out\
  \ for another mini in a randomly selected booster. Now, just like the impulsive\
  \ rogue in my Monday night Pathfinder game, your player characters can have their\
  \ very own copy of the most evil book in the Pathfinder world. Fun for everyone!\
  \ Even more fun: The book can be removed from its base, giving you two minis in\
  \ one. Kinda!</p> \n    <p>And that's it for today. Thanks to all of you who attended\
  \ <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> this year. The Miniatures Trading Afterparty\
  \ was a huge success again this year, and I hope those of you who didn't get a chance\
  \ to come this year will make it out to Seattle over Memorial Day Weekend next year\
  \ so we can meet in person, talk about minis, and do a trade or two! Or three. Or\
  \ four.</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
