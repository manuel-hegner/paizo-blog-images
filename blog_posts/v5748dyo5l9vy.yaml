  \ Yeti Outside...</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, December 22, 2008</p> \n \
  \  <p>Those of you who check the blog daily have doubtless noted that there's been\
  \ a few missing posts of late. The answer can be found on any major news website;\
  \ the Seattle area's been hit with a pretty potent winter storm. Now, before anyone\
  \ starts getting indignant about how snow's easy to drive through and Seattlites\
  \ are cowards when it comes to snow (an accusation in my own case that's spot on,\
  \ by the way), it's worth remembering that a lot of the streets and freeways out\
  \ this side are on hills. And when you mix snow and hills, you get icy chutes that\
  \ can only be navigated by things like white dragons who have the icewalking ability.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Anyway, rant about ranting aside, the reason there's been a dearth of\
  \ blogs lately is that very few of us at Paizo have been able to get into the office\
  \ lately, and as a result, blog writing has kinda been set aside. I'm sitting at\
  \ home, typing this blog with a blanket on my shoulders and a space heater aimed\
  \ at my feet, after having ventured outside to snap the following picture. It was\
  \ while I took the picture that I think I heard that yeti stomping around somewhere.\
  \ I ain't going back outside till he's been driven off by the local sasquatches,\
  \ who, of course, aren't coming out until the snow goes away. Stupid sasquatches.\
  \ You can never trust them to be there when you need them...</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs<br>\
