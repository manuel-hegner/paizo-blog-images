  \ Neal F. Litherland</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: Out with a Bang</h2> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">They moved\
  \ silent as breath through the empty tunnels, tucking charges into crevices and\
  \ butting them against wooden support beams. The devil's scent of saltpeter made\
  \ the caverns smell like Hell, ready to burn with a single, ragged spark. Fairy\
  \ lights danced in the deeper darkness where the Lieutenant and Trilaina licked\
  \ wicks and set fuses, making certain everything was perfect. Up near the ore doors,\
  \ Garm and Chaplain laid their casks with held breath. They were so close they could\
  \ smell the sweat of the Molthuni regulars on the other side of the barred doors.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The cleric tapped Garm on the shoulder and pointed to the columns that\
  \ framed the entrance. Garm set the keg down like it was made of glass, gently turning\
  \ it back and forth to set it in the dirt. He was repeating the process with the\
  \ other side of the door when something caught his ear. He cut his hand through\
  \ the air and crept closer, pressing a tattered ear to the central crevice.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You heard from either of them, though?\" A man's voice. \"They haven't\
  \ come up in hours.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Probably off with that girl Goblin's always\
  \ talking about,\" another voice answered. The second voice was deeper, harder,\
  \ with something inhuman in its accent and ancestry. \"He won't shut up about her.\
  \ If'n she wasn't a slave, I think he'd try and marry her.\"</p> \n     <p>\"If\
  \ she wasn't a slave, Goblin would have been clapped in irons by now,\" the first\
  \ voice answered.</p> \n     <p>\"Truth,\" the gruff voice answered. The first said\
  \ something else, but Garm couldn't make it out. When the conversation picked up\
  \ again, the words were more intelligible, and they sent a chill down Garm's spine.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Still, it's strange that they haven't even checked in.\" Leather creaked\
  \ and chain rustled as the other guard shifted his feet. \"Maybe we should go and\
  \ take a look?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I see enough of those two as it is.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Maybe it's time for them to take a turn up here.\" The first voice stifled\
  \ a yawn. \"Got to change posts, make sure everyone stays sharp. I'd rather be down\
  \ there than up here.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You go check, I'll keep eyes up here,\"\
  \ the other guard said. \"You've got fifteen minutes. After that, you're not my\
  \ problem.\"</p> \n     <p>Garm jerked his head at Chaplain. They grabbed the last\
  \ three casks, using the noise of the door as cover while they sped around a corner.\
  \ Chains tightened, and the bar lifted out of its brackets with a groan. One door\
  \ creaked, and weak lamplight slipped into the underground. The door shut with a\
  \ hollow boom. Chains rattled, and the beam dropped back into place.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Your loss,\" the first guard called back through the door. Garm and Chaplain\
  \ flattened themselves against the wall as the man approached the turn, but he stopped\
  \ and turned back the way he'd come. His spear clattered against the wall, and a\
  \ moment later the rain gutter sound of an emptying bladder filled the cavern. They\
  \ heard him kick dirt over the puddle, then the lantern creaked as he lifted it\
  \ up. \"What the hell?\"</p> \n     <p>Garm's soles made no noise on the smooth\
  \ stone as he slipped behind the man and wrapped an arm around his neck. The half-orc\
  \ wrenched, and the guard's neck snapped like a dry-rotted twig. The rank smell\
  \ of excrement filled Garm's nostrils, and he dragged the corpse as quietly as he\
  \ could. He looked at Chaplain, who made the sign of the hammer over the dead man.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I think we're out of time,\" Garm whispered.</p> \n     <p>\"Agreed.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Chaplain grabbed the lantern, and Garm tore the lids off the remaining\
  \ casks. Black powder glinted in the lantern lightâ€”sand with the breath of a volcano\
  \ buried inside. Chaplain started down the hall, and Garm followed a moment later,\
  \ leaving a trail of powder to the others kegs they'd already placed. Chaplain started\
  \ humming an old dwarven tune the rest of the Irregulars would recognize, just in\
  \ case someone got jumpy and started shooting at anyone carrying a lantern.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>\"What went wrong?\" The Lieutenant stepped out from behind\
  \ a pillar.</p> \n     <p>\"Guard got curious.\" Garm poured out the remainder of\
  \ the last cask. \"His partner gave him fifteen minutes before he had to be back,\
  \ and half of that's already gone.\"</p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant nodded. \"All\
  \ right, then. I'll slap the trigger together and hope for the best.\" He reached\
  \ into a side pocket of the bag and pulled out three stoppered clay flasks. Fragile\
  \ at the best of times, they'd do well enough for a timer. The Lieutenant laid the\
  \ alchemical fire-flasks flat on their sides, and uncorked one more bottle. He leaned\
  \ it carefully, the thick slosh of the caustic contents enough to give anyone pause.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Somewhere above them, an alarm bell brayed its single, brassy note.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant glared at the ceiling, then at the others. \"Well?\
  \ What are you waiting for, a bloody invitation? Get the hell out of here!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>They ran, but even the hard pounding of their footsteps and the muted\
  \ call to arms overhead couldn't block out the pop of the cork, and the steady drip-sizzle\
  \ of acid as it poured out onto the clay. They sped past supports and stress fractures,\
  \ packed and fused, everything ready to blow at the first breath of flame. Garm\
  \ slammed his shoulder into the exit door, sending it squealing open on its hinges.\
  \ Trilaina leaped over the threshold, hair flying in a fan behind her and color\
  \ riding high in her cheeks. Chaplain burst out last, boots dragging into the dirt\
  \ as she tried to slow her forward momentum. </p> \n     <p>Gunner emerged from\
  \ his post behind a nearby stone, Denna at his side. \"What happened?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Lieutenant had to improvise the detonator,\" Trilaina panted.</p> \n \
  \    <p>The gnome's eyes shot wide. He swung into the saddle and put his heels to\
  \ the she-wolf's ribs. Mount and rider took off like they'd been fired from a siege\
  \ engine, vanishing down into the obscured path along the ridge.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You'd think he would have waited,\" Trilaina said.</p> \n     <p>\"Did you forget\
  \ what happened last time we tried this maneuver?\" Garm asked. </p> \n     <p>Before\
  \ the half-elf could reply, the Lieutenant burst from the tunnel entrance, his bad\
  \ leg making him lope like a retired race horse.</p> \n     <p>\"I would suggest\
  \ we run now,\" the Lieutenant said. He emptied a flask down his throat, the contents\
  \ syrupy slick and reeking of corrupt sugar and fermented poison. His lips drew\
  \ back, and a shudder went through him as everything in the old man cranked a notch\
  \ tighter. Joints popped, tendons sprung to attention, and his skin creaked like\
  \ leather as the formula took hold. \"Race you!\"</p> \n     <p>They ran, hell hounds\
  \ that had slipped their leashes and had no intention of ever going back. They skidded\
  \ and tumbled, leaping over rocks and dodging over smooth patches that cut corners\
  \ around switchbacks. One step ahead of a broken neck, they made it to the gentler\
  \ foothills and ducked behind an outcropping. Before they could draw more than a\
  \ single breath, the fuse hit home.</p> \n     <p>It started small. A rumble shook\
  \ the earth, like the snore of an ancient colossus rolling over in its sleep. Stones\
  \ that had sat in the same place for centuries jumped and bounced, falling over\
  \ one another in their hurry to escape the fury boiling inside the mine. Everything\
  \ went silent. After a few more breaths, the squad peered out to look at their handiwork.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The mountain exploded.</p> \n     <p>The hidden door splintered\
  \ as fire and flame belched from the stone throat. A choking cloud of dust followed,\
  \ tinged red by iron dust. The valley shook, and a roar like a beast in agony echoed\
  \ across the crags. The surrounding hills gave back the cry, turning it into a chorus\
  \ of rage and pain. Then, like a child calmed after a nightmare, everything fell\
  \ silent again. </p> \n     <p>The squad looked to the Lieutenant. He shrugged.\
  \ \"Let's circle back around, make sure all the slaves got clear and that we really\
  \ did what we came here to do.\"</p> \n     <p>They took formation, and looped a\
  \ wide circle back to the front of the mine. They obliterated tracks where they\
  \ found them, and kept to the rocky areas where they could. They tried to stay low,\
  \ crawling through ditches or ducking into dry ravines where they could move quickly\
  \ without the risk of anyone seeing them. </p> \n     <p>Gunner was the first to\
  \ break the silence. \"Guys,\" he said, peering over the lip of a sheltered ridge.\
  \ \"Get up here. You're going to want to see this.\"</p> \n     <p>One by one, they\
  \ crept over the natural wall to see what they'd done. </p> \n     <p>The mountain\
  \ was the same, reared up squat and wide against the sky. The road up to the mine\
  \ was still there, as was most of the geography they'd spent all of yesterday studying\
  \ so thoroughly. But the mine itself was completely unrecognizable. All that was\
  \ left was a depression filled with crumbled rock and the remains of a few structures\
  \ that had fallen down into the hole when their supports collapsed. One defensive\
  \ wall had been shaken out like loose teeth, and the other clung on, nearly pristine\
  \ despite the destruction that had reshaped the landscape in a moment. Nothing moved\
  \ down among the destruction, except the odd tongue of fire that licked across smashed\
  \ beams or broken doors.</p> \n     <p>\"I told you it was poorly built,\" Chaplain\
  \ said. </p> \n     <p>The others grinned, and at a hand signal from the Lieutenant\
  \ dipped back down out of sight. They hunkered close together, eyes combing fore\
  \ and rear to make sure no unexpected outliers took them by surprise again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Everyone, listen up,\" the Lieutenant said. \"We did good work. But\
  \ this is just the tip of the iceberg.\"</p> \n     <p>He smoothed the settled dust\
  \ and laid out the countryside all around him and his squad. Mountains to the east,\
  \ flat countryside broken by cities and rivers to the west. With precise measurements\
  \ he drew three more X's along the mountains.</p> \n     <p>\"We've made a good\
  \ start, but a few escaped slaves and a single collapsed ore pit aren't going to\
  \ slow down the war machine that Markwin Teldas and his ilk have built in this little\
  \ place,\" the Lieutenant said. \"The plan right now is to stay one step ahead of\
  \ the reinforcements that will be combing the mountains, and make sure we have a\
  \ few encore performances before we head back home to Andoran, where I'm sure we'll\
  \ be welcomed with open arms and enough medals to tear your tunics.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The Lieutenant put his right hand out over the map. The others did the same,\
  \ gripping tight to each other. The Lieutenant smiled, and his troops returned it.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>They were the best of the best of the bottom of the barrel. The\
  \ bloody hands that broke locks and necks with equal aplomb. They had their mission,\
  \ and nothing would stand in their way. Gods above and below help the poor fools\
  \ who chose to try.</p> \n     <p>\"Gunner, take point,\" the Lieutenant said. \"\
  If Trevon is to be believed, then we're going to have company very soon, and I doubt\
  \ they'll be as thrilled with our night's work as we are.\" He rose stiffly to his\
  \ feet. \"All right, Irregulars, let's move out.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next\
