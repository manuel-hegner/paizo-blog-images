  \ Society!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 29, 2009</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ 2009 RPG Superstar contest drew in hundreds of entries from around the world in\
  \ a contest to crown the ultimate new roleplaying game design talent. It took the\
  \ judges six weeks to reduce the mountain of entries to the 32 finalists and a handful\
  \ of alternates. That means hundreds of you didn't make it into the RPG Superstar\
  \ Top 32—that means that hundreds of you should submit for the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario Open Call!</p> \n   <p>You submitted to RPG Superstar not only hoping\
  \ to win an RPG Design contest, but also hoping to get a chance to see your name\
  \ on a Pathfinder Module sitting on the shelf at your local game store. Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenarios may not be sold in stores, but getting your name on one is no\
  \ less prestigious—you get to see your name on a product being used in hundreds,\
  \ maybe even thousands, of organized play tables around the world.</p> \n   <p>Alternatively,\
  \ and perhaps even more importantly, being selected to write a scenario for Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play does one other thing for you: it gets your foot in the\
  \ door. Write a good scenario, one that blows me away with its writing style, imagery,\
  \ ideas, and maps, and I'll be in the editorial pit the moment after I read it saying,\
  \ \"This is the person you want for X assignment!\" Writing a scenario gets you\
  \ noticed, may get you additional writing work, and keeps you fresh in our minds\
  \ when thinking of new talent to tap for new projects.</p> \n   <p>Our <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety/submissions\">current open call</a> runs through midnight tomorrow—\
  plenty of time to get a submission in for at least one of them! I hope to see yours\
  \ in the submission stack.</p> \n   <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>Events Manager</p> \n\
