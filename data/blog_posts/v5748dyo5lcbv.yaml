  \ E. Vardeman</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: The Lord's Due</h2> \n   <blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>Rorr exploded through the wall of flames and stumbled past, finding relative\
  \ cool beyond. The fire arrow had not yet spread its fury deeper into the granary,\
  \ but he knew that the building and its grain stores were already far past saving.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Fren!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Pa! Over here!\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr followed\
  \ the faint sound, again grimly satisfied that his stepson once more called him\
  \ father. That was an obstacle he had long sought to overcome. His brother's son\
  \ was not his own. How could he be both uncle and father to the boy? Yet he wanted\
  \ to. It had proven difficult for all of them—Beeah especially, since she had to\
  \ see her children's father reflected in him. Rorr knew he was a pale reflection\
  \ of Ulane, but the resemblance was still there.</p> \n    <p>\"This way! I can't\
  \ get the door open!\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr coughed as he skirted the bin of grain.\
  \ Torvan had the central bin filled and had left a path around it, possibly to afford\
  \ easier access to the oldest grain first. He passed more than one portal that might\
  \ open to pour out a steady flow of the harvest wheat.</p> \n    <p>Gasping for\
  \ breath, he ran into Fren before he saw him. The smoke had become too thick, and\
  \ his eyes watered.</p> \n    <p>\"It's a door to the outside, but I can't open\
  \ it. I tried to go back, but the flames—!\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr threw back the latch,\
  \ but the door refused to open. He hunkered down, then blasted out, shoulder smashing\
  \ through the wood. For a moment he thought he would be held captive in the center\
  \ of the door. Then the hinges broke and he tumbled outside. Smoke billowed out.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Are you all right?\" Fren laughed without humor. \"The door swung inward,\
  \ not out. We were—\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr extracted himself from the wood, splinters\
  \ poking from his body like porcupine quills. He scooped up his stepson and ran,\
  \ ignoring the boy's frantic attempts to break from his grasp. Gasping from exhaustion,\
  \ he finally dropped Fren and pointed.</p> \n    <p>\"Horse. Get on. \"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I'm not a child! You—\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr once more engulfed his stepson\
  \ in a powerful hug and clumsily mounted. Even before he had his seat, his heels\
  \ raked at the horse's flanks, getting it moving. The horse had barely gone fifty\
  \ yards when the granary exploded like the very sun. Burning grain cascaded down\
  \ in fiery flutters around them. Rorr kept the horse trotting along at its top speed.\
  \ Only when the roar diminished did he slow and turn to look back.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  What happened?\" Fren coughed and wiped soot from his face. \"The grain?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"The dust catches fire easily. Trapped inside the granary, it exploded.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You knew that would happen?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I've seen such things\
  \ before.\" Rorr said. In truth, he had loosed such a ferocious storm on others\
  \ before, for the same reason as the brigands.</p> \n    <p>\"What are we going\
  \ to do?\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr let his stepson find a less awkward seat on the horse.\
  \ He took a deep breath to clear his lungs, then said, \"We search for the Torvans,\
  \ but I don't think we will find them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Do you think they got away\
  \ before the soldiers came?\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr said nothing.</p> \n    <p></p>\n\
  \    <center>\n     ∗ ∗ ∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>\"There was nothing\
  \ you could do to save the grain?\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr smiled a little at his wife's\
  \ question. Always the practical one, Beeah. He shook his head.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Since you found no trace of them, I can only assume they simply left.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Ma, it wasn't like that. There were these soldiers, and Pa stood up to\
  \ them.\" Fren looked at Rorr with a glimmer of respect. \"He saved me when the\
  \ granary caught fire.\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr hadn't bothered relating the details.\
  \ Letting Beeah know only what was necessary seemed most prudent. Worry over brigands\
  \ and the like served no purpose, now that the attackers lay dead.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  We need to finish plowing,\" he said. \"As much fun as speculating about Thom Torvan\
  \ and his family might be, it does nothing to prepare us for the winter.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"He's right,\" Beeah said, lips drawn into a disapproving line. \"No time\
  \ to waste now. We can sit around the fire this winter and spin wild tales of how\
  \ Thom and Ganley are off somewhere with that brood of theirs, enjoying the fine\
  \ weather on a southern beach.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But Ma, those men were killers.\
  \ They—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Work, young man. Now. You too, Rayallan. You weren't finished\
  \ sorting through the onions.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aw, Ma, there aren't any rotten ones.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Then start with the potatoes. Small ones in one pile, larger ones\
  \ in another.\"</p> \n    <p>The two boys went off, but Beeah reached out and stopped\
  \ her husband. He winced, just a little, as her fingers gripped his forearm.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What really happened there?\" She peeled back his bloody sleeve to\
  \ reveal the wound he had field-bandaged before returning. \"Are the Torvans dead?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Didn't find bodies. They might be dead.\" He forced a smile. \"\
  Or they might be relaxing on that southern beach, waiting for winter to freeze our\
  \ bones so they'll have a laugh on us.\"</p> \n    <p>Beeah started to say something,\
  \ hesitated, then muttered, \"You're just like Ulane.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are—were—\
  brothers,\" he said, unsure of what else to say.</p> \n    <p>\"The plague did so\
  \ much damage. I thought we were safe. The Torvans, not a one of them caught it.\
  \ No one else this side of Pitax caught it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Except Ulane.\" Rorr\
  \ hugged her, then pushed back as he became self-conscious about such a display\
  \ of affection. He realized he was trying to convince himself that the past meant\
  \ nothing, and that the future didn't hold a fate like the Torvans'. \"There're\
  \ fields to be plowed, and I don't trust Fren to cut a straight row.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"With that worthless horse, how could he? It wanders from side to side like\
  \ a drunken gnome. Get on, now.\" Making her words light did nothing to brighten\
  \ the darkness in Beeah's eyes. Rorr quickly left.</p> \n    <p>He could deal with\
  \ a balky plow horse, or the annoying worms that gnawed at the roots of his crop.\
  \ Even the brigands who had plundered the Torvan farm.</p> \n    <p>That last worried\
  \ at him as he walked slowly to the field. Brigands would have stolen, not destroyed.\
  \ Selling such bounty in Port Ice would have brought enough wealth to keep them\
  \ in whores and ale for the entire winter. Something about the destruction wasn't\
  \ right.</p> \n    <p>\"All hitched and ready to plow,\" Fren called, seeing him\
  \ approach.</p> \n    <p>\"Why didn't you begin? There're miles of rows to be plowed.\"\
  \ He bent, caught up a thick, dry clod and tossed it playfully at his stepson. Fren\
  \ dodged it easily.</p> \n    <p>\"The horse wants you and nobody else.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"That's an inventive excuse. Get to moving the rocks at the far side of\
  \ the field into a stack so I can keep a straight row.\"</p> \n    <p>Rorr slid\
  \ the reins over his shoulder, took the plow handles, and called to the horse to\
  \ begin pulling. As terrible a riding horse as this one was, it had strength and\
  \ surefootedness in the field, and more often than not it dropped a load to help\
  \ with fertilizing. The first two long rows went well, with the brittle husks cut\
  \ and turned under the soil to rot and give sustenance to new crops in the spring.\
  \ On the third, Rorr stopped and stared.</p> \n    <p>His eyesight was keen, and\
  \ the approaching riders became visible minutes before his son saw them. Then even\
  \ the boy could not miss the riders.</p> \n    <p>\"Who are they, Pa?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Don't say a word when they get here. No matter what I say, you obey instantly.\
  \ Understood?\"</p> \n    <p>\"But—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Understand?\" The edge in his\
  \ voice made the boy recoil, then nod slowly.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <table\

  \ \n    <p>Rorr stepped away from the plow, wiped sweat from his forehead, then\
  \ faced the four riders. All wore tabards with the same coat of arms he had seen\
  \ on the brigand's shield. He started to order Fren to the house, but the lead rider\
  \ motioned and another rode to a position where such retreat would be cut off.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Stay close,\" Rorr said in a low voice. Louder, \"Who might you be?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Soldiers of Lord Suvarian, peasant. Show respect for vassals of\
  \ your lord.\"</p> \n    <p>\"There's no lord to rule over this land. This stretch\
  \ of the River Kingdoms hasn't had royalty to govern it since the last border war.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"That has changed. Suvarian claims this land all the way to Brevoy.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The farm is mine. By edict of Duke Gessmen.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Who\
  \ is dead in a border skirmish. How is it you claim ownership through a duke long\
  \ deceased, yet deny Lord Suvarian's rule?\" The soldier rode closer. Soot lay heavy\
  \ on his tabard, disguising much of the gerfalcon rampant coat of arms. The man\
  \ wore leather armor beneath and carried his sword in a scabbard slung from his\
  \ saddle and under his left leg. The scar on his face, his lean body and quick,\
  \ nervous movements, told of a soldier anticipating battle.</p> \n    <p>\"I want\
  \ only to farm my land in peace.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Peace,\" the rider said, sneering.\
  \ \"There can be none as long as you befoul Lord Suvarian's land.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  This is my land,\" Rorr said stubbornly.</p> \n    <p>\"Pa, he—\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Quiet,\" Rorr snapped. He saw the outrider's amused expression, but the soldier\
  \ watched like the bird sigil on his chest. It would take but an instant to draw\
  \ his sword and swoop down should Fren bolt for the house.</p> \n    <p>\"My lord—\
  <i>your lord</i>—claims all this land for grazing. He has a vast herd and supplies\
  \ the war effort along the Sellen.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then grain would be in demand.\
  \ I can sell—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Milord doesn't want your filthy grain. It's not even\
  \ fit for his cattle. If you leave this land now, it will return to grass by the\
  \ summer and provide proper fodder.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Where would you have us go?\"\
  \ Fren pushed past Rorr and stared at the soldier, too young and foolish to understand\
  \ fear.</p> \n    <p>\"What does it matter? Leave. Your neighbors have departed.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The Torvans? Where are they?\" Rorr saw the smirk and how the warrior\
  \ unconsciously touched the soot on his armor.</p> \n    <p>\"It doesn't matter.\
  \ Perhaps they have gone to the Boneyard. If you want to avoid meeting them in Pharasma's\
  \ sweet embrace, leave.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No!\" Fren jerked free of his stepfather\
  \ and moved forward, fists small and bony.</p> \n    <p>\"One of them has sand in\
  \ the gizzard,\" another soldier said, amused.</p> \n    <p>\"Give him a sword,\
  \ Darrotte,\" ordered the leader. \"I would see if their skill matches their fine\
  \ words.\"</p> \n    <p>The warrior reached behind his saddle and whipped out a\
  \ short sword. He held it high to catch the sun, flashed it in Rorr's direction,\
  \ then sent it wheeling through the air. It landed point down in the plowed ground\
  \ at Rorr's feet. </p> \n    <p>Rorr held Fren back to keep him from seizing it.\
  \ \"We're farmers,\" he said. \"What chance would we have against four warriors?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"The best in Lord Suvarian's army,\" bragged the leader.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"It would be doubly foolish for a farmer to fight you, then.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"They would drive us from our land!\" Fren showed his outrage, but Rorr tightened\
  \ his grip to hold the boy back.</p> \n    <p>\"Keep the sword. You might need it—\
  as you leave Lord Suvarian's pastureland!\" The leader laughed, pulled hard on his\
  \ horse's reins and motioned for his men to follow. They galloped away.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Only when they were out of sight did Rorr release his stepson.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"You can't let them chase us away. This was my father's land! My real father!\"\
  \ Fren's eyes welled with unshed tears of rage.</p> \n    <p>\"This is what I think\
  \ of their weapons.\" Rorr yanked the sword from the dirt, placed the point at an\
  \ angle against the ground, and stomped down hard. The blade broke raggedly a few\
  \ inches above the hilt. Rorr flung the piece in his hand as far away from him as\
  \ he could.</p> \n    <p>\"Coward,\" Fren grated. He ran for the house.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Rorr let the boy go. It would do no good to explain that these four meant\
  \ nothing. They were messengers only.</p> \n    <p>But messengers could be dangerous.\
  \ Rorr heaved a deep sigh, then returned to his plowing. The cold wind blowing from\
  \ the north chilled him more than ever.</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n     ∗\
  \ ∗ ∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Rorr poked at the food on his plate.\
  \ Both Fren and Rayallan had chosen not to sit at the table with him. He understood\
  \ but did not approve. He looked up at Beeah and said, \"This is our land.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It's Ulane's,\" she said, not meeting his gaze. \"There's no reason\
  \ for you to fight for it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's <i>our</i> land,\" he said harshly.\
  \ \"Ulane is dead. Would you have me die at the end of a sword wielded by those\
  \ brigands?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Fren said they were a lord's officers. Knights.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You would have me fight them? Or give in to them? Make up your mind.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Do as you see fit. You always do.\" Beeah threw down her spoon and\
  \ left Rorr alone at the table. He dropped his own spoon and went outside into the\
  \ cold night air. The stars burned brightly above, and he made out the patterns\
  \ he had used for so long to navigate. The pointers showing the route northward\
  \ beckoned.</p> \n    <p>\"This is <i>my</i> farm,\" he said as he looked over darkened\
  \ fields. It mattered little to him whether the thief called himself a lord or a\
  \ brigand. Theft was theft, and he would not be chased away.</p> \n    <p>He went\
  \ to the barn, saw a shovel Fren had left out, and picked it up. The night's dew\
  \ would cause the tool to rust, but he didn't put it away inside the barn. Instead\
  \ he walked, slowly at first and then with longer strides, to the small hill a hundred\
  \ yards behind the house. At the summit he looked down at the grave. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>He had buried his brother here. Then he had married his brother's wife. Rorr\
  \ had not intended that, but he had come to love Beeah. He was less sure of her\
  \ affection for him. A widow with two young children faced a difficult life.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The past year had been good. Crops, improvement on barn and house, long\
  \ days and enjoyable nights—he thought enjoyable for them both, though he could\
  \ never tell.</p> \n    <p>This was his land. His <i>family's</i>.</p> \n    <p>Voices\
  \ carried up from downslope. Swords glinting in the starlight, two men made their\
  \ way toward his barn. Their words drifted up to him.</p> \n    <p>\"...burn him\
  \ out.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We should kill them all, as we did the others. Suvarian\
  \ would approve.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're a bloodthirsty one, Darrotte.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Rorr heard admiration, not denunciation, in that simple statement. He gripped\
  \ his shovel with both hands and hurried down the hill toward the barn.</p> \n \
  \   <p>The two soldiers heard his approach and greeted him with leveled swords.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"The farmer must be sleepwalking,\" Darrotte said. \"Why else would\
  \ he confront two of Lord Suvarian's warriors?\"</p> \n    <p>His companion chuckled.\
  \ \"We dare not tell the lord of this one's death. He would accuse us of drowning\
  \ kittens.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You have one chance only,\" Rorr said, squaring off\
  \ and lifting the shovel. \"Leave and I won't kill you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ho! A threat!\
  \ He won't hurt us!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I said I won't kill you,\" Rorr clarified.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Darrotte smiled. \"No, plowboy. You won't.\"</p> \n    <p>The soldier\
  \ with Darrotte rushed forward, sword lifted for the kill. Rorr saw flashes of light\
  \ and shadow, but the path of the sword was obvious. He swung the shovel, deflecting\
  \ the sword off its blade with a long blue spark. The impact staggered the soldier,\
  \ letting Rorr sidestep, then thrust out his foot.</p> \n    <p>The soldier crashed\
  \ to the ground and the cutting edge of the shovel descended, chopping into the\
  \ back of his exposed neck. The slight resistance of the yielding spine signaled\
  \ another death at Rorr's hand.</p> \n    <p>The farmer ducked, avoided Darrotte's\
  \ savage circular slash, then drove forward, arms circling the warrior's waist.\
  \ With a grunt, Rorr stood and squeezed. Hard. The sudden constriction caused Darrotte\
  \ to drop his sword.</p> \n    <p>Rorr tightened his hold around the small of the\
  \ man's back even more. Work-hardened muscles driven by fury powered his grip. The\
  \ sound of thunder drowned out the man's cries. Rorr felt something give. He relaxed,\
  \ dropped the still living man to the ground.</p> \n    <p>\"My back. You broke\
  \ it.\" Darrotte's voice was tight with pain and fear, but strangely calm. \"You\
  \ will die, farmer. My lord will kill you slowly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Rorr said,\
  \ picking up the shovel. \"He won't.\"</p> \n    <p>The edge of the blade rose and\
  \ fell.</p> \n    <p>Rorr stepped back and looked at the two dead men. They should\
  \ be buried, but to what purpose? Not to hide their deaths, certainly. Lord Suvarian\
  \ had sent them on a mission. When they didn't return, others would be dispatched.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With these deaths, Rorr realized, the fight was not over. It had just\
  \ begun.</p> \n    <br> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week</b>: Screams in the night in\
