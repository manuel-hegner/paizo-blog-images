  \ \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>In the pursuit of ancient secrets and unclaimed\
  \ treasures, the Pathfinder Society doesn't just make discoveries; it also makes\
  \ enemies. A cast of the campaign's greatest villains has conspired to take their\
  \ revenge against the Pathfinder, bringing war to the footstep of the great city\
  \ Absalom and chaos to the Inner Sea region. For years, factions within the Society\
  \ have championed their own agendas, fought for recognition, and accumulated resources.\
  \ At last they have a chance to prove themselves—an experience that could leave\
  \ these organizations changed forever in Season 9 of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild: the Year of Factions' Favor.</i></p> \n      <p><i>In the coming year,\
  \ Pathfinders have an opportunity to redeem souls, avert an invasion, uncover hidden\
  \ secrets below an infamous museum, and vanquish an ageless evil poised to take\
  \ control of the region's greatest minds. At the same time, players can use faction\
  \ resources to shut down an exploitative consortium, thwart a league of dangerous\
  \ villains, oust an infamous tyrant, and decide whether the ends justify the means\
  \ in the pursuit of justice. On top of this there are tombs to unseal, artifacts\
  \ to recover, and countless other adventures that await in this exciting season\
  \ that debuts at Gen Con 2017!</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     <p>One of the big questions I've heard over the past several years is \"Our\
  \ factions keep building connections and accumulating resources, but for what?\"\
  \ For some factions it's been pretty clear, such as the then-Taldor building up\
  \ steam to launch its own Army of Exploration during Season 5. For others, the payoffs\
  \ have been less obvious. For others still, it's been less a question of payoff\
  \ and more a matter of self-reflection; some of the factions have found themselves\
  \ pulled in multiple directions, whether that's multiple leaders vying for ideological\
  \ dominance or a leader and a faction growing steadily less suited for each other.\
  \ With Season 9, we're examining a bunch of these questions by giving many factions\
  \ a big events in which to flex their muscles, prove their worth (in-game and out),\
  \ and trigger some substantial changes on the world. Some factions are performing\
  \ some house cleaning, such as rooting out corruption or thwarting a growing menace\
  \ within their ranks. Others still are receiving smaller-scale stories tied to recurring\
  \ characters whose narratives spin into a much larger event. All in all, each of\
  \ the factions is getting something exciting to pursue over the course of Season\
  \ 9.</p> \n     <p>Although Season 9 had a placeholder name of \"Year of the Factions\"\
  \ for many months, the adventures are far from faction-exclusive. Characters of\
  \ all factions should be able to enjoy these scenarios, and Society leadership will\
  \ oversee the vast majority of these adventures—particularly ensuring that the Society's\
  \ interests aren't lost in the shuffle. Many of these adventures also involve the\
  \ same elements that we've come to expect from Pathfinder Society scenarios, such\
  \ as exploring ancient sites, uncovering hidden secrets, discovering rarely-traveled\
  \ lands, and dishing out a generous helping of RPG action. All the while, the factions\
  \ are jostling for the opportunity to lend their support and be awesome. For example,\
  \ if a noteworthy port is giving the Society trouble and keeping the PCs from going\
  \ on an adventure, you can bet the Exchange is chomping at the bit and saying, \"\
  Is this municipality using economic warfare to block you? Two can play at that game.\
  \ Hold my beer.\"</p> \n     <p>On top of that, we'll have a helping of unaffiliated\
  \ adventures, including a new higher-than-1st-level replayable adventure.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>The Adventure Path</h2> \n     <p>From Season 3 to Season 6 of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild, the campaign's overarching theme connected to one of\
  \ two Adventure Paths that would release that year. While this allowed the developers\
  \ to promote and borrow from the supporting literature released around that same\
  \ time for the Adventure Path, it also meant the organized play program was telling\
  \ less of its own story. Beginning in Season 7, we broke from that mold. While the\
  \ freedom to craft our own narrative is delightful, I've been missing the sense\
  \ of cross-product collaboration. The difference is that rather than wait for the\
  \ Adventure Path line to set the direction, I went straight to Crystal Frasier to\
  \ start planning things from the ground up.</p> \n     <p>Crystal's a delightful\
  \ co-conspirator, and I've known for a while that her desire to shake up Taldor\
  \ is even stronger than my own. When we put our heads together, we realized just\
  \ how well our two stories could work together, rather than one being subservient\
  \ to the other. After all, the Sovereign Court's been building up to something big\
  \ for quite some time, and overthrowing an irresponsible monarch in order to revitalize\
  \ one of our central nations sounds like just the right thing.</p> \n     <p>Is\
  \ the entirety of Season 9 about Taldor and the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\"\
  >War for the Crown</a>? Far from it, but we will have several scenarios that tell\
  \ a big Sovereign Court faction story and contribute to this Adventure Path.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</h2> \n     <p>There are more\
  \ stories we have in reserve than we have scenario slots to give them, and last\
  \ year we tried something a little new with the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/acg\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>: we began tying its story into that of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and cementing the PCs' role as Pathfinders.\
  \ For those of you interested in the ongoing Scarab Sages narrative and drama with\
  \ the Aspis Consortium, I encourage you to play <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season3\"\
  >Season 3: Season of Plundered Tombs</a>.</p> \n     <p>For the first time, we have\
  \ a shared season name between these two campaigns, so Season 4 is the Season of\
  \ Factions' Favor. Here we'll show another side of one of the ongoing plot threads,\
  \ giving players an opportunity to travel to rarely visited regions in order to\
  \ thwart an infamous, recurring villain who threatens to cast the Inner Sea region\
  \ into chaos. So when several upcoming Roleplaying Guild scenarios reference the\
  \ behind-the-scenes efforts of another group of Pathfinders, remember that you can\
  \ experience those stories with the Adventure Card Guild.</p> \n     <p>We're launching\
  \ the Season of Factions' Favor at Gen Con in August!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br>\
