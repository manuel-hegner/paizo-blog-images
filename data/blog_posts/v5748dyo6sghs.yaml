  \ Sanctioning, Spotlights, and Conventions!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ February 7, 2019</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">For the past month, the organized play team\
  \ worked on quite a few projects, from brainstorming what the Pathfinder Society\
  \ looks like going forward, to monthly scenarios, to convention planning, and more.\
  \ In a quest to provide as much content we can for Pathfinder Society players, the\
  \ developers pulled together another bout of sanctioning, this time focusing on\
  \ Seers of the Drowned City and War for the Crown. For the details, I turn to Michael\
  \ Sayre.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"<a href=\"/products/btpy9op2?Pathfinder-Module-Seers-of-the-Drowned-City\"\
  ><em>Seers of the Drowned City</em></a>. <a href=\"/warforthecrown\">War for the\
  \ Crown</a>. What do these two very different adventures have in common? One’s set\
  \ in Taldor, the other in the Sodden Lands, so that can’t be it. Maybe it’s the\
  \ fact that they are both now officially sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play,\
  \ complete with Chronicle sheets and sweet loot!</p> \n      <p>Paizo developers\
  \ Luis Loza and Eleanor Ferron handled the vast bulk of the sanctioning on <em>Seers\
  \ of the Drowned City</em>, so I’ll start by thanking them for all their hard work!\
  \ As an RPG Superstar entry in our modules line, Seers of the Drowned City has a\
  \ lot of really spectacular content. Rather than talk about what <em>Seers of the\
  \ Drowned City</em> is, I’m just going to say that this exciting adventure is going\
  \ to give you the opportunity to claim some of those amazing RPG Superstar finalist\
  \ magic items for your characters to wield during their adventures as part of the\
  \ Society.</p> \n      <p>War for the Crown is a robust and fairly unique adventure\
  \ path that includes a lot of really cool hooks, from chances to join Taldor’s nobility\
  \ to finding “relics,” unique magic items that grow with their wielder. Making those\
  \ relics work in an organized play environment and outside of the more structured\
  \ progression of an Adventure Path required a fair bit of discussion and experimentation,\
  \ but ultimately we felt like these items were an important part of experiencing\
  \ the Adventure Path and we didn’t want to relegate them to non-scaling items or\
  \ more “mundane” versions of themselves. As a result, we’ve created boons and options\
  \ to access these cool items in organized play and bring them with you from the\
  \ Adventure Path into the wider gaming environment. If magic items and weapons don’\
  t hold a ton of draw for you, never fear! You’ll also have the opportunity to join\
  \ one of Taldor’s noble houses, claiming a house name and all the benefits and prestige\
  \ that go along with it!”</p> \n      <p>You can find the chronicle sheets for the\
  \ adventures on their respective product pages and on the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional\"\
  >Additional Resources Page</a>.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Last fall, while at PaizoCon Asia-Pacific, I left a campaign coin in\
  \ the hands of a trusted messenger. I learned last month the recipient received\
  \ their coin, so this month I have the pleasure of announcing Paul Trani as that\
  \ unnamed beneficiary. Vivat!</p> \n     <p>During January, I visited MagFest in\
  \ Washington, D.C. and SCARAB in Columbia, South Carolina. While I did not have\
  \ the privilege to present any campaign coins while at MagFest, I enjoyed recognizing\
  \ several volunteers at SCARAB. The recipients’ spent hours working on growing their\
  \ areas as well as answering questions on a variety of platforms and running games\
  \ at large conventions. Stalwart supports of their communities, there would not\
  \ be as robust an organized play presence without their efforts.</p> \n     <p>Huge\
  \ huzzahs to the following!</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Paul Trani (New #805, Received\
  \ at PaizoCon AP 2018)</li> \n      <li>Amanda Plageman (New #806, Received at SCARAB\
  \ 2019)</li> \n      <li>Matt Polkowsky (New #807, Received at SCARAB 2019)</li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email\
  \ me at&nbsp;organizedplay@paizo.com&nbsp;with their name, location, and the reasons\
  \ you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please\
  \ include what events they may attend in 2019 so that we can either make awards\
  \ in person (preferred) or make arrangements for deliver.</p> \n     <h2>Stars and\
  \ Novas</h2> \n     <p>January started off with a bang of conventions/game days\
  \ and our gms spent hours offering games to their communities. Two GMs achieved\
  \ their 5th star this month. Reaching this milestone means they ran 150 games, of\
  \ which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as\
  \ run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach\
  \ 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time\
  \ and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games!</p> \n     <ul>\n     \
  \ <li>Joonas Frösen</li> \n      <li>Gary Tierney</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>Regarding\
  \ novas, our technical team is working on implementing a new method of tracking.\
  \ Investigating the code, we found an issue with how the system awards 4-stars when\
  \ gms reach their 100th GM credit. Before we could add the 5-nova process , we had\
  \ to stop and fix the issue. This issue is one of the top priorities and one we\
  \ hope to solve soon.</p> \n     <p>I’ll update more when I have news!</p> \n  \
  \   <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>Want to attend a convention in the next\
  \ few months? Check out the list below! The list includes all the event support\
  \ requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have\
  \ them submit a request for support or have them email me at [email]organizedplay@paizo.com[/email]\
  \ to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type\
  \ of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you\
  \ are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact\
  \ the local venture-officer for more information!</p> \n     <div class=\"callout-block\
