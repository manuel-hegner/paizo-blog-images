  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Lazzero\
  \ Dalvera, the eldest child of an officer in the Molthuni army and a priest of Abadar,\
  \ was born under an auspicious moon with a full head of bright red hair. Everyone\
  \ assumed he would earn respect and fame as an army officer like his mother. His\
  \ training began as soon as he could walk, and he attended the best military academies\
  \ to which his parents' money and connections could win him entrance.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>But the boy was not a strong child, and he lacked the temperament to hone\
  \ his martial skills. Instead, bullies perfected their own abilities at his expense,\
  \ both in formal sparring matches and between classes. Rather than retaliate with\
  \ violence, Lazzero kept tabs on the children who picked on him, recording their\
  \ secret transgressions—cheating, lying, petty theft, and other such behaviors common\
  \ among privileged youth. When he had amassed a sufficient amount of dirt on his\
  \ rivals, he ensured his teachers found it—anonymously of course—and laughed to\
  \ himself as the bullies got their just rewards for their wrongdoings.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Despite his skill at countering his rivals, Lazzero still didn't excel in\
  \ his martial studies, and by the age of 12 had washed out of every military academy\
  \ in which his parents had placed him. With their hopes in their son dashed, they\
  \ sent Lazzero to be trained by the Abadaran clergy, who counted his father among\
  \ their number; if he couldn't fulfill his destiny as a military commander, he would\
  \ do so in service to the Master of the First Vault.</p> \n     <p>In this endeavor\
  \ Lazzero finally succeeded, for he found prayer and contemplation came naturally\
  \ to him. Now among the top initiates in the Abadaran monastery, Lazzero took on\
  \ the role of bully and tormentor. He didn't need to study as much as his less studious\
  \ peers did, and could use the time not spent poring over religious texts making\
  \ life harder for those weaker than himself. In addition to overt hazing, Lazzero\
  \ maintained even more thorough records of his enemies' activities, which he took\
  \ pride in turning over to his superiors—publicly this time—so that they would receive\
  \ punishment for their transgressions.</p> \n     <p>While he couldn't ensure that\
  \ justice was served, Lazzero believed he was doing Abadar's work. How, he asked,\
  \ could his peers expect to teach Abadar's ways if they couldn't themselves follow\
  \ his laws? Was he not complicit in their wrongdoing if he allowed their crimes\
  \ to go unpunished? With such justifications, Lazzero convinced himself that what\
  \ he did was right, that it would set him apart from his so-called equals in the\
  \ eyes of his teachers and Abadar. He didn't recognize, however, that he had started\
  \ down a slippery slope that would ultimately lead to his fall from grace—for Lazzero\
  \ had begun to twist the law to meet his needs. The law was now a weapon he used\
  \ to keep those he didn't like beneath him.</p> \n     <p>By graduation, Lazzero\
  \ had distinguished himself as one of the most gifted acolytes, though he had made\
  \ no friends and garnered his share of enemies, many of his teachers among them.\
  \ For his apprenticeship, Lazzero traveled from Canorate to Cettigne—an inglorious\
  \ posting not befitting his high marks and honors. Lazzero was to serve as the acolyte\
  \ at the local temple along with a fellow graduate, a woman named Laureth. The pair\
  \ were highly competitive, each aspiring to rise in the ranks of the church quickly\
  \ and find a permanent placement in a more prestigious temple than Cettigne's.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Although Lazzero was the more talented cleric, Laureth was more favored,\
  \ receiving a prominent position within the temple and taking on greater responsibilities.\
  \ Unwilling to accept a position beneath his rival, Lazzero began plotting and spying\
  \ on Laureth in the hope of catching her falling short of the high standards expected\
  \ of Abadar's clergy. Laureth provided him no opportunities, however, behaving as\
  \ a paragon whom all faithful of Abadar should aspire to emulate.</p> \n     <p>Frustrated\
  \ and bitter, Lazzero prayed for a means of turning the law against Laureth, but\
  \ Abadar provided no guidance. Rather, a different voice echoed in the recesses\
  \ of Lazzero's mind, offering honeyed promises of providing all Lazzero could imagine\
  \ and more. It spoke of deceptions and lies as a means to an end, of the weak serving\
  \ the strong, and of always having the upper hand. Lazzero liked these words, and\
  \ though he knew he would no longer be true to Abadar if he were to follow them,\
  \ he did so anyway. He would see Laureth humiliated, no matter the cost.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Prompted by his mysterious new divine patron, Lazzero began committing\
  \ minor crimes himself and staging evidence to point toward Laureth. Fabricated\
  \ trade records for transactions under her jurisdiction, false testimony written\
  \ in her hand, and unbalanced ledgers month after month with no explanation into\
  \ the shortfall all built a case against his rival. Through subterfuge and sabotage,\
  \ Lazzero ensured that Laureth could never be solvent in the eyes of Abadar's code.\
  \ Best of all, he brought about her ruin through the very laws and regulations that\
  \ had for so long kept him from achieving his own lofty goals.</p> \n     <p>When\
  \ Laureth was convicted and sentenced to a life of servitude rather than clerical\
  \ service, Lazzero said a prayer of thanks to the Keeper of the First Vault, asking\
  \ for a blessing from his patron. Asmodeus answered in his stead, revealing himself\
  \ to have been the orchestrator of Lazzero's revenge upon Laureth. In that moment,\
  \ Lazzero knew that the path to his prophesied glory lay not in continuing in his\
  \ father's footsteps in the temple of Abadar. The Prince of Lies had shown him the\
  \ power of deceit and the means through which he could always ensure the law worked\
  \ in his favor.</p> \n     <p>That night, Lazzero left Cettigne, his vestments and\
  \ holy symbol left folded neatly on his modest cot, and headed south to Cheliax.\
  \ He forsook all his Abadaran vows and proclaimed his faith in Asmodeus, and sought\
  \ a church of his new patron. No longer did Lazzero worry that he would not achieve\
  \ greatness. He was content to enter an Asmodean temple as a lowly adept with faith\
  \ that his dedication would quickly raise him to the upper echelons of the church.\
  \ Thus did Lazzero begin his true journey—a quest for power and glory achieved by\
  \ following the Prince of Darkness.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Stay tuned\
