  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy New Year! Welcome to\
  \ the exciting reveal of our <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/Starfinder_FieldTest_3.pdf\"\
  ><b>third Starfinder Second Edition Field Test</b></a>.</p>\n      <p>It’s a new\
  \ year and a new Field Test release! The Field Tests include early, behind-the-scenes\
  \ previews of rules the Starfinder development team is playtesting internally in\
  \ preparation for the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> release later this year.\
  \ Our latest offering includes a preview of two ancestries appearing in the <em>Playtest\
  \ Rulebook</em>, as chosen by community vote. We’re excited to announce the winners\
  \ of that vote and the ancestries we’ll be featuring in today’s Field Test: the\
  \ android and vesk!</p>\n      <p><strong>Ancestries</strong> are the updated version\
  \ of what were known as <em>species</em> (also called <em>races</em> in older products)\
  \ in Starfinder First Edition. Ancestries are an important part of Starfinder’s\
  \ “cantina feel,” a term referring to the sci-fi trope of a spaceport bar packed\
  \ with all kinds of aliens. In this context, it means players get to create and\
  \ play as alien characters, and every planet or space station in the setting is\
  \ teeming with weird and wonderful sapient lifeforms that player characters might\
  \ interact with. Our goal is to keep the cantina open, so to speak, while we update\
  \ existing Starfinder ancestries to be compatible with the new edition.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p>Starfinder ancestries might look familiar to those of you who play Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition. Starfinder First Edition players might notice the new ancestries\
  \ are a bit of a departure from what you’re used to, but don’t panic! In Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition, each ancestry entry includes more content than the small sidebar\
  \ allotted to them in Starfinder First Edition.</p>\n      <p>In existing Starfinder\
  \ books, you’ll often see a species boiled down to a list of statistics with a handful\
  \ of abilities. Presenting species this way allowed the Starfinder team to introduce\
  \ many playable options right away, but there was little players could do to define\
  \ their character’s progression—via their species—beyond the initial selection.\
  \ In some specific cases, a species was so numerically superior that they were the\
  \ obvious “best” choices (we’re looking at you, SROs!). This was fantastic for certain\
  \ players but didn’t always reward players interested in exploring different options.\
  \ In the new edition of Starfinder, we want to create deeper meaning and context\
  \ for ancestries that you’re going to play or feature in your campaigns. This means\
  \ including more space for narrative lore related to each ancestry and information\
  \ on how it fits into the setting, as well as progression-based selections to help\
  \ further customize a character of that ancestry.</p>\n      <p>In addition to a\
  \ set of starting adjustments and abilities, ancestries in Second Edition get access\
  \ to ancestry feats. A character gains an ancestry feat at 1st level and then another\
  \ at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-level. Ancestry feats explore different paths within\
  \ each ancestry and grant more powerful abilities as a character progresses—allowing\
  \ you to customize your character beyond what was possible in Starfinder First Edition.\
  \ The team’s been experimenting with some interesting new options, like expanding\
  \ lashunta psychic powers or introducing a type of shirren that grows wings!</p>\n\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Today’s Field Test focuses on the constructed\
  \ androids and the reptilian vesk. Androids and vesk are both staple ancestries\
  \ in Starfinder, but each represents a very different part of the design spectrum.\
  \ Androids already exist in Pathfinder Second Edition (see <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5\"\
  >Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a>), so the Starfinder team updated the\
  \ ancestry to be compatible with the “ancient androids” who once walked lost Golarion\
  \ while creating new options to represent the changes in culture and technology\
  \ that separate the Starfinder setting from its distant past.</p>\n      <p>Meanwhile,\
  \ vesk is an ancestry that’s never appeared in Pathfinder Second Edition, giving\
  \ us a blank canvas to work with. Our intent was to keep the spirit of the First\
  \ Edition vesk while exploring new build types, from movement-based shenanigans\
  \ to different forms of natural melee attacks, and more.</p>\n      <p>The team\
  \ is excited to see what you think of our initial foray into ancestry design for\
  \ the new edition. We also <strong>strongly suggest </strong>you read the foreword\
  \ in this document, which may reveal some important news related to what ancestries\
  \ you can expect to see in the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> releasing this\
  \ summer!</p>\n      <p>Stay tuned for our upcoming Paizo Live! where members of\
  \ the Starfinder team will further discuss the Field Test, as well as give more\
  \ hints about what we have planned for the new edition of Starfinder.</p>\n    \
