  artist: "saying that our fans and friends are freakin' amazing. Seriously, folks—\
    when Tiffany started this whole costume contest thing two years ago by showing\
    \ up at the Gen Con booth dressed as a cleric of Desna, we were flat-out flabbergasted.\
    \ The fact that Pathfinder cosplay has grown by leaps and bounds since then—enough\
    \ to justify a full-fledged costume contest—is one of the greatest compliments\
    \ our game could receive. If you've never seen what goes on in our hotel rooms\
    \ after a long day of working the Gen Con booth (and I sincerely hope you haven't,\
    \ as we were told those door locks were secure), there's a whole lot of summer-camp-style\
    \ giggling that goes on late into the night as we marvel at all the folks we've\
    \ met that day. The costume contest only compounds that"
