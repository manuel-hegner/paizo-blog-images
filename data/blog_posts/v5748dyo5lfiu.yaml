  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Howard Andrew Jones</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: The\
  \ Wrong Target</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Lisette slowly brought her rifle to rest on a dirty shingle at the\
  \ apex of the roof, checking a final time to ensure the weapon's barrel was still\
  \ smudged. The afternoon sky might be overcast, but Lisette took no unnecessary\
  \ chances. There were enough necessary ones already. A sunbeam might break through\
  \ and glint off any undulled metal.</span></p> \n     <p>There on the civic building\
  \ roof, far above the narrow streets, she had a fine view of the bowman. He perched\
  \ in a small bell tower overlooking the central square, some fifteen feet below\
  \ and two hundred away. Like many structures in Oregent, the bell tower was tall\
  \ and slender. The folk of Oregent seemed to like high and cramped almost as much\
  \ as they liked their damnable bells.</p> \n     <p>The bowman stood in the shadows,\
  \ awaiting his own prey, so still he might have been a statue. His finely crafted\
  \ weapon of polished oak was just a sliver of darkness in his hand.</p> \n     <p>Lisette\
  \ ticked off the precautions she'd taken while waiting for a wave of anger to pass.\
  \ In her dark form-fitting clothes, black hair tied off in a ponytail, she'd be\
  \ unlikely to draw attention against the soot-blackened slate tiles, even once the\
  \ report of the gun echoed erratically off the roofs around her. Only a handful\
  \ of the city's buildings stretched as high as this, and few of them had windows\
  \ looking out toward her. So narrow were most of the town's avenues that anyone\
  \ on the street would have a difficult if not impossible task spotting her. The\
  \ bowman was fast, and she'd likely get only one shot. She hadn't had time to repair\
  \ her other rifle, and she'd have to be very lucky indeed to hit the bowman from\
  \ such a distance with either of her pistols. It was this rifle, or nothing. And\
  \ so she steadied herself, counting slowly down from ten while she lined up the\
  \ shot. </p> \n     <p>She spied the hawk in the same instant she heard its screech.\
  \ It dove into her peripheral vision from the upper right, a keening brown blur\
  \ with dark claws. She jerked reflexively even as her finger stroked the trigger.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The rifle kicked into her shoulder, and the acrid smell of gun\
  \ smoke hit her nostrils as the weapon bellowed. She cursed, knowing instinctively\
  \ that the shot was spoiled even as she saw the bowman slip into cover behind one\
  \ of the bell tower's structural supports. </p> \n     <p>His hawk pulled out of\
  \ its dive only a few feet away, and her frustration got the better of her. She\
  \ clasped the warm barrel of her rifle and swung out at the thing. She missed by\
  \ only a few inches, knowing a brief moment of satisfaction as the animal shrilled\
  \ in alarm.</p> \n     <p>But in striking out she overbalanced and slid down the\
  \ shingles. Her ire vanished in an upswell of panic. She flipped to her side, then\
  \ her back, scrabbling one-handed on the sharp tiles. She dared not release her\
  \ hold on the irreplaceable rifle, but she could find no purchase. The cobblestone\
  \ street lay a killing distance below, some sixty feet even beyond the twenty of\
  \ dormered roof. </p> \n     <p>Sheer luck sent her sliding toward an elaborate\
  \ gargoyle outcropping above a downspout. She grabbed the hideous creature's waist\
  \ with one hand like a desperate lover, then lay half entwined with it as she caught\
  \ her breath. </p> \n     <p>A trio of arrows arced up and over the roof. She shifted\
  \ desperately.</p> \n     <p>The damned bowman was so good that all three struck\
  \ the position where she'd just been lying. They hit the dirty shingles and clattered\
  \ away, one rolling past her to a windowsill beneath the dormer on her left. If\
  \ she'd remained where she'd been propped, any one of them would have skewered her.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The hawk, meanwhile, was circling back and calling out. Was the\
  \ vile creature actually signaling her position?</p> \n     <p>As if things weren't\
  \ bad enough, from somewhere below came the whistle of one of the Oregent city guard.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lisette cursed a blue streak, shouldered the rifle, and untangled herself\
  \ from the gargoyle enough to set one foot on the cracked stone sill to her left.\
  \ It seemed solid enough. This wasn't the window she'd entered by, but she didn't\
  \ wait to see if it was unlocked when another arrow chipped off one of the gargoyle's\
  \ ears.</p> \n     <p>One good kick from her black boot broke the peeling wood frame\
  \ and fragmented the window. She threw herself in after, hearing the clatter of\
  \ more arrows striking the frame even as she dropped into an empty storage room.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>She dashed into the empty attic hallway, diverted briefly to the\
  \ room cluttered with old chairs where she'd gained roof access. There she retrieved\
  \ Kerrigan's damaged rifle, her hat, and her shoulder bag. In moments she was hurrying\
  \ out the lower window she'd jimmied open, then out onto the roof of the annex.\
  \ She retraced her steps across the flat rooftop at a jog. She didn't see the hawk,\
  \ and the arrows had stopped, but she heard the whistle of the city watch, closer\
  \ now, and someone shouted, \"There's a woman running up there!\"</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ hadn't been one of her better days. She should have stuck with her original target\
  \ and worried about the bowman later.</p> \n     <p>A second whistle blew, and then\
  \ was promptly drowned by the ringing of some set of great brass bells. The clanging\
  \ was so thunderous that it set the roof below her shaking in sympathy. </p> \n\
  \     <p>She hated those bells. People in the city seemed so tuned to them that\
  \ they could tell which particular temple called them to worship, and knew which\
  \ factory called for shift change. Almost it seemed that people moved at the behest\
  \ of the bells rather than the other way around. A whole city governed by implacable\
  \ metal monsters.</p> \n     <p>She ran on, ducking around a spire and dropping\
  \ onto the slanted roof of an apartment building before leaping a narrow alley to\
  \ a two-story stone affair. This was the closest she'd yet gotten to the ground,\
  \ and she hurried a little farther before spotting a dark alleyway. Just what she\
  \ needed.</p> \n     <p>And then she saw that the space was occupied. Three men\
  \ were turned away from her toward the alley's mouth, facing a stout figure beside\
  \ a youth lying in a widening pool of blood. The trio advanced menacingly on the\
  \ short one. She grimaced as she knelt and scanned the surrounding rooftops. This\
  \ looked like the best way down anywhere nearby and she'd have to get to the street\
  \ to lay low. The depressingly efficient Oregent guards would already be combing\
  \ the rooftops.</p> \n     <p>And so, panting and tired, she swung to the coping\
  \ and dropped. </p> \n     <p>She felt the shock of the twelve-foot fall. In other\
  \ circumstances, she would have absorbed it with a roll, but she had two rifles\
  \ slung over her shoulder. One of the three bravos must have heard her, and he turned,\
  \ lifting a sword.</p> \n     <p>She'd talked her way out of plenty of tough scrapes,\
  \ but this was no time for niceties. She shot the man point-blank with one pistol\
  \ and was pulling the second free even before he crumpled. His mouth opened, and\
  \ he might have screamed, but it was difficult to hear over the reverberating crack\
  \ of the powder.</p> \n     <p>The second of the bravos turned from his target—\
  a blond dwarf armed with an axe—and she fired a second time. In the confined space\
  \ the blast echoed like thunder, but when this man dropped, his shrieks outlasted\
  \ the echo.</p> \n     <p>Lisette cursed again. This wasn't what she needed. The\
  \ whole job had been rotten from the beginning. She'd warned Kerrigan...</p> \n\
  \     <p>There was no time for that.</p> \n     <p>The last assailant seemed to\
  \ think his best option was to simply run clear, but the dwarf caught him with the\
  \ axe as he dashed past and brought him down with a spray of blood. It was a swift,\
  \ efficient cut, and left the dying man no air with which to cry out. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>Lisette had both pistols back through her sash now, and considered the dwarf\
  \ while she pointed her second rifle at him—Kerrigan's rifle. Hopefully the dwarf\
  \ wouldn't notice the damaged hammer, or know what it meant. Both ignored the third\
  \ thug moaning in an ever-widening stream of his own blood. </p> \n     <p>The dwarf\
  \ proved a rugged, plain fellow with a weathered leather jerkin. There was no missing\
  \ the battle lust in his eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Do I have to fight past you, too?\"\
  \ Lisette asked.</p> \n     <p>\"I suppose I should thank you for the assist.\"\
  \ His accent was eastern. He frowned as the whistle of a watchman sounded nearby.\
  \ From his strained expression, she suddenly knew that he was as leery of the law\
  \ as she was. Was he an outlaw? A bandit? Someone from a local gang?</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"You can thank me by getting me into hiding.\" If the guards detained her,\
  \ even for a little while, she'd lose her chance at the target. Both targets.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The stout dwarf grunted, then lowered the axe to snatch up a heavy-looking\
  \ bag lying beside the dead boy at the alley's mouth—a fallen ally? He considered\
  \ her warily as it clanked with the unmistakable jangle of coins. \"Come on.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He walked at such speed it was almost a jog, and she shouldered the\
  \ rifle to fall in beside him. They'd just made it down the winding lane across\
  \ the street when the alarm whistles shrilled more vehemently. The guards were close.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The dwarf sped up to a full run, and she loped silently at his\
  \ side. She could easily outpace him, but there was no point—not if he really did\
  \ know the way to a safe house. He ducked suddenly down an even narrower passageway\
  \ between an older stone building and a newer brick one, this gap so thin they had\
  \ to sidle sideways. Twenty paces in, just a few feet before it dead-ended, a blackened\
  \ rope hung against the grimy bricks. From the alley opening it was completely invisible,\
  \ indistinguishable from dirty building in the darkness. </p> \n     <p>Clever.\
  \ The dwarf shoved his bloody axe into its holster and clambered up. Mostly he used\
  \ his arms, but he pushed off the wall with his boots and was soon up to the blank\
  \ face of the second floor. </p> \n     <p>Lisette didn't think there was time to\
  \ waste, so she scaled quickly, using opposing walls for leverage. It was no simple\
  \ feat, but she thought nothing of it until the dwarf reached a third-floor window\
  \ and noticed her beside him. His eyes widened in surprise, and he went into the\
  \ darkened opening without comment.</p> \n     <p>She slipped in immediately after,\
  \ reaching back to steady the rope lest its movement catch attention. She then considered\
  \ the room, alert for ambush.</p> \n     <p>There was no one else inside the cramped\
  \ and musty place. The dwarf settled on a bench, breathing heavily through his mouth,\
  \ presumably trying to make as little noise as possible for him. She heard footsteps\
  \ rush past the main portion of the alley.</p> \n     <p>From somewhere below came\
  \ a strain of fiddle and a woman's laughter, high and a little unnatural. They were\
  \ above one of Oregent's many taverns, she realized. \"What—\" she started to ask,\
  \ and then was drowned out by the pealing gongs of a nearby clutch of bells. Had\
  \ it been another quarter hour already, or was this some other interval of time\
  \ being marked?</p> \n     <p>The dwarf scowled throughout the two-minute long episode.\
  \ She took the time to inspect the rest of the room. The bedframe and the dirty\
  \ mattress. The warped floorboards. The single dresser with its sagging left leg.\
  \ There was a candle sitting upon this last, but she didn't move to light it. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I hate those bells,\" the dwarf muttered when the sound had finally\
  \ ebbed.</p> \n     <p>Lisette smiled wryly. \"What's that batch ringing about?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I think another mining shift has ended,\" the dwarf said, though\
  \ he didn't sound certain.</p> \n     <p>\"You're not a native, I take it.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"No,\" the dwarf agreed. \"And neither are you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Right. But it looks to me like you have some business connections I don't.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Is that so?\" The dwarf listened at the open window, his head in profile\
  \ so he could also watch Lisette. </p> \n     <p>She heard a whistle, but it was\
  \ now quite far away. During the ringing she'd planned her next move, and she acted\
  \ on it now. \"I'm thinking you owe me a favor.\"</p> \n     <p>The dwarf snorted.\
  \ \"Way I see it, the favor's already paid. You weren't out to save me. You were\
  \ on the run and dropped in on the middle of the fight.\"</p> \n     <p>He was shrewder\
  \ than he looked. \"Fair enough. But, as you're a businessman, let's say I've got\
  \ a proposition for you.\"</p> \n     <p> \"Let's say you do,\" the dwarf told her\
  \ cautiously. \"There's money?\"</p> \n     <p>\"A little. I don't need that big\
  \ a favor.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What kind of favor?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm looking for\
  \ someone.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What makes you think I'd know her?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  It's a him. He might travel in circles familiar to you.\"</p> \n     <p>The stout\
  \ outlaw kept his tone flat. \"What circles are those?\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette snorted.\
  \ \"Don't play games, dwarf.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's Karag.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br>Karag likely has ties to the underground—but then, he is a dwarf.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>\"Alright, Karag. It's easy to see you're no more a friend\
  \ of the city watch than I am. I'm guessing that bag of coins isn't something you'd\
  \ want to be caught with.\"</p> \n     <p>He glanced down at the bag at his feet.\
  \ \"Not much of a guess.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm not sure what you were doing, and\
  \ I really don't care. I need to find someone. And I'll bet your boss knows someone\
  \ who can help me. I'll pay you both. But the man I'm after is going to slip away\
  \ if I don't move fast.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How much money?\"</p> \n     <p>\"For\
  \ some introductions? Five sails for you. If your boss knows the way, I'll cut him\
  \ in for more.\"</p> \n     <p>The dwarf shook his head. \"That's pretty cheap.\
  \ Look, lady, let me offer you some advice: If you go poking under the wrong rocks\
  \ in Oregent, you'll end up dead. You don't just wander in and start asking around.\
  \ It gets people suspicious. And you start throwing around gold, they might just\
  \ knife you to take it all.\"</p> \n     <p>\"They can try,\" Lisette said softly.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>He eyed her sidelong. \"What do you want this guy for?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I'm delivering flowers. What do you think?\"</p> \n     <p>Karag grunted.\
  \ \"What'd he do to you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"He killed a friend.\"</p> \n     <p>At\
  \ this, Karag nodded. He pointed to her waist. At the pistols, she realized as he\
  \ spoke. \"You a witch?\"</p> \n     <p>She forced back a laugh. \"No.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Sorceress?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What are you, then?\"\
  \ he asked with a truculent growl.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm just a lady hunting a killer,\
  \ and I'm willing to pay for information.\"</p> \n     <p>Karag grunted again. \"\
  Come on, then. I need to report to Belvar in any case. My advice, keep things simple.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She smiled thinly. \"Oh, I always do.\"</p> \n     <p></p> \n   \
