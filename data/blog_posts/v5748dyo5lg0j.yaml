  \ L. Sutter is the Managing Editor for Paizo Publishing and a co-creator of the\
  \ Pathfinder campaign setting. In addition to campaign setting books like Distant\
  \ Worlds and City of Strangers, he is the author of the novels Death's Heretic and\
  \ The Redemption Engine, the former of which was ranked #3 on Barnes &amp; Noble's\
  \ list of the Best Fantasy Releases of 2011, as well as declared a finalist for\
  \ both the Compton Crook Award for Best First Novel and an Origins Award. He's published\
  \ short stories in numerous magazines and anthologies, including the #1 Amazon bestseller\
  \ Machine of Death, and edited the anthology Before They Were Giants which pairs\
  \ the first published short stories of speculative fiction luminaries with new interviews\
  \ and writing advice from the authors themselves.</span></p> \n     <p>We sat down\
  \ with James to ask some questions about his new Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy94r3\">The Redemption Engine</a>, a sequel to 2011's <a href=\"/products/btpy8oda\"\
  >Death's Heretic</a>.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>In your own words, what's\
  \ The Redemption Engine about?</h2> \n      <p>Plot-wise, it's all about Salim Ghadafar,\
  \ a former priest-hunter from Rahadoum's Pure Legion who through some bad decisions\
  \ ends up working for Pharasma. (I've always been fascinated by the concept of atheism\
  \ in a world where gods are real, so forcing an atheist to work directly for a goddess\
  \ seemed like a fun chance to explore that.) In this book, Salim's sent to Kaer\
  \ Maga because someone in the city has been killing evil people and then stealing\
  \ their souls, which would rightfully belong to Hell. It's up to Salim to unravel\
  \ the mystery and put an end to it, but the scope just keeps getting bigger, and\
  \ he ends up having to recruit a whole team of unusual folks to help him.</p> \n\
  \      <p>At a more metaphysical level, where Death's Heretic was all about exploring\
  \ the idea of rejecting gods you know are real, this one's more about the idea of\
  \ moral absolutes, and all the weirdness that arises when you start saying that\
  \ creatures can have absolute morality. Devils are evil, but does that mean that\
  \ breaking planar law to steal from them is okay? As you might imagine from the\
  \ book's title, there's a lot in here about the nature of salvation, and whether\
  \ it's always a good thing.</p> \n      <h2>Without spoilers, what was your favorite\
  \ aspect of this novel? What was the most fun part to write?</h2> \n      <p>I wrote\
  \ the entire concluding chapter of the book (and it's a big one) in a single session,\
  \ and it was as exhilarating as it was exhausting. At that point, I'd been waiting\
  \ to write that scene for a whole year. (I make myself write scenes in order to\
  \ keep myself from getting lazy.) Trying to affect yourself viscerally with your\
  \ own writing is like trying to tickle yourself, but with both novels, I've been\
  \ lucky enough to get at least one scene that emotionally affects me, and it gives\
  \ me great hope that it'll do the same to other readers!</p> \n      <p>Going along\
  \ with that, while I got to play with a lot of awesome toys in this one, I think\
  \ my favorite aspect was probably Bors and Roshad, the warriors of the Iridian Fold\
  \ who end up acting as Salim's sidekicks. I introduced the mysterious group way\
  \ back in my first descriptions of Kaer Maga, and it was time to finally let the\
  \ cat out of the bag and explain what they're all about. Plus, I feel like I haven't\
  \ seen a lot of married gay couples in RPG novels, and I wanted to mix things up\
  \ a bit.</p> \n      <h2>Who's your favorite character and why?</h2> \n      <p>I\
  \ know I just said Bors and Roshad, but while they gave me a chance to reveal some\
  \ fun things, my favorite character is Gav, the street kid I invented way back in\
  \ the journal of Pathfinder Adventure Path #3. He's a fast-talking philosopher-scamp,\
  \ and I could happily spend days writing his patter. (You can see some examples\
  \ in the quotes introducing each chapter of City of Strangers.)</p> \n      <p>Strangely\
  \ enough, when I originally began the outline, Gav wasn't in it. As soon as I mentioned\
  \ to Wes Schneider that I was pitching a Kaer Maga novel, though, his first question\
  \ was how Gav was involved. And I realized instantly that he was right—Kaer Maga\
  \ without Gav just wouldn't be the same. Even once I started writing the book, Gav\
  \ kept creeping into scenes I hadn't cast him in. He's like that.</p> \n      <h2>What\
  \ drew you to this particular region of Golarion as the setting for a novel?</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Shameless favoritism. Actually, it was Erik Mona who pointed me toward\
  \ it: I was trying to figure out where to set my next book, and he noted that Kaer\
  \ Maga and all its weirdness—bloatmages, sweettalkers, caulborn, troll augurs—might\
  \ be the part of Golarion that I'm most associated with. Why not set the novel there?\
  \ And just like Wes, he was absolutely right—it was a blast to go back and play\
  \ in that sandbox again.</p> \n      <h2>What's your favorite part of Golarion that\
  \ you haven't written about yet?</h2> \n      <p>One of the best things about this\
  \ job is that if you're excited enough about something, it's likely you'll get to\
  \ write about it at some point. But something I hope to write more about is the\
  \ First World—as with Golarion's solar system, I had the honor of writing that plane's\
  \ original gazetteer and creating most of the Eldest, and I'd dearly love to go\
  \ back and flesh things out in greater detail.</p> \n      <h2>How did you first\
  \ get into writing?</h2> \n      <p>I had always wanted to be a writer, but it wasn't\
  \ until college that a creative writing professor suggested I try selling my writing.\
  \ To my delight, the University of Washington Daily hired me after one article,\
  \ and the first short story I sent out got picked up by a local fiction journal.\
  \ Thus encouraged, I spent the rest of college working as a journalist, writing\
  \ (and occasionally even publishing) fiction, and even editing the school's short-lived\
  \ but infamously successful erotica journal.</p> \n      <p>After college, however,\
  \ journalism started to lose a lot of its charm. It turned out that gonzo adventure\
  \ assignments and articles about sex and rock and roll (I didn't know much about\
  \ drugs) played really well on college campuses, and not so well at the sleepy suburban\
  \ newspapers that were willing to hire me. Since I cared way more about writing\
  \ than reporting, I started looking around for somewhere that wasn't so darn concerned\
  \ with facts. And that's when I found Paizo.</p> \n      <p><a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldhf?Paizo-Publishings-10th-Anniversary\"\
  >I've already written about how I clawed my way into a job here</a>, but suffice\
  \ to say that folks like Wes, Erik, Jacobs, and the rest were incredibly gracious\
  \ in teaching a neophyte author everything they knew about the business, and in\
  \ giving me a chance to prove myself. A good community is a writer's greatest weapon.</p>\

  \      <h2>Any advice for aspiring writers?</h2> \n      <p>Lots! You can find some\
  \ of it collected on the nonfiction page of <a href=\"http://jameslsutter.com\"\
  >my website</a> or by following me on Twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jameslsutter\"\
  >@jameslsutter</a>, but the most important thing is to write things and try to sell\
  \ them. A quick Google search will tell you the basics about the submission business—\
  the hard part is putting yourself out there, offering your stories or services and\
  \ getting rejected time and again. It's a rite of passage that never ends, but if\
  \ you keep at it, always stretching for that publication that's just slightly out\
  \ of your reach, you'll make it. In this business, tenacity trumps talent every\
  \ time.</p> \n      <h2>What's an interesting bit of trivia that our readers might\
  \ not know about you?</h2> \n      <p>I'm a huge fan of group living. My wife and\
  \ I currently live in a shared house with half a dozen other people, a dog, and\
  \ a fully functional death ray.</p> \n      <h2>Last but not least: if you had only\
  \ 30 seconds to convince someone to read this particular novel, what would your\
  \ pitch be?</h2> \n      <p>Is it wrong to steal from the Devil? What would it mean\
  \ to be an atheist in a world where gods are real? Do you like Heaven, Hell, and\
  \ bizarre monsters and cultures? If so, this is the book for you!</p> \n     </blockquote>\
