  \ Pathfinder is Born</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 26, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p>With <a href=\"http://www.originsgamefair.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Origins</a>\
  \ kicking off today, the clatter of dice is deafening. The roar of gaming swells\
  \ in my heart. Thousands of like-minded gamers gather here in Columbus under one\
  \ banner to draw steel, hurl eldritch might, call down the fury of the gods, and\
  \ maybe pick a pocket or two. </p> \n   <p>And this is just the beginning. In only\
  \ a few short weeks, Gen Con shall be upon us, as well as the inauguration of Season\
  \ 0 of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>. The\
  \ torches of the Pathfinder Lodge Hall shall blaze to life and hundreds of heroes,\
  \ scoundrels and vagabonds will gather to begin their epic adventures. Their legends\
  \ may change the face of Golarion. </p> \n   <p>But first, they have to be born\
  \ of your wild imaginations. Creating a character for Pathfinder Society is not\
  \ much different from creating a PC for your regular home campaign, with a few minor\
  \ alterations. Here's a quick preview of what you'll see in the Pathfinder Society's\
  \ Player's Guide for Season 0:</p> \n   <p><b>Faction:</b> Every Faction has its\
  \ own unique history, culture, style and specialty. Each has their own modus operandi\
  \ in the ongoing shadow war for control of Absalom, and each offers the Pathfinders\
  \ in their service different boons. Choosing your Faction is as important as choosing\
  \ your character class or race; it defines your character in the campaign, and ties\
  \ your Pathfinder to one particular nation's destiny. Before you choose your Faction,\
  \ peruse each carefully and pick the most exciting one. Once this choice is made,\
  \ it cannot be changed until the end of Season 0 (after next year's Origins in June\
  \ of 2009), so choose wisely. </p> \n   <p>Are you born and bred in Cheliax and\
  \ a firm devotee to the cause of Asmodeus, or are you a former slave of the Chelish\
  \ regime who escaped to Andoran and now you serve your adopted homeland in their\
  \ struggle for freedom? You don't necessarily have to be from a nation to be a member\
  \ of their faction (for example you may play an Ulfen barbarian from the Land of\
  \ the Linnorm Kings in the service of Taldor's empire). The majority of loyal faction\
  \ members are most likely patriots born and raised in their homeland with family\
  \ ties and at least some sense of nationalism, but anything is possible.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Race and Class:</b> All of the core races and classes in the <i>PHB</i>\
  \ are available in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Yes, even gnomes. </p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Abilities:</b> In Pathfinder Society Organized Play, all characters are\
  \ created equal. No dice are used to generate your Pathfinder. Instead, every character's\
  \ ability scores are generated using a point-buy system similar to the one featured\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder RPG</a> Alpha Release. You shall\
  \ tailor your PC's abilities to best suit your vision of who they are, and to best\
  \ fulfill your favorite tactical combinations.</p> \n   <p><b>Skills:</b> All of\
  \ the skills in the <i>PHB</i> are available to your characterâ€”even the Craft and\
  \ Profession skills. </p> \n   <p><b>Feats:</b> All of the Feats in the <i>PHB</i>\
  \ are available to your PC with one notable exception: Item creation does not exist\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, therefore the item creation feats are not\
  \ available. In place of Scribe Scroll at first level, wizard PCs may choose Spell\
  \ Focus instead.</p> \n   <p>In addition to the feats in the <i>PHB</i>, characters\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play also have access to special Faction Feats\
  \ that further tie them to their nation of choice and offer them unique abilities\
  \ catering to the flavor of these diverse cultures. </p> \n   <p><b>Alignment:</b>\
  \ You cannot play an evil character in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Do not\
  \ pass go, do not collect 200 gp. All good and neutral alignments are allowed though\
  \ (EXCEPT NEUTRAL EVIL... nice try, buddy). </p> \n   <p><b>Character Background,\
  \ Physical Features, and Beliefs:</b> Above we've crafted the mechanical skeleton\
  \ of your character. Now it's time to flesh them out. Let's give your character\
  \ some personality and some fun quirks to roleplay. Make them a real person with\
  \ motivations, distinctive physical and emotional traits, and a unique and interesting\
  \ personal history. </p> \n   <p><b>Items and Equipment:</b> After completing all\
  \ of the above, your Pathfinder is alive! He or she is a whole person dedicated\
  \ to a faction hailing from a distinct racial background, with a chosen class, abilities,\
  \ skills, and feats, not to mention a rich character background, distinctive physical\
  \ traits and personal beliefs. The only thing missing is their clothes. That's right.\
  \ Your character is naked right now! They are also completely unarmed and have no\
  \ food. </p> \n   <p>Every character in Pathfinder Society Organized Play begins\
  \ the campaign with 150 gp of spending cash. All the armor, weapons and equipment\
  \ in Chapter Seven of the <i>PHB</i> are available for purchase as well as a bevy\
  \ of items and special weapons from the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ic\">Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting hardcover</a>. (Sorry, folks, no firearms for now.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Is your appetite suitably whetted? Have any character ideas yet? If so,\
  \ drop by the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/general\"\
  >messageboards</a> and tell us all about your Pathfinder. No, really, <i>tell</i>\
  \ us about your character! I, for one, can't wait to meet them. See you at Gen Con.\
  \ You bring the dice, I'll bring the Mountain Dew. </p> \n   <p>Nicolas Logue<br>\
