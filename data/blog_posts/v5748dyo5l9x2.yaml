  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, October 22, 2008</p> \n    <p>There were a\
  \ fair number of rules that had to be cut from the Beta Playtest Edition of the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i></a>.\
  \ Prestige classes were one of the unfortunate casualties. Fortunately, along with\
  \ the magic of the Internet, we can release these rules to you for playtesting and\
  \ review. This document will be available on Monday, October 27th from paizo.com,\
  \ but in anticipation, we thought we might give you a sneak peak at one of the classes\
  \ in the document. Take a look at some of these new powers for the duelist prestige\
  \ class.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Precise Strike (Ex): </b>A duelist\
  \ gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon,\
  \ adding her duelist level to her damage roll.</p> \n     <p>When making a precise\
  \ strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield.\
  \ A duelist's precise strike only works against creatures with discernible anatomies.\
  \ Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to a precise strike,\
  \ and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects\
  \ a creature from a precise strike.</p> \n     <p><b>Parry (Ex): </b>At 2nd level,\
  \ a duelist learns to parry the attacks of other creatures, causing them to miss.\
  \ Whenever the duelist takes a full attack action with a light or one-handed piercing\
  \ weapon, she can elect not to take one of her attacks. At any time before her next\
  \ turn she can attempt to parry an attack against her or an adjacent ally as an\
  \ immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using\
  \ the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous action.\
  \ If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack\
  \ automatically misses. For each size category the attacking creature is larger\
  \ than the duelist, the duelist takes a –4 penalty on her attack roll. The duelist\
  \ also takes a –4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent\
  \ ally. The duelist must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced,\
  \ but before the roll is made.</p> \n     <p><b>Riposte (Ex): </b>At 5th level,\
  \ a duelist can make an attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack\
  \ she successfully parries, so long as the creature is within reach.</p> \n    \
  \ <p><b>No Retreat (Ex): </b>At 9th level, enemies adjacent to the duelist that\
  \ take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from the duelist.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Make sure to stop by on Monday to grab this free\
  \ pdf to add to your game. The playtest period for these rules begins on November\
  \ 24th and will run through December 7th.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p>\
