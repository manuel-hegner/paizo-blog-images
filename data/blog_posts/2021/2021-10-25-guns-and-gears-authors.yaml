              <p>Wow, as of the time I’m writing this the last couple weeks have been eventful, to say the least. One event that would be an absolute shame to overlook is this, the&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>&nbsp;author blog! Below are an array of the freelancers who helped make&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>&nbsp;possible. I want to note not everyone involved had the time to write or submit an introduction for themselves, so please keep an eye on the credits of the final book to see everyone else who helped make this project possible!</p>
              <p>I do want to call special attention to one freelancer who is both an incredibly strong author and designer and who won’t get the recognition she deserves unless I use this opportunity to give it her but let me open with a bit of a story. In publishing, sometimes things go wrong—this is especially true when you’re undertaking back-to-back ambitious projects like&nbsp;<em>Secrets of Magic</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>&nbsp;that are looking to use new and unique templates or delivery methods for conveying information. Without getting too lost in the weeds, let me just note that basically all those things that can go wrong did go wrong at some point or another over the course of this project. One result of this was that we had to reimagine the presentation of quite a few elements in&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>&nbsp;during development.</p>
              <p>Now, Jessica Redekop was absolute dynamite during this project. She provided insights and assistance to less experienced authors and designers, was an unfailing voice of support and positivity, and turned over some incredibly cool design work. Sadly,&nbsp;<em>none</em>&nbsp;of that work appears in&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>. Through no fault of her own, all of Jessica’s work ended up being in sections of the book that were heavily reworked in ways that required us to cut her submissions. I’ve done what I can to make sure at least some of those submissions make their way into other books so you’ll still get to see the incredible work Jess did, but I want to take this moment to note that even though none of her words appear in this book and she is not credited as a writer, Jess is very much a part of the team that made&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>&nbsp;the (in my humble opinion) incredible book it is.</p>
              <p>With that out of the&nbsp;<em>way</em>, this blog is already way longer than it’s probably supposed to be, so I’m going to shut my digital mouth and let my amazing freelancers speak for themselves!</p>

              <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3>
              <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full-time freelance author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo, including&nbsp;<em>Secrets of Magic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tech Revolution</em>, “The Gilded Cage,” and&nbsp;<em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>,&nbsp;<em>Book of the Dead</em>,&nbsp;<em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Galactic Magic</em>!</p>
              <p>I wrote a wide range of material for&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, including feats, vehicles, cursed and intelligent guns, a bunch of fun gizmos, and (my personal favorite) the dwarves of Dongun Hold. Contributing to this project was a blast and I hope it inspires.</p>

              <p>I'm Mark Seifter, Paizo's design manager and one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.</p>
              <p>In&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, I wrote a large number of different pieces, often working together with Mike on those sections he mentioned. Whenever things got rocky, I wrote more. But my biggest contribution was the inventor class. I hope you find the class to be exciting to play and brimming with the kind of reckless inventor personality that inspires you to make unforgettable characters!</p>

              <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling</h3>
              <p>Hey all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I’ve been freelancing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for a few years now. I’ve always had a fondness for the steampunk/clockwork type of aesthetic, so when I was asked if I wanted to work on Guns &amp; Gears, my answer was “definitely!” I did several of the class options for the book, and I hope people enjoy playing them! My full list of credits is on my website,&nbsp;<a href="http://klspeedling.com/">klspeedling.com</a>, along with an on-again, off-again NPC creation blog, and you can find me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a>.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Andrew White</h3>
              <p>Andrew White (he/him) is the lead front-end developer on paizo.com and an occasional freelance contributor to such works as the&nbsp;<em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bestiary 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Book of the Dead</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tech Revolution</em>,&nbsp;<em>and Drift Crisis</em>. For&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, he created a bunch of gun talismans: single-use item enhancements for firearms that provide temporary benefits including but not limited to increasing their range, changing their damage type, and hurling tiny shrieking skulls to terrify their targets. His first published credit was a gigantic fey scallop that loved rap battling and puppet shows, and his most recent is a one-shot adventure about a fast-talking swarm of insects, misanthropic spider robot, jaded mercenary squid, and magical hacker who is also a telepathic bear teaming up to rob a space train together. He has a Twitter where he mostly just retweets his more eloquent colleagues at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/plaguecontrol">@plaguecontrol</a>.</p>
