  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Look, I'm tired of trying to be the perfect\
  \ hero. Ever since I started offering up my services—and working with a never-ending\
  \ succession of random strangers—I've done the right thing, put others first, and\
  \ bit my tongue, all without asking anything in return. And sure, the villagers\
  \ I've saved have been grateful, and that's... nice. But whoever said virtue is\
  \ its own reward never had to pay a bar tab. And hey, I do a lot of good in this\
  \ world, from undoing ancient curses to putting down the world-ending-threat du\
  \ jour, so why shouldn't I let loose on occasion? To be clear, I'm not talking about\
  \ embracing some sort of chaotic neutrality in the name of being a jerk—I just want\
  \ to be myself and get my due.</p> \n     <p>Lucky for me, I found this book, and\
  \ it's full of antiheroes: folks who worry less about sanctimonious social norms\
  \ and focus instead on turning their flaws into fortes. This is the kind of heroism\
  \ I can get behind; to hell with all that dour do-goodery. Take the vindictive bastard,\
  \ an ex-paladin archetype, for example: she lives up to the label (given to so many\
  \ exes) by using her vindictive smite against those who've hurt her friends. Or\
  \ the blatherskite, a gunslinger who runs away from danger faster than he runs his\
  \ mouth—and that's saying something.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"\

  \  </div> \n     <p>Now, some of these antiheroes had it real bad in the past, giving\
  \ them good reason to approach this whole adventuring thing with a chip on their\
  \ shoulders. There's a multitude of backgrounds that result in the traits and drawbacks\
  \ they carry with them today. Some were criminals, some get a raw deal in their\
  \ dealins with a religion or some other group, and some have backgrounds that're\
  \ downright tragic. But even these sad sacks can transform their personal tragedy\
  \ into something productive (if unconventional): there are spiritualists whose phantoms\
  \ draw their abilities from lifelong suffering, and there are bloodragers who summon\
  \ the strength of a martyred ancestor to become an embodiment of righteous wrath.</p>\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Forrest Imel</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of\
  \ course, treading too far down the path less traveled can get you in a heap of\
  \ trouble. Before you know it, you forget why you're bending rules and start breaking\
  \ them just for the fun of it, leaving yourself susceptible to corruption. Sure,\
  \ you might get better at forging evidence and using forbidden magic, but you'll\
  \ eventually end up overwhelmed by hate and turning on your closest allies. Happens\
  \ all the time.</p> \n     <p>On the other hand, a lot of great tactics and tools\
  \ are opened up to those who put aside the idea of a fair fight. Even when losing\
  \ a brawl, you can accomplish all kinds of feats, like using your bloodied visage\
  \ to sicken your enemies or taking someone down with you when you're tripped. And\
  \ a swig from a <i>vial of reckless courage </i>will give you the temporary guts\
  \ needed to face down the most horrific monsters. Or you can throw a portable hive\
  \ at your enemies and let them explain a fair fight to a wasp swarm.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>After seeing all the options available in this book, I think I've made up my\
  \ mind—it's the antihero's life for me! But I'll tell you what: I leave it to fate\
  \ to decide. I'll flip this coin, and if it comes up Desna, I'll start living life\
  \ in the gray area between right and fun. Otherwise, it's the straight and narrow\
  \ for me, I promise.</p> \n     <p>Here goes... </p> \n     <blockquote> \n    \

  \ item associated with the goddess of luck, a Desna's coin confers on its owner\
  \ an uncanny ability to fortuitously avoid sudden threats. As a result, its bearer\
  \ gains a +2 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\"\
