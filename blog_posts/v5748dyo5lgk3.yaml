  \ Heroes Paint Masters</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 3, 2014</p> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I've already\
  \ spoken at length about our plans for the monthly series of Iconic Heroes Boxed\
  \ Sets that begin in January. I've mentioned that WizKids intends to produce these\
  \ figures at the highest possible standards, with premium sculpts and paint jobs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I've even shown digital sculpts of some of the new figures. I've mentioned\
  \ how digital sculpts give us as Paizo a lot more opportunity to ensure that details\
  \ are exactly right (we just sent 17 sculpt comments for a single figure yesterday).\
  \ But until now, all you've had beyond digital renders is my word that they're going\
  \ to be awesome.</p> \n    <p>That changes today, as I reveal the paint masters\
  \ for three figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"><i>Iconic Heroes</i> Set\
  \ #1</a>, the very first set that will hit in January 2015. WizKids factory painters\
  \ will do everything they can to replicate these paint jobs exactly, so these figures\
  \ should be an excellent preview of what you can expect from the final production\
  \ run.</p> \n    <p>They are, however, missing some finishing details. Super-detailed\
  \ work like complex patterns on clothing and pupils are applied via a stamping process\
  \ called a tampo during the production run, so these elements often do not appear\
  \ on paint masters. Try to imagine Seoni's tattoos and some of the dress detail\
  \ work and you'll have a better idea of how the final figures will look.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Valeros.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Valeros_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Valeros, Human Fighter like you've never\
  \ seen him before. I think the face says everything you need to know about the power\
  \ of digital sculpting over traditional practical methods, and the quality of all\
  \ of his little pieces of adventuring gear really pushes it over the edge. Check\
  \ out that tankard! Look at the bedroll on his back! I can't wait to get this figure\
  \ for my own collection.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Lini.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Lini_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Valeros has a gnome buddy, and her name is Lini, Gnome\
  \ Druid. Frankly, I really like the original Lini figure from <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  ><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>, but this one comes with a slightly more action-oriented\
  \ pose and puts a little more focus on her sickle. We'll show off Lini's riding\
  \ cat animal companion, Droogami, in next week's preview.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Seoni.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Seoni_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Seoni has always been one of our most popular iconic\
  \ characters, and was one of the originals to appear on the covers of our <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ the very first appearance of the Pathfinder brand. Along with Valeros and several\
  \ others, she stars in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/comics\">Pathfinder Comics</a>\
  \ produced by Dynamite Entertainment, where she is coming into her own as the leader\
  \ of the iconic adventurers. Like Lini, Seoni got a fantastic figure in an earlier\
  \ set. The speed with which that figure sold out was one of the things that convinced\
  \ us that we needed a better option for iconic character minis, and I think the\
  \ pose on this new version is significantly more interesting than her original sculpt\
  \ (which I also really liked). Of the six figures included in <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\
  ><i>Iconic Heroes</i> Set #1</a>, Seoni has by far the most tampos still to come,\
  \ but I think she's off to a great start.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\
  ><i>Iconic Heroes</i></a> also includes Sajan, Iconic Monk; Seelah, Iconic Paladin;\
  \ and Droogami, Lini's snow leopard animal companion. Each of the sets also includes\
  \ six unique <a href=\"/pacg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> cards specific\
  \ to the included adventurers and animals. These cards are available exclusively\
  \ in Pathfinder Battles Iconic Heroes sets, and are not part of existing Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game subscriptions.</p> \n    <p>Swing by next week for a look\
  \ at the paint masters of the other three figures in this set. In the meantime,\
  \ check out the WizKids Pathfinder Battles items we've added to our annual <a href=\"\
