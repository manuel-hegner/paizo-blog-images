  \ the brand-new <a href=\"/products/btpy8v33\"><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood\
  \ of the Night</i></a>and offered up some pointers on playing your favorite bloodsucker.\
  \ Now it's time for dhampirs and the dauntless vampire hunters.</span></p> \n  \
  \  <h2>So You're Playing a Dhampir...</h2> \n    <p>Half-breed vampires, the dhampir\
  \ first appeared in <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"><i>Bestiary 2</i></a> and were\
  \ further embraced in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a>\
  \ (page 96, which begins 6 pages of new traits, archetypes, magic items, and more).\
  \ <i>Blood of the Night</i> expands on those options, bringing these tainted souls\
  \ fully into the Pathfinder campaign setting. If your GM is allowing dhampirs in\
  \ her game, its time to decide if playing one of these accursed souls is right for\
  \ you.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \  <ol>\n     <li><b>Begin with the Basics:</b> Start on the inside front cover\
  \ to get a run down on what it means to be a dhampir. All of the racial benefits\
  \ and abilities of this mysterious breed appear right up front. Check these out\
  \ and see if it seems like a dhampir character is right for you.</li> \n     <li><b>Know\
  \ Your Ancestors:</b> Dhampirs aren't their own full-fledged race, they're half-breeds.\
  \ Just as elven culture impacts half-elves and orc society shapes half-orcs, dhampir\
  \ characters stand to be shaped by their parentage just as much as any of these\
  \ other races. With that in mind, players with dhampir characters should check out\
  \ the overview of the vampiric bloodlines of the Inner Sea on the inside cover,\
  \ and there more detailed write-ups on pages 6 to 12. This might also be a good\
  \ time to decide your general feelings about full-blooded vampires, as dhampirs\
  \ have a reputation for being among the greatest vampire hunters.</li> \n     <li><b>Know\
  \ Yourself:</b> The details of life as a vampire, secrets of this rare race, and\
  \ suggestions for creating dhampir characters are presented on page 18 and 19. Now\
  \ that you've chosen to be a dhampir, learn what that means and let that help shape\
  \ the character you're planning on making. Additionally, now that you know a thing\
  \ or two about your ancestry, decide whether or not you want to further connect\
  \ yourself to Golarion's vampire bloodlines by selecting one of four variant dhampir\
  \ racial options—the jiang-shi-born ru-shi, the moroi-born svetochr, the nosferatu-born\
  \ ancient-born, or the vetala-born ajibachana.</li> \n     <li><b>Create Your Character:</b>\
  \ Now that you know what a dhampir is and how your vampiric heritage has affected\
  \ you, it's time to make your character. Numerous character options can be found\
  \ throughout the book in the form of new feats (28 and 29) and traits for dhampirs\
  \ (19, 20, 21). If you've chosen to be an enemy of vampire kind, the various roles\
  \ for vampire hunters on pages 26 and 27, as well as several of the spells and magic\
  \ items on pages 30 and 31, can also help set your character's path.</li> \n   \
  \  <li><b>Add Campaign Details:</b> Although rare in the extreme, dhampirs can be\
  \ found in many places throughout the Inner Sea Region. Learn about where your dhampir\
  \ and the vampires of your bloodline fit into the Pathfinder campaign setting on\
  \ pages 24 and 25. Additionally, if you're looking for vampires to hunt, check out\
  \ the inside back cover for an overview of places in the Inner Sea Region (below,\
  \ and beyond) in need of vampire hunters.</li> \n     <li><b>Consider Optional Rules:</b>\
  \ Even though many of the options in <i>Blood of the Night</i> are themed for vampires,\
  \ dhampirs straddle the line between the worlds of the living and the dead. A dhampir\
  \ character interested in highlighting his vampiric urges might work with the GM\
  \ to employ the rules for hunger on page 22. Characters with a strong tie to a particular\
  \ vampire bloodline might also find traits suggested for vampires that work well\
  \ for them, and players should ask their GM if she'll permit them. Dhampirs are\
  \ exceptionally rare individuals and norms for this race are few, so work with your\
  \ GM to create the half-vampire hero or antihero of your darkest dreams.</li>\n\

  \ You're Not Playing a Bloodsucker...</h2> \n    <p>Vampire hunters face a daunting,\
  \ immortal foe, but fortunately <i>Blood of the Night</i> can help them in their\
  \ quest to beat back the creatures of the night. Aside from many of the secrets\
  \ and best-known details of Golarion's various vampire breeds, the Hunting Vampires\
  \ section (page 26 and 26) presents four distinct ways to make a variety of vampire\
  \ hunters, from spell-slinging arcane slayers; undead-killing bards, monks, and\
  \ rogues; divine-focused hunters; and classic martial slayers. These builds direct\
  \ players toward some of the strongest vampire-hunting options in the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG, including more than a few options you might have never guessed work great\
  \ against the undead. To really get the edge on the servants of darkness, <i>Blood\
  \ of the Night</i> also presents a host of new feats designed specifically for vampire\
  \ hunters (page 28), new spells (page 30), new magic items (page 31), and, of course,\
  \ a hit list of lands in the Inner Sea where a vampire hunter can ply her trade.\
  \ You don't just need to be playing the Carrion Crown Adventure Path to play a vampire\
  \ hunter anymore—let <i>Blood of the Night</i> be your guide to hunting Golarion's\
  \ deadliest hunters wherever your campaign and character concepts take you.</p>\
