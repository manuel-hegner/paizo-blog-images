  \ \n    <p><i>In</i> <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/v5748btpy8mfm\">Master of\
  \ Devils</a><i>, Dave Gross takes Pathfinder Venture-Captain Varian Jeggare and\
  \ his hellspawn bodyguard Radovan into the distant land of Tian Xia in search of\
  \ a magical pearl, where things quickly go awry. Trapped in the body of a devil,\
  \ Radovan finds himself held hostage by the legendary Quivering Palm attack and\
  \ fighting on behalf of a mysterious master.</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter\
  \ Sixteen: Phoenix Warrior</h2> \n     <p>The basilisk slithered through the streets\
  \ of Khitai. Now and then it lunged, always at a child or a pretty girl who froze\
  \ in place. The monster’s orange eyes bore down until its victim shrieked. Then\
  \ it shook green and yellow scales out of its mane and danced away.</p> \n     <p>Children\
  \ gathered the scale-shaped leaf wrappers and ate the sweet bean cakes inside. The\
  \ eight-legged basilisk moved along to the next throng of children, its painted\
  \ silk skin rippling at every turn. The bare feet of the men inside the monster\
  \ slapped the pavement in time with the festival drums.</p> \n     <p>I was the\
  \ opposite of the basilisk, a monster hidden beneath the silk cover of a man.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Even without Burning Cloud Devil’s magic, it was a good enough disguise.\
  \ Unless someone got close, I could have been another of the big northern barbarians\
  \ who’d come south looking for mercenary work. I was glad I’d picked up a black\
  \ rice hat with a brim so low it had an eye slit in the front. I felt like a kid\
  \ playing at knights in armor, but at least no one had run screaming when I came\
  \ into town.</p> \n     <p>Burning Cloud Devil was still holed up at the inn. I’\
  d wandered off to find a smith to repair my big knife. As an afterthought I asked\
  \ him to make a new one just like it, only big enough for my devil hands. We negotiated\
  \ until I got tired of pantomime. I showed him the big smile, and we had a deal.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The rest of the day I figured I’d take in the sights. There was no point\
  \ telling Burning Cloud Devil where I was going. After our long journey back from\
  \ the western mountains, and a hundred failed attempts to teach me his Quivering\
  \ Palm technique, he said he needed to catch up on his sleep. </p> \n     <p>After\
  \ the business with the Moon Blade Killer, we’d both had some rough nights. More\
  \ than once I’d woken from nightmares of the boss writhing inside a dragon’s belly.\
  \ Across the fire, Burning Cloud Devil twitched in his sleep, soaked with night\
  \ sweat. I figured he dreamed of Spring Snow in the same damned place.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Despite the nightmares, I wasn’t buying his “need some sleep” excuse. He’\
  d been wound up tight since I showed him the silver sword. He said he didn’t believe\
  \ I’d seen Spring Snow, but I could tell it was gnawing at him. I’d seen it a thousand\
  \ times before with the boss.</p> \n     <p>Burning Cloud Devil wasn’t slipping\
  \ away to rest. He was off to get stinking drunk.</p> \n     <p>Weeks ago I’d figured\
  \ out that most of the joints he called “tea houses” were really taverns. Let him\
  \ drink, I figured. At least it spared me more lessons on clarifying my soul or\
  \ maintaining the perfect nature of my body or some other airy stuff. When he wasn’\
  t full of wine, he was full of bad poetry.</p> \n     <p>Since I’d seen her face,\
  \ I had a hard time picturing Spring Snow with this guy. She struck me as a good\
  \ kid, full of life at one time. She had to have been a lot more fun than he was.\
  \ Burning Cloud Devil didn’t deserve someone like her.</p> \n     <p>The way I saw\
  \ it, he was responsible for the deaths of the family back at the restaurant. Sure,\
  \ it was me the Moon Blade Killer had come to kill, but Burning Cloud Devil knew\
  \ it would happen. He’d tricked me into burying the wrestler’s head. He might as\
  \ well have murdered those boys and their father himself.</p> \n     <p>Anyway,\
  \ it had to be his fault. Otherwise, it was mine.</p> \n     <p>I couldn’t stand\
  \ to think that.</p> \n     <p>Among the festival crowd, a woman dressed as a warrior\
  \ caught my eye. Her golden scale armor glittered in the sun. She held one of those\
  \ long-bladed glaives, sort of halfway between a spear and a sword. Where its grip\
  \ met the blade twined a golden phoenix.</p> \n     <p>Something told me she hadn’\
  t dressed up for the festival.</p> \n     <p>Most people in town hadn’t given me\
  \ a second glance, but this woman stared in a way that made me think she could see\
  \ through the brim of my hat. In other circumstances, I’d tip her a wink, but she\
  \ was the one who threw me a fetching smile.</p> \n     <p>Normally, that’s all\
  \ the encouragement I need. Instead of taking her up on the invitation, I walked\
  \ away.</p> \n     <p>Until Burning Cloud Devil released my body, I was in no fit\
  \ shape for a cuddle. And yeah, I knew that probably wasn’t what her smile meant,\
  \ but it was what it made me think about.</p> \n     <p>Likely she wanted a whole\
  \ different kind of trouble. Without Burning Cloud Devil around to slap me up with\
  \ the fight whammy, there was nothing in it for me.</p> \n     <p>She called after\
  \ me in Tien. “Face me, devil.”</p> \n     <p>I kept walking. A few steps later,\
  \ a wave of nausea rolled through me. She’d thrown a spell on me. </p> \n     <p>I\
  \ ran down a narrow lane between a block of townhouses and a spice shop. Waiting\
  \ for me at the other end was a woman dressed identically to the first, except she\
  \ held a scepter with a golden phoenix on its head. She looked exactly like the\
  \ other woman. </p> \n     <p>Twins, of course.</p> \n     <p>Under other circumstances,\
  \ I’d have been tickled. With their thick jaws and thin noses, they were no beauties,\
  \ but they were all right. Later there’d be time to imagine the scenarios that could\
  \ have been, assuming I survived this little tryst.</p> \n     <p>She pointed the\
  \ scepter at me. Its wings began to move, its feathered breast glowing red.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I didn’t wait to see the result. I pulled a little juice from inside\
  \ the core of my spirit and jumped from the ground to land on the roof of the spice\
  \ shop.</p> \n     <p>No matter how many times I did that trick, “flying” never\
  \ got old. Burning Cloud Devil said it came easily to me because of my abundant\
  \ ki. Sometimes I wondered whether I’d still be able to do it when I got back to\
  \ my regular body. It’d be a useful trick, not to mention one hell of a lot of fun.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My first step crunched through the roof tile. I weighed a lot more these\
  \ days, so I stuck to running along the beam lines. A few more tiles clattered away\
  \ behind me, but I made it to the other side without falling through. I leaped down\
  \ onto the next lane, heard a cry, and looked around to see who I’d startled.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There was no one in the street except the armored woman. She lunged,\
  \ twirled the glaive, and stepped back. I realized she’d already hit me only when\
  \ the front of my rice hat fell off, revealing my face.</p> \n     <p>She gave me\
  \ a smug smile and turned her blade so the reflected sunlight light dazzled me.\
  \ I shaded my eyes until she turned the blade again, showing me the opposite side.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>On the metal was etched a familiar symbol. I’d seen it in Minkai. It\
  \ was the mark of Shizuru, goddess of ancestors and honor. This woman wasn’t just\
  \ a warrior.</p> \n     <p>She was a paladin.</p> \n     <p>Her smile vanished as\
  \ she advanced, whirling the long blade. I turned to run, but there she was on the\
  \ other side, this time with the golden scepter.</p> \n     <p> “Xifeng.” The one\
  \ with the scepter saluted her sister. “The honor of first attack is yours. Smite\
  \ the evil beast!”</p> \n     <p>Xifeng returned the salute. “I thank you, Dongmei.\
  \ I accept your charge and—”</p> \n     <p>“Listen, ladies, thanks all the same,\
  \ but no smiting today. Despite my looks, I’m not actually evil.”</p> \n     <p>Hey,\
  \ I’m entitled to my opinion.</p> \n     <p>“It says it is not evil,” said Dongmei,\
  \ translating my devil-speech to Tien. Good for her, I thought. Know your enemy.\
  \ Speak the language. Maybe we’ll have a drink later.</p> \n     <p>“Impossible,”\
  \ said Xifeng. “I see its aura. It is a fiend from Hell.”</p> \n     <p>“Cheliax,\
  \ actually,” I said. Dongmei’s face remained blank, so I did boat-on-the-wave with\
  \ my hand. “Far across the sea, on the other side of the world.”</p> \n     <p>Dongmei\
  \ showed me her palm, two fingers up, thumb nestled to the side. She said a few\
  \ words in the language of angels, which I never learned because it’s got no decent\
  \ curses. A pale golden circle formed around us. Motes of holy light danced in the\
  \ alley like dust under a bright window.</p> \n     <p>“Say it again,” demanded\
  \ Dongmei. “Tell us you are not truly evil.”</p> \n     <p>“I’m not— I’m actually\
  \ a perfectly— The thing is—”</p> \n     <p>I couldn’t say the words. Her magic\
  \ turned them to dust in my mouth.</p> \n     <p>“You condemn yourself!” cried Dongmei.\
  \ “Not even a devil can tell a lie within the Circle of Truth.”</p> \n     <p>Xifeng’\
  s slipper scuffed the ground behind me. Even in armor, the woman was quick. She\
  \ damned near succeeded where the Moon Blade Killer failed. I moved just in time\
  \ to make sure it was only the rest of my hat that fell onto the street.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I jumped back to the roof. Xifeng vaulted up behind me. I let her chase\
  \ me across a couple more buildings while I searched for an escape route.</p> \n\
  \     <p>No dice. Dongmei had already cut me off, running up steps of air on the\
  \ other side. I’d seen that trick before. It meant a god was listening to her prayers.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I was fighting both a paladin and a priest. If there’d ever before been\
  \ a question of my going to Hell, it was answered now.</p> \n     <p>I tossed a\
  \ handful of darts to keep her occupied. She covered her face with her arm, but\
  \ the little blades glanced off an invisible barrier a few inches from her skin.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A crunch on the roof tiles warned me of Xifeng’s attack. To make sure\
  \ I knew it was coming, she added a battle cry. “Shizuru, guide my hand!”</p> \n\
  \     <p>I leaped away. The roof exploded in yellow light inches away from me. Sharp\
  \ tile fragments bit into my face and neck.</p> \n     <p>Xifeng’s battle cry was\
  \ mighty.</p> \n     <p>I feinted a forward roll and swept her legs with a kick.\
  \ Xifeng fell for it, and then she fell for it—right off the side of the roof.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It’s always funnier when something like that happens to a paladin.</p>\

  \ \n     <p>I grinned as I turned to face Dongmei. She had just finished calling\
  \ down a spell, her arms raised to heaven to receive it.</p> \n     <p>It landed\
  \ on me, a pillar of roaring flames. I threw back my head to laugh—fire doesn’t\
  \ bother me when I’m cloaked in Hell—but out of my mouth came a howl of pain.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The holy fire was hot and cold and something else I can’t explain. It\
  \ hurt far more than the burning I feel just before fire turns me big. My hair floated\
  \ up like I was underwater. My clothes rustled but didn’t so much as smoke.</p>\
  \ \n     <p> My grin turned into a snarl.</p> \n     <p>“All right, sister, you\
  \ got my attention.”</p> \n     <p>Dongmei’s eyes widened. She ran and leaped to\
  \ the next building, once more walking on an invisible stair. I sent a pair of darts\
  \ after her, putting one just above her shoulder blade. She faltered but didn’t\
  \ fall.</p> \n     <p>The gap was wider than those I’d jumped before. I pumped my\
  \ legs, my clawed toes tearing divots in the burning roof. I threw myself across\
  \ the street and landed hard on the opposite roof, leaving the burning building\
  \ behind me.</p> \n     <p>Dongmei’s fingers sketched another spell. She babbled\
  \ holy words.</p> \n     <p>I charged across the tiles, diving into a tumble to\
  \ come at her from below. My palm caught her on the breastbone. I let my fingers\
  \ do the spider-crawl strike Burning Cloud Devil taught me. I sealed them with the\
  \ final blow.</p> \n     <p>Dongmei recognized the attack. Her face paled. She slapped\
  \ at her sternum, gasping as I raised my fist and squeezed it tight.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>I felt no invisible strings between my fingers and her heart. I still hadn’\
  t got the knack.</p> \n     <p>Her color returned. She raised her scepter. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>I shot her a fast one in the breadbasket. My knuckle spurs pierced her\
  \ armor.</p> \n     <p>She pressed her hand against my forehead. I felt her pulse\
  \ fluttering through her palm. The last few syllables of her spell came out in blood,\
  \ but she pronounced them well enough for her goddess to hear.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ goddess replied.</p> \n     <p>Holy fire erupted out of my brain. Hot tears poured\
  \ down my face, so thick I feared they might be my melted eyeballs. Dongmei showed\
  \ me a pained smile of triumph as her face blurred from my vision. </p> \n     <p>My\
  \ thoughts melted away next. All I had left inside my head was hatred. My hand found\
  \ the grip of the big knife. I brought it up hard and low, through Dongmei’s belly\
  \ and up into her chest.</p> \n     <p>She didn’t scream. The only sound was the\
  \ scrape of my blade across her metal armor and the bone beneath. I lifted her up,\
  \ twisting and jerking the blade to tear her heart to pieces. The cloud over my\
  \ vision drifted away. </p> \n     <p>“Sister!” Xifeng screamed from the edge of\
  \ the roof.</p> \n     <p>I turned to show the paladin what I’d done with her sister.\
  \ Dongmei’s blood was on my face, running down my lips and across the long, ragged\
  \ teeth of my big smile.</p> \n     <p>Across my shoulder, Dongmei stretched a feeble\
  \ arm toward Xifeng. For an instant, the gesture plucked at something that had slipped\
  \ down deep inside me. It was something important, something I used to value. I\
  \ couldn’t think of its name.</p> \n     <p>Whatever it was, I didn’t need it anymore.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Xifeng stood at the edge of the roof. She raised her hand toward her\
  \ sister’s.</p> \n     <p>Dongmei’s weight lifted off of me. Her body faded away,\
  \ but the ghost of it floated toward her sister. As their outstretched hands touched,\
  \ the image of Dongmei vanished. Xifeng stood alone, her sword-glaive in one hand,\
  \ the phoenix scepter in the other.</p> \n     <p>She tucked her sister’s weapon\
  \ inside her belt and assumed a fighting stance.</p> \n     <p>“You want some of\
  \ the same?” I said.</p> \n     <p>There was no one to translate, but she was done\
  \ talking. She came on like a storm. </p> \n     <p>I drifted back and tried another\
  \ kick, but she set the butt of her weapon into the tile and blocked me. The dark\
  \ wood was hard as steel. There’d be one hell of a bruise on my instep.</p> \n \
  \    <p>She attacked with both the blade and the spiked butt of the glaive. She\
  \ was strong as a bull, and fast. It was all I could do to bring up my arms to protect\
  \ my body. The blade hit hard, but it couldn’t cut the sleeves of my enchanted robes.\
  \ Xifeng noticed and redirected her blows to my hands, face, and feet.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Her limited targets gave me breathing room. With the big knife I gave her\
  \ a good shot in the shoulder, hard enough to bloody her golden scales. The wound\
  \ barely slowed her.</p> \n     <p>I followed up with a knee to the belly, but she\
  \ faded back and stepped to my right. She’d gulled me!</p> \n     <p>The blade creased\
  \ the back of my skull. The bone cracked, and I felt a cool rush of air slip inside.\
  \ I rolled away, expecting a finishing shot to land where my head had been.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Xifeng anticipated that, too. The butt of her glaive slammed into my\
  \ mouth. I choked on blood and the shards of my teeth.</p> \n     <p>Something came\
  \ apart inside me. It felt as though some enormous hand had grasped my spine and\
  \ cracked it like a whip. Everything I saw turned the color of blood. I clutched\
  \ and clawed, kicked and raked, snarling and spitting like an animal.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>It didn’t matter what I touched. I ripped it in my hands, shredded it in my\
  \ ruined teeth. Shattered tile, metal, and flesh filled my mouth. At last I felt\
  \ a hard kick on my ass, and I fell off the roof and face-first onto the pavement.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I came up spitting fragments of paving stones.</p> \n     <p>Mocking\
  \ laughter rained down from another roof across the street.</p> \n     <p>“The gods\
  \ punish you for starting another fight without me,” said Burning Cloud Devil. His\
  \ voice was equal parts amusement, irritation, and wine.</p> \n     <p>He sat cross-legged\
  \ on the edge of a bakery roof. Cradled in his legs were a steam basket and a wine\
  \ jug. He’d brought refreshments for the show.</p> \n     <p>The sun exploded behind\
  \ me. That’s how it felt, anyway.</p> \n     <p>I turned, shielding my eyes from\
  \ the radiance. On the roof stood the silhouettes of both sisters, each holding\
  \ her weapon. They stepped forward. Each was bloodied, but Dongmei’s wound now appeared\
  \ little more than a deep cut.</p> \n     <p>They hesitated at the sight of Burning\
  \ Cloud Devil. He laughed at their reaction.</p> \n     <p>“The Phoenix Warrior!\
  \ I meant to seek her out, but only after you had mastered the Quivering Palm.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Maybe you can give me a hand,” I said. Even in devil-speech, my\
  \ words came out a mushy mumble through my broken teeth. “Which sister you want?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Which sister?” He juggled a hot dumpling one-handed. “There is but\
  \ one Phoenix Warrior.”</p> \n     <p>I figured he meant Dongmei, then, since she\
  \ carried the phoenix scepter. I pointed at her. “Almost got that one.” </p> \n\
  \     <p>Dongmei scoffed. “Burning Cloud Devil, let us see what fiend you have summoned\
  \ to plague our town.” She touched the butt of Xifeng’s glaive to wet her fingers\
  \ with blood.</p> \n     <p>My blood.</p> \n     <p>She blew it like a kiss onto\
  \ a strip of white parchment and read the words that formed there. “Radovan Virholt\
  \ Norge kel Zogreb Dokange the Flaying Tongue Fell Viridio ...This is not a name!”\
  </p> \n     <p>In her hands, the blood turned her parchment completely red before\
  \ trickling down her fingers. She cast it away like a filthy thing.</p> \n     <p>Burning\
  \ Cloud Devil choked on his dumpling. “So many!”</p> \n     <p>Dongmei and Xifeng\
  \ raised their arms to the sky and bathed in healing radiance. I’d have to start\
  \ all over.</p> \n     <p>“Bitches cheat,” I said. “Come on, Lefty. You can take\
  \ the little one.”</p> \n     <p>Burning Cloud Devil lost his smirk and glared at\
  \ me. All right, I admitted. That was a little mean. But if he hadn’t come to fight,\
  \ he could use all the encouragement I had to offer.</p> \n     <p>Dongmei ran down\
  \ her steps of air to stand twenty feet away to my left. Xifeng hit the ground on\
  \ the right. They raised their weapons and closed in toward me.</p> \n     <p>“\
  It is a pity you were not a more diligent student,” said Burning Cloud Devil.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Before I could ask what he meant by ‘were,’ Xifeng made a flourish with\
  \ her glaive. Despite my tough robes, I was shy of that blade, but I was tired of\
  \ running. I sidestepped, but her attack was only a feint. On the ground between\
  \ us, Dongmei’s shadow swallowed up mine and kept growing.</p> \n     <p>I leaped\
  \ aside just in time to avoid her massive fist. It struck the ground like a boulder,\
  \ and I kept rolling away. She’d grown taller than me, bigger than an ogre.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>On the roof, Burning Cloud Devil laughed. His voice echoed through the\
  \ streets and shook the shutters. He wrote on a sheet of paper on his knee.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Take your notes later!” I shouted.</p> \n     <p>Xifeng came for me\
  \ in earnest. Her glaive smashed a hitching post where my legs had been an instant\
  \ earlier.</p> \n     <p>It was time to get away. I ran up the street and skidded\
  \ to a halt. The city guard had arrived. They formed a barricade of pikes and shields.\
  \ I turned to run down the street, dodging the giant Dongmei and her smaller but\
  \ still vicious paladin double. Beyond them, another phalanx of guards appeared.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>I looked around, but every path was closed. There were archers\
  \ on the rooftops, and every door and window had shut.</p> \n     <p>“A little help!”\
  </p> \n     <p>Burning Cloud Devil washed down the last of his dumplings with a\
  \ huge swig of wine. “Very well,” he said. “But only if you use the Quivering Palm.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“I can’t—” What the hell. I could give it a go. “Fine!”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“Put them close together.” Burning Cloud Devil’s voice whispered in my ear.\
  \ I heard it as clearly as if he’d stood behind me, but he remained on the rooftop.\
  \ He dropped the empty jug and steam basket and assumed a horse stance.</p> \n \
  \    <p>He let the giant kick me around a little while I focused on keeping Xifeng’\
  s blade from my neck. At last, the spell that made Dongmei big wore off. I rolled\
  \ toward a wall, ran three steps up the side, and flipped back to kick her in the\
  \ face.</p> \n     <p>It was a heavy blow made worse by the claws on my toes. Four\
  \ deep grooves cut across her face, and for a second I thought I’d taken out an\
  \ eye. In an instant, the wound faded to half its depth. She whipped around to strike\
  \ me with her glowing scepter. I leaped out of the way.</p> \n     <p>From the other\
  \ side, Xifeng screamed as she lunged for me. I twisted aside and felt her blade\
  \ slide across my shoulder blades. One glimpse of her angry face showed me she’\
  d suffered half the kick I gave Dongmei.</p> \n     <p>“Now,” whispered Burning\
  \ Cloud Devil. “Strike both at once.”</p> \n     <p>I crouched low and struck both\
  \ women at once. My palms hit just below the breastbone. The fingers of my left\
  \ hand traced out the pattern of a cage, or a net. I’d never thought of it that\
  \ way before, but I knew it could capture a life.</p> \n     <p>Xifeng gasped.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The fingers of my right hand moved also, but too slow. </p> \n     <p>Dongmei\
  \ slapped my hand away.</p> \n     <p>“Do as I do,” hissed Burning Cloud Devil.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>For another second I tried to remember the moves he had made through\
  \ my left hand. Then I gave up and just tried to feel them.</p> \n     <p>I struck\
  \ again, hitting both women in the same place. My fingers moved, this time faster\
  \ than Burning Cloud Devil could command them. They formed the same patterns, built\
  \ the same cages. Xifeng and Dongmei cried out as one. Their bodies trembled and\
  \ became translucent. They moved together, forming a single person holding Xifeng\
  \ and Dongmei’s weapons in either hand. She fell to her knees.</p> \n     <p>I rolled\
  \ back and stood. A cool calm washed over me, but underneath I felt the heat of\
  \ anger. They—she—had meant to kill me, but now I was the one who held her life\
  \ in my palm. I felt it trembling there, like a hummingbird.</p> \n     <p>“Mercy,”\
  \ moaned the Phoenix Warrior. “Spare me.”</p> \n     <p>“Crush her,” whispered Burning\
  \ Cloud Devil. “Prove what you have learned.”</p> \n     <p>“I didn’t come after\
  \ you,” I told her. “You came after me.”</p> \n     <p>“Please.”</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ needed another reason. “You broke my teeth.”</p> \n     <p>She opened her mouth,\
  \ but before she could plead again, her courage returned to clamp her jaw shut.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“You have this coming,” I told her. I wanted to believe it, too.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I closed my hand. A bird-shaped flame leaped from her chest and flew\
  \ away. In its wake, the buildings caught fire as the woman’s corpse fell onto the\
  \ dusty street.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><b><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8mfm\"\
