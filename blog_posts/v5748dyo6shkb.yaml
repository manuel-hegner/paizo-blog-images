  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <h2>OPM Musings</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Wow, the month flew by. Activity the last few weeks focused on getting\
  \ January scenarios out of the door, working on future scenarios, planning for our\
  \ new seasons, and ramping up for convention season. We’re putting some finishing\
  \ touches on our plans and will share them with everyone in a few weeks. </p> \n\
  \     <p>It’s been satisfying to have some of our longer-term projects come to fruition.\
  \ Over the next few months, we hope to bring a few more projects across the finish\
  \ line. I’ll leave it to Alex to reveal our latest project.</p> \n     <h2>New FAQ\
  \ Pages</h2> \n     <p>We’re glad there was such a positive response to the new\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Character Options</a> page last week because we’ve got another new set of pages\
  \ for you: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/faq\">FAQ pages for Paizo Organized</a>\
  \ Play have now been updated! We’ve got areas for general organized play questions,\
  \ as well as areas for program-specific questions. Just like the Character Options\
  \ page, this update both refreshes the look of the pages and will make it easier\
  \ for the Organized Play team to publish content. We’re still tweaking these pages,\
  \ so you may see some changes in how the content is organized, but if you have feedback,\
  \ let us know! We’ve kept the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/legacy/faq\"\
  >Pathfinder Society (first edition) pages</a> in the legacy format.</p> \n     <p>Eagle-eyed\
  \ players will notice that the Pathfinder Society FAQ page currently contains the\
  \ full text of a number of boons. You’ve been asking for a place to view the full\
  \ text of boons before buying them, and now we’ve got one! Any boon that is more\
  \ complicated than its short description will have its text published on this page.\
  \ Boons that unlock ancestries or similarly self-evident boons will not have their\
  \ text published. </p> \n     <p>The FAQ page also contains the full text of our\
  \ Year 2 Chronicle Boons. As we discussed in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk2?Pathfinder-Society-Digitization-Update\"\
  >last week’s blog</a>, there is an issue where GMs cannot download these boons after\
  \ running the game, so we’re pleased to offer this workaround. <b>Any GM with a\
  \ chronicle sheet for running a Year 2 scenario with a boon attached can use the\
  \ full text as published on the FAQ page instead of downloading the boon</b>. Once\
  \ the bug is fixed, these boons will be removed from the FAQ page to avoid spoilers.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Fame</h2> \n     <p>Last week, we updated the community regarding our\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk2?Pathfinder-Society-Digitization-Update\"\
  >Pathfinder Society digitization efforts</a>. At this point, Fame is no longer a\
  \ spendable currency and we are not tracking it in any way. Reputation still exists\
  \ and unlocks benefits for characters via the Achievement Point system on your “\
  My Organized Play” page. You can see your current Reputation with the factions (note,\
  \ it is called Fame on the webpage in a holdover from Pathfinder Society (first\
  \ edition), which is something we have queued to fix.)</p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>We caught up on some of the outstanding tasks, as well as kept up with\
  \ our goal of day one sanctioning. Last month, we finished up <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari\"\
  >Troubles in Otari</a> and added the character options from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy\"\
  >The Threefold Conspiracy</a> to the Starfinder Society Additional Resource document.\
  \ By the end of this month, we hope to have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg/discuss&amp;page=last?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering\"\
  >The Slithering</a> and another update to Starfinder Society Additional Resouces.\
  \ We also are on target to have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a> ready on release day (February 24th). We haven’\
  t forgotten the Pathfinder (first edition) outstanding items, but we haven’t had\
  \ the capacity to dip back into that system yet.</p> \n     <h2>GM Achievements</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program\
  \ involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must\
  \ run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant).\
  \ A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We had one GM earn their 5th star this month. No GMs earned their fifth\
  \ Nova or Glyph.</p> \n     <p><b>5th Star</b>: Dawn Upson</p> \n     <p>Congratulations\
  \ on your achievement, Dawn!</p> \n     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Convention\
  \ season is just around the corner, and we’re starting to kick up planning for our\
  \ major conventions. We hope to have information on how to volunteer soon! In the\
  \ meantime, there are plenty of local events offering Paizo Organized Play. If you\
  \ don’t see a convention on the list that you think should be there, contact the\
  \ event organizer and ask them to register their event for organized play support.</p>\
