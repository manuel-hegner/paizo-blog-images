  \ Preview: Behind the Scenes</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, January 14, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In\
  \ the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfr0\">comments thread</a> to last week's <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> preview,\
  \ user Pigraven asked several questions about the Pathfinder Battles product line\
  \ that might be good fodder for a blog. The community thought that would be a good\
  \ idea, and so do I. So in addition to posting three more figures from the upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set of prepainted plastic gaming\
  \ figures this evening, I thought I'd also go through Pigraven's questions and provide\
  \ some quick answers.</span></p> \n    <p><b>Q: How much does ease of sculpt matter?\
  \ Do they tend to rule out certain characters or creatures because they worry a\
  \ sculpt might prove too worrisome?</b></p> \n    <p>Ease of sculpt informs rarity\
  \ more than anything else. Most of the figures in a Pathfinder Battles set are composed\
  \ of between 2 and 8 parts, with the figures that require more pieces generally\
  \ falling into the rare or uncommon categories. Occasionally, after I've put together\
  \ a proposed set list, WizKids will consult with their factory and make suggestions\
  \ for a few \"rarity swaps.\" This is generally a pretty painless process, but it\
  \ can cause some potential problems. For example, I'm currently working on a set\
  \ list for an upcoming set that includes an Attic Whisperer, a child skeleton spirit\
  \ thing that is creepy as hell. I'd slated it at the uncommon rarity, because you\
  \ really don't need a handful of these (most Attic Whisperer encounters involve\
  \ a single creature), but because the factory came back saying that it would only\
  \ require 2 pieces, WizKids suggested that we move it to common. Doing that would\
  \ result in too many Attic Whisperers in a given case, so I probably won't go along\
  \ with their suggestion in that case.</p> \n    <p>To date, the only figure we have\
  \ chosen not to make due to sculpt complexity is Baba Yaga's Hut, which I really\
  \ wanted to be the limited edition case incentive figure for <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"\
  >Reign of Winter</a>, but the factory said that doing it right would simply be too\
  \ expensive.</p> \n    <p><b>Q: What role does the potential paint process play\
  \ in their decision-making? As we've seen, this entire line is a process. And like\
  \ any great artist or musician, part of the process is always working to perfect\
  \ a craft. We know that there are issues with some Medium-sized, human faces in\
  \ these lines; does this influence the amount of these characters Paizo chooses?</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Not yet. I'm impressed with WizKids' ability to improve the paint process\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> to <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a>, which we've already covered in detail here. I take\
  \ a look at the overall quality of the paint application both in my own cases and\
  \ packs that I open here at the office and in reports from consumers on this and\
  \ other sites, and send along comments on WizKids, who do their best to make improvements.\
  \ Sometimes that means simplifying paint masters, sometimes that probably means\
  \ refining the tooling, and sometimes that probably means a manager at the plant\
  \ standing over someone's shoulder and making sure they do the right thing. Even\
  \ with all of those controls, we're still talking about a mass-produced product,\
  \ here, so there are going to be some problems. I've definitely moved a figure from\
  \ uncommon to rare, for example, because I was dubious that the plant could pull\
  \ off the quality we needed at the lesser rarity. </p> \n    <p><b>Q: Is there a\
  \ specific ratio per set that they aim for in regards to enemies &amp; good guys?\
  \ Humans &amp; other creatures?</b></p> \n    <p>Not really. I make all of the decisions\
  \ as to what stuff to include. Sometimes WizKids or some of my colleagues at Paizo\
  \ make their own suggestions, and I try to accommodate them as much as possible.\
  \ About my only \"rule\" is that once per set I like to include one figure simply\
  \ because I want it. There are certain perks to being the publisher. Just ask my\
  \ friends the Seaweed Siren and Gibrileth Demon. </p> \n    <p><b>Q: Is each set\
  \ an entirely new entity, or do they allow what they already have released play\
  \ a role in what makes it into a new set? For example, Wrath of the Righteous is\
  \ very demon-heavy, so it seems natural to load up on demons for the set. There\
  \ are a few demons that appear in Reign of Winter, including some Cold-specific\
  \ ones. Theoretically, would they hesitate to put a demon in the new set after including\
  \ so many demons and other outsiders in the last set?</b></p> \n    <p>\"They\"\
  \ is really \"I\" in this case, and generally speaking I wouldn't hesitate to put\
  \ a cold demon into the Reign of Winter set if it seemed appropriate and there were\
  \ not better/cooler figures in the mix. I am a little burned out on winged female\
  \ demons, however, so my own fatigue with certain types of figures (and my impression\
  \ of what the audience wants/is tired of) definitely plays a role. That said, I'll\
  \ probably be laying off demons in general for a while, because we've done so many\
  \ of them generally. That wouldn't keep me from including a demon we haven't done,\
  \ but it will keep me from putting another Serpent Demon or Fire Demon in a set\
  \ for a while.</p> \n    <p><b>Q: How much does potential mass appeal play into\
  \ the decision-making process? Do you ever rule out particular characters or creatures\
  \ because you don't think they have a wide enough appeal outside the particular\
  \ adventure? For example, there haven't been too many plant miniatures that appear\
  \ in your line, despite a fair amount of creative creatures and well drawn illustrations\
  \ to choose from. Is this because you speculate that if given an opportunity, more\
  \ people using miniatures would likely choose a devil or aberration to use in their\
  \ homemade campaign than, say, a Basidirond?</b></p> \n    <p>Lack of plant creatures\
  \ at the moment is more a coincidence than anything else. It does really help to\
  \ have excellent art that would work with the round base of a size-appropriate figure,\
  \ meaning that something like a long assassin vine might need a new illustration\
  \ before I send it to WizKids. I do not have a particular bias toward devils and\
  \ against basidironds. If I had a good opportunity to put one in where it was thematically\
  \ appropriate, I'd do so. In fact, I'll make sure to add some plant creatures to\
  \ an upcoming set specifically due to this question!</p> \n    <p><b>Q: How much\
  \ do other lines-both past and present-matter when making decisions for a set? For\
  \ example, how about the Reaper Pathfinder minis? Do you look at that line and think\
  \ \"Well, there is already a sculpt for this particular character, so we could keep\
  \ this out of the pre-painted set for awhile and include him somewhere down the\
  \ line?\" The old D&amp;D pre-painted lines have hundreds of different characters\
  \ and sculpts and were around for the better part of a decade. Most of them are\
  \ still readily available on different websites, including plenty at affordable\
  \ prices. Does this play a role at all when deciding what makes it into the Pathfinder\
  \ sets?</b></p> \n    <p>I'd say this matters a little. When deciding which creatures\
  \ not to include in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ set, for example, I definitely felt better cutting a figure if I knew there was\
  \ a Reaper version available. I've been collecting prepainted plastic figures since\
  \ they first came out, so one bias I definitely have is toward figures that are\
  \ relatively popular creatures of fantasy, but which have never been done in prepainted\
  \ plastic before. That said, if you fill each set with a ton of obscure corner cases\
  \ it tends to alienate newer/more casual collectors, so you've really got to balance\
  \ things carefully.</p> \n    <p><b>Q: How much input from these boards are considered\
  \ when making selections? While I realize this is just a small set of the people\
  \ who ultimately buy the product, I would assume there are still good ideas to be\
  \ had from posters on here.</b></p> \n    <p>I've incorporated a ton of the feedback\
  \ provided here into the development of the line in general. From figure suggestions\
  \ to criticisms of paint applications or sculpts, I read everything and rely on\
  \ your feedback for most decisions I make about this (or any of our other) product\
  \ line(s).</p> \n    <p><b>Q: When you are in the decision-making process for what\
  \ miniatures make it into a set based off an Adventure Path, do you have a master\
  \ list containing each character and creature found in the adventure?</b></p> \n\
  \    <p>Yes. I generally make this myself, although with newer Adventure Paths that\
  \ have more art (due to higher art budgets than we enjoyed in 2008, for example)\
  \ I tend to do a \"first pass\" based mostly on what art really catches my eye.\
  \ Luckly, we have good illustrations of most if not all of the really important\
  \ characters, so they tend to get swept up in this initial dragnet. Then I look\
  \ at all of the encounters of stuff that you fight, but that are not illustrated\
  \ in the Adventure Path. If there's a good illustration of that monster elsewhere,\
  \ and there's room for it in the set, I'll include it.</p> \n    <p><b>Q: How much\
  \ does the artwork of a particular character or creature play into the process?</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>It is the single most important factor. Up until recently I haven't had\
  \ the budget allocated to commission new art exclusively for these sets, so if there\
  \ is no illustration or a bad illustration (which could include simply weird anatomy\
  \ or a pose that won't really fit on a base), that creature does not get a miniature.\
  \ Unless I really, really want it to now, in which case I have a little money tucked\
  \ away to order a new piece. But this has never happened to date.</p> \n    <p><b>Q:\
  \ Are you hoping to eventually produce a line for each Adventure Path series, both\
  \ past and present?</b></p> \n    <p>That would be really cool, but I've learned\
  \ never to make long-term predictions like that. All I can say is that we will keep\
  \ making these sets as long as you guys keep buying them. If we keep it up long\
  \ enough, we'll have no choice BUT to make minis for all of the Adventure Paths!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But enough with the preamble. Let's get to today's minis reveals!</p>\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Falcon. He is a falcon. The Falcon\
  \ is a Small figure slated at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ and thus I present here the Winter Guard Falconer. The falcon on this gentleman's\
  \ arm is a little smaller than the stand-alone Falcon miniature, but it still looks\
  \ great. The original illustration for this guy had him wearing snow shoes, but\
  \ I decided to remove them for the miniature to increase this figure's versatility.\
  \ He makes a good elite guard, ranger, or even bird-oriented player character. The\
  \ Winter Guard Falconer is a Medium uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8xbz\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #69</a> contains tons of centaurs, but my favorite of all of them\
  \ is this woman, who we call the Centaur Archer. In the campaign itself, this is\
  \ a friendly wilderness guide called Erdija, but she works just as well as a generic\
  \ centaur archer. WizKids did a great job on both the sculpt and painting on this\
  \ figure, who is probably my favorite centaur yet produced in prepainted plastic.\
  \ The Centaur Scout is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week's\

  \ up in stores and in the mailboxes of subscribers very shortly, so do keep your\
  \ eyes out for it! </p> \n    <p>I hope you enjoyed the Q&amp;A at the beginning\
  \ of this blog. Please feel free to post additional questions in the comments below,\
  \ and I'll try to answer them either in the comments section or in a future Friday\
