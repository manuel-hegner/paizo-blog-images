  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hail, Pathfinders!<br>\n\
  \        Today we’re catching up with our friends at BKOM Studios while they develop\
  \ a Hack and Slash adaptation of <em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em>. Talking\
  \ to their Creative Director Wyatt and Art Director Jonathan, we learned more about\
  \ what it takes to translate a game from tabletop to video game. And in this case,\
  \ it was all through the lens of strange and mysterious inhabitants of the Darklands:\
  \ caligni.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Immersion and Understanding&nbsp;</h3>\n \
  \     <p>To bring caligni over to their game, BKOM started with a clear understanding\
  \ of their identity. Where better to start than the caligni’s tragic history?</p>\n\
  \      <p>Once people of the mighty Azlanti empire who reigned over Golarion, they\
  \ fled underground millennia ago to survive the cataclysmic Earthfall.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>In desperation, they made a pact with malevolent demigods known as the Forsaken,\
  \ who transformed them into resilient and merciless subterranean dwellers capable\
  \ of surviving the Darklands.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>As part of the deal, when a caligni\
  \ dies, they combust in a burst of light and flame, with their soul energy feeding\
  \ the Forsaken… a cruel irony, as the Forsaken vanished long ago and no longer watch\
  \ over them, meaning their souls feed no one!&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>Caligni combatants\
  \ are split into distinct societal and battlefield roles, such as stalkers, callers,\
  \ and vanguards, and many other roles.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>The last piece of the\
  \ caligni puzzle is the owbs, strange ancient beings from the Netherworld who caligni\
  \ have come to worship and obey. These powerful creatures guide and manipulate caligni\
  \ to do their bidding. Whether the owbs are manifestations of the ancient Forsaken,\
  \ or simply imposters, is shrouded in mystery.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ skulker, and agile and deadly foe</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Building\
  \ out Battlefield Roles&nbsp;</h3>\n      <p>With a clear definition of who caligni\
  \ are, BKOM could start designing their game mechanics. Rather than being regular\
  \ combatants, they wanted each caligni unit to be cohesive but unusual, challenging\
  \ players in new ways:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Skulkers:</strong>&nbsp;The\
  \ prototypical members of caligni forces. They fight like rogues, zip in and out\
  \ of combat, and whittle away at the heroes. Players will need agility, precision,\
  \ and teamwork to corner the skulkers and take them out efficiently.</li>\n    \
  \   <li><strong>Vanguard:</strong> These are designed to be slow, powerful juggernauts\
  \ who shake the battlefield with their heavy greatsword strikes. Their presence\
  \ forces heroes to maneuver around the battlefield to avoid devastating blows.</li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Callers:</strong>&nbsp;The “support types” of the caligni forces:\
  \ deadly glass-cannon priests who cripple the heroes with dark magics borrowed from\
  \ their owb masters, while empowering their caligni allies to greater heights of\
  \ ferocity.</li>\n       <li><strong>Owbs:</strong>&nbsp;Powerful elite ranged enemies\
  \ who use their shadowy “Curse of Darkness” to obliterate heroes from afar. Owbs\
  \ will reposition when approached, hiding behind caligni servants. When an owb is\
  \ on the battlefield, the heroes must pay attention to its attacks or be wiped out\
  \ by its shadow magic instantly.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>BKOM noted that these\
  \ designs will evolve throughout implementation and testing, so we look forward\
  \ seeing the final versions on the battlefield!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>An Explosive\
  \ Finale&nbsp;</h3>\n      <p>One of the most defining aspects of caligni is how\
  \ they die. Thanks to a nasty pact made ages ago, when a caligni falls, they explode\
  \ in a burst of flame and light.</p>\n      <p>This aspect was key for translating\
  \ over into the gameplay. When a caligni is defeated, a small AoE preview is displayed\
  \ that heroes must escape (usually with a dodge) to avoid suffering a burst of damage\
  \ and crowd control.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>But after playtesting, BKOM quickly saw\
  \ how easy it is to go overboard with the death blasts! They were constantly stunning,\
  \ killing, de-buffing, and displacing the heroes. This is especially a problem when\
  \ swarmed by caligni in the cramped corridors of the Darklands.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4f94f122-9823-48e8-a656-fdf9ea454fa5/ExplodingCaligni_GIF_Watermarked.gif\"\

  \       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Don’t get caught in the blast!</p>\n     \
  \ </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>However, this element was too central to their identity\
  \ to simply abandon. Instead, the designers carefully dialed down the severity of\
  \ the death blasts until they provided the right balance of punishment and player\
  \ agency. Now, taking out a caligni still means being ready to roll out, but won’\
  t lead to being pinballed around into five different explosions while your HP bar\
  \ empties out.</p>\n      <p>Ultimately, the “combined arms” dynamic and unusual\
  \ mechanics of caligni are intended to force a new and unique challenge for heroes\
  \ arriving in the Darklands. Their unusual fighting style should push Pathfinders\
  \ to try new strategies and master calignis’ strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Art Vision and Pipeline&nbsp;</h3>\n      <p>Switching to\
  \ the visual representation, Art Director Jonathan Dufresne described the process\
  \ of bringing caligni to life.</p>\n      <p>Getting the visual design right always\
  \ starts by looking at the source material. References and inspiration come directly\
  \ from the books and other Paizo artwork.</p>\n      <p>At the current stage of\
  \ production, BKOM’s art pipeline is well defined. It starts with reference gathering,\
  \ then moves to a front-and-back-view sketch. A balance is struck between retaining\
  \ key elements of the original design while adapting them to the game’s vision.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/59ee00b5-58bd-4200-8427-b15e3669fd8c/Caligni_Phase1_Watermarked_2000.jpg\"\

  \ showing a basic 3 Dimensional model with minimal details to a fully designed model\

  \ 13px;\">Adding details to the initial 3D render</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <p>During review, proportions are checked, making sure they’re exaggerated\
  \ enough to read well from a top-down perspective. Each enemy and character must\
  \ feel unique in their silhouette for quick recognition by the player. Small details\
  \ are also minimized to keep the visuals easy to read. Throughout the process, the\
  \ Art team consults Game Design to ensure the enemy visually matches in-game behavior.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The next stage is 3D blocking. The goal here is to validate proportions\
  \ directly in-game with proper camera angles. As always, reading well in the context\
  \ of the game is a priority before moving to polish. Animation can also get started\
  \ using the 3D blocking, before we even get the final models.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ last step is the detailed, textured enemy to bring everything together. While\
  \ there’s room for feedback and minor changes, most of it has already been approved\
  \ and implemented in previous steps.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Design</h3>\n      <p>Applying this process to an example like the caligni skulker\
  \ shows the method in practice. Taking the original references to inform the concept\
  \ art, the team matches the original intent closely. Changes mostly take the form\
  \ of adjustments to the proportions to suit the game’s other enemies and overall\
  \ art direction.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ to the basic 3-D version on the character with no details, to the detailed version\
  \ of the model, and then finally a fully rendered model of the character wearing\
  \ tattered clothes with their hood up over their head.\"></a>\n       <p style=\"\

  \ are often deliberately oversized. Even though the original design has a dagger,\
  \ BKOM’s 3D model is larger to make it easier to see during gameplay.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Animation and VFX focused on making the skulker feel nimble and evasive, using\
  \ effects like the smoke grenade. By this stage, all the pieces come together and\
  \ bring the character to life.</p>\n      <p>Thanks for checking out Wyatt and Jonathan’\
  s breakdown of their approach to translating caligni from the TTRPG to their game.\
