  \ itemprop=\"description\">By the time you read this, I will have returned from\
  \ my first physical convention as a Paizo employee! I’ll be flying to Minneapolis\
  \ with Tonya to attend SkålCon and I’m very excited about it. I’m writing this blog\
  \ before the trip, so I don’t have any stories to tell, but ask future Alex (which,\
  \ again, will be present Alex once you read this) about it!</p> \n      <p>Back\
  \ when I was hired, which the calendar insists was only 20 months ago, I expected\
  \ to be traveling a lot more than I have so far. I will admit the introverted, awkward\
  \ part of me (that’s all of me) is glad I met the community online, where I’m much\
  \ funnier and able to log off when I need to. Still, there’s something about physical\
  \ gaming that I’ve missed, the energy is different online (but the prep’s a lot\
  \ easier, so it’s a trade-off)!</p> \n      <p>Hopefully in 2022 I’ll be able to\
  \ attend more shows and meet more people in-person, but I suspect the landscape\
  \ has changed in ways we can’t expect. Until then, I look forward to more online\
  \ games with all of you!</p> \n      <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> \n    \
  \  <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available November 19, 2021:</p> \n\
  \      <h3>Pathfinder</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ako?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-305-Inheritors-Rite\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-05: Inheritor's Rite*</a><br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02al0?Pathfinder-Bounty-16-Boom-Town-Betrayal\"\
  >Pathfinder Bounty #16: Boom Town Betrayal</a></p> \n      <h3>Starfinder</h3> \n\
  \      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02akt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-411-A-Worlds-Ambition\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #4-11: A World's Ambition*</a></p> \n      <p><em>*part\
  \ of a subscription</em></p> \n      <h2>Starfinder Society Fame Updates</h2> \n\
  \      <p>Earlier this year, we announced that Starfinder Society would be transitioning\
  \ to the Achievement Points system, and that Fame would be disappearing. This sparked\
  \ several questions to which we promised answers.</p> \n      <p>Good news, I have\
  \ answers for you! But you’ll have to wait a little longer for them. There’s a second\
  \ blog scheduled later today that’s dedicated entirely to that topic, to keep everything\
  \ in one place. So, hang tight and we’ll circle back to this topic later!</p> \n\
  \      <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n      <p>First, the bad news: I have no new rulebook\
  \ content to share with you at this time. I know everybody is eager to get their\
  \ hands on guns, gears, and everything for sale in the Grand Bazaar, but we simply\
  \ haven’t had the time to take a look at it yet. It’s the top of our priority list\
  \ once the schedule crunch lets up, we promise.</p> \n      <p>Now, while we don’\
  t have rules content for you, we do have some newly sanctioned adventures! For Pathfinder\
  \ (second edition), <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027o0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Night-of-the-Gray-Death\"\
  ><em>Night of the Gray Death</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02anr/discuss?Pathfinder-OneShot-3-Head-Shot-the-Rot\"\
  ><em>Head-Shot the Rot</em></a> are both sanctioned for play. You can find the sanctioning\
  \ documents on their product pages. For Starfinder, we’ll have the next one-shot,\
  \ <em>The Great Grav-Train Robbery</em>, sanctioned by the time it releases.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>And finally, for our Pathfinder (first edition) players, the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>\
  \ is now sanctioned for play! We know it’s been a long time coming; we tried to\
  \ get it out at the same time the Owlcat game released, but the best laid plans\
  \ of ysoki and men, etc, etc. The chronicles for this AP can be applied to a character\
  \ of <em>any</em> level as well!</p> \n      <p>My goal is that by this time next\
  \ month, we’ll have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"\
  ><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em></a> sanctioned... just in time for the December\
  \ releases! Hooray!</p> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n      <p>Whether stars,\
  \ novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial\
  \ amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which\
  \ at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run\
  \ between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative\
  \ estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n  \
  \    <p>This month, we had one GM reach their fifth star for Pathfinder Society\
  \ (first edition) and one reach their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>5th Star</b>: Jason Thuel<br> <b>5th Nova</b> Stephan V</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs and thank you for your dedication! If\
  \ you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email\
  \ us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> \n      <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n  \
  \    <p>Winter tends to be our quiet time for conventions, but that doesn’t mean\
  \ our schedule is entirely silent! We’ve still got plenty of great events, both\
  \ online and in-person. Check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\"\
  >conventions calendar</a> for a full list and be sure to click on the events for\
  \ more details.</p> \n      <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! </p>\
