  >back in November</a> we first announced the idea of Faction Journal Cards, a new\
  \ way to contribute to your faction's goals while also being able to experience\
  \ the fun of factions in any adventure—even sanctioned Modules and Adventure Paths.\
  \ Mike and I have both released some spoilers since then, showing off bits and pieces\
  \ of the Silver Crusade's card to illustrate how the cards work.</p> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ pleased to announce that the <a href=\"/products/btpy9dgw\">Faction Journal Cards\
  \ are now available for download</a> and use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play!\
  \ The download includes an introduction explaining how to use the cards, but I'll\
  \ also break the main concepts into a quick Q&amp;A here.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Do I have to do anything special to get a Faction Journal Card?</b><br>\
  \ Nope, you get one for free so long as you are a member of the faction. These cards\
  \ are 100% voluntary, so you can ignore them if you want.</p> \n      <p><b>How\
  \ do they work?</b><br> Let me summarize this quickly. Each card has three boons\
  \ that your character can earn by completing certain goals on the back of the card.\
  \ If you fulfill one of the goals during an adventure, you get to check one of the\
  \ goal's checkboxes when you're receiving your Chronicle sheet. You unlock the boons\
  \ based on how many goal's you have completed.</p> \n      <p><b>I am the GM more\
  \ often than I play. Do these cards offer me anything?</b><br> Yes, there is a special\
  \ faction goal that appears on each card and rewards a participant when she is the\
  \ GM and applies the Chronicle sheet to that character. To get the full benefits\
  \ of the card, you'll still need to play, but at least you're not missing important\
  \ opportunities by applying GM credit to a character.</p> \n      <p><b>Some of\
  \ these goals are really open-ended. Is that on purpose?</b><br> Yes. As noted,\
  \ some are open-ended and others are very precise, and that's by design. It broadens\
  \ the opportunities that PCs have to pursue these objectives, rather than forcing\
  \ them to cherry-pick the one or two scenarios that would work—even tougher if you've\
  \ already played that adventure. What this means is that there is a little GM interpretation\
  \ involved in whether or not a PC actually fulfilled an objective. The Faction Journal\
  \ Cards' introductory page advises GMs to err on the side of leniency when making\
  \ that call.</p> \n      <p><b>One Liberty's Edge goal requires me to free slaves.\
  \ Can I just find a random slaver, beat him up, and profit?</b><br> No, those conditions\
  \ need to be part of the adventure you're playing. If the scenario involves slaves\
  \ or other captives already, get ready to check off a box. If a scenario doesn't\
  \ involve them, save it for another day. Remember that these goals (and cards) are\
  \ supposed to be minimally disruptive to the game, and starting a fight that's not\
  \ part of the adventure puts a burden on the GM and steals the spotlight from the\
  \ other players.</p> \n      <p><b>I changed my faction after earning a few boons.\
  \ What happens?</b><br> When you change your faction, you lose all benefits of any\
  \ other faction's card.</p> \n      <p><b>I completely filled out my Faction Journal\
  \ Card. Now what?</b><br> The good news is that we're hoping to release updated\
  \ card sets for future seasons, each with some familiar goals and some new ones.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>I would also like to thank both our new assistant\
  \ developer Linda Zayas-Palmer for her valuable assistance in finishing this project\
  \ and a local group of venture-officers and Pathfinder Society enthusiasts who have\
  \ provided important feedback and playtesting as we have played through <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8yqx\"><em>The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em></a>.</p> \n     <p>Get\
  \ going and download the <a href=\"/products/btpy9dgw\">Faction Journal Cards</a>!\
  \ I'm excited to hear what you think of these!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
