  \ blog post from one of our farthest-flung Pathfinder Society lodges in the world.\
  \ From what I have been told, there has not been much of any kind of organized play,\
  \ outside of Magic: The Gathering, in South Africa ever. When I saw one of our RPG\
  \ Superstar hotshots was running Pathfinder Society there, I knew I had to reach\
  \ out to him. I can’t say I ever expected to have Pathfinder Society coordinated\
  \ anywhere on the African continent, except maybe in Egypt, so I was thrilled when\
  \ Jerall accepted the Venture-Captain position after a series of emails.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Without further ado, I present to you Jerall’s report on Pathfinder South\
  \ Africa.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>South Africa is home to a varied mix\
  \ of peoples, cultures, and eleven official languages. It is a strange country with\
  \ a blend of beautiful natural spaces, burgeoning metropolises, and incredible wealth\
  \ alongside abject poverty.</p> \n     <p>South African roleplayers are an eclectic\
  \ bunch, each bringing a unique collection of experiences to the table. People from\
  \ all over the world, including, historically, greater Africa, Asia, and Europe,\
  \ have settled in South Africa—not too dissimilar from a real-world Absalom. It’\
  s in this space that my fellow volunteers and I hope to grow the South African Pathfinder\
  \ Society Lodge.</p> \n     <p>Earlier this year, Mike Brock noticed that we had\
  \ begun reporting a few South African events each month. Mike contacted us through\
  \ our event organizer email addresses and, a few emails later, we were well on our\
  \ way to formalizing and growing Pathfinder Society Organized Play in Cape Town,\
  \ and later Durban, and even ICON 2012, South Africa’s biggest convention in Johannesburg.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Classified as megadiverse, South Africa is a large country, encompassing\
  \ nine different provinces, featuring eight major terrestrial biomes, and over 1.2\
  \ million square kilometers. At the moment, my two Venture-Lieutenants and I are\
  \ focusing on three areas in particular: Cape Town and the Western Cape, Durban\
  \ in Kwa-Zulu Natal, and the Gauteng province, which includes both Pretoria and\
  \ Johannesburg.</p> \n     <p>Roleplaying has a long history in South Africa, with\
  \ our older conventions well into their second or third decades of existence. Traditionally\
  \ though, any sort of gaming was only available to a rather small percentage of\
  \ our total population. A few years ago, we saw many of our small game retailers\
  \ shutting their doors. Now, however, South Africa is experiencing some sort of\
  \ gaming renaissance with video-, board-, card-, and roleplaying gaming seeing a\
  \ major upswing. New distribution channels are opening up regularly and gaming is\
  \ slowly becoming cheaper and more accessible to a larger portion of our population.\
  \ These days, you’ll even see numerous social outreach programs built around gaming—\
  something that I’d like to see happen with Pathfinder Society South Africa too.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I organize and run a game day on every second Saturday at Fanaticus\
  \ Hobbies and Games in Cape Town. In Durban, my Venture-Lieutenant, Paul, organizes\
  \ and runs a game day once a month at the brand-new The Unseen Shoppe. At the moment\
  \ we’re still a bit small—Cape Town sees about two tables per game day; Durban,\
  \ one. The stores are particularly supportive, offering free use of their venues.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Of course, I’d like to see Pathfinder spread throughout the country.\
  \ In Johannesburg, I have managed to arrange space at stores there, but we sorely\
  \ lack for GMs in Gauteng. If you know of any Gauteng GMs looking for some help\
  \ in setting up a regular game, send me an email and I’ll see if I can help kick\
  \ off some regular games there. In fact, if you know of (or are) a GM, anywhere\
  \ in the country, drop me a message and I’ll see about getting you started.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To find out more about the Durban scene, contact Paul at pathfindersadbn@gmail.com.\

  \ an awesome Pathfinder Society Lodge in South Africa. I look forward to the additions\
  \ of new Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants in other regions of the country\
  \ and watching Pathfinder Society grow strong. Keep up the awesome work!</p> \n\
