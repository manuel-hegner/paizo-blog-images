  artist: "the crown in the upper right corner. The harrower lays the cards in a three-by-three\
    \ divinatory grid matching time (past, present, and future) to the Law/Chaos alignment\
    \ axis. After all, the past (represented by Law) is most fixed and difficult (although\
    \ not impossible) to change, while the future (represented by Chaos) is infinitely\
    \ changeable. Similarly, the Good/Evil axis came to represent positive, neutral,\
    \ and negative situations for the person whose questions the harrower is answering.\
    \ The good section of the grid represents the positive, while the evil section\
    \ reflects negative outcomes. This basic grid presents the harrower with a solid\
    \ framework to begin doing readings, but the nuances of the cards are evocative\
    \ and expansive enough to let a capable harrower use them in many situationsâ€”\
    both in game and out. Take a look for yourself and see if you agree. Teeuwynn\
    \ Woodruff Harrow Designer"
