  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Shifts change every eight\
  \ hours in Lim City. During the hour or two linking shifts, the cavern city’s lights\
  \ seemingly flare even brighter as thousands of workers simultaneously emerge from\
  \ their places of work, recreation, and rest. Technically no day or night exists\
  \ here. When I first arrived, I learned to get used to the concept that my existence\
  \ in this city, much like other places in Apostae, boils down to working and not\
  \ working. Anyone not at the top of one of the dark elves’ noble houses spends most\
  \ of their time making credits, and the rest of their time losing what they earn.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I wordlessly join a flock of commuters, mainly dark elves with the smattering\
  \ of orc-kin and off-worlders, packing into a hover shuttle. The cacophony of thrusters,\
  \ constant foot traffic, and tired chatter building up and then coming down during\
  \ these commutes brings a loud peace with it. I adjust my visor and tighten the\
  \ scarf around my face, concealing the cyan glowing streaks marking my face. I keep\
  \ my arms wrapped around a large, rectangular case as I park beside a window.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Thanks to a gracious subsidy from the Betterment Council, most inhabitants\
  \ travel through Lim City using some sort of shuttle service or by taking the covered\
  \ ramps and paths linking district hubs. Using either is cheap or free, depending\
  \ on employer agreements with the Council—which most companies have, even the illegal\
  \ ones—and no one complains about spending less to get around.</p> \n     <p>I scan\
  \ the space outside the window as more vehicles fall in line to avoid collisions\
  \ amid the bustle. We zoom past skyscraper after skyscraper, separated by smaller\
  \ clusters of buildings demarcated with metallic fences and pseudo-crystalline towers.\
  \ Our surroundings grow dim as we pass under the shadow of House Zeizerer’s spire.\
  \ This tower, as well as the other houses’, dwarfs even the most ambitious of the\
  \ nearby high-rise buildings and spans to the utmost height of the cavern, though\
  \ tinted glass panes and slate-colored plates block any view into the interior.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Approaching a commercial district, a sleek hover car catches\
  \ my attention. Colorful decals—most especially the pattern of rippling red and\
  \ purple flames—primp the black-painted body of the vehicle, an imported model from\
  \ a few years back. Many workers strive for this display of wealth, though more\
  \ importantly, the design matches my contractor’s provided info. </p> \n     <p>As\
  \ if on cue, a text from said contractor appears on my burner comm unit: “IS IT\
  \ DONE?”</p> \n     <p>I read the message but return my attention to the hover car\
  \ instead of responding. The shuttle keeps pace with it until the smaller vehicle\
  \ veers into a parking facility near Meseria Market. </p> \n     <p>At the next\
  \ stop, the passengers almost completely abandon the shuttle, and I join them as\
  \ they scatter into the shopping center. Time frame in mind, I restrain myself from\
  \ ogling at the Arabani Arms outlet store, where a pair of dark elf guards flaunt\
  \ the most recent Karkaken models while keeping watch over the premises. Most market\
  \ establishments host at least a hired muscle or two; would-be customers, who simply\
  \ come to unwind after a day of painstaking and likely dangerous work, typically\
  \ pay them little mind.</p> \n     <p>Compared to other settlements, Lim City has\
  \ a “generous” token system to pay for utilities—like power and water. Air too,\
  \ though I never needed it. Everyone in the city can earn a pool of tokens to spend\
  \ exclusively on those utilities at special rates, accumulated based on hours they\
  \ work for participating companies. The system gives the average citizen some breathing\
  \ room, both literal and metaphorical, which often leaves them extra credits to\
  \ spend each pay day, even after deductions mandated by the Council.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Holo-boards line the walls between stores, giving contrast to the otherwise\
  \ gray plating. Some advertise new commodities—a pocket decoupler eventually pays\
  \ for itself. Other boards share favorable news from around the Pact Worlds. One,\
  \ however, features my current employer, Almieera Zeizerer; this instance, she lends\
  \ her face to an advert lauding the Betterment Council for recently adding gravity\
  \ modulation to the token system. How considerate.</p> \n     <p>After all, we still\
  \ live on Apostae. Lim City belongs to the dark elves as much as Nightarch does,\
  \ though arguably with more even stakes as the houses divided the Council. What\
  \ matters is that they give the drones—their workers—alternate ways to financially\
  \ trap themselves here. There’s a Meseria Market in every corner of this city, just\
  \ with different names. The semblance of comfort with their basic living expenses\
  \ tempts people into spending credits for something nice, rather than something\
  \ needed. Like some social experiment, the houses create new ways to keep their\
  \ workers content enough to stay in Lim City and, more importantly, to stay profitable.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At first, I tried playing by these rules, but two shifts each “day”\
  \ with nothing to actually show for the effort frustrated me to no end. Maybe another\
  \ life could’ve taken that grind. I refused, especially when looking closely at\
  \ the numbers. I knew I’d rather get the pay elsewhere than have my “legit” credits\
  \ go to a pseudo-public subsidiary. </p> \n     <p>I elbow past a group gawking\
  \ at the boards, ignoring the flustered swears from behind me. Then, I round the\
  \ corner into the food court and head straight into a half-empty establishment called\
  \ Deeplight Eats—an unassuming deli that doubles as one of the Zeizerer’s many fronts\
  \ in Lim City.</p> \n     <p>The manager, a half-orc woman called Hevra, greets\
  \ me. “Hey, Reverb. You here for a…?” Her gaze lingers on my case.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ wave at her. “Yeah. Be back in about an hour. Prep the usual.” I proceed to the\
  \ backroom. Like digital clockwork, I take the stairs to the rooftop and then climb\
  \ beyond, outside the frames of the open-air market’s bubble—I’d argue against an\
  \ artificial bubble being “open air.” I dip into vacuum territory for a few minutes,\
  \ where I cross multiple buildings before slipping back into the enclosed space\
  \ at the parking facility’s rooftop. </p> \n     <p>After double checking my spot,\
  \ I ensure that the cameras are dead like my contractor promised. Satisfied, I assemble\
  \ my rifle from the parts case, giving the scope a quick polish before securing\
  \ it. Then, I survey the area.</p> \n     <p>After a few minutes, I spot the target:\
  \ Raxikz Veresvi, recently appointed by Zeizerer Munitions to oversee a chain of\
  \ outlet stores. Silver hair sleeked back and dressed in a burgundy suit that perfectly\
  \ wraps around his slender figure, he matches my employer’s description, down to\
  \ the oversized purple-tinted cufflinks. Supposedly, Veresvi elevated himself by\
  \ charming a certain company official. The human woman beside him, however, is definitely\
  \ not Almieera Zeizerer, his supposed flame. With that, I piece together the motive\
  \ for this contract, though dark elves having fickle—and vengeful—hearts seems hardly\
  \ surprising.</p> \n     <p>I line up my sight.</p> \n     <p>The pair shows no\
  \ indication of a relation, not even a greedy touch of the hand or an unwarranted\
  \ smile. Half an hour into surveillance, the lights begin to dim, the rush from\
  \ the shift change ebbing. Veresvi takes his company to a nearby restaurant. I lose\
  \ vision for a few minutes, but they reappear at the rooftop. A waiter seats them,\
  \ hands them their menus, and provides them each a drink. I watch him pull the chair\
  \ out for her, smiling as he speaks. When he settles in his seat, I aim my crosshairs\
  \ at his head. A contract is a contract.</p> \n     <p>I pull the trigger.</p> \n\
  \     <p>His body launches off the seat, but I’m already on the move before it hits\
  \ the ground. Picking up my rifle and my case, I retrace my way to Deeplight Eats.\
  \ I head down the staircase but stop midway to disassemble my rifle, returning it\
  \ to its case.</p> \n     <p>A communication request pings on my burner. As soon\
  \ as I accept, a curt, feminine voice states, “Is it done, Reverb?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Yes. The target has been eliminated.”</p> \n     <p>“Your payment has been arranged.”\
  \ The line cuts off.</p> \n     <p>I stare at the comm unit before smashing it on\
  \ a step. I seal my case, dispose of the comm’s remnants, and finally sit down at\
  \ the deli for my first meal in 24 hours.</p> \n     <p>Most people come to Lim\
  \ City for the prospect of stability in survival, even if it means committing to\
  \ a cycle that traps them on Apostae. All the while they believe the next shift\
  \ might just lead to prosperity. Then, there are those like me. I stay because I\
  \ make credits gambling outside the system, so long as politics or pettiness demand\
  \ someone gets offed—which will be always. I settle for a toasted sandwich now,\
  \ but unlike the drones, I can look forward to a new hover car after only a few\
  \ more contracts.</p> \n     <p>Eventually, I step out of the building, case slung\
  \ over my back.</p> \n     <p>It takes me less than a second to notice the glint\
  \ of the scope from a rooftop.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
