  >The Devastation Ark AP</a> is the first adventure Paizo has produced for Starfinder\
  \ aimed at characters beyond 12th level. High-level play can be challenging for\
  \ a GM in any system, and Starfinder is no different, but Starfinder also poses\
  \ some specific concerns.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ \n      <h3>Require Abilities, Don't Block Them</h3> \n      <p>High level characters\
  \ have access to story-breaking abilities. They can safely perform reconnaissance\
  \ with arcane eye or infiltrate a base with perfect shape-changing disguises. They\
  \ can read the minds of their enemies or cast <em>dominate person</em>. They can\
  \ banish powerful outsiders to their home planes and even teleport to another planet.\
  \ And, of course, they can come back from the dead.</p> \n      <p>It’s tempting\
  \ to design adventures that prevent the PCs from using these abilities, inserting\
  \ <em>walls of force</em> that block teleportation, for example, or zones of antimagic\
  \ to prevent divination spells. After all, that makes the adventure much easier\
  \ to write and more like the adventures we usually read and play through—but that’\
  s exactly why we shouldn’t do it. High level play should feel special. Your players\
  \ have worked their way up through a dozen levels, over months or even years of\
  \ play, in order to get access to these special abilities—let them use them!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Instead, write the adventure so that the PCs <em>must</em> use these\
  \ abilities to succeed. To give just one obvious example, the PCs might need to\
  \ reach a computer located in a room that is inaccessible to ordinary people. It’\
  s buried 100 feet down in solid rock, with no doors, no windows, no access at all.\
  \ But a group of PCs with <em>clairvoyance</em> and <em>teleport</em> can get there,\
  \ and now you have an adventure where only high level characters can succeed, which\
  \ is exactly what your players want.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Be Ready To Improvise</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>As characters progress in level, they gain access to more and more\
  \ abilities; it soon becomes impossible for the GM to keep track of these abilities\
  \ or anticipate them. So don’t try! When the PCs are high level, you can create\
  \ a problem without knowing for certain how the PCs will solve it—just trust that\
  \ they’ll come up with something and be open-minded when they do. For example, let’\
  s go back to that room surrounded by solid rock. What if the PCs don’t have <em>teleport</em>?\
  \ Well, they’ve got plenty of other abilities, and the credits to spare. There’\
  s probably a way they can tunnel through the rock, go incorporeal, or otherwise\
  \ get into this “impossible” room. You don’t have to worry about how they’ll get\
  \ in; let them figure it out, and then reward them when they do.</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h3>Skill DCS</h3> \n      <p>As characters advance in Starfinder, their\
  \ skill bonuses improve, but operatives get better at skills than every other class.\
  \ Inevitably you’ll reach a point where a skill DC that is challenging for an operative—\
  one in which the player has to roll a 15 or better to succeed—is impossible for\
  \ everyone else. Even if your player characters include an operative, keep an eye\
  \ on these skill DCs and set them at a number your player characters can reasonably\
  \ hit. Be generous with aid another attempts, so that even when the other characters\
  \ can’t hit the DC themselves, they can at least contribute to the operative’s check.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>There’s a lot more that could be said about high level adventures\
  \ for Starfinder, but the tips here should get you started making and running solid\
  \ stories for your players, in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/devastationArk\"\
