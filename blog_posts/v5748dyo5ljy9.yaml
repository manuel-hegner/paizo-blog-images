  description\"><i>The creed of the Exo-Guardians is to protect the Pact Worlds from\
  \ external threats. In the context of their membership within the Starfinder Society,\
  \ this most often relates to participating in missions to acquire relics or technology\
  \ of a defensive nature. Exo-Guardians excel in missions that lead to such discoveries,\
  \ but they also serve an important secondary role within the Society of \"sending\
  \ a message\" to threats that interfere in Society business. Be it a derelict starship\
  \ overrun with mindless alien vermin, or a supposedly impenetrable fortress operated\
  \ by forces opposed to the Society, it's often the Exo-Guardians who come in to\
  \ handle the situation.</i></p> \n    <p>One thing was clear when developing factions\
  \ for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: some players just want to shoot\
  \ bug-like aliens. The Exo-Guardians were one of the earliest factions we developed\
  \ because we wanted players to have a faction with a clear goal that fit into a\
  \ science fantasy universe. In the case of the Exo-Guardians, that goal is \"make\
  \ sure bad aliens don't punch us in the face, possibly by punching those aliens\
  \ in the face (or other appropriate body part, in the case of aliens without faces)\
  \ first.\" This is the faction that you can regularly expect to see going on a \"\
  bug hunt.\"</p> \n    <p>The Exo-Guardians have some recognizable elements of the\
  \ highly successful Silver Crusade faction from Pathfinder Society, but there are\
  \ several key differences. The Exo-Guardians are also a faction with a long history\
  \ within the in-game Starfinder Society organization, but recent events have not\
  \ been kind to them. In a setting without paladins as a core class, the Exo-Guardians\
  \ are somewhat more flexible in terms of what they are willing to do to protect\
  \ the Pact Worlds from external threats. The Exo-Guardians let us explore some tough\
  \ questions, like how far would you go to protect your home from external threats?</p>\

  \   <p><i>Illustration by Sebastian Rodriguez</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Luckily,\
  \ if you're worried about this faction quickly becoming a faction of bloodthirsty\
  \ evil characters, the Exo-Guardians faction leader has your back. Zigvigix (LG\
  \ host shirren soldier) is a shirren with a planâ€”specifically a plan that aims to\
  \ have the Exo-Guardians restored to their pre-Scoured Stars incident grandeur.\
  \ I am already excited at how Zigvigix has turned out in print, and pretty soon\
  \ you'll be able to meet them in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>.\
  \ (And if you're worried about pronouncing Zigvigix's name all the time, don't fret.\
  \ The Commencement's author, Eleanor Ferron, already coined a nickname I think will\
  \ catch on...)</p> \n    <p>Before I go, here's a look at one of the faction-specific\
  \ boons that members of the Exo-Guardians can purchase with their Fame. If you haven't\
  \ already checked, I highly recommend giving that a read over <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljxe?A-Game-of-Boons\"\
  >last week's blog on Starfinder Society Boons</a>.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Collector and Examiner (Ally Boon)</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block\">The Exo-Guardians host a variety of professionals interested\
  \ in researching alien life from the Vast. You've become associated with one such\
  \ researcher.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Exo-Guardians:\
  \ Tier 1</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b>: 2 Fame</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: This ally boon represents a growing relationship\
  \ between you and a researcher among the Exo-Guardians. At the end of a scenario\
  \ in which you've slotted this boon, you can return one, and only one, \"mostly\
  \ intact\" cadaver of a defeated significant enemy (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>\
  \ 242) that your ally can study. Mark the creature type (such as aberration, fey,\
  \ or ooze) of the collected cadaver on your Chronicle sheet. While this boon is\
  \ slotted, you gain an insight bonus to Engineering, Life Science and Mysticism\
  \ skill checks to identify creatures of the same creature type as previously collected\
  \ corpses. The bonus is equal to the number of corpses of that creature type collected,\
  \ up to a maximum of 3. The bonus represents your access to correspondences between\
  \ you and your examiner ally; it does not mean the examiner is physically present\
  \ during the adventure.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I'm really excited to see\
  \ exactly what sort of wacky concepts players come up with for their \"Examiner\"\
  \ allies!</p> \n    <p>That's all for this week. Stay tuned for next week's blog,\
  \ where we provide an overview and some details for our next faction: the Second\
  \ Seekers!</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p>\
