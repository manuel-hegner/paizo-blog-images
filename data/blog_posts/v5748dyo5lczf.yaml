  \ Lucien Soulban</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Two: Idle Hands</h2> \n    <p> \"Ohhh,\"\
  \ Fife groaned. He tried moving, but the world refused to comply, spinning underneath\
  \ him the way it did. His bones ached and his skin felt like someone had rubbed\
  \ it with the uncomfortable side of a bar of pumice. He opened his eyes and stared\
  \ up at the sky—specifically, at the distant hole in the ceiling that revealed the\
  \ wet gray skies of Andoran.</p> \n    <p>\"That's right...\" Memories began to\
  \ fall back into place for the halfling. The desperate townsfolk who bought their\
  \ fake luck charms. The murder of farmers. The ruined necromancer's manse. And...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"The hand!\" Fife sat up from his throne of rubble, looking for the\
  \ amputated hand that had sheared Darvin's rope and sent them both tumbling through\
  \ the weakened floor into the darkness below the manse's basement. He saw no sign\
  \ of the hand in the brick-lined cistern, but dark waters and shadows lapped at\
  \ the islands of debris and ribs of shattered timber. Darvin lay atop one of the\
  \ mounds, eyes closed and body utterly still.</p> \n    <p>\"Darvin!\" Fife scrambled\
  \ over to his compatriot. Darvin didn't respond, even after Fife pulled at the lapels\
  \ of his beaten leather coat. Left with little recourse, Fife drew back his arm\
  \ and slapped Darvin hard enough for the sound to echo through the cistern.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"OW!\" Darvin shrieked, his eyes flying open. Fife, however, did not\
  \ let go. \"Fife! What in—?</p> \n    <p>\"You know those moments in the story when\
  \ one hero thinks the other dead, begs him not to die and shares some deep personal\
  \ truth?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Vaguely,\" Darvin said.</p> \n    <p>\"And then it turns\
  \ out the other one was only faking his injuries?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, yeah?\" Darvin\
  \ said, this time a touch sheepishly.</p> \n    <p>\"This is not one of those moments,\"\
  \ Fife said, shaking his brother.</p> \n    <p>Darvin did nothing to stop him. \"\
  But I love those moments.\"</p> \n    <p>Fife let go of Darvin's coat and stood.\
  \ \"You weren't unconscious.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <center>\n\
  \      <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Fife.jpg\" border=\"0\"\
  >\n     </center>\n     <br> \"Fife is rarely the hero of his own stories.\"\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>\"I'm hurt you'd think that,\" Darvin responded, propping himself\
  \ up on an elbow and cradling his aggrieved cheek.</p> \n    <p>\"Darvin,\" Fife\
  \ warned, looking around. They were well and deep under the manse, the walls too\
  \ sheer to scale. He leapt to another small island to get a look at a nearby passageway.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I just want to be held!\" Darvin called after him.</p> \n    <p>Fife\
  \ ignored his brother. \"The hand...?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p>\"Somewhere up there,\
  \ no?\" Darvin stood and dusted himself off. Fife could tell he was trying to act\
  \ unworried, but it was still an act.</p> \n    <p>\"Let's hope so,\" Fife said;\
  \ a shiver tore through him.</p> \n    <p>\"It's not really a spider, y'know.\"\
  \ Darvin said gently.</p> \n    <p>Fife waved away his friend's concern. They weren't\
  \ supposed to talk about the incident—before Darvin's mother adopted Fife as her\
  \ own and the pair became siblings. He had never told Darvin how his own mother\
  \ died, but his brother knew it involved a... a....</p> \n    <p>\"It's close enough,\"\
  \ Fife said, his voice cracking. He sniffed the air, smelling the earthy stench,\
  \ and pointed down the rounded corridor. \"There's a breeze coming from that direction.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You mean the breeze with the slightly pungent aroma of rotting meat?\"\
  \ Darvin grabbed the collar of Fife's jerkin and spun him in the direction of another\
  \ corridor. \"That's why we're going down the one that doesn't smell like Death's\
  \ warm armpit\"</p> \n    <p>\"Darvin—\"</p> \n    <p>But Darvin made his way, rather\
  \ awkwardly, along the small islands to the other corridor. He jumped into the cold\
  \ water at the head of the corridor and tried not to grimace as the brackish liquid\
  \ sloshed around his waist. \"Oh look!\" he said. \"I can stand here.\" He grinned\
  \ back at the halfling.</p> \n    <p>Fife glanced at the other corridor. Something\
  \ scrapped against rock with a light echo, the sound dying quickly. Darvin seemed\
  \ not to notice, but the halfling suddenly doubted the wisdom of his own choice.\
  \ Fife turned, took a few quick strides, and launched himself onto his brother's\
  \ back.</p> \n    <p>\"Changed your—\" Darvin began.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm keeping\
  \ the books dry, you oaf,\" Fife grumbled.</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\" Darvin said\
  \ as they waded into the waterlogged corridor with its irregular bricks.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The corridor eventually ended at a brick wall with a sluice gate at one\
  \ end and a moss-covered brick platform with a door to the right. The water reeked\
  \ of stagnation and decaying sewage. The door bulged out, the wood splintered and\
  \ cracked under weight.</p> \n    <p>They stood well to the side as Darvin struggled\
  \ to pull the wedged door open. When it finally gave, it popped with a rumbling\
  \ force that slammed Darvin into the wall. The stone and wood spine of a collapsed\
  \ ceiling tumbled out.</p> \n    <p>The pair examined the landslide a moment, noting\
  \ the gaps between timber beams and under larger rocks.</p> \n    <p>\"You can crawl\
  \ through there,\" Darvin said, pointing to one of the larger rabbit holes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What?!\" Fife shouted, barely stopping his voice from squeaking. \"\
  Why me? It's large enough for you, too.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Because you're tiny,\"\
  \ Darvin announced.</p> \n    <p>Fife glared at him. \"The gods curse you for that.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Are they tiny gods?\" Darvin asked, grinning.</p> \n    <p>Fife\
  \ didn't bother bruising his already soiled dignity, and instead removed his backpack,\
  \ shoving his cloak inside. \"Remember, if I die, it'll be on your head.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"It'll be a tiny funeral,\" Darvin said cheerfully.</p> \n    <p>The tunnel\
  \ was small. Not so tight that Fife felt pressed in, but not so wide that his breathing\
  \ didn't rabbit faster. Darvin would have a hell of a fit inside, and that made\
  \ Fife smile.</p> \n    <p>Obstructions jutted out at sharp angles. Fife crawled\
  \ over and under them, elbow over elbow, pulling and scraping skin, snagging clothing\
  \ and tearing fabric in small nicks. Every foot deeper into the burrow tightened\
  \ a fist around his chest, and panicked thoughts butterflied in his head. He stopped,\
  \ almost gasping, wanting to crawl back out before the tunnel snapped its teeth\
  \ around him.</p> \n    <p>He stared ahead and squinted; did the passage open up,\
  \ or was that the illusion of desperation? Fife wanted to push forward, but as he\
  \ watched, a shadow moved against shadow, pebbles clattering in its wake.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Something waited for him just past the opening. He froze.</p> \n    <p></p>\n\
  \    <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p> Darvin considered\
  \ lighting a torch to see better; Fife had vanished up ahead, the darkness swallowing\
  \ him up.</p> \n    <p>\"You okay up there?\" Darvin shouted down the throat of\
  \ the tunnel.</p> \n    <p>\"Shh!\" came the response.</p> \n    <p>\"You ‘shh!'\"\
  \ Darvin cried back. </p> \n    <p>\"SHHH!\" Fife hissed more urgently.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Darvin almost shouted back at his companion, but a splash caught his attention.\
  \ He spun around as more splashes followed, echoes that danced along the walls of\
  \ the tunnel and up his spine... then nothing.</p> \n    <p>Darvin tiptoed to the\
  \ edge of the platform. The dying ebb of waves lapped against the stone. Something\
  \ coursed under the water, casting ripples, heading straight for him.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Unbidden, his memory suddenly offered up a crystal-clear image of the severed\
  \ hand dancing on the fraying rope, finger-blades flickering.</p> \n    <p>Darvin\
  \ bolted for the small hole, shoving Fife's bag in first and crawling after it.\
  \ Rocks and the tips of broken timbers poked and jabbed him. The bag snagged and\
  \ he struggled to push it forward despite the tearing sound that followed. The tunnel\
  \ pressed against him, and he wrenched his shoulder pushing himself through. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Fife!\" Darvin shouted. </p> \n    <p>\"Shh!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Move!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"For the love of our mother, shh!\" Fife cried back.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Stop telling me to shush! The hand's behind me!\"</p> \n    <p>\"No it's not,\"\
  \ Fife shouted, far closer than Darvin would have thought. \"It's in front of us.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Behind!\" Darvin insisted. The bag hit resistance, and Darvin looked\
  \ up at the blackened soles of Fife's feet. Something scampered in the tunnel behind\
  \ Darvin, and more stones tumbled from their perch. He couldn't see past his own\
  \ body, however, and opted to push instead. </p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n \
  \    ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p> Fife felt something press against\
  \ his feet and almost shrieked in terror. He raised his head to see Darvin shoving\
  \ his bag—shoving Fife—toward the opening a handful of feet away and the noise that\
  \ had turned into an impatient clicking, like the tapping of metal fingers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No, Darvin!\" Fife shouted. He pressed his hands against the rocks\
  \ and kicked at the bag.</p> \n    <p>\"Stop that, you lout! Something's behind\
  \ me!\"</p> \n    <p>Before Fife could protest, Darvin gave another shove, sending\
  \ the halfling toward the hole and pinning his hands under his body, squashed tight\
  \ against rock.</p> \n    <p>The mummified hand leapt into the opening, its tensing\
  \ fingers covered in blades. Fife screamed. Darvin screamed in response, though\
  \ unlikely for the same reason. Or maybe it was. Fife didn't care.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ hand scampered forward on its fingers, and Fife struggled to free his arms. Darvin\
  \ pushed him another inch closer. The hand was, for the lack of better measurements,\
  \ only a handful of feet away.</p> \n    <p>Fife rolled to his side, pressing his\
  \ back painfully against the rubble until his arms popped free, his fingers aching\
  \ and bruised. The hand sprang toward him, fingers propelling it forward. Naturally,\
  \ Darvin pushed him again, screaming something about the thing at his feet and life\
  \ having failed his expectations. Fife couldn't reach the dirk at his belt, but\
  \ in the attempt his hand rubbed against the bamboo quill in his breast pocket.\
  \ He grabbed it and swung hard, stabbing the amputated hand as it came within an\
  \ inch of shaving his eyebrows.</p> \n    <p>Fife stabbed the hand again with the\
  \ sharp quill, his vision red pinpricks of focus and flushed hot with blood. Suddenly,\
  \ the lip of the tunnel loomed and he found popping free like a cork, shoved out\
  \ by a panicking Darvin. He barely had time to roll nimbly away before his human\
  \ companion came crashing down as well, almost crushing him.</p> \n    <p></p>\n\
  \    <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Darvin pushed to his\
  \ feet quickly, pulling on his sheathed dagger to defend himself, the stuck weapon\
  \ flopping uselessly against his leg. The skittering in the tunnel grew louder.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Darvin glanced up just in time to catch a scurry of movement and the\
  \ gleam of red eyes. It took him a second to register that second part before several\
  \ large and frightened brown rats tore out of the tunnel, screeching in protest.\
  \ They ran past Darvin and a prone Fife, who pulled away from the rodents, before\
  \ scrabbling through cracks in the wall.</p> \n    <p>\"Rats!\" Darvin exclaimed,\
  \ laughing in relief. \"All that nonsense for rats!\" He noticed the amputated hand,\
  \ its fingers curled up like the legs of a dead spider. \"When did I do that?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You?\" Fife stood and drew himself up to his full three-foot height.\
  \ \"That was me!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Really?\" Darvin said. \"That sounds more like\
  \ something I'd do.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I killed it!\" Fife said, then seemed to startle\
  \ as he realized what he'd said. \"Me! I did that! I killed it! I'm the hero of\
  \ the village.\" He held his bamboo quill aloft like a champion wielding a blade,\
  \ or at least a really big turkey leg. \"The quill is mightier than the sword!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Now that's just silly,\" Darvin said. \"Hyperbole will get you killed.\
  \ Especially in a sword-versus-quill fight.\" He looked around the chamber.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The world seemed to slow, dread flowing back into him like cold water\
  \ into an empty cup. \"Fife,\" Darvin said quietly, \"don't turn around.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Of course Fife turned around. As soon as he said it, Darvin realized how\
  \ foolish the statement was. Turning is precisely the first thing one does when\
  \ told \"don't turn around.\" It was an inherent contradiction, much like when someone\
  \ says, \"This tastes horrible... here, try it.\" </p> \n    <p>They stood in a\
  \ circular domed chamber, a door against the curve of the opposite wall. In the\
  \ center rested a huge table with its sides flanked by drawers and the top covered\
  \ in beakers, jars, books, powder packets, measuring tools, and innumerable other\
  \ instruments. Above the worktable hung a wood-wheel chandelier crusted in wax.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Twenty tables lined the curving walls, and upon each lay a corpse in\
  \ some advanced state of decay.</p> \n    <p>\"Darvin,\" Fife whispered.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Darvin touched his brother's shoulder. \"I told you not to turn around.\"\
  \ In retrospect, though, Darvin wasn't sure how he expected Fife to continue without\
  \ turning around.</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Fife said, nodding to the bodies; all manacled,\
  \ Darvin now noticed. And all missing their hands.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh,\" Darvin said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And from all the dark places in the room and the large cracks in the\
  \ floor came a scurrying of movement.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Things\
