  description\">The release of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</i></a> is just a few weeks off, bringing the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Anniversary-Edition\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a> to your game table in an entirely new\
  \ way. Of course you can expect murderous cultists, inbred ogres, armies of giants,\
  \ slithery seductresses, ancient dungeons, and all the rest of the deadly monsters\
  \ and evil schemes that make Rise of the Runelords one of the greatest fantasy adventures\
  \ ever. But I know what you're really waiting for: more goblins... and by extent,\
  \ more goblin songs.</span></p> \n     <p>Yeah, we've got those.</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ fact, we've got a whole brand of special promo cards designed to link into the\
  \ Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, each one adding a new goblinly piece of\
  \ equipment, blessing, spell, creature, or half-sane something to your game. Each\
  \ one also includes a brand-new goblin song that James and I threw together, so\
  \ you know that what you're getting is 100% legit, goblin-approved noisemaking.\
  \ Just check out a few of these promo cards and the goblin hits included on each.\

  \ The Fire Sneeze card will debut at Gen Con, and will also be available at major\
  \ PFS events throughout the year. Dance with Squealy Nord will be released in the\
  \ November 2013 issue of <i>Game Trade</i> magazine. The remaining six will be sent\
  \ to retailers, one every two months starting in August, matching our bimonthly\
  \ release schedule for the Base Set and follow-up Adventure Decks. We'll also be\
  \ inserting them into randomly selected <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo\">paizo.com</a>\
  \ orders during the month that they're available at retail.\n     <p></p> \n   \
  \  <p>But if you'd like to make sure you get your hands on <i>all</i> of them, subscribe\
  \ to the Adventure Card Game! Each subscription shipment will include the cards\
  \ associated with that month's release, so Fire Sneeze and the August promo card,\
  \ Poog of Zarongel, will go out with the Base Set next month; the October promo\
  \ card, Blessing of Zarongel, will go out with The Skinsaw Murders Adventure Deck\
  \ in October, and so on. So make sure your raspiest singing voice is good and out\
  \ of tune and get ready to make some noise with the goblins of the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</i>, marching on your game store this August!</p> \n     <p>F.\
  \ Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p> <b>Note: This blog originally\
  \ announced the ship date of the Squealy Nord promo card as September. It has been\
  \ updated with the correct shipping date for the Squealy Nord promo card, which\

  \ in December.</b> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Adventure\
