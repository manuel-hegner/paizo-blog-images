    \ web of lightning, causing him to drop his scimitar. In the foreground, Linni's\
    \ snow leopard Droogami faces off against a snarling hyena."

  alt: "Text inset: If you don’t know how long a quick task takes, go with 1 action,\
    \ or 2 actions if a character shouldn’t be able to perform it three times per\
    \ round. \r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you’re not sure what action a task uses, look for the\
    \ most similar basic action. If you don’t find one, make up an action adding any\
    \ necessary traits (usually attack, concentrate, manipulate, or move).\r\n\t\t\
    \t\t\tWhen two sides are opposed, have one roll against the other’s DC. Don’t\
    \ have both sides roll (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character\
    \ who rolls is usually the one acting (except in the case of saving throws).\r\
    \n\t\t\t\t\tIf an effect raises or lowers chances of success, grant a +1 circumstance\
    \ bonus or a –1 circumstance penalty.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you’re not sure how difficult\
    \ a significant challenge should be, use the DC for the party’s level.\r\n\t\t\
    \t\t\tIf you’re making up an effect, creatures should be incapacitated or killed\
    \ on only a critical success (or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).\r\
    \n\t\t\t\t\tIf you don’t know what check to use, pick the most appropriate skill.\
    \ If no other skill applies to a check to Recall Knowledge, use an appropriate\
    \ Lore skill (usually at an untrained proficiency rank).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUse the\
    \ characters’ daily preparations as the time to reset anything that lasts roughly\
    \ a day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen a character accomplishes something noteworthy that\
    \ doesn’t have rules for XP, award them XP for an accomplishment (10 to 30 XP,\
    \ as described on page 507).\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the PCs fail at a task, look for\
    \ a way they might fail forward, meaning the story moves forward with a negative\
    \ consequence rather than the failure halting progress entirely."
