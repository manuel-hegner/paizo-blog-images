  artist: "their fellow natives, the hive-dwelling formians. A random cross-section\
    \ of axiomite society contains those who resemble flawless, perfect humanoids\
    \ of all descriptions—typically humans, elves, tieflings, dwarves, halflings,\
    \ giants, and even gnomes—but these outward shapes belie their true forms, which\
    \ can be seen briefly whenever the axiomites move or perform any complex actions.\
    \ During such moments, their bodies partly dissolve into glowing clouds of golden,\
    \ crystalline dust. The clouds move and contort on their own accord, temporarily\
    \ congealing into twisting lines of mathematic symbols and complex tangles of\
    \ equations. Each axiomite is actually an immortal construct of living, intelligent\
    \ mathematics approximating a humanoid shape"
