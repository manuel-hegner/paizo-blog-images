  \ Spotlight blog series! Nearly every Monday, we’ll focus on a different wonderful\
  \ industry creator, as an individual, including Paizo staff, freelancers, contractors,\
  \ podcast players, streamers, YouTubers, licensed partners, and more. The format\
  \ is a list of standardized questions from which interviewees can choose. Request\
  \ the Creator Spotlight form by emailing marketing@paizo.com. This week we're shining\
  \ a spotlight on community creator, Dan Thompson!</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr\

  >@DangerClubPod</a></b></p> \n     <h3>Tell us about yourself. What is your bio?\
  \ What's your story behind the bio? Why do you do what you do?</h3> \n     <p>I’\
  m the GM for The Danger Club Podcast. We’re a bunch of actors from the UK who have\
  \ been making a Pathfinder show for nearly four years now! I’ve been playing roleplaying\
  \ games since I was a kid, and when I quit my job to move to London and be an actor,\
  \ I didn’t really know anyone. So one day I invited a few of the cast from my show\
  \ to play a game after we got out. We had a great time and started playing every\
  \ week. Then people started asking to come watch us, and one of them suggested we\
  \ try podcasting. Back when we started there were already lots of great shows, and\
  \ I often felt intimidated by how good they seemed to be at playing the game and\
  \ remembering rules. That’s impressive, but it’s not how my friends and I game at\
  \ all. We just grab dice, make some jokes, and try to tell a story. People sometimes\
  \ say that Pathfinder is a complicated game and you have to learn a ton of rules\
  \ to enjoy it, so we wanted to show that you don’t need that at all. We’ve gotten\
  \ good at recording and editing, but when it comes down to it, the podcast isn’\
  t any different from those early days. It’s the feeling of sitting in the pub with\
  \ your mates, making up characters, and having a good time.</p> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h3>Tell us about a project you are particularly proud of?</h3> \n     <p>The\
  \ thing I’m really proud of is the work we did during lockdown. We’re all performers,\
  \ so when the pandemic hit, we literally lost our careers overnight—just years of\
  \ work gone in an instant. My mental health was pretty bad at the time, and it would\
  \ have been really easy to just call it a day and focus on getting through. But\
  \ then we saw members of our community struggling the same way, and we just made\
  \ a snap decision that we couldn’t bail on them. We learned how to record from home,\
  \ we learned how to use Twitch, and we invited people from Paizo to come on and\
  \ talk about their work. We put out two or three shows a week for two years, and\
  \ we never missed a week. At the same time we got to know the Dangerling community\
  \ in a way we hadn’t before and came away much closer.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>What\
  \ do you do as your day job?</h3> \n     <p>All the DCP are actors/performers of\
  \ one kind or another. In the “before times,” I worked as a comedian and was part\
  \ of the acting team for a lot of London’s historic sites. I’d spend the day running\
  \ around in armor and spend the evening pretending to be a character in armor around\
  \ a gaming table. Since the pandemic killed off a lot of those companies, I’ve moved\
  \ more into production, and now I stage manage a cabaret club and develop scripts\
  \ for online games. I won’t lie, I miss the armor a little bit.</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>Where do you draw your inspiration?</h3> \n     <p>As a neurodivergent\
  \ person, my brain is quite a frantic place. Letting a part of it sit in Golarion\
  \ and make up stories is a way for the rest of me to stay grounded. Part of my brain\
  \ is pretty much always devouring things I see and turning them into Danger Club\
  \ stories, which leaves the rest of my brain free to remember to eat lunch or leave\
  \ the house on time. I’m not focused enough to be one of these GMs who knows every\
  \ shop and NPC in their world, so I prefer to focus on key moments that I want to\
  \ happen and cling for dear life, laying down track in front of the train until\
  \ we get there.</p>' \n     <br> \n     <h3>What piece of advice that you have been\
  \ given as a creator that is either so great that you have to tell us about it or\
  \ so awful that you have to warn us?</h3> \n     <p>There are no competitors here,\
  \ only potential collaborators. It’s easy to feel like other creators are so far\
  \ ahead, but they probably have days where they feel the same about you. Some of\
  \ my favorite projects are where we reached out to people we admired and asked if\
  \ we could make something together. The more we lift each other up, the better we\
  \ all do.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>How did you get started writing/producing/creating\
  \ content?</h3> \n     <p>I’ve been writing my whole life. I’ve been a comedian,\
  \ actor, comic book writer, and I’ve been making up roleplaying games since I was\
  \ 12. In terms of podcasting, we used to play Pathfinder at a London pub every Monday,\
  \ and over the years people started coming to watch, so we decided to record some\
  \ and see what would happen. Now, here we are!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>What are\
  \ your goals or dreams as a creator?</h3> \n     <p>I want to grow the DCP community\
  \ to be absolutely gigantic. They’re such an awesome group of people, and every\
  \ time somebody new joins the Discord, it’s like getting a new friend. We’ve been\
  \ through a lot, and the way they’ve supported each other and us through it all\
  \ just fills me with joy. I want everyone to get to share in that…but in a nice\
  \ way, not a Borg way.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>How have you seen immersive fantasy\
  \ worlds and cooperative strategic play bring people together and create lifelong\
  \ friendships?</h3> \n     <p>Well, back in 2011 I suggested to a group of actors\
  \ that we go play a roleplaying game after the show and we’ve played every week\
  \ since then and now make a podcast together! That’s definitely got to count for\
  \ something, right? You see it in our community as well. A lot of our listeners\
  \ are new to Pathfinder so some of the more experienced GMs set up a channel on\
  \ our Discord where they could form gaming groups. I got a message the other day\
  \ that one of them is closing in on the end of Agents of Edgewatch, and I couldn’\
  t be prouder.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Please tell us about your pet!</h3> \n\
  \     <p>Sadly my apartment isn’t big enough to keep a happy pet, but I do have\
  \ a unicorn who keeps me company while I write! </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ and in the foundations of London Bridge. I’ve not managed to play in an actual\
  \ palace yet, but there’s still time.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags:\
