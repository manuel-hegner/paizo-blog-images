  \ All About?</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 19, 2007</p> \n   <p>By\
  \ this time, you've probably heard all about <i>Pathfinder</i>, Paizo's brand-new\
  \ Adventure Path series. (If you haven't, of course, you should drop whatever you're\
  \ doing and go check out <a href=\"/pathfinder\">paizo.com/pathfinder</a>.) Yet\
  \ even now that you know what's going to be in <i>Pathfinder</i>, you're probably\
  \ wondering what it's all about. The vision behind it. Where its heart's at. And\
  \ to answer that, we've brought in James Jacobs, <i>Pathfinder</i>'s Editor-in-Chief.\
  \ Says James: </p>\n   <p>\"<i>Pathfinder</i>'s at once the most exciting and the\
  \ scariest thing I've worked on here at Paizo. On one hand, it's a chance to dive\
  \ headfirst into a brand-new world and craft a story from scratch for you to run\
  \ your players through. And on the other… it's a chance to dive headfirst into a\
  \ brand-new world and craft a story from scratch for you to run your players through.\
  \ There's no convoluted canon or established game history to work around and make\
  \ sure that we've got right, but that also means there's no awesome nostalgia or\
  \ tradition to build off of. We have to start completely from scratch... right?\
  \ </p>\n   <p>\"Well, not quite. There are still an awful lot of classic monsters\
  \ and other material we can use in the SRD. And while we can't really build directly\
  \ off of established canon, we can certainly draw upon themes from the early days.\
  \ We can also do the same thing that Gygax, Kuntz, Arneson, and the others did back\
  \ at the game's dawning—we can draw upon real world myth. So as you read through\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i>'s first Adventure Path and begin to uncover the sinister conspiracy\
  \ that has driven the stone giants of the Storval Plateau to war, you might also\
  \ see a few familiar names and themes from real-world myth popping up now and then,\
  \ like Lamashtu, Baba Yaga, the seven deadly sins, and even Asmodeus. </p>\n   <h2>Welcome\
  \ to Varisia!</h2> \n   <p>\"The first step to building a new Adventure Path was\
  \ a doozy, though For <i>Pathfinder</i>, we didn't have the luxury of a pre-existing\
  \ game world to set our campaign in. Before I could even start writing the first\
  \ adventure to Rise of the Runelords, I needed a world to set it in. </p>\n   <p>It\
  \ all started with Erik Mona building up an enormous T-shaped map over the course\
  \ of several sheets of graph paper. What he ended up with was several continents;\
  \ way too much room for a single campaign. So I chose one relatively small (small\
  \ as in \"about the size of California\") section of his map and started filling\
  \ in the blanks. At the same time, the rest of the <i>Pathfinder</i> team—F. Wesley\
  \ Schneider and James Sutter—and I began to work out the plotline for the inaugural\
  \ Adventure Path: Rise of the Runelords. To a certain extent, the shape of this\
  \ new region was dictated by the plot we came up with: we needed a mountain range\
  \ to rival the Himalayas, a vast cliff face stretching hundreds of miles, and remnants\
  \ from an ancient empire. </p>\n   <p>The result is the realm of Varisia. </p>\n\
  \   <p>During the course of Rise of the Runelords, we'll visit six major locations\
  \ on the map of Varisia, including two cities, two legendary mountains, a fortress\
  \ of giants, and a lost city. Yet those account for only six dots on a map—at current\
  \ count, Varisia's got approximately 40 locations (including cities like lawless\
  \ Riddleport and ruins like sinister Brinewall) and 20 sub-regions (including the\
  \ inhospitable Mushfens, haunted Ashwood, and the giant-ruled Storval Plateau) waiting\
  \ to be explored. Some of these might get some exposure in Rise of the Runelords,\
  \ others will be the focus of GameMastery modules, and some are destined to be the\
  \ stars of future <i>Pathfinder</i> Adventure Paths. But the point isn't to build\
  \ just what we need for the next few Paizo releases—there's enough adventure in\
  \ Varisia to set dozens of campaigns. </p>\n   <p>\"Over the next several days,\
  \ I'll be revealing more about Varisia, Rise of the Runelords, and other exciting\
  \ developments on the <i>Pathfinder</i> front here on this blog. Want a taste? Then\
  \ check out these notes I've jotted down for one of those mysterious locations on\
  \ the regional map of Varisia—the remote island of Chorak's Rest. </p>\n   <h2>Chorak's\
  \ Rest</h2> \n   <p>Although the Varisians have no name for this tiny and remote\
  \ island, the giants of the Gnasher Mountains do. They call the place Chorak's Rest,\
  \ after the legendary warlord said to be buried in a great tomb there. The giants\
  \ of the Storval Plateau were not always the barbarians they are today; this much\
  \ is obvious from even a brief perusal of the texts stored in the History Wing of\
  \ the Great Library of Magnimar. Yet the giants of Chorak's Rest seem to have retained\
  \ more of the old ways than their brutish cousins in the Gnashers. Whispers hint\
  \ that these island giants are the descendants of King Chorak's honor guard, and\
  \ that they've remained guardians for the past several centuries, preventing approach\
  \ to the island by giant and human alike. Boats attempting to land on the island\
  \ are quickly bombarded with boulders and spears, and aerial approaches are shot\
  \ down with massive ballista bolts carved with strange runes or blasted from the\
  \ sky by bolts of lightning. Yet for all these defenses, none have approached close\
  \ enough to determine what, exactly, is behind this prodigious defense. What awaits\
  \ the lucky (unlucky?) souls who finally manage to reach the island's shores is\
  \ unknown, but many treasure seekers are sure it would be well worth the trouble.\
