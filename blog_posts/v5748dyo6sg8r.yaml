  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As of today, we turn our focus to Part\
  \ 3 of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, \"Affair at Sombrefell Hall,\" written by one of\
  \ the many talented developers of the new edition of Pathfinder, Amanda Hamon Kunz.</span>\
  \ If you've already played Part 3 of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, you can find the surveys\
  \ at the following links:</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:center;margin:2rem;\"\
  ><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP3PC\" target=\"_blank\">Player\
  \ Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP3GM\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Game Master Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP3OP\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Open Survey</a></p> \n    <p>Before we move on, we'd like to\
  \ look back at what we've learned from the first two parts of the adventure and\
  \ talk about some additional changes we're making to the game based on your comments\
  \ and feedback.</p> \n    <p>But first, a few important notes.</p> \n    <p>First\
  \ off, you can still turn in survey results for Parts 1 and 2 of the adventure.\
  \ Although we're moving on, your responses will still be counted and help us make\
  \ further decisions about the game.</p> \n    <p>Second, I want to take a moment\
  \ to stress that the various parts of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> are meant to be tests\
  \ that look at various parts of the game engine. This goal was more important to\
  \ us, in some places, than creating a balanced play experience. This will make certain\
  \ parts of the adventure a little challenging to run at times, but we hope you'll\
  \ bear with us. We've tried to ensure you'll have a good time with the adventure,\
  \ but the test goals have to come first. Thanks for understanding.</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ the rest of this blog may contain spoilers for Parts 1 and 2, so if you have not\
  \ finished those chapters, you might want to go back and do that first.</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Deconstructing Part 2: In Pale Mountain's Shadow</h2> \n    <p>In case you\
  \ missed the Twitch stream on Friday, Designer Logan Bonner sat down with Dan Tharp\
  \ to talk through some of the things we've learned so far from the survey results\
  \ from Part 2 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Here are a few of the highlights, along with\
  \ a thing or two we might have missed.</p> \n    <p>As the first part of <em>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</em> to be set above level 1, Part 2 was our first chance to ask about archetypes.\
  \ 15% of you took an archetype, and of those, most were arcane spellcasters picking\
  \ up the fighter archetype.</p> \n    <p>This is also the first part of the adventure\
  \ where characters start play with magic items. 62% of you chose <i>magic armor</i>\
  \ as your 3rd-level item, but over 10% took a lower-level item or a consumable item\
  \ instead. We might look into making changes in how you can select items in the\
  \ future to accommodate players who want more flexibility.</p> \n    <p>It took\
  \ players, on average, almost 10 minutes less to make their 4th-level characters\
  \ that it did to make their 1st-level characters, which is great news.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Resonance continues to be a topic of discussion amongst players, and our surveys\
  \ are just starting to give us a picture of how it is working in play. Only about\
  \ 1 out of every 4 players ran out of resonance once during Part 2, and only 1 out\
  \ of every 10 players failed their check when overspending resonance and became\
  \ cut off during Part 2 (usually alchemists). Now, the important thing to note here\
  \ is that this is not really showing us how resonance is being used, merely that\
  \ players aren't running out very often, so be on the lookout for survey questions\
  \ in upcoming parts that will delve a little deeper into exactly how you're using\
  \ resonance at your table.</p> \n    <p>Finally, this part of the adventure was\
  \ designed to test the game in situations with complex environmental and tactical\
  \ challenges. Our results showed that players viewed these fights as a significantly\
  \ greater challenge than the raw monster numbers—not counting the environmental\
  \ advantages—would indicate. Players also rated the fights in this part as significantly\
  \ longer and not quite as fun. Some of this was expected, but when we look at these\
  \ results by class, things become really interesting, showing us which classes had\
  \ the most difficulty with Part 2. Barbarians, monks, and paladins, for example,\
  \ seemed to have a bit of trouble with the manticore fight, since they tend to lack\
  \ ranged options. This shows us that there are adjustments to be made with these\
  \ classes to ensure they have some way to contribute.</p> \n    <h2>New Updates</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>With the start of a new part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, we also have\
  \ a number of changes to the game that we want to bring to your attention. All of\
  \ these can be found in the download below (which includes all of the previous changes\
  \ in one handy document). Here are a few of the highlights:</p> \n    <p>First up,\
  \ we're changing the anathema for the animal totem barbarian to allow you to use\
  \ whatever weapon you want while outside of rage. When transformed with fury, though,\
  \ you still need to use those special animal unarmed attacks. Look for a few more\
  \ barbarian updates as well.</p> \n    <p>Next, we're adding a longer range to <i>soothe</i>,\
  \ the occult healing spell, allowing you to use it on targets up to 30 feet away.\
  \ There's a bard update, as well; they now have a feat to gain access to 10th-level\
  \ occult spells.</p> \n    <p>Finally—and this is the big change for the week—we're\
  \ removing the concept of signature skills from the game. Now anyone can advance\
  \ any skill up to any proficiency rank they want (assuming their level is high enough\
  \ for them to do so). In addition, a number of classes are having their total number\
  \ of starting skill choices increased to at least three, with each also getting\
  \ one or more automatic skills, to represent basic class training.</p> \n    <blockquote>\n\
