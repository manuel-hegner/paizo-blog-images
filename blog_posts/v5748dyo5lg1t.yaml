  \ in Hell. In order to do so, the former priest-hunter will need to descend into\
  \ the anarchic city of Kaer Maga, following a trail that ranges from Hell’s iron\
  \ cities to the gates of Heaven itself. Along the way, he’ll be aided by a host\
  \ of otherworldly creatures, a streetwise teenager, and two warriors of the mysterious\
  \ Iridian Fold. But when the missing souls are the scum of the earth, and the victims\

  \ \n     <h1 align=\"center\">Chapter Three</h1> \n     <h2 align=\"center\">The\
  \ Devil's Due</h2> \n     <p>Salim realized he was gripping his sword hilt. The\
  \ devil looked pointedly at it, then shifted his gaze to the corner hidden behind\
  \ the door. \"Not much for etiquette, is he?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Please, Salim,\"\
  \ said another voice, this one all too familiar. \"Come in and close the door.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Gritting his teeth, Salim let go of his sword and moved inside. As\
  \ he let the door swing closed behind him, he tasted iron and felt the familiar\
  \ warm trickle as blood ran from his nose, catching in his short black beard.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The devil looked at Salim with something between fascination and disgust,\
  \ then past him over his shoulder. \"He's leaking.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just a little\
  \ reminder from the Lady,\" said the other voice, now behind Salim. \"It's a little\
  \ game we play. Isn't that right, Salim?\"</p> \n     <p>Salim turned.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The angelic creature hung motionless in the air, its toes several inches\
  \ above the floor. Beneath black hair, the face was too perfect to be human, its\
  \ smooth features more like a sketch by a master artist than anything nature designed.\
  \ Its flesh was the alien, hairless white of marble or maggot, and the sheer gray\
  \ fabric that wrapped its torso was more shroud than toga. If there was gender beneath\
  \ that garment, Salim had never seen it. Great black wings rose from behind the\
  \ creature's shoulders, oily feathers melding with the shadows to seem at once comfortable\
  \ and far too big for the room. They stretched lazily, swirling the shadow into\
  \ little eddies and currents.</p> \n     <p>\"Hello, Salim.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ceyanan.\"\
  \ The word was a curse. Salim made no effort to wipe his face. Blood from his nose\
  \ made its way across the well-trimmed lawn of his beard and dripped onto the wooden\
  \ floor with a quiet <i>plip</i>.</p> \n     <p>\"Really, Ceyanan,\" said the devil.\
  \ \"I'm not one to tell others how to housebreak their pets, but this hardly seems\
  \ suitable for our conversation.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of course,\" Ceyanan said, in\
  \ its maddening, genderless voice. \"My apologies.\"</p> \n     <p>There was a sudden\
  \ touch of wind on Salim's face, stale and cold as the breeze from a long-sealed\
  \ tomb, and then the blood was gone. Salim refused to react.</p> \n     <p>\"Please,\"\
  \ Ceyanan said, raising a hand toward the chairs around the table. \"Be seated.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Salim contemplated his options. Normally, he would stand just to\
  \ spite the angel, but such pettiness might seem a sign of weakness to the devil.\
  \ With a hard look at the placid apparition, he moved to the table and took a seat,\
  \ pushing his chair back against the wall so that he could see both of the room's\
  \ residents.</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan drifted over, neither walking nor flapping, but\
  \ rather pulling the shadowy wings along in its wake like streamers that grew and\
  \ stretched as it moved. It stopped on the other side of the table. An alabaster\
  \ hand indicated the devil.</p> \n     <p>\"Salim, allow me to introduce Hezechor.\"\
  </p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8520_Maedora.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>The devil smiled, showing perfect teeth only slightly too pointed for\
  \ a human. He inclined his head.</p> \n     <p>Salim had met devils, of course.\
  \ It was impossible not to in his line of work. This one was a classic breed, with\
  \ features reminiscent of Asmodeus himself. A crown of short horns sat above a red-skinned\
  \ and ruggedly handsome face with dark eyes and a small, pointed beard. His robes\
  \ were a matching red, emblazoned with infernal symbols in black and gold, and left\
  \ his muscular chest bare. </p> \n     <p>There, however, the devil's similarities\
  \ to the Archfiend of minstrels' stories stopped. From the creature's back sprouted\
  \ a clutch of huge black horns, twisted and ridged like a ram's. They curved out\
  \ and around him like the tentacles of some tide pool anemone, threatening to cage\
  \ him in. From several hung scrolls of parchment and papyrus, as well as one that\
  \ looked suspiciously like human skin, all covered in dense, crabbed sigils that\
  \ were nauseating to look upon.</p> \n     <p>\"You're a contract devil,\" Salim\
  \ said.</p> \n     <p>\"A phistophilus, yes.\" Hezechor smiled broader this time,\
  \ and Salim had to suppress a shiver. The devil's eyes seemed to bore through him,\
  \ even as the rest of the face invited trust. Salim had known confidence men before,\
  \ and master merchants who could convince you to trade everything you owned for\
  \ a handful of tin. This creature was in another class entirely. \"You're familiar\
  \ with us?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not personally, no.\" Salim shook off the devil's uncanny\
  \ charm like a dog shakes off water. He gave Ceyanan a look. \"I'm afraid I strike\
  \ my infernal bargains elsewhere.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Pity,\" said Hezechor, and looked\
  \ to Ceyanan as well. \"Shall we begin, then?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Certainly.\" Ceyanan\
  \ paused to make sure Salim was paying attention, then spread its hands.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The air between them filled with rows of tiny faces. The illusions swung\
  \ side to side, giving Salim a full view of the disembodied heads. Out of habit,\
  \ Salim began memorizing them, breaking them into smaller groups by race and gender\
  \ and noting scars, tattoos, and other distinguishing features. Most of the faces\
  \ were human or half-elven, but there was a gnome in there as well, the little man's\
  \ hair a bloody red too bright for a human's. None of the faces looked particularly\
  \ friendly. </p> \n     <p>\"Over the last several months, Kaer Maga has suffered\
  \ a rash of unexplained murders,\" Ceyanan said. \"Dozens of bodies have washed\
  \ up in the aqueducts and back-alley trash heaps of the city's southern districts,\
  \ or spattered across the stones at the foot of the cliff.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim\
  \ said nothing. Considering his own welcome, Kaer Maga gave every appearance of\
  \ being a hard town. He would be astonished if there weren't a dozen murders here\
  \ in any given month. Or week.</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan noted his silence and nodded\
  \ slightly. \"Of particular significance is the fact that, of the identified victims,\
  \ all have been singularly unsavory individuals. Slavers, rapists, murderers, and\
  \ the like. Despite a great variety of wounds, all were ultimately dispatched by\
  \ a neat stiletto puncture through the back.\" This time Ceyanan let the pause stretch.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Always the showman, Salim thought. He sighed and accepted his cue. \"\
  So? Why does the Gray Lady care? Let Hell have them.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Precisely,\"\
  \ said Hezechor. The devil was no longer smiling.</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan looked at\
  \ Salim. \"As Hezechor implies, the issue is not what happened, but rather what\
  \ failed to happen. Of the fifty-some individuals who have been slain, none have\
  \ appeared at the Spire for judgment.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim sat back in his chair\
  \ and let out a breath. </p> \n     <p>Fifty souls. And from the same city, at that.\
  \ It was a mind-boggling number. Across the various nations and worlds of the Material\
  \ Plane—the realm of existence where mortals lived—there were few constants. In\
  \ fact, despite the old sayings, even tides and taxes were avoidable, depending\
  \ on where you were. But death—death was the great equalizer.</p> \n     <p>No matter\
  \ who you were, or <i>what</i> you were, if you lived, one day you would cease living.\
  \ On that day, your spirit would leave your body on the Material Plane and join\
  \ the River of Souls, the great procession of recently deceased spirits that flowed\
  \ all the way to Pharasma's Spire, the huge pillar of stone that was the heart of\
  \ the Outer Planes—what mortals thought of as the afterlife. Once you reached the\
  \ Boneyard, Pharasma and her minions—psychopomps like Ceyanan—would divide you up\
  \ according to how you lived and what you believed, and send you on to whatever\
  \ plane or deity was most appropriate. If you were a particularly contentious case,\
  \ there might even be a trial of sorts. But regardless of how exactly it happened,\
  \ there was no getting around it: if you died, you were judged. Pharasma's servants\
  \ were meticulous record-keepers, and since the Gray Lady was the goddess of fate\
  \ and prophecy as well as birth and death, she already kept tabs on every sentient\
  \ creature in the multiverse. Trying to avoid her notice was like hiding from the\
  \ passage of time.</p> \n     <p>Not that people didn't try. They ran, or hid their\
  \ souls, or transformed themselves into undead monstrosities. Some destroyed the\
  \ souls of their enemies, or managed to bottle them up before they could reach the\
  \ Spire. That was where Salim came in.</p> \n     <p>But still—even one soul unaccounted\
  \ for was an anomaly. Fifty...</p> \n     <p>\"I presume this is limited to the\
  \ murders?\" Salim asked. \"Other folk who die in Kaer Maga are reaching the Spire\
  \ as normal?\"</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan nodded. \"It's not simply a matter of murder,\
  \ either. A great number of people are killed in Kaer Maga on a regular basis. Most\
  \ of these continue to arrive and be judged as normal. Of the ones who haven't,\
  \ the only link is that all appear to have died violently via the stiletto, and\
  \ lived in a manner that even Kaer Magans would find abhorrent.\" </p> \n     <p>\"\
  Isn't it obvious?\" Hezechor snapped. The contract devil's red skin seemed to glow\
  \ faintly with irritation. \"We're being robbed.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim gave him\
  \ a level look, then turned back to Ceyanan. \"Is that true? Were all the souls\
  \ destined for Hell?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No,\" Ceyanan said. \"Some were too chaotic\
  \ to be useful to the devils, and better suited to the Abyss. A few were nihilists,\
  \ and the daemons of Abaddon would have gotten those. But it's true that they were\
  \ all evil, and the majority would have gone to the devils.\"</p> \n     <p>Hezechor\
  \ looked mildly affronted at having his grand statement amended, but he bobbed his\
  \ horns in acknowledgment and sat back in his chair.</p> \n     <p>Now Salim turned\
  \ to address the devil. \"So where are your demonic and daemonic counterparts?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Hezechor snorted. \"You ever see a demonic accountant?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"I suppose not.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of course you haven't. The children of\
  \ chaos aren't big on records, and the daemons pretty much eat anyone that shows\
  \ up on Abaddon.\" He gestured at one of the scrolls draped from his horns. \"Hell,\
  \ on the other hand, never forgets.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim nodded and chewed mentally.\
  \ \"Hags?\" he asked. \"Have you checked the markets on Axis?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Naturally,\" Ceyanan said. \"None of the souls in question have shown up in any\
  \ of the usual places.\"</p> \n     <p>That wasn't terribly surprising. There were\
  \ creatures—most notably the nightmare witches called hags—that enjoyed trapping\
  \ souls and bottling them up, selling them to unsavory spellcasters who used them\
  \ in magical rituals. Then there were the creatures that fed on souls—things like\
  \ the daemons Hezechor had mentioned—which didn't care whether they'd been judged\
  \ yet or not. Those were always a problem.</p> \n     <p>Yet neither of those would\
  \ bother restricting themselves to evil souls. What sort of creature was simultaneously\
  \ crazy enough to incur the wrath of the Lady of Graves by disrupting a soul's natural\
  \ cycle, yet conscientious enough to worry about their prey's morality? Salim supposed\
  \ it could be some sort of crusader—perhaps a paladin with a sword that ate souls—\
  yet the magic required to destroy or capture a soul was itself taboo in most cultures,\
  \ and there was little incentive. An evil soul sent to Pharasma's judgment was bound\
  \ to face punishment harsher than whatever a mortal vigilante could mete out.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Salim looked back to Hezechor. \"So you're here to figure out who's\
  \ cutting off your supply.\"</p> \n     <p>The devil smiled. \"My dear boy, I'm\
  \ doing nothing of the sort. I'm afraid this is entirely <i>your</i> mess.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"He's correct,\" Ceyanan said, emotionless as ever. \"Hezechor expressed\
  \ an interest in meeting you, but that's as far as Hell's involvement goes. The\
  \ procession and judgment of souls is Pharasma's domain, and any discrepancies are\
  \ our responsibility to correct.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim felt the familiar, stomach-warming\
  \ anger that characterized all his interactions with Ceyanan. \"You mean <i>my</i>\
  \ responsibility.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of course.\"</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Of course</i>,\"\
  \ Salim mimicked, and crossed his arms. \"Because it's not enough to make me wade\
  \ waste-deep through human filth chasing down packs of sewer ghouls. Or staking\
  \ little girls who happen to be vampires. Or getting my arm charred to the bone\
  \ by some delusional fire wizard trying to bring back his dead parents.\" He flexed\
  \ his right arm, though of course the priests had long since healed that particular\
  \ injury. \"Now you want me to do your accounting for you, too.\"</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan\
  \ smiled. \"At least there won't be rivers of sewage. Probably.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim\
  \ shot back an exaggerated rictus grin. \"As you wish.\" Still seated, he bent at\
  \ the waist and swept out the repaired arm. \"The Grave Bitch commands, and I obey.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"And we thank you for your service,\" Ceyanan said, as polite as\
  \ if Salim's bow had been real.</p> \n     <p>\"Fascinating.\" Hezechor watched\
  \ the exchange with interest, bearded chin in one hand, tone equal parts scorn and\
  \ amusement. \"And your mistress allows this sort of insubordination?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Salim's something of a special case.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim flashed the\
  \ devil the fake smile as well. \"I get the best treatment a slave could hope for.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I see,\" said Hezechor. \"Well, as educational as this has been,\
  \ I believe my involvement here is at an end. My superiors look forward to seeing\
  \ the matter resolved in short order.\" He reached out two black nailed fingers\
  \ and pulled a narrow scroll from where it draped over a horn just above his right\
  \ shoulder. He glanced at it, then looked over it at Salim.</p> \n     <p>\"Please\
  \ don't take this the wrong way,\" the devil said, \"but I suspect we'll be meeting\
  \ again.\"</p> \n     <p>The paper between his fingers ignited, a brilliant flash\
  \ that left Salim dazzled for the second time that day. When his vision cleared,\
  \ Hezechor was gone, leaving behind only the slight scent of brimstone and a faintest\
  \ wisp of smoke drifting up from his chair.</p> \n     <p>Salim looked at Ceyanan.\
  \ The angel-shaped psychopomp hung in the air, unflappable as always.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"So,\" Salim said. \"Alone together at last.\"</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan tilted\
  \ its head. \"Not quite. Maedora?\"</p> \n     <p>At the far end of the room, something\
  \ moved.</p> \n     <p>At first it was like a breeze, a faint stirring of dust motes—\
  but of course there was no wind in the windowless room. As Salim watched, the shadows\
  \ in the corner seemed to reach forth, spinning out into long threads that tangled\
  \ and wove together, splitting and multiplying as they stretched toward him. The\
  \ shadows paled from black to gray, then began to shimmer as they formed an outline,\
  \ interlacing like the straw of a wicker man. The web became a cocoon, then bulged\
  \ obscenely.</p> \n     <p>A woman stepped through. She was undeniably beautiful,\
  \ with long black hair that trailed behind her in the nonexistent breeze. She was\
  \ also at least eight feet tall. The iridescent threads that painted her naked body\
  \ were the silken patterns of orb-weaver spiders, and every bit as clingy. They\
  \ wrapped her from head to toe and fanned out behind her, spreading into gray wings\
  \ that were more bat than bird. Even her face was covered, the webs thickening into\
  \ a flared mask that hid her eyes and left only her pale mouth and nose exposed.\
  \ All together, the effect was that of a recently mummified corpse.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ trailing shadow-strings snapped and faded away as she strode over to stand next\
  \ to Ceyanan. She turned her head to evaluate Salim, and he didn't need to see her\
  \ eyes to feel the weight of that stare.</p> \n     <p>\"Nice outfit,\" he said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The web woman remained silent.</p> \n     <p>\"Salim,\" Ceyanan said,\
  \ and for a moment Salim thought the angel sounded almost anxious. \"This is Maedora.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"A pleasure to meet you, Maedora,\" Salim said. \"Do you always\
  \ make such an entrance, or am I especially privileged?\" </p> \n     <p>Still the\
  \ woman said nothing.</p> \n     <p>\"Maedora is another psychopomp,\" Ceyanan said\
  \ tightly. \"A morrigna.\"</p> \n     <p>The angel said it like it should mean something.\
  \ Salim shrugged. \"Sorry. You all look the same to me.\"</p> \n     <p>Which wasn't\
  \ true, of course. Salim had worked with a number of psychopomps over the years—\
  those agents of the death goddess that mortals often called spirit guides, angels,\
  \ or reapers. Yet with the exception of Ceyanan, those had mostly been birdlike\
  \ things that guarded the River of Souls from creatures looking to prey on the defenseless\
  \ petitioners. Nothing like this woman.</p> \n     <p>Maedora walked around the\
  \ table toward Salim. Though the body underneath the shroud was flawless, her hips\
  \ had no seductive roll, and her feet made no sound on the floorboards. As she drew\
  \ near, the physical size of her grew more and more imposing, and the shifting patches\
  \ of shadow that moved across her wrappings resolved themselves into thousands of\
  \ tiny black spiders that rippled and flowed in precise movements. She loomed over\
  \ his chair.</p> \n     <p>\"You really should be more polite,\" Ceyanan noted.\
  \ \"After all, you and Maedora are in the same line of work.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Oh?\" Salim asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Hunting.\" The voice that emerged from beneath\
  \ that mask was soft, arch, and as cold as the grave.</p> \n     <p>\"She's an inquisitor,\"\
  \ Ceyanan explained. \"Like all her kind. They gather evidence to aid in judgments,\
  \ and hunt down and destroy would-be immortals and those who trade in stolen souls.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"And atheists.\" Maedora placed a single finger on Salim's neck.\
  \ Cold raced across his skin, raising gooseflesh all down his side. \"The faithless\
  \ can't be allowed to corrupt the Inner Court.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim crooked a smile\
  \ at her. \"Of course.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Maedora will be investigating the murders\
  \ as well.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim gave Ceyanan a sharp look. \"I don't need a partner.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"And you're not getting one,\" the angel replied coolly. \"I'm afraid\
  \ the situation is more complicated than that. You see, while I've been given charge\
  \ of this investigation, there are certain factions within the Inner Court that\
  \ have a different point of view.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Fifty-three souls,\" Maedora\
  \ said. \"Their return is too important to trust to a mortal.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Spare my feelings, why don't you?\" Salim looked to Ceyanan. \"So you're running\
  \ both of us against each other?\"</p> \n     <p>The angel shook its head. \"Not\
  \ against. Merely in parallel. You both work best alone, so you'll work alone. I\
  \ trust you won't interfere with each other, and will share information as benefits\
  \ the aims of the Boneyard. It's simple division of labor. For instance, in light\
  \ of the Lamasaran debacle, Maedora will be handling all interactions with the local\
  \ Pharasmin congregation.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Excuse me?\" Salim asked. \"As I recall,\
  \ I successfully retrieved the kidnapped soul <i>and</i> rooted out corruption in\
  \ the church.\"</p> \n     <p>\"By nearly burning it down,\" Maedora pointed out.\
  \ \"Several of the faithful were injured defending the cathedral.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  And promptly healed each other up, good as new,\" Salim countered.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Nevertheless,\" Ceyanan said, \"the Kaer Magan cathedral will not be subject to\
  \ your special breed of etiquette. Maedora will be the Boneyard's liaison in this\
  \ matter.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Fine.\" Salim had no desire to deal with a bunch of\
  \ stiff-necked priests anyway. \"Then where do you want me to start?\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Wherever you can,\" Ceyanan said.</p> \n     <p>\"You know, for spirit\
  \ guides, both of you interpret the ‘guide' part pretty loosely.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ web-wrapped thing called Maedora moved closer—very close. She hunkered down so\
  \ that her face was just above Salim's, forcing him to tilt his head back to meet\
  \ the blank, gauzy expanse that hid her eyes. </p> \n     <p>Salim wondered how\
  \ many eyes that mask actually hid.</p> \n     <p>\"Listen well, Salim Ghadafar,\"\
  \ Maedora whispered. The web wings spread out behind her to block the light, casting\
  \ them both in shadow. \"Your service has been noted, but your insolence as well.\
  \ Ceyanan may tolerate such things, but I will not. Stay out of my way, and find\
  \ your own leads as best you can. If you interfere with my investigation, you will\
  \ be removed. Permanently.\"</p> \n     <p>Despite the shivers tracing lightning\
  \ arcs up and down his spine, Salim had to smile. \"Are you threatening to fire\
  \ me?\" he asked. \"Because if so, I'm not sure you did your homework.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"There are worse fates than death, Salim,\" Maedora hissed. \"You of all\
  \ people should know that.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Believe me, I do.\" Bending sideways\
  \ so that he could see past the shield of gray wings, Salim said, \"I see why you\
  \ wanted her involved, Ceyanan. She's clearly a people person.\" He straightened\
  \ and stood, moving the chair back so he could look the stooping psychopomp in the\
  \ eye.</p> \n     <p>\"With all due respect to your charming personality,\" he said,\
  \ \"I think you might want to find a cloak or something. This whole ‘winged mummy'\
  \ bit might not put your informants at ease.\"</p> \n     <p>Maedora's lips quirked\
  \ up in a smirk, and she drew back. \"The dead are rarely so squeamish. But you\
  \ have a point.\" </p> \n     <p>She raised a hand, and the spiders that had been\
  \ congregating in little pockets around her body converged on it, covering it in\
  \ a writhing glove. She whispered something, and the spiders rolled down her arm\
  \ and over her body in a seething tide, expanding out over her wings, devouring\
  \ the webbing as they went. When the swarm reached the fingers of her other hand,\
  \ it disappeared.</p> \n     <p>The psychopomp was gone. In her place stood a human\
  \ woman in her early thirties, with pale skin and a stern face. She wore fitted\
  \ pants and a shirt of a military cut, as well as high boots, all of them black.\
  \ A gray cape hung from broad, straight shoulders, secured by a clasp in the shape\
  \ of a spiral. Only the long black hair remained unchanged.</p> \n     <p>She crossed\
  \ her arms. \"Better?\"</p> \n     <p>Her new shape was attractive, in a no-nonsense\
  \ sort of way, and wouldn't draw any attention beyond the usual. Yet there was still\
  \ a blankness in the eyes. A dead thing, wearing the shape of a woman. </p> \n \
  \    <p>Salim nodded.</p> \n     <p>\"Remember what I said.\" The new Maedora's\
  \ voice was the same as the winged giant's. \"I'll be seeing you.\"</p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ she turned and walked out the door.</p> \n     <p>Salim watched the door shut,\
  \ trying to get a grasp on how his day had suddenly become so complicated. Eventually\
  \ he turned back to Ceyanan. \"Nice company you're keeping these days.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Whatever serves the Lady.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yeah, I know. So what's the\
  \ point?\"</p> \n     <p>\"What do you mean?\" the angel asked innocently.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Salim hooked a thumb at the door. \"Why am I here, if you've got spider-lady\
  \ on the job?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's complicated.\" For the first time in their\
  \ long acquaintance, Salim thought the angel sounded tired.</p> \n     <p>\"Everything's\
  \ complicated,\" Salim observed.</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan spread its hands. \"The Lady\
  \ has many servants. I represent one division, Maedora another. Sometimes we disagree\
  \ on how best to proceed. When that happens, the Lady often sees fit to let us sort\
  \ things out among ourselves.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So I'm just a game piece,\" Salim\
  \ said.</p> \n     <p>\"When has it ever been otherwise?\"</p> \n     <p>The angel\
  \ never failed to get under Salim's skin. \"So what if your horse decides not to\
  \ run?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm afraid that would go very poorly for the horse,\" Ceyanan\
  \ replied. \"Horses that refuse to run end up at the knacker's. But you don't have\
  \ to worry about that.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim waited expectantly.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Your pride, Salim. The same thing that led you to us in the first place. The pride\
  \ that led you to try to handle the Lamasaran situation on your own, in order to\
  \ impress that noble girl, and nearly cost you both your lives. What was her name?\
  \ Neila?\"</p> \n     <p>The word was like a stone in Salim's chest. \"You leave\
  \ her out of this.\"</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan waved the issue aside. \"It doesn't matter.\
  \ You'll run because Maedora said you weren't good enough, and thus your desire\
  \ to spite her is momentarily greater than your desire to spite me.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Salim started to respond, then realized it was true. As much as he resented\
  \ Ceyanan, the goddess, and everything about his joke of an existence, part of him\
  \ <i>did </i>want to solve the mystery—all because Maedora had told him he couldn't.\
  \ Perhaps she was a better inquisitor than he'd thought.</p> \n     <p>Besides,\
  \ his real problem was with the goddess herself, and both Maedora and Ceyanan were\
  \ part of her coterie. Which toe he stepped on was irrelevant.</p> \n     <p>Ceyanan\
  \ nodded as if Salim had replied. \"I've left the necessary funds with Canary House's\
  \ owner. I suspect you'll need them, unless those thieves earlier were kind enough\
  \ to refill your purse.\"</p> \n     <p>Salim frowned. \"So you were watching that.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Always.\"</p> \n     <p>That spark of anger again. \"I could have\
  \ been killed.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No,\" Ceyanan said. \"You couldn't. I believe we've\
  \ already proved that point.\"</p> \n     <p>Trust the angel to find a way to work\
  \ that in. \"Go to hell, Ceyanan.\"</p> \n     <p>The psychopomp smiled.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"But Salim, that's what I have <i>you</i> for.\"</p> \n    </blockquote>\
