  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 28, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When we were designing the <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a>, I\
  \ proclaimed loudly that I wanted a necromancer as a character. The prototype game\
  \ that inspired PACG was about messing with dead things, as folks checking out <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loneshark/the-apocrypha-adventure-card-game\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Lone Shark's upcoming Apocrypha Adventure Card Game</a> are\
  \ learning.</p> \n    <p>But back then, the Pathfinder RPG team quickly admonished\
  \ me that while they admired my love of necromancy, a necromancer was a type of\
  \ wizard, and thus I would have to wait until we had a product that contained a\
  \ wizard who wasn't named Ezren. When Tanis started lining up characters for the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy97if\">Wizard Class Deck</a>, I reserved a spot for Darago,\
  \ the necromancer I wanted to unleash on the world.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Darago1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Darago1_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Darago2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Darago2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Flavorwise, Darago is just fantastic. Darago has two\
  \ ways to go after he starts trucking with forces man was not meant to truck with:\
  \ He can become a Necromancer and raise an army of undead, or he can become a Soul\
  \ Warden and battle people who do so. This is one complex cat.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ mechanically, that's where Darago became a trailblazer. The guy in the bone suit\
  \ unlocked a vast part of the game we're still exploring.</p> \n    <p>From the\
  \ start, I imagined that a player could place more than just boons in a character's\
  \ hand. Even though banes didn't have checks to acquire, nothing prevented us from\
  \ making a power that put a monster into your hand after you defeated it. But what\
  \ exactly would you do with it? That, I theorized, was simple: You'd turn it into\
  \ fuel.</p> \n    <p>\"Fuel\" is a concept I use to refer to any card that can be\
  \ spent to trigger an effect. Lini, for example, uses allies with the Animal trait\
  \ to fuel her powers. Darago is built to kill monsters that have the Undead trait\
  \ and then combust them. So once he checks the appropriate feat, Darago can scoop\
  \ up a monster that has the Undead trait and then banish it to add 1d4 to his check.\
  \ And that's <i>any</i> of his checks.</p> \n    <p>Now, in an adventure without\
  \ many Undead, Darago has a rough go. Thankfully, we don't actually know how to\
  \ write one of those. And so Darago plows through the ranks of the fallen, throwing\
  \ every Skeleton back at its bony brethren. If he checks another box on the Necromancer\
  \ role card, he can pitch Zombies to help his friends as well, or he can keep the\
  \ monster and just bank it as an extra hit point. This bag of party tricks is pretty\
  \ darn fun to do.</p> \n    <p>But if he checks <i>one more box</i>...</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Necromancer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Necromancer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-SoulWarden.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-SoulWarden_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>...on his Necromancer role, Darago can do this trick\
  \ with <i>any monster at all</i>, a vast improvement. Now Darago threshes every\
  \ monster he meets, turning that nasty Ogre into a bonus on his check to acquire\
  \ a card that has the Magic trait, which allows him to explore again and maybe find\
  \ another Ogre for the same trick. After a couple of checkboxes, he's a blender.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Meanwhile, on his Soul Warden role, he can use Undead to draw his own\
  \ cards. Put the Soul Warden near a Ghost, and he'll turn it into an Incendiary\
  \ Cloud.</p> \n    <h2>Evolutions of Darago: The Mancer Template</h2> \n    <p>We\
  \ called this bag of party tricks the \"Mancer\" template. For the design team,\
  \ templates are phrasings that can be expanded and modified to make cool powers.\
  \ Here's the template for Mancer: \"When you defeat an X and would banish it, you\
  \ may put it in your hand. You may banish a Y from your hand to Z.\"</p> \n    <p>Satisfied\
  \ with Mancer's appearance on Darago, we put the template on <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> Lini's Aquamancer role.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Aquamancer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Aquamancer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>This allows Lini to hoover up monsters that have the\
  \ Aquatic trait and banish them to help characters at her location fight. There\
  \ are a whole lot of those. It's totally badass to play a gnome who picks up sharks\
  \ and throws them at other sharks.</p> \n    <p>And then when we designed <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>,\
  \ that's when it really got nuts.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Balazar.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Balazar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Eidolomancer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Eidolomancer_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Tyrannomancer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>The summoner Balazar got two Mancer roles: an Eidolomancer\
  \ for harnessing eidolons and a Tyrannomancer that can harness monsters. What's\
  \ an eidolon, you ask? Meet Balazar's crazy snakebird friend, Padrig.</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Padrig.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Padrig_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>With Padrig in hand, Balazar is a Swiss Army Darago.\
  \ You will be stunned at what he can do after he kills a monster. If there's a thing\
  \ in the rules a character can do, Balazar can probably make a monster do it for\
  \ him.</p> \n    <p>There might be more Mancers coming, too. It's all because a\
  \ pasty-faced kid woke up one morning and said, \"I'd like to rob some graves.\"\
  \ And that's why Darago is my favorite PACG character.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
