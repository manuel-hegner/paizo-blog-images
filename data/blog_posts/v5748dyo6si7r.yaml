  >Hi folks! I'm Alex Speidel, Paizo's Organized Play Coordinator and now, apparently,\
  \ a professional streaming GM. Today, I'm thrilled to announce our newest Starfinder\
  \ actual play! <b>Starfinder Drift Crisis</b> is an eight-episode adventure in which\
  \ four brave souls aboard the <em>Void Empress</em> experience the Drift Crash up\
  \ close and personal. These heroes must work together to survive the first moments\
  \ of the Drift Crisis and make it home alive. Along the way, they'll encounter mysterious\
  \ creatures, haunting obstacles, and end up facing off against an influential foe</p>\

  ></p>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>I was so excited to put this adventure\
  \ together for you all, and I can't wait for you to see it. To whet your appetites,\
  \ I wanted to share a couple of my goals with this liveplay.</p> \n      <p>First\
  \ of all, I wanted to make sure this series was approachable to as many people as\
  \ possible. There are some TTRPG fans who aren't fully immersed in the world of\
  \ Starfinder, so I tried my hardest to ensure that you don't need to know anything\
  \ about the Pact Worlds to enjoy the story. Also, the episodes are about an hour\
  \ each, so you don't have to devote hours of your time or worry about falling too\
  \ far behind. My hope is that everyone from my parents to diehard Starfinder fans\
  \ will be able to watch the series and have an awesome time.</p> \n      <p>Second,\
  \ I wanted to show off the tools GMs have available to them already. As a Paizo\
  \ employee, I have access to some of the best artists and cartographers in the business,\
  \ but I started as a Starfinder Society GM, frantically drawing maps with wet-erase\
  \ markers on blank grids. As a result, aside from character artwork for our PCs,\
  \ all the art you'll see is art you can use right now. Every map is a Paizo Flip-Mat,\
  \ every NPC or enemy is pulled straight from an adventure or rulebook, and even\
  \ the adventure pitch comes straight from the pages of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a>. My goal here is to show GMs that you don't\
  \ need a fancy setup or hours and hours of free time to create your own campaign.\
  \ We've provided everything you need to tell a story with your friends already!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Before I go, I want to introduce you to our wonderful players! I'll\
  \ let them introduce their characters in episode 1, so this is just a taste.</p>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li><b>ChelseaBytes</b> (she/her | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChelseaBytes\"\
  >Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ChelseaBytes\">Twitch</a>) brought\
  \ such a fantastic energy to the group from the very start of session 0. I could\
  \ immediately tell that she was going to be a leader for the group, and she quickly\
  \ took charge in and out of character. I loved her character concept from the start,\
  \ and anybody who has worked customer service will immediately relate to her.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>James Rodehaver</b> (he/him | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvilJimjam\"\
  >Twitter</a>) will be a familiar face to fans of Dragons &amp; Things from the GM\
  \ chair. As a player though, he brought something I never expected. If you're not\
  \ absolutely ready to throw down for his character by the end of this adventure,\
  \ I don't know what more I can do.</li> \n       <li><b>London Carlisle</b> (he/him\
  \ | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonCarlisle\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.londoncarlisle.com/\"\
  >Website</a>) was the first person to send me his character concept, and I knew\
  \ we had a winner already. I think every group needs an anchor to keep things centered,\
  \ and his smooth-talking, fast-thinking character is just the mix this group needed.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Michelle Nguyen Bradley</b> (she/her | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamchubbybunny\"\
  >Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.michellenguyenbradley.com/\">Website</a>) was\
  \ the person I was most excited to play with, as I was most familiar with her work,\
  \ and she knocked it out of the park. She took on the challenge of playing a brand-new\
  \ class, and the absolute nonsense she got up to is unparalleled. I can't wait to\
  \ be able to talk about the end of this campaign.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>I\
  \ hope you'll join us for this wild ride on a nightmare cruise ship! I'll be posting\
  \ insights from the GM chair after the episodes, so be sure to follow me on the\
  \ social media platform of your choice for behind-the-scenes gossip. See you in\
  \ the stars!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
