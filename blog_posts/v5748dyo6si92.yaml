  \ here with some news! Starting this fall, Pathfinder will be turning the globe\
  \ a bit as we head to a region we know a lot of you have been waiting for. Eleanor,\
  \ James Jacobs, and I—not to mention the rest of the team and a stellar list of\
  \ authors—are proud to announce the setting of the next few Pathfinder projects\
  \ coming down the road: Tian Xia! Starting at the end of this year and continuing\
  \ into 2024, we’ll be diving into this region like never before to bring you adventures,\
  \ stories, and character options inspired by this land, so let’s take a look at\

  \ Adventure Path</h2> \n     <p>First, the narrative team will kick things off with\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02efy\">Season of Ghosts Adventure\
  \ Path</a> in October of 2023! This horror-themed campaign is set in the haunted\
  \ land of Shenmen and begins just after the small town of Willowshore celebrates\
  \ the Season of Ghosts—a local festival to appease Shenmen’s many evil ghosts and\
  \ spirits and ensure safety for the coming year. Yet this year, something’s gone\
  \ wrong, and the PCs wake to find their hometown of Willowshore has fallen under\
  \ a sinister curse and been invaded by monsters. In the months to come, the heroes\
  \ must help the people of Willowshore prepare for winter while working to discover\
  \ the cause of the curse that’s cut them all off from the rest of the world. Is\
  \ it the work of a fiend? The machinations of vengeful spirits? Or is it something\
  \ much, much worse?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c9c69ad8-e324-405f-84bd-71764c5b813e/Shenme_DarkForest_2000.png?fm=jpg\"\

  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Season of Ghosts will take your PCs from 1st\
  \ to 12th level over the following volumes!</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><em><b>The\
  \ Summer that Never Was</b></em>, by Sen H.H.S.</li> \n      <li><em><b>Let the\

  \ by Liane Merciel, with additional articles by Jeremy Blum, Joshua Kim, and Michelle\
  \ Y. Kim </li> \n     </ul> \n     <p> You might notice that this is our first four-part\
  \ adventure path, for a very good reason! Each of this Adventure Path’s volumes\
  \ take place over the course of a different season, starting with the rainy summer\
  \ and ending in the spring. With each season’s passing, the stakes the heroes face\
  \ escalate, and the revelations in store will shock the townsfolk of Willowshore\
  \ to the core! Will your group of adventures be able to save their hometown from\
  \ a mysterious supernatural horror, or will your hometown simply become the next\
  \ of Shenmen’s haunted ruins?</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Lost Omens Tian Xia</h2>\

  \ Gordeeva.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The <em><b>Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</b></em>\
  \ covers the many diverse nations and cultures that inhabit Tian Xia. Snippets of\
  \ Tian Xia’s lore and history have come to Avistan via merchants and immigrants,\
  \ but this book will present a look at the whole picture, from the elemental hegemony\
  \ and yaoguai wars that shaped the landscape in ancient times to the return of Hao\
  \ Jin in the modern era. Learn the secrets behind the undying emperor of Yixing,\
  \ whose return is still awaited in Po Li. Offer a small prayer to the local kami,\
  \ anito, or kaiju. See if you find satisfaction in the service of the Empress of\
  \ Heaven, Shizuru, or in the explosive rivalry between the dancing gods Mugura and\
  \ Nrithu.</p> \n     <p>In an age ruled by heroes unfettered by prophecy, change\
  \ is sweeping across the continent. Some of you might have helped Ameiko Kaijitsu\
  \ depose the Jade Regent and ascend to the throne of Minkai—now witness the new\
  \ Ondori era under her rule. Step into the nation of Bachuan, now that a Po Li oracle\
  \ has convinced it to ease its restrictions and open its borders; Hao Jin’s tapestry\
  \ people now live here too, descendants of a past once thought lost for good. Amanandar,\
  \ a nation now as Tian in heritage as it is Taldan, has declared its independence\
  \ with the blessings of Queen Eutropia and renamed itself as Linvarre—visitors from\
  \ Avistan may delight in its Grogrisant lion dances or pick up a few words of its\
  \ national language of Taltien. Journey the perilous Valashmai Jungle and find your\
  \ way upon the Valash Raj, flourishing among the ruins shattered by giant beasts\
  \ and monsters. The World Guide will lead you through these nations and more before\
  \ giving GMs a bestiary containing the continent’s monsters, from the ferocious,\
  \ four-horned aoyin to the aristocrat-eating yeongno.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n     <p>After finding a nation or city that sparks your interest in the <em>World\
  \ Guide</em>, it’s only natural to want to make a character from there! The <em><b>The\
  \ Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</b></em> will introduce new rules options\
  \ to bring your characters to life! The book will contain six brand-new ancestries\
  \ and numerous backgrounds to provide the seeds for new PCs. You’ll also find expanded\
  \ heritages and feats for existing ancestries that might be more common in Tian\
  \ Xia than in other areas, like the peachchild leshy heritage, which might have\
  \ come from a fruit that floated down a river, or the bakuwa lizardfolk heritage,\
  \ possibly responsible for eclipses over Minata when they eat the moon! The book\
  \ also contains numerous character options to flesh out Tian adventurers, whether\
  \ that’s skill feats to prepare elemental Tian medicine or a new magus hybrid study\
  \ that lets you leap weightlessly through the air with your cultivated magic, before\
  \ your sword strikes home. </p> \n     <p>We thought we’d give a tiny sneak peek\

  \ aid them in skill checks—perhaps recalling a life as a painter as they observe\
  \ a piece of art—and they can even share some of their powerful life essence with\

  \ have abilities that let them harness their shadows, often through specific dances,\
  \ and more magically inclined wayangs might gain a unique dreaming heirloom with\
