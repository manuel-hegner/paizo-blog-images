  \   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 24, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p>I hope you're making the trek to the Emerald City this weekend for <a\
  \ href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>! (Current weather: 63 degrees and partly sunny.\
  \ Rain Friday, sunny the rest of the weekend, highs around 65.) Below, a primer\
  \ on Adventure Card Game goings-on at the show.</p> \n    <h2>Season the Runelords\
  \ Marchs (Mays?) Onward</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">PaizoCon attendees\
  \ will get the opportunity to play <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season2\">Season of\
  \ the Runelords</a> all the way up through <em>Adventure 3: Into the Mountain</em>\
  \ and will even get a sneak peek at <em>Adventure 4: Abjurant Halls of Envy</em>.\
  \ I just wrote the mechanics for a scenario currently called \"Look! A Monkey!\"\
  \ which I expect to be the start of a long and extended death-glare aimed in my\
  \ direction by you, the fans. Just remember that you're the ones who went into something\
  \ called the Abjurant Halls of Envy, and complaints can be delivered directly to\
  \ me. I'm the one who looks like Mike Selinker.</p> \n    <p>While I'm on the subject\
  \ of Adventure 4, I have more happy news. I've secured the talents of the brilliant\
  \ Amanda Hamon Kunz to help with story design for the rest of Season of the Runelords.\
  \ Amanda's design work has lately been featured in books including <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9gro\"><em>Distant Shores</em></a>,\
  \ and her writing work shines in <a href=\"/products/btpy9hdv\"><em>Cheliax: The\
  \ Infernal Empire</em></a>. I'm ecstatic to have a new story collaborator for this\
  \ season, and if we're very nice to her she might join me again for later seasons.\
  \ (Previous story collaborators have included Brian Campbell, Dave Gross, Keith\
  \ Richmond, and Mike Selinker.)</p> \n    <p>Oh, and I'm bringing advance copies\
  \ of June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9icp\">Witch</a> and August's <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipq\"\
  >Gunslinger</a> Class Decks for folks to play with. Drop by the ACG section of the\
  \ PFS ballroom and game with us!</p> \n    <h2>Adventure Card Game Open Playtest</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Those of you lucky enough to get into this lottery event will get to\
  \ help me hone one of the quarterfinal rounds of this year's Adventure Card Game\
  \ Open, which will take place at Gen Con. What you see there cannot be unseen, because\
  \ if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also. But mostly because that's how\
  \ human eyes work.</p> \n    <h2>We Be Goblins! You Be Goblins! Everybody Be Goblins!</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Another lottery event! This time, ACG players and forum rock stars <a\
  \ href=\"/people/cartmanbeck\">cartmanbeck</a> and <a href=\"/people/TheryonStormrune\"\
  >Theryon Stormrune</a> have put together a custom set of scenarios to play through\
  \ inspired by the storylines of the <em>We Be Goblins</em> series of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/modules/freeRPGDay\">Free RPG Day adventures</a>. Theryon and I will\
  \ be running your tables, so I hope you bring your best goblin game faces. I also\
  \ hope Theryon brings <a href=\"/threads/rzs2todl\">a certain culinary treat</a>,\
  \ but I don't know if those can travel cross-country or not.</p> \n    <h2>Learn\
  \ to Play Mummy's Mask</h2> \n    <p>We've just received the happy news that our\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\">Mummy's Mask</a> demo decks\
  \ will be at the show! Stop by the ACG section of the PFS ballroom for a 30-45 minute\
  \ demo. You can learn to play the game, get a sneak peek at the characters, and\
  \ earn a free deck upgrade for a PFSACG character (one per player per season; this\
  \ demo counts as Season of the Runelords).</p> \n    <h2>Grand Convocation Scavenger\
  \ Hunt</h2> \n    <p>PaizoCon presents lots of great ways to play games and interact\
  \ with Paizo fans and staff, but where does one begin? Why not participate in the\
  \ Grand Convocation scavenger hunt, which rewards you with a special benefit in\
  \ the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and Adventure Card Guild organized play\
  \ programs for every highlight you hit? Play games, meet staff, and walk away with\
  \ new ways to experience Golarion! Pick up your scavenger hunt sheet at the Pathfinder\
  \ Society headquarters in the Grand Ballroom.</p> \n    <h2>Something Punny About\
  \ Seminars</h2> \n    <p>The \"What's New in the Adventure Card Game\" panel is\
  \ Saturday at 2 pm, and Mike, Vic and I—and perhaps some other Lone Sharks—will\
  \ be there to answer your questions and make up wildly improbable stories about\
  \ card design and development. We'll also have a little something to say about Mummy's\
  \ Mask at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet Saturday night. And I'll try and sneak into\
  \ the \"Pathfinder Society Q&amp;A\" on Sunday at 2:00 PM in case anyone has questions\
  \ about PFSACG matters. Finally, Obsidian Entertainment will be doing a \"Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures\" panel Sunday at 11:00 AM that will be worth your time. (Everyone\
  \ feel free to ask those panelists when <em>Hook Mountain Massacre</em> is coming\
  \ out so that I stop getting that question in email.)</p> \n    <h2>Recurring Art\
  \ Thing</h2> \n    <p>Hooray! It's time for more excellent art from the PACG archives!\
  \ From the upcoming Goblins Fight! Deck, the Animalbane Crossbow +2.</p> \n    <div\
