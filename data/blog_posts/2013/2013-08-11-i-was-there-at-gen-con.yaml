  \ my 30th Gen Con. As I sit back and think about my years going to the granddaddy\
  \ of all gaming conventions, I am awed by the many big moments that I got to experience\
  \ while attending the show, first as a fan and later as part of the adventure game\
  \ publishing industry.</p></span>\n             <p>When I was a kid, there was a\
  \ series of books for young readers, <em>We Were There</em>, with titles such as\
  \ <em>We Were There at the Battle of Gettysburg</em> and <em>We Were There at the\
  \ Battle of the Bulge</em>. Each book covered an important moment in world history\
  \ from a child's point of view; you read a fun story but also learned a bit of history\
  \ in the process. I ate these books up when I was in grade school. As I think across\
  \ the 30 Gen Cons I have attended, I think about some of the important pieces of\
  \ adventure game history that I have had the privilege of experiencing firsthand\
  \ at Gen Con. <em>I was there</em>!</p>\n             <div class=\"blurb120\">\n\

  \ artists</h2>\n             <p>At my first Gen Con in 1984, TSR brought in the\
  \ all-star cast of artists they had working full time on D&amp;D: Clyde Caldwell,\
  \ Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, and Keith Parkinson. Each took turns doing sketches\
  \ of people's characters for $10 a sketch—a bargain even then—and answering questions.\
  \ These four artists created the visuals for Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms,\
  \ and other settings, essentially defining the look of D&amp;D for the future, and\
  \ earning them places among the most famous artists in adventure gaming history.\
  \ Not only did I get to meet them, but Clyde Caldwell drew a sketch of my character,\
  \ Erwyle, that hangs on my office wall today.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ of the AD&amp;D Battlesystem</h2>\n             <p>In 1985, the year Gen Con moved\
  \ to Milwaukee, I was walking through the new convention center when my friend Rich\
  \ and I were asked to play in one of the first public games of the new AD&amp;D\
  \ Battlesystem. As neophytes at Gen Con, we jumped at the chance to experience this\
  \ important AD&amp;D product first hand. But that wasn't what made this experience\
  \ awesome: our two opponents in the battle were none other than Ed Greenwood (of\
  \ Forgotten Realms fame) and Mike Nystul (of <em>Nystul's Magic Aura</em> fame).\
  \ Where else but Gen Con could two young Minnesota gamers cross paths with two icons\
  \ of D&amp;D, and be the first to play a major new AD&amp;D release?</p>\n     \

  \             </div>\n             <h2>I was there for the launch of <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ Magazine</h2>\n             <p>One of the most seminal Gen Con moments in my mind\
  \ is the launch of <em>Dungeon</em> in 1986. As a fan of D&amp;D and TSR, I began\
  \ every Gen Con by running to the TSR booth and buying whatever cool new D&amp;D\
  \ product was being launched at the show. In 1986, that product was <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ Magazine. I ran to the booth and eagerly filled out my subscription form and gave\
  \ it to Kim Mohan. He informed me that I was the very first subscriber and handed\
  \ me my copy of the first issue. I couldn't believe it, so I had him autograph it\
  \ and inscribe \"Congrats on being the first subscriber\" on the title page. To\
  \ think, twenty-one years later, my own company would release the <em>last</em>\
  \ print issue of <em>Dungeon</em> at Gen Con 2007.</p>\n             <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n             </div>\n             <h2>I was there for the launch of Magic:\
  \ The Gathering</h2>\n             <p>Probably one of the biggest events in the\
  \ history of gaming happened at Gen Con 1993, and it was one that I had a big hand\
  \ in. The introduction of Magic: The Gathering to the teeming crowds of gamers was\
  \ a big part of my master plan for launching Magic into the marketplace. We didn't\
  \ have much money at Wizards of the Coast. We didn't have many employees—and we\
  \ couldn't afford to actually pay the few we did have. But Gen Con had the world's\
  \ most dedicated gamers coming together for four days in Milwaukee, and I figured\
  \ that if we couldn't convince <em>them</em> to play Magic, then the game probably\
  \ didn't have a chance. I put my tiny marketing budget into making the biggest splash\
  \ we could manage at Gen Con. We packed up every employee and volunteer we could\
  \ find and headed from Seattle to Milwaukee. We were ready for the world to see\
  \ our baby… but our baby almost didn't show up! Shenanigans in US Customs threatened\
  \ to cause our shipment from our card printer in Belgium to miss the convention!\
  \ Only after many phone calls and an overnight plane flight for our Magic boxes\
  \ were we able to unleash Magic on the world as I had hoped. And boy, did my plan\
  \ work! We sold decks and boosters and displays of Magic as fast as people could\
  \ hand over their money. By the end of the show, we were out of cards, Magic was\
  \ a phenomenon, and Wizards of the Coast had arrived!</p>\n             <h2>I was\
  \ there for the announcement of D&amp;D Third Edition</h2>\n             <p>Gen\
  \ Con 1999 was a big one for us at Wizards. We had purchased TSR less than two years\
  \ prior. And now we were going to announce that we were working on a new edition\
  \ of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and there was no better venue than at the \"Best Four\
  \ Days in Gaming!\" We knew there would be a lot of consternation over the announcement,\
  \ and if we didn't do it well, we would garner a lot of ill will. So we decided\
  \ to make the announcement to a thousand hardcore gamers in the form of a talk show.\
  \ The D&amp;D team spent weeks plotting and planning, lining up special guests including\
  \ Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, and getting the design team geared up with such speakers\
  \ as Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, Bill Slavicsek, and others. The announcement went\
  \ off without a hitch, and there were even several standing ovations. At the end\
  \ of the event, we handed out T-shirts listing various things about Third Edition\
  \ that we thought would tantalize the crowd:</p>\n             <ul>\n          \
  \    <li>Half-orc barbarian sorcerer = Yes</li>\n              <li>Demihuman level\
  \ limits = No</li>\n              <li>Monks &amp; Assassins = Yes</li>\n       \
  \       <li>Universal Skill System = Yes</li>\n              <li>Evil gnoll rangers\
  \ = Yes</li>\n              <li>THAC0 = No</li>\n              <li>Rules you never\
  \ used anyway = No</li>\n              <li>Demons &amp; Devils = Yes</li>\n    \
  \          <li>Critical Hits = Yes</li>\n              <li>9th-level clerical spells\
  \ = Yes</li>\n              <li>Ability score improvements = Yes</li>\n        \
  \      <li>Strength 48 = Yes \n               <p></p></li>\n             </ul>\n\
  \             <h2>I was there for the launch of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</h2>\n\
  \             <p>As Gen Con 2009 approached, there was a lot of trepidation in my\
  \ heart. Paizo would be launching the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and the reception\
  \ would either save the company or doom it. I could see no other outcome. Wizards\
  \ had launched 4th Edition at the previous Gen Con, and we had decided to forge\
  \ our own path. The pile of Core Rulebooks sitting on the floor of our booth was\
  \ our wager in this game; we'd put everything we had into making them. We were \"\
  all in.\" As the doors to the exhibit hall opened, we amazed by the waves of gamers\
  \ that poured into our booth to buy the Core Rulebook. The crowd quickly overwhelmed\
  \ our modest booth, and we had to route the line through the art show! That Gen\
  \ Con launch fueled the growth of both Paizo and Pathfinder.</p>\n             <div\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n             </div>\n             <p>And that's just the tip\
  \ of the iceberg! Every Gen Con, history is made somewhere. Events happen that will\
  \ be fodder for stories for years to come. \"The Best Four Days in Gaming\" are\
  \ the crucible where our hobby is forged and reforged, and when you go, you too\
  \ will be able to say <em>you were there</em>! I look forward to seeing you all\
  \ at Gen Con in just a few short weeks!</p>\n             <p>Lisa Stevens<br><em>CEO</em></p>\n\
