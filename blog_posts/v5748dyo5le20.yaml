  \  </div> \n    <p>Wow, it has been a while since we had a holiday blog. Well, back\
  \ by popular demand, we are offering you a new bit of info on a Golarion holiday,\
  \ as we celebrate our own federal holiday here in the United States—Veteran’s Day.\
  \ As a veteran myself, I want to send out a heartfelt thank you to veterans of all\
  \ five services. I know the sacrifice you have made for your country, and without\
  \ your service and sacrifice, I couldn’t have the cool job I have today. Take a\
  \ minute to pat yourself on the back and reflect on your decision to unselfishly\
  \ volunteer years of your life to make this country great.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Developer Adam Daigle gets his first shot at a Golarion holiday write\
  \ up. He wrote the below description for Evoking Day and you will find a special\
  \ Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet you can download and apply to a Pathfinder\
  \ Society character. Evoking Day is mentioned on page 249 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>.</span></p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>A holy day to followers of Nethys, Evoking Day is full\
  \ of vibrant explosions, skillful wielding of spells, and much dancing. Evoking\
  \ Day is observed on the 18th of Neth, and while this holiday is mostly celebrated\
  \ in Garund, temples dedicated to Nethys host celebrations throughout the Inner\
  \ Sea region. Traditional celebrations of Evoking Day have changed over the thousands\
  \ of years since its first incarnation, but to this day every occurrence of Evoking\
  \ Day still features a grand meal shared by celebrants during the afternoon and\
  \ a wondrous exhibition of brilliant and explosive magic once the sun sets. These\
  \ days, such colorful magical displays are augmented with fireworks of a dozen different\
  \ colors and patterns. </p> \n     <p>In temples of Nethys dedicated to revering\
  \ evocation magic, priests and prominent arcanists participate in spell duels where\
  \ each contestant stands on a raised platform and takes turns trying to incapacitate\
  \ her opponent. The magic wielded in theses duels favors the flashy over the dangerous,\
  \ but clerics of Nethys are on hand to treat any injuries. These duels gather large\
  \ crowds eager to lend their applause to their favorite contestant.</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ is also during this festival when wizards who worship Nethys open their spellbooks\
  \ to others who share their craft. Wizards normally guard their spellbooks with\
  \ their lives and covet the eldritch information therein, but on Evoking Day these\
  \ wizards meet with one another prior to the afternoon feast to share their spells\
  \ just as they prepare to share a grand meal.</p> \n     <p>Though Evoking Day is\
  \ primarily a day of grand magic, those with no spellcasting talent still flock\
  \ to local temples of Nethys to partake in the shared feast and flashy evening displays\
  \ of magic and fireworks. Between the meal and into the night, celebrants wear black-and-white\
  \ robes and perform joyous dances meant to give thanks to the wonders Nethys brought\
  \ to humankind. These dances are grand affairs involving dozens of dancers all spinning\
  \ and clapping to the accompanying music as their black-and-white robes fan out\
  \ around them with each spin. As night descends and the fireworks and magical displays\
  \ begin, the dancing rises to a climax erupting in shouts and calls to Nethys with\
  \ each thunderous boom.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p align=\"center\"><s>Click\
