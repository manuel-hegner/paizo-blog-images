  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi All! With Thanksgiving just\
  \ around the corner for us in the Paizo office, I wanted to do a blog that was more\
  \ personal. I'm a pretty private person by nature, so this isn't easy for me to\
  \ write, but it's worthwhile.</p> \n    <p>To say one more thing up front: anxiety\
  \ and depression affect a lot of people, and for those of us who deal with them,\
  \ society sometimes gives us a sense that they are something that needs to be hidden\
  \ away, or that they are something we should \"just get over\". Or, the real kicker\
  \ for me, that because there are people out there who have a harder life than we\
  \ do, that our feelings are somehow not valid. These ideas are preposterous and\
  \ unfair. They are <i>not</i> something that people can \"just get over\", and I\
  \ hope that by talking about my experiences, I can help someone else know that they\
  \ are far from alone, and that there is hope. If you are struggling alone, please\
  \ reach out and talk to someone you trust. People want to help a lot more than your\
  \ mind might let you realize.</p> \n    <p>This blog is primarily about my experience\
  \ with Pathfinder Society and the way it has benefitted my life, so it doesn't go\
  \ much into the other ways that I've sought help over the years. It's not the whole\
  \ story by a long shot, but it's an important piece.</p> \n    <p>When I first started\
  \ off with Pathfinder Society, it was a fun activity I did at Gen Con with a group\
  \ of friends. Then, when my home gaming group started scattering to the winds, we\
  \ turned to Pathfinder Society to recruit new people with something way less daunting\
  \ than our typical multi-year campaigns.</p> \n    <p>It was around this time that\
  \ our local and freshly minted Centure-Captain Don Walker put a request on the messageboards\
  \ for people to join him in an inaugural game at Pandemonium Books and Games. To\
  \ be honest, I wasn't really that sure about the idea of playing in a group of mostly\
  \ strangers. I was worried about whether they would accept me, and if I could open\
  \ up around them. But I wanted to give it a try, so I went to that game, and I had\
  \ a great time. And I kept going to games at Pandy, week after week. Over time,\
  \ my confidence grew to the point where I took up the GMing mantle and became the\
  \ store's organizer.</p> \n    <p>After graduating from college, I really struggled.\
  \ I'd had an idea of what I would be doing with my life, but nothing was coming\
  \ together the way I'd expected it. Anxiety and depression, which I'd been dealing\
  \ with on and off since my early teens, hit me hard. There were a lot of weeks where\
  \ the only thing that was able to draw me out of my apartment was my Sunday Pathfinder\
  \ Society game. I kept signing up to GM week after week, even though I would spend\
  \ every morning before the game filled with dread that, even though my last 10 games\
  \ or so had gone well, this one, THIS one I would definitely botch. Once the game\
  \ started going, though, I fell into a familiar groove. For those few hours, no\
  \ matter what else was going on, I could laugh and have a good time with familiar\
  \ and new players alike. After the games, I sometimes confided in the people I trusted\
  \ most about what was going on inside my mind, and their supportive words helped\
  \ push me to get the help I needed to claw back onto a better path in life. &nbsp;I\
  \ don't know if I ever really told them how much that support meant to me. So, to\
  \ all of my friends in the Boston Lodge, thank you.</p> \n    <p>Eventually, I became\
  \ a Venture-Lieutenant, taking on more responsibilities like organizing conventions\
  \ and overseeing interactive specials. I also started GMing at conventions, and\
  \ getting to know a lot more people in the community. And I have to say, you guys\
  \ are pretty great. I know I only know a handful of you, but I look forward to meeting\
  \ more of you each time I make it to a convention. I went from thinking that I would\
  \ just GM at stores sometimes to plotting out my path to the 10 specials needed\
  \ for my 5th star.</p> \n    <p>When the job posting for Paizo came up, I wasn't\
  \ going to apply. My anxiety told me that it would be a waste of Paizo's time, and\
  \ that there was no way they would hire me. But I was convinced to at least try.\
  \ And, as you all know, Paizo hired me. I knew I wanted to work with Organized Play,\
  \ and I was fortunate enough to get placed doing exactly that. Thank you, everyone\
  \ at Paizo, and especially John Compton, for showing me the ropes. Thank you for\
  \ making this a truly amazing place to work.</p> \n    <p>I don't want to give the\
  \ impression that everything is always sunny, or that I have somehow erased my tendencies\
  \ toward anxiety and depression from my mind. &nbsp;But when they flare up, just\
  \ as before, the Pathfinder Society community helps me get back on my feet. About\
  \ a year ago, when I was walking home from work, I got hit by a car. I had a concussion,\
  \ and a few things in my head got knocked out of whack. Among other things, I became\
  \ intensely fearful, particularly of being any significant distance from my house.\
  \ Fortunately, the Paizo offices aren't that far from home, so I was able to transition\
  \ back to work after the holidays. In February, though, I had committed to fly out\
  \ to TotalCon, and I was not going to cancel on that unless I absolutely had to.\
  \ So, I went. Lisa and David Neilson hosted me in their home before the convention\
  \ started, and helped me cope with the storm inside my head. I didn't want to color\
  \ the convention experience of the new people I met with my anxieties, so I did\
  \ what I had learned to do back after college. I put on my game face and I let my\
  \ experience as a GM take over until I could push the fear back. And I confided\
  \ in my friends from the community. That cross-country flight was the first thing\
  \ to pull me more than 3 miles from my apartment in 4 months, and many of the experiences\
  \ I had at TotalCon were immensely helpful in pulling myself back together. So,\
  \ to those I spoke with and gamed with at TotalCon, and to Lisa and David in particular,\
  \ thank you.</p> \n    <p>One of the best things about wearing the \"blue shirt\"\
  \ is being able to dedicate much of my time to the Pathfinder Society community.\
  \ It's sitting with John and Thursty and cackling with glee as we come up with new\
  \ and exciting plots to throw at your characters. It's working together with freelancers\
  \ to make the best scenarios we can for you. It's learning from experience, and\
  \ especially from your feedback, how to make things better for the future. And it's\
  \ getting to meet so many more of you in person. So, to all of you, thank you for\
  \ being awesome.</p> \n    <p>What are you grateful for in our community? What has\
  \ Pathfinder Society brought to your life? Are there any particular community members\
  \ you would like to call out for their positive influence?</p> \n    <p>Linda Zayas-Palmer<br>\
