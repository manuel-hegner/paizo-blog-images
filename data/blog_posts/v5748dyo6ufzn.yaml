  \ in the <a href=\"#catch-up\">links below.</a></em></p>\n      <p>The Black Powder\
  \ Cadre met its match!</p>\n      <p>It took eight levels of the Abomination Vaults\
  \ to finally run into something that not only exposed a severe weakness in our party,\
  \ but also exploited it. Again, and again. Let’s see, what could possibly shut down\
  \ a party of mostly human gunslingers? Magical <em>darkness</em> should be near\
  \ the top of the list. Make it heightened <em>darkness</em>, just to mess with those\
  \ darkvision elixirs. How about a community of creatures that can throw <em>darkness</em>\
  \ back at our desperados like a box of bang snaps? Well, the caligni we encountered\
  \ on level eight did exactly that, and hit us from so many directions in the dark\
  \ that we had to snag a high Perception DC just to find our own wounds. Then we\
  \ learned there was another community of caligni below us on level nine. Yeah, this\
  \ was a rough marathon.</p>\n      <p>To get to level nine we had to get past level\
  \ eight, and we were in new territory here. We had switched authors from Vanessa\
  \ Hoskins to Stephen Radney-MacFarland—a grizzled veteran whose plethora of work\
  \ in this industry takes us back to when our own veterans had a lot more hair. In\
  \ fact, level eight of the Abomination Vaults paid homage to an adventure module\
  \ that carries plenty of nostalgia around our table: <em>Against the Cult of the\
  \ Reptile God</em>. We first played it in ‘96, and our GM liked it so much that\
  \ he ran it again for us in 2005 and 2009. Level eight of the Vaults even hinted\
  \ at some of our favorite scenes from the soggy, humid dungeon we remember: the\
  \ infamous “mud room,” the off-limits door with a very clear warning on it, boats\
  \ to traverse the level, and even the naga boss you can only reach by water.</p>\n\

  \ all over again at 6:00 a.m. when Adam blasts our soundtrack to wake the team.\
  \ You’ll eat well though, and there’s always a bonfire at the end of the weekend.\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Highlights from Marathon 6:</h2>\n      <p>□\
  \ On level eight we found ourselves surrounded in a temple by caligni stalkers and\
  \ their endless <em>darkness</em>. Put it this way: we got good at flat checks.\
  \ As if things couldn’t get worse, something called an owb showed up. A creature\
  \ with a background as shadowy as the caligni themselves, this thing can turn you\
  \ from our cadre’s shared blue colors to drab gray—and even turn your gun gray,\
  \ which is where we drew the line. Joe came through with the Beast Gunner, landing\
  \ a couple of devastating shots from his drake rifle that allowed us to walk away\
  \ alive and most importantly, blue.</p>\n      <p>□ If you’ve followed our projects\
  \ over the years, then you know we despise gugs, in-game and out. We came across\
  \ another one, which held something called a <em>fulcrum lens</em> that we unfortunately\
  \ needed. One of our snipers, Mazatl, practicing the Way of the Spellshot and wearing\
  \ what Erick calls “dungeon camo,” crept into position. Erick is even known to wear\
  \ a ghillie suit at the table to mimic his <em>cloak of elvenkind</em>. Can you\
  \ find Mazatl in the photo? The sniper aimed for the head and landed the first shot,\
  \ but the gug still tore into us for six rounds before we put it down.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>□ Think you can predict what a Pathfinder megadungeon has in store for you?\
  \ Enter level nine, with its 10-foot scale in the original version of the adventure.\
  \ We’re going to have to lay this one out on the patio to get a full pic for the\
  \ next blog. It’s also level nine where you really get a sense of just how interconnected\
  \ this megadungeon is to the Darklands that surround it, which is evident as the\
  \ worked stone in the levels above has now shifted to caverns. Since we’ve delved\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8yqx?Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon\"\
  >The Emerald Spire</a> and measured its square footage, we can say that level nine\
  \ is what helps the Abominaton Vaults achieve its title as the largest megadungeon\
  \ in Pathfinder history!</p>\n      <p>□ A massive dungeon level just meant more\
  \ reach for our shooters. We’d been waiting nine levels to see the 150’ range on\
  \ both the harmona and arquebus truly rip, and honestly, in a dungeon we never thought\
  \ we’d see it. When Breen spotted four ceustodaemons on some kind of guard duty,\
  \ it just meant long range fun. We opened initiative, and one was on the ground\
  \ before they heard the shots.</p>\n      <p>□ Level nine was full of towering bioluminescent\
  \ fungi, which meant breaking out the blacklights for the truest experience. It\
  \ also meant getting ourselves into a fungal forest firefight with reaper skull\
  \ puffballs. Don’t be fooled by the name like we were; these things are badass.\
  \ Go look at the illustration inside <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024xm?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-165-Eyes-of-Empty-Death\"\
  >Eyes of Empty Death</a> and tell us that the miniatures we had to represent them\
  \ weren’t darn near perfect, too. Better yet, an exploded puffball is worth 150\
  \ gp! Zoric, the cadre’s Unexpected Sharpshooter, scored both money shots and made\
  \ it rain.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2>\n      <p>□ None, but\
  \ everyone in this party owes another thank you to Breen, Way of the Pistolero.\
  \ When you’re surrounded by hostiles and bleeding out, it’s our pistol phenom that\
  \ will pull you to safety and cauterize your wounds—popping off rounds in the process.</p>\n\

  \      <h2>The Arsenal</h2>\n      <p>Order of the Amber Die doesn’t have a session\
  \ zero before our campaigns begin. We start somewhere around session negative eight.\
  \ In one of those meetings, our player captain had us brainstorm ways that we might\
  \ cause awkward encounters throughout an Adventure Path by making an entire party\
  \ of gunslingers. No one suggested anything close to what we came across on level\
  \ eight of the Vaults. We encountered some drow who took us to their outpost on\
  \ the level below, packed with none other than the Darklands equivalent of our own\
  \ gunslingers: the Drow Shootist archetype and their repeating crossbows. We hit\
  \ it off almost instantly, and soon we were sharing stories over a game of cards,\
  \ including tales of the best and luckiest shots we’ve landed during our time in\
  \ the Vaults. Even the art for Quara, their leader, showed her with a bandolier\
  \ and a set of dueling boots that matched plenty of members in our cadre. She also\
  \ had a scar across her face from—guess what—a gug. Naturally, we ended up at their\
  \ firing range, where they allowed Vlai to have his dwarven scattergun (with large\
  \ bore modifications) for a friendly competition. With all three targets destroyed\
  \ in a single 15’ radius hit, we won.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Best Quote from\
  \ Marathon 6</h2>\n      <p>(fierce battle in a caligni temple)</p>\n      <p>Adam:\
  \ “Caligni stalker is near death, cornered, attacks Axayaca. Gotta go to the Amber\
  \ Die for this one.”</p>\n      <p>Matt (to Joe): “This is when the Amber Die usually\
  \ goes off.”</p>\n      <p>Joe: “...”</p>\n      <p>Adam: “First attack hits… Second\
  \ attack… 20! Attack you again, agile, -8 penalty… NATURAL 20!”</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>Current Situation</h2>\n      <p>Well, we’ve made it to the final game\
  \ of the season—this next marathon is the last one either way. We’re trying not\
  \ to let the pressure get to us; we keep telling ourselves it’s just another marathon.\
  \ If we do succeed in defeating Belcorra, then drow aid must be accounted for. Not\
  \ only are they a source of items, trade, and safety, but the drow have become our\
  \ friends—we certainly don’t have many on the surface. From conversations with their\
  \ scouts, we’ve learned of a dragon’s lair on level nine. The drow avoid it. Which,\
  \ of course, meant that we took a party vote to fight it. Come on, you know it’\
  s once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Pathfinder player to slay a dragon with\
  \ a party of gunslingers!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
