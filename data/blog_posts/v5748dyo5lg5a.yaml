  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Jirelle may have been born and raised on a ship,\
  \ and she might call the Shackles her homeland, but she never considered herself\
  \ a pirate, even if only to distance herself from the darkest part of her childhood:\
  \ her mother.</p> \n      <p>Today, Jirelle is a friendly sort with a biting wit\
  \ and a charming personality. She makes new friends as swiftly as she strikes with\
  \ her rapier, and while she has a flair for the dramatic (why merely attack a foe\
  \ when you can make a show of it with a twirl of the cape or a somersault or two?),\
  \ she never favors ostentation or glory over the opportunity to help a friend in\
  \ need. Jirelle understands that the strength of one's relationships with friends,\
  \ allies, lovers, and family make one strong. It was her mother's failure to forge\
  \ such bonds that allowed a young Jirelle to escape from a life that would have\
  \ likely seen offered as sacrifice to the shark demon Ovonovo before the close of\
  \ her thirteenth birthday.</p> \n      <p>On the subject of her mother or her ship,\
  \ the <i>Bloodcrow</i>, the typically light-hearted half-elf grows serious. Jirelle\
  \ does not share the secrets of her childhood with just anyone. As such, few know\
  \ how she engineered the sinking of the <i>Bloodcrow</i> and the death of her wretched\
  \ elven mother off the coast of Tempest Cay. Jirelle often jokes that she befriends\
  \ for life, with the playful, only slightly malicious glint in her eyes implying\
  \ what might happen to those who would betray such friendship.</p> \n      <p>After\
  \ escaping the <i>Bloodcrow</i>, Jirelle spent some time surviving as a street rat\
  \ in the alleys of Drenchport. Armed with a fine rapier and clad in her her mother's\
  \ magical cloak (the only two things she managed to escape the <i>Bloodcrow</i>'s\
  \ wreckage with), Jirelle kept every coin and bauble she earned in a thrice-locked\
  \ chest she keeps well hidden and protected. At first, she'd hoped to save enough\
  \ money to afford a move from the Shackles to distant Taldor, drawn by tales of\
  \ a land where duels and extravagance and civility promised a better life. But when\
  \ rumors of a strange, ghostly ship plying the sea-ways of the Shackles reached\
  \ her—fearful stories of a vessel commanded by an imperious banshee and bound by\
  \ undeath—Jirelle realized that in sinking the <i>Bloodcrow</i> she'd done the exact\
  \ opposite of what she'd intended. Rather than spare the Shackles of a brutal pirate\
  \ queen, she'd unleashed an even deadlier scourge upon the Fever Sea.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Today, Jirelle seeks the funds to someday finance a ship and crew of her\
  \ own. She plans not to become a pirate—for a life of plunder and cruelty holds\
  \ no appeal for the daring swashbuckler—but to finish the job she started on the\
  \ eve of her thirteenth birthday. Jirelle knows she can't do this on her own, though.\
  \ So she seeks true and able allies, knowing that only with bravery and trust will\
  \ the <i>Bloodcrow</i>'s days be numbered.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>James\
