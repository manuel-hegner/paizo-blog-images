  \            <p itemprop=\"description\">As part of our announcement for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition, we recorded a game session with the hilarious crew from the <a\
  \ href=\"https://glasscannonpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Glass Cannon Network</a>.\
  \ They were kind enough to invite us to their studio in New York, where Erik Mona\
  \ and I playtested the game with them, converting the first ever Pathfinder Module,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy89c9?Pathfinder-Module-Crypt-of-the-Everflame\"><em>Crypt\
  \ of the Everflame</em></a>, to the new rules.</p>\n             <p>Because this\
  \ was a live session, and because I was converting this adventure \"on the fly,\"\
  \ I thought it might be useful to all the listeners out there to include a companion\
  \ blog post that explores some of the spoilers from the recording and corrects a\
  \ few of the mistakes that we made during play.</p>\n             <p>Note that the\
  \ following commentary includes spoilers, so if you have not listened to the podcast,\
  \ you should probably go and download it from the Glass Cannon Network site right\
  \ now (or from wherever you subscribe to podcasts). Entries include an approximate\
  \ time stamp to let you know at what point they happen during the session.</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurb360\">\n              <a href=\"https://glasscannonpodcast.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9520_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \             </div>\n             <h2>Commentary for Part 1</h2>\n            \
  \ <p>This commentary refers to the first part of the podcast.</p>\n            \
  \ <ul>\n              <li>(03:00) I should note that the new version of Pathfinder\
  \ has been in design now for well over two years. The first playtest of the core\
  \ mechanics was only a few months into the design process, back in 2016.</li>\n\
  \              <li><b>(04:00)</b> Obligatory Princess Bride reference.</li>\n  \
  \            <li><b>(04:40)</b> The only preparation for this adventure was to pull\
  \ together existing monster statistics that correspond to those in the adventure.\
  \ So, if the adventure featured wolves, the document I had with me had the new wolf\
  \ stat block. Nothing else was converted—not the traps, random skill challenges,\
  \ or monsters—without a corresponding converted stat block.</li>\n             \
  \ <li><b>(06:00)</b> This is the actual beginning of the module, starting with player\
  \ and character introductions and the reveal of the adventure they are about to\
  \ undertake. For ease of reference, the players and their characters listed here:\
  \ \n               <blockquote>\n                <p><b><em>Pherise (Matthew Capodicasa)</em></b>,\
  \ Elf Rogue<br><b><em>Mamolo Blunch (Skid Maher)</em></b>, Goblin Alchemist<br><b><em>Keith\
  \ Slashmaster (Troy Lavallee)</em></b>, Human Fighter<br><b><em>Grellun the Green\
  \ (Erik Mona)</em></b>, Human Wizard,<br><b><em>Emmerich Kant (Joe O'Brien)</em></b>,\
  \ Human Paladin<br><b><em>Sifferus Sufferas the Vociferous (Grant Berger)</em></b>,\
  \ Human Cleric</p>\n               </blockquote></li>\n              <li><b>(31:40)</b>\
  \ The first skill check in the game is a Society check. This skill covers knowledge\
  \ about towns, people, their customs, and their history. The information they are\
  \ looking for here is relatively common knowledge, and the number they needed to\
  \ roll (the Difficulty Class) is only a 10. Keith (Troy) fumbled the check and got\
  \ false information, which was quickly debunked by the others.</li>\n          \
  \    <li><b>(35:30)</b> The party leaves town, entering exploration mode as they\
  \ venture into the Fangwood.</li>\n              <li><b>(39:00)</b> Erik, playing\
  \ Grellun, just starts reading the spell descriptions from his character folio.\
  \ Of note, when he reads off <em>acid splash</em>, he mentions \"somatic\" and \"\
  verbal,\" which does not seem to be much of a spoiler, but those are actually the\
  \ names of the two actions you must spend to cast the spell!</li>\n            \
  \  <li><b>(39:50)</b> To keep the adventure moving along, in the hope to make this\
  \ only a few hours long in total, there are a number of minor encounters that get\
  \ skipped. During the journey, for example, I left out the encounter with the wolves,\
  \ as it is ultimately unnecessary to the overall plot. Of course, the game still\
  \ ran extremely long, due in large part to the fact that we were just having too\
  \ much fun.</li>\n              <li><b>(40:10)</b> Here we have the first fight\
  \ of the game, against a trio of bloodthirsty orcs.</li>\n              <li><b>(43:50)</b>\
  \ That's right, Perception is no longer a skill. Your class gives you an initial\
  \ proficiency in Perception and might possibly increase it over time.</li>\n   \
  \           <li><b>(47:30)</b> A note on attacking more than once in a round. If\
  \ he had attacked with all three of his actions, the third attack would have been\
  \ at an even larger penalty.</li>\n              <li><b>(54:10)</b> Most of the\
  \ maneuvers—grabbing, disarming, tumbling, and tripping—are now associated with\
  \ the Acrobatics or Athletics skills.</li>\n              <li><b>(59:00)</b> As\
  \ the fight rages on, it quickly becomes apparent to some of the characters that\
  \ these orcs are not real. Created by illusion magic, they vanish the moment they\
  \ are struck. These phantom foes are created using a new spell called illusory creature.\
  \ Created by a hidden wizard, these orcs are bit more difficult to hit than ordinary\
  \ foes, basing their statistics on the caster. The fact that they are a spell also\
  \ explains why they have only two actions each turn and hit for so little damage\
  \ (all of which is halved once the illusion is revealed).</li>\n              <li><b>(1:05:30)</b>\
  \ The developers made me change that back. Neon green dice once again roll just\
  \ as well as any other color of dice.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:07:20)</b> Nimble\
  \ Dodge has seen a lot of play in office playtests and has saved the lives of countless\
  \ rogues.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:11:40)</b> The characters in this playtest\
  \ have decent bonuses to attack, but that is of little help when everyone is rolling\
  \ lower than 10. No amount of redesign can account for fickle dice.</li>\n     \
  \         <li><b>(1:16:00)</b> A note on flanking. I made a small error here. Flanking\
  \ does not grant you a +2 bonus to hit. Instead, it now makes the target flat-footed\
  \ to your attacks, causing it to take a –2 penalty to its AC. It's the same result,\
  \ but the distinction is relevant.</li>\n             </ul>\n             <h2>Commentary\
  \ for Part 2</h2>\n             <ul>\n              <li><b>(02:30)</b> I call that\
  \ a skill unlock, which is an old term for what we now call a skill feat, which\
  \ characters get starting at 2nd level.</li>\n              <li><b>(05:00)</b> Small\
  \ mistake here. The three-action casting of <em>heal</em> does indeed target everyone\
  \ in the group, but it heals only an amount equal to the caster's spellcasting ability\
  \ modifier at this level (which should be only 4).</li>\n              <li><b>(07:10)</b>\
  \ I probably should have waited until he rolled to announce the result.</li>\n \
  \             <li><b>(11:10)</b> The Survival skill can be used to navigate in the\
  \ wild, make a shelter, and find food. In this case, instead of making shelter,\
  \ the skill was used to simply find a good, defensible place to camp.</li>\n   \
  \           <li><b>(14:10)</b> Remnants of the wolf encounter that I decided to\
  \ skip to keep things moving.</li>\n              <li><b>(19:00)</b> Okay, I admit,\
  \ my description of the body may have been a bit too detailed, but it is important\
  \ for the tone shift that happens at this point in the adventure. Things are starting\
  \ to get serious.</li>\n              <li><b>(21:10)</b> This really does begin\
  \ to show the relationship between proficiencies and crafting that will undoubtedly\
  \ be the topic of a future blog post. Suffice it to say, the higher your proficiency,\
  \ the higher the quality of the items that you can craft.</li>\n              <li><b>(23:50)</b>\
  \ For clarity, there is a pair of puncture wounds on the upper torso and another\
  \ on the lower torso. The punctures are about an inch in diameter, with the pair\
  \ about 12 inches apart.</li>\n              <li><b>(24:20)</b> The only way the\
  \ illusion is detected is if it is lower-level than the detection spell. If it is\
  \ of the same level, it is unnoticed.</li>\n              <li><b>(36:10)</b> In\
  \ converting this particular hazard, I treated the various results on the table\
  \ as the failure, critical failure, success, and critical success results of the\
  \ new effect. The DC was changed to 15. I modified the damage a little, but the\
  \ only other significant change was to remove the ability damage from the critical\
  \ failure effect, replacing it with a condition to represent a sprained ankle.</li>\n\
  \              <li><b>(46:10)</b> If this were during combat, when time was short,\
  \ I could have called for an Athletics skill check to move the horse carcass, instead\
  \ of just looking at their Strength scores and figuring out how much spare bulk\
  \ they had to move it around.</li>\n              <li><b>(51:50)</b> Repeated the\
  \ mistake here with <em>heal</em> again. It should have been only 4 points restored.</li>\n\
  \              <li><b>(55:10)</b> The skeletons here are not very powerful undead,\
  \ but in large numbers like this, they can be deadly. Most problematic, they have\
  \ resistance 5 to weapon damage, but they still have a weakness to bludgeoning,\
  \ which can cancel out that protection.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:01:20)</b>\
  \ Skeletons also have resistance 5 against fire damage.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:05:25)</b>\
  \ Claws are agile weapons, which is why the skeletons use them as their second attack,\
  \ reducing the penalty on the attack roll to –4.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:09:00)</b>\
  \ The Shield Block reaction is very powerful, preventing damage by forcing the foe\
  \ to beat its way through your protection. It does mean that warriors tend to go\
  \ through shields with some frequency.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:11:00)</b>\
  \ The shield spell is also a cantrip, meaning that you can cast it as often as you\
  \ like.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:13:30)</b> Explaining the confusion, there\
  \ was an earlier draft of <em>acid splash</em> that hit multiple targets. That is\
  \ no longer the case.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:16:10)</b> Troy just cannot\
  \ roll above a 5 in this fight.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:19:00)</b> I finally\
  \ realized that I was doing the heal spell wrong, and then promptly missed the part\
  \ where the skeletons should get a save against the effect. Fortunately, it didn't\
  \ matter much; they were all pretty damaged at this point.</li>\n              <li><b>(1:21:45)</b>\
  \ Sweeping the leg is probably an Athletics skill check...</li>\n              <li><b>(1:24:50)</b>\
  \ There are two doors leading out of the room: one to the east, one to the west.\
  \ The scream came from the west. Somewhere in the dungeon, a tortured soul calls\
  \ out for help.</li>\n             </ul>\n             <p>That wraps up this look\
  \ at the first part of the playtest podcast with the Glass Cannon Network. Stop\
  \ by on Monday when we will be investigating how you level up using the new rules!</p>\n\
