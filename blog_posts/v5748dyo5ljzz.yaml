  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">To understand the technomancer class,\
  \ it is necessary to remember that Starfinder is set in a universe where magic is\
  \ a real, known, fundamental force of the universe. Just as some scientists study\
  \ physics, and some study chemistry, in Starfinder it is possible to apply the scientific\
  \ method to the understanding and manipulation of magic itself. With that context\
  \ set, let's see how the Starfinder Core Rulebook defines the class:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>To the uninitiated, magic and technology are completely unrelated,\
  \ but you know there are more correlations between the two than most suspect. Magic\
  \ and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy,\
  \ they can be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech\
  \ to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control,\
  \ and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of\
  \ the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your\
  \ technomancy— which is gained from scientific study and experimentation—manipulates\
  \ the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space,\
  \ and if necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n \
  \   <p>The technomancer has Intelligence as its key ability score, as this modifies\
  \ its spells per day, many of its core skills, and the save DCs of its spells and\
  \ class features. The class has an average attack bonus, poor Fortitude and Reflex\
  \ saves, good Will saves, four skill points per level, and eight class skills. The\
  \ class grants proficiency with light armor and proficiency (and eventually specialization)\
  \ with basic melee weapons and small arms. Like the mystic, the game's other core\
  \ spellcasting class, the technomancer is a spontaneous spellcasting class. It gains\
  \ access to technomancer spells, ranging from 0-level to 6th level, which represent\
  \ a significant part of their power.</p> \n    <p>Technomancer spells are more likely\
  \ to focus on modifying, emulating, or interacting with technologic devices, evoking\
  \ or manipulating core energy types (especially fire and electricity), and manipulating\
  \ or altering raw magical forces. How a technomancer operates can be strongly influenced\
  \ by their choice of spells known—<i>caustic conversion</i>, <i>logic bomb</i>,\
  \ and <i>microbot assault</i> are all useful 2nd-level offensive technomancer spells,\
  \ but each comes with its own advantages and limitations.</p> \n    <p>Technomancers\
  \ also receive numerous class features to represent their use of technology and\
  \ scientific principles in the manipulation of magic. Beginning at 1st level, technomancers\
  \ gain access to a spell cache, which initially allows you to once per day cast\
  \ any one spell you know without expending a spell slot. In time, you add a cache\
  \ capacitor, which allows you to store specific spell effects in your spell cache,\
  \ giving them 24-hour durations. At very high level, technomancers even gain the\
  \ ability to regain Resolve Points when they cast their most powerful spells, and\
  \ can fuse lower-level spell slots together to cast higher-level spells (or, if\
  \ you combine two 6th-level spell slots and spend two Resolve Points, even cast\
  \ <i>wish</i>).</p> \n    <p>Technomancers also select from a list of magic hacks,\
  \ at 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, which are special abilities focused\
  \ on manipulating magic, technology, or both. Magic hacks are often fueled by spell\
  \ slots, giving technomancers a new (often very flexible) way to use that resource,\
  \ but can also modify spells as you cast them, channel battery power into a spell\
  \ a limited number of times per day, expend (in rare cases) Resolve to create impressive\
  \ effects, or even simply let you use computers to set up magical surveillance or\
  \ give you additional spells known. Aside from spell selection, magic hacks are\
  \ the major customizable element of the technomancer class.</p> \n    <p>Here's\
  \ a sample magic hack, this one available at 5th level.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p><b>Fabricate Arms (Su)</b><br> As a full action, you can expend an unused\
  \ spell slot to temporarily construct a technological weapon or suit of armor out\
  \ of raw magic. You can create one suit of armor or weapon with a level equal to\
  \ or less than the level of the expended spell slot × 3, to a maximum of your caster\
  \ level. The item appears in your hands, on your person, or in an adjacent square.\
  \ You can use fuse spells with this magic hack. A weapon can't be larger than two-handed,\
  \ and the size of the item can't exceed 10 bulk. The quality of the item is average\
  \ for its type. Treat this as a spell of the same level as the expended spell slot.\
  \ For example, at 10th level, you could expend a 3rd-level spell slot to fabricate\
  \ a weapon of 9th level or lower, or expend a 4th- level spell slot to fabricate\
  \ a suit of armor of 10th level or lower. The armor or weapon persists for a number\
  \ of rounds equal to your technomancer level. At the end of this duration, the item\
  \ disappears. You are proficient with (but not specialized in) any weapons you create\
  \ with this ability. You can't create magic items, weapons made from a special material,\
  \ or weapons that are expended with use (such as arrows, grenades, or missiles)\
  \ with this magic hack.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Owen KC Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
