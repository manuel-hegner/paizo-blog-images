  \ Preview #2</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 8, 2010</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ start of Gen Con 2010 is four weeks away, which means in just one month, the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> will\
  \ be hitting game stores and subscriber mailboxes. In anticipation of this mighty\
  \ sourcebook, I am taking you on a guided tour, touching on some of the highlights\
  \ each week until release. Last week we took at look at the races chapter and the\
  \ new alternate favored class bonuses. This week we are diving into Chapter 2: Classes\
  \ by looking at the six new base classes.</p> \n    <p>If you were not a part of\
  \ the playtest of these classes, might I suggest that you grab the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8daf\"\
  >playtest document</a>, which is still available here at <b>paizo.com</b>. Now go\
  \ read up on the all of the new classes. Don't worry, I'll wait. All finished, good.\
  \ I am going to walk through each of the classes and spend a bit of time talking\
  \ about what changes you can expect to find in the book.</p> \n    <table border=\"\

  \    <p><b>Alchemist</b>: Using all sorts of alchemical formulas, bombs, and mutagens,\
  \ this class is focused on using strange concoctions to enhance the alchemist and\
  \ damage his foes. Most of the changes to this class center around new discoveries\
  \ that were added. Discoveries allow the alchemist to enhance his bombs and mutagens,\
  \ but we added discoveries that allow him to use his bombs to dispel magic or to\
  \ work better with poison, such as this new discovery.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p><i>Concentrate Poison</i>: The alchemist can combine two doses of the same\
  \ poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1\
  \ minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison.\
  \ The poison's frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><b>Cavalier</b>: This mounted warrior is skilled\
  \ at directing allies around the battlefield and granting bonuses to his teammates.\
  \ Each is dedicated to a specific order that grants abilities specific to his focus.\
  \ Most of the changes from the playtest version of the cavalier are relatively small\
  \ or designed to clarify an existing ability. For example, we clarified how large\
  \ the cavalier's banner must be and how it must be displayed to grant its bonus\
  \ to the cavalier's allies.</p> \n    <p><b>Inquisitor</b>: Rooting out enemies\
  \ of the faith, wherever they might hide, the inquisitor uses the powers of her\
  \ faith to ruthlessly destroy her foes. One of her signature abilities is to declare\
  \ judgment on one of her foes, granting her bonuses when fighting that enemy. The\
  \ playtest version of this ability improved as the combat progressed. While this\
  \ was a fun mechanic, it was ultimately rather unwieldy in play and was replaced\
  \ with a simpler system. Now, whenever the inquisitor uses her judgment ability,\
  \ she selects the type and gains a bonus based on her level. For example, take a\
  \ look at this judgment of purity.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Purity</i>:\
  \ The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred\
  \ bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor\
  \ levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases,\
  \ and poisons.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><b>Oracle</b>: The oracle draws\
  \ her power from the gods, but not one in particular. Her power is derived from\
  \ her belief in a chosen mystery, which guides her and grants her additional powers.\
  \ There were two big changes to the oracle from the playtest version. First, the\
  \ bonus spells granted by the oracle's mystery are now granted a level sooner than\
  \ before (the first arrives at 2nd level instead of 3rd). The second is the addition\
  \ of the Life mystery, with powers like the following.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Enhanced Cures (Su)</i>: Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum\
  \ number of hit points healed is based on your oracle level, not the limit based\
  \ on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of life with this revelation may\
  \ cast <i>cure light wounds</i> to heal 1d8+11 hit points.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Summoner</b>: The summoner is bonded to a special outsider, known\
  \ as an eidolon, that gains powers and abilities as the summoner gains levels. His\
  \ spells and class features all support this powerful, ever-changing ally. Most\
  \ of the changes to this class were relatively small in nature, but the big one\
  \ was a change to how often the summoner can call his eidolon. He can now summon\
  \ the ally as often as he likes (provided it has not been banished due to damage\
  \ recently), but he cannot use his <i>summon monster</i> ability at the same time.\
  \ This allows him to keep the flexibility needed with the summoned creatures, but\
  \ prevents him from overrunning the battlefield with too many creatures.</p> \n\

  >Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table> \n\
  \    <p><b>Witch</b>: The witch is an arcane spellcaster with an extensive spell\
  \ list of spells drawn from both the wizard and cleric spell lists. She also gains\
  \ powerful hexes that she can use to augment herself or harm her enemies. The biggest\
  \ change made to the witch involves her familiar, the creature that helps her to\
  \ understand magic and serves as an envoy of the witch's mysterious patron. Now\
  \ the bonus spells granted by a witch's familiar are no longer tied to the type\
  \ of familiar, giving the witch a lot more flexibility in concept and theme. We\
  \ also made a number of changes to the witch's hexes, including making flight a\
  \ basic hex that does not grant true flight until 5th level, and added a few others\
  \ here and there to round out the witch concept. For example, what witch would be\
  \ caught without a cauldron.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Cauldron</i>:\
  \ The witch receives Brew Potion as a bonus feat and a +4 insight bonus on Craft\
  \ (alchemy) skill checks.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Well, that just about\
  \ rounds up our look at the six new base classes in the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>.\
  \ Next week, we will continue exploring the mighty classes chapter (which is about\
  \ 1/3 of the book) by taking a closer look at all of the options available to the\
  \ core classes from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n  \
