  description\">Wrangling 16 authors to write 16 levels of a massive superdungeon\
  \ is no small feat, but after getting the physical copy of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"\
  >The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</a> in our hands we can say that it was totally\
  \ worth it.</span></p> \n    <p>There is enough high adventure and dungeon delving\
  \ between these covers to keep a group of players entertained for a long time. Although\
  \ this massive module can take a group of heroes from their meager beginnings as\
  \ 1st-level adventurers all the way to the high end of 13th level, game masters\
  \ can run one-night adventures with individual levels. Alternately, a GM could take\
  \ four or five levels of the dungeon and cobble together a mini-campaign hitting\
  \ on just a few of the levels that most interest them and their group.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Our own publisher, Erik Mona, designed Level 14, and his dungeon would make\
  \ a great ending for one of these compacted campaigns. This level also serves as\
  \ one of the most interconnected levels of the whole superdungeon. But don’t just\
  \ listen to me—let’s let Erik speak for himself and share some of his experiences\
  \ designing Level 14: The Throne of Azlant.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>How\
  \ do you define a \"Superdungeon\"? What is your favorite dungeon or superdungeon\
  \ experience in your personal gaming history?</b></p> \n     <p>A superdungeon is\
  \ a multi-level collection of mini dungeons that combine to form a locale suitable\
  \ for an entire campaign's worth of exploration. The best superdungeons allow for\
  \ repeated forays in and out of the dungeon, and the majority of a character's growth\
  \ and development (both in terms of story and game statistics) can occur without\
  \ too much deviation from exploration of the singular, epic location—if that's what\
  \ the players want.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb90\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9545-Level14.jpg\"\

  \     <br>Cartography by Rob Lazzaretti\n     </div> \n     <p>I've run several\
  \ campaigns based around the classic Temple of Elemental Evil dungeon (how cool\
  \ is it that the co-author of that adventure is one of my co-authors on this project?),\
  \ with general success. The opening levels of that dungeon—particularly the moathouse\
  \ section—are among my favorite dungeon levels in all of gaming. I had the opportunity\
  \ to playtest Monte Cook's Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil with the author\
  \ himself back in the early days of third edition, and I really loved the way Monte\
  \ updated the adventure I'd run so many times before, so my affection for the adventure\
  \ transcends three editions (I have not yet managed to run it in Pathfinder, alas).\
  \ Each time I've run the classic version it's been completely different. One group\
  \ decided to knock over the village of Hommlet's jewelry store and ended up outlaws.\
  \ Another got completely wiped out on the third level of the dungeon. No group I've\
  \ ever run through the temple has ever made it all the way through. Sure, a few\
  \ of them died, but mostly people just ended up losing interest, or the campaign\
  \ went on long enough that the real world intruded to make it impossible to game\
  \ together. That's the problem with superdungeons—it's all too easy for them to\
  \ get boring, or for them to become so ambitious that it's nearly impossible to\
  \ play all the way through and experience all of the story the dungeon has to offer.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One of my favorite things about the Emerald Spire project is that the\
  \ Flip-Mats are like a challenge to play every level. They also contained the authors\
  \ somewhat, forcing us through the brutality of limited space and a tight word count\
  \ to focus on the important stuff and not design anything too sprawling. The Emerald\
  \ Spire, unlike many superdungeons, is designed to be completable. Alternatively,\
  \ it works as a collection of 16 dungeons that can be used more or less independently,\
  \ making this a very easy adventure to cannibalize.</p> \n     <p><b>What is your\
  \ level of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon called? What theme, if any, does the level\
  \ have?</b></p> \n     <p>My Emerald Spire dungeon is called the Throne of Azlant.\
  \ It's the seat of the dungeon's Big Bad, the lich Nhur-Athemon. A lot of the foreshadowing\
  \ in the dungeon, particularly on the handful of levels directly above mine, points\
  \ to this ultimate nemesis, so my level pays off elements that the adventure has\
  \ been building toward all along. Nhur-Athemon was \"destroyed\" by the Knights\
  \ of the Ioun Star in the dying days of the Azlanti Empire, his unmortal corpse\
  \ bound forever to his subterranean lair by mythic magic curses. Naturally, the\
  \ player characters investigate and discover what an undead wizard tyrant gets up\
  \ to when he has 10,000 years confined to quarters. Old Nhur-Athemon was exiled\
  \ from Azlant after a failed attempt to claim the imperial throne, so you can be\
  \ sure that whatever the lich's plan, it certainly doesn't lack for ambition.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My busy work schedule doesn't allow me to write as much as I'd like\
  \ to, so over the last couple years I've tried to make my few small projects count\
  \ by tying a lot of minor elements of subplot together throughout various sources.\
  \ The Knights of the Ioun Star, Nhur-Athemon's ancient Azlanti enemies, also appeared\
  \ in a short section I wrote for <a href=\"/products/btpy95zo\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: Occult Mysteries</i></a>. My Emerald Spire dungeon also connects (thematically\
  \ and literally) to the dungeon level I wrote for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tb0\"\
  ><i>Thornkeep</i></a> dungeon, the Sanctum of a Lost Age. That adventure dealt with\
  \ Nhur-Athemon's apprentices, who have influence upon the Throne of Azlant as well.\
  \ All of this material ties into my home campaign, Kings of Absalom, which involves\
  \ a lot of ancient Azlanti secrets. I'll be running that campaign next weekend at\
  \ PaizoCon, and I hope one day to write it up for publication. This adventure is\
  \ a taste, and a peek at the grand picture.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n\

  \ by Abrar Ajmal\n     </div> \n     <p><b>What where the inspirations you drew\
  \ on for your Emerald Spire level, and what are you hoping players get out of it?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>My inspiration for this adventure comes more from my in-game play experience\
  \ than from something I'm trying to emulate from fiction or the movies or whatever.\
  \ I've run (and written) a lot of dungeon crawls in my time, and this one plays\
  \ off of a few lessons I've learned along the way. There's one of my patented \"\
  oh, this fight is more difficult than I anticipated\" encounters right near the\
  \ beginning of the adventure, but beyond that I've done my best to avoid some of\
  \ the pitfalls a big dungeon brings on both sides of the screen.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Throne of Azlant is non-linear—there are multiple routes to the final chamber\
  \ that leads deeper into the Emerald Spire dungeons (for the Spire's \"Big Bad\"\
  \ is not the \"Biggest Bad\" on offer).</p> \n     <p>The dungeon level is more\
  \ than just hack-and-slash. I included a few roleplaying encounters amongst all\
  \ the carnage, a sure-fire way to get across more of the dungeon's backstory and\
  \ to engage the interest of players who enjoy more than just rolling dice.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The adventure contains interesting elements of world lore and continuity.\
  \ Though I don't explore the full history of Old Azlant or a major mystery like\
  \ the origin of the god Aroden (you'll have to find a way to play Kings of Absalom\
  \ for that!), it does reveal interesting new tidbits about the empire that fans\
  \ of the Pathfinder world will likely appreciate.</p> \n     <p>It also contains\
  \ the meanest trick I have ever played on a player character, a bind so nasty that\
  \ I continue to giggle just thinking about it. I don't want to give away the secret\
  \ on the blog post, but folks who read the adventure should find it pretty easy\
  \ to understand what I'm talking about. Every time I've run the dungeon it's been\
  \ utterly delightful to see whether the players fall into this trap and create a\
  \ real conundrum for themselves. It's a glorious thing, if you are the type of GM\
  \ who appreciates seeing his players squirm when they realize they've made a bad\
  \ decision.</p> \n     <p>I'll be running one more shot at the Throne of Azlant\
  \ at PaizoCon next week, which will make it the 13th time I've run the adventure.\
  \ I started before last year's PaizoCon, and managed to run the Throne of Azlant\
  \ about a half-dozen times at various conventions and events before I had to turn\
  \ in my final manuscript. Unsurprisingly, repeated play produced lots of changes\
  \ to improve the adventure, and I honestly believe it got better with each play-through.\
  \ I've now run the Throne of Azlant more than any other Pathfinder adventure, which\
  \ has earned it a special place in my heart. Each running has resulted in different\
  \ conclusions and different routes through the dungeon, and it never seems to get\
  \ old.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Thanks to Erik for taking the time out of\
  \ his schedule to share some of his insights on this monumental project. Keep your\
  \ eyes on this blog next week for more exciting reveals.</p> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br>\
