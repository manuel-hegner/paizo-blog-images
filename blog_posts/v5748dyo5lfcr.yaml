  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">A\
  \ few months ago, when I started thinking about what figures to include in the specifically\
  \ Pathfinder Campaign Setting-themed <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>\
  \ set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy\
  \ miniatures, I came upon a revelation. We seem to really like monkeys, gorillas,\
  \ and apes. And since we decided to include several of these creatures in the set,\
  \ I thought it would make for a good theme for a Friday preview blog. Ladies and\
  \ gentlemen, I give you a sensational simian sneak peak to last you through your\
  \ Saturday and Sunday!</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-GorillaKing.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-GorillaKing_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is the Gorilla King,\
  \ a villain who actually predates the creation of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting, as he originally starred in one of our old <a href=\"/gameMastery/compleatEncounters\"\
  >Compleat Encounter</a> metal miniature sets, <a href=\"/products/btpy7ux9\"><i>Throne\
  \ of the Gorilla King</i></a>. A major antagonist in the treacherous jungles of\
  \ the Mwangi Expanse, the Gorilla King leads a nation of sentient demon-worshiping\
  \ monkeys, and his machinations occasionally even spill over onto the civilized\
  \ world. <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a> sees a much larger\
  \ version of the King than his previous incarnation, and your players won't soon\
  \ forget the session when you plunk this badboy on the table. The Gorilla King is\
  \ a Large, rare figure. You can find the Gorilla King's stats on page 21 of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8i1u\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #40</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Charauka.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Charauka_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of the Gorilla King's maniacal monkey servitors,\
  \ here we have one in all its animalistic glory. This Charau-Ka warrior is a Small,\
  \ common figure, a troop type that will allow you to build up a fun ape-men encounter\
  \ with very little effort or expense. With a colorful baboon-like face and a nasty\
  \ scream, the Charau-Ka wants to make sure your jungle exploration is particularly\
  \ memorable. The Charau-Ka's statistics are found in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Monkeyswarm.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Monkeyswarm_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Want even more shock troops for your ape invasion? Might I\
  \ suggest the cacophonous Monkey Swarm, courtesy of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i></a> (page 212)? Designed to work four-at-a-time\
  \ in a 10-ft. space, this Medium common figure looks great from every angle. I know\
  \ a certain contingent of Pathfinder Battles fans have been asking for flatter swarms,\
  \ but in this case it seemed making most use of all three dimensions would work\
  \ best. We can't have flat monkeys running around, after all. </p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Derhii.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Derhii_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>How about a flying ape? The Derhii, invented by Wolfgang\
  \ Baur in his classic Pathfinder Module <a href=\"/products/btpy81qt\"><i>Crucible\
  \ of Chaos</i></a>, dwell in jungle canopies and in cliff dwellings, demanding tribute\
  \ from lesser apes and aligning themselves with more powerful flying creatures such\
  \ as dragons or dragonnes. They're also neutral, so they're not necessarily bad\
  \ guys. The Derhii is an uncommon, Large figure. His stats can be found on page\
  \ 75 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-MarshGiant.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-MarshGiant_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We can't let monkeys have all the fun this week (and\
  \ I've got a ton of figures to preview before next month's official <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> release date), so here are a couple of bonus, non-ape previews\
  \ to tide you over until next week! First up we have the really quite gross Marsh\
  \ Giant, an uncommon Large figure from the very first <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>. The best thing about this figure is the shiny\
  \ coat on its skin, making it look like it just lurched out of the swamp.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Mothman.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Mothman_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Inspired by real world cryptozoology and urban legend\
  \ but very much a part of Golarion is the Mothman, represented here by a Medium\
  \ rare figure that exudes creepiness from antennae to toe. The best part of this\
  \ figure is the tinted clear wings, but its emaciated form and cool attachment to\
  \ the base via an L-shaped post makes the figure quite dynamic, despite its somewhat\
  \ rigid pose. He's definitely a creature you do not want to see, whether roosting\
  \ in the trees outside Sandpoint or on a creaky bridge on the way home during your\
  \ rush hour commute.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week! Tune in next week for\
  \ more never-before seen <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>\
  \ figures!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
