  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It is summer, the sun is shining, and Pathfinder\
  \ Society games abound. I'm working hard with the Pathfinder Society team in pulling\
  \ edges together for the conclusion of Year of the Stolen Storm and the launch of\
  \ the Year of Factions' Favor. Lots of great news, but I'll leave that to a different\
  \ blog for more information. For today, I'll focus on all the great things going\
  \ on in our community!</p> \n    <h2>Newest 5 Star GMs</h2> \n    <p>A fortunate\
  \ side effect of the popularity of Pathfinder Society is a constant need for GMs.\
  \ As a result, I constantly have the pleasure of announcing more five star GMs.\
  \ A huge thank you to the following GMs who gave of their time and energies to run\
  \ 150 games for players, including 50 different scenarios and 10 special events.\
  \ Three cheers for these dedicated GMs!</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Kevin Hanley</li>\
  \ \n     <li>David Setty</li> \n     <li>David Adams</li> \n     <li>Greg Ragland</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Phil McElfresh</li> \n     <li>Steven Gabel</li> \n     <li>Tineke\
  \ Bolleman</li> \n     <li>Andrew D. Geels</li> \n     <li>Heather Vigil</li> \n\
  \     <li>Benn Roe</li> \n     <li>Stacey Buxton</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h2>Volunteer\
  \ Recognitions</h2> \n    <p>Last year, the Pathfinder Society team created a new\
  \ award as a thank you to some of our longest serving volunteers. While the Paizo\
  \ Volunteer of the Year recipient often volunteers with the Society, it is not a\
  \ prerequisite for award. So we wanted something that could be given to those individuals\
  \ who already received a Campaign Service Award. We called the award the Order of\
  \ the Wayfinder and the inaugural recipient was <b>Bob Jonquet</b>. This year, we\
  \ weren't sure the recipient would be attending Gen Con, so we awarded it at PaizoCon.\
  \ It is my distinct pleasure to recognize <b>Al Rigg</b>, founding Venture-Captain\
  \ Sydney and current Venture-Captain, California—San Francisco Bay Area North &amp;\
  \ East as the second recipient.</p> \n    <p>At PaizoCon, we recognized Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ <b>David Jacobson</b> as the Paizo Volunteer of the Year for his long time support\
  \ of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game and associated Adventure Card Guild, as\
  \ well as the time and effort spent in the venture-officer corps.</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ I've had the pleasure of awarding several Campaign Service Coins in my travels\
  \ over the past few months. The following individuals received their coins between\
  \ Gen Con 2016 and now. We raise a huge cheer and thank you for your time and energies!\
  \ Your efforts on behalf of the Pathfinder Society greatly enrich our games.</p>\
