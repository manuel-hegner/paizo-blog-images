  artist: "the early 1960s, the paperback book phenomenon was hitting with full force,\
    \ exposing readers to a new generation of writers while bringing many of the old\
    \ pulp classics of the past into book form for the very first time. The celebrated\
    \ Ace Doubles of the era presented many of the books we've already published in\
    \ our Planet Stories classic fantasy line, including Leigh Brackett's The Secret\
    \ of Sinharat and People of the Talisman, both of which first appeared in the\
    \ original Planet Stories magazine of the 1940s. Ace also republished many full\
    \ book-length tales, including this month's Planet Stories release, Otis Adelbert\
    \ Kline's The Swordsman of Mars. Kline's classic tale of swashbuckling and savage\
    \ monsters in the deserts, swamps, and jungles of Mars first appeared in 1933\
    \ as a 6-chapter weekly serial in Argosy Magazine, the very pulp that had birthed\
    \ the so-called \"sword and planet\" genre with the publication of Edgar Rice\
    \ Burroughs's Under the Moons of Mars 21 years prior. Contemporary fans of Burrough's\
    \ John Carter of Mars and Carson of Venus tales often ranked Kline's planetary\
    \ adventures as equal or near-to-equal those penned by the master himself, but\
    \ in the 75 years since the original publication of The Swordsman of Mars, Kline's\
    \ reputation as an author has not fared quite as well as that of Edgar Rice Burroughs.\
    \ The tale's paperback publication came in 1960"

  artist: "gripping the thick iron bars, he peered out. It was broad daylight and\
    \ the sun was high in the heavens. Below him stretched a deep valley, through\
    \ which a narrow stream meandered. And as far as he could see in all directions\
    \ there were mountains, though the highest peaks were all below the level of his\
    \ own eyes. He turned"

  artist: "the beaming proprietor of the institution, a middle-aged gentleman with\
    \ bulging chest and biceps, a broken nose, and cauliflower ears. \"Come right\
    \ in, Mr. Thorne. Take a chair. A wonderful frame you have to put muscle on. Now\
    \ with our system of training we guarantee to add an inch to the circumference\
    \ of your biceps in less than-⎯\" \"One moment, Mr. McGinnis. I came here to be\
    \ built up, not physically, but financially. In short, I am after that job you\
    \ advertised in this morning's paper.\" McGinnis settled back, a look of disappointment\
    \ on his face. \"Oh, so you want a job as my assistant fencing master. Can you\
    \ handle a foil?\" \"Fencing has been a hobby of mine.\" \"A hobby, eh? You'll\
    \ have to make it a profession if you work here. But come. I'll try you out.\"\
    \ McGinnis led him down the hallway, and through a large room where a group of\
    \ perspiring financiers dressed in shorts and jerseys were going through various\
    \ contortions under the direction of a husky looking young man wearing a striped\
    \ sweater. A conspicuous majority of these striving athletes looked as if their\
    \ chests had slipped down beneath their belts, and the calves and biceps were\
    \ undeveloped. They passed through another room, where a number of corpulent gentlemen\
    \ were being mauled, poked, pinched, prodded and steam-cooked, and thence into\
    \ a small empty gymnasium. McGinnis removed his coat and invited Thorne to do\
    \ likewise. Then he handled him plastron, mask, glove and foil, and both men armed\
    \ themselves. \"Now, my lad,\" said McGinnis, when Thorne was ready, \"we'll see\
    \ what we'll see. On guard!\" They saluted and engaged. Before he had got fairly\
    \ warmed up, McGinnis, much to his surprise, was hit. \"Accidents will happen,\"\
    \ he said. \"We'll try again.\" They did, and this time McGinnis was disarmed.\
    \ The sudden realization of this made him quite red in the face—he, a fencing\
    \ master, disarmed by this amateur. \"That was a coincidence,\" he said, as Thorne\
    \ politely handed him his foil. \"We'll try it once more.\" Much to his astonishment\
    \ and chagrin, the master was hit in the fifth disengage. He threw down his foil\
    \ and tore off his mask. \"Enough's enough.\" He growled. \"Do I get the job?\"\
    \ asked Thorne. \"Not in a thousand years, my boy. Do you think I'd be fool enough\
    \ to hire an assistant who can beat me? Don't slam the door as you go out.\" Out\
    \ on the street once more, Thorne fished his last fifty cent piece"
