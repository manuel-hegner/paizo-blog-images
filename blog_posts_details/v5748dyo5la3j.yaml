  artist: "Wayne Reynolds in the alternate cover to Pathfinder #1), but we didn't\
    \ want to stop there. Dragons are the name of the game, and we needed to make\
    \ sure that ours were distinct enough so that they looked different, but at the\

    \ gods, society, clans and bloodlines, physiology and psychology, language, variants,\
    \ and more"
