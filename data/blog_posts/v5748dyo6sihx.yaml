  \ The Flavor</b><br>\n        What makes a good meal good? This is the direction\
  \ from which you should approach any TTRPG writing. After all, it’s not far from\
  \ the truth! You’re serving up a meal for people, and you have two goals to make\
  \ sure it pleases your clientele.</p>\n      <p>First off, you have to make sure\
  \ the meal doesn’t poison them and kill them. Dead clients will not buy your food\
  \ again, nor will they try your homebrew, third-party publisher (3pp) work, or original\
  \ writing! In our cooking metaphor, this is the role of mechanics; it’s what provides\
  \ your meal/TTRPG writing with a healthy structure and makes it “good for you.”\
  \ It is, fundamentally, the most important part of what you’re making. Without good\
  \ balance, your feat, item, spell, or whatever it is that you’re making will fall\
  \ apart. People will look at what it grants, say “this seems busted,” and make a\
  \ snap judgment on whether the rest of the project is worth checking out. But is\
  \ a passable structure enough?</p>\n      <p>Absolutely not. Adding something extra\
  \ transforms a merely digestible offering into one that’s delicious. And that something\
  \ extra in both the world of food and writing is flavor.</p>\n      <p>Flavor text\
  \ is a crucial ingredient that often goes uncelebrated, but it makes the difference\
  \ between incredible and bland. But to make the flavor pop, you need to know—what\
  \ do people like? In this context, I’m going to speak from my personal experience.\
  \ I write books for the Classes+ series, a line of 3pp books that focuses on expanding\
  \ existing classes, like <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/397932/Witches?src=also_purchased&amp;filters=100112\"\
  >witches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/415864/Clerics?src=by_author_of_product&amp;filters=100112\"\
  >clerics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/444888/Magus?src=by_author_of_product&amp;filters=100112\"\
  >magi</a>, etc. I’ll talk about things I’ve found that have helped me write flavor\
  \ text that keeps people coming back, and how to give them a go yourself.</p>\n\
  \      <p>First off, you want your flavor to be consistent. This goes for any piece\
  \ of text, of course, but it’s one that’s often overlooked in fantasy TTRPGs. You\
  \ want your content to fit into the world within which it’ll exist or most likely\
  \ be used. For Pathfinder, a lot of people are either going to be playing in Golarion\
  \ or in a homebrew world most likely based in fantasy tropes. That’s just the kind\
  \ of setting that Pathfinder most easily lends itself to; the sword and sorcery\
  \ aspects are the biggest selling point. So, when writing a new option, you want\
  \ it to be something that can seamlessly fit into this world without breaking its\
  \ established rules. For example, when writing <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/450292/Archetypes?src=hottest_filtered&amp;filters=100112\"\
  >Archetypes+</a>, we wanted to create something that would expand existing options\
  \ and add new ones too. One of the new archetypes we decided to make was a clown.\
  \ This was difficult, because most people have one of two very specific ideas when\
  \ it comes to clowns: a red-nosed guy in a funny wig, or a murderous slasher with\
  \ smeared white makeup. While there are places where these could feasibly fit in\
  \ Golarion, they don’t fit everywhere. Indeed, a standard party with a fighter,\
  \ wizard, cleric, and then a classic clown might not look right. It’s noticeably\
  \ “other,” and it had the potential to make people turn up their noses at the product\
  \ and not include it in their game. So how did we lessen the otherness of it?</p>\n\
  \      <p>That’s where our next point comes into play. Research! This may come as\
  \ a surprise, but you are not an infinite sponge of all knowledge ever. You need\
  \ to look up what you’re writing on, give yourself a brief lesson on the topic,\
  \ and then return to it. So, continuing with clowns: how did we make clowns fit?\
  \ Pathfinder’s setting ranges from prehistoric times (with the Mammoth Kings) to\
  \ 1800s-analogous Absalom. As it turns out, clowns have a long history between prehistoric\
  \ times and the late 1800s! The first clowns were priest-clowns in Ancient Egypt,\
  \ over 4,000 years ago. Then, throughout the medieval era, there were jesters, who\
  \ acted as advisors to nobility. In the 16th century, <em>commedia dell'arte</em>\
  \ was popularized in Italy. These theatrical sketch shows involved masked character\
  \ archetypes like the daring Harlequin and the glum Pierrot. Finally, in the early\
  \ 1800s, Joseph Grimaldi introduced face paint, colorful costumes, and all the tropes\
  \ we associate with the common clown. Once we knew that clowns did exist during\
  \ the timeframe that Pathfinder likes to play with, we could make something fitting\
  \ for it! But now, the next question is… how did we make it unique?</p>\n      <p>One’\
  s work needs to stand out on its own. Yes, the mechanics might be unique, but the\
  \ dressing over the mechanics needs to be something unlike anything else the game\
  \ has to offer presently… while, crucially, feeling exactly like something else\
  \ the game has to offer. It’s extraordinarily easy to go overboard here and quickly\
  \ go from “Here’s a fun idea” to “What if the clown can use three actions to become\
  \ a clown elemental?” Mechanically, maybe that’s fine, but it’s a strange idea that\
  \ breaks the existing lore of the world. The implication of an elemental plane of\
  \ clown, while itself horrifying, also completely ignores the Golarion setting’\
  s rules and, most likely, the rules of any other setting missing an elemental clown\
  \ plane.</p>\n      <p>But then, what if you don’t go far enough? Perhaps clowns\
  \ can pull tricks to inspire their allies in combat! But… that’s just the bard,\
  \ another entertainment-focused character option. If you don’t go far enough, your\
  \ writing will feel unsure of itself. You really need to solidly hit that middle\
  \ ground. What’s something that’s <em>like</em> existing content, but not so similar\
  \ as to lack identity, and not so different as to become nonsensical in most settings?</p>\n\
  \      <p>Clowns are meant to be ridiculous, so some of our ideas were naturally\
  \ going to be a little more comedically toned, but we wanted them to fit most worlds.\
  \ The feat Rubber Body is a good example of our process—it’s a feat that plays with\
  \ the raw physicality of clownish performances, which often include over-the-top\
  \ slapstick. The feat gives the clown resistance to damage as a reaction while also\
  \ knocking them back 15 feet and rendering them prone. Another feat, Uncanny Legerdemain,\
  \ allows clowns to seemingly magically transport items from one closed hand to another,\
  \ or one sleeve to another. This feat not only allows a character to pull off classic\
  \ magic tricks, it also offers good roleplay opportunities like smuggling, stealing,\
  \ and otherwise storing items in an extradimensional space in a comical fashion.\
  \ All of these fit the clown without being too out there, and without feeling exactly\
  \ like anything presently in the game.</p>\n      <p>So, that’s what it comes down\
  \ to. It seems like a daunting task—have the idea, make sure it fits into the world\
  \ you’re writing for, research it, and then make sure it isn’t too much or too little.\
  \ It’s not easy to pull off, but you need to be sure to put in the appropriate work\
  \ here. It doesn’t matter if you have the greatest mechanics in the world—dry oats\
  \ may be healthy, but they don’t taste great. Thankfully, once you get used to writing\
  \ flavor, it starts getting easier. It’s like standing in front of an oven and smelling\
  \ the aroma of the food waft up to you; you’ll feel like there’s no stopping you,\
  \ and pretty soon, you’ll have made something people won’t forget!</p>\n      <p>Derry\
