  \ August 24, 2007</p> \n   <p>We're all back from Gen Con, and aside from the launch\
  \ of <i><a href=\"/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a></i> and our new <a href=\"/store/fiction/planetStories\"\
  >Planet Stories</a> novel line, the hot news at the show was the announcement of\
  \ Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition, from Wizards of the Coast. Messageboards across\
  \ the internet, from paizo.com to EN World and Wizards of the Coast's own site,\
  \ are abuzz with discussion of what was revealed at the show, what changes are in\
  \ store for our favorite game, and what the future may hold. </p> \n   <p>Naturally,\
  \ lots of folks want to know what the announcement means for <i>Pathfinder</i> and\
  \ for our line of monthly <a href=\"/gameMastery/modules\">GameMastery Modules</a>.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Right now, the answer is this: It's too soon to tell. </p> \n   <p>No\
  \ one at Paizo has seen a copy of the new rules yet, nor have we seen a draft of\
  \ the Open Game License for it (yes, there will be one). We have plenty of reasons\
  \ to believe that the new game will include lots of improvements over the current\
  \ system, and that the new OGL will, if anything, be even more permissive than the\
  \ one for 3.0 and 3.5. </p> \n   <p>Ever since the announcement of the end of <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines, we've been careful to say that Wizards of the Coast\
  \ and Paizo are still on good terms, that we're still communicating with one another,\
  \ and that we hope to work together in the future. This is not just so much blown\
  \ smoke. The guys at Wizards have been very forthcoming with information on the\
  \ new edition, and we look forward to learning even more in the weeks and months\
  \ to come. I am personally optimistic that this will, for the most part, be a welcome\
  \ change at my gaming table. </p> \n   <p>But it's way too early to say what Paizo\
  \ will be doing about 4th edition. Please give us some time to take a look at the\
  \ new rules, to take a look at the new OGL, and make an informed decision. We promise\
  \ we'll let you know what we're planning just as soon as we figure it out ourselves.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>For the time being, both the <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> and <i>Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</i> Adventure Paths will be released as announced for the\
  \ 3.5 rules set, as will all GameMastery Modules at least up until May of 2008,\
  \ which is when Wizards will release the 4th edition <i>Player's Handbook</i>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>All of our announced products for the first quarter of 2008 are \"rules-light\"\
  \ and should not be adversely affected by the change in edition whether we convert\
  \ or not. We will be making no significant changes to the announced product schedule.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>I'm aware that many Paizo customers will not be converting to 4e.\
  \ Honestly, before I heard some of the things I heard at Gen Con, I wasn't sure\
  \ I wanted to convert either. So I sympathize. </p> \n   <p><i>Pathfinder</i> currently\
  \ plans to support officially sanctioned conversions for Castles &amp; Crusades\
  \ and True20, so assuming we <i>do</i> convert, I suspect it is very likely that\
  \ we (or some affiliated partner) will provide 3.5 conversion guidelines. </p> \n\
  \   <p>Or we might stick with 3.5. We haven't seen the rules yet, and can't make\
  \ the decision until we do. </p> \n   <p>One thing I can say for sure: As a gamer\
  \ I would be a lot happier with a game that doesn't require two hours of prep-time\
  \ for four hours of play. I have heard that the new system addresses this problem,\
  \ and that strikes me as excellent. </p> \n   <p>If Wizards of the Coast can streamline\
  \ the rules without robbing the game of its variety and complexity, I will be very\
  \ impressed. </p> \n   <p>So far, I am optimistic. </p> \n   <p>Erik Mona <br>Publisher\
