  \ with making the next big archaeological discovery. When a talking weasel reveals\
  \ that a sinister witch is close to uncovering a long-lost temple deep within the\

  \ to stop him from releasing an ancient evil. Now both fame and redemption may be\
  \ at hand... if they can survive.</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter\
  \ 1: The Rescue</h2> \n     <p>Daryus Gaunt eyed the two armored figures over the\
  \ froth-covered rim of his mug, taking in every detail of the pair. Despite his\
  \ outward disinterest, he remained on edge until the two crusaders took their leave\
  \ of the tavern.</p> \n     <p>They had not recognized him—but then, he hardly looked\
  \ like the earnest warrior he had been when he had worn their same uniform. Scars\
  \ etched his oddly narrow features, many covered unsuccessfully by the thin, black\
  \ beard edged with gray. Some of the jagged marks had been earned when he had been\
  \ a crusader, but the rest—along with the beard—he'd gotten acting as a sword for\
  \ hire for whoever was willing to pay.</p> \n     <p>Daryus could have saved himself\
  \ so much trouble by simply not making Nerosyan his base. Doing so was like poking\
  \ the proverbial bees' nest. The Order of the Flaming Lance had a significant presence\
  \ here. If even one of the crusaders recognized him, he risked losing his head.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>After all, the order had very little sympathy for traitors.</p> \n \
  \    <p>He set down the empty mug, then rose. Next to him, the two surly thugs muttering\
  \ to one another about some future robbery immediately eased out of his way. Contrary\
  \ to his name and his grandfather's supposed elven lineage, Daryus Gaunt was a mountain\
  \ of a man, just a few inches shy of seven feet. It made his hiding in a stronghold\
  \ of the order an even more questionable choice to that handful aware of his situation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Five ales had done nothing to temper Daryus's mood, but he always stopped\
  \ after five no matter what a part of him desired. The five drinks represented part\
  \ of his failing, part of his betrayal. Daryus might have so far escaped punishment,\
  \ but he couldn't escape his own guilt.</p> \n     <p>The Crimson Hammer Tavern\
  \ might not have been one of the best-known establishments in Tumbletown—much less\
  \ the city of Nerosyan itself—but it was a place where those in desperate need of\
  \ a practiced sword could find such. \"Desperate\" was the key. Prospective employers\
  \ had to be willing to wend their way deep northwest into one of the worst parts\
  \ of the city.</p> \n     <p>Tonight, Daryus noted two potential contracts. One\
  \ was a squat, robed figure who tried to keep his face covered with a scarf. The\
  \ former crusader guessed him to be a merchant attempting to smuggle something either\
  \ into Nerosyan or out of it. At present, the rotund man conversed with a pale,\
  \ eye-patched swordsman who Daryus knew would do his best to part the fool from\
  \ his money without fulfilling the contract.</p> \n     <p>The other possible client\
  \ was a thin young man with long blond hair and furtive eyes who gave Daryus a measured\
  \ glance before heading toward a grizzled ex-pirate from the River Kingdoms by the\
  \ name of Divalo. Daryus gave the young man some credit. He had picked one of the\
  \ more trustworthy swords in the tavern. Despite his background, Divalo would live\
  \ up to his contract and even make certain that any other swords the young man needed\
  \ would do the same on pain of death.</p> \n     <p>Seeing no reason to remain,\
  \ Daryus made for the door. It had been a fortnight since he had returned to the\
  \ Diamond of the North, as Nerosyan was also known. The name had little to do with\
  \ any glamorous aspect of the city and more with the base design of the massive\
  \ fortress initially built here. There was no better fortified city than Nerosyan—\
  a good thing, since it was close enough to the Worldwound to attract the attention\
  \ of demons.</p> \n     <p>Thinking of the Worldwound, Daryus hesitated just shy\
  \ of the door. It was not out of any thought of adding a sixth ale to his count,\
  \ but rather the hope that the rumors he had heard might still prove true. The word\
  \ was out that some Pathfinders were planning an expedition into the demon-blighted\
  \ land. What insane reason they had for doing so, the former crusader did not care.\
  \ All he knew was that Pathfinders paid well. They would need a strong arm out in\
  \ the Worldwound if they hoped to even survive their first night.</p> \n     <p>Gripping\
  \ the swinging door carefully, Daryus slowly opened the way. A slight creak accompanied\
  \ the door's movement. The tavern's owner liked to keep all the doors creaky, the\
  \ better to know when someone exited or entered. Daryus appreciated that aspect,\
  \ save now when he wanted to make certain that no one outside might hear him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But the two crusaders were nowhere to be seen, even to his skilled eye.\
  \ If they had recognized him and arranged a trap, they had done a fine job. Daryus\
  \ doubted it, though.</p> \n     <p>Some might have wondered at his choices, a renegade\
  \ at the heart of the crusader city. Even the explanation he gave himself—that they\
  \ would never expect to find him so close by—was one that Daryus knew he wouldn't\
  \ have accepted from anyone else.</p> \n     <p>Shrugging off both the obvious contradictions\
  \ in his decisions and the reasons behind them, Daryus headed deeper into Tumbletown.\
  \ For all their power, the crusaders did little to clean out the area. It wasn't\
  \ due solely to the tremendous effort needed, though. The area around the Crimson\
  \ Tavern and its like allowed the crusaders to have a particular place to find those\
  \ tools they would not admit they needed at times. Daryus had seen the supposed\
  \ clients who he knew were actually servants of the various crusader orders. Even\
  \ the most pious of the orders' higher-ups occasionally needed those they considered\
  \ scum.</p> \n     <p>Only a few dim oil lamps and torches lit the way through the\
  \ grimy streets and the filthy buildings lining each side. There had been attempts\
  \ in the past to better illuminate the area in a pretense of making everyone safer,\
  \ but those had lasted only long enough for someone to steal the lamps. The lesson\
  \ remained. Only those who could defend themselves could walk these streets at night.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A light some distance to the southwest and high above momentarily caught\
  \ his attention. While not as large as the city's four main defense towers, Starrise\
  \ Spire—or, more specifically, the magical beacon floating above it—was a useful\
  \ landmark when trying to wend through the darkened streets toward where he lived.\
  \ The only other landmark of any use to Daryus besides the city's towers was the\
  \ great Cruciform Cathedral, situated dead center in the city. More a fortress than\
  \ an ordinary cathedral, that massive redoubt housed Queen Galfrey and the rest\
  \ of Mendev's leadership, those soldiers and bureaucrats charged with organizing\
  \ all the disparate crusader orders into a solid defense against the Worldwound's\
  \ demons.</p> \n     <p>As he moved on, Daryus set one gloved hand on the hilt of\
  \ the longsword dangling at his side. All it would take was one swift motion to\
  \ ready the blade for battle. He had been forced to draw it three times since arriving\
  \ in Nerosyan, but not of late. Most of the regulars knew Daryus Gaunt by reputation\
  \ now and avoided trouble with him.</p> \n     <p><i>Help...</i></p> \n     <p>He\
  \ came to an abrupt halt. Cocking his head, he listened.</p> \n     <p>Silence reigned.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>With a grunt, Daryus moved on. Five ales might not be enough to affect\
  \ his faculties, but exhaustion could. He hadn't slept in three days. As a young\
  \ warrior, three days awake would have meant little to him, but of late it seemed\
  \ to Daryus that his strength flagged quicker and quicker. Still, there were few\
  \ he knew of in Tumbletown with more skill than him, so he wasn't overly worried.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Help!</i></p> \n     <p>Again, Daryus hesitated. He listened, only\
  \ hearing a slight wind struggling through the tightly packed buildings and narrow\
  \ streets.</p> \n     <p><i>Help!</i></p> \n     <p>He frowned. It was almost as\
  \ if he heard the voice in his <i>head</i>.</p> \n     <p>\"Help me! Please!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>That </i>cry he heard out loud. Moving with a speed and grace his\
  \ form belied, Daryus drew his sword. He took one step toward where he believed\
  \ the faint cry had come.</p> \n     <p>The clink of metal against metal made every\
  \ muscle in his body tense. Daryus considered the possibility of a clever crusader\
  \ trap, but quickly disposed of the notion. The cry seemed too true, too honest.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Help!\"</p> \n     <p>Daryus got a fix on the direction. With swift\
  \ but stealthy steps, he headed toward the pleading voice. Whether it was male or\
  \ female, he couldn't say, but it didn't matter. Every instinct in Daryus pushed\
  \ him to helping the unseen caller. A renegade he might be, but he couldn't fight\
  \ his basic nature.</p> \n     <p>As he entered a side alley, something just ahead\
  \ of him moved in the shadows. With his left hand, Daryus brought the sword around,\
  \ but found only empty air.</p> \n     <p>A second clink warned him just before\
  \ the point of a narrow sword would have pierced him through the throat. Instead,\
  \ Daryus managed to bring up his own weapon in time to deflect the attack. The oncoming\
  \ tip scraped his cheek, adding to collection of scars.</p> \n     <p>Daryus's fist\
  \ followed his sword, striking his adversary hard in the chest. The shadowy figure\
  \ grunted as the force of the blow sent him back a step.</p> \n     <p>Despite eyes\
  \ already attuned to the darkness, Daryus had trouble making out the other swordsman's\
  \ features. No matter how hard he tried, the face remained indiscernible.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The sword did not. Out of the corner of his eye, Daryus spotted the weapon\
  \ coming at him again. As he shifted his own blade to meet it, he noted another\
  \ attack coming from the opposite side.</p> \n     <p>There was no time to reach\
  \ the small dagger he wore in his belt. Daryus thrust his other arm up, willing\
  \ to take a shallow slice on his cloth-covered arm rather than have his head skewered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Deflecting the first sword, Daryus spun to meet the wielder of the second.\
  \ He had the satisfaction of feeling his blade cut into the other attacker's arm.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Despite the wound, the second figure made no sound. Daryus knew he faced\
  \ not only seasoned fighters, but determined ones.</p> \n     <p>The cry for aid\
  \ had ceased, making the mercenary wonder if he had arrived too late. However, he\
  \ knew the point no longer mattered; he was now committed to the struggle, whatever\
  \ and whomever it concerned.</p> \n     <p>The first attacker tried to take him\
  \ again. Daryus's left-handed counterassault kept the shadowy fighter off guard,\
  \ while at the same time, he kicked at the legs of the second figure. He drove his\
  \ latter attacker down on one knee, buying time to better deal with the first.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Beware above!\" the same voice that had cried for help called.</p>\

  \ <br><i>Illustration by Vincent Proce</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Rather than thrust\
  \ at his foe, Daryus had to instead leap back. Even then, he barely missed being\
  \ crushed under the weight of yet a third figure.</p> \n     <p>Sword already in\
  \ play, Daryus lunged at the newcomer. He caught the crouching fighter on the side,\
  \ but the other managed to roll away before the sword could do more than scrape\
  \ what Daryus guessed to be a light breastplate.</p> \n     <p>Daryus sensed the\
  \ movements of the second assailant. Determined to do something to keep the odds\
  \ from turning further against him, he threw himself against the kneeling figure.\
  \ As they collided, Daryus twisted his sword around and shoved as hard as he could.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Although the blade sank deep into the other's throat, his foe's only\
  \ response before dying was a grunt. Daryus began to wonder whether they could even\
  \ speak at all.</p> \n     <p>He hardly had the sword free from the collapsing body\
  \ before the third of his attackers returned. Despite a hint of illumination from\
  \ the street beyond, the face continued to be as featureless as those of the original\
  \ pair. Daryus knew magic when he saw it, and hoped that the obscuring shadows were\
  \ the extent of their abilities. The trio did not strike him as spellcasters, but\
  \ rather paid assassins given a trick or two. Still, even one more trick might prove\
  \ too much for Daryus.</p> \n     <p>Both attackers converged on Daryus. He fended\
  \ off their initial attacks, at the same time managing to analyze which of the pair\
  \ was the more dangerous. As for his foes, they seemed satisfied to harass him,\
  \ almost as if waiting for something <i>else</i> to happen...</p> \n     <p>A clatter\
  \ arose from his right. Daryus, already suspecting just what the pair had been waiting\
  \ for, was startled that the <i>fourth</i> figure seeking his death could be so\
  \ clumsy. The murky form stumbled into Daryus's waiting hand.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ all the force he could muster, Daryus threw his latest adversary toward the others.\
  \ One fighter managed to evade the living missile, but the second wasn't so lucky.\
  \ The two fell in a heap.</p> \n     <p>\"Beware! One more! One more!\" came the\
  \ voice, this time from what seemed somewhere on the ground to the right.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Daryus couldn't see anyone there, but he responded to the warning. Drawing\
  \ his dagger, he brandished the smaller blade at the most likely direction from\
  \ which any additional enemy would attack.</p> \n     <p>It was all he could do\
  \ to keep his grip as the sword point thrusting out of the darkness clashed against\
  \ his dagger. Daryus spun around, forcing the barely visible sword's wielder back\
  \ while still keeping the foremost of his other adversaries at bay.</p> \n     <p>Lunging\
  \ toward his latest foe, he slipped past the sword enough to reach the hand gripping\
  \ it. He drove the dagger as hard as he could into the wrist.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ time, Daryus was rewarded by a pained cry. The sword slipped free. Daryus grabbed\
  \ the wounded limb, then pulled his opponent toward him.</p> \n     <p>So near,\
  \ he finally caught a glimpse of a face, a peculiarly nondescript face that even\
  \ Daryus's expert eye could not identify by region. A faint beard covered most of\
  \ the lower half, but that was perhaps the only detail of any note.</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ rough hand shoved Daryus back. The face disappeared into the same sort of odd,\
  \ darker-than-dark inkiness obscuring the faces of the rest.</p> \n     <p>Daryus\
  \ used the force of the push to enable him to roll to the side. As he turned on\
  \ his back, he brought up his sword.</p> \n     <p>The point caught the attacker\
  \ coming up behind him under his armored chest. Before the wounded fighter could\
  \ stagger back, Daryus shoved the sword deeper.</p> \n     <p>As he did that, a\
  \ strange change came over his dying enemy. Not only did the inkiness fade, but\
  \ the attacker's entire body shimmered. A bland face identical to the other fighter's\
  \ briefly materialized, then itself faded into something else.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ suddenly a <i>pitborn</i> stood before Daryus.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \      <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>As a\
  \ crusader, Daryus had come face to face with the demon-tainted creatures before.\
  \ Generally human in face and form, they bore the curse of some past coupling between\
  \ a human and one of the foul denizens of the Abyss. Daryus's former order had seen\
  \ pitborn as little more than demons themselves, though while many were indeed evil,\
  \ he knew that others could be as pure of heart as the oath-sworn warriors with\
  \ whom he had served.</p> \n     <p>The last, it appeared, did not apply to the\
  \ fanged, thick-browed figure collapsing by Daryus. His dying gaze held only rage,\
  \ a look that faded a moment later as death took him.</p> \n     <p>Daryus scrambled\
  \ back as both the attacker he had knocked over and wounded and the remaining pair\
  \ regained their footing. He had been fortunate up until now, but even with two\
  \ dead and possibly two wounded, the odds were still against him, especially if\
  \ <i>all </i>of the three were pitborn. The demon-touched often wielded some level\
  \ of sorcerous power, which explained their ability to mask themselves in the midst\
  \ of a crusader stronghold.</p> \n     <p>Instead of attacking, though, to Daryus's\
  \ surprise, the two in front of him retreated. Weapons ready, they vanished into\
  \ the shadows behind them.</p> \n     <p>Daryus turned to the last, only to find\
  \ the disguised attacker sprawled in a heap. Suspecting a trap, Daryus approached\
  \ cautiously. As vicious as the dagger wound had been to the assassin's wrist, it\
  \ should not have killed him so quickly, if at all.</p> \n     <p>In death, the\
  \ pitborn's true countenance lay revealed. Small, sharp horns curled up from his\
  \ forehead. His gaping mouth revealed sharp teeth. However, it was the pitborn's\
  \ throat that demanded Daryus's attention.</p> \n     <p>Something had ripped it\
  \ out with animalistic tenacity, something evidently capable of moving swiftly and\
  \ silently.</p> \n     <p>Not one to question his fortune, Daryus looked around\
  \ for the caller. He was not surprised to find himself alone. Whoever had been the\
  \ intended target of these assassins had wisely fled. Unfortunately, that left Daryus\
  \ alone to deal with the bodies. Bodies were not uncommon in Tumbletown, but three\
  \ dead pitborn would certainly stir the attention of the city's crusaders. There\
  \ would be a search of the area, with questions about who in the area would have\
  \ the skill to kill not one but three.</p> \n     <p>It would not be long before\
  \ someone led them to Daryus.</p> \n     <p>Daryus knew a spot where he could put\
  \ the bodies, a place where no one would find them for years, if ever, based on\
  \ the two skeletons he had discovered there the first time he had stumbled into\
  \ it. He wiped his sword and dagger off on the body with the ruined throat, then\
  \ sheathed the weapons and hefted the dead pitborn over his shoulder. He could have\
  \ carried two at once, but that would have made it harder to draw a weapon should\
  \ someone come upon him. Besides, a single body he could prop against a wall and\
  \ pretend in the dark was a drunken comrade.</p> \n     <p>The hiding place in question\
  \ was a narrow passage between two old, stone buildings farther to the west of his\
  \ dwelling. Sometime far in the past, the entrance to the passage had been bricked\
  \ up to make the two structures seem as one. The only way to still reach it was\
  \ from the roofs above, which was how Daryus had stumbled on it in the first place.\
  \ He had not expected to have to slide into it, nor had he expected the skeletons\
  \ with the telltale chips in their ribs indicating death by sword. Now, though,\
  \ what had been an unfortunate chance discovery was proving to be of use.</p> \n\
  \     <p>For most people, the time needed to dispose of one body, let alone three,\
  \ would have been measured in hours. Daryus managed to remove the first two in such\
  \ quick order that he surprised himself. Only then did he realize just how well\
  \ he had eased into his current life. His earlier existence suddenly seemed farther\
  \ away than ever.</p> \n     <p>Gritting his teeth, Daryus returned for the last.\
  \ Not once had he seen anyone on the street, but he doubted his luck would hold\
  \ much longer. With growing impatience, Daryus returned to the scene of the struggle...and\
  \ found no trace of the last corpse.</p> \n     <p>What he did find was a small\
  \ and curious-looking animal sitting near where he had last seen the body. The long,\
  \ sinewy mammal licked one of its forepaws, upon which Daryus noted small bits of\
  \ dark moisture.</p> \n     <p>The brown-furred creature raised its head to look\
  \ at him. Daryus had not seen many weasels in this region, but knew what they looked\
  \ like. This one was average in size and slightly wide in the mouth. There was nothing\
  \ out of the ordinary about it save that its left eye seemed injured and twisted\
  \ shut.</p> \n     <p>Without warning, it scampered over to Daryus and started up\
  \ his leg. Thrusting the dagger in his belt, the former crusader seized the vermin\
  \ by the scruff of the neck and brought it to eye level.</p> \n     <p>The weasel\
  \ wrinkled its nose, but otherwise didn't react. It seemed perfectly at ease dangling\
  \ several feet above the ground as it stared with the one eye at Daryus.</p> \n\
  \     <p>A quick survey of the area revealed no sign of either the intended victim\
  \ or the last body. Daryus knew he had risked himself far too long for what he now\
  \ felt was no good reason. Indeed, he began to wonder if perhaps he had been set\
  \ up by someone intending either robbery or vengeance. Perhaps <i>he</i> had been\
  \ the target all along.</p> \n     <p>Remaining wary, Daryus abandoned the area,\
  \ taking what precautions he could to keep from being followed. If in fact he had\
  \ been set up by a rival, or had simply become the object of some thieving gang's\
  \ attention, he didn't want company joining him at home.</p> \n     <p>Not certain\
  \ what else to do with the weasel, Daryus set it down and started off. He didn't\
  \ get far before realizing that the creature was following close.</p> \n     <p>Daryus\
  \ waved it off, but the weasel continued to follow. Its lack of concern for the\
  \ dead or missing assassins suggested it hadn't been a pet of theirs. Yet if it\
  \ had belonged to whoever had cried out—assuming there had actually been someone\
  \ in the first place—Daryus wondered why the animal's owner had left it behind.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Daryus's abode was little more than a shack attached to the back of\
  \ a warehouse. In the early days of the city, the shack had probably acted as the\
  \ warehouse guard's quarters. The warehouse had changed hands and functions over\
  \ the generations, becoming now the front for a merchant of disreputable means.\
  \ Daryus paid the man's scarecrow of a daughter a month's lodging at a time. He\
  \ knew that they also saw him as an unpaid guard for their goods, for if something\
  \ happened to the warehouse, then Daryus would lose his dwelling and the money he\
  \ had paid out that month.</p> \n     <p>Other than a creaking oak bed with a blanket\
  \ to act as mattress, the lone room had only two other pieces of furniture. The\
  \ well-stained table and accompanying bench were where Daryus spent his time when\
  \ not sleeping. A half-empty bottle of foul-tasting red wine that reminded Daryus\
  \ of the swill he had once drank in faraway Sauerton sat atop the table, looking\
  \ inviting despite his familiarity with its sharply acidic taste.</p> \n     <p>Just\
  \ as he shut the door behind him, the weasel slipped through into the room.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"No you don't!\" He made a swipe for the sinewy creature, but the weasel\
  \ twisted out of range. It darted to the bench, leapt atop it, then made its way\
  \ to the table and the waiting wine bottle.</p> \n     <p>Daryus pursued, only to\
  \ pull up short as the weasel suddenly turned its one-eyed gaze back at him. The\
  \ stare was so intense that the renegade crusader almost expected the animal to\
  \ talk.</p> \n     <p>Which it did.</p> \n     <p>\"You save Toy's life!\" it piped\
  \ in the voice Daryus immediately recognized as the one that had called for help.\
  \ \"You save Toy's life, but now we must beware! They will seek to obey their master's\
  \ will! They will come again with more! We must leave this city!\"</p> \n     <p>Daryus\
  \ reached for his sword. \"What are you?\"</p> \n     <p>Toy impatiently shook its\
  \ head, its single open eye never leaving Daryus. \"No time to waste on foolish\
  \ questions! Must act! Must act before he acts!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Who?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>The weasel hissed. It reared, revealing that it was definitely male. \"\
  An evil walking on two legs! An evil that will now come looking for both of us,\
  \ Master... unless Toy and Master stop him first!\"</p> \n     <p>And then, without\
  \ warning, the weasel opened his <i>other</i> eye as well—an eye simultaneously\
  \ of fire and ice, blood red and bone ivory.</p> \n     <p>A <i>demon's</i> eye.</p>\
