  \     <p>Greetings, dear reader of Golarion’s Finest guides and articles! I’ve just\
  \ returned from another adventure and as always, after visiting new locales throughout\
  \ Golarion I return to share my experiences with my favorite readers: you! (My,\
  \ aren’t you looking particularly fine today?) Before I get into the details, I\
  \ wish to remind you, dear reader, that this trip was sponsored by Golarion’s Finest.\
  \ They paid for my fare, room and board, and other amenities on this trip, and I’\
  m eternally grateful to the fine folks at this fine publication. Make sure to check\
  \ out their latest release, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dv8?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Travel-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Travel Guide</em></a>, available wherever you might find other fine\
  \ guides!</p> \n     <p>My latest travels brought me back home to the Inner Sea.\
  \ While my time in Segada was fun, I was excited to be coming back to something\
  \ familiar. Little did I know that my assignment wouldn’t see me back in Avistan\
  \ like I imagined, but would in fact take me to Garund! Specifically, I was sent\
  \ to visit the desert lands of Thuvia, home of the famous sun orchid elixir.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My trip started when I left the boat in Merab. I had traveled along\
  \ the South Tack before, but this was my first stop at this vivacious city. The\
  \ sights and sounds were invigorating! The calls of merchants selling their potions\
  \ and elixirs within the Flowing Market greeted me as I walked past to the Temple\
  \ of the Redeeming Sun to watch the Sarenites perform their dances for the Sunwrought\
  \ Festival. Lucky me, to have arrived during the solstice!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ 13px;\">Whether you try Tareq’s or visit a street vendor, these pastries are worth\
  \ a stop!<br> Art by Gislaine Avila</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>While the festivities\
  \ were thrilling, I found that I was famished from my journey, so I decided to slip\
  \ into a nearby restaurant. A kind halfling by the name of Tareq sat me down at\
  \ a table and after a bit of conversation, I decided on the spiced meat pastries.\
  \ While I had walked past many food vendors selling the same pastries earlier, he\
  \ insisted that he made them better than any street cart. How could I pass up the\
  \ best meat pastries in Merab? Reader, let me tell you, I don’t think Tareq was\
  \ lying. These were absolutely delicious. I highly recommend giving them a try while\
  \ in Thuvia!</p> \n     <p>I resumed my explorations of the city, wandering until\
  \ one particular building sporting a number of strange glass additions caught my\
  \ attention. Confounded, I asked around and was told to make my way to a higher\
  \ point in the city so I could look down on the building from above. My new vantage\
  \ point revealed the building’s true artistry—the glass additions resemble the petals\
  \ of a sun orchid! After further inquiries, I learned that this particular design\
  \ is in the Sunswept style, an architectural style that originated in Osirion but\
  \ had spread throughout the other nations of the Golden Road.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">I’m sure it’s a lot of work to make\
  \ those glass walls!<br> Art by Vlada Hladkova</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>As I took\
  \ some notes, I heard the familiar sound of a cheering crowd nearby. I followed\
  \ the jubilant cries expecting to find more festival celebrants, but my investigation\
  \ soon discovered that the cheering was coming from a local stadium. Rather than\
  \ buy a ticket inside, I followed some local youths up to the top of a nearby armory\
  \ (more climbing!) to look down into the Merab Stadium. A game of basilisk was underway!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Basilisk, for my less sports-inclined readers, is a sport where two\
  \ teams attempt to score with a ball across a small field. The catch is that there’\
  s a second ball in play—the titular basilisk—that forces any player it hits to freeze\
  \ in place. Luckily, just like when dealing with a real basilisk, you can avert\
  \ your gaze. In fact, that’s required in this game! Anyone holding the scoring ball\
  \ lowers a visor on their helm to “protect” them from the basilisk. This prevents\
  \ the basilisk’s “freeze” but has the unfortunate side effect of making it really\
  \ hard to see! The player holding the ball needs help reaching the goal, so all\
  \ the players have to work together to guide the scoring ball while also avoiding\
  \ becoming frozen. It’s an exhilarating watch!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">It’s a wonder they don’t trip with those helmets!<br>Art\
  \ by by Klaher Baklaher</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The game at hand was an important\
  \ one (hence the particularly raucous cheering). The Merab Vultures were playing\
  \ against the Riddleport Rollers, but this was no ordinary match—a newly developing\
  \ rivalry between the two teams heightened the stakes! The Vultures’ former guide,\
  \ a gnome by the name of Yima “No Eyes” Vitton, had recently been transferred to\
  \ Riddleport. Now the remaining Vultures, and Merab as a whole, had it out for the\
  \ “traitorous” Rollers. It was all in good spirits, but it was a fun game to watch!\
  \ Local authorities unfortunately shooed us from the armory before I could catch\
  \ the end of the game, so I found my way to a local tea parlor. There, I traded\
  \ stories with the locals and learned a fair amount of local legends. One of my\
  \ favorite stories was the tale of the camelop and the drake.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ the day winding down, I retreated to my room to rest in preparation for another\
  \ full day. And indeed, the rest of my trip was just as exciting and eventful! The\
  \ people, culture, and of course food of Merab are all fantastic and I highly recommend\
  \ every dear reader makes the journey if they can. I’d love to tell you more, but\
  \ Golarion’s Finest only paid for one thousand words and I’d like to see if I can\
  \ convince them to pay for the rest of the story. For now, I’ll say as I always\
  \ do, see the sights you can and read about those you can’t. Safe travels, readers!</p>\
