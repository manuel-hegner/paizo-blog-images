  \ three maps in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92ll/\"><i>Wrath of the Righteous Poster\
  \ Map Folio</i></a> is a player-oriented, illustrated map of the Abyss. It is a\
  \ thing of beauty and I think Ben Wootten really outdid himself with this map. Anyone\
  \ who's picked up the last few Poster Map Folios have undoubtedly seen Ben's illustrated\
  \ maps for the Shackles, Varisia, and Irrisen, but this one goes above and beyond.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>So, how <i>do</i> you map a nearly infinite plane?</p> \n    <p>I was\
  \ eager to see this thing happen, but at the onset I was a bit perplexed as to the\
  \ best approach. Many planar maps look more like diagrams, and I knew I didn't want\
  \ to go that route. The chaotic nature of the Abyss lends itself to further complications,\
  \ as some of the 40+ realms have tight relationships to one another and thus need\
  \ to be physically near each otherâ€”some realms are described as being above, below,\
  \ or adjacent to others. The first thing I did was to see if we could actually fit\
  \ all the realms on a single page and have the whole thing actually do justice to\
  \ the illustrations. If they would be too tiny to even see clearly there wouldn't\
  \ be a strong reason to do the map. </p> \n    <p>I went home that night and started\
  \ plotting out the relations of each of the realms and the size they'd be represented\
  \ as on the map. I generated a basic shape and size, and then blocked off a sheet\
  \ of paper to show their spatial relations to each other. I came back the next day\
  \ with a sheet of paper in hand marked all over with weird, numbered shapes. I had\
  \ to explain my madness a bit, so I pointed out which shape was which realm and\
  \ why they were where they were. I sensed some reluctance about this ambitious plan\
  \ to map the Abyss, so James and I sat down in his office and tinkered with and\
  \ sketched out a few alternate ways to map the Abyss. (One thing James wanted to\
  \ do was evoke the feeling of a vast pit, so I rolled up the sketch map into a cone\
  \ to bend space and time and form the flat Abyss into a pit. Ta-da!)</p> \n    <p>Once\
  \ we all agreed on the sketch, I wrote up a one-sentence description of each of\
  \ the realms and what kind of things might be in them, and then sent that document\
  \ and my sketch to Ben to use as references. He immediately got the idea I was going\
  \ for, and he started to work on drawing each of the realms and connecting them\
  \ all together. It was especially nice that he was our guest at PaizoCon last year,\
  \ because that meant I got time to talk to him about the map while he was working\
  \ on it, and I could clarify any questions or concerns he might have had with it.\
  \ During the process, it was great seeing sketches to update us on how the map was\
  \ progressing, but it was a true delight to see the final product. I love maps,\
  \ and helping map out the Abyss was a ton of fun. I'm not going to reveal the final\
  \ image, you're just going to have to pick up <a href=\"/products/btpy92ll/\"><i>Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous Poster Map Folio</i></a> to gaze into the Abyss yourself.</p>\
