  \ the northern hemisphere's transition from dreary winter weather to warmer days.\
  \ Of course in Seattle, winter's departure means that instead of raining every other\
  \ day, it has been raining almost every day. Fortunately, there are two new scenarios\
  \ that you can enjoy with pleasant company as we banish the wintry doldrums and\
  \ help the Pathfinders' allies escape their own dangerous predicaments.</p> \n \

  ></a>\n     <br> Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry and Tamrin Credence, heist-planner\
  \ extraordinaire!\n    </div> \n    <p>Like the Pacific Northwest, the Gloomspires\
  \ off the west coast of Garund both see their fair share of precipitation and experience\
  \ predictable periods of pleasantly navigable weather (okay, perhaps I'm being a\
  \ little unfair, as Seattle is positively gorgeous in time for <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a>). A team of Pathfinders recently returned to the Gloomspires to explore\
  \ Sevenfingers' tomb, but Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry—illustrated here for the\
  \ first time—has heard nothing from them since. Fearing they are in need of aid,\
  \ she has asks the PCs to mount a rescue in <a href=\"/products/btpy9k92\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-19</em>: \"Labyrinth of Hungry Ghosts\"</a> by Tom Phillips.\
  \ As in <a href=\"/products/btpy9986\">last season's visit to the Gloomspires</a>,\
  \ Tom has created an adventure rich in atmosphere and steeped in thematically wowing\
  \ danger. One of my favorite elements of the Gloomspires is that they're Tom's creation,\
  \ dating back to his 2012 RPG Superstar submission, meaning he has been able to\
  \ take an especially active role in presenting the site and unveiling its secrets.\
  \ Linda and I hope you have as much fun playing through them as much as we developing\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p>I would also like to recognize Sean Macdonald, who has handled\
  \ the majority of the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild's</a> custom maps for several years. He does great work overall, yet Linda\
  \ and I were especially impressed with the visual impact of his cartography for\
  \ this assignment.</p> \n    <p>Not all getaways need transpire in the nigh-inaccessible\
  \ locales, as our third and final installment in the Faithless and Forgotten series\
  \ shows: <a href=\"/products/btpy9huz\">\"The Infernal Inheritance\"</a>. An ally\
  \ of the Society has disappeared, and the Pathfinders have traced him to one of\
  \ the cruelest facilities in Ostenso: a prison known as the Bloody Nail. Fortunately\
  \ the Society has the local expertise of the halfling Tamrin Credence, an expert\
  \ in planning heists and getting out alive. He can get the PCs into the facility,\
  \ but from there its up to them to evade the security, find the captive, and escape\
  \ one of Cheliax's most militarized cities. <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a>\
  \ 2015 finalist Christopher Wasko has composed a great heist with lots of options\
  \ for a wide range of PCs—a fitting conclusion to this three-part series that contains\
  \ several big secrets.</p> \n    <p>In parting, remember that Tonya and I are appearing\
  \ on the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">Know Direction\
  \ podcast</a> on April 6th to answer questions about future campaign developments,\
  \ including the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lil4\">upcoming seeker arc</a>. We\
  \ hope to see you there!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <em>Pathfinder Society Lead\
