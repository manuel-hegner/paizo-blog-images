  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8voq\">playtest of <i>Mythic Adventures</i></a>. This\
  \ exciting book, due out in August 2013, gives you the chance to play a hero that\
  \ is a cut above the ordinary sellsword, more powerful than your average hedge wizard,\
  \ and able to take on challenges far beyond those of his ordinary contemporaries.\
  \ Like Hercules and Achilles, these heroes inspire legends with their every deed,\
  \ facing horrible foes and taking on dangerous quests that most would consider impossible.\
  \ This playtest is a sample of the rules, giving you all the tools you need to run\
  \ a mythic game or two right now, as well as the chance to tell us what works and\
  \ what needs work.</span></p> \n     <p><i>Mythic Adventures</i> is more than an\
  \ ordinary sourcebook. It offers players and GMs a new way to play the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG, from the humble beginnings of 1st level, to the lofty realms of power of\
  \ 20th. You can use these rules to run a campaign where the players are mythic from\
  \ the first session just as easily as you can use them to run a campaign where they\
  \ are only mythic for a single game. The mythic rules can be used how you want,\
  \ at any point in the campaign.</p> \n     <p>Put simply, the mythic rules allow\
  \ characters (and monsters) to break some of the fundamental rules of the game.\
  \ They allow a character to cheat death, to change the outcome of die rolls, and\
  \ even to act twice in one turn. While mythic characters do get some statistical\
  \ bonuses to denote their raw potential, much of their power comes from what they\
  \ can do that others cannot, at least without having quite a few more levels. How\
  \ many levels is the big question. This is where you come in.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ playtest of these rules is important to help us balance the overall system. These\
  \ powers and abilities add a lot to the capabilities of characters and monsters,\
  \ and it’s important to see how much this addition affects the overall power balance\
  \ of the game. We need you to use these rules in your game, even if for just one\
  \ or two sessions, and to give us your impression as to how the rules affect the\
  \ game. While your initial impression from just reading the rules is valuable, actual\
  \ play experience is by far more useful to our process. When playtesting the rules,\
  \ please keep the following points in mind.</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>All playtest\
  \ feedback should be posted to the following <i>Mythic Adventures</i> Playtest forums:\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/mythicAdventuresPlaytest/general\"\
  >General Discussion</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/mythicAdventuresPlaytest/playerFeedback\"\
  >Player Feedback</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/mythicAdventuresPlaytest/gmFeedback\"\
  >GM Feedback</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/mythicAdventuresPlaytest/adventureFeedback\"\
  >Adventure Feedback</a>.</li> \n      <li>Please check the forum for any similar\
  \ topics before posting, and add to an existing thread whenever possible.</li> \n\
  \      <li>Please try to read the entire document before posting. You may find that\
  \ your question is answered in a later section of the rules.</li> \n      <li>Remember,\
  \ we would prefer actual playtest feedback. Use the rules, don’t just imagine how\
  \ they might work.</li> \n      <li>Be civil! Remember that everyone on the forum\
  \ is here for the same goal, to make a better game. Remember that the experience\
  \ of others may be different from your own and starting an argument over a differing\
  \ viewpoint does no service to the playtest. Posters who violate these guidelines\
  \ will find themselves given a timeout and have offending threads locked.</li> \n\
  \      <li>Have fun. These rules are designed to add an extra edge of excitement\
  \ to your game, allowing you to throw over-the-top situations at your characters.\
  \ Share your stories with us and your fellow playtesters.</li>\n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <p>Now get out there, <a href=\"/products/btpy8voq\">grab the document</a>,\
  \ give it a read, and play! I am looking forward to reading your thoughts, comments,\
  \ and criticisms about these rules. The playtest will run from now until noon (PST)\
  \ on Monday, January 14th. See you on the boards.</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
