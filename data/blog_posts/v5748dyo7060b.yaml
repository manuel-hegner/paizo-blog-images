  \ with supreme regret that Ulka concluded the younger Blackjackets were looking\
  \ at her with <em>admiration</em>. Not a revelation she wanted to have on the battlefield,\
  \ especially while splattered with ghoul blood. She grimaced and wiped the flecks\
  \ of crimson sludge off her arm, tinting streaks of her green skin black. The length\
  \ of her polearm usually kept the mess at bay, but these rotbags were full of more\
  \ fluids than she was used to, and they tended to <em>burst</em>.</p>\n      <p>It\
  \ would take <strong>hours</strong> of scrubbing to kill any chance of an undead\
  \ infection, and Lake Encarthan’s waters were probably just as tainted as the battlefield\
  \ she stood on. Hell on a pike. Where? Where had she gone wrong? The Blackjackets\
  \ were infamous for their loyalty to Druma and nothing else, and their masters knew\
  \ the worth of that devotion. High pay, respect and prestige, the best equipment\
  \ and training, pressed and fitted uniforms made of sturdy cloth, and thick leather\
  \ boots to ward off the mud. The fashion wasn’t to Ulka’s taste, but she couldn’\
  t complain about the quality. Not even Andoran’s army provided their irregulars\
  \ with anything close. The skinflints in Druma even managed to keep a decent supply\
  \ line running, and the Blackjacket’s civilian caravan had done a solid job of handling\
  \ logistics...</p>\n      <p>The caravan! Screw the gods sideways, that was it,\
  \ wasn’t it? She and her regulars just <em>had</em> to barge to the rescue when\
  \ those shadowy forms had descended upon the civilian caravan. Dammit, dammit, dammit!\
  \ She just had to look the hero, didn't she? She just <em>had</em> to feel a twinge\
  \ in her black, shriveled lump of a heart at the thought of families and children\
  \ getting slaughtered by something they couldn’t even touch! Ulka hated the fact\
  \ civilians were even out here to begin with, but it was inevitable with mercenary\
  \ groups this large. The fighters weren’t patriots, you couldn’t convince them to\
  \ put up with the lonely hardships of a mere soldier.</p>\n      <p>Why did it have\
  \ to be <em>shadows</em>? The caravan might not have needed her help against zombies\
  \ or skeletons. They had a bold few who’d put up a resistance—Ulka made a mental\
  \ note to circle around to that sullen little dwarven fletcher when this mess was\
  \ done—but what could knitting needles and laundry lines do against something with\
  \ no flesh?</p>\n      <p>Ugh, had she saved someone's husband? A daughter? That\
  \ wasn’t the kind of devotion she could scare off with her usual tactic of being\
  \ brutish and blunt. The very <em>last</em> thing she needed was more fresh-faced,\
  \ bright-eyed whelps deciding they wanted to run along at her heels. From a moral\
  \ standpoint, they weren’t that much better than the undead they were fighting.\
  \ War camp hangers-on tended to be the kind of people who would smash in a dying\
  \ widow’s nose in the rush to loot her family jewel box. But they were still people,\
  \ and people always made things <em>messy</em>. She’d hear them sing songs around\
  \ the campfire, watch them toss treats to the dogs, see one dance a little jig with\
  \ his son. They’d save her the prime cuts of bacon at breakfast, ply her with bottles\
  \ of Belkzen gin. They’d laugh at her stern grumbles and idle threats. They’d <em>like</em>her.\
  \ They’d rush to save her on the battlefield and take an arrow straight to the throat.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Ulka ground her teeth against the back of her tusks. There was still a\
  \ fight to be won.</p>\n      <p>She let out a howl that ripped across the battlefield,\
  \ an undulating cry that an Andoren soldier had likened to a shepherd’s call sung\
  \ by a wolf. Her scattered soldiers marched up, spears out, to form up around her\
  \ in the brackish muck.</p>\n      <p>“These ghouls want flesh?” she yelled. “Rip\
  \ their damned feet off their damned legs and cram them down their damned throats!”\
  \ Her soldiers laughed as they charged into the fray, like the rotten rat bastards\
  \ that they were.</p>\n      <p>Ulka followed behind them, assessing the situation.\
  \ Barring reinforcements from the lake, the battle wasn’t likely to last much longer.\
  \ The Tyrant might have unfathomable horrors at his command, but those weren’t here.\
  \ These were nothing more than offal Tar-Baphon had thrown at a hapless village\
  \ to clear out space in his barracks. Her mercenaries and the Blackjackets would\
  \ obliterate them, along with anything else unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Though perhaps not without casualties. There was a sudden roar from somewhere\
  \ out on the water, as one of the stilted houses nearby exploded into flames. The\
  \ shockwave sent the seasoned warriors onto the wrong foot; even Ulka stumbled.\
  \ A minor error, speaking to their military discipline, yet the dead were not so\
  \ easily stunned. The ghouls pounced.</p>\n      <p>Ulka gave a shrill whistle,\
  \ using her polearm to gesture to the caravan behind her. “Artillery fire! Retreat\
  \ inland!” she commanded. That had almost certainly been a volley from one of the\
  \ Tyrant's skeletal warships, not that Ulka could see far enough in this quadruple-damned\
  \ sunlight to confirm. May Sarenrae find a dead rat in her most holy breakfast.\
  \ If Ulka ever met the goddess, she'd pluck that sunbird like a pheasant and string\
  \ her up in the larder.</p>\n      <p>The ghouls loped into the Blackjacket front\
  \ lines as the soldiers began to fall back, rusted blades and rotting nails seeking\
  \ gaps in their targets' armor. A Blackjacket youth stepped wrong in the loose earth,\
  \ stumbling as the reedy grass caused his boot to slip. Ulka stepped up beside the\
  \ man—a boy, in truth—and, in a single smooth motion, swung her polearm up in an\
  \ arc that ripped through the ground. She ran on swift, simple instinct, the kind\
  \ that must be earned if one wanted to ply the trade of war and live past twenty.\
  \ It came with enough force to rip the ghoul’s legs clean off its torso.</p>\n \
