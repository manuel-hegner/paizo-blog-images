  description\">With the current state of affairs, we wish all our community to take\
  \ measures to keep themselves and others safe. Please do not attend public games\
  \ if you feel ill. We encourage the community organizers to assess the situation\
  \ for their area and formulate a plan.</p> \n      <p>For those wanting to game\
  \ but not wanting to gather in public places, the Online Community, led by Regional\
  \ Venture-Coordinator Jesse Davis, have a full roster of virtual tabletop and play-by-post\
  \ games. For more information or to register for games, visit the Org Play Online\
  \ discord channel.</p> \n      <p>A quick update on our tech backlog. I’ve been\
  \ poking around the system (you may have seen some of my efforts) and have pieces\
  \ in place as soon as we can get the user-interface complete and through quality\
  \ assurance. This includes updates to 0 table Starfinder GMs and erroneous AcP numbers.\
  \ Will update again when we have a firmer rollout date.</p> \n      <h2>Welcome\
  \ Alex</h2> \n      <p>I asked Alex to write a few words of introduction to share\
  \ with you!</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>Hi nufriends! I’m Alex Speidel,\
  \ the new Organized Play Associate (read: Tonya’s minion). Our Venture Officers\
  \ are already well-acquainted with me, as I’ve been sending them everything they’\
  ve asked for over the past few weeks.</p> \n       <p>I’ve been playing Starfinder\
  \ since its release in 2017; I’m here for the “roleplaying” part of the roleplaying\
  \ game, and I think it’s a great universe to explore. When I’m not in the Pact Worlds,\
  \ I’m watching reality TV at home, reading sci-fi and fantasy, or getting ice cream\
  \ with my future husband. Moving to Seattle is a great chance for us to get out\
  \ and explore the beauty out here, and I’m excited to come out to conventions and\
  \ meet you all! If you like to make bad decisions, you can follow me on Twitter\
  \ at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexSpeidel\" target=\"_blank\">@AlexSpeidel</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      </blockquote> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n      <p>Developer James\
  \ Case led the charge on getting the next bit of sanctioning through the door for\
  \ Pathfinder Society (second edition). We updated the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options#discuss\"\
  ></a> with information from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</i></a> and a few other clarification bits.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We still have Pathfinder (first edition) sanctioning in the hopper\
  \ but had a few setbacks that mean a bit longer delay, as we ensure scenarios move\
  \ through the production line and look to our convention season deadlines. Thank\
  \ you for your patience. </p> \n      <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n      <p>We awarded\
  \ no coins during the past month.</p> \n      <h2>Stars, Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>One GM reached their 5th star in December. We still have a few weeks\
  \ in 2019 for those trying to earn their 5th star before the year’s end. Doing so\
  \ indicates a commitment to organized play, as to achieve this milestone, GMs must\
  \ run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! </p> \n      <p>Congratulations to <b>Michael Owen\
  \ Hill</b> and <b>Betty Osthoff</b> on achieving their 5th star!</p> \n      <p>We\
  \ had no GMs reach their 5th Nova this month.</p> \n      <p>Glyphs exist in our\
  \ system and they just need a bit of webcoding to get them to show up!</p> \n  \
  \    <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n      <p>You can play in Society games at any\
  \ of the conventions listed below! The list includes all submissions as of 3 March.\
  \ If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for\
  \ support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event.\
  \ All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website,\
  \ social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in\
  \ either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer\
  \ for more information! </p> \n      <table width=\"800\"> \n       <thead style=\"\
