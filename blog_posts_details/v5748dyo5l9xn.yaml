    \ own eyes. He turned"

  artist: "the beaming proprietor of the institution, a middle-aged gentleman with\
    \ bulging chest and biceps, a broken nose, and cauliflower ears. \"Come right\
    \ in, Mr. Thorne. Take a chair. A wonderful frame you have to put muscle on. Now\
    \ with our system of training we guarantee to add an inch to the circumference\
    \ of your biceps in less than-⎯\" \"One moment, Mr. McGinnis. I came here to be\
    \ built up, not physically, but financially. In short, I am after that job you\
    \ advertised in this morning's paper.\" McGinnis settled back, a look of disappointment\
    \ on his face. \"Oh, so you want a job as my assistant fencing master. Can you\
    \ handle a foil?\" \"Fencing has been a hobby of mine.\" \"A hobby, eh? You'll\
    \ have to make it a profession if you work here. But come. I'll try you out.\"\
    \ McGinnis led him down the hallway, and through a large room where a group of\
    \ perspiring financiers dressed in shorts and jerseys were going through various\
    \ contortions under the direction of a husky looking young man wearing a striped\
    \ sweater. A conspicuous majority of these striving athletes looked as if their\
    \ chests had slipped down beneath their belts, and the calves and biceps were\
    \ undeveloped. They passed through another room, where a number of corpulent gentlemen\
    \ were being mauled, poked, pinched, prodded and steam-cooked, and thence into\
    \ a small empty gymnasium. McGinnis removed his coat and invited Thorne to do\
    \ likewise. Then he handled him plastron, mask, glove and foil, and both men armed\
    \ themselves. \"Now, my lad,\" said McGinnis, when Thorne was ready, \"we'll see\
    \ what we'll see. On guard!\" They saluted and engaged. Before he had got fairly\
    \ warmed up, McGinnis, much to his surprise, was hit. \"Accidents will happen,\"\
    \ he said. \"We'll try again.\" They did, and this time McGinnis was disarmed.\
    \ The sudden realization of this made him quite red in the face—he, a fencing\
    \ master, disarmed by this amateur. \"That was a coincidence,\" he said, as Thorne\
    \ politely handed him his foil. \"We'll try it once more.\" Much to his astonishment\
    \ and chagrin, the master was hit in the fifth disengage. He threw down his foil\
    \ and tore off his mask. \"Enough's enough.\" He growled. \"Do I get the job?\"\
    \ asked Thorne. \"Not in a thousand years, my boy. Do you think I'd be fool enough\
    \ to hire an assistant who can beat me? Don't slam the door as you go out.\" Out\
    \ on the street once more, Thorne fished his last fifty cent piece"
