  date\">Tuesday, March 8, 2011</p> \n   <p>In last week's Design Tuesday blog, I\
  \ delved into the importance of terrain to push your encounter design to the next\
  \ level, and provided you with some design philosophy to ponder when designing your\
  \ own terrain. This week, I'm back with some concrete examples.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ Pathfinder Roleplaying Game assumes combatants are able to use their movement\
  \ abilities with little or no hindrance. Sure, there are walls, doors, and difficult\
  \ terrain to navigate, or maybe some obscuring effects to grant a little concealment,\
  \ but for the most part PCs and monsters have free reign to move about the rooms\
  \ and corridors of the dungeon as they wish. The following types of terrain are\
  \ all exceptions to this norm. While some act as difficult terrain, they present\
  \ further hazards while navigating the battlefield.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>One\
  \ thing to keep in mind about all of these new terrain types is that they typically\
  \ work best as smaller, tactically placed patches. You may be tempted to fill an\
  \ entire battlefield with one of these new terrains, but doing this should be the\
  \ exception rather than the rule. They all work best when they give characters a\
  \ choice between freedom and danger. When properly placed, they can reward the use\
  \ of combat maneuvers and spells that grant increased mobility to allies or restrict\
  \ or force the movement of enemies, and may limit the opportunities to make charge\
  \ attacks without stymieing that tactic outright.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p> You may\
  \ notice that these new terrain types are very similar to the hazards presented\
  \ on pages 244â€“245 of the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ffn\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i></a>. So what is the difference between\
  \ these terrains and hazards? These hazardous terrains involve slightly more choice\
  \ on the part of combatant than hazards do. Most, if not all, have effects when\
  \ a character chooses to move into or is forced into them, and those effects should\
  \ be relatively easy to determine before the combatant enters them, either by way\
  \ of their physical characteristic or an easy Knowledge check (DC 10) of the appropriate\
  \ type.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Anchor Stone</b>: This strange\
  \ stone has a debilitating gravitational effect on those who do not traverse over\
  \ it quickly. Each time a creature starts its turn on an area of anchor stone, it\
  \ must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw. Any creature that fails can only\
  \ take a 5-foot step on its turn. Any creature that succeeds at the saving throw\
  \ must move at half speed on its turn.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>To take the effects\
  \ of anchor stone, a creature must be standing on or touching the stone. Anchor\
  \ stone has no effect on those who fly over it or otherwise do not have physical\
  \ contact with the stone.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Some areas of anchor stone are\
  \ more powerful than others, having a DC of 15, 20, or even higher.</p>\n    <p>\
  \ </p>\n    <p><b>Choke Spores</b>: This type of fungus thrives in subterranean\
  \ caves and other damp and lightless areas. The first time a creature starts its\
  \ turn within an area containing choke spores, the poison of the fungus is released,\
  \ inflicting those within that space with the following poison.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Choke Spore Poison</b></p> \n     <p><b>Type</b>\
  \ poison, inhaled; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 14</p> \n     <p><b>Frequency</b> 1/round\
  \ for 1d4 rounds</p> \n     <p></p><b>Effect</b> 1 Dex and 1 Wis damage; <b>Cure</b>\
  \ 1 save\n     <p> </p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Once an area of choke spores\
  \ releases its poison, that area becomes dormant for 1 day. With a single standard\
  \ action, a creature can use fire (from a torch, a <i>flaming</i> magical weapon,\
  \ or a similar implement) to destroy all the choke spore balls within all 5-foot-squares\
  \ adjacent to the creature. Acid, cold, and fire damage from area effect spells\
  \ automatically destroy patches of choke spores within the spells' effect areas.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Fey Mist</b>: This strange swirling mist of purple and\
  \ green gas and motes of light dazzles those who stray within it. Fey mist provides\
  \ concealment. Furthermore, a living, non-fey creature that starts its turn within\
  \ the mist must make a DC 12 Will saving throw or become confused for 1 round. Those\
  \ that make their saving throws are dazzled for 1 round instead. This is an enchantment\
  \ effect.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p> Some areas of fey mist are more powerful than\
  \ others, and have and require a DC 15, DC 20, or even DC 25 Will saving throw to\
  \ avoid its confusion.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Flame</b>: A house is on fire\
  \ and that flame rages in large areas, a hellish landscape burns around you, or\
  \ a large bonfire rages in a clearing where a coven of witches chant evil incantations.\
  \ While the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> has rules for forest fires, sometimes\
  \ you may want to have a section of an encounter area that just burns.</p>\n   \
  \ <p> </p>\n    <p> When a creature starts its turn with its space fully within\
  \ an area of flame, it takes 1d6 points of fire damage, and if the creature is wearing\
  \ metal armor, it is affected as if by a <i>heat metal</i> spell. A creature that\
  \ starts its turn with its space only partially within an area of flame must succeed\
  \ at a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or take the damage and the <i>heat metal</i> effect\
  \ if it is wearing metal armor. A creature that moves through areas of flame must\
  \ make a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage, but avoids\
  \ the <i>heat metal</i> effect. This save is made the first time a creature moves\
  \ into flame with a move action or when it is affected by something that pushes\
  \ or otherwise forces the creature into an area of flame. </p>\n    <p> </p>\n \
  \   <p> Supernatural or powerful flames can have higher DCs. A raging fire can have\
  \ a DC of 15 or the fires of Hell can have a DC of 20, 25, or 30 depending on the\
  \ power of the flames.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p> Areas of flame often create smoke,\
  \ the effects of which can be found on page 444 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Haunted Ground</b>: These areas of accursed ground are\
  \ often the sites of horrid crimes or intense and bloody battles. The intense fear\
  \ of those who lost their lives lingers and saturates the area. This fear affects\
  \ living creatures that stray within these areas. A living creature that starts\
  \ its turn in an area of haunted ground must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw\
  \ or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the creature is already shaken, it becomes\
  \ frightened for the same duration instead. Frightened creatures become panicked\
  \ for the same duration instead. Creatures that are immune to fear effects are immune\
  \ to haunted ground. </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Razor Rubble</b>: Either rubble\
  \ made of sharp stone, or laced with small sharp blades, this terrain functions\
  \ like difficult terrain (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>193), but each\
  \ square a creature enters deals 1 point of damage to that creature. A creature\
  \ moving at half speed, or that succeeds at a DC 15 Acrobatics check as a free action\
  \ when first moving into an area of razor rubble can avoid the damaging affects\
  \ for the round but not the difficult terrain effect.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Slick\
  \ Ice</b>: A frozen lake, a sheen of thick ice on a dungeon or cavern floor, or\
  \ some other cold and slick surface, slick ice can be hard to traverse, but can\
  \ also increase the speed of creatures that are agile or foolhardy enough to utilize\
  \ its surface's lack of friction.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>A creature traversing\
  \ slick ice at more than half speed is required to make a DC 15 Acrobatic check\
  \ at the start of the movement. Failure causes the creature to fall prone at the\
  \ start of the movement. Running or charging on slick ice increases the DC by 5,\
  \ with the same effect on a failed skill check. A creature that succeeds at this\
  \ check by 5 or more can increase its move across the ice by 10 feet, but is considered\
  \ flat-footed until the start of its next turn. Creatures (like those with enough\
  \ levels of barbarian or rogue) that can't be caught flat-footed at the start of\
  \ combat are immune to this flat-footed effect as well.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Tentacle\
  \ Mold</b>: This strange vermillion fungus clings to the moist walls, floors, and\
  \ even ceilings of dungeons and caverns. When a living creature is in or near a\
  \ patch of this fungus, acidic pseudopods lash out, with sickening effect.</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n    <p>When a living creature starts it turn in an area of or in\
  \ a square next to (if it clings to the walls or the ceiling) of tentacle mold,\
  \ it must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw; on a failed saving throw the creature\
  \ takes 1 acid damage and is sickened for 1 round. Though the effect is like a poison,\
  \ this is not actually a poison effect; the strange chemistry of this kind of mold\
  \ makes it more alchemical in nature.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Stephen\
