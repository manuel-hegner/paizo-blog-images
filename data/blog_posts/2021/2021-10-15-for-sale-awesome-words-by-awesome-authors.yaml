              <h3>Tineke Bolleman</h3>
              <p><em>The Menagerie, Familiars, Familiar and Master Abilities</em><br>
                Hello everyone, I am Tineke Bolleman (she/her) and I wrote the familiars and the Menagerie for Grand Bazaar. I love all kinds of animals, so getting to write a shop that puts the animals’ welfare first was great for me. And making new familiars so we all have new friends to take with us on adventures was amazing. Other than writing for Grand Bazaar, I do occasionally write for other Paizo lines. I volunteer for the Organized Play program and I’ve been a tabletop gamer for many years. You can follow me on twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DireOtterGames">@direottergames</a>&nbsp;for weird game posts, geeking out about animals, and the occasional cat picture.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her)</h3>
              <p><em>Merrygleam, Toys, Absalom Ads</em><br>
                Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a freelance author and Starfinder Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. I’ve contributed to over 30 projects for Paizo, including&nbsp;<em>Secrets of Magic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tech Revolution</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starfinder #39: The Gilded Cage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>,&nbsp;<em>Book of the Dead</em>,&nbsp;<em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>,&nbsp;<em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Galactic Magic</em>.</p>
              <p>For&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em>, rather than write for myself, I wrote for my children. I wrote the toy shop, Merrygleam, its quirky shopkeep Ozi and her found family, and the toys and other goodies you’ll find inside. Additionally, I wrote Absalom Ads, a ‘training-manual-by-magical-mail’ company led by an absurdly over-the-top halfling. I hope Merrygleam, in particular, brings some joy to your world.<br>
                All the best,<br>
                Jessica</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Dana Ebert</h3>
              <p><em>Material Changes</em><br>
                Hello! My name is Dana Ebert (she/her), and it was my pleasure to write about Material Changes and its illustrious proprietor, Iltara Clavela. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder, and I'm thrilled to finally be able to share it with all of you—although I must give credit for all the fabulous items available at the boutique to the extremely talented Jessica Redekop!</p>
              <p>I didn't set out at first to write a transgender story, but the themes of transformation and revelation were so central to Iltara's character that as I penned my first draft, it became the obvious choice. As a trans woman myself, it was nerve-wracking to submit something that felt so personal, but I received nothing but support and encouragement from the outstanding team at Paizo. It is my sincere hope that Iltara's story will mean just as much to other people.</p>
              <p>In the end, the Grand Bazaar is a triumph of a book, and I'm proud to have been part of it. If you want to know more about what I'm working on, the best places to visit are my Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG">@MistressDanaRPG)</a>&nbsp;or Linktree (<a href="https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG">https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG</a>).

              <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3>
              <p><em>Kraken's Ink Tattoo, Tattoos, Worn Items</em><br>
                Hi all! I’m Avi Kool, and I’m senior editor at Paizo. I had the pleasure of being co–edit lead on this book with Patrick Hurley, as well as writing the Kraken’s Ink section and a handful of worn items, including the tattoos. You can see my writing in books such as&nbsp;<em>Bestiary 3</em>&nbsp;(Nosferatu) and&nbsp;<em>Alien Archive 4</em>&nbsp;(The Seen), as well as in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>. My NPC in this book, Arhan, is meant to be a representation of my Sephardic ancestors and their flight from imperial Spain, so this book is very near and dear to my heart. I hope you all enjoy it.</p>

              <h3>Dustin Knight</h3>
              <p><em>Catfish Salvage Solutions, Adventuring Gear</em><br>
                Greetings and welcome to the Grand Bazaar! I'm afraid my friend Tattletail is out getting more Anuli spice right now, but maybe I can help you. Who am I? Here, I'm known for peddling adventuring gear like fake blood packs and smoked goggles. Having the opportunity to write a character with a prosthesis like Tattletail means so much to me. I helped look after my late grandmother for many years, and her strength of character is something that helped inspire my work. You might also know me as a blogger on the&nbsp;<a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/author/dustin/">Know Direction Network</a>, PFS Venture Lieutenant in King County, and the host of a third-party review&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kitsunewarlock">Pathfinder Twitch Show every Tuesday and Friday</a>!

              <p><em>Poppets</em><br>
                I'm Ron. I wrote the poppets! Please love them. I do.</p>

              <h3>Randal Meyer</h3>
              <p><em>The Rune Room, Accessory Runes</em><br>
                A fan of Pathfinder since the beginning, I have always enjoyed tinkering with the rules in my own games. After joining the online Pathfinder communities, I knew that I wanted to get more involved in producing game content. That journey started with becoming a blogger at Know Direction, where I write my Groundbreaking blog (and sometimes others) and write reviews of the big GenCon releases from Paizo. I had an absolute blast writing Rakuskuk and the Rune Room. Working with the other writers made it so easy to ground him in the lore of Golarion, Absalom, and the Grand Bazaar itself. I am excited to see how his story grows. Accessory Runes are a wonderful addition to the game that I am proud to have worked on. I cannot wait to see where they go from here. When not working directly on new content, I am probably working on my other passion project... the RPG Sage. I am a big fan of playing RPGs via Discord and so I decided to write my own bot to help immerse myself and others into our games! You can learn more about it and give it a test run on my Discord Server at&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.rpgsage.io/">https://discord.rpgsage.io/</a></p>

              <h3>Jacob W. Michaels</h3>
              <p><em>Magic Armor, Staves, Wands</em><br>
                Hi, I’m Jacob W. Michaels, one of Paizo’s freelancers. Normally, I’d tell you here how excited I am for you all to see and play with the staves and wands I wrote. But... no, come in a little closer... closer... OK, good... the truth is I mostly just can't wait for the magic armor and runes I wrote to become available because I’ve been saving up gold pieces for a long time for them on a couple of characters. This was a great book to work on, with wonderful developers and fantastic freelancers, and we hope you love it.

              <h3>Matt Morris</h3>
              <p><em>Skymetals, Spell Trickster</em><br>
                I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including&nbsp;<a href="http://everybodygames.net/">Everybody Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p>
              <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting in the&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, and now I'm excited to be contributing to the biggest market in Absalom. If you manage to smuggle some skymetal out of Numeria or learn the secrets of the Spell Trickster, you'll be in my corner of the Bazaar!</p>
              <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a>&nbsp;if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p>
              <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, PA.</p>

              <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3>
              <p><em>Mask and Moon</em><br>
                Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, and I wrote The Mask and Moon, Absalom’s premier magical dining venue; Erin Roberts did a great job on the accompanying magical food section. Speaking of, why just conjure your food when you can intricately weave cooking and magic to create something truly spectacular!

              <p>Read Jess’s blog entry here for particular Paizo staff members you should thank - I echo her sentiments 100%. I’m proud to work with such dedicated and talented folks. I’d also like to recognize the folks at Paizo who keep the website running, books flowing in and out of the warehouse, orders and customer concerns handled, and all the less public-facing but no less essential work of running a publishing business.</p>
              <p>Finally, I and frequent freelancers Isabelle Thorne and Mikhail Rekun are working on the Luminant Age, a 3rd-party campaign setting for Pathfinder 2E. We recently sent&nbsp;<em>Fauna of the Luminant Age</em>&nbsp;to Kickstarter backers, which includes vampire anteater dogs and rats that can make you teleport to death. We’ve got more projects in the works on the run-up to the full campaign setting book—stay updated at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">our Twitter account</a>!</p>

              <h3>Dave Nelson</h3>
              <p><em>Historia Reliquary, Magic Ammunition</em><br>
                Greetings, traveler. You, yes you! Enter the Historia Reliquary and see the legends of Avistan long lost. Garundi history? Oh yes, we have that too, somewhere in the back. But first, look at this arrow. Carved head to look like a rhinoceros. It dates back to the Sixth Army of Exploration in Taldor. I suppose I could part with it, to someone who understands its historical significance...</p>
              <p>Dave Nelson is a neurodivergent freelancer who is happy to have contributed to Grand Bazaar, writing the magic ammunition and the details of the Historia Reliquary. In particular he is excited to provide positive autistic representation, a cause he feels strongly about, through the proprietor of the Reliquary. Please enjoy!</p>

                Hello! I'm Jess, and I wrote the new clothing and other items available in the Material Changes shop (just the items! Credit to Dana Ebert for the rest of the Material Changes entry). I had a great time working on Grand Bazaar with my fellow authors, with Luis and Eleanor as the book's development leads, Mark as the design lead, Patrick and Avi as editorial leads, and all the other people needed to make these books happen. I am privileged to be part of this great and talented network of people who collaborate and create together, and to have such a wonderful, kind, and fierce group of peers</p>

                Hello! I’m Erin Roberts (she/her), and I’m thrilled to be making my Pathfinder (and published TTRPG) debut in Logbee! I had the absolute pleasure of writing Khisa, who shares my passion for storytelling and social justice, and her Relics &amp; Remembrance shop. I also had a blast creating Alchemical and Magical Tapas to complement The Mask and the Moon, the restaurant written by Andrew Mullen that my tastebuds desperately wish existed.</p>
              <p>While this is my first Paizo project, there's more to come, so keep an eye out for my work in&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>&nbsp;and other projects yet to be announced. You can follow all of my work (including my prose science fiction/fantasy/horror writing) on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nirele">@nirele</a>&nbsp;or check out my website at&nbsp;<a href="http://writingwonder.com/">writingwonder.com</a>.

              <h3>Shay Snow</h3>
              <p><em>Kitten’s Slumber, Magic Weapons</em><br>
                Hey! I’m Shay Snow (they/them) and I wrote the shop Kitten’s Slumber for&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens The Grand Bazaar</em>! I really enjoyed creating a familiar sanctuary and crafting the relationship between quiet Roswine and exuberant Cabbage, who might just a little bit be based on my orange cat, Beans! You may have also seen my writing in a couple of Starfinder Society scenarios, as well as&nbsp;<em>Secrets of Magic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tech Revolution</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Bestiary 3</em>. I have a few more entries in upcoming books, including&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em>.</p>
              <p>I also pop up around Coyote &amp; Crow and have a few things being announced with them soon!</p>
              <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media.

              <p><em>Tesyovensku’s Warehouse, Animal Companions, Companion Items</em><br>
                Howdy! I’m Ashton, and I wrote the animal companions, companion items, and the skymetal shop, Tesyovensku’s Warehouse! As someone who came out as nonbinary relatively recently, getting to write up a nonbinary character was a real treasure for me. Plus, I got to whip up some really interesting animal companions, and I think the&nbsp;<em>hosteling statuette</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>swarmform collar</em>&nbsp;offer some exciting options for characters with companions. Do me a favor and kill a Big Bad with a swarm of pangolins, if you can!</p>
              <p>If you’d like to keep up with me online, I’m pretty active on Twitter, where you can find me as&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/WhoTweetedThis">@WhoTweetedThis</a>, also known as Game Raccoon. I post up my art there on a regular basis, talk about gaming of the TTRPG and video varieties, and generally try my dangdest to make at least one corner of Twitter a warm, welcoming, inclusive space. And be sure to keep your eyes out for&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, which I also contributed to, coming April 2022!</p>

              <h3>Amber Stewart</h3>
              <p><em>Barghest’s Bin</em><br>
                Hey there! I’m Amber Stewart (previously writing as Todd Stewart) and I’m delighted to have written the Barghest’s Bin for&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens The Grand Bazaar</em>, combining just the right amount of quirky charm with some darker plot hooks. I swear, I write more than planar content, even if I’ve done tons of it over the years! I do love it so very much, but my work on this book let me branch out a bit more from my last several planes-themed projects, but I still couldn’t resist adding in a plot hook with the meladaemon, Inusalia the Lady of Wasting Intoxication, in Omira’s back story, to say nothing of the petrified barghest presently used as a display model for bric-a-brac in the Bin. If you like my content, I’ve got a Patreon at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/KingOfTheCrosstrade">https://www.patreon.com/KingOfTheCrosstrade</a>, and if you want to follow me, you can find me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealShemeska">@TheRealShemeska</a>&nbsp;where I talk about gaming, share quotes from my home game, post stuff about my cats, and ramble about science.</p>

              <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3>
              <p><em>Resplendent Rose, Armor and Shield Adjustments, Weapons</em><br>
                Hello, readers! I’m Isabelle Thorne, long-time contributor (five years already!) and proud trans girl. ^_^</p>
              <p>For the Grand Bazaar, I brought to life the Resplendent Rose and its proprietor, Ralliadra. Like so many of my NPCs, she is also trans and Shelynite, and I’m incredibly happy with how she (and her music shop) turned out! Mechanically, I produced the new armor and shield adjustments, as well as the new (and, in many cases, returning) base weapons. Both of these elements build on content I produced or revised for Adventurer’s Armory 2 back when I was just starting out, and I tried to include other fan-favorites, such as a certain beloved elven weapon. I hope you enjoy my contributions!</p>
              <p>I’m always working on new gaming content, both for Paizo and for my own Patreon, and perhaps someday for Infinite as well. I’m working on fiction, too, and will hopefully have something to show off soon! I also offer my services as an editor and developer for hire.</p>
              <p>You can contact me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kalindlara@gmail.com">kalindlara@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;(work-related matters only, please!), sign up for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/ThornyRoseGaming">my Patreon</a>&nbsp;to get exclusive content, or follow me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ThornyRoseGames">Twitter</a>!</p>

              <h3>Jason Tondro</h3>
              <p><em>Lost &amp; Found, Structures</em><br>
                Writing for Grand Bazaar was a delight, and I picked topics that left me a lot of room to be creative: Lost &amp; Found seemed like the kind of shop that could have pretty much anything in it, and my other topic—magical structures—is unique to P2, with a lot of what we like to call “design space.” I could have written twice as much on both topics, if we’d had the room! If you’re looking for more of my work, I’ll be developing Starfinder and Pathfinder Adventure Paths here at Paizo for as long as they let me. You can also find me online&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/doctorcomics">@doctorcomics</a>&nbsp;(Twitter) or on the BAMF Podcast (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BAMFPodcast">https://www.youtube.com/c/BAMFPodcast</a>&nbsp;or your favorite podcast app) where I do a deep dive on the adventures I have developed, unpacking the entire process from pitch to post-publication.</p>
