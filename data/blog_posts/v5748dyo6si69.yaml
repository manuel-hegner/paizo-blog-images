  \ have what it takes to become the next First Seeker of the Starfinder Society?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Three years ago, First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo fulfilled her mandate as\
  \ head of the Starfinder Society and announced her retirement. Four prominent Starfinders\
  \ stepped forward to vie for the mantle of First Seeker. Each candidate was based\
  \ on the character of real-world players who had purchased the “Rising Star” boon.\
  \ These candidates were featured in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-07: Four for the First</em></a>. Starfinder\
  \ Society players from around the world cast their votes and elected Ehu Hadif Ko’\
  ra Amares of Clan Tolar as our First Seeker.</p> \n      <br> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <p>In many ways, Ehu is the quintessential Starfinder. He\
  \ recentered the Starfinder Society around themes of exploration and research, and\
  \ broadened our horizons in Near Space and the Vast. When faced with trials and\
  \ tragedies, Ehu has held the Starfinder Society together, ushering us through the\
  \ Data Scourge digital attacks, the devastating Drift Crisis, and inner turmoil.\
  \ The future has more excitement in store for Ehu Hadif but, much like Luwazi Elsebo,\
  \ Ehu has fulfilled his mandate as First Seeker. With the culmination of the (currently\
  \ unannounced) Season Six of the Starfinder Society, Ehu will be stepping down as\
  \ First Seeker and a new crop of Starfinder Society agents will step forward as\
  \ candidates to take his place.</p> \n      <p>It is therefore my honor to announce\
  \ the release of a new boon: <b>First Seeker Candidate</b>. This boon is available\
  \ for purchase to Starfinder Society characters with at least 45 Reputation with\
  \ any faction. When you purchase this boon, you’ll be directed to send us an email\
  \ with specific information about your character. This boon is only available for\
  \ a limited time, during the lead up to Ehu Hadif’s retirement. Your last day to\
  \ submit your entry for consideration is January 16th, 2023.</p> \n      <p>If you’\
  re one of the players who qualified and submitted your character for consideration\
  \ after Ehu’s election using the “Rising Star” or “Starfinder of Note” boons, rest\
  \ assured that we still have your character’s application, and they’ll be entered\
  \ into consideration alongside all our new candidates! If you would like to update\
  \ any previous submissions, please email us at organizedplay@paizo.com with any\
  \ new information, including your character’s goal as First Seeker.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The Starfinder Society is a living campaign influenced and shaped by players\
  \ all over the world. This is a tradition I’m proud to uphold. To all of our fans,\
  \ players, volunteers, and GMs: thank you for your continued support and engagement.\
  \ I look forward to embarking on this exciting journey with all of you!</p> \n \
  \     <p>And to all of our First Seeker candidates: I wish you the best of luck!</p>\
