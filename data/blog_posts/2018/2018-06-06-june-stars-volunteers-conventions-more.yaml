               <p itemprop="description">When we got back from PaizoCon, I asked the team to write blurbs about the highlights of PaizoCon. Unfortunately, Linda failed her will save and wasn't in the office when I asked, so we will have to include her perspective in a different blog. For me, my favorite part of the event is interacting with all the players and volunteers. No matter how many long hours go into planning and preparing for a convention, seeing attendee's enjoyment makes it all worthwhile. But my collegues are more eloquent in their summaries, so I turn the blog over to them.</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>This was my seventh PaizoCon and sixth as an employee (goodness), filled with all sorts of great moments. Friday morning opened with the traditional round of Golarionender, a Pathfinder-inspired reimagination of Mythender RPG. The PCs successfully Ended Aroden, but in the process a new deity of avarice rose from the smoldering ashes of the Isle of Kortos. We counted it as a win!</p>
                <p>We also debuted a series of four Pathfinder Playtest quests called The Rose Street Revenge. I ran one set of it, and several of my colleagues ran their own renditions over the course of the weekend. The story ran pretty smoothly, and I look forward to having it as a demo starting at Origins 2018 and beyond. My players for both this and the PaizoCon delve were lovely, including one player (a familiar face and recent freelancer) who took it well when I had to end one delve a little early in order to make it to a panel—in the process clobbering his character Seelah and then continuing to attack the collapsed PC to "show off how the dying rules work."</p>
                <p>Trivia went beautifully, even with the heckling of a growing table of Paizo employees, freelancers, and honored observers who survived the ballroom bar's extraordinarily potent tequila-soaked pineapples. The winners were Tonya's Tots (briefly Tonya's Orphans when she had to leave and then later Tonya's Champions). You can find Painlord's transcription of the trivia questions on the <a href="/threads/rzs2v5t3&amp;page=4?2018-PFS-PaizoCon-Bloggery-with-Pathfinder#154">PFS Bloggery</a> thread.</p>
                <p>On Sunday night I gathered a group of Utter Jackals for <a href="/products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899C-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99C: The Solstice Scar</em></a>, which went pretty smoothly. Although we had lost a few members of our team from last year, we easily recruited a few more to give our GM Andrew Geels a bit of a scare. We may not have completed a lot of encounters, but our primary goals—sassing each other, howling like maenads, and not getting kicked out by Tonya—were a success. I learned from some of the Tier 10-11 tables that there's one encounter in particular that needs some tweaking, so keep an eye out on the product page for an update.</p>
                <p>My best experience all weekend, though, was easily the pick-up game of <a href="/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</em></a> that I ran on Friday night. Normally PaizoCon's Friday evening is my opportunity to play at a random table, but I learned in the afternoon that the slot was sold out but might have an unused table. Figuring my only way to be in a game would be to run one, I pulled together a few folks as players (Lyz Liddell, Thurston Hillman, and Jenny Jarzabski) and then left the other three slots open to accommodate walk-ups. We got three buddies wanting to play together (Jeff, Brad, and Paul), and none of them had ever played Starfinder Society before. It turned out beautifully with five of the table playing 4th-level Obozaya (a large set of siblings) and the other playing 4th-level "O-bo-Raia." Our newcomers jumped into the game and the weird party composition almost immediately, and the Raia player was an absolute saint in putting up with the vesks' shenanigans. Apparently we were audible across the busy ballroom every time we put out hands in the middle of the table and shouted "O-BO-ZAYA!" as if hyping ourselves before a sports match.</p>
                <p>I'm partway through a lengthy summary for the <a href="/threads/rzs2v5t3?2018-PFS-PaizoCon-Bloggery-with-Pathfinder">2018 PFS PaizoCon Bloggery</a> thread, where you'll be able to find many of the frightful details. Again, heartfelt kudos to those three strangers who helped make the game so amazing.</p>

               <p>Despite the conventions' best attempts to take him out, Michael managed to overcome all adversity and emerge from the experience victorious:</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>This was my first PaizoCon as an employee and oh my goodness, what an adventure! Several adventures, really. I got to meet PFS officers and agents from around the country and beyond Thursday night to kick off the convention. Friday was an opportunity to stuff swag bags for the attendees, run and assist with the Pathfinder Playtest delve, and join the master of monsters Adam Daigle and special guest Taylor Fischer for a Concepting Monsters panel, and that evening I ran my lottery game, Broken Lattice, for an amazing group of players who slew vrocks, rode half-celestial unicorns, and slew a qlippoth in its home on a magma-ridden level of the Abyss. Saturday was fairly similar, but I had more opportunities to hang out in the PFS room and chat with some of the players who had traveled from all over to be there, which was fantastic. Unfortunately, I was struck down with some as-yet-undiagnosed-but-probably-food-related illness that left me out of commission for most of Sunday, but I did manage to climb my way to the Cascade rooms for my second and final lottery game. Despite my being under the weather, everyone was game to tackle the adventure and I once more had an excellent time taking some fantastic players on a tour of the planar causeways.</p>
                <p>To sum up, I had an amazing time, ran a delve, participated on a panel, played games with awesome people from around the world, and was then devastated by wracking illness. I'm told that this means I had a pretty standard PaizoCon, so hopefully I'll get to do <em>most</em> of this again next year!</p>

               <h2>Campaign Coin</h2>
               <p>Traveling around the world allows me to meet and interact with lots of our players and volunteers. It also means I hear lots of stories about fantastic members of our community who give of their time and labors to plan organized play activities in their areas. It is my pleasure to recognize some of these society stalwarts! The first three were given at PaizoCon the last weekend of May. I announced the other two at UK Games Expo, but we are withholding their names until their RVCs can deliver the coins and make the announcements. Once that is done, I will reveal them here.</p>

               <h2>Stars and Novas</h2>
               <p>With convention season underway, the opportunities for GMing abound and the ranks of 5-star GMs grows. Huge congratulations to all those that achieved their fifth star over the past month!</p>
               <p>To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

               <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
               <p>We still have badges and rooms available for Gen Con volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering to run Pathifner Socity or Starfinder Society events, please visit the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/pxUyPSyeIK9dfwbl2" target="_blank"><u>Gen Con 2018 volunteer questionnaire</u></a> for more information and to register.</p>
               <h2>Gen Con Event Update</h2>
               <p>I submitted the last of the games and all the seminars for Gen Con and they should post soon. We also pulled the ticket sales data and I'm working with Bob Jonquet to figure out if we can add more tables to any of the events. If you tried to get into a game and found it sold out, please check back next week to see if more seats are available.</p>
               <h2>Conventions</h2>
               <p>Want to attend a convention this summer? Check out the list below! I've updated the list with all the event support requests I've received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>
