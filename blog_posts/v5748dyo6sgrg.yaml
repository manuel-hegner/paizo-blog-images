  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Making a character in Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition is a process that most experienced gamers will find familiar, but\
  \ wherever possible, we made changes to make the process more intuitive while still\
  \ giving you a mountain of choices and flexibility. It all starts with imagining\
  \ the character you want to play. Maybe you want to be a ferocious dwarven warrior\
  \ who takes on the aspects of an animal in the heat of battle. Maybe you want to\
  \ play a wise-cracking elven con artist who grew up on the streets, but now plays\
  \ at being a member of high society. Or maybe you just want to make a mysterious\
  \ wizard that loves to blow things up. Pathfinder gives you all the tools to make\
  \ these characters and countless more! Even if you don't have a complete concept\
  \ in mind, the steps of character creation in Pathfinder are there to help you make\
  \ the big decisions and focus in on a character that you are excited to play. </p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Learning your ABCs</h2> \n     <p> With a concept in mind (no matter\
  \ how fully formed), the next step is to make the major decisions about your character.\
  \ We call these decisions your ABCs because you need to decide on your character's\
  \ Ancestry, Background, and Class. By making these big choices, along with any additional\
  \ decisions that come with each, the character you want to play will take shape!\
  \ </p> \n     <p> Think of these choices as deciding the major moments in your character's\
  \ youth. First off you were born, the details of which are decided by your Ancestry.\
  \ Next up is your youth, which is molded by your Background. Finally, your Class\
  \ decides the life you have chosen to live as an adventurer. Along each step of\
  \ the way, you will make additional decisions that reinforce and shape the image\
  \ of your character. Chief among these are your ability scores. Each step of your\
  \ ABCs impacts your ability scores, giving boosts and flaws to these six vital stats,\
  \ changing your raw potential to accomplish tasks and overcome danger. </p> \n \
  \    <h2>Details and Polish</h2> \n     <p>Throughout the character creation process,\
  \ you must record a variety of details about your character. Many of these are simple\
  \ proficiency upgrades, noting your character's aptitude at performing specific\
  \ tasks or resisting effects. Others require you to select from a list of options,\
  \ like your ancestry's heritage or a feat from your class. Every single choice you\
  \ make influences what you can accomplish during play, making you different from\
  \ the others around you. Even if some of the big choices are the same, these smaller\
  \ decisions can make two clerics, for example, play entirely differently. One might\
  \ be a virtuous warrior priest, fighting for her deity with blade and shield, while\
  \ the other is a pious adherent, using spells and sermons to preach a peaceful path.</p>\
  \ \n     <p> Once all of the choices have been made, it's time to buy your starting\
  \ gear and begin filling out all of your statistics. Starting heroes have precious\
  \ few gold pieces to start with and buying the right gear can mean the difference\
  \ between a glorious career and a forgotten grave. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ version of one of my First Edition Pathfinder Society characters, named Iakhovas.<br><br>\
  \ </span> <br style=\"clear: all;\"> </p> \n     <h2>Step 1: Create a Concept</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>What sort of hero do you want to play? The answer to this question might\
  \ be as simple as \"a brave warrior,\" or as complicated as \"the child of elven\
  \ wanderers, but raised in a city dominated by humans and devoted to Sarenrae, goddess\
  \ of the sun.\" Consider your character's personality, sketch out a few details\
  \ about their past, and think about how and why they adventure. Many character concepts\
  \ center around the character's class, their ancestry, or both, so it might be a\
  \ good idea to flip through the available ancestries and classes to help inspire\
  \ you. The Core Rulebook includes a helpful spread with a quick summary of each.\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Your character's concept might also center around their\
  \ background, personal identity, deity, relationship to the other characters, or\
  \ anything else you can imagine!</p> \n     <p> <span style=\"border-top: 1px solid\
  \ #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px;\

  \ Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\"\
  >Iakhovas: Concept</span><br> My concept for Iakhovas was a defense-focused master\
  \ of all martial techniques, skilled and willing to protect and train others, shaped\
  \ by the death of his sister and his revenge against the vampire Talia Nightcrescent,\
  \ whose staking makes him a wanted murderer in the undead-dominated nation of Geb.\
  \ This concept means Iakhovas is a Garundi human, probably either a fighter or a\
  \ monk. </span> <br style=\"clear: all;\"> </p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step 2: Start\
  \ Building Ability Scores</h2> \n     <p>Start all ability scores at 10 in preparation\
  \ for the later steps. This is a good time to start thinking about what ability\
  \ scores will be important for your character. You can even jot down your ability\
  \ scores as you adjust them on your character sheet. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n     <p>Above you'll see a character sheet with numbered indicators to show\
  \ you where you need to write something in each numbered step.</p> \n     <p> <span\
  \ style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px;\

  \ Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\"\
  >Iakhovas: Ability Scores</span><br> I start all of Iakhovas's ability scores at\
  \ 10. Thinking about the way I see him fighting, I think he's likely to fight with\
  \ a combination of strength and grace in order to be a master of all martial techniques,\
  \ so I'm likely to prioritize Dexterity and Strength. I see him as being wise and\
  \ fit as well, so if I get a chance, I might want to raise Constitution or Wisdom.</span>\
  \ <br style=\"clear: all;\"> </p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step 3: Select an Ancestry</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Select an ancestry for your character. Ancestry determines your character's\
  \ size, Speed, and languages, and contributes to their Hit Points. Each also grants\
  \ ability boosts and ability flaws to represent the ancestry's basic capabilities.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You'll make four decisions when you select your character's ancestry:\
  \ </p>\n     <ul> \n      <li>Pick the ancestry itself.</li> \n      <li>Assign\
  \ any free ability boosts and decide if you are taking any voluntary flaws.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Select a heritage from those available within that ancestry, further\
  \ defining the traits your character was born with.</li> \n      <li>Choose an ancestry\
  \ feat, representing an ability your hero learned at an early age. </li> \n    \
  \ </ul> \n     <p></p> \n     <p> <span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff; position:\
  \ relative; top: 10px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom: 200px; color: #000; text-decoration:\
  \ none; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; padding: 5px 10px;\
  \ margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block;\
  \ position: relative;\"> <span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px;\
  \ font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\">Iakhovas: Ancestry</span><br> Since I selected\
  \ human for Iakhovas's ancestry, he is Medium size, has a 25-foot Speed, speaks\
  \ Common and Osiriani to start, and begins with 8 Hit Points from his ancestry.\
  \ <br><br> Both of his ability boosts are free, so I assign them to Strength and\
  \ Dexterity, the two I decided were most important to him in Step 2. This brings\
  \ him to 12 Strength and Dexterity. I don't see Iakhovas as being particularly unintelligent\
  \ or uncharismatic, and I said I wanted to try to raise the other four ability scores,\
  \ so I won't be taking any voluntary flaws.<br><br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-skilledheritage.jpg\"\
  \ align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 10px;\" alt=\"Skilled Heritage: Your ingenuity\
  \ allows you to train in a wide variety of skills. You become trained in one skill\
  \ of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in the chosen skill.\">For\
  \ Iakhovas's heritage, I have some great options. Mechanically, the half-elf and\
  \ half-orc heritages bring a lot to the table, with better vision and access to\
  \ some excellent new feats, but conceptually, I pictured Iakhovas as a standard\
  \ human. I eventually choose the skilled heritage, since that will help me fulfill\
  \ my concept of being skilled a little better, even if I can't invest as much in\
  \ Intelligence. Since I want him to be a master of all martial techniques, I choose\
  \ Athletics as his trained skill from his heritage.<br><br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-naturalambition.jpg\"\
  \ align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 10px;\" alt=\"Natural Ambition, Feat 1.\
  \ Human. You were raised to be ambitious and always reach for the stars, leading\
  \ you to progress quickly in your chosen field. You gain a 1st-level class feat\
  \ for your class. You must meet the prerequisites, but you can select the feat later\
  \ in the character creation process in order to determine which prerequisites you\
  \ meet.\">Finally, I choose an ancestry feat. Haughty Obstinancy has a nice benefit\
  \ against vampiric domination, but it doesn't really fit his personality. Natural\
  \ Skill would give him yet more skills, and Cooperative Nature would grant him an\
  \ incredible +4 circumstance bonus to Aiding his allies, both of which fit his concept,\
  \ but eventually I decide to take Natural Ambition, which will grant him another\
  \ class feat and help him be a master of all martial techniques. I can wait and\
  \ choose the class feat later on, as Natural Ambition mentions.<br><br> </span>\
  \ </p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step 4: Pick a Background</h2> \n     <p>Your character's\
  \ background might represent their upbringing, an aptitude they've been honing since\
  \ their youth, or another aspect of their life before they became an adventurer.\
  \ They typically provide two ability boosts (one that can be applied to either of\
  \ two specific ability scores, and one that is free), training in a specific skill,\
  \ training in a Lore skill, and a specific skill feat.</p> \n     <p> <span style=\"\

  >Iakhovas: Background</span><br> Iakhovas's background is one of the parts of him\
  \ that is most difficult to quantify here. He and his sister were used for their\
  \ blood by a vampire—the sister of a Blood Lord of Geb—until the vampire overfed\
  \ and killed his sister, breaking him free of his domination and leading him to\
  \ stake the vampire while she slept. Then wanted for murder, he escaped Geb and\
  \ joined the Pathfinders, trading his loyalty for the promise of asylum. He is certainly\
  \ a criminal in Geb, and criminal is a background, but he hasn't really lived the\
  \ life of a criminal, so the mechanical elements wouldn't make much sense. Laborer\
  \ is normally a good choice for characters enslaved by evil creatures, but that\
  \ background is about a life of manual labor, and Iakhovas was kept around for his\
  \ blood. My other options are acolyte, acrobat, animal whisperer, artisan, artist,\
  \ barkeep, barrister, bounty hunter, charlatan, detective, emissary, entertainer,\
  \ farmhand, field medic, fortune teller, gambler, gladiator, guard, herbalist, hermit,\
  \ hunter, martial disciple, merchant, miner, noble, nomad, prisoner, sailor, scholar,\
  \ scout, street urchin, tinker, or warrior. <br><br> If I was using Lost Omens World\
  \ Guide, I would have the absolutely perfect background, \"Quick.\"<br> <img src=\"\
  https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-quick.jpg\" alt=\"Quick. Background.\
  \ Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge\
  \ of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also\
  \ required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of\
  \ swaying a stilled heart. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or\
  \ Constitution, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Deception\
  \ skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.\"><br><br>\
  \ As is, I still have a good choice with the core: I can focus not on who he was\
  \ in Geb but who he has become, and choose martial disciple, so that's what I do.<br>\
  \ <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-martialdisciple.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Martial Disciple. Background. You dedicated yourself to intense training\
  \ and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have\
  \ been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch\
  \ of a prestigious mercenary organization. Choose two ability boosts. One must be\
  \ to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in your\
  \ choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. You gain a skill feat: Cat Fall if\
  \ you chose Acrobatics or Quick Jump if you chose Athletics. You're also trained\
  \ in the Warfare Lore skill.\"><br><br> For my ability score, I can't go wrong since\
  \ it has my two favorite options! I take Strength and Dexterity both (They are both\
  \ now 14). I'm already trained in Athletics from my heritage, so I choose Acrobatics\
  \ for my skill, gaining the Cat Fall skill feat. Then I gain Warfare Lore automatically.\
  \ <br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-catfall.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Cat Fall. Feat 1. General. Skill. Prerequisites: trained in Acrobatics.\
  \ Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your falls. Treat falls as\
  \ 10 feet shorter. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter.\
  \ If you're a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary\
  \ in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless\
  \ of the distance of the fall.\"><br><br> <br style=\"clear: all;\"> </span> </p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step 5: Choose a Class</h2> \n     <p>At this point, you\
  \ need to decide your character's class. A class gives your character access to\
  \ a suite of heroic abilities, determines how effectively they fight, and governs\
  \ how easily they can shake off or avoid certain harmful effects. You don't need\
  \ to write down all of your character's class features yet. You simply need to know\
  \ which class you want to play, which determines the ability scores that will be\
  \ most important for your character.</p> \n     <p><span style=\"border-top: 1px\

  >Iakhovas: Class</span><br>OK, this is the moment of truth. I knew I was going to\
  \ build him as either a monk or a fighter, and now that I've followed him down this\
  \ journey, I'm thinking monk! It's okay, I'll take the fighter archetype later to\
  \ really mix up his martial techniques. At this point I'm just recording my key\
  \ ability score from monk. I get to pick Strength or Dexterity again—my two favorites—\
  but this time I'm forced to choose between them. After a little internal debate,\
  \ I decide on Strength, so Strength is now 16.</span></p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step\
  \ 6: Determine Ability Scores</h2> \n     <p>Now that you've made the main mechanical\
  \ choices about your character, it's time to finalize their ability scores. Do these\
  \ three things: </p>\n     <ul> \n      <li> First, make sure you've applied all\
  \ the ability boosts and ability flaws you've noted in previous steps (from your\
  \ ancestry, background, and class).</li> \n      <li>Then, apply four more ability\
  \ boosts to your character's ability scores, choosing a different ability score\
  \ for each and increasing that ability score by 2.</li> \n      <li>Finally, record\
  \ your starting ability scores and ability modifiers.</li> \n     </ul> Remember\
  \ that each ability boost adds 2 to the base score of 10, and each ability flaw\
  \ subtracts 2. You should have no ability score lower than 8 or higher than 18.\n\
  \     <p></p> \n     <p><span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff; position: relative;\

  \ font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\">Iakhovas: Ability Scores</span><br>After applying\
  \ the previous steps, I have Strength 16, Dexterity 14, and all the rest 10. For\
  \ my four additional boosts, I'll choose to boost Strength and Dexterity again,\
  \ and then Wisdom and Constitution, which I had been looking for a way to boost\
  \ but hadn't until now. This leaves me with Strength 18, Dexterity 16, Constitution\
  \ 12, Intelligence 10, Wisdom 12, Charisma 10.</span></p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step\
  \ 7: Record Class Details</h2> \n     <p>Now, record all the benefits and class\
  \ features that your character receives from the class you've chosen. While you've\
  \ already noted your key ability score, you'll want to be sure to record the following\
  \ class features. </p>\n     <ul> \n      <li>To determine your character's total\
  \ starting Hit Points, add together the number of Hit Points your character gains\
  \ from their ancestry and the number of Hit Points they gain from their class.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>The Initial Proficiencies section of your class entry indicates your\
  \ character's starting proficiency ranks in a number of areas. Choose which skills\
  \ your character is trained in and record those, along with the ones set by your\
  \ class. If your class would make you trained in a skill you're already trained\
  \ in (typically due to your background), you can select another skill to become\
  \ trained in.</li> \n      <li>See the class advancement table in your class entry\
  \ to learn the class features your character gains at 1st level—but remember, you\
  \ already chose an ancestry and background. Some class features require you to make\
  \ additional choices, such as selecting spells.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p></p>\

  \ Hit Points from his human ancestry, 10 from the monk class, and 1 from Constitution,\
  \ Iakhovas ends with a very respectable 19 HP. His initial proficiencies tell me\
  \ he is trained in Perception, has expert proficiency in all three saving throws,\
  \ is trained in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, is untrained in all armor but\
  \ has expert proficiency in unarmored defense, and has trained proficiency in monk\
  \ class DC. He's also trained in a number of skills equal to 4 plus his Intelligence\
  \ modifier, so four. Since he already has Acrobatics and Athletics, I decide his\
  \ other skills are Medicine since he would have needed to perform to bandage up\
  \ and handle lost blood, Stealth for sneaking around and escaping the notice of\
  \ the undead, Religion to represent his new faith in Pharasma (goddess of death)\
  \ and his knowledge of undead weaknesses, and Diplomacy to cover the way he likes\
  \ to instruct new recruits—in a friendly fashion rather than like a drill sergeant.<br><br>\
  \ The advancement table shows me he also gets powerful fist, the incredibly potent\
  \ Flurry of Blows action, and a monk feat of my choice! <br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-powerfulfist.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Powerful Fist. You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage\
  \ die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance\
  \ penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they\
  \ find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty\
  \ when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.\"><br><br>\
  \ <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-flurryofblows.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Flurry of Blows [one-action]. Flourish. Monk. Make two unarmed Strikes.\
  \ If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances\
  \ and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As\
  \ it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.\"><br><br>\
  \ Now it's time to choose my monk feat. And I get two feats, thanks to Natural Ambition.\
  \ As a master of all martial techniques, I definitely want Iakhovas to have a stance.\
  \ Looking through the options, there are a lot of very good choices. Dragon Stance\
  \ and Wolf Stance are both strong using the stats I have right now, but Mountain\

  \ alt=\"Dragon Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are\
  \ unarmored. You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like\
  \ a lashing dragon's tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal 1d10 bludgeoning\
  \ damage. They are in the brawling group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and\
  \ unarmed traits.\r\nWhile in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of\
  \ difficult terrain while Striding.\"><br><br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-mountainstance.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Mountain Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are\
  \ unarmored and touching the ground. You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—\
  a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight\
  \ of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks.\
  \ These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful,\
  \ nonlethal, and unarmed traits.\r\nWhile in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 status\
  \ bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or\
  \ Tripped. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning\
  \ you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5\
  \ feet.\"><br><br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-wolfstance.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Wolf Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are unarmored.\
  \ You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged\
  \ teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage;\
  \ are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal,\
  \ and unarmed traits.\r\nIf you’re flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your\
  \ wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait.\"><br><br> <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-kirushstrike.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Ki Rush. Focus 1. Uncommon. Monk. Transmutation. Casting [one-action]: verbal.\
  \ Accelerated by your ki, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times:\
  \ two Strides, two Steps, or one Stride and one Step (in either order). You gain\
  \ the concealed condition during this movement and until the start of your next\
  \ turn.  | Ki Strike. Focus 1. Uncommon. Monk. Transmutation. Casting [one-action]:\
  \ verbal. You focus your ki into magical attacks. Make an unarmed Strike or Flurry\
  \ of Blows (this doesn't change the limit on using only one flourish per turn).\
  \ You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls with the Strikes, and the Strikes\
  \ deal 1d6 extra damage. This damage can be any of the following types of your choice,\
  \ chosen each time you Strike: force, lawful (only if you're lawful), negative,\
  \ or positive. \"><br><br> Offense, or mobility? This would grant a great deal of\
  \ either when I needed them most, and as a monk, I could spend 10 minutes to meditate\
  \ and strive for inner peace in order to recover my Focus Points, letting me use\
  \ this in most battles as long as we rest between them. It's the closest call yet,\
  \ but I decide to go for ki strike. I'll be keeping an eye on the party's offense\
  \ vs. my ability to outpace my foes' movement and potentially retraining if I find\
  \ out ki rush would have been more useful. </span> </p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Step\
  \ 8: Buy Equipment</h2> \n     <p>At 1st level, your character has 15 gold pieces\
  \ (150 silver pieces) to spend on armor, weapons, and other basic equipment. Your\
  \ character's class lists the types of weapons and armor with which they are trained\
  \ (or better!). Their weapons determine how much damage they deal in combat, and\
  \ their armor influences their Armor Class; these calculations are covered in more\
  \ detail in Step 10. Don't forget essentials such as food and traveling gear!</p>\

  \ 9: Calculate Modifiers</h2> \n     <p>With most of the big decisions for your\
  \ character made, it's time to calculate the modifiers for your statistics. If your\
  \ proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your\
  \ bonus equals your character's level plus another number based on the rank (2,\

  \ \n     <p>At this point, you fill in all the details, including those to breathe\
  \ more life into your character's personality like alignment, deity, age, and gender\
  \ and pronouns, and those last mathematical details that weren't part of your modifiers\

  \ font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\">Iakhovas</span><br> As a devout Pharasmin\
  \ but a team player who is often selfless in pursuit of protecting others, I definitely\
  \ see Iakhovas as either neutral or neutral good. I decide on neutral good, and\
  \ we'll see if that shifts during play. He is in his late 20s, after an early youth\
  \ lost to vampiric domination. I decide to go with 28. His gender is male and he\
  \ uses he/him pronouns. His class DC, as we saw before, is trained, and it's based\
  \ on his Strength, so it would be 17 (10 + 4 from Strength + 1 from level + 2 for\
  \ being trained). He generally would start a session with 1 Hero Point. His AC would\
  \ be a solid 18 (10 + 3 from Dexterity + 1 from level + 4 from being an expert).\
  \ Finally, he is carrying 5 Bulk and 3 light (4 Bulk 2 light from the monk kit,\
  \ 1 more Bulk entirely of javelins, and then 1 light for holy water). He can carry\
  \ way more than this, so he can probably help other team members who might be having\
  \ trouble. </span> </p> \n     <br> \n     <p>And that's it! What character are\
