  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, December 31, 2007</p> \n    <p>Wow. Here we are\
  \ at the end of 2007—I don't know about you, but it kind of snuck up on me. Things\
  \ have been crazy busy here at Paizo over this last year, between the end of one\
  \ era of monthly product and the beginning of another. Launching <i><a href=\"/pathfinder\"\
  >Pathfinder</a></i> was great fun, but it was also a lot of work. Fortunately, Team\
  \ Pathfinder has just about recovered from the triple duty of working on magazines,\
  \ launching <i>Pathfinder</i>, and going to Gen Con—all just in time for our second\
  \ Adventure Path to begin!</p> \n    <p>There are a lot of \"Best of 2007\" lists\
  \ out there on the internet, and I suppose I could do something along the lines\
  \ of \"James's Favorite Moments of 2007\" here, but to tell the truth I'm more excited\
  \ about what we've got planned for 2008 in <i>Pathfinder</i>. We've got the contents\
  \ planned out to volume #18, and even though a lot of those adventures and articles\
  \ haven't yet been written (or even commissioned!), I do have a pretty good idea\
  \ of what's coming next year for <i>Pathfinder</i>. And after reading the following\
  \ list, you will too!</p> \n    <p>Listed here are 12 exciting things you can expect\
  \ to show up in the pages of <i><a href=\"/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a></i> over\
  \ the course of 2008. I'm only going to list one thing for each month, and as we\
  \ get further out, details are more and more likely to change, but at this point\
  \ they're pretty set in stone. Some of these details I might have mentioned on the\
  \ Tuesday night chats, while I'm pretty sure I mentioned a few others last week\
  \ at the book signing, and at least one of the following is something I haven't\
  \ talked about outside of Paizo yet at all.</p> \n    <p><b>January:</b> The <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7xpw\">Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path ends</a>\
  \ with a trip into the Kodar Mountains, and inevitable confrontations with abominable\
  \ snowmen, giant-sized giants, dragons, and worse, in the ancient ruined city of\
  \ Xin-Shalast, pictured here.</p> \n    <p><b>February:</b> <i>Pathfinder's</i>\
  \ second Adventure Path begins! <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7zdb\">Curse of the\
  \ Crimson Throne</a> is a much more urban campaign, filled with politics, plagues,\
  \ and peril above and below the streets of Korvosa, the largest city in all Varisia.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>March:</b> Our exploration of Golarion's deities continues with <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7zdf\">Abadar</a>, Master of the First Vault, written\
  \ by Sean K Reynolds.</p> \n    <p><b>April:</b> Want to know more about the rakshasas\
  \ of Golarion and find out what role they play in Curse of the Crimson Throne? Then\
  \ be sure not to miss the April <i><a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i6\">Pathfinder</a></i>!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>May:</b> There've been quite a lot of requests for more information\
  \ about the Shoanti—Varisia's tribes of barbaric nomads. Those questions will be\
  \ answered <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i7\">this month</a>, in \"The Shoanti\
  \ Way of Life.\"</p> \n    <p><b>June:</b> Check out your map of Varisia. Particularly,\
  \ that little note in the east that says \"To the Hold of Belkzen\" and has an arrow\
  \ pointing off the map. In <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i7\">June</a>, we reveal\
  \ where that little arrow is pointing. HINT: Belkzen involves orcs. LOTS of orcs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>July:</b> The final adventure in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i7\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne, \"Crown of Fangs,\"</a> appears in July, marking Adventure\
  \ Path master Tito Leati's first appearance in <i>Pathfinder</i>. I've looked at\
  \ his maps of Castle Korvosa, and all I can say is wow. Actually, I can say more,\
  \ but I'd better move on to August before I do.</p> \n    <p><b>August:</b> <i>Pathfinder's</i>\
  \ third Adventure Path begins! The <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i9\">Second\
  \ Darkness Adventure Path</a> answers the question of what Golarion's drow have\
  \ been up to, and starts out in the lawless city of Riddleport. Assuming I ever\
  \ finish writing this volume's adventure, that is…</p> \n    <p><b>September:</b>\
  \ Not everyone in Riddleport's out to rob you. A lot of the folk there just want\
  \ to have fun. Worshipers of Cayden Cailean would fit right in, which is why in\
  \ September we'll be exploring his faith in detail. Bring your tankards!</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>October:</b> There's something sinister afoot in the Mierani Forest in\
  \ western Varisia, particularly in the abandoned elven city of Celwynvian. Alas,\
  \ you'll have to wait until October to find out exactly what waits for your PCs\
  \ here!</p> \n    <p><b>November:</b> By now, you know that Second Darkness features\
  \ the drow as primary antagonists. And as logic dictates… that means the campaign\
  \ should eventually head down below. We still haven't quite settled on a name for\
  \ the vast reaches of caverns that riddle Golarion's underworld, but by November\
  \ we will. I hope. Because that's when we're running a Gazetteer of the regions\
  \ below that pertain to this month's adventure!</p> \n    <p><b>December:</b> This\
  \ MIGHT slip into January, depending on if we come up with a few different ideas,\
  \ but before Second Darkness comes to an end in early 2009, you can expect to see\
  \ a big, juicy article that talks about the demon lords of Golarion. They're who\
  \ the drow worship, after all! And one or two of them might just be trapped here\
  \ on the Material Plane with your characters…</p> \n    <p>So there you go! Something\
  \ (hopefully) to look forward to each month for the entirety of 2008. Of course,\
  \ the list above just scratches the surface of the adventures and supplementary\
  \ articles and monsters you'll discover in Pathfinder in 2008—the bestiary will\
  \ keep going strong, as will Eando Kline's adventures in the Pathfinder Journal.\
  \ Cayden Cailean and Abadar are only half of the deities we'll be examining in 2008,\
  \ and the drow are certainly not the only (or even the most dangerous) foes your\
  \ PCs will face in the deep below.</p> \n    <p> James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i>\
