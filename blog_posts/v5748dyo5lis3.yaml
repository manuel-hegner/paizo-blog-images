  \ Reclaim the Gauntlet!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, May 5, 2016</p> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Two years ago,\
  \ the brave forces of Paizo took the field of battle, fighting off skilled foes\
  \ sent by other game companies from around Seattle to claim the Gauntlet, a fabled\
  \ prize of glory and power. When the dust settled, we were victorious. The Gauntlet\
  \ was ours!</p> \n    <p>But such triumphs were not made to last...</p> \n    <p>Last\
  \ year, we once again took the field, raising money for charity, fending off an\
  \ even greater field of contenders. It was a day of hard fought battles and although\
  \ we fought valiantly, we were defeated. The team from the Removed From Play podcast\
  \ had cast us down into ruin. They took the Gauntlet from us.</p> \n    <p>Now,\
  \ the time has come once again. We go to do battle in less that two weeks and we\
  \ need your help to once again battle for the Gauntlet. You can help by <a href=\"\
  http://thegauntlet2016.causevox.com/team/Paizo\">donating to the Gauntlet charity\
  \ in the name of Paizo</a> (or by selecting one of the individual team members).\
  \ The more money we raise, the more \"power ups\" we will get during the event to\
  \ help us win! A lot of the other teams have gotten a bit of a head start on us\
  \ this year, but we are confident you will help to see us through. The team for\
  \ this year has seen some changes as well, adding fresh blood to our stable of champions.\
  \ While Erik Mona and I will be returning, we are happy to add Katina Davis (Customer\
  \ Service Representative) and Jason Keely (Editor) to the Gauntlet team.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Go and, <a href=\"http://thegauntlet2016.causevox.com/team/Paizo\">select\
  \ a team member and donate today</a>! Every little bit helps and it all goes to\
  \ support YouthCare, a great charity that helps homeless kids!</p> \n    <p>Last\
  \ year, we promised a short dungeon adventure as a reward for helping us with the\
  \ tournament and we have not forgotten about this commitment. Although our responsibilities\
  \ at Paizo have delayed us, I am happy to announce that the adventure is currently\
  \ going through editing and will be available for FREE in just a few weeks. Take\
  \ a look at the awesome map for this exciting adventure!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
