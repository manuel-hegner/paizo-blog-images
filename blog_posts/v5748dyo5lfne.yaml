  \ New Editorial Interns!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Saturday, December 28, 2013</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The\
  \ editorial team is excited to announce our two new interns, Austin Bridges and\
  \ Kate Sprague.</span></p> \n    <p>Here's Austin:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p>Greetings! Austin Bridges here, your brand new editorial intern for the winter.\
  \ I'm incredibly excited to join the team and get to know all of you, so allow me\
  \ to kick things off with a personal introduction. </p> \n     <p>I graduated from\
  \ Western Washington University in 2012 with a Theatre/Playwriting major and a minor\
  \ in German. After college I wrote for The Cheezburger Network's <i>The Daily What\
  \ Geek</i> news blog, and more recently spent the last year at Amazon working for\
  \ the Kindle Direct Publishing and Kindle Worlds platforms. Outside of work, I spend\
  \ my time reading comics, playing tabletop and PC games, going on podcast binges,\
  \ writing sketches, and listening to mashups with the theme music from Space Jam.\
  \ Currently, I'm crafting seasonal adult beverages and developing a radio play about\
  \ mermaids. In the near future, I'd like to move to Los Angeles to pursue television\
  \ writing. Or honestly just whoever will hire me to write.</p> \n     <p>I'm well\
  \ acquainted with other tabletop roleplaying games, but only recently discovered\
  \ Paizo and Pathfinder through the release of the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i>.\
  \ I got hooked pretty quickly, and now I'm happily crash-coursing all that Golarion\
  \ has to offer. Please be gentle! I'm just a sunken-eyed, bearded child scampering\
  \ around the Paizo office eating crusts, but I can't wait to get started and begin\
  \ currying your favor!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>And here's Kate:</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hello, my name is Kate Sprague. I am currently a student\
  \ at Bellevue College, studying Digital Media Arts. I'm particularly interested\
  \ in game design, and have pursued this internship due to my enduring love of tabletop\
  \ roleplaying games.</p> \n     <p>I started playing Pathfinder a little over two\
  \ years ago with a group at our local game store. Not long after that, my husband\
  \ and I found our way to a weekly Pathfinder Society meetup in Redmond. Our early\
  \ experiences with Pathfinder led us to assemble a weekly home game. Currently,\
  \ we are following the Kingmaker Adventure Path through the River Kingdoms.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My most played class is hands down the Druid. Currently, I have five\
  \ pathfinder society Druids. My favorite is Dr. Chrysanthemum Moonbeam; an elderly\
  \ aasimar practitioner of gnomeopathy whose day job is representing the â€˜Make a\
  \ Limited Wish Foundation.' Her animal companion, Tasha, is a sabertooth tiger who\
  \ unfortunately suffers from a terminal case of gigantism.</p> \n     <p>I'm looking\
  \ forward to contributing here at Paizo, and will work tirelessly towards making\
  \ the Druid class not only a good choice, but a mandatory one.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Austin and Kate will be helping us out for the next few months, so please\
  \ feel free to say hi to them on the messageboards!</p> \n    <p>Jessica Price<br>\
