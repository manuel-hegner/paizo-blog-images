  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Are you ready for our 40<sup>th</sup>\
  \ Paizo blog report across the past ten years?</p>\n      <p>Here it is, with the\
  \ newest release from our playthrough of <em>Sky King’s Tomb</em>! No two marathon\
  \ sessions are alike, and this one brought plenty of moments we won’t soon forget.\
  \ If you need to, go ahead and get caught up on where things are at:</p>\n     \
  \ <ul>\n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo70oix?The-Sky-Scions\"\
  >Introduction</a></li>\n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo70zbu?The-Sky-Scions-Part-1\"\
  >Part 1</a></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Marathon two had quite the roster around\
  \ the table. We were joined by Joe O’Brien from the <a href=\"https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/\"\
  >Glass Cannon Network</a> and Brandon Gillam of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Runehammer1\"\
  >Runehammer</a>, whom we placed side-by-side to maximize the roleplaying dynamic.\
  \ Each marathon of the project also features Order of the Amber Die members from\
  \ decades past, and for this second marathon we went back to the 1990s. John Albert\
  \ was the first bridge between two different chapters of Order of the Amber Die,\
  \ and it was John who helped the Order through its most challenging phase—more on\
  \ that below. In fact, John was also featured in one of our previous Pathfinder\
  \ projects, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhfu?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-2\"\
  >The Giantslayer Endeavor</a> of 2015. Once again, John flew in from North Dakota,\
  \ this time as a bearded dwarf and member of Clan Firecask for his Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition introduction!</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Adventure</strong>:\
  \ <em>Mantle of Gold</em></li>\n       <li><strong>Marathon Length</strong>: 61\
  \ hours, 15 minutes</li>\n       <li><strong>Session Hours</strong>: 38 hours, 40\
  \ minutes</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>This adventure took our family of dwarves\
  \ into the Darklands to recover the clan dagger of King Taargick, and we decked\
  \ out the studio for it. The black lights were fired up, and the floor was carpeted\
  \ with glow-in-the-dark balloons to represent the spores we kicked up as we waded\
  \ through some of the thickest fungi-filled caverns. Adam even surprised us with\
  \ neon confetti explosions when mushrooms went pop. If you want more detail of what\
  \ it was like at the table during this marathon, or you just want to confirm that\
  \ our GM does actually dance in glee when the Amber Die drops a natural 20, check\
  \ out Runehammer’s <a href=\"https://www.runehammer.online/post/amber-die-ii\">marathon\

  \      </div>\n      <p><strong>Highlights from <em>Mantle of Gold</em>:</strong></p>\n\
  \      <p>□ If a basilisk fought a mimic, who would win? We’re not telling until\
  \ after you place your bets in the comments below. We encountered a tribe of xulgath\
  \ that had fallen under the sway of a cunning mimic, but their newly captured basilisk\
  \ dethroned their “god” and generated plenty of jealousy to be exploited. Clan Firecask\
  \ happens to have one of the oldest bards on this side of Golarion; Renck is a venerable\
  \ dwarf of almost 400 years, and his age has boosted his charisma to epic renown.\
  \ Our bard can barely help us lift a keg, but by Torag can he convince you to do\
  \ almost anything. In the chaos created by diplomacy, we took out the xulgath while\
  \ the mimic and basilisk faced off!</p>\n      <p>□ We strode into the Clan Tolorr\
  \ family festival wearing some of the finest threads in Highhelm. We had to look\
  \ sharp because Tolorr knows how to throw a party: The procession of relics had\
  \ you uttering a prayer, the speeches were well rehearsed, and even the food was\
  \ matched to various periods of dwarven history. We came across some hustlers luring\
  \ would-be gamers into <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eh8?Pathfinder-Elemental-Stones\"\
  >Elemental Stones</a> for ante. We took the bait, and just like our last marathon,\
  \ used actual session time to play it out against our GM. Disa Firecask maximized\
  \ her Objective card and we walked away with free loot!&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>□ One\
  \ of the more interesting features of this adventure path is the way that traversing\
  \ the Darklands is handled. It’s very open-ended, which left our GM space to turn\
  \ our journey into a narrative that we appreciated more than random encounters.\
  \ This also meant that Adam spent hours watching caving disaster videos, which he\
  \ then turned into scenes for us to navigate with either die rolls or just plain\
  \ fear. If you are a dwarf of some sizeable girth, just don’t crawl anywhere. Ever.</p>\n\
  \      <p>□ This is a pretty historic blog report, so we’re going to do something\
  \ different and use a highlight to focus solely on an NPC. Krohan Veldollow of Clan\
  \ Tolorr was someone we doubted and distrusted. How could we forgive him for stealing\
  \ and losing the Sky King’s clan dagger? Yet Krohan had a compelling backstory,\
  \ and we were present during many scenes where his regret was owned and atoned for.\
  \ Even his song, “Used to the Darkness,” bonded us to his experience and made us\
  \ feel for his youthful but still dire mistakes. His character’s special ability,\
  \ Righthand Man, endeared Krohan not only to <em>Hamilton</em> fans but specifically\
  \ to any dwarf in the party, and we have an entirely dwarven party. As you read\
  \ on, the regret is now ours.</p>\n      <p>□ We met the Sky King, Taargick himself.\
  \ We’ll put down our mug of <em>Battle Axe </em>and say it again so you’ll believe\
  \ us. We met THE SKY KING. His ghost, at least. He directed us to find his secret\
  \ tomb, but more importantly, we can’t get our eyes off the relics that were awoken\
  \ by his presence! One or two relics would have already been blogworthy, but three?\
  \ We dubbed <em>Giantslayer</em> “the artifact AP,” and let’s now bestow “the relic\
  \ AP” on <em>Sky King’s Tomb</em>.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  \      </div>\n      <p><strong>The Scions</strong></p>\n      <p>Having John Albert\
  \ return to the table with us after so many years brought back a vital story in\
  \ our history, one that John passed down to our scions. In 1995, we went through\
  \ something that many gaming groups do not recover from: We were split by distance.\
  \ The original members who had grown up together in New Jersey were headed off to\
  \ college—largely scattered up and down the east coast—with our GM headed to Montana\
  \ State University. We barely had email, so contact was severed between Order members.\
  \ Adam took his dice (including the Amber Die itself), a couple of books, and an\
  \ adventure module with him. John and Adam met in the dorms, and the northwest chapter\
  \ of Order of the Amber Die was born. It was John who recruited new members and\
  \ embraced the legacy that our lifelong GM shared with him about the Order. We still\
  \ ran marathons when Adam was back in Jersey once a year, and the two chapters met\
  \ for the first time in 1998 at Gen Con. We didn’t just survive, we thrived during\
  \ “the Montana years,” and today Order of the Amber Die consists of members from\
  \ all over the world.</p>\n      <h3>Character Deaths:</h3>\n      <p>□ None from\
  \ Clan Firecask. Krohan, the exiled member of Clan Tolorr and a welcome companion,\
  \ fell during our struggle against a fearsome smith of Clan Molgrade. We are ashamed\
  \ to admit that we were forced to retreat, and left Krohan on the ground at dying\
  \ 2. We pray that Magrim did not keep you, friend.</p>\n      <h3>Best Quote from\
  \ Marathon 2:</h3>\n      <p>(encountering a hyphae tyrant)<br>\n        Yotis Firecask:\
  \ “It’s small, perhaps intelligent.”<br>\n        Salthrun Firecask: “Maybe we can\
  \ talk to it?”<br>\n        Renck Firecask: “It has sleeves. Anything with sleeves\
  \ you can talk to.”</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d1de6493-7fb7-4925-8537-64908fd4bcde/SkyScions_TheOvenForge.jpg\"\

  \ reassembled, and presented the clan dagger of King Taargick—only to hear that\
  \ he wanted us to find his tomb. We had no guide, but we were proudly bearing three\
  \ relics of the Sky King: a shard of his armor, his beard clasp, and his clan dagger<em>.</em>\
  \ We had also learned from some of the fierce combats in <em>Mantle of Gold</em>\
  \ that we’re better at making beer than we are at fighting. With that in mind, we\
  \ used an ingenious plan to secretly install a clockwork spy inside a thieves’ guild—\
  which provided us with enough audio evidence to free an innocent inmate from Highhelm’\
  s most notorious prison. With a debt of gratitude, a drathnelar named Jirelga is\
  \ our guide from here on out. Deep into the Darklands we go, toward a fey city known\
  \ as the Court of Ether…</p>\n      <h3>More Content:</h3>\n      <p>Our table was\
