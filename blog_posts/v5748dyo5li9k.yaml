  \ itemprop=\"description\">It's been a crazy week here at Paizo as we put the final\
  \ finishing touches on the <a href=\"/products/btpy9hj7\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue</em></a> hardcover before sending it to the printer. That coupled with\
  \ the fact that we're \"between sets\" and I don't have any digital sculpts to show\
  \ off for the next set yet OR photos of production figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, this week's Publisher Preview is going to be\
  \ a bit of an outlier.</p> \n    <p>First, I want to follow-up on some questions\
  \ resulting from <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li8l\">last week's preview blog</a>.\
  \ When listing the components of the frankly incredibly cool <a href=\"/products/btpy9ehn\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn Bar Case Incentive</em></a>, I mentioned that each set\
  \ would come with three (3) long barfront sections. Eagle-eyed readers noticed that\
  \ the accompanying photo, which used pieces from two case incentive sets to create\
  \ a cool diorama, actually had five (5) bar sections. So, how many straight barfront\
  \ sections are in the incentive? I've confirmed with WizKids that each will indeed\
  \ have THREE long barfronts, as I stated in last week's blog. So that, as they say,\
  \ is that.</p> \n    <p>Since I don't have any NEW minis to show you this week,\
  \ I did want to circle back and show off all of the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/singles/promos\"\
  >special limited edition promotional figures</a> we've released this year, all of\
  \ which are now available for purchase on paizo.com. These figures were given out\
  \ at conventions throughout 2015, and now that the convention season is over, we're\
  \ offering the remaining figures for sale here on the site. They make great stocking\
  \ stuffers for the gamers in your life. Because these figures are NOT available\
  \ in sets, even a lot of hardcore <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ collectors probably do not have them. Let's take a look!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9f5g\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71815-8-46-PR_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>From the moment I first saw the gold-hued Burning Brazier\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>, I knew we had\
  \ to order up a promotional repaint. I asked for this one in silver, figuring folks\
  \ would want numerous \"normal\" braziers offset by the rarer golden version, perhaps\
  \ as a special focus of a ritual or something. The standard <a href=\"/products/btpy9f5g\"\
  >Burning Brazier</a> is long sold out, but we've got plenty of <a href=\"/products/btpy9f5g\"\
  >the promotional version</a> available for all your holiday dungeon dressing needs.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9h8s\"><img src=\"\
  /image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOWZK2015-01_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This\
  \ sweet <a href=\"/products/btpy9h8s\">Red Dracolisk</a> was available free with\
  \ purchase at Paizo's Gen Con booth, and made subsequent appearances at other conventions\
  \ throughout the summer. I've always been taken aback by the quality of this sculpt,\
  \ and for my money the red version is even cooler than the standard <a href=\"/products/btpy9eni\"\
  >Dracolisk</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>. Encountered\
  \ alone or in a pack of several, this guy is sure to send shivers down the spines\
  \ of your player characters just as effectively as the Krampus. Plus he's red. You\
  \ know, for Christmas.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9h8t\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOWZK2015-02_360.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Until the <a href=\"/products/btpy9h8t\">Fire Beetle</a> hit paizo.com\
  \ a few weeks back, the only place to get it was by playing in one of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Specials</a> at Gen Con. One of my favorite\
  \ annual traditions is going from table to table in the immense Sagamore Ballroom\
  \ and handing out free minis to all of the event's 1000+ participants. We're so\
  \ honored that so many folks enjoy and play our game, and it's fun to give back\
  \ and personally thank everyone for their support. If you missed the event, don't\
  \ fear, we've got plenty in stock just in time for the holidays.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9h8u\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOWZK2015-03_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Another Gen Con debut, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9h8u\"\
  >Duergar Soldier</a> is a fantastic repaint of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9enn\"\
  >Dwarf Barbarian</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>.\
  \ He works great as a singular villain or as one of several duergar mooks. And \"\
  best\" of all, we spelled his name incorrectly on the base, so... collector's item!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We've also got several promotional figures for previous years still available,\
  \ such as the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ao4\">Lava Lurker</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9ao3\"\
  >Shadowfire Elemental</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9ao2\">Bloodbriar Goblin Raider</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96s9\">Hellfire Wisp</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy96s8\"\
  >Albino Wererat</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy96s7\">Slaver Demon</a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy96s6\">Goblin Raider</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy909o\">Reta's Bridesmaid</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy909n\">Konkrud</a> the goblin. Get 'em while we've\
  \ got 'em!</p> \n    <p>The Publisher Preview Blog (and all of Paizo, for that matter)\
  \ will be closed next Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Paizo.com, of course,\
  \ will still be open during that time, so while you're knocking off holiday gifts\
  \ for friends and family, please take a moment to check out our <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/sale/november2015/\"\
  >Pathfinder Accessories Sale</a>, which includes a lot of great deals on Pathfinder\
  \ Battles miniatures, like $20 off the suggested retail price for the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91sj\"><em>Red Dragon Evolution</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\"\
  ><em>White Dragon Evolution</em></a> boxed sets.</p> \n    <p>It's a Christmas miracle!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>See you in two weeks!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
