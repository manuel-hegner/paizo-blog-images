  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>—<a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljyb?Exploring-Factions-Favor\">the Year of Factions' Favor</a>—\
  is poised to deliver exciting stories to <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/rpg/factions\"\
  >the campaign's factions</a>. The organized play campaigns wouldn't be possible\
  \ without the efforts of our four-person team, so it makes sense that our faction\
  \ leaders would also appreciate advancing their respective goals with the help of\
  \ elite specialists. In fact, several factions already have such a setup, such as\
  \ how Tahonikepsu leads the Scarab Sages with the assistance of Amenopheus and how\
  \ Aaqir al'Hakam directs the Exchange with the help of Guaril Karela's rather underhanded\
  \ expertise. There are some big events in the works for the Liberty's Edge faction,\
  \ and we want to introduce someone who can play a part in upcoming events and share\
  \ in the spotlight.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0825E-Bonuwat.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0825E-Bonuwat_120.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>To this end, we've ordered art of this awesome person, illustrated\
  \ by Tom Ventre and modeled on the physical description of the Bonuwat people along\
  \ Garund's west coast. Just as we're looking to give Major Colson Maldris some help,\
  \ we're looking to you for assistance in introducing this new character. That's\
  \ right—we're hosting a contest.</p> \n     <p>Include a backstory of between 250\
  \ and 300 words that provides insight into the character and their motivations.\
  \ Submit your entry as email text (no attachments!) to pathfindersociety@paizo.com\
  \ (Subject: Leaders in Liberty Contest) along with your Pathfinder Society number.\
  \ Entries must be received by <b>August 30, 2017</b> for consideration for the contest.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>After the deadline, the Organized Play team (and maybe a few other staffers)\
  \ will narrow down the options and then post a new blog with our top choices for\
  \ the community to vote on. The winning story will define the character's canon.\
  \ The winning author will receive $20 paizo.com store credit and a custom avatar\
  \ on paizo.com. What's more, those who participate in the contest—either by submitting\
  \ an entry or participating in the voting process—will contribute to the Liberty's\
  \ Edge faction's goals for the upcoming Season 9 <a href=\"/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards\"\
  >Faction Journal Cards</a> update.</p> \n     <h2>Criteria</h2> \n     <ul>\n  \
  \    <li>The character's name must appear clearly in the backstory.</li> \n    \
  \  <li>The character must be sympathetic to the Liberty's Edge faction</li> \n \
  \     <li>The character does not need to be part of the Pathfinder Society organization,\
  \ but the character could be.</li> \n      <li>The character is not evil-aligned,\
  \ and the backstory should reflect this.</li> \n      <li>The character should not\
  \ have an extraordinarily tragic backstory. Both adventurers and the Liberty's Edge\
  \ faction tend to attract people who have suffered injustices and are amenable to\
  \ a little gritty heroism, and this character can certainly have survived misfortune.\
  \ However, please avoid having this character be the subject of a crushing catastrophe,\
  \ unbroken sequence of tragedies, or pattern of dehumanizing experiences. That's\
  \ just not the direction we want to take this person.</li> \n      <li>The character\
  \ should be capable. In game terms, we're looking at someone around level 5-10.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>You don't need to define the class or level of the character. In fact,\
  \ leaving a little flexibility on that front is appreciated (but not necessary)</li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <p>We look forward to reading your stories and making this next\
  \ part of the campaign your creation!</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
