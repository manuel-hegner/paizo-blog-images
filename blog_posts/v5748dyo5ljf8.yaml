  \ \n   <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>This is the fifth installment of our strategy\
  \ blog written by game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\">here</a>.</i></p> \n   <p>There\
  \ is a tendency to go to a location and then to grind through it until you've closed\
  \ the location. Don't give in to this! If there are reasons to move, then move.\
  \ You're not stuck at a location just because you went there. (Unless it's the Shimmerglens,\
  \ the Cell, or a similar location. Then you might be stuck!)</p> \n   <h2>Move to\
  \ a Location Based on Your Hand</h2> \n   <p>You might move to another location\
  \ based on what's in your hand—and specifically based on your desire to rapidly\
  \ cycle your hand. If Valeros has a handful of weapons or Kyra has a handful of\
  \ attack spells, then it makes sense for them to move to locations with more monsters\
  \ to kill, while a character with Thieves' Tools should move somewhere with barriers\
  \ (or to Junk Beach), while a character with a Crown of Charisma would do well to\
  \ move somewhere with allies (or to the Prison).</p> \n   <p>In short: If your hand\
  \ clogs, see if there are locations that would help unclog it.</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \ job for the tool.</i>\n   </div> \n   <h2>Move to a Location Based on the Deck's\
  \ Top Card</h2> \n   <p>Sometimes you might get to see the top card of a deck, thanks\
  \ to Harsk or Alahazra or courtesy of boons like Augury, Scrying, or even the humble\
  \ Spyglass. If this reveals a difficult bane or a valuable boon, and a specific\
  \ character can make quick work of it, send them there to face just that card.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>Corollary #1: Move to help with a check on the top card.</i> You might\
  \ move just to help someone else with the top card of a deck—either to take one\
  \ of the checks on a two-check bane, or to provide support against one of the wackier\
  \ villains like Erylium or Justice Ironbriar (who summon a monster that <i>someone</i>\
  \ must face) or the Skinsaw Man (who gets tougher if you face him all alone). Or\
  \ you could be a character like Valeros or Lem who can offer support with character\
  \ powers.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Erylium.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    <br> <i>Two swords are better than one.</i>\n   </div> \n   <h2>Move\
  \ to a Location Based on the Deck's Undefeated Banes</h2> \n   <p>Precognition isn't\
  \ the only way to learn what's in a deck. Sometimes you fight a bane that you just\
  \ don't have the right cards or attributes to defeat. This calls for an emergency\
  \ intervention from another party member. Sure, that newcomer will probably have\
  \ to grind through the deck to find the bane in question again, but it's still worth\
  \ sending Seoni to burn up the Troll or Lem to disable the traps, lest you have\
  \ to keep facing those banes again and again.</p> \n   <p><i>Corollary #1: Move\
  \ to a location to sort the deck if the undefeated banes are undefeatable.</i> Sometimes\
  \ you'll get really unlucky and face a bane that <i>no one</i> can deal with. This\
  \ is a problem for smaller parties that don't have every skill represented, but\
  \ it also is sometimes an issue when a flammable monster shows up and you don't\
  \ have any fiery spells or weapons. To solve this problem, send a character to the\
  \ location to sort the deck. The Augury and Scrying spells do this best, though\
  \ there are also a number of less efficient methods to get cards to the bottom of\
  \ the deck, or at least reshuffle them.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  ></a> \n    <br><i>Sometimes the way to win is not to fight.</i>\n   </div> \n \
  \  <h2>Move to a Location Based on the Number of Cards Left</h2> \n   <p>Abandoning\
  \ locations leaves decks with fewer cards in them. That's fine when you're bouncing\
  \ around early on, but later in the game it can become a missed opportunity. If\
  \ you're at a point in the game where permanently closing a location with just a\
  \ few cards in it would allow you to temporarily close all of the locations next\
  \ time you find the villain—or if you think a villain is in one of two decks, or\
  \ something similar—then it's worth moving to the smaller deck. A deck that has\
  \ 9 cards gives you an 11% chance of hitting the villain or henchman with each exploration,\
  \ while a deck with 5 cards ups that chance to 20%!</p> \n   <h2>Move to a Location\
  \ Based on the Characters That Are There</h2> \n   <p>Irrespective of what's in\
  \ a deck, you might move to a location because of who else is there.</p> \n   <p>Most\
  \ obviously, you might need to heal someone. Since the discard/heal cycle is a perfectly\
  \ viable method to keep your deck moving, healers should always be thinking about\
  \ where they can go to help other people out. This means that they should move early\
  \ and often.</p> \n   <p>Alternatively, you might move to give a player a boon.\
  \ This might be something you just picked up that can serve them better—but this\
  \ is of limited importance, because you can usually give them the card at the end\
  \ of the game. But sometimes you might be able to give them a boon that they really\
  \ need <i>right now</i>. Perhaps they don't have a weapon and you have extras. Perhaps\
  \ they could use Father Zantus more than you in this scenario. Perhaps they need\
  \ Thieves' Tools because they'll be exploring a barrier-heavy deck. There's a little\
  \ bit of reluctance in PACG to give up a card from your deck because it defines\
  \ your character… but as long as you remember to get it back at the end of the game,\
  \ all should be well.</p> \n   <p><i>Corollary #1: Beware of moving to a character\
  \ if the location is ill-fitting.</i> When you move to help out a character, you\
  \ don't want to waste your turn—you also want to explore the location if you can.\
  \ This means that you shouldn't go to a location if your character is a terrible\
  \ fit for it. If you're unable to close the location or if you're going to interact\
  \ badly with a location's special power, you don't want to go there. So the Mountain\
  \ Peak (where you can lose a card) or the Cell (where you can get stuck) are often\
  \ right out. (There's some wiggle room here. If you're bad—but not terrible—at closing\
  \ a location, and it's still got a lot of cards in its deck, then you might give\
  \ it a shot: You're unlikely to get to close the location in a single turn, and\
  \ if you do get the opportunity, maybe you can deal with it.)</p> \n   <h2>Move\
  \ to a Location Because You Have a Bonus Move</h2> \n   <p>Amiri gets a bonus move\
  \ at the end of her turn. Items like the Boots of Teleportation, allies like the\
  \ Celestial Unicorn, and spells like Teleport can duplicate this ability. This should\
  \ encourage a player to move for even the smallest reasons—to reduce the number\
  \ of characters at a location, to get away from a start-of-the-turn effect, or to\
  \ temporarily support another character.</p> \n   <p>If a character or boon can\
  \ move <i>other</i> characters too, then they should be even more willing to move—\
  not just if it would benefit them or the state of the game board, but also if it\
  \ would benefit the <i>other</i> character, for any of the reasons described herein.</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Move to a Location Because of Where the Villain Is</h2> \n   <p>Of course,\
  \ another reason to move is to find the villain—or to get away from the villain.\
  \ More on that next time.</p> \n   <p>Shannon Appelcline<br> <i>Game Historian</i></p>\
