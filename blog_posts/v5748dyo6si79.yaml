  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi! Those of you who have\
  \ been watching the credits of recent products or the discourse on social media\
  \ may have noticed some shake-ups in Paizo’s staff recently. </p> \n     <p>Over\
  \ the past couple of months, we’ve done some restructuring on the editorial team,\
  \ and we’ve also welcomed many new faces. This restructuring includes reorganizing\
  \ the designers, developers, and creative directors into three broad teams: the\
  \ Narrative Team, led by me (Linda); the Rules and Lore team, led by Michael Sayre;\
  \ and the Starfinder Team, led by Thurston Hillman. </p> \n     <p>Today, I’d like\
  \ to introduce you to the narrative team. The narrative team is responsible for\
  \ all Pathfinder adventures, including Adventure Paths, standalone Pathfinder Adventures,\
  \ and Pathfinder Society. The team also includes Starfinder Society due to its close\
  \ connections to Pathfinder Society through our Organized Play programs.</p> \n\
  \     <p>And without further ado, here’s who’s who in their own words, as well as\
  \ how to contact each of us.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/73ad7130-cb22-49a4-accd-6011268fac27/PZO9313_Butterflies_2000.png\"\

  \ \n     <p>Hi everyone! I’m Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer!\
  \ I’m thrilled to be in charge of planning, outlining, assigning, and developing\
  \ our Starfinder Society Scenarios, Starfinder Bounties, and our upcoming Starfinder\
  \ Society Specials. In addition to working at Paizo full-time, I’m a frequent freelance\
  \ author for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. Outside of writing, I love reading\
  \ and playing board games. I live in wonderful Winnipeg, Canada with my husband,\
  \ two kids, and pet rabbit. You can follow me on twitter @d20diaries. If you’re\
  \ interested in writing a Starfinder Bounty or Starfinder Society Scenario, reach\
  \ out to me at jessica.catalan@paizo.com.<br> </p> Take care, folks! \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>John Compton</h3> \n     <p>I’m John Compton, a senior developer currently\
  \ working on Pathfinder’s Adventure Paths. Previously, I’ve overseen various organized\
  \ play programs’ creative content and most recently co-led Starfinder’s hardcover\
  \ book production, and it’s great to be revisiting adventure design on the narrative\
  \ team (starting with the recently announced <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eao/discuss&amp;page=2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-193-Mantle-of-Gold\"\
  >Sky King’s Tomb</a> adventures). I love a good intrigue, heist, investigation,\
  \ or adventure sandbox, and I’m excited about the to-be-announced stories we have\
  \ in the works. While my assignments are few and far between, I’m always interested\
  \ in meeting and training up our game’s next authors. You can contact me at john.compton@paizo.com.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When I’m not playing or creating RPG content in the Seattle area, I’\
  m usually gardening, spoiling my friends’ various pets, socializing on Discord (I’\
  m in the Pathfinder RPG and Starfinder RPG servers), dissecting whatever narrative\
  \ media I consume, or learning eclectic trivia that then seeps into my professional\
  \ writing.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Josh Foster</h3> Greetings Pathfinders and\
  \ Starfinders! I’m Josh Foster, a Pathfinder Society Developer. I’m full of ideas\
  \ for short adventures and can’t wait to get them on the page. I’ll be the one outlining,\
  \ assigning, and developing new Pathfinder Quests—and I’m extremely excited that\
  \ Quests are coming back. I’ll also be working on non-metaplot scenarios for both\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder Societies (though mainly Pathfinder), as well as helping\
  \ the narrative team with the metaplot whenever they need my overly-caffeinated\
  \ input.\n     <p></p> \n     <p>I’ve been a mainstay of Pathfinder Society play\
  \ since way back toward the launch of the campaign. I’m a five-star GM, have helped\
  \ run the Pathfinder Society programs at several stores, and served as a Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ in Georgia. When not playing tabletop RPGs, I spend way too much time playing\
  \ Final Fantasy XIV. I’m now living in downtown Seattle with my amazing wife and\
  \ our adorable dog.</p> \n     <p>If you’re interested in writing a quest or scenario,\
  \ you can contact me at joshua.foster@paizo.com.<br> Good gaming everyone!</p> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <h3>Vanessa Hoskins</h3> \n     <p>I’m Vanessa Hoskins, a Developer\
  \ on the Narrative Team, and I get to assign talented freelancers to help shape\
  \ the stories we tell on Golarion (and beyond?). I’ll be outlining, assigning, and\
  \ developing long-form adventures and their backmatter. This includes Adventure\
  \ Paths and standalone adventures.</p> In addition to serving on the board of directors\
  \ at the Know Direction Network, I’m a cast member on the Adventurous! actual play.\
  \ I also co-author Vellum &amp; Lace, the first piece of serialized Pathfinder fiction\
  \ on Pathfinder Infinite, with Helen Savore. Finally, I recently started Ninja Cat\
  \ Games, an indie video game studio. I do all of this while living in Indiana with\
  \ my brilliant wife and our adorable dog.\n     <p></p> \n     <p>Twitter: <a href=\"\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>James Jacobs</h3> \n     <p>Ahoy! I’m James Jacobs, Creative\
  \ Director for the Pathfinder narrative team. I’ve been with Paizo for about a year\
  \ less than Paizo’s been a thing, and over the past 19 and a half years have worn\
  \ enough hats in the editorial department to make a whole family of ettins with\
  \ chimera pets proud! Going forward, my focus will be on guiding the stories for\
  \ all of the Pathfinder adventures Paizo will be producing, along with actually\
  \ developing adventures for both the standalone line and the Adventure Path line.\
  \ I’m hoping to be able to chat soon about some fun things we’ve got planned as\
  \ the Adventure Path nears its 200th volume, and some new and exciting stuff we’\
  ll be doing on the standalone adventure side. I’m also involved in other narrative-based\
  \ things you’ll see coming from Paizo or our partners when it comes to stories beyond\
  \ adventures.</p> \n     <p>As for myself? I’m from a small town, Point Arena, on\
  \ the remote coast of northern California, but for the past half of my life I’ve\
  \ been living up north in the Seattle hinterlands. (And yes, there’s a fair amount\
  \ about the town of Sandpoint that’s inspired from my hometown… although we do have\
  \ fewer goblins living there, especially since I moved up north!) I’m sort of a\
  \ social media recluse, but I’m pretty active here on our message boards, and have\
  \ started to de-lurk over on Reddit’s 2nd Edition Pathfinder page as well. Feel\
  \ free to drop me a message anytime in either place, or shoot me an email at james.jacobs@paizo.com.\
  \ I try to answer quickly, because who knows if I’ll get distracted chasing a bigfoot\
  \ or chupacabra or mothman ten minutes from now and… wait… WHAT’S THAT NOISE! <em>THAT\
  \ HAND AT THE WINDOW</em>……</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Shay Snow</h3> \n     <p>Hello,\
  \ friends! I’m Shay Snow, one of the new developers for Pathfinder Society! You’\
  ve probably seen my writing floating around, as I’ve been freelancing with Paizo\
  \ since 2020 and was previously a member of Paizo’s fantastic editing team since\
  \ October 2021!</p> \n     <p>While I’ve written two Starfinder Society scenarios,\
  \ I’m quite new to Organized Play. However, the Emerald City Lodge has been extremely\
  \ welcoming and willing to show me the ropes! I’ve enjoyed running and attending\
  \ games, and I love the chance to interact with Paizo fans on the ground and get\
  \ their opinions on the game and the Society. (Yes, you can tell me about your level\
  \ 12 champion of Shelyn! But in exchange you must listen to me talk about my level\
  \ 4 rogue!)</p> \n     <p>I’m from Watauga, Texas, a suburb between Dallas and Fort\
  \ Worth, and I moved to Washington in February of 2022. I’m Native American, mixed\
  \ Caddo and Swampy Cree. When not centered on tabletop games, I’m usually consuming\
  \ horror content and spending time with my spouse and two cats, Beans and Sweet\
  \ Corn. The best place to find me outside of my home office is on Twitter @spellsinsugar,\
  \ or you can email me at shay.snow@paizo.com!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Linda Zayas-Palmer</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi, I’m Linda Zayas-Palmer, the manager of the narrative team. My job\
  \ mostly involves logistical tasks like scheduling, training, and reviewing text\
  \ from developers.</p> \n     <p>I’ve been a fan of Paizo’s adventures since Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition came out. The story of Rise of the Runelords inspired my home group\
  \ to make the jump to Golarion, and Council of Thieves was my first-ever campaign\
  \ as a GM. As for Organized Play, after positive experiences with the community\
  \ at my first GenCon, I wound up joining the Boston Lodge as a player, GM, and eventually\
  \ Venture-Lieutenant. Paizo’s adventures and the community around them have brought\
  \ so much joy and togetherness to my life, and it’s a privilege to be part of the\
  \ team that brings those kinds of experiences to the world. </p> \n     <p>In addition\
  \ to my day job, I also do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder. Some\
  \ of my recent projects include the raxilite section of <em>Starfinder Interstellar\
  \ Species</em> and the final part of Roll for Combat’s Jewel of the Indigo Isles\
  \ Adventure Path. Every Tuesday at 7pm Pacific and Saturday at 10am Pacific, I stream\
  \ on Twitch together with former Paizo design manager Mark Seifter, under Arcane\
  \ Mark (twitch.tv/arcanemark). Outside of Paizo and its products, I enjoy reading,\
  \ math, teaching, solving puzzles, playing video games, watching anime, and singing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I don’t engage much with social media, but if you’d like to reach out\
  \ to me, you can email me at linda.zayas-palmer@paizo.com, or join Arcane Mark’\
  s discord server at tiny.cc/arcanemark.</p> \n     <br> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
