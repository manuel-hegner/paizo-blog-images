  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Around the Paizo office, we've been\
  \ really busy getting the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> out the door and launching the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljle?Starfinder-Society-Paizos-Newest-Organized\">Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild campaign</a>—but not so busy that we couldn't bring\
  \ you two great new adventures for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Perhaps two isn't quite the right number, as <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-816-House-of-Harmonious-Wisdom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-16: House of Harmonious Wisdom</em></a> is not\
  \ a quest but a series of five Tier 1-5 quests. Every quest pack is a new opportunity\
  \ and a new challenge—an opportunity to work with lots of new authors, and a challenge\
  \ to find just the right location on Golarion to present a new set of adventures.\
  \ This series presented even more opportunities because this is the first time we've\
  \ released a full series of quests mid-season, it's the first time we've presented\
  \ a full series of quests at multiple subtiers, and it's also the first series of\
  \ quests we've centered in Tian Xia. Fortunately, the authors Jason Owen, Black,\
  \ Katherine Cross, Sarah Hood, and Christopher Rowe all did admirably, creating\
  \ engaging characters and fun encounters that show off the conflict between the\
  \ three nations that each claims to be the rightful heir of the fallen Lung Wa empire:\
  \ Lingshen, Po Li, and Quain. In collaboration with the retired folk hero Mai Chun\
  \ (pictured here), the PCs must visit each of the three Successor States in search\
  \ of a famous Lung Wa relic—all while evading envious rivals (like the scholar pictured\
  \ here) who seek the same prize.</p> \n    <p>Because these mid-season quests with\
  \ multiple subtiers are an experiment in the season's structure, we're eager to\
  \ hear back from you about whether this is a something we should repeat in the future,\
  \ whether it was useful for your area, and how we can improve this format.</p> \n\

  \ in luck! We're also releasing <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-817-Refugees-of-the-Weary-Sky\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-17: Refugees of the Weary Sky</em></a>, a spiritual\
  \ sequel to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8g1v?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-209-The-Heresy-of-Man-Part-III-Beneath-Forgotten-Sands\"\
  >Heresy of Man trilogy</a> (though you don't need to have played the earlier adventure\
  \ to enjoy this one). In collaboration with its new allies on the elemental planes,\
  \ the Pathfinder Society has identified an ancient ruin dating back to the Jistka\
  \ Imperium. This same ruin is one of the last holdouts of the Imperium's elementalists\
  \ during its disastrous conflict with Osirion, and the echoes of that powerful magic\
  \ still pervade the site. Fortunately, helping get the PCs started (and illustrated\
  \ for the first time) is Venture-Captain Obo, the Society's steadfast liaison in\
  \ Rahadoum, assisted by the Sapphire Sage Amenopheus, who has taken a special interest\
  \ in the refuge of Osirion's ancient enemy. Don't miss this desert adventure by\
  \ Jeffery Swank!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\
