  \ itemprop=\"description\">Hello, gamers, and welcome back to RPG Superstar 2014!\
  \ I'm Sean K Reynolds, host of this year's RPG Superstar competition, designer at\
  \ Paizo, and a judge for the previous four RPG Superstar competitions.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>As of 2 PM Pacific time, the Open Call for Round 1 submissions is closed.\
  \ If you submitted a wondrous item, congratulations and thank you! If you didn't\
  \ submit a wondrous item, there's always next year!</p> \n     <p>Now it's time\
  \ for the public vote. Anyone with an account on Paizo.com can participate in the\
  \ Round 1 public vote. Just go to the voting page, sign in to your Paizo.com account,\
  \ and you'll be shown two wondrous items. Take a minute to read both items, then\
  \ vote on which of the two items you think is better. If you honestly can't decide\
  \ which item is better, there is a “both items are equal” option, but that actually\
  \ doesn't help sort items (it's a neutral result in the voting), so use that only\
  \ as a last resort.</p> \n     <p>If you see an item that you think breaks the rules\
  \ of the contest (such as being a copyright violation, such as an item from a novel\
  \ or movie), contact <a href=\"mailto:contest@paizo.com\">contest@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Once you've voted, the website will present you with another pair of\
  \ items to evaluate. You can vote as many times as you like.</p> \n     <p>You may\
  \ see your own item—and you're allowed to vote for it. You may see some items come\
  \ up more than once. As there are hundreds of items submitted to the contest, you\
  \ might vote many times and still not see all of the items. You might want to save\
  \ a copy of items you'd like to use in your game, or items you want to talk about\
  \ later.</p> \n     <p>Your participation in the voting process is use and critical\
  \ for the success of RPG Superstar. For the 2013 competition, over 500,000 votes\
  \ were cast by hundreds of voters. Just like we did last year, we'll be awarding\
  \ people who vote 100, 500, 1000, or 5000 times with custom message board titles\
  \ (Star Voter, Dedicated Voter, Marathon Voter, Champion Voter) as our thanks for\
  \ participating in the voting process.</p> \n     <p>Over time, these numerous votes\
  \ sort all the wondrous item submissions into a hierarchy. At the top of that hierarchy\
  \ are the items which got upvoted more often than any item they were paired with,\
  \ and at the bottom are the items which got downvoted more often than any item they\
  \ were paired with. (The Paizo tech team may cull the lowest-voted items partway\
  \ through the voting period so voters can focus on the evaluating the highest-voted\
  \ items.)</p> \n     <p>At the end of the public voting period (January 14, 2014),\
  \ our panel of judges will look over the highest-voted items and select the Top\
  \ 32. We announce the Top 32 on January 21, and the authors of those items proceed\
  \ to Round 2: Create a Bestiary Entry!</p> \n     <p>Good luck, competitors! And\
  \ thanks in advance, voters!</p> \n     <p style=\"font-size: 2.5em; font-weight:\
