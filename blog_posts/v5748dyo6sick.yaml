  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">We did it! “Pathfinder:\
  \ Abomination Vaults” is 100% funded on Kickstarter!</p> \n     <p>From everyone\
  \ at BKOM Studios, we are extremely thankful for your support. We couldn’t have\
  \ done this without you! Thanks to you, together we're gonna create something legendary.\
  \ We can’t wait to have you join us soon... down the Abomination Vaults!</p> \n\
  \     <p>For the occasion our CEO, Frederic Martin, wanted to say a few words:</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><em>Hello, Fred Martin here. I’m one of the founders\
  \ of BKOM Studios and have had the privilege of working alongside a really passionate\
  \ team of game smiths for the last 26 years and counting. I’m also a lifelong fan\
  \ of fantasy stories where elves, dwarves, goblins and sorcerers share the stage\
  \ as the main villains and heroes.</em></p> \n      <p><em>I felt like I had to\
  \ say thanks. Big thanks in fact. Huge thanks to you, the supporters of this project,\
  \ who have allowed us to reach this point in the campaign. Huge thanks to my colleagues,\
  \ who are working very hard on this initiative because they also believe in it.\
  \ And huge thanks to Paizo for entrusting us with such a precious IP and adventure\
  \ path.</em></p> \n      <p><em>All the good vibes you are sending are really fueling\
  \ our conviction that this game is going to become an awesome reality. The energy\
  \ behind your contribution is also encouraging others to join. And thanks to that,\
  \ we reached our goal and we are hopeful for the last week of the campaign. I didn’\
  t want to miss the opportunity to say thanks, on my behalf, and on behalf of the\
  \ incredible BKOM team.</em></p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\

  \ \n     <p>But it doesn’t end here, there’s still time to unlock some stretch goals!\
  \ The Potion-Crafting System with Nezrin Fizzletop's Alchemitorium has already been\
  \ unlocked! It allows adventurers to craft their own customized potion by mixing\
  \ and matching different ingredients found within the Vaults. Create potions for\
  \ healing, protection, self-strengthening, speed, or anything in-between!</p> \n\
  \     <p>The Wardrobe system and one alternate outfit have also been unlocked! Amelia\
  \ Candlebright can fix up her grandmother's tailoring shop in town and offer bespoke\
  \ tailoring and aesthetic options. Defeat enemies to collect rare dyes and fabrics\
  \ which can be used to swag out your hero. Because at the end of the day, we all\
  \ know adventure is really about: fashion!</p> \n     <p>We also revealed the Runesmithing\
  \ System &amp; Kargas' Runeforge! The runesmith Kargas Featherstone offers a quest\
  \ to retrieve ancient runes, which he can use to customize your weapons and armor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And there’s more to reveal yet. Who knows, maybe even a certain iconic\
  \ goblin alchemist!</p> \n     <p> There’s a few hours left in the campaign. Thanks\
  \ for sharing the page and continuing to make some noise: <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bkomstudios/pathfinder-abomination-vaults\"\
