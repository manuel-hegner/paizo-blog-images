  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hard to\
  \ believe it's Friday already, and time for another look at upcoming <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures!</p> \n    <p>This week we're\
  \ taking a peek at three figures from March's <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"><i>Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set #3</i></a>, a stand-alone release featuring six figures. Unlike many\
  \ of our <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> releases, Iconic\
  \ Heroes sets do not come randomly packed. The same six figures are in every box,\
  \ with a visible window to let you see what you're buying.</p> \n    <p>WizKids\
  \ has really outdone themselves with premium sculpting and paint masters for the\
  \ Iconic Heroes sets. The new digital sculpting process allows us to nitpick all\
  \ of the little details that make our iconic characters iconic, and WizKids is planning\
  \ to make the Iconic Heroes as beautiful as any figure we've ever done for the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line so far.</p> \n    <p>Another\
  \ difference is that each Iconic Heroes set will include six exclusive cards for\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>,\
  \ one for each character in the box. These cards can be used with any PACG campaign.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Let's take a look at some digital sculpts!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140923-Alahazra_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is a familiar face, as we previewed\
  \ her a couple of weeks ago in another blog. But in case you missed her, here's\
  \ Alhazra, Human Oracle, from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i></a>. The amount of detailing on Alhazra's stole will push the factory\
  \ to the limit, but I'm confident the final figure will look absolutely amazing!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Damiel.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Damiel_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up is the conniving Damiel, Elf Alchemist. We're\
  \ excited about the level of detail that will go into Damiel's equipment, complete\
  \ with clear potion bottles and a fully stocked alchemist kit/backpack. We see Damiel\
  \ winding up to throw an alchemical bomb. Watch out!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Alain.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Alain_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>My favorite for this week is Alain, Human Cavalier. His\
  \ banner ripples in the wind at the end of his lance as his cloak billows behind\
  \ him in dramatic fashion. Check out that banner and his tabard to see some of the\
  \ coolest and most detailed tampo stamps we've ever done for Pathfinder Battles.\
  \ Alain comes fully geared up and ready to kick ass, and I couldn't be happier with\
  \ how he turned out.</p> \n    <p>We're only a couple of weeks from the November\
  \ 19 release of the full <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>\
  \ 45-figure blind-boxed set. Now is a good time to make sure that you've preordered\
  \ or set up a <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Pathfinder Battles Ongoing Case Subscription</a>\
  \ to make sure you don't miss a single figure. The Lost Coast is one of my favorite\
  \ sets in a while, and its loose theme means it's packed with a ton of figures usable\
  \ in just about any campaign. We've also introduced new subscriber benefits with\
  \ this release (30% off Pathfinder Battles purchases across the board, 75% off the\
  \ limited-edition case incentive figure) that you'll definitely want to check out.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>See you next week for three more iconics!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
