  >Part 2</a>. As usual, there be spoilers! Read the following at your own risk!</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>By the third volume of an Adventure Path, we have\
  \ usually acquired a pretty definitive feel for the locale and some of the themes\
  \ of a particular AP. <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral\"\
  >The Flooded Cathedral</a></i> became the adventure where we really felt like we\
  \ were deep in the ruins of Azlant in the most literal sense. Remains of the empire\
  \ were everywhere, and we got to explore the most awe-inspiring structure yet: a\
  \ massive cathedral so time-worn that it was now partially lost to the waters. We\
  \ couldn't stop to gawk too long though, for we were in a race against time to recover\
  \ dozens of kidnapped colonists from the machinations of their new aboleth master!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>To enhance immersion, we decided to focus on the feel of submerged\
  \ dungeon crawling. Black curtains blocked out light from the room, with illumination\
  \ provided by lava lamps possessing underwater hues, and a strobe light was used\
  \ for the parts of the cathedral where the lighting was malfunctioning. Elsewhere\
  \ on the islands of Azlant, <a href=\"http://www.blackscrollsgames.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Black Scrolls Games</a> helped us bring the landscape to life with their\
  \ outdoor map tiles.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>Adventure: <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #123: The Flooded Cathedral</a></i></li> \n       <li>Marathon\
  \ Length: 107 hours, 15 minutes</li> \n       <li>Session Hours: 57 hours, 10 minutes</li>\
  \ \n      </ul> \n      <h2>Highlights from \"The Flooded Cathedral\"</h2> \n  \
  \    <ul> \n       <li>One of the most unsettling parts of adventuring in ancient\
  \ Azlant involved encountering former inhabitants of an age gone by. Wraiths known\
  \ as hollows—spirits whose pride kept them from fleeing Earthfall—inhabited an area\
  \ of the island where the trees and soil were left still blackened from the cataclysm.\
  \ They paced us for hours, until the darkness provided by some ruins allowed them\
  \ the chance to strike, hoping to sap our precious egos.</li> \n       <li>The treasures\
  \ of Azlant are as enticing as its lore, and we couldn't resist braving s a shiver\
  \ of great white sharks to explore the Hall of the Heroine, which contained a statue\
  \ of the Azlanti heroine Savith. In our very own sword-in-the-stone moment, only\
  \ a human had the strength to wrest the sword of Savith from her grasp, and this\
  \ glowing aberration-bane keen longsword became single greatest factor in our defeat\
  \ of Onthooth, the aboleth in the final encounter.</li> \n       <li>The outer temple\
  \ grounds contained a breathtaking 100-foot-tall statue of Amaznen that had crashed\
  \ to the ground long ago. Before our scholars could satiate the pages of their logs,\
  \ a tough fight began, possessed of wave-by-wave action against ugothol defenders.\
  \ What increased the complexity was the combination of three lanes of engagement,\
  \ and that each wave of faceless stalkers was armed differently, including the dreaded\
  \ mutilators, who hit the hardest. We won it decidedly, by making sure they couldn't\
  \ break our line: two of us held the left side on the smashed head of the statue,\
  \ two held the right amongst some crumbling walls, two scampered up onto the statue\
  \ itself, and the last provided air support in the form of lightning bolts.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Intensity peaked as high as the volume of Hans Zimmer's \"Supermarine\"\
  \ when we faced off against one of the first ulat-kini ever created. To take things\
  \ up another notch, we should add that we were we far from air, a retinue accompanied\
  \ it, and this immense creature carried an equally large <i>crossbow of the crab</i>.\
  \ Our GM shocked us a couple of times by using the reposition combat maneuver to\
  \ place us in the path of a malfunctioning electrical altar. This win went to Valeros's\
  \ aquanaut abilities and Ezren's <i>aqueous orb</i> spell.</li> \n      </ul> \n\

  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <h2>The Odyssey</h2> \n      <p>Author Mikko Kallio\
  \ gifted us with one of the most interactive and unique dungeon crawling experiences\
  \ we've ever come across. Not only did a submerged ruin provide its own challenges,\
  \ but also there were several objectives to be accomplished within the cathedral,\
  \ and these stood alongside our main goal. Aoinse, the awakened clockwork servant\
  \ and former cleric of Amaznen, became our friend and guide throughout the delve—\
  she won't be forgotten. True to any Odyssey, the treasures have been equally epic,\
  \ as it took more than thirty years of playing this game to finally come across\
  \ an <i>apparatus of the crab</i>!</p> \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n    \
  \  <ul> \n       <li>Merisiel paid for her curiosity when she approached a perfectly\
  \ intact table standing alone inside a broken tower. She'll tell you it was the\
  \ magical haversack resting upon the table that she couldn't resist. Karnax, the\
  \ mimic with slayer levels, showed his delight in having visitors to the island\
  \ by surprising the rogue, studying his target, and finishing her in two hits before\
  \ the party could act.</li> \n       <li>While attempting to turn the temple's power\
  \ generators on, we found ourselves in a fierce encounter with lightning elementals\
  \ where every square of movement mattered. Unfortunately, our party roster included\
  \ a locathah with a 10 foot movement, Kyra with a 20 foot movement, and a hobbled\
  \ clockwork companion in tow. Kyra sacrificed herself to help the rest escape, but\
  \ not before we lost Oorka the strix as well.</li> \n       <li>As we explored a\
  \ haunted sacristy, Valeros fell victim to a <i>murderous command</i> effect and\
  \ tried to claim the spoils for himself. It didn't help that the fighter was being\
  \ played by Erick, who has more blood on his hands from other PCs than anyone in\
  \ the Order. With a stellar critical hit of 73 points of damage, he added Koloshkora\
  \ to his list.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <h3>Best Quote From Marathon 3</h3> \n\
  \      <p>(<i>Following an encounter with chaos beasts, our wizard suffered from\
  \ a Wisdom score of 4.</i>)</p> \n      <p><b>Ezren:</b> Excellent hit Marissa,\
  \ watch out for the other elemental!</p> \n      <p><b>Merisiel:</b> It's Merisiel...</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Ezren:</b> Nice throw Melanie, behind you!</p> \n      <p><b>Merisiel\
  \ (<i>dodges</i>):</b> It's Merisiel, old man.</p> \n      <p><b>Ezren: </b>Sorry\
  \ Maria, I won't make that mistake again!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ defeat the aboleth and recover the colonists (mostly) intact. Through diplomacy\
  \ and action, our network of friends and alliances among the current inhabitants\
  \ of ancient Azlant now includes: Mordant Spire elves, wyrwoods, locathah, strix,\
  \ and even some clockwork compatriots. We were able to raise our companions from\
  \ the dead, and things look good as we prepare to spend what looks like an extended\
  \ amount of time underwater. Equipped with our newly reconstructed <i>apparatus\
  \ of the crab</i>, we're ready to set out across the ocean toward the next destination\
  \ in our odyssey: the underwater city of Talasantri!</p> \n      <h2>More Content</h2>\
