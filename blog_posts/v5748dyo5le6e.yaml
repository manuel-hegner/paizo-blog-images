  \ \n   <p>by Kevin Andrew Murphy</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: The Old Quay</h2> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">\"Observe,\
  \ Orlin.\" Norret scooped a vial of purple cabbage water from the leaves I was blanching\
  \ for the afternoon's meal. \"Note how the introduction of even a weak acid transmutes\
  \ the deepest amethyst to brilliant fuchsia....\" He added a drop of vinegar and\
  \ swirled it.</span></p> \n    <p>The dark purple did indeed change to bright pink,\
  \ but I'd already seen this reaction when he'd ruined half my store of violet syrup,\
  \ oblivious to the facts that sugar was dear in Isarn and violets troublesome to\
  \ pick.</p> \n    <p>High on the kitchen wall, one of the servant's bells jangled—\
  the one with the wire running to the Primrose Suite, occupied by Dr. Orontius, a\
  \ kindly old wizard and one of our best boarders.</p> \n    <p>A whiff of ectoplasm\
  \ manifested—an example of ethereal, the seventh scent, as Norret had taught me—\
  mixed with the faint odor of roses.</p> \n    <p>Some people, when they returned\
  \ from Pharasma's Boneyard, could see its denizens. Others heard ghostly voices.\
  \ Me? I was raised in Dabril, famous for its perfumes and gloves, so I only smelled\
  \ the dead and sometimes felt their touch.</p> \n    <p>The violet syrup levitated.\
  \ It emptied itself into a jug of water, dying it the same color, then changed this\
  \ to pink as a cut lemon squeezed itself over it.</p> \n    <p>\"You see?\" Norret\
  \ beamed. \"Even Rhodel can work a litmus test!\"</p> \n    <p>My ghostly spirit\
  \ guide also knew how to make pink lemonade. \"Go stall.\" I handed him the jug.\
  \ \"I'll bring lunch up as soon as I can.\"</p> \n    <p>As Norret left, words appeared\
  \ on the kitchen slate, written in a woman's hand: <i>Careful what you wish for</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I know.\" I had hoped that, after our last adventure, my brother would\
  \ stop treating me like a child. I had not expected that he, a grown man, absolved\
  \ of this responsibility, would start acting like a child himself. But it was the\
  \ case.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Orontius.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Orontius_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     <br> Dr. Orontius is nice enough—but a wizard is always plotting\
  \ something.\n    </div> \n    <p>It was also the case that the Revolutionary Council,\
  \ rulers of Galt, had appointed Norret and me proprietors of the Eglantine House,\
  \ home to some of the nation's finest scholars and magical researchers. They paid\
  \ rent but expected meals. The kitchen garden provided fruits and vegetables, a\
  \ few hens provided eggs, and an enchanted horn spoon provided bland unicorn bone\
  \ porridge. I had become good at hiding it in other dishes. This afternoon's luncheon\
  \ was cabbage rolls stuffed with \"horsemeat.\"</p> \n    <p>What would have really\
  \ helped were salt and spices.</p> \n    <p>Fortunately, Dr. Orontius had his own,\
  \ or at least he could wave his fingers in the air, mumble some ancient syllables,\
  \ and make a sprinkling of salt materialize over his food, followed by pepper. This\
  \ he did as soon as I arrived with the tray, then sampled a bite from a silver fork.\
  \ \"Ah, yes, now it is perfect.\"</p> \n    <p>Norret adjusted the complicated series\
  \ of jeweler's loupes and lead crystal lenses attached to the monocle he'd taken\
  \ to wearing in place of his old eyepatch. For reasons only my brother could understand—\
  sympathy, antipathy, planetary resonance—lead both helped divination and blocked\
  \ it. This included the sense I'd picked up from some unicorn horn and a drop of\
  \ philosopher's mercury, which let me detect poisons. Norret, after an alarming\
  \ and thankfully temporary experiment with eyedrops that let him look through walls,\
  \ had switched his optical inquiries to lens grinding and tinted glass. He'd been\
  \ trying to peep through the veil into Pharasma's realm so we could see Rhodel.\
  \ He still hadn't discovered the right combination of lenses to see the spirit world,\
  \ but had managed the arcane spectrum. </p> \n    <p>\"Is that phenomenon accomplished\
  \ by means of conjuration or spontaneous generation?\" he asked Orontius.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"An astute metaphysical question,\" said Dr. Orontius, \"but a true wizard\
  \ never reveals his secrets.\" His old blue eyes twinkled, the same color as his\
  \ robes and pointed hat. \"At least not without receiving another secret in trade.\
  \ Perhaps that formula for 'thieves vinegar' you mentioned?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not\
  \ in exchange for such a trifle,\" said Norret. \"An alchemist has his secrets as\
  \ well.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Just so,\" Dr. Orontius agreed, turning to me. \"Your brother\
  \ claims to have a formula for a fabulous antiplague, a sovereign preventative for\
  \ all manner of ills. As Desna would have it, a plague currently ravages Korvosa.\
  \ Zharmides, an old classmate from my Acadamae days, has recently perished therein.\
  \ I desire a keepsake to remember him by, a little ivory snuffbox of which he was\
  \ fond.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Can you describe it?\" Norret asked him.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Why describe when one can simply show?\" Dr. Orontius muttered arcane phrases and\
  \ made mystical passes with both hands, opening one to reveal a tiny ivory chest\
  \ resting on his palm. \"This is merely a memory, so look but do not touch.\" The\
  \ wizard's memory sharpened, scrimshawed lions and lilies appearing on the sides,\
  \ little clasps and fittings in matching gold. It floated in the air, tumbling like\
  \ a bubble, revealing a gilded sigil engraved on the bottom, looking like a stylized\
  \ Z.</p> \n    <p>My brother took out his formulary and a silver pencil. The talent\
  \ Norret lacks for cooking he makes up for with drawing and scientific illustration.\
  \ Soon he had a passable silverpoint architectural diagram of the snuffbox.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I expect it should be among the effects to be interred with his body.\"\
  \ The wizard gestured with his fork and the vision of the snuffbox vanished, quickly\
  \ followed by his last bite of cabbage roll. \"Whether that will be in Korvosa or\
  \ with his family in Alkenstar, I cannot say. But I'm certain there should be time\
  \ for formal viewing at the Acadamae itself.\" He produced another snuffbox, this\
  \ one of paueliel burl, the sacred \"first trees\" of the elves. Norret had taught\
  \ me how to identify paueliel along with a dozen other woods with interesting alchemical\
  \ properties. A matching traveler's trunk sat against one wall, swirled with whorls\
  \ like owl eyes, and I swear, I had once seen it blink at me.</p> \n    <p>Muco,\
  \ an actual owl and Dr. Orontius's familiar, perched atop a bust of Nethys at one\
  \ end of the mantel. He swiveled his head around backward and blinked at me for\
  \ real.</p> \n    <p>Dr. Orontius merely opened the smaller box, a whorl on the\
  \ lid forming yet another eye with the iris wide as an O, and took a pinch of snuff\
  \ in each nostril. The snuffbox disappeared back up his sleeve, replaced with a\
  \ handkerchief. \"I shall give you a letter for Zharmides.\" He blew his nose decisively.\
  \ \"While he of course will not be able to read it, being dead, it should at least\
  \ gain you admittance to the funeral.\"</p> \n    <p>Where my brother would pick\
  \ a dead wizard's pocket. Unless Dr. Orontius's \"friend\" were already interred,\
  \ in which case Norret would think nothing of burgling the dead.</p> \n    <p>After\
  \ all, he'd already dug up my grave. Not that I was complaining.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  He's not going alone,\" I stated plainly.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, surely—\" said Dr.\
  \ Orontius.</p> \n    <p>I cut him off. \"<i>Surely</i> something can go wrong.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Norret only smiled with his eyes, but the one without the monocle\
  \ was almost dancing with amusement. \"Orlin is growing up.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Quite,\"\
  \ sniffed Dr. Orontius. \"But if this 'thieves vinegar' is as efficacious as purported,\
  \ there should be no risk to yourselves.\"</p> \n    <p>I had already died once\
  \ of a fever, and while I had been brought back to life, I had no desire to repeat\
  \ the experience. That said, it was not my brother's alchemy I was worried about.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"As Desna would also have it, tomorrow is an execution day.\" Dr. Orontius\
  \ stood, straightening his robes and his beard. \"Your boarders will be procuring\
  \ viands elsewhere, and since you two have no other duties, shall we away now?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I paused. \"Wait. Isn't Korvosa rather far away? <i>Outside of Galt?</i>\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"In Varisia,\" Dr. Orontius supplied helpfully, \"but really, it's\
  \ no further away than that picture.\" He gestured to a wall crowded with old paintings.\
  \ He'd shown me his collection many times, telling tales of his travels in the days\
  \ before the <i>Revolution: The Grand Opera House of Egorian</i>, capital of devil-haunted\
  \ Cheliax; or <i>The Warlock's Walk</i> in Nex, parade ground for its arcane arclords.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>His finger indicated a smoke-yellowed painting up in one corner. A small\
  \ brass plaque attached to the frame identified it as <i>The Old Quay In Korvosa</i>.\
  \ \"Are you familiar with a metaphysical process known as 'teleportation'?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>I was not familiar with teleportation\
  \ before Dr. Orontius cast his spell. Afterwards? I never wished to experience it\
  \ again. Unfortunately, if we ever wanted to see our beloved Galt, we would rejoin\
  \ him on the morrow at this spot when he would transport us back to Isarn.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I was also wondering if we'd traveled in time as well as space, for the\
  \ sun hung lower in the east than it had in Isarn, but before I could ask, Dr. Orontius\
  \ pronounced some ritual phrase and vanished with an inrush of air and an audible\
  \ pop.</p> \n    <p>Norret and I were left on the quay, a very old dock, even older\
  \ than the one in Dr. Orontius's antique painting. As I looked down at it, I realized\
  \ we were standing at the same spot where the painting had been made.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"An excellent illustration of sympathetic magic,\" Norret remarked.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He wasn't smiling, but the corners of his eyes crinkled. He knew the pun\
  \ he'd made, but wasn't going to admit it.</p> \n    <p>\"But which branch? Homeopathic\
  \ or contagious?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Homeopathic,\" I decided. \"The Law of Similarity\
  \ governs a wizard using a painting to go where it shows.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But wouldn't\
  \ it also be contagious?\" My brother waved a gloved hand. \"Surely it was painted\
  \ from this exact vista.\"</p> \n    <p>The boards of the quay were spotted with\
  \ pigment. A short distance away were two easels with artists behind them. No pun\
  \ intended, we'd teleported to the most picturesque spot in Korvosa.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Both then. It falls under the Law of Contact too.\"</p> \n    <p>The Law of Contact,\
  \ or Contagion, stated that things that had once been in contact remained in contact.\
  \ That meant that anything that touched evil could become evil, so if you put on\
  \ a ring that had been to the Worldwound, for example, you could be possessed by\
  \ a demon. If you touched something that had been touched by a plague victim? You\
  \ could catch the plague.</p> \n    <p>It was alarming to think about. Before, I\
  \ had thought that sickness was carried by tiny pixies so small as to be invisible,\
  \ who flew over the river from Kyonin on mosquitoes and shot people with poison\
  \ darts. At least that's what the doctor told my mother. While I'm sure she put\
  \ out a bowl of milk and honey to make them take my fever away, that obviously didn't\
  \ work.</p> \n    <p>Norret's solution, rather than milk and honey to bribe capricious\
  \ fey, was vinegar to drive them off. Thieves vinegar was perfumed with a bouquet\
  \ of magical herbs–sage, mint, tansy, thyme, rosemary, lavender, wormwood, and rue–\
  but it took an alchemist to know how to decoct them so what you got was an antiplague\
  \ instead of salad dressing. Besides driving away evil pixies, thieves vinegar was\
  \ said to ward off fever spirits, purge foul humours, and repel the flies that were\
  \ the eyes of Urgathoa, at least if you believed the nursery rhyme:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ <i><p>I met a pale lady in a tattered spattered gown.</p> <p>Her hair was black.\
  \ Her face was white. Her dress was red and brown.</p> <p>She said the flies were\
  \ all her eyes and she saw near and far.</p> <p>I drove her off with salad and a\
  \ splash of vinegar!</p></i> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>That was a lot to expect\
  \ from salad dressing.</p> \n    <p>That said, I had faith in my brother. He had\
  \ faith in Citizen Cedrine who'd taught him the formula. She in turn had had faith\
  \ in the graverobbers who'd used the perfumed vinegar to safely plunder plague pits\
  \ and battlefields before they were sent to the guillotine for their crimes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We'd washed with it, gargled with it, and for good measure carried hollowed-out\
  \ pomander oranges studded with cloves, wreathed in frilly ribbons, and filled with\
  \ sponges soaked with thieves vinegar. \"Carried\" is probably not the right word.\
  \ They were floating, and not just because Rhodel was playing with them or because\
  \ I'd forgot and reached for something with my soul's hand instead of my regular\
  \ hand like I sometimes did. They were floating because Norret's only sponge came\
  \ from a deceased will-o'-wisp, which he'd prepared specially so that it would retain\
  \ its ability to float. It glowed, too, or at least would come nightfall.</p> \n\
  \    <p>So there we were, standing on the oldest quay in Korvosa with pomander oranges\
  \ circling our heads.</p> \n    <p>Strange as it may sound, we were not the strangest\
  \ people there. Two men walked down the quay wearing perfectly ordinary tricorne\
  \ hats, but below them they had the faces of storks. Occasionally they stopped at\
  \ a shop, looked in, and marked an X on the door with chalk. At first I was thinking\
  \ they had stork men in Korvosa like I'd heard lived in Osirion, but then I realized\
  \ that they were wearing masks.</p> \n    <p>\"Plague doctors,\" Norret explained.\
  \ \"Those are doctors' masks.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Wouldn't storks make more sense for\
  \ midwives?\"</p> \n    <p>\"If they wore them for fashion, yes,\" explained Norret,\
  \ \"but the beaks hold herbs that work like our pomanders. Powdermaster Davin once\
  \ helped us rig up similar masks for the battlefield. But he'd been to Korvosa before\
  \ the Revolution and said it's illegal to wear a doctor's mask if you're not a doctor.\
  \ Besides, we don't want to see patients. We just need to find Zharmides the Godless—\
  or his body. He is, or at least was, a professor at the Acadamae.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Where's the Acadamae?\"</p> \n    <p>It was a reasonable question, and I was completely\
  \ skipping the fact that I'd missed the honorific and \"Zharmides the Godless\"\
  \ didn't sound like anyone you wanted to deal with, even if he was dead.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Especially if he was dead. I didn't know what the gods did with atheists,\
  \ but it couldn't be pleasant. And I'm saying this as someone who met a couple of\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p>Gods, I mean. Not atheists. Or, if I hadn't met them, at least\
  \ I dreamed about Shelyn and Pharasma talking about me when I was dying, so it sort\
  \ of counts.</p> \n    <p>\"I think it's on the top of a hill.\" Norret glanced\
  \ around. Two hills were visible in the city, one nearer, one farther. \"Let me\
  \ ask.\"</p> \n    <p>He went over to one of the artists while I stood there feeling\
  \ somewhere between stupid and nervous. Apart from that time when I died, I'd never\
  \ been outside of Galt, and while Korvosa wasn't as grand as Isarn, it was still\
  \ far grander than Dabril. And there was a plague, so I assumed many folk were staying\
  \ in.</p> \n    <p>\"<i>Reefclaw pasty! Hot 'n tasty!</i>\"</p> \n    <p>Even plague\
  \ couldn't stop barkers. A young woman wearing a patchwork scarf waved to me. Her\
  \ booth's sign read <i>Meatclaw's Feast</i>! It showed some horrible monster with\
  \ the front half of a lobster and the back half of an eel, a giant wooden claw grasping\
  \ a doll in the shape of a terrified fisherman.</p> \n    <p>Behind the young woman\
  \ was an older one tending a cauldron of boiling oil. She used a wire mesh scoop\
  \ to fish out balls of fried meat that looked like the salmon croquettes. One of\
  \ them floated in the air, took a second to dip itself in what looked like cameline\
  \ sauce, and popped itself in my open mouth.</p> \n    <p>I didn't know whether\
  \ to thank Rhodel or be annoyed at her, so I just ate it. The sauce did taste like\
  \ cameline, with cinnamon and nutmeg, but with mint in place of the usual ginger.\
  \ The pasties tasted like crayfish-and-lamprey tarts.</p> \n    <p>\"For eight silver\
  \ shields, I'll owe you three more pasties and another spoon of thileu bark sauce.\"\
  \ I glanced at the menu slate. It seemed spice was as dear in Korvosa as it was\
  \ in Isarn, but meat was cheaper, even if it was monster meat.</p> \n    <p>I took\
  \ out a gold minted by one of Galt's previous Revolutionary Councils and tossed\
  \ it to her. The young woman scrutinized it and shrugged. She handed me a paper\
  \ cone with three more pasties, a waxed paper cup of dipping sauce, and a couple\
  \ of the local silvers which did indeed have shields on them.</p> \n    <p>I went\
  \ back over to Norret, who was talking with one of the artists. \"And they still\
  \ make Newby Violet? Excellent!\" He noted the reefclaw pasties and the dipping\
  \ sauce. He took one, sampling both. \"Thileu bark? Some interesting alchemical\
  \ properties there. And... reefclaw?\" He glanced over at the sign. \"That could\
  \ come in useful.\"</p> \n    <p>He took a second pasty and munched it. Then he\
  \ confiscated the last pasty and the dipping sauce, placing the pasty in a pouch\
  \ and the sauce in a stoppered vial. \"Intriguing stuff, thileu bark. Only the Varisians\
  \ know the trick of harvesting it.\" He chewed, considering. \"Said to be one of\
  \ the few spices potent enough to be tasted by the dead.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Did you\
  \ find the Acadamae?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, yes, it's on that hill over there.\" He\
  \ pointed to the farther one. \"But I also found out where we could buy a map.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>My brother had that dreamy look he sometimes gets. He led us up a\
  \ couple streets and around a corner. There he stopped and stared with an expression\
  \ like he'd seen Shelyn combing out her rainbow-streaked hair.</p> \n    <p>I saw\
  \ a sagging old shop with a quilt of little diamond-paned windows displaying pots\
  \ and jars, easels and brushes, and a signboard that looked like an artist's palette\
  \ sized for a giant. The multicolored splotches spelled out <i>Hessim, Newby, &amp;\
  \ Sage Paint Manufactory</i>.</p> \n    <p>\"Powdermaster Davin told me about this\
  \ place.\"</p> \n    <p>I followed my brother inside. The shop reeked of turpentine\
  \ and linseed oil. And poison. My unicorn senses were almost overwhelmed: arsenic\
  \ in the familiar Isarn green, quicksilver in the Tian red, and white lead in the\
  \ flake white. That was everywhere, in gallon jars and penny pots and covering all\
  \ the pre-painted canvases.</p> \n    <p>They also, indeed, had maps, whimsical\
  \ illustrated ones with points of interest drawn to a larger scale. But the pigments\
  \ and poisons were everything an alchemist could dream of, which explained my brother's\
  \ glazed expression. \"I want your deluxe set. The one with everything—including\
  \ the special pigments...\"</p> \n    <p>Three old men stood behind the counter.\
  \ When I say \"old,\" I mean you could picture them patting liches on the head and\
  \ calling them \"sonny.\" When I say \"men,\" I'm meaning men shorter than me, like\
  \ tall no-nonsense gnomes. On the wall behind the counter hung three masterful portraits\
  \ labeled with helpful brass plaques: <i>Hessim, Newby, and Sage</i>.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Sage spoke first: \"You couldn't afford it.\"</p> \n    <p>Hessim spoke second:\
  \ \"Who told you to ask?\"</p> \n    <p>Newby simply took off his thick spectacles,\
  \ polished them with a velvet pocket square, and named a figure that would have\
  \ made Abadar check his vault.</p> \n    <p>Norret did not drop his monocle. He\
  \ reached into his pack and pulled out a beautiful cut crystal flask that had formerly\
  \ belonged to Dabril's duchess and had until recently held honeysuckle absolute.\
  \ Now it was glowing with an eerie light. \"Perhaps we could work out a trade.\"\
