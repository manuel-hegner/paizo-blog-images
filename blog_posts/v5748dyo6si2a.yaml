  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Growing up in Caliphas,\
  \ in the haunted nation of Ustalav, Mios Uriev learned that monsters can look like\
  \ anyone, but they normally look like the rich.</p> \n     <p>Mios was born poor\
  \ in the city of dark excess. In a place where disappearances were the norm, their\
  \ parents raised them with a strict but protective hand, shutting the door to their\
  \ meager home firmly at night. Mios took solace from this grim upbringing in knowledge,\
  \ diving into whatever books they could get their hands on and seeking tales wherever\
  \ they could find them, resulting in an eclectic education. One month, they memorized\
  \ religious hymns from Andoran; another, they’d rush to finish their errands so\
  \ they could see a presentation on medical practices from Qadira. It didn’t matter\
  \ the subject, so long as they could dig into the knowledge the world of books presented\
  \ to them. They had few friends, but that mattered little in the face of the company\
  \ their learning provided.</p> \n     <p>Grown into a young adult full of studied\
  \ confidence, Mios found work as a night coach driver—though they aspired to something\
  \ loftier, opportunities were limited for a young worker of their means. Night after\
  \ night, through pounding rain and choking fog, they drove their charges from grand\
  \ homes to lavish parties and more often than not, their patrons gave Mios the chills.\
  \ Perhaps it was the unnatural pallor of their faces or the glint of too-sharp teeth,\
  \ but Mios became increasingly convinced that a number of Caliphas’s elite were\
  \ monsters. And one night, their fears were proven true.</p> \n     <table class=\"\

  ></a></td>\n       </tr> \n      </tbody>\n     </table> \n     <p>That night, under\
  \ the light of the full moon, Mios drove a young noble to a banquet at a secluded\
  \ mansion. The man seemed agitated, restless, fidgeting and twitching and pulling\
  \ the blinds tight. A shiver laced through Mios’s stomach as the carriage began\
  \ to shake. An enormous roar split through the night as the foolish noble tore through\
  \ his finery, the transformation taking him. Scrambling, Mios pulled the cart to\
  \ the side of the darkened road, grabbing their lantern.</p> \n     <p>The wolf\
  \ leaped forward with dripping maw, tearing at Mios’s leg with yellowed canines\
  \ and letting out a sickening crunch as tooth hit bone. With a swing of their arm,\
  \ Mios shone their lantern in the creature’s face, shouting to drive him off. The\
  \ beast recoiled, almost seeming to remember himself for a moment, the lantern’\
  s light illuminating his feral form. The creature dove from the carriage and scrambled\
  \ into the night, leaving Mios bleeding... but alive.</p> \n     <p>A werewolf bite,\
  \ they thought grimly as they drove home, barely hanging onto consciousness. Countless\
  \ cures written in dusty tomes or purported by local folk healers, but none proven,\
  \ none reliable. No hope, most might think. But Mios believed in knowledge, believed\
  \ in the power of the written word and the passed-down tale. Over the next month,\
  \ they nursed their near-shattered leg, which would heal but never be quite the\
  \ same, always requiring a brace to hold it steady. While their body recovered,\
  \ they stretched their mind, reading every text they could get their hands on, apocryphal\
  \ or not, and trying every reported cure. Herbal remedies, blood sacrifices of small\
  \ animals, and stranger, they tried method after method, hoping one would stick.\
  \ When the full moon next came, they drove into the woods and waited in terror for\
  \ what all said was inevitable. The moon rose painfully slow, each moment an agonizing\
  \ wait for the pain to begin, for the cracking of bones and sprouting of fur and\
  \ claw. But the night waxed on, and the moon reached its anticlimactic zenith. Mios\
  \ sat in silence. Could it be possible? Had they found a cure among the dozens of\
  \ methods they tried? It appeared so. Which cure had actually worked, they’d never\
  \ know, but their dedication and desperation had paid off. They had fought off the\
  \ bite.</p> \n     <p>After their miraculous escape from this dark fate, Mios’s\
  \ everyday life, ferrying others back and forth along the same wagon tracks, seemed\
  \ devoid of meaning. They had discovered an incredible truth: fates weren’t sealed.\
  \ Their learning, their dedication, it made them more than just a driver. To continue\
  \ with their previous life felt like a waste of the gift they were just beginning\
  \ to realize they possessed. Because the world was full of dark things, the powerful\
  \ preying on the weak. Their lantern, which once shone the way through darkened\
  \ streets, could shine a light on creatures of the night and bring hope to those\
  \ in need.</p> \n     <p>And so, Mios set forth on a life of adventure, knowledge\
  \ as their weapon. The unknown, the dark, all could be illuminated by the right\
  \ source: their wit, their determination, and their lantern’s unfailing light.</p>\
