  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Mary Jane Pajaron</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>This\
  \ is one of the largest meta-regions in the book, stretching along the northern\
  \ coast of Garund from the island of Nuat, across the Obari Ocean and Stonespire\
  \ Island, to Qadira where Avistan and Casmaron meet. Five nations comprise the Golden\
  \ Road—Katapesh, Osirion, Qadira, Rahadoum, and Thuvia—and while they all feature\
  \ wide deserts, they're nevertheless distinct from one another, providing endless\
  \ inspiration for adventure along trade caravans, teeming bazaars, long-lost pyramids,\
  \ or hidden oases.</p> \n    <p>In Katapesh, the mysterious Pactmasters maintain\
  \ their enigmatic rule over the mercantile nation, as implemented by their agent,\
  \ Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid. In the bazaars of Katapesh, adventurers, collectors,\
  \ and purveyors of the bizarre can find just about anything they seek, assuming\
  \ they can effectively barter for it. The nation takes its name from the euphoric\
  \ drug, pesh, the foundation of the region's black market, and full stats for the\
  \ drug's refined form are available for players or GMs willing to risk addiction\
  \ for the pleasure of a little escape. The slavers of Okeno off Katapesh's eastern\
  \ shore still peddle flesh, despite facing an influx of abolitionist movements on\
  \ the waters of the Inner Sea and Obari Ocean. While the slave trade has been outlawed\
  \ in Absalom, it's very much alive in Katapesh, giving liberators and Firebrands\
  \ a new target in their war for universal freedom.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Ruby Prince Khemet III has rescinded his policy of welcoming outside explorers\
  \ to the nation's many ruins, after many of the new discoveries brought more trouble\
  \ to his land than they brought wealth. In perhaps the most trying event of Osirion's\
  \ modern history, the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I rose from his tomb in 4714 to reclaim\
  \ his ancient empire with a fleet of flying pyramids. Though he was stopped by brave\
  \ adventurers, upon his defeat, that fleet of pyramids pyramids fell to the ground,\
  \ causing incredible devastation in population centers like Sothis and peppering\
  \ the desert with newly unearthed ruins for Osirionologists to explore.</p> \n \

  \ of a new, more capable ruler in Taldor has quieted Satrap Xerbystes II's saber\
  \ rattling in recent years, but Qadira represents just the eastern tip of the continent-spanning\
  \ Padishah Empire of Kelesh. Over the millennia, trade and expansionism from the\
  \ empire have led to many wars and conquests across the Golden Road, including a\
  \ lengthy rule over Osirion and the religiously-motivated Oath Wars that led Rahadoum\
  \ to adopt their Laws of Mortality. Though tensions between Qadira and its neighbors\
  \ may have calmed of late, the nation's military remains under the control of the\
  \ satrap's vizier, Hebizid Vraj who was appointed by the Padishah Emperor himself,\
  \ and has the power to overrule the satrap if he leads the nation in directions\
  \ against the empire's interests. What those interests are and what they may lead\
  \ to in the future is anyone's guess.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ continues its longstanding tradition of eschewing all divine interference by strictly\
  \ enforcing the Laws of Mortality, which restrict the preaching of religion and\
  \ the trade of holy texts or symbols. Where other nations might have thriving churches\
  \ to myriad deities or demigods, the Rahadoumi instead have some of the most advanced\
  \ schools of arcane magic, science, and philosophy on the Inner Sea. Of special\
  \ interest to characters who wish to forge their own destinies instead of being\
  \ pawns to supposedly \"higher\" powers, the Godless Healing feat allows for augmented\
  \ healing in the absence of a divine healer.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ east, Thuvia stands out for being less a single nation than a confederation of\
  \ allied city-states. The nation's economy is largely dependent on a single product,\
  \ the powerful sun orchid elixir, which allows those wealthy enough to purchase\
  \ a vial extended life and youthful vitality. Though the tradition of alternating\
  \ which city would host the annual auction for the season's batch of the potent\
  \ alchemical concoction, recent shifts in the balance of power have some Thuvians\
  \ worried that the delicate balance may soon come to an end. Agents of all five\
  \ powerful city-states now advocate for unification into a more traditional nation,\
  \ though each believes that their city should be the new capital.</p> \n    <div\
