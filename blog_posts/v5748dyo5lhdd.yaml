  description\">The invite went out on November 25, 2008, three months after we released\
  \ the Beta rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. James Jacobs, our beloved Creative\
  \ Director (then Editor-in-Chief), sent the following email to a few select members\
  \ of the Paizo staff:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>\"SO! It is time for\
  \ us editors and developers and publishers to really start learning this new game\
  \ we're building. One way to do that, the MOST FUN way, of course, is to play the\
  \ game.</i></p> \n      <p><i>I've been mentioning this before, but I'd love to\
  \ start up a campaign here at the office. I'm looking at running the game twice\
  \ a month after work on every other Thursday, starting with the first Thursday after\
  \ New Year's: January 8th of 2009. I was thinking of starting it in December, but\
  \ after the holidays seems smartest so that we'll get a regular schedule going AND\
  \ by then we should be more caught up AND by then the game itself should be closer\
  \ to being finalized. This is not so much a playtest campaign as much as it is a\
  \ \"Learn the new rules\" campaign, as a result. The first game will be on January\
  \ 8th of 2009. It'll take place in the main conference room, and we'll start at\
  \ 6:30 PM and play until 10:00 PM.\"</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The\
  \ first game started a wee bit later than James originally intended, as we were\
  \ all too busy finalizing the Core Rulebook and getting it to the printer in time\
  \ for its August 2009 release. The very first session actually took place on Thursday,\
  \ March 19. You can read a recap of the first session (and several more) in the\
  \ <a href=\"/threads/rzs2jepq\">Campaign Journal on our forums</a>.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ campaign was called \"The Shadow Under Sandpoint,\" and was set in James's \"\
  home base\" Varisian town of Sandpoint, which is heavily based on Point Arena, CA,\
  \ where he grew up. That first session was mostly focused on character creation.\
  \ Nine posts into the Campaign Journal, I piped up with the following comment:</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>\"I finally settled on a name that reflects\
  \ my first-level feat choices of Endurance and Die Hard: OSTOG THE UNSLAIN!</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>Let's see how long I can keep that title...\"</i></p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>The answer turned out to be six years and a couple of weeks. Last Thursday,\
  \ April 9, we finally wrapped up the campaign!</p> \n     <p>The original players\
  \ in Paizo's longest-running staff game were: Erik Mona, Sean K Reynolds, James\
  \ Sutter, Wes Schneider, Chris Carey, and Jason Bulmahn. We were very shortly thereafter\
  \ joined by honorary Paizonian and PaizoCon founder Tim Nightengale.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>As the years went on, Sean, James Sutter, and Chris left the group, and Rob\
  \ McCreary joined.</p> \n     <p>Our adventures in Sandpoint brought us up against\
  \ key villains like the Red Bishop, the ghost of the serial killer Chopper, and\
  \ of course the Sandpoint Devil.</p> \n     <p>In late 2011, James shifted the focus\
  \ of the campaign from Sandpoint to the southern deserts of Osirion. He was eager\
  \ for a change of scenery, but more importantly, he wanted to put us up against\
  \ a huge challenge in the form of Gary Gygax's <em>Necropolis</em>, an enormous\
  \ dungeon Gygax designed for the old Dangerous Journeys game. Our friend Clark Peterson\
  \ had adapted <em>Necropolis</em> to the d20 rules system in a hardcover mega-adventure\
  \ from Necromancer Games, and it was this version that James updated to Pathfinder,\
  \ made his own, and sent us into like an ancient Egyptian meatgrinder.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Three and a half years later, we emerged into the burial chamber of the great\
  \ lich lord Rahotep, eager to put him to final death. I was also eager to solidify\
  \ Ostog the Unslain's title and reputation forever. Would we manage to survive?</p>\

  \ Styrian Kindler (<i>human bard played by F. Wesley Schneider</i>),<br> Velmarius\

  \ paladin played by Tim Nightengale</i>), and Ostog the Unslain (<i>played by yours\
  \ truly</i>).</p> \n      <p>I brought the Veuve, of course.</p>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Even looking at these miniatures as I write this blog, it's weird for me\
  \ to think that they won't ever appear on a gaming table together again. Nearly\
  \ every other week for 6 years is a long time. I'm starting to get a bit wistful...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>No matter. After throwing back some celebratory champagne, it was time\
  \ to take the fight to the insidious Rahotep! By the time this session rolled around,\
  \ we were 17th level with 2 mythic tiers. But all of us were worried that it might\
  \ not be enough!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo2_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Our first battle was against a massive umbral dragon being\
  \ ridden by \"the Mother of All Boar Demons.\" You might not recognize boar demons.\
  \ They're unique to Gary Gygax's <em>Necropolis</em>. Gary was kind enough to give\
  \ them absolutely killer gaze attacks, which are always fun. Notice how the party\
  \ is standing in a perfect group for a dragon's breath weapon attack...</p> \n \
  \    <p>We were still pretty confident, thanks in no small part to the huge number\
  \ of precast spells Styrian the bard had pumped us up with. It got so out of hand\
  \ we had to use the conference room whiteboard. Here's a peek:</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo3_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>To head off a few rules lawyers posting about how not all\
  \ of these spells stack with each other... you're right. Some of the spells were\
  \ only cast on a couple of us, and some of them were ladled on top of other bonuses\
  \ to squeak out a little bonus even if most of the spell was not tremendously useful.\
  \ We did it right, I assure you.</p> \n     <p>A quick note on the list to the right.\
  \ Over the course of the campaign, each of us had gained a small statue of an Ancient\
  \ Osiriani god, who acted as a sort of protective spirit at various points in the\
  \ dungeon. Each of these acted as a \"get out of one death free\" card for the final\
  \ session, where we ended up getting hit with multiple death effects per round.\
  \ We'll check back later to see how that turned out for us.</p> \n     <p>With all\
  \ of that buffing, we were able to dispatch the Mother of All Boar Demons and the\
  \ umbral dragon without too much trouble. That led us to Rahotep's actual tomb,\
  \ which looked like this:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo4.jpg\"><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo4_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Each of the Large miniatures represented a statue of\
  \ one of the Spawn of Rovagug (did I mention Rahotep worshiped Rovagug?). And we\
  \ all know nothing bad ever happens with statues in a dungeon, right?</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The gentleman seated opposite us is James Jacobs himself, looking self-satisfied\
  \ at the awesome spread he set out for us, and the fate he had in store for us.\
  \ He also is about 100 pounds lighter than he was when the campaign started, so\
  \ holy hell, let's raise some champagne to that!</p> \n     <p>The statues turned\
  \ out to be horrific traps that _didn't_ spring to terrible life (much to our surprise),\
  \ and in relatively short order we'd managed to destroy them and funnel their inherent\
  \ energy into the room's central sarcophagus, opening the very tomb of Rahotep himself.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Very shortly, the room looked like this:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo5.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo5_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>When the GM drops a Todd McFarlane action figure on the table\
  \ to represent the campaign's Big Bad, you know you're in deep. The two tentacles,\
  \ by the way, were the god Rovagug's ACTUAL TENTACLES, reaching through a planar\
  \ prison to defend one of his most powerful earthly servants. If the tentacle touched\
  \ you, you died. Period. It's at this point that the names of some of those Ancient\
  \ Osiriani gods started coming off the whiteboard. If a name was erased, that god\
  \ was forever banned from the world of Golarion.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo6.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo6_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>With a great deal of effort, we managed to kill Rahotep.\
  \ And that's when his mask came off and his skull immediately turned into a demilich.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The most shocking event of the night occurred when the demilich disintegrated\
  \ our borderline-evil sorcerer Velmarius. That patch of dust in the below picture\
  \ is Jason Bulmahn, lead designer of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. ZZzzzt!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo7.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150419-Photo7_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Remarkably (for a character who had acted like a self-interested\
  \ bastard for literally the entire campaign) Jason decided NOT to cash in his \"\
  get out of death free\" Osiriani god token, reasoning that his life was not worth\
  \ striking Osiris himself forever from the ranks of Golarion's deities. What a guy!\
  \ Knowing Velmarius (and Jason), the sorcerer must have had something up his sleeve,\
  \ but Jason played it cool and quiet. It was almost good enough to think that he\
  \ was a little mad about his character dying...</p> \n     <p>We swiftly avenged\
  \ our fallen ally and defeated Rahotep once and for all. Here's a look at the whiteboard\
  \ at the end. Pay particular attention to the fact that Ostog never cashed in his\
  \ get out of death free card!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ after the campaign. Ostog, apparently, has a linnorm with his name on it in the\
  \ Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Will Ostog one day be a Linnorm King? It would take\
  \ a pretty powerful member of the Paizo staff to make THAT happen, I reckon!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And what of the deceased Velmarius, the only character to truly die\
  \ that night? Well, Jason had a plan for that all along... </p>\n     <div class=\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>I cannot summarize in a simple blog post what a treat and\
  \ honor it was for all of us to play in James Jacobs's campaign. James is a masterful\
  \ storyteller, and he always put in a ton of work to make sure that everyone was\
  \ engaged and having fun. I'll miss the campaign terribly (though we're all getting\
  \ together to start a Call of Cthulhu campaign on Thursday, so we'll still be playing\
  \ together regularly). To James I say: Thank you, my friend. It was an absolutely\
  \ fantastic campaign, and you are truly a legendary GM.</p> \n     <p>And since\
  \ we're moving to Call of Cthulhu, I have no intention of naming my character \"\
  Unslain\" or expecting to survive even the first session.</p> \n     <p>What a refreshing\
  \ change death will be!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div>\
