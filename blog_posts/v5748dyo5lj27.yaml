  \ for the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lidu\">Giantslayer and Iron Gods</a> Adventure\
  \ Paths back in January, Linda and I have had our hands full preparing for PaizoCon\
  \ and Gen Con. We're thrilled to have delivered <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lizf\"\
  >a huge number of new scenarios</a>, and it's even more exciting to enter this comparably\
  \ relaxed time of the year in which we can catch up on old business. You may have\
  \ noticed Linda over the last week appearing in countless discussion threads to\
  \ offer clarifications and then disappear in a cloud of ebullient nosoi psychopomps.\
  \ I've been wrangling authors, outlining a bunch of new scenarios, and sending out\
  \ new assignments; keep an eye out for new product pages soon (and see below for\
  \ a list of upcoming scenarios, should you need information for planning upcoming\
  \ conventions).</p> <b>Upcoming Scenarios</b> \n    <input type=\"button\" value=\"\
  Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n    <div class=\"\
  spoiler-text\"> \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-04: Wardens\
  \ of Sulfur Gulch (Tier 7-11)</em></li> \n      <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #8-05: Ungrounded but Unbroken (Tier 1-5)</em></li> \n      <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-06: Reaping What We Sow (Tier 1-5)</em></li> \n      <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose (An experimental Tier\
  \ 3-7)</em></li>\n     </ul> \n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <p>Together, though, we're\
  \ sanctioning a massive number of Modules and Adventure Paths. Today I'd like to\
  \ share the first of many: <a href=\"/products/btpy9grq\"><em>Pathfinder Module:\
  \ Feast of Dust</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9jbf\"><em>Pathfinder Module:\
  \ Ire of the Storm</em></a>! You can find the sanctioning documents on their respective\
  \ product pages.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9548-Opener2.jpg\"\

  \   </div> \n   <p><em>Ire of the Storm</em> skipped ahead in line a bit largely\
  \ because we want to prioritize sanctioning low-level material in the organized\
  \ play campaign. Don't worry though, as we're busily looking ahead to <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9grs\"><em>The House on Hook Street</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6u\"\
  ><em>Down the Blighted Path</em></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9nfu\"><em>Gallows\
  \ of Madness</em></a>. We've also queued the Adventure Paths <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  >Hell's Rebels</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons</a> for attention, and after those, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/serpentsSkull\"\
  >Serpent's Skull</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\">Kingmaker</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves\">Council of Thieves</a>\
  \ are all eagerly waiting their turns to provide hundreds of hours of additional\
  \ content to the campaign. At this point, we haven't dug into <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell's Vengeance</a> deeply enough to know quite if or how it might fit into the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>; if anything,\
  \ it'll likely be one we sanction in \"campaign mode\" only. Finally, I have the\
  \ pleasure of reading more <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/novels\">Pathfinder Tales\
  \ novels</a> and have nearly finished <a href=\"/products/btpy9e45\"><em>Hellknight</em></a>,\
  \ meaning I'm almost done writing the Volume 8 sanctioning Chronicle sheet.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>That covers a lot of what's currently missing, but it does leave out one\
  \ noteworthy absence: the Pathfinder Society Open Call. You may have noticed that\
  \ we have a new Pathfinder Society landing page and that much of our campaign information\
  \ got rearranged just before Gen Con. I'm taking this as an opportunity to revise\
  \ the Open Call guidelines and add in some more advice I've learned from looking\
  \ over past entries. My projection is that it will still be a 2,000-word (or less)\
  \ quest, so if you're in the middle of preparing your own submission based on past\
  \ guidelines, it's fairly unlikely you'll need to make any significant changes.\
  \ I do, however, advise not sending in new submissions during this short hiatus,\
  \ as I'll be reading any submissions I've received since August 1, 2016 with these\
  \ new guidelines in mind. Once the Open Call is all spruced up, expect to see a\
  \ blog announcing that it's back in action.</p> \n   <p>John Compton<br> <i>Pathfinder\
