  \ itemprop=\"description\">Convention season for us is a lot like hosting a large\
  \ gathering of family and friends for a major holiday: preparing way more dishes\
  \ than usual, aiming for more spectacular fare than we would otherwise cook, and\
  \ fretting about whether great-aunt Matilda will critique how we made the pie crust.\
  \ From dicing the first onion to the moment where everyone sits down and takes the\
  \ first bite of food, there's always the question of whether everything turned out\
  \ just right. Sometimes, though, you can just tell that everything's fallen into\
  \ place before even seeing your guests' expressions. In my extended analogy, while\
  \ Tonya, Todd Morgan, and Bob Jonquet have handled our seating arrangements and\
  \ sending out invitations, I think my co-chefs Linda, Thurston Hillman, and Jason\
  \ Keeley can agree that the menu this year turned out great.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \      <br> <i>Illustration by Dion Harris</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>One year ago,\
  \ I ran an increasingly infamous session of <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>\
  \ for a handful of noteworthy hooligans. One of the chief takeaways from this event\
  \ was the tradition of shouting \"Druma Lodge\" whenever somebody mentioned Druma,\
  \ lodges, money, or a host of other keywords that we have developed since then.\
  \ The esteemed contributor and <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ author Thurston Hillman was among the more...rambunctious participants, and after\
  \ the game we got to talking about how the Society had done so little in Druma and\
  \ what a Druman adventure <span class=\"messageboard-ooc\">[Druma Lodge!]</span>\
  \ might look like. <a href=\"/products/btpy9k95\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #7-22: Bid for Alabastrine</em></a> has grown and evolved in really amazing ways\
  \ since then, including the incorporation of some Serpents Rise metaplot, so if\
  \ you have a Spoils of the Siege boon, it might pay to have it on hand to show the\
  \ GM during this adventure. As fair warning, this Tier 1-5 adventure features both\
  \ roleplaying and dealing with people whose outfits cost more than your PC might\
  \ earn by 10th level. Be prepared to hobnob with the high'n'mighty—including these\
  \ two kalistocrats depicted by Marko Horvatin—but keep an eye out for danger!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The uninitiated might assume that I invite editors to write adventures\
  \ because their manuscripts are pristine and a delight to develop. Although that's\
  \ true, I've also found that Paizo's editors—including Justin Juan with <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy95eb\">#5-21: \"The Merchant's Wake\"</a> and Joe Homes in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9ch1\">#6-17: \"Fires of Karamoss\"</a>—are among the more creative\
  \ narrators and insightful creators to work on the campaign. This time I was especially\
  \ familiar with editor <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lha8\">Jason Keeley's</a>\
  \ work on the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics</a> backmatter and his discerning feedback while editing scenarios,\
  \ so I felt that this was the guy who could handle a high-level adventure set on\
  \ another plane. I have since confirmed how delightfully inventive he can be, especially\
  \ in portraying otherworldly NPCs. <a href=\"/products/btpy9k96\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-23: Abducted in Aether</em></a> concludes the Master of Spells\
  \ mini-arc of Season 7 and features several popular NPCs, including the commanding\
  \ night hag depicted here by Dion Harris (who has also created the excellent artwork\
  \ for the earlier parts of this story).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n  \

  \ href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon's</a> not complete without a special event. In addition\
  \ to <a href=\"/products/btpy9ctz\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-97: Siege\
  \ of Serpents</em></a>, last year players had the special opportunity in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9cu0\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a>\
  \ to portray capable Aspis Consortium agents who got to (figuratively and literally)\
  \ punch Pathfinders in the face. I've really enjoyed hearing from players about\
  \ their experience with the accompanying pregenerated characters and how they hoped\
  \ to see those characters appear again in the organized play storyline. Over the\
  \ course of Season 7, authors have helped us incorporate this motley cast into several\
  \ more adventures, and it only made sense to get the gang back together for one\
  \ more epic heist in <a href=\"/products/btpy9lzy\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a>. And epic it is. Even if you're not terribly familiar\
  \ with the campaign setting, there's a lot of action, a splash of intrigue, and\
  \ hefty serving of the unexpected. If you enjoy the organized play metaplot, keep\
  \ an eye out for all sorts of extras that might hint at what's happening elsewhere\
  \ in the world and what is to come. This was an absolute blast to write (including\
  \ the *ahem* lovable Iaovin Ratarion, depicted here by Javier Charro), and I hope\
  \ folks enjoy playing and GMing it.</p> \n     <p>In fact, I might need to assemble\
  \ another group of yahoos to do just that. You'll know it's us because while everyone\
  \ else in the room is signing Chronicle sheets, we'll still be stuck on the first\
  \ scene thanks to having spent hours designing a team uniform, hiding bodies, and\
  \ coming up with elaborate plans to attack buildings that have nothing to do with\
  \ the adventure. <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> is great like that.</p> \n \
