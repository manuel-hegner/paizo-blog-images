  date\">Monday, May 2, 2011</p> \n   <p>In August 2010, Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play entered the Year of the Shadow Lodge, and the ongoing conflict with this\
  \ separatist splinter group within the Pathfinder Society has been a consistent\
  \ plot element in many of the season's scenarios. We've seen prominent members of\
  \ the Society and at least one faction betray the Decemvirate, and the Shadow Lodge\
  \ conflict only gets more twisted as we wrap up to the dramatic conclusion at PaizoCon.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In August, with the launch of Season 3, Pathfinders the world over will\
  \ embark on the most exciting Pathfinder Society adventure yet, a metaplot arc we've\
  \ named the <b>Year of the Ruby Phoenix</b>.</p> \n   <table align=\"right\" border=\"\

  \   <p>In the Year of the Ruby Phoenix, the Pathfinder Society (as well as various\
  \ other factions both allied with and opposed to the Society) set their sights on\
  \ the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, a world-renowned fighting competition that occurs\
  \ only once a decade in distant Tian Xia, and more specifically on the incredible\
  \ collection of prizes available to the tournament's victor. In order to cement\
  \ the Society's victory, Pathfinder agents will be sent throughout the Inner Sea\
  \ and beyond to collect allies, uncover obscure lore, and retrieve magical weapons\
  \ to augment their representatives in the tournament.</p> \n   <p>The search for\
  \ the perfect \"ringer\" will culminate in the tournament itself, which will be\
  \ released as an as-yet-unannounced <i>Pathfinder Module: The Ruby Phoenix Tournament</i>,\
  \ which will continue the pattern of being sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play.\
  \ After the PCs' inevitable victory, the treasure chosen by the Decemvirate as the\
  \ prize awarded to them by their representatives' win will propel the adventure\
  \ into unexplored territory for the remainder of the season!</p> \n   <p>The Year\
  \ of the Ruby Phoenix kicks off at Gen Con with four all-new scenarios! RPG Superstar\
  \ 2010 finalist Jim Groves brings us <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8kab\"><i>The Frostfur\
  \ Captives</i></a> for levels 1–5. RPG Superstar contestants Dennis Baker and Benjamin\
  \ Bruck have authored the Tier 3–7 scenario <a href=\"/store/ v5748btpy8kac\"><i>Sewer\
  \ Dragons of Absalom</i></a> and the Tier 7–11 scenario <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8kae\"\
  ><i>The Kortos Envoy</i></a>, respectively. And the master of the dungeon crawl,\
  \ Mike Shel, rounds out the quartet with his Tier 5–9 romp, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8kad\"\
  ><i>The Ghenett Manor Gauntlet</i></a>.</p> \n   <div align=\"right\">\n    <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Logos/GenCon_180.jpeg\" align=\"right\">\n   </div> \n  \
  \ <p>As if that weren't enough, Pathfinders attending Gen Con (and special conventions\
  \ thereafter) will have the chance to qualify the Pathfinder Society for the Ruby\
  \ Phoenix Tournament in the underground pit fights of <i>Pathfinder Society Special:\
  \ Blood Under Absalom</i> by veteran special designer Tim Hitchcock.</p> \n   <p>As\
  \ if being the first to play these incredible adventures weren't enough, for the\
  \ first time ever, we'll have opportunities for Pathfinder Society players and GMs\
  \ to play a role in establishing Pathfinder Society canon, win special unique prizes\
  \ from the Paizo store, and even a giant grand prize that we'll be announcing in\
  \ the coming weeks. The <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lc4v\">call for volunteer\
  \ GMs</a> has gone out and registration for events through Gen Con are just around\
  \ the corner! Don't miss your chance to be among the first to take part in the Year\
  \ of the Ruby Phoenix.</p> \n   <p>Next week we'll take a look at the Osirion faction\
  \ and what might be in store for those Pathfinders loyal to the Ruby Prince and\
  \ the Sapphire Sage, Amenopheus!</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n\
