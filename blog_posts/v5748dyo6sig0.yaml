  \ the final days before the release, we’re getting to the end of these preview blogs,\
  \ but we figured there’s <em>probably</em> still a few things we can talk about.\
  \ How about orcs and the updated mixed ancestry rules?</p> \n     <p>Orcs are a\
  \ common ancestry now, and appear among the <em>Player Core</em> options alongside\
  \ dwarves, goblins, elves, humans, etc. This reflects not just a mechanical change,\
  \ but also the ever-evolving state of our lore. With the undead hordes of the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant seething outwards from the Gravelands, the orcs of Belkzen have seen their\
  \ home transformed into one of the primary battlegrounds, raising their axes and\
  \ torches high to fend off the encroaching darkness.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ by Gabriel Scavariello</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>In becoming the vanguard of\
  \ one of the greatest ongoing struggles threatening the Inner Sea, Belkzen’s orcs\
  \ have also formed an ever-increasing number of alliances with their neighbors—\
  something that is a source of contention for some of the less friendly holds…but\
  \ that’s a story for later!</p> \n     <p>To help our new orcish allies with their\
  \ battles, we’ve brushed up a few of their feats, as well. The old Hold Mark feat\
  \ wasn’t great, especially in the context of some of the improvements we’ve made\
  \ to ancestry feats; the Orc Weapon Familiarity feat now automatically gives you\
  \ the benefits that used to require taking Orc Weapon Carnage as soon as you hit\
  \ 5th level, without needing to spend any further feats. So, we reworked Hold Mark\
  \ into a new 1st-level feat based on some of the orc holds of Belkzen that gives\
  \ you training in a key skill and a constant bonus to saves against a specific type\
  \ of magic—which does stack with the bonus from Orc Superstition, if you want to\
  \ go that route, allowing orcs to be particularly resilient against certain types\
  \ of magic!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/822a8625-9457-4a66-befa-64ef3aafe487/PZO12001_HoldMark.png\"\

  \ or other fiery symbol, while the Empty Hand could be a fist of claw)\"></a> \n\
  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <p>As orcish heroes\
  \ have spread across the Inner Sea, the opportunities for heroes of mixed orcish\
  \ ancestry to carve out a place for themselves have also multiplied. Dromaars, as\
  \ children of mixed orc and human ancestry are known in Belkzen, are one of the\
  \ mixed ancestry examples provided in <em>Player Core</em>. The word dromaar is\
  \ an orcish word, referring to those drummers whose music sends the hordes marching\
  \ to war; many of the current generation of dromaar adventurers view themselves\
  \ as heralds of a new age for orcs in the Inner Sea region.</p> \n     <p>While\
  \ most dromaars from Belkzen have either one human parent and one orc parent or\
  \ two dromaar parents, dromaars from other parts of Golarion might have some other\
  \ ancestral mix; orcs and dwarves in Arcadia, for example, have a much more cooperative\
  \ history together than the orc and dwarf nations of the Inner Sea, and it’s possible\
  \ that the dromaars on that continent might have a significant population whose\
  \ ancestry is of mixed dwarf and orc descent.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  t the only example of a mixed ancestry presented in <em>Player Core</em>; aiuvarins\
  \ are people of mixed elven ancestry, typically having a human parent on one side\
  \ and an elven parent on the other, though other mixes are entirely possible.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While introducing the aiuvarins, we took the opportunity to clean up\
  \ some confusion around options like the Elf Atavism feat, which had some unclear\
  \ interactions with things like the Ancient Elf heritage.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ on or improves an elven feature you don't have. For example, you couldn't take\
  \ the Ancient Elf heritage (page 47) unless your non-elf  ancestry also has a lifespan\
  \ measured in multiple centuries. In these cases, at the GM's discretion, you might\
  \ gain a different benefit.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Previously we’d presented options like aiuvarin and dromaar\
  \ as human heritages, specifically half-elves and half-orcs. By pulling them out\
  \ of the human ancestry and making them the first two heritages of the new Mixed\
  \ Ancestry option, we open up a whole new world of possible options to customize\
  \ your characters and your worlds. Currently, if you want to make a new Mixed Ancestry\
  \ that represents people of partial dwarven, gnome, goblin, or other descent, you’\
  ll need to use the example set by the aiuvarin and dromaar heritages to create your\
  \ own, but in days to come I wouldn’t be surprised to see more mixed ancestry options\
  \ appearing as we push back the edges of the map and do deeper explorations of Golarion’\
  s other continents.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
