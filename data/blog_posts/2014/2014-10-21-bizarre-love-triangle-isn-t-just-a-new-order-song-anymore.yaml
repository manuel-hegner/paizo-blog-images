              <p class="date">Tuesday, October 21, 2014</p>
              <div itemprop="articleBody">
               <p itemprop="description">Ahoy, me hearties! It seems like only yesterday that I wrote a blog for you, but here I am again. In actuality it was three weeks ago, but I have an incredibly bad concept of time that has passed so I had to check. And if you don't believe me, you can check <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgjd">here</a>.</p>
               <p>Anyway, we're nearly on to <a href="/products/btpy965x"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Deck 3: Tempest Rising</em></a>! We're zipping through these adventures faster than a flying fish on uppers. As usual, I'll be sharing some of my favorite cards and giving you the inside scoop on one of our scenarios. But first, I must apologize. If I seem a little distracted to you, it's because I am. Somehow, a gigantic fly has gotten into my house and is buzzing around me. Every time I get focused, this fly dive bombs me and I flail around trying to bat it out of the air like some sort of drunk cat. And sometimes I drop my laptop. Le sigh. But this is what I go through to get you some insider info on Skull &amp; Shackles. You may be thinking that it would just be better for me to head to a coffee shop down the street but that would be LETTING THAT BUZZY LITTLE JERK WIN. And that, I simply can't stand.</p>
               <p>On to a happier place... sharks.</p>
               <h2>OSS (Obligatory Shark Section)</h2>
               <p>Dun... dun.</p>
               <p>Dun... dun.</p>
               <p>Dun dun dundundun. That's right, you scallywags, we've got a great white shark.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-GreatWhite.jpg"><img src="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-GreatWhite_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>It might be easier on everyone if you just gave up now. This won't be getting any easier.</em>
               </div>
               <p>It make look like some blood vapors are escaping his mouth but I think he's been smoking some sort of weird hookah with red smoke. It's definitely not blood. Because the Great White Shark would never hurt you. Unless you encounter him. Which you will because you can't evade him. Wah wah. It's hard to be you, isn't it?</p>
               <h2>Some Other Totally Rad Stuff</h2>
               <p>The Great White Shark is as great as his name says, but there are some cards whose names aren't quite so obvious.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Werecrocodile.jpg"><img src="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Werecrocodile_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>Look at him in his stripey pants, Look at him! LOOK AT HIM!</em>
               </div>
               <p>You're in serious denial if you don't admit to loving this Werecrocodile. You best hope the moon isn't out or ol' stripeypants is gonna take a little bit more to defeat. But, seeing as how he's a reptile, he's a little sensitive to the cold, and adding that trait to your check will help you a bit. Unless somebody gets him some mittens and a hat. He'd look pretty great with those though, right?</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrocodileMittens.jpg"><img src="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-WerecrocodileMittens_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>Right.</em>
               </div>
               <p>This scenario also features a new type of card. We call it a Curse but you'll likely give it a different name. Probably a curse word. Aahahaha. But seriously. Don't get stuck with one of these. I'm not going to say more about it because I think it pretty much speaks for itself.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Curse.jpg"><img src="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Curse_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>This is not really what you want.</em>
               </div>
               <p>Up until now, Structural damage has sort of been a thing but it's been pretty manageable, right? The days of manageable Structural damage are over. This adventure has a lot of particularly nasty barriers that are all about the Structural damage. Take for instance, the Cannonade.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Cannonade.jpg"><img src="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-Cannonade_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>KABOOM!</em>
               </div>
               <p>Yes, dear readers, you read that correctly. The Cannonade is a Veteran barrier and you're not getting away without taking at least 2 Structural damage. That's not all, though! There are several more barriers just as nasty as this one. And a couple are even henchmen so you know you'll get to see them a bunch! Huzzah!</p>
               <p>I admit, rubbing your face in those barriers was a little mean. So, here. Take a look at this loot blessing.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-PirateFavor.jpg"><img src="http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6013-PirateFavor_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br><em>Monkey in a scarf alert!!!</em>
               </div>
               <p>There's something funny about those traits... what is it though? Oh right, it's our first blessing without the Divine trait. That's pretty crazy! And you might be able to play a second blessing on the check you use this on! And just look at all those ways to recharge this thing! This blessing should rock your socks. And if you're not wearing socks, put some on so you can have your socks rocked. For reals.</p>
               <h2>Bizarre Love Triangle</h2>
               <p>It's a story as old as time. Boy goes to grocery store. Girl goes to grocery store. They do their shopping, almost bumping into each other multiple times, but always just missing until they both reach for the same sea cucumber. Meet cute. Boy and Girl fall in love. Boy and Girl get in a fight. Boy and Girl take a break. Boy meets Gal. Boy and Girl upgrade break to break up. Boy gets house. Boy and Gal are happy. Boy ditches Gal to pursue other interests. Girl hates Boy. Gal loves Boy. Boy is busy pursuing other interests.</p>
               <p>I know, I know. Right now you're thinking, "You silly goose in the rigging, that doesn't really seem bizarre at all." You know what? You're right. Aside from the fact that Boy, Girl, and Gal are all water nagas and "pursuing other interests" actually means "killing any people that cross his path," that story is not bizarre in any way.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br><em>Sorry, Shonda Rimes, this crazy drama is already taken.</em>
               </div>
               <p>So. Let's get down to business. What actually happens in this scenario? Well, if you'll note on the scenario card, there aren't real henchmen in this scenario. We just have you shuffle some random monsters (even more chances for Stripeypants to be encountered!) so closing locations will be a bit more challenging than normal. Plus, you have to get these three crazy kids in the same place so they can sort out their issues. That's right, this scenario is an intervention.</p>
               <p>I can hear you scoffing through the internet, "So what if we have to burn through all the cards in a location deck and there are three villains? We're rockstars at this game!" Scoff no more, dear readers. Did you catch the part on the scenario about how if the villain can't escape to an open location you shuffle it into a random location and open it? I mean, obviously there's a strategy on how to do that properly but that's up to you to figure out. There's also the part where if all three villains aren't in the same location deck, you haven't defeated the villain...no matter how good your roll was. Toodle-loo blessings deck! It was nice knowing you!</p>
               <p>We’ve sort of been ignoring our three villains thus far and if there’s one thing I know about water nagas, it’s that they hate to be ignored. Let’s start with Boy, or as you will come to know him, Munarei. Munarei is probably smarter than you. He’s gonna deal you some Mental damage before you even act and after that you’ll have to try and outsmart him. I don’t know about you but I would rather punch Munarei rather than try to make an Intelligence or Knowledge 10 check. But wait, there’s more! If your check isn't at least a 7, the top card of your deck, you know, the one you’re just itching to draw, well, that gets buried. Oof. Maybe Girl and Gal will be nicer.</p>
               <p>Girl, AKA Sarlis, is a little peeved with Munarei. The good news is, this means she’s sort of willing to accept your help to get back her lair. All it takes is a Charisma or Diplomacy 10 check! I mean, she’s still going to deal you some damage before you act (Force damage, to be accurate) and if you fail by 3 or more you’re going to be burying that tasty top card of your deck. Hell hath no fury like a water naga scorned.</p>
               <p>And last, but not least, there’s Selissa, who we’ve called Gal up until now. She’s still completely enamored with Munarei for some reason. And you trying to fight her and herd her over to the same location as the others is only distracting her from mooning over Munarei. So yeah, she’s a little mad at you too. She’ll be slapping you with some Poison damage, and of course, the top card of your deck is still quite vulnerable. But, after a Wisdom or Survival 10 check, you’ll be sitting pretty (but not as pretty as Munarei!).</p>
               <p>So, we've now given you a murdery, monster-filled soap opera to play through. At the end you'll get a card feat, though. And we all know how deliciousssss card featsss are. Umm, sorry. Been spending a little too much time trying to think like a water naga. At any rate, I think you've got a pretty decent look at what's heading your way in <a href="/products/btpy965x">Adventure 3</a> and I only dropped my laptop twice! As always, thanks for reading and here's hoping to a mutiny-free month for you!</p>
