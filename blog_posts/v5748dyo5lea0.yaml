  \ Andrew Murphy</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Still Life with Snuffbox</h2> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>I have never been so grateful for vinegar in\
  \ my life.</p> \n    <p>Norret had taught me, as part of the science of perfumery,\
  \ that there were seven basic scents. One of them, putrescence, was necessary in\
  \ any truly fine perfume, but only the faintest note.</p> \n    <p>Putrescence was\
  \ found in stinkhorn fungi and the carrion flowers of the Mwangi Expanse, but most\
  \ commonly in putrescine and cadaverine, alchemical substances that came from corpses.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We were in the Gray District, the necropolis\
  \ in the southeastern corner of Korvosa. More specifically, we were in Potter's\
  \ Ward, the southeastern corner of that, used for the graves of the poor. The air\
  \ was filled with greasy smoke. It smelled like someone was cooking rotting pork\
  \ and it had caught fire. Except that in this case it was long pork. The only thing\
  \ that smelled worse than the burning corpses were the ones that weren't yet burnt.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Some of those even stumbled around. I think they were zombies–I hope\
  \ they were zombies–because the other alternative was that gravediggers and priestesses\
  \ of Pharasma were beating still-living plague victims with shovels and setting\
  \ them on fire.</p> \n    <p>I clutched my pomander orange and inhaled the floral\
  \ notes of tansy and thyme, the camphoraceous notes of rosemary and lavender, the\
  \ minty note of mint, and the sweet pungency of apple cider vinegar.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Wizards are utterly mad, Rhodel,\" I told my spirit guide, or possibly the empty\
  \ air. \"Even crazier than alchemists.\" I held the pomander against the stench.\
  \ \"A 'keepsake,' Dr. Orontius said. A memento to remember his beloved school chum.…\
  \" I snorted and was immediately sorry because I'd snorted vinegar. Then I was less\
  \ sorry because, once my eyes stopped watering, I realized I couldn't smell anything.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I glanced at another corpse and checked Norret's picture of Zharmides\
  \ the Godless.</p> \n    <p>Nella had told us more about Zharmides, a convert to\
  \ the Rahadoum heresies who spiced his divination lectures with tart comments on\
  \ the gods, calling Blackfingers a two-bit snake-oil salesman and Pharasma a schoolmarm\
  \ with an attendance fetish.</p> \n    <p>Nella wouldn't repeat what he said about\
  \ Asmodeus other than mentioning that one particular string of blasphemies had reportedly\
  \ made an imp faint.</p> \n    <p>I was sorry that he was dead, and even more sorry\
  \ I wasn't finding his body. That was my job while Norret ran interference, helping\
  \ the priests and priestesses of Pharasma blow up the zombies that seemed to be\
  \ rising with some regularity. Our story was that we'd been sent to help by the\
  \ temple of Shelyn, not that anyone seemed inclined to check.</p> \n    <p>When\
  \ I wasn't looking at corpses, I amused myself—if that's the right word—by examining\
  \ the potsherds the Potter's Ward was named for. Norret's art tourists' map noted\
  \ that some believed the bits of broken crockery littering the soil went back to\
  \ the time of the Shoanti. </p> \n    <p>I assumed this was a more relaxing pastime\
  \ when there weren't zombies lurching around. Someone else with wild hair and glassy\
  \ eyes lurched toward me, except this man had a wheelbarrow filled with fresh bodies.\
  \ I was about to examine them when I took note of the gravedigger's brocade waistcoat.\
  \ Not only was it too fine a garment for gravedigging, but it was covered with stylized\
  \ Zs. Unfortunately, the pockets were all flat. Even the pocket square was gone.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Where'd you get your waistcoat?\" I asked.</p> \n    <p>The gravedigger\
  \ beamed. \"The master gave it to me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Who's your master?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He paused, then said swiftly, \"I have no master.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then\
  \ whom do you work for?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I work for the Church of Pharasma. I am\
  \ a simple fellow. I dig graves.\" His voice was as flat as a zombie's, assuming\
  \ zombies could speak. He attempted to push past me with the barrow full of plague-raddled\
  \ corpses. \"Please move. I must bury these bodies.\"</p> \n    <p>To say that he\
  \ was acting strange was an understatement. \"Did you by any chance find a snuffbox?\
  \ A little ivory one with gold fittings, same monogram on the bottom as you've got\
  \ on your vest?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh yes. The— He was very pleased to get it. Said\
  \ every nobleman should have one.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So where's your master?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I have no master.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Could you take me to your master?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The gravedigger looked puzzled, then tortured. At last he whispered,\
  \ \"Only if you're one of the faithful?\" His eyebrows rose hopefully.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"If I said that I was?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then I would ask you for the password.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"What's the password?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-RhodelsGhost.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-RhodelsGhost_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> Rhodel certainly makes an attractive ghost.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"I'm\
  \ not allowed to say.\" He looked frightened. \"I am a simple fellow. I dig graves.\
  \ Please move. I must bury these bodies.\"</p> \n    <p>I stepped aside. My skin\
  \ prickled as if a whole gaggle of geese were walking over my grave, and I've been\
  \ dead so I know what that feels like. I went to Norret and told him about my conversation.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Drugged or enchanted,\" he concluded. \"Duke Devore's formulary has\
  \ a recipe for hypnotic perfume, but...\" My brother flipped one of his monocles\
  \ down and peered at the gravedigger. \"Definitely enchanted. Mind-controlled—I've\
  \ seen it on the battlefield. Give someone too many contradictory orders and the\
  \ mind starts to break.\"</p> \n    <p>I didn't know if he was talking military\
  \ orders or magical ones, or if there was much of a difference. \"How do we find\
  \ his 'master'?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We keep an eye on him and an ear out for this 'password.'\"\
  </p> \n    <p>When my brother said \"keep an ear out,\" he meant this literally.\
  \ He swigged some tincture of wolfsbane and grew ears as long and pointed as a wolf's.\
  \ A bit of eavesdropping and spying on the addled gravedigger later, he said, \"\
  I am famished.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're hungry?\" I gasped, still holding my pomander\
  \ against the stench.</p> \n    <p>\"No, 'I am famished.' That's the password.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>It certainly wasn't one that easily sprang to mind, especially with\
  \ how I'd lost any trace of my appetite, given the reeking corpses. But with that\
  \ last clue, everything about the strange man fell into place. \"I guess that tells\
  \ us what he meant by a 'one of the faithful,' then?\"</p> \n    <p>Norret nodded.\
  \ \"It would seem that the grave digger—or whoever's controlling him—is a worshiper\
  \ of Urgathoa, goddess of gluttony and undeath.\"</p> \n    <p>I shuddered, but\
  \ it made sense. Who else would be hungry in a graveyard?</p> \n    <p>Once the\
  \ sun had set, our pomander oranges began to glow with will-o'-wisp light like little\
  \ moons. We dodged one last patrol of Pharasmins as the priests swept the necropolis\
  \ before locking the gates for the night–plague or no plague, even priests of the\
  \ goddess of death needed sleep, especially after the day they'd had. Norret and\
  \ I, on the other hand, would get no sleep, not just because of where we were but\
  \ because Norret had prepared a pot of coffee Woodsedge-style—half coffee, half\
  \ roasted chicory root.</p> \n    <p>We picked our way across the Potter's Ward,\
  \ trailing the gravedigger and a cortege of figures we presumed were cultists. We\
  \ hopped a low fence into Everyman's Ward, and finally slipped past a loose bar\
  \ in the spike-tipped iron fence that led to the Gold Ward where the nobility were\
  \ interred. Being a Galtan, it soothed my soul somewhat to know that the Urgathoans\
  \ were desecrating the tombs of the nobility rather prying into graves of the common\
  \ man, not that I think they were making that distinction.</p> \n    <p>Most of\
  \ the mausoleums in the Gold Ward were grand affairs, with polished brass knobs,\
  \ cypress wreaths, and even freshly cut flowers placed in urns outside. One mausoleum\
  \ looked decidedly seedy and unkempt, neglected for many years, the doors falling\
  \ off their hinges and the only flowers being weeds and lichen growing through cracks\
  \ in the marble façade. The name Galdur was carved above the doors, and the last\
  \ cultist was disappearing down the steps.</p> \n    <p>We followed and were greeted\
  \ at the bottom by a lady in a tattered spattered gown like from the nursery rhyme.\
  \ Her black hair was an obvious wig, though her ghoulish teeth were real enough,\
  \ having been filed to points. The cultist smiled, letting us get an even better\
  \ look.</p> \n    <p>\"I am famished,\" I said, and Norret did as well.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Then you are welcome in Urgathoa's Hall!\" She smiled as if welcoming us\
  \ to a holiday party. \"You must call me Deaconess Gentle. How should I know you?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I'm Orlin, and this is my brother, Norret.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh,\
  \ an artist!\" She took delighted note of Norret's folding easel and the multicolored\
  \ alchemical stains on his clothes. \"You must paint a portrait to immortalize this\
  \ celebration.\"</p> \n    <p>Norret nodded in hasty agreement.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  So, what have you brought for Urgathoa's feast?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Brought?\" I repeated.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"An offering to share! An unholy delicacy for us to consume for the\
  \ delight of the Pallid Princess!\"</p> \n    <p>I thought, then remembered my little\
  \ horn spoon. \"How about unicorn bone porridge?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Delightful!\"\
  \ exclaimed the cultist. \"Did the beast scream as it was butchered?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I don't know. It died a long time ago.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well aged, then.\"\
  \ She turned to Norret.</p> \n    <p>\"I brought coffee.\"</p> \n    <p>She rolled\
  \ her eyes but merely said, \"Mistress Kissim brought funeral biscuits. I'm certain\
  \ they will go well together.\" She gestured to one corner of the crypt. \"I think\
  \ you might set your easel up there. It will have the best view of the festivities.\
  \ Do we need more candles?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, the shadows are just right,\" Norret\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>\"Well,\" the deaconess allowed, \"none of them are hungry,\
  \ but I'm certain that can be remedied later. I'm just so pleased we have an artist.\
  \ Please, come in.\"</p> \n    <p>Norret nodded and did.</p> \n    <p>I might have\
  \ expected many things of the cult of Urgathoa, but one thing I did not expect was\
  \ a demented potluck. Cultists were milling about, placing food on the old sarcophagi\
  \ like they were artists arranging still lifes—should the skull go beside the cheese\
  \ tray or on top of it?—and everyone was chatting as if they'd gathered in some\
  \ Isarn salon for a Crystalhue feast rather than in an abandoned Korvosan crypt\
  \ for the blasphemous rites of the Pallid Princess.</p> \n    <p>Deaconess Gentle\
  \ peered up the stairs. \"Is there anyone else?\"</p> \n    <p>\"One more.\" The\
  \ scent of roses and ectoplasm replaced the musty odor of the crypt. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>Beside us appeared a vision of loveliness, a girl of no more than sixteen summers\
  \ garbed in a green and ivory festival gown, a garland of pink noisette roses plaited\
  \ into her golden hair. I'd only seen my spirit guide in this world once, when I\
  \ was poisoned, but necromancers had told Norret and me that spirits had an easier\
  \ time appearing to the doomed or the dying, or in certain places where the veil\
  \ between worlds wore thin.</p> \n    <p>I hoped it was the third possibility, or\
  \ at least that \"doom\" was more a warning than a certainty.</p> \n    <p>\"How\
  \ lovely you are!\" The priestess clasped my spirit guide's hands, but not quite.\
  \ \"How may I know you?\" </p> \n    <p>\"Call me Rhodel.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It is\
  \ an honor to be graced by one of the incorporeal. Lord Galdur had feared that he\
  \ would be the only one here to celebrate an ashenmorn.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah nae.\"\
  \ Rhodel laughed. \"Orlin slipped his grave too.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed?\" said\
  \ Deaconess Gentle, blinking at me. \"I took you for a living child. Forgive me.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"No need,\" I said truthfully.</p> \n    <p>\"You shall have the\
  \ place of honor.\" The priestess showed me to a chair at the upper left corner\
  \ of the central sarcophagus, seating Rhodel just to the right of me before taking\
  \ her place at the head of the \"table.\" It was covered with a funeral pall. Seated\
  \ opposite me was a rakishly handsome young man with dark hair, pale skin, and mismatched\
  \ finery. Being from Galt, I was familiar with the look. It was what happened when\
  \ you raided the wardrobes of dead nobles and had no eye for taste.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Now, Master?\" asked the gravedigger groveling at his side.</p> \n    <p>\"Now,\
  \ Alfoun.\"</p> \n    <p>The gravedigger whisked away the pall like a waiter uncovering\
  \ a tray. I tried not to look at what was on the slab–<i>who</i> was on the slab–\
  not wanting to see another plague-ravaged corpse. But then I did and I realized\
  \ that, apart from liver spots, there were no marks on the old man's naked body.\
  \ The mouth was open in a death rictus. Even so, I recognized it. I had been looking\
  \ at it all day. It was the face of Zharmides the Godless.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, one\
  \ without the plague!\" Deaconess Gentle exclaimed delightedly. \"Wherever did you\
  \ find it, Lord Galdur?\"</p> \n    <p>The young nobleman smiled, revealing pronounced\
  \ eyeteeth, and petted the gravedigger like a faithful dog. \"Good Alfoun brought\
  \ it to me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Urgathoa has truly blessed us! Much as I enjoy the\
  \ fruits of the season, it's nice to have a little variety.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Shall\
  \ I have the kiss of undeath now, master?\" the gravedigger begged.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No!\" cried the pretty young woman seated to his left. \"You swore your next bride\
  \ would be me!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Patience, dear ones. Go eat some rats.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>He said this last just forcefully enough. They both scurried off to one\
  \ of the lower tables where one of the other cultists had indeed brought rats, roasted\
  \ on a stick.</p> \n    <p>\"There is a chair free now, my lovely.\" Lord Galdur\
  \ gestured.</p> \n    <p>Rhodel vanished from her chair and reappeared in the one\
  \ at his side.</p> \n    <p>Deaconess Gentle made brief introductions, then told\
  \ Rhodel, \"I'm so embarrassed. We didn't expect any of the incorporeal. How might\
  \ we feed your pain?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Mayhaps a li'l pinch a snuff?\" Rhodel asked.\
  \ \"Loved it in life 'n I kin still smell it in death.\"</p> \n    <p>Deaconess\
  \ Gentle looked perturbed, but Lord Galdur reached into his pocket and gallantly\
  \ produced a snuffbox. <i>The</i> snuffbox. Ivory, carved with lions and lilies.\
  \ Even the stylized Z on the bottom. \"A nobleman never goes anywhere without it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Ah, how pretty!\" Rhodel exclaimed. \"Lemme guess yer name. Is it\
  \ Zander? Zaries?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's Tyrnan,\" he said smoothly, \"the fourth\
  \ of that name. But I inherited this from my great uncle, Zellin Galdur.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>I realized then that the vampire was a fraud—and likely about more than\
  \ just the snuffbox. I suspected that if he had any noble blood in him at all, it\
  \ was only because he'd drunk it.</p> \n    <p>\"I've been ta the other side. I've\
  \ met Tyrnan Galdur. All four.\" Rhodel took the snuffbox from him—actually, physically\
  \ took it—and smiled. \"Yer not him.\"</p> \n    <p>The vampire hissed like a cat,\
  \ fangs bared, but this wasn't very frightening to a ghost. \"And you, milady? Who\
  \ are you, appearing like a Shelynite doxy at Urgathoa's feast!?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Ah,\" said Rhodel, \"ye found me out. 'Tis true. I loved the Rose mosta' all. But\
  \ I lived a long life, an' I prayed ta the Pallid Princess there at the end.\" As\
  \ she said this, she grew older and older, the lines of age and care appearing on\
  \ her face, then the sores of hag pox, the harlot's curse. \"Kith me, handsome!\"\
  \ she slurred, her odor of roses turning to alcohol, anise, and the stench of sulfur\
  \ as she grabbed him in a clench. Then she caught fire and exploded in a flash of\
  \ fireworks and ectoplasm.</p> \n    <p>The vampire shouted and stood, his chair\
  \ clattering behind him.</p> \n    <p>I felt something appear in my hands. It was\
  \ the snuffbox, sticky with ectoplasm. I quickly put it in my pocket.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Deaconess Gentle retrieved her wig from where it had been blown off in the\
  \ explosion. Beneath it, her hair was stringy and white. \"The incorporeal—always\
  \ so dramatic!\" she exclaimed to the assembled cultists.</p> \n    <p>\"Where is\
  \ she?\" hissed the vampire. \"Where's my snuffbox?\"</p> \n    <p>The priestess\
  \ tugged the edge of his coat. \"Lord Galdur, please. The ritual.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ vampire sat, glaring at me.</p> \n    <p>Deaconess Gentle placed one hand on my\
  \ shoulder, then addressed her congregation, \"My famished ones, this is Orlin.\
  \ He's brought us a special delicacy. What was it again, dear?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Um, unicorn bone porridge.\"</p> \n    <p>Appreciative sounds issued from the cultists.\
  \ The pretty woman who wanted to be a vampire brought me a bowl. I tried to ignore\
  \ the fact that it was made from the top of a human skull and placed the little\
  \ horn spoon inside.</p> \n    <p>Thick pasty gruel welled up. Norret had tried\
  \ to make it look and taste like blancmange, but it only did insomuch as blanched\
  \ almond pudding looked similar to stewed unicorn bones.</p> \n    <p>I offered\
  \ the bowl to the priestess. She took a delicate bite. \"It... has a lovely texture,\"\
  \ she said politely. \"Like rotten brains.\"</p> \n    <p>I was less disturbed than\
  \ I should have been. \"It's a little bland,\" I admitted.</p> \n    <p>She smiled.\
  \ \"I believe Lord Galdur may have a solution.\" She turned to him. \"Might Orlin\
  \ borrow your talisman?\"</p> \n    <p>The vampire set down the glass of blood he\
  \ had been draining from Zharmides' arm and addressed his priestess. \"Does he have\
  \ any skill as a chef?\"</p> \n    <p>\"A little,\" I admitted.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Marvelous.\" He greeted me with a predatory smile. \"Behold this talisman, sacred\
  \ to the Pallid Princess.\" He reached up to his neck and touched his lavalier.\
  \ \"It makes the blood of the dead taste as sweet as that of the living.\" The pendant\
  \ was amethyst, dark as Hymbrian grapes, a six-sided natural crystal capped with\
  \ silver filigree in the shape of flies. \"In the hands of a true chef, it can also\
  \ produce sugar, salt, and spice. Yet that is not its only virtue. When touched\
  \ by the undead, the Princess's crystal becomes the pure purple of royalty.\" He\
  \ unclasped the chain, and held it out, then dropped it to pool on Zharmides' dead\
  \ chest. \"When touched by those bereft of Her blessing, it turns pale.\" The crystal\
  \ clouded and color leached from it, transmuting from amethyst to milky quartz,\
  \ white as leprosy. \"But when touched by the living, it turns as pink as a baby's\
  \ cheek.\"</p> \n    <p>The vampire bared his fangs in a feral grin. \"Although\
  \ you appear alive, Orlin, you smell of vinegar, like my cousins from the east.\"\
  \ He stared at my neck. \"Tell me, does your head come off?\"</p> \n    <p>So far\
  \ as I knew, everybody's head came off when you applied a Final Blade. \"Yes, but\
  \ I'd prefer if it stayed where it is.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Just so,\" said the vampire.\
  \ \"I've heard it's troublesome to put your head back. But as youthful as I appear,\
  \ I am older than I look.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Same here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed,\"\
  \ agreed the vampire, \"but from what I know, my eastern cousins are all women,\
  \ not men. And never children. Touch the talisman and reveal Urgathoa's truth!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He was trying to command me like his rat-chewing lackeys. But it was\
  \ a litmus test. As awful as Urgathoa was, she still followed rules. The milky quartz\
  \ of the pallid crystal would turn to amethyst for the dead and rose quartz for\
  \ the living.</p> \n    <p>Of course, if you contaminated your sample, a litmus\
  \ test could yield a false positive or negative. \"Fine.\" I stood up and reached\
  \ for the crystal while under my breath I said, \"Rhodel....\"</p> \n    <p>My spirit\
  \ guide knew how to take a cue. I felt the cold touch as her hand overlaid mine.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I sat back down. While my fingers were closed around the crystal, they\
  \ weren't touching it. Rhodel's were. Slowly I saw it clear and change from lavender\
  \ to violet to deepest amethyst.</p> \n    <p>\"Blessed child of Urgathoa!\" cried\
  \ the priestess.</p> \n    <p>The vampire sulked, even more so when I asked, \"\
  So what do I do now? Twist it like a pepper mill?\"</p> \n    <p>As I said the word\
  \ \"pepper,\" a sprinkle floated down over the bowl of unicorn bone porridge, just\
  \ like it had for Dr. Orontius. \"Does it do thileu bark?\" As I said it, it answered\
  \ my question.</p> \n    <p>\"If you add some fear's breath and hatefinger, I'll\
  \ take that bowl, please,\" said Deaconess Gentle.</p> \n    <p>I'd never heard\
  \ of these herbs, but Urgathoa's lavalier had, adding a sprinkle of each.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Just nightfog and bloodroot for my wine,\" \"Lord Galdur\" grumbled sourly,\
  \ holding out his glass of wizard blood.</p> \n    <p>Orders came in. It was almost\
  \ like I was back in Isarn dishing up breakfast for our boarders. I fixed myself\
  \ a bowl of porridge, seasoned it with sugar, cinnamon, and ginger, and tried to\
  \ pretend I wasn't eating out of the top of someone's skull. It did taste like mother's\
  \ blancmange now. </p> \n    <p>The festivities proceeded. Deaconess Gentle opened\
  \ some moldering tome titled <i>Serving Your Hunger</i>, which I'd initially taken\
  \ for a cookbook, and led the congregation in a ghastly chant made more horrid by\
  \ the fact that most of the cultists were off key. Then she had me sprinkle Zharmides\
  \ the Godless with thileu bark, after which she proceeded to pour Korvosan tawny\
  \ port over the wizard's corpse and began to dish up slices of meat.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ didn't know whether this was the fate the gods had designed for those who mocked\
  \ them or whether Zharmides had foreseen it and this explained his choice in religion.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As the cultists continued their ritual, I began noticing little oddities.\
  \ For all that she looked the part of a priestess, Deacon Gentle seemed to fumble\
  \ her way through the divine readings, sometimes stopping and having to repeat passages.\
  \ Though the other cultists ate with gusto, all bore normal human features, and\
  \ one or two even seemed a little queasy over the things they were shoving into\
  \ their mouths. Only the vampire was actually undead, and despite the way the humans\
  \ simpered and fawned over him, he too seemed to be trying hard to play a part—\
  that of the world-weary undead lord.</p> \n    <p><i>They're new at this</i>. The\
  \ realization struck me suddenly, and for a moment I felt a little sorry for them.\
  \ I wondered if their conversion was the result of the plague, or if they merely\
  \ hoped to be rewarded by the vampire. Either way, it was a pathetic scene.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Then one of them began gnawing at a loop of intestine, and my sympathy\
  \ evaporated.</p> \n    <p>I realized that Deaconess Gentle was looking expectantly\
  \ at me. She was holding an empty plate, waiting for me to request a cut.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Um, that's not how I... serve my hunger,\" I said as politely as I could,\
  \ hoping I was saying the right thing.</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed? And what would your\
  \ kind prefer?\"</p> \n    <p>Alarmed, I looked for Norret. The woman followed my\
  \ glance. \"Oh, the artist! Of course—he'll eat first, then you'll drink from his\
  \ veins. Splendid.\"</p> \n    <p>My brother came over and saw what he was expected\
  \ to do. Fortunately there was a line of cultists, and some were going back for\
  \ seconds.</p> \n    <p>I got his attention when the priestess went to pour more\
  \ port over Zharmides' body. I surreptitiously slipped my brother the damned snuffbox.\
  \ He put it in a pocket and handed me a vial, jerking his head towards the bottle\
  \ of port.</p> \n    <p>I unstoppered the vial and gripped it tight with my spirit's\
  \ hand. It glittered like a diamond as I raised it in the air, but the cultists\
  \ were distracted and drunk and didn't notice the drops dripping down as I added\
  \ to Zharmides' seasoning. For good measure, I made sure a few drops got into the\
  \ vampire's glass as well.</p> \n    <p>Then I pulled my spirit's hand back to my\
  \ physical hand and stole a glance at the empty vial, pondering the label, written\
  \ in Norret's neat handwriting: <i>Syrup of Ip</i>.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next\
