  \   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 7, 2012</p> \n   <div style=\"float: left;\
  \ padding: 0 1em 1em 0;\">\n    <a href=\"/products/btpy8qzx\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9244_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>When we started working on the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>\
  \ and Wes drew up his incredibly detailed map of the Shackles, we knew we’d have\
  \ to fill out this huge region if we wanted to do it any justice. Thanks to Mike\
  \ Shel and all the excellent work he did on <a href=\"/products/btpy8qzx\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Isles of the Shackles</i></a>, we had a cornucopia of locations\
  \ and adventure sites to put on the map. Factor in all the cool islands and seaside\
  \ towns visited throughout the Skull &amp; Shackles AP, and what we ended up with\
  \ is a lot of locations throughout the Shackles.</p> \n   <p>Like, a <i>lot</i>\
  \ of locations.</p> \n   <p>Each volume in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path\
  \ pinpoints the important islands visited in that adventure, and <i>Isles of the\
  \ Shackles</i> maps out the big islands detailed in that book and their major cities,\
  \ but beyond that, readers have yet to receive an exhaustive map that features all\
  \ of the heretofore mentioned locations in the Shackles. This blog post remedies\
  \ that.</p> \n   <p>The downloadable web supplement is a huge PDF map of the Shackles\
  \ featuring tags for all of the locations heretofore mentioned in Pathfinder products.\
  \ The map is highly spoiler-intensive since it gives the precise location for over\
  \ 150 islands, towns, and sites of interest throughout the Shackles. Thus, it should\
  \ go without saying that this map is meant only for those who aren’t players in\
  \ a Skull &amp; Shackles campaign or a campaign set in the Shackles. Otherwise,\
  \ this map will prove an indisputable boon for GMs and readers interested in the\
  \ Shackles who have no qualms with discovering each and every location in the region\
  \ in excruciating detail. You can find more information on all of these exotic and\
  \ often treacherous sites in <a href=\"/products/btpy8qzx\"><i>Isles of the Shackles</i></a>\
  \ and throughout the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
