  \ brewing and all of existence will be drawn into the conflict! As gods die, new\
  \ gods arise, and Golarion itself bucks and twists under the pressure of immortal\
  \ powers vying for dominance, we introduce two new classes with their own roles\
  \ to play in these colossal battles.</p> \n     <p>The <strong>animist</strong>\
  \ is a Wisdom-based divine spellcasting class that bonds with apparitions, ephemeral\
  \ spirits who share their power and knowledge with the animist in exchange for the\
  \ animist acting as their agent with the physical world. Bond with a Steward of\
  \ Stone and Fire to add primal power to your spellcasting, make a pact with an Impostor\
  \ in Hidden Places to gain access to sneaky and deceptive magics, or allow a Witness\
  \ to Ancient Battles possess you and lend its martial talents to your repertoire!\
  \ If you’re interested in playing a wise spellcaster who can change their abilities\
  \ each day— or even moment to moment—based on the spiritual entities they align\
  \ themselves with, be sure to playtest the animist!</p> \n     <p>The <strong>exemplar</strong>\
  \ is our first rare class, a Charisma-based divine warrior possessing their own\
  \ spark of divinity. The exemplar can move their divine spark between receptacles\
  \ called ikons to unlock potent effects and abilities. As your power grows, you\
  \ create your own epithet that defines your immortal legacy; whether you become\
  \ a Cunning exemplar who’s Restless as the Tides and known to be a Thief of Moonlight,\
  \ or a Brave exemplar, who’s Peerless Under Heaven and destined to be The Last Ruler\
  \ of an ancient kingdom, is up to you! If you’re interested in playing a demigod\
  \ destined for greatness and inspired by mythological figures like Maui, Cú Chulainn,\
  \ and Hercules, be sure to playtest the exemplar!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
