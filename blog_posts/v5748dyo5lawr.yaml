  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 29, 2010</p> \n   <p>It seems like I’m the\
  \ guy who usually ends up running the game, so when Sean announced that he was going\
  \ to run a high-level campaign where all the PCs would be demon-worshiping drow\
  \ nobles, I jumped at the chance to play. After all, high-level play, demons, and\
  \ drow are three of my favorite things! You got a first look into the mayhem of\
  \ our first session last week when Sean showed off his creepy black light, but today\
  \ I’m going to tell you about my character. Like it or not!</p> \n  </blockquote>\

  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><b>Alivorah Azrinae</b> (CE female drow noble bard 7/demoniac\
  \ 6) is something of a troublemaker, even in drow society. She's gotten in hot water\
  \ with the Azrinaes many times in the past for cavorting and fraternizing with other\
  \ houses—she thinks of herself as a spy, and loves learning secrets about other\
  \ people and organizations. Her main problem is that she doesn't follow orders well\
  \ and doesn't like divulging secrets without learning a secret in return—a trait\
  \ that makes her not very helpful as a spy to anyone but herself. As a demoniac,\
  \ she bears the mark of Abraxas on her right shoulder as a pale tattoo-like marking.\
  \ Currently, she's a bit agonized by the fact that she actually knew a few secrets\
  \ about the attack on the Azrinae family—had she divulged them, she could have possibly\
  \ saved her house from being exiled. Her main goal now is to see that the Azrinae\
  \ family gets to return to Zirnakaynin in a greater position of power than before.\
  \ And if she gets herself a promotion in the family to a position of greater power,\
  \ all the better!</p> \n   <p>The attached picture features the miniature I’m using\
  \ for Alivorah, standing next to her entry on the family tree chart that Sean provided\
  \ us. The mini (which was painted for me by the always-awesome Stephen Radney-MacFarland,\
  \ who’s mini-painting skills are SIGNIFICANT) is one I originally used for Jason’\
  s campaign a year or so ago, but since Jason quit running that game, I saw this\
  \ as a great opportunity to use my cool drow mini again, even though she doesn’\
  t really match the type of gear Alivorah carries. Also, those with keen eyes will\
  \ note that Alivorah is the sister of Rob McCreary’s character, and that Josh is\
  \ playing her uncle and Crystal her aunt. Should make for some interesting dynamics\
  \ around the table!</p> \n   <p>As for that bit about being a “demoniac,” well...\
  \ that’s a prestige class I’m taking the opportunity to playtest during this campaign.\
  \ Originally presented as the 5-level demonic initiate prestige class in <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy85ep\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #15</a>,\
  \ this class is being upgraded to a 10-level prestige class and renamed to “demoniac”\
  \ (the noun definition of which is “a person seemingly possessed by a demon or evil\
  \ spirit”—it’s not a prestige class for characters who make smart decisions regarding\
  \ the well-being of their immortal soul). Full details on the demoniac prestige\
  \ class will appear in the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8b7s\"\
  ><i>Lords of Chaos: Book of the Damned Volume 2</i></a>.</p> \n   <p>And for those\
  \ readers who don’t care about my new character (you’re dead to me!), here’s a quick\
  \ preview of some of the content I’m working on for <i>Lords of Chaos</i>—the beginning\
  \ of Abraxas’s entry in Chapter 1: The Abyss and its Lords! (Note! The following\
  \ hasn’t even been through development yet—some elements are certain to change by\
  \ the time it sees print later this year.)</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Abraxas</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Master of the Final Incantation</p> \n    <p>Male demon lord of magic\
  \ and forbidden lore</p> \n    <p><b>Cult</b></p> \n    <p><b>Temple</b> libraries,\
  \ reliquaries, vaults</p> \n    <p><b>Worshipers</b> drow, sorcerers</p> \n    <p><b>Minions</b>\
  \ mariliths, xacarbas (see <i>Pathfinder Bestiary II</i>), serpentine creatures</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Sacrifice</b> spellbooks, magic scrolls, those who reveal secrets</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Obedience</b> Self-flagellate with a small whip or tree branch, punctuating\
  \ each stroke with utterances of mystic words of power. Gain a +4 profane bonus\
  \ on saves against written magical effects, such as <i>sepia snake sigil</i> or\
  \ <i>symbol of death</i>. </p> \n    <p><b>Boons</b></p> \n    <p><b>1: Secret Lore\
  \ (Sp)</b> Gain one of the following spell-like abilities: <i>identify</i> 3/day,\
  \ <i>augury</i> 2/day, or <i>illusory script</i> 1/day</p> \n    <p><b>2: Heretical\
  \ Revelation (Su)</b> Up to three times a day you can whisper terrible secrets to\
  \ an adjacent target as a standard action. The target can resist with a Will save\
  \ (DC = 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier). If the target fails its save,\
  \ it is stunned for 1 round, then confused for 1d4 rounds, and then nauseated for\
  \ 2d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. </p> \n    <p><b>3: Penultimate Incantation\
  \ (Sp)</b> You affect a single creature within 60 feet with a targeted <i>greater\
  \ dispel magic</i>. Each spell or effect dispelled inflicts fire damage to the target\
  \ equal to the result of your caster level check made to dispel the magic. </p>\
