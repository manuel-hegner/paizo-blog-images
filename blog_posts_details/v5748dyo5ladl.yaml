  artist: "taking a look at wild shape. The old rules were a bit disjointed, giving\
    \ you additional uses almost sporadically as you gained levels, while granting\
    \ different types and sizes along the way. The new system grants you the ability\
    \ to wild shape one level earlier (4th, instead of 5th) and gives you an additional\
    \ usage every two levels after that (Lini is wearing druid vestments which gives\
    \ her an additional use). Just like before, you can maintain a form for one hour\
    \ per Druid level. Unlike the old system, which gave you the exact stats of the\
    \ animal, the new system is based off a number of spells that grant a specific\
    \ list of ability score bonuses. These spells also grant some of the powers of\
    \ your new form, depending on the spells level (just as they did in the Beta playtest\
    \ version of the rules). For example, at 8th level, Lini can turn into any animal"
