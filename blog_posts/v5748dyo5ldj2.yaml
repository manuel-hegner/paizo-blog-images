  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 12, 2012</p> \n   <p>Now that the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a> is just about ready to ship\
  \ out to subscribers and stores everywhere, it's time to take a look at another\
  \ product that is due to release very soon, one that will give you a great new way\
  \ to record your new dhamphir bard!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Cover.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Cover_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy8qz0\"><i>Player\
  \ Character Folio</i></a> is 16 pages of character sheet glory, containing spots\
  \ for you to record not just your vital statistics and gear, but things like your\
  \ family history, adventure record, and how many dragons you've slain. Normally,\
  \ we would just put up some artwork from the product, but the <i>Player Character\
  \ Folio</i> has a few tricks inside, so we thought it best to show off a few photos\
  \ of the actual folio.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior1_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>As you can see, when you open the folio, it's got a\
  \ two-panel cover that opens to reveal a folder pocket with some handy reference\
  \ tables and your main page, which contains all of your vital statistics. We designed\
  \ it this way so that these numbers would always be available to you during play,\
  \ no matter what page you happen to be on.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior2.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior2_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \ </div> \n   <p>Here you can see the first spread of the folio, which is naturally\
  \ dedicated to combat. Of course, all of your vital statistics are still at your\
  \ disposal.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior3_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Here is a closer look at that vital statistics panel,\
  \ open to the page for spellcasters to record their important information.</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior4.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior4_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Record all of your vital background info on this spread,\
  \ including a map of your hideout and a character sketch!</p> \n   <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior5.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1122-Interior5_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Finally, we give you all the room you need to record\
  \ the gear carried and worn by your character. Of course, there are a number of\
  \ other spreads in this book, including my personal favorite, in which you can record\
  \ the various achievements you have accomplished during play, but if you want to\
  \ see that list, you'll have to wait for the <i>Player Character Folio</i> to hit\
  \ store shelves in July.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p>\
