  \   <p>For PaizoCon 2012, we plan to make this the biggest and best PaizoCon yet!\
  \ I am scheduling 150 tables of Pathfinder Society over three days. In addition,\
  \ we are bringing back the Grand Convocation interactive. Finally, we are debuting\
  \ the GM 101 sessions that will hopefully be a hit so we can continue to offer it\
  \ at future shows. It should be an awesome time.</p> \n   <p>I need a minimum of\
  \ 45 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society games and I'll keep taking volunteer GMs\
  \ until the slots are filled! I also need 2 Volunteer Assistants for the show—these\
  \ folks will not GM, but will instead help me run Pathfinder Society HQ and will\
  \ be our go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. There may also be\
  \ special or unique roleplaying opportunities to play the part of a NPC in the Grand\
  \ Convocation, so please let me know if that is something that might interest you.\
  \ However, do not narrow your choice to a specific NPC as it may remove you from\
  \ consideration.</p> \n   <p>Below you will find the reward structure for volunteering\
  \ at PaizoCon 2012. Keep in mind that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific\
  \ event. We will let you know the slots you have been assigned to before the lottery\
  \ goes live. This should allow you plenty of time to plan a schedule with your friends\
  \ who are also attending PaizoCon 2012. Please let me know via email which days\
  \ you will be at the convention and how many slots you are volunteering for at PaizoCon\
  \ 2012.</p> \n   <h2>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</h2> \n   <p><b>Volunteer Assistant:</b>\
  \ 2 needed, treated as a Tier 1 GM</p> \n   <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers:</b> Tier\
  \ 1 GM volunteers are my everyday GMs. They are invaluable to making the show a\
  \ success! Tier 1 GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 5 slots. Tier 1\
  \ GMs may feel free to volunteer for more than 5 slots if they so desire. I only\
  \ have room for 20 Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this\
  \ tier. Volunteers will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I\
  \ reserve the right to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over\
  \ new volunteers. Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts that\
  \ you'll be able to attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>A\
  \ FREE 3-day PaizoCon 2012 badge</li> \n    <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for Paizo.com\
  \ credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including with your subscriptions.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>A FREE copy of <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"><i>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Anniversary Edition</i></a> hardcover at PaizoCon.</li> \n    <li>A special Pathfinder\
  \ Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p><b>Tier 2 GM\
  \ Volunteers:</b> While the rewards for volunteering for this tier are smaller,\
  \ the majority of my volunteers will come from Tier 2. Tier 2 GMs must volunteer\
  \ for a MINIMUM of 4 slots. Tier 2 GMs receive:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>A FREE 3-day\
  \ PaizoCon 2012 badge</li> \n    <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for Paizo.com credit,\
  \ useable at the show or anytime after, including with your subscriptions.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>A special Pathfinder Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li>\n\
  \   </ul> \n   <p><b>Tier 3 GM Volunteers:</b> This is the minimum volunteer level.\
  \ Tier 3 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 2 slots. Tier 3 GMs receive:</p> \n\
  \   <ul>\n    <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for Paizo.com credit, useable at the show\
  \ or anytime after, including subscriptions.</li> \n    <li>A special Pathfinder\
  \ Society GM boon available only at PaizoCon.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>While we will\
  \ gladly accept anyone who wants to run just one slot during the show, there are\
  \ no rewards for doing so other than our thanks.</p> \n   <p>When volunteering,\
  \ please be specific about what days you are volunteering for. I will assign folks\
  \ to scenarios on an as-needed basis, so you really only need to tell me the day(s)\
  \ you're volunteering for. I will update the needs in the thread below as I receive\
  \ volunteers, so you may look there to remain up to date on where we still need\
  \ help. Lastly, you must have a paizo.com account and you must include your paizo.com\
  \ email in your email or I won't be able to get you a badge (obviously this is only\
  \ for volunteers who are volunteering for 4 or more slots).</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Slot 1:</b> Friday 8 AM to 1 PM<br> <b>Slot 2:</b> Friday 1 PM to\
  \ 6 PM<br> <b>Slot 3:</b> Friday 7 PM to 12 AM (Grand Convocation Interactive)<br>\
  \ <b>Slot 4:</b> Saturday 8 AM to 1 PM<br> <b>Slot 5:</b> Saturday 1 PM to 6 PM<br>\
