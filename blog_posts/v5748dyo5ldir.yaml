  \ <p>This week, we’ve got another <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldgk\">Grand Convocation</a>\
  \ update, which I’ll let Grand Master Torch tell you all about:</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>My Trusted Associates,</p> \n    <p>It has come to my attention that,\
  \ in light of Major Maldris’s recent rejection of a Blakros marriage, various special\
  \ guests have been admitted into this year’s Convocation. As you may know, I pride\
  \ myself on reliable intelligence, and I pass this information on to each of you,\
  \ hoping it will make attending the Convocation easier on you.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO9235-GrandmasterTorch.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO9235-GrandmasterTorch_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Damian Kastner:</b> A maralictor of\
  \ the Hellknight order, Kastner has been invited by the affluent Paracountess Zarta\
  \ Dralneen. Damian is also a devout member of the Hellknight Order of the Scourge,\
  \ and it appears he acts in deference to the wishes of the Paracountess. He is a\
  \ respected member of the Hellknights and a near-perfect specimen of human perfection.\
  \ I wonder what the Paracountess has in mind by inviting him?</p> \n    <p><b>Garyth\
  \ Pammenter:</b> You have likely not heard of this wily rogue, as her exploits are\
  \ kept discreet by our allies in the Blakros family. Garyth is responsible for some\
  \ of the greatest heists in history—all from Blakros holdings. The family has maintained\
  \ a feud with this dashing thief for years, but it appears that she opted to return\
  \ all of her ill-gotten gains for a chance to attend the Convocation and meet with\
  \ Michellia Blakros. I have no doubt that the meddling of Guaril Karela had something\
  \ to do with this attendance.</p> \n    <p><b>Mikhail Hofer:</b> I had no clue of\
  \ this man’s identity until one of my agents reported his attendance at this year’\
  s Convocation. As a graduate of Korvosa’s Acadamae, Hofer runs a prominent business\
  \ in Absalom, though he spends most of his time selling minor spells to esteemed\
  \ noble families. Despite a clearly bumbling nature and moderate appearance, Hofer\
  \ has been sponsored by the Sapphire Sage Amenopheus, as an attendee to the Convocation.\
  \ Interesting...</p> \n    <p><b>Theodric Alverteen:</b> While I try to leave politics\
  \ out of my dealings, the old man Theodric Alverteen is a perfect example of the\
  \ decline of Taldor. Once a prominent noble, Theodric left Taldor to go on a worldwide\
  \ hunting excursion. Now finished seeking trophies, the old man has come to Absalom\
  \ to show off his many conquests. I had the opportunity to meet him at a recent\
  \ gala, and I can say that his mental faculties are not... entirely present. Why\
  \ Gloriana Morilla would sponsor his membership to the Convocation is something\
  \ I cannot even begin to fathom.</p> \n    <p align=\"right\">Yours in trust,<br>\
  \ Grand Master Torch</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>In addition to the words of\
  \ the Grand Master Torch, there have been many whispers throughout Absalom about\
  \ the current state of the city. Many of these happenings have been compiled by\
  \ expert Pathfinder and renowned bard Larius Kaludju. We hope to share more of these\
  \ in the coming weeks.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Gather round, children, and\
  \ hear the tale that I have to pawn, about Absalom at the time of summer’s dawn.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The people are going to bed early, hoping to hide out in their homes,\
  \ as a terrible shadow stretches out from the Cairnlands. My guess is that we’ve\
  \ got another uppity siege tower working some bad magic, and so far, no adventurers\
  \ have returned from it. Rumors abound that this tower only appears in the late\
  \ hours of the evening and remains until the wee-hours of the morn’. They say the\
  \ screams can be heard all day long, but I think that’s just other bards trying\
  \ to make it sound more dangerous than it actually is!</p> \n    <p>On a more upbeat\
  \ note, the Absalom Menagerie is now closed for construction. Apparently, the warden\
  \ is looking to do some new renovations in preparation for adding more space to\
  \ their jungle wing. I, for one, look forward to going back, once the Menagerie\
  \ has reopened; there’s nothing like seeing a child trying to pet a tiger!</p> \n\
  \    <p>I also hear that the Menagerie recently imported some exotic magical animals\
  \ from the south, but everyone’s been hush-hush on that bit of info.</p> \n    <p\
