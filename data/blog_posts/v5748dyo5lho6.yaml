  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>Greetings, Pathfinders.</p> \n\
  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">We've got an exciting new announcement for you\
  \ this week, but first, I want to talk about the characters from the new August\
  \ release, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu9\"><em>Paladin Class Deck</em></a>. Meet\
  \ the band:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Koren.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Koren_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Seelah_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>First up is Koren. When the design team started kicking\
  \ around paladin character concepts, I immediately pitched the idea for a self-sacrificing\
  \ martyrish fellow, one who's always saving other people at cost to himself. Because\
  \ the design team has a... quirky... sense of humor, Koren quickly morphed into\
  \ a self-hating half-orc who follows Sarenrae. He's all about saving people from\
  \ themselves. His roles allow him to branch out into undead slaying or to stick\
  \ with his team. (Fun Fact: that last one, the Unflagging Companion role, was originally\
  \ called Creepy Stalker. Editorial is so mean.)</p> \n     <p>Next we have my personal\
  \ favorite, Raz the gnome. She's definitely a cavalier-like take on the paladin.\
  \ She's inspired by a perennial RPG character of mine: a halfling paladin dog rider.\
  \ Conveniently, I talk about her a bit on <a href=\"http://www.geekcastradio.com/botched-roll/botched-roll-episode-11-pathfinder-adventure-card-game-interview\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this podcast</a>. From Raz's token card: </p>\n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p><i>“Raz is the only gnome paladin she's ever met. Therefore, she's\
  \ clearly the best gnome paladin there ever was. At an early age, Raz decided she\
  \ wanted to be different from her mischievous kin. She did so by kicking bad guy\
  \ butt and protecting the good guys.”</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>That\
  \ tells you most of what you need to know. She's got a role devoted to helping people\
  \ get stuff, and she's got a role named Dog Rider Knight. I'm not going to tell\
  \ you what to do or anything, but <i>Dog. Rider. Knight.</i></p> \n     <p>Last\
  \ but certainly not least, we've got a fresh new take on the iconic paladin Seelah.\
  \ This Iomedae-following sword-wielding lover of good and righteousness shows off\
  \ her \"lay on hands\" ability in the <em>Paladin Class Deck</em>. For the uninitiated,\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/classes/paladin.html#lay-on-hands\">Lay On Hands</a>\
  \ is a classic paladin ability—the paladin calls forth divine aid to heal someone\
  \ with a mere touch, faith healer-style. In fact, Faith Healer is one of her roles,\
  \ good for those who like supportive paladin builds. Unlike Raz, Seelah has no interest\
  \ in loot, so she tends to ignore it in her endless search for justice.</p> \n \
  \    <p>You may have noticed that this deck features only three characters rather\
  \ than the four featured in each of the first seven class decks. That's a change\
  \ that you'll see going forward in the rest of the Class Deck line. Based on extensive\
  \ player feedback, we've increased the number of boons in the deck. Each character\
  \ can now get a greater range of worthwhile options to choose from while progressing\
  \ through an adventure path. We think you'll be pleased with the results while still\
  \ appreciating the variety of innovative characters that we present in these products.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oh, and that news I foreshadowed so subtly earlier? CLASS DECK SUBSCRIPTIONS,\
  \ Y'ALL. They're starting with the August release of the <em>Paladin Class Deck</em>.\
  \ Check the details:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>With your ongoing <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9ewj\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck subscription</a>,\
  \ we'll automatically send you each new Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck,\
  \ charging your credit card automatically as we ship each product. You only need\
  \ to sign up once, so you'll never need to worry about renewal notices or missed\
  \ products! Best of all, each subscription shipment will give you a discount of\
  \ 20% off the MSRP of that release. Items from your Class Deck subscription will\
  \ be combined with your other Paizo subscriptions (including your&nbsp;Adventure\
  \ Card Game subscription) to save money on shipping.</p> \n      <p>When you start\
  \ an ongoing subscription, any existing preorders for products covered by your subscription\
  \ are automatically cancelled (or if you've preordered more than one of an item,\
  \ they'll have their quantity reduced by one). If you've already preordered any\
  \ of the upcoming decks, you do not need to do anything special when you subscribe.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Exciting, right? Next week, you'll learn what the\
  \ real Best Character Ever is, because I'm taking my turn at the helm.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Until next time, Pathfinders.</p> \n     <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure\
  \ Card Game Designer</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder\
