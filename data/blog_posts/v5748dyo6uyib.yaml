  \    </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Thorny points\
  \ menaced Jirelle from all directions. Her buckler and dagger turned them away for\
  \ what felt like the hundredth time in half as many steps. Sadly, these were <em>not</em>\
  \ enemy blades, which she would have preferred by far. Those she could beat, parry,\
  \ catch, disarm, and finally answer with her own winning thrusts. Not so these hanging,\
  \ coiling vines and branches. So lazy, yet so stubborn! Where was the energy, the\
  \ impassioned back-and-forth between skilled players? This wasn’t daring play, but\
  \ pure <em>drudgery</em>.</p>\n      <p>Of course, even if the trees did rise to\
  \ the challenge, she was hardly prepared to meet them in a duel. Not an impressive\
  \ one, at any rate. A swordless lunge lacked a certain something.</p>\n      <p><em>Blasted\
  \ belaborin’</em><span lang=\"EN\">, an old shipmate might’ve said. <em>Damnable\
  \ detour!</em></span></p>\n      <p>With those thoughts, she gave the thicket a\
  \ moment of undeserved, unrequired mercy and turned on her companion instead. The\
  \ rebuke she’d swallowed several times over finally made its escape. “You realize\
  \ I may never forgive you for this?” she said, only half-joking.</p>\n      <p>Sajan\
  \ was probably less penetrable than the jungle. The monk appeared indifferent to\
  \ the grabbing flora and buzzing flies. Not even the yellow paint on his shaved\
  \ head ran in the humidity. Still, Jirelle’s comment managed to hoist his brow a\
  \ bit.</p>\n      <p><span lang=\"EN\">“Charging inland was not <em>my</em> idea,”\
  \ he reminded her.</span></p>\n      <p>No, <em>his</em> idea had been to make peace\
  \ with their losses. Adapt and carry on while the impertinent thieves carried <em>off</em>\
  \ their shiny treasures. By the time he’d relented and joined in the pursuit, the\
  \ criminals had a fair head start. The aiuvarin swashbuckler and qi-fueled monk\
  \ rivaled one another in swiftness, but not even they could chase a winged quarry\
  \ up waterfalls. Hence their current climb through choking roots and broadleaves.</p>\n\
  \      <p>But before all that… well, yes. Maybe if she had taken Sajan’s advice\
  \ to ignore them, the creatures swarming the riverboat like seagulls might have,\
  \ in fact, lost interest. Instead, she became defensive when the nosy things started\
  \ hopping and flapping around the party’s gear. Sajan had retained his characteristic\
  \ focus, gently accusing Jirelle of attaching too much importance to her possessions.\
  \ It was possible he had a point. In trying to drive the thieves away, she had only\
  \ fanned their interest. Curious picking and prodding became bold, giggling pilfery.\
  \ Jirelle could appreciate a bit of provocative showmanship… when <em>she</em> was\
  \ the one onstage. The role of an inactive audience didn’t suit her, let alone that\
  \ of a helpless victim.</p>\n      <p>“Well, it’s clear I value <em>my</em> sword\
  \ more than you value yours,” she sniffed before pressing on.</p>\n      <p>“Possibly,”\
  \ he said as he padded quietly behind her. “Although you shouldn’t mistake my calm\
  \ for indifference. I <em>do</em> feel frustration; I just deny it control. In time\
  \ it diminishes, like an unfed fire.”</p>\n      <p>“Then I’m merely… feeding… my\
  \ frustration?” Jirelle gasped, wrestling with the green creepers. They clung to\
  \ her ankles and threaded through her slashed sleeves. Surely, she’d stumbled into\
  \ an actual snakes’ nest! Thank the Lucky Drunk she’d left her cape behind.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Which do you value greater?” the monk continued, arms relaxed behind\
  \ him as if this were a beachside stroll. “Your favorite sword or the commission\
  \ that awaits us?”</p>\n      <p>“Rather difficult to protect that nervous venture-captain\
  \ without our weapons.” Jirelle paused before a particularly solid knot of branches\
  \ blocking their way. She sighed. “Or to cut through these bloody tangles.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Hmm,” Sajan purred through a ghost of a grin. Clearly, he sensed another\
  \ opportunity to impart some sage wisdom—or what his companions had taken to calling\
  \ “Sajan advice.”</p>\n      <p>Jirelle decided to head off another lecture. “I\
  \ suppose you want to move <em>with</em> the forest rather than against it. Glide\
  \ across the top, perhaps?” That couldn’t be too terribly dissimilar to a masts-and-rigging\
  \ balancing act, come to think of it. Climbing aloft might not be a bad idea.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Sajan considered this, too, then surprised her by shaking his head and\
  \ stepping up to the natural barrier. She motioned for him to be her guest. He planted\
  \ his feet in a wide, low stance and cupped his fingers like claws. His breath went\
  \ in and out with a blur of motion too fast to follow. Sharp cracks rang in Jirelle’\
  s ears, but only after the twisting arms of wood exploded away, splinters flying.\
  \ Soon the debris settled; the path was clear. The monk turned and offered a bow,\
  \ meaning both <em>you’re welcome</em> and <em>after you</em>.</p>\n      <p>Jirelle\
  \ smirked at the showiness, but he couldn’t fool her. Swagger was <em>her </em>style,\
  \ not his. His approach was direct, practical, and purposeful… not to mention effective.\
  \ Clearly losing a favored weapon hadn’t hindered him to the extent it had her.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Why don’t <em>you</em> go first?” she said with strained sweetness.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Again, this particular detour was not <em>my</em> idea.”</p>\n      <p>“\
  So it wasn’t. Then when we find our swords, I suppose you won’t be claiming yours?”\
  </p>\n      <p>There was that hint of a smile. “Touché, madam.”</p>\n      <p>Jirelle\
  \ laughed.</p>\n      <p>Soon they breached the worst of it and hastened their pace.\
  \ A gap in the foliage and the undergrowth exposed dewy sky, and the jungle noise\
  \ gave way to a low, distant rumble. They had returned to the river above the cataracts,\
  \ which they’d overshot. This was only a small tributary to their vessel’s waterway.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Must drop off ‘round the bend there,” Jirelle said, pointing left along\
  \ a rocky bank. She searched right. The river wandered down from a purple fog of\
  \ mountains. The landscape was peaceful, still, undisturbed. She doubted the thieves\
  \ had fled any further inland, but they were nowhere to be seen. Might they have\
  \ doubled back to the main river, followed it back to sea? That made sense. All\
  \ while Sajan and she stumbled through the forest.</p>\n      <p><em>Blasted belaborin’\
  !</em></p>\n      <p>A strange, spicy odor tickled her nostrils then, tempting a\
  \ sneeze.</p>\n      <p>“Oh dear,” she heard her companion say, and found him staring\
  \ almost sheepishly at his open hands, slick with something moist. A little apprehensively,\
  \ Jirelle sniffed her own and recoiled quickly, eyes watering. Even her buckler\
  \ wafted a hot stink.</p>\n      <p>“Monkey tree oil!” she gagged. “Must’ve run\
  \ afoul of it back there. Better wash it off before it draws every predator in half\
  \ a league.”</p>\n      <p>Sajan chuckled, apparently impressed that the forest\
  \ had fought back.</p>\n      <p>The river’s current wasn’t too strong or deep and\
  \ the water not at all cold, but its bed was slippery with moss and stones. They\
  \ picked their way to the middle to give any oil on their feet a good rinsing. Then\
  \ they scrubbed their forearms. Jirelle was just about to suggest they immerse themselves\
  \ completely, for good measure, when a wet sound reached her over the rumbling downstream,\
  \ a splashing that hadn’t come from them. Sajan went alert, too.</p>\n      <p>They\
  \ realized they now had a better view around the bend. White spray indicated the\
  \ tributary’s drop-off, but it was split by a wedge of moss-blanketed boulders.\
  \ The sound had come from the tiny creatures crowding that wedge. They leaped into\
  \ it from the water like flying fish bouncing off a ship’s hull, then flapped around\
  \ like yellow bats, only to dive and start the process over again.</p>\n      <p>Jirelle\
  \ and Sajan had found the thieves!</p>\n      <p>“Why are they acting like that?”\
  \ the monk wondered softly.</p>\n      <p>These annoying, aquatic, fin-headed gremlins\
  \ usually kept to the sea and the coast, but Jirelle assumed they’d been drawn in\
  \ by the riverboat. Now the bright green, almost glowing boulders distracted them.\
  \ <em>Why</em> didn’t interest her, because there were their weapons, her rapier\
  \ and the monk’s temple sword, momentarily forgotten among the rocks.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Sajan must have sensed her coiling like a spring. “Remember what happened\
  \ last time.”</p>\n      <p>“I know. If they think I want it…”</p>\n      <p>“Yes.\
  \ And we’re too exposed here. Too slow. Better to slip around.”</p>\n      <p>He\
  \ began to do just that, then looked back with an expectant stare. <em>Are you coming?</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>There came a sickening metallic scratch. Downstream, Jirelle’s rapier\
  \ was slipping, soon to fall into the spray and probably down the falls. Sajan’\
  s expression was one of pity, but she felt her own resolve form into a confident\
  \ smile. She decided her companion had had the right idea before when he cut through\
  \ the trees.</p>\n      <p>The direct approach.</p>\n      <p>Her first few strides\
  \ were indeed slow. Grounded. But soon she picked up speed and momentum, feeling\
  \ lighter and lighter. Her feet touched shallower and shallower, recovering faster\
  \ and faster, until they were completely free of the water, slapping the surface\
  \ rapidly as she raced across it.</p>\n      <p>Sajan’s strangled grunt of surprise\
  \ was extremely gratifying.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ <br>\n      <p>Jirelle bent forward, focused only on reaching her property before\
  \ it disappeared or the gremlins grabbed it again. A timely somersault carried her\
  \ off the water and over her sword; her hand closed inside the guard. Landing gracefully\
  \ on the wedge of boulders, she flourished the blade with an extravagant bow of\
  \ her own.</p>\n      <p>Sajan nodded back, his head tilting only slightly toward\
  \ her: <em>Impressive!</em></p>\n      <p>Satisfied, Jirelle figured it was high\
  \ time they rejoined their riverboat party. If that venture-captain’s fear of vengeful\
  \ Aspis agents proved warranted, it wouldn’t do to miss out on the fun—<em>or</em>\
  \ the commission.</p>\n      <p>There was no need to menace the gremlins, whose\
  \ strange fascination with the boulders broke under Jirelle’s demonstration. They\
  \ scattered and dove down the cascading steps of the falls. Jirelle wished them\
  \ good riddance and stooped to recover the monk’s sickle blade from the rocks—which\
  \ moved.</p>\n      <p>She froze. Looking closer, she realized the moss under her\
  \ feet wasn’t just moss, but a scaly hide lit like a lantern from within. The heavy\
  \ weight underneath shifted again, then began to rise. A long neck emerged, dripping\
  \ from the stream. A face like a horse’s skull turned to inspect its passenger,\
  \ sharp teeth flared hungrily</p>\n      <p>Jirelle’s dismount was far less graceful.\
  \ She backpedaled upstream, kicking big splashes this time, until Sajan was by her\
  \ side again. The river monster, even larger than it had seemed, greeted them with\
  \ a crocodilian hiss. It lashed its tail and gave off a stronger greenish glow than\
  \ before. Jirelle was glad they had their weapons back, though she had the horrible\
  \ notion she was about to understand those gremlins’ dangerous enthrallment.</p>\n\
