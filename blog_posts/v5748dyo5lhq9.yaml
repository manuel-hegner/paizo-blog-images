  \ <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a>, stretching back into\
  \ the previous century. That relationship is tied very closely to the progress of\
  \ my career, from fan, to freelancer, to Paizo developer. Like many good stories,\
  \ my tales from Gen Con are best told in reverse.</p> \n    <p>Last year was my\
  \ first time at Gen Con as an employee of Paizo, and I spent most of it helping\
  \ the amazing volunteers running Pathfinder Society events in the Sagamore Ballroom.\
  \ Watching more than 1,400 tables of people playing Pathfinder together over the\
  \ course of the convention was an awe-inspiring sight. Watching people spend hours\
  \ of blood, sweat, and <i>tears</i> to make sure their fellow PFS members had a\
  \ good time was actually emotionally moving for me. The entire point of RPGs is\
  \ to play games together, and seeing dozens of people take hour and hours out of\
  \ their convention fun to help other people's game experiences run smoothly was\
  \ immensely fulfilling.</p> \n    <p>Last year was also the first Gen Con where\
  \ freelance writers struck up conversations with me on the hallway, often getting\
  \ around to asking if I would have writing opportunities to assign anytime soon.\
  \ I remember being on the other end of that conversation, and I have to say most\
  \ Paizo freelancers seem better at it than I remember being.</p> \n    <p>For many\
  \ years before I was an employee at Paizo, that kind of networking with developers\
  \ and editors was the main thing I did at Gen Con. The convention is one of the\
  \ few places where multiple RPG companies have editors and developers present all\
  \ in one building, so for a freelance RPG writer it's a target-rich environment.\
  \ For a decade I considered travel to Gen Con less a vacation (though I always ended\
  \ up having a great time), and more a necessary business trip. Thankfully I was\
  \ well-enough known to be invited to the occasional private event, but mostly I\
  \ went to places where editors and developers were likely to be found (dealer's\
  \ room booths, the ENnie Awards, bars), and asked if anyone needed anything. I discovered\
  \ that if developers know you well enough to ask if you can grab them a bottle of\
  \ water, helping out often later results in being invited to a quick lunch or an\
  \ event you'd otherwise have missed.</p> \n    <p>Such impromptu gatherings are\
  \ amazing opportunities to get to better know people in the industry, and were instrumental\
  \ in my building a network of people who might offer me work or who I could go to\
  \ for career or design advice. Of course you have to follow up on such contacts,\
  \ and don't miss out on opportunities closer to home. At one casual Gen Con gathering\
  \ a few years ago, I realized that I never spoke to Greg Vaughn, who lived no more\
  \ than 30 minutes from my house, except when we were both in Indianapolis, hundreds\
  \ of miles from where we lived. He and I had a good laugh about that, but I also\
  \ made sure to have lunch with him before the next Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>In 2010\
  \ when I was part of the Industry Insider program of seminars I also discovered\
  \ there was a second level of networking at well, between peers who already have\
  \ some success in the industry. Every seminar panel included some time just before\
  \ and just after talking to the crowd where the panelists would say hi, exchange\
  \ business cards, and sometimes see what meal plans fellow panelists had. I didn't\
  \ follow-up on as many of those opportunities as I should have, but I did learn\
  \ a lot over just a few shared lunches.</p> \n    <p>The chance to be at such social\
  \ gatherings evolved slowly over the years I've attended Gen Con. Before anyone\
  \ knew me by name, I spent most of my time at the convention listening to seminars,\
  \ playing demo games (often run by luminaries in the industry who already held the\
  \ kinds of positions I aspired to), and getting to know other gamers. I had some\
  \ advantage because I worked for Wizards of the Coast briefly in 2000-2001, but\
  \ for the most part my early Gen Con opportunities came from being in the right\
  \ place at the right time. I found that the last panel of the day was a particularly\
  \ good time to be visible and friendly, and more than once got invited to impromptu\
  \ gatherings of fans and professionals just because everyone was hungry. In one\
  \ of my early trips to Gen Con I managed to be invited (along with most of the front\
  \ row of fans) to have dinner with Dave Arneson after he gave a seminar about his\
  \ experiences with roleplaying games, dating back to his early experiments with\
  \ Braunstein. I hadn't planned to try to go to dinner with one of the godfathers\
  \ of my favorite hobby, I just got lucky because I stood around politely when the\
  \ seminar came to an end.</p> \n    <p>In fact, my best moments at Gen Con have\
  \ almost always been things I not only didn't plan for, but didn't even dream might\
  \ happen. There's aren't that many opportunities for fans of tabletop games to rub\
  \ elbows with their favorite designers and artists, but Gen Con brings so many people\
  \ together that you always have a chance at an amazing encounter.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ it was at my very first Gen Con, sometime in the 1990s, I had the honor of playing\
  \ an RPG with Gary Gygax... for about 90 seconds.</p> \n    <p>He was at a table\
  \ in-or-near the TSR/WotC Castle (a magnificent structure used as the TSR/WotC booth\
  \ in the Dealer's Room at the time), and I believe he was running some edition of\
  \ D&amp;D. A crowd of us were watching. He was an energetic and exciting storyteller,\
  \ and just watching him run a game was a lot of fun. Someone's character died (killed\
  \ mysteriously in the darkness, having walked away from the PCs' campfire and only\
  \ light source). That player gave up a spot at the table, and Mr. Gygax pointed\
  \ at me and boomed \"You want to play!?\"</p> \n    <p>Of course I did.</p> \n \
  \   <p>A character sheet was slapped in front of me. My turn came soon enough. THINGS\
  \ were circling our camp. I was a warrior of some typeâ€”I think a ranger, but I didn't\
  \ last long enough to get acquainted with my character. As my one action, I grabbed\
  \ a burning log from our campfire and hurled it out at the multiple sets of red\
  \ eyes stalking us. \"Good!\" Mr. Gygax shouted approvingly, and had me roll a d20.\
  \ I have no idea what I rolled.</p> \n    <p>It wasn't good enough to hit any of\
  \ the red-eyed threats, but it was enough to illuminate them. Massive black wolves,\
  \ snarling and, we realized <i>talking</i>.</p> \n    <p>\"Kill that one!\" Mr.\
  \ Gygax snarled, pointing at me and explaining the words came from the biggest wolf,\
  \ directed at the rest of the pack.</p> \n    <p>And they did.</p> \n    <p>I lasted\
  \ exactly one round. Mr. Gygax smiled, told me I was dead, and I should let someone\
  \ else play.</p> \n    <p>I've been hooked on Gen Con ever since.</p> \n    <p>Owen\
