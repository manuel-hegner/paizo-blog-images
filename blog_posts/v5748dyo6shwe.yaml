  \    </tr> \n      </tbody>\n     </table> \n     <h3>GM Numbat (they/she)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>I started playing RPGs in the mid-late ‘70s, enjoying the original D&amp;D\
  \ with its flimsy booklets and fun dice. Within a year, I was running games at my\
  \ all-girls high school. I’ve played many systems over the years, though usually\
  \ only briefly and with long breaks between. Partly this was because of a complex\
  \ interaction of several chronic mental and physical conditions which can limit\
  \ my abilities. I am grateful for the Paizo Organized Play community, where I found\
  \ an accepting and welcoming home. </p> \n     <p>None of my health concerns are\
  \ obvious by looking at me. The major advantage to this is that when I have a good\
  \ day, no one prejudges me simply based on appearance. The major disadvantage is\
  \ that when I am having a bad day, it is difficult for some to understand, as I\
  \ look “normal.” Over time, I have become better at learning my limits and predicting\
  \ some of those times that I need to cut back on commitments. Still, I can be caught\
  \ out with an unexpected flare and have to pull out of playing, or worse, running\
  \ a game. I always feel terrible when I do, even though most of our community has\
  \ been wonderfully supportive. Dietary restrictions are a challenge, especially\
  \ when traveling or wanting to socialize. I catch myself annoyed by someone’s fidgeting\
  \ or apparent distraction at the table and remind myself that this may be their\
  \ coping mechanism, just as I have mine. We are each so individual, with our own\
  \ needs and concerns, often not obvious to others. Let us celebrate those differences\
  \ and the unique perspective they bring.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Ivis K. Flanagan\
  \ (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>Disabilities come in many forms. There are disabilities\
  \ that the world can observe and recognize. There are others, though, that people\
  \ fight in the dark, because the social stigma of them can be a <em>silence</em>\
  \ spell, where the anxiety of the possible response is more encompassing than the\
  \ darkness of suffering alone. PTSD is one of those.</p> \n     <p>PTSD is the demon\
  \ that I fight. While many often associate this fight with former soldiers or others\
  \ who have been in warzones, those are not the only demons at hand. Any traumatic\
  \ event can be a catalyst. This is my fight—utilizing weapons of words, medications,\
  \ and therapy in the ongoing battle. I now add to these this transparency in the\
  \ hopes that someone else will see that they aren’t alone. You have allies who know\
  \ these battlefields well.</p> \n     <p>Another weapon against it is finding safe\
  \ spaces and friends who care. I have been able to do that through this community—\
  the players, volunteers, freelancers, and staff who I am lucky to call colleagues\
  \ and friends. This community is ever growing, and its values of inclusion, diversity,\
  \ and honesty are why it is a safe space, a space I am grateful to help create,\
  \ and a place where no one has to fight alone. </p> \n     <br> \n     <table class=\"\

  \ \n     <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3> \n     <p>Hi all! I’m senior editor at Paizo\
  \ (on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/legalizegoblins\">@legalizegoblins</a>)\
  \ and multiply disabled, both physically and mentally. Due to hypermobility and\
  \ congenital muscle issues, I have numerous joint conditions and when walking for\
  \ more than a few minutes, I have to wear braces on my knees to reduce pain. This\
  \ can lead to awkward questions, uncomfortable assumptions, and a sense of self-consciousness.\
  \ Sticking out in public is challenging, whether it’s the braces themselves or the\
  \ need to use the elevator when all my friends automatically go for the stairs.\
  \ Additionally, I have a whole cocktail of mental and learning disabilities. This\
  \ isn’t uncommon; comorbidity is the norm for mental illness and learning disabilities,\
  \ which is why you often see people listing out a number of disorders. Here’s my\
  \ list: bipolar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and dyscalculia.\
  \ I struggle with feeling self-conscious about the number of health problems I face,\
  \ but there’s no need to be ashamed. Disability is actually extremely common, though\
  \ we don’t talk about it like it is, and many people with disabilities have more\
  \ than one. </p> \n     <p>It’s been a huge pleasure to see disability become more\
  \ prominent in our games. I feel so lucky to have worked on books like <em>Grand\
  \ Bazaar</em>, where I gave my NPC, Arhan Benimaya, a service dog. Disability *is*\
  \ normal, and we should treat it as such. </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Dave Nelson\
  \ (he/they)</h3> \n     <p>Hey everybody! I'm Dave Nelson and I live with a handful\
  \ of disabilities, mainly autism, dyslexia/dysgraphia, and anxiety. Often these\
  \ \"invisible\" disabilities get either swept under the rug or have their legitimacy\
  \ questioned. It makes it quite the uphill battle to get recognized and taken seriously.\
  \ I feel very strongly that more exposure to what folks with these disabilities\
  \ are actually like and what they go through will help combat these issues. So from\
  \ the very start of my writing career I have tried to champion neurodiverse causes\
  \ and representation as best I can. You can find examples of my neurodiverse characters\
  \ both in <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> in the form of Erikanesh, or the upcoming\
  \ <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> with Chun Hye-Seung. You can find me on Twitter\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davicthegrey\">@davicthegrey</a>, talking about\
  \ my experiences, games, and all other manner of things.</p> \n     <br> \n    \

  \ better known in the TTRPG sphere as Waffles from WafflesMapleSyrup LLC. I am a\
  \ disabled US Navy veteran with major depressive disorder, tinnitus, as well as\
  \ other depressive contributing factors such as insomnia and chronic pain. I have\
  \ battled with suicide in my life and strive to have nobody need to fight that battle\
  \ alone.</p> \n     <p>I am one of the two CEOs of WafflesMapleSyrup, who run two\
  \ separate streams and podcasts. I am the GM of our Starfinder show Journeys Adrift,\
  \ and I play an android magus (Arc II) in our <em>Strength of Thousands</em> show,\
  \ Outcast &amp; Outclassed. TTRPGs have given me a close-knit group of friends and\
  \ a significant other that keep my head up and let me strive to do better in life.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>WafflesMapleSyrup strives to reduce the stigma against mental health\
  \ with our platform in TTRPGs, and because of their similar standards, love to do\
  \ so with Paizo. We've participated in PaizoCon streams, Jasper's Game Day, and\
  \ Paizo events, among other events with various creators since we began.</p> \n\
  \     <p>We aim to build our platform into something large enough to have the reach\
  \ necessary to reduce the stigma against mental health and show that it is okay\
  \ to be different, it's okay to be disabled, and there should always be a place\
  \ for everyone at the table.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Esther Wallace (she/her,\
  \ zhe/zher)</h3> \n     <p>Hi y’all, I’m Esther Wallace. I GM Chromythica, a Pathfinder\
  \ 2E actual play, and I’m multiply disabled. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic\
  \ fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), two types of OI (osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare bone\
  \ disease, and orthostatic intolerance, which mostly means I get really dizzy when\
  \ I stand up), and other as-yet-undiagnosed chronic illnesses. </p> \n     <p>My\
  \ disabilities come with frequent symptoms of brain fog, intense pain, and exhaustion.\
  \ I’m still learning how to navigate as a disabled person in the tabletop community.\
  \ Gaming spaces are so often not constructed with disabled people in mind; for me,\
  \ it makes all the difference in the world if a GM and fellow players ask me about\
  \ my access needs and work with me to implement accessibility practices. As a player,\
  \ this can take the shape of GMs building in time for me to move my body or encouraging\
  \ me to play online games from bed or a couch. As a GM, this frequently takes the\
  \ form of my players helping me recall rules on particularly bad brain fog days!\
  \ </p> \n     <p>I created the hashtags #tabletopaccess and #ttrpgaccess as a way\
  \ for disabled people to discuss our experiences in tabletop, and I host periodic\
  \ Twitter chats about disability and tabletop RPGs using these hashtags. Disabled\
  \ people are welcome to respond to any of the prompts I’ve posted, and nondisabled\
  \ people are welcome to follow along and learn! </p> \n     <p>You can find me on\

  \ K.C. Stephens (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Hi, I’m Owen K.C. Stephens. I’ve been playing\
  \ and homebrewing for TTRPGs for 39 years, been a professional game writer for 25\
  \ years, a developer for 21, and a publisher and consultant for 9. My involvement\
  \ with Paizo goes back to the early days of the company putting out DragonMagazine.\
  \ I wrote the original <em>Guide to Absalom</em> as a freelancer, was a Paizo developer\
  \ on-staff from 2014 to 2019, am a co-creator of Starfinder, and have done regular\
  \ freelance work for Paizo since I left. I am also the publisher and co-owner for\
  \ Rogue Genius Games, and the <a href=\"https://greenroninstore.com/collections/fantasy-age\"\
  >Fantasy AGE developer for Green Ronin</a>.</p> \n     <p><b>Content Warning: Trauma,\
  \ abuse, and suicidal thoughts discussed in the rest of this bio.</b></p> \n   \
  \  <p>I’m a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I have Civilian Post-Traumatic Stress\
  \ Disorder (also known as Non-Combat PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder. I must\
  \ be medicated and undergo psychotherapy in order to remain functional. This is\
  \ much like having a broken leg and needing crutches—the crutches don’t let you\
  \ act normally, but they do make it possible to get more done than you possibly\
  \ could without them.</p> \n     <p>Gaming, both game-writing and game-playing,\
  \ have been a major source of therapy and the ability to build a social safety net\
  \ for myself. Before I was diagnosed, without RPGs, I would not have survived high\
  \ school. I know games are important—they saved my life—and believe representation\
  \ is a crucial part of that.</p> \n     <p>You can find me and links to my social\
