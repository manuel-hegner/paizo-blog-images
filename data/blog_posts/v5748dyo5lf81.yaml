  \ \n     <p>\"Damned thing caught it!\" Beetle cried.</p> \n     <p>\"Elly nogglaxy!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>A crash shook the yard as the wight tossed the pillar aside.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Fools.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Have at you, bastard!\" Beetle's palms slapped\

  \ \n     <p>Larem raised a hand. \"No!\"</p> \n     <p>A body collided with the\
  \ wight. Rattling and squelches rose as Beetle laid into the creature. It sounded\
  \ like the undead just stood there, taking the hits.</p> \n     <p>\"I tire of this,\"\
  \ it said at last.</p> \n     <p>Larem struggled to stand and intervene, but Dargley\
  \ appeared and bear-hugged him. </p> \n     <p>Beetle snarled at his foe. \"Back\
  \ to the Abyss with ye!\" A snap of bone, and he screeched. \"Muh finger!\" His\
  \ cry devolved into incoherent threats.</p> \n     <p>The wight's hiss cut through\
  \ the babbles. \"For every hour you delay in bringing the Weeping Blade to me, I\
  \ shall gnaw an inch of flesh from him.\"</p> \n     <p>Larem trembled, despising\
  \ himself for his helplessness. \"If... if we somehow find the blade and bring it,\
  \ will you spare his life?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Idjit! Don't bargain with the beast.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Another whack of bone, and Beetle groaned.</p> \n     <p>\"This theft\
  \ and treachery requires repayment,\" said the wight. \"Blood must be spilled to\
  \ nullify the spirit within the blade. Yet I will not be unmerciful. You will be\
  \ given the choice of whose life is surrendered. But make it quickly: you have until\
  \ tomorrow at midnight to deliver the blade to the Maidens' Midden, unless you wish\
  \ your companion unable to even crawl into his own grave.\"</p> \n     <p>Beetle\
  \ screamed as the creature dragged him off. Larem tried to stagger after, but Dargley\
  \ held him fast, moaning and keening. At last, Beetle's cries disappeared, and the\
  \ two of them stood alone in the graveyard. </p> \n     <p>Larem spat in disgust.\
  \ \"That didn't go quite as planned, did it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Bloddy tumbuckle.\"\
  </p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Larem bowed his head into his\
  \ hands. After hauling him out of the graveyard—over his shoulders, no less—Dargley\
  \ had deposited him in the crook of an alley doorway and hunkered down nearby to\
  \ sob. </p> \n     <p>Larem had no idea what part of Underbridge they'd fled to.\
  \ No way to orient himself to any of their warren boltholes, and Dargley couldn't\
  \ find them alone. Not since first losing his sight had Larem felt so useless. So\
  \ vulnerable.</p> \n     <p>What would the wight be doing to Beetle at this very\
  \ moment? What could they do about it? No one would give heed to a blind beggar's\
  \ pleas for help, thinking it a swindle. Even if they enchanted a substitute blade,\
  \ Larem didn't doubt the wight would discern a fake.</p> \n     <p>As he considered\
  \ their bleak options, a wheedling voice caught his ear.</p> \n     <p>\"Looksee\
  \ here. Two leetle meece. Wassun they has? Glit? Glum?\"</p> \n     <p>A second\
  \ sniggered. \"Weepsy, ain'tsee? Raggum and baggum.\"</p> \n     <p>Larem suppressed\
  \ a moan. Could this night get any worse? He recognized the guttertalk that had\
  \ recently become fashionable among some of the younger beggars in Underbridge—\
  little clans of street toughs were always forming and dissolving here, left mostly\
  \ alone by the larger gangs as long as they didn't get too big for their trousers.\
  \ Dargley must've neared one of their hideouts, or else they'd been followed, seen\
  \ as easy prey—not an unfair estimation. </p> \n     <p>As Larem listened to their\
  \ approach with dread, he noted an odd rhythm to their gait. After each shuffling\
  \ step came a whisking noise, like a length of rope being dragged behind. Then their\
  \ reek assailed him: a stench of sewage, a bestial musk... and damp fur.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Not just gang members. Wererats in shifted form, tails trailing through\
  \ the alley rubbish.</p> \n     <p>Dargley jumped to his feet. \"Oooosie pillygorp\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Wassee chatter? Gottsa chucker at we's?\" Anger tightened the first\
  \ gang member's voice. Now Larem could distinguish the clicking of elongated teeth\
  \ and scrabbling of talons over stone.</p> \n     <p>\"No, I swear he's not making\
  \ fun of you,\" Larem said. \"Please, we've nothing. Beggars on the street with\
  \ only rags to warm us. Be merciful.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Slickspit speaksit. Beggums?\
  \ Nawsayit. Gots glit, betsa.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Rippem. Takem.\"</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ came the sound of stomping, and Larem realized his companion had charged the wererats.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Dargley, stop!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Gotta keen edgit! Guttem red!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Several fleshy smacks resounded. Metal clanged. Dargley's roar turned\
  \ to a wail. A heavy body hit the ground and the fight ended before Larem barely\
  \ registered the exchange.</p> \n     <p>One wererat coughed and gagged, while the\
  \ other screeched. </p> \n     <p>\"Soons stitched and gutback, unnastand? Gonnas\
  \ scalp all.\"</p> \n     <p>Larem braced for another attack, but claws clicked\
  \ over stone and drew away. One must be dragging the other out of the alley. Once\
  \ the sounds of their departure had faded, he got on hands and knees and searched\
  \ for his companion's body. </p> \n     <p>Desna, please, show mercy. He couldn't\
  \ lose both in one night. </p> \n     <p>\"Dargley?\"</p> \n     <p>Larem's hand\
  \ finally found Dargley's head. Roughened skin all over. Half-melted nose and pitted\
  \ cheeks scarred by acidic secretions, like Larem's eyes. </p> \n     <p>He patted\
  \ down Dargley's body for damage. He still breathed, at least, though with a ragged\
  \ edge to each intake. What had he used to drive the wererats off? It had sounded\
  \ like a blade fight. But since Dargley's gone simple, Beetle and Larem hadn't allowed\
  \ him to carry a weapon, certain he'd hurt himself.</p> \n     <p>His fingers touched\
  \ a hilt, and a jolt of energy shot through him.</p> \n     <p>Larem jerked away.\
  \ Then, with a shaking hand, he found the weapon again. This time, the tingle of\
  \ power was undeniable, and he picked out a spiraling teardrop design that coiled\
  \ up the hilt to a pair of eyes engraved on the crosspiece.</p> \n     <p>The Weeping\
  \ Blade.</p> \n     <p>His heart crumbled as he felt the dagger's keen edge. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Oh, Dargley. What've you done?\"</p> \n     <p><i>See and despair.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>An invisible claw clutched Larem's mind and yanked. The world twisted\
  \ about him, and for the first time in years, he could see.</p> \n     <p>But not\
  \ the alley. A cavern. No—a tomb. The Tomb of Annuram. </p> \n     <p>In one corner\
  \ of the ancient chamber, a fire lit a makeshift camp. Three men argued among themselves\
  \ until one rose and rushed toward the back of the cavern. The other two restrained\
  \ him, going so far as to bind his arms and legs and leaving him to struggle while\
  \ they finished their simple meal.</p> \n     <p>Larem knew the scene well, though\
  \ he'd never seen it from this angle.</p> \n     <p>Beetle continued to struggle\
  \ even after Larem and Dargley fell asleep, but after another hour of futile escape\
  \ attempts, he slipped into a snooze himself.</p> \n     <p>Mere minutes after Beetle\
  \ started snoring, Dargley's eyes opened, and he rolled to his feet. After ensuring\
  \ he hadn't woken the others, he slipped off to the area he'd just helped Larem\
  \ keep Beetle from visiting. </p> \n     <p>He returned half an hour later and stared\
  \ at the other two with a wild look. The inhuman expression slowly faded, until\
  \ he appeared closer to his normal self, though a dangerous glint remained in his\
  \ eyes. He returned to his sleeping roll, the bulge of a new dagger under his leather\
  \ armor.</p> \n     <p><i>Dargley. No...</i></p> \n     <p> Scenes flashed by: Dargley\
  \ pocketing an employer's pay and claiming they'd been cheated. Dargley altering\
  \ maps to guide them into dangerous territories. Dargley not warning them of traps...\
  \ delaying coming to their aid in fights... cutting their horses loose to strand\
  \ them with devils hot on their scent...</p> \n     <p>With each betrayal, Dargley\
  \ bent more to the dagger's sway. Yet he wasn't completely gone. His expression\
  \ during these episodes looked fraught, strained, as if something at his core fought\
  \ complete surrender. </p> \n     <p>That last bit of the original Dargley got its\
  \ chance during their trek through a kobold-infested swamp. With the natural heat\
  \ and humidity, neither Larem nor Beetle paid particular attention to the sweat\
  \ coursing down Dargley's face and neck as he waged his internal war.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The dagger's spirit knew of a giant flytrap that stalked the area, and wanted\
  \ to see the effects of the creature's acidic secretions on human flesh. But this\
  \ insidious ploy gave Dargley the impetus he needed for a final, fierce contest\
  \ of wills.</p> \n     <p>At the dagger's prompting, Dargley spotted the giant flytrap,\
  \ its mottled green exterior almost perfectly camouflaged against a nearby mossy\
  \ mound. Four toothy jaws waited for unsuspecting prey to wander too close. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Dargley let Larem and Beetle wander ahead, claiming the need to drain\
  \ muck out of his boots. As they forged off into the thick foliage, Dargley raised\
  \ one hand toward their backs in silent farewell.</p> \n     <p>Then, as the dagger's\
  \ spirit vainly tried to wrest control of his body, he sprinted for the flytrap\
  \ and threw himself and the dagger into the monstrous plant's nearest maw. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>His tortured screams, though muffled, had been loud enough to draw the\
  \ other two running back, blades bared. They'd assaulted the remaining three sets\
  \ of jaws, chopping barbed vines, dodging tentacle-like roots, growing increasingly\
  \ reckless as they fought to rescue their companion.</p> \n     <p>Then jaws clamped\
  \ around Beetle's legs and dragged him down. Desperate, Larem had produced an explosive\
  \ magical amulet and flung it into one of the plant's remaining mouths. The pod\
  \ had exploded, sending the creature slumping to the ground—and sending acid splattering\
  \ into Larem's eyes.</p> \n     <p>Larem wanted to look away, to forego sight once\
  \ again if it meant not having to watch this, but the vision wouldn't let him. Helpless,\
  \ he watched himself stagger blindly to the pod holding Dargley, still screaming,\
  \ and lever it open with his sword. Together, they had hauled Beetle out of the\
  \ monster's sizzling remains.</p> \n     <p>Their burns had healed over time. The\
  \ creature's acid bite had cauterized Beetle's severed legs, keeping him from from\
  \ bleeding out, while Larem's eyes never recovered. In a way, Dargley was the worst:\
  \ unable to breathe inside the suffocating tomb of the plant's pod, he had gone\
  \ soft in the head, and never spoken right again. After that, it was all a slow\
  \ and agonizing path back to Magnimar's filthiest alleys.</p> \n     <p>Dargley's\
  \ plan to kill himself and save the men he called brothers had failed dramatically—\
  yet not completely. Due to the damage to Dargley's mind, the dagger's influence\
  \ over him had been subdued. Still, he clung to the cursed blade out of a buried\
  \ impulse—and it continued to prompt actions he didn't understand. </p> \n     <p>More\
  \ recent scenes flickered through Larem's mind. Dargley catching coins before they\
  \ landed in Larem's beggar bowl... swapping out Master Ulus' healing elixirs for\
  \ worthless mixes... supplying Beetle with ale to fuel his fury.</p> \n     <p><i>Your\
  \ despair has been delicious.</i></p> \n     <p>Larem's world turned black again.\
  \ He still clutched the dagger's hilt. Dargley remained insensate before him. His\
  \ arm quivered as he raised the dagger over the prone man's chest.</p> \n     <p><i>Pay\
  \ him back for destroying your lives. It's the least he deserves.</i></p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Does he?\" Larem whispered. \"All his actions stemmed from you.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p><i>He took the first step, thinking to claim me. That was his downfall.\
  \ None can own me. But I could abide a partnership.</i></p> \n     <p>\"With a blind\
  \ man? You'd cast me aside within the first week.\"</p> \n     <p><i>With my guidance,\
  \ there will be no end to your rewards. I know where hoards of treasure are buried.\
  \ Wouldn't you enjoy returning to your former life?</i></p> \n     <p>\"And what\
  \ happens to the others?\"</p> \n     <p><i>The cripple and the halfwit? Damaged\
  \ goods would just hold you back.</i></p> \n     <p>Larem cocked his head. \"Perhaps\
  \ you're right. It <i>is</i> time to move on. However, I also owe money to some\
  \ quite persistent men. These buried treasures you mentioned...\"</p> \n     <p><i>The\
  \ smallest trove I can lead you to is enough to pay them back, purchase a healing\
  \ spell for your eyes, and outfit your own mercenary band.</i></p> \n     <p>\"\
  What of the wight? It'll continue to pursue us, and I don't relish the thought of\
  \ constant running.\"</p> \n     <p><i>With hired swords and spellcasters at your\
  \ side, the next time it shows itself, you can reduce it to so much offal and ash.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"True enough. Very well.\" Larem stood and stepped over his fallen\
  \ companion. </p> \n     <p><i>Showing mercy?</i></p> \n     <p>He dealt Dargley\
  \ a swift heel-kick to the ribs. The man moaned but didn't wake.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  He'll suffer more, living with what he's done.\"</p> \n     <p><i>I anticipate great\
  \ things from you already.</i></p> \n     <p>Larem grinned. \"Let's settle some\
  \ debts.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Larem's feet kept\
  \ sinking into the muck as he waited, hands clasped behind his back, shoulders wide—\
  a confident posture he'd not held in years. </p> \n     <p>He stood on the Maidens'\
  \ Midden, one of the Dungsweepers' Guilds refuse yards, so named for the bargain-priced\
  \ brothel that stood near its gate. A few steps away loomed a storm drain large\
  \ enough to lead a horse through. The unique bouquet of raw sewage hung about like\
  \ a rancid fog. Breathing through his mouth made the stench bearable, though he\
  \ clamped down on the occasional stomach spasm. Hopefully he wouldn't have to wait\
  \ long. But then, if he did, he had much larger problems than a simple stink.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ah. By the cursing and squelching, his anticipated guest had at last\
  \ arrived. His pulse accelerated as the newcomer summitted the mound and spotted\
  \ him.</p> \n     <p>\"I hardly enjoy being called like a servant,\" Samphy said.\
  \ \"Especially to such a delightful place.\"</p> \n     <p>Larem bowed. \"I wouldn't\
  \ have asked to meet here without good reason.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What's this about,\
  \ then? You can't possibly have the money already.\" A sly chuckle. \"Unless you\
  \ lied about not having it in the first place. Or stole it. In either case, I might\
  \ require a little extra to forgive you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't have it yet,\
  \ no,\" Larem said. \"But I've determined the location of an ancient treasure that\
  \ will more than repay what I owe. I simply need you to allow me to retrieve it.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Samphy wheezed laughter. \"You think I'll let you run off after some\
  \ imaginary treasure? You'll never return.\"</p> \n     <p>Larem drew the Weeping\
  \ Blade from his rags. On contact, the spirit's voice slipped into his head.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Canceling your debts more directly? Bold, but admirable.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Samphy's voice tensed. \"Beggarman wants a fight? I can't say this will\
  \ be fair... but it could be fun.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No fighting,\" Larem said. \"\
  Instead, I offer a token of sincerity. This blade originates from the very treasure\
  \ I speak of. Alone, it's worth ten times my debt, but I give it freely as a guarantee.\"\
  </p> \n     <p><i>What? You dare—</i></p> \n     <p>\"Catch.\" Larem tossed the\
  \ Weeping Blade toward Samphy. The thug swore, but by the lack of a thump or splash,\
  \ Larem knew he'd caught it. </p> \n     <p>Larem spun toward the storm drain and\
  \ yelled, \"I choose him as the blood price! Take your sacrifice and begone!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A resounding clang let him know the drain's grate had just swung open,\
  \ admitting another anticipated guest.</p> \n     <p>\"What the hell...?\" cried\
  \ Samphy.</p> \n     <p>A roar. A clatter of bones. A scream and a body slapped\
  \ into the muck. </p> \n     <p>Larem focused on where the air held an unearthly\
  \ chill. \"You've got your damned blade back. Where's Beetle? If he's not—\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I's here and I's thirsty,\" Beetle called from by the grate. \"This\
  \ creature wouldn't s'much as let me have a sip.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Our bargain is\
  \ complete,\" the wight said in its sepulchral tones. \"Though I question the soul\
  \ that sealed it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You never said it had to be one of us. Just\
  \ that I had a choice.\" Larem pointed at it. \"Swear you'll bury that thing deep.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Laughter made his spine clench. \"Where I take it, none shall discover\
  \ until the very foundations of this world are undone.\"</p> \n     <p>There was\
  \ another clatter of bones, and then the storm drain's grate clanged shut. The sound\
  \ of steps retreated into the distance. </p> \n     <p>He trudged over to the grate\
  \ and found Beetle with arms wrapped over a bar to hold himself above the sludge.\
  \ He tried to check him for wounds, but the other man slapped his hands away.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Were you tortured?\"</p> \n     <p>Beetle blew a raspberry. \"Nicked\
  \ me a bit, but what's a few more scars? How'd you convince that thing you's gots\
  \ the blade?</p> \n     <p>For a moment, Larem almost told him everything—what Dargley\
  \ had done and how they'd ended up destitute.</p> \n     <p>Then he shrugged. \"\
  Stole an ornate blade from a smithy and convinced a drunk wizard to lay a charm\
  \ on it. Seemed to suffice.\"</p> \n     <p>Beetle laughed. \"There's the scoundrel\
  \ I's know! Always ready wit' a fool's gamble. Where's Dargley got off to?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Left him behind so he wouldn't get hurt.\" He sat, unmindful of the\
  \ sewage seeping through his threadbare pants. \"This whole encounter got me thinking.\
  \ Perhaps it's time we returned to our old ways in a new fashion.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Wot... back to adventurin'?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Couldn't be worse than squatting around\
  \ these streets. You can be my eyes, Dargley can be your legs, and I'll provide\
  \ enough intellect to make up for both of you.\"</p> \n     <p>Beetle chortled.\
  \ \"Worth a try, eh? But where we gonna begin?\"</p> \n     <p>Larem grinned as\
  \ he reviewed the mental map the dagger's spirit had sketched out for him during\
  \ their chat.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, I've encountered rumors of certain treasures that\
  \ are just waiting for the right opportunists to come along...\"</p> \n     <p align=\"\
