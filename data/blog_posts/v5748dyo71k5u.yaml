  \ Being in the same port as the <em>Pixie</em> always put her in a sour mood. It’\
  d been years since the Decemvirate all but purchased the ship from her by “gifting”\
  \ her the vessel she and her crew currently sailed. The new vessel—she’d cheekily\
  \ named it the <em>Glorious Payoff</em>—never quite made its mark on her the way\
  \ her old ship had. The<em> Payoff</em> certainly wasn’t inferior to the <em>Grinning\
  \ Pixie</em>. Hells, being a newer vessel even made it superior in many ways. But\
  \ the <em>Pixie </em>wasn’t just a ship, it was a lodge. And she never realized\
  \ what that meant until she was no longer aboard.</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n\

  ></a></td>\n        </tr>\n       </tbody>\n      </table>\n      <p>Her ship—her\
  \ <em>former</em> ship, she mentally chided herself once again—held so much excitement.\
  \ More than she and her crew ever expected when they decided not to rob the agents\
  \ that hired her for transport all those years ago. Piracy was boring in comparison—\
  a realization that vexes her every time she sees her former vessel, and one hitting\
  \ especially hard today.</p>\n      <p>“Enough o’ this!” she scolded herself. “\
  Eras would laugh like there’s no tomorrow if I was mopin’ like this where he could\
  \ see.” She’d talked herself back onto the <em>Pixie</em> several times for “joint\
  \ operations,” but Eras the Needle, the <em>Grinning Pixie</em>’s current venture-captain,\
  \ had finally had enough of that excuse. She’d accidentally tried to take command\
  \ too many times, seems like. “Ship’s not mine anymore. Never really was. Faster\
  \ you get that into your thick skull, Calisro, the faster we can get past it.” She\
  \ gazed at her reflection in the polished shield in her captain’s stateroom, the\
  \ closest thing to a mirror she bothered to keep. “You’re a gods-damned pirate,\
  \ and even if you don’t care for theft like you used to, the sailing’s still in\
  \ your blood. ’Sides, it’s not like we gave up on the piracy entirely.” A grin crossed\
  \ her face as she thought of the countless Aspis transports and merchants flying\
  \ Chelaxian colors she’d hit, and less savory types as well. “Besmara’ll see me\
  \ drowned if I turn into a dour mess every time that ship’s in port with me.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>She looked into the mirrored shield, determination overtaking her features.\
  \ “The <em>Payoff</em> don’t feel like mine ’cause I haven’t let it. Haven’t given\
  \ it the chance to be the ship it deserves to be. The crew, too. They’re restless.\
  \ They stayed out because this Society gig was as exciting for them as it was for\
  \ me.” She began to pace across her cabin. “I’ll be damned if I spend my time sulking\
  \ over that ship one more day. If adventure and the unknown is what made that ship\
  \ feel like mine, then I believe we’ll just have to find some more.” She pulled\
  \ out her sea charts, looking over ports and routes. “Been there. And there. Dozens\
  \ of times there. Been all over this whole gods-damned Inner Sea ten times over\
  \ or more. In <em>that ship</em>.” A realization slowly dawned on her face. “Then\
  \ we’ll just go beyond.”</p>\n      <p>She dug through her charts, finding some\
  \ older ones purchased long ago and never used. “Let’s hope that blasted Godsrain\
  \ didn’t affect these routes too much.” She smiled to herself. “Hells, even if they\
  \ did, it’ll just make things more interesting. Crew’s been dying for interesting.\
  \ We’ll be going where the Society’s never been.” She rushed out her door and shouted\
  \ for her first mate, an old iruxi salt named Ixfial who’d proven his worth countless\
  \ times after she came into possession of the <em>Glorious Payoff</em>. Much of\
  \ her crew had stayed from her old days as a Free Captain of the Shackles, but some\
  \ had left to join that foolhardy assault on the Whispering Tyrant. They never returned.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“What’s the word, captain?” the tall, silver-scaled sailor asked, clearly\
  \ ready to be back on the open sea himself.</p>\n      <p>“We’re set to sail? Water\
  \ and provisions all aboard? I know we’ve got that kineticist we picked up in Riddleport,\
  \ but I don’t want all our eggs in one basket.” She looked out over the crew and\
  \ could sense the same restlessness she was feeling.</p>\n      <p>“Aye, captain.\
  \ Ready at your command,” he said, grinning at seeing his captain acting more like\
  \ herself.</p>\n      <p>“Consider the command given. We sail for Iblydos.” Calisro’\
  s gaze was fixed on the southern horizon, opposite the bustle of Absalom to the\
  \ ship’s north.</p>\n      <p>“Iblydos? But we’ve never…”</p>\n      <p>“Sailed\
  \ those waters? Of course not! But we’re damned well going to fix that. A little\
  \ voyage somewhere new wouldn’t cause you to molt on me, would it?” She grinned,\
  \ chiding her first officer.</p>\n      <p>He recovered, a fierce smile now covering\
  \ his face. This was the captain he knew. “Of course not, captain!” He turned to\
  \ the crew and began to shout orders, readying the vessel to sail south.</p>\n \
  \     <p>As her crew began the arduous work of preparing the vessel, Calisro walked\
  \ back to her cabin. “Decemvirate thinks they can just buy me off,” she muttered.\
  \ “I’m a damned venture-captain, same as Eras. Can set up shop wherever I please.\
  \ A pirate beyond that. Can plunder where I please. This is my ship, and the <em>Glorious\
  \ Payoff</em> will see to it that we earn its namesake. No one else at the Society\
  \ to get in my way, no existing relationships to worry about or scoldings from Eliza\
  \ or that thrice-damned Decemvirate for ‘causing trouble.’ That lot didn’t seem\
  \ to mind too much when I captured six Aspis caravels in as many days.”</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Her old ship now entirely forgotten, she turned back to her charts. “Let’\
  s see what the waters of the Kardaji Bay can offer me. Can’t imagine it’ll be boring.”\
