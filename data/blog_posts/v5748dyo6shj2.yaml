  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Mazes are sometimes\
  \ just the thing a story needs, but they aren’t usually much fun in RPGs. A lot\
  \ of the “we don’t know which way to go” feeling is lost when the players around\
  \ the table see the map in a top-down way. Here’s an easy way to include a maze-like\
  \ experience in your games.</p> \n      <p>First, decide on an entrance, an exit,\
  \ and an optional area, like a room with some treasure or a helpful clue—something\
  \ that isn’t necessary for the heroes to find but that could aid them. You should\
  \ also choose a minor hindrance the heroes might stumble into, which should impose\
  \ a condition like being clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied. </p> \n      <p>Let’s\
  \ apply this to a maze of kobold warrens, clawed out of the earth, braced with rickety\
  \ wooden posts, and barely large enough for humans to navigate. The kobolds have\
  \ stolen some trinkets from town, and our heroes need to get them back. In our kobold\
  \ warrens, let’s use the following:</p> \n      <p><b>Entrance</b>: The warren entry\
  \ is guarded by three kobold warriors (Pathfinder Bestiary 212). That’s an encounter\
  \ of Low difficulty for 1st-level heroes. </p> \n      <p><b>Exit</b>: The warren’\
  s center is where a kobold dragon mage (Pathfinder Bestiary 213) and another kobold\
  \ warrior have stashed the stolen trinkets. This encounter is of Moderate difficulty\
  \ for 1st-level heroes.</p> \n      <p><b>Optional</b>: The kobolds have a trap-making\
  \ room with a lesser bottled lightning, a lesser tanglefoot bag, and a pile with\
  \ everything needed to create two spike snares.</p> \n      <p><b>Hindrance</b>:\
  \ The warrens are full of traps like caltrops that lodge into boots (or feet!),\
  \ entwining ropes, or similar inconveniences that make intruders clumsy until they\
  \ have the time and space to get themselves free of the spikes, hooks, and knots.</p>\

  \ take? Illustration by Jessé Suursoo.</p>\n      </div> \n      <h3>In the Warrens</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>The passages are so narrow that one hero must lead the others. The\
  \ hero in the lead must attempt DC 15 Survival checks, each taking 10 minutes (this\
  \ DC should be one appropriate for the party’s level; for 1st-level heroes, DC 15\
  \ works just fine). Other heroes can Aid this leader’s Survival check (Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook 470). Once they accumulate four successes, they’ve reached the warren’\
  s center. The heroes can return to the surface at any time by retracing their steps,\
  \ but this reduces the successes they’ve earned to zero and, if they return, they\
  \ must start again. </p> \n      <p><b>Critical Success</b> The party makes good\
  \ progress in the maze, earning two successes. On their first critical success,\
  \ they also spot the side passage leading to the trap-making room and can collect\
  \ the treasures there.</p> \n      <p><b>Success</b> The party earns one success\
  \ towards solving the maze.</p> \n      <p><b>Failure</b> The party stumbles into\
  \ a kobold trap! Each hero must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become\
  \ clumsy 1 until they are out of the warrens and take an hour to untangle themselves\
  \ from the detritus. Failed saves from multiple kobold traps increases this condition,\
  \ to a maximum of clumsy 3. </p> \n      <p><b>Critical Failure</b> As failure,\
  \ and the heroes inadvertently return to the warren entrance, losing any progress\
  \ they’ve made. </p> \n      <p>How will the heroes of Otari fare in the kobold\
