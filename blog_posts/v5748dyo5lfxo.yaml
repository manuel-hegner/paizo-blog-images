  >I'm writing this Friday morning sitting in gate B1 of the Seattle-Tacoma International\
  \ Airport, waiting for a flight that will take me to Austin. While I'm in town I\
  \ will be spending a lot of time hatching plans with Brandon Hodge, one of my favorite\
  \ Pathfinder authors. Brandon is the mad genius who brought us the fan-favorite\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8yv5\"><i>Rasputin Must Die!</i></a> in the fifth volume\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter Adventure\
  \ Path</a>.</span></p> \n     <p>When we came up with the idea of sending the Adventure\
  \ Path heroes to a variety of exotic worlds via the magic of Baba Yaga's Hut, it\
  \ was probably inevitable that one of us would come up with the idea of using the\
  \ Mother of Witches' real home—Russia. You know, on Earth.</p> \n     <p>Mention\
  \ Russia in a room of nerds like us, and it's only a matter of time before someone\
  \ brings up Rasputin. We all got so excited about the idea of the player characters\
  \ encountering Rasputin (and trying to kill him, of course), that we didn't ever\
  \ really stop to consider whether it was a good or bad idea for the Pathfinder brand.\
  \ We just knew it got our blood pumping, and that it was a way to inject an unexpected\
  \ left turn into a line that had already seen more than 60 adventures.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>We knew we were in love. It was too late to turn back, and we didn't want\
  \ to turn back, anyway. But we knew that the idea would be controversial, and that\
  \ most gamers would have their default set to \"skeptical.\" Convincing folks to\
  \ give it a try meant getting the right ideas, and getting the right ideas meant\
  \ getting the right author.</p> \n     <p>We immediately thought of Brandon Hodge.\
  \ In addition to having strong adventure design fundamentals and just being an all-around\
  \ professional and affable guy, Brandon had already written killer adventures and\
  \ articles for us that included a pervasive sense of grounding in real world facts\
  \ and mythology. He was our guy.</p> \n     <p>The adventure came out. It was really,\
  \ really popular—certainly the most talked-about adventure since <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\"\
  >Kingmaker</a>. </p> \n     <p>Several months later we made the decision to produce\
  \ a line of figures based off of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>, I had to face the daunting prospect of including\
  \ modern World War I era figures in the set. I did this with the full understanding\
  \ that enjoying reading or even playing an unusual adventure is a one-time thing,\
  \ but adding miniatures to your collection is forever. </p> \n     <p>A figure like\
  \ a <a href=\"/products/btpy8qjq\">Lich</a> or even something like the amazing <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8wtb\">Clockwork Reliquary</a> might only come out once a\
  \ campaign, but it isn't too difficult to imagine finding a use for it again down\
  \ the road. </p> \n     <p>But a guy with a gun and a gas mask? How many uses are\
  \ you going to get out of that?</p> \n     <p>So I knew I needed some modern figures\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>. I knew I couldn't include\
  \ too many, as some folks are going to be very difficult to convince. So the ones\
  \ we used had to be worth it.</p> \n     <p>They had to be awesome.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ week, I present the results of our efforts. For those of you looking for a way\
  \ to stage an amazing run of one of the best adventures we've ever published, I\
  \ hope you put these to use and appreciate these figures. For those who would prefer\
  \ that we not have included them at all, I hope you appreciate them as at least\
  \ attractive necessary evils. </p> \n     <p>Speaking of evil, here's Rasputin:</p>\

  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Rasputin_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This is the man himself. Grigori Rasputin, the\
  \ unkillable Russian mystic who serves as a major villain in the Reign of Winter\
  \ Adventure Path. Although drawn from Earth history, there's not too much about\
  \ this figure that defines it as \"modern,\" so our boy Rasputin also easily doubles\
  \ as a wizard or cleric in a smart coat. Rasputin is a Medium, rare miniature.</p>\

  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RussianSoldier_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have the Russian Soldier of\
  \ World War I. Gas mask. Rifle. Hand grenade. The gas mask and long coat give the\
  \ Russian Soldier a kind of otherworldly quality that makes them seem less out of\
  \ place in a fantasy setting, but basically, they're Russians. The Russian Soldier\
  \ is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Bedecked in a gray coat and cool hat\
  \ and wielding one major machine gun is the Russian Machine Gunner. This Medium\
  \ figure is slated at the common rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up today is Polkovnik Lavrenti,\
  \ a dullahan soldier riding a nightmare. Check out the clear plastic effects on\
  \ the horse and the heads dangling from the saddle. Creepy! You've got to look pretty\
  \ hard to see the modern elements on this guy, so throw him down on the table in\
  \ any campaign and watch players shudder in fear. Sweet. Polkovnik Lavrenti is a\
  \ Large, rare figure.</p> \n     <p>And that's it for the explicitly modern figures\
  \ in the set. We'll see you next week for more reveals. There are many more monsters\
  \ to come!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br \\> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div> \n \
