  \ the end of my review of the</em> Godsrain Prophecies, <em>I’m reaching the part\
  \ of any research project that’s the most daunting—the conclusion. While it will\
  \ of course be up to my Lady to decide what, if anything, to do with these prophecies,\
  \ I plan to present her with the two or three reasons for their existence that I\
  \ believe are the most plausible (other than them all being true, which I maintain\
  \ is nearly impossible).</em></p>\n      <p><em>Unfortunately, this need for clarity\
  \ means that I must dismiss (or at least deemphasize) one of the more exciting ideas\
  \ I have come up with thus far: that these are a collection of the gods’ fears.\
  \ I have noted throughout these pages that there are responses to the gods’ deaths\
  \ in each of the prophecies that seem out of character, either for the other gods\
  \ or their followers, but I don’t believe this lack of consistency is due to these\
  \ being reflections of what a god would worry over. In truth, I am not sure that\
  \ gods fear anything at all. Is fear not driven by a sense of mortality, or at least,\
  \ the potential for one’s role in the world to change or end at a moment’s notice?\
  \ I wonder if, instead, the “prophecies” are intended to help the gods develop fear,\
  \ to remind them that they are not beyond the reach of death and give them a small\
  \ taste of mortal terror. Though to what end, I do not know. Who would want to give\
  \ a god a nightmare?</em></p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>–Yivali,\

  \ <br>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n       <br>\n      </center>\n      <h2>The “\
  Death” of Irori</h2>\n      <p>Irori is not one for dying. Death is common. Death\
  \ is normal. Death is there for mortals who have not yet mastered how to reach new\
  \ levels of perfection, who have not willed themselves into attaining the divine.\
  \ Death might take some weaker god if given the right circumstances, starting with\
  \ those cheaters who let the <em>Starstone</em> grant them power, grabbing godhood\
  \ like some prize for drunks and thieves and zealots. But for a god like him, who’\
  d worked and willed himself to godhood? Death is something of the past and he is\
  \ moving forward.</p>\n      <p>Irori’s never rested long, no matter his successes.\
  \ There’s always some new path to take at any well-earned milestone, some new technique\
  \ to master, some new knowledge to find. Yes, it was good to be a god, if for no\
  \ other reason than to share new possibilities with those who’d turn their will\
  \ toward doing better with their lives. But he is one of many gods—some virtuous,\
  \ some indolent—and so there must be something more, some way that he can still\
  \ evolve. Some new route toward perfection.</p>\n      <p>Irori works with diligence,\
  \ the way that he has always done, reaching beyond the world he’s known to better\
  \ what he has become. Until one day, he grasps it all—the spaces in the sum of things,\
  \ the power in the truth of everything that was or will be. And though total enlightenment\
  \ is only for a moment, slipping between his fingers like a cloud of windblown sand,\
  \ he still can feel the barrier between himself and something more, as pliable and\
  \ thin as what once kept him from divinity. While he has it in his reach, he passes\
  \ through the boundary, as bracing and as easy as a step through falling water.\
  \ Irori, once a mortal, is now much more than deity.</p>\n      <p>Irori savors\
  \ everything, if only for a moment. He takes a breath in every plane, his heartbeat\
  \ now a multiverse, and feels the coursing power as it crashes through his veins.\
  \ But he has departed our reality, has left a tear along the border of the way of\
  \ things, and everything, on every plane, begins to shift toward him, as if he were\
  \ a beacon for something within the Great Beyond—a single life, a single god, become\
  \ a singularity. Gruhastha is the first to fall, the Keeper’s arms stretched uselessly,\
  \ hands grasping at the emptiness he finds beside Irori’s feet. He’s swallowed by\
  \ a void that somehow still contains a multitude, his body torn asunder in a bright\
  \ and blissful darkness, his lips mouthing his gratitude, his throat choking on\
  \ screams.</p>\n      <p>Irori is a magnet now, pulling those closest to him; Chaldira’\
  s luck lost in a cry while Magrim’s runes go tumbling, some force dragging them\
  \ both to places even he can’t follow. All he can do is close the gap before it\
  \ sunders everything, using the power that he holds, still far beyond what it once\
  \ was, to fix whatever he has done (or is doing or one day will, time half-unraveling\
  \ in his hands). As he repairs the barrier, still dripping with the power that he\
  \ touched from passing through it, Zon-Kuthon comes to stand beside him, image of\
  \ the blinding void reflected in his longing eyes, and Nethys tries to touch the\
  \ power nestled just beneath his skin, hands clawing unknown patterns of magic in\
  \ the air. Both soon become his shadows, hounding every move he tries to make, Zon-Kuthon\
  \ chasing memories and Nethys seeking answers, with Torag always close behind, holding\
  \ his brother Magrim’s blade with vengeance on his mind. Some of Irori’s followers\
  \ also trail behind him; those who were deep in prayer at the moment that he moved\
  \ beyond, unable to unsee the void, dedicate themselves to its return, doing whatever\
  \ they can to hasten the end of all things.</p>\n      <p>But Irori has a new path\
  \ now, divinity left far behind as he masters the power that’s now deep within his\
  \ bones. He sees things now—beneath the ground, between the breaths, inside the\
  \ skin—and knows that they will take him where Gruhastha and the rest have gone,\
  \ that what tore them apart will help him make himself anew. If there are prayers\
  \ for him to hear, he is no longer listening. If rakshasas take his guise and use\
  \ his faith to build their power? If Urgathoa’s clerics tell his followers that\
  \ next time he will end the world and they should eat and drink and die with no\
  \ thought for tomorrow? How can he care when there’s a new path for him to gain\
  \ perfection? And if the world unmakes itself, if he had to unmake the world, if\
  \ that brings him enlightenment, then that’s what it must be.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ I chose, I would hate for her to learn a piece of information in these notes that\
  \ would be better divulged by the original text. Still, I am reminded of the prophecy\
  \ regarding Desna, which also mentions a void. And there are similarities between\
  \ this prophecy and the one for Nethys, not only in their reciprocal mentions but\
  \ in their fascination with the fundamental properties of our universe. Perhaps\
  \ instead of looking at the prophecies individually, I should be looking for these\
  \ types of commonalities—could things that are repeated be elements of some underlying\
  \ message, or a hint as to what among these “prophecies” might be true amidst the\
  \ overstatements and suppositions? If there was ever a time to make a chart, that\
