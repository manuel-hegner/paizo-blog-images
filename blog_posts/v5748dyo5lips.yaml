  \ Your Armor, Let Me Be Your Shield</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Spellcasters are the focus of legend and envy. Weapon\
  \ masters are flashy and famous. Armor masters?</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Armor\
  \ masters are survivors.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The reason the best\
  \ offense is a good defense is the undefended die, which tends to end any effort\
  \ at offense. The life of adventurers, crusaders, and champions of any cause is\
  \ filled with dangers and enemies. Hammers seek to crush heads, spears seek to pierce\
  \ flesh. Unless you've mastered some esoteric fighting style likely to allow you\
  \ to dodge crossbow bolts, or have the skill (and time) to defend yourself with\
  \ spells, you need armor. And anything you depend on to save your life is worth\
  \ learning to master.</p> \n    <p>So who are the armor masters of the Inner Sea?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The horse tribe nomads of Karazh have learned to balance the weight of\
  \ their armor in the saddle, so it does not hamper their skilled riding.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The Knights of Arnisant follow in the footsteps of the famous general who\
  \ was crucial to the defeat of the Whispering Tyrant. They depend on their shields\
  \ to guard not just their bodies, but also their minds and souls against incorporeal\
  \ undead, curse-flinging witches, and the death magic of necromancers.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The Kortos Cavalry are Absalom's only mounted troops, protecting the island's\
  \ hinterlands as well as the Westgate district and training to fight to the last.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The yojimbos are samurai dedicated to protecting others, and their resolve\
  \ is not focused on just their own needs. Each can act as a living shield, standing\
  \ between a chosen ally and a deadly foe, but through force of will can also inspire\
  \ an ally to overcome fatigue, or at higher levels allow and ally to stave off fear,\
  \ nausea, and even death.</p> \n    <p>And anyone trusting armor from leather to\
  \ plate can learn at least a few armored tricks to help themselves survive, whether\
  \ it's combinging the power of your attacks with the weight of your armor with Intense\
  \ Blow, expending stamina to more effectively use Redirect Attack, or just learning\
  \ to fight from rafters and walls while wearing an arachnid harness.</p> \n    <div\
