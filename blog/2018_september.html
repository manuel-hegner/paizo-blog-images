               <p>As the book's release date approaches, we'll share more information about what you can expect to find in its pages. For instance, a number of Paizo staffers picked up their game-design pens to create some awesome playable races, and some of these illustrious authors will detail their inspirations in their own words. Further, we'll spill some data about other player-facing rules in this tome, including polymorph rules and the new pieces of gear detailed.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>But for now, feast your eyes on some of creatures that you'll find in this book.</p> 
               <p>There's the squox—no, not a space fox, but a squirrel fox, as some Pact Worlders once dubbed it. The squox is a pet that, naturally, is associated with the carrier colloquially called a "squox pocket."</p> 
               <p>Then there's the glass serpent, the Gargantuan beast known for its natural invisibility. Aside from its ability to sneakily devour its prey, we're not sure why a glass serpent wouldn't want to be seen. Isn't it beautiful?</p> 
               <p>Finally, no new book of aliens would be complete without some more starship-sized monstrosities. There's the vermelith, which is capable of swallowing your entire party and their hard-earned ship in a single bite. Encountering this behemoth in the Drift might be a bad day indeed.</p>

From firing planar energy in the form of bullets with the planar rifter archetype, to calling eidolons created from unique to planar energies, to calling upon an outsider to serve as a mentor, characters have loads of options for every class. The book also holds options for the various planar scion races, such as aasimars and tieflings, but also options for some of the newer races like aphorites, duskwalkers, ganzis, and shabti!</p> 
               <p>If you're looking to travel the planes or just make a character with a splash of planar influence, then make sure to pick up <i>Plane-Hopper's Handbook</i>!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">We're reaching the two-month mark, and playtest results for our <a href="/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios/pathfinderPlaytest">first three Pathfinder Playtest scenarios</a> are rolling in. By far, we're seeing that the largest amount of feedback came in over the first two weeks of the playtest, with the two 5th-level scenarios steadily receiving survey results each week. This feedback's been really valuable in analyzing what does and doesn't work in these adventures, so please do continue to playtest and encourage everyone to <a href="/pathfinderplaytest">let us know what they think</a>. The surveys have been averaging about 3-5 minutes for player surveys and about 5-7 minutes for GM surveys.</p> 
               <p>We're not just here to talk about surveys, though. I'd also like to highlight a few special topics: an updated appendix format in <a href="/products/btpzgd7o?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-4-The-Frozen-Oath">Pathfinder Playtest #4: The Frozen Oath</a> and our imminent re-release of <a href="/products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak">Pathfinder Playtest #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak</a> to test out the updated resonance rules.</p> 
               <h2>The Frozen Oath</h2> 
               <p>As a quick reminder, this 10th-level scenario is available for download now. However, unlike the other playtest scenarios so far, this adventure does not include any pregenerated characters. It's important to either schedule time during the event for your players to create their own, or have everyone create a character before the game.</p> 
               <p>We'll have the player, GM, and open response surveys up on the site shortly.</p> 
               <h2>A New Appendix</h2> 
               <p>I've been going back and forth on different ideas to make the creature appendices more useful. Right now, scenarios print and custom creatures directly in the encounter, and any reprinted creatures (such as from a hardcover Bestiary) are reprinted in an appendix at the back of the adventure. On one hand, that's nice because it should cut down on the number of resources a GM needs to have on hand while running the adventure. That said, there's room for improvement, especially because this can lead to a fair amount of page flipping between the encounter description and the appendix during play.</p> 
               <p>That means experimenting with new creature stat block organization. Because scenarios are digital-only products with somewhat flexible page counts, we have a few options.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Include all of the creature stat blocks—custom and reprinted—directly into the encounter description.</li> 
                <li>Include none of the creature stat blocks in the encounter description. Instead place everything into the appendices.</li> 
                <li>Include the custom stat blocks in the encounter description, and expand the appendices to include all of the stat blocks that are necessary to run the adventure.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <p>The first option is certainly tempting because it places all of the information where a GM needs it, but in some cases that can be numerous pages of stat blocks across several subtiers. Based on some past scenarios with 3 subtiers, it's easy to start losing track of the adventure amid the many stat blocks—especially once they're interspersed with sidebars and creature illustrations. That also complicates one of the strong requests I've seen in the GM surveys: a desire to have stat blocks start and end on one page. The more those stat blocks are competing with other material, the harder it is to make them fit cleanly.</p> 
               <p>Well, the playtest is a time for experimentation! While developing "The Frozen Oath," I tried to fit in as much as I could. You'll find that the essential stat blocks for running a 4-player table appear directly in the encounters. Given this scenario doesn't have multiple subtiers, I could manage that; however, each of these stat block sections would be roughly double the length were this to be, say, a Tier 9-12 adventure. In practice, that might be too much to jam into a typical scenario's text.</p> 
               <p>I also changed how the stat block appendix looks. Rather than including all of the stat blocks in the same section and alphabetizing them, I broke down the appendix by encounter area, starting each one on a different page. Each encounter area's appendix now prints all of the stat blocks—both the ones already appearing in the adventure as well as every stat block necessary for scaling the encounter for larger groups. That way you can find all of the creature statistics all in one place, flipping pages less often or just printing off the pages you need.</p> 
               <p>Take a look, and let us know what you think.</p> 
               <h2>Raiders of Resonance Peak</h2> 
               <p>As the design team reviews playtest feedback, they've been busily revising systems and exploring new solutions. One of the major topics is resonance, which influences how often a PC can attune to and activate magic items. <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9r?Sending-Your-Heroes-to-the-Mirrored-Moon">They've developed a new approach that's launching in the coming weeks</a>, and to provide more avenues for playtesting it, the design team has created an updated version of "Pathfinder Playtest #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak" that includes revised rules for all of the treasure you could find. In addition, they're updated the 5th-level pregenerated characters to reflect this new resonance approach and the recent playtest errata to characters' starting skills (plus some minor corrections here and there). Once this new version comes out, you'll still be able to run either version for credit, and you'll report them both in the same way. Expect to see a special survey for this new version of the adventure.</p>

               <p>Today also marks the release of Update 1.3, which promises to deliver a number of substantive changes to your game. Before I launch into the details, why don't you go grab a copy?</p> 
               <blockquote>
                <div class="playtest-link" style="margin:2rem;font-family:Verdana;text-align:center;">

               </blockquote> 
               <p>So, first and foremost is a revision to the Proficiency and DCs of the game. As of today, if you're untrained in something, your bonus is now equal to your level -4! This change was made to ensure that characters who haven't specialized in a given skill or ability aren't directly competing with those who have made the choice to invest in it. We've also made significant alterations to Table 10-2, Skill DCs by Level and Difficulty. In most cases, we lowered the DC by a point or two (but sometimes by 4 or more at higher levels). We made this change so that players who focus their character choices around a task have a better chance of success and so that this chance of success grows as you do. As a result, we have included errata for all 7 parts of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, updating all of the skill DCs across the adventure to reflect this change.</p> 
               <p>Death and dying receives another revision in this update. After looking at playtest data, we saw a significant change in dying rates and play style due to the way that characters came back from being unconscious. As of this update, we have removed the slowed condition that applied to characters after they were revived, and we've replaced it with a new condition: the wounded condition. This condition doesn't penalize your checks or DCs, but if you fall unconscious again, your dying condition is increased by your wounded condition. This means that while you're not penalized directly for getting up and charging back into the fray, your chance of dying increases the more times you're knocked out in a fight.</p> 
               <p>To go along with this change, we've also added a new way to use the Medicine skill, allowing you to spend 10 minutes to bandage the wounds of up to six creatures (one of which can be you). Depending on the check, this allows you to heal a significant amount of damage to everyone under your care! The best part is, you don't have to be a cleric to use this ability and it doesn't rely on your magic resources, so you can save those for combat. We made this change so that out-of-combat healing was a bit easier to manage, which allows you to heal up between fights and rely a bit less on the classes that have access to magical healing.</p> 
               <p>Finally, there are a lot of smaller changes in this update, including revisions to a number of classes, most notably the ranger and the rogue, both of which got some much-needed versatility added to their builds. But there's one other gigantic addition I want to talk about.</p> 
               <h2>Multiclass Archetypes Update</h2> 
               <p>Today we're releasing playtest material for all 12 of the multiclass archetypes, along with some revisions to the existing multiclass archetypes found in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>. These additions expand your range of tools when building new characters. With these changes, you can now play a bard that dabbles in the strange mysteries of the monk, or a barbarian with a sorcerous lineage!</p> 
               <p>We put all of these archetypes in their own document for ease of reference.</p>

               </blockquote> 
               <h2>The Future of Resonance</h2> 
               <p>Since the start of the playtest, we have heard a lot of feedback on the resonance system and we have been working hard to come up with a way to make it a better part of the game. Currently, we're looking at ways to use the resonance system just for tracking the items you wear, purely as a replacement for the slot system from Pathfinder First Edition. At the same time, we're looking to add a system that allows you to focus on the magic that your character <i>can</i> utilize to give it a boost in power when you need to, but otherwise allowing you to use it in a simpler way in an emergency. It's a little early to go into too many details, but I will say this: under this new system, you'll always be healed when you drink a <i>healing potion</i>.</p> 
               <p>While our current plan for the system is still coming together, we know that a change of this size is going to be challenging for us to fully implement before the end of the playtest. But, we do have a way to ensure that you can give it a try before we're done. In the coming weeks we're going to release a special version of the Pathfinder Society Playtest Scenario <em>Raiders of the Shrieking Peak</em>. This adventure is played using pregenerated characters, which allows us to create a conversion to the new system without having to convert the entire game all at once. When this scenario becomes available, we'll be asking everyone to give it a try, and we'll generate a specific survey looking at the new systems to get your feedback.</p> 
               <p>Well, that's about all for this week! Let us know what you think about these changes in the comments down below. And as always, we thank each and every one of you for participating in the playtest!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>After our initial experience in <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">part one of the Playtest</a>, we were eager to employ some of the already released errata and ride headlong into part two. Discovering a <i>countdown clock</i> was on our Pathfinder bucket list for a while now, so we dialed up some lighting to match the southern continent, and prepared to set out on a cross-country trek. In typical OAD fashion, we tapped a live NPC to play our animal companion, and our GM rendered another one of those maps that made us scared to even put our hands on.</p> 
                <h2>The Party</h2> 
                <p>To better craft a party suited to what we were allowed to know about this section of the playtest, we opted away from our standard method of playing iconics; instead, we drew upon inspiration from one of our past campaigns and created an entirely wilderness-oriented party. The party was given the same name as their predecessor, The Lost Arrows, who consisted (then and now) of four companions well accustomed to outdoor adventure. What we didn't know when we initially answered a request in Kelmarane, was that we'd have to navigate a tomb complete with traps and confined spaces. After an anxious mission briefing, we were confident we could at least beat our opponents—the Night Heralds—in a race across Katapesh to the tomb.</p>

                <h2>Highlights From "In Pale Mountain's Shadow"</h2> 
                <p>While traversing the slopes of Pale Mountain, we were ambushed by a classic foe—a manticore—that had everyone eager to see how the beast would perform with its new makeover. When our GM landed six out of his first eight tail spikes (including two critical hits and a nasty new ability that pinned our barbarian in place), it was already time to pull out the stops. That sleep arrow listed above? Yeah, Sean pulled it off.</p> 
                <p>Each character had their moment to shine during part two; when it came to the barbarian, the playtest rules felt right at home alongside our favorite iterations of the class over the years. Gnolls twice attempted to swarm Ithilian with their pack attack ability, but his raging damage numbers quickly turned whack-a-mole into wreck-a-gnoll.</p> 
                <p>Inside the Tomb of Tular Seft, we came across a puzzle which involved a series of elemental equations. To solve it, we felt sure we'd need a party more suited to dungeon crawling. Not so, and after drawing upon a variety of skills to produce several stellar DC 25 checks, we had the doors open and our goal close at hand.</p> 
                <h2>Character Deaths</h2> 
                <p>If we were to rank our TPKs across 147 adventures, PC party vs. NPC party would easily hold the record for the deadliest conflicts out there. Logan Bonner, well played. We owe you one.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180915-AmberDie5.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180915-AmberDie5_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180915-AmberDie4.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180915-AmberDie4_360.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <h2>Current Situation</h2> 
                <p>From the outset of the final encounter, it was clear that The Lost Arrows and the Night Heralds had entered into a fierce skirmish from which only one party would survive.</p> 
                <p>Our ranger went down as fast as his animal companion, followed by the barbarian. Nemus, the druid, tried to buy enough time for Keleth to whisk the <i>countdown clock</i> to safety. Using a combination of elven ancestry, Nimble, and Fleet, the elf performed his best version of the 4x40 and tried to outrun the only enemies capable of pursuit. The Night Herald's scout pursued him out onto the ledge and into Pale Mountain's shadow, stopping to let off shots that only created distance with each miss. Just a few yards from maximum range, our GM knew the only way to deliver a hit would be a natural 20. He reached for the Amber Die itself. It did what it's done for decades, and we could only offer reverence.</p>

We have a bunch of them coming in <a href="/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker">Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</a> next month!</p> 
               <p>First among them is the Cyclops Lich, a major NPC villain in the Kingmaker campaign who first appeared on the cover of <i><a href="/products/btpy8e7e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-33-The-Varnhold-Vanishing">Pathfinder Adventure Path #33: The Varnhold Vanishing</a></i>. A Large rare figure, this massive undead menace is sure to leave a lasting impression in your game.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Next, we have another large undead abomination, the hideous Soul Gorger. This rare figure is a staple of fantasy RPGs, and gains its power from the souls of spellcasters it has devoured, which now reside in its chest cavity, grasping to escape.</p> 
               <p>SOUL GORGER</p>

               </div> 
               <p>At the other end of the power spectrum, we have the Bloody Skeleton, a Medium common figure that will help GMs everywhere bolster their undead hordes.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Not all undead are so corporeal, and ghosts have long been a pillar of both fantasy and horror stories. The Elf Ghost below can serve as either a ghostly elf pirate or any other lingering spirit trapped in its material existence until the PCs can help it to its final rest. An uncommon figure, customers who purchase a case should get a few of them, allowing for the overwhelming challenge of facing more than one of these menacing foes!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>While it's technically a piece of set dressing, this set's Scarecrow makes a great red herring in horror campaigns. It totally won't animate and climb off that post to ravage anyone who gets lost in a corn maze, I promise. Players and GMs familiar with the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path may find other, more ghoulish uses for this piece as well!</p>

               <p>Finally this week, we look at the <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> companion with the strongest undead connection: the undead servant of Urgathoa, Jaethal. The elven inquisitor makes an excellent scythe-wielding elf PC or NPC, and needn't necessarily be undead herself. Jaethal, Elf Inquisitor is a Medium uncommon figure.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">When we announced the Pathfinder Playtest in February, some of the first questions revolved around what Pathfinder Society would look like in the new edition. One of the questions the organized play team asked was what gave the Society its heart - made it the robust organized play system it is - and what could be improved. We've spent the last six months analyzing the past ten years of Society play, from how we organize scenarios to what role the Society has in the greater Pathfinder universe. We also asked our community feedback, posting several threads soliciting commentary on some of the key pieces of the Society.

               <p itemprop="description">When we announced the Pathfinder Playtest in February, some of the first questions revolved around what Pathfinder Society would look like in the new edition. One of the questions the organized play team asked was what gave the Society its heart - made it the robust organized play system it is - and what could be improved. We've spent the last six months analyzing the past ten years of Society play, from how we organize scenarios to what role the Society has in the greater Pathfinder universe. We also asked our community feedback, posting several threads soliciting commentary on some of the key pieces of the Society. While we still have months of playtesting to go and aren't ready to make final decisions about what to include in our new Society, we did want to revisit the forum threads where we posed questions to the community, discuss the emerging trends, and refocus the discussion towards the most likely options.</p> 
               <p>Eight threads are too much for any one person to monitor, especially when they span pages and pages of commentary. To make the task easier, each of the organized play team members focused on two threads. Over the next few months, we will dedicate at least one blog every month on our discussion. This week, we are going to focus on the Tier discussion and how it impacts level gain, which was one of Linda's foci, and the revised Roleplaying Guild Guide, which is an area I've monitoring.</p> 
               <p>At the end of this blog is a link to a SurveyMonkey form with a few questions regarding the discussion topics of tiers, experience points, and the Roleplaying Guild guide. Please read through the blog, then take the survey. Just to note, we are only talking Pathfinder Society version 2 in this survey. Depending on how things work out, what we decide for version 2 may make its way into Starfinder Society, but that is a topic for another day.</p> 
               <p>From Linda-Zayas Palmer, Organized Play Developer:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Tiers</h2> 
                <p>One of the primary topics of this thread is the appropriate size for tiers in scenarios. The community discussion centered around three primary models for the size of typical tiers.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Tiers that are three levels wide with no sub tiers (Level 1, 3, 5, etc. scenarios that are playable by characters within one level of the adventure's stated level - level 5 adventures are playable by level 4-6 characters.)</li> 
                 <li>Tiers that are four levels wide with two sub tiers, as in Starfinder Society (Tier 1-4, 3-6, 5-8, etc.)</li> 
                 <li>Tiers that are five levels wide with two sub tiers, as in the current version of Pathfinder Society (Tier 1-5, 3-7, 5-9, etc.).</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>There were also some interesting points in the thread about the possibilities for non-standard tier sizes to accommodate particularly low or high-level play. We are likely to continue to offer adventures with narrow tier bands for low-level characters (Such as Tier 1 or 1-2 scenarios). When it comes to possibilities for higher level play, that is a bridge we'll be looking to cross in the future, when there are PCs available to play adventures of those levels, and when we've all had a chance to become familiar with how high-level play works in Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> 
                <p>The tier discussion also included a fair amount of discussion about APL (Average Party Level) and how to use it to determine which adjustments to apply to the adventure based upon the strength of the party. This conversation included ideas for how best to calculate APL, and how best to make adjustments that serve both large groups of lower level PCs and small groups of higher-level PCs. Because the specifics of how we handle adjustments will have to depend upon the size of the tiers, we aren't ready to offer complete proposals on this topic yet. However, as you may have noticed if you GMed one of the Pathfinder Society Playtest scenarios, we are strongly considering writing scenarios for a baseline of four players, with step adjustments provided for 5 and 6 (possibly even 7) players, versus the Pathfinder Society model of writing for tables of six players with a four-player adjustment.</p> 
                <p>We are considering several models for XP gain, based on the suggestions we have received. Regardless of the model, longer adventures like Adventure Paths would give more XP than a standard scenario, and quests would give less. Which brings up a discussion on the role of quests. The current default model for quests is to release 1-2 "packs" of quests per year, which each contain 4 or 5 adventures that together tell a cohesive story. We've received a lot of feedback, both on the forums and in person, that this model creates scheduling challenges. What we currently investigating is a model based around self-contained quests that release on a regular schedule, such as 1 quest per month. This would allow for more flexibility in scheduling, as the storyline won't be cohesive across individual quests, as well as maintain a constant flow of short events to be run at conventions, game stores, and other venues throughout the year.</p> 
                <p>With the above quest revisions in mind, which of the models below do you prefer?</p> 
                <p>The level gain portion of the thread also included some suggestions to create an XP system in which characters leveled up more quickly at low levels and more slowly at high levels. While these are interesting ideas and they may work best for some folks, the prevailing preference toward simplicity in the way we handle XP makes us unlikely to follow up on them. Instead, we would recommend that players looking to level up more slowly at higher levels use a voluntary system like slow track.</p> 
                <p>Speaking of slow track, we'd like to hear your thoughts on that as well. In Pathfinder Society, there is a leveling option called slow track, where players can choose to receive less XP, gold, and Fame for playing adventures', causing them to level more slowly.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <h2>The Roleplaying Guild Guide</h2> 
               <p>The discussion on tiers, levels, and experience took a goodly amount of space, so I'm going to keep the guide conversation brief. Many of the comments about the current guide involved its size, organization, and accessibility. To that end, we are looking at stripping the guide back to its bare bones and put it together from the ground up. I've included survey questions about what should be in the guide and how it should be organized.</p> 
               <p>Part of this discussion revolves around delivery options. The big question at this point revolves around the feasibility of supporting a living document that resides online with print options. This would allow for faster updates and more integration between the guide, campaign clarifications, additional resources, and FAQ. Conversely, it means the guide is always in flux and could cause issues if internet access is not robust.</p> 
               <p>With the above thread discussions in mind, please take a moment to visit <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XJW9KTJ">Org Play Survey #1—Tiers, XP, and Guides</a> and log your opinions on the above talking points via a short survey. Conversely, you can add freeform comments below or in the applicable threads (<a href="/threads/rzs2ux62?Tiers-Level-Gain">Tiers &amp; Level Gain</a>, <a href="/threads/rzs2ux65?Structure-of-the-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide">Roleplaying Guild Guide</a>). Regardless of how you share your opinions, please do so, as we want to hear your thoughts on the directions of the future Pathfinder Society!</p> 
               <h2>PAX Unplugged</h2> 
               <p>We have a room for Pathfinder &amp; Starfinder Societies and a booth hosting demonstration of the Pathfinder Playtest going on at PAX Unplugged 2018! Information on volunteer packages and a registration form will be <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/E9cRAfijvK7vOXdZ2"><b>available here</b></a> on <b>Friday, September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2018 at noon PST</b>.</p> 
               <p>If you didn't read the blogs yesterday, flip back for previews of scenarios releasing in September for the Pathfinder and Starfinder Societies, including the last of the Pathfinder Playtest scenarios! If you are caught up, tune in next week for a status update on the Pathfinder Playtest society style or check out some of the other Paizo-centric blogs!</p>

Luckily, we're just about a week out from the release of our two latest scenarios, so now is a perfect time for some sneak previews!</p> 
               <p>First off, Organized Play Lead Developer, John Compton, is going to take some time to tell you about this month's first scenario.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>John:</b> With the Gen Con scenarios done, I've had a little more time to help out with Starfinder Society scenario development. The first of these is <a href="/products/btpzgd7p?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-122-The-Protectorate-Petition"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-22: The Protectorate Petition</i></a>, a Tier 1-4 scenario by Mike Kimmel. The planet Tabrid Minor's sole intelligent species, the communal coral-like organisms called copaxis, are quite new to the galactic stage, having only made any significant forays within the past decade. However, they've quickly determined that allying themselves with the Pact Worlds would be ideal—to the point that the planet-spanning copaxi government has formally petitioned to become a Pact Worlds protectorate. This would not be without costs to the Pact Worlds, and the Stewards have contracted a team of Starfinders to assist in a detailed study of the planet, its people, and its past to assess whether linking their fates is wise. It's up to the PCs to study one of the ruined floating cities above Tabrid Minor in collaboration with a team of copaxi scientists to understand this enduring culture and shape the planet's future.</p>

               <p>Our second September release is a higher tier scenario that follows in the footsteps of recent Society events. <a href="/products/btpzgd7q?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-123-Return-to-Sender"><i>Starfinder Society #1-23: Return to Sender</i></a> involves two of our major faction leaders banding together to strike against a <a href="/products/btpya08y/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion">recently revealed threat</a>. This month's scenario comes from Natalie Kertzner, who you may remember as one of the quest authors from <a href="/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-16-Dreaming-of-the-Future"><i>Starfinder Society #1-16: Dreaming of the Future</i></a> and an active Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild volunteer. Natalie brought a combination of dark (almost unspeakable) encounter ideas along with some of the lighter tones that players have come to appreciate from Starfinder. As for what's in store for the players, suffice it to say it might have something to do with this unimpressed figure in the preview image…</p> 
               <p>September promises to be an exciting month for Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Players. Come back next month, when we preview our next set of scenarios, including our first Tier 3-6 repeatable and a new entry into our growing stable of introductory Tier 1-4 content.</p>

                <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer (Organized Play Developer):</b> What better way to celebrate the approach of Halloween than with some spooky scenarios? This month, we're kicking off a new Tier 3-7 two-part series with <a href="/products/btpzgd7n?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1005-Mysteries-Under-Moonlight-Part-1-Testament-of-Souls"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-05: Mysteries Under Moonlight Part 1: Testament of Souls</i></a>, by Alex Augunas. The city of Magnimar is well known for its monuments and the blessings they provide to those who perform the proper rituals before them. Now, however, several of the monuments have been corrupted by necromantic energy from an unknown source. Out-of-control flames and the eerie moans of lost spirits haunt Magnimar's people. Magnimar's Lord-Mayor Grobaras has hired an investigator—illustrated below by Tadas Sidluahskas—but with the situation worsening rapidly, the Varisian Council has asked the Pathfinder Society to step in and put an end to the corruption. If the PCs succeed here, they'll receive a unique blessing that they can use to be particularly awesome in <a href="/products/btq01va3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-10-07-Mysteries-Under-Moonlight-Part-2-The-Howling-Dance"><i>Mysteries Under Moonlight, Part 2</i></a>!</p>

Will the PCs survive the Reaver of Roslar's Coffer, or will someone beat them to the prize? And who exactly is this individual illustrated by Dion Harris, and what does he have to do with the mysteries hidden within the Bastion?</p> 
                <p><b>John Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer):</b> Normally we'd have just two Pathfinder Society scenarios per month, but with the ongoing <a href="/pathfinderplaytest">Pathfinder Playtest</a>, we wanted to ensure that there would be plenty of playtest material. This month we release the fourth and final Pathfinder Playtest scenario: <a href="/products/btpzgd7o?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-4-The-Frozen-Oath"><i>The Frozen Oath</i></a>, a Tier 10 adventure written by Ron Lundeen. The Pathfinder Society's increasingly reached out to freelance explorers to map areas, survey regions, and perform other long-term studies. Although goblins aren't renowned for their scholarly rigor, an increasing number of them have sought out work with the Society. A group of Frostfur goblins recently set out into the chilly Crown of the World, and only one has returned, carrying a stone tablet that suggests the group found a large monument tied to the legendary explorer Aganhei! With the summer solstice over, the PCs need to move swiftly to reach the site while the warm weather lasts.</p>

                <p>Unlike the previous three Pathfinder Playtest adventures, this scenario DOES NOT include pregenerated characters. As you schedule this scenario, it is important that you either include enough time for your players to build characters or have them create characters ahead of time.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Speaking of pregenerated characters, the team's been continually revising the pregenerated character format with the help of our senior graphic designer Emily Crowell. She's created several different styles that prioritize different features, such as grouping similar information together, presenting an overview of a character's abilities on the front page, using a vertical or landscape format, and more. Our aim's to get the pregenerated character survey done soon, including some of these pregenerated character formats as visuals to get your feedback on the current formats, the changes we've explored, and what else you'd like to see.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, be sure you're continuing to playtest Pathfinder's second edition and provide us your feedback through the surveys.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">No one said traveling to the Azlanti Star Empire would be easy. In fact, most everyone says the exact opposite. Imperialist and xenophobic, the Azlanti aren't going to take kindly to a handful of Pact Worlders showing up in their space to cause trouble and interfere with their grand plans. Luckily, as with any large empire, there are spaces on the fringes where the eyes of the conquerors don't always peer too closely.</p>

               <p>In <a href="/products/btpya205?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-8-Escape-from-the-Prison-Moon"><i>Starfinder Adventure Path #8: Escape from the Prison Moon</i></a>, the PCs begin their sojourn into Azlanti space at a former mining platform and space station known as Outpost Zed, home to a wide array of smugglers and outlaws who want to avoid the gaze of Azlanti officials. The heroes will need to trade for goods and information there if they want any chance of being able to rescue their android friend from her cruel captors. But will they be able to prove themselves worthy of trust by Outpost Zed's inhabitants, whose ways and languages are extremely alien to those from the Pact Worlds?</p> 
               <p>In addition to a rollicking adventure by the always awesome Eleanor Ferron where the PCs will meet several new beings and perform a daring prison break, this volume also includes a ton of information about the Azlanti Star Empire. From its storied history and current state of affairs (by Starfinder Creative Director and Azlanti enthusiast Robert G. McCreary) to a detailed look at the Star Empire's 17 officially designated "sentient alien species" (by the wildly imaginative Saif Ansari), you'll soon find the Azlanti Star Empire as the newest villains you'll love to hate!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">One of the key elements of tabletop roleplaying games like Pathfinder is the collaborative storytelling that comes from a party of different characters all adventuring together. In many cases, the inter-party conflicts and dynamics of a campaign are as memorable as the overall plot like the villain and her motivations. In a single-player digital adaptation of such a game, capturing that same sense of disparate personalities is vital to making the final game feel like Pathfinder. The recently released Pathfinder: Kingmaker, from developers Owlcat Games emulated this cherished aspect of the genre perfectly with their wide array of supporting characters players can combine into the perfect team.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">One of the key elements of tabletop roleplaying games like Pathfinder is the collaborative storytelling that comes from a party of different characters all adventuring together. In many cases, the inter-party conflicts and dynamics of a campaign are as memorable as the overall plot like the villain and her motivations.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker, from developers Owlcat Games emulates this cherished aspect of the genre perfectly with their wide array of supporting characters players can combine into the perfect team.</p> 
               <p>While players have the ability to create their own cast of companions after completing the game's tutorial and prologue, the eleven pre-made companions provide a wide variety of character types, both adhering to and bucking genre tropes to play with. Each has a backstory linking them to the game's overarching plot, an intricate series of side quests focusing on their character development, and interpersonal dynamics both with the player and their fellow companions sure to add hours of additional entertainment as they banter while making camp or interject their thoughts during key encounters.</p> 
               <p>Which companion is your favorite? Who are you most excited to get to know (and possibly romance)? Which ones do you see as comprising your default adventuring party?</p> 
               <p><b>Amiri</b></p> 
               <p>The kellid barbarian Amiri hails from the harsh Realm of the Mammoth Lords, where she was exiled from her nomadic tribe for daring to challenge traditional gender roles. Unwelcome in her homeland and resentful of anyone who doubts her battle prowess, Amiri is more eager to prove her worth to her new "chieftain"—you!</p> 
               <p><b>Ekundayo</b></p> 
               <p>Born in Absalom, the teeming City at the Center of the World, to a Garundi family, the reserved ranger Ekundayo sought only a peaceful family life in the River Kingdoms when raiding trolls forced him on a different path. A devoted follower of Torag, Ekun now seeks revenge for his slain loved ones and a new start, be that with decent companions he meets along the way or on his own.</p> 
               <p><b>Harrim</b></p> 
               <p>The dwarf cleric Harrim is the embodiment of the nihilistic faith of Groetus, god of the end times, which he doesn't so much as proselytize as ooze from every pore in his dour body. Ever ready to remind his companions of the futility of, well, just about everything, he may just as well adventure with them than do anything else. Everyone's going to end up dead at the end of time, anyway, so why not die in the service to the Stolen Lands' new ruler?</p>

                <p><i>Amiri, Ekundayo, and Harrim </i></p>
               </div> 
               <p><b>Jaethal</b></p> 
               <p>Elves are known throughout Golarion for their otherworldly grace and alien demeanor, but the inquisitor Jaethal takes this aloofness even further—by being a unique undead in service to Urgathoa, goddess of gluttony and undeath. On the run from her past in Kyonin—the type of murder and betrayal you'd expect from someone angling for the favor of such a fell god—Jaethal serves at her own whim, perhaps wanting nothing more of her companions than potential corpses for a future undead army of her very own.</p> 
               <p><b>Jubilost</b></p> 
               <p>Few authors in the world have as lengthy and prestigious bibliography as the esteemed gnome alchemist, Jubilost Narthropple. Hailing from the centers of learning in metropolitan Absalom, Jubilost doesn't suffer fools lightly, and he believes everyone to be a fool. Though his arrogance makes him few friends, his interest in the mysteries of the gnomes' origins in the First World and his expert knowledge on just about everything (at least in his own mind) make him a valuable resource in uncovering some of the region's most enigmatic mysteries.</p> 
               <p><b>Linzi</b></p> 
               <p>Your first and most loyal companion, Linzi was kicked out of the Academy of Grand Arts in the neighboring River Kingdom of Pitax after she wrote less-than-flattering things about the city's King Irovetti. The optimistic halfling bard has selected you to be the subject of her magnum opus, a book telling a tale of high adventure written by those involved, at the time of their exploits instead of decades later based on second-hand reports.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Jaethal.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Jaethal_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Jubilost.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Jubilost_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Linzi.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Linzi_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Jaethal, Jubilost, and Linzi </i></p>
               </div> 
               <p><b>Nok-Nok</b></p> 
               <p>Most civilized creatures see goblins as little more than monsters, and sometimes, even goblins see their kin in much the same light. Nok-Nok, a rogue with ambitions of being "the fith gawd" (an addition to the four-member pantheon of goblin hero gods), is one such case. Bullied and tortured by his tribe, he's more than happy to work with longshanks who don't abuse him, and will gladly prove his loyalty and worthiness to you, as long as you give him plenty of things to stab along the way.</p> 
               <p><b>Octavia</b></p> 
               <p>A former slave of the Technic League mages of neighboring Numeria, the half-elf arcane trickster Octavia is a ray of sunshine despite the gloomy conditions of her life prior to meeting the game's hero. Octavia has an optimism that rivals Linzi's and a sense of compassion that's hard to ignore should you act the tyrant in her company.</p> 
               <p><b>Regongar</b></p> 
               <p>Octavia's closest and oldest friend, the half-orc magus Regongar, is decidedly less optimistic and compassionate than his partner. Cruel, hedonistic, and vengeful, Regongar would rather kill his enemies quickly and without fuss (especially his former captors among the Technic League) than delay the drinking and love-making to follow, a stark contrast to Octavia's more forgiving approach.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p><i>Nok-Nok, Octavia, and Regongar </i></p>
               </div> 
               <p><b>Tristian</b></p> 
               <p>Soft-spoken and aloof, the human cleric Tristian hails from the Padishah Empire of Kelesh far to the east, where he was raised in the church of the sun goddess Sarenrae. With a grace becoming his celestial patron, the wandering priest spreads the word of the Dawnflower—as well as her tenets of healing, light, and redemption—into the heart of the Stolen Lands, and if he had his way, into the hearts of his companions as well.</p> 
               <p><b>Valerie</b></p> 
               <p>Bestowed by divine beauty and charm, the noble-born human, Valerie, was raised in a convent dedicated to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, set on the track of a paladin of the Eternal Rose. She wasn't interested in any of that, however. Tired of countless suitors inundating her with mediocre art the tenets of her faith prohibited her from ripping up and throwing in their faces, Valerie instead took up the life of a trained fighter, mastering the defensive and offensive applications of the tower shield. Now in the baron or baroness's employ, Valerie is staunchly loyal and invaluable on the battlefield.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Tristian.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Tristian_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Valerie.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180917-Valerie_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Tristian and Valerie </i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>Of the 11 companions in the game, four are romanceable—Valerie for male PCs, Tristian for female PCs, and both Octavia and Regongar for both male and female PCs. Whether you pursue a romantic relationship with any of them is your choice, but regardless of your decision, each of your companions provides endless possibilities for bringing the collaborative, party-based excitement of the Pathfinder RPG to life!</p> 
               <p><i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> is available for preorder on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/pathfinder_kingmaker_explorer_edition">GOG</a>.</p>

               <p>So, today we're launching the first of our Game Feedback Surveys, starting with the Ancestry and Backgrounds Survey and the truly massive Class Survey. But before you go rushing off to take these surveys, there are a few things you should know.</p> 
               <p>First off, you should note that you can take each of these surveys only once, though you can choose to leave a survey and come back to complete it later (until we close the surveys at the end of the playtest). This might be useful for the Class Survey in particular, which is quite lengthy and could be difficult to finish in one sitting, and which is also divided into sections for each class.</p> 
               <p>Second, you don't have to answer every question in these surveys. The Class Survey asks you if you want to give feedback on a class before displaying those questions, allowing you to skip classes entirely if you find that you don't have any feedback on their theme or mechanics. You can also skip questions that you find aren't relevant to your experience (although we've tried to provide response options for you to clarify this as well).</p> 
               <p>Finally, while you don't have to answer every question, it's still important that you go all the way to the end of the survey, as there are several important questions that come later on.</p> 
               <p>So, if you think you're ready, go on over and take these surveys using the following links! We're looking forward to hearing what you think!</p> 
               <p style="text-align:center;margin:2rem;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPAncestry" target="_blank">Ancestry &amp; Backgrounds Survey</a> | <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPClasses" target="_blank">Classes Survey</a></p> 
               <p>If you have more open ended comments or feedback, you can take these surveys to give us more detailed commentary on the rules.</p> 
               <p style="text-align:center;margin:2rem;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPOpAncestry" target="_blank">Open Response Ancestry and Background Survey</a> | <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPOpClasses" target="_blank">Open Response Class Survey</a></p> 
               <p>Tune back in here in the coming weeks as we add even more surveys to the mix, which will ask about your view on various game mechanics and monster design!</p> 
               <h2>A Note on Playtests</h2> 
               <p>Just to recap some of what we talked about on the Paizo Twitch stream on Friday, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the playtest as a process. Some of you have begun to notice that the <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> adventure feels a bit different that the adventures you're used to seeing. This is intentional—each part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> is specifically designed to stress test one or more facets of the game. This means you might see encounters with the same theme repeated multiple times at various challenge levels, or that every encounter in one part of the adventure might share a common element. It might also mean that some of the fights are beyond challenging.</p> 
               <p>Making the best version of Pathfinder that we can means finding where the current system breaks. In some cases, we need you to do that, so that we can figure out where the line actually is. But it's equally important to the data collection process that playtesters not know what those goals actually are until the test is over, since to do so any other way would bias the results.</p> 
               <p>The design team offers our sincerest thanks to everyone for helping us with this rigorous process. We promise to pay for resurrections and therapy for your poor PCs when this is all over.</p> 
               <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p> 
               <p><i>Join the Pathfinder Playtest designers every Friday throughout the playtest on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Twitch Channel</a> to hear all about the process and chat directly with the team.</i></p>

               <p><i>Heroes From the Fringe</i> features a section on each of our non-human races, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and halflings, plus a few others. Each section shines a spotlight on a few different cultures and groups, such as the Pahmet dwarves in Osirion, the Jinniese elves of Tian Xia, gnomes that have undergone the Bleaching, and the Song'o halflings from deep in the Mwangi Expanse. Every entry also has a new set of alternate racial traits that helps you better tie your characters to these groups and regions.</p> 
               <p>This book also presents a number of interesting player options that are tied to each of these new groups. Dwarves have all new dwarven weapons and fighting styles. Ekujae elf calamity callers are able to call blizzards and lightning against their enemies. Gnomes bring new magic with them from the First World. Half-elves and half-orcs have new abilities depending on from where the hail. Aquatic half-elves can use ocean water to create potions, while Darklands half-orcs can draw upon psychic power to fill their enemies' minds with nightmares. Segadan halflings have new unique tricks allowing them to disarm foes or heal allies with the help of slings.</p> 
               <p>This book is perfect for any player that's tired of playing the typical dwarf or elf or is looking to learn more about the different races in Golarion. If this all sounds exciting to you, make sure to pick up <i>Heroes From the Fringe</i>!</p>

               <p>I brought the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game to <a href="http://www.puzzlers.org">a puzzle convention</a> that Mike, Chad, Tanis, and Gaby were attending. I timidly showed them one of the upgrades I've made for the game, and they said I ought to write something for the homebrew blog. The thing is, they didn't see just how crazy obsessive I've become about improving my game experience.</p> 
               <p>First, the thing I showed off was pretty simple. I got some craft store wooden cubes, colored them with markers (Name a brand of markers. Yes, that one.) and labelled them with card types. We use these cubes during play to track what's left in each location. Since the number of each card type in a location is usually no secret, we place the appropriate number of cubes by each location deck. We separate banes and boons so we can see at a glance how bad a location is. Every time we remove a card from the deck, the corresponding cube goes with it.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A1.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A1_360.jpeg"></a><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A1a.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A1a_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>This all seems perfectly sane. So far.</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>Some compromises had to be made on color. The brand of markers doesn't have a whole lot of choices for grey, so armors are darkened to black, and items are green. There are light blues, but if you use them on wood, they come out green again, so blessings become beige. I have a lot of cubes, but if we ever run out of one type, then the purple Extra cubes come into play, and if there are particular cards to track, they're made silver Special cubes.</p> 
               <p>Until we know which location has the villain, all those unknown bad guys round to henchman red. If the villain escapes, incoming cards are accompanied by those dark red/beige checkered cubes until we know whether they're a blessing or the villain.</p> 
               <p>This is all pretty normal—after all, the electronic Pathfinder Adventures game does the same thing. The idea of using cubes to track things, though, seemed like a good one, and could be used to solve another problem. On a check that has a number of blessings and powers and effects modifying the result, it can be hard to remember them all. The answer? Moar cubes!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A2.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A2_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>The good, the bad, and the pretty numbers.</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>Blue buff cubes add to the result, and red debuff cubes are evidence of the check getting harder. The "- hexagon" red cube subtracts one from the check for every die used.</p> 
               <p>These work great, but having a little pile of cubes next to a location can be difficult to work with, especially if you move the locations around to be closer to the player whose character is exploring them. Guess I better make LEGO trays to hold everything!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3_360.jpeg"></a><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3a.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3a_360.jpeg"></a><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3b.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3b_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>What else are you going to do with your cubes?</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>There's a rack on the back to hold the location card, token cards for any characters at that location, and if the check to close involves facing a henchman, we can keep it there as well. The cubes happen to be the same size as a 2x2 brick, so creating slots for them was easy, and there's a brick keeping the location deck tipped up to assist in drawing a card.</p> 
               <p>From there I started looking at solutions for keeping my character's hand and dice contained, since there's only so much table space to go around. That's why I made a rack for my cards, and a dice holder.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A4.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A4_360.jpeg"></a><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A5.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A5_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>Sliding farther down from 'healthy interest' to 'back away slowly'.</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>The rack is a baseplate sandwich, with my character deck on the lower right, discards on the upper right, buried cards on the left, and a bonus space on the lower left in case my cards ever need to do some weird thing Lone Shark thinks of. Displayed cards can stand up at the back. In that first photo you can see the character card I made so you can check things off. And the dice holder… holds dice. (By type!)</p> 
               <p>The one thing that I've made that I'm the most proud of is this rack for organizing cards that we've dealt with during play so I can quickly reset the box after the session.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A6.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A6_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>Note the red and gold design on the front.</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>The same color changes that affected the cubes go into the rack. Location cards go into the brown slot in the back for end-of-scenario clean-up, and the white slot is for any Basics or Elites that are about to leave the game.</p> 
               <p>Finally, the one thing I have to support the game that I treasure the most isn't for playing but for storage, and it was created by my husband.</p>

               <p>Each type of die gets its own pocket, and so do the buff and debuff cubes. The flap at the top folds down over the openings to the pockets, and the tie holds everything inside. It puts the finishing touch on packing all this gear together into a couple of neat containers so it can all be carried or put away with a minimum of fuss.</p> 
               <p>I'm still looking for ways to improve or add to what I have. I hope some of this inspires you to trick out your game.</p>

Well, I finally get to share the answer with you all!</p> 
               <p>Paizo is pleased to announce that Blake Davis and the Archives of Nethys will be maintaining the Pathfinder and Starfinder Reference Documents!</p> 
               <p>As an official licensed partner, the Archives of Nethys includes setting-specific rules content as well as Open Game Content, so you'll be able to find the Golarion- and Pact Worlds–specific rules you're looking for quickly and easily.</p> 
               <p>Eventually, these reference documents will become more integrated into the paizo.com website, but for the near future, we will be redirecting PRD and SFRD requests to the <a href="http://aonprd.com" target="_blank">Archives of Nethys website</a>:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Pathfinder Reference Document: <a href="http://pfrd.info" target="_blank">pfrd.info</a><br> Starfinder Reference Document: <a href="http://sfrd.info" target="_blank">sfrd.info</a></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>During this transition, you will not be able to search the PRD or the SFRD using the paizo.com search tool—you'll need to use the <a href="http://aonprd.com/Search.aspx" target="_blank">Archives of Nethys search tool</a> instead for Pathfinder content; the search engine for the Starfinder site is still in development and is expected to go live in the next 1-2 weeks.</p> 
               <p>(The AON will not be hosting a Pathfinder Playtest reference document, as those rules are transitory, but we are planning to launch the reference document for Pathfinder Second Edition with them next year.)</p> 
               <p>Both reference documents on the Archives of Nethys will remain a completely free resource, but you can help support their future growth on <a href="http://www.patreon.com/nethys" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p> 
               <p>I'm so excited to see our new partnership with Archives of Nethys and our online offerings to the Pathfinder and Starfinder communities evolve! Be sure to check out the AON, update your bookmarks, and keep up with the Paizo blog for future announcements.</p> 
               <p>Chris Lambertz<br> <i>Web Product Manager</i></p> 
               <p>9/14/2018 Update: After reviewing community feedback, the legacy PRD website has now been made available at <a href="http://legacy.aonprd.com" target="_blank">legacy.aonprd.com</a>. It does not contain the search functionality, however.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">This month, Pathfinder fans can get their hands on the adventure that kicks off the <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords">Return of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>—<a href="/products/btpya1r8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-133-Secrets-of-Roderics-Cove"><i>Secrets of Roderic's Cove</i></a>! I asked on Twitter what folks would like to see in a blog about this adventure, and a number of people wanted to know more about the writing process and more behind the scenes things. So, here y'all go!</p> 
               <p>After working on various parts of the Adventure Path line for over 6 years, I finally got my name on the front cover! I'd been given the option before, but it seemed like every time the opportunity came up the timing just wasn't right. I didn't want to take on a big project and not be able to deliver on time. I still had plenty on my plate, but kicking off an Adventure Path was too tempting to refuse. I also enjoy writing low-level adventures, so that was another factor that led me to jump on this.</p> 
               <p>James had some basic ideas of what he wanted this adventure to accomplish, and rather than us using the usual outlining process, we pretty much just talked things through, and I kept him updated on where the story was going, getting feedback and bouncing ideas off of him.</p> 
               <p>Writing Adventure Path adventures is tough. While I've written plenty of things since I first started freelancing, this adventure is the longest single project I've ever written. I stressed trying to pull it all together and hit my deadline (which I didn't), and at the end of it all I had overwritten by more than 7,000 words. Trimming it down was easier than I expected, though. I had another level in a dungeon that was a little more than 5,000 words by itself and it wasn't 100% necessary to the plot, so... yoink! To the floor with you! The rest was just cleaning up some things, connecting the dots, and trimming down a few encounters.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>I enjoyed getting to flesh out the town of Roderic's Cove, as well. There were only a few sentences on the place, so I got to really breathe some life into it. I like making small towns and their inhabitants, and really enjoy linking everyone together to make a place seem realistic and dynamic all while giving PCs fun characters to interact with.</p> 
               <p>This adventure is somewhat of a sandbox, and it provides a wide range of encounters and places to explore. Not every challenge is best dealt with through violence, so the PCs can find different solutions to their problems. While the adventure kicks off the bigger plot of the campaign, it is also self-contained and could easily serve as a standalone adventure with minimal work on the GM's part.</p> 
               <p>I hope that everyone who reads or plays <i>Secrets of Roderic's Cove</i> enjoys themselves. Get ready to take down those runelords!</p>

               <p>One of the greatest challenges of adapting an adventure path like Kingmaker—which came out way back in the spring of 2009—into a new medium is balancing faithfulness to the source material with the creation of enough new content to entertain players and GMs who played or ran the campaign in the last decade. Kingmaker, by far the Pathfinder Adventure Path with the most open, sandboxy feel, left the writers at Owlcat (with industry veteran Chris Avellone, of <i>Planescape: Torment</i> and <i>Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</i> fame) with plenty of room to add their own content while still including all the now-iconic encounters and story elements that made the pen-and-paper campaign such a classic.</p> 
               <p>An all-new introduction to the campaign, set in the manor house of Swordlord Jamandi Aldori, serves not only as a tutorial for new players, but also gives context to the player's mission (something the original campaign left to the GM) and introduces some of the myriad characters who will play large roles in the ongoing campaign, gaining both her most loyal companion and a hated rival.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Throughout the game, in addition to countless new side-missions and subplots introduced as connective tissue between the story elements presented in the pen-and-paper version of the campaign, the player can engage in deeply immersive companion-based plots involving each of over ten companions. Some of these, such as Amiri's companion quests, incorporate elements of the existing campaign, like the nomadic Kellid barbarians who show up in chapter four, while others are entirely new content involving such epic villains as Numeria's Technic League! Other side quests expand on simple plot hooks provided on the inside covers of the original printed books meant for GM inspiration. Still others are wholly new plotlines created to flesh out large map areas or tie together disparate elements of the campaign in new and inventive ways.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>As if that weren't enough, <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> includes a seventh chapter above and beyond the six printed in the pages of <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> back in 2009. This expedition into the mysteries of the First World and some of the machinations of the Eldest is perhaps the game's most inspired and imaginative content!</p> 
               <p><i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> releases on September 25, and is available for preorder now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/pathfinder_kingmaker_explorer_edition">GOG</a>.</p>

               <p style="text-align:center;margin:2rem;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP3PC" target="_blank">Player Survey</a> | <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP3GM" target="_blank">Game Master Survey</a> | <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP3OP" target="_blank">Open Survey</a></p> 
               <p>Before we move on, we'd like to look back at what we've learned from the first two parts of the adventure and talk about some additional changes we're making to the game based on your comments and feedback.</p> 
               <p>But first, a few important notes.</p> 
               <p>First off, you can still turn in survey results for Parts 1 and 2 of the adventure. Although we're moving on, your responses will still be counted and help us make further decisions about the game.</p> 
               <p>Second, I want to take a moment to stress that the various parts of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> are meant to be tests that look at various parts of the game engine. This goal was more important to us, in some places, than creating a balanced play experience. This will make certain parts of the adventure a little challenging to run at times, but we hope you'll bear with us. We've tried to ensure you'll have a good time with the adventure, but the test goals have to come first. Thanks for understanding.</p> 
               <p>Finally, the rest of this blog may contain spoilers for Parts 1 and 2, so if you have not finished those chapters, you might want to go back and do that first.</p> 
               <h2>Deconstructing Part 2: In Pale Mountain's Shadow</h2> 
               <p>In case you missed the Twitch stream on Friday, Designer Logan Bonner sat down with Dan Tharp to talk through some of the things we've learned so far from the survey results from Part 2 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Here are a few of the highlights, along with a thing or two we might have missed.</p> 
               <p>As the first part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> to be set above level 1, Part 2 was our first chance to ask about archetypes. 15% of you took an archetype, and of those, most were arcane spellcasters picking up the fighter archetype.</p> 
               <p>This is also the first part of the adventure where characters start play with magic items. 62% of you chose <i>magic armor</i> as your 3rd-level item, but over 10% took a lower-level item or a consumable item instead. We might look into making changes in how you can select items in the future to accommodate players who want more flexibility.</p> 
               <p>It took players, on average, almost 10 minutes less to make their 4th-level characters that it did to make their 1st-level characters, which is great news.</p> 
               <p>Resonance continues to be a topic of discussion amongst players, and our surveys are just starting to give us a picture of how it is working in play. Only about 1 out of every 4 players ran out of resonance once during Part 2, and only 1 out of every 10 players failed their check when overspending resonance and became cut off during Part 2 (usually alchemists). Now, the important thing to note here is that this is not really showing us how resonance is being used, merely that players aren't running out very often, so be on the lookout for survey questions in upcoming parts that will delve a little deeper into exactly how you're using resonance at your table.</p> 
               <p>Finally, this part of the adventure was designed to test the game in situations with complex environmental and tactical challenges. Our results showed that players viewed these fights as a significantly greater challenge than the raw monster numbers—not counting the environmental advantages—would indicate. Players also rated the fights in this part as significantly longer and not quite as fun. Some of this was expected, but when we look at these results by class, things become really interesting, showing us which classes had the most difficulty with Part 2. Barbarians, monks, and paladins, for example, seemed to have a bit of trouble with the manticore fight, since they tend to lack ranged options. This shows us that there are adjustments to be made with these classes to ensure they have some way to contribute.</p> 
               <h2>New Updates</h2> 
               <p>With the start of a new part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, we also have a number of changes to the game that we want to bring to your attention. All of these can be found in the download below (which includes all of the previous changes in one handy document). Here are a few of the highlights:</p> 
               <p>First up, we're changing the anathema for the animal totem barbarian to allow you to use whatever weapon you want while outside of rage. When transformed with fury, though, you still need to use those special animal unarmed attacks. Look for a few more barbarian updates as well.</p> 
               <p>Next, we're adding a longer range to <i>soothe</i>, the occult healing spell, allowing you to use it on targets up to 30 feet away. There's a bard update, as well; they now have a feat to gain access to 10th-level occult spells.</p> 
               <p>Finally—and this is the big change for the week—we're removing the concept of signature skills from the game. Now anyone can advance any skill up to any proficiency rank they want (assuming their level is high enough for them to do so). In addition, a number of classes are having their total number of starting skill choices increased to at least three, with each also getting one or more automatic skills, to represent basic class training.</p>

               <p>This change also precipitates the need for a NEW CHARACTER SHEET! On top of removing signature skills from the game, we are also taking this opportunity to clean up a number of issues with the character sheet to make it a bit more intuitive and easy to use.</p>

               <p>As always, none of these changes are final, but instead more steps toward the best version of Pathfinder we can make. Thank you for all of your feedback and assistance so far. We're looking forward to learning more from you in the coming months.</p>

               <p>We are no stranger to playtests. Each time we launch a playtest, we get a pile of feedback, both positive and negative. Both are important. Of course, we all love hearing what you like, and in a perfect world we would bask in the glory of your adoration... but we only create worlds of fantasy, we don't live in one. We playtest to hear what you think about the rules and to get your take on what is sound, exciting, and fun. Sometimes you might not care for our initial design. Sometimes you'll spot problems with the initial design. We want you to tell us. No, we need you to tell us. We're making this game not for ourselves, but for all of us to play!</p> 
               <p>Case in point—let's talk about Resonance Points.</p>

               <p>Let's talk about exactly what design challenges Resonance Points were designed to solve, as that seems to be a point of some confusion.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">First, they're meant to address the economy of lower-level consumable magic items as you level up. This is colloquially referred to as the wand of cure light wounds issue in Pathfinder First Edition, but it's more systemic than that. In short, as you go up in level and your ability to purchase and craft (or find) lower-level consumable magic items increases, they actually become the most economical use of resources. When you are limited only by what you have on hand, the amount of bang per buck makes higher-level magic items nearly pointless.</p> 
               <p>This problem and the Pathfinder First Edition method of item pricing also played havoc with lower-level items with limited uses per day. Designers, by nature, want you to use the items they created in actual play. But adventure designers are often under budgetary constraints to make not the best item for the story, but the one that does the trick while still conforming to the amount of treasure output in the design guides. These factors often created a race to the bottom, design-wise, spawning tons of these little X-per-day buggers that characters could afford, featuring relatively powerful (and always useful) effects that often became more useful as you gained levels. All of this creates a sort of mini-nova during climactic encounters, as characters spend a handful of swift and immediate actions ramping up to their optimal tactics. This is especially true for classes in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, since they typically have fewer class-based options competing for the use of swift and immediate actions.</p> 
               <p>Another problem Resonance Points are trying to address is what is often called the "Christmas Tree" effect of games that impose limits based solely on magic item slots. This goes hand in hand with the cheap consumable (or X-uses-per-day items), as many players rush to fill their slots with items featuring charges or uses per day. While slots still exist in the Pathfinder Playtest, they are the exception rather than the rule, and their primary goal is simply reducing redundancies (like wearing two pairs of boots at the same time and similar nonsense).</p> 
               <p>Lastly, the Resonance Point system is intended to eliminate or at least severely limit the bookkeeping involved in those X-uses-per-day and X-rounds-per-day items. Instead of tracking a bunch of little point pools, Resonance Points can do the job in most, if not all, cases, with the rest limited to once per day. Admittedly, this aspect was not as thoroughly implemented as it could have been in the playtest rules.</p> 
               <p>Those are the main issues that the Resonance Point system is trying to confront. Are there problems with the current implementation? You bet. The most glaring one is that it's currently not doing a good job of reducing the number of magic item use-per-day pools at higher levels. We're going to need to pound the system into shape a little more to achieve that goal.</p> 
               <p>A big issue is that a lot of folks just plain don't like Resonance Points. There are many reasons for that. It's new and different from what people are used to. Other folks don't see the challenges this system is trying to tackle, or they don't see them as problematic. More telling is that even many who do understand the issues have some misgivings, feel that this solution is too artificial, or see it as just plain punitive. We anticipated that. But even with all of the issues, we knew that the current design of Resonance Points would give us valuable information about play patterns and consumable use throughout the playtest, and it has done that in spades already and continues to do so.</p> 
               <p>Better still, it has given us valuable information on how to solve the issues that the Resonance Point system confronts in a better and more pleasing way for the final game. In short, your use of the current incarnation of Resonance Points throughout the playtest helps us come up with better mechanics to use in Pathfinder Second Edition. You've done a great job in providing us that information already, and as we move into higher-level play, that useful data will become more abundant.</p> 
               <p>So, in the case of Resonance Points, positivity of play and critical comments have guided us in the right direction. We already have a few options on how to either fix or replace the mechanic, and we are going to keep on kicking ideas around as the playtest data keeps flowing in. So keep on filling out those surveys and sharing your opinions. Getting your thoughts on the game and how it plays, no matter how you express them, is what the Pathfinder Playtest is all about.</p>

               <p>As the name might suggest, Tyrant's Grasp involves the return of the Whispering Tyrant, the lich wizard-king of old whose prison was guarded by the paladins of neighboring Lastwall. Nothing in the title of this minis set should be misconstrued as a spoiler, though. Everything's going to be fine for Lastwall. Nothing to worry about for them!</p> 
               <p>With a heavy slant toward undead and Lastwall crusaders, the Ruins of Lastwall set features 44 randomized figures, six pieces of bonus dungeon dressing, and the associated Cemetery of the Fallen premium set, available for purchase along with the pre-order of a full case of standard boosters. Check out the initial wave of previews released as part of the solicitation!</p>

               <p>With the pending release of the forthcoming Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker set, due out in October, I'd be remiss to show off only the figures from the set following it 6 months later. So without further ado, here are a few of the most iconic high fantasy figures from Kingmaker.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180907-Manticore.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180907-Manticore_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This manticore, a Large uncommon figure, takes its design from concept art for the Pathfinder: Kingmaker CRPG from Owlcat Games, which gave it a less lion-like face and really shows off the fact that it's a strange amalgamation of other beasts.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180907-SwampNaga.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180907-SwampNaga_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next we have the swamp naga, another Large uncommon figure. Nagas are always tough to scale correctly in plastic form, as they're large creatures but have the human-sized features. Hopefully this snake-bodied sorcerer adequately fills her base, but that's a balancing act we're working hard with WizKids to get right. When the final figure is in your hands, please let us know if we're getting closer to the ideal figure size.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Not to be left behind by his fellow Large uncommons, the Hill Giant makes his preview debut today.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180907-Octavia.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180907-Octavia_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Finally, we have this week's companion figure. Octavia, Half-Elf Arcane Trickster is a Medium rare figure, and makes an excellent stand-in for any half-elven spellcaster PC or NPC.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">In <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkub">the first installment of this blog series</a>, I laid out the principles guiding our new incarnation of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. We aren't rebooting the game—everything will still work with everything else—but with the new <em>Core Set</em>, we're making significant improvements that we've been wanting to make for years. I will go through them one by one in the leadup to the game's intended launch at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon 2019</a>.</p> 
               <p>The improvement I'm describing today is <em>adding more story</em>. To get what I mean by that, you have to understand what we're surrounded by. When you walk into the Paizo conference room, you are surrounded by many bookshelves of everything Paizo has created. There are hundreds of adventures, novels, rulebooks, setting books, and card decks set in the world of Golarion and beyond.</p> 
               <p>For each PACG set, we would choose an RPG Adventure Path to adapt—each consisting of six 96-page volumes, not counting any supplemental books—and wedge that story onto 1 Adventure Path card, 7 adventure cards, and about 35 scenario cards, each of which would have at most 70 words on it. That meant we had to condense 576 pages of roleplaying game text into about 3,000 words spread across 43 poker-sized cards.</p> 
               <p>To say we fell short of the full grandeur of the Pathfinder world would be underselling it. You had to interpret so much from the cards that our community members wrote their own story guides to help explain the stories we were telling to others.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, over on aisle <a href="/pathfinderSociety/acg">Adventure Card Guild</a>, we were doing something very different indeed. Our story authors were cranking out brand new epics. We would plot out major adventure arcs and then we would <i>write</i>. Each page—one scenario, say—would have an entire story, with a setup, gameplay, and development, and the text for one page would often have more story text than an entire adventure worth of cards in the main box. This is much harder work, but it helped make our Adventure Card Guild games even more fun than our base set games.</p> 
               <p>For example, here's a scenario from <a href="/products/btpy9h4s?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-14-The-Mighty-and-the-Righteous"><em>Season of the Righteous Adventure 4</em></a>: The Mighty and the Righteous. The characters are in the Abyss, having just barely escaped the dark clutches of the demon-angel Shamira.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0104E-B.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0104E-B_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>We probably had a reason to name these scenarios after lyrics from <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>'s "The Time Warp," but it's lost to the ages.</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>You can see how much fun I had writing this. Thinking back on it, there was no reason we couldn't have that much fun writing the box sets as well. Organized play had the right idea.</p> 
               <p>So, we stole it.</p> 
               <p>For the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>, I'm diving much deeper into the stories of the adventures we're adapting. <em>Core</em> had us searching for the perfect story to tell an introductory adventure: if this was your first encounter with PACG, we wanted it to be a memorable one.</p>

This is NOT Wrath of the Righteous. You don't exactly become mythic demigods in this one. Instead, you get stuck in a Podunk town and have to figure out whether the townsfolk are being harassed by a long-dead dragon. If you win, you save the town. If you lose, well, that's just how Golarion goes sometimes. It's a great adventure where everybody in it takes themselves very seriously and yet you just have the sense that no one really thought their plans through too well.</p> 
               <p>The first step on this road was to set fire to the Adventure Path, adventure, and scenario cards. You heard me, they're gone. Poof. Instead, I'd write a storybook (a term I stole from <a href="/products/btpy9sct"><em>Apocrypha</em></a>) which had all the adventure content and a lot more story.</p> 
               <p>I cracked open a Word document and started figuring out what I needed to do to tell that story. One consideration was this: We wanted to make our Adventure Path boxes like <em>Curse</em> physically a lot smaller than before. I once walked into my favorite restaurant/board game store, <a href="https://www.moxboardinghouse.com" target="_blank">Mox Boarding House</a>, and saw an employee sorting Netrunner cards under a hanging rack of all my Pathfinder box sets. I gently asked him "Do those ever fall on you?" and he said "Oh, all the time," and I thought "Man, I am not going to jail for THAT."</p> 
               <p>So we wanted to cut it down a bit. The <em>Core Set</em> will come in a 9"×12" box—that's just a little larger than the <a href="/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box"><em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</em></a>—that holds your cards, dice, pawns (more on that later), and rulebooks. And <em>Curse</em> will be even smaller than that: 7.5"×9"—just a bit bigger than the <a href="/products/btpy9kfe"><em>Pathfinder RPG Pocket Edition</em></a>. And <b>all</b> of <em>Curse</em> will be in that box—no more individual adventure boxes, and no more five-month delays between the first part and the last. You'll buy it all at once and you can blast through it as fast as you like. You want it, you got it.</p> 
               <p>To play with it, you'll shuffle the cards from your <em>Curse</em> set into your <em>Core Set</em>. This is a trick we pulled on <em>Apocrypha</em>, and it really works. Since you can easily tell the cards from the sets apart, you can quickly pull out the ones you don't need and shuffle in the ones you do need. It takes only a few minutes to change the whole play experience.</p> 
               <p>But Vic noted that the 7.5"×9" Adventure Path box meant we couldn't just use the Adventure Card Guild's 8.5"×11" page format, at least not without some TARDIS-like technology making it bigger on the inside. I proposed we turn the page sideways and fold it in half, making each scenario a two-page spread in a 5.5"×8.5" storybook. That gave me a fair amount of room to play with. But I had a lot to wedge in there. After some brainstorming with art director Sarah Robinson and graphic designer Sonja Morris, we found a layout I could work with. Here's what it looks like right now. (It will have additional attention from the art team before it's done.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180906-Sample.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180906-Sample_500.jpeg"></a> 
                <br><i>Here's a scenario spread from <i>The Dragon's Demand</i>.</i>
                <p></p>
               </div> 
               <p>Okay, try not to go down the rabbit-hole on all those new terms like "hourglass," "small location," "heal," "story bane," "closing henchmen," "Proxy A," and "danger." I'll get to those soon, I promise. For now, let's just talk big picture.</p> 
               <p>This scenario shows how we put real story into a two-page spread. We get an evocative introduction that draws you into the scenario. Then there's a section on setup and another one on what you do during play, plus a location list. We have a nice space for art, then the conclusion to the story and its rewards. It's a nice-looking layout, even before Sarah and Sonja get to prettying it up.</p> 
               <p>That's a lot better than anything that would fit on a card, I think. Let us know what you think of this!</p>

               <p>Per our post-con tradition, the team wrote paragraphs about the highlights of their Gen Con attendance. Some pesky goblins got in the wiring and disrupted our postings for a few weeks, which led to us not sharing our experiences. Even though we are a month past Gen Con, we wanted to take a moment and share what we thought of Gen Con 2018!

               <p>To keep the blog a manageable length, I considered editing down the posts. But choosing what to take out proved impossible (hats off to our developers and editors, as I don't know how they decide what stays in a manuscript. It's harder than it looks!) Instead, I tucked them behind spoiler tags. Here, for your reading pleasure:</p>

                 <p>Gen Con is always a whirlwind. I feel like I'm running constantly, trying to catch a few minutes to talk to as many of the wonderful people in our Organized Play community as I can. It's gotten to the point where I don't even have time to find everyone that I remember fondly from previous years.</p> 
                 <p>My first year at Gen Con was 2009, which was also my first experience with Pathfinder Society. That year was followed by several more, in which I spent increasing amounts of time in the Sagamore Ballroom, eventually trying my hand at convention GMing and HQ. I met Tonya in the Sagamore in 2014, as one of the Tier 1 HQ volunteers. I remember getting so absorbed in the energy of the room that I forgot to eat, and the way Tonya reacted when I told her I'd skipped a meal. For the rest of the show, Tonya regularly checked in on me, and kept putting snacks between me and whatever I was working on. I joined Paizo the following year. It's worth noting that when Tonya came on board as well, she checked on me in the same way she had at Gen Con, this time with homemade goodies.</p> 
                 <p>Gen Con as a Paizo employee is certainly different from Gen Con as a fan. First off, there's the Venture-Captain dinner on Wednesday night, a chance to share a meal and catch up with some of the most dedicated volunteers. This year, my flight to Indy was delayed, but I was glad to make it in time to merely be fashionably late to the event. After that, I got a chance to talk with Thursty in person, proving that he is not a figment of text and video calls on John's tablet. We wandered over to the Sagamore to help out with the final stages of setup before the first morning of the show. The energy on the first day of GenCon is incredible. Standing inside the Paizo booth waiting for the doors to open, I can feel the crowds massing on the other side of the door, and the exhibitors bracing themselves. Sometimes I play the music from the Battle of Helm's Deep in my head in this moment. And then the doors swing open, and the show begins.</p> 
                 <p>While I enjoy working in the booth, I spend as much time in the Sagamore as I can. The highlight of this year for me was overseeing <i><a href="/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm">#10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a></i>. I'd been working on that scenario for months, along with about a dozen other people that it took to pull all of this together: authors, artists, voice actors, Syrinscape folks, and members of the tech, art, editing, website, and marketing teams. Thank you to everyone who helped make the special a success, both those who helped create it and the volunteers who brought it to life.</p> 
                 <p>In addition to time in the booth and the Sagamore, I also got the chance to participate in a few panels: one about secrets of Golarion, one about adventure design and one about what's coming next for the Adventure Card Game. If you're interested in hearing what we said, or listening to any of the other panels Paizo offered at Gen Con, head over to<u><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a></u>. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at Gen Con again next year!</p>

                 <p>This year's Gen Con was one for the history books! Getting to see the first Starfinder Society interactive scenario run in the Sagamore ballroom is certainly an item to check off my bucket list. The best memory from the convention is an amalgam of all the stories I got to her from Starfinder Society players. Starfinder Society launched the previous year at Gen Con, and getting the opportunity to hear from players from across the world about the impact of the game was something that deeply moved me. As with most conventions, Gen Con 2018 sure did recharge my batteries (as one would expect between scenarios!)</p>

                 <p>This year's Gen Con was among the smoothest I've been a part of. The growing organized play developer team handled the huge number of scenarios well, and the three different specials all proceeded smoothly. This last point was true in part because each multi-table interactive special was in a different developer's hands—a huge boon considering how much effort each of those takes to pull together. <a href="/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm">The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a>, which debuted that weekend, was especially spectacular thanks to the pre-recorded voice talents of Jason Keeley (Aram Zey) and Samantha Phelan (narrator). Down at the Paizo booth, setup proceeded more cleanly than ever, and I had the pleasure of meeting many of you either as you stopped by to pick up your playtest materials or when I wandered around the Sagamore Ballroom to check out the action. For all of the good times, this Gen Con was my first in memory where I felt an impending illness by the end of the convention, so if I was a little scatterbrained when talking to you on the last two days, I was probably also a little fuzzy from managing my health. My biggest regret? Gen Con's such a big, busy production that I rarely get a chance to actually play the game I work on, so I appreciate getting to run the occasional demo that weekend and hearing about your experiences.</p>

                 <p>Gen Con 2018 was a really exciting convention for me on a few fronts. Growing up in Alaska, I never made it to conventions that weren't on the west coast, so this was actually my first Gen Con. While working the Paizo booth left me wishing I had more time to go check out all the other awesome booths and products in the show, it also gave me a lot of opportunities to interact with our customers one-on-one and get to hear what they thought of our various products, including the new Pathfinder Playtest. Getting to talk to people face-to-face about the things they liked and didn't like was a great learning experience, and it gave me an opportunity to share my own insights and experiences, both as Paizo's newest developer and as someone who came to Paizo after working as a designer in the 3pp market for classic Pathfinder.</p> 
                 <p>I also got to check out the Sagamore Ballroom, where the organized play events were happening, and wow! I don't know think I've ever seen that many people playing Pathfinder in one place at one time. It was a particularly cool experience because I'd been the developer on many of the featured scenarios, and I had a few opportunities to meander through the room and watch people playing the adventures I'd worked on. I don't know that there's any experience quite like hearing people I had never met before tell me what a great time they had in an encounter I developed, or hearing a GM relay their experiences with an adventure I worked on. It was both humbling and gratifying, and I'm so grateful to Paizo and all of the organized play volunteers whose efforts allowed it to happen.</p> 
                 <p>I'd also be remiss if I didn't thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Ron Lundeen for the awesome Adventure Design panel we ran! From talking about pro tips and pitfalls of designing adventures to actually brainstorming an adventure with the audience, that was a serious highlight of the convention for me. I'm not sure if the audience was swept up in the moment or if they were testing our ability to roll with some wild ideas, but I'd actually love to sit down and write up our brainstormed adventure about high-level heroes recovering a castle made of soul-imprisoning ice from the depths of Hell (nicknamed "Castle H-ice-t" by me and pretty much nobody else.)</p>

             <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> 
             <p>We are three quarters through 2018 and are adding more GMs to the 5* roster. Huge congratulations to all those that achieved their fifth star over the past month!</p> 
             <p>To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

              <p>This new campaign begins in the small town of Roderic's Cove, and at the end of the Player's Guide you'll find a little chart that each of you will get to roll on at the start of the adventure, to determine what sort of bargains you might have uncovered at the town's weekly Circle Market. And never fear, if you find something you can't quite afford at the start, chances are good your bargain will still be for sale later in the week, once you've started to make your names as adventurers and have a bit more coin to your names. Certainly nothing bad will happen at the Circle Market, right?</p> 
              <p>While the first adventure, <a href="/products/btpya1r8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-133-Secrets-of-Roderics-Cove"><em>Secrets of Roderic's Cove</em></a>, takes place in the town itself, note that Return of the Runelords does not stay here—you won't be returning to Roderic's Cove during the course of the campaign in a significant way, so make sure your characters are both ready to defend the town but also eager to move on to explore the world. Your GM has additional information about Roderic's Cove, as presented in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #133</em>—but everyone might find the map attached to this blog post helpful in exploring.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">The playtest of the new version of Pathfinder is well underway, and with it comes a variety of changes to the game and how it works. There are a number of parts of the game that we're looking at for revision, but we want to get a bit more data in on them first. Signature skills, ancestry benefits, and multiclassing archetypes are all under review, and some of these systems might need additional testing before the playtest process is over. As we get closer, we'll let you know what changes you can expect to see.</p> 
              <p>While we're on the topic, it's important to note that there will be other parts of the game we'll be changing between now and the final version, but that some of these parts aren't really very practical for us to test. Take the introduction to the book, for example. From all your early feedback, we've realized a number of ways in which this chapter could be improved, from including more examples to reorganizing some of the information to help folks learning the game. The team is already hard at work figuring out a better structure for the chapter and we feel that when you get the final version, the results of your feedback will really show.</p> 
              <p>While I have your attention, there's a matter of presentation that we're contemplating changing, but we want your thoughts before we do. It has to do with saving throws. Currently, there are a lot of spells and effects in the game that look something like this.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p class="stat-block-title">Fireball <span class="stat-block-cr">Spell 3</span></p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1">Evocation, Fire</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> 500 feet;<b> Area</b> 20-foot burst</p> 
               <hr style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"> 
               <p class="stat-block-1">A burst of fire explodes, dealing 6d6 fire damage; creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Success</b> The creature takes half damage.</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Critical Success</b> The creature is unaffected.</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Failure</b> The creature takes full damage.</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Critical Failure</b> The creature takes double damage.</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage increases by 2d6.</p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>The degrees of success for the saving throw are pretty common throughout the spells chapter. In fact, they're so common that we thought it might make sense to simplify the process a bit. So, if a spell or effect is one where you take half damage on a success, take no damage on a critical success, take full damage on a failure, and take double on a critical failure, we're contemplating calling that a basic saving throw. Using this sort of scheme, <i>fireball </i>might look like this.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p class="stat-block-title">Fireball <span class="stat-block-cr">Spell 3</span></p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1">Evocation, Fire</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> 500 feet;<b> Area</b> 20-foot burst</p> 
               <hr style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"> 
               <p class="stat-block-1">A burst of fire explodes, dealing 6d6 fire damage to creatures in the area, depending on their basic Reflex saves.</p> 
               <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage increases by 2d6.</p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>That version is a lot cleaner and it takes up quite a bit less space, but this would be another term that players and GMs would need to learn. What do you think of this kind of approach? Let us know in the comments below whether or not basic saves are a thing you want to see in Pathfinder.</p>
