  \ while supplies last. All around Gen Con, you'll be able to hear their epic sounds\
  \ and music, including at the Friday night special in the Sagamore Ballroom, the\
  \ Music &amp; Ambiance in Gaming panel on Sunday. Plus, if you top by the booth\
  \ on Sunday, you (and your voice) can get a chance to become immortalized as Lovecraft's\
  \ insanity-inducing Shoggoth.</p> \n     <p>You'll also get a first look at Ninja\
  \ Division's line of Starfinder miniatures in both the Paizo and Ninja Division\
