  description\">Pride month is a time to celebrate queer joy, a time to be out and\
  \ proud about our existence. Pride is a protest and always has been. For every victory,\
  \ like the Respect for Marriage Act or the removal of the ban against gay men donating\
  \ blood, there are just as many setbacks to equality. States like Florida and Texas\
  \ pass law after law banning discussion of queer issues in schools and gender-affirming\
  \ medical care, which whips the outrage machine into a frenzy and leads to Target\
  \ employees being attacked over the yearly Pride collection. The LGBTQ+ community\
  \ wonders every day what new attacks on our freedom, our right to simply <em>exist</em>,\
  \ await us in the news.</p> \n     <p>The theme of this year’s Pride is “Rage and\
  \ Resilience.” In recognition and celebration of our wonderful community of LGBTQ+\
  \ staffers and freelance contributors, we asked them to submit something about what\
  \ gives them strength. We hope you enjoy hearing from them and encourage our community\
  \ members to share their own responses in the comments!</p> \n     <p>Happy Pride,\
  \ everyone! May you all get a new set of rainbow dice that rolls as well as mine\
  \ does.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\

  \ \n     <p>Age 15. I came out as pansexual. My community was fairly progressive,\
  \ but I still encountered people who thought I should just pick an easier label.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Age 16. I came out as aromantic. Anyone who had met me knew I was a\
  \ hopeless romantic, in love with love, and told me it was a phase.</p> \n     <p>Age\
  \ 17. I came out as a trans lesbian. I was met with anger, derision, mourning someone\
  \ who did not die.</p> \n     <p>As time went on I debated if any of those things\
  \ were accurate at all. I felt anger at myself for not figuring it out earlier,\
  \ at my community for not letting me express myself.</p> \n     <p>Fast forward.\
  \ Age 27. I'm out and proud as a xenogender aromantic pansexual lesbian. It is the\
  \ multiplicity of my existence, the fact that I can be all of these things at once\
  \ and love with all my heart that makes me strong.</p> \n     <p>Find what makes\
  \ you strong and let it lift you up, and when people tell you your identity is wrong,\
  \ know that they are simply too weak to accept your truth. In adversity there is\
  \ community. In love there is life. Be strong. Together.</p> \n     <br> \n    \
  \ <h3>James Jacobs (he/him)<br> Pathfinder Narrative Creative Director</h3> \n \
  \    <p>I find strength from friends and family, but thinking it over, I’ve got\
  \ a potentially unexpected answer to the question “What gives me strength?” Horror\
  \ gives me strength. I understand that the genre isn’t for everyone, but it defines\
  \ who I am. From a kid watching horror movies with my dad, or while reading horror\
  \ comic books and novels given to me by my grandparents, or while writing horror\
  \ stories for school, the genre of fear has always given me strength. Whenever I\
  \ finished a story (be it a movie, novel, game session, campfire tale, or whatever),\
  \ I felt stronger, especially while growing up amid horrors both small (those endless\
  \ school bullies) and enormous (the threat of nuclear apocalypse). There’s a reason\
  \ horror sees its greatest growth during times of despair—and when times are good,\
  \ the genre falters. It’d be nice to live in a world where I didn’t need horror\
  \ to feel strong, but in the meantime, horror helps me continue my journey toward\
  \ that world. Especially when I get to share my love of horror with friends or family,\
  \ so… huh. I guess friends and family ARE at the core of it all!</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>Carlos Cabrera (he/they)</h3> \n     <p>It gives me strength/I am jealous\

  \ by strangers since I started middle school, I know that I'm able to make a change\
  \ just by existing as a visibly queer person. My mere presence challenges the public's\
  \ preconceived notions of trans people. It's scary sometimes, I won't lie—but it's\
  \ unavoidable and a responsibility I must bear. I couldn't do it without the help\
  \ of my chosen family, both here at home in Alabama and in other states.</p> \n\
  \     <p>People question why I stay here when the law is becoming more hostile by\
  \ the day. I stay in Alabama because I love the queer communities that flourish\
  \ here, and because I know that if there weren't so many trans and gender-nonconforming\
  \ people down here in the South, our lawmakers wouldn't be trying to legislate us\
  \ out of existence. I stay in Alabama because there are people down here who can't\
  \ leave and we need to stand together to survive. I stay in Alabama because it's\
  \ my home, and I'm determined to keep it and my communities safe from people who\
  \ would see it all destroyed. What gives me strength and keeps me going? Community.</p>\

  \ \n     <p>Hey, I’m Rue (they/he/xe), and I’m a mixed race, nonbinary, disabled\
  \ creator, as well as Paizo’s Marketing &amp; Media Specialist! I’ve been doing\
  \ freelance writing with Paizo for about a year—my first writing credit is in our\
  \ newly announced <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, and I’m new here on the\
  \ marketing team! Above all else, my friends and family give me strength. I have\
  \ the joy of living with my two wonderful spouses, Rina and Jalen, and I know that\
  \ they’ll always be there for me just like I’m here for them. My parents are proud\
  \ of me even if they don’t necessarily understand what I do. It’s wonderful to know\
  \ that I’m surrounded by people who I love and who love me back. Another thing I\
  \ find strength in is the goodness of people—and how our community is quick to come\
  \ together to support those in need. Running two very successful fundraisers for\
  \ trans rights didn’t just help monetarily; it also showed folx in Florida and Texas\
  \ that we care about them worldwide. And we won’t let them be erased. We’re here,\
  \ we’re queer, and we won’t be erased.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them\
  \ primarily)</h3> \n     <p>If I'd been asked this prompt last year, I would have\
  \ written a lot of flowery prose about the importance of family and friendships.\
  \ I still draw strength from my community; I love and appreciate all of the people\
  \ I've been fortunate enough to build relationships with, both being born to them\
  \ and forging them through time and long conversations at 1:47am.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ being said, this year I've reached a level of self-confidence and inner strength\
  \ I never had before. For the first time, I feel focused and at ease enough to fight\
  \ for myself in both my professional and personal life. I draw strength in being\
  \ able to live my life in appreciation of myself, and I hope that's a sentiment\
  \ many others can agree with. I find a lot of peace in knowing that I always have\
  \ myself in my corner. I don't know if I would be as happy as I am now without them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You'll see my work in both <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia</em> books,\

  m Amber Stewart (she/her) and what gives me strength is seeing how my work and that\
  \ of my peers serves as an idealized mirror for players to see themselves represented\
  \ in-game, or as a playground to explore their identity in fantasy. Coming to recognize\
  \ and accept where you fit on the spectrum of orientation and gender identity is\
  \ a unique thing for each of us, and TTRPGs can be part of that process—it absolutely\
  \ was for me. You might not immediately recognize that something in-game reflects\
  \ part of who you are, and play can help unlock some of that identity and provide\
  \ an avenue for you to explore it: I know that playing female PCs (at an ever-increasing\
  \ frequency over time) was for me part of my journey to accepting myself as being\
  \ trans, and then as an outlet to explore that identity well before anyone in my\
  \ family but my partner was aware.</p> \n     <p>Now, I might play to my own experiences\
  \ more than not in my content, but with a broad freelance community, we get a LOT\
  \ of voices represented. It’s cool, inspiring, and wholesome to see and I’m ever\
  \ prouder of this community with each passing year.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Kendra\
  \ Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>Hello! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, bisexual\
  \ (and demisexual) disaster and frequent freelancer for Paizo. You may have spotted\
  \ my name on several books recently, including <em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault</em>\
  \ and <em>To Defy the Dragon</em>, a Starfinder standalone mech adventure that might\
  \ help tide you over until <em>Mechageddon!</em>.</p> \n     <p>It’s a tough time\
  \ to be queer, especially for our trans and nonbinary friends and family. I’m not\
  \ as recognizably queer as many others, which has advantages and disadvantages.\
  \ I could stop talking about certain aspects of myself and pass as straight, but\
  \ I don’t want to. My pithy answer to what gives me strength is spite. My more heartfelt\
  \ answer is community, both among LGBTQ+ folks and allies in the Paizosphere and\
  \ among my other queer friends. The bigots are vocal, but acceptance is increasing\
  \ overall, particularly in younger generations. I think the recent backlash against\
  \ us is driven by their fear that they're losing.</p> \n     <p>Sometimes I come\
  \ across historical photos online, grainy black-and-white images of queer couples,\
  \ of people proudly wearing clothes associated with a different gender, and I feel\
  \ a sense of community across time. We have always been here. We will always be\
  \ here. And we are worth celebrating.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Brent Bowser (he/they)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Growing up in a small farm town, I used to think there was something\
  \ wrong with me because I was the only one. Gaming helped me find myself and others\
  \ like me. I've volunteered with the Organized Play campaign for over ten years,\
  \ and the caring, generous, accepting friends I've made saved my life. And if bigots\
  \ and jerks don't feel welcome in Organized Play, then I've done my job.</p> \n\

  \ to work harder to get by. As an Asian woman, I am constantly fighting the stereotype\

  \ think, so as long as I succeed and continue to uplift marginalized voices with\

  \ that represents the richness and complexity of the LGBTQ+ community.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Those spaces we make for ourselves and each other are a key part of what\
  \ keeps me resilient. I find it easy to get overwhelmed by bad news (especially\
  \ when it's so widespread). When I do, I'm able to remind myself that the small\
  \ actions we take to make people feel welcome and safe make a difference. Whether\
  \ that's making sure our settings represent the diversity of our world, taking steps\
  \ to keep the games we play inclusive, or simply sharing the bits of LGBTQ+ culture\

  \     <p>Growing up, the pervasive message about strength was that it comes from\
  \ within—the action hero who goes it alone, the player character who levels up after\
  \ each struggle, the message that boys need to suck it up. As I grow older, I’ve\
  \ learned that personal strength only carries you so far. True strength comes from\
  \ opening yourself up to others, even if it also makes you vulnerable. For me, strength\
  \ comes from community.</p> \n     <p>I am so lucky to have found an amazing community\
  \ in tabletop. From the inclusivity at cons to the thoughtful and empathetic team\
  \ at Paizo to the generosity of my fellow freelancers, I have learned and grown\
  \ so much. My goal is to give back and encourage the same behaviors that inspire\
  \ me to stand up for my beliefs and live my truths. One such way is through the\
  \ <em>Queerfinder</em> zine series on Pathfinder Infinite, which aims to introduce\
  \ queer-identifying aspiring designers and artists to veterans in the industry.\

  \ <h3>Jenny Jarzabski (she/her/xe)<br> Starfinder Senior Developer</h3> \n     <p>Hi,\
  \ I’m Jenny Jarzabski. Working with the Starfinder team is one of the things that\
  \ fills me with pride and fuels my hope every day that a better world is possible.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>When encountering a Starfinder NPC (nonplayer character), you can\
  \ assume that character is queer unless explicitly stated otherwise. This is only\
  \ partly a joke considering the myriad weird and wonderful celebrations of queer\
  \ identities in the setting. </p> \n     <p>Examining society’s gender constructs\
  \ and ultimately turning them upside down is a long and proud tradition for sci-fi\
  \ creators. As we create infinite fictional worlds, we imagine humanity’s own infinite\
  \ possibilities. Here on Earth many people recognize multiple genders in humans,\
  \ though the truth is more complex and subtle even than “male,” “female,” and “\
  nonbinary.” In the fictional worlds of Starfinder, understanding has progressed\
  \ even further. Add aliens to the mix and it gets super interesting!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>For example: maraquoi, a fur-covered simian species, have seven genders that\
  \ each play a different role in reproduction. Shirrens—an insectoid, choice-obsessed\
  \ people who broke away from the destructive Swarm—present three genders: female,\
  \ host, and male. Astrazoans are shapeshifting echinoderms with no inherent concept\
  \ of gender, and synthetic lifeforms like anacites and androids can choose to adopt\
  \ humanoid gender roles and pronouns or create their own.</p> \n     <p>I’m proud\
  \ of my personal contributions to our queer cosmos, not to mention the fantastic\
  \ additions to the Starfinder setting made by dozens of queer creators. To those\
  \ creators: I’m honored to help amplify your voices and develop your work. Because\
  \ of you, the Starfinder multiverse is a more beautiful, diverse reality.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Starfinder is set far in Pathfinder’s future, in an era when many alien\
  \ cultures have already achieved peace and prosperity, and social progression has\
  \ advanced beyond the norm here on Earth. This vibrant reality is imperiled by threats\
  \ from both beyond the stars and in their own backyards, but even in the face of\
  \ these dangers, a Starfinder character can proudly be who they are. And that’s\
  \ why Starfinder’s worlds are worth fighting for, just like ours.</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>Dustin Knight (he/him)<br> Starfinder Developer</h3> \n     <p>After\
  \ years of contemplating the definition of love, I find an endless source of strength\
  \ in the seemingly endless journey to completely learn what it means to love oneself.\
  \ It might seem a little intense to bring this up in a blog post for a tabletop\
  \ RPG company, but I couldn’t have made it this far on my continuing journey toward\
  \ self-acceptance and self-respect without these games, this community, and these\
  \ annual blog posts. The commitment to love expressed and confirmed time and time\
  \ again by this community has helped me learn who I am and accept that with pride\
  \ instead of guilt or shame. There is an unparalleled cathartic magic to roleplaying\
  \ and storytelling, and I draw endless strength from the idea that my contributions\
  \ to our hobby may help others down their path of self-acceptance and self-love.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Katrina Hennessy (she/they)</h3> \n     <p>I hesitated\
  \ to write this, not only because life is at its chaotic best, but because I feel\
  \ I don’t belong. I’m not really a part of the LGBTQ+ community, yet I’m not not\
  \ part of it. For most of my life I knew I didn’t fit, but I played my part anyway.\
  \ I am a happily married woman with adult offspring, but I still don’t fit in The\
  \ Box where most of society automatically places me.</p> \n     <p>The Paizo community\
  \ provided strength and support to learn by allowing me to witness others on their\
  \ own path, providing hints and a direction to look. I think I now know which labels\
  \ apply, but it doesn’t really matter. All of this has helped me better accept myself\
  \ and feel less different. I won’t say normal, as I’m not sure that is a word that\
  \ should ever be applied to any human being. Everything about humans (and probably\
  \ most living creatures) exists on a spectrum.</p> \n     <p>So, if you aren’t sure\
  \ where you belong on the spectrum, that’s OK. If you want to poke around and try\
  \ to work it out, this is a great community to be in while you do so. No obligations\
  \ to make announcements, fly flags, or anything else. Nothing wrong with doing so\
  \ and please accept and respect those who do. Being quietly personal about your\
  \ status also deserves respect.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <table class=\"\

  \ </tbody>\n     </table> \n     <h3>Andrew Mullen (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>I’m Andrew,\
  \ and a few months ago I realized I’m bi! That was sort of a weird thing to have\
  \ happen, seeing as I’m a dude in his late 30s with a wife and a toddler. I guess\
  \ when society assumes you’re heterosexual, and your attractions mostly match up\
  \ with that, then you assume you’re straight, too.</p> \n     <p>I draw a lot of\
  \ strength from my family. When I told my wife, Melissa, about the realization,\
  \ she was just glad I’d discovered something about myself. As we talked more, she\
  \ projected a very uncomplicated and sincere sense of affirmation. What better than\
  \ that, when you’re open and vulnerable in unfamiliar territory? My parents and\
  \ close friends were similarly supportive!</p> \n     <p>You know how the right\
  \ acts like it owns the “traditional” family? Well, queer folks of all stripes are\
  \ out here having families that look like a 1950s all-American ad. It’s very satisfying\
  \ to disprove and reject bigotry by being myself.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Alexi\
  \ J. Greer (they/them)</h3> \n     <p>I remember living in Orlando in 2021, with\
  \ my polycule and gathering of queer and trans friends. I didn’t know what would\
  \ happen in the next two years, but there was something in the air that made me\
  \ pause that summer. “I think we should seriously consider moving up near your family\
  \ in New England,” I told my fiancé. I worked through illness and sleepless nights\
  \ to make the move work, but it did. Then it wasn't even three months before I was\
  \ messaging my friends down in FL. \"Stay strong and keep going. We're going to\
  \ make a plan to bring you up here.\"</p> \n     <p>What gives me strength are the\
  \ people I care about and my determination to see them happy. And my confidence\
  \ that we can fight for happiness; not just our own, but others' too. Happiness\
  \ should be chased, not negotiated for as if it were a commodity to be rationed\
  \ out. Evil pretends to represent the majority, but it's a boldfaced lie. There's\
  \ a wider world that wants you here, with us, and shining as your full self. And\
  \ if you're in need, I know I'm not alone when I vow to support you too.</p> \n\
