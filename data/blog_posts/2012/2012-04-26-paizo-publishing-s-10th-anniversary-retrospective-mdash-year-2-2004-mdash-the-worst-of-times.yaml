  \            <h2>The Worst of Times</h2>\n            <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ April 26th, 2012</p>\n            <p class=\"tiny\">This blog entry is the third\
  \ in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\"\
  >Click here to read the first installment.</a></p>\n            <p>As 2004 opened,\
  \ there was a cloud hanging over Paizo. The reality that <em>Star Wars Insider</em>\
  \ and the <em>Star Wars Fan Club</em> were going away in a few short months really\
  \ hit home. Star Wars accounted for more than half of Paizo's revenue, and supporting\
  \ the company purely on income from <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> wasn't\
  \ going to work. I personally had two options. The easiest would be to shut down\
  \ the company. As I mentioned in my first anniversary blog, it takes a long time\
  \ to get paid for magazine sales, and while that makes starting up a magazine very\
  \ difficult, it also means that if you stop publishing, money keeps coming in for\
  \ almost a year. It would have taken a while, but eventually, we'd have been able\
  \ to recoup most of the money that Vic and I had invested in Paizo.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>The other, much more daunting option was to try to replace that lost revenue.\
  \ Subscription and advertising revenue would dry up immediately, of course, and\
  \ that would hurt a lot, but we would still be receiving big <em>Star Wars Insider</em>\
  \ newsstand checks for almost a year after our final issue went out in April. That\
  \ gave us some time to ramp up new business to replace the lost income. We had already\
  \ launched <em>Undefeated</em> in 2003, and were hopeful that it would start to\
  \ pick up some of the slack. The other arrow in our quiver was the venerable <em>Amazing\
  \ Stories</em> magazine, which had been included in the license along with <em>Dragon</em>\
  \ and <em>Dungeon</em> when we took over Wizards of the Coast's magazine business.\
  \ <em>Amazing Stories</em> launched in 1926 as the world's first magazine dedicated\
  \ to science fiction. TSR had acquired it in 1982 and published it for 13 years,\
  \ putting it on hiatus just a couple of years before Wizards acquired TSR. Wizards\
  \ almost immediately brought <em>Amazing</em> back, publishing it for about 3 years\
  \ before resting it themselves in 2000. We decided to try to make it work yet again,\
  \ with the staff from <em>Star Wars Insider</em> mostly moving directly to <em>Amazing</em>\
  \ and Dave Gross becoming the magazine's 16th Editor-in-Chief.</p>\n           \
  \ <p>This time, we had a slightly different plan. <em>Amazing Stories</em> had always\
  \ focused almost entirely on prose fiction, with short stories making up the bulk\
  \ of each issue. We wanted to continue running great original fiction, but we also\
  \ wanted to cover the rest of sci-fi/fantasy genre: movies, TV shows, comics, video\
  \ games, etc. We were hoping that we could make a magazine that appealed to fans\
  \ of science fiction and fantasy, and that the expanded media coverage would make\
  \ the magazine appealing to a larger advertising base.</p>\n            <div class=\"\

  \ of the 501st Legion at the Star Wars Fan Club Dinner With the Stars.\n       \
  \     </div>\n            <p>But before we relaunched <em>Amazing</em>, we needed\
  \ to finish up our run on <em>Star Wars Insider</em> and the Official Star Wars\
  \ Fan Club, and we didn't take that job any less seriously while our time was running\
  \ out. In February, we held the first and only Fan Club Dinner with the Stars here\
  \ in Seattle to coincide with Emerald City Comicon. Our guests were Michonne Bourriague\
  \ (Aurra Sing in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>), and Amy Allen (Aayla Secura in <em>Attack\
  \ of the Clones</em> and <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, which hadn't yet been released).\
  \ In addition to dinner with the guests, attendees received a stash of Star Wars\
  \ merchandise supplied by Paizo and Lucasfilm, and a special autographed souvenir\
  \ photo ticket created just for the event (we still have a few of those for sale\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy73dr\">here on paizo.com</a>).</p>\n            <p>Paizo's\
  \ final issue of <em>Star Wars Insider</em> in April revealed Episode III villain\
  \ General Grievous, who had previously only been seen in animated form. And as my\
  \ reign as President of the Official Star Wars Fan Club concluded, I got a chance\
  \ to go down to San Francisco and dig around in the Star Wars product archives,\
  \ which was a real thrill for Vic and me as collectors.</p>\n            <p>With\
  \ the loss of Star Wars, <em>Dragon</em> became king at Paizo, boasting both the\
  \ largest number of subscribers as well as the best newsstand sales. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7zvu\"><em>Dragon</em> #315</a> was the first issue ever published\
  \ which had support for <em>every</em> D&amp;D campaign setting—<em>19</em> of them—\
  from Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk to Red Steel and Hollow World. <a href=\"/products/btpy7oka\"\
  ><em>Dragon</em> #319</a>, coupled with its sister publication <a href=\"/products/btpy7zcw\"\
  ><em>Dungeon</em> #110</a>, gave 3.5 DMs everything they might need to set a campaign\
  \ in the world of Dark Sun. <a href=\"/products/btpy7ec0\"><em>Dragon</em></a> #320\
  \ celebrated the 30th anniversary of D&amp;D with one of my favorite pieces of cover\
  \ artwork ever!</p>\n            <div class=\"blurb180\">\n             <a href=\"\

  \              Lisa Stevens at the Paizo booth sporting the Warduke T-shirt made\
  \ for the<em>Dungeon</em> relaunch and Erik Mona showing off the T-shirt designed\
  \ for the relaunch of <em>Dragon</em>.\n            </div>\n            <p>The biggest\
  \ news for <em>Dragon</em> that year came at Gen Con, in the form of a relaunch\
  \ that began with <a href=\"/products/btpy7ye5\"><em>Dragon</em> #323</a>. We had\
  \ heard from our readers that our issues were often too hit-or-miss for them—with\
  \ narrow themes such as Dark Sun or ninjas, there was always some portion of the\
  \ audience that wouldn't find it useful. And if a large enough group skipped a particular\
  \ issue, we'd lose money on it. So our new goal was to provide something for everyone\
  \ with every issue. Since many of <em>Dragon</em>'s readers were players, we started\
  \ the Class Acts section, which would include a short article for each of the core\
  \ classes. We also put more consideration into balancing the types of articles that\
  \ made up each issue to ensure that we didn't leave anyone out. For the most part,\
  \ this seemed to really work, and <em>Dragon</em>'s sales started to improve.</p>\n\
  \            <p>With the continuation of the Adventure Path concept we'd launched\
  \ the previous year, things were also looking up for <em>Dungeon</em>. 2004 ended\
  \ up being one of the most important years for the magazine, and its success eventually\
  \ heralded Erik Mona's rise from Editor-in-Chief to Publisher and James Jacobs'\
  \ rise from Associate Editor to Creative Director.</p>\n            <p><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7ok8\"><em>Dungeon</em> #111</a> introduced the first-ever adventure\
  \ for Eberron, and the following month saw <em>Dungeon</em>'s most ambitious issue\
  \ ever: Erik and James worked with Gary Gygax and Robert J. Kuntz to revise and\
  \ expand Kuntz's famous Maure Castle superdungeon. This issue also marked the first\
  \ and only time that <em>Dungeon</em> had just one massive adventure packed between\
  \ the covers.</p>\n            <div class=\"blurb180\">\n             <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n             <br>\n              The Undefeated cheerleaders and the temporary\
  \ tattoos from Gen Con 2004.\n            </div>\n            <p>At Gen Con, <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ also had a relaunch with <a href=\"/products/btpy7to0\">issue #114</a>, with even\
  \ bigger changes than we'd made in <em>Dragon</em>. First off, <em>Polyhedron</em>\
  \ went away as the companion offering to each <em>Dungeon</em> issue. This was significant\
  \ to Erik especially, as he had come up through the ranks as <em>Polyhedron</em>'s\
  \ Editor-in-Chief, and the magazine held an important place in his heart. But readers\
  \ were making it clear to us that <em>Polyhedron</em> was a very divisive feature,\
  \ and if we wanted to give <em>Dungeon</em> a chance to catch up to its more successful\
  \ brother, <em>Polyhedron</em> had to go.</p>\n            <p>We also moved <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ to a format that featured one low-level, one mid-level, and one high-level adventure\
  \ in each issue. This gave DMs a treasure trove of adventure content that ensured\
  \ there was something that could fit their campaigns no matter what levels they\
  \ were currently playing. In addition to the three adventures, Dungeon would now\
  \ feature new campaign content in each issue. <a href=\"/products/btpy7to0\"><em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ #114</a> revisited the Isle of Dread and saw the start of Monte Cook's \"Dungeoncraft\"\
  \ and Wil Wheaton's \"Wil Save\" columns. It also featured the very popular \"Mad\
  \ God's Key,\" the first published work by Jason Bulmahn. The end of 2004 saw the\
  \ final adventure in the Shackled City Adventure Path and the start of the well-received\
  \ three-part Greyhawk Istvin series.</p>\n            <p><em>Undefeated</em> magazine\
  \ grew a little bit, finding new subscribers and appearing in a few more mass-market\
  \ outlets. However, we were still having trouble getting the traction that we really\
  \ needed in our key market: hobby game stores. At Gen Con, we had Paizo's most controversial\
  \ promotion ever: the <em>Undefeated</em> cheerleaders, who applied <em>Undefeated</em>\
  \ temporary tattoos to con-goers arms. It definitely helped drive traffic to the\
  \ Paizo booth, even if not everyone was happy about us having \"booth babes.\"</p>\n\
  \            <div class=\"blurb180\">\n             <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120426-AmazingCover.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120426-AmazingCover_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \             <br>\n              Spider-Man adorns the first Paizo issue of Amazing\
  \ Stories.\n            </div>\n            <p><em>Amazing Stories</em> launched\
  \ in September, though we offered a sneak peek at Gen Con in August. The first issue\
  \ showed off <em>Amazing</em>'s new look with a <em>Spider-Man</em> movie cover.\
  \ It also had my favorite thing we published in Amazing Stories: Dave Gross had\
  \ devised a column called \"1,000 Words,\" where we would provide a writer with\
  \ a picture, and they would write a story using—you guessed it—1,000 words. Harlan\
  \ Ellison—er, sorry... \"Harlan Ellison®\"—was pegged to write the first installment,\
  \ but due to a miscommunication, he wrote only 100 words. When we pointed out the\
  \ problem, Harlan befuddled us again by turning in... another 100 words. Desperately,\
  \ we reached out to Neil Gaiman, who saved the day by writing a hilarious 800-word\
  \ introduction to Harlan's 200-word story. I couldn't stop laughing!</p>\n     \
  \       <p>At the end of August, Paizo moved into new offices on Richards Road in\
  \ Bellevue. Located just a few blocks away from our first office space, it finally\
  \ gave us room to give everybody a desk—and most importantly, we actually had warehouse\
  \ space, and no longer had to stack back issues in the hallways (something that\
  \ had caused many frowns from the fire inspector).</p>\n            <p>The biggest\
  \ change we made at Paizo, though, was largely hidden behind the scenes until late\
  \ in the year. Webmaster Rob Head added programmer Gary Teter to our web team, and\
  \ the two of them spent months building an infrastructure that would completely\
  \ transform paizo.com. Our original website had really been little more than a portal\
  \ to sign up for magazine subscriptions and a place to post news releases. In August,\
  \ we rolled out a new paizo.com complete with messageboards, which quickly become\
  \ home to an incredible community. And in November, we launched our e-commerce store\
  \ selling not just Paizo's own products, but for the first time offering thousands\
  \ of gaming items from hundreds of gaming companies. Our first day's sales, on November\
  \ 24, 2004, weren't earth shattering—in fact, we only did $1,124.56 in total sales\
  \ the first week! (Trivia: the first non-Paizo product sold through the site was\
  \ White Wolf's World of Darkness: Antagonists hardcover.) Though it started slow,\
  \ eventually the paizo.com community and our web store would become two of the most\
  \ important things that keep Paizo running.</p>\n            <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Road and a peek through the front door, where David Neri answers calls at the\
  \ new office. To the right, Prepress Manager Kelly O'Brien shows off our high-end\
  \ Creo Veris machine, used to create color proofs for each page of our magazines.\n\
  \            </div>\n            <p>We'd also had a few big staffing changes at\
  \ Paizo. After Mary Franklin left the company to join Lucasfilm—where she still\
  \ is today—Jeff Alvarez, who had started only the previous year as a Customer Service\
  \ Representative, was made Director of Operations. Keith Strohm was promoted to\
  \ Chief Operating Officer in August, and in October, Erik Mona was promoted to Editor-in-Chief\
  \ of both <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em>, a well-deserved change of title\
  \ for all of his hard work on <em>Dungeon</em> and <em>Polyhedron</em> that year.</p>\n\
  \            <p>The entire Paizo staff had worked their butts off in 2004, but at\
  \ the end of the year, I was faced with a very tough choice. Even with the launch\
  \ of <em>Amazing Stories</em> and the growth of <em>Dragon</em>, <em>Dungeon</em>,\
  \ and <em>Undefeated</em>, Paizo wasn't even coming close to making up the lost\
  \ revenue from <em>Star Wars Insider</em>. We had finally located the flaws in Johnny\
  \ Wilson's \"Three-Legged Stool\" model of the magazine business (detailed in the\
  \ \"Debunking the Three-Legged Stool\" section below). Our cash reserves were depleted,\
  \ and I had actually started to put some of my retirement money into the company\
  \ to make ends meet—something I had promised myself that I would never do. The stress\
  \ on me personally was the highest that I have ever borne in my 25 years in the\
  \ industry. I now knew what they meant when they said that Conan ruled over Hyboria\
  \ with a heavy brow. There was one particular moment that will forever be etched\
  \ into my brain: It was a Friday in early December, and Vic and I were driving home\
  \ from the office late in the evening. It had been a particularly hard day, with\
  \ money being tight and a bunch of bills going unpaid. I had been agonizing over\
  \ spreadsheets with sobering names like 2005Hardline.xls, 2005BudgetcutUndft.xls,\
  \ 2005NoAmazing.xls, 2005BudgetSmallSalaries.xls, 2005Budgetcutpeople.xls, and 2005Armeggedon.xls.</p>\n\
  \            <p>You have to understand, the people at Paizo are my friends. And\
  \ with just a few keystrokes on a spreadsheet, I was potentially destroying lives,\
  \ or at least changing their trajectories forever. The stress took over while driving\
  \ home and I had to pull over to the side of the road and started bawling. I knew\
  \ in my heart that I needed to make some drastic changes to give the company a chance\
  \ to survive. I needed to cut <em>Amazing Stories</em> and <em>Undefeated</em> and\
  \ all of their staffs to give Paizo a chance. But at that moment, sitting on the\
  \ side of the road, I just wanted all of it to end. I turned to Vic and said, \"\
  I am done. I can't do this anymore. Let's just close it all down. I don't care about\
  \ the money anymore. I just don't want to feel like this each day. I am not strong\
  \ enough to carry this burden.\" If I had been alone, I might just have ended Paizo\
  \ on that day; I was that low. But Vic picked me up, got me talking about the good\
  \ things we had at Paizo. Got me thinking about how this wasn't the end, just a\
  \ very large bump in the road.</p>\n            <p>But it still was a very hard\
  \ time for me. The first thing I did was lay myself off. There was no way that I\
  \ was going to draw a paycheck if I had to lay off a bunch of my colleagues. I would\
  \ work for free and not get paid again until Paizo was on better footing. Then,\
  \ on December 16, I had to do something that I promised myself I would never do:\
  \ I had to lay off a bunch of people. All told, six people lost their jobs that\
  \ day.</p>\n            <p>At the end of the day, Paizo was a lot leaner and focused.\
  \ For now, we were the <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> magazine company. But\
  \ laying off six people wasn't magically going to put us on the path to prosperity.\
  \ There was a LOT of hard work to be done in 2005. We needed to start building the\
  \ foundations of an entirely new company.</p>\n            <blockquote>\n      \

  \            <p class=\"tiny\">*laid off as part of the cancellation of <em>Amazing\
  \ Stories</em> and <em>Undefeated</em></p>\n            <h2>Debunking the Three-Legged\
  \ Stool</h2>\n            <p>In our first anniversary blog, we mentioned Johnny's\
  \ Wilson's \"three-legged stool\" model for magazine publishing, which dictates\
  \ that successful magazines need to garner revenue from three streams: newsstand\
  \ sales, subscriptions, and advertising.</p>\n            <p>Unfortunately, 2004\
  \ was the year that we discovered the major flaw in Johnny's model.</p>\n      \
  \      <p>We knew that <em>Undefeated</em> was never going to attract a ton of subscribers;\
  \ instead, we hoped to make most of our money on that title by selling to the hobby\
  \ gaming market which—unlike sales to newsstands—couldn't be returned and was generally\
  \ finalized within 90 days. We planned to bolster that solid, predictable income\
  \ with advertising revenue from game publishers.</p>\n            <p><em>Amazing\
  \ Stories</em> took the opposite tack. We didn't expect much at all in the way of\
  \ hobby sales, but we hoped to maintain a decent newsstand presence, and, over time,\
  \ build a small-but-loyal subscriber base like we enjoyed with <em>Dragon</em> and\
  \ <em>Dungeon</em>. We hoped to attract advertising from book and comic publishers\
  \ and TV and movie producers.</p>\n            <p>Best of all, we had a shortcut\
  \ that would give <em>Amazing</em> an immediate newsstand presence. Newsstands effectively\
  \ have standing monthly orders for magazines. They may adjust that order from month\
  \ to month, but once they start buying from you, they generally <em>keep</em> buying\
  \ from you. The surprising part is that these standing orders aren't done by magazine\
  \ title, but by something called a bipad. Once you have a bipad, you can actually\
  \ replace one magazine with another, and the standing order will essentially transfer\
  \ to the new title. And our distributor told us that we'd be able to use the <em>Star\
  \ Wars Insider</em> bipad to launch <em>Amazing Stories</em>, so we wouldn't have\
  \ to spend time and money to convince newsstands to pick up the new magazine—it\
  \ would be automatic.</p>\n            <p>In our last blog, we explained that it\
  \ took over a year to get final newsstand sales figures for a particular issue,\
  \ so it wasn't until early 2004 that we had full data on even our first few all-Paizo\
  \ issues of <em>Dragon</em>, <em>Dungeon</em>, and <em>Star Wars Insider</em>. Accountant\
  \ Dave Erickson and I spent a couple of months poring through that data, and we\
  \ finally emerged with a spreadsheet that let us predict sales data for recent issues\
  \ with a fairly high degree of accuracy. Which meant the real analysis could begin.</p>\n\
  \            <p>By the end of 2004, we finally had enough data to prove that magazines\
  \ don't actually <em>make</em> money from newsstand sales. It turns out that almost\
  \ all of the costs associated with newsstand distribution increase in direct proportion\
  \ to the number of copies you distribute; there are almost no economies of scale\
  \ to be had. Therefore, increasing the number of copies you distribute doesn't increase\
  \ your margin at all. The only way to increase the potential profit on newsstand\
  \ sales is to increase the magazine's sell-through—that's the percentage of magazines\
  \ that you've actually sold to customers once all the returns have been finalized.\
  \ But it turns out it's virtually impossible to improve sell-through in any long-term\
  \ way.</p>\n            <p>Unlike hobby stores, newsstands get to return any magazines\
  \ they don't sell. This means that there's no risk associated with them ordering\
  \ too many copies. In fact, retailers deliberately order more than they expect to\
  \ sell, for a couple of good reasons. The most obvious is that they can't sell magazines\
  \ they don't have, so ordering more than they think they'll need ensures that they'll\
  \ have copies to sell in case sales are better than expected. Less obvious is the\
  \ fact that it's easy for customers to overlook a small stack of magazines on the\
  \ stand. On a shelf with dozens of different titles, a single copy of a particular\
  \ magazine can literally get lost in the crowd; it's harder to overlook a stack\
  \ of four or five copies. So retailers don't just want an extra copy or two on hand‚\
  \ they want an extra <em>stack</em> or two. So, no matter how many copies you sell\
  \ in a month, retailers will order more the next month, assuring that if your sales\
  \ continue to be strong, your sell-through percentage will stay pretty much the\
  \ same. And if the next issue proves to be <em>less</em> successful, then they'll\
  \ just return more copies, <em>decreasing</em> your sell-through, and the fees associated\
  \ with the extra printing and the extra returns will likely wipe out any extra revenue\
  \ you may have earned from the previous issue doing so well.</p>\n            <p>What\
  \ is good sell-through, anyway? Anything above 30% was considered pretty good in\
  \ the industry. Our best-ever issues were in the neighborhood of 40%. That means\
  \ that 60% of the issues we printed were destroyed unsold. A bad issue would have\
  \ sell-through in the 10% range. So not only were we sometimes paying to print almost\
  \ nine times as many copies as we actually sold, but we were also paying to have\
  \ all those copies trucked around the country, put out on newsstands, removed from\
  \ newsstands a month later, and then destroyed. Along with, of course, a fee to\
  \ the distributor for tracking all of that activity for us.</p>\n            <p>At\
  \ this point, you may be wondering how all of those other magazines on the newsstand\
  \ survive if none of them make any money. The answer is that those magazines make\
  \ their money almost solely from advertising. (Open up a popular newsstand magazine\
  \ and look at the masthead—that's magazine lingo for the credits page—and you'll\
  \ usually find that the advertising sales staff vastly outnumbers the editorial\
  \ staff.) These magazines are willing to lose <em>piles</em> of money on newsstand\
  \ distribution in order to get people to buy them. The reason is that the more readers\
  \ they have—whether profitable or not—the more they can charge advertisers to reach\
  \ those readers. (This also explains why they often have low, low cover prices that\
  \ don't even cover the cost of printing, or subscription rates that don't even cover\
  \ the cost of postage, much less printing and editorial costs.)</p>\n          \
  \  <p>But specialty magazines like <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> can't bring\
  \ in the same kinds of ads that those magazines can. They're not going to pull high-revenue\
  \ ads for cars, cigarettes, or designer watches. At best, we might get ads for video\
  \ games or high-profile fantasy novels‚ and those only because of <em>Dragon</em>\
  \ and <em>Dungeon</em>'s strong position in those markets, the result of decades\
  \ of history. <em>Amazing Stories</em> and <em>Undefeated</em> didn't have that\
  \ going for them.</p>\n            <p>Generating ad revenue is a difficult business.\
  \ Advertisers want to know that the money they're spending on advertising results\
  \ in increased sales. But it's usually very hard for advertisers to determine whether\
  \ their ads are bringing them customers. From the publisher's side, we could provide\
  \ estimates of the number of people that were potentially reading the ad, and we\
  \ could talk about the prestige of being in the magazine. We could even tell them\
  \ how some distributors would only carry RPG products that were being advertised\
  \ in <em>Dragon</em>. But we couldn't tell them how much of a return they'd get\
  \ on their investment. And as the internet became a more viable—and more measurable—\
  means of spreading the word and selling products, magazine ad sales became harder\
  \ and harder to do.</p>\n            <p>Worse still, even when we <em>did</em> manage\
  \ decent ad sales, actually getting paid was a difficult prospect. Leaf through\
  \ a bunch of old <em>Dragon</em> magazines, and you'll find loads of ads from game\
  \ publishers and game stores that aren't in business anymore. In many cases, those\
  \ folks were already in trouble when their ads were in print, and paying us was\
  \ among the least of their worries. Now, look at some of those full-page ads from\
  \ big companies... would it surprise you to learn that many of them didn't bother\
  \ paying us either? The only recourse we had to keep people paying was that we wouldn't\
  \ run more of their ads until their accounts were paid up—but if companies decided\
  \ they didn't really <em>need</em> to advertise with us, we were just out of luck.\
  \ Eventually, we required advertisers to secure ad placements with credit cards,\
  \ and that helped eliminate most of the deadbeats—but it also reduced the number\
  \ of people willing to place ads with us. Couple that with the start of a recession,\
  \ where advertising is among the first things to drop from a company's budget, and\
  \ you have a very difficult business indeed.</p>\n            <p>Now recall that\
  \ our intent for <em>Amazing Stories</em> was to make its money on the newsstand\
  \ and from advertising, and that we had the benefit of the <em>Star Wars Insider</em>\
  \ bipad to launch <em>Amazing</em>. Well, shortly before launch, we learned that\
  \ we had been misinformed about the bipad. We'd have been able to use the bipad\
  \ if <em>Insider</em> had ceased publication, but because it was simply going to\
  \ another publisher, the bipad had to go with it. That left us needing to spend\
  \ months upon months and thousands upon thousands of dollars to build up an unprofitable\
  \ newsstand presence from scratch, just so we could get circulation numbers high\
  \ enough to begin the daunting task of trying to attract advertisers that might\
  \ want to pay us. We hadn't yet realized it, but before our first issue even hit\
  \ the stands, the world's oldest sci-fi magazine's days were once again numbered.</p>\n\
  \            <p>So what about <em>Undefeated</em>, with its non-returnable hobby\
  \ sales revenue? We mentioned last month that if we could just get every game store\
  \ in the country to buy two copies, we'd be set. (And frankly, we probably could\
  \ have gotten by with just one copy per store.) But what we hadn't considered was\
  \ the low value proposition for hobby distributors. Hobby distributors make a percentage\
  \ of the retail price of everything they sell to their retailers. They have a limited\
  \ amount of time each month in direct contact with each retailer, though, and if\
  \ they have the choice between spending five minutes trying to get them to buy an\
  \ $80 trading card game display box or trying to get them to buy an $8 magazine,\
  \ well, the game makes them 10 times the money. After 10 issues, we realized that\
  \ we weren't going to get around that fact, and coupled with the lack of ad revenue,\
  \ we had to pull the plug on <em>Undefeated</em>.</p>\n            <div class=\"\

  \ <br>\n              Working with creative people in a high-stress environment\
  \ such as magazine publishing can lead to crazy and fun times. In 2004, a meme started\
  \ with photos of employees slapping Advertising Director Rob Stewart. Of course,\
  \ it was all choreographed. As time went on, the phony slaps became more and more\
  \ animated. Here are a number of pictures of folks doing \"The Slap\" on Rob. \n\

  \            <p>Lisa Stevens<br><em>CEO</em></p>\n            <h2>The Bulmahn Cometh</h2>\n\
  \            <p>2004 was a crazy year for me. I was working for an architectural\
  \ firm in Milwaukee while moonlighting with the RPGA as one of the Living Greyhawk\
  \ campaign directors. My duties included writing, editing, and approving adventures,\
  \ so I decided to try to get published in <em>Dungeon</em>, sending them an adventure\
  \ that was tied into Living Greyhawk. Erik and James liked the idea and published\
  \ \"Mad God's Key\" in <a href=\"/products/btpy7to0\"><em>Dungeon</em> #114</a>.</p>\n\
  \            <p>I had always wanted to work in the game industry, and with a publishing\
  \ credit under my belt and a few years’ experience working with Wizards, I decided\
  \ to shoot for the moon and applied for a job in Wizards of the Coast's R&amp;D\
  \ department. I was incredibly surprised when I made it all the way to the end of\
  \ the process, and in July, Wizards flew me out to Seattle for a face-to-face interview.\
  \ I knew the job at Wizards was a long shot, so it came as no real surprise when\
  \ they eventually offered the job to someone else.</p>\n            <p>But while\
  \ I was in town for the Wizards interview, I also paid a visit to Paizo, where Erik\
  \ hastily put me to work combing through the slush pile. As it turns out, while\
  \ Wizards was interviewing me, they were also interviewing <em>Dragon</em> editor\
  \ Matt Sernett for a different position, and when they hired Matt a few months later,\
  \ that left Paizo with a job opening. Erik dropped me an email to let me know that\
  \ Paizo was hiring, and just two weeks later, after a few quick calls and an interview,\
  \ I was driving out to Seattle. My first day of work was October 11.</p>\n     \
  \       <p>The whole time was rather surreal. I was incredibly excited to be working\
  \ on <em>Dragon</em>, a magazine I had been reading since I was a kid, but I didn't\
  \ know much about how magazines were put together. It was a steep learning curve,\
  \ but I had plenty of time in my life for work. I was living in a tiny place with\
  \ rented furniture until my belongings back in Milwaukee could be packed up and\
  \ shipped out to join me. I didn't know anyone other than my coworkers, so I didn't\
  \ have too many distractions. That said, I nearly quit and drove back to Milwaukee\
  \ just a few weeks later.</p>\n            <p>Everything had seemed to be going\
  \ fine. I was finally getting a handle on how the job worked when Erik came back\
  \ into the editorial pit and closed the door—and nobody <em>ever</em> closed that\
  \ door. He explained to everyone that Paizo was laying off a number of employees\
  \ and putting <em>Undefeated</em> and <em>Amazing Stories</em> on permanent hiatus.\
  \ I was shocked. I was worried that I had joined a company that was in danger, and\
  \ I'd left behind a good stable job to do it. Later that afternoon, I pulled Erik\
  \ aside and asked him if I should plan to move back to Milwaukee. After all, my\
  \ old lease wasn't even up, and I was pretty sure I could get my old job back. He\
  \ reassured me that <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> were doing great and that\
  \ I had nothing to worry about, but it took me a few more weeks to come to believe\
  \ that. Looking back, sticking with Paizo was the best decision I've ever made.</p>\n\
