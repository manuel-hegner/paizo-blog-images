  \ Swordsmen of Mars!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Saturday, September 20, 2008</p>\
  \ \n   <p>While pulp science-fiction magazines had entered a sort of digest-sized\
  \ hibernation by the early 1960s, the paperback book phenomenon was hitting with\
  \ full force, exposing readers to a new generation of writers while bringing many\
  \ of the old pulp classics of the past into book form for the very first time. The\
  \ celebrated Ace Doubles of the era presented many of the books we've already published\
  \ in our <a href=\"/planetStories\">Planet Stories</a> classic fantasy line, including\
  \ Leigh Brackett's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8f\"><i>The Secret of Sinharat</i></a>\
  \ and <i>People of the Talisman</i>, both of which first appeared in the original\
  \ <i>Planet Stories</i> magazine of the 1940s. Ace also republished many full book-length\
  \ tales, including this month's Planet Stories release, Otis Adelbert Kline's <a\
  \ href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"><i>The Swordsman of Mars</i></a>.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Kline's classic tale of swashbuckling and savage monsters in the deserts,\
  \ swamps, and jungles of Mars first appeared in 1933 as a 6-chapter weekly serial\
  \ in <i>Argosy Magazine</i>, the very pulp that had birthed the so-called \"sword\
  \ and planet\" genre with the publication of Edgar Rice Burroughs's <i>Under the\
  \ Moons of Mars</i> 21 years prior. Contemporary fans of Burrough's John Carter\
  \ of Mars and Carson of Venus tales often ranked Kline's planetary adventures as\
  \ equal or near-to-equal those penned by the master himself, but in the 75 years\
  \ since the original publication of <i>The Swordsman of Mars</i>, Kline's reputation\
  \ as an author has not fared quite as well as that of Edgar Rice Burroughs.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The tale's paperback publication came in 1960 from Ace, appearing alongside\
  \ such science-fiction classics as <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> by\
  \ Jules Verne, <i>The Isle of Doctor Moreau</i> by H. G. Wells, and <i>The Weapon\
  \ Shops of Isher</i> by A. E. Van Vogt. The boldly colored cover depicts a long-haired\
  \ John Carter clone and his damsel battling some Martians under the banner \"He\
  \ wore another man's body on the Red Planet\". Tucked away at the bottom of the\
  \ frame, near the left-hand corner, is the tiny legend \"Complete &amp; Unabridged.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>As with many early paperbacks, this latter claim is more complicated\
  \ than it appears. The 1960 Ace edition is an \"unabridged\" reprint of the 1960\
  \ <i>hardcover</i> edition of <i>The Swordsman of Mars</i> from a publisher called\
  \ Avalon, who reprinted all of Kline's sword and planet fiction starting in that\
  \ year. Rather than a celebration of Kline's important serial work, the '60s Avalon\
  \ editions are badly truncated rewrites. Entire chapters are missing, key character\
  \ and location descriptions are completely absent, and the final product cuts a\
  \ slash across the chest of Kline's literary reputation that would be totally invisible\
  \ to readers unable to assemble the original <i>Argosy</i> serial and compare the\
  \ two texts.</p> \n   <p>Happily, we at Planet Stories did just that when preparing\
  \ our manuscript for print, and the differences between the original and the \"\
  Complete &amp; Unabridged\" versions are staggering. Yes, the serial is much longer,\
  \ which is to be expected. But the changes made to <i>The Swordsman of Mars</i>\
  \ rob the story of a great deal of description, characterization, pacing, and background\
  \ that does no service to the original tale or the literary legacy of Otis Adelbert\
  \ Kline.</p> \n   <p>Take a look at the first chapter of <i>The Swordsman of Mars</i>,\
  \ first in its Ace paperback/Avalon edition, and then in the complete serial publication\
  \ used as the basis for our Planet Stories edition.</p> \n   <p>Here's the Ace version:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p> \n   </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PlanetStories/PZO8012-Paper_500.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PlanetStories/PZO8012-Paper_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\" align=\"\
  right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n  <blockquote>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Harry Thorne\
  \ opened his eyes and gazed about him with a startled expression. This was not the\
  \ tawdry hotel bedroom in which he had gone to sleep; it was a small room with bare,\
  \ concrete walls, a door of hardwood planking studded with bolts, and a barred window.\
  \ The only articles of furniture were the cot on which he was lying, a chair, and\
  \ a small table.</p> \n    <p><i>So the sleeping pills didn't finish me off</i>,\
  \ he thought. <i>Now I'm in jail for attempted suicide!</i></p> \n    <p>Thorne\
  \ sat up, then rose unsteadily to his feet and staggered to the window. Supporting\
  \ himself by gripping the thick iron bars, he peered out. It was broad daylight\
  \ and the sun was high in the heavens. Below him stretched a deep valley, through\
  \ which a narrow stream meandered. And as far as he could see in all directions\
  \ there were mountains, though the highest peaks were all below the level of his\
  \ own eyes.</p> \n    <p>He turned from the window at the sound of a key grating\
  \ in a lock. Then the heavy door swung inward, and a large man entered the cell,\
  \ bearing a tray of food and a steaming pot of coffee. Behind the man was a still\
  \ larger figure, whose very presence radiated authority. His forehead was high and\
  \ bulged outward over shaggy eyebrows that met above his aquiline nose. He wore\
  \ a pointed, closely cropped Vandyke, black with a slight sprinkling of gray, and\
  \ was dressed in faultlessly tailored evening clothes.</p> \n    <p>Thorne got to\
  \ his feet as his singular visitor closed the door behind him. Then, in a booming\
  \ bass, the man said, \"At last, Mr. Thorne, I have caught up with you. I am Dr.\
  \ Morgan.\" He smiled. \"And I might add, not a moment too soon. You gave us quite\
  \ a time—Boyd and I managed to get you out of that hotel room and down to the street,\
  \ passing you off as a drunk. Don't you remember a knocking at the door? You weren't\
  \ quite out when we came in.\"</p> \n    <p>Thorne thought for a moment, then nodded.\
  \ It seemed that there had been a pounding somewhere. \"How did you get in? I thought\
  \ I locked the door.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You did—but I had skeleton keys with me, just\
  \ in case. We took you to my apartment, treated you, and brought you out here.\"\
  \ Morgan nodded to Boyd, who left the room, then waved his hand invitingly toward\
  \ the tray. \"I ordered breakfast served in your room. I especially urge you to\
  \ try the coffee. It will counteract the effect of the sedatives I was compelled\
  \ to use in order to save your life to bring you here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You've gone\
  \ to a lot of trouble to save something I don't want,\" Thorne said. \"May I ask\
  \ why you are interfering in my affairs?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I need you,\" Morgan replied\
  \ simply. \"And I can offer you adventure such as only one other man of Earth has\
  \ known—possibly glory, possibly death. But if death, not the mean sort you were\
  \ seeking.\"</p> \n    <p>Harry Thorne frowned. \"You referred to a man of Earth\
  \ as if there were men not of Earth. Are you suggesting a trip to Mars?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Dr. Morgan laughed. \"Splendid, Mr. Thorne. But suppose you tackle breakfast.\
  \ It will put you in a better frame of mind for what I am going to tell you. I shall\
  \ not lock the door as I leave. When you have finished, join me in the drawing room—\
  at the end of the corridor to your right.\" He paused in the doorway. \"You mentioned\
  \ a trip to Mars, Mr. Thorne. Forgive me if I keep you in suspense for a time, but—\
  although it is not exactly what you think those words mean—that <i>is</i> what I\
  \ am going to propose.\"</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>So that's it. Quick, to\
  \ the point. Our hero is Harry Thorne. We don't know what he looks like, how he\
  \ came to be in this room, why he wanted to commit suicide, or really anything about\
  \ him other than his name. We've met the esteemed Doctor Morgan (the scientist who\
  \ ties together all of Kline's Mars and Venus serials), but we don't understand\
  \ why he would be interested in poor, old suicidal Harry Thorne. This introduction\
  \ is a serviceable stepping stone to the adventures to come, but it does little\
  \ to ground the reader's interest in the protagonist or foreshadow future events.</p>\

  \ the first section of the original serial, as it will appear in this month's Planet\
  \ Stories release:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p> \n    <p><b>A\
  \ VERY STRANGE VISITOR</b></p> \n    <p>\"Is Mr. McGinnis in?\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ girl who presided at the information desk and switchboard of the McGinnis Physical\
  \ Culture Institute suspended her gum chewing long enough to reply: \"I'll see.\
  \ What's the name?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thorne. Harry Thorne.\"</p> \n    <p>As she\
  \ connected the office phone of her employer, the girl surveyed the young man before\
  \ her with a look of approval. He was tall and slender, with wavy hair of a chestnut\
  \ brown shade, and there was a pantherish suppleness about his movements which hinted\
  \ of powerful muscles, perfectly controlled. His faultless attire and aristocratic\
  \ air told her that he was likely to prove a wealthy prospect for the services which\
  \ Mr. McGinnis had to offer, so she rang three times, a signal which her employer\
  \ would understand.</p> \n    <p>\"Mr. Harry Thorne to see you, sir.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>She nodded and smiled at the young man. \"You may go in, Mr. Thorne. The first\
  \ office at your right.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you.\" Thorne followed her directions,\
  \ and was welcomed at the door of the office by the beaming proprietor of the institution,\
  \ a middle-aged gentleman with bulging chest and biceps, a broken nose, and cauliflower\
  \ ears.</p> \n    <p>\"Come right in, Mr. Thorne. Take a chair. A wonderful frame\
  \ you have to put muscle on. Now with our system of training we guarantee to add\
  \ an inch to the circumference of your biceps in less than-⎯\"</p> \n    <p>\"One\
  \ moment, Mr. McGinnis. I came here to be built up, not physically, but financially.\
  \ In short, I am after that job you advertised in this morning's paper.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>McGinnis settled back, a look of disappointment on his face.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Oh, so you want a job as my assistant fencing master. Can you handle a foil?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Fencing has been a hobby of mine.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A hobby, eh? You'll\
  \ have to make it a profession if you work here. But come. I'll try you out.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>McGinnis led him down the hallway, and through a large room where a group\
  \ of perspiring financiers dressed in shorts and jerseys were going through various\
  \ contortions under the direction of a husky looking young man wearing a striped\
  \ sweater. A conspicuous majority of these striving athletes looked as if their\
  \ chests had slipped down beneath their belts, and the calves and biceps were undeveloped.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They passed through another room, where a number of corpulent gentlemen\
  \ were being mauled, poked, pinched, prodded and steam-cooked, and thence into a\
  \ small empty gymnasium.</p> \n    <p>McGinnis removed his coat and invited Thorne\
  \ to do likewise. Then he handled him plastron, mask, glove and foil, and both men\
  \ armed themselves.</p> \n    <p>\"Now, my lad,\" said McGinnis, when Thorne was\
  \ ready, \"we'll see what we'll see. On guard!\"</p> \n    <p>They saluted and engaged.\
  \ Before he had got fairly warmed up, McGinnis, much to his surprise, was hit. \"\
  Accidents will happen,\" he said. \"We'll try again.\"</p> \n    <p>They did, and\
  \ this time McGinnis was disarmed. The sudden realization of this made him quite\
  \ red in the face—he, a fencing master, disarmed by this amateur.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That was a coincidence,\" he said, as Thorne politely handed him his foil. \"We'll\
  \ try it once more.\"</p> \n    <p>Much to his astonishment and chagrin, the master\
  \ was hit in the fifth disengage. He threw down his foil and tore off his mask.\
  \ \"Enough's enough.\" He growled.</p> \n    <p>\"Do I get the job?\" asked Thorne.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Not in a thousand years, my boy. Do you think I'd be fool enough to\
  \ hire an assistant who can beat me? Don't slam the door as you go out.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Out on the street once more, Thorne fished his last fifty cent piece from\
  \ his pocket and bought an early edition of an afternoon paper. Pocketing his change,\
  \ he retired to a doorway to scan the \"Help Wanted\" column.</p> \n    <p>Evening\
  \ found him still tramping, after having followed five more fruitless leads. He\
  \ fingered the change in his pocket reflectively. Not enough for a decent meal,\
  \ but if husbanded carefully it would keep body and soul together for the next two\
  \ or three days. He expended five cents on coffee and doughnuts, his first meal\
  \ of the day. Then he returned to the cheap hotel where he had taken lodging and\
  \ where his room rent, which had been paid in advance, would expire on the morrow.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As the clerk handed him his key, he said: \"A gentleman called to see\
  \ you, Mr. Thorne. Said he'd be back later.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A gentleman to see\
  \ me! That's strange. Did he leave any message?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Only that he'd\
  \ be back later.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thanks.\"</p> \n    <p>Thorne climbed the creaky\
  \ stairs with their covering of dusty, moth-eaten carpet, and entered his room.\
  \ Shortly thereafter, in dressing gown and slippers and with his pipe going, he\
  \ sat down in his creaky rocker, vintage of 1880, to think out the situation in\
  \ which he found himself. He had already pawned his watch and ring, and the money\
  \ was all but gone. The dressing gown would be next, he decided. Then his reverie\
  \ was interrupted by a knock at the door.</p> \n    <p>\"Come in,\" he said, wearily.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He looked up curiously as the door opened, then suppressed a gasp of\
  \ amazement at sight of the striking individual who entered. His visitor, almost\
  \ a giant in stature, was obviously a tremendously powerful man. But the impression\
  \ of great physical strength which the stranger's physique induced was overshadowed\
  \ by the promise of inconceivably greater mental force which shone from his face.\
  \ His forehead was high and bulged outward over shaggy eyebrows that met above his\
  \ aquiline nose. His piercing black eyes seemed to look through Thorne's own, and\
  \ into his very brain. He wore a pointed, closely-cropped Vandyke, black with a\
  \ slight sprinkling of gray hairs, and was dressed in faultlessly tailored evening\
  \ clothes.</p> \n    <p>Thorne got to his feet as his singular visitor closed the\
  \ door behind him. Then, in a booming bass voice, the big man said: \"At last, Mr.\
  \ Thorne, I have caught up with you. I am Dr. Morgan.\"</p> \n    <p>Surprised,\
  \ Thorne took the proffered hand and muttered an acknowledgement. \"Take the chair,\
  \ doctor,\" he invited. \"I'll sit here on the bed.\" As his visitor complied, he\
  \ continued: \"You say you have caught up with me. Am I to understand from this\
  \ that you have been following me?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Halfway across the world and\
  \ back again,\" was the reply. \"I first saw your photograph in a local paper, accompanying\
  \ an article which told of your hunting expedition in British East Africa. I followed\
  \ you there, only to learn that you had sailed there days before my arrival.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You saw my picture and followed me there? Why?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll\
  \ come to that presently. When I reached New York, I called your father's home in\
  \ Long Island. I was advised that you had left, and that no one knew of your whereabouts.\
  \ After that, it was not easy to trace you. I learned that you had sailed for home\
  \ sooner than you planned, because of a wire from your father. I also discovered\
  \ that on your return, you and your father had quarreled, and that as a result you\
  \ were disowned and disinherited.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You seem to have taken a remarkably\
  \ keen interest in my affairs,\" said Thorne, amazed at the intimate details of\
  \ his private business with which this strange individual was familiar.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Exactly. And I presume you have seen the evening paper.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Only the 'Help Wanted' columns.\"</p> \n    <p>\"In that case,\" said the doctor,\
  \ \"you missed some news which will be of interest to you.\" He took a clipping\
  \ from his pocket and passed it to Thorne.</p> \n    <p>With a shock that turned\
  \ him suddenly pale beneath his coat of tan, he read:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p align=\"center\">FIANCÉE OF HARRY THORNE ELOPES WITH OTHER MAN</p> \n \
  \    <p>Sylvia Thompson, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Horatio Thompson, of Newport,\
  \ whose engagement to Harry Thorne, scion of the wealthy Long Island family, was\
  \ recently announced, has eloped with Herbert Lloyd Vandevetter.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>There were details, but Thorne did not read these. Instead, he looked\
  \ at the pictures of his lovely fiancée, his best friend, and himself, conspicuously\
  \ displayed beside the article. Then the page blurred and he turned away. A great\
  \ sorrow gripped his heart. Sylvia Thompson was the one person in whom he had not\
  \ lost faith. Before leaving for Chicago he had confided in her, had told her that\
  \ he was penniless, and must seek out a new means of livelihood before they could\
  \ be married. She had promised to wait. And now—this!</p> \n    <p>\"She was false—\
  a cheat, a fraud!\" he said, bitterly. \"I'll never believe any woman again. I'll\
  \ never believe anybody.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Steady boy,\" admonished the doctor. \"\
  You're taking a lot of territory.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I mean it,\" said Thorne. \"\
  I—I don't care to live any longer.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Suppose you were offered a new\
  \ interest in life. Excitement and adventures beyond your wildest dreams. A chance\
  \ to view new scenes that no earthly being save one has ever glimpsed. To meet new\
  \ and strange peoples.\"</p> \n    <p>\"All that is old stuff to me,\" replied Thorne.\
  \ \"I've traveled until I'm sick of it. I've hunted big game in Asia, Africa and\
  \ the Americas. I've been in every important country on the globe. The only adventure\
  \ I have not tried is death, and just now it is the one adventure that intrigues\
  \ me.\"</p> \n    <p>He got up suddenly, and stepping to where his suitcase lay\
  \ open on the grip-rack, drew therefrom a .38 caliber pistol. \"I don't know why\
  \ you've come here, doctor,\" he said, \"and I don't much care. But I'll appreciate\
  \ the favor if you will notify my fond relatives of my demise. I don't like being\
  \ messy, and I haven't the slightest desire to be dramatic, so I'll go into the\
  \ bathroom for the last act.\"</p> \n    <p>\"One moment, before you go,\" said\
  \ the doctor. \"Do you realize that if you do this deed while I am present you will\
  \ implicate me as a murderer?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Right. I hadn't thought of that.\
  \ Sorry. I'll say good-by then, and give you time to get away.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ doctor rose. \"That's considerate of you my boy, and I'll be glad to notify your\
  \ relatives for you. Good-by.\" He held out his hand.</p> \n    <p>Thorne listlessly\
  \ grasped the extended hand. As he did so, he felt a sharp pricking sensation in\
  \ his palm, followed by a numbness which shot up his arm and traveled rapidly through\
  \ the rest of his body. The gun, which he had been holding in his left hand, clattered\
  \ to the floor. A moment later things went black before his eyes. His knees buckled\
  \ under him, and the doctor, catching him beneath the arms, eased him back upon\
  \ the bed. Then consciousness left him.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>The original\
  \ Kline text reveals his hero to be a weary world traveler, an adventurer of impeccable\
  \ swordsmanship and an aristocratic background (all of which will serve him well\
  \ on the Red Planet). We have a fitting physical description for the ideal sword\
  \ and planet hero, and we have a tragic love story that explains Harry Thorne's\
  \ self-destructive impulse and the motivation that will eventually send him to Mars.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Otis Adelbert Kline died 14 years prior to the publication of Avalon's\
  \ <i>The Swordsman of Mars</i> hit the shelves. Whoever wrote the short version,\
  \ it wasn't the original author, and the merciless cuts did little to help Kline's\
  \ literary reputation. No less an authority than <i>The Encyclopedia of Science\
  \ Fiction</i> calls Kline's work \"pulp fiction at its worst.\" But these analyses,\
  \ indeed most modern perception of Kline's fantasy output, is based not on the original\
  \ pulp printing, but on posthumous editorial hack-jobs perpetrated long after the\
  \ author himself had died.</p> \n   <p>Now, for the first time in 75 years, Planet\
