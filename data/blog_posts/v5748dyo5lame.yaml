  \    <p>It's an exciting time around here at Paizo. With all the hustle and bustle,\
  \ if you've seen me on the boards at all, it's probably been commenting on Pathfinder\
  \ fiction—how it's spooling up now, how some of the authors signing on are blowing\
  \ my mind, and how we plan to manage things so that both the novel line and the\
  \ gaming lines can flourish without breaking the world. (If you're curious, it's\
  \ also the subject of the editorial in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/v5748btpy87dd\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #29</a>.) Yet in all this discussion of the Pathfinder fiction\
  \ that's coming, it suddenly came to my attention that it had been a while since\
  \ I'd talked about the amazing fiction we already <i>have</i>.</p> \n    <p>If you've\
  \ been reading Council of Thieves, I don't have to tell you that Dave Gross is one\
  \ of the most talented authors we've had the pleasure of working with on Pathfinder\
  \ fiction. But I can tell you, having just finished the final chapter of \"Hell's\
  \ Pawns\"—the noir-fantasy Pathfinder's Journal in which the tiefling Radovan and\
  \ half-elven Pathfinder Varian Jeggare hunt a murderer through the upper echelons\
  \ of Cheliax's corrupt nobility—that Dave has something few fantasy authors in any\
  \ world achieve: Weight. Gravitas. An honest, emotional connection to characters,\
  \ not just the world they live in. It's what we've always striven for with Pathfinder\
  \ fiction, and there can be no question that Dave delivers—along with plenty of\
  \ murder, intrigue, and gangsters both official and amateur.</p> \n    <p>But I\
  \ won't get into spoiler territory. Instead, I'd rather give you all a sample of\
  \ what I'm talking about, a snippet from the beginning of the story, in <a href=\"\
  \ /store/v5748btpy89a4\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #25</a>:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n  \
  \   <p>On the scaffold, a knobby-kneed herald emerges from behind the canvas. He\
  \ looks to either side, shuddering with exaggerated fear when the guards eye him\
  \ up and down. The groundlings laugh, recognizing him as one of the Fools of Thrune,\
  \ a jester from House Sarini sent out to amuse them while they wait. I lose interest\
  \ the moment he raises a trumpet to his lips and blows out a length of crimson silk\
  \ and a pair of sagging pillows meant to suggest he's blown his lungs out through\
  \ the horn.</p> \n     <p>I see plenty of familiar mugs among the groundlings: stevedores,\
  \ stable hands, street sweepers, barmaids, a seamstress I once gave a memorable\
  \ night on the Bunyip Dock. A pickpocket I know tips me a wink as he pats a mark\
  \ on the shoulder while his adolescent accomplice dips his hand in on the other\
  \ side. A few others touch their chins or smile when they see me. I nod back.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>No one from the stands throws me a greeting, but more than a few know\
  \ me better than they'd admit. I know several of them better than I'd like their\
  \ husbands to know, but to most I am only the silent bodyguard of Count Varian Jeggare.\
  \ The only one among them bold enough to return my gaze is Ivo Elliendo.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The Paralictor glides out of the stands where he has been receiving the\
  \ compliments of the ladies. His tall figure stands out like a plow cutting through\
  \ a garden. The sharp red scourges on the ribs of his black leather jack give him\
  \ a gaunt silhouette.</p> \n     <p>He squints when he spots me, and I can feel\
  \ his scorn hot on my face. What else can I do but shoot him my toothiest smile?\
  \ All around him, ladies who had followed his gaze snap up their fans to shield\
  \ themselves from the sight of a mouth that I'm told looks like a drawer full of\
  \ knives. The commotion distracts Elliendo, and when he sees he is surrounded by\
  \ a halo of fluttering fans, his lined face darkens.</p> \n     <p>Elliendo stalks\
  \ away from the stands and mounts the stairs, followed as usual by two hulking Hellknights.\
  \ I begin to frame a prayer for rotting steps before deciding that's too much to\
  \ ask, even on Judgment Day. On the scaffold, Elliendo peers north at the approach\
  \ of the golden Royal Carriage down the Imperial Promenade. He snaps his fingers,\
  \ and the clown retreats behind the canvas to a clatter of applause. Once the carriage\
  \ halts and the window shades rise just enough for the occupant—no doubt some minor\
  \ Palace official, rather than the Queen herself—to peer out, the canvas on the\
  \ scaffold falls away to reveal the Instruments of Judgment.</p> \n     <p>In the\
  \ center is a blazing furnace in the shape of a three-faced devil. From each of\
  \ its gaping jaws jut a bramble of iron implements: knives, spears, chains, rods,\
  \ brands, and most conspicuous of all the Tines of Cheliax. Each is a two-pronged\
  \ fork sized for a stone giant, and today there are two of them.</p> \n     <p>Arrayed\
  \ between the furnaces are racks of torture devices retrieved from every civilized\
  \ nation on Golarion, and several not so civilized. The spiked cages of Geb are\
  \ a crowd favorite, and two of them already hold prisoners. One is a fat man who\
  \ begins screaming the moment he is revealed, while the other is pock-faced Gellius\
  \ Bonner, the Butcher of Merrow Lane.</p> \n     <p>I fell into the Bonner case\
  \ when the boss sent me to nose around the tannery across the river. I was supposed\
  \ to catch a stable master selling the carcasses of his lady's mysteriously sickened\
  \ horses. That went nowhere, but I spied the tanner sneaking out of his own home\
  \ well past midnight. Curious, I followed him into town, expecting to discover nothing\
  \ more than a mistress in some Cheapside flat. Instead, he led me to Bonner's shop,\
  \ where he joined six men wearing crude robes. Bonner greeted them with some fiendish\
  \ phrase, though I could understand only a few words before he led them downstairs.\
  \ I let myself in for a peek. When I saw the yak-headed thing Bonner conjured and\
  \ what they intended to offer it, I ran to Greensteeples and beat on the boss's\
  \ door until his sleepy halfling butler woke him. With a few questions, Jeggare\
  \ confirmed that the cult was demonic, not diabolic, so he sent a message directly\
  \ to the Temple of Asmodeus, who in turn asked the Hellknights to capture the cultists,\
  \ minus a few who resisted arrest. They even recovered two boys who had not yet\
  \ been devoured.</p> \n     <p>The discovery broke the cases of more than a dozen\
  \ missing children, disappearances that Elliendo had publicly sworn to solve. As\
  \ he was not on duty that night, he was surprised to hear the criers' announcement\
  \ of another mystery solved by the celebrated Varian Jeggare.</p> \n     <p>If it\
  \ were for the murders alone, Bonner might have met his Judgment at the edge of\
  \ an axe or, if it were only one or two killings, in hard labor for a decade. The\
  \ devil-worshiping lords of Cheliax, however, do not suffer the denizens of the\
  \ Abyss in the city. For consorting with demons, Bonner earned his special voyage\
  \ to Hell.</p> \n     <p>While not an admirer of the spectacle, I make a point of\
  \ witnessing the Judgment of anyone convicted on one of our cases. This time, the\
  \ boss insisted that I bring something to confirm it was Bonner and not some magic-masked\
  \ substitute who did the dance of the Tines. He sent me to the Plaza of Flowers\
  \ with a couple of sakava leaves plucked fresh from a plant in his greenhouse.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Once the Instruments are unveiled, four proper heralds stand on the\
  \ corners of the scaffold and announce the list of Judgments. Behind them, brawny\
  \ shirtless men in red hoods prepare the braces for the Tines.</p> \n     <p>When\
  \ a couple of the big men unlock Bonner's cage, I slip the sakava leaves from a\
  \ sleeve pocket. The size of my thumbs, they are thick green ovals with tiny white\
  \ hairs glistening with oil. Just before I crush them, someone calls my name.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She is taller than me, which is not too uncommon, but most of that height\
  \ comes from a pair of legs snugged in black calfskin trousers with tiny stars and\
  \ suns cut out along the outer seam to reveal bare skin. Her blouse hangs loose\
  \ except in just the right places to make a celibate throw himself off the roof.\
  \ Her big hazel eyes are too far apart with heavy eyebrows, but they look fine above\
  \ a long nose pierced above one nostril with a tiny ruby. The stone sets off a hint\
  \ of late-summer red in her brown hair.</p> \n     <p>I'm staring at her over the\
  \ little green leaves.</p> \n     <p> \"Are you Radovan?\" she asks again. I could\
  \ listen to her say my name all day, but then she ruins it by adding, \"Count Jeggare's\
  \ servant?\"</p> \n     <p> \"His bodyguard.\" Immediately I think of three or four\
  \ suave answers.</p> \n     <p> \"My messages to Greensteeples have gone unanswered,\
  \ and I require the count's assistance,\" she says. \"And naturally his utmost discretion.\"\
  </p> \n     <p> \"Naturally,\" I say, but before I can give her the pitch, I feel\
  \ a sharp poke just below my shoulder blade. </p> \n     <p> \"Say goodbye to the\
  \ girly, copper-tongue,\" reeks a voice inches beneath my ear. I know who it is\
  \ from the stench of garlic and boiled eggs. </p> \n     <p> \"Not now, Ursio.\"\
  \ I try to sound casual, but the scratch he gave me starts to itch. Out of the corners\
  \ of my eyes I see a couple of shapes that must be his backup. \"I'll stay in this\
  \ very public place while you and your playmates go climb your thumbs.\" </p> \n\
  \     <p> \"These bolts are tipped with black lotus venom,\" says Ursio, and I know\
  \ it's his treasured hand crossbow with its steel \"fangs\" jammed into my back.\
  \ \"You'll be dead before your body hits the street.\" </p> \n     <p>It seems unlikely\
  \ that Ursio has acquired the deadly and expensive poison, but on the scaffold I\
  \ see the hooded men dragging Bonner to a table, where a third man awaits with a\
  \ pair of curved knives held high for the crowd's acclaim...</p> \n    </blockquote>\
