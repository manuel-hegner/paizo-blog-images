  \ report from the Order of the Amber Die after their experience with <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9dz6\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #94: Ice Tomb of the Giant Queen</a>\
  \ and those guys are still alive! (Mostly.) Remember, this blog is full of spoilers\
  \ for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/Giantslayer\">Giantslayer Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, so read at your own risk! And now I turn this blog over to the Order\
  \ of the Amber Die.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Order of the Amber Die is back\
  \ with the fourth update on our ambitious endeavor to complete Giantslayer in just\
  \ 6 months!</p> \n     <p>The party found itself in bad shape following the third\
  \ marathon session, and we knew that this could very well be our last report—so\
  \ if it was, we needed to go out knowing we had given ourselves every best chance\
  \ to succeed. First, to encourage cohesion, we chose to play with only the four\
  \ main players present for this marathon, no live NPCs, and our GM played the role\
  \ of Kurst Grath as would normally happen in most groups. Second, even though we\
  \ are spread across the east coast, an emergency player meeting was called via Skype\
  \ to try and figure out what needed to be done to turn things around in-game. The\
  \ conference was complete with an agenda and new approach to utilizing our ACG hybrid\
  \ classes to better effect in combat. Lastly, with permission from reluctant elders\
  \ of our GM's family, we returned to the sacred birthplace of our Order and played\
  \ this marathon in the room where it all began in '87.</p> \n     <p>This 83-hour\
  \ marathon was also record setting for the RPG community, as one of our members\
  \ and our GM both surpassed 500 documented session hours of Pathfinder in a single\
  \ year (GMed and played respectively). According to our research and to the best\
  \ of our knowledge, this is the new world record!</p> \n     <p>For this adventure\
  \ we were headed well above the snow line in the Mindspin Mountains, so to better\
  \ immerse ourselves we looked for wintry effects. The obvious was the thermostat,\
  \ and it was set low enough to feel like December in the peaks. We also purchased\
  \ plenty of polymer snow to go 3 inches deep around our play area. For glacial winds,\
  \ we fired up fans that kept most of us wearing our long sleeve uniforms and winter\
  \ hats at times—despite being late June in NJ.</p> \n     <h2>Highlights From our\
  \ Experience With Ice Tomb of the Giant Queen</h2> \n     <ul>\n      <li>As the\
  \ giants in the training camp of Skirgaard were too numerous to count, we had to\
  \ resort to repeated guerrilla actions to disband the camp. Much of the weekend\
  \ was spent planning raids on a unique 20\" x 30\" isomorphic map of Skirgaard.\
  \ Thanks to author Jim Groves for his support with this!</li> \n      <li>We made\
  \ another powerful ally in Naximarra, the majestic and yet terrifying red dragon\
  \ of an ancient bloodline. We'll never forget her first appearance, with the dragon's\
  \ head rising from the snow just five feet away from us—but she didn't breathe.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Pumped up to fight big Vikings, we rocked out to Led Zeppelin's \"\
  Immigrant Song\" and \"No Quarter\" while putting up a body count that now totals\
  \ 57 giants slain throughout the AP.</li> \n      <li>An aerial duel over boiling\
  \ vats began while confronting Rohkinirr, a frost giant witch and accomplished brewmaster.\
  \ Quinn chased the witch around the brewery in a vicious dogfight, firing off inspiration\
  \ points to activate his studied combat twice per round. The investigator eventually\
  \ found an opening and drove home his longspear, plunging the giant to a gruesome\
  \ death in a vat of his own ale.</li> \n      <li>The Amber Die itself was alive\
  \ and well, delivering 6 natural 20s throughout the weekend, and of course: a signature\
  \ 20-20.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20150712-Photo3.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <p>While camped in deep\
  \ snow, the party's night watch team heard something very large in the darkness\
  \ beyond their sight. Coming into view was a 20-foot tall undead giant known as\
  \ an indarugant, which strode from the pages of the Pathfinder #94 bestiary directly\
  \ into our camp, determined to make a strong debut on Golarion. It dropped two PCs\
  \ in one round with its frozen axe, and left another near death. Kurst Grath never\
  \ rose from the hit, and the ranger would remain under gentle repose for the rest\
  \ of the adventure.</p> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <p>We had an incredible\
  \ performance, with our shortest completion time and fewest character deaths of\
  \ any module in Giantslayer thus far. Skirkatla the undead queen was laid low, a\
  \ giant training camp dispersed, and our ACG classes kicked into high gear. Our\
  \ reforms worked, we made the semi-finals of this AP, and we can now take some small\
  \ measure of inspiration from Churchill into the last two adventures:</p> \n   \
  \  <p><i>\"If the Order of the Amber Die and its members last for a thousand years,\
  \ adventurers will still say, 'This, was their finest hour!'\"</i></p> \n     <h2>Best\
  \ Quote From Marathon 4</h2> \n     <p>Sterling (Crowe): <i>\"I actually feel sick\
  \ to my stomach right now.\"</i> (with a TPK looming in the final battle)</p> \n\
