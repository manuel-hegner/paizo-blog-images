  \     <blockquote> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p itemprop=\"description\">A teenage\
  \ human clears red and yellow leaves from the roof before he collapses down with\
  \ an exaggerated groan next to a girl on a checkered picnic blanket.</p> \n    \
  \   <p>“Good afternoon to you too, Sab,” the girl says as she tosses him an apple\
  \ from a small basket and smoothes her skirt out. “I take it the make-up practical\
  \ went well.”</p> \n       <p>“Couldn’t remember which theorem applied to the second\
  \ law of alchemical stabilization, so I guessed at the reagents and the whole thing\
  \ bubbled over. Professor was furious.”</p> \n       <p>“Better that than an explosion\
  \ of stinking gas, which is what happened to Paisley last week. They tried to ask\
  \ the Cheater Ghost for help and it ended up telling them to add a ludicrous amount\
  \ of sulfur.” </p> \n       <p>“Oh?! Did it!?! I’ll add it to the ghost list!” Sab\
  \ pulls out a piece of parchment covered in a patchwork of barely legible scrawl,\
  \ neat cursive, and stylized angular letters, making some notes next to an enormous\
  \ “DACILANE MYSTERIES!!! HAUNTED LAB??? CURSED BEAKERS??? MALEVOLENT SINK?!?” Beaming,\
  \ he turns back to his friend, “Ayen! Maybe the ghost used to be a devil!”</p> \n\
  \       <p>“That makes absolutely no sense, Sab.” Ayen puts a bottle of tea in the\
  \ center of a stone tile and breathes out a fine stream of flame to heat it as she\
  \ watches students run around the track in the yard below. “It’s probably just echos\
  \ coming through from the nearby classroom. Besides, a devil isn’t a mortal so it’\
  d have to—Oh look, Voxi’s taking his shot!”</p> \n       <p>Sab rushes to the edge\
  \ of the rooftop to see his friend waiting nervously under the massive maple tree\
  \ in the corner of the schoolyard, a basket of heart-shaped cookies in hand. Ayen\
  \ continues, “He’s been wanting to ask Liro to the Winter Week festival all month.”\
  </p> \n       <p>“Oh no, he’s in for a rude surprise—Liro’s transferring out soon.\
  \ His mom’s going on a Pathfinder mission to Orcland and the family is moving for\
  \ a bit. He won’t be back to the Academy till next spring at the earliest.” Sab\
  \ sighs. “I hope they at least have time to catch the opening of the festival.”\
  </p> \n       <p>“Belkzen, you mean,” Ayen corrects, pushing the picnic basket closer\
  \ with her tail so she can retrieve two mugs for the tea and filling them both.\
  \ “Father says there’s some sort of diplomatic thing going on with the Burning Sun\
  \ hold. I can’t wait to hear all about it when Liro is back.”</p> \n       <p>“\
  Must be nice, traveling around like that. We’ll have to catch the academy ghost\
  \ by the time he’s back!” Ayen rolls her eyes at another mention of ghosts as a\
  \ bell rings throughout the courtyard, signaling the end of lunch.</p> \n      \
  \ <p>The two friends gather their things as they leave the roof. “I still think\
  \ you’re just seeing excitement where you want to see it, but I spoke with the headmaster\
  \ anyway. She’s going to reach out to J Dacilane himself to see if the Society’\
  s willing to do a ghost inspection, so we should finish up our report. Maybe we’\
  ll even get some extra credit!”</p> \n       <p>“Honestly, after that disaster of\
  \ a practical, I could use it.”</p> \n       <p>The pair disappears into the stairwell,\
  \ arguing good-naturedly about whether the academy is or is not haunted, possibly\
  \ with a negotiation of how many Winter Week treats one will have to buy the other\
  \ if they’re wrong. In the now-empty courtyard below, leaves fall, and laughter\
  \ echoes.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \

  \ \n      <p>This month, we have our last two scenarios of 2020! In Absalom, we\
  \ have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026i7?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-209-The-Seven-Secrets-of-Dacilane-Academy\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-09: The Seven Secrets of Dacilane Academy</em></a>,\
  \ by Rigby Bendele. This level 1–4 adventure has the PCs investigating the school\
  \ legends of Dacilane Academy to determine if student reports on strange activity\
  \ are due to simple imagination or paranormal activity. On the other side of the\
  \ Inner Sea, Steven Hammond has a level 5–8 adventure for us with with <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq026i8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-210-In-Burning-Dawn\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-10: In Burning Dawn</em></a>. As the PCs head\
  \ to Belkzen for a diplomatic mission with the Burning Sun hold, they’ll need sharp\
  \ wits—and, given the area’s dangerous nature, likely sharp blades as well.</p>\
