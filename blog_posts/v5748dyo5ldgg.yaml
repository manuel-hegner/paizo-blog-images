  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Of Sins and Saviors</h1> \n   <p\
  \ class=\"date\">Friday, May 18, 2012</p> \n   <p>There's something really cool\
  \ about the fifth volume of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, Stephen S. Greer's “Sins of the Saviors.” After venturing\
  \ through volumes loosely themed around goblins, ghouls, ogres, and giants, this\
  \ fifth installment kicks the campaign backstory into high gear, with the player\
  \ characters exploring a vast dungeon known as the Runeforge, a relic from the era\
  \ of the ancient Runelords themselves.</p> \n   <p>In fact, during their adventure\
  \ in the Runeforge, the PCs even get a chance to meet with survivors from that distant\
  \ era, making this adventure an important pivot point for the campaign, essentially\
  \ shifting things into the endgame to come in the final sixth volume.</p> \n   <p>What\
  \ that means in a practical sense, especially because the PCs are now 12th level\
  \ themselves, is that they finally get to face off against some pretty kick-ass\
  \ bad guys who pack a powerful punch. In this week's blog, I'd like to reveal two\
  \ of those bad guys. While they don't quite qualify as the Big Bads of the adventure\
  \ (we'll get to them next week), these guys play key roles in important encounters,\
  \ and are sure to be remembered by your players for a long time to come.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Coincidentally, both also make excellent player character miniatures themselves!</p>\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120518-Warrior_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>First up is the Warrior of Wrath, the result of centuries of\
  \ genetic breeding and intense training in the Halls of Wrath, one of the most challenging\
  \ of the seven sinful sub-dungeons of the Runeforge. These angry eldritch knights\
  \ are the last of their long line, so it's a good thing the player characters show\
  \ up to give them a target upon which to vent their rage and aggression! Because\
  \ you'll need at least 6 Warriors of Wrath to pull off their encounter, we've slotted\
  \ this figure in the common rarity.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120518-Vraxeris.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120518-Vraxeris_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Wrath isn't the only sin to get a sub-dungeon\
  \ in the Runeforge. In the Shimmering Veils, pride is the sin that rules that day,\
  \ and perhaps none in all of Golarion are so prideful as the illusionist Vraxeris,\
  \ once among the most trusted servitors of Xanderghul, Runelords of Pride. Through\
  \ cunning and the mastery of cloning techniques, Vraxeris has managed to survive\
  \ in the thousands of years since the fall of the Runelords' ancient empire. Now,\
  \ his mad simulacra wander the halls of the Shimmering Veils, eager to defeat intruders\
  \ and certain that they have what it takes to keep their weird dungeon free from\
  \ interlopers. Vraxeris is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n   <p>We're nearing\
  \ the end of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> Pathfinder\
  \ Battles set (though a few super-awesome figures still remain to be revealed!),\
  \ so I'm slowing things down a bit here in the blog, and plan to show only two figures\
  \ a week from here forward. My head is already in the NEXT set, about half of which\
  \ will be showing up at the Paizo offices later this afternoon for final sculpt\
  \ approval. </p> \n   <p>The actual final production figures for Rise of the Runelords\
  \ have started rolling into my office, and I'm pleased to report that the figures\
  \ match the paint masters with amazing fidelity. Looking at these little pictures\
  \ on the blog and holding the actual minis in-hand simply don't compare. I can say\
  \ with honesty that I think the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ Pathfinder Battles set will be the best and most consistently awesome set of prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures released yet for hobby gaming.</p> \n   <p>Until we put out\
  \ the next set, that is!</p> \n   <p>See you next Friday,</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br>\
