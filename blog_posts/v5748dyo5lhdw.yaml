  \ by Liz Courts</em>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up until recently, the people who are\
  \ behind the curtain, looking at flagged posts, responding to your emails, and peeking\
  \ through tweets and Facebook comments have been doing so in addition to their regular\
  \ day-to-day tasksâ€”including getting products out the door, providing the best Customer\
  \ Service possible, and working on integral parts of paizo.com and within the company.\
  \ This kind of tactic has been challenging, and as our community has grown, we've\
  \ recognized it's been changing and has different/new needs. Because of all that,\
  \ it's become a real necessity for us to change as well.</p> \n    <p>We had to\
  \ find someone who fit the role of Community Manager and also had an intimate knowledge\
  \ and investment in our own community. Liz Courts is someone who has been invaluable\
  \ to our community over the years. She's a presence that's been around on paizo.com\
  \ for nearly as long as we've had forums, has been greeting newcomers with cookies,\
  \ has worked and laid groundwork for the fan magazine, <a href=\"//paizo.com/companies/paizoFansUnited\"\
  ><em>Wayfinder</em></a>, and helped shape what <a href=\"//paizo.com/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a> has become today. And, I'm excited to announce that she's been moved\
  \ to this position officially as of a few weeks ago!</p> \n    <p>As Community Manager,\
  \ Liz will be on the front lines for forum issues, reaching out through our social\
  \ media outlets, and coming up with new ideas for us to better communicate with\
  \ you guys. She'll also be be working on not-yet-announced projects and initiatives\
  \ for the community. Having someone who is as deeply passionate about gaming and\
  \ the gaming community is a great opportunity for pushing us forward.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>There's also another change that goes in hand with Liz's new role. Though you\
  \ mostly see me posting \"out of character\" on our forums when things get hairy,\
  \ I've also been creating and maintaining our digital products, generating and scheduling\
  \ website content, and providing an array of customer-facing and internal support.\
  \ Now, in order to assist and enable Liz to do awesome things for you guys, herd\
  \ more cats related to all of the content on paizo.com, and guide our overall community\
  \ policies and goals, I've been made into Paizo's Community &amp; Digital Content\
  \ Director.</p> \n    <p>These changes are brand new to Paizo, and our goal as the\
  \ new \"Community Team\" is to make sure you feel like you're being heard and supported.\
  \ We have come up with some really exciting things in these first few weeks (<a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhd0?The-Tax-Man-Cometh\">which we've\
  \ only just begun</a>), and I'm so, so excited for you all to start seeing the results!</p>\
