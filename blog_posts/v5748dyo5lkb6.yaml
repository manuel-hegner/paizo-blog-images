  >Mega-Regions</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Back in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk7r?That-Cantina-Feel\"\
  >mid-October</a>, Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman gave a sneak peak\
  \ into <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><em>Starfinder Alien\
  \ Archive</em></a> and the organized play team's plans to introduce more alien species\
  \ as player character options. We put our heads together and developed the Mega-Region\
  \ plan!</p> \n    <p>Over the past weeks, we worked on implementing our idea, writing\
  \ boons, developing regions, and identifying upcoming conventions running Starfinder\
  \ Society. The only thing left is to announce the regions to our community. Please\
  \ note, the Mega-Region is only a unit of accounting. It doesn't change anything\
  \ about how our organized play volunteers are structured or the Regional Support\
  \ programs. The first iteration of this plan will start with conventions this weekend.\
  \ Sometime in March or April, we will rotate the boons around, so that each region\
  \ has new rewards for their GMs. Future rotations will occur on roughly a 3-month\
  \ timeframe, so that each region will get all the boons over the course of a year.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Mega-Regions Divisions</h3> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Mega-Region 1—Africa-East\
  \ Eurasia (AEE) and Asia-Pacific</li> \n     <li>\LMega-Region 2—Central Europe,\
  \ Northwest, and Southeast</li> \n     <li>Mega-Region 3—Western Europe Middle East\
  \ (WEME), Northeast, and Southwest</li> \n     <li>Mega-Region4—Midwest and Great\
  \ Lakes</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>But a list of regions is bland, without the races\
  \ to accompany them. So without further ado, here's the news you need to start planning\
  \ trips around the globe:</p> \n    <h3>Mega-Region Starting Boons</h3> \n    <ul>\n\
  \     <li>Mega-Region 1: Kalo &amp; Verthani</li> \n     <li>Mega-Region 2: Draelik\
  \ &amp; Witchwyrd</li> \n     <li>Mega-Region 3: Maraquoi &amp; Nuar</li> \n   \
  \  <li>Mega-Region 4: Formian &amp; Ikeshti</li>\n    </ul> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ \n     <p><i>Illustrations by David Franco Campos, Connor Sheehan, Matthias Kinnigkeit,\
  \ and Pixoloid Studios</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>When deciding how to handle\
  \ the regions, we were left with our newest region, Online, as a bit of an oddity,\
  \ as it encompasses all the physical regions. After putting their heads together,\
  \ Thurston and John came up with a solution. Instead of being part of the rotation,\
  \ they would get their own racial boons from a source other than the <em>Alien Archive</em>.\
  \ In Thurston's words, \"The online region gets something unique, while the value\
  \ of physical regional boons won't be seem devalued by online availability. We think\
  \ this is a good way to include the new online region in our program, and hope to\
  \ review it in the future to see what other unique boons might be appropriate for\
  \ distribution through our online region.\"</p> \n    <p>So Online will be Mega\
  \ Region 5 and GMing a game online will open access to the Ferran &amp; Woioko races,\
  \ both of which are available <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Adventure Path #2: Temple of the Twelve</em></a>. Like the races\
  \ in the <em>Alien Archive</em>, a player needs to own the resource and have the\
  \ boon to play the race.</p> \n    <h2>Starfinder Season Launch</h2> \n    <p>When\
  \ the team looked at the summer convention schedule and what spinning up new seasons\
  \ on two organized play programs meant to our timelines (and sanity), we decided\
  \ a split release would work better. So we went looking for an event that our players\
  \ could get to, that had the size and scope of a premier event, and that would welcome\
  \ the profile of a new season launch. Our choice is <a href=\"http://originsgamefair.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><b>Origins Game Faire</b></a>, June 13-17 at the Greater Columbus\
  \ Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio. In past, the <a href=\"http://ohiopfs.org\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Ohio Pathfinder Society</a> planned games at Origins. The same\
  \ leadership team of Mike McNerney and associates will work with myself to bring\
  \ you a quality, Paizo-sponsored event. Watch this space in early 2018 for the blog\
  \ calling for GM volunteers.</p> \n    <h2>Starfinder Society Scenarios</h2> \n\
  \    <p>Since we rolled the Starfinder Society out at Gen Con 50, players clamored\
  \ for more content. We've evaluated a number of factors in-house, including available\
  \ organized play resources and current project commitments (more on this in a future\
  \ blog). It brings us great pleasure to give our players a treat. To once more quote\
  \ Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>\"\
  Two is a pretty cool number. I hear a lot of people talking about two in recent\
  \ months. Lots of questions and comments about the word two. What is two? What does\
  \ two mean to you? The dictionary defines two as \"equivalent to the sum of one\
  \ and one.\" Did you know that two is the smallest and first prime number? Two is\
  \ also the only even prime number. Did you know that a honeybee must tap TWO million\
  \ flowers to make one pound of honey!</p> \n     <p>There's just so many interesting\
  \ and fun facts about the number two...\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>As you\
  \ may have guessed by Thurston's fixation on the number two, we are pleased to announce\
  \ an increase to two Starfinder Scenarios a month, starting in <b>March 2018</b>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Scenario News</h3> \n    <p>We are deep in plans for 2018, so I asked\
  \ John and Thurston if we could give a few snippets of information about upcoming\
  \ scenarios. In Thurston's words, \"April sees the release of a new Tier 1-4 repeatable\
  \ scenario. We've received great reviews on <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-01: the Commencement</em></a>, and knew we wanted to\
  \ get another repeatable scenario out. As an added bonus, this scenario is also\
  \ slated to include starship combat, making it a suitable teaching tool for players\
  \ just learning Starfinder.</p> \n    <p>June brings us the release of a new Quest\
  \ Pack. This should help the summer conventions out by providing further introductory\
  \ material for bringing in new Starfinder players.</p> \n    <p>Our first Tier 5-8\
  \ scenario debuts in June. This scenario is the capstone for our ongoing Scoured\
  \ Stars storyline, which began in <a href=\"/products/btpy9wet/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-05-The-First-Mandate\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></a>, and continues until Origins.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>June (a popular month) also sees Starfinder Society debut its first interactive\
  \ special, starting at Origins, with later appearances at Gen Con and conventions\
  \ across the world. While this event is still being planned out, we are ready to\
  \ announce that it will be a Tier 1-8 event!</p> \n    <p>While June is popular,\
  \ we also want people to know that PaizoCon 2018 is getting closer. This year not\
  \ only debuts Starfinder Society events at the convention, but also debuts a very\
  \ special product. Four words: Strawberry Machine Cake Scenario.</p> \n    <p><i>*mic\
  \ drop*</i></p> \n    <p>On that note, and given I can't top Strawberry Machine\
  \ Cake, I'm signing off for this week. With so much Starfinder Society goodness\
  \ in this blog, we are going to take a break next week, and return on December 20th.\
  \ Next week's blog will feature some upcoming Pathfinder Society tidbits, since\
  \ we can't give the Starfinder Society all the shiny new toys!</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized\
  \ Play Manager</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Organized Play,\
