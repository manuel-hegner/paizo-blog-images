  \ has a winner!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 22, 2011</p> \n    <p>Paizo\
  \ challenged amateur game designers from around the world to show off their skills\
  \ in RPG Superstar 2011, the fourth season of Paizo's search for great undiscovered\
  \ game designers. Judges Ryan Dancey, Sean K Reynolds, Mark Moreland, and Neil Spicer\
  \ narrowed the field to 32 would-be RPG Superstars, and guest judges including Paizo\
  \ designer Stephen Radney-MacFarland, cartographers Jared Blando and Robert Lazzaretti,\
  \ and Paizo's Creative Director James Jacobs provided their advice as the contestants\
  \ answered each new challenge.</p> \n    <p>In the final round, we asked this year's\
  \ Top 4 to propose a 32-page Pathfinder Module for use with Paizo's <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. Contestants Cody Coffelt (Boise, ID), Jerall Toi\
  \ (Port Elizabeth, South Africa), Sam Zeitlin (Arlington, VA), and Sean McGowan\
  \ (New York City, NY) responded with four excellent submissions, but there can be\
  \ only one RPG Superstar 2011, and so after the judges offered comments, the general\
  \ public selected one winning proposal to be published by Paizo in early 2012.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Congratulations to <b>Sam Zeitlin</b> for his victorious proposal, <i>Grasping\
  \ at Shadows</i> which will be released as <b><i><a href=\"/pathfinder/modules/v5748btpy8joy\"\
  >The Midnight Mirror</a></i></b>. Here's a brief description of the adventure from\
  \ Sam Zeitlin's winning RPG Superstar 2011 submission:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>A horror and investigation adventure for 4th-level characters.</p> \n \
  \    <p>In shadow-haunted Nidal, the denizens of the Plane of Shadow intermingle\
  \ with the common man. Now people are disappearing, and it falls to the PCs to stop\
  \ the terror. Faced with terrible shadow creatures, an unruly mob of scared citizens,\
  \ and an unpredictable creature of light, can the heroes undo a greedy and uncaring\
  \ noble's self-serving mistake?</p> \n     <p><i>The Midnight Mirror</i> is an adventure\
  \ for 4th-level characters, written for the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i> and\
  \ compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world's oldest RPG. In addition to the\
  \ adventure, this volume also features a brand-new monster and a gazetteer of a\
  \ brand-new location in the shadow-tainted nation of Nidal.</p> \n     <p>Written\
  \ by Sam Zeitlin, the winner of Paizo Publishing's RPG Superstar contest, which\
  \ allows unpublished authors to compete before a panel of celebrity game designers\
  \ and legions of their peers for the chance to write a Pathfinder Module.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Pathfinder Modules are 32-page, high-quality, full-color, adventures using\
  \ the Open Game License to work with both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the\
  \ standard 3.5 fantasy RPG rules set. This Pathfinder Module includes new monsters,\
  \ treasure, and a fully detailed bonus location that can be used as part of the\
  \ adventure or in any other game!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>As RPG Superstar\
  \ 2011's Grand Prize, Paizo will contract Sam Zeitlin to write <i>The Midnight Mirror</i>,\
  \ which we will release as a <a href=\"/pathfinder/modules\">Pathfinder Module</a>\
  \ in January, 2012.</p> \n    <p>But you don't have to wait until January to reserve\
  \ your copy! Head over to the new <b><a href=\"/pathfinder/modules/v5748btpy8joy\"\
  ><i>The Midnight Mirror</i> product page</a></b> here on paizo.com to preorder your\
  \ copy of Sam Zeitlin's winning adventure! If you're already a Pathfinder Modules\
  \ subscriber, <i>The Midnight Mirror</i> will arrive as part of your subscription.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>On behalf of our judges as well as the whole Paizo Publishing family,\
  \ congratulations to Cody Coffelt, Jerall Toi, and Sean McGowan. Though only contestant\
  \ one earned the title of RPG Superstar 2011, for the first time in Paizo history,\
  \ the runners up will be contracted to write a scenario for the Pathfinder Society,\
  \ Paizo's organized play program. Keep an eye out in the months ahead for when these\
  \ scenarios will be released. </p> \n    <p>And we'd like to offer one final thanks\
  \ to you, the readers of paizo.com, and to anyone who submitted an entry or voted\
  \ during RPG Superstar 2011.</p> \n    <p>And for those of you who didn't, RPG Superstar\
  \ 2012 is less than a year away!</p> \n    <p>Hyrum Savage <br>Marketing and Organized\
  \ Play Manager</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: RPG Superstar, pathfinder modules,\
