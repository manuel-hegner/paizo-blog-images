  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Every season since the Year of the Ruby Phoenix\
  \ at Gen Con 2011, the we've released a new set of convention-exclusive boons that\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> players\
  \ can win. The next year I wrote the Season 4 boons as a volunteer, making a few\
  \ rewards that have reappeared over the years: Expedition Manager (what if a boon\
  \ let you do real archaeology?), Treasure Map, Missing Mentor (can a standalone\
  \ boon tell its own story?), and the infamous Xenophobia (what if there was a boon\
  \ that ate all of your race boons?). I have no doubt that boon writing played an\
  \ important part in my being hired by Paizo, so you can understand that I have a\
  \ special fondness for the process.</p> \n     <p>This year Linda Zayas-Palmer joined\
  \ in, and she brought some great ideas and energy to the project. We also had <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9egu\">a great new RPG hardcover book</a> dripping with flavor\
  \ that we could incorporate into these unique rewards. Finally, now that the <a\
  \ href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a> has begun the Season of the\
  \ Righteous, we have teamed up with Tanis o'Conner to create several convention\
  \ rewards tailored specifically to the Adventure Card Game's organized play program.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This year that adds up to 25 new rewards: 18 RPG convention boons, 5\
  \ Adventure Card Game convention rewards, and 2 GM boons.</p> \n     <p>Wait, two\
  \ GM convention boons? Yes, by popular demand, we took the much-desired Expanded\
  \ Narrative boon—allowing one to \"recharge\" GM star replay opportunities by GMing\
  \ more games—and converted it into an alternate GM boon. Now every time you GM at\
  \ a convention, you can earn your choice of that or that quarter's boon that unlocks\
  \ the ability to play a PC with a rare race. To kick it off, we're reintroducing\
  \ aasimars as a GM boon.</p> \n     <p>Let's take a look at look at this year's\
  \ Roleplaying Guild player rewards:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Alexandur Alexandrov</i>\n     </div> \n   \
  \  <ol>\n      <li>Psychic Dilettante allows your PC to use one of the psychic skill\
  \ unlocks from <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em> without being a psychic\
  \ character.</li> \n      <li>I rather enjoyed writing Prophetic Dream, which lets\
  \ your character experience a nocturnal vision that can grant her a much-needed\
  \ advantage during the rest of the adventure.</li> \n      <li>The Soothsayer is\
  \ a unique follower who can assist you on a skill check or boost your Armor Class\
  \ with a dire prediction that then leaves you shaken for 1 round.</li> \n      <li>Aspis\
  \ Slayer is the first of two anti-Aspis-Consortium boons, and it lets a ranger choose\
  \ the Consortium as a favored enemy or lets anyone else perform a devastating smite\
  \ against an Aspis agent.</li> \n      <li>Against the Consortium is the second\
  \ of these, and it's what I'd categorize as an achievement boon. Foil enough Aspis\
  \ schemes, and you can gain a deadly reputation that gives you an edge over any\
  \ other Consortium thugs.</li> \n      <li>Niche Specialist appears for the second\
  \ time, granting a PC his choice of a bonus during chases, an edge when fighting\
  \ in darkness, or an advantage against haunts.</li> \n      <li>We were rather charmed\
  \ by the idea that regular use of an object could imbue it with a psychic impression.\
  \ To introduce this in the organized play campaign, Linda created Psychic Awakening,\
  \ a boon that lets you develop a greater attachment to a favorite piece of equipment\
  \ by using it regularly or incorporating it into your actions. In return, it becomes\
  \ slightly easier to enchant.</li> \n      <li>Why should kineticists have all the\
  \ fun? Elemental Blast lets any character unleash a kineticist's signature attack\
  \ once—or allows a kineticist to perform a much-needed composite blast she otherwise\
  \ hasn't learned.</li> \n      <li>Some new spells and abilities in <em>Occult Adventures</em>\
  \ allow a character to read auras, whose colors correspond to different emotions.\
  \ The Emotional Aura boon lets you channel one of these emotional auras and glow\
  \ with the corresponding color to gain temporary bonuses.</li> \n      <li>Ley lines\
  \ wind their way through the world, and Ley Line Access lets your PC tap into one\
  \ to bolster spells with certain descriptors. I'm particularly proud of this one—\
  both because of the way you can reuse it when especially close to the ley line and\
  \ because of the fun opportunity I had to describe a few minor lines in the Inner\
  \ Sea region.</li> \n      <li>Some locations have their own benevolent spirit,\
  \ and the Loci Spirit Ritual boon allows a PC to contact one of these to curry its\
  \ favor (and gain defensive and healing abilities). However, performing evil actions\
  \ can corrupt a loci spirit, causing it to turn vengeful.</li> \n      <li>The Expedition\
  \ Manager is back, giving a PC the ability to launch his own archaeological expedition\
  \ and uncover more powerful items when spending Prestige Points.</li> \n      <li>One\
  \ of the most common requests I've heard over the past two years is for a way to\
  \ transfer a boon from one PC to another. Share the Wealth allows for exactly that,\
  \ but only for boons that grant the PC the ability to select an otherwise prohibited\
  \ animal companion, familiar, or other creature. You can instead use it to transfer\
  \ access to an intelligent item from one PC to another. I know that some folks aren't\
  \ going to like that this is a convention boon and not a universal ability, but\
  \ we'd first like to see whether this mechanic works on a smaller scale before introducing\
  \ a more widespread rule. Let us know what you think.</li> \n      <li>Hypnotic\
  \ Therapy lets your character retrain a class feature at a greatly reduced cost,\
  \ or she can subsidize a larger retraining project.</li> \n      <li>Linda and I\
  \ enjoy boons that allow one of a player's PC to interact with another of his PCs,\
  \ and the Pathfinder Apprentice boon allows one of your Seeker PCs to mentor a 1st-level\
  \ PC and grant her an additional trait from a short list.</li> \n      <li>Now that\
  \ there are rules for psychic magic, it's important for PCs to consider ways to\
  \ defend against these abilities. Psychic Bastion grants a PC a small bonus on saving\
  \ throws against mind-affecting effects, and the bonus increases if the effect is\
  \ from a psychic source.</li> \n      <li>Not everyone joined the Pathfinder Society\
  \ early in life. Some started as members of the Aspis Consortium and then thought\
  \ better of that decision. The Aspis Defector boon grants your PC a reusable trick\
  \ learned from her time among the Consortium.</li> \n      <li>It's hard to say\
  \ no to a Treasure Map, which lets a PC use his downtime to search for hidden treasure\
  \ rather than work a day job.</li>\n     </ol> \n     <p>And those are just the\
  \ RPG boons! As Tanis O'Connor explains, \"The Adventure Card Guild rewards run\
  \ the gamut from useful to awesome, with die bumps and scenario-spanning powers\
  \ representing just a few of the goodies on offer.\" On of my favorites is the Riftwarden\
  \ Response, which helps everyone fend off summoned henchment.</p> \n     <p>We're\
  \ excited to see these Chronicle sheets in players' hands, and we hope you enjoy\
  \ using them as much as we had fun writing them.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br>\
