                An exchange student, who stole sensitive Tech League property, had intimate relations with an UNSCARF officer, and is now AWOL. While this is a mess in all diplomatic circles, it’s inevitable that the politicians will proclaim this “An act of terror!" on Mira-Vision by morning. Ard Basst-The Service-Star City 5 Vex acts as security for the Lashunta-Human Relations, Liaison Sefuro. Meanwhile squadron battle droids, Carnage T9 and Slayer i28, experience a neural network onslaught. As the artificial night sky over Star City 5 (Zone 1) darkens, mysterious forces collude to implicate the Commander, Sefuro, and the droids in a terrorist act against the whole population of the behemoth starship.</p>
