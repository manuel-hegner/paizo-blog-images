  \ Adventure Card Game Homebrew Special blog is by Richard Noble (<a href=\"/people/BrotherTyler\"\
  >Brother Tyler</a>), about a homebrew of a different kind. Richard wanted to organize\
  \ his PACG cards, so he came up with some dividers and other tidbits to facilitate\
  \ storage and gameplay. They're pretty boss, sez me. —Mike</em></p>\n          \
  \   <blockquote>\n              <p>As our gaming group's facilitator, it falls to\
  \ me to control the game box, drawing cards and returning them to the box during\
  \ our PACG sessions. It's like being the banker in a popular real estate game, but\
  \ without the benefit of being able to skim money from the top.</p>\n          \
  \    <p>Has something like the following ever happened to you?</p>\n           \
  \   <p><em>With the town guard searching for Pillbug Podiker, Valeros offers to\
  \ stand post at the city gate. Recalling a large chest in which the guardsmen kept\
  \ confiscated contraband, he hopes to find some useful weapon. Finding the chest\
  \ durably locked, he turns to his crowbar...</em></p>\n              <p><b>Simon:</b>\
  \ I rolled a 14, opening the chest. And I got a 1 on the d4 roll, so I get 1 weapon\
  \ from the box.</p>\n              <p><b>Richard</b> (reaches into the box and pulls\
  \ out a weapon, handing the card facedown to Simon): Here you go!</p>\n        \
  \      <p><em>Valeros quickly opens the lid of the chest and guffaws in delight,\
  \ withdrawing a large glaive from within.</em></p>\n              <p><b>Simon:</b>\
  \ Alright! A Shock Glaive +1! Waitaminute, why is there a \"1\" in the top right\
  \ corner? Isn't this a \"B\" scenario?</p>\n              <p><b>Richard</b>: Dangit!</p>\n\
  \              <p>Or how about this?</p>\n              <p><em>Meanwhile, in one\
  \ of the village houses that Pillbug Podiker was known to have visited before his\
  \ disappearance, Merisiel is searching for clues. Hidden in the corner beneath a\
  \ pile of blankets she finds a battered chest. \"No problem,\" she says confidently\
  \ as she pulls a set of slender tools from inside her jerkin.</em></p>\n       \
  \       <p><b>Christina:</b> I recharged the Masterwork Tools to automatically defeat\
  \ the barrier, and I rolled a 1 for the number of items I get.</p>\n           \
  \   <p><b>Richard</b> (reaches into the box and pulls out a card, handing it facedown\
  \ to Christina): Here you go!</p>\n              <p><em>Cautiously, Merisiel lifts\
  \ the lid of the chest to reveal its contents, jumping back in surprise when a large\
  \ beast suddenly forces its way out, growling in fury. As she reaches for her knives,\
  \ she wonders how the chest's owner got the Saber-Toothed Tiger into the small chest.</em></p>\n\
  \              <p><b>Christina:</b> (Looking archly at her husband): I said I get\
  \ an item, not an ally.</p>\n              <p><b>Richard</b>: Great googly moogly!</p>\n\
  \              <p>Now I won't say that neither of these types of incidents has ever\
  \ happened to me, and I can't say that they haven't. Besides, my wife tells me that\
  \ it happens to everyone. To keep things like this from happening again, and to\
  \ satisfy my abnormal compulsion for organization, I developed some dividers to\
  \ keep everything neat and tidy. I decided early on that I wanted to make the dividers\
  \ sufficient to support whatever sort of organizational method different players\
  \ might like, with color coding and text of sufficient size and font type to be\
  \ legible at arm's length.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  ></a>\n               <br>\n                The dividers that started it all \n\
  \               <p></p>\n              </div>\n              <p>Something else to\
  \ consider was long-term storage. While the stock box comes with a plastic vacuum\
  \ tray that can fit all of the cards, things get a little dicey when you sleeve\
  \ the cards. Personally, I sleeve all of my PACG cards. I wanted to make sure that\
  \ the cards last, even when my wife is eating potato chips during a game. I used\
  \ the PACG organizer available from The Broken Token, removing all of the cards\
  \ for the AP from their boxes. I needed to ensure there were dividers for all of\
  \ the different card types as well as for all of the different deck indicators.\
  \ This makes adding cards (say, a 5th player joins us for a game) or removing them\
  \ (say, when we finish an Adventure Path) a snap.</p>\n              <div class=\"\

  \              </div>\n              <p>The basic dividers are tall enough so that\
  \ the labels can be seen over the top of the cards when they are unsleeved, but\
  \ they're short enough to fit in the base set box with the rules on top and the\
  \ lid all the way down. If your cards are sleeved and the dividers are cut to the\
  \ shortest height, much of the label is obscured by the sleeve, but the color bar\
  \ is still visible. Some players might not use the base set box, and those that\
  \ have a storage solution that allows for more height can cut the cards to different\
  \ heights so that they can be seen above the cards even when they are sleeved. There\
  \ are even different cut lines so that some dividers can be taller than others—\
  perhaps you want the main WEAPON divider to be visible above the other weapon dividers\
  \ (e.g., WEAPON—B, WEAPON—1, etc.).</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \              <p>The file for each Adventure Path also includes special dividers\

  \     </div>\n              <p>There are also some optional cards to facilitate\
  \ different types of storage methods. Most of the card types have an IN USE divider.\
  \ There are three options for removing cards from play, depending on what floats\
  \ your boat: When you decide that you're tired of seeing the Mace come up during\
  \ Fortress of the Stone Giants, you might simply put it behind the WEAPON—B divider.\
  \ Or maybe you'd prefer to put it behind the WEAPON—BASIC divider. And when you\
  \ finally banish that pesky Goblin Pyro during <em>Spires of Xin-Shalast</em>, you\
  \ might decide to put it behind the MONSTER—REMOVED divider.</p>\n             \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers4.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n               <br>\n                It's like the Whopper® of card organization:\
  \ you can have it your way. \n               <p></p>\n              </div>\n   \
  \           <p>I use the full-size dividers. I print them on card stock, laminate\
  \ them, and cut them to size. Lamination isn't absolutely necessary, but they're\
  \ pretty durable this way, and any snack residue wipes away easily.</p>\n      \
  \        <p>At some point it occurred to me that some people might already have\
  \ dividers and just need labels. Some game supply companies sell dividers; and some\
  \ players might use materials such as plasticard or cardstock cut down to size.\
  \ To support these and other options, I added pages that only have the labels. Players\
  \ can then cut out the ones they want and affix them to their dividers using tape\
  \ or glue.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers2.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers2_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \               <br>\n                These labels have been affixed with tape to\
  \ thick plasticard cut to size \n               <p></p>\n              </div>\n\
  \              <p>Another thing I did was create dividers and labels for the class/character/add-on\
  \ decks. There is a basic set of dividers applicable to all class/character/add-on\
  \ decks (boons), and a set of dividers specific to each class/character/add-on deck\
  \ (cohorts, if included in that deck, and each of the characters). Most of the dividers\
  \ are exactly the same as for the APs, with the addition of two different types\
  \ of dividers for the overall deck and small labels for your storage solution. Two\
  \ of the deck dividers have the name of the deck and images of all of the characters\
  \ in that deck. The other two deck dividers simply have the deck name and logo.\
  \ Any/all of these can be used however you want, depending on your storage solution.</p>\n\
  \              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Deckboxes.jpg\"\

  \             <p>I use plain boxes for long-term storage. These generally don't\
  \ have the majority of card dividers in them because I don't want to print up that\
  \ many dividers. I have a special deck holder for when I use a class/character/add-on\
  \ deck in organized play, and this holder has the dividers for all of the cards.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Cards for characters include the logo and/or name of the base\
  \ set or class/character/add-on deck to which they belong. This way you can see\
  \ at a glance that it's Kyra from the Cleric Class Deck romping around in the Worldwound\
  \ and not Kyra from Wrath of the Righteous.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <p>Another part of my divider files is standees. When my group first started\
  \ playing the game, we found that the tokens were sometimes difficult to see, pick\
  \ up, and move, so we often proxied the tokens with dice (which didn't work well).\
  \ Also, those tokens take up space, and we often played where space was at a premium.\
  \ I decided that some sort of substitute was necessary. I would have preferred to\
  \ use miniatures, but some of the characters don't have miniatures and I didn't\
  \ want to have to either look for miniatures that were \"close enough\" or explain\
  \ to players, some of whom can be quite persnickety, that the red-bearded dwarf\
  \ miniature represents Agna or some such. Most of the characters have images that\
  \ are part of the Community Use Package, making paper standees relatively easy.\
  \ I made the standees in two sizes, though my group uses the smaller ones. These\
  \ can be printed, cut out, and assembled to make triangular standees that are easier\
  \ to see, pick up, and move. I also laminate the standees to avoid that annoying\
  \ snack residue. We found that the standees needed some weighted bases to keep them\
  \ from tipping over, so I found suitably sized art tiles at a local craft store\
  \ and glued each standee to a tile, then cut small squares of drawer liner (available\
  \ by the roll at local DIY stores) and glued them to the bottoms to protect the\
  \ table surface. For those characters that don't have images, I have six blank standees,\
  \ each on a different colored base. The standees can be stored easily in tackle\
  \ box inserts.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a\
