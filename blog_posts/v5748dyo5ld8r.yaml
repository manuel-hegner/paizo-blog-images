  \   </div> \n   <h1>RPG Superstar™: Advice from Your Future</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Thursday, March 15, 2012</p> \n   <p>To the top four competitors: congratulations!\
  \ Though I’m not a guest judge this round, I will be the person developing the winner’\
  s submission, so I thought I’d take the opportunity while you’re putting together\
  \ your adventure proposals to offer some advice. Chances are good that the same\
  \ elements I touch on here are the same things Clark, James, Neil, Ryan, and Sean\
  \ will be looking for and judging you on next weekend, so pay attention! </p> \n\
  \   <p><b>1. Scope:</b> Every year at least one competitor puts forward an adventure\
  \ proposal that simply couldn’t fit in a 32-page print product. The judges will\
  \ ding you for this hard, and even if you win by popular vote despite that, the\
  \ physical limitations of the medium will necessitate changes from your proposal\
  \ that may jeopardize your winning vision. A Pathfinder Module typically has around\
  \ 20,000 words, with 1,800 of those restricted to appendixes. That means you have\
  \ around 18,000 words to describe all the backstory, characters, and locations in\
  \ the adventure, as well as all the stats contained therein.</p> \n   <p>The average\
  \ encounter is 500 words (including statblocks). If you anticipate using 10,000\
  \ words of your final adventure detailing a cult’s lair, know that you’re going\
  \ to need (and have room for) about 20 encounter areas. Some of these will be fights\
  \ that have statblocks that push them over the average, and some will be mostly\
  \ empty rooms with only a paragraph or two of text to even that average out. But\
  \ if you set half of the adventure in a giant castle that couldn’t reasonably have\
  \ less than 20 rooms, chances are you’ll have to cut a lot of the contents within,\
  \ or cut other elements of the adventure to make room. If everything you propose\
  \ is vital to the story, then cutting things can drastically change the adventure\
  \ from the proposed concept.</p> \n   <p><b>2. Simplicity:</b> Another thing we\
  \ see every year are what we’ve termed “wahoo” elements in folks’ proposals. I understand\
  \ why some competitors want to pull out all the stops with complicated and cinematic\
  \ fights, locations, villains, and adventure premises: you want people to think\
  \ your adventure will be the coolest to play. But consider that the more we need\
  \ to explain something—whether it’s a rules subsystem or the complex way an encounter\
  \ in a weird location plays out—the less words you have to tell your story. You’\
  ll note we often save our rules subsystems for Pathfinder Adventure Path books,\
  \ where they can be explained as independent articles that don’t eat into the adventures\
  \ themselves. This is because we don’t have room for such things in most 32-page\
  \ modules. Tell an engaging story that relies on plot, memorable characters, and\
  \ interesting locations rather than a few complicated, off-the-wall elements; your\
  \ job, my job, and the GM at the table’s job will be easier, and if it’s a good\
  \ story, the players will enjoy it just as much as something wacky, as long as their\
  \ PCs partake in something meaty.</p> \n   <p>Along the same lines, consider the\
  \ number of sources needed to run the adventure and especially to run any single\
  \ NPC. If your adventure hinges on a creature from the <i>Bestiary 3</i> who has\
  \ levels in both alchemist and rogue and uses an archetype from <i>Ultimate Magic</i>,\
  \ you’ve necessitated the use of four books to design, develop, and ultimately run\
  \ that character. In most cases, the same story can be told with only one or two\
  \ books, everyone has an easier time, and the encounter can be just as memorable.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>3. Scale:</b> The assignment this year is to propose a 9th-level adventure.\
  \ That means it assumes a balanced party of four 9th-level PCs and thus needs to\
  \ be able to account for some of the things a 9th-level party can do. By this point\
  \ in a character’s career, she has become a mover and shaker on the national or\
  \ even regional stage. A 9th-level spellcaster can cast such spells as <i>commune,\
  \ dominate person, polymorph, raise dead, scrying, teleport,</i> and <i>true seeing</i>.\
  \ It’s not unreasonable to assume they also have a few higher-level spells on scrolls,\
  \ which are more than affordable in limited quantities. Characters of this level\
  \ should always be assumed to be able to fly, turn invisible, and take on whatever\
  \ disguise they want, and encounters that hinge on them not being able to do these\
  \ things will fall flat. Large parties of creatures with class levels to bring them\
  \ up to the right CR are likely to stretch credulity, in that a meager thieves’\
  \ guild wouldn’t typically have a lot of people in it with more than a few levels;\
  \ they’d have already taken over the whole town, not to mention that masses of low-CR\
  \ creatures are literally speed bumps overcome with a single area of effect spell.\
  \ All of these are the sorts of things to keep in mind when deciding if a general\
  \ premise or specific encounter is appropriate for characters running through your\
  \ adventure.</p> \n   <p><b>4. Format:</b> Pathfinder adventures (and Pathfinder\
  \ Modules specifically) follow an established format. When coming up with your idea,\
  \ consider whether it will work within the format it will be published in. Could\
  \ the “story so far” fit on a page or two at most in the Adventure Background section?\
  \ Can the events of the adventure itself be summed up quickly and concisely in the\
  \ Adventure Summary? Would you need to use more than the two and a half pages of\
  \ maps most Pathfinder Modules get? Does the story have a clear beginning, middle,\
  \ and end that could be broken into three distinct parts or acts? Does it contain\
  \ a new monster and can that monster be run without us needing to print its stats\
  \ twice (i.e. the base creature in the appendix and a version with class levels\
  \ in the adventure itself)? Is there a location in the adventure that, while set\
  \ in Golarion, could be easily ported to a different setting or dropped into a GM’\
  s game independent of running this adventure? All of these are parts of the Pathfinder\
  \ Module format, so it’s important you build an adventure that adheres to these\
  \ elements.</p> \n   <p>And now that I’ve fully channeled Neil Spicer with my lengthy\
  \ post, I’ll let you get back to the task at hand. I hope the above advice is helpful\
  \ and doesn’t discourage you from proposing the story you really want to tell. Rather,\
  \ I hope it encourages you to find creative ways to tell that story in a way that\
  \ will both capture the voters’ attention and garner the backing of the judges and\
  \ your potential future employers here at Paizo. Best of luck, gentlemen!</p> \n\
