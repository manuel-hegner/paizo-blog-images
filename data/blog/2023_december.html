                 <p><b>What is a Humble Bundle?</b><br>
                   Bundles are limited-time collections of games, books, software, and more. Simply pay what you want and choose where your money goes, whether that be to the publisher, to Humble itself, or even to charity. Most bundles come in tiers starting at only $1—but the more you give, the more you get in exchange!</p>

                <p><em>Jadnura began his Starfinder agent career as a solitary explorer. A kasatha who wanted to share his knowledge with the wider galaxy, Jadnura always went about his missions on his own and rarely interacted with fellow Society members. As his expeditions became more and more dangerous, Jadnura eventually came to rely on his fellow Starfinders and developed a genuine love of the organization that allowed him to explore his passion for archaeology and exploration. </em></p>

                <p><em>Over a career spanning nearly two decades, Jadnura excelled at two things: his solarian training, and his ability to fill the Starfinder Chronicles broadcasts. Anyone reading the Chronicles over the last decade had likely seen Jadnura’s name countless times as the leader of an expedition or a wise voice adding opinion or additional fact to a specific chronicle. Throughout the Society, Jadnura was a respected leader and was often nominated for a position in the Forum. </em></p>
                <p><em>Everything changed when Jadnura undertook his mission to the moon of Kukanou-2b. On that mission, Jadnura uncovered the mentrasi Tear, though he didn’t yet realize the full implications of the relic’s discovery. Returning to the Lorespire with the Tear, Jadnura dedicated himself to uncovering its mysteries. Though he barely scratched the surface of its true powers, Jadnura discovered a strong connection to the mysterious region of space known as the Scoured Stars. Dreams and waking visions drew Jadnura’s attention to the region, and as the current First Seeker stepped down, Jadnura took his first grasp at leadership by nominating himself as a successor. </em></p>
                <p><em>The Society’s membership overwhelmingly supported Jadnura, and many saw the quest to the previously forbidden Scoured Stars as the start of a new chapter in the Society’s history. They weren’t wrong. </em></p>
                <h3><strong><em>THE MISSION </em></strong></h3>
                <p><em>Jadnura assembled an overwhelming force to travel to the Scoured Stars. Every major starship and group of agents was prepared to descend on the abandoned worlds of the trinary star system to catalogue data and uncover the truth of the mysterious Tear relic. Jadnura himself took charge of the mission, leaving behind only what assets were already committed to other missions, or those too unsuited to travel (such as the Wayfinders’ flagship, the Master of Stars). </em></p>
                <p>Upon entering the Scoured Stars, Jadnura began to coordinate missions across the three systems. However, in the expedition’s opening hours, the Tear relic started to act in a strange manner. Soon all sorts of horrors, from fiends to robotic defenders to enraged fauna, began to assail the Society’s expedition. Before Jadnura could call for a general retreat into the Drift, all communication stopped. Later expeditions would find the Scoured Stars inaccessible, the system entirely covered in a shield of aurum energy that prevented any means of entry. The Society lost most of its agents and resources in a handful of hours</p>

                <h3><strong><em>AFTERMATH </em></strong></h3>
                <p><em>The chaos that followed the Scoured Stars incident almost tore the surviving Society membership apart. The few members of the Forum who hadn’t taken part in the mission openly debated how to handle the situation. Debates turned to bickering and then into outright hostility as members of the Society proclaimed their vision for the future as the only right way forward. Much time was spent on infighting or trying in vain to breach the Scoured Stars, instead of stabilizing the </em><em>fractured Society.<br><br></em></p>
                <p><em>With creditors and outside forces poised to take the venerable institution of the Starfinder Society down for good, one agent stepped forward. Luwazi Elsebo was an experienced Starfinder who had been on a long-range mission near the Azlanti Star Empire’s space at the time of the Scoured Stars incident. She ended her mission early and returned to the Lorespire Complex when the news reached her. When she saw the squabbling members who fought for power, she stepped away and focused on keeping the Society intact.</em></p>

                <br>
                <p><em>Calling in favors from across the Pact Worlds, Luwazi managed to keep the Society financially solvent while also sponsoring new missions to restore faith in the fractured organization. She went on to stabilize each of the Society’s internal factions, which had each suffered greatly from the recent losses. Finally, she engineered the use of mercenaries to act as temporary agents, directly leading to the formation of the Acquisitives faction. </em></p>
                <p><em>For her efforts, the remainder of the Society rallied around Luwazi and nominated her as First Seeker. However, Guidance refuses to acknowledge the appointment until the matter of the Scoured Stars incident can be truly resolved. </em></p>

                <p itemprop="description"><strong><em>“There’s more to life than fighting monsters and looting treasure.

                <p>With the lowest stakes and longest time covered, downtime is a great way to start sessions, or take a break between major beats of a campaign. While most groups will do downtime activities in a few minutes, some downtime periods may last an entire session to suit the story beats. Just like exploration mode, downtime mode can be interspersed with encounters and roleplay beats to keep things moving.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of tasks characters can take during downtime, such as taking long-term rests, earning income through a variety of avenues, going shopping, and retraining skills! Some of these tasks take longer than others—happening over a series of days or weeks, rather than hours in game. But take care not to linger too much in downtime at the table—15 minutes to half an hour is a good baseline for most downtime activities.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f28f5f22-a7c8-44c4-8a9c-94639c3ca56b/PZO2103_RunningABusiness_1800x1200.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f28f5f22-a7c8-44c4-8a9c-94639c3ca56b/PZO2103_RunningABusiness_1800x1200.png" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Harsk pours tea for a companion at a tea house."></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div>
                <p>Downtime should always start with each player deciding what activity their character doing—or a group of characters deciding to collaborate on a downtime activity, like putting on a show to earn income. Some downtime tasks only require a simple roll and a little embellishment; for example, rolling a 22 to Earn Income via Crafting only requires the character stating what they’ve made and what it looks like. The GM might choose to roleplay a short scene of the buyer complimenting the work.</p>
                <p>This is also a great time for daily preparations, such as choosing spells. Players should decide on a standard set of daily preparations, which will then be assumed to be the default unless the player states otherwise during a given downtime.</p>
                <p>For longer periods of downtime that may take place over weeks, months, or even years, the GM and players should check in about long-term goals for the downtime. Then, rather than rolling for every single day and activity, the GM can lay out specific events that are bigger stepping stones to that end goal.</p>
                <p>Using downtime is a great way to slow the game down after a stressful adventure or battle, as well as ease players into the session at the beginning of a new chapter! <em>Pathfinder GM Core</em> goes into detail about running downtime, to support GMs as they help characters achieve long-term and short-term goals. <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> outlines some basic downtime activities for player characters, as well as suggestions for thinking outside the box!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">“So the shiny runes are… the reflection on the water?”</p>
                <p>“Precisely! But there are many <em>varieties </em>and <em>states </em>of water, yes? How to maintain a reflection upon the frothing waves, or to split one across all the drops in a storm so that they fall in unison? What if one could calm and freeze the sea, carve off a piece of that reflection, and deposit it in another, <em>still liquid</em> sea—and have it <em>continue reflecting that original sea? </em>With a more <em>expansive </em>view of magic, one not held captive by axioms or collecting dust in a university library, one begins to see the hidden world truly unfold."</p>
                <p>“Ez, I don’t wanna be in this chair all day.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, yes.” Ezren scowled at his subject. “‘You can talk and tattoo at the same time,’ I believe were the exact words. Very well.”</p>
                <p><em>Tak</em>.</p>
                <p>A precise blow, and Ezren’s needle once more pierced Valeros’s skin to deposit a drop of ink. Ezren placed the instrument on the work table, lifted another from a pot of sparking red liquid, muttered over it, and then the stuff turned just as black as any other ink. Valeros had asked about this about half an hour ago, which had earned him the lecture on magical theory.</p>

                <p><em>Tak.</em></p>
                <p>Ezren lifted the striking rod, sighed brusquely, and set aside his tools. “Valeros, this patronage lasts for weeks. Can you at least <em>try </em>to be a good conversation partner?”</p>
                <p>Valeros went to massage his temples, remembered he couldn’t move his right arm, and growled in frustration. “That’s rich. I <em>tried</em> with your big wet mirror analogy, you know! Hard to stay engaged when I can’t get a word in edgewise. Plus what do I know about magic theory? You want to have a proper conversation, you need to—"</p>
                <p>The workshop’s southern face exploded inward in a storm of wood and dust. A ceiling joist smashed onto one end of Valeros’s chair, knocking it over and sending him rolling across the floor. Ezren hit the far wall, followed by several pots of ink—one of which hit the man square in the head. He folded like an anemic bird.</p>
                <p>Valeros, dazed, opened an eye. No sign of sword: bad. Shield nearby: good. Shield slightly bent: standard.</p>
                <p>Nothing broken, good. Lotta shallow stinging cuts, fair enough, not great.</p>
                <p>Heavy, gurgling breathing, and what sounded like tightening rope.</p>
                <p>Valeros rolled. A gnarled and glowing fist smashed through a fallen bookshelf and practically disintegrated the floor where his torso had been. He kneeled, lifted his shield, and turned to face his opponent.</p>
                <p>Then swore. “Oh, <em>give me a break</em>.”<br><br>
                 The person in front of him—he was almost certain it was a person—needed to crouch to fit in the cramped workshop. Which they were <em>not </em>doing, having instead used their neck and head as a battering ram. They had ploughed through roof and wreckage in their attempt to crush Valeros. Human-shaped, their body was covered in thick, obsidian scabs, viscous blood pouring from fissures like molten steel into a mold. They radiated heat like a furnace.</p>
                <p>“Ez,” he called. “<em>Ez!</em>”</p>
                <p>No sound but the hot roar of the giant’s breathing—and another tightening rope. He whipped his shield up, caught part of the blow, spun, and let the monstrosity stagger past him.</p>
                <p>Fast not nimble. Probably too big to take out himself? Outmaneuver it, check on Ezren. Yeah.</p>
                <p>Deep breath. Shield set. Knife out. Keep moving. In, sting. Out, shield up, make space. He was the horsefly, the heaving thing was the horse. Each bite of the blade loosed a cascade of blazing sludge that burned its way through the floor.</p>
                <p>Sting, make space. Stay hard to see. Avoid the—</p>
                <p>Valeros’s bones rattled inside his flesh and his vision exploded with hot, angry light.</p>
                <p>“Back!”</p>
                <p>Ezren’s voice rose over the assailant’s furnace rage. Valeros dipped in and out of consciousness, the ringing in his ears sometimes giving way to the <em>whoosh </em>of fire magic. He caught glimpses of Ezren wreathed in blue-white symbols, launching gouts of flame from one hand. His other held the snake-head staff, its eyes sapphire coals, surrounded in a blazing corona that flared every time the creature swung at Ezren. The fists seemed to hit an invisible barrier, and light erupted in a crackling flash.</p>
                <p>It was pretty impressive, honestly. But Ezren was going to run out of steam soon.</p>
                <p>The broken armor stand was leaning against the wall nearby, Valeros’s breastplate wrapped around it by the force of the giant’s initial entry. He lifted it, tested its weight. It was no sword, but it would do.</p>
                <p>Valeros charged, makeshift weapon high, and brought it down on the thing’s spine. It screamed in a blast of sparks and spun toward him. Ezren continued raining flame into it. With each one, those internal fires grew hotter, and Valeros hoped that Ezren knew what the hell he was doing.</p>
                <p>Then the tattoo started moving. Almost tickled, at first. It pulsed in time with Ezren’s magic, flared when those blue-white runes did. The tiger stripes slithered down his arm and up the erstwhile mace, and now each blow brought its own arcane heat. In, body blow, out. In, pull attention, out.</p>
                <p>Then he raised the makeshift weapon high and brought it down on the creature’s leg. It stumbled forward and fell, now almost too bright to look at, its fissures incandescent, limbs churning on the splintered floor, little fires beginning to sprout around it.</p>
                <p>It howled and launched its entire body at Valeros. At the same time, those tiger stripes leapt onto the shield Valeros was already raising. Monster met metal, and there was a deafening thunderclap.</p>

                <p>Ezren said it was like a kettle with no lid. Too much steam, boom. Valeros didn’t know why you’d make a furnace-thing weak to fire, but hey, spell people were weird.</p>
                <p>“So then what was the twisty tattoo thing?”</p>
                <p>Valeros was mopping up ink, again. The last mop had melted after he’d tried to use it on the purple stuff.</p>
                <p>Ezren looked up from the singed diagrams he was attempting to reconstruct. “I… honestly don’t know, which is very exciting! I think the tattoo was mimicking the ablative properties of my spellshaping. Which <em>shouldn’t</em> have been possible, given the crystallization matrix I established, but it was a tattoo, and blood, flesh, and hair are all traditionally puissant."  </p>
                <p>“Huh, I s’pose I could see that. So you moved the wet reflection to my big red mirror?”</p>
                <p>“…so, my friend, you <em>were</em> paying attention!”</p>
                <p>“I mean, kinda. Just… next time make it interesting, y’know? Say what the magic <em>does</em>, not just how it works in the fantastical and esoteric realms of the mind or whatever. You’re attaching it to <em>my</em> body, so tell me what it does, how I can use it. That’s the interesting stuff. Sorta like learning how someone fights.”</p>
                <p>Ezren smiled and tapped the head of his staff on the pewter mug hanging from Valeros’s belt.</p>
                <p>“Well, then. What say we talk the finer points of steel and ritual over a drink?”</p>
                <p>Valeros held out a hand, offering to carry Ezren’s pack on the rough road into town.</p>
                <p>“Maybe touch on who wants us dead so bad, too. Since we’ll be here for weeks and all. But, yeah,” he said, smiling, “that sounds good.”</p>
