  \   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Pathfinder Battles Preview: Starting Small\
  \ with the Shattered Star</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, August 3, 2012</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>August is upon us, and we've finally\
  \ reached the release month for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures! We'll debut the set at Gen Con\
  \ Indy, which means that the complete shipment is currently sitting in our warehouse,\
  \ which has picked up a distinctive smell of fresh plastic. I love the smell of\
  \ fresh plastic in the morning. It smells like... Victory.</p> \n    <p>Anyway,\
  \ you guys are going to explode with delight when you get the Rise of the Runelords\
  \ figures in your hands. They are absolutely amazing, and set a new standard for\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">A standard\
  \ we're set to exceed with the very NEXT set, the Shattered Star! This third official\
  \ set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures (produced in cooperation with our friends\
  \ at WizKids) contains 55 figures, and is currently slated for a January 2013 release.\
  \ We're still working on some of the final details on price and packaging, so it'll\
  \ be several more weeks before we have the product pages for this set up and running\
  \ here on paizo.com, but we don't want to let pesky details like that get in the\
  \ way of revealing some of the amazing figures we've been working on over the last\
  \ few months.</span></p> \n    <p>Even though we haven't yet revealed a single Shattered\
  \ Star mini, we're actually much farther ahead in the production process with this\
  \ set than we've been at a similar period with other sets. We've approved about\
  \ 90% of the paint masters so far, and are only waiting on a couple of figures.\
  \ Preview images from the set should be landing here every Friday until I run out\
  \ of them, and believe me when I say you're in store for some absolutely astounding\
  \ miniatures.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/ShatteredStar_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>Before I get to today's initial reveals, I want to talk briefly\
  \ about spoilers and the nature of previewing a set of miniatures for an adventure\
  \ campaign that hasn't been published yet—it's going to be a bit difficult, and\
  \ you probably ARE going to have a few minor details and surprises spoiled by reading\
  \ these weekly blogs.</p> \n    <p>I'll take care to hide truly egregious spoilers\
  \ (“this guy is the arch villain of adventure three, but he's the PCs' best friend\
  \ for the first two adventures, LOL”) behind spoiler tags, but as the entire point\
  \ of showing off these miniatures is to, well, SHOW OFF THESE MINIATURES, I'm not\
  \ going to hide every image behind a spoiler tag. If you're the type of player or\
  \ GM who gets bent out of shape knowing that certain monsters are scheduled to appear\
  \ in an adventure you haven't played yet, it may be a good idea to keep your eyes\
  \ away from this space for the foreseeable future.</p> \n    <p>‘Cause I'm going\
  \ to spill some secrets. </p> \n    <p>Let's start with some small ones, from the\
  \ very first volume of the \n     <link to ap landing page>Shattered Star Adventure\
  \ Path, \n     <link>Shards of Sin. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \  <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120803-Mite.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120803-Mite_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first is the lowly Mite, a rank-and-file\
  \ monster from the pages of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Bestiary</i></a>. This standard Small fey creature plays an important role in\
  \ the opening adventure (and this isn't the only mite in the set, either). I love\
  \ how gross WizKids' master painter made this little bugger, and I can't wait to\
  \ get a whole pile of them to add to my personal collection.</p> \n    <p>Speaking\
  \ of giant piles of monsters I'd quite like to add to my collection, allow me to\
  \ introduce you to a derro known as Caedimus!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120803-Derro.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120803-Derro_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Good Caedimus is a rank-and-file derro. We've given him a specific\
  \ name to differentiate him from the <i>other</i> derro in the set (which we'll\
  \ show off soon), but like the Mite, Caedimus is currently slated at the common\
  \ rarity.</p> \n    <p>I'm hoping to get a bunch of him.</p> \n    <p>That's it\
  \ for this week. Although both of these critters are Small, they're a good intro\
  \ to the set, which in future weeks will include lots of much, much, much larger\
  \ figures. </p> \n    <p>We're on the hunt for the Shattered Star! Come back to\
  \ this space next Friday for a look at some more awesome minis coming your way in\
  \ January!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
