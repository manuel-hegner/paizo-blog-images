  \ class=\"date\">Wednesday, February 17, 2010</p> \n   <p>Those of you who recognize\
  \ a striking similarity between the title of this blog post and <i>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path</i> #29's editorial have no doubt already inferred what I'm about to say,\
  \ but I've been waiting almost a year to say it, so here goes: </p> \n   <p><a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/fiction\">Pathfinder Fiction</a> is <i>here</i>.</p> \n   <p>Not here\
  \ in the warehouse, of course—you'll have to wait until Gen Con Indy to get your\
  \ hands on the first book in the line. But for the first time ever, you can now\
  \ visit <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction\">the Pathfinder Fiction page</a>, post on\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/fiction\">the Pathfinder\
  \ Fiction messageboards</a>, and <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction\">preorder both of\
  \ the new books</a> that have been announced.</p> \n   <p>And what an announcement\
  \ it is! First up, releasing officially in September but with early preview copies\
  \ slated for a Gen Con release, is <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction/v5748btpy8ddr\"\
  ><i>Winter Witch</i></a> from <i>New York Times</i> best selling author Elaine Cunningham.\
  \ Journey to the icy land of Irrisen with a barbarian shield maiden and her ne'er-do-well\
  \ (but magically gifted) accomplice on a quest to save the woman's sister from the\
  \ sinister daughters of Baba Yaga!</p> \n   <p>Immediately after that, we have the\
  \ triumphant return of Dave Gross's mystery-solving duo, half-elven noble Varian\
  \ Jeggare and the tiefling Radovan, in the gothic adventure <a href=\"/pathfinder/fiction/v5748btpy8dds\"\
  ><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>. Something is rotten in Ustalav, and only Egorian's\
  \ greatest detective team can delve into the haunted hills to uncover the truth—\
  and make it out alive...</p> \n   <p>Each Pathfinder Fiction novel is a mass market\
  \ paperback, completely standalone, and costs just $9.99. What's more, very soon\
  \ we'll be launching the ability to subscribe to the line, with subscribers receiving\
  \ a free PDF of each book they buy.</p> \n   <p>While we've only announced two of\
  \ the books so far, I can also say with authority that the party is just getting\
  \ started. In addition to several fabulous authors currently in negotiations and\
  \ development, it's my pleasure to also introduce the addition of fan favorite Paul\
  \ S. Kemp to the line. Though we're not ready to share any details about books beyond\
  \ the initial two just now, rest assured that more news will continue to come as\
  \ we get closer to the line's official launch at Gen Con Indy.</p> \n   <p>In the\
  \ meantime, rather than joining me in counting the days until the release, why not\
  \ head on over to the Pathfinder Fiction messageboards and let us know what you\
  \ think? Who would you like to see writing in the line? What regions seem ripest\
  \ for a novel? As with everything we do at Paizo, we're always listening.</p> \n\
