  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Shadow is a more than a mere absence\
  \ of light in Golarion. It's a fundamental force, no weaker than the elemental energies,\
  \ no less vast than the ethereal or astral planes, and far more common in everyday\
  \ life than any of those esoteric materials. The Shadow Plane is a physical place,\
  \ a colorless realm that serves as a dark reflection of the Material Plane, and\
  \ its existence can mold and shape those within it. The fetchlings who dwell there\
  \ are the descendants of Azlanti refugees, who over generations have been altered\
  \ by constant exposure to its planar power until they are no longer truly human.\
  \ Conversely, the wayang found on the Material Plane have been changed by their\
  \ lack of access to the Shadow Plane, their pathways between their new lands and\
  \ their original homes destroyed when the sun returned and the Age of Darkness ended.</p>\

  \ shadow, of course, is total darkness. Such lightless realms may lack the planar\
  \ power of shadow, but within the darkness other powers over move about unseen and\
  \ unfettered. It was in the darkness of the Darklands that a group of elves fleeing\
  \ the destruction of Earthfall became vulnerable to demonic influence, and in time\
  \ so corrupted themselves and their society that they became something wholly different\
  \ than elves. The drows' transformation may not have involved direct exposure to\
  \ the power of a plane, but it remains a testament to the power of the shadowed\
  \ places.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\" style=\"width:320px !important;\">\n\

  \   </div> \n    <p>These then—drow, fetchling, and wayang—are the races that receive\
  \ the most focus of <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6s\"><em>Player Companion: Blood of\
  \ Shadows</em></a>. Some examination is given to how the rest of Golarion treats\
  \ those tied to shadow, with discussion of shadowy origin stories (from benign envoy\
  \ to umbral operative). The idea of the taint of shadow reaching beyond these races\
  \ is explored with darkborn and shadowborn alternate racial traits. Then in the\
  \ sections dedicated to each race, the options players often look at to customize\
  \ their characters are expanded, with favored class bonuses, alternate racial traits,\
  \ and sometimes racial feats. Some idea of how these cultures handle core roles\
  \ differently is revealed with common archetypes that can be traced back to these\
  \ races (though now generally also available to a few beyond the originator societies),\
  \ ranging from the shadow-themed rogue talents developed by the fetchlings, to the\
  \ shadow ink tattoos and shadow mysteries once exclusive to the wayang.</p> \n \
