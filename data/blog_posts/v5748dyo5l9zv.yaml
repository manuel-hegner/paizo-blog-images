  \ Vale's Biology</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June 4, 2008</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Numerous interesting plants and animals live in Golarion. The <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy80ib\">Guide to Darkmoon Vale</a></i> offers looks at some of the\
  \ vale's most iconic or infamous fauna and flora. First up here is a peek at the\
  \ Fauna sidebar.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Darkmoon Vale Fauna</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Most creatures in Darkmoon Vale are simply animals or vermin, with no darker\
  \ agendas than mere survival. The following are some of the most common creatures\
  \ of the region. <br><b>Firefoot Fennec:</b> These red-footed foxes are common throughout\
  \ northern Andoran and southern Isger. Their pelts are popular in Absalom and Molthune.\
  \ <br><b>Dusk Spider:</b> These foot-diameter spiders inhabit the Arthfell Forest\
  \ in large communities that weave immense webs covering several acres. Dusk spider\
  \ venom, when properly milked from a living creature, makes for a potent alcoholic\
  \ additive. <br><b>Giant Mosquito:</b> These pests are as large as small birds,\
  \ but they tend to (thankfully) travel alone. Female giant mosquitoes (like their\
  \ normal-sized cousins) drink the blood of warm-blooded animals. <br><b>Giant Moorsnake:</b>\
  \ These ophidian predators are active mostly at night. As constrictors, they prefer\
  \ to sneak up on their victims while their potential meals are sleeping. <br><b>Mereswan:</b>\
  \ Unique to the Droskmere, mereswans are normal swans who can eat the mildly acidic\
  \ popcarp within the lake and who only use a certain kind of volcanic rock for their\
  \ gizzard stones. The combination of these two elements mean regurgitated gizzard\
  \ stones of mereswans are smoothly polished semiprecious gems popular with dwarves.\
  \ <br><b>Mountain Horses:</b> Indigenous to the Aspodells, these long-haired, massive\
  \ equines are popular with miners for their easy temperaments and flexible diets.\
  \ <br><b>Popcarp:</b> Mildly acidic flesh makes the popcarp of Droskmere an unpopular\
  \ meal, except for the beautiful mereswans who live nearby. When threatened, a popcarp\
  \ can explosively empty its gas bladder out its mouth to move quickly away, making\
  \ a distinctive popping noise when it does so (hence its name). <br><b>Slurks:</b>\
  \ The slurk is the disgusting result of ill-advised dwarven efforts at breeding\
  \ underground frogs. Kobolds prize the foul-smelling and slime-covered creatures\
  \ as pets and mounts. Slurks live underground in damp caverns where the fungi and\
  \ lichens they prefer to eat grow in abundance. <br><b>Zhen Worm:</b> A smaller\
  \ species of great worms roughly half the size of Qadira's famous alamien worms,\
  \ the zhen worms of Andoran can survive in environs that would kill their larger\
  \ cousins. Zhen worms thrive in warm, moist soil, and many of them migrate frequently\
  \ to the areas around Darkmoon Vale's geysers, mud pots, and other geothermal features.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>And not to be outdone, here's the Flora sidebar.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Darkmoon Vale Flora</h2> \n     <p>Many varieties\
  \ of unique and rare plants live in Darkmoon Vale. The following are those of greatest\
  \ interest to residents and visitors of the region. <br><b>Appleleaf:</b> These\
  \ low-growing plants have leaves that grow in groups of four and taste of slightly\
  \ bitter apples when eaten. Appleleaf grows all over within the forests of Darkmoon\
  \ Vale and southern Isger. <br><b>Blackscour:</b> A black-headed fungus that tastes\
  \ hard, bitter, and sharp. It grows in the water and causes blackscour taint if\
  \ any part of it, including its spores, are consumed (usually by drinking contaminated\
  \ water). Blackscour is not native to the region and was only recently introduced\
  \ to Darkmoon Vale. <br><b>Dowmberries:</b> Although the plants that bear them contain\
  \ massive thorns, dowmberries remain a popular desert treat when in season in late\
  \ summer and early autumn. Dowmberries grow best in arid climates and grow all over\
  \ the eastern side of the Aspodell Mountains and Wolfrun Hills. <br><b>Elderwood\
  \ Moss:</b> This semi-magical moss only grows on the oldest tree in a forest. As\
  \ such, two known patches exist near Darkmoon Vale: one upon the forest elder in\
  \ Darkmoon Wood and another on the Green Patriarch within Arthfell Forest. Elderwood\
  \ moss, when prepared correctly, acts as a strong decongestant. Some people claim\
  \ that, when prepared incorrectly, elderwood moss causes premature aging. <br><b>Glowmold:</b>\
  \ As its name implies, glowmold glows. Rather brightly, in fact. Glowmold grows\
  \ very slowly on the undersides of igneous rocks, and the largest concentrations\
  \ of this useful mold live for centuries under stones too large to easily flip or\
  \ roll over. Smaller finds provide as much light as a torch. Regardless of the size\
  \ of the moss colony, picked glowmold glows for 3 days once picked. <br><b>Ironbloom\
  \ Mushrooms:</b> These stunty fungi only grow in dark places thick with metal. The\
  \ diets of Five Kings Mountains dwarves consist heavily of ironbloom mushrooms,\
  \ mainly because the plants grow naturally in and around dwarven forges. Protein-rich\
  \ ironbloom mushrooms bear a slight salty taste but otherwise contain no flavor\
  \ of their own, making them excellent additions to many dwarven meals. <br><b>Pesh:</b>\
  \ This strong stimulant also has mild hallucinogenic properties, which together\
  \ make its users easily agitated and randomly aggressive (and easily identified,\
  \ with bloodshot eyes and frequent nosebleeds). Originally imported from Vudra,\
  \ pesh cacti grow in warm, moist areas, like those around the vale's mudpots and\
  \ hot springs. Wild pesh cacti threaten to choke out native species near the geothermal\
  \ vents. Outside of Katapesh, Darkmoon Vale is the largest supplier of pesh to nations\
  \ of Avistan. <br><b>Paueliel Trees:</b> These silver-barked softwoods grow to immense\
  \ heights, but never spread to more than a few feet in diameter. Lumberjacks claim\
  \ paueliel trees are somehow connected with elves and give copses of them wide berth\
  \ when logging. <br><b>Rat's Tail:</b> When pickled, this exceedingly salty root\
  \ acts as a mild analgesic. Used raw, rat's tail gives a strong salty flavor to\
  \ whatever dish it is added to. Many of the poor residents in Darkmoon Vale use\
  \ rat's tail to flavor their food, as salt remains out of the price range of most.\
