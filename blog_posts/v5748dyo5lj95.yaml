  >The <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season3\">Season of Plundered Tombs</a> is upon\
  \ us! Season 3 of the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>\
  \ just kicked off last week, so it's a good time to discuss the many <s>horrible</s>\
  \ <i>fun</i> things we have planned for it!</p> \n     <p>To integrate the Adventure\
  \ Card Guild with the Roleplaying Guild as part of the overall Pathfinder Society,\
  \ the ACG players are now Pathfinder agents, as explained in the introduction the\
  \ season, authored by John Compton:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Among\
  \ the region's most influential archaeological operations is the Pathfinder Society,\
  \ an international league of explorers and adventurers dedicated to discovering\
  \ and chronicling the world's mysteries. You recently completed your training as\
  \ a Pathfinder agent in Absalom and set out for Osirion, dreaming of the ancient\
  \ secrets buried beneath the sands and stone.</i></p> \n      <p><i>The archaeological\
  \ wealth of all Osirion will be yours to explore. What you uncover might not just\
  \ change your fortunes; it could change the world!</i></p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>You're going to get a chance to interact with many groups and characters\
  \ familiar to the Pathfinder Society. First among these is the Aspis Consortium,\
  \ a mercantile organization known for its ability to sniff out amazing, once-in-a-lifetime\
  \ opportunities without all the burden of scrupulous practices. The <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> includes several cards that have the Aspis trait,\
  \ so you'll get a chance to take full advantage of these extremely useful (and sometimes\
  \ costly) allies.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-AspisAgent.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-NeftiThebard_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>PFS players might recognize these Aspis agents from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy93m0\"></a></i><a href=\"/products/btpy93m0\">Destiny of the Sands</a>.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Relatively early in the season, you'll interact with the\
  \ Aspis trader Falsin Deek. Traders have a special role in Adventure Card Guild\
  \ scenarios:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-TraderRules.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-TraderRules_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>We like you so much, we wrote the trader rules TWICE.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This change is great for the Adventure Card Guild because\
  \ it lets you start each scenario with a card that's not in your class deck, and\
  \ helps you bring the flavor of Mummy's Mask to your Class Deck. This is particularly\
  \ important given the curses, the triggers, and the scads of elemental damage—all\
  \ things for which your deck might not be entirely ready.</p> \n     <p>There are\
  \ a couple other interesting ways we get to play with mechanics from Mummy's Mask.\
  \ For example, have you wondered about that Defensive Stance card in the Base Set\
  \ box? It will be a while yet before you'll use it in the Mummy's Mask Adventure\
  \ Path, but you'll get to use it early in Adventure 2 of Season of Plundered Tombs.\
  \ Are you getting used to defending against poison damage in Mummy's Mask? Well,\
  \ the enemies in Season of Plundered Tombs are a little more chaotic and destructive,\
  \ so are ready to use all kinds of damage types to trigger nasty scourges.</p> \n\
  \     <p>One of the most contentious tasks for the Pathfinder Society and Adventure\
  \ Card Game teams in development of this season was in choosing a name. Initially,\
  \ we assumed it'd be \"Season of the Mummy,\" to match up with the name of the box\
  \ set. But it turns out the story we wanted to tell, while full of Osirion goodies,\
  \ wasn't really about mummies in particular. We also want to move away from one-word\
  \ season names—we certainly don't want any more season names to be abbreviated \"\
  SotR\" after Season of the Righteous and Season of the Runelords! (Always helpful,\
  \ Mike suggested \"Season of Thundered Rooms.\")</p> \n     <p>We went back and\
  \ forth on a number of names, but the decision eventually came down to simple planning\
  \ for the future. We want to make a lot more seasons, so switching to two-word season\
  \ names gives us a lot more room for expansion. Also, the extremely wise guys at\
  \ Lone Shark Games immediately stumbled onto \"PluTo\" as a useful shortening of\
  \ <i>Plu</i>ndered <i>To</i>mbs, which lets us be happy with it as an endearing\
  \ animated pet and once-planet.</p> \n     <p>Honestly, Liz Spain, Paul Peterson,\
  \ and Gaby Weidling are a lot more inventive (read: crazy) than I am, so I'm not\
  \ sure I'll be able to measure up to the zany and bewildering antics of some of\
  \ their scenarios such as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9nd1\"><em>Adventure Deck 3: Shifting Sands</em></a>, but gosh darn\
  \ it, I'm going to try! Thankfully, Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge conscripted\
  \ a crack crew of legendary Paizo writers to help generate crazy ideas and write\
  \ the tasty story bits, in the form of John Compton, Amanda Hamon Kunz, Mark Seifter,\
  \ and Linda Zayas-Palmer.</p> \n     <p>Season of Plundered Tombs contains six adventures\
  \ with five scenarios each. Adventure titles and expected release dates follow:</p>\
  \ \n     <ol>\n      <li>Serpents in the Deep</li> \n      <li>Secrets below the\
  \ Sands</li> \n      <li>In Search of a Sage</li> \n      <li>Tomb of the Godless\
  \ Host</li> \n      <li>The Sepulcher Soars Anew</li> \n      <li>Destruction Descending</li>\n\
  \     </ol> \n     <p>As with earlier seasons, scenarios will be released weekly\
  \ to retailers participating in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild program, as\
  \ well as to Pathfinder Society Venture-Officers, before becoming available for\
  \ general sale as compiled adventures.</p> \n     <p>Here are the planned <b><i>Venture-Officer\
