                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">For the second time today, Ciravel found herself exceedingly grateful for seatbelts and stabilizers.</p> 
                   <p>The first moment of gratitude was during Iseph's dizzying, looping, headlong dash toward Daimalko's surface—a flight where they showed both their skill at threading the space between the enormous meteoroids that surrounded the planet and their delight at making Ciravel shut her eyes despite herself. Ciravel ran and reran the possibilities in her mind, certain that this was the course that resulted in a safe arrival to a canyon on the planet's surface, and yet she still found herself clutching her armrests and putting <em>just enough</em> tension against the straps holding her in to make sure that they would, in fact, hold. </p> 
                   <p>The second moment came thanks to the radiation drake who clamped its crystalline jaws around her hoverchair and shook its head back and forth as if in virulent disagreement with Ciravel's very existence—an action which, without the negation of the stabilizers, would be excruciating, since the surface of this portion of Daimalko unexpectedly lacked many things, including plant life, water, and, much to the chagrin of Ciravel's various joints, consistent gravity. Iseph had anchored themself to one of the rocks which floated above the planet's surface and was locked in combat with a second drake.</p> 
                   <p>"You could have warned me—"</p> 
                   <p>"—about the radiation? The drakes? The battlefield ruins? The asteroids? Did you—oof!—notice the radiation buffers that you were so reluctant to—ow!—pick up this morning? 'But I don't breathe!' Honestly—your head would fall off if I didn't remind you to bring a wrench! YOU could have warned me that you fly like a drunken moldstorm!"</p> 
                   <p>"Can we discuss this when we're not—" Iseph ducked as their drake snapped its jaws shut, barely missing the android and a sending a soft crystalline ring echoing through the canyon, "—about to be turned into scrapyard bits?"</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel closed her eyes and focused her power, channeling it through her extended hand. The possibilities for the drake's next action unfolded before her like cards laid out on a table. She knew what she had to do.</p> 
                   <p>"Iseph, count to ten."</p> 
                   <p><em>Wait for it…</em></p> 
                   <p>"Ciravel, this hardly seems the ideal time for numerical calculation—"</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel shifted her weight, angling her chair slightly as the drake clamped its jaws higher, sending the pistol in her side holster careening toward the rocky ruins below. One more good bite and it would have her.</p> 
                   <p>…Wait…</p> 
                   <p>"…Make that seven."</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>The drake's jaws opened momentarily as it repositioned its bite once more. In the precise moment where the drake's gullet was perfectly aligned, Ciravel turned her thrusters on full-force—right down the drake's throat. Its spine glowed with the intense blue flame before it gasped in pain and tumbled to the ground, releasing Ciravel's chair. Moments later, a rocky thud echoed through the canyon. </p> 
                   <p><em>Thank goodness for seat belts</em>, Ciravel thought once again as her chair careened wildly until the thrusters reoriented it. </p> 
                   <p>"Three…two…"</p> 
                   <p>She could see the drake's spine begin to glow again as it readied another beam. She was too far away. She needed more time.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel blinked her eyes, holding the battlefield in stasis as she bolted toward Iseph. </p> 
                   <p>"…one."</p> 
                   <p>Iseph startled slightly at the voice that was suddenly right next to them. Ciravel grabbed the blaster pistol from Iseph's belt and winked. She lifted her chair up and away from Iseph, aiming the pistol directly at the drake, trying to catch its attention and spin it away from Iseph, exposing a heavily wounded flank to their blade. The drake turned, lifting its wing, preparing to follow Ciravel. This time, she looped time into a knot, immediately making the drake forget her presence and leaving it distracted long enough for Iseph to drive their searing blade directly into its wounded gut.</p> 
                   <p>She knew it would cost her later—the exhaustion from this last effort would be brutal—but Ciravel dug deep and twisted time once more, calibrating the trajectory and moment that Iseph's blade entered the drake's thorax, ensuring that it hit every vital organ it could on the way in. The drake collapsed and tumbled to the ground below.</p> 
                   <p>"My pistol?" Iseph outstretched their arm.</p> 
                   <p>"Ah, the 'thanks for saving my circuits, Ciravel' must be a different time thread…" Ciravel maneuvered back toward the rock where Iseph had themselves anchored and winced slightly in pain as she handed back the weapon, stretching her neck. "I think maybe <em>I'll</em> drive home? But let's get our repairs done quickly…I'm sure the Recollectors aren't too far behind us, if they aren't already here." </p> 
                   <p>"Ciravel, perhaps we have sailed the canal that was left."</p> 
                   <p>"The <em>left</em> canal, Iseph. The saying is that you've sailed down the <em>right</em> canal when things go to plan, or the <em>left</em> canal when you cannot locate what you need. But yes, it certainly looks like we might have sailed quite far down the left canal, unfortunately."</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <p>She reached into one of the bags attached to the side of her hoverchair and pulled out a handle—which extended into a cane with a press of a button—and a tool kit, then released the safety belts attaching her to the chair. Activating the grav anchors on her boots and retracting the stabilizers, Ciravel stepped onto the hovering rock, and, leaning heavily on her cane, surveyed the damage to the chair. <em>Not too bad, considering the jaws</em>… </p> 
                   <p>Iseph pulled a medical kit from a belt pouch and began doing their own repairs to patch up their wounds—a cut here, a re-soldered circuit there. As Ciravel tightened bolts and reattached anything that had come loose from her chair in the fight, something gnawed at the back of her mind, but she brushed it away. The Recollectors were on their trail and they hadn't found any real clues to the cause of The Awakening, the cataclysm that decimated life on Daimalko. No hint to whether it was a natural event or an apocalyptic weapon used in the bitter war that used to rage on the planet. All Ciravel knew was that when she last held a fragment of rock that originated here, a specimen back in the xenobiology lab in Sovyrian, she tasted time—the only way she could describe the strange way that she suddenly smelled salt and citrus and tasted spiced honey whenever she encountered items from far in the past—a strange sensory activation that tied to her only childhood memory. A memory from the Gap. </p> 
                   <p>There hadn't been a whiff of anything other than sulfur and ozone since they arrived on Daimalko. But the way that rock had hummed in her ears…the song she had heard…what she'd heard…<em>what didn't I hear?</em></p> 
                   <p>"…Iseph, did you hear the impact of the second drake landing in the canyon?"</p> 
                   <p>"An impact? No…I heard an echo of jaws clashing and ringing, your weapon falling, the flames of your chair, the pistol firing, the screams…everything echoed back. But I did not hear a second impact of a drake on the canyon floor."</p> 
                   <p>In that moment, time unfolded for Ciravel as she registered three things. First: the air, which had reeked only of sulfur and centuries of decay, suddenly smelled of salt and citrus. The smell of Time, of the Gap. Second: the sudden darkness that fell when it had, only moments before, been glaringly bright. Night should have been nearly 30 hours away. And finally: the meaning of the absent sound of the drake's impact. Ciravel ran through the possibilities in a split second, and realization made her eyes go wide. </p> 
                   <p>"Um…Iseph?"</p> 
                   <p>"When I have finished repairing, Ciravel, I will assist you. It is already nightfall? We cannot waste our time tonight."</p> 
                   <p>"Iseph…look up. We'll make some extra time."</p> 
                   <p>The android glanced up from the wire they were reconnecting and then continued looking up, and up, and up the exoskeleton, watching in near-wonder as tendrils passed the drake corpse up…and up…and up…far higher than Ciravel's chair could reach on a day when it <em>hadn't</em> been rattled around in the jaws of a drake, past gargantuan claws and tusks.</p> 
                   <p>As her own eyes met the four beady ones of the Kyokor, Ciravel tasted spiced honey.</p> 
                   <p>She stared at the colossus, steadied herself back into her hoverchair, and activated the thrusters. She glided next to Iseph and looked over at them from beneath the creature's shadow, smiling.</p> 
                   <p>"Well, what do you know? Perhaps we sailed the right canal after all."</p>

                   <br> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available January 26, 2022:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Foundations-Price"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation's Price</em></a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02api?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-309-The-Secluded-Siege"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></a>*</p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aom?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-413-Hard-Reset"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-13: Hard Reset</em></a>*<br> <a href=""><em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em></a></p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Convention Organizing Committees</h2> 
                   <p>As we begin to plan our 2022 conventions, we’re seeking individuals interested in joining the organizing committees for our major shows! If you’re interested in helping to plan PaizoCon, Gen Con, or PaizoCon Europe, head over to <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shwv?Call-for-Organizing-Committee-Volunteers">last week’s blog post</a> and submit an application. Applications close tomorrow (Friday, January 7), so don’t delay! We hope to release information soon about our plans for these shows and how to volunteer as a GM.</p> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Fame Update</h2> 
                   <p>As of last Friday, Starfinder Fame has officially expired. Any lingering Fame you haven’t spent yet is space dust in the wind; be sure to record your final purchases in your records.</p> 
                   <p>All boon conversion tasks should be completed at this time as well. The <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq">Starfinder Society FAQ</a> has been updated with the information on converting certain boons to Fame; please refer players to that page if they have questions.</p> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p>Last month, we announced that we would be adding <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></a> to the Nova qualification list; however, a paragraph was inadvertently omitted from the blog post. Rather than sneak it in, I decided to save it for this post and announce that <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4z"><em>SFS #1-39: The Herald’s War</em></a> will be retired from Nova qualification. As of <b>March 1, 2022</b>, any future runs of that scenario will not count as Specials for the purpose of Nova qualification. This grace period is intended to allow any GMs who had already been planning to run the scenario for credit to do so before we close the door. We don’t intend to retire any future scenarios from Nova qualification—this scenario was always a stopgap until we had enough scenarios in the requisite level ranges.</p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>With the office quiet for the holidays, we were able to take advantage of our lighter workloads and really blast through the outstanding sanctioning tasks! The following rulebooks and adventures have been <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">sanctioned for play</a> since last month: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2"><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em></a> Adventure Path, and rules options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/agentsOfEdgewatch"><em>Agents of Edgewatch</em> Adventure Path</a> (via the Achievement Points system). For Starfinder, we harnessed the power of the precog, and can announce that we have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aow?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a> ready to go for its street date!</p> 
                   <p>We’ve also got some sanctioning in the pipeline that’s not quite ready yet, but watch the @PaizoOrgPlay Twitter feed for sanctioning announcements, or check back here next month.</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Glyph for Pathfinder Society (second edition)!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Glyph</b> - Tim Ayers</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GM, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you’ve achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the new year!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“You stand defeated, Voradni Voon!” Melika shouted, brandishing her tin sword at Elophos. The older actor bellowed, throwing his hands up in a defiant gesture meant to cover a quick tightening of the straps holding on his minotaur horns, which had begun to slide dangerously sideways.</p> 
                   <p>“Never!” Elophos cried, trotting back a few showy steps as he finished steadying his headgear. Horns secured, he charged forward again, thrusting his sword at Melika. “So long as he stands, Voradni Voon is not defeated!”</p> 
                   <p>“The earth has swallowed your army. Your centaurs are dead, your harpies scattered like frightened pigeons. Surrender!” Melika jabbed at Elophos’s midsection. The thrust was absurdly slow and clumsy—old Halvorash would have boxed her ears for signaling the lunge with her eyes and feet so long before she struck—but the flaws that would have doomed her in an alley fight were virtues on the stage. An audience wasn’t a footpad with a shank; you were <em>supposed</em> to help them see what was coming.</p> 
                   <p>“Voradni Voon will devour your heart and claim your godhood, puny human!” Elophos roared, swinging his stubby sword in broad arcs. Both actors’ weapons were shortened, letting them maximize the number of swings they could make before reaching each other onstage. Melika was impressed that Elophos managed to fit six full arcs in before he closed on her. He must have tweaked his pacing; he’d only ever managed five before.</p> 
                   <p>She dropped to one knee, exaggerating the height difference between them, and thrust upward, gripping her abbreviated sword’s hilt with both hands like a spear. Another absurdity for the stage, but it roused an anticipatory cheer from the audience, and then an expectant hush.</p> 
                   <p>Elophos didn’t disappoint them. Menacingly he stalked forward, having backed away in mock apprehension as Melika crouched. He charged straight onto the up-thrust point, then staggered back with a thunderous gasp, his sword arm pinwheeling in feigned death agonies. “Nooo!”</p> 
                   <p>“You would not stand defeated, Voradni Voon, so you must fall,” Melika intoned, striking a heroic pose, as Elophos crumpled slowly to the stage boards, clutching the blade “impaled” into his chest to keep it from falling.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The audience burst into cheers. Elophos skipped back to his feet, handed Melika her sword, and shared a bow as the curtains came down. No sooner had the gold-fringed cloth dropped over them than they hopped down the back stairs, moving aside so the stage crew could clear their painted scenery and set up the next troupe’s props.</p> 
                   <p>Already, the painted wooden harpies and centaurs from <em>The Defeat of Voradni Voon</em> were being loaded onto wagons to be carted away for storage. They’d performed the act six times today, moving from stage to stage across Absalom, and now they were done. The sun was sinking westward, and night was soon to drop a final curtain on Foundation Day.</p> 
                   <p>It had been glorious—but now, already, Melika felt the warmth of the crowds and her own joy stealing away from her as swiftly as the fading light.</p> 
                   <p>Melika sighed. She pulled off the papier-mache crown and false mustache she’d worn as Aroden, unhooked the gaudy, gold-lined cape that she’d swirled through six victories over Voradni Voon, and folded them up, along with her dreams, inside the box that Elophos’s troupe would soon pack away.</p> 
                   <p>She wasn’t an actor, not really, not like the rest of them. Melika was just a serving girl. That morning, she’d been carrying a pitcher of wash water through the commons, just as the visiting troupe learned that their original Aroden was chained to her chamber pot following an encounter with a bad eel pie.</p> 
                   <p>As the actors were absorbing the bad news, one of the inn’s cats ran under Melika’s feet. She’d jumped, side-stepped, and recovered without spilling a drop. This impromptu demonstration led Elophos to conclude that she was strong and nimble enough to handle the fight choreography, about the right size to fit into Aroden’s costume, and therefore an adequate substitute for the show that they were contractually obligated to put onstage in two hours.</p> 
                   <p>“You’ll have ten lines,” he’d told her as he buckled the green-gold cape around her shoulders and pasted the horsehair mustache onto her face. “You can do it. Ten lines, and it doesn’t even matter if you get them wrong.”</p> 
                   <p>She hadn’t gotten them wrong. Six times she’d performed, each better than the last, as she learned to draw out the crowd and channel its energy into joy.</p> 
                   <p>And now it was over. Playing at the actor’s life had been fun, but Melika had siblings to feed and a sickly mother to tend. That painted crown wasn’t real gold, and it wouldn’t keep her family clothed.</p> 
                   <p>Heroism seemed so simple on stage. Maybe that was what people really liked to cheer, more than Aroden: the uncomplicated surety of right and wrong. The odds were stacked, the lines were scripted, and the heroes of legend never had anyone but themselves to think about. Their families were always conveniently faraway or dead—or at the very least, dependent on the same dramatic acts that the hero was already poised to commit.</p> 
                   <p>Heroes on a stage didn’t have to be quietly reliable for those they loved. Their bravado was just like their fighting: showy and false, with none of the dirt or desperation that grimed real struggle.</p> 
                   <p>Melika sighed. Though false, the dream was tempting. It surely was a pretty crown. And she’d probably never again touch cloth as fine as that cloak’s, stained and threadbare though it was.</p> 
                   <p>“You alright?” Elophos asked, vigorously toweling his sweat-matted hair. Six mock fights under the heavy, horned pelt of Voradni Voon had left him soaked.</p> 
                   <p>“I need to get back to work,” Melika told him.</p> 
                   <p>He counted out the money, then paused. “It’s Foundation Day. You don’t have the day off to celebrate?”</p> 
                   <p>“Someone has to work for other people to celebrate,” Melika pointed out, dryly, but only after she’d pocketed the coin. You didn’t talk back before you got their money. “You didn’t think all those mugs of beer poured or washed themselves, did you?” It occurred to her that maybe he <em>did</em> think that. Nobody had ever said that actors were overburdened with good sense.</p> 
                   <p>Elophos just shrugged. “But it’s Foundation Day.”</p> 
                   <p>“It is. So I should get back. They’ll need me.”</p> 
                   <p>“You could stay with us. Be an actor. You’re a natural on stage.”</p> 
                   <p>“For less than what I earn now?” Melika snorted. She’d worked hard for that inn job. Decent pay, extra food, sometimes clothes or even boots that drunk patrons left behind. If Elophos had ever been half as cold and hungry as she’d been before the inn, he would know what it meant to give that up.</p> 
                   <p>“It might not be less. Not for long.” His speculative look was greedy enough that she almost believed him. “You’ve got talent.”</p> 
                   <p>“Talent and a houseful of hungry siblings. Guess which one yells louder.”</p> 
                   <p>“Well, think about it.” Elophos tossed the towel over his shoulder. “A lot of us will be headed to the Wounded Wisp after sundown, if you think you can get away from washing those beer mugs for a bit. Talk to some people. Make some friends. Perhaps you’ll see that the stage pays well enough to keep a houseful of hungry siblings fed.”</p> 
                   <p>“Maybe.” Melika walked away, through the thronging crowds of revelers, other people’s joy and laughter scattered around her like flower petals. She didn’t begrudge their happiness. It meant good tips.</p> 
                   <p>And as she walked, she turned Elophos’s suggestion around and around, like a coin in her pocket she was debating how to spend. Maybe she did have talent. Maybe she could feed her family that way. Maybe it wasn’t stupid to spend an hour finding out.</p> 
                   <p>The Wounded Wisp...</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">They’d landed on a port moon to rehaul their ship before rendezvousing with the rest of the Pact World diplomatic team on a newly discovered world called Sigerro. A routine enough stop, but then, even in Near Space, the routine could quickly turn to excitement.</p> 
                   <p>Zemir and Raia, part of the command team, were sent to find upgraded Drift drives for their ship. The thought was that Raia’s eye for tech would aid in finding the best equipment and Zemir’s tendency to bend chance might allow them to purchase it at a low price. </p> 
                   <p>The technomancer and witchwarper debated the differences between their respective talents while perusing the port’s open-air markets. </p> 
                   <p>“Our methods differ only in scope. You use your gifts to push technology,” said Zemir, tossing another faulty circuit board into a display case, “whereas I use mine to push reality.”</p> 
                   <p>“Your scope may be wider,” said Raia, examining some drive schematics absently. “But my tech produces more reliable results.”</p> 
                   <p>“Reliability is irrelevant. In the end, we seek the same thing—the new, impossible, the interesting. Is how we do it so important?”</p> 
                   <p>“Some would say the ‘how’ is the most important part of all,” Raia answered, smiling. It was an old debate between friends, one they’d cheerfully had over drinks in many a space port. </p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps you’re right,” said Zemir quietly. Raia recognized that faraway look. One day she’d learn the cause of Zemir’s periodic melancholy. </p> 
                   <p>Before Zemir could say more, the market fell eerily silent. Everyone around them stared upward. Zemir and Raia joined them, and watched as the moon eclipsed the sun, and all went dark.</p> 
                   <p>Soon after, the chittering squeaks and clicks began.</p> 
                   <p>“I recognize those sounds,” said Raia. “Grioths.”</p> 
                   <p>“What, this far in Near Space?” asked Zemir. </p> 
                   <p>“They get closer every year,” said Raia sadly. She found grioths a fascinating formation of life. It’s too bad so many of them were in the monstrous grip of Nyarlathotep, for their voidglass technology and biology was quite interesting and could be put to great use in the Pact Worlds.</p> 
                   <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by holes opening in the moon-eclipsed sky. From these shadowy portals descended a wave of winged terrors. The grioths’ silhouettes looked like thousands of bats with arms and legs—all of which held glittering weaponry.</p> 
                   <p>The technomancer and the witchwarper watched the marketgoers flee. In silent agreement, both stood still amid the chaos, knowing they could hold off the grioths and allow these citizens to get to safety. </p> 
                   <p>Several grioth raiders noticed the two holding their ground and broke off to attack them. Raia picked off one with a single blaster pulse while Zemir stared at another and muttered. Suddenly, the grioth’s wing seized and it plummeted to the ground. That left three more, who charged in a whirl of chittering squeaks and gleaming, deadly glass. </p> 
                   <p>A fourth landed in front of Raia and swiped at her with its giant, clawed hand.</p> 
                   <p>“No,” said Raia calmly, stepping back and raising her hands. She felt composed, as though in a simulation. She had spent the better part of the afternoon familiarizing herself with the tech around her, and now she simply had to put it to work, albeit for a new purpose.</p> 
                   <p>As the grioth tried to grasp her again, she cast a spell with a word and a gesture. Behind her, the vast engine powering the veranda block rumbled and cracked. Suddenly, as though it were a puppet pulled by the technomancer’s strings, it unleashed from its casing and wrapped the grioth in an unbreakable embrace of steel and coiled wire.</p> 
                   <p>Zemir watched his friend fight and wondered how best to aid her in the dance. He was no slouch with a blade, but with so many opponents, more help was needed. </p> 
                   <p>What if, perhaps, another portal opened? One to a world filled with bright sunlight? Zemir pondered the possibilities and adjusted probabilities as though inputting calculations into the ultimately unknowable machine that was the universe. Calculations that, due to his training at the institute, he sometimes knew the outcomes for.</p> 
                   <p>A bright portal to a sun-filled world opened, a world with—yes, perfect—a swarm of apari constituents, who poured from the portal, angry and hungry. The grioths shrieked at the light, some clutching their faces as its very photons pierced their psychic defenses. At Zemir’s direction, the apari swarm crashed against the grioths like a wave, instinctively trying to strike back against invaders who would darken a world. </p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“You will all perish for the glory of our dark master,” whispered one of grioth invaders with a harsh rasp. Before he could say more, he was overwhelmed by the swarm of apari.</p> 
                   <p>He could have run—but he wouldn’t. Helping Raia made it worth it; knowing that, in some small way, Zemir had adjusted his account, paying back what he’d done wrong. He might never be able to atone for leaving his friends in that other reality, might never be able to get them back (though another part of him still wondered about this) but here, now, at least he and his friend Raia could save each other. </p> 
                   <p>Together, weaving reality and technology with threads of magic, the technomancer and witchwarper beat back the remaining two grioth attackers, their martial prowess no match for the pair’s magical mastery. </p> 
                   <p>“We have to get to the ship,” said Zemir once they had a moment to catch their breath. “I can open a gateway there, but I’ve expended a lot of power and can only take myself.”</p> 
                   <p>“Go. I know you won’t leave me behind,” said Raia. For some reason, Zemir looked inexplicably sad at that.</p> 
                   <p>“I will come back for you,” Zemir promised gravely. He stepped through the portal and was gone. </p> 
                   <p>Raia waited, holding glowing sigils and technical weapons in the dark marketplace. From the chittering and squeaks, she knew another squad of grioths was inbound. With all the tech around her, Raia knew she could hold them off, but not indefinitely. She just hoped that Zemir would get back with the ship in time. </p>

                   <p>It will probably come as a surprise to no one that my biggest sci-fi influences are largely comedic. I mean, when faced with yawning infinite void of space, you just have to laugh, right? For me, it probably started with <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> in all its forms: books, radio play, text adventure, BBC series, and eventually, major motion picture. There’s something so relatable about a hapless Earthling being thrust into a galactic adventure of stolen spaceships, time travel, and bureaucracy. From there, I would find Space Quest (featuring the first space janitor?), <em>Red Dwarf </em>(“Everybody’s. Dead. Dave.”), <em>Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon</em> (though that series is more a vehicle for puns than anything else), and Futurama (best math jokes in the biz!). The goofier episodes of <em>The X-Files</em> and <em>Farscape</em> are among my favorite. More recently, <em>Galaxy Quest</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> have taken their shots at that most venerable of sci-fi institutions, Star Trek. Much of comedic sci-fi lovingly pokes fun at its own genre or points at the foibles of the present through a sci-fi lens. And that’s the kind of influence I try to bring to Starfinder when appropriate. Our iconic biohacker hosts a family-friendly science-oriented vidshow that often leads to more danger than it should. A group of skittermanders rescue their vesk boss from a dangerous massage machine. I love adding those sorts of touches, and I hope you enjoy them too! I can’t wait for you to see what’s next!</p>

                   <p>My dad got me into science fiction at an early age, with Heinlein’s <em>Rocket Ship Galileo</em>. Heinlein wrote a YA science fiction novel every year, just in time for Christmas. It was a smart strategy. I don’t know how many of those books I read: <em>Have Spacesuit Will Travel</em>, <em>The Star Beast</em>, <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em>. In high school, I had my first actual class on science fiction, which introduced me to everything from Asimov and John Carter to <em>Riverworld</em> and Chalker’s <em>Well of Souls</em>; predictably, my final project was a Well of Souls wargame I designed myself. In fact, by this point, my science fiction intake was starting to be determined as much by games as by novels; I spent my rainy days pouring over <em>Traveler’s Imperium</em>, rolling random mutations in <em>Gamma World</em>, and playing <em>Star Fleet Battles</em>. When I got to college, I wandered the campus bookstore looking for stuff I’d never heard of before, and that got me to Phil Dick’s <em>Man in the High Castle</em> and the <em>Mirrorshades</em> anthology, which broke open the cyberpunk genre. It took me a couple of tries to figure out Dune. As a graduate student, I studied science fiction under the great and much-missed Dr. George Slusser, curator of the University of California Riverside’s Eaton Collection, one of the largest collections of SF in the world. One day, on my way out of class, I told Slusser, “You know, I want your job.” He said to me, “Stick around here long enough, you might get it.” When he passed in 2014, I applied for that gig. I didn’t get it, but no regrets. Now, I get to make science fiction instead of curate it, and some of the things I’ve made are on the shelves of the Eaton Collection. I’ll take that deal.</p>

                   <p>We’re standing next to each other at a convention. It’s loud and crowded here in the dealer hall, but we’ve identified one another as fellow sci-fi nerds; the awkward serendipity when two weirdos recognize each other in the wild. We’ve been existing in a pandemic for two years at this point so we desperately want to chat with someone new, so we’re eager to start a conversation. Our hobby is our common ground, so we start talking about favorite works of sci-fi. You list the various novels, video games, and films that first connected you to a network of other minds imagining extraordinary realities. I tell you I’m inspired by the works of Yoko Taro, Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Tade Thompson, and the Strugatsky brothers. Then you ask one of those classic icebreaker questions: Which Star Trek is your favorite?</p>

                   <p>I shrug. I’m not really into Star Trek, but I watched some with my parents growing up. (Star Wars’ western vibe was always more my jam, but my dad’s a certified trekkie.) So I tell you that my favorite is Voyager. Why? You ask. You’re correctly assuming Captain Janeway has something to do with it. We rewind to my childhood. When my parents began watching Voyager, I was an awkward girl with scabbed knees and an unflattering bowl cut. During the show’s run, I transformed from invisible tomboy to sullen preteen. I hated my body and wasn’t comfortable with the changes puberty was enforcing on it. I didn’t agree with everything I saw in the world around me. I was powerless to change anything and waiting for my real life to begin. Enter Seven of Nine, a badass with a crisp Federation uniform and stylish pixie cut. She was everything I dreamed of becoming. In her, I saw the future.</p> 
                   <p>But she was more than a childhood role model for me. Even though I never watched the entire series, Seven’s narrative first sparked my interest in telling stories that explore the definition of humanity and the nature of the soul. She was concrete evidence of a feminine person driving her own narrative. And there were others like her. Ripley, Sarah Connor, General Leia, and (much later) Furiosa became favorite characters and visions of powerful femininity, canonized as goddesses in a new pantheon. I expect that of all my space heroines, Seven of Nine had the deepest influence on me. </p> 
                   <p>Now, imagine yourself back in the convention hall. You listen politely to my explanation and we gush about our favorite sci-fi characters for few more minutes. I ask you another question, maybe about video games, and the ice is broken. We chat for a while. We say goodbye and head off to our next destinations, happy to have met and befriended a fellow nerd.</p> 
                   <p>But, I digress. This is a blog about sci-fi in general, not “POV: you meet me at a convention.” Sci-fi works have had such an influence on my life, and it’s pretty amazing to be able to call myself a sci-fi creator now. When experiencing sci-fi, we can dream of other worlds near and far. We can hope for a bright solarpunk future and try to write it into being, or examine the great conflicts of our own lives, our fears, our struggles, through a lens that allows others to understand us better. Thanks to all of you for your interest in other worlds, and expect the aliens, philosophical machines, mechs, and space shenanigans to continue. </p>

                   <p>When I look back at this year, I think the theme is resilience through uncertainty. Between shipping crises (remember when the boat was stuck? good times!), the ongoing pandemic, and shakeups at Paizo, this year has been tumultuous, to say the least. But this is the best community out there, and you all have rolled with the punches, adapted to the new terrain, and kept playing with us. I can’t thank you all enough for everything, and I can’t wait to see you all in 2022.</p> 
                   <p>Before I leave you, I have a message from Mike Kimmel to share.</p> 
                   <hr width="50%"> 
                   <p>Hey everyone! The end of the calendar year also marks the end of my first year on the Organized Play team. It’s been a year filled with challenges, rewards, and adventures. One of my fondest memories of the year was being able to write my first adventure outline for Paizo, which led to a little bounty called Hillcross Roundup. I’m looking forward to outlining and developing more adventures and tackling more challenges in the months ahead. Later this year, we’ll be wrapping up the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries and jumping into Year 4. I can’t wait to share these exciting adventures with you! I hope I’ll have opportunities to meet and interact with more members of the community in 2022, whether that’s online, in person, or both. I want to hear all about your adventures!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“A new game?” Kesara asked, her old Vudrani hands already sweeping the drouge pieces off the embroidered cloth, milk-pale jade and black onyx figurines vanishing like magician’s coins between her bony fingers.</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai shrugged, smiling, and uncapped his flask of blackdream liqueur. He waved it at Kesara, chuckling when she wrinkled her nose in disgust at the offer, as she always did. Unoffended, Guan Kai sipped the murky, anise-scented drink. “What choice do I have? You’ve cleared the board. Just when I was winning, too.”</p> 
                   <p>“There was no winning that game.” Kesara dealt new pieces onto the cloth with the swift flourishes of a professional gambler, which Guan Kai supposed she was, after a fashion. “This one will be better. New pieces, new board. Very friendly.” With a motion, Kesara substituted the black jackals from the original set with a pair of lions from her near-inexhaustible supply of alternate pieces. Playfully, she set two pennies carefully on the lions’ heads like little copper crowns, then spun them with a flick of her fingertips. The metal disks twirled momentarily atop the figures before clattering dully onto the cloth.</p> 
                   <p><em>So</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>she wants to bargain a secret about some instability in Taldor.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Speaking of friends,” Kesara asked casually, “do you still have yours in the Chrysanthemum Court?”</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai took another pull from his flask. “Naturally. A man as old as I either has no friends, or too many to count. One’s habits add up to the sum of one’s life, as the sages say.”</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                    <h3>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens.</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“Do they? I wouldn’t know. I’m a dewy spring blossom, myself.” Kesara’s eyes vanished into her wrinkles when she laughed. She plucked the white jade elephants from the board and made a show of hesitating before she replaced them. “Now which of my little pieces would best serve your side? I presume, after a lifetime’s likeability, you could name 16 close friends in the Court?”</p> 
                   <p>She was feeling him out, trying to see which of the Successor States of Lung Wa might offer the best price for her information. Guan Kai pretended to ignore the bait. It was ridiculous for him to offer anything; Kesara hadn’t even hinted what secret she was trying to sell. How could he know who wanted it? “I’m an easy man to like. Even in Shenmen, I might find a few friends.”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh, no, not Shenmen. Just the name of that haunted place gives me chills.”</p> 
                   <p>“No need to worry. It’s very far from here.” Information about the Imperial Court of Taldor was unlikely to be of value to the Successor States, he meant.</p> 
                   <p>“The Court isn’t far at all.” Kesara lifted her chin, nodding to the high white tower of the Starstone Cathedral behind them. “Just on the other side of that great gaudy sundial.”</p> 
                   <p>Ah, so her secret wasn’t being dangled for the Successor States themselves, but for their envoys. The Chrysanthemum Court was the unofficial embassy for dignitaries from all the many kingdoms of Tian Xia. Business that was too risky or sordid to pass through diplomatic channels often wound up there.</p> 
                   <p>This game had suddenly become more interesting. Guan Kai took another sip from his flask, then capped it with a flourish and set it aside. His blood was warm enough without the liquor. “I can hardly choose a piece without seeing the sample available for selection.”</p> 
                   <p>“I suppose that’s fair.” Rather than offering him a choice of white pieces, however, Kesara plucked an onyx boar from her case and set it between the lions. It was an ugly, pugnacious thing, its glittering tusks thrust out in belligerent menace.</p> 
                   <p>Baronet Ghazolain. His family crest carried a boar against crossed spears, and he’d recently arrived in Absalom as part of the Taldan diplomatic delegation. Scarcely a month had passed since the baronet arrived in the City at the Center of the World, yet already foul rumors followed him. Tales abounded of stained altars covered in clandestine artifacts, inhuman chants and cries from his quarters at night, and grim-faced servants who nursed unexplained wounds and then disappeared altogether.</p> 
                   <p>Or so people said. Guan Kai had learned to dismiss most such rumors—they were true only rarely, and useful even less. But now, it made sense why Kesara was angling for a buyer from the Successor States: the baronet was also said to be urgently litigating some kind of family claim in Amanadar, a former Taldan colony now counted among the 16 Successor States of Lung Wa.</p> 
                   <p>“Interesting,” Guan Kai said. “I would have thought the boar should go on my side.”</p> 
                   <p>“I assure you, the boar is opposed to any piece you might choose,” Kesara said. Her rheumy eyes were sharp and intense beneath their clouds of age as she split her fingers into a triangle around the boar’s head. An old sign, from when they’d first played at spycraft, as children.</p> 
                   <p><em>Danger</em>. Danger that would seize your throat and twist your head off without trying.</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai smiled. “Really? Fascinating. Then I shall choose a devil, for a beast so fearsome deserves an equally formidable foe.” He’d kept his answer malleable on purpose. The devil could certainly represent Chu Ye, ruled by oni, but it could just as easily mean Cheliax. The Western devil-binders were always willing to pay for dangerous secrets, even those that didn’t concern them.</p> 
                   <p>Kesara shook her head. Her gaze lingered on a pair of dogs pulling a wagon in the street. The animals greeted one another cheerfully, interrupting their own work to wag tails and exchange sniffs. “Look there, behind you. Some creatures understand the value of loyalty. Some people, too. I said this should be a friendly game—you’d be well advised to keep only true friends on your board, and fiends are never that. But, of course, you’re free to choose the pieces that suit your strategy. I can only make suggestions.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Ah, so</em>. Guan Kai felt peculiarly warmed by Kesara’s warning. Seventy years they’d played the game together, though she owed him no favors. They’d been rivals as often as allies, and each had betrayed the other far too many times for any attempt at tallying to be worthwhile.</p> 
                   <p>Still, in this, she warned him. This information was too explosive to be entrusted to treacherous hands.</p> 
                   <p>And now he understood. Kesara didn’t want to sell her secret after all. She wanted help. Baronet Ghazolain was involved in something so terrible that the 10,000 whisperers of Jalmeray were reaching out to Guan Kai, and his friends, for aid. And they were sending that request as secretly as they knew how, lest the baronet’s spies catch a whisper of their plea.</p> 
                   <p>“Very well,” Guan Kai said. “I choose the dragon and the rat.”</p> 
                   <p>Kesara nodded. A tiny knot of tension softened in her shoulders. <em>She must be terrified</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>if her worry shows so plainly</em>.</p> 
                   <p>But Kesara had spent 70 years learning to control such fear, and her voice was calm as aloe. “Let our game begin.”</p>

                   <h3>Dana Ebert</h3> 
                   <p>Hi there! It's Dana Ebert (she/her), and I'm so excited to be back so soon! In <em>Monsters of Myth</em>, I took on Desert's Howl, which first appeared in <em>Mythical Monsters Revisited</em> almost ten years ago. This version expands on Jalari's story, while reimagining Desert's Howl as a unique monster with brand new lore and abilities for Second Edition.</p> 
                   <p>I honestly adore the final stat block for Desert's Howl. I conceptualized its abilities with the intent of using mechanics to convey the feeling of being hunted and toyed with, and this version is simply vicious at denying the player characters rest and recovery in between encounters with the creature. With the release of this book, I hope that there'll be a few more Desert's Howl fans in the future!</p> 
                   <p>As always, thank you so much for reading and making this community such a wonderful place! If you use Desert's Howl or any of its lore in your campaign (I'm very fond of Jalari's treasure coins, myself), I would love to hear about it on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG">https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG</a>). And if you ever want to know more about what I'm currently working on, you can find that information on my Linktree (<a href="https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG">https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG</a>).</p>

                   <h3>Sen.H.H.S</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, readers and greetings from Sen.H.H.S., your freelancer who lives across the Pacific Ocean from North America. You may have seen me around in projects such as Bestiary 3, Ruby Phoenix's Goka Gazetteer, <em>Secret of Magic</em>, and many other publications. For <em>Monsters of Myth</em>, I wrote the kaijus. When this assignment first came down, I was internally screaming because my gods, the pressure to deliver! Just how am I going to do these gigantic walking natural or supernatural disasters justice? After copious amounts of kaiju wikia consumption and kaiju movie clips (Pacific Rim is the best movie ever!) I hope the end result is as awe-inspiring (or horror-inspiring) as intended. If you’re interested in knowing what I'm up to recently in the TTRPG sphere, follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a> where I bemoan how my current reading list of forensic textbooks is raising eyebrows. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Aaron Lascano</h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Aaron, and I wrote and designed rules for two sections in <em>Monsters of Myth</em>: Kuworsys and Somnalu. I had an absolute blast working on both of them, as I did a bit of research and reading of epic myth to prepare (a quick recommendation: <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is a genuinely incredible read). I’m fascinated by how myths are remembered, and how interpretations and treatments of myth change over time. I hope my sections even encourage players to do a bit of that themselves.</p> 
                   <p>With Kuworsys, I had the opportunity to craft a new story around a pre-existing location, and with Somnalu, I got to contribute to the story of a legendary figure from Pathfinder’s past. I’m very excited for players to explore the ever-shifting ruins of Kuworsys’s labyrinth and to descend into the depths to confront slithering Somnalu.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested, you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/devlascano">@devlascano</a>. I make narrative-focused TTRPGs on Itch and I do freelance work on games whenever an opportunity arises. Cheers! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                   <p>Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, writer of xulgaths and quite a few other monsters at this point. For this project, I worked alongside Josh Kim and Liane Merciel. Josh wrote Kothogaz’s lore, and turning that into rules was an exciting challenge. I wanted a big, campaign-ending abomination to have more ‘breadth’ in the story than just the confrontation where you hope to kill it. For the Melfesh Monster, I just got to read through Liane’s fantastic work and pluck out tidbits to turn into monster abilities—she gave me a ton to work with!</p> 
                   <p>Beyond my co-authors, I want to give a special thanks to my cousin Sameer Gupta. He’s a talented musician who focuses on American jazz and Indian classical music. Given Kothogaz’s ties to Vudra, it was important that I do right by any real-world Indian cultural aspects I used for inspiration. Without Sameer, the Craft Disharmonic Instrument and Raga of Remembrance sections wouldn’t be nearly as flavorful, interesting, or accurate. You can check him out <a href="https://sameergupta.com/press-quotes-artist-bio/">on his website</a>, and across social media as <a href="https://twitter.com/tablajazz">@tablajazz</a>. I also highly recommend his album “A Circle Has No Beginning”—it’s gotten me through a lot of late night deadline pushes!</p>

                   <h3>Shay Snow</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow (they/them), I'm an editor at Paizo, and I wrote up the Kallas Devil and partnered with the extremely talented Liane Merciel to stat up Ulgrem-Axaan! I hope my skipping rhyme and lovely letters bring you lots of shivers, and I hope you enjoy all of the neat things that both the Kallas Devil and Ulgrem-Axaan can do for your games! You may have seen me in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, and I have a few things coming out in <em>Galactic Magic</em>. Additionally, you can find my name on a few Coyote &amp; Crow projects!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You can keep up with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href="https://shayjay.carrd.co/">https://shayjay.carrd.co/</a>!</p>

I’m really excited for this book because I got to draw from Korean mythology and tradition to bring you the Taljjae, a creature inspired by the real-life mask dancing of Korea, and hopefully a cool addition to your games. You can find me streaming video games here (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup">https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup</a>), my work here (<a href="https://literalsoup.com/">https://literalsoup.com/</a>), listen to my podcast here (<a href="http://absoluteterritorycast.com/">http://absoluteterritorycast.com/</a>), or contact me about business inquiries at literalsoup@gmail.com." </p>

Whether you celebrate Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, First Choices, Winterbloom, Festivus, or Christmas—whether your holidays are done for the year or just beginning—we hope you’re spending the close of the year surrounded by your chosen family, friends, and loved ones. Here at Organized Play, we’re hunkered down for the year.

                   <p>As a special winter treat, I wanted to share this field report from one of our Venture Captains about a recent holiday charity event. Take it away, Nicholas!</p>

                   <p>For the last three holiday seasons, VC Nicholas Ruchlewicz has organized charity events for his local lodge to help others. The Toys for Tots program is a wonderful way to get into the holiday spirit and help those in need! </p> 
                   <p>This year, the charity event expanded from a single local lodge in Fairfax to multiple REGIONS! Obviously, during covid time, everyone has become more flexible with hybrid events—so this event had a physical presence organized by Northern Virginia Venture Captain Nicholas and Baltimore Venture Lieutenant Nathan, plus online offerings including VOs from other lodges a bit further from the DC area. This year, the VOs directly engaged our Friendly Local Game Stores (FLGS). We have all been through difficult times with the pandemic, including many of the small businesses that support our players in a safe, welcoming environment. The community was able to support the amazing charity by purchasing toys and books at the FLGS and immediately donating them to the onsite Toys for Tots boxes.</p> 
                   <p>On 12/11/2021, Pathfinders participated in interactive special PF2 #3-99 Fate in the Future at the Cayden’s Keg convention. This charity event added 7 physical tables to the 19 online tables! In addition to the physical toy donations, the raffle ticket sales provided an additional $1320+ donation to the cause. </p> 
                   <p>Below are the locations and Venture officers in each FLGS! If you are ever near one of our lodges, please visit their business—we can’t thank our community enough! </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">As the white-bearded man casually strolled across the rainy courtyard, shadowy figures kept pace with him atop the buildings surrounding the square. The older man didn’t seem aware of the dark shapes stalking him, first from a distance, then closer, along his path. Nor did he show surprise when the ruffians stepped out of the shadows, blades glinting. The tallest of the black-clad figures spoke with a low growl.</p> 
                   <p>“Shouldn’t have gotten involved in War Hounder business, old man. We don’t like folks asking questions about our dealings!”</p> 
                   <p><em>“Well,</em>” Ezren thought to himself, “<em>it’s about time</em>.”</p> 
                   <p>Though confident in his preparations, the wizard still summoned some basic defenses as the War Hounders cautiously approached. A mage’s armor was, in his opinion, properly made of magic. He layered a <em>shield</em> spell atop it for good measure.</p> 
                   <p>One of the ruffians flung a dagger at Ezren as the rest moved to cut off his escape routes… which he had no intention of taking.</p> 
                   <p>“I’ve been trying to get your attention for some time,” Ezren said calmly as the knife bounced off his arcane shield. Unsurprisingly, the War Hounders ignored him. Ezren knew they were aware of his wizardly training and understood their desire to take him out quickly. If this had been a remotely fair fight, they’d be doing the right thing. </p> 
                   <p>Ezren did his best to avoid “fair” fights, though. A fair fight was the result of poor research, and he prided himself on his scholarship.</p> 
                   <p>His two fastest attackers were a scarred human and a dwarf; each wielding sword and dagger. Ezren reviewed a range of possible replies before settling on a simple lightning cantrip. Not fully powered, something in the mid-range he knew they’d survive. He wanted to deliver a message and getting the dead to deliver messages was more… problematic.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren concentrated on the essence of lightning as he performed word and gesture to express that essence. Electricity jolted from his open hand, arcing first to the human and then the dwarf. Neither was quick enough to avoid his spell. The dwarf fell to the ground, flopping about like a fish trapped in a tide pool. The human grunted and raised his sword… as Merisiel’s thrown dagger buried itself in the back of his skull.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren was not so foolish as to provoke a guild of thieves without backup, and it was gratifying to see the remaining War Hounders look stunned at Merisiel’s dramatic entrance. A moment later, it was Ezren’s turn to be surprised as a fifth War Hounder, a cloaked woman with two long daggers, launched herself between Merisiel and the fallen dwarf.</p> 
                   <p>The situation was still in hand… for now.</p>

                    <h3>Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens. </em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“I know you can’t answer my questions.” Ezren’s sounded calm as he turned in place, his cane held high to ward off the two-handed sword blow from the War Hounder who’d been trying to sneak up behind him. “But when you flee back to the Pyramid of the Dog, I want you to deliver your master a message.”</p> 
                   <p>The cloaked woman began dragging the dwarf’s twitching body back into the shadows, tiny sparks of electricity continuing to bound off him across the worn road’s shallow puddles. The attacker with the greatsword swung it again, trying to cut Ezren in half with an attack powerful enough to force the wizard to expend his arcane shield to counter it. Merisiel threw another dagger into an apparently empty space… and the empty space grunted and spattered blood on the street.</p> 
                   <p>“I’d have sent a courier requesting an audience, but none seemed willing to deliver my message, and I haven’t had any luck with public notices.”</p> 
                   <p>Ezren formed a new eldritch concept in his mind, and colors sprayed out from his cane, hitting the greatsword-wielder full in the face. The attacker’s eyes took on the same rainbow colors, and the scoundrel dropped his sword as he staggered away unsteadily. The cloaked woman finished dragging her fallen comrade out of sight, and Merisiel positioned herself to watch his back.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren turned slowly, scanning the open square. The blinded War Hounder was wandering aimlessly but could become a threat again within a minute or so. The woman and dwarf were out of sight but could potentially be maneuvering to make another assault. Merisiel would warn him if that were to happen. There was another man…</p> 
                   <p>At the edge of the square, a man clad in brown and green lurked in the shadows. His drab clothing actually blended into the backdrop of Absalom’s Puddles District better than the pure black of his compatriots. He was bald with a full beard. He studied Ezren with a stern expression, single dagger in hand, though he was well out of stabbing range. The War Hounder could, of course, throw his blade. Or perhaps he knew some occult secret with which to blast Ezren’s mind. </p> 
                   <p>Trusting Merisiel to handle any other unforeseen threats from behind, Ezren turned to face the bald man.</p> 
                   <p>“You are, I take it, in charge?”</p> 
                   <p>The bald man waved a hand in casual denial. “I wouldn’t say that. We aren’t strict in terms of rank or command, you see? More accurate to say I’m wise enough not to be on the front line when confronting a wizard of your… reputation.”</p> 
                   <p>Ezren nodded in acknowledgment, though he suspected the bald man had no idea who he was or what reputation he might possess. </p> 
                   <p>“May I assume,” asked Ezren, eyes still scanning for the missing dwarf, “that if I were to ask you to carry a message to the oldest and wisest of the War Hounders, you could see that it was received?”</p> 
                   <p>“I’d be delighted.” The bald man looked anything but delighted, but Ezren believed his message would be delivered.</p> 
                   <p>As Ezren was about to reply, the War Hounder who’d dropped the greatsword snapped out of his befuddlement. He looked back and forth between the wizard and the bald man. Merisiel was nowhere to be seen, but Ezren knew she was nearby. He kicked the dropped greatsword toward his assailant who, upon receiving a nod from the bald man, picked up his weapon and rushed to stand beside his ally.</p> 
                   <p>“I would <em>very</em> much like to know,” said Ezren with as much iron as he could put in his voice, “what became of the papers and effects of Nessian. Further, I represent a buyer who would pay well for them, if they remain in War Hounder possession.”</p> 
                   <p>The bald man tried to look impassive, but his eyes showed a hint of surprise. Then he nodded again, and gestured for the larger warrior to head out of the courtyard.</p> 
                   <p>“I assure you, that message shall be delivered.” </p> 
                   <p>And with that he followed after the taller man, both of whom were quickly enveloped by shadows.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren smiled as he headed back toward the inn he was staying at in the Foreign Quarter. He made sure to walk slowly so he could easily be followed, trusting Merisiel to prevent further assaults. He suspected when the War Hounders attacked him again tonight, they’d bring someone who could answer his questions.</p> 
                   <p>And tonight at the inn, he and Merisiel wouldn’t be alone to receive them.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Ciravel’s first—and only—childhood memory is of tasting the stars. Peering through a window into the depths of space, innumerable galaxies stare back at her and glitter their welcome.

                   <p>But before and after… Nothing. </p> 
                   <p>And then, in some time or none at all: heat, and the rain on Sovyrian’s canals.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel’s young adulthood was spent at the university, where she earned impeccably high marks studying xenobotany, while also attending martial arts and combat training. Time rarely seemed to be the issue for Ciravel “But how do you manage it all?” her classmates asked. Ciravel shrugged. “I plan well. I have to.”</p> 
                   <p>And she did need to plan. Multitudes of worlds and peoples mean multitudes of different shapes, sizes, limb configurations, and body structures. For Ciravel, it meant a body which, since birth, has been particularly responsive to varying gravities, atmospheric pressures, and other planetary properties. Some days, and in some places, Ciravel has little-to-no pain and walking isn’t a problem. Other times or places, she manages exhaustion and pain. Like many others across the Pact Worlds and beyond, using a hoverchair, or a cane for shorter distances, helps Ciravel reduce fatigue and makes moving around less difficult and painful. She trained to fight while using her chair, harnessing the thrusters and momentum to dodge and attack, conserving energy, to use her cane to counterbalance and anchor herself. Ways to minimize a bad day amongst the good and maximize a good day amidst the bad. But never knowing what sort of day was ahead meant Ciravel had to learn early how to plan for each possibility. So, she’d examine each potential outcome and prepare for each iteration until it became instinctual.</p> 
                   <p>After graduation, Ciravel’s academic success in xenobotany caught the Sovyrian leadership’s attention, and in time, she was trusted with occasional official journeys to Absalom Station. Each time she boarded a starship, it felt more like home than Sovyrian ever had. It was the end of one of these trips, heading back through the station towards her waiting ship, that she was stopped in her tracks by the smell of crisp citrus in the sea air. </p> 
                   <p>It was a scent she had all but forgotten, and in an instant, she was back in the memory of a window and stars and spiced honey. And in that moment, existing in two times, simultaneously, she understood. She could bend this moment to her needs. She could stretch time—delay her departure long enough to find the source of the fragrance. It wouldn’t last long, and it’d be exhausting, but it would be enough.</p>

                   <p>She stretched time at the docks and compressed it nearby. Following the fragrance, or perhaps led by it, she found the source—a young woman with golden eyes and swirling tattoos that almost seemed to dance, carrying a bundle under her arm and walking quickly into a small temple with a shattered mirror on the door—the sign of the Gap Recollective. Ciravel peered in, and when the woman drew back the cloth of the bundle, it revealed a truly ancient warhammer engraved with glowing Dwarven runes. Ciravel tasted spiced honey on her tongue. The young woman looked at her. Smiled. </p> 
                   <p>And Ciravel was suddenly back on the ship home.</p> 
                   <p>Years went by, and Ciravel became the default representative for most off-planet xenobotany meetings. Her excursions were always on time, dodged inclement weather, and when her insular life among the elves caused a diplomatic faux pas, it was somehow forgotten by the next meeting. With the arrival of the <em>Idari</em>, Ciravel was invited as part of the elven delegation to the kasathan worldship. She observed adat and was awed to note that after death the kasatha, like she, exist in two aligned points in time. She befriended one of the adata, who wore a pin engraved with a circle and arrow containing a six-star constellation.</p> 
                   <p>The six stars from her memory.</p> 
                   <p>The adata explained it as the symbol of Ibra, The Inscrutable. Guardian of mysteries and miracles, of exploration and discovery and the cosmos. They spoke at length of Ibra and cosmic enigmas swirling like nebulas and questions, but eventually, Ciravel bid the adata farewell and boarded the ship to Castrovel.</p> 
                   <p>Another young woman boards Ciravel’s ship. She smiles at Ciravel with golden eyes as an unfamiliar object peeks out from the bundle tucked under a tattoo-adorned arm.</p> 
                   <p>Citrus and spiced honey and salt flood Ciravel’s senses. Time stops.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel tastes the stars a third time. And this time, she understands.</p> 
                   <p>Her memory is of the Gap. And either this woman with the golden eyes or this strange object is a link to it.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel untangles the possibilities—the present and the future, selecting a strand, tracing it forward. She knows this woman, Prindra, will lead Ciravel to the Gap Recollective on Castrovel. That Ciravel will peer into the maelstrom of the Recollective’s esoteric secrets, and someone, or something, will peer back. That they will hunt her, thinking three moves and four dimensions ahead. Ciravel unknots another time-thread and finds people who can help her, who she will help, who will become trusted companions. Ciravel knows she will become Forlorn, but feels no despair, for she will bend time itself for the friends she will make, keeping them safe on new worlds as they explore the mysteries of the stars together. Invigorated, Ciravel takes these strands and twists them together, weaving them into a new, stronger thread. Possibility.</p> 
                   <p>She peers out the window, smiling at galaxies glittering with infinite potential and adventure and possibility, for Ciravel has time.</p> 
                   <p>Despite understanding and manipulating the mechanisms of time, Ciravel is by no means omniscient. She selects the best plan based on the information she has on a given topic, and even when she knows an outcome, she still gets nervous from time to time. She also recognizes that someone may have information that informs a different option than the one she has chosen, so, while she will defend her statements, Ciravel is willing to follow another’s suggested plan. Her humor tends to be dry and occasionally dark, but she is playful and loyal with people she trusts. </p> 
                   <p>Ciravel’s insular upbringing can manifest both as ignorance, condescension, and elitism—she corrects inaccuracies, but lacks firsthand knowledge about much of the galaxy, its peoples, their worlds, and their cultures, not for want of curiosity, but simply from a lack of exposure—more than once, cultural ignorance has put Ciravel into a sticky situation. She can be impatient and often will finish others’ sentences, assuming she knows what they were going to say, and she’s usually right. When all is said and done, there is nothing that thrills Ciravel more than exploring the galaxy, putting together a puzzle, and staring out at the stars with her friends.</p>

                   <p>In the brutal tundra of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, only the hardiest folk have what it takes to withstand unsparing weather, track down big game, and fight back hostile followings. The Broken Tusk following has survived another winter, but a new year just began, and signs of danger foretell a year unlike any before.</p> 
                   <p>Unless their newest party of scouts can secure a safe route through the wilds, saber-toothed beasts, warmongering rivals, and the ever-looming possibility of natural disaster all threaten to end an ancient people’s legacy. Will the Broken Tusks succumb to the elements and surrender to their rivals? Or will you guide your following to glory and reclaim a stolen birthright?</p>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/bounties">Pathfinder Bounties</a> are PDF adventure products that launched in 2020. They're designed to fill about an hour of play and act as an easy introduction to Pathfinder Second Edition. They can be used as standalone adventures, strung together in any order as a series, or used as transitions and side quests in between longer adventures and campaigns. While Bounties take place in specific areas, they can be used in any campaign setting. Each bounty is also sanctioned for play in our Pathfinder Society Organized Play program and is repeatable.</p> 
                   <p>So, what's changing? I'm so glad you asked!</p> 
                   <p>Up until now, all of our Bounties have been level 1 Pathfinder adventures. Beginning in 2022, our Pathfinder Bounties are leveling up! You can expect four Pathfinder Bounties in 2022, all for Level 3! The first of these level 3 bounties is scheduled to release in February. Our final level 1 bounty, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories"><em>Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</em></a>, by Michael Bramnik, is scheduled to release this month. </p> 
                   <p>Additionally, in January of 2022, we're launching Starfinder Bounties! You can expect six Starfinder Bounties in 2022, all for level 1. Our Starfinder Bounties are sanctioned for play in the Starfinder Society Organized Play program and are repeatable. Starfinder Bounties grant 1/4 of an XP and 200 credits. While they don't grant Downtime rewards or Reputation, they do offer generous credits for their length. The first of these Starfinder Bounties is already announced: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apn?Starfinder-Bounty-1-The-Cantina-Job"><em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em></a> by John Godek III.</p> 
                   <p>I hope you're as excited for the future of Pathfinder and Starfinder Bounties as I am!</p> 
                   <p>Take care, and happy gaming!</p>

                   <h3>Allie Bustion</h3> 
                   <p>Hey there, Allie here! I’m a freelance game designer and writer with indie projects of my own but also work on games like the <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em> expansion<em> Advanced Lovers and Lesbians</em> (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: The Final Engagement — Revolution”), Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene”), and <em>Into the Mother Lands</em>. Sealord Amodjun and Iolanthe were among the first NPCs I ever wrote for Paizo. Looking back, I think I’ve grown a lot since, but they’re NPCs I’ve still got some fondness for.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me around the internet on Twitter talking about my cat (<a href="http://twitter.com/madpierrot">http://twitter.com/madpierrot</a>), Twitch playing and making games (<a href="http://twitch.tv/madpierrottv">http://twitch.tv/madpierrottv</a>), TikTok serving up GMing and game design advice (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lemadpierrot">https://www.tiktok.com/@lemadpierrot</a>), and Patreon also making games (<a href="http://patreon.com/madpierrot">http://patreon.com/madpierrot</a>). You can also check out my itch.io page (<a href="https://madpierrot.itch.io/">(https://madpierrot.itch.io/</a>) for my games like <em>HEIST</em> and <em>The Way You Make Me Feel</em>. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Jeremy Corff </h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy, and I was thrilled to write Haigen Topkick for the <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> book. The Puddles has always been a great adventure location in Absalom, and I couldn’t pass up a chance to contribute to that dangerous local. I hope ol’ Haigen has a chance to make things more complicated for anybody who ventures into the water-logged district he calls home.</p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to find out more about other projects I’ve worked on, you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Belabras">@Belabras</a> or at my Starfinder blog <a href="https://solorunstudio.com/">https://solorunstudio.com/</a> where I post weekly homebrew Starfinder content. You can also find my work in my Starfinder adventure “Added Value,” in several Legendary Games publications, <em>Wayfinders</em> #16 through #21, on Starfinder Infinite, and in the upcoming <em>Kingmaker Anniversary Edition Companion Guide</em>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Vanessa Hoskins (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello everyone! I had the pleasure of writing The Docks and the Wise Quarter sections. The Docks is the perfect place to go to wish loved ones a "bon voyage" or check on the latest imported wares from Arcadia. There’s also Besmara’s Boardwalk for some carnival games and deep-fried foods, or The Mithril Chef for a fine dining experience where Chef Claudette Butterfoot creates masterpieces out of rare, and sometimes dangerous, ingredients. <br> If you want to get cozy with a book at a tea house, or study for your Conjuration final, or engage in book-smuggling, then the Wise Quarter is the place for you. As one of the sleepier parts of Absalom, it’s perfect for students, scholars, and library enthusiasts. Just watch your coin purse, because the Learned Guard cares more if you paid your silver letters than if someone took your coin purse. What are "silver letters" you ask? Read the book!</p> 
                   <p>Once you’ve done that, read <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/373835/Vellum--Lace-Ep-00-Moving-Day?affiliate_id=3272729"><em>Vellum &amp; Lace</em></a>, a work of serialized fiction on Pathfinder Infinite that takes place in the City at the Center of the World and explores all sorts of exciting locales.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>James Jacobs</h3> 
                   <p>A book about Absalom was one of the first things we published ages ago, and since then most of the development for the city has happened organically across all sorts of products—but mostly through Organized Play. A big part of what I worked on in this book gets categorized under the “Help Erik create text for the connective tissue” once we got started with the first (and smaller) incarnation of this book. There was a lot of connective tissue to create, but my focus was mostly on NPCs and additional locations and sidebar content. Looking back on it all, though, I think the part I enjoyed the most (and I hope folks like it as well!) was writing the various songs that you’ll see in some of the sidebars. It was tough to not go on for pages once I got going on one of them! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Virginia Jordan</h3> 
                   <p>Virginia is a life-long PNW resident who loves nothing more than beekeeping, memes about dogs, and completely useless facts about Medieval history. Having worked at Paizo for two years, their time there only fostered their love of fantasy roleplaying games. Their favorite Pathfinder subjects to write about are diseases and fae creatures, and the weirder the subject matter, the better. In their free time, they enjoy LARPing and creating props and costumes. They are also a professional photographer with a focus on non-traditional portraiture. You can find their work at <a href="https://jordanimages.com/">JordanImages.com</a></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href="http://everybodygames.net/">Everybody Games</a> and <a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> 
                   <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Legends</em>, and <em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>. Now I’m excited to be contributing to the description of the Coins, Absalom’s bustling commercial district.</p> 
                   <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to <a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a> if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                   <p>Уважаемые читатели, дожили! I’m Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may recall me from past Lost Omens such as <em>Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia) and <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> (Mbe’ke, gnolls, Mwangi Jungle, Terwa Uplands). When not writing for Paizo, I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p> 
                   <p>I wrote for Absalom fairly early in my freelancing career, and it was until very recently my largest project by far. I wrote the Shadow War section, the Petal District, and several of the NPCs, including Dyrianna, Lady Adrielle, Lord Kerkis, Lord Avid, and my personal favorite, Samel Maleagant of the Court of Black Paper (last seen snooping around Eutropia in <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>). Looking back, I’m still quite proud of the things that I wrote, particularly the Court of Black Paper (an exceedingly heterodox Norgorberite cult) and the contours of the Shadow War at large (a political struggle with genuine issues that make for some very strange bedfellows).</p> 
                   <p>I should mention that I am also working these days on a different sort of city book, <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, a rather stranger sort of city spread across seven ancient derricks in a world recovering from the Cold Darkness. Check it out at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>David N. Ross</h3> 
                   <p>I'm delighted to bring you much of the chapters on Absalom’s ancient and magical keeps and the military organizations that run them. I have a special place in my heart for the Starwatch and all sorts of spycraft. Since I can never get enough politics and intrigue, my next big project is a Pathfinder first edition sourcebook with rules supporting that kind of play. It’s called <em>Spheres of Guile</em> from Drop Dead Studios, and it's now <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adammeyers/spheres-of-guile-and-ultimate-engineering">live on Kickstarter</a>! You can also find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds">@DavidRossWorlds</a></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Shahreena Shahrani</h3> 
                   <p>Marhaba! I’m Shahreena Shahrani, a Malaysian-American educator, writer, and researcher. I’ve been contributing to the expanding worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years. I can’t tell you how happy I am that this book is finally out! </p> 
                   <p>My contribution to the licit and illicit! markets and drugs, trademasters, and guilds in the Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has been inspired by the peoples and cultures of the Middle East. From the stimulating qat cultivated on the terraced mountains of Sana’a (Yemen); to the historic Khan el-Khalili souq in Cairo (Egypt), where merchants and artisans enjoy the thrill of haggling and bartering with customers; to the night market at Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakesh (Morocco), where vendors and their wares appear almost magically with the setting of the sun; and the incredible warmth, generosity, and strength of diverse peoples. I also named one of the NPCs, Namira, after my cat! </p> 
                   <p>When not gaming, I teach Arabic and Persian culture courses, and deliver lectures/presentations on hot topics to government agencies and personnel. Additionally, I create storytelling adapted from world folklore on my YouTube channel. </p> 
                   <p>I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to email me at shahreena_s@yahoo.com. </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, friends! It's that time of year again where we begin to assemble our organizing committees for our major conventions!</p> 
                   <p>Now, we haven't done this in at least a year, if not longer, so let's talk about what that means. For our major shows (such as PaizoCon and Gen Con), we have a volunteer organizing committee that runs our organized play space. This group works closely with me, as the Organized Play Coordinator, to determine the schedule, recruit GMs, and get them everything they need to make the show a success!</p> 
                   <p>Obviously, there's a <em>lot</em> about 2022 that's up in the air. If we've learned anything from the past two years, it's that we can't predict the future. However, I want to share what our current plans are, with the understanding that they may change significantly.</p> 
                   <p>We are currently investigating running our major shows as <b>hybrid shows</b>. This would mean that we would have both a physical presence at the event as well as online offerings, featuring the same scenarios that are premiering at the physical shows. As a result, we're looking for applicants who have the ability to assist with both physical and online events. Safety requirements and all those sorts of things will be announced well in advance of physical shows, we're not ready to talk about those yet, but rest assured that Organized Play will be following the latest CDC Guidelines as well as the show's safety policies to keep attendees safe.</p> 
                   <p>Below is some specific information about the shows we're currently looking to form committees for: <b>PaizoCon 2022</b>, <b>Gen Con 2022</b> and <b>PaizoCon Europe 2022</b>. There may be additional shows added to the major convention schedule next year (such as PAX Unplugged), and if we add more, we'll do a similar call for committee members. There are some positions we know we're looking for, but we're also seeking general interest for all our shows; let us know if you're interested and what skills you bring to the table!</p> 
                   <p>Please note that joining a committee is a significant commitment; there is a lot of preparation work to do to get ready for a show, and especially coming out of two years of not having physical shows, we'll be doing a lot of rebuilding to figure out our new processes. Committee members are compensated with convention rewards as if they had GMed the maximum number of slots at the convention. Additionally, committee members who are not already Venture Officers are granted benefits for the year at the VL or VC level, depending on their position. Note that anybody is free to apply for a committee; we welcome those who are not already Venture Officers!</p>

                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>So, fresh from the First World I came, Fafnheir,<br> Burdened and brandishing the eggs of my brood.<br> Boldly I’d taken the blood of my brother<br> And the price, my penance, was the exile’s path.<br> Now on Golarion I gazed, greedily,<br> For glory and gold was mine to gather.<br> From mountains where men rode upon mammoths <br> To the Obari Ocean, none could oppose me.<br> Warriors and would-be kings both went<br> Groaning with grief into my gullet.<br> I felt certain Fafnheir was fiercest,<br> First among foes, now and forever.<br> That was good killing.</p> 
                    <p>But fat on the fear of fools, I forgot<br> The fickle future of fortune’s wheel.<br> For although the life of a linnorm is long,<br> And time toughens us like an oaken tree,<br> No royal or regent is allowed to rule<br> Longer than the law of cruel fate allows.<br> Your might won’t matter, is what I am meaning,<br> When you gaze upon a god and grasp<br> The golden age of your glory is gone.<br> Heed my history, and hew<br> To the wisdom which I have won.<br> Listen to the lament of the first linnorm.</p> 
                    <p>Millennia ago by mortal measure,<br> Veiled villains seeking vengeance<br> Summoned the Starstone from the depths of space.<br> But Acavna of Azlant, bride of Amaznen<br> Made a magnificent shield of the moon.<br> She shattered the Starstone into shards<br> And some souls were spared.<br> But gone was the glory of ancient Golarion,<br> And men became cowards crouching in caves.</p> 
                    <p>Into this apocalyptic air I ascended<br> To witness what wonder remained in the world.<br> I sojourned south, taking the swan’s road,<br> And all that my eye encompassed was empty.<br> Fewer folk than you have fingers<br> Lived in that lonely desolate land.<br> But as I approached the antipodes by air<br> Stalwart survivors began to be seen,<br> Sheltering in the shade of Mwangi’s shield.<br> Here were heroes a linnorm could hunt,<br> So down I descended, hungry for dinner.</p> 
                    <p>The trees were towering torches<br> Blazing below me, their light blinding.<br> Under that kindling canopy were helpless kin-folk,<br> Mortal men and elves, Mualijae<br> Caught in a barbarous burning. <br> Time had taught them the meaning of terror,<br> For a dreadful dragon had chosen today<br> To descend and deal devastation.<br> But the fear that filled them wasn’t for Fafnheir,<br> And my blood boiled as I wondered what bastard<br> Had the craft and the courage to steal my kill.<br> Then I drew near to dread Dahak,<br> Dealer of death and desolation.<br> Then the father of linnorms felt fear<br> For the Age of Ashes had arrived.</p>

                    <p>Dark is the day I first saw Dahak<br> Feasting on fools who howled as they fled.<br> Spells and spears he shattered for sport,<br> Shields splintered, they perished in shame.<br> Blades that breached him were, by his blood,<br> Melted to mist like ice in a meadow.<br> A Mualijae maid raised her voice in mourning<br> And the greedy one paused, engrossed by her grief.<br> She sang of centuries filled with sorrow<br> How Starstone survivors became food for the slaughter.<br> But the monster was unmoved by her music;<br> Sky swallowed the smoke.</p> 
                    <p>Many are the deaths that delvers discover<br> When they dare their descent into the depths:<br> A poisonous point in the depths of a pit,<br> Or their corpse consumed by gelatinous cube,<br> Or reduced to dust, disintegrated,<br> Or by the relentless reach of a mummy’s rot,<br> Their strength sapped as they’re turned to stone<br> By the sudden stare of a medusa’s snakes,<br> Or mauled by a minotaur lost in a maze,<br> Or by a bear with the brow of an owl disemboweled.</p> 
                    <p>But lo, this litany now must be lengthened,<br> Expanding the examples of exsanguination,<br> For dungeon delvers have new ways to die:<br> Caught and cut by the dragon god’s claws<br> Or by his bite sent to the Great Beyond.<br> A swipe of his tail scatters them stumbling,<br> Beaten by the buffet of his batlike wings.<br> And finally flames hot as a furnace<br> Brightly furious forth from him fly.<br> The fearful fools caught in that fire<br> Are fried in a flash by that perilous flood.</p> 
                    <p>Lament for the linnorm who has boasted his last.<br> Long is his life, but brief is his legacy.<br> Shunted and shamed, by Dahak overshadowed,<br> To caves in the crags Fafnheir will crawl.<br> From that darkness I’ll dare not emerge. Day’s<br> Luminous light on the father of linnorms<br> Shall not shine. And my shimmering scales<br> Will henceforth be hidden, this for my hubris.<br> Wanderers into my web will be welcomed,<br> As I break my fast on their brittle bone-house.<br> But never again by noon or night<br> Will I hunt heroes, as was my habit.</p>

                  <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Leandra slapped the screaming alarm cube and rubbed her eyes before burying her head in the pillow again. <em>Ugh, too early…</em></p> 
                   <p>A few minutes later she groaned and rolled out of her bunk, stretching as she padded her way into the communal area.</p> 
                   <p>"Oh, morning, Lea. I just drank the last of the instant. Sorry." Her overly chipper, and well caffeinated roommate held up the empty pot apologetically. </p> 
                   <p>“Nok! How could you? You knew I was pulling a double today!” The scowl she leveled at the curvy ysoki would send most others hurrying out of her way, but Nok just grinned and stretched up to kiss her on the cheek. </p> 
                   <p>“I'll pick up more on the way home tonight, promise!" She rushed out the door in a swirl of activity and perfume, leaving Leandra to put the coffee pot in the sink.</p> 
                   <p>Thirty minutes and a disappointingly lukewarm shower later (<em>thanks again, Nok</em>) Leandra stood in line at the popular coffee cart just outside Ixomander’s Throne, the Azlanti-themed casino where she was currently late for her job. She hopped from foot to foot, willing the line to move faster before Mo-var, the meticulous android running the cart, closed for their mid-morning break. Suddenly, an enormous vesk came hurtling out of nowhere and plowed into her. She was knocked onto the ground, while the vesk continued running. A willowy shirren helped her back on her feet before bolting after the vesk, shouting “Sorry!” over their shoulder.</p> 
                   <p>Leandra dusted off her dark green pants and turned to see Mo-var pulling down their cart’s shudder. <em>Damned tourists! Don’t they know how hard it is to keep this faux Azlanti crap clean?</em> She threw her hands up in despair, yelling, “Come on! I was in line and everything before those junk jockeys pushed me over!” Mo-var ignored her, and she went to give the cart a swift kick but stopped when a glint from the ground caught her eye. A misshapen piece of metal and plastic laid on the sidewalk, most likely dropped by the fleeing vesk. </p> 
                   <p>Leandra picked it up and shouted in the direction the two had ran. “Just because we live near a junkyard doesn’t mean you can litter!” She grumbled to herself about inconsiderate off-worlders and inflexible androids, absent-mindedly slipped the piece of trash into her pocket, and stepped into the casino.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Leandra stretched she trudged out of the casino, her back aching after a grueling double shift on her feet serving drinks to increasingly inebriated gamblers. Spying Mo-var’s coffee cart—now open for the evening rush—and knowing that Nok probably forgot to get more instant, she started to wander over. Her way was blocked by a pair of local gang members (<em>True Warriors by the look of them—bunch of lowlifes</em>) diving out of the way of the wide swing of a doshko, wielded by the same vesk from earlier in the day. This time, a lashunta woman followed, her hands glowing with magic.</p> 
                   <p>“Really?” Leandra said out loud, too tired to properly process how much danger she was currently in. Mo-var, however, seemed to understand, quickly closing their cart window. Leandra was startled into action when a stray bullet from one of the True Warriors’ pistols struck the casino wall just a few feet from her. She scurried home, locked the deadbolts, and enabled the security system even though she knew it didn’t work properly. Nok had promised to get it fixed months ago.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Nok stumbled in, giggling and slightly tipsy. The security system let out a pair of weak, unconvincing beeps and gave up, but it was loud enough to startle Leandra awake from where she’d dozed off on the couch. </p> 
                   <p>“Someone had a good night.” </p> 
                   <p>Nok plopped onto the couch next to her. “Hot date with Rush! Oh, so much fun. You should come out with us one of these days! She even has a cute brother...” She chuckled, draping herself over Leandra.</p> 
                   <p>“No time. We’re short-staffed at work. Maybe next week.” She pushed her friend off her lap with a laugh. Nok was always trying to set her up on dates—when she wasn’t on the prowl for her own that is. She’d gone on more than a few disastrous outings at the younger girl’s urging but hadn't clicked with any of her suitors. “Tell you what, I’ll make us both something to eat. You need something in your stomach.” She ruffled the hair beneath Nok’s ear on her way to the kitchenette.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The next day, Leandra had another double. Midway through, her feet and back were already aching and her ears were sweltering in her fake helmet, but she kept a smile firmly plastered on her face as she bustled between tables and the bar. Needing a break from fending off the advances of the junk jockeys who had hit a prize and enduring the glowering looks from the locals determined to lose all their cash, she gestured to her manager that she was going to briefly step outside.</p> 
                   <p>She ordered a cup of her usual from Mo-var to boost her flagging energy and had barely taken a sip when her arm was jostled from behind, sending the drink flying. </p> 
                   <p>“Oh. Come. On!” She was nearly in tears as she turned to see the shirren from the previous day. A ysoki stood next to them, looking sheepish, and the vesk and lashunta were over by the casino entrance. </p> 
                   <p>“YOU!” Leandra gasped. “You owe me at least 3 cups of coffee!” She poked the shirren in the chest, whose antennae twitched in confusion. “First, you knocked me out of line, then you started that brawl in the street, and now you made me spill this one because you can’t bother to watch where you’re going!”</p> 
                   <p>The big vesk lumbered up to them. “Is there a problem?” she rumbled.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah! You and your buddies keep making me lose my coffee and I’m getting sick of it!” Leandra’s shouting was beginning to draw a few gawkers, but she didn't care. “And another thing! You can’t just leave trash wherever you want!” She retrieved the piece of metal and plastic from her pocket and flung it at the vesk’s chest. The vesk fumbled with it for a moment but didn’t drop it. Her eyes widened as she took a better look at the scrap.</p> 
                   <p>“Quig,” the vesk said, turning to the ysoki. “This is the other half of the keycard.”</p> 
                   <p>“You dropped it?!” the ysoki asked incredulously.</p> 
                   <p>“Uh, I guess so.” The vesk looked uncomfortable. She looked back at Leandra. “Hey, sorry about all this. Let me make it up to you. After all, I think you just saved us a lot of trouble.” She ordered an extra-large from Mo-var, handing over enough credits to cover the price a few times over. The android filled up a sizable travel mug with a secured lid and placed it in the cart’s window. Leandra scooped up the coffee and chugged half of it as if she were afraid it would get away.</p> 
                   <p>“Thank you,” Leandra said. “I have to get back to work now.” She turned on her heel to re-enter the casino, hearing the other four begin to chatter excitedly with each other.</p> 
                   <p>Later, she had quite the story to tell her roommate. Nok suspected the four were treasure hunters looking for a big score out in the junk, and they must have crossed the True Warriors in the process. Both of them speculated wildly as to what their “keycard” unlocked well into the night.</p>

                    <hr width="50%">

                   <br> 
                   <p>The following evening, the four approached Leandra on the casino floor. “There she is!” the vesk bellowed with a grin on her face. “My favorite Aeon Guard! We’ve got something for you!” She dropped a credstick onto Leandra’s tray.</p> 
                   <p>A little wary, Leandra picked up the credstick, peeked at the display, and nearly fainted at the amount printed there. She wrapped her arm around the vesk’s waist in gratitude.</p> 
                   <p>“Should be enough to keep you in coffee for a while,” the ysoki smirked. “And when you’re done squeezing Obo to death, we’ll have a round of your most expensive booze. In fact, make ‘em doubles. We’re celebrating another successful mission!” </p> 
                   <p>The group cheered.</p>

                   <p>We’ve got some great scenarios in store for Pathfinders this month as well! And, you might say, they start off with a bang.</p> 
                   <p>With Pathfinder agents spread across the Inner Sea to handle urgent problems at the Society’s lodges, shadowy enemies have decided to take advantage of the Grand Lodge’s apparent lack of defenders to infiltrate the vaults. Fortunately for the Society, it has made some new allies in recent years, and they’ve lent their cunning and expertise to bolster the Grand Lodge’s defenses. While a group of agents is preparing to embark on a mission in Osirion, the infiltrators make their move—and their leader is coming with them.</p> 
                   <p>I wonder if the new defenses are going to help repel the—<em>KRAKOOOOOOM!</em></p> 
                   <p>You’ll have to play to find out. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</em></a>, by Paizo’s own Luis Loza, is a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the four-part “Absalom arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Shattered-Sanctuaries"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</em></a> and will continue with two other scenarios in the coming months.</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, another group of agents has learned that Venture-Captain Varian Jeggare, still a captive of nefarious enemies in Cheliax, has been taken to a secure location the Pathfinder Society has long thought to be abandoned. The site is brimming with guards and infernal dangers, and it won’t be easy for the agents to make their way in, locate the missing venture-captain, defeat his captors, and make it out alive.</p> 
                   <p>But an unexpected guest shows up as they’re preparing for their mission. A sinister guest, with a sinister offer. With so much at stake, perhaps the agents would be foolish to refuse…</p>

                   <p>As a reminder, all of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenarios are part of small arcs taking place in various Inner Sea regions. The arcs can be played in any order, with any character of the appropriate level. While we recommend that you play the scenarios within a given arc in order—to better enjoy the narrative—it is not a requirement.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Do you remember sleep?</p> 
                   <p>It is one of the few clear memories I have from before the transplant. Falling into bed after a day of dedicated study. Waking, many hours later, to Sarenrae’s gentle wingbeats stirring the sky into morning splendor. That curious gulf between night and dawn and, after its crossing, how the voyage leaves one with only faint impressions of the journey. The remnants of dreams. Not fragments, exactly, but tiles without a mosaic.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep. But when I try to assemble those memories into a feeling, I cannot. I lack some essential component. Like forgetting the melody of your wedding song or straining to see through heat shimmer. There are ancient moments that I <em>can</em> feel, of course. The blood of the Pharaoh’s oathsworn on my muzzle. The uncertainty of moving on four limbs for the first time. The strange sensation of an arcane core—<em>my</em> core—thrumming where once a heart beat, and the dried blossom sorrow of seeing myself still and quiet in the sling of an artificer’s lattice. Caressing that castoff self’s face with newly forged digits.</p> 
                   <p>I have seen so many castoffs in this place; surely one of them was you. And maybe it is you who brought me here. As I picked my way through the dusty brass halls, past conduits thrumming with arcane vitality, it all felt so familiar. Not merely because of the similarity to my own second birthplace, but because the faint reflections of this creche have haunted me all these thousands of years.</p> 
                   <p>We do not sleep, you and I, but we do something like it. And so many times, upon exiting that pale facsimile of slumber, I would grasp at shards of foreign dreams. Visions like snowflakes—have you seen snow?—melting even as I touch them. Muted cataracts plummeting through crystalline bends, thaumaturgic rivers rushing toward unseen reservoirs. Rivulets of sand falling through a vault of brass and mithral and stone, down into a craftwork cathedral whose catacombs the dream fragments would not touch.</p> 
                   <p>I know that the Automaton Council left their names within our cores. Perhaps the masters somehow carved others’ memories inside my being. Gadflies in the mind, grit in a mouthful of water—and there! Drink, another thing remembered but not felt.</p> 
                   <p>One grows bored over the millennia. What does a soldier do when they find themself without a war? With need for neither sword nor plowshares? I was not built for peace. So I sought conflict. A wasted century spent stalking our first enemies from the east. Many years more chasing the thrill of the hunt, following the moonlit metal gleam of pack leaders. I clawed crimson paths up the heaving flanks of rough beasts. I even sunk my fangs into one of the architects of Jistka’s downfall; he thought himself safe in his sarcophagus. But the empire is no more, and even when I can find others like myself, those brief reunions cannot fully replace the pride of <em>belonging</em> to a thing. Of serving something greater and knowing that that service <em>matters</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Can you turn your head? Yes, the racks there—the weapons of an ancient an irrelevant war. And ourselves, of course.</p> 
                   <p>…I am sorry, truly, that you must emerge into this world. Ah, and for my rambling. I’ve been lonely, of late.</p> 
                   <p>In any case. Yes, the visions. All around me there is evidence that those visions were indeed more than spheresong footprints. After seven thousand years, I finally ceased grasping at snowflakes and simply let them fall, observing the pattern. In the shallow waterways of my dormant periods, I sieved stranger’s gold from dreamsand, reassembling the path to this place. Across tundra and lake, through the dead god’s favored city and banished gods’ ports, and into the deserts of my two births. Over the peaks—were these peaks not taller, once?—and up to the ragged edges of a basin.</p> 
                   <p>There are peculiarities to our artificed bodies; perhaps I can show you the trick of venting life force from your limbs. Trailing arcana, I descended toward the basin floor, a vulture circling the past, the heat shimmer below a mirror held up to my aimless aeons. When I touched the sands, they were familiar.

                   <br> 
                   <p>That shroud stirred. Ghosts rose around me. A convergence of minds and memories, as something in my core resonated with the emotions permeating this subterranean complex. It must be the hopes and sorrows of all those who set aside their flesh that fixed those visions to this place. I saw dozens of figures pull themselves from the sands, amber grit sloughing off gleaming brass shoulders. I padded through the arcade of long-gone servants as they set their phantasmal eyegems on the east. Plodded toward dissolution.</p> 
                   <p>Tail trailing in sorrow, I reached the basin’s center. Something glinted beneath the sand; a garnet eye set into a dais. Carved script radiating from the gem bore the Conclave’s ancient words:</p> 
                   <p><em>We leap from flesh to crafted hope<br> To safeguard nation, family, friend<br> We shuck ourselves and start again<br> We rise anew and know no end</em></p> 
                   <p>“Know no end”—foolish and prideful! One cannot live from Age to Age without experiencing endings beyond comprehension. No, the Imperium merely filled the deathless millennia with a thousand lesser endings.</p> 
                   <p>Those fools’ words, the ghosts of my fellows. I admit, I was overcome, crushed by reminders of long-mourned purpose. I sat on my haunches and wept.</p> 
                   <p>Did they give you the ocular fire? I barely notice it, now, but that is another half-remembered echo of my second dawn, that first fulminant beam scorching its way out of my head. Like screaming until your throat is raw, but strangely distant, and channeled so <em>tightly</em> through your sight. Channel your conviction and burn away the Imperium’s enemies. Crumpled in the basin, I had no conviction, and my fire merely trickled out as molten tears.</p> 
                   <p>They splashed against the gem, and the earth also wept and moaned. Sand hissed through widening cracks and, just as your eye did, this place irised open for the first time in ages. Below was the towering vault and crystal-banked streams of liquid arcana from those fragmented memory-dreams. Vindication and wonder soothed my soul. Stairs spiraled down from the dais, and I descended.</p> 
                   <p>Down to the sanctum. No signs of battle, as might be expected given the dreaming ghosts above. An entry hall, and a pristine mosaic of the Conclave breathing life into the first core. I loped through halls of the not-dead, their superfluous forms stacked in memorial niches while their spirits slumber here in the lattices. Slowed to peer into glowing cisterns of swirling arcane energy, still ready to quicken the remnants of the Imperium’s crowning achievement. Followed the burnished ribbon of names that marked the path to this creche.</p> 
                   <p>Why did they abandon this place? No matter—we are here now, together. Memories, both mine and others, lead me to you, and to your dormant siblings. We must wake them.</p> 
                   <p>…I am afraid. Of aimlessness. Of what I bartered with my death.</p> 
                   <p>Of rejection.</p> 
                   <p>I am no Conclave. I am no pack leader. I am merely one lost child of Jistka, one aimless wanderer who followed ancient memories to an ancient vault. But I am here, surrounded by an entire tapestry of lattices, and the joy of dozens of siblings opening bejeweled eyes.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep, but I do not remember how it felt. Perhaps you can tell me? And perhaps I, in turn can help you—us—forge a new purpose. One divorced from a Conclave that dissolved before they could lead you out of the space between sleep and death.</p> 
                   <p>The Song of the Spheres fades. The Dawnflower blooms. She reaches even here, below the earth, in this cradle tomb. And for a moment, in her light preserves glimmering dreams, perfect and within our grasp.</p> 
                   <p>Take my hand.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">It’s strange how quickly a life-changing period spanning years can be replaced by what was once normal. Droven was certainly happy to be back in the field undertaking a Pathfinder mission again, and even happier to have an opportunity to deploy some of the gadgets and weaponry he’d created during his long exodus in Arcadia. He’d even lent his latest weapon, a gun that could create portals, to his partner for the exercise, a clever halfling freelancer from Cheliax who’d come highly recommended by a fellow Pathfinder.</p> 
                   <p>The mission itself was fairly simple. There were reports of a large wolf or canine monster attacking travelers and caravans on the road between Absalom and Otari, a small port town on the western half of the Isle of Kortos. It was almost too simple, and in another place and time, the Pathfinder Society likely wouldn’t have sent a veteran agent still settling in after a long and dangerous journey abroad, but Otari was home to several friends of the Society, and perhaps just as relevant, it often served as a secondary destination for shipments too valuable to the wrong people to bring in through Absalom’s more closely watched ports.</p> 
                   <p>So here Droven found himself, his entertaining companion playing a tune as they walked the forested highway on their way to Otari. As always, Whirp accompanied him, the quirky construct mostly doing what it was designed to do, staying by Droven’s side so the half-orc could readily access the tools it carried, but occasionally wandering off to examine a flower or dew drop on a leaf. Droven had disassembled, reassembled, and repaired the goblin-shaped construct countless times over the years, and he still had no explanation for Whirp’s strange moments of seeming sapience, curiosity, and self-direction. There was some magic interwoven with the clockwork devices that powered Whirp. Perhaps over the years of journeying through Arcadia, Droven’s one-sided conversations with the construct had made some impact on these arcane forces, granting Whirp a tiny spark of personality. Droven still carried on these conversations. While they drew the occasional odd look (once convincing a passing goblin to join in and look to their mechanical counterpart for a response that came in the form of an awkward hug and offered crowbar) most of Droven’s friends and peers had grown used to them and occasionally spoke to Whirp themselves.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>On the evening of their second day out from Absalom, they finally encountered the creature they’d been sent to deal with. Droven was dozing by the fire, Whirp standing at his side and staring intently at an owl perched in the branches above, when their halfling companion whispered magically into his ear from his own hiding spot. “Barghest!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven snapped awake; those years traveling on his own had sharpened his mind and reflexes. Drawing his hammer and putting his back against a nearby tree, he whispered back. “So not a wolf? Unfortunate.”</p> 
                   <p>The same calm that always accompanied moments of stress descended once more over Droven. Later, when the fighting was done, his knees would shake and his eyes would water, but for now he was fully in the moment, the fire of his orcish blood fueling his analytical mind and sharpening his thoughts for the task at hand.</p> 
                   <p>The barghest lurked just beyond the range of the firelight, its batlike ears and hunched shoulders faintly backlit by the leaf-shrouded moon. Droven made a mental note to recommend the halfling for future work; even his own eyes, capable of navigating lightless tunnels and moonless nights with relative ease, could barely make out the creature. Droven doubted he would have noticed the monster had he been on watch, let alone correctly identified it under these conditions. </p> 
                   <p>He hoped their plan worked. Whirp was to leap in front of the threat, then scurry through a portal created by the experimental gun he’d given the halfling. Hopefully, the beast would follow Whirp through the portal, putting itself right in line for a thunderous blow from Droven’s hammer. Of course, they’d made the plan expecting a creature of animal intelligence, not a deadly fiend capable of critical thought with its own repertoire of magic.</p> 
                   <p>Before Droven could propose a new tactic, Whirp began acting on the original plan Droven had modified the little construct to perform.</p> 
                   <p>“Whirrrrrp!”</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                    <h3>Illustration by Biagio d'Alessandro from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Whether it was an intentional battle cry or merely the sound of the clockwork gears rattling throughout his small frame, it nonetheless signaled the start of the fight. Whirp’s body sparked for a moment before an explosive gout of flame vented from his chassis, launching the construct directly in front of the barghest. For Droven, an eternity seemed to pass as construct and barghest stared at one another, though it was likely no more than a few seconds. With a second “Whirrrrrp,” Droven’s clockwork companion lurched away, dashing through the woods as tools clattered out of the compartment on its back. Droven made a mental note to add a leather flap to the top of Whirp’s built-in toolbox even as he pressed tighter against the tree, hoping the barghest had failed to notice him or had forgotten him chasing after Whirp.</p> 
                   <p>The plan worked to perfection. The halfling opened a portal next to Droven’s hiding spot before opening another in front of Whirp. As Whirp dashed through the eldritch opening, the barghest sped right behind it. As Whirp exited, Droven swung, his hammer whistling above the construct’s head even as the barghest’s snout cleared the portal. With a thunderous crunch, the barghest popped back out of the entry portal, its head lolling weirdly on a broken neck. Droven looked away from the barghest’s death throes, uninterested in exposing himself to another creature’s agonized final moments, and nodded to his halfling companion. A good plan, or at least an effective one, cleanly executed without injury. As much as Droven would have liked to say, “without negative consequences,” he realized that would be an inaccurate assessment. Somewhere scattered among the leaves and roots of the roadside forest, Whirp had lost an expensive and worrisome number of the inventor’s favorite tools.</p>

                   <h3>GM Numbat (they/she)</h3> 
                   <p>I started playing RPGs in the mid-late ‘70s, enjoying the original D&amp;D with its flimsy booklets and fun dice. Within a year, I was running games at my all-girls high school. I’ve played many systems over the years, though usually only briefly and with long breaks between. Partly this was because of a complex interaction of several chronic mental and physical conditions which can limit my abilities. I am grateful for the Paizo Organized Play community, where I found an accepting and welcoming home. </p> 
                   <p>None of my health concerns are obvious by looking at me. The major advantage to this is that when I have a good day, no one prejudges me simply based on appearance. The major disadvantage is that when I am having a bad day, it is difficult for some to understand, as I look “normal.” Over time, I have become better at learning my limits and predicting some of those times that I need to cut back on commitments. Still, I can be caught out with an unexpected flare and have to pull out of playing, or worse, running a game. I always feel terrible when I do, even though most of our community has been wonderfully supportive. Dietary restrictions are a challenge, especially when traveling or wanting to socialize. I catch myself annoyed by someone’s fidgeting or apparent distraction at the table and remind myself that this may be their coping mechanism, just as I have mine. We are each so individual, with our own needs and concerns, often not obvious to others. Let us celebrate those differences and the unique perspective they bring.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Ivis K. Flanagan (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Disabilities come in many forms. There are disabilities that the world can observe and recognize. There are others, though, that people fight in the dark, because the social stigma of them can be a <em>silence</em> spell, where the anxiety of the possible response is more encompassing than the darkness of suffering alone. PTSD is one of those.</p> 
                   <p>PTSD is the demon that I fight. While many often associate this fight with former soldiers or others who have been in warzones, those are not the only demons at hand. Any traumatic event can be a catalyst. This is my fight—utilizing weapons of words, medications, and therapy in the ongoing battle. I now add to these this transparency in the hopes that someone else will see that they aren’t alone. You have allies who know these battlefields well.</p> 
                   <p>Another weapon against it is finding safe spaces and friends who care. I have been able to do that through this community—the players, volunteers, freelancers, and staff who I am lucky to call colleagues and friends. This community is ever growing, and its values of inclusion, diversity, and honesty are why it is a safe space, a space I am grateful to help create, and a place where no one has to fight alone. </p>

                   <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi all! I’m senior editor at Paizo (on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/legalizegoblins">@legalizegoblins</a>) and multiply disabled, both physically and mentally. Due to hypermobility and congenital muscle issues, I have numerous joint conditions and when walking for more than a few minutes, I have to wear braces on my knees to reduce pain. This can lead to awkward questions, uncomfortable assumptions, and a sense of self-consciousness. Sticking out in public is challenging, whether it’s the braces themselves or the need to use the elevator when all my friends automatically go for the stairs. Additionally, I have a whole cocktail of mental and learning disabilities. This isn’t uncommon; comorbidity is the norm for mental illness and learning disabilities, which is why you often see people listing out a number of disorders. Here’s my list: bipolar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and dyscalculia. I struggle with feeling self-conscious about the number of health problems I face, but there’s no need to be ashamed. Disability is actually extremely common, though we don’t talk about it like it is, and many people with disabilities have more than one. </p> 
                   <p>It’s been a huge pleasure to see disability become more prominent in our games. I feel so lucky to have worked on books like <em>Grand Bazaar</em>, where I gave my NPC, Arhan Benimaya, a service dog. Disability *is* normal, and we should treat it as such. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Dave Nelson (he/they)</h3> 
                   <p>Hey everybody! I'm Dave Nelson and I live with a handful of disabilities, mainly autism, dyslexia/dysgraphia, and anxiety. Often these "invisible" disabilities get either swept under the rug or have their legitimacy questioned. It makes it quite the uphill battle to get recognized and taken seriously. I feel very strongly that more exposure to what folks with these disabilities are actually like and what they go through will help combat these issues. So from the very start of my writing career I have tried to champion neurodiverse causes and representation as best I can. You can find examples of my neurodiverse characters both in <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> in the form of Erikanesh, or the upcoming <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> with Chun Hye-Seung. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/davicthegrey">@davicthegrey</a>, talking about my experiences, games, and all other manner of things.</p>

                   <h3>Stefan “Waffles” Timmons (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, I am Stefan, better known in the TTRPG sphere as Waffles from WafflesMapleSyrup LLC. I am a disabled US Navy veteran with major depressive disorder, tinnitus, as well as other depressive contributing factors such as insomnia and chronic pain. I have battled with suicide in my life and strive to have nobody need to fight that battle alone.</p> 
                   <p>I am one of the two CEOs of WafflesMapleSyrup, who run two separate streams and podcasts. I am the GM of our Starfinder show Journeys Adrift, and I play an android magus (Arc II) in our <em>Strength of Thousands</em> show, Outcast &amp; Outclassed. TTRPGs have given me a close-knit group of friends and a significant other that keep my head up and let me strive to do better in life.</p> 
                   <p>WafflesMapleSyrup strives to reduce the stigma against mental health with our platform in TTRPGs, and because of their similar standards, love to do so with Paizo. We've participated in PaizoCon streams, Jasper's Game Day, and Paizo events, among other events with various creators since we began.</p> 
                   <p>We aim to build our platform into something large enough to have the reach necessary to reduce the stigma against mental health and show that it is okay to be different, it's okay to be disabled, and there should always be a place for everyone at the table.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi y’all, I’m Esther Wallace. I GM Chromythica, a Pathfinder 2E actual play, and I’m multiply disabled. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), two types of OI (osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare bone disease, and orthostatic intolerance, which mostly means I get really dizzy when I stand up), and other as-yet-undiagnosed chronic illnesses. </p> 
                   <p>My disabilities come with frequent symptoms of brain fog, intense pain, and exhaustion. I’m still learning how to navigate as a disabled person in the tabletop community. Gaming spaces are so often not constructed with disabled people in mind; for me, it makes all the difference in the world if a GM and fellow players ask me about my access needs and work with me to implement accessibility practices. As a player, this can take the shape of GMs building in time for me to move my body or encouraging me to play online games from bed or a couch. As a GM, this frequently takes the form of my players helping me recall rules on particularly bad brain fog days! </p> 
                   <p>I created the hashtags #tabletopaccess and #ttrpgaccess as a way for disabled people to discuss our experiences in tabletop, and I host periodic Twitter chats about disability and tabletop RPGs using these hashtags. Disabled people are welcome to respond to any of the prompts I’ve posted, and nondisabled people are welcome to follow along and learn! </p> 
                   <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dungeonminister">@dungeonminister</a> and catch me GMing @Chromythica on <a href="https://twitter.com/Chromythica">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjsqJnhMtdH4Z-m_wzkz0w">YouTube</a>!</p>

                   <p>Hi, I’m Owen K.C. Stephens. I’ve been playing and homebrewing for TTRPGs for 39 years, been a professional game writer for 25 years, a developer for 21, and a publisher and consultant for 9. My involvement with Paizo goes back to the early days of the company putting out DragonMagazine. I wrote the original <em>Guide to Absalom</em> as a freelancer, was a Paizo developer on-staff from 2014 to 2019, am a co-creator of Starfinder, and have done regular freelance work for Paizo since I left. I am also the publisher and co-owner for Rogue Genius Games, and the <a href="https://greenroninstore.com/collections/fantasy-age">Fantasy AGE developer for Green Ronin</a>.</p> 
                   <p><b>Content Warning: Trauma, abuse, and suicidal thoughts discussed in the rest of this bio.</b></p> 
                   <p>I’m a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I have Civilian Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (also known as Non-Combat PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder. I must be medicated and undergo psychotherapy in order to remain functional. This is much like having a broken leg and needing crutches—the crutches don’t let you act normally, but they do make it possible to get more done than you possibly could without them.</p> 
                   <p>Gaming, both game-writing and game-playing, have been a major source of therapy and the ability to build a social safety net for myself. Before I was diagnosed, without RPGs, I would not have survived high school. I know games are important—they saved my life—and believe representation is a crucial part of that.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">As we approach the end of the year, it's tradition to look back on the year that was. There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on. In some ways we have made progress from where we were last year: physical games are slowly starting up in some areas, we've got piles of new content for our players, and we've produced another full year of scenarios. By the same token, there are still many areas that haven't changed: conventions are mostly still online, and we're not sure what the future of large-scale shows will look like.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">As we approach the end of the year, it's tradition to look back on the year that was. There are many words I could use to describe this year in Organized Play: turbulent, uncertain, hopeful...the list goes on.

                   <p>One certainty for me in all of this is the community. No matter what, you're all out there playing games, having a good time and enjoying our stories, I've got the table data to prove it. It's exciting to know that the work we're doing is bringing some joy to your lives. I hope that this holiday season (for those of you who celebrate), you're able to get together with your biological and chosen families, as appropriate, and throw some dice together. You never know, Grandma might get really into playing Kyra from the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! If you're looking for some festive cheer this season, definitely check out this month's new Starfinder Society release, A <em>Festive Operation</em>; I think it'll be a staple of December schedules for the next few years.</p> 
                   <p>Does your gaming group have holiday traditions? Are you giving your GMs something special for the season? Let me know in the comments down below!</p> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month's digital releases, available December 15, 2021:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories">Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</a></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-412-A-Festive-Operation">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</a>*</p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>For those of you who have not already noticed, the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page contains sanctioning for both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>! These two books had a lot of tricky elements, especially <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and we're thankful for your patience while we sorted through them. I'd especially like to thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Mark Seifter for spending a <em>lot</em> of time with me in the week before Thanksgiving working to get them out before the holiday, Pathfinders, go forth and enjoy your new content!</p> 
                   <p>For my fellow Starfinders, we've also sanctioned the most recent standalone adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xs?Starfinder-Adventure-The-Liberation-of-Locus1"><em>The Liberation of Locus-1</em></a>, for credit, and its rules options are also available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. We hope you enjoy this new adventure!</p> 
                   <p>Looking forward, there are two Pathfinder rulebooks coming out in December: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aoy?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens: Monsters of Myth</em></a> and the long-awaited <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>. We hope to have the sanctioning for both of these ready for street date; they're a pretty light lift, so I'm very hopeful. On the Adventures front, we're also starting to work through the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</em></a>, and hope to have more to share on that soon.</p> 
                   <h2>Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfs?Nova-Qualifications-Update">Last year, we announced</a> that we’d be adding one high-level scenario per year to the qualifying scenarios for Nova credit. We intended for this to be our end-of-year scenario each year; however, in looking at the plan for this year, the final scenario of the Data Scourge metaplot is (spoilers!) a 5-8, which is not quite high enough level to qualify for our requirements. As a result, we are adding the Nova tag to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><b><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></b></a>. All previous and future runs (up to three) of this scenario will count towards the 10-scenario requirement for Nova qualification. Thanks to the VOs who pointed out this potential snag to me!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p></p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <h4>Campaign Service Coins</h4> 
                   <p>At SkålCon at the end of October, we awarded two new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #850<br> <b>Sean Pearson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #851</p> 
                   <p>It also came to my attention that we never formally announced the two recipients from last year’s SkålCon Online, so I would like to formally recognize:<br> <b>James Anderson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #840<br> <b>Tineke Bolleman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #841</p> 
                   <h4>GM Ranks</h4> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition), and one GM earned their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Idaho, Joshua Blazej<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Hilary Moon Murphy</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com .</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the holiday season!</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>You can also try the game directly on Tabletop Simulator on Steam. You need to have Tabletop installed, then <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663893091">go to download the Pathfinder Arena demo</a> to add it to your games. Then run Tabletop Simulator and start fighting with your friends in the Arena! You can find a fast guide to the main Tabletop Simulator <a href="https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/basic-controls/">features here</a>. We have uploaded the rulebook, plus the summary cards. You will also find the ability tokens already in the bag, according to the number of players at the table. Mind that you will need to add the extra strength tokens according to the number of players.</p> 
                   <p><b>Backers who now join the campaign</b> already get Amiri, the barbarian, as an extra hero to play with, plus four extra monsters: the hobgoblin general (level 3), the ghoul (level 1), the young red dragon (level 4), and the onidoshi (level 4). </p> 
                   <p>The onidoshi can increase its total life points by 2 (as does the troll), and <b>it deals a strong damage output in both range and melee.</b> It’s also able to attack heroes twice if they’re in the range of both attacks (as does the ettin).</p> 
                   <p>The young red dragon is a fearsome opponent that can <b>attack at 360 degrees and ignore heroes’ defenses!</b> Players would be wise to plan very carefully when to strike against it!</p> 
                   <p>The hobgoblin general brings a new special ability to the game: when it deals critical damage, <b>the targeted hero is pushed up to two tiles away</b>. This effect can lead the opponents into other monsters' range to trigger even more attacks and score more glory points!</p> 
                   <p><b>The ghoul’s only attack is a melee attack, but it has the special ability to lower the number of your action points</b> and defense through negative tokens. This is particularly effective at the beginning of the game, when every hero has only 4 actions per turn.</p> 
                   <p>A custom 8-face die has also been unlocked, along with three extra cards per each hero’s deck, including expansions and unlocked stretch goals!</p> 
                   <p><b>Seelah is also waiting in the next stretch goal</b>. As soon as she’s unlocked, she will immediately get 3 extra cards too!</p> 
                   <p>We are also releasing three social stretch goals: like and follow the game on Board Game Geek to get new Shrine Tiles dedicated to Brigh, Nethys, Calistria, and Pharasma. Brigh allows you to rotate other tiles than the one your hero stands on; Nethys enhances your magic abilities, giving you an extra spell; Calistria rewards monster-hunter heroes with ability tokens; and Pharasma adds glory points if the hero has defeated a certain number of monsters at the end of the game.</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/326030/pathfinder-arena">Like and follow Pathfinder Arena on Board Game Geek to unlock them now!</a></p> 
                   <p>The other two social stretch goals concern our Facebook group. Invite new members or join it now to unlock another extra card for each hero and the miniature of the harpy, a new level-2 monster!</p>

                   <p>I’m happy to announce that as of last week, Paizo has partnered with DriveThruRPG, hosts of the Pathfinder Infinite and Starfinder Infinite community content programs, to offer print-on-demand versions of select out-of-print titles. We’ve got 10 titles up currently, including <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/359514/Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon-PF1"><em>The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/357274/Pathfinder-Chronicles-Campaign-Setting-OGL-35"><em>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</em></a> (both in your choice of soft- or hardcover versions); missing volumes of the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/336398/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-25-The-Bastards-of-Erebus-Council-of-Thieves-1-of-6PF1">Council of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/363571/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-71-Rasputin-Must-Die-Reign-of-Winter-5-of-6PF1">Reign of Winter</a>, and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/360161/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-138-Rise-of-New-Thassilon-Return-of-the-Runelords-6-of-6PF1">Return of the Runelords</a> Adventure Paths; Pathfinder Campaign Setting favorites <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/364007/Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Paths-of-Prestige-PF1"><em>Paths of Prestige</em></a>, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/336466/Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide-PF1"><em>Technology Guide</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369421/Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-The-Worldwound-PF1"><em>The Worldwound</em></a>; and both <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/336399/Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins-PF1"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369636/Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins-Too-PF1"><em>We Be Goblins Too!</em></a></p>

                   <p>These print-on-demand versions differ from the originals only in that the inside covers have been printed as additional pages in the books’ interiors (and that some are now available as softcovers for the first time), and they will easily fill out gaps in any collector’s bookshelf.</p> 
                   <p>We have more titles in the works and will keep adding more as long as folks keep buying the ones we’ve got. Make sure to let us know in the comments what out-of-print titles you most want to see available as print-on-demand offerings, and we’ll set our priorities accordingly.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Today is Thanksgiving in the United States, so the Organized Play team wanted to take a moment to give thanks to our Paizo community. Without you all, the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder would be just stories we told ourselves. We’re grateful for all your support and wish you well as this year comes to a close. We also want to thank the Organized Play community organizers for supporting our programs in these turbulent times. Without the venture-officers, we would lack structure, and without GMs, we would lack games. To all of you who spend time planning schedules and completing tasks behind the scenes, a huge shout out of thanks!</p>

                   <p>Every year we have several dozen events which support charities. We developed the charity boon programs to support these efforts. We’d like to recognize a few of the events who conducted charitable activities and supported the charities’ good works!</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <p><b>Cosmic Crittercon 4, April 23-25</b><br> The Crittermanders raised $6,789, a very pleasing and orderly sum, for Doctors Without Borders in their fourth annual charity event. They also had cookies!</p> 
                   <p><b>Con-Current 2021, June 11-13</b><br> With charity boons, embroidered items, and rerolls, the Ohio Organized Play community raised $5,295 for Planned Parenthood and Jasper’s Game Day.</p> 
                   <p><b>Defenders of the Healing Flame, August 21 &amp; November 6</b><br> With two charity streams and many shenanigans, the team raised $6,420 and threw one glitterbomb at the OPC.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gen Con Online, September 16-19</b><br> Gen Con auctioned off boons, signed books and embroidered items to support Take This and Trinity House, raising a total of $5,886!</p> 
                   <p><b>SkålCon 2021, October 29-31, Plymouth MN</b><br> In celebration of their first physical con since the pandemic began, the community raised $4,750 for Tubman, a local shelter, and collected physical goods to donate as well.</p> 
                   <p><b>PF2e Foundry Community for Extra Life 2021, November 6th</b><br> The Foundry developers’ streamed game on their platform raised $3,567 for Extra Life.</p> 
                   <p><b>Mace 2021, November 12-14, Charlotte NC</b><br> The North Carolina community came out and raised $2,800 for the North Carolina Zoo and $3,000 for Veteran’s Bridge Home.</p> 
                   <p>If we missed your event or you want to promote an upcoming charity event, please let us know in the comments! We know there are charity events year-round that deserve the attention.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! and eat some pie for me!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“I don’t like the look of that <em>sloop</em>,” said Daker, punctuating the last word with his ever-present sneer.</p> 
                   <p>Callum extended his spyglass and directed it at the little vessel, a little less than two hundred feet to port. Its crew scurried about their duties as the sun reached for the golden edge of the western horizon.</p> 
                   <p>“A fisherman,” said Callum, still scanning the deck of the other vessel, “returning home. Not everyone’s a pirate, Gaius.”</p> 
                   <p>“We’re in the Shackles, Orrin,” answered Daker, still sneering at the smaller ship. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re all pirates, ‘til they prove otherwise.”</p> 
                   <p>They had the poopdeck of the <em>Madam Diabola</em> to themselves, a sleek Chelish warship armed with the latest in cannon technology, each devil-mouthed barrel etched with a magic sigil which promised every shot they fired would fly deadly and true. The <em>Madam</em> was given the honor of watching this insignificant settlement’s harbor while Admiral Lecarnas and the rest of the punitive fleet sailed off to lay siege to Drenchport that very morning. Callum didn’t even know the town’s name, but he also didn’t care.</p> 
                   <p>“I grant you, she’s a bold one,” Callum answered, watching as the sloop slowly moved in their direction. “Must’ve sailed out early morning, before we sealed the harbor. We could just warn her off with a hazard flag.”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius Daker was too bloodthirsty in Callum’s opinion, even if he was his oldest friend from his Fort Gorthoklek days. Too enthusiastic with the sap when leading a press gang, too ready to—</p> 
                   <p>“Fire a bit of iron across her bow with that pretty new swivel gun,” said Daker, eyeing the polished little cannon mounted on the port rail. “And beat to quarters. Lads and ladies need a bit of exercise, to keep ‘em on their toes.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Madam Diabola</em> was one of three vessels in the fleet outfitted with the new weapons, swivel guns similar to smaller versions of the black iron cannons on the decks below, tended by scurrying halfling prisoners the crew had taken to calling “powder rats.” Gaius Daker wanted to hear the cannon roar. Callum thought such impulse foolish. Would the captain approve of such actions?</p> 
                   <p>“Gaius,” began Callum, but swallowed the rest of his words when he caught Daker’s glare. He knew that look well. Daker was senior midshipman of the watch, and his words were no mere suggestion. That dark look made it an order.</p> 
                   <p>“Beat to quarters!” Callum shouted, turning to the swivel gun.</p> 
                   <p>Sailors across the vessel leapt into action and the sound of martial drums filled the air. Callum couldn’t help but admire the artistry of the little bronze cannon, mounted on the gunwale, its mouth fashioned like a dragon’s maw, fangs bent outward. He checked the breech, pleased to find it properly loaded and ready. Captain Hecata was fond of the lash, and her newly trained gun crews knew this better than most. They tended Madam’s newfangled weapons of war well, out of fear if not pride.</p> 
                   <p>The sloop was much closer now, turning to port so that it showed Madam her broad side. Callum, ready at the gunwale, turned to look at Gaius Daker, who he caught tugging at his officer’s jacket to sharpen the lines of his uniform.</p> 
                   <p>“They’re giving us a fat target, Gaius,” Callum said, a bit of pleading in his voice. “Maybe a signal flag’ll do the trick.”</p> 
                   <p>“A signal flag, Mister Callum?” came the lilting alto of Captain Hecata as she climbed up onto the poopdeck. “Perhaps I should prepare tea for these Shackles scum while you wave silk at them? What have we here, Mister Daker?”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius, eyes alight with bloodlust and just plan lust, grinned at the captain and saluted. </p> 
                   <p>“Suspicious vessel off the port, Captain! I ordered Midshipman Callum to fire a warning shot across her bow!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum grimaced. Just like Gaius to throw him overboard if it made him shine a bit brighter in Hecata’s emerald eyes. Daker offered the captain his spyglass and she took it, rewarding him with one of her unreadable smiles that could as easily portend divine preferment as utter doom. She looked through Daker’s brass device and within a heartbeat repeated the midshipman’s order.</p> 
                   <p>“Mister Callum, fire that shot. And I wouldn’t be cross with you if that shot puts a crimson part in someone’s hair.”</p> 
                   <p>Callum nodded and turned the swivel gun in the direction the sloop’s starboard bow. He angled the shot as low as he dared—Hecata might not care if he took off some poor bastard’s head, but he did. He asked a blessing from Abadar and fired the cannon. The shot ripped a hole low in the sloop’s staysail and a cry of fear washed across the space between the vessels, announcing the sloop crew’s shock.</p> 
                   <p>A woman in a long coat came to the starboard rail of the sloop, waving both arms frantically.</p> 
                   <p>“Ahoy, Chelish warship!” the woman cried, long brown locks freed as she added her hat to her call for mercy. “We’re honest fishermen, bringing a bellyful to our little island! See how low we ride?”</p> 
                   <p>Callum noted the ship was indeed running awfully low in the water.</p> 
                   <p>“You feed pirates then?” shouted Captain Hecata with a contemptuous air, hands on her hips.</p> 
                   <p>“Nay! Settlers, eking out a life in these hard islands! Shelly is a free port, and we give no allegiance to any pirate lord!”</p> 
                   <p>“Our intelligence says otherwise,” said the captain, and Callum saw she wore that same smile she had given to Gaius. Those fishermen had best say their prayers. It was clear now where this encounter was headed.</p> 
                   <p>Callum joined the naval academy in Hinji when it became clear his mercurial father would favor his younger brother when the inheritance was doled out. He had been fed tales of high adventure on the open seas, contending with the elements and wild creatures, bloodthirsty pirates and rebels intent on bringing Cheliax to its knees. Instead, he found himself part of an instrument of intimidation. Well-armed nautical bullies.</p> 
                   <p>“There are a dozen innocent souls on this ship, captain!” the brown-haired mariner in the sloop called out across the water. “We bring back the bounty of the sea to feed hungry bellies. Men, women, and children. No more, no less. I beg you let us pass!”</p> 
                   <p>The woman’s last words were made with hands clasped together, as if offering up a prayer.</p> 
                   <p>“Prepare to be boarded,” sang Captain Hecata, drawing her cutlass and nodding to Midshipman Daker, who wore a giddy grin on his face.</p> 
                   <p>Callum looked back at the sloop, the long-haired fisherwoman, hands still clasped like a supplicant…and then his eyes caught a shimmer, as though he looked at a painting behind glass, tilted to catch the sun’s rays. A warning tingled at the base of his spine. He turned to share his misgivings with the captain, when the unmistakable sound of a cannon report, several in fact, sent him instinctively to the deck, prostrate with his arms cradling his head. The first ball struck the portside railing on the quarterdeck below, obliterating wood and sending deadly splinters in all directions. The second tore through Gaius Daker, reducing him to an ugly spray of red.</p> 
                   <p>In the next moment Callum was helping the captain up from the deck, one side of her smart Chelish uniform painted with Daker’s blood. </p> 
                   <p>“Return fire!” she roared, shaking off Callum’s assistance. “By all the tines in Hell, that’s no bloody fisherman!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum glanced to his left—the sloop was gone. In its place was a black-sailed brigantine, the iron mouths of cannon protruding from open gun ports, its main deck alive with surly-looking sailors brandishing weapons.</p>

                   <p><em>Pirates!</em> he thought as <em>Madam Diabola’s</em> new guns answered the brigantine’s attack. But it was as if the wind took the iron hurled at their enemy away like fallen leaves. Of its sixteen guns, only a single cannonball connected with their chameleon foe. What sorcery did these brigands have at their disposal? Illusion to disguise a warship? Elemental servants to carry away iron shot? </p> 
                   <p>It was then that Callum caught sight of the brown-haired woman again. He could swear she was smiling at him directly, and as if to confirm it, she gave him a jovial wave and held her hands up to her mouth to trumpet her words across the now-smoky distance.</p> 
                   <p>“Welcome to the Shackles!” she cried.</p>

                   <p><b>Moderator: I understand Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse is releasing its first ever premium Box edition of a Pathfinder Release. Why <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens?</em></b></p> 
                   <p>Donk: Absalom is THE iconic city in Golarion. Plus there’s danger lurking around every corner, so lots of opportunity to make the characters’ lives miserable.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Pre-sales of the Gold Edition begin on Black Friday, with 10% off to anyone who orders by Nov 28th. Did you have any say in that?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Product doesn’t really talk to marketing. There’s a high wall, three moats, and pit traps filled with trolls between us and the marketing department. Our intradepartmental memos are stuffed in the mouths of junior VPs who are exchanged via catapult nightly. That said, I don’t disapprove. </p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’ve heard the Gold Edition comes with NPC cards that can hang on the GM screen, with artwork on the front for players and roleplaying info on the back for the GM. What kinds of NPCs might we expect?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: You’ll see all the most interesting denizens of Absalom: noble goblins, brave goblins, handsome goblins and brilliant goblins. Probably some other things, too, but I really haven’t checked.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg"><img style="max-width:70%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg" alt="Absalom building mock up cards with art on one side and information on the other"></a>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><b>M: It also comes with location cards. Artwork of the building or location on front, background information on the back. We’ve never seen that before from the Warehouse. Why now?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Locations cards really help you understand where you are at all times. If you’re a member of the Pathfinder Society, that’s great for their motto of “Explore, Report, Cooperate”. And if you’re a member of the Bloody Barbers, it’s perfect for their motto of, “Bury the bodies further from the house.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’m surprised a goblin would come up with wearable faction jewelry for players. What was your inspiration?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: We take special pride in our jewelry pieces. They’re designed by our crack jewelry designers, and lovingly crafted from the fillings ripped out of the teeth of marketing goblin project coordinators. Reduce, reuse, recycle, but without the reduce part—we call that “maximizing operational efficiency.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I see. So, you included several short bonus adventures in this Gold Edition. How do you expect GMs to use these?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Our original design mandate for the bonus encounters was that they would be a short, sharp way to terrorize an adventuring party, complete with large battle maps to mark where the characters fell.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Oh, so you also include large battle maps? </b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Battles are more fun if you know where you are and what’s around you. After all, the difference in a five foot square is sometimes the difference between living to fight another day and your fellow party members looting your corpse.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: There’s quite a bit more that will come in the box that I saw on <a href="https://www.beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom">beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom</a>. How would you rate your website goblins?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: In general, our website goblins aren’t worth the cost of the oil to boil them. On the rare occasion that they actually manage to make the website work properly, we hold a party with floats and cake.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Any last quote you’d like to leave our readers with? Words of wisdom?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: If you open your windows after sundown, and if the wind is blowing just right, you can hear the screams of the mighty warehouse engines coming to life. They’re ready—nay, eager—to build something great for the Pathfinder audience, and I think the product department has really knocked it out of the park. Assuming the website goblins can keep the site up and the marketing department doesn’t go berserk and start handing the boxes out with happy meals, we should be in for a good ride.</p>

                   <p>In Pathfinder Arena you will take the role of one of the iconic heroes of Pathfinder, trapped in a magical entity, calling itself “Arena”. The entity poses a challenge to the party: select a champion to claim the right to escape from it. <b>Score glory points by defeating the monsters summoned in the Arena, or by triggering beasts against your opponents!</b></p> 
                   <p>Players can modify the Arena structure by spending action points to push or rotate the tiles. By doing so, players can move opponents into a monster’s range and trigger an attack to score as many points as the damage the monsters inflict.</p> 
                   <p><b>Each hero has asymmetric abilities and a tailor-made deck, reflecting their class.</b> Heroes level up during the game by picking up tokens in the Arena to enhance their abilities and access to their deck. Choosing which cards to draft and which ability to prioritize enables players to develop different strategies in the Arena and makes each hero unique.</p>

                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b>We tried something a little different from the conventional spellcaster model with the psychic’s lower number of spell slots and strong focus on …focus... cantrips, amps, and other special powers, with conventional slotted spells filling a more supplemental role. The overwhelming majority of you responded that you preferred this approach over a conventional spellcaster approach; however, much of the feedback also indicated that while what the psychic got in exchange for this reduced spell loadout was very interesting, it didn’t feel powerful or useful enough to make up for the difference in lost spell slots. So, a major direction of change for the psychic will be to retain the “fewer spell slots” and “cantrip/amp focus” class role, but adjust the power level of the supplemental pieces so that you can truly feel like you’ve unleashed the awesome power of your mind. I’ll get into some of the approaches we’re taking in each point below.</p> 
                   <p>We also wanted to get a sense in the playtest of what you all thought of the general tone and genre of the class. This was pretty conclusive—over two-thirds of respondents said the more magical cast was working for them, so we’ll be staying the course here as well!</p> 
                   <p><b>Spells and Spellcasting:</b> A strong majority of respondents stated that they preferred the playtest arrangement of the psychic’s spellcasting and key ability scores, so we’ll be sticking to those and keeping the psychic as a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose subconscious mind gives them a thematic choice of key ability score between Intelligence and Charisma.</p> 
                   <p>I also want to call out that, as with past spellcaster playtests, the specific spells granted on the conscious minds drew only on spells we had already published, so some needed to be chosen for role (“a damaging spell here” or “a scouting spell here”) and easy understandability even if they were a little outside the theme—for instance, <em>magic missile</em> was a stand-in for a more on-theme damaging level 1 spell on the distant grasp psychic. The final <em>Dark Archive</em> book will introduce several new spells with the psychic in mind for thematically tighter granted spells!</p> 
                   <p><b>Psyche:</b> The ability to unleash your psyche to amp spells for free was originally intended to let psychics really feel like they got to be masters of focus by cheating the Focus Point caps. However, the fact that psychics had almost unlimited Focus Points took up a lot of the power budget for the class, rippling into the psyches needing to come online later and have both benefits and drawbacks, as well as affecting the power of amps (which I'll touch on next). Therefore, one of the biggest changes we’ll be making to psychic is to remove this aspect of Unleash Psyche, and then redistribute that power through the rest of the class for a more consistent play experience. </p> 
                   <p>Consistent feedback also showed that while psyches were interesting when unleashed, most combats didn’t last long enough after the third turn to make getting into the psyche feel worthwhile (meaning that much of the psychic’s power was tied up in a feature they had inconsistent access to). While we don’t want to make Unleash Psyche an “assumed first-turn action” in the vein of Rage, Hunt Prey, or similar, we do want to make it easier to do. Thankfully, with the removal of psyche’s role as a source of unlimited Focus Points, we have a lot of options for making it more accessible, as well as for adding more punch, such as effects that happen when your first Unleash your Psyche, more special abilities that happen automatically when you are unleashed, or the ability to end your psyche earlier for a single big benefit.</p> 
                   <p><b>Amps:</b> Amps are one of the major parts of the psychic, and most respondents stated that they found these options very interesting—Mark tells me that amps scored among the highest for “interesting” of any class we’ve playtested—but also that they felt weak in comparison to normal focus spells. They were! Since Unleash Psyche meant that you could amp your focus cantrips 5 or more times in a single combat, as opposed to a hard maximum of 3, those amps needed to be a little under the balance point of spells like <em>fire ray</em>. While psychics will retain their focus on amps, they likely won’t have such an outsized number of them, so we have plenty of room to now bring the power scale of amps back up.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Stuff!:</b> Of course, we always increase the number of options between the playtest and the final class! In addition to the new spells that will be added in Dark Archive, the psychic will of course be gaining new feats and choices of both conscious and subconscious minds. In honor of our new iconic psychic, Thaleon, I’ll share his conscious mind, which is called the tangible dream. This path focuses on materializing and projecting the user’s thoughts into the physical world, allowing you to conjure walls, blades, and other constructs of force (or astral thread, or ectoplasm, as your character concept fits) around the battlefield!</p> 
                   <p>I’m getting a vision… It’s… of Mark, talking about the thaumaturge!</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the thaumaturge class. I first want to thank you all for participating in the playtest by running and playing games, posting your playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and having good discussions! In particular, the playtest was happening during a pretty challenging period for us at Paizo, and I appreciate how all of you in the playtest stepped up your game compared to earlier playtests with extremely civil discourse, keeping repetitive points to a minimum so I could keep up with all the new ideas, and just really engaging with each other’s ideas and feelings in good faith to talk about different directions. </p> 
                   <p>Overall, people really liked the thaumaturge, with a strong good feeling from the majority of players, but there were definitely some areas where it needed tweaking or rethinking, usually in a way that didn’t detract much for most playtesters but did in a big way for a small number of them. This left the thaumaturge in an interesting situation, with about as many people who were about as many huge fans of the class as the highest-ranking class we’ve ever playtested, but then that small number with especially low rankings. The great news about that is that it left a clear path forward. </p> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether playtesters would like our new vision of the thaumaturge or would prefer something more similar to the first edition occultist. What I discovered is that you really like the martial thaumaturge concept, by an overwhelming majority, and want it to remain a magpie picking up from all four traditions. However, there was a desire to make it clearer how the class fantasy works with respect to exerting your force of personality to convince the universe, as well as to add more capacity to the class’s skills so that Charisma-based skills are front and center to match the intro lore about being persuasive. The changes to Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws (see below) may help with this as well to allow better advantage of your Charisma key ability score, while freeing up a broader variety of character concepts—this will let players freely choose whether to lean more heavily on magical learning or more on making things up as you go along as best fits the character. We’ll also be making a variety of quality-of-life changes based on other playtester proposals.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Implements:</b> As the playtest mentioned, we’ll be adding up to nine implements (three each granting active, reactive, and passive abilities). Of the four new implements, one of them will be the tome (or a ledger, notebook, or similar object), a passive implement that mysteriously writes down information about everything around you to assist you. The other implements are one to let you inspire and lead your allies, one to debuff your enemies, and one that misleads your enemies’ attacks, but I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what implements those might be!</p> 
                   <p><b>Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws:</b> One thing I’ve learned from these playtests is that our playtesters tend to be our most dedicated and experienced players (and even if you’re new to Pathfinder, you are very experienced with tabletop RPGs in general). So, whenever even our most experienced playtesters think a mechanic is complicated, I think I should take another look at that. People loved the benefits for these abilities but thought they were complex, and that they sometimes had issues being tied directly to Recall Knowledge. Our plan is to disentangle Esoteric Antithesis from Recall Knowledge (with a feat, like investigators’, to pick up a free Recall Knowledge if you want that), instead just flat-out forcing your will on the universe with a check to establish a connection (I’m thinking a name like “Forge Connection”). One consequence of this is that even on a failure, you can forge a connection, but a success or critical success will give you more. Additionally, while a high majority of players really liked the playtest benefit from Esoteric Antithesis, there were some good ideas about how to open up to allow a variety of benefits to allow for more playstyles. So, we’re looking at offering multiple benefits a thaumaturge can pick from when you successfully forge a connection. This separates out the benefit where you apply a creature’s highest weakness and the benefit where you create a new weakness as two options, to handle the feedback people gave about situations where they were already applying a creature’s highest weakness due to preparation for the encounter. It also allows you to gain new benefits, for instance, when you might prefer a special buff or debuff instead of simply more damage. Right now, we’re toying with the idea of having a different connection for each implement, as some folks also thought implements could use one more unique power, and then have more connections available through feats</p> 
                   <p><b>Pacts:</b> People loved the story of the pacts—in fact, they wanted them to have stronger effects, and many wanted the option for any character, even non-thaumaturges, to gain them. We had actually planned on including similar pacts in a yet-unannounced part of the book, but based on your feedback, we also expanded the pacts into a full-on pact binder archetype for anyone to take! Opinions were pretty varied about their rarity, perhaps the most mixed we’ve ever gotten in a multiple choice question for paths moving forward, so we’ll take that into account moving forward.</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <h2>A Glimpse, A Hunch, A Flicker of the Future:</h2> 
                   <p>Hey, thanks for sticking around! Here’s something coming up in <em>Dark Archive</em>—while the book is still in development and various things might change a little, I wanted to give a sneak peek into a new type of player option coming up in the cryptids file, one of the eight casefiles of the <em>Dark ArchiveM</em>.</p> 
                   <h3>Creature Echo Feats</h3> 
                   <p>Creature echoes are a new type of feat that grant you special powers based on exposure to an unusual creature. These are rare and usually only occur after a significant event involving the creature. Imagine a town where people have, one by one, begun to turn to stone. You might spend many months tracking down the cause of the phenomena, only to eventually find it was an ancient creature with a petrifying gaze living deep under the town. However your encounter with the creature goes, the following feat might echo with you if you survive:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Stone Skin — Feat 12</b><br> Rare, Transmutation<br> <b>Prerequisites</b> You have been petrified.</p> 
                    <p>It might have been a medusa, dracolisk, or even a fossil golem; regardless of the source, you were the target of some petrifying effect, and an element of that stony gaze has remained with you, both protecting and slowly consuming you. Your limbs are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin. You gain a stone fist unarmed attack which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has the shove trait, and is in the brawling weapon group; unlike a normal fist, it does not have the agile or finesse traits. As your life force ebbs, this petrification spreads over more of your body to form a stony armor. When you have fewer than half your maximum Hit Points, your stone fist unarmed attack increases its weapon damage die from 1d8 to 1d10 and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to your Constitution modifier. </p> 
                    <p>If you would gain the dying condition, you can choose to instead be permanently petrified to avoid the risk of death. Counteracting this petrification requires a casting of <em>stone to flesh</em> of a spell level equal to at least half your level, as well as a counteract check against the hard DC for your level. Each time you recover from petrification caused in this way, you gain a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.</p>

                   <h3>Scribes of the Archive</h3> 
                   <p>Before I go, I want to say thanks to the awesome writers whose work is featured in the book. We’re in the middle of development and I gotta say, they’ve done some strange, spooky, and brilliant work!</p>

                   <p>When asked about his history with producing fantasy art like the imagery featured in these two puzzles, Reynolds said, “I have been working in the RPG industry for almost 30 years, with my first piece of art being featured in 1993.</p> 
                   <p>“I was working with Paizo when they took over Dragon and Dungeon Magazines,” Reynolds explained. “I was doing some cover art for them, so when they started Pathfinder, I was one of the first people they approached about providing art for the game.</p> 
                   <p>“It is exciting to be able to work on something from the ground level. My experience with Pathfinder has been massively enjoyable. I just love everything about that sort of world.”</p> 
                   <p>When asked about what pieces of art his personal favorites are to create, Reynolds said, “Mainly the iconic characters, as my specialty is in character design. I love being able to tie history to fantasy, and I always do a lot of historical research before beginning work on that type of a project.”</p> 
                   <p>Speaking specifically about his art being used to create jigsaw puzzle products, as well as how he thinks he’d fare putting them together himself, Reynolds said, “I like doing jigsaw puzzles. They are relaxing, and I think they also make for a good exercise as an artist. I am probably the wrong person to do a puzzle featuring my own artwork, though, because I already know the image so well.</p> 
                   <p>“I imagine it would be sort of like a musician dancing to their own music,” Reynolds added.</p> 
                   <p>Fans of Pathfinder, Wayne Reynolds, and fantasy art in general have made these jigsaw puzzle items two of Toy Vault’s most popular new offerings this year, and it is with great excitement that we announce two more brand new puzzles featuring Pathfinder imagery—<em>Gamemastery Guide and Gods &amp; Magic.</em></p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0294z?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gamemastery-Guide">Gamemastery Guide</a></em> once again showcases a wonderful piece of Reynolds art, this time depicting Alaznist, one of the game’s villains, ascending a staircase while holding onto an impressive-looking spear-type weapon in one hand. Towering above her is a large black dragon with giant horns, red eyes, and wings extended.</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02950?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gods-Magic">Gods &amp; Magic</a></em> features work by the talented Russian artist Ekaterina Burmak. The scene depicts the Starstone near the top, with three characters below. These three characters are Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, and Norgorber, all of whom ascended to godhood after touching the Starstone, according to official Pathfinder lore.</p> 
                   <p>These two all-new Pathfinder puzzles are available now, just in time for the 2021 holiday season. For more information on Toy Vault, please visit <a href="http://www.toyvault.com/" target="_blank">www.toyvault.com</a>.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">“Please, Dhareen, must we go through with this? A bit of rock climbing is hardly a challenge for the Castrovel Kid!” Dhareen imagined her mentee thrusting his chest out proudly, thumb pressed triumphantly above his heart as he blustered several feet below her. She smiled to herself and pushed her piston-puncher into the mountain’s side, activating the gadget with a press of her lowleft thumb.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps, but it is custom among the tribes for a Yavnii to administer a test to every hopeful Brekai wanting to undergo the Test of the Mountain, and I am afraid that not even I have the authority to make exceptions to shobhad tradition. Not even for the ‘Castrovel Kid.’”</p> 
                   <p>“See, you say that, but I can hear your grin,” Vellero replied sullenly.</p> 
                   <p>“I know not what you mean.” Dhareen grinned again.</p> 
                   <p>Both gladiators fell silent as they climbed, Dhareen pausing her ascent long enough for Vellero to scale up alongside her.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>He had taken to her tutelage well. Ka’s cliffside was grueling even for an expert; twenty-two miles long and comprised of thin basalt overtop stronger metamorphic stone, careless climbers often plummeted to their deaths after relying on pistons pounded into brittle basalt. One of the many roles of a yavnii was to ensure their breknai did not succumb to such a fate. Vellero had learned Dhareen’s lessons well thus far, scaling around several patches of basalt she had left in his path as a test.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s concentration reminded Dhareen of when she first met the headstrong lashunta in the ring at Arl’s VitariTech Coliseum. They were competing in the Icons Grand Brawl, and he was favored to win. The young man was a crowd pleaser on a seven-match winning streak. He was good, but not good enough; Dhareen scrubbed the floor with her future friend’s face. Literally. Nevertheless, there had been a spark within Vellero, a spark that intrigued her. The second time she knocked him down—or perhaps the third—he clamored to his feet with a bruised antenna and a few chipped teeth, wiped fresh blood from his lip, and grinned.</p> 
                   <p>“Why do you persist?” Dhareen had asked, scarcely winded. “You cannot win. You bring yourself only pain. Throw your towel; others have when facing me. There is no shame in surrendering to your better.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re right,” he’d replied. “But that wouldn’t be fair for the folks who came here to see me fight, and I don’t want to let a single person in this ring who believed that I could win down.” He raised his fists into a boxer’s stance, a pointless gesture against an opponent twice his size with twice as many fists. “When I go down, I want them to know I gave it my all!”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“I don’t mean to sound indignant,” Vellero interrupted Dhareen’s thoughts. “I know that the Test of the Mountain is sacred to your people, and that it is an honor to be allowed to undergo it as an outsider.” </p> 
                   <p>Dhareen raised an eyebrow. “But?”</p> 
                   <p>“But,” Vellero took a breath. “Is the reason we’re doing this,” Vellero gestured out behind them, over red dunes and rolling clouds of dust. “Because you don’t think I can?”</p> 
                   <p>“If I didn’t think you could pass the Test of the Mountain, I wouldn’t have begun the climb with you, nor permitted you to undertake it.” Dhareen’s voice was gentle but her statement absolute. “The mountain is sacred to my people. We do not tolerate bloodshed on Ka. To send one who is unprepared up the Mountain is as shameful as slaying one’s enemies at its base.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s expression softened slightly. “Thanks.”</p> 
                   <p>“Do not speak of it. You don’t want your throat to dry from the ascent.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero blinked, then burst out laughing.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. You’ll have twenty miles left when we’ve reached the end of our shared path.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero kept laughing for a minute, wiping tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Dhareen.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re—”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-<b>KUN.</b></em></p>

                    <h3>Dhareen reaches for a falling Vellero in this illustration by Victor Manuel Leza Moreno from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder: Galaxy Exploration Manual.</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Dhareen gave herself no time for thinking. Before the sound of shattering basalt reached her ears, before Ka itself folded like a withered tumblefern in a windstorm, she whipped around to where Vellero was climbing even as his cliffside shifted downward, a cascade of metamorphic stone tearing free from Ka and tumbling towards the ground below. Vellero screamed as he fell, but Dhareen plucked him from the air like a corpseheron snatching a leaping spookfish out from the Irkonian Sea. Dhareen didn’t speak Ysoki, but she had spent enough time around ratfolk gladiators at VitariTech to recognize the lashunta lambasting the situation with at least six of the fourteen different Ysoki swears that she knew.</p> 
                   <p>“Hold on, Vellero!” Climbing down wasn’t an option; a rockslide was eminent, and the best place to be during a rockslide was above it. Vellero was much smaller than she and less experienced at climbing, he would only slow them down. She could climbe faster with all four of her muscled arms free, anyway. There was only one option remaining. </p> 
                   <p>Hoisting the Castrovel Kid onto her shoulders like a mother giving a youngling a backride, she placed the much smaller lashunta onto her shoulders and started climbing as fast as she could, giving only the barest of warnings. “Hold tight!”</p> 
                   <p>Though Dhareen could hear Vellero shouting, her intense focus and the earsplitting sounds of portions of the rock wall sloughing off afforded her no opportunity to comprehend him. She climbed as quick as her body would allow, muscles aching and flaring as she abandoned her piston-punch and climbed barehanded. She knew full-well that the smallest mistake would send both she and her friend to their doom.</p> 
                   <p>Ten yards from the top.</p> 
                   <p>Five.</p> 
                   <p>She was going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>She and Vellero were going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>Then her world shook as shadow overtook her vision. A boulder dislodged from above, tumbling towards her, threatening to crack her skull and send Dhareen and her breknai tumbling miles to their death. She refused to close her eyes; she would greet the Lady of Graves with firsthand tales of how she died. She was not alone; at the peak of her vision, she saw a small lashunta arm, no bigger than that of a shobhad child’s, reach out as if to catch the boulder. Dhareen admired Vellero’s bravery one last time.</p> 
                   <p>The boulder collided with Vellero, and for a moment it was like watching a diver plunge into a serene pool. Vellero’s hand, then his arm, and then both their bodies plunged into the boulder. </p> 
                   <p><em>Was it just an illusion?</em></p> 
                   <p>Fine dust covered Dhareen as the boulder passed through her. From within, she watched the metamorphic rock splinter and crack in flight, first into smaller boulders, then into stone and pebbles, and finally into dust. The boulder never touched them; it dissolved before it even struck the Castrovel Kid’s hand.</p> 
                   <p>Dhareen was stunned at first. But with safety just a few yards above and Ka continuing to shake and splinter, the feeling passed quickly as she bellowed at her peculiar friend.</p> 
                   <p>“That, Vellero! Keep doing that!”</p>

But what happens when the digital settings and inhabitants of these simulations come to life and threaten a group of innocent fun seekers?</p> 
                   <p>Thanks to some inadvertently malicious code created by a proud game designer, such a calamitous event has occurred on a small moon hosting an entertainment expo! The building is slowly but surely being digitized while the game designer’s mind has been taken over by a comic-book villain. Only a group of newly recruited Starfinders can save the day!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">On the occasion of Transgender Awareness Week, we at Paizo want to reaffirm our support for our transgender colleagues, creators, and community members. We recognize that we've not always been there for our trans community members. While things are rough now, we as a company are dedicated to improving and providing a safe space for all gamers—especially trans gamers—to play, create, and be part of a thriving community where they are not only welcomed but celebrated.</p> 
                   <p>We felt that this year, we shouldn’t place additional emotional labor upon our trans staff, creators, and community to contribute to a blog for Trangender Awareness Week. Rather, we wanted to address the issue of transphobia on our forums.</p> 
                   <p>Many members of the community have noted a high amount of homophobic and transphobic posts recently. Let us be clear: these hateful posts are not okay under any circumstances, and those who make them will be faced with <b>permanent suspension</b> from the forums. Though our customer service department is doing their best to keep watch and address moderation flags, it’s clear that the volume of moderation needed on the forums in the last few months has meant that the team sometimes takes more time than usual to moderate a thread. </p> 
                   <p>Transphobia is serious and removing it from the forums should take precedence over other more routine moderation tasks. Therefore, if you need to report transphobia on the forums, please don’t hesitate to contact customer service directly by email at customer.service@paizo.com with INTOLERANCE in the subject line. Any such hate will be dealt with swiftly and incur a permanent suspension.</p> 
                   <p>While we realize that combatting discrimination is an ongoing process and this is only a small step, we hope that it can begin to make our community forums a place where all members of our community feel welcome, and more importantly, safe.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you to our trans community members and other allies who have pushed us to be better recently. We hear you, we value you, and we will continue to improve ourselves, our games, and our community to earn back the trust we’ve lost. It’s hard to admit that we haven’t been living up to our values, but it’s the right thing to do, and we can’t move forward without doing so.</p> 
                   <p>Please also consider donating to nonprofits benefiting and supporting the trans community—members of our staff recommend <a href="http://www.tgijp.org/" target="_blank">TGI Justice Project</a> and <a href="https://ingersollgendercenter.org/">Ingersoll Gender Center</a>, though there are many great organizations doing the work that would value your contribution.</p>
