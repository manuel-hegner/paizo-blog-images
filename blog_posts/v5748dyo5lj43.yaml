  \ season continues strong, with shows in the United States, Canada, France, and\
  \ Australia. If you have a spare weekend, consider visiting <a href=\"/events\"\
  >our Events page</a> and check out what Pathfinder Society activities occur in a\
  \ city near you.</p> \n    <p>Last fall, I wrote a feature blog on SkålCon, a new\
  \ convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul organized by Venture-Captains Andrew Christian\
  \ &amp; Jon Dehning and their motley crew of stalwart Pathfinder Society folk. This\
  \ past weekend saw the return of SkålCon, bigger and badder than ever. Once again,\
  \ the team set out to raise money for charity as part of the show, this time sacrificing\
  \ Venture-Lieutenant Keith Apperson's locks to the cause. I received an email from\
  \ Jon that SkålCon attendees opened their hearts and gave generously, surpassing\
  \ last year's total by Friday. Thanks to all who contributed—the convention raised\
  \ $6,003 for Tubman Charities.</p> \n    <p>One of our international events this\
  \ upcoming weekend is PaizoCon Oz in Canberra, Australia. Venture-Captain Steve\
  \ Coling is the lead organizer. Activities include both Adventure Card Guild adventures\
  \ and Roleplaying Guild scenarios, including <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"><em>#7-99\
  \ Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>#8-00\
  \ The Cosmic Captive</em></a>. The event also features some fundraising activities\
  \ for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Looks like it is shaping up to be a great\
  \ event. Reports are that there still may be room, so check out the <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/pfsaustralia/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Society Australia Facebook page</a> for more information.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Announcement time! PaizoCon Oz 2017 is traveling to New Zealand. As part\
  \ of the move, the convention made some special arrangements with Hobbiton, of \"\
  Lord of the Rings\" fame. Attendance fee includes a tour of the Hobbiton village/film\
  \ set, as well as the opportunity to play an interactive special event in the Green\
  \ Dragon Inn! Due to the location and special events, attendee space at PaizoCon\
  \ Oz is limited. Once PaizoCon Oz 2016 is over, the team will start posting information\
  \ for next year's event on their Facebook page (link above).</p> \n    <p>Related\
  \ to conventions is the question of our special event content and when/where an\
  \ item can be ran. Here is the master list event organizers are using to determine\
  \ what events to schedule. Events are broken out by the requirements needed to run\
  \ each item. If an item is limited to a specific group of GMs, then it won't be\
  \ available for purchase in our webstore, but may be granted to GMs as part of the\
  \ convention support process.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Current Scenario\
  \ Rules as of September 20, 2016</h2> \n     <p>These scenarios may be run by any\
  \ 4-star or 5-star GM or a Venture-Officer at any time. They also may be run by\
  \ anybody at a convention. Any convention may schedule Bonekeep, as there are no\
  \ table minimums.</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>Bonekeep Level 1: The Silent Grave</em>\
  \ (Levels 3-7)</li> \n      <li><em>Bonekeep Level 2: Maze to the Mind Slave</em>\
  \ (Levels 3-7)</li> \n      <li><em>Bonekeep Level 3: The Wakening Tomb</em> (Levels\
  \ 5-9)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>These scenarios may be run anywhere, but only\
  \ by 4-star and 5-star GMs (and ONLY them—Venture-Officers may only run them if\
  \ they meet this requirement. VCs get a +2 and VLs a +1 to their star rating to\
  \ meet this requirement).</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>#6-98: Serpent's Rise</em>\
  \ (Levels 7 Special Pregens Only)</li> \n      <li><em>#7-97: Serpents' Ire</em>\
  \ (Level 8 Special Pregens Only)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>This scenario may be\
  \ run at Tier 4 and above conventions (26+ tables of PFS in a 3-day period) by 4-star\
  \ and 5-star GMs (and ONLY them—Venture-Officers may only run it if they meet this\
  \ requirement. VCs get a +2 and VLs a +1 to their star rating to meet this requirement).</p>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em> (Level 6 Special\
  \ Pregens Only)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>This scenario may be run anywhere but\
  \ only by 5-star GMs (and ONLY them...Venture-Officers may only run it if they meet\
  \ this requirement. VCs get a +2 and VLs a +1 to their star rating to meet this\
  \ requirement).</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>#6-99: True Dragons of Absalom</em>\
  \ (Level 4 Special Pregens Only)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>These scenarios may\
  \ be run anywhere if they meet the listed table minimum, are playing the scenario\
  \ simultaneously, and are in contact with each other.*</p> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"\
  ><b>3 Tables</b></p> \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>#2-SP: Year of the Shadow Lodge</em>\
  \ (Levels 1-11)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><b>4 Tables</b></p>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li><em>#4-SP: Race for the Runecarved Key</em> (Level 1-20)</li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <p class=\"collapse\"><b>5 Tables</b></p> \n     <ul>\n     \
  \ <li><em>#3-SP: Blood Under Absalom</em> (Levels 1-11)</li> \n      <li><em>#5-SP:\
  \ Siege of the Diamond City</em> (Levels 1-15)</li> \n      <li><em>#6-00: Legacy\
  \ of the Stonelords</em> (Levels 1-11)</li> \n      <li><em>#6-97: Siege of Serpents</em>\
  \ (Levels 1-11)</li> \n      <li><em>#7-00: The Sky Key Solution</em> (Levels 1-11)</li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <p class=\"tiny\"><i>*For purposes of qualifying for these specials,\
  \ you may add both Standard and Core tables add together. For example, if you had\
  \ 3 Standard tables and 1 Core table for Race for the Runecarved Key, that would\
  \ qualify as the 4 total tables you need to run the scenario.</i></p> \n     <p>These\
  \ scenarios may be run at conventions if there are 6 or more tables playing the\
  \ RPG scenario simultaneously and in contact with each other. To make sure areas\
  \ are not over-saturated, RVC approval must be received. To run the ACG component,\
  \ an event must have at least 2 tables with 2 players each:</p> \n     <ul>\n  \
  \    <li><em>#8-00 The Cosmic Captive</em> (Levels 1-11)</li>\n     </ul> \n   \
