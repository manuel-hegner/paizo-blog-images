  \      <p>Designed by Jenny Jarzabski</p>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">This\
  \ encounter takes place on a planet deep in the Vast that’s currently occupied by\
  \ Azlanti Star Empire forces. Talk to your players about why their characters are\
  \ there. They might be rebel forces infiltrating or attacking an imperial base,\
  \ prisoners of war escaping a holding facility, spies sabotaging an imperial operation,\
  \ or deserters who have decided to strike back against their former empire. Playing\
  \ these roles isn’t required, but might inspire some fun table banter.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>The forces occupying this world are Sihedron guards: faceless troopers encased\
  \ in sleek purple armor who serve their fascist empire without question, cruelly\
  \ subjugating the peoples of the star systems they conquer. They can’t be negotiated\
  \ with, and they always shoot first. The Sihedron guards fight to the death to defend\
  \ their twisted ideology and maintain what they incorrectly believe is their natural\
  \ superiority.</p>\n      <p>This encounter occurs after a lull in the battle. The\
  \ PCs know that a Sihedron squad is converging on their position. Prompt the PCs\
  \ to get into position and set up for battle, then have everyone roll initiative,\
  \ choosing skills based on how their characters approach preparing for combat.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Map:</strong> Use the urban side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Enormous\
  \ Battlefield </em>for this encounter.</p>\n      <p><strong>Creatures:</strong>\
  \ An elite Sihedron commander leads a squad of 8 Sihedron guards into the fray.\
  \ Starting positions for this battle can be anywhere, but enemies should begin the\
  \ encounter at least 100 feet away from the PCs. When combat begins, the commander\
  \ Leads the Charge, ordering a group of Sihedron guards (one per player at your\
  \ table) to advance. The other Sihedron guards hang back and attack from a distance,\
  \ repositioning after the frontliners fall with the help of their commander’s Rally\
  \ the Troops ability.</p>\n      <p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> If you have six\
  \ or more players at your table, you’ll likely want to add at least two more Sihedron\
  \ guards to this encounter. These reinforcements begin by hanging back and sniping\
  \ from a distance. If the party takes out the other targets too quickly, the backup\
  \ snipers advance into range of the PCs’ abilities. Another squad of Sihedron guards\
  \ (using the same statistics) patrol the base. If all the players are having fun\
  \ and want to keep playing, they can ambush the patrol by succeeding at Stealth\
  \ checks against the squad leader’s Perception modifier (+16), or alternatively,\
  \ the patrol ambushes the PCs as they’re trying to carry out their mission!</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Design Notes:</strong> This encounter is intended to test out\
  \ the tech playtest classes while providing an open map where ranged attacks, distant\
  \ spells, turrets, and mines can shine. The encounter provides plentiful enemies\
  \ to give characters a chance to try out using area attacks and spells against a\
  \ group. Please let us know in the comments or forums how this encounter played\
  \ out for your group!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ creature within your reach uses a manipulate&nbsp;action or a&nbsp;move&nbsp;action,\
  \ makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it’s using; <strong>Effect</strong>\
  \ You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the\
  \ triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a&nbsp;manipulate&nbsp;action,\
  \ you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack\

  \ the Charge</strong> [two-actions] The commander Strides twice. If they end this\

  \ target of this Strike and ignore any cover the commander provides the target.\
  \ <br><strong>Rally the Troops </strong>[two-actions] (auditory, concentrate, mental)\
  \ The commander issues an order for their allies to regroup. All Sihedron guard\
  \ allies within 120 feet of the commander can use a reaction to Stride up to their\
  \ Speed. Any Sihedron guards who end their movement adjacent to another Sihedron\
  \ guard gain 5 temporary Hit Points that last 1 minute, or double that number of\
  \ temporary Hit Points if they end their movement adjacent to the commander. The\
  \ commander can’t Rally the Troops again for 1d4 rounds. <br><strong>Tactical Strike</strong>\
  \ [one-action] (auditory, mental) <strong>Frequency</strong> once per round; <strong>Effect</strong>\
  \ The commander calls out an enemy within 60 feet then makes a Strike against that\
  \ enemy, dealing an additional 1d6 precision damage on a hit. If the hit is successful,\
  \ the commander changes the tide of the battle, inspiring their allies to greater\
  \ feats of military prowess. All sihedron guards within 60 feet of the commander\
  \ gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls until the beginning of the commander’\
  s next turn.</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"\
