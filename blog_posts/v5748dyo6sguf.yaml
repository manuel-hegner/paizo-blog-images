  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week we started looking\
  \ at the forthcoming Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures set of pre-painted\
  \ plastic miniatures from our partners at WizKids. This week we’ll explore the Goblin\
  \ Village premium set that releases alongside the Huge booster-based set. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Longtime goblin fans will notice a lot of nods to past goblin adventures\
  \ in this premium set. When we first started designing this set, I knew we needed\
  \ to include iconic goblin elements from Pathfinder’s long history, and we plumbed\
  \ not just our past adventures like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy7zkr?Pathfinder-1-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Chapter-1-Burnt-Offerings\"\
  >Burnt Offerings </a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5w\">We Be\
  \ Goblins!</a>, but also the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins\"\
  >“Goblins!”</a> comics from Dynamite Entertainment.</p> \n     <p>Included in the\
  \ set are the following components:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n  \

  \ large enough to hold most of the other components based on the needs of their\
  \ campaign. That might be a series of tents and the tribe’s magic pig in its pen,\
  \ or a clutch of goblin babies, ready to present adventurers with a moral quandary\
  \ about what to do with these innocent balls of destruction. It might be a bonfire\
  \ to honor the junk effigy worshiped by the superstitious tribe, or a war council\
  \ overseen by the presiding chief. The possibilities are endless!</p> \n     <div\

  \ that has yet to be revealed is the goblin ankle-slasher (Small uncommon), as both\
  \ the preview and standard versions of the goblin dog-slicer and goblin guard appeared\
  \ in previous blogs, and we looked at the goblin horse-chopper “sculpt-share” last\

  \ Pathfinder Second Edition, and we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to include\
  \ some figures based on Wayne’s designs in this set. In this set, you will find\
  \ the bugbear mauler (Medium common), hobgoblin sharpshooter (Medium common), hobgoblin\
  \ commander (Medium rare), and bugbear butcher (Medium rare) as well as those goblinoids\
