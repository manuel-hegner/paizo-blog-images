  \    </div> \n    <p><i>Careful observers may have noted that a number of recent\
  \ Pathfinder products credit a few new names as lead developer, namely Thurston\
  \ Hillman and Ron Lundeen. We have since brought Thurston on as the full-time developer\
  \ of our Starfinder Society organized play program, but Ron already had a full-time\
  \ gig (can you believe how much he writes and now develops for us in addition to\
  \ a 40-hour work week?!) so we had to settle for using his talents on what projects\
  \ he had time for. Among the first I had the pleasure of working with him on was\
  \ </i><a href=\"/products/btpy9tom?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Adventurers-Armory-2\"\
  >Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory 2</a><i>—the follow-up to our\
  \ most popular Pathfinder Player Companion to date. Here are a few words from Ron\
  \ on his favorite parts of the book.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Oh, and many thanks to\
  \ Ron for helping out when we needed it! You're a genuine hero, sir. —Mark Moreland,\
  \ Developer</i></p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As <em>Adventurer's Armory\
  \ 2</em> is now hitting shelves and downloads everywhere, I wanted to talk about\
  \ two of my favorite sections. Mark Moreland has been like my Yoda through this\
  \ process, and he is going to pen a follow-up <em>Adventurer's Armory 2</em> blog\
  \ where he rolls up his sleeves (like on a spider-silk bodysuit, page 6) and pulls\
  \ back the veil (as found in dancer's garb, page 29) on getting the most out of\
  \ this book (such as any of its 8 new equipment tricks). So I won't steal his thunder\
  \ (as delivered by a stormshaft javelin, page 9). Okay, no more games (like the\
  \ imperial conquest board game, page 29).</p> \n    <p>First up are equipment packages.\
  \ These are designed to include everything you'd need for your PC's first few adventures.\
  \ These are more expansive than existing class-based kits (such as a sorcerer's\
  \ kit), as they include weapons, armor, and even a few minor magic items. If you\
  \ don't like the detailed accounting of purchasing starting equipment, or if you\
  \ get overwhelmed by all the options, equipment packages will definitely interest\
  \ you. They are designed by role or theme (such as \"Daring Bravo\" or \"Wilderness\
  \ Warrior\"), and not by class, so each equipment package is attractive to a wide\
  \ range of PCs. Equipment packages are expensive—each is worth around 1,000 gp—\
  so a starting character usually obtains them as a gift from a wealthy patron (when\
  \ permitted by the GM), after a big score in an early adventure, or through the\
  \ Well-Provisioned Adventurer equipment trait (which lets you select any equipment\
  \ package in place of your normal starting gold). Equipment packages take a lot\
  \ of the detailed work out of shopping and allow a PC to quickly hit the table running.\
  \ An example? Sure! The Holy Warrior equipment package provides good defense and\
  \ a great selection of gear for overcoming DR, swarms, and enchantments.</p> \n\

  \ to use her might and zeal to take the fight to the enemy, but she understands\
  \ the importance of having the right equipment to overcome the resistances of her\
  \ monstrous foes. This equipment package is well-suited to a cleric, inquisitor<sup>APG</sup>,\
  \ paladin, warpriest<sup>ACG</sup>, or even a fighter with a religious background.\
  \ It's especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members\
  \ and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment\
  \ packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this\
  \ package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC's faith. If the PC\
  \ can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.</p> \n      <p><b>Armor</b>: Heavy\
  \ steel shield, masterwork breastplate.<br> <b>Weapons</b>: Cold iron morningstar,\
  \ heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword.<br> <b>Combat Gear</b>: Alchemist's\
  \ fire (3), holy water (4), <i>oil of bless weapon</i>, <i>potions of cure light\
  \ wounds</i> (2), <i>potion of protection from evil</i>, sunrods (3).<br> <b>Other\
  \ Gear</b>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, candles (5), chalk (5 pieces), crowbar,\
  \ flint and steel, holy symbol (silver), mess kit<sup>UE</sup>, sack, silk rope\

  \ \n    <p>My absolute favorite section in <em>Adventurer's Armory 2</em>—and perhaps\
  \ my favorite spread in any Player Companion book—is poppets. Poppets! So loveably\
  \ cute, so utterly disposable! Ahem. These simple constructs are helpful and loyal\
  \ critters, but they're pretty fragile. Here's what a base poppet looks like:</p>\

  \ pick up a poppet with the Craft Poppet feat (available at 1st level), the Poppet\
  \ Familiar feat (available to 3rd-level casters able to take a familiar), or buying\
  \ one along with its ownership token—for which you'll pay about as much as you would\
  \ for a masterwork weapon. But your little poppet need not stay feeble for long!\
  \ You can augment your poppets with more abilities (such as fire-resistant sealant,\
  \ climbing hooks, or armor), and even get a larger poppet. Although the rules say\
  \ it's \"Small in size,\" I prefer to think of it as \"the size of a toddler\"—\
  and twice as cute!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9481-PoppetCloth.jpg\"\
