  Year 7 (2009)</h1>\n            <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n             <h2>Launching\
  \ Our Own RPG</h2>\n             <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 27, 2012</p>\n\
  \             <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><em>This blog entry is the eighth\
  \ in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\"\
  >Click here to read the first installment</a>.</em></p>\n             <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">One of the things that has plagued Paizo through most of its existence\
  \ is that every year, we end up throwing a major project or two on top of an already\
  \ full product release schedule. In 2005, it was the Shackled City hardcover. In\
  \ 2006, it was the Dragon Compendium, Monster Ecologies and the Kill Doctor Lucky\
  \ board game. In 2007, we launched our Adventure Paths and Modules lines as well\
  \ as the Stonehenge board game. In 2008, we published the hardcover campaign setting\
  \ sourcebook and launched the Player Companion line, and we ran the Pathfinder RPG\
  \ playtest as well.</span></p>\n             <p>Surprise! 2009 wasn't any different.\
  \ And this time, we were taking on perhaps the biggest add-ons yet: the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy88yj\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a>, weighing in at 576\
  \ pages, and the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Bestiary</em></a>, with its\
  \ hefty 328 pages. All told, we were adding more than 900 pages to our regular workload.\
  \ It ended up requiring hundreds of hours of overtime and the combined effort of\
  \ dozens of employees.</p>\n             <p>One of the first decisions to make was\
  \ the physical form that our rulebooks would take. Traditionally, the core D&amp;D\
  \ rules encompassed three volumes: the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide,\
  \ and the Monster Manual. We thought about following a similar format for Pathfinder,\
  \ but it had always bugged us that players needed to own the DMG if they wanted\
  \ to look up magic items, so we decided to wrap all of the information that you\
  \ would need to run a game of Pathfinder, minus the monster writeups, into a single\
  \ Core Rulebook. The Bestiary would remain its own book.</p>\n             <p>We\
  \ also had to make a huge decision about how far we were going to stray from the\
  \ 3.5 SRD. Our alpha playtest had introduced a number of new systems that pushed\
  \ the boundaries of backwards compatibility. Ultimately, we decided to keep Pathfinder\
  \ fairly close to its 3.5 roots while using years and years of GM experiences to\
  \ update and fine-tune the system. We certainly didn't fix everything we could have\
  \ in 3.5—some issues are endemic to the math underlying the core system—but we did\
  \ fix a lot of the problem areas.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurb180\">\n \
  \             <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120927-Whiteboard.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120927-Whiteboard_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> The white board\
  \ lets the editors exercise their inner artistic talents.\n             </div>\n\
  \             <p>So why did we swing the pendulum toward backward compatibility?\
  \ Because our customers were telling us that they didn't want their trove of 3.0\
  \ and 3.5 books to become obsolete. Everyone had a pile of Wizards of the Coast\
  \ products, of course, but the OGL and the d20 license had also inspired an explosion\
  \ of print and PDF books the likes of which the gaming industry had never before\
  \ seen. And we really wanted people to be able to use all of those products with\
  \ Pathfinder. For the most part, I think that we did a good job striking the balance\
  \ between compatibility and innovation.</p>\n             <p>Not surprisingly, the\
  \ new RPG had a huge effect on the rest of our product lines. Since we were launching\
  \ a new system at Gen Con, all of the other products scheduled to be released from\
  \ that date forward needed reflect the new rules. The problem is that we usually\
  \ contract freelance writers eight months or so before the intended release date\
  \ of a product, and the rules were still in flux at that point. What to do?</p>\n\
  \             <p>We decided to contract in-house authors to write the first adventures\
  \ and adventure path volumes for the new game. Since our own people were working\
  \ with the new rules as they were being written, we figured that they would be in\
  \ the best position to use those rules to write adventures. Even hedging our bets\
  \ that way, we still had lots of issues, but at least they could be worked out in\
  \ person and in real time, rather than via email or telephone. Still, not a task\
  \ for the faint of heart. Whenever possible, we also planned products that were\
  \ relatively rules light for much of the year.</p>\n             <div style=\"width:\

  \ </div>\n             <p>As we prepared to send the game to the printer, we faced\
  \ another big question—how many Core Rulebooks should we print? Until this book,\
  \ we'd mainly printed adventures and campaign sourcebooks, products aimed pretty\
  \ much exclusively at GMs. Now, for the first time, we had a book that was aimed\
  \ at players. We ended up setting a print run three times as big as any other print\
  \ run we had ever made. The cost was staggering and a bit unnerving. But distributor\
  \ orders flooded in, and we sold out of our first print run before it even arrived\
  \ from the printer! We were floored. We thought that the Pathfinder RPG was going\
  \ to do well, but none of us thought that we'd sell out of a print run three times\
  \ bigger than any other print run... and before the product was even released. It\
  \ gave us an early indication of the success that the Pathfinder RPG was going to\
  \ have. We ended up setting our second print run even higher than the first, committing\
  \ Paizo to TWO staggering print bills before any money even came in from the first\
  \ sale!</p>\n             <p>Of course, shipping all those books around the world\
  \ also ended up being a bit of a struggle. We always pride ourselves in doing a\
  \ great job of packing our shipments, but the hardcover Core Rulebook made us re-evaluate\
  \ our processes, eventually leading us to use book corners to keep the books pristine.\
  \ Another hurdle was the weight of the book. In 2007, the USPS discontinued surface\
  \ mail, meaning that everything now goes by air, and international shipping costs\
  \ go through the roof if your parcel weighs more than four pounds. The Core Rulebook\
  \ exceeds that limit before you even add the weight of box and packaging materials!\
  \ To this day, customer service continues to deal with a ton of emails and messageboard\
  \ posts from customers complaining about the cost of shipping the Core Rulebook.</p>\n\
  \             <p>We also had a big debate when it came to pricing the Core Rulebook\
  \ PDF. Normally, our PDFs are priced at about 70% of the cover price of the corresponding\
  \ print edition, a formula that would result in a price of $34.99 for the Core Rulebook\
  \ PDF. But we had already decided to post the rules themselves for free on the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd\">Pathfinder Reference Document</a>, so the price to\
  \ have them neatly laid out and beautifully illustrated needed to be something much\
  \ closer to \"free.\" We ended up settling on $9.99, and right out of the gate,\
  \ PDF sales were astounding. We earned so much goodwill from that decision that\
  \ we've continued to offer all of our rulebooks in PDF form at that price.</p>\n\
  \             <p>We also had to decide how we were going to let other publishers\
  \ interact with the Pathfinder rules. We had long been believers in the OGL, so\
  \ we never considered anything other than making our rules completely open. However,\
  \ the OGL specifically prohibits publishers from saying their products are compatible\
  \ with trademarked brands like \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" or \"Pathfinder\" without\
  \ another agreement, so we came up with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Compatibility\
  \ License, which has allowed the existence of hundreds upon hundreds of Pathfinder\
  \ RPG–compatible products by dozens and dozens of publishers. The growth of the\
  \ third-party community has been one of my favorite parts of the whole Pathfinder\
  \ RPG business.</p>\n             <p>We also created our <a href=\"/paizo/about/communityuse\"\
  >Community Use Policy</a>, which has allowed customers and fans to create an incredible\
  \ diversity of free products, websites, and other materials that expand our game\
  \ and our world in ways that we never imagined.</p>\n             <p>One great example\
  \ of this community collaboration is Wayfinder. Originally plotted as a fanzine\
  \ to be given away at the first official PaizoCon, Wayfinder has become a biannual\
  \ publication that <a href=\"/products/btpy8tha\">recently released issue #7</a>.\
  \ It has earned a lot of praise from the gaming community, even garnering its own\
  \ ENnie award nominations. Liz Courts originally helmed the editor-in-chief role\
  \ for Wayfinder, but she turned that title over to PaizoCon founder Tim Nightingale\
  \ when we hired her on at Paizo.</p>\n             <p>One benefit of the success\
  \ of Pathfinder is the ability to license other companies to produce Pathfinder\
  \ products. One such deal in 2009 was with Q-Workshop, to produce <a href=\"/store/gameAids/dice/byManufacturer/qWorkshop/byStyle/pathfinder\"\
  >a line of dice themed around our Adventure Paths</a>. To date, they've released\
  \ six sets of Pathfinder dice.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    \
  \          <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120927-Mini.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120927-Mini_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> The sculpt for Reaper's first original Pathfinder miniature\
  \ is unveiled at Gen Con!\n             </div>\n             <p>In 2009, we landed\
  \ one of our bigger licenses in Reaper, producing <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/reaper\"\
  >unpainted metal miniatures</a>. We had initially licensed Crocodile Games to make\
  \ Pathfinder minis, and their figures were great, but they were just coming out\
  \ too slowly for us. So after a year or so, we decided to give Reaper a call to\
  \ see if they were interested. Imagine our surprise when we not only received a\
  \ \"yes\" but a resounding \"Hell yes!\" from them. With two to four minis released\
  \ every month, Reaper has built up quite a stash, with 153 different figures in\
  \ release or on the way as I type this!</p>\n             <p>The second year of\
  \ our <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> contest saw an increase in the\
  \ number of contestants. Original judge Erik Mona had to drop out as we were keeping\
  \ him way too busy, so Sean K Reynolds came in as his replacement. Contestant Neil\
  \ Spicer emerged as the victor with his <a href=\"/products/btpy8d52\"><em>Realm\
  \ of the Fellnight Queen</em></a> proposal. Neil is the quintessential RPG Superstar:\
  \ hitherto undiscovered talent that Paizo has since come to rely upon. Since his\
  \ victory, Neil has authored five Adventure Path volumes (contributing to Kingmaker,\
  \ Serpent's Skull, Carrion Crown, Jade Regent and Skull &amp; Shackles), and he\
  \ has gone on to become one of RPG Superstar's best judges as well! In its first\
  \ two years, RPG Superstar had already brought Paizo a number of great freelancers,\
  \ as well as two employees—not a bad start!</p>\n             <p>2009 was also the\
  \ year we took over <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> as an official Paizo convention.\
  \ We were all impressed with the job Tim Nightingale did with 2008's fan-run PaizoCon,\
  \ but it was clear to everyone that it could be so much more if we as a company\
  \ got behind it. Interestingly enough, the impetus for this move saw its genesis\
  \ in another convention, the Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio. Origins had been\
  \ a big and important convention dating back to the '70s. For decades, Origins and\
  \ Gen Con were the cornerstones of the summer convention season for many publishers.\
  \ But over the years, Gen Con had grown in prominence on the national stage while\
  \ Origins slipped away to become a large regional show. Paizo had been going to\
  \ Origins since our inception, but we'd been spending an increasing amount of money\
  \ attending the show each year. Sending a large portion of our staff across the\
  \ country, providing them food and lodging, buying space in the dealer hall, and\
  \ shipping our booth and product across the country is very expensive, and sales\
  \ in the dealer hall continued to decline each year as attendence fell. So we decided\
  \ to make a corporate decision—if we were going to (hopefully) just break even each\
  \ year on a convention, we might as well make it one that we owned, right here in\
  \ the Seattle area.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurb180\">\n              <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120927-GenConBooks.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120927-GenConBooks_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> A mountain of Core Rulebooks awaits the swarm of gamers on the\
  \ first day of Gen Con! There are more copies underneath the black cloth... and\
  \ we sold them all!\n             </div>\n             <p>So we reached out to Tim\
  \ and asked him if we could take over PaizoCon for 2009. He gladly accepted and\
  \ we were off to the races! Our first problem was securing a location. Tim's 2008\
  \ PaizoCon had around 50 attendees, and since we were aiming to have three or four\
  \ times that many people for PaizoCon 2009, we needed a bigger space. We soon learned\
  \ that most hotels are either set up for small corporate conferences the size of\
  \ the first PaizoCon, or they're optimized for thousands of attendees. It seemed\
  \ we were exactly the wrong size. After months of searching, we stumbled across\
  \ the Coast Hotel in Bellevue, just minutes from where our office was. Its size\
  \ proved perfect for the next couple of years as the con was growing. We were able\
  \ to take most of the rooms in the hotel, packing it with gamers from top to bottom.\
  \ The Coast gave PaizoCon a very intimate feeling that suited us just fine. We ended\
  \ up having just over 200 paid attendees for PaizoCon 2009, plus another 50 or so\
  \ guests and staffers. Our first ever Guest of Honor was super designer Monte Cook\
  \ and his wife Sue, while our first artist Guest of Honor was Eva Widermann.</p>\n\
  \             <p>One of the big surprises for us was how well the Paizo store did\
  \ at the show. We'd anticipated that only the most hardcore Paizo enthusiasts would\
  \ journey all the way out to Seattle to attend PaizoCon, and hardcore fans—pretty\
  \ much by definition—tend to already have everything you've made. So we expected\
  \ sales to be tepid at best. To our surprise, we've eclipsed our budget for the\
  \ Paizo store each year at the con.</p>\n             <p>Gen Con was a very big\
  \ deal for Paizo in 2009, for it was the first public release of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.\
  \ Our big question for the show: How many <em>Core Rulebooks</em> do we bring to\
  \ sell? Memories of the year we brought too many copies of the Shackled City hardcover\
  \ haunted us. We wanted to have enough rulebooks to last the entire convention,\
  \ but we didn't want to ship pallets of the books home if we brought too many. To\
  \ complicate matters, we knew that the quantity we were earmarking for Gen Con would\
  \ be among the very last unsold copies of the first printing of the book, so for\
  \ many folks, this was going to be one of the only ways to get the book for a few\
  \ months while we waited on the reprint. We decided to go big, bringing a ton of\
  \ books to the con, using cases of books to build a huge table in the middle of\
  \ our booth, stacking more books on top.</p>\n             <p>When the doors opened\
  \ on the first day of the show, the tidal wave of customers rushing to our booth\
  \ was staggering. Chaos ensued, and it took the combined might of the entire Paizo\
  \ staff to wrangle a semblance of order to the line, which wrapped around our booth\
  \ once and then tailed off into the art show next door. In order to get people through\
  \ the line quickly, I borrowed an idea from White Wolf's successful Gen Con launch\
  \ of the Werewolf RPG. I quickly grabbed Erik Mona, and we gathered a box and a\
  \ pile of books and headed down the line. If anybody in line was buying only the\
  \ <em>Core Rulebook</em>, they could give us $60 cash—the cost of the Core Rulebook\
  \ plus sales tax, rounded up to avoid making change—and leave the line, book in\
  \ hand. Dozens and dozens of people took us up on our offer, and we were able to\
  \ cut the line down to a paltry two-hour wait! Amazingly, we did a nearly perfect\
  \ job predicting the number of books we needed, selling our last copies late on\
  \ Sunday!</p>\n             <center>\n              <table>\n               <tbody>\n\

  \             </ul>\n             <p>When we got back from Gen Con, there was no\
  \ rest for the weary; we had to move our entire operation from our old office in\
  \ Bellevue to our new office in Redmond. For much of the previous year, we had been\
  \ desperately searching for new office space to suit our changing needs. When we\
  \ moved into our Bellevue office a few years before, we were a magazine business\
  \ with a fledgling e-commerce store. Our warehouse needs were small. As our business\
  \ had shifted to book publishing, pallets of new products were filling our warehouse,\
  \ spilling over into the underground parking garage. We needed new office space\
  \ with a seriously large warehouse, and soon. But on Seattle's east side, a fairly\
  \ large office space adjoining a fairly large warehouse space is not a common combination.\
  \ We searched high and low, and only at the last minute did we find the space we\
  \ are currently in. Our new space had been leased by two separate tenants who both\
  \ went bankrupt at the same time, leaving the landlord with half a building and\
  \ a big warehouse to fill. He was very excited when we said we would take over the\
  \ space with only minor changes.</p>\n             <p>As 2009 came to an end, Paizo\
  \ was firmly settled into our new digs, and the <em>Core Rulebook</em> was selling\
  \ so well that we were already preparing for a third printing. The <em>Bestiary</em>\
  \ had just been released and was also seeing great sales. It was looking like Paizo\
  \ was going to weather the shift to our own RPG game system with flying colors.\
  \ Now we had the challenge of building on the successes of 2009 to establish Pathfinder\
  \ as the preeminent brand in RPG gaming. A lofty task that was going to take a lot\
  \ of hard work and a little bit of luck...</p>\n             <p><b>Employees who\

  \ Paizo staff!\n             </div>\n             <p>My time with Paizo began with\
  \ the inaugural RPG Superstar competition in 2008. I was living in Prague, Czech\
  \ Republic at the time, and entered the contest on a whim. I ended up as one of\
  \ the Top Four finalists, which led to my first freelance gig for Paizo, working\
  \ on the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting. From that time on, I was hooked.\
  \ I went to Gen Con UK in Reading, England specifically to meet Erik Mona, Jason\
  \ Bulmahn, and Josh Frost (and joined Erik's trivia-dominating \"Coalition of the\
  \ Willing\" team), and to play in Season 0 of Pathfinder Society organized play.\
  \ And I kept bugging James Jacobs and Wes Schneider for more freelance work.</p>\n\
  \             <p>By 2009, I knew I wanted to work at Paizo full time. There were\
  \ only two problems: I was still living in Europe, and Paizo didn't seem to be hiring.\
  \ I decided to go and meet some of the Paizo staff in person, to put more names\
  \ to faces, and even more importantly, give them a face to go with the name of their\
  \ freelancer-in-Europe whom most of them had only talked to in emails. I flew back\
  \ to the States to attend PaizoCon 2009, and while I was there, I made a point of\
  \ mentioning to Lisa, Erik, James, and Wes that I wanted to work for Paizo, that\
  \ I was willing to move back to the US to do so, and to keep me in my mind if they\
  \ had any job opportunities.</p>\n             <p>In September, an editorial assistant\
  \ position at Paizo did open up, and I wasted no time applying for it, once more\
  \ assuring Wes that I was definitely willing and able to move back to the States\
  \ for the job. After an editing test, a Skype interview (the only interview question\
  \ I remember is Lisa asking me what class would I be if I were a Pathfinder RPG\
  \ character), and lots of emails back and forth, I sat back to wait, and worked\
  \ on convincing my European wife, whom I had just married a couple of weeks before,\
  \ that moving to the US was a good thing.</p>\n             <p>I received word that\
  \ I got the job in the middle of my honeymoon in Greece, and suddenly my wife and\
  \ I had to start preparing for the move we had talked about but never really thought\
  \ would happen. I had less than a month to get everything ready to move from Prague\
  \ to the Seattle area, and on November 1, I started my first official day working\
  \ for Paizo. Since then, I've moved from editing to development, and now I spend\
  \ most of my time developing the Pathfinder Adventure Path.</p>\n             <p>Almost\
  \ three years later, I still have trouble believing how everything worked out. Like\
  \ almost every gamer, I used to dream of being a game designer, but I never seriously\
  \ pursued that goal and never thought it would happen. I entered RPG Superstar on\
  \ a whim, and fell in love with writing and working for Paizo.</p>\n           \
  \  <p>I can honestly say that this is the best job I have ever had, and though it's\
  \ hard work a lot of the time, it's also fun. Every day, I get to work with some\
  \ of the best freelancers in the industry, and collaborate with amazing people who\
  \ are passionate about their work and their play at a company that truly cares about\
  \ its employees, its fans, and the game we all love.</p>\n             <p>Rob McCreary<br><em>Developer</em></p>\n\
  \             <h2>Customer Carebear Stare!</h2>\n             <p>Mostly by sheer\
  \ chance and dumb luck, I ended up in a gaming group with a GM who was really excited\
  \ about this Pathfinder thing. He convinced the group to try out the Beta Playtest,\
  \ and was also able to convince me to go to PaizoCon and tack on a banquet ticket.</p>\n\
  \             <p>The staff I met were super friendly, willing to just hang out and\
  \ chat, and the members of the community I met were very inclusive. I left wishing\
  \ I knew game design, not because I wanted to design games, but because I wanted\
  \ to work at Paizo.</p>\n             <p>Several months later, someone in my gaming\
  \ group casually mentioned Paizo was hiring for customer service. The listing had\
  \ been up for a while, so I knew I needed to act fast. I nearly talked myself out\
  \ of applying a million times. In the end it came down to knowing that never trying\
  \ would hurt worse than the rejection of not being chosen.</p>\n             <p>I\
  \ was asked to come in for an interview. I can't even begin to describe the nervous\
  \ panic. Butterflies in the stomach, palms sweating, I sat in the conference room\
  \ waiting, and then Cosmo poked his head in to let me know it would be just a few\
  \ minutes until Lisa was ready. The CEO? In my interview? Ack! I did my best to\
  \ stay outwardly calm while my insides turned to jelly. However, Lisa, Jeff, and\
  \ Cosmo were great, and it immediately felt like a conversation rather than an interview.\
  \ I kept realizing over and over how much I wanted to work with these people. The\
  \ atmosphere and company philosophy were exactly what I was looking for. I left\
  \ convinced Paizo would be perfect for me, but I was sure I would never get the\
  \ position.</p>\n             <p>When Jeff called and offered me the job, I was\
  \ through the roof. Uprooting to a whole new job and learning on a sharp curve?\
  \ Bring it! Commute twice as long? Sure. Considerable pay cut? I'd make it work.</p>\n\
  \             <p>And I am so glad I did.</p>\n             <p>I found a job where\
  \ I not only like my coworkers, but I like the customers. I found a company that\
  \ actually cares about all levels of employees and actively encourages thinking\
  \ about how to make things better for the customers. I was completely shell-shocked\
  \ the first time I made a suggestion to Cosmo, and he said \"Yeah, that's a good\
  \ idea; go talk to the tech team and see if it's possible.\" And then the tech team\
  \ said, \"We'll have it ready the next time we roll the site.\" And then the next\
  \ time they rolled the site, there it was: my idea, out there, making customers'\
  \ experiences better! I found a place where I feel like I fit in.</p>\n        \
  \     <p>I also found a husband, so that might be biasing my experience slightly.</p>\n\
