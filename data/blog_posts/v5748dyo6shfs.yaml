  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">As the campaign evolves,\
  \ we often take time to review some of our decisions. Recently, we’ve discussed\
  \ the qualifications for GMs achieving 5 novas. After parsing feedback from the\
  \ community, we acknowledge the current path of reaching 5-Novas only works for\
  \ people who can regularly attend conventions and that we need to provide other\
  \ paths to the 5 nova goal. </p> \n      <p>As we looked at the issue, we discussed\
  \ why each of the requirements for 5 novas existed and what being a 5 nova GM means.\
  \ At the heart of the matter, GMs who achieve 5 novas aren’t just putting in time\
  \ and running games; they foster their communities and are ambassadors for table-top\
  \ roleplaying games. This necessitates GMs need to engage a playerbase beyond their\
  \ local game. It also means GMs need a solid set of GM skills that enhance player\
  \ experiences. The requirement of 10 special scenarios helps measure a candidate's\
  \ community engagement.</p> \n      <p>Designating <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02518\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1–98: Into the Perplexity: The First Trial</em></a> as\
  \ a qualifying special made sense, but it didn’t go far enough in fixing the access\
  \ problem. In truth, the team had some fears of this special scenario being run\
  \ repeatedly for those who wanted their 5-Novas, which could diminish some of the\
  \ special nature of this unique scenario. After reviewing all of this, the Organized\
  \ Play team has come up with a solution that we think will resolve most of the issues\
  \ going forward.</p> \n      <p><b>Our Solution</b>: We’re going to take a batch\
  \ of existing scenarios and make them 5-Nova qualifying scenarios, but with a maximum\
  \ limit of credit. Each of these scenarios will now provide a maximum of 3 sessions\
  \ worth of credit towards earning your 5th Nova. This means that a GM can run these\
  \ up to 3 times to get credit towards their 5-Novas, with any subsequent runs not\
  \ counting towards your 5-Nova qualification but still granting other GM credit\
  \ as normal (such as number of games run).</p> \n      <p>The list of scenarios\
  \ is as follows:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4z\"\
  >Starfinder Society #1-39: The Herald’s War</a> (Levels 7–10)*</li> \n       <li><a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023cx?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-224-Cornered-Rat\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-24: Cornered Rat</a> (Levels 9–12)</li> \n       <li>Starfinder\
  \ Society #3-20: TBA Name (Levels 11–14)</li> \n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02518\"\
  >Starfinder Society #1-98: Into the Perplexity: The First Trial</a> (Levels 3–6)</li>\
  \ \n      </ul> \n      <p>This change to qualifying events now provides a total\
  \ of 12 potential credits towards your 5th Nova that are not convention specials.\
  \ This means there is now an established path in place to get your 5-Nova without\
  \ attending conventions.</p> \n      <p>To work with our reporting system, we automatically\
  \ converted all prior runs of the above scenarios to being “special qualifiers”\
  \ and made new reporting sections for non-qualifying runs of the game. <b>Event\
  \ reporters: please ensure you are choosing the correct reportable section when\
  \ reporting these tables.</b></p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \      </div> \n      <p>Due to its unique nature, 1-98 will also have a 4-Nova\
  \ GM restriction as well as a stipulation that players cannot use pregens for this\
  \ scenario. While these restrictions may seem excessive, they should make a lot\
  \ of sense as to why they exist once you play the scenario. There is also a request\
  \ not to reveal the surprise or spoil the scenario for others.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ putting together the list of qualifying specials, we recognize that without 4\
  \ scenarios in this pool, GMs would be 1-credit shy of meeting the 10 special qualification.\
  \ The asterisk by 1-39 represents that it is a “temporary” qualifying scenario.\
  \ What that means, is that if you’ve run it in the past it will count towards your\
  \ 5-Nova qualifications. It will continue to count in this manner until we have\
  \ a suitable high-level scenario in Season 4 that will go above the level range\
  \ allowed by pregens, which is our ideal goal for these scenarios to fill. Once\
  \ such a scenario comes out, our intent is to “retire” 1-39 from this rotation.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>This system should address the rightful concerns from the community\
  \ about the accessibility of 5-Novas, while also ensuring that the qualifications\
  \ for special scenarios are still something important, not something people can\
  \ just easily grind out as they would a normal scenario, and emphasize the community\
  \ involvement aspect of being a 5 nova.</p> \n      <p>While we are implementing\
  \ these changes to the Starfinder Society program immediately, we are already formulating\
  \ an equivalent path to 5 glyphs for the Pathfinder Society program and will release\
  \ that list shortly. </p> \n      <p>Go forth, enjoy, and good luck to all those\
  \ of you on your quest to hit your 5th Nova!</p> \n      <p>Until next time, </p>\n\
