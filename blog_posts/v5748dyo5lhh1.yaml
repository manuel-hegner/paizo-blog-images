  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: A Meeting in Ruins</h2>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">\"There!\"\
  \ Akina thrust her maulaxe out, pointing to the craggy ruins on the hillside. \"\
  Told you I smelled hobgoblin stink. We'll have our pay by morning.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Durgan sniffed the crisp air as they emerged from the woods. \"Dunno how you\
  \ do it, Kina. I can't smell a thing beyond all this pine.\"</p> \n     <p>One of\
  \ the other mercenaries, a shaggy-haired human with a notched lip, belted a coarse\
  \ laugh. \"I betcha it's 'cause dwarves got such big sniffers, y'know?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>His mirth died off as Akina turned and glared at him from under the brim\
  \ of her iron helm, which had been fashioned in the shape of a ram's head with curling\
  \ horns. The rest of the band stepped ever so slightly away from the would-be-jester.\
  \ Their number included a dozen human men and women, a half-elven swordsman, and\
  \ a gnome whose crimson hair flared up like the flames he often conjured. Most,\
  \ like Akina, wore mismatched leather and iron armor while carrying assorted blades,\
  \ hammers, shields, and bows. Not the prettiest lot to wander the land, but Akina\
  \ cared more for getting the job done well than in style.</p> \n     <p>She tapped\
  \ the side of her nose. \"Be glad I'm distracted by the killing that's coming. Otherwise\
  \ I might've taken that personally.\" She returned to eyeing the ruins. \"Right.\
  \ Let's figure our approach.\"</p> \n     <p>Durgen scowled. \"You leading this\
  \ band or me?\" </p> \n     <p>\"You make all the contracts and collect all the\
  \ pay. That's a heavy burden to bear. I'm just trying to lighten your load.\" She\
  \ grinned. \"If we work in slow, we can hopefully take down any scouts before they\
  \ raise an alarm. So long as weâ€”\"</p> \n     <p>\"There's one!\" A man jumped forward,\
  \ crossbow raised, and loosed a bolt.</p> \n     <p>Akina cursed as a hobgoblin\
  \ darted through the shadows of teetering columns. The bolt clacked off stone, wide\
  \ afield. Clad in jagged armor, the hobgoblin loped along on muscled legs and ducked\
  \ into a walled courtyard.</p> \n     <p>She growled at the archer. \"Shattered\
  \ stones, Gherb! What've I told you about being so jumpy? Bastard wasn't even in\
  \ range. You want to lose your share?\"</p> \n     <p>Ignoring his muttered apologies,\
  \ she tromped ahead, the band falling in alongside. On the surface, the ruins appeared\
  \ as a jumble of worked stone with toppled pillars, sagging arches, and overgrown\
  \ paths. Gray-green moss slicked many surfaces, while shrubs and a few trees poked\
  \ up through the mess. A number of weathered carvings peeked out from the few walls\
  \ that remained standing; some looked recently defaced, likely when the hobgoblins\
  \ moved in.</p> \n     <p>They reached the spot the hobgoblin had bolted from. Akina\
  \ scanned the area, noting a few crude barricades of spiked branches and piles of\
  \ gnawed bones. A couple of dark thresholds at the far side of the courtyard suggested\
  \ entrances to deeper levels.</p> \n     <p>\"Figure they've dug in,\" she said.\
  \ \"We should scout around, see if there's a back door or two they might scuttle\
  \ out of.\"</p> \n     <p>\"There isn't. I've already checked.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ mercenaries rounded on the source of the voice, but nobody appeared. Several worn\
  \ statues of robed figures sat on nearby pedestals, backs to the group. </p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Magic?\" Durgan nodded to the gnome. \"Piquwit, can you sense anything?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"No magic,\" said the same voice. \"Merely myself.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>One of the statues rose and faced them. Not a statue, Akina realized, but a\
  \ man in a dusty robe that blended with the rest of the rubble. He'd been sitting\
  \ so still, he might as well have been made of stone.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <em>Ondorum is as stubborn as the stone he resembles.</em>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>When he lowered his hood, though, she corrected herself on\
  \ both points. Not a man... and maybe he was made of stone. His gray skin had a\
  \ rough texture, while his hair hung a few shades darker, looking like rows of chiseled\
  \ granite. Odder yet, where most folk had eyebrows, rows of purple crystals glinted\
  \ in the sunlight above malachite-green eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Who're you?\" She\
  \ squinted. \"What are you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"He's one o' those that's got a bit\
  \ of mud in their blood,\" Durgan said. \"Whaddya call them?\" He clicked his tongue.\
  \ \"Oreads. Yeah. A touch of the earthy elements somewhere down the line.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Earthy elements? Akina reconsidered the strange person. He did have\
  \ a solid bearing, and she had to look hard to catch a hint of him breathing under\
  \ the robe. Her mind jumped to assessing potential weaknesses. Did he bleed like\
  \ other fleshy folks? Would the axe edge of her weapon work best if he proved a\
  \ threat, or would it be better to go at it with the hammer side? Would he pound\
  \ down to dust?</p> \n     <p>He smiled and bowed. \"I am Ondorum. Apologies for\
  \ interrupting, but I didn't wish for you to proceed without knowing the full situation.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Uh... thanks?\" She shook away the violent thoughts. \"What situation?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Ondorum pointed at the inner ruins. \"A small hobgoblin warband has\
  \ claimed this place as their hideout.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We know,\" Akina said.\
  \ \"That's why we're here.\"</p> \n     <p>His flinty gaze roved over the band.\
  \ \"Ah. You are sell-swords.\"</p> \n     <p>She bumped one shoulder up, indicating\
  \ the maulaxe propped over it. \"Swords... bows... clubs... axes... We don't like\
  \ to limit ourselves.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'd request restraint in this instance.\"\
  \ Ondorum nodded to where clawed footprints disturbed the earth. \"I was speaking\
  \ with their second-in-command. He calls himself Skurl.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And I\
  \ call him fair game. You talked to that beast?\"</p> \n     <p>Fine lines cracked\
  \ his placid expression. \"They're just trying to survive. They've been amenable\
  \ to civilized discussions so far.\" He looked aside. \"Though I did have to rebuff\
  \ several attacks before they allowed for negotiations.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're\
  \ trying to make peace with hobgoblins? What are you, some kind of priest?\" Aside\
  \ from her brother's service as a cleric back in Taggoret, Akina held little patience\
  \ for priests. They always viewed the world from such skewed perspectives, trying\
  \ to make people conform to their gods' ideals.</p> \n     <p>\"I come from a monastic\
  \ order that follows the enlightened teachings of Irori.\" He pressed open palms\
  \ together. \"While I left my temple under unfortunate circumstances, I continue\
  \ to pursue perfection in all things, traveling in search of new experiences and\
  \ deeper wisdom. This seemed a good opportunity to offer these troubled creatures\
  \ the chance to follow a higher path.\"</p> \n     <p>She ratcheted her initial\
  \ estimation of him from potential threat down to naive fool. \"Don't you know we\
  \ just got out of a war with hobgoblins and their kind? They slaughtered thousands!\"\
  \ She ground her teeth as a long list of the dead squirmed through her mind. \"\
  This lot's been raiding around Falcon's Hollow for months.\"</p> \n     <p>He folded\
  \ arms across his broad chest. \"Of course I'm aware of the battling. But these\
  \ claim they held no part in it. And, as you said, the goblinoid armies have been\
  \ routed. Isn't post-war the perfect time to attempt more peaceful solutions?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She stared. \"You're one of those mad monks, aren't you? Look, go\
  \ back to staring at your bellybutton, if you've got one, and let us do our job,\
  \ hm?\"</p> \n     <p>She moved to lead the band into the ruins, but stopped when\
  \ he planted himself in her way.</p> \n     <p>\"I insist you reconsider.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This time, Akina let the fury simmer in her stomach, an enlivening heat.\
  \ \"Move or I'll make you.\"</p> \n     <p>Durgan coughed. \"I'd back off while\
  \ y' got the chance, monk. She don't give warnings too often.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ slightest grin tweaked Ondorum's lips. \"Consider your warning appreciated but\
  \ unnecessary.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Right.\" Akina hefted her maulaxe and charged.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>At the last second, the oread swiveled on a heel. She bulled by,\
  \ checked her rush, and tried for a backhand swing. He shifted so it swept past\
  \ less than an inch from his robe. A few hoots went up from the mercenaries at the\
  \ near miss.</p> \n     <p>Growling, Akina let the heat at her core churn like boiling\
  \ water. She sped up, not bothering to arrest her swings. He continued to dance\
  \ around her, feet sweeping patterns in the dirt, nimbly dodging, bending and swaying\
  \ just so. With every whiff of her weapon, Akina's hits went a little wilder, the\
  \ flames inside her blazed brighter, singing her bones. </p> \n     <p>She raised\
  \ the maulaxe over her head. \"Hold. Still!\"</p> \n     <p>As she brought it down,\
  \ he went motionless. The maulaxe slammed into the earth right between his feet.\
  \ He stepped on the head, planted a hand atop her helm, and used the brace to flip\
  \ over and behind her.</p> \n     <p>Akina released her maulaxe and spun, fist lashing\
  \ out to drive into his gut. He blocked the strike with an open palm. The force\
  \ of the impact knocked her back a step, as if she'd punched a granite statue. He\
  \ didn't so much as quiver. </p> \n     <p>The recoil stunned her just enough that\
  \ the rising flames inside her snuffed back to embers. Akina shuddered, realizing\
  \ how close she'd been to losing control. She focused on sucking cool air into her\
  \ lungs, forcing her bloodlust back down before it overwhelmed herâ€”as it so often\
  \ did these days. She avoided glancing at her companions, knowing even the slightest\
  \ smirk or snigger would send her barreling back into the fight.</p> \n     <p>Instead,\
  \ she retrieved her maulaxe and leaned on it, casual-like, as if his showing her\
  \ up meant nothing. </p> \n     <p>\"Listen,\" she said through a forced smile,\
  \ \"you ever try making peace with other monsters before?\" </p> \n     <p>Ondorum\
  \ nodded. \"I've done so with a pair of trolls that were assaulting caravans and\
  \ also with a band of orcs attacking a monastery.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yeah? How'd\
  \ that go?\"</p> \n     <p>\"They had to be destroyed in both instances. With the\
  \ trolls, I was able to keep collateral damage to a minimum.\" His posture drooped\
  \ slightly, like a mountainside threatening an avalanche. \"The orcs, however, killed\
  \ many and destroyed much before they were eliminated.\"</p> \n     <p>Akina studied\
  \ the monk closer, sensing more to that confrontation than the monk wished to reveal.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Ondorum seemed to notice her attention and firmed up. \"They were\
  \ dealt with. No longer a threat.\"</p> \n     <p>The mercenaries murmured among\
  \ themselves. </p> \n     <p>Akina cleared her throat. \"If you aren't lying about\
  \ all that, how about getting paid good coin to put that skill to use here? Could\
  \ give you a share in the work.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I live simply,\" he said. \"Never\
  \ needed much coin. The people I've saved have often been willing to donate food\
  \ and shelter until I moved on.\"</p> \n     <p>\"But you care about saving people,\
  \ right? And sounds like every time you've tried to do that with just words, it's\
  \ all gone to hell.\"</p> \n     <p>His lips turned down at the edges. \"I admit\
  \ I've succumbed to discouragement at times. That is one of my numerous flaws. This\
  \ land is a violent one, and many do not respect anything but force. Yet the path\
  \ to perfection is never without its stumbles.\" Ondorum mused in silence for a\
  \ few moments. \"Were you hired to kill the hobgoblins, or simply to ensure they\
  \ don't attack Falcon's Hollow and its lumber camps any longer?\"</p> \n     <p>Akina\
  \ raised an eyebrow Durgan's way. </p> \n     <p>The mercenary captain shrugged.\
  \ \"Technically? The second one. Killing's just always been the easiest way for\
  \ us to see it done.\"</p> \n     <p>Ondorum fixed back on Akina. \"A bargain, then.\
  \ Skurl had just delivered word that their leader would meet me within the ruins\
  \ and discuss terms of a peaceful withdrawal. If you join me, they may recognize\
  \ leaving without further violence is their best choice. You can complete your contract\
  \ without having to shed any blood.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're kidding,\" Akina said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I'm quite serious.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Hang on,\" Durgan said, stepping\
  \ in. \"You want me to just let one of my folks wander in with you? You'll be outnumbered\
  \ and cut off if they come from behind.\"</p> \n     <p>Ondorum glanced at the mercenary\
  \ leader. \"You believe she cannot handle the challenge? Very well. I swear I will\
  \ keep her safe.\"</p> \n     <p>Durgan spluttered as Akina made fists. </p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I can handle myself,\" she said. </p> \n     <p>\"I'd rather send a few\
  \ extra folks down with you two,\" said Durgan, regaining his composure. \"Just\
  \ in case.\"</p> \n     <p>\"If you give a show of force,\" Ondorum said, \"the\
  \ hobgoblins would likely respond in kind. I fear bringing even one extra might\
  \ disrupt the accord I've made.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're going in anyways,\" Akina\
  \ said. \"Whatever we do, you're still planning to just... talk.\"</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ bowed. </p> \n     <p>She pressed a fist to her forehead. \"Unbelievable.\" She\
  \ glowered at nothing in particular for another moment, then huffed. \"Fine. We'll\
  \ try it your way first. I'll watch your back so long as you watch mine.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>The monk bobbed his head as if this had been a foregone conclusion.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Why not?\" Durgan asked acidly. \"What's the worst that can happen?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Akina scowled. \"Never ask that.\" She waved toward the ruins. \"\
  Lead on, oh perfect one.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Perfection remains far outside my grasp,\"\
  \ Ondorum said. \"It's often a lifelong pursuit.\"</p> \n     <p>She sighed. \"\
  Priests and monks. None of you ever have a sense of humor.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Humor,\
  \ eh?\" Durgan snorted. \"Your idea of a joke is yanking the ears off a goblin and\
  \ making him choke to death on 'em.\"</p> \n     <p>She blinked up at him. \"What's\
  \ your point?\"</p> \n     <p>Ondorum bowed, then began striding for the ruined\
  \ courtyard. As he headed off, Akina and Durgan exchanged a knowing look. Wouldn't\
  \ be the first time they'd used the ruse of peace talks. The monk's parley effort\
  \ would let her get to the hobgoblin leader, split his skull, and rout the rest\
  \ straight into the hands of the waiting mercenaries.</p> \n     <p>They'd be swapping\
  \ blood for gold soon enough.</p> \n     <p><strong>Coming Next Week:</strong> A\
