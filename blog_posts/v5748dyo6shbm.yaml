  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Lem cleared his throat, and\
  \ Merisiel guiltily ceased fiddling with her dagger, giving her full attention to\
  \ the halfling standing on the table in front of her.</p> \n     <p>“<em>Now</em>\
  \ can we get started with my plan?” he asked.</p> \n     <p>The two adventurers\
  \ were holed up in a tiny inn in Almas, and thanks to Lem, every inch of their room\
  \ was covered in paper. Books sat in high piles on the room’s only table, alongside\
  \ spent ink bottles, quills, and, of course, sheets and sheets of parchment. But\
  \ it wasn’t the pages of transcriptions and doodles on the table that concerned\
  \ Lem now, so much as the ones displayed upon the wall.</p> \n     <p><em>His plan.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was essentially a collage—sheets and scrolls to match the scraps\
  \ around the room—pinned precariously between the chamber’s two sputtering torches.\
  \ Every inch of paper had notes, names, commentary, and observations scrawled across\
  \ them, and most of these were pinned beside illustrations that Merisiel had to\
  \ assume were related. A few maps and blueprints, charcoal rubbings, and pictures\
  \ torn from books—but most of the images were clearly quick sketches of people,\
  \ in Lem’s familiar style. The only structure to these focal points came from a\
  \ handful of strands of crisscrossing, multicolored yarn, pinned down from picture\
  \ to page and beyond, intersecting here and there like a haphazard spiderweb. It\
  \ looked like the kind of thing a mad servant of Rovagug might call art—but to her,\
  \ it just seemed like a cry for help.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  >Complicated Plan by Brian Valezap</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>“So,” he asked, lifting\
  \ his bushy eyebrows. “What do you think?”</p> \n     <p>Merisiel took a deep breath,\
  \ before finally asking the question she’d had since first boarding a ship for Andoran.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“What is all this about, Lem?”</p> \n     <p>To his credit, the\
  \ halfling only faltered for a moment, a flash of disappointment as he scratched\
  \ at the side of his head and his eyes flitted back and forth between his “plan”\
  \ and the elf he’d roped into helping him with it. He lowered his hands, nodded,\
  \ mumbled something under his breath so low even Merisiel’s keen ears couldn’t hear\
  \ it clearly, and then met her concerned gaze with a solemn one of his own.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“As I said…I believe that there is a ring of Chelish spies at work here\
  \ in Almas, a secret conspiracy of infernal agents subtly working to influence Andoren\
  \ politics…and we are the only people who can stop them.”</p> \n     <p>“No, I mean—\
  what does all <em>this</em> have to do with ambushing a Chelish spy?” the elf asked,\
  \ shaking out a few loose strands of her long silver hair.</p> \n     <p>She glanced\
  \ up at the wall again. She supposed now she could understand a little bit more\
  \ of it; most of the map-scraps involved the border between Andoran and Cheliax,\
  \ and there were a few infernal symbols and sketches of Hellknights. At least Lem’\
  s paranoia made sense—he’d been raised a slave in Cheliax, after all. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>“It all started,” Lem said, and there was a flash of performance in his tone,\
  \ the spark of heraldry that usually only came out in the midst of battle. “When\
  \ an old friend from the Bellflower Network reached out…”</p> \n     <p>The halfling\
  \ indicated one of the doodles pinned to the wall. He began to speak at length about\
  \ his old friend, a former slave, who had noticed certain Andoren merchants seemed\
  \ to be making double their usual shipments…and all of them suspiciously close to\
  \ the Chelish border.</p> \n     <p>“Her intel of course connects to Step Six of\
  \ my plan,“ he poked at a different section of the wall. “Wherein, hopefully, any\
  \ decoy Chelish caravans have already been waylaid by members of a certain halfling\
  \ ‘legitimate business organization.’”</p> \n     <p>Merisiel was still seated,\
  \ but she was trying to appear fully invested, even as her fingers fiddled with\
  \ the dagger hilts protruding over her shoulder from the brace on her back.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Legitimate…” she murmured, then brightened. “There’s a halfling mafia?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“No,” Lem said, frowning. “But just in case, don’t ever mention them\
  \ again.”</p> \n     <p>Without missing a beat, he charged back into his plan, jumping\
  \ from point to point across the papers with no truly discernible pattern. One moment\
  \ he’d be explaining how he’d mapped out town guards’ patrol routes, then he’d leap\
  \ to a note about the weather along the border.</p> \n     <p>Although Merisiel\
  \ had only just arrived in Almas, Lem had been lurking in the city for over a month.\
  \ He’d eavesdropped on merchants and mercenaries, paid off Chelish expatriates,\
  \ and pumped sympathetic Andoren warriors for intel—usually in disguise. The little\
  \ bard had been busy with every manner of espionage at his disposal, and all of\
  \ it had been for the sake of building an excruciatingly elaborate plan that, at\
  \ least as far as Merisiel could tell, really only amounted to “ambush.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>The rogue felt her attention straying. Trying to keep her mind occupied,\
  \ she flipped a knife around deftly, using its deadly point to clean beneath her\
  \ fingernails. She grimaced at some of the filth she found there, and hastily wiped\
  \ the dirtied blade off on the closest scrap of parchment. </p> \n     <p>Lem hadn’\
  t noticed, still jabbering excitedly:</p> \n     <p>“…and thanks to the help of\
  \ that poor hellspawn trader—no friend of the Chelish, unsurprisingly—we know exactly\
  \ which coach our suspected spy will be driving.”</p> \n     <p>Merisiel looked\
  \ up at him. “So then we catch it, and stab them?”</p> \n     <p>“No, no, no,” Lem\
  \ said with a sigh. “We will already be lying in wait, assuming we leave tonight.\
  \ Remember Step Thirty-four?”</p> \n     <p>Merisiel failed to subdue a groan.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“What?” asked Lem, blinking, genuinely perplexed.</p> \n     <p>“It’\
  s just…” Merisiel trailed off awkwardly. She began digging her knife through some\
  \ folded-up parchment, gently scoring the wood beneath.</p> \n     <p>“Where did\
  \ I lose you? Step Fourteen, with the carriage switch? Or Step Twenty-nine, where\
  \ Valeros and Kyra help us rig traps at the abandoned border checkpoint?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Lem was pointing down at the table with a frown, where his friend’s knife\
  \ was digging nervously into the parchment. Merisiel’s cheeks actually reddened\
  \ a little as she saw that she had indeed scratched a line over a few scrabbled\
  \ words, including “western border” and “abandoned checkpoint.” She cleared her\
  \ throat and casually spun the knife before plunging its blade fully into the wood\
  \ of the table, as if to say, “I meant to do that.”</p> \n     <p>“It’s not the,\
  \ uh, overall plan, Lem,” she started, sighing. “Clearly you’ve been busy as a bugbear\
  \ at a baby shower, but it all seems a bit…convoluted?”</p> \n     <p>The halfling\
  \ gaped at her</p> \n     <p>“It just seems like it doesn’t require thirty-four—\
  “</p> \n     <p>“Thirty-<em>seven</em>,” Lem interjected.</p> \n     <p>“—Thirty-seven\
  \ steps! And we’ll follow you on all of ‘em. But doesn’t it all add up to: hide,\
  \ wait, and then jump ‘em?”</p> \n     <p>Merisiel gestured toward the madcap collage\
  \ of yarn, paper, and pictures, the books and debris strewn about the room, and\
  \ finally, at Lem. The halfling was working himself into a lather over concocting\
  \ the perfect scheme, when—at least as far as she was concerned—all they really\
  \ needed was a head start and a little luck.</p> \n     <p>She rose from her seat,\
  \ shaking her head softly, trying to meet his eyes under his mop of blond hair.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“You’ve planned enough,” Merisiel said, her tone steady and confident.\
  \ “We’re ready.”</p> \n     <p>“Meri, this is Cheliax—it’s serious. If I’ve missed\
  \ even one detail, misunderstood or forgotten one scrap of information—“</p> \n\
  \     <p>“You haven’t!” the rogue declared with an assuring smile, clapping her\
  \ hand to his shoulder. “I mean, look at all this! You’ve thought this through from\
  \ every angle.”</p> \n     <p>She deftly snatched blades from her dagger brace,\
  \ and, one by one, with impossible swiftness, she tossed them at the wall—each one\
  \ landing home on an illustration.</p> \n     <p>“We leave now—“</p> \n     <p><em>THUNK.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>“We stay ahead of the spy—“</p> \n     <p><em>THUNK.</em></p> \n   \
  \  <p>“We meet Kyra and Valeros—“</p> \n     <p><em>THUNK.</em></p> \n     <p>“\
  And we stage our ambush before they cross the border.”</p> \n     <p><em>THUNK.\
  \ THUNK. THUNK.</em></p> \n     <p>Lem looked at the circle of daggers embedded\
  \ in the wall, watching as Merisiel strode over to the plan, withdrawing her knives\
  \ one at a time. By the time she’d finished and turned back, he was grinning along\
  \ with her. For the first time since the planning began, the halfling seemed like\
  \ his old, confident self.</p> \n     <p>“I think you’re right,” he said with a\
  \ cocky little grin. “I <em>have</em> thought of everything.”</p> \n     <p>Lem\
  \ reached onto the table and plucked Merisiel’s last dagger from its resting place,\
  \ tossing it back to her. She caught it deftly, and the two of them set about gathering\
  \ their gear, ready to set off without looking back.</p> \n     <p>Unnoticed on\
  \ the table, the scrap of paper Merisiel had been stabbing, no longer pinned, unfurled\
  \ from the many folds and creases it had earned. Around the scratches, stains, and\
  \ bits of under-fingernail dirt, text was clearly visible, a note hastily passed\
  \ on to Lem by a terrified hellspawn trader—</p> \n     <p>“Along the western border,\
  \ you’ll pass a single abandoned checkpoint…”</p> \n     <p>And beneath it, previously\
  \ obscured by the parchment’s folds, the words continued— </p> \n     <p><em>“Avoid\
  \ it at all costs.”</em></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
