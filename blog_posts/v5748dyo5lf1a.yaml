  \ itemprop=\"description\"><p>While working on the forthcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8g\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Module: Wardens of the Reborn Forge</i></a>, we had the chance to\
  \ get involved in a very challenging and rewarding design opportunity while developing\
  \ the distinct flavors found in the steampunk city-state of Alkenstar and the magic-blasted\
  \ Mana Wastes region surrounding it. The former required an industrial, clockwork\
  \ aesthetic completely unlike anything else in the Pathfinder campaign setting,\
  \ while the latter was steeped in the primal magic inherent to the region and the\
  \ proliferation of the strange Mana Wastes mutants. These two elements combine to\
  \ make a thrilling, dangerous setting with an almost alien mien that fits in perfectly\
  \ with the Pathfinder campaign setting.</p></span> \n     <p>Today, in the first\
  \ of a two-part blog previewing this epic module, author and Paizo developer Patrick\
  \ Renie delves into the chaos that is the Mana Wastes with a preview of some of\
  \ the most exciting (and harrowing) elements of the adventure portion of <i>Wardens\
  \ of the Reborn Forge</i>, which takes place primarily in the shattered badlands\
  \ outside of civilized Alkenstar.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     \

  0\"></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Filip Burburan\n     </div> \n     <p>The adventure\
  \ portion of <i>Wardens of the Reborn Forge</i> takes place in the Karggat-Sultur\
  \ Hills, west of Alkenstar and north of Lake Ustradi. It was from these ore-laden\
  \ hills that the dwarves of Dongun Hold and the industrious nomads of early Alkenstar\
  \ drew their fortunes and established a technological empire, and it's into these\
  \ hills that the heroes must travel in order to discover the forces assailing tempestuous\
  \ Alkenstar in this time of crisis. The mining camps of yesteryear are rotted and\
  \ abandoned, their operators and inhabitants having evacuated the emptied hills\
  \ decades ago in search of further bounty.</p> \n     <p>Among my favorite aspects\
  \ of the Mana Wastes are mana storms—raging squalls that produce neither rain nor\
  \ snow, but instead warp and unleash the magical forces that yet linger in the spell-ravaged\
  \ Mana Wastes. If you were a fan of the primal magic events in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfs\"\
  ><i>Inner Sea Magic</i></a>, then I've got good news for you, since this book doubles\
  \ the number of possible events adventurers might run into during their treks across\
  \ either the Spellscar Desert or the Western Ravage. Spellcasters must be wary if\
  \ they are to survive the perils of these lands intact, since a simple <i>magic\
  \ missile</i> spell could easily result in catastrophe. To mitigate this ever-present\
  \ hazard, magic-gifted wanderers who have braved the Mana Wastes have developed\
  \ a number of eldritch tools to reduce the risks of primal magic, and adventurers\
  \ would be wise to stock up on such tokens and wards (which are fully detailed in\
  \ the module) before trekking into the unpredictable, arcana-scarred desert region.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Another important element of the Mana Wastes that features heavily in\
  \ <i>Wardens</i> is the population of mutants that dwell in and constantly ravage\
  \ that region. Abominations both natural and artificially created wander in droves\
  \ among the dead, rocky badlands and rolling hills of the Mana Wastes; monstrous\
  \ giants composed of both flesh and machine, impossible clockwork behemoths robbed\
  \ of master and purpose, entire tribes of mutated individuals cast out from the\
  \ City of Smog, and horrific work beasts tamed only by the foolhardiest scavengers\
  \ are just a few of the unsavory denizens to be found among the Mana Wastes. Truly,\
  \ only the most daring adventurers could hope to survive in a land overridden with\
  \ such vile creatures—all of which appear in this module!</p> \n     <p>To give\
  \ you an idea of the horrors that await in the insane and unforgiving Mana Wastes,\
  \ check out this illustration of the capramace, just one of the monstrosities wandering\
  \ those mad hills and deserts.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  \ next Saturday's blog entry, in which developer Mark Moreland details some of the\
  \ most exciting elements of the Alkenstar gazetteer featured in the appendix of\
  \ <i>Wardens of the Reborn Forge</i>. Political intrigue, inner-city strife, and\
  \ magic-warped geography make the City of Smog a realm few GMs and readers will\
