Prerequisites: You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine or primal tradition 
Access Erutaki ethnicity.
You know the truth behind old stories that tell of sending a fetish of bone and sinew to seek vengeance. These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with ease. Add the summon construct spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks to sense or locate that creature.
