  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 2, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">What do Rambo, MacGyver, James Bond, Doctor\
  \ Frankenstein, and Mad Max have in common? Besides making one hell of an adventuring\
  \ party, they all know how to use SCIENCE! to turn themselves into a veritable army.\
  \ Of course, we could instead save space on that camel and ride with the one hero\
  \ who can do it all: Damiel, the best character ever.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Most characters' destinies are written before they take\
  \ their first step. Fighters are on the frontlines, clerics are on hand to heal\
  \ injuries, and rangers are off in the wings. Damiel scoffs at these common party\
  \ roles. The alchemist takes Destiny into his hands and bottles it.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-DamielFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-DamielFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>In <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, Damiel can do anything you want him to do. Need\
  \ a healer? Easy. Get him Cure spells and Potions of Healing, and he'll make Kyra\
  \ look slack. Need someone to dish out party buffs like candy? He can do that, and\
  \ he'll do it with the best items in the game to boot. Intelligent and quick, Damiel\
  \ can \"go rogue\" and neutralize traps and locks alike. And when it comes to dishing\
  \ out pure damage, it's tough to beat explosives.</p> \n    <p>Equipped with only\
  \ a Noxious Bomb and any other card, n00b Damiel can blast an enemy with 1d10+1d8+2d6+5\
  \ (that's an average of 22 damage!!)... <i>and</i> there's a good chance he'll recharge\
  \ BOTH of those cards and do it again later without so much as a scratch. Yelling\
  \ an earth-shattering \"KABOOM!\" and cackling maniacally are optional, but encouraged.\
  \ Knowledge is power, and power corrupts. Enjoy it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Not only can Damiel take on nearly any role, but he's\
  \ never stuck with just one. Want to watch the world burn? Add more oomph to bombs\
  \ with the Grenadier role. Feeling more sanguine? Patch up a wounded party with\
  \ the expert skills of the Chirurgeon.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \    <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Grenadier.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Grenadier_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Chirurgeon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Like any good cocktail, the best mixes are the result\
  \ of imagination and ingenuity. With a little bit of everything, Damiel can confidently\
  \ wander into the wilderness alone. (That's good news, given the rumors surrounding\
  \ the adventuring parties that haven't returned with him.) A fighter who finds a\
  \ shiny new sword can stab things more efficiently (big whoop), but the alchemist\
  \ who finds a new potion recipe has a whole new power at his beck and call. Weaker\
  \ items that fizzle out after a moment's use become the juice of juggernauts.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Imagine playing the Potion of Heroism on yourself every... single...\
  \ turn. To use his best tricks, Damiel really wants to walk the razor's edge. Play\
  \ your cards right, and he gets stronger when he's gasping his last breath. Never\
  \ challenge an alchemist when death is on the line! MWAH HA HA ha ha! *ahem*</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With the secrets to life and death in his pockets, Damiel can take on\
  \ anything and look good doing it. Ignore the twitchy, bloodshot eyes and gruesome\
  \ stains on his coat. Really, the only thing better than playing Damiel is playing\
  \ two Damiels at once....</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
