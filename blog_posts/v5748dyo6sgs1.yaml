  \ Society</a> scenarios feature the narratives they do. This blog also has some\

  >Starfinder Society Scenario #1-13: On the Trail of History.</a> The major spoilers\
  \ are hidden behind a spoiler tag, but there are some thematic spoilers in the blog’\
  s main text.</p> \n     <p>Good? Read on!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >When I first participated in Pathfinder Society, one of the selling points was\
  \ that the Society was a league of archaeologists—just like me! Granted, the Pathfinders\
  \ are sword-swinging, spell-slinging scallywags who tend not to show much respect\
  \ for their host cultures, all while endeavoring to find the most exciting treasures\
  \ in pursuit of fame and public acclaim. Fortunately, that’s not how real archaeologists\
  \ behave, right?</p> \n     <p>…Right?</p> \n     <p>The answer’s complicated. While\
  \ the fields of modern anthropology and archaeology have come a long way, there\
  \ have been and still remain plenty of valid critiques. Anthropology students learn\
  \ about the rather cavalier excavations of the 18th and 19th centuries (and in some\
  \ cases into the 20th and even 21st centuries) that celebrated impressive finds\
  \ while destroying irreparable context; the prejudiced lenses through which early,\
  \ predominantly white, anthropologists studied unfamiliar cultures; and the ways\
  \ in which biased studies and unrefined processes erased swaths of archaeological\
  \ evidence, downplayed (or misinterpreted) other societies’ accomplishments, and\
  \ shaped foreign perceptions and policies in a way that othered and hurt the people\
  \ studied.</p> \n     <p>Through exposure, we also learn to parse the ways in which\
  \ popular culture like Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider highlight the destructive and\
  \ treasure-hunting elements while largely ignoring the delicate research that forms\
  \ the foundation of archaeology. This “pulp” archaeology is a mixed bag. On one\
  \ hand it builds excitement for travel and archaeology. On the other hand, it glorifies\
  \ the violence, looting, destruction, and egos that have caused so much damage.\
  \ No matter how loudly one shouts “This belongs in a museum,” it won’t repair the\
  \ wreckage a pulp archaeologist leaves in their wake.</p> \n     <p>So that’s a\
  \ lot of baggage tied up in anthropology, and by extension, that baggage is an element\
  \ that the Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society alike inherit. When we tell\
  \ stories about studying Thassilon, sneaking around the remains of Shory cities,\
  \ or recovering a lost relic from Sarkorian ruins, we’re tapping into that same\
  \ pulp archaeology context. And those are moments that invite self-reflection. Is\
  \ my character understanding this culture filtered through the character’s (or my\
  \ own) perspective? How does this unfamiliar culture view my daring swashbuckling\
  \ deeds through their ancestral lands, and will my chronicle of this adventure feature\
  \ my voice or theirs? Should I have cast fireball into that room decorated with\
  \ millennia-old murals? And y’know, sometimes the answers are “But there were zombies”\
  \ and “I’m an adventurer,” and one of the big reasons we play tabletop roleplaying\
  \ games is to be awesome by using our PCs’ class abilities.</p> \n     <p>As the\
  \ lead on the organized play campaigns’ creative content, though, I’ve made it my\
  \ business to weave in some of the big questions and controversies from the past\
  \ centuries of anthropology. Fortunately, from a strictly narrative perspective,\
  \ these questions and controversies make for some excellent stories; there’s little\
  \ denying that pulp archaeology’s exciting. But the PCs’ actions also have consequences,\
  \ and I do hope that the dilemmas we include in scenarios are an opportunity to\
  \ empathize and tackle tough choices while in a safe environment. And at the end\
  \ of the day, even if the in-world Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society aren’\
  t good-aligned organizations, they sure as heck don’t surrender their moral compasses\
  \ when in the field.</p> \n     <p>And that’s the bet that Thurston Hillman and\
  \ I took more than a year ago when we brainstormed <em>Starfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #1-13: On the Trail of History.</em> The adventure involves the PCs traveling\
  \ to a distant planet to solve an important mystery, and the investigation ultimately\
  \ leads to contact with the planet’s native sapient life forms: izalguuns, six-limbed\
  \ beings believed to be quite primitive and simple by the few scientists stationed\
  \ on that world (and also izalguuns are appearing in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-3\"\
  >Starfinder Alien Archive 3</a>). But not only do the izalguuns have their secrets,\
  \ but they also present a choice during the adventure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ style=\"“font-weight:\" bold; margin-left: 10px;“>[Deeper spoilers and consequences\
  \ for “On the Trail of History”]</summary> \n      <p>The izalguuns are one of the\
  \ species that left the Scoured Stars system untold generations ago, fleeing the\
  \ supernatural force that inhabited that system. Although once very sophisticated\
  \ technologically, the izalguuns settled on this new planet, purposefully chose\
  \ to live simpler and more secretive lives, and now use their advanced technology\
  \ in more subtle ways. While the izalguuns are amenable to helping the PCs solve\
  \ the mystery that inspired the adventure in the first place, this people wish to\
  \ live in peace and solitude.</p> \n      <p>That creates quite the conundrum to\
  \ academics like the Starfinders. On one hand, honoring the izalguuns’ wishes costs\
  \ nothing. On the other hand, such an advanced and previously under-appreciated\
  \ alien species represents a bonanza of academic renown for the enterprising ethnographers\
  \ willing to publish their findings about the izalguuns anyway. At the end of the\
  \ adventure, the PCs have to make that choice: respect or glory? If the PCs choose\
  \ to respect the izalguuns’ wishes, that’s great, but choosing to out the izalguuns’\
  \ secret existence to the galaxy earns the PCs a special and lucrative boon on the\
  \ scenario’s Chronicle sheet!</p> \n      <p>So, the message is to…sell out foreign\
  \ cultures for money and academic tenure?</p> \n      <p>No. Choices have consequences,\
  \ and scenarios have reporting notes. Remember those check boxes that the GM fills\
  \ out when reporting played scenarios on paizo.com? We examine that data to help\
  \ shape the campaign’s stories and future scenarios. When Thursty and I devised\
  \ this scenario, we agreed that the izalguuns would make for a good playable PC\
  \ race in Starfinder. I also convinced him that this would be a good opportunity\
  \ to see whether the Starfinder Society would be as upstanding as First Seeker Luwzi\
  \ Elsebo would hope.</p> \n      <p>So, we formed a pact. In 2019 I would check\
  \ the reporting data and write a blog about ethical anthropology and On the Trail\
  \ of History. If the reporting data showed the Starfinders had revealed the izalguuns’\
  \ existence to the Pact Worlds in order to profit off the discovery, scores of academics\
  \ would travel to that planet to study the izalguuns and violate the boundaries\
  \ the izalguuns had established. The izalguuns would know that the Starfinder Society\
  \ had betrayed their trust and forswear dealing with the Society ever again. On\
  \ the other hand, if the Starfinders respected the izalguuns’ wishes, there may\
  \ come a time that their more adventurous kin would want to explore the galaxy and\
  \ join the same organization that showed such integrity before.</p> \n     </details>\n\
  \     <p></p> \n     <p>That’s right: the reporting data would determine whether\
  \ or not izalguuns would ever be a playable race in Starfinder Society.</p> \n \
  \    <p></p>\n     <details> <summary style=\"“font-weight:\" bold; margin-left:\
  \ 10px;“>[The Results]</summary> \n      <p>You made us proud.</p> \n      <p>A\
  \ very clear majority of groups reported respecting the izalguuns’ wishes by keeping\
  \ their culture and technology a secret. More than a year later, the first izalguuns\
  \ have traveled to Absalom Station in the wake of the Society’s victory at the Scoured\
  \ Stars, and these aliens are joining the Starfinders ranks even now.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Beginning on August 28th, the street date for <i>Starfinder Alien Archive\
  \ 3,</i> izalguuns will be an always-available playable race in the Starfinder Society\
  \ campaign! As always, you’ll need a copy of the book in which they appear, as they’\
  ll be appearing in the Additional Resources list.</p> \n      <p>And to answer a\
  \ likely question: yes, this is the type of event we might repeat in the future,\
  \ but probably not for a while longer, and probably even then it would take a slightly\
  \ different form. Does that mean you should be exuberantly ethical in all of your\
  \ choices in Starfinder Society? Certainly my inner anthropologist would love that,\
  \ but I encourage you to play awesome characters of diverse backgrounds and with\
  \ diverse perspectives because that’s part of what makes the game fun.</p> \n  \
  \   </details>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>Over the course of the Starfinder Society\
  \ campaign, the team’s enjoyed including more opportunities to review reporting\
  \ data, incorporate players’ ideas and PCs into the stories, and overall encourage\
  \ a more “living campaign” feel. Seeing this particular story to its conclusion\
  \ has been especially exciting, and we’re equally excited to consider how your choices\
  \ in this adventure might affect future scenarios.</p> \n     <p>If you’re interested\
  \ in exploring more archaeological themes and controversies, I encourage you to\
  \ check out the following adventures. Their spoiler tags include modest spoiler\

  \      <p>One of the tough realities of archaeology—and to an extent anthropology\
  \ as a whole—is that ancient sites don’t always wait around to be found. When a\
  \ large building project or impending environmental shift means that an area might\
  \ never again be accessible, it calls for salvage archaeology: a speedy triage of\
  \ the sites and accelerated excavation to recover and preserve as much information\
  \ about the doomed sites as possible. In the case of the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane,\
  \ the whole place is quickly collapsing, and part of Season 10 is based on the principles\
  \ of salvage archaeology.</p> \n     </details>\n     <p></p> \n     <p></p>\n \

  \ addresses the academic and ethical abuses performed by a Pathfinder in Varisia.\
  \ His destructive exploration, desecration of bodies, and outright misrepresentation\
  \ of the culture that built the site in question haven’t just wrecked an important\
  \ tomb; he’s also threatened future expeditions by offending the local cultures.\
  \ And like in the real world, someone has to repair those bridges and offer reparations.</p>\
