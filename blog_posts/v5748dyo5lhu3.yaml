  >A week ago we flew back to Seattle from another great Gen Con experience. By day\
  \ we managed the Paizo booth, and after the exhibit hall closed, we ascended to\
  \ the Sagamore Ballroom for a special event every night. On Thursday night we presented\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9ctz\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-97: Siege of\
  \ Serpents</em></a>, which debuted at PaizoCon 2015 but easily shattered past attendance\
  \ records in the Sagamore. This was also an opportunity to thank Mike Brock for\
  \ his service to the organized play campaign, <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sq4c\">announce\
  \ 11 new Campaign Service Award recipients</a>, and recognize the many GMs who have\
  \ received their fifth star in the past year.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n    <p>On Friday night we seated even more players, reaching 1,350 participants\
  \ (not even counting our admirable orange-shirt HQ volunteers who relayed tables'\
  \ successes). The Pathfinders at long last activated the Sky Key during <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9cu7\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-00: The Sky Key Solution</em></a>,\
  \ during which they had a unique opportunity to explore a never before seen corner\
  \ of Golarion lore. Partway through, publisher Erik Mona and many of our senior\
  \ editorial staff stopped in on their way from the ENnies to address the room and\
  \ pass out promotional miniatures.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  ></a>\n     <br>During the event, editor-in-chief F. Wesley Schneider snapped this\
  \ panoramic shot of the room.\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>On Saturday morning,\
  \ I approached Thurston Hillman and cajoled him into running a bunch of us through\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu6\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-99: True Dragons\
  \ of Absalom</em></a>, the adventure he wrote to debut at Gen Con. That night, after\
  \ Mike Brock announced <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sq96\">four more Campaign Service\
  \ Award recipients</a>, five Paizo employees, and Tonya Woldridge (one of the lead\
  \ HQ volunteers) got to play kobolds while Thurston fought back by inserting extra\
  \ Easter eggs that never would have survived development. One highlight of the evening\
  \ included the GM running around the table like an airplane, pretending to be a\
  \ much more ferocious flying creature that demanded our obedience. Fortunately for\
  \ Thurston, the only documentation of that moment is too blurry to post. Mike Brock\
  \ also joined a game that involved some of the best 3D terrain we've seen!</p> \n\

  \    </div> \n    <p>There was even a special event on Sunday morning, when players\
  \ got to portray conniving Aspis Consortium agents attacking a key Pathfinder Lodge\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents\
  \ Rise</em></a>. Both this and <em>True Dragons of Absalom</em> are now available\
  \ for the campaign's most devoted GMs (4- and 5-star respectively) to run, and we're\
  \ adding these to those GMs' downloads soon.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <br> <i>Photo courtesy of Erik Mona</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Several\
  \ other changes to the Sagamore Ballroom stood out this year in addition to the\
  \ larger space and the greater number of special events. You may have seen that\
  \ HQ operated several information desks near the ballroom's main entrances, helping\
  \ to direct new players, explain what Pathfinder Society is all about, and distribute\
  \ important handouts like pregenerated characters and Faction Journal Cards. Right\
  \ in front of the elevated HQ platform, <a href=\"http://miniaturebuildingauthority.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Miniature Building Authority</a> generously set up a large 3D\
  \ village, and we ran short demo adventures in which players portrayed goblins raiding\
  \ Sandpoint and performing a variety of zany missions. I think I'll let <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhsm\">Erik Mona's picture</a> show you how beautiful a scene\
  \ this set for goblin carnage. Finally, as in previous years, we also debuted six\
  \ new quests called <a href=\"/products/btpy9fi8\"><em>Phantom Phenomena</em></a>,\
  \ written by three great authors we learned about through the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/getInvolved\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Open Call</a>.</p> \n    <p>Thank you to everyone who made it\
  \ to Indianapolis and helped make the weekend so fun!</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder\
