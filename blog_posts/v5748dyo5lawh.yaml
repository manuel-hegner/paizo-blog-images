  >Wednesday, March 24, 2010</p> \n   <p>Given that here at Planet Stories we recently\
  \ wrapped up production on Hugh Cook's Brobdingnagian-sized 464-page sci-fantasy\
  \ adventure <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy88wa\"><i>The Walrus &amp; the Warwolf</i></a>,\
  \ I figured it's about time to show off the book's awesomely monstrous cover art\
  \ by Keiran Yanner, and also to share with you what the book's presenter, award-winning\
  \ novelist and builder of fantastic worlds China Miéville, has to say about Hugh\
  \ Cook in his introduction. So without further ado, take it away, Mr. Miéville...</p>\

  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Of Hugh Cook's extraordinary, underrated,\
  \ bizarre and hysterical decology, Chronicles of an Age of Darkness, <i>The Walrus\
  \ and the Warwolf</i> has long been a, if not the, reader favourite. Let's be clear:\
  \ the whole series urgently needs rediscovery—each book (all standalone) for its\
  \ own specifics, as well as for the astonishing audacity with which Cook tangles\
  \ them. Not only do they cross over and back and through each other book to book,\
  \ but like a kind of pulp Rashomon-monger, he might repeat the exact same scene\
  \ several books apart, described from two contradictory points of view, so only\
  \ the most faithful readers will get the joke. The hope is that having been hooked\
  \ by the following story of Drake Douay, readers will go on to <i>The Wizards &amp;\
  \ the Warriors</i>, <i>The Women &amp; the Warlords</i>, and the later, more arcanely\
  \ double-W-ing titles (from which paradigm Cook, with the torturous rigour of any\
  \ Oulipian prankster—like Georges Perec, who wrote an entire novel without the letter\
  \ \"e\"—admirably refused to budge. <i>The Werewolf &amp; the Wormlord</i>? Really?).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But while every one is a must-read, it's easy to see why <i>The Walrus\
  \ and the Warwolf</i> is perhaps the favourite. This epic picaresque of Drake's\
  \ adventures is astoundingly full of <i>stuff</i>, precisely the stuff that gets\
  \ our sweet spots. Pirates! Monsters! Wizards! Battles! Pirates! Sex! Pirates! Misunderstood\
  \ robots from an ancient high-tech past! Really excellent monsters! Etc! Also pirates!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>...On the question of monsters, Cook brilliantly has it both ways. On\
  \ the one hand, what we want from our fantasy beasts is familiarity. We want to\
  \ see what an author can do with the traditional figures we know well—the gryphons,\
  \ the unicorns, the... alright, let's use the D-word... the dragons. On the other\
  \ hand, especially in these post-Lovecraft days, we want monsters that are completely\
  \ new, totally alien, without any remembered fabular cognates. These are quite contradictory\
  \ ways of relating to fantastic bodies, and authors generally simply have to choose\
  \ one or the other to indulge. Cook, however, refuses to. Instead, he draws a border—\
  a physical border, at the bottom of his map. To the north of it live dragons and\
  \ their familiar folkloroid compadres; to the south, the Swarm, incomprehensible\
  \ insecto-alien monstrosities, like the Neversh, of terrifying, carefully described\
  \ but almost impossible to visualise alien forms. So by a kind of Promethean arithmetic,\
  \ Cook just <i>adds</i> the new-monstrous to the old...</p> \n   </blockquote> \n\
  \   <p>P.S. Yes, that is indeed Neversh on the cover!</p> \n   <p>Christopher Paul\
