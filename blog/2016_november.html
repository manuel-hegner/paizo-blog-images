<p class="date">Wednesday, November 30, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">The first Munchkin sets were sold at Gen Con 2001. Starting in January 2016 and going right through Gen Con 2017, we're celebrating Munchkin's 15th anniversary! (Yes, for more than 18 months. What's the point of having an anniversary if we can't Munchkin-ize our own party?) As part of the celebration, we've released a series of Guest Artist Editions of many of our Munchkin titles, and we certainly didn't want to leave <a href = "/store/byCompany/s/steveJacksonGames/byProductType/cardBoardGames/munchkin/munchkinPathfinder"><em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em></a> out of the lineup.</p>

<p>I had the enjoyable task of combing through issues of the <a href = "/pathfinder/comics">Pathfinder comic books</a> to find an artist whose style was suitable for <em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em>. After I got to look through a number of issues (translation: I got to read comics for work, because my job is awesome), we decided on Shane White, who has a strong visual style that's perfect for Pathfinder and for Munchkin. Luckily for us, Shane was just as excited by this project as we were and knocked it absolutely out of the park. We were so thrilled with Shane's work that we've contracted him for some more projects, including a new booster pack, <a href = "/products/btpy9o7z"><em>Munchkin Pathfinder: Truly Gobnoxious</em><a>, and the long-delayed <em>Munchkin Pathfinder 2</em>, scheduled for Summer 2017.</p>

<p>There are 168 cards in this game, so picking just a few to show off Shane's fantastic work was nearly impossible. I pared it down to three that I really love.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-BlogGoblin.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-BlogGoblin_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p style = "clear: both;">First, the Blog Goblin, who absolutely embraces his anachronism with a jaunty hat, sunglasses, completely generic coffee, and a laptop whose logo deserves a second look. Watch your fingers! Writing all the Goblins in <em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em> and its expansions was fun and challenging, and even now I find myself coming up with more Goblin ideas than I have space to use them. (So far, anyway... no telling what the future might hold!)</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-GoblinSweat.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-GoblinSweat_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Next up is Goblin Sweat. I admit, I wasn't thinking about a bartender when I saw this Item in the Pathfinder books and included it in the game, but I'm glad Shane did! It puts a new twist on an already fun item. (Pun totally intended.)</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-Firegut.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-Firegut_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Finally, Firegut is one of the many Curses in <em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em> that I took from the various diseases found in Golarion. This one is especially nasty in canon and Shane's art captures it perfectly. Special kudos on this and all the cards in this set to the SJ Games layout and production team; this game looks fantastic because of their hard work.</p>

<p>The <a href = "/products/btpy9kg8"><em>Munchkin Pathfinder Guest Artist Edition</em></a> is now available for order from paizo.com. Love goblins as much as us? Be sure to look out for the upcoming <a href = "/products/btpy9o7z"><em>Truly Gobnoxious</em></a> booster due next month!</p>

<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroFront.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroFront_360.jpeg" /></a><br /><i>Just look at that extremely regal man!</i></div>


<p>Mavaro is the most versatile character ever made for the game&mdash;even more so than Rise of the Runelords Lini, and she was majorly versatile. At any given moment, Mavaro can potentially have any skill in the game, and that skill will be equal to his highest base skill, his Intelligence. This is thanks to the amazing power that allows him to display a boon from his hand and gain all of the skills listed in that boon's check to acquire section equal to his Intelligence, and that effect lasts until the end of the turn. So, right from the start of the game, Mavaro can have a d10 for every base skill as long as he has a Blessing of the Elements to display. He can also use (almost) any weapon in the game with his Intelligence as his base die: reveal it to use your Strength (for Melee weapons) or your Dexterity (for Ranged weapons) skill and then display that same weapon to gain that skill equal to his Intelligence.</p>

<i>Take a look at those skills. They can ALL be yours!</i></div>

<p>This extreme versatility also bleeds over into his deck composition. Mavaro's deck list starts off with no weapons, spells, or armors in it. However, he can treat all three of these card types as if they were items, and he gets <i>nine</i> of those to start. This means that you can tailor his deck to your liking at the end of any scenario. Do you know that the next scenario has a lot of golems in it, which are notoriously immune to spells? Drop all your attack spells and pick up a few extra weapons. Are there a lot of locations coming up that require Wisdom checks to close? Pick up a few items that can give you a good Wisdom skill.</p>

<i>Did you notice that he can still gain 1 card feat each for weapon, spell, and armor? This may come in handy...</i></div>

<p>The only "static" cards in Mavaro's beginning deck are allies and blessings, so it's important to choose them wisely. Every card that you put in Mavaro's deck should have the ability to grant him a skill that he either doesn't have at all, or is not very good at. Diversity is key, since you want him to have a card somewhere in his deck for every situation imaginable. This also means that Mavaro is a huge fan of examining cards in his location deck. Even though the Trigger trait might make this a bit of a gamble sometimes, it's important to know what is coming next so that you can make sure you will have the card in hand to grant you a needed skill.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6030-TombRaider_180.jpeg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6030-TombRaider_180.jpeg" /></a>

<p>I could go on for pages and pages about the best cards to pick for Mavaro as you move up through the adventure decks, but we should probably talk about Mavaro's role card a bit. His roles are Acquisitor and Channeler. The Acquisitor, as you might expect, is really good at acquiring new cards. Without any power feats, Mavaro can discard a card to add a die to his checks to acquire. Using a power feat, he can give that benefit to other characters at his location. And in the Acquisitor role, he can take a power feat to reduce the cost of that power from discarding a card to merely recharging a card. One of the best feats in this role, however, is the ability to set aside items from your hand before you reset your hand, effectively increasing your hand size significantly if you've got several items in hand&mdash;and you could potentially have as many as 8.The Channeler role focuses strongly on casting spells, gaining the Arcane and Divine skills. Additionally, like <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/occultAdventures/classes/occultist.html">his RPG equivalent</a>, Mavaro can channel magic from objects into spells. In the PACG, this takes the form of recharging a weapon, and armor, or an item to summon and play a random spell that has the Attack trait, which is pretty amazing. Each of Mavaro's roles also offers a power feat that lets you affect your Intelligence checks after the roll. The Acquisitor's version lets you bury a card to add or subtract 3, while the Channeler lets you discard an item to reroll the dice! These are both really excellent powers for Mavaro, though it's important to remember that not all of your checks are going to be based on Intelligence... His first power lets him gain skills <i>equal</i> to his Intelligence, but doesn't actually <i>use</i> his Intelligence, which is <a href = "/threads/rzs2ty5g?Mummys-Mask-Mavaro-and-displaying-cards#30">an important distinction</a>.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroAcquisitor_360.jpeg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroAcquisitor_360.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroBack_360.jpeg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroChanneler_360.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>I honestly have trouble choosing between these two roles... They're both amazing!</i></div>

<p>Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about the <a href = "/pfsacg">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> organized play program and how Mavaro can be used there. Though Mavaro doesn't have his own <em>Occultist Class Deck</em>, Mavaro can be unlocked for PFSACG play by completing the final adventure of <a href = "/pfsacg/products/season2">Season of the Runelords</a>. You'll use the <a href = "/products/btpy9gdq"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a> with him, which is a great deck of cards overall but does have some pitfalls when it comes to Mavaro. First, like many Class Decks, the Basic blessings are Blessings of the Gods, and that card is one of relatively few in the game which has no check to acquire. This makes all four of his starting blessings useless for his best power. You will quickly want to replace them with blessings that have at least Divine as an acquire option, which you can then display to make use of several excellent Divine spells in the deck, including Weapon of Awe and Divine Favor. You can also grab a Grave Tender as an early B ally upgrade. This deck is also a bit sparse with items for an Occultist, though Archer's Bracers and Blood Periapt are solid choices from the start, and picking up the Manual of War is almost essential.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6814-WeaponOfAwe_180.jpeg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6814-WeaponOfAwe_180.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6814-GraveTender_180.jpeg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6814-GraveTender_180.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6814-ManualOfWar_180.jpeg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6814-ManualOfWar_180.jpeg" /></a><br />I've heard whispers of other decks unlocking for Mavaro in the future, so stay tuned...</div>

<p>That's it for today, my friends. I hope that you can forgive my falsehood in my first blog, as I wasn't allowed to talk about Mavaro at that point, and Alahazra is an amazing character in all of her versions. But when it comes to the <i>best</i> character ever, I am going to have to definitively say that it is Mavaro... at least until Lone Shark Games come up with an even <i>more</i> amazing character! Until next time!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Off to the Planes!</h1>

<p class="date">Monday, November 28, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">We launched <a href = "/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild's</a> Season of the Stolen Storm with the promise of exploring the elemental planes, yet so far, the season has maintained a conspicuously Material Plane focus. Part of that's a lesson learned from Season 6, whose two dozen scenarios incorporated advanced technology in modest quantities yet developed a nothing-but-tech reputation because many of those scenarios debuted near the beginning of the season. This year we've been ramping up our extraplanar storyline more gradually, including <a href = "/products/btpy9mbd"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a> as a peek behind the scenes of developments on their way and <a href = "/products/btpy9oii"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-05: Ungrounded but Unbroken</em></a> as the Society's first on-screen step onto the elemental planes. At the same time, we've provided an oft-requested return to Galt, a story of redemption in Dtang Ma, an evergreen Tier 3-7 scenario, and more.</p>

<p>But make no mistake: we'll be seeing more of the elemental planes. That begins this week, beginning with two short series: Tyranny of Winds and Forged in Flame!</p>

<p>The first installment of Tyranny of Winds comes to us from Charlie Brooks, who takes us on a whirlwind tour of Osirion's Scorpion Coast in <a href = "/products/btpy9p8v"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-08: Tyranny of Winds, Part 1: The Sandstorm Prophecy</em></a>, a Tier 1-5 adventure. Much to Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir's consternation, his lodge has suffered another theft, this time apparently in association with the Society's recent acquisition of a powerful elemental artifact. The culprit has escaped into the Scorpion Coast, an untamed wilderness that Osirian pharaohs once attempted to settle through the labor of elementals&mdash;no doubt of interest to members of the Scarab Sages. It is now the domain of free-willed elementals that view most humanoids as trespassers, and it's here the PCs must travel if they are to find where the thief fled.</p>

<p>This season it's a goal of ours to present at least two adventures in each of the four elemental planes, and the Plane of Fire has proven one of the greatest challenges because, well, PCs are remarkably combustible in a realm that deals 3d10 fire damage each round. The answer was to look to the great trade cities, which offer some protection from the heat. The City of Brass is the most famous of these (and is on the way), but what really jumped out at us was Zjarra, a cosmopolitan refuge that attracts commerce from across the multiverse. Not only is this appealing to the Exchange faction, but Zjarra is also the home of a dangerous informant who has offered her expertise in solving one of the Society's pressing problems&mdash;for a price. Venture-Captain Esmayl Ibn Qaradi has given the PCs the first crack at negotiating this planar metropolis in <a href = "/products/btpy9p8w"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-09: Forged in Flame, Part 1: The Cindersworn Pact</em></a>, a Tier 5-9 adventure!</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0808E-Eisharon.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0808E-Eisharon_180.jpeg"></a>

<p>In other news, traveling to the elemental planes and exploring elemental themes has warranted commissioning some really great art. Pictured here are an earth elemental, an efreeti information broker, and a Qadiran venture-captain who first appeared in Season 0 and now has his own handsome art&mdash;all illustrated by Giorgio Baroni.</p>

<p class="date">Tuesday, November 22, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p><i>Designer Liz Spain continues her breathless romance-novel previews of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Mummy's Mask</a>, here showing off the bounties in <a href = "/products/btpy9n0y"></i>Adventure Deck 2: Empty Graves<i></a>. The desert awaits.</i></p>

<p itemprop = "description">Far from home as it was, the city of Wati was comforting, familiar somehow to Estra. Though her old ears struggled to understand the exotic tongues the local merchants spoke, the shopkeepers were always excessively polite. This was a city that embraced death, lived next door to death. Respecting the elderly was etched into the bones of Osirion culture.</p>

<p>The young man managing the auction offered Estra a well-muscled arm and led her to a soft cushion to rest. "May I?" he asked, unfurling the small carpet she kept tucked under her arm. His voice was rich and warm as he comforted, "Ask for Ptemenib if you desire for anything else, Honored Grandmother." She didn't need the seat; she felt as spry as a woman half her age.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-EveningAtTheCannyJackalFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-EveningAtTheCannyJackalFront_180.jpeg"></a>

<i>Of course you do.</i></div>

<p>But this vantage point allowed her to watch the stevedores fill the Canny Jackal's storeroom with treasures scavenged this morning from the necropolis. Grave goods crafted in a dozen different dynasties shuffled through the doors, glittering gold and lapis in the light of the oil lamps. Occasionally, pieces of the dead carefully wrapped in blessed linen joined the gaudy trinkets on the storeroom shelves. She spotted what appeared to be a severed hand and gasped. "No worries, Love," the gruff voice at the back of her mind reassured, "he deserved it."</p>

<p>A cleric of Nethys appeared from the shadows. He was looking for someone.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Ptemenib.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Ptemenib_180.jpeg"></a>

<i>Don't hands usually come in pairs?</i></div>

<p>She was about to admonish Honaire with her favorite line from the parable of <i>Pharasma and Forgiveness</i> when the exuberant shouting of the auction broke into screams. A crash-tumble of precious objects clattered to the floor as the mummified remains crawled off the shelves. A falcon-headed canopic jar rolled into the bidding room, cracking against a stone column. The abomination that spilled forth was malevolent and... juicy.</p>

<p>"There!" Honaire spotted movement through the window.  A golden-masked figure dashed into an alleyway, the cleric of Nethys in close pursuit.</p>

<p>Outside, merchants hunched over their wares. It was all they could do to protect them from the panicked customers desperate to escape the vanth stalking above.</p>

<i>Psychopomp is totally a real word.</i></div>

<p>All around Estra, young wills broke and they ran for safety. There was danger, sure. Estra had seen the chaos of death many times before. In the withering gasps of a sick child in her arms, in the bewilderment of restless battlefield shades, as the light faded from the eyes of her own Honaire, death marked the beginning of a new journey. In this hot and sandy place, on this journey through ancient graves, she carried the wisdom of Pharasma. A powerful ill will was causing the dead to rise. She could help, but only one at a time.</p>

<p>The screams pouring in from the street broke as the crowd passed. In its wake, a woman in mourning garb glared daggers at all who passed. With kohl-rimmed eyes streaked by tears, she was quite young to be widowed. Cold, dark energy coalesced about her arms, ready to defend the figure still wearing his funerary shroud shuffling behind her. This poor woman reminded Estra of her younger self. She remembered the black well of loss, her desperate screams into the oblivion that claimed her beloved. Her old heart cracked, then broke. Her love poured forth in a plume of vivid ectoplasm that took shape around her.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-WidowAndDearlyDeparted.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-WidowAndDearlyDeparted_180.jpeg"></a>

<i>The good spells have names like "deathgrip" in this set.</i></div>

<p>"I'll protect you while you talk to the sorceress, Love," Honaire reassured. Though always together in a way, his physical presence blanketed her with a comforting armor. Called to act, she clenched her jaw and wrapped her fingers around the tassels of the carpet as it rose. This night would have hard lessons for the young, lessons Estra knew well: Death is not the enemy, and love is not enough.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Paizo Sponsors UK Games Expo This June!</h1>

<p class="date">Monday, November 21, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurb360" style="width: 500px !important;"><a href = "http://ukgamesexpo.co.uk" target = "_blank"><img src="/image/content/Logos/UKGE_360.jpeg"></a>
<img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Logos/Paizo_120.jpeg"></div>

<p itemprop="description">With the 2016 convention season wrapping up, the team is already knee deep into planning the shows for 2017. If we are planning Pathfinder Society activities, I know our players must soon start planning for travel to Spring 2017 shows. Last week, tickets for PaizoCon (May 26-29) went on sale. Unfortunately, a trip to Seattle is not in the cards for everyone. For those Paizo fans on the other side of the Atlantic (or who fancy a trip to England), fear not. June 2nd to the 4th, we are coming to you by way of the <a href = "https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk" target = "_blank">UK Games Expo</a> in Birmingham, England.</p>

<p>While there has been a Pathfinder Society presence at UK Games Expo for several years, led by Venture-Captain Rob Silk and his enthusiastic venture-officer team, we are turning up the dial for 2017. What's new? This year, Paizo and UK Games Expo entered into a sponsorship agreement alongside other industry leaders such as Mayfair, Hawk Wargames, CatanStudio, GeeknSon, Osprey Games, and Battlefield Hobbies.</p>

<p>But what does this mean for convention attendees? Paizo will have a booth in the Exhibition Hall where we plan to run demonstrations of some of our games. Also, several Paizo staffers are attending and will split time between being in the booth and participating in panels on a variety of game industry topics. Pathfinder Society will be there, bigger and better than ever, running Year of the Stolen Storm Roleplaying Guild scenarios, Season of Plundered Tombs Adventure Card Guild scenarios, and perhaps a few other surprises! It also means a special event scheduled for one night of the convention. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag (yet!), but the pitch John made to the Pathfinder Society team left me excited to see the final product.</p>

<p>So how do you attend UK Games Expo? The <a href = "https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk" target = "_blank">UK Games Expo website</a> contains all the information you need to join us at this fantastic show. The schedule of games and panels is still under construction and won't go live until early 2017, but you can purchase entry tickets as of 1 December 2016. For first-time attendees, the website hosts a fantastic guide with answers to many questions. You can also sign up for the UK Games Expo newsletter, so you don't miss out on any information leading up to the show. There are many ways to get to UK Games Expo. My personal suggestion is to fly into London and take a train out to Birmingham. This gives a chance to enjoy the lovely English countryside before delving into three days of gaming excitement.</p>

<p>Besides the general admission option, you could also consider attending as a volunteer for the Pathfinder Society. There is nothing quite like running games in a convention setting. Some of my favorite memories are from GMing <em>We Be Goblins</em> and <em>We Be Goblins, Too!</em> at Gen Con 2013 and running around the Sagamore Ballroom yelling "Poog Best Goblin," only to hear "Mogmurch Best Goblin" from elsewhere in the room. Venture-Captain Rob and his team need a multitude of GMs running both Pathfinder Society scenarios and demo games throughout the event. The planning team will put out a call closer to the event and I will make sure to repost the request in the PFS blog so everyone can see and come help out!</p>

<p>I am super stoked about the Paizo-UK Games Expo partnership. It is a fantastic show&mdash;one of the premier conventions in Europe. There's gaming of all sorts, as well as shopping and panels. Something for everyone! So I encourage you to look at the calendar, book the time off, and come hang out with the Paizo and Pathfinder crew at UK Games Expo. See you the first weekend of June!</p>

<p itemprop = "description"><a href = "/products/btpy9oo7"><em>Villain Codex</em></a> is here! This week we're unveiling some of the hidden secrets of the last five remaining enigmatic organizations. Each one has its own mysteries and hidden agendas, either hiding in the shadows or in plain sight beneath another facade.</p>

<h2>Secret Society</h2>
<p>What could be more of an embodiment of secretive villain groups than a literal secret society? The group in this chapter maintains the facade of a harmless secret club for the wealthy and influential to engage in wild parties, but underneath is something far more sinister. Let's see if the High Talon, the group's official recruiter, can convince you to join the inner circle:</p>

<p>"Everyone who's anyone is, or was, a member, darling. I'm so glad you accepted our open invitation. We've had our minds on you for quite some time, you see, waiting for you to grow into the handsome young thing you've become. Now, see before you this quivering lowlife. Oh, yes, you once considered him your friend, I know. You must be pained to see him debased this way before you. But such is the natural order of things. He is weak, and you are strong. Do not consider this creature a person any longer. It is a base animal, and it is only right that you treat it as such. Show us exactly what such a simpering beast deserves. That's it! Yes, it's cowering now, so you can take your foot off its throat&mdash;it's already lost and the hunt hasn't even begun. Oh, we're going to have so much fun, my young friend. Take this&mdash;mind how sharp it is&mdash;a claw for you, my beauty, a claw to catch a mouse. See how it runs."</p>

<p>That's right, in secret, the society engages in hunts for the most dangerous game. But with a twist: these ailurophiles use magic to transform their victims into humanoid mice while hunting them in cat masks.</p>

<p>As the ritual commences, you can see the child leader of the organization, the Grand Dam, sitting on her throne. The society has three leaders: the High Sire, High Tom, and Grand Malkin. The High Sire is the Master of the Hunt and keeper of the Great Black Sphynx, the society's sacred beast and focus of many of its internal rites. The High Tom is Master of the Lodge, the public face of the society, and its primary vector of recruitment, propaganda, and internal control. The Grand Malkin is the Master of the Rites and holder of its occult mysteries and arcane methods. Despite having passed on several years ago, the Grand Malkin still jealously clings to power: his phantom is tethered to his granddaughter, known as the Grand Dam. The Grand Malkin's guidance has helped the Grand Dam become a powerful spiritualist early in life, and though he's a shade of his former self, he retains extensive knowledge of the society and guides the Grand Dam in the details of the society's tenets, organization, and sacred rituals.</p>

<h2>Carnival Troupe</h2>
<p>"Step right up and see the world&mdash;yes, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy a show gathered from the disparate corners of the globe! For just a few shiny coins, see bravado and oddities heretofore unknown in your sleepy hamlet, too astonishing to speak of on public corners and within a sheriff's earshot! These canvas walls hide marvels beyond reckoning. Freakish forms cursed by nature! Toothsome young bodies guaranteed to delight! Within you'll find contortions and conjurations, mysteries and mesmerism, and sights to bewitch and delight! All that parts you from this life-changing extravaganza is the exchange of a cursory fee! Pay no attention, my friends, to hurtful rumors of malfeasance here. Our purpose is but to delight by bringing wonders, lessons, and dangers from across the lands to your profitable and trusting little community! Step right up and learn every conceivable meaning of awe!" &mdash;The ringmaster, as her eyes glow so hypnotically, so invitingly, so trustworthily…</p>

<h2>Fang Monastery</h2>
<p>A secret martial arts dojo hidden in the mountains where initiates must undergo rigorous physical and mental training? Sounds like part of a backstory for a PC monk, where the monk met a wise master and trained in secret techniques. But the Fang Monastery is more than just a training ground for martial arts; the First Fang is obsessed with the ancient empire of the serpentfolk and seeks nothing less than a return to a twisted order patterned off the serpentfolk of old.</p>

<h2>Sinister Cult</h2>
<p>What could be crazier than a secret cult so dedicated to the apocalypse that they worship daemons, or perhaps the Great Old Ones? Why, an apocalyptic cult that worships daemons <i>and</i> the Great Old Ones, of course! Of course, the Sinister Mastermind uses his powers of persuasion and raw charisma to delude the lower ranks who just want to belong from realizing this goal (yep, as the master of a cult, he's a cult master mesmerist!), but the upper echelons are full of insane prophets, daemonic agents, and more. Note the comedy mask on the front of the cult assassin's crossbow, the symbol of the cult. Once you have the book, if you look closely you can find one on each picture, and the Sinister Mastermind has the tragedy mask to complete the pair and usher in an incomprehensible tragedy.</p>

<h2>Slayer's Guild</h2>
<p>Speaking of assassins, last but not least is the slayer's guild, a religious order of assassins who believe in one simple truth: any assassination is just as long as it's paid for properly. There are assassins of all stripes, from those who use disguises to those who focus on beatdowns, from a vishkanya deadly courtesan (the second in command) to snipers of all stripes. The fact that several members use bows, like the ninja zen archer pictured below, means that they also have strong representation in the secret bonus groups (see below).</p>

<p>Wait, did I just say secret bonus organizations? I sure did! In the back of the book, there are 22 write-ups of organizations that use members from across several of the chapters, either as an adventuring party of members all around the same level, a themed group, or a different sort of group entirely. Most of these are sort of alternate reality mix-ups of different ways to use the NPCs, like The Furies (and all-female adventuring group named for the erinyes), but some of my favorites are meta-groups that could exist in a world that contains all the groups in the book. For instance, the Legion of Dominion is a cabal of the most powerful villains in the book, banded together to help share information and protect against heroes by the Eminent Spellqueen, and the Chromatic College of the Atonal Arts is a bardic college where almost every faculty member is a secret recruiter, advocate, or spy for a different evil group. My favorite, however, is the Silent Oath, a sort of henchmen anonymous group, which I've included here to close out our final blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An order of minions working across various evil organizations, the Silence provides numerous benefits to its members, from a place to vent and share frustration at their overlords' demands to an avenue for the organizations to coordinate through even when their leaders are too publicly opposed to allow an official alliance. With the threat of retribution from their organizations' commanders, members swear a namesake oath of silence. The founder is a bearer who managed to find and reattune a number of <i>society rings</i> that the Secret Society had forgotten through the years. Other members include a cult librarian, the spellmaster, the stagecrafter, a shadowcaster, a fang monastery ascendant, the Renewer, a royal bureaucrat, and a guild operative.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy <a href = "/products/btpy9oo7"><em>Villain Codex</em></a> as much as we enjoyed working on it!</p>

<i>Illustration by Remko Troost<br />
The envoy is a class dedicated to aiding and manipulating others. They are giving orders and encouragement that help your allies do better, while taunting and demoralizing your opponents. Envoys are naturally charismatic leaders and smooth-talkers, ranging from celebrities and starship captains to con artists and cult leaders. Lando Calrissian, General Leia Organa, Ruby Rhod and Inara Serra would all be envoys. And as you can see, Navasi and Lando would definitely appreciate each other's taste in clothes.</i></div>

<p>Earlier this year we revealed a preview of Absalom Station on the main Starfinder page, and the final illustration is even more fantastic! Akiton and Eox are new planetary locations, seen below, and were also shown off in the article.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Worldscape Workbook&mdash;Inside Issue #2!</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, November 16, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/products/btpy9oza"><img src="/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYN0032-E_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop = "description">The second issue of Dynamite's sword & sorcery superstar crossover series, <a href = "/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape">Pathfinder Worldscape</a> releases TODAY in comic shops, and is now shipping from the paizo.com store! The issue features a foreboding jungle adventure in which Seoni the sorcerer awakens in a deadly dimension that harvests the deadliest warriors of three worlds. Before she can reunite with her friends Valeros, Kyra, and Merisiel, she must first survive the jungle alone. Her adventure sees her face a 10-legged Barsoomian banth, the mysterious forest goddess (and first female super-hero in history) Fantomah, Frank Frazetta's jungle lord Thun'da, and Tars Tarkas, the green Martian best friend of John Carter of Mars.</p>

<p>Like all Pathfinder comics, <a href = "/products/btpy9oza"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #2</em></a> contains a short Pathfinder RPG rules appendix and a pull-out poster map. The poster for the issue continues the jungle scene presented in <a href = "/products/btpy9oco"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, with a focus on an immense tree with ritualistic significance. You can put each of the two maps together to create a double-sized jungle encounter!</p>

<p>The text of <a href = "/products/btpy9oza">issue #2's</a> RPG appendix focuses on green Martians, everyone's favorite four-armed original creations of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Mars novels. I'd originally intended to include stats for Tars Tarkas himself in this issue, but the background of the race and its various abilities ended up hogging up so much space that Tars himself will appear later, most likely in issue #5, where the character again plays a significant role. This issue is more about creating the rules elements that I'll later use to make that character, as well as a couple of weapons that will also come into play next month, when we get to John Carter himself.</p>

<p>I used the race builder rules from the <a href = "/products/btpy8rv2"><em>Advanced Race Guide</em></a> hardcover to build the green Martian rules. As with previous Worldscape adaptations, I let the source material dictate my choices. For example, Large size and four arms are both extremely "expensive" traits in the race builder system (because of their significant impact on play), and those two powers alone make the green Martian a 15-point race, putting them on par with something like the fetchling or suli (by contrast, a halfling is 9 points).</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161116-GreenMartians.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161116-GreenMartians_360.jpeg"></a></div>


<p>But there's more to green Martians than their arms and size. There's also their ability to detect thoughts, their weapon familiarity with longswords and spears, their legendary ferocity, and a few other powers to boot. At the end of the day, green Martians are more like 23-25 points, putting them on par with the likes of svirfneblin (24) or trox (28), but well short of drow nobles (41).</p>

<p>The issue also includes rules for Barsoomian radium pistols and rifles, but I'll discuss that more in future blogs.</p>

<p>I've been very pleased by reaction to the first issue of <a href = "/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape">Pathfinder Worldscape</a>. I can't wait to hear what you think of <a href = "/products/btpy9oza">issue #2</a>, and look forward to hearing about your green Martian Pathfinder heroes and villains for years to come!</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Strategy #3&mdash;Knowing Your Cards</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, November 15, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop = "description"><i>This is the third installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href = "http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target = "_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read the first installment <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3k">here</a>.</i></p>

<p>The cards in your character deck require a variety of different actions to play them. To optimize the flow of your cards, you should take advantage of these different actions to make sure you have just the right cards in your deck.</p>

<h2>Reveal: The Worst of the Best</h2>
<p>Cards that you reveal to play <i>seem</i> like the best thing since sliced goblin. After all, you get their great power, then you put them right back in your hand to use again. The problem is that they tend to be the weakest cards. Yes, a Headband of Alluring Charisma can give Lem a +1 to every Diplomacy, Arcane, and Divine check, including combat... but it's just a +1! Compare that to Lem's ability to continually pick his favorite cards out of the discard pile&mdash;including Cure spells, allowing him to quickly cycle through a lot of cards&mdash;he can do a lot better!</p>

<p>This isn't to say that reveal cards are worthless. You'll often want to reveal weapons instead of discarding them, particularly if you're fighting weak monsters or you need to make a single weapon stretch over a few explorations. There are even some reveal cards that are widely useful. For example, the Ring of Protection is pretty great for staving off a variety of 1-point damage annoyances. Alternatively, some reveals give a +2 or more to an important skill, which becomes more worthwhile.</p>

<p>However, the best reveals are those that <i>also</i> have another power, such as armor that can be revealed to prevent minor damage, but still recharged at the end of the turn. The Magic Shield, the Elven Breastplate, and many similar items are great examples of this.</p>

<p>So <i>think</i> before you hold onto a low-power reveal-only card.</p>

<h2>Recharge: The Great Cycler</h2>
<p>Recharge cards tend to be the next most powerful, and they're a good compromise between reveal powers (which tend to be weak) and discard powers (which cost you a card).</p>

<p>The big question with recharge cards is when to use them. My suggestion is: <i>almost always</i>. If a recharge card could help you on a roll, then go ahead and use it. Maybe it was necessary and maybe not, but there's little cost to using it. The one exception is when you have a card that can be recharged for a power or discarded for an explore. (Many allies fit into this category.) In this case, you should probably still use the card, because you'll eventually get the card back, and can explore then&mdash;but late in the game you might flip this assessment, since you'll be less likely to see the card again.</p>

<p>You might take it a step further and recharge cards whenever it's legal to do so, even if it's totally unnecessary. The goal here is to get non-useful cards out of your hand. So if you hit the last ally in a location deck, it might be worth playing your Crown of Charisma, even if your roll is a guaranteed success. It's also generally useful to recharge cards that affect singular skills; yes, you might need them on the next turn, but absent foreknowledge you're just as likely to need whatever you draw, and it's better to keep cycling to get to your good cards.</p>

<p>The biggest deficit of a recharge card is that it gets placed at the <i>bottom</i> of your deck. If you're recharging something you don't actually want, that's fine, but if you're recharging something that's pretty great, you may want to figure out how to get back to it sooner...</p>

<h2>Shuffle: The Lost Action</h2>
<p>The rulebook describes a variety of card actions, from reveal and display to bury and banish, but it doesn't tell you a lot about one of the most important: shuffling. You'll often shuffle your deck when you receive a major healing, such as a Cure. Some characters also have special shuffle powers, such as Weapon Master Valeros or <i>Skull & Shackles</i> Lem.</p>

<p>As long as you're not purposefully trying to keep bad stuff at the bottom of your deck, shuffling rocks because it allows you to more quickly revisit recharged cards&mdash;cards that were good enough that you already used them! After you've put a couple of great cards at the bottom of your deck, you might want to be cured primarily for the shuffle ability.</p>

<p>So, to make your recycling strategy that much better, think about how shuffling might enter your deck and your play.</p>

<h2>Discard: The Standard Action</h2>
<p>Discarding is the way that most things work in PACG. Some characters are pretty good at avoiding it, but most characters will discard over time. Don't be afraid to do it!</p>

<p>You should definitely discard blessings, and you'll frequently discard allies and weapons. You just need to make sure that you're not discarding too much: you should never reduce your deck below your hand size, because doing so can cause instant death if you take a lot of damage.</p>

<p>However, you should start being a bit more conservative a little earlier than that. If your character becomes unable to discard without courting death, he's going to be crippled for play: you won't be able to use <i>good</I> card abilities and you'll become afraid of facing danger.  So, start going lighter on the discards when your deck is only four or five cards larger than your hand size; then you'll have four or five opportunities to play a discard card when it's <i>really</i> important.</p>

<p>When a character is a heavy discarder, be aware that he'll need regular medical attention. This creates the discard/heal cycle, where a heavy discarder gets healed so that he can discard again. It's every bit as good as the simpler recharge cycle; it just requires an appropriate healing power to get it going. Ideally, a heavy discarder should have his own heal cards, such as Father Zantus, Staff of Minor Healing, or various healing spells. Kyra is a fine example of someone who can always take care of herself: she tosses out blessings like crazy, then can Cure them back. If a character can't support his own discard habit, then make sure you have a healer in the party who keeps regular tabs on him.</p>

<p>When you're playing a character with a discard/heal cycle, you should also think about what's in your discard pile. If you make sure it contains great cards like nice blessings, strong weapons, or exploration allies, then their healing will be that much more powerful. So if you can, avoid discarding the random junk you pick up in the dungeons until just <i>after</i> you heal.</p>

<h2>Display: The Weird Action</h2>
<p>Display is a relatively infrequent action in PACG, primarily used by spells like Strength and Toxic Cloud. When you can use it, it's pretty great, because it tends to extend an effect over the length of a turn or longer. Play display cards when they're immediately needed or when you think someone will explore a lot during their turn.</p>

<p>To better assess the value of display spells, it's important to understand whom they can affect. Strength and Toxic Cloud offer a good contrast: Strength gives +3 to one person for the turn, while Toxic Cloud gives +1d6 to everyone at a location for the turn. Strength is a fine spell to use if someone is fighting alone, but when you're doing the final fight against the villain, and multiple characters can pitch in, Toxic Cloud is much better.</p>

<p>It's also important to know what happens to a card after it's displayed. Typically, it'll use one of the less weird card actions. Strength and Toxic Cloud are (hopefully) recharged, but other display cards might be discarded or even buried. This ultimate fate of a display card can tell you more about how and when to use its action.</p>

<h2>Bury: The Action You Fear Too Much</h2>
<p>Though you should try to work through your deck quickly, that doesn't necessarily extend to burying cards, because that takes them out of your play cycle. With that said, don't be afraid to bury your cards. Some characters, like Father Zantus, exist solely to be buried; sometimes Amiri will earn boons that she's happy to bury because they're no good. Even when an armor has a reveal or recharge effect, the bury is usually still its main purpose, so there should never be a qualm about using that either.</p>

<p>The trick comes when you need to determine whether it's worth burying something good. This most frequently comes up for Amiri, when she wants to juice her Strength, Melee, or Constitution. Then you have to decide: to bury or not to bury.</p>

<p>Sometimes you really don't want to bury cards:</p>

<ul><li><i>Don't</i> bury cards if you think you'd have a good use for them later.</li>
<li><i>Don't</i> bury cards if their absence would make a big dent in a specific category of cards in your deck.</li>
<li><i>Don't</i> bury cards if your total card count is too low; that's a good way to end up dead.</li></ul>

<p>But sometimes you do:</p>

<ul><li><i>Do</i> bury cards that you've acquired and don't really need; it's a great use for them.</li>
<li><i>Do</i> bury cards if you've got plenty of similar cards in your deck.</li>
<li><i>Do</i> bury cards more aggressively late in the game; if you're not likely to get healed again, then a card buried and a card discarded are the exact same thing.</li></ul>

<h2>Banish: The Action You Maybe Fear the Right Amount</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to banishment. Obviously, you want to avoid banishing your good cards if at all possible; in fact, if you will eventually <i>need</i> to banish something to close a location, then you should go out of your way to pick up something worthless.</p>

<p>However, there's one situation when you <i>want</i> to banish: when you have cards that specifically work when they get banished, such as Ameiko Kaijitsu and Mayor Kendra Deverin. Either <i>use them</i> by banishing them or dump them from your deck. But whatever you do, don't just sit on them, letting them take up space in your hand and your deck. Yes, it's tempting to save their one-use power for the perfect moment, but if you don't use them, they're worse than worthless. They're deck cloggers. Get 'em out.</p>

<p><i>Next time:</i> Choosing location decks.</p>

<p>Oh, did I forget to mention that in <a href = "/starfinder">Starfinder</a>, you'll be able to build and customize your own starship? It's true. In addition to a robust starship combat system including different roles for each player (you can see some examples of the special maneuvers called pilot stunts illustrated there in the foreground), there's also a thorough system by which both players and GMs can upgrade their starships with new weapons, power cores, and other advanced systems. We've said since the beginning that we think the best starships are practically characters in their own right&mdash;the Millennium Falcon, the Serenity, etc.&mdash;so we wanted to make sure that players could customize their ships and make them unique, while also allowing GM to craft tons of unique foes.</p>

<p>Did we succeed? You'll have to tell us, but I have great confidence that the Jasons can... ahem... make it so.*</p>

<p itemprop = "description">Last week we took a look at villains of the natural world, with an in-depth look at Nature's Scourge. This week we're headed back to civilization to shine a light on the corruption and excesses that make villains like Nature's Scourge want to just burn the whole thing down.</p>

<h2>Regal Court</h2>
<p>The Regal Court is a hotbed of intrigue and schemes. The king and queen, once young and in love, have grown bitter and distant, yielding a political situation loosely based on the court of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, with the queen locked away in a tower. With the King's supporters, the Queen's supporters, and several other opportunistic factions, the Regal Court provides numerous opportunities for the PCs to become embroiled in a major political conflict with no clear "good guy" to back. As the queen says to her champion:</p>

<p>"A marriage is much like an empire, my friend. I've come to understand this intimately ever since I spoke my own vows. In the beginning, it is full of promise, hope, and bounty. Love is its decree. Children and prosperity are its crop. Power and vitality are its commerce. Life is brimming with adventure and endless possibility, and the borders of the lands seem boundless&mdash;limited only by one's ambition and ability to grasp all within reach. And in those heady days, you think those things will last forever, but they never do. The decrees become rote. Most of the crop has been reaped and consumed; the last of it lies rotting in the ditch. Time takes vitality from us all, especially those who do nothing to defend themselves against the inevitable. The empire crumbles, and all that is left is to try to survive, despite the parasites that have latched on and will not let go."</p>

<p>Today, let's take a look at one of those other opportunistic players in the political game, ostensibly loyal to the King but truly loyal only to himself. I speak, of course, of the vizier, since what intrigue-ridden court is complete without an evil vizier?</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Vizier</h3>
<p>Always lurking in the shadows behind the throne, the vizier started serving the king just before the queen's rebellion. The vizier is a sly and treacherous fellow, and those who side with the queen see him as both the true power of the kingdom and the architect behind the court's strife.</p>

<p>Careful in word and action, the vizier plays the part of the king's most loyal servant and advisor, but his true demeanor is far more self-serving. He is slowly draining the kingdom's coffers through the embezzlement of the treasury, manipulation of the bureaucracy, and accumulation of a patchwork of petty titles of land that he plans to parlay into a large holding that will one day be independent from the kingdom. His manipulation of both the king and the prince has been masterful, and the only person who stands in his way is the queen, who thwarts some of his schemes (even as she assists others) and has much more power in court than anyone knows. The vizier suspects the identity of his rival, though not the extent of her influence, and has been subtly and carefully suggesting that the queen should be executed for the sake of the kingdom. Thus far, the king is still loath to do so, and the vizier has begun to exert pressure on other members of the court, such as the prince and the captain of the guard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Corrupt Guard</h2>
<p>The corrupt guard serve double duty in this book due to the way they're set up as an organization. Priding themselves on efficiency, fairness, and upholding the law, institutionally the corrupt guards are mostly lawful neutral (technically even the Guard Captain is lawful neutral, but only technically; you'll have to check out the book to find out way). The corruption in the guard's leadership is subtle enough that few rank-and-file members know about it, and they even have a paladin on staff. What this means is that not only do you have an organization set up for adventures full of conspiracies and corrupt law enforcement, but you also have stats you can easily use for the regular non-corrupt guard the next time your PCs roll a <i>flaming sphere</i> into a bar or whatever other mischief they get up to.</p>

<h2>Cruel Musketeers</h2>
<p>The Cruel Musketeers are the only direct tie-in between two villain organizations. Remember that queen locked away in a tower? Turns out her personal guard, the Queen's Musketeers, didn't take that too well. They were banished from the kingdom and are hoping for the day she calls for them to march back in and free her. Until then, however, they've been slowly descending into villainy just to survive adrift in foreign lands and keep up recruitment, making them one of the more tragic villain groups in the book. The Lord Marshal ostensibly in charge of the musketeers might be lawful neutral, but the decentralized organization of musketeers into fellowships mean that the cruel and ruthless captains find more recruits. Also, there's a foreign baroness trying to politically subvert the musketeers to add a Milady de Winter style character into the mix.</p>

<h2>Merchant Caravan</h2>
<p>The Merchant Caravan are an unusual group of villains in that very few of them can stand against combat-focused PCs for long in a fair fight. Instead, they focus on deception, shady deals, shifty tricks, and all sorts of scams. Bait-and-switch, shorting, smuggling, snake-oil, and confidence games of all sorts follow in their wake. Take a look at the petty fence: "Hey there, need any potions or scrolls?"</p>

<h2>Thieves' Guild</h2>
<p>What set of civilized villains is complete without a thieves' guild? These rogues are each specialists in particular criminal fields, including spying, safecracking, second-story work, gathering intelligence, fixing gambling, and more. Of course, every thieves' guild needs a wiseguy to crack a few skulls if necessary, but most of the thieves tend to be more combat-focused than the Merchant Caravan but most still prefer a proper heist where there's no need for a messy fight and there's always an escape plan.</p>

Look, these tombs aren't just going to plunder themselves.</i></div>

<p itemprop = "description">The <a href = "/pfsacg/products/season3">Season of Plundered Tombs</a> is upon us! Season 3 of the <a href = "/pfsacg">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> just kicked off last week, so it's a good time to discuss the many <s>horrible</s> <i>fun</i> things we have planned for it!</p>

<p>To integrate the Adventure Card Guild with the Roleplaying Guild as part of the overall Pathfinder Society, the ACG players are now Pathfinder agents, as explained in the introduction the season, authored by John Compton:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Among the region's most influential archaeological operations is the Pathfinder Society, an international league of explorers and adventurers dedicated to discovering and chronicling the world's mysteries. You recently completed your training as a Pathfinder agent in Absalom and set out for Osirion, dreaming of the ancient secrets buried beneath the sands and stone.</i></p>
<p><i>The archaeological wealth of all Osirion will be yours to explore. What you uncover might not just change your fortunes; it could change the world!</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're going to get a chance to interact with many groups and characters familiar to the Pathfinder Society. First among these is the Aspis Consortium, a mercantile organization known for its ability to sniff out amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities without all the burden of scrupulous practices. The <a href = "/products/btpy9mbg"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> includes several cards that have the Aspis trait, so you'll get a chance to take full advantage of these extremely useful (and sometimes costly) allies.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-AspisAgent.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-AspisAgent_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Kafar.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Kafar_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-NeftiTheBard.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-NeftiThebard_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>PFS players might recognize these Aspis agents from <a href = "/products/btpy93m0"></i>Destiny of the Sands</i></a>.</i></div>

<p>Relatively early in the season, you'll interact with the Aspis trader Falsin Deek. Traders have a special role in Adventure Card Guild scenarios:</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-TraderRules.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0301E-TraderRules_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>We like you so much, we wrote the trader rules TWICE.</i></div>

<p>This change is great for the Adventure Card Guild because it lets you start each scenario with a card that's not in your class deck, and helps you bring the flavor of Mummy's Mask to your Class Deck. This is particularly important given the curses, the triggers, and the scads of elemental damage&mdash;all things for which your deck might not be entirely ready.</p>

<p>There are a couple other interesting ways we get to play with mechanics from Mummy's Mask. For example, have you wondered about that Defensive Stance card in the Base Set box? It will be a while yet before you'll use it in the Mummy's Mask Adventure Path, but you'll get to use it early in Adventure 2 of Season of Plundered Tombs. Are you getting used to defending against poison damage in Mummy's Mask? Well, the enemies in Season of Plundered Tombs are a little more chaotic and destructive, so are ready to use all kinds of damage types to trigger nasty scourges.</p>

<p>One of the most contentious tasks for the Pathfinder Society and Adventure Card Game teams in development of this season was in choosing a name. Initially, we assumed it'd be "Season of the Mummy," to match up with the name of the box set. But it turns out the story we wanted to tell, while full of Osirion goodies, wasn't really about mummies in particular. We also want to move away from one-word season names&mdash;we certainly don't want any more season names to be abbreviated "SotR" after Season of the Righteous and Season of the Runelords! (Always helpful, Mike suggested "Season of Thundered Rooms.")</p>

<p>We went back and forth on a number of names, but the decision eventually came down to simple planning for the future. We want to make a lot more seasons, so switching to two-word season names gives us a lot more room for expansion. Also, the extremely wise guys at Lone Shark Games immediately stumbled onto "PluTo" as a useful shortening of <i>Plu</i>ndered <i>To</i>mbs, which lets us be happy with it as an endearing animated pet and once-planet.</p>

<p>Honestly, Liz Spain, Paul Peterson, and Gaby Weidling are a lot more inventive (read: crazy) than I am, so I'm not sure I'll be able to measure up to the zany and bewildering antics of some of their scenarios such as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] from <a href = "/products/btpy9nd1"><em>Adventure Deck 3: Shifting Sands</em></a>, but gosh darn it, I'm going to try! Thankfully, Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge conscripted a crack crew of legendary Paizo writers to help generate crazy ideas and write the tasty story bits, in the form of John Compton, Amanda Hamon Kunz, Mark Seifter, and Linda Zayas-Palmer.</p>

<p>Season of Plundered Tombs contains six adventures with five scenarios each. Adventure titles and expected release dates follow:</p>

<ol><li>Serpents in the Deep</li>
<li>Secrets below the Sands</li>
<li>In Search of a Sage</li>
<li>Tomb of the Godless Host</li>
<li>The Sepulcher Soars Anew</li>
<li>Destruction Descending</li></ol>

<p>As with earlier seasons, scenarios will be released weekly to retailers participating in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild program, as well as to Pathfinder Society Venture-Officers, before becoming available for general sale as compiled adventures.</p>

<p>Here are the planned <b><i>Venture-Officer and retailer early release dates</i></b> for each scenario:</p>

<p itemprop="description">The <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/serpentsSkull">Serpent's Skull</a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9nme">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> Adventure Paths&mdash;both of them based around their respectively infamous sets of fangs, to say nothing of one's use of a famous Shoanti fighting style&mdash;are now sanctioned for the Pathfinder Society Organized Play program.

<p>The more that Linda and I work on these sanctioning projects, the more interesting we can make the experience. You'll find some handy guidelines for running the sanctioned parts of the adventure volumes and retaining more of the story in each of these sanctioning documents. We're also pretty pleased with the boons in both of these, which allow PCs to ally with clashing factions, redeem cruel villains, affect one or more of your other Pathfinder Society characters, and even dissolve one of the underlying assumptions of the campaign in a way that lets the character still enjoy in the organized play experience. Curse of the Crimson Throne is also an excellent reason to acquire a <a href = "/products/btpy97ei"><em>Harrow Deck</em></a>, which features in one or more of the boons on each volume's Chronicle sheet.</p>

<p>Have you already started one of these Adventure Paths in your home group? Awesome! Much like we did with <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lidu">Giantslayer and Iron Gods</a>, we're allowing some retroactive credit. If you are still in the middle of playing one of these Adventure Paths but have not yet concluded it, you can receive retroactive credit for all of that Adventure Path's earlier volumes the next time you earn a Chronicle sheet for that campaign. To answer a question that arose in the <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3i">Hell's Rebels sanctioning blog</a>, yes, this allowance also extends to Hell's Rebels.</p>

<p>There's more sanctioned adventures on the way, though not for a few more weeks. Other adventures like <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker">Kingmaker</a>, <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves">Council of Thieves</a>, <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9op2"><em>Seers of the Drowned City</em></a> are still on our schedule.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Deadly Foes on the Loose!</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, November 4, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">We're just a few short weeks away from the November 23rd official release date for <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, the newest release in our prepainted plastic <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line from our partners at WizKids! As I write this, the Paizo warehouse elves (almost certainly drow) are unpacking minis to be sold as singles, prepping case subscriber orders, and overall getting our act together to release everything on time. Meanwhile, I've been sneaking in and stealing figures left and right. What value is there in absolute power if you don't allow it to absolutely corrupt you, at least a little bit?</p>

<p>I'm VERY pleased with how <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> turned out, and think it's one of our best sets yet. From great facial details to amazing "tampo" stamping of intricate designs (mostly pentagrams), <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> will soon prove to be just as popular outside the Paizo office as it is inside.</p>

<p>Because you never quite know how these sets are going to turn out until you see final production figures, earlier this afternoon I grabbed two handfuls of my favorite figures from <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> and ventured outside to take advantage of some rare November sunshine here in Seattle. This gave me the chance for some "candid" photos of the final production figures that I'd like to share with you today.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo1.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo1_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Here we have the mighty Barzillai Thrune (rare), arch-villain of the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>, leading a horrific ceremony to summon a devil from the depths of Hell. With him, from left to right, are the Fire Diabolist (rare), the Priest of Asmodeus (common), and the Thrune Enforcer (common). In the background we see examples of the set's ultra-rare dungeon dressing pieces, which come 1-2 per case. Here we have two candelabras, the Book of the Damned (which comes off its lectern), and the Hellgate.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo2.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo2_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Great success! All hail mighty Asmodeus as a Bearded Devil (uncommon) emerges from the Hellgate! What a joyous occasion for the forces of evil! But wait, what's that dark shadow in the flames of the gate? Is something else coming? Perhaps more than the diabolists bargained for?</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo3.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo3_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Oh nooooo! It's an almighty Pit Devil (rare)! Even the evil servants of the diabolical House Thrune are on the run after the appearance of this unwelcome guest! Run awaaaaay!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo4.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo4_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Speaking of the Pit Devil, here he is standing next to the <a href = "/products/btpy92k6">Fire Demon</a> from <a href = "/products/btpy909j"><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a>, by way of a size comparison. Demon? Devil? YOU decide!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo5.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo5_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Here's a close look at some of the dungeon dressing in <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>. The Hellgate looks much better to my eyes in hand than on the digital image, since you can make out the writhing bodies of its frame much more easily. And take it from me, they're pretty disturbing. These pieces make for great d&eacute;cor in almost any frightful scene, and I'm eager to add them to my own campaigns.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo6.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo6_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Hobgoblins are a major creature type in <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>. Here are a few of them (from left to right): the Hobgoblin Archer, Hobgoblin Cleric, and Hobgoblin Alchemist, all of them commons.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo7.jpg"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo7_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>We've been adding characters from the villainous nation of Cheliax to our <LINK>Pathfinder Battles</LINK> sets for years, and this set is no exception. Some day soon I'll array all of these figures for a class photo, but here are four from <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>: the Thrune Enforcer, Priest of Asmodeus, Fire Diabolist, and Barzillai Thrune!</p>

<p>And that's it for this week. Next week I'll show off more <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> figures "in the wild." Let me know if there are others from the set you'd like to take a closer look at, and I'll do my best to accommodate.</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>

  <h1>Shy Knives Sample Chapter</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2016-11-03T19:00:00Z">Nov 3, 2016, 12:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description"><i>Shaia "Shy" Ratani used to be a member of the most powerful thieves' guild in Taldor&mdash;right up until she cheated her colleagues by taking the money and running. The frontier city of Yanmass seems like a perfect place to lie low, until a job solving a noble’s murder reveals an invading centaur army ready to burn the place to the ground. Of course, Shy could stop that from happening, but doing so would reveal her presence to the former friends who now want her dead. Add in a holier-than-thou patron with the literal blood of angels in her veins, and Shy quickly remembers why she swore off doing good deeds in the first place...</i></p>

<p itemprop="description"><i>Shaia "Shy" Ratani used to be a member of the most powerful thieves' guild in Taldor&mdash;right up until she cheated her colleagues by taking the money and running. The frontier city of Yanmass seems like a perfect place to lie low, until a job solving a noble’s murder reveals an invading centaur army ready to burn the place to the ground. Of course, Shy could stop that from happening, but doing so would reveal her presence to the former friends who now want her dead. Add in a holier-than-thou patron with the literal blood of angels in her veins, and Shy quickly remembers why she swore off doing good deeds in the first place...</i></p>

<blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 1: Sociality and Shackles</h3>

<p>"Shaia Ratani."</p>
<p>This wasn't how I wanted to be introduced.</p>
<p>"Approach."</p>
<p>My chains rattled as I shuffled slowly across the floor on bare feet. Despite the multitudes of burning candelabras stretching down the hall on either side of me, the tattered rags I wore failed to ward off a chill. Even if I hadn't been walking the length of a hall so grand and drenched in opulence, I would have felt small.</p>
<p>"That's close enough, thief."</p>
<p>I stopped. The shackles around my wrists seemed heavy enough to pull my eyes to the ground. In the reflection of tile so polished you'd pay to eat off it, I could make out someone looking back at me, black hair hanging in greasy strands before a face covered in grime.</p>
<p>My face.</p>
<p>"Shaia Ratani," a deep, elegant voice said. "You are accused of a thousand crimes against the aristocracy of Taldor, the most heinous of which include larceny, fraud, extortion, assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to murder, unsanctioned use of poison, trespassing, public indecency ..."</p>
<p>I was hard pressed to think of any legends that began like this.</p>
<p>"...and consorting with deviant powers."</p>
<p>Hell, I couldn't even think of a good tavern story that began like this.</p>
<p>But it was bards who were concerned with how stories began. In my line of work, you learned early on that it's only the ending that matters.</p>
<p>"You may look up, thief."</p>
<p>Bold, commanding words from a bold, commanding voice. You'd think, upon looking up, that they'd belong to a bold, commanding man.</p>
<p>Those were not the first words you'd think upon seeing Lord Herevard Helsen. They <em>might </em>have been the thirty-second and thirty-third ones, if you were generous.</p>
<p>Tall and thin as a stalk of corn and with ears to match, the aristocrat who stood upon a raised dais at the end of the hall seemed an ill fit for his fancy clothes. Hell, he seemed a poor fit for his own home.</p>
<p>While his hall was bedecked with tapestries and servants standing at attention and portraits of strong men and women with strong, noble features, Herevard, with his weak chin and shrewd eyes, shifted uncomfortably. Like he could sense his ancestors' disapproval emanating from the portraits and was already imagining what they'd say if they could see him now.</p>
<p>I never knew them, but I imagined they probably wouldn't be pleased to see a filthy Katapeshi girl in shackles dirtying up their halls.</p>
<p>"Understand this, Miss Ratani." Lord Helsen spoke down an overlarge nose at me, as though the dais he stood upon wasn't high enough to separate us. "I have had you brought from my private dungeons at the behest of another. A mission of mercy that relies entirely on your ability to be civil. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>That would have sounded significantly more authoritative if his face weren't beaded with sweat. I chose not to call attention to that, though. I merely nodded and received a nod in exchange.</p>
<p>Lord Helsen glanced to his side.</p>
<p>"She was captured not two months ago. My guards found her robbing my study. She's been serving penance in my dungeons ever since, my lady."</p>
<p>"Penance?" another voice chimed in. A lyrical birdsong to his squawk: soft, feminine, gentle.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how I hadn't noticed the woman standing beside him before, but the moment she spoke, I couldn't see anything else in the room.</p>
<p>Had Lord Helsen not addressed her as "lady," I might never have guessed her to be a noble. She certainly wasn't what you'd think of when someone mentioned the word, let alone what I'd think of. Her dress was a simple thing of white and blue linens, easy to move in and functional&mdash;words that make aristocratic tailors cringe. Her brown hair was clean and washed, but not styled with any particular elegance. She didn't look especially rich.</p>
<p>Pretty, though.</p>
<p>Or at least, she might have been. It was hard to tell, what with the massive spectacles resting upon the bridge of her nose.</p>
<p>"Penance, my lady." Lord Helsen nodded to the woman. "As you know, Yanmass's laws are rather ...archaic when it comes to crimes against the gentler class." He chuckled. "Why, I'm told that Lady Stelvan, upon finding a vagrant in her wine cellar, appealed to the courts to have him walled up inside and&mdash;"</p>
<p><em>"Please!"</em> The woman held up a hand. "Er, that is, Lord Helsen, I do not need to be privy to the details."</p>
<p>"Of ...of course, Lady Sidara." Lord Helsen made a hasty, apologetic bow. "Regardless, I couldn't let her walk away freely. Time to reflect upon her misdeeds in the dungeons seemed adequate." He glanced back toward me. "I suspect that she will be ideal for your purposes."</p>
<p>"Purposes?"</p>
<p>I hadn't intended to sound quite so alarmed when I spoke. I hadn't intended to speak at all. </p>
<p>Lord Helsen hadn't intended me to either, judging from the annoyed glare he shot me. "Yes, thief. Purposes." </p>
<p>I bowed my head. </p>
<p>"The Lady Sidara has need of someone with particular ...talents," he continued.</p>
<p>I nodded, head still lowered. Somehow, I figured it was going to be about this.</p>
<p>The three things nobles hate most, in order, are losing money, bad wine, and being reminded they have the same needs as anyone else. No matter how big your house is or who you pay to wipe your ass, eventually everyone needs a treasure stolen, a throat cut, or something set on fire.</p>
<p>They might have used words like "talents," but nobody needed dirty work done more than a noble.</p>
<p>And they didn't come nobler than they did in Taldor.</p>

<p>"She is firmly bound, my lady, and no danger at all." Herevard gestured to me with one white-gloved hand. "You may inspect her at your leisure."</p>
<p>Lady Sidara cast him a nervous look before glancing back at me. I was, at that moment, keenly aware of every inch of grime on my skin, every ounce of weight in my chains, every tear in the raggedy shirt and trousers I wore. Something about this woman, with her drab dress and giant spectacles, made me feel naked. Vulnerable.</p>
<p>Unworthy.</p>
<p>Still, she wasn't the first person to do that to me. Certainly not the worst person, either. I kept my head respectfully low, my body reassuringly still as she approached me.</p>
<p>One dainty hand reached out as if to touch me, but she seemed to think better of it and drew it away. I averted my gaze as she studied me from behind those big round spectacles.</p>
<p>"You're not Taldan," she said. "From the south, maybe?"</p>
<p>Lord Helsen spoke from the dais. "She's Qadiran, my lady." </p>
<p>I stiffened at that. My hands tightened into fists, only relaxing when Lady Sidara spoke again.</p>
<p>"Not Qadiran, Herevard. Her features are a little too fine." She hummed a moment before her face lit up. "Ah! Of course. You're from Katapesh."</p>
<p>Herevard yawned. "Same thing."</p>
<p>Still, I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. Not a lot of people from Taldor appreciated the difference between us southern nations, let alone a noble.</p>
<p>"You poor dear," she said, eyeing the sorry state of my dress and hygiene. "Listen. I know this might seem ...unorthodox. It certainly wasn't my first choice. But I have ...an issue." She glanced around, as though wary of who might be listening. "An issue that Herevard said you might be able to help with."</p>
<p>I cast her a sidelong look but said nothing. As if embarrassed, she turned away and readjusted her spectacles.</p>
<p>"I can't give you the details here," she said. "Nor can I promise it will be easy. But I can promise you'll be adequately rewarded. I'll see you safely exonerated of your crimes and granted a handsome sum besides, in exchange for your assistance." She drew herself up, fixed me with a hard look. "Of this, you have my word, Miss Ratani."</p>
<p>Funny how words, common as they are, seem to mean an awful lot to some people. Nobles and their heritages, wizards and their spells, paladins and their oaths&mdash;words mean a lot to the kind of person who woke up one day and heard a higher calling.</p>
<p>I once heard that calling.</p>
<p>Then I put the pillow over my head and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>People like me, we don't put much stock in words. We know how cheap they are. We know how quickly they spin on glib tongues and how swiftly they scatter on the floor. People like me, we needed firmer stuff.</p>
<p>"I know this must sound odd," Lady Sidara said. "Is there ...is there anything I can get you? To help you make up your mind?"</p>
<p>I took a breath and spoke softly.</p>
<p>"A drink."</p>
<p>Lady Sidara nodded and made a gesture to Herevard. Herevard, in turn, gestured to a nearby servant. The servant ran to a table set up against one of the hall's walls and, in a few moments, came rushing up to me with a goblet upon a tray. I took it, nodded my gratitude, first to him and then to her. I closed my eyes and took a long, slow sip of cold, refreshing liquid.</p>
<p>And immediately spat it out.</p>
<p>"What the hell is <em>this</em>?" I snapped at the servant.</p>
<p>"W-water!" he replied, holding up his tray like a shield.</p>
<p>"Well, did I <em>ask </em>for water, Cecim, or did I ask for a gods-damned <em>drink</em>?"</p>
<p>"S-sorry, Shy!" he cried out, cowering. "Sorry, Mistress!"</p>
<p>"'Shy'? 'Mistress'?"</p>
<p>It wasn't until I looked and saw Lady Sidara, her mouth wide open in puzzlement, that I realized I <em>might </em>have just ruined things.</p>
<p>"What did you call her?" The noblewoman glanced from Cecim to me, and the puzzlement turned to irritation. It was a full-blown scowl when she whirled upon Lord Helsen and saw the thin nobleman quaking upon the dais, the sweat on his face having gone from beads to big as moons.</p>
<p>"What did he call her?" she demanded. "What's going on here, Herevard?"</p>
<p>"Uh, well ...that is ..." Lord Helsen's tongue seemed two sizes too large for him at that moment, and he fumbled over his words. "You see, Lady Sidara, when ...when we make mistakes and ...and things are said ...and we try to make them right, and ..."</p>
<p>"Ah, give it up, Herevard," I said. "Whatever excuse you're choking on, it's obvious she's not going to buy it."</p>
<p>Lady Sidara turned to me, shock wrestling with outrage on her features as she watched me unfasten the shackles around my wrists and drop them to the floor. </p>
<p>I looked up at her, blinking. "What?"</p>
<p>"You ...you're not a prisoner at all!" She pointed a finger at me that would have been accusing had it not been so dainty. "You <em>lied </em>to me!"</p>
<p>"If you'll recall, good lady," I replied, holding up my liberated hands in defense, "I didn't say ten words to you. Any lying came specifically from <em>that </em>man."</p>
<p>Lord Helsen squirmed under my finger, flailing as though he could pull an excuse from thin air. But instead, all he did was thrust a finger right back at me and let out a rather unlordly screech.</p>
<p>"She was <em>blackmailing </em>me!"</p>
<p>"I was not!" I shouted back. "I asked you <em>specifically </em>what the information was worth to you! <em>You're </em>the one that came up with the number!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you turn this on <em>me, </em>you lying Qadiran&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<em>Katapeshi!</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>ENOUGH!</em>"</p>
<p>To look at her, you wouldn't have thought such a little lady could come up with such a bellowing voice. But it seemed Lady Sidara, breathing heavily, holding her hands up in a demand for silence, was a woman of more than a few surprises.</p>
<p>"No more lies." She split her scowl between me and Lord Helsen. "And no more blaming. The truth. Now."</p>
<p>The nobleman and I exchanged glances for moment&mdash;or rather, <em>I </em>exchanged a glance and he gave me a look that suggested he might soil himself. At that, I just rolled my eyes and sighed.</p>
<p>"All right, fine. What I did might, in some countries, be construed as blackmail." I waved absently toward the dais. "I got some information on Herev&mdash;" I caught myself; didn't want to rub salt in the wound. "&mdash;on Lord Helsen and asked him what it was worth to him to keep it quiet."</p>
<p>"And what <em>was </em>it worth?" Lady Sidara asked.</p>
<p>"Two months in a nice bedroom at his manor," I replied. "Waited on hand and foot by Cecim here." I shot a glare at the servant. "Who should damn well <em>know </em>by now what I mean when I say I want a drink!"</p>
<p>Cecim squealed and scurried off, still holding his tray up. I sighed and looked back to Lady Sidara.</p>
<p>"Anyway, when he said you had a job that needed doing, we made up this bit about the private dungeon." I gestured to my clothes and grime. "Though had I known it would turn out like this, I wouldn't have bothered painting so much dirt on myself."</p>
<p>Lady Sidara frowned.</p>
<p>"And what information did you have to make ...<em>" </em>She gestured over me. "<em>This </em>seem intelligent?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&mdash;"</p>

<i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i></div>

<p>"You <em>swore </em>you wouldn't tell!" Lord Helsen piped up, his face a red-hot contortion of embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Herevard, what good do you think <em>not </em>telling her would do?" I looked back to the noblewoman and sighed. "I found out about his mistress. A lovely little halfling woman who visits his chambers every other night." I shot her a wink. "Herry likes his short women."</p>
<p>Lord Helsen's mouth hung open. His eyes looked like they were about to roll out of their sockets. I had no doubt that, if I could have read his thoughts, they'd be mostly my name attached to variations of the word "strangle."</p>
<p>Frankly, I wasn't sure what the big deal was. I always thought they looked cute together.</p>
<p> Lady Sidara, for her part, didn't seem particularly upset, either. She slowly turned a sweet, sad smile on Lord Helsen.</p>
<p>"Oh, Herevard," she said. "We've all known about Numa for years now."</p>
<p>"W-what?" Lord Helsen said. "Everyone? All of Yanmass?"</p>
<p>She nodded gently. He made a soft whimpering sound.</p>
<p>"Even Lady Stelvan?"</p>
<p>"She was the first to know, Herry."</p>
<p>"Well, then." I kicked off my ankle shackles and sent them skidding across the hallway. "I guess we've all learned an important lesson about honesty today." I began wiping the painted-on grime from my skin. "And it seems my time with Herry is at an end. Give me a couple of hours to have a bath and I'm all yours, my lady."</p>
<p>"What?" Lady Sidara looked at me, anger flashing across her features. "You assume I'd still hire you now, after ...after ..."</p>
<p>"Oh, what? You were happy to have me when you thought I was a thief, but now that I'm an extortionist, you're too good for me?" I rolled my eyes. "A touch hypocritical, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"It's not that! It's just ..." She rubbed the back of her neck, helpless. "This ...this is a delicate operation, one that I am intent on seeing carried through. I need people I can trust."</p>
<p>"Liar."</p>
<p>She looked at me like I had just slapped her. "What?"</p>
<p>"If you needed people you could trust, you would have found a knight or a brave warrior or some lovesick noble. What you <em>need </em>is someone who can get the job done, and the fact that you're here tells me that the people you can trust simply can't do that."</p>
<p>She fixed me with a long, methodical stare. And though it made me feel every bit as naked as it had the first time, I held my ground and my smile like a sword and shield.</p>
<p>"And can you get the job done?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Are you still going to pay?"</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"Then I can." I turned to walk away toward the hall's exit. "But, as I said, let me get a bath first. I'm not going to talk business covered in filth."</p>
<p>"Yes, fine, whatever." Lady Sidara stalked behind me. "Glad to be doing business then, Miss ..." She paused. "Is your name even Shaia?"</p>
<p>"Of course it is." I glanced over my shoulder, spared her a wink. "But my friends call me Shy." </p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Wonderful Thing About Triggers</h1>

<p class="date">Wendesday, November 2, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop = "description">The unique mechanics in <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a> include a whole bunch of things you've never seen before. One of my favorites is the Trigger trait, which turns the most basic of activities&mdash;reading cards&mdash;on its head, maybe forever.</p>

<p>The general theme of this Adventure Path (at least early on) is that you're exploring a magically protected tomb that's built for adventurers to ransack, but not without danger. We wanted there to be lots of tricks and traps, the kind of things you want to know about before they go off. Many of our players pick characters with examination powers&mdash;Alahazra, Estra, and Zadim in this set&mdash;to scout out those surprises. Lots of boons get you help along those lines. Even some banes.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-BlessingOfWadjet.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-BlessingOfWadjet_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-CrocodileSkinHelmet.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-CrocodileSkinHelmet_180.jpeg"></a>

<i>Three very different ways to examine cards.</i></div>

<p>With all that examining going on, we don't want examiners to be invulnerable to our surprises. Hence, we needed a way to nail them too. So we came up with powers on cards that go off when you peek at them.  We first seeded a version of this into <a href = "/products/btpy9h3h"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck 4: The Midnight Isles</em></a>, on the card Blasphemy Demon.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-BlasphemyDemon.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-BlasphemyDemon_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Everyone's favorite Wrath card!</i></div>

<p>It worked well there, so Liz, Paul, and Gaby built it out in full in Mummy's Mask. To make sure you don't miss these powers, we've given these cards the Trigger trait, and because we want you to know it's there the second you look at the card, we've put it at the top of the list and highlighted it in red. When you examine such a card, you'll find that the first power begins "When you examine this card," and quite often, the words after that are meant to cause you pain.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of that sort of pain.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-BonecrusherWizard.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-BonecrusherWizard_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-TappedSarcophagus.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-TappedSarcophagus_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-MemoriesOfViolence.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-MemoriesOfViolence_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Fun fact: We didn't make up the word "bonecrusher." It's a real type of hyena!</i></div>

<p>Those are all horrible. I mean, in a good way. Okay, mostly in a horrible way. It's not all bad, though! Plenty of cards have a Trigger that you might like! Or at least might not hate so much.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScrollOfThoth.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-ScrollOfThoth_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Hyaenadon.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Hyaenadon_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-UnwrappedHarmony.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-UnwrappedHarmony_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>I dunno, she still looks pretty wrapped to me.</i></div>

<p>And do you think we'd send you into that blender alone? Nah, we've got some cards that can take the sting off the Trigger trait for you.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-MadDogMarrn.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-MadDogMarrn_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-PahmetClansman.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-PahmetClansman_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-MagicCarpet.jpg"><img src = "/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-MagicCarpet_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>I like to dream...</i></div>

<p>So what's really going on here? Is the goal of the set to stop you from examining cards? No! We give you lots of ways to examine cards before you explore, and we expect you'll want to use them. But we just want to put a little fear of the gods into you before you do so.</p>

<p>All of that examine-and-encounter might also seem frightening, but wait! That's a free exploration. It's not a free exploration you can <i>control</i>, mind you, but any port in a sandstorm, right?</p>

<p>As you can see, it's a balance. As you'll see in later blogs in this series, just about everything in <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a> is a balance. After all, if you're walking around a tomb full of traps and treasures, it's best not to get too overconfident.</p>

<p itemprop="description">After much deliberation, I have come to a decision for our latest <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3d">Design Challenge</a>. In this challenge, Liz Courts challenged you to come up with statistics to represent Eleven from the excellent new series Stranger Things. It wasn't an easy task, and trying to pick the best two entries from among the well thought out submissions was a bit difficult.</p>

<p>The prize for first place goes to <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3d&page=2?Where-the-Winds-of-Limbo-Roar#55">Nargemn</a>. I think telekineticist was a good choice to represent most of what we see Eleven do in the show.</p>

<p><a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3d?Where-the-Winds-of-Limbo-Roar#34">Jon Cary</a> snags second place with his submission, showing that there is more than one way to approximate Eleven's skills.</p>

<p>I'd also like to give a shout out honorable mention to <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3d?Where-the-Winds-of-Limbo-Roar#48">Jeffery Swank</a> for his choices. The eidolon angle to represent the demogorgon was clever.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for entering! Keep your eyes on the blog for future Design Challenges!</p>
