  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n     <h2>OPM Musings</h2>Our\
  \ last blog looked at 2019 and some of the team’s best memories of our year. Between\
  \ then and now, I took a few weeks off over the holidays to visit family and recharge\
  \ my batteries. I arrived back in the office on Monday, ready to tackle our outstanding\
  \ tasks and get things completed.\n     <p></p> \n     <p>While out of the office,\
  \ I remained in contact with our tech team as we worked to resolve the outstanding\
  \ issues with the Achievement Point program. The good news is we have a pile of\
  \ fixes ready for quality assurance testing and we hope to have them rolled out\
  \ over the next few weeks. Some of the pending items include downloadable paper\
  \ copies of Playtest Point/Achievement Point boons, Achievement Point scaling for\
  \ Premium/Premium Plus events, and correct values for Pathfinder Society (second\
  \ edition) Quests. I’m optimistic we have the light at the end of the tunnel on\
  \ this issue.</p> \n     <p>Better news than the Achievement Points is our movement\
  \ on sanctioning. The organized play developers finished their pass on several of\
  \ the books and now we are working on getting them formatted for publication. This\
  \ is another task I hope to have completed by the end of the month.</p> \n     <p>Hard\
  \ to believe, but there is one more piece of news even better than Achievement Points\
  \ and sanctioning updates. I’m pleased to announce the organized play team is growing\
  \ by one – we are adding an operational administrative assistant working directly\
  \ with me to support our programs. The job posting should go up shortly and I encourage\
  \ our community members to appy!</p> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n     <p>Taking\
  \ a few weeks off of convention travel led to not awarding any campaign coins over\
  \ the past month.</p> \n     <h2>Stars</h2> \n     <p>The end of 2019, while thinner\
  \ on conventions, was thick with GMs qualifying for their 5th star. This is a great\
  \ achievement, as to reach the 5th star milestone a GM must run 150 games, of which\
  \ at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run\
  \ a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach\
  \ 5-stars is 650 hours! Thank you to all our GMs who committed time and energy to\
  \ the campaign and a resounding cheer to the GMs on the list below that earned their\
  \ 5th star.</p> \n     <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n      <li>Conor McClure</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Adam Kessler</li> \n      <li>Steven Mombourquette </li> \n      <li>Kyle\
  \ Hallberg</li> \n      <li>Michael Petlicke</li> \n      <li>Jon Haight</li> \n\
  \      <li>Edward Kabara</li> \n      <li>Derek Blakely</li> \n      <li>Mike Welham</li>\
  \ \n     </ul> \n     <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>In taking care of backlog\
  \ items, we got the nova icon updated on the website and are working to get the\
  \ glyph icon added. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as easy as me just putting the image\
  \ somewhere and needed some behind the scenes tech assistance. We anticipate having\
  \ the Glyphs up and running in the next few weeks. For those running Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition) games, thank you and we will get your recognition out\
  \ asap!</p> \n     <p>I’d like to list the first 5-nova GMs in the February Spotlight\
  \ blog! While we wait for the online nova evaluation tool, which is part of a greater\
  \ tools overhaul, we’ve made an online form for logging evaluation games. Venture-Captains,\
  \ please use <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQH9FbQtZ1afA5-IqgDG4v-QD262rk_oqKjv9eSsJZnGIGaw/viewform\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this form</a> to submit evaluations.</p> \n     <h2>Convention\
  \ Listing</h2> \n     <p>Only 10 days into the new year and already have an impressive\
  \ list of conventions! Community event organizers submitted their events for support,\
  \ which is awarded to all conventions that meet minimum criteria (15 blocks of games\
  \ over 3 days and publicized to the public). If you don’t see an event on the list\
  \ below and know they are running Society games, ping the organizer and have them\
  \ submit a request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com\
  \ to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type\
  \ of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you\
  \ are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact\
  \ the local venture-officer for more information! </p> \n     <table width=\"800\"\
