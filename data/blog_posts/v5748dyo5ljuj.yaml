  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Saturday, May 27, 2017</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">There are three important duties for every\
  \ Pathfinder field agent: Explore, Report, and Cooperate. These tenants remain a\
  \ core foundation of the Starfinder Society organization. Today, I want to talk\
  \ a little bit about cooperation, specifically factions and how they fit into the\
  \ Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n     <p>Every good Starfinder knows\
  \ the importance of working together with fellow field agents. Engaging in some\
  \ 'jolly cooperation' is fundamental to a successful mission. Factions in the Starfinder\
  \ Society build upon this concept. Each faction is a distinct organization that\
  \ operates within the Starfinder Society, with each faction pursuing independent\
  \ goals while aiding the Society's overall goals of exploring, reporting, and yes,\
  \ cooperating. You're probably familiar with this model if you've ever had a character\
  \ in the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n     <p>So what makes factions\
  \ in Starfinder Society different? Well, I'm glad you asked!</p> \n     <h2>Fame\
  \ and Reputation</h2> \n     <p>There are two important scores for every Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild character: Fame and Reputation. Fame is a collection\
  \ of points that represent overall good standing within the Starfinder Society and\
  \ can be spent for goods and services (similar to Prestige Points in Pathfinder\
  \ Society). Reputation is a growing score that is never spent and instead represents\
  \ the character's standing with the various factions within the Starfinder Society.\
  \ The higher the Reputation a character has with a faction, the more services (read:\
  \ tasty tasty rewards) become available for that character to spend his Fame points\
  \ on. Building a character's Reputation across factions is an important way for\
  \ the character to call in special favors, such as requisitioning an enhanced starship\
  \ component or getting some publicity to reap greater rewards from a Day Job check.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Huh, wait a second, I said factions, as in plural! That must mean...</p>\

  \ \n      <p><i>Illustration by Pavel Rtishev</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>One\
  \ Character, Multiple Factions</h2> \n     <p>Characters in Starfinder are not tied\
  \ to one specific faction. Instead, characters are encouraged to branch out and\
  \ dabble in assisting different factions. Each time a character assists a faction,\
  \ or champions them as part of ongoing operations, that character earns Reputation.\
  \ This doesn't stop a character from fully dedicating herself to one of the Starfinder\
  \ Society's five starting factions. In fact, focusing on a single faction is still\
  \ a very viable way to progress a character.</p> \n     <p>Branching out over multiple\
  \ factions allows characters to reap the rewards of those factions. A character\
  \ with ties to the Dataphiles—one of our previously announced factions—might earn\
  \ enough Reputation to gain the assistance of a 'digital imp' program that acts\
  \ as an ally able to perform various computer-related tasks. Another character might\
  \ dive into another faction and earn the ability to requisition important starship\
  \ components in preparation for an upcoming starship combat encounter. A character\
  \ who dabbles with both factions could earn both benefits, but miss out on other\
  \ available bonuses at higher tiers of Reputation with each faction.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>For those of you worried about accessing essential rewards; maybe a raise dead\
  \ so you don't die (or stay dead), or something to cure that awful space leprosy\
  \ you contracted... well, we've got you covered! While all factions have individual\
  \ Reputation scores to track, there's also a list of services available to 'All\
  \ Factions', gained at certain thresholds of Reputation. Unlike the thresholds tracked\
  \ for individual factions, the 'All Factions' Reputation threshold is determined\
  \ by totaling your Reputation across all factions with which you have Reputation.\
  \ So a character with 15 Reputation with Dataphiles and 20 Reputation with another\
  \ faction, would be able to spend Fame on anything available on the 'All Factions'\
  \ list with a threshold of 35 Reputation or less.</p> \n     <h2>Championing, Faction\
  \ Boons and Faction Missions</h2> \n     <p>So this brings us to our last point:\
  \ how do I gain Reputation with a faction?</p> \n     <p>As part of character creation,\
  \ every Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild character gets to select a free 'champion\
  \ boon' from a faction of her choice. This boon is a faction boon—we'll be talking\
  \ more about boon slots in a future blog, but for now just know that you can only\
  \ have one faction boon slotted per scenario. The champion boon allows the associated\
  \ character to collect Reputation during the course of a normal scenario. So if\
  \ you gain 2 Fame during the course of the upcoming <em>Starfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #01-02: Fugitive on the Red Planet</em>, then you'll get 2 Reputation with whatever\
  \ faction champion boon you have slotted.</p> \n     <p>Want to get more faction\
  \ champion boons, so you can pick-up Reputation with other factions? You sure can!\
  \ Every faction has the ability to purchase a champion boon between scenarios for\
  \ a low Fame cost.</p> \n     <p>But what about faction missions? Pathfinder Society\
  \ has entire storylines involving its factions. Will Starfinder Society have these\
  \ too? Yes, yes it will! Not only will faction missions contribute to the overall\
  \ storyline of a faction, but these missions will also award additional Reputation\
  \ rewards, beyond the Fame and Reputation of a standard scenario, but ONLY with\
  \ the associated faction. This means that it could be very likely that if your character\
  \ is championing one faction, he might end up with some scattered Reputation among\
  \ other factions as a result of playing scenarios that are faction missions. In\
  \ fact, the first faction mission will be one of our Gen Con releases, <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society #01-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em>, which is a mission related to the...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oh, I can't say the name of the faction? Seriously?</p> \n     <p class=\"\

  \ note: *John gives Thursty the stink-eye*</i></p> \n     <p>Fine! Maybe we can\
  \ save exactly which faction for another blog post.</p> \n     <p>Well, thanks for\
  \ listening (er... reading?) this post. I'm excited to hear all of your thoughts\
  \ on Starfinder Society factions as described here and what sort of role you hope\
  \ to see them take in our shared campaign. Please, post in the comments and let\
