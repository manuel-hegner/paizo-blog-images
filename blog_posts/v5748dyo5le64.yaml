  \ <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar 2013</a>! Every year, Paizo holds an annual\
  \ open-call RPG design competition to give the best and brightest aspiring game\
  \ designers a chance to show the world their talent. This year's winner will receive\
  \ a contract to write a Pathfinder Module to be published by Paizo.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>Previous winning modules include Christine Schneider's <a href=\"/products/btpy86uz\"\
  ><i>Clash of the Kingslayers</i></a>, Neil Spicer's <a href=\"/products/btpy8d52\"\
  ><i>Realm of the Fellnight Queen</i></a>, Matthew Goodall's <a href=\"/products/btpy8ihu\"\
  ><i>Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</i></a>, Sam Zeitlin's <a href=\"/products/btpy8joy\"\
  ><i>The Midnight Mirror</i></a>, and Mike Welham's upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8s2u\"\
  ><i>Doom Comes to Dustpawn</i></a>. We can't wait to find an exciting new designer\
  \ to join their ranks as this year's champion!</p> \n    <p>Even if you don't win\
  \ the grand prize, RPG Superstar offers a number of different routes to getting\
  \ your name on a Paizo product. Runners-up will have their work critiqued by industry\
  \ leaders, and the three final-round runners-up will earn a contract to write a\
  \ Pathfinder Society Scenario, a downloadable adventure sanctioned for play in Paizo's\
  \ worldwide Pathfinder Society mega-campaign. Staff and audience favorite entries\
  \ from RPG Superstar's earlier rounds may show up in Paizo publications as well.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Getting noticed in RPG Superstar might be the start of a long-term professional\
  \ relationship with Paizo as one of our regular freelancers. Developer Rob McCreary\
  \ got his start with Paizo as a finalist in the first RPG Superstar. Even though\
  \ he didn't win the final challenge, his creativity and talent earned him a staff\
  \ position as one of the creative leads behind our flagship Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path line.</p> \n    <p>This year's competition begins today with an open call\
  \ to design an original wondrous item. For the first time in RPG Superstar history,\
  \ initial entries will be judged by Pathfinder fans worldwide. Tell us about your\
  \ magical treasure in 300 words or less by December 18, 2012, and you might just\
  \ have started your RPG design career! The top 32 will be picked by our guest judges\
  \ and staff, as well as last year's RPG Superstar finalists, Steve Miller, Mike\
  \ Welham, Tom Phillips, and James Olchak.</p> \n    <p>Even if you're not interested\
  \ in competing, you can participate by voting. Stay tuned for an update on how to\
  \ help us choose our first-round finalists. See <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\"><b>paizo.com/rpgsuperstar</b></a>\
  \ for more details, a complete RPG Superstar calendar, and rules and instructions\
  \ for submitting Round 1 entries. </p> \n    <p>So loosen up your creative muscles\
  \ and start crafting a wondrous item, and get ready to be the next RPG Superstar!</p>\
