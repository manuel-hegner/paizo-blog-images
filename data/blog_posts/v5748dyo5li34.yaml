  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Our Top\
  \ 8 contestants have tackled the difficult task of designing encounters set in one\
  \ of three pre-selected Flip-Mats, and now the results are available for you to\
  \ see! This is their first opportunity to put everything they've learned and practiced\
  \ over previous rounds into a playable part of the game, and represents an achievement\
  \ so significant that these contestants are now considered full alumni of <a href=\"\
  /rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> (and thus not eligible to enter the contest in\
  \ future seasons).</p> \n     <p>Round 4 is the last challenge contestants must\
  \ face to reach the final round. We encourage voters and fans to not just read through\
  \ these encounters, but consider actually playtesting them to see how they play\
  \ in actual game situations. To allow time for this, voting on Round 4 won't close\
  \ until Sunday, October 18. However, the contestants shouldn't be resting too much\
  \ during this period, as they must consider what adventure they'll propose should\
  \ they make it to Round 5 (and soon, they will receive the information needed to\
  \ create a short elevator pitch to run by Creative Director James Jacobs, for pre-approval\
  \ of their adventure ideas).</p> \n     <p>So check out the Top 8 encounters, see\
  \ if you can get a group together to play through them, and think about which designer\
  \ you want to give an opportunity to pitch an adventure to become an official part\
  \ of Golarion canon!</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 30px;\
