  \ The Treasures of the Faithful</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">The defile descended into shadow as the sun burned itself\
  \ out along the broad horizon. We left the camels behind, secured within a circle\
  \ of boulders. The hermit-priest of Sarenrae, Shaba Alemas, led our company by several\
  \ paces, her coarse robe furrowing trails in the black and yellow dust. Two of the\
  \ satrap's soldiers followed, casting nervous at the sky in fear of the great roc's\
  \ return. Captain Najh came next, striding with a wary grace like a desert cat on\
  \ the hunt. I—palace astrologer, sorcerer, and accused thief—shuffled along ignominiously\
  \ at the rear. Najh watched me closely, lest I develop a sudden proclivity to flee\
  \ the vicinity of Azzah's ancient tower and seek the safety of the night.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Keep up, halfling,\" Najh hissed, \"or we'll tie you up with the camels.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Never fear, Captain, I'm right behind you.\"</p> \n    <p>In truth,\
  \ I wanted Najh where I could see him. Unbeknownst to the captain, I had glimpsed\
  \ the sign of the infamous Pierced Rose gang tattooed on his back. Pierced Rose\
  \ brutes held sway in certain quarters of Katheer and certain disreputable caravanserai.\
  \ Though renowned enforcers and thugs, they rarely operated in secret—which was\
  \ extremely fortunate for us. In allowing me to see his tattoo, Najh had proved\
  \ himself either careless or foolishly overconfident. Or both.</p> \n    <p>Without\
  \ question, his main target was Shaba, the young pacifist priest whose splinter\
  \ sect opposed the satrap's warmongering against Taldor. At the same time, however,\
  \ I had no illusions that he would suffer any witnesses to live—I had stolen from\
  \ the satrap's library, after all. No, the real question was why the satrap would\
  \ employ a criminal rather than simply order our execution, or send us off into\
  \ the desert on a fool's errand when a simple knife in the dark would do the work\
  \ just as well. Then the answer came to me.</p> \n    <p>Martyrs.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ were no other souls in the Ketz Desert to report that Shaba—or Kazzar the Astrologer,\
  \ for that matter—had died in any other way than in service to the satrap and the\
  \ Dawnflower. Shaba's people couldn't make her a rallying cry against the satrap\
  \ and his militant allies in the church. It was clean. Simple.</p> \n    <p>It was\
  \ also finished, as of that moment. I refused to die an unknown martyr to someone\
  \ else's cause. It was not a destiny befitting one who was born under the watchful\
  \ stars.</p> \n    <p>The narrow way of the defile twisted toward the tower, and\
  \ Azzah's resting place finally loomed directly above us. The shallow walls of the\
  \ track no longer shielded us from the roc's view, so I hoped Shaba was right when\
  \ she'd deemed it blind. The vast bird still perched atop the tower, motionless\
  \ against the dark iron sky. A slim rectangular opening, framed by eroding sandstone\
  \ plinths, beckoned us forward into the eastern vestibule. The entrance had once\
  \ been deeply inscribed with symbols sacred to the Sun Goddess and painted in vibrant\
  \ shades of cobalt and yellow, but the desert had scoured all meaning from their\
  \ surface. Shaba froze mere paces from the door.</p> \n    <p>\"We stand in a sacred\
  \ place,\" she whispered, lifting a hand to halt our progress.</p> \n    <p>Najh\
  \ raised his head slowly and jerked his chin at the sky.</p> \n    <p>\"The beast\
  \ may be blind, but is it wise to tarry here, praying until it hears us?\" he whispered\
  \ back.</p> \n    <p>Shaba narrowed her eyes but said nothing in response. The skin\
  \ of my neck again prickled, as if with the feet of sand-spiders. Boulders creaked\
  \ as they cooled. Wind ruffled feathers as black as death high above our heads.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Might we please just go inside?\" I asked, unable to keep the panic\
  \ from my voice.</p> \n    <p>Without another word, Shaba vanished into the darkness\
  \ of the tower. The soldiers, with a final glance skyward, followed close on her\
  \ heels. Najh spun and grabbed the loose fabric of my tunic, hauling me under the\
  \ arch of the door.</p> \n    <p>\"You have a part yet to play, Kazzar,\" he hissed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I can assure you I have every intention of seeing this enterprise through,\
  \ Captain.\"</p> \n    <p>Najh smoothed the front of my tunic and gave a thin, reptilian\
  \ smile, his brassy hair glinting with the first starlight of the evening.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"In that case, there may yet be a way to earn the Satrap's forgiveness\
  \ for your crimes.\"</p> \n    <p>I choked down a retort about which of us might\
  \ be burdened with the longer list of illicit deeds. Instead, I lied.</p> \n   \
  \ <p> \"As my Uncle Ilnario is fond of saying, 'No camel has two drivers.' I remain\
  \ your man, but you must say what you expect from me.\"</p> \n    <p>Najh peered\
  \ into the tower, then back at me.</p> \n    <p>\"His Eminence is as interested\
  \ in bringing Azzah's final words to Katheer as our rustic friend here. Should some\
  \ sad fate befall her in that tower, Azzah's secrets must return with us.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I nodded agreeably for Najh's sake, though his meaning was as bright\
  \ as the edge of a sword. Najh was indeed there to ensure Shaba's tragic fate.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We gathered in the gloom of the eastern vestibule of Azzah's Tower, where\
  \ arches of sandstone swept upward to mosaics of colored glass and glinting gold,\
  \ their panes no doubt warded by magic to have survived so many centuries unscathed.\
  \ Scenes from Azzah's life intermingled with what I supposed were texts sacred to\
  \ the Dawnflower, their scripture covering the walls. Several panels depicted historical\
  \ eclipses, but I recognized the significance of little else. Azzah had appointed\
  \ his tower as a vizier's, with aggrandizements of self woven into every arc and\
  \ flute of its construction. I decided I liked the old fellow after all.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Shaba traced the outlines of one panel, disappointment muddying the usual\
  \ fire of zealotry in her eyes. She wiped away layers of dull dust to reveal a colorful\
  \ mosaic of Azzah receiving tribute from the generals of a surrendering army.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"All to the glory of Sarenrae,\" I chuckled, my words a bit harsher\
  \ than I'd intended.</p> \n    <p>She ignored my jibe. \"It's warm.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I ran my hand along the bottom edge of the scene and the patterned border of\
  \ gold and black stones. The black chips radiated heat, almost enough to burn with\
  \ prolonged contact on unprotected skin.</p> \n    <p>\"Heatstone!\" I exclaimed.\
  \ \"Your Azzah was a wealthy man, to use them for decoration like this. Lucky caravans\
  \ sometimes have a few in the supply train for cold desert nights. I'd heard that\
  \ they can sometimes be found in the Ketz Desert, but I had always thought they\
  \ were mostly found in the garderobes of high nobility.\"</p> \n    <p>Her mouth\
  \ quirked in another semblance of a smile, and her eyes shone with excitement. Sadly,\
  \ it was not at my wit.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Shaba.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Shaba_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>Shaba is pure in her faith, yet it takes more than\
  \ belief to turn a blade.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>\"Then it's here,\" she whispered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Before I had a chance to ask what she meant, one of the soldiers lit\
  \ a torch. The golden light chased away the gloom, reflected back in countless tiny\
  \ mirrors and gilt sun disks. Najh studied a door opposite the entrance, one that\
  \ led deeper into the tower. It was limned in gold and cobalt glass. He stepped\
  \ around a chunk of fallen masonry and reached for the door.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm\
  \ going to secure the next chamber,\" he said.</p> \n    <p>\"Do you think it's\
  \ a good idea to go by yourself?\" I replied. I didn't want him out of my sight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Najh favored me with an unctuous smile.</p> \n    <p>\"We must know how\
  \ much of the interior of the tower stands, lest the roc observe us trooping into\
  \ his aerie. As the expedition's scout, I've a duty to go.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Touch\
  \ nothing, Captain,\" Shaba warned. \"This place is sanctified. It's also Azzah's\
  \ grave.\"</p> \n    <p>Najh returned her admonition with insincere piety.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I wouldn't dare, Shaba. What do you take me for, a thief?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>My fingertips ached with the fire I longed to call down upon Najh for that\
  \ remark.</p> \n    <p>He vanished through the sun door, but his two goons remained,\
  \ carrying torches and pretending to study the mosaics. Shaba approached an idol\
  \ of Sarenrae and knelt before it. I wasn't sure how long Najh would be gone, so\
  \ I followed Shaba and risked interrupting her prayer.</p> \n    <p>\"They mean\
  \ to kill you,\" I whispered.</p> \n    <p>\"Fate has decreed that I walk with killers,\"\
  \ she replied.</p> \n    <p>\"We should walk away from them.\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ shrugged. \"You mean well, my friend. But I don't think it's my destiny to die\
  \ here. The Dawnflower has granted me her favor.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But the satrap\
  \ has not,\" I said, finding myself more than a bit pleased at being called her\
  \ friend. \"And he has allies amongst your fellowship that eagerly seek war.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But we serve the same goddess. Despite appearances, the church of the\
  \ Dawnflower in Katheer remains open to a more peaceful way.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps.\
  \ But what of the satrap and his ministers who plot war against the north? They\
  \ rile your fellow priests to righteous anger and lead them down the path of violence—\
  the same path that you preach against. What do those ministers think of the meddling\
  \ hermit out of the desert, I wonder?\" I jabbed a finger at her ragged tunic.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I do not know what sins you are expiating out here, Kazzar, but do\
  \ not shroud this holy mission in your paranoia.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Think about it,\
  \ Shaba. If you vanish in the desert, there will be one fewer voice of opposition\
  \ to the satrap's plans. The Dawnflower's dervishes may well go to war even if the\
  \ nation cannot, manipulated by the schemes of devious nobles.\"</p> \n    <p>Najh's\
  \ soldiers grew suspicious of our whispering and began examining a panel nearer\
  \ to us. I changed the subject.</p> \n    <p>\"Tell me more about your 'holy mission,'\
  \ Shaba,\" I said loudly.</p> \n    <p>For all her apparent dislike of subterfuge,\
  \ she replied without missing a beat. \"Azzah the Prophet lived eight hundred years\
  \ ago and fostered a strictly nonviolent sect that worshipped Sarenrae.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Yet you still carry a sword,\" I observed. Shaba ignored my jibe. She\
  \ was growing adept at that.</p> \n    <p>\"When he was aged and near death, his\
  \ most trusted followers vanished into the desert, leaving behind only a handful\
  \ of scrolls with his core teachings. But he left a promise that before he died\
  \ his truest message yet would be delivered to those who followed the Dawnflower.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And the final homily never came?\"</p> \n    <p>Shaba shook her\
  \ head.</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed. Though word did come that he'd constructed a tower\
  \ somewhere in the depths of the Ketz Desert and offered his body to the beasts\
  \ of the air.\"</p> \n    <p>I shuddered. Sky burial was an ancient practice, and\
  \ not much in fashion with the civilized folk of Qadira these days. A roc nesting\
  \ at the top of the tower suddenly seemed too convenient a coincidence. Such portents\
  \ were not to be taken lightly.</p> \n    <p>\"It seems the beasts of the air never\
  \ left,\" I said. Shaba raised a knuckle to her lips, thinking over my words.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Perhaps the roc serves as the guardian of Azzah's spirit,\" she said,\
  \ dismay plain in her voice.</p> \n    <p>Najh returned from the next room with\
  \ a wolfish smile.</p> \n    <p>\"The interior is intact. There's a stair through\
  \ the ceiling into another chamber.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And what did you see there?\"\
  \ I asked.</p> \n    <p>\"The treasures of a faithful man,\" he replied, his eyes\
  \ shining.</p> \n    <p>Najh motioned for us to follow. Shaba rose, absently tracing\
  \ the pommel of her sword with one finger. I wondered if the priest would trust\
  \ in her fate or in her sword when the time came to choose.</p> \n    <p>It was\
  \ cold in the innermost chamber of Azzah's Tower, insulated as it was from the desert's\
  \ glare by thick walls. Four vestibules ringed that central core: north, west, south,\
  \ and finally east, the chamber where we had entered. The western portal was filled\
  \ with debris and sand, but the others stood open, and I longed to explore them\
  \ as Najh clearly had. Despite the glint of gold from objects in those shadowed\
  \ chambers, the tower walls here were less ostentatious in their proclamations of\
  \ Azzah's glory, with little adornment save repeating icon of Sarenrae and the holy\
  \ rays of her sun.</p> \n    <p>Shaba made immediately for the stair that wound\
  \ its way up the core and into an upper chamber. Najh halted her.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Wait,\" he said, gesturing to one of his soldiers.</p> \n    <p>The man held his\
  \ torch as high as he could, peering into the gloom above. Then, unsheathing his\
  \ sword, he mounted the first step. The stones shifted under the tread of his boots,\
  \ showering dust and flakes of rock. One stone fell loose, thumping to the floor\
  \ with a dreadful echo. I froze, awaiting a sudden death of falling stones, feathers,\
  \ and talons, but if the roc heard, it made no response.</p> \n    <p>\"We must\
  \ mind our step.\" Shaba said, following the soldier over the missing stone.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A simple spell could have carried me up into the darkness as if on the\
  \ desert winds, but Najh gave a slight bow and waved me onto the fragile stair.\
  \ My misgivings intensified when he and the other soldier also drew their swords.\
  \ The hole where the step had rested gaped like a missing tooth in a mouthful of\
  \ fangs—and we were marching right into the gullet.</p> \n    <p>We climbed the\
  \ stairs with utmost caution, my legs quickly developing painful cramps from the\
  \ slow, careful steps. The soldiers kept their swords drawn, and my spine writhed\
  \ like a serpent as I anticipated the kiss of a blade. I kept a spell close to quickening\
  \ in my mind, in case a sudden escape should become necessary. If Najh meant to\
  \ kill me, he appeared not to be in a hurry, and so we gained the upper chamber\
  \ without incident.</p> \n    <p>It was a large spherical hall sectioned into eighths\
  \ by gilt buttresses like the ribs of an orange. The stair continued around its\
  \ circumference, eventually winding through a portal in the roof, framed with more\
  \ sunbursts that led further up into the tower.</p> \n    <p>Around us, the treasures\
  \ of Azzah's life were piled in haphazard fashion: chests of worm-eaten silks, tarnished\
  \ plate of silver and brass, patinaed copper trade ingots from bygone caravans,\
  \ and small caskets of glinting coin and glittering jewels. There was no doubt significant\
  \ value to Azzah's storehouse, but with one camel now in the belly of the roc, I\
  \ feared we would not be able to carry it all away.</p> \n    <p>As with the rooms\
  \ below, frescoes of Sarenrae's legends intermingled with scenes from Azzah's life.\
  \ Here was a brightly painted scene of his miraculous birth under an eclipse; there\
  \ as a young man, already with a prophet's braided beard, turning away an invading\
  \ army and welcoming their commanders as his followers. A large painting spread\
  \ across the top quarter of the room; Azzah's exile from Katheer, his former students\
  \ taking up the sword, and the final moments of his sky burial where huge black\
  \ vultures carried gobbets of his flesh into the heavens. I shuddered involuntarily\
  \ at the last one.</p> \n    <p>Shaba fell to her knees, her eyes shimmering like\
  \ muddy oases.</p> \n    <p>\"The Eye! It is here!\"</p> \n    <p>I followed her\
  \ pointing finger to a detail on a mosaic. It depicted a large globe of black stone\
  \ atop a pedestal near the vultures feasting on Azzah's corpse. Indecipherable writing\
  \ wrapped its surface and gold panels of light radiated like sunbeams. Magical lines\
  \ of force perhaps, but I recalled the tiny heatstones in the mosaics below.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"If it's still here, Shaba, then I fear it warms the nest of the roc\
  \ upstairs.\" A thrill of pleasure welled up from my toes to the crown of my head\
  \ to see the sudden look of dismay on Najh's face.</p> \n    <p>\"That is the artifact\
  \ you and the satrap seek?\" Najh asked, his eyes narrowed.</p> \n    <p>Shaba nodded,\
  \ her face grave.</p> \n    <p>\"The Eye of Azzah contains his final words of peace,\
  \ his last revelation of reconciliation. What did you expect, Captain?\" Immersed\
  \ in the study of a casket of gemstones, I still registered Shaba's contempt.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Traipsing into the roc's nest is beyond foolish,\" Najh said, his voice\
  \ flat.</p> \n    <p>\"Shaba and I can go alone if you'd like,\" I offered. \"It\
  \ shouldn't take us but a minute to steal the Eye and roll it back down the stairs.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Najh flashed his canine teeth.</p> \n    <p>\"Your intention is noble,\
  \ but perhaps it would be wiser if we stuck together, Kazzar.\"</p> \n    <p>Shaba\
  \ couldn't contain her fervor any longer. She raced to the stair and gained a quarter\
  \ turn before Najh's soldiers caught on. I darted ahead of them as well, a sudden\
  \ elation burning within me. The stairs of the sun chamber were more fragile than\
  \ those below, and so I kept my charm of rescue ready in case I should trip and\
  \ fall.</p> \n    <p>Destiny is not always a burden. It can lighten the heart and\
  \ fire the soul. I had known that I would see and do great things all my life, as\
  \ a result of the stars that rose above my head the night of my birth. As I raced\
  \ up the stairs, I saw Shaba returning with the Eye to Katheer and being welcomed\
  \ as a hero, gaining a following to rival even Azzah's. I saw the satrap helpless\
  \ before her persuasions, and Najh and his men executed as thieves of Sarenrae's\
  \ temple. Most of all I saw myself elevated to vizier, vital to all commerce between\
  \ the Sarenites and the Qadiran government. And after that, who knew how much further\
  \ I might rise?</p> \n    <p>But the mirage of glory vanished when I reached the\
  \ top of the crumbling stair.</p> \n    <p>The uppermost chamber of Azzah's Tower\
  \ had collapsed, penetrated by a sky blacker than a pit. Atop one crumbling battlement,\
  \ the roc slept, its vast hunched shape blotting out most of the cold, glinting\
  \ stars. Wind-scoured stones ringed its nest, where a half-dozen eggs the size of\
  \ sheep lay. Marbled in green and gold, they lay basking in the warmth of a globe\
  \ of solid black rock.</p> \n    <p>The Eye of Azzah.</p> \n    <p>Just one of those\
  \ eggs would fetch a generous sum in Katheer, but the Eye was beyond price. I strained\
  \ to make out the tiny inscriptions in gold and silver across its face, ancient\
  \ Kelish words which swam before my eyes. Shaba stood silent, quivering before it.\
  \ Her face was lit with holy rapture, a sheen of reflected starlight that bespoke\
  \ a destiny greater than perhaps even my own. I owe little to the gods that move\
  \ above and below this world, but I saw a working of their will in Shaba's suddenly\
  \ humble frame.</p> \n    <p>Then from within the eggs came the dull scraping of\
  \ chicks nearing their hatching time. The foreboding racket so transfixed my attention\
  \ that I almost missed Najh's quiet, nasty chuckle and the sleek rasp of a dagger\
  \ being drawn.</p> \n    <p>\"Now is the moment, Haron esh Kazzar,\" he whispered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Whatever Shaba Alma's destiny, it seemed that fate had other plans for\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>And for me. </p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Heroes caught\
