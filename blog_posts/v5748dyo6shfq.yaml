  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Eline Reisora\
  \ knew an opportunity when she saw one. That’s how she’d gotten out of a grimy orphanage\
  \ on Absalom Station and adopted by a rich family; it was why she’d busted her ass\
  \ to graduate at the top of her class, and it was why she’d rejected a cushy position\
  \ at her father’s bank for an EJ Corp middle-management gig. But after all her hard\
  \ work and careful planning, here she was on Sovall’s Folly, a good-for-next-to-nothing\
  \ jungle planet in the Vast. Officially her assignment was supervising medical research\
  \ into the weird flora and fauna that made up this world’s biosphere; EJ Corp hoped\
  \ to find a promising cure or medicinal that would rationalize the high cost of\
  \ investing in this planet in the first place. Unofficially, she babysat scientists\
  \ and occasionally accompanied a patrol, just to stretch her legs. And that’s how\
  \ she’d gotten into her current situation.</p> \n     <p>A dart as long as her forearm\
  \ hissed out of the jungle, burying itself in the tree Eline was hiding behind.\
  \ One of her escorts was already a corpse flat on the ground, a similar dart rising\
  \ from his neck like a flagpole. Another member of her security team had fled when\
  \ the ambush occurred. The last of Eline’s employees fired wildly into the brush,\
  \ filling the leaves and the darkness with laser bursts. Eline gripped her arc pistol\
  \ with both hands but didn’t waste a shot. She waited for an opportunity.</p> \n\
  \     <p>There. As her man paused to reload, Eline saw a glimpse of orange through\
  \ the trees. It was one of the locals, the indigenous population of Sovall’s Folly.\
  \ They called themselves blicanders, but EJ Corp personnel just called them bleeks.\
  \ As the bleek rose up from a crouch to spit a three-foot needle, Eline spun around\
  \ the tree and took the shot. Both projectiles hit their mark: lightning struck\
  \ the bleek in the center of its body and it collapsed, limbs convulsing, and Eline’\
  s employee staggered backward, the long dart having pierced both his armor and his\
  \ heart. But Eline was alive, and that’s what mattered.</p> \n     <p>Slowly she\
  \ stepped towards the bleek corpse. It was huge, with a long proboscis, a quiver\
  \ of darts slung over its hulking body, and a simple amulet around its neck. Its\
  \ skin was decorated with symbols drawn in a golden dye. They didn’t usually travel\
  \ alone. This one must have heard Eline and her soldiers coming and seized the chance\
  \ to spring a trap. She wanted a memento, a trophy. Crouching down, she lifted the\
  \ amulet from around the bleek’s neck and slid it off the creature’s long, flexible\
  \ head. </p> \n     <p>Noise. More of them. Drawn by weapons fire, probably. Quickly,\
  \ she dropped the amulet over her head and started to run. Bleeks moved fast, they\
  \ had good hearing, and they knew the jungle. She didn’t like her chances. Sure\
  \ enough, she soon heard them in the brush behind her. <em>Faster, girl, faster</em>.\
  \ But as she opened up her stride to sprint, her right foot caught a root and she\
  \ fell, tumbling into a ravine. Pain lanced through her leg as she tried to catch\
  \ herself, but it was a long slide. Out of the darkness she saw the ravine floor,\
  \ a bright gray stone. She was going to hit. This was it. Time to die on a good-for-next-to-nothing\
  \ jungle world in the Vast.</p> \n     <p>But she didn’t. She didn’t die. She didn’\
  t even hit the stone. One instant she was falling toward the ravine floor, then\
  \ there was a freezing cold blackness, and an instant later she plunged into cool\
  \ water. Her panic changed from fear of having her skull crushed to fear of drowning,\
  \ but with a kick she found air. Everything was dark. Where was she? What had happened?\
  \ Why wasn’t she dead?</p> \n     <p>There was a metallic taste on her lips. Blood?\
  \ No, it was in the water. Her personal comm was still at her waist; finding it,\
  \ she turned on the light and looked around.</p> \n     <p>She floated in a subterranean\
  \ lake. Above her was a silvery dome—the floor of the ravine. Somehow she had slipped\
  \ through it, fallen twelve feet, and landed in the lake.</p> \n     <p>“That,”\
  \ she muttered to herself, “makes no sense at all.”</p> \n     <p>Eline glided to\
  \ the edge of the lake and found her footing. In the light from her comm she could\
  \ see the same gray stone everywhere. But there were also markings: pictographs\
  \ and the images of animals native to this planet, drawn with the same golden dye\
  \ Eline had seen on the dead bleek.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ by Wero Gallo.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p><em>This must be a religious site for\
  \ them</em>, she realized. Sensing opportunity, she took a closer look. As she knelt\
  \ down before a large stone, the amulet around her neck clinked against it and she\
  \ realized it wasn’t stone at all. That silvery appearance wasn’t just moisture\
  \ and a trick of the light. It was <em>metal</em>. The amulet, too. Eline had a\
  \ chemalyzer; the scientists were always asking her to take samples when she left\
  \ the compound, in case she found something that might be useful. For an instant\
  \ she was afraid it might have been damaged in the fall but no, there it was, on\
  \ her belt. Still working. It took only a moment for the device to return its verdict.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Inubrix. Ghost iron. A starmetal used in everything from miniaturization\
  \ to null-space chambers. And the entire cavern was made of the stuff. From the\
  \ top of the dome to the bottom of the lake.</p> \n     <p>She checked the amulet.\
  \ Yes, that was inubrix too.</p> \n     <p>That must have been how she got in. <em>The\
  \ bleeks must use the amulets to pass through the walls of the cavern</em>, she\
  \ thought. And who knew how far the vein went? It could stretch for miles. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Eline sensed opportunity.</p> \n     <p>EJ Corp had bought the rights\
  \ to exploit Sovall’s Folly for a pittance. They’d dumped a ton of credits into\
  \ biomedical research, hoping for a lucky find. But inubrix wasn’t a gamble. The\
  \ company knew how to mine it, refine it, market and sell it. At scale. And if she\
  \ did it right, she’d get a percentage.</p> \n     <p>As Eline stood, scanning her\
  \ light around the inside of the cavern, she looked again at the markings blicanders\
  \ had left behind. In golden paint they had drawn their villages, their families,\
  \ their way of life. Children gathered in a circle around singing elders. Hunters\
  \ clad in sacred garb herded animals or stalked huge carnivores. They explored,\
  \ they traded, they made art; they lived their lives, the same as anyone in the\
  \ galaxy. And there, on one wall, was the arrival of Evgeniya-Jaimisson Corporation,\
  \ aka EJ Corp, aka the Company, with its Negotiator warships and its fortress-sized\
  \ research factories. </p> \n     <p>Blicandrines weren’t savages in the way of\
  \ progress. They weren’t bleeks. They were people Eline just didn’t understand.\
  \ And this cavern—and maybe many more just like it—was important to them, to their\
  \ way of life. EJ Corp would strip mine it into a pit a mile deep. That wouldn’\
  t just be wrong, it would be evil.</p> \n     <p>But it was opportunity. As Eline\
  \ looked around, she saw through the art left behind on the walls, seeing only the\
  \ inubrix lying beneath. “I mean,” she whispered, “just look at all this <em>money</em>.”\
  </p> \n     <p>She made the call.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n\
  \     </center> \n     <p>A few days later, from her stateroom aboard a Company\
  \ Negotiator, Eline heard the first of the explosions as mining charges blew open\
  \ the nearest inubrix cavern. EJ Corp engineers had already arrived, along with\
  \ the soldiers necessary to protect everyone from blicandrine guerrillas. Eline\
  \ knew their way of life was over. That was on her.</p> \n     <p>But her promotion\
  \ to Vice President had arrived. She was being asked—not instructed, but <em>asked</em>—\
  to return to corporate headquarters in the Veskarium, where she’d select a new project\
  \ to manage. And her percentage was locked in. Every ton of inubrix carried off\
  \ Sovall’s Folly would put credits in her account.</p> \n     <p>There was another\
  \ far-off explosion as the Negotiator lifted off. She closed her eyes and acknowledged\
  \ regret. Instead of preserving the culture of another species, she was destroying\
  \ it, exploiting it.</p> \n     <p>But this, she’d decided, was the cost of opportunity.</p>\
