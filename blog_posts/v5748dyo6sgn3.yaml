  \  </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi. I'm Aviva, and I'm new here. Sort\
  \ of. I was an intern at Paizo in 2012, so when I began working with Lone Shark\
  \ in 2016, Pathfinder wasn't totally new to me. I've never really considered writing\
  \ a PACG blog before, but now that I've contributed for a while, I have some important\
  \ things to say. So I've poured a glass of cheap rosé, illuminated a 3-wick vanilla\
  \ butter–scented candle, and hit play on an acoustic Spotify playlist, all to create\
  \ my perfectly chill atmosphere. But you know what's not chill? The inefficiency\
  \ in OG PACG.</p> \n     <p>Maybe you think the earlier products have gotten better\
  \ with age, but I think new players may not have quite the experienced palette you\
  \ do. This isn't making the game sweeter. (I have looked ahead, and yes, the wine\
  \ puns are just going to keep coming. —Mike) The adjustments we're making to the\
  \ flow of your adventure mean you'll be engaged in all the turns and will probably\
  \ have more fun, which... like, why else would you play the game?</p> \n     <p>Yes,\
  \ sometimes the game was too slow. Part of speeding up the new Core Set involved\
  \ filling it with cards that are simpler, both mechanically and visually. This allows\
  \ us to design crazier cards later without obstructing your flow more than otherwise.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Immolate.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-Immolate_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Immolate from Mummy's Mask; Right: Immolate from Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Let's talk visuals first. The additional power\
  \ on the Curse version of Immolate would make it an unreadable font size if templated\
  \ with the previous card design; here, even with an extra power, there's still enough\
  \ room for traits and the check to acquire without covering three different sides\
  \ of art. (The updated wordings also help—you're welcome.) #efficiency.</p> \n \

  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Cell_180.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n      <p>A location from Rise of the Runelords (or should I say Rosé of the\
  \ Runelords?); Right: one from the Core Set.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>On The Leng\
  \ Device, an entire character is blocked by the decklist. With the new card layout,\
  \ you can see all of that skeleton in the Cell. And since there's no back, there's\
  \ no flavor text. That's good because a location doesn't always have just one story.\
  \ In Core, the Cell is used in Scenario 1B: The Blood Vow, in which an ally is held\
  \ captive; and in Scenario 2C: Spirited Away, in which a villain lurks. So we've\
  \ put the story where it belongs: in the storybook. Your stories will be much larger\
  \ and contain more depth without us being so specific on these cards. #efficiency.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Let's move on to mechanics. One minor speedup comes from making checks\
  \ to acquire mandatory, just as checks to defeat have always been. No more analyzing\
  \ your decisions; just roll! If you want, you can take a result of 0 on any check\
  \ and move on. However, you still play out the consequence of that 0.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Let's re-wine a prosec. Why is this faster, you ask? Making you do a thing\
  \ every time there's a thing to do must be longer! But, my friends, you're forgetting\
  \ about that time you spent 10 minutes trying to decide if a check was worth rolling\
  \ for, and then another five minutes trying to figure out if the power prefixed\
  \ by “if you did not succeed” would apply here. There is no more design around whether\
  \ you perform the check or not, which saves you from having to work out the difference\
  \ between “choosing not to make a check” and “failing a check.” Let me show you\
  \ some examples that'll make you say chardon-YAY:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-AzazArafeZazu.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-AzazArafeZazu_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-GrandmotherNightmare.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-GrandmotherNightmare_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>In Mummy's Mask, we wanted things to happen to you\
  \ if you chose not to acquire or if you failed. If you simply decided to not make\
  \ a check against an ally like Azaz Arafe and Zazu, what happens then? It doesn't\
  \ make sense for you to come out better when you didn't try, rather than try and\
  \ fail. So we added the rule “If you choose not to acquire it, it counts as failing\
  \ to acquire it.” If you don't try, you still fail (just like real life, amirite?).\
  \ Now, this is a global rule, which eliminates that extra step of you making a choice\
  \ to make a check. Grandmother Nightmare's “hour power” cares for an entire turn,\
  \ so you better give things your best shot! #efficiency</p> \n     <p>Another thing\
  \ making the game faster: recovery. By having this step at the end of your turn,\
  \ you don't need to interrupt your turn (i.e., the game flow) or whatever check\
  \ you're making to see if you get to recharge the card and then have it matter for\
  \ damage and bad stuff that might happen to your deck. Recovery happens at the end\
  \ of each turn, so you can still recover your cards off-turn, but in many cases,\
  \ the next player can get on with the start of their turn while you're cleaning\
  \ up your own. #multitasking #efficiency</p> \n     <p>Setup of the game is also\
  \ much quicker (yay, you can play sooner!). A big contributor to this is the use\
  \ of proxies, making it so you don't have to search through a million duplicated\
  \ henchmen to find the one you need. Mike talked about proxies in his blog <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgja?Core-Principles-Rethinking-Complexity\"\
  >Rethinking Complexity, Part 2</a>, so I'm going to be #efficient and not re-explain\
  \ here. (But I will mention something he didn't: You also use proxies in place of\
  \ the old character token cards when you need to, like when your token card would\
  \ get shuffled into a deck.)</p> \n     <p>Speaking of tokens (sort of), we now\
  \ have markers. Mike showed you the scourge card design, but not the markers themselves.\
  \ I will, so now you can imagine them together:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>That pink marker could mark that I'm wounded, but then\
  \ again, I like pink, so maybe I want this to mark my Brooch instead. The point\
  \ is I GET TO PICK.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Academy.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-TwistingPassages_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p>Look at all those When Closed powers that help all local people!\
  \ Well, except Twisting Passages.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>One of the larger visual\
  \ changes will be noticeable as you start to accomplish your default goal of closing\
  \ locations: locations are now removed when they're closed. Don't worry, though;\
  \ everything happens for a riesling. This is going to speed up your game while increasing\
  \ both tension and cooperation, thanks to the many \"local\" powers that exist.\
  \ We know you need a chance to heal or buff yourself, and this is exactly what the\
  \ closing powers on many locations will do for you—the nice ones anyway—before they're\
  \ banished and you get to move (usually to a location of your choice)... and off-turn,\
  \ if you weren't the active player. You will be fine. This also means the entire\
  \ board is empty when you win! So, less cleanup too. #efficiency</p> \n     <p>Okay,\
  \ time for me to wine this up.</p> \n     <p>Aviva Schecterson<br> <i>Adventure\
