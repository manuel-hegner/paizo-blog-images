  \    <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week we announced the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpa\">Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a>,\
  \ and this week we’re taking a closer look at the three scenarios releasing when\
  \ the new season launches. Those of you who have had the opportunity to play our\
  \ new intro scenarios for Starfinder Society, which debuted at PaizoCon Online in\
  \ May, already have some idea of what’s coming! We’re taking the same approach for\
  \ this upcoming series of Pathfinder Society intro scenarios. Let’s take a closer\
  \ look at each of these adventures, as well as an exciting new friend your characters\
  \ get to meet!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/44731e37-3815-4368-8ba9-055d7efa2453/061721_RAININCLOUDYDAY.png\"\

  >Pathfinder Society Intro #1: The Second Confirmation</a>, by our own Thurston Hillman,\
  \ is an introduction to the Pathfinder Society for 1st- and 2nd-level characters.\
  \ In this adventure, the Society assigns the characters to a Confirmation, a mission\
  \ designed as a “final test” for new Pathfinder agents. Their mission? Rescue another\
  \ initiate who went missing during their own Confirmation! This adventure is repeatable,\
  \ so it includes several randomized elements and some character choices that allow\
  \ players to enjoy it multiple times. It should serve as an excellent introductory\
  \ offering for many events for the foreseeable future.</p> \n      <p><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Intro #2: United in Purpose</a>, by veteran adventure author\
  \ Brian Duckwitz, is intended as the follow-up to Intro #1, and is also for 1st-\
  \ and 2nd-level characters. Now that they’ve been introduced to the Pathfinder Society\
  \ as a whole and completed their Confirmation, the characters undertake short missions\
  \ for each of the Society’s four major factions (Envoy’s Alliance, Grand Archive,\
  \ Horizon Hunters, and Vigilant Seal). Like Intro #1, this scenario is repeatable\
  \ and includes randomized elements to keep it fresh and fun. Two upcoming Pathfinder\
  \ Bounty releases supplement this scenario with missions from the Society’s minor\
  \ factions (Radiant Oath and Verdant Wheel). These bounties are also repeatable!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-3\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Intro #3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a> (also known as PFS\
  \ #3-01), by Mike Kimmel, is the true introduction to the metaplot of Year 3. A\
  \ group of Pathfinders at the Grand Lodge is handling a sudden deluge of troubling\
  \ correspondence from lodges across the Inner Sea region when they learn of an urgent\
  \ matter in Absalom requiring the Society’s immediate attention. As they tackle\
  \ this mysterious dilemma, they uncover a disturbing truth—but to learn more, you’\
  ll have to play the adventure, and to thwart the Society’s enemies, you’ll need\
  \ to stick around for the rest of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p> \n    \
  \  <p>This three-part, repeatable Intro arc provides enough experience to bring\
  \ a brand-new character up to 2nd level while teaching the character (and the player)\
  \ about the Pathfinder Society’s factions and objectives. Intros #1 and #2 are intended\
  \ to serve this introductory role for new players for the foreseeable future, while\
  \ each year’s Intro #3 will be a fresh scenario to introduce all players to the\
  \ new season’s metaplot. </p> \n      <p>We hope these scenarios are fun, useful,\
  \ and instructive. All three scenarios will launch at <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoh?PaizoCon-Europe-Online-2021-Tickets-GM&amp;fbclid=IwAR0Kwf7_C5NhJO0ERajzTomwzCsmCnmCoyon7D0EZA4Z5u17ZsIe4Xk7-k4\"\
