  >Starfinder Infinite</a> is a group of skilled and incredibly creative individuals.\
  \ Over the years, the Infinite Masters have provided some of the best-in-class titles\
  \ to pair with your adventures.</p>\n      <p><em>“One of my greatest joys each\
  \ month is getting to write a blog showcasing the top performing and newest releases\
  \ on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite. The Infinite creators have such amazing\
  \ ideas, and I’m always looking forward to what they’re cooking up next.” –</em>Rue\
  \ Dickey (they/he/xe) | Marketing &amp; Media Specialist</p>\n      <p>The Infinite\
  \ Masters Program is currently by invitation only; DriveThru and Paizo take suggestions\
  \ from the community about who would be great fits for the program. Infinite Masters\
  \ offer support to one another, giving suggestions and constructive criticism, and\
  \ fostering collaboration that has been part of our best sellers in recent years.</p>\n\
  \      <p><em>“Despite the vast amount of content for Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ we generate at Paizo, our long production timelines and resource limitations mean\
  \ that we can neither be as nimble or prolific as our community sometimes demands.\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite allow the community to meet their own demands\
  \ for MOAR! and with much more responsive timelines. Seeing the professional and\
  \ inspired creations of the Infinite community are a great joy, and provide an incredible\
  \ amount of encouragement to all of us here at Paizo.”</em> –Mark Moreland (he/him)\
  \ | Director of Brand Strategy</p>\n      <p>There is no end to the Infinite community’\
  s imagination; Masters continue to surprise us with every single release. The group\
  \ has grown since its inception, with new creators invited every few months. They\
  \ generate some of the coolest content to pair with your Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ adventures and we’re grateful for not only their creativity, but their willingness\
  \ to be so communicative and open about their hopes about the program.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>While this is only a handful of Infinite Masters in this Infinite Masters\
  \ Spotlight, we hope that you check out all the Infinite Masters and take their\
  \ incredible releases with you on your next journey!</p>\n      <center>\n     \

  \ helping with income during some financial straits, and getting on the ground floor\
  \ of several burgeoning creatives. Writing can be lonely, so I love how we've tried\
  \ to make a collaborative and uplifting space, and I'm going to continue to try\
  \ and help—so any of you thinking about it, come in, the water’s fine, we want to\
  \ support you! The Godsrain Contingencies were inspired by the Godsrain Prophecies\
  \ released in the lead up to the War of Immortals. I already wished I could do something\
  \ for the event but knew I had to wait for materials—but then this stellar story\
  \ by Erin Roberts came out. Weekly I thought, just a little each week and somehow\
  \ it ballooned into a two-month wild ride of 38 pages. I still can't wait to see\
  \ what comes next.”</em> –Heleve Savore (she/her)</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3><a\
