  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 10, 2008</p> \n    <p>Good question! We're\
  \ hearing this one and others like it on the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society messageboards</a>, so we thought we'd use today's blog to give\
  \ you a sneak peak at the Chelax section of the Pathfinder Society Player's Guide\
  \ soon-to-be-released here on paizo.com. All of the base classes will be covered\
  \ in the final Player's Guide. Below we've included just a few of the classes folks\
  \ are having a hard time imagining as non-evil Chelish faction members.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>Chelish Pathfinders</b></p> \n    <p>Since House Thrune rose to prominence,\
  \ reclaiming the past glories of Cheliax and re-establishing their footholds across\
  \ the world has been their primary goal. Chelish armies amass in the ruthless homeland,\
  \ and their agents push far and wide seeking to expand the diabolic empire's influence.\
  \ Chelish culture is widely popular, and their fashions show up in most nations\
  \ across Avistan and Garund. House Thrune places a high priority on discovering\
  \ the relics of the past and controlling the revelation and interpretation of historical\
  \ finds. The noble houses of Cheliax encourage the populace and even their own scions\
  \ to join the Pathfinder Society and seek treasures of ancient power to bolster\
  \ the empire.</p> \n    <p><b>Barbarians:</b> Cheliax is built on law and order.\
  \ The empire runs smoothly with the help of its infernal allies, and they tolerate\
  \ no disruption to the nation's workings. Barbarism does not thrive among the devil-bowing\
  \ culture of Cheliax. Still, there are blood pits in Westcrown where men become\
  \ beasts to the deafening roar of the crowd and the hot spray of an enemy's blood.\
  \ Cheliax's most fierce battle-raging warriors are cultivated from slaves who earn\
  \ a place in the military only after brutal escapades in the blood pits. Other conscripts\
  \ in the army of Cheliax are drawn from captured Shoanti of Varisia who sometimes\
  \ pledge their loyalty to House Thrune and join the Pathfinder Society in the empire's\
  \ service. </p> \n    <p><b>Druids:</b> Cheliax's colonial holdings of old inspired\
  \ several orders of wardens dedicated to safeguarding the majesty of the natural\
  \ world. When House Thrune seized control of the crumbling empire, they bent these\
  \ earthly wonders to their own infernal uses and even today most of the empire's\
  \ natural resources are ruthlessly hewn and sent to the new capital at Egorian for\
  \ whatever sinister purposes House Thrune sees fit. A few of the druidic orders\
  \ of old persisted, doing their best to stem the burning of the land, and convincing\
  \ the noble houses to slow their voracious ravaging of the landscape, lest the resources\
  \ run dry. The Black Wardens survived by dedicating themselves to Asmodeus dogma,\
  \ claiming they grow the trees to stoke the fires of his dark glory. Other orders\
  \ like the Sisters of Oak maintain their vigil over the landscape with no official\
  \ ties to the Church of Asmodeus, but doing so sometimes creates friction between\
  \ their order and the government of Egorian. Still as the country's natural resources\
  \ wane, the government of Cheliax cannot afford to eradicate these druids, and are\
  \ forced to form tenuous agreements with them in order to save their nation's landscape\
  \ from utter destruction. </p> \n    <p><b>Monks:</b> Monastic orders abound in\
  \ Cheliax, most steeped in martial arts once trained in the smoldering depths of\
  \ the Nine Hells. The coveted martial arts of devil kind are now practiced by the\
  \ Chelish in secret sects and monasteries all over the empire. Several of these\
  \ orders are attached to the Chelish legion, and in particular the martial art of\
  \ Hamatulatsu, learned from barbed devils, is practiced by monks in military service.\
  \ Other orders include the Sidaal Thram, an order of glaive wielding martial arts\
  \ masters who wear long bears braided with barbs and blades, as well as the spiked\
  \ chain wielding Order of the Razored Shackle, who wrap themselves in the kyton's\
  \ chains and engage in horrifying self mutilation as part of their path to excellence.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Paladins:</b> Paladins are a rare sight in Cheliax. Before House Thrune\
  \ rose to power, the shining servants of Iomedae and her slain patron Aroden rode\
  \ throughout Old Cheliax. Some are still there and do the best they can to serve\
  \ her glory in a nation much overshadowed in darkness. They see it as their divine\
  \ duty to bring the empire back to a path of temperance, or at least to balance\
  \ the evils of their homeland. More than a few paladins of Aroden still believe\
  \ their god will return someday to bring the nation back into the light. These paladins\
  \ remain to herald his return, and hold on to the burning idea of Old Cheliax, a\
  \ sprawling empire whose glory was a beacon in a dark and savage world. </p> \n\
