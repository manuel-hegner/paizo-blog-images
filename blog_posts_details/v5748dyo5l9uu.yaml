    those ones; Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories; Moorcock's Elric series;\
    \ China Miéville's stories, particularly Perdido Street Station and The Scar;\
    \ Jack Vance's 4-book Dying Earth series (which I think is now published in a\
    \ Dying Earth omnibus); C. L. Moore's Jirel of Joiry series ; Hugh Cook's 10-book\
    \ series The Chronicles of an Age of Darkness; H. P. Lovecraft; and Henry Kuttner's\
    \ The Dark World and Elak of Atlantis. A lot of these authors and titles influenced\
    \ the mood and tone of the setting, as far as being sword and sorcery stories.\
    \ Michael Moorcock's Elric series being the only exception, these stories feature\
    \ protagonists who are not superhuman; each is just a dude. It's like how Captain\
    \ America is a regular guy compared to the other Marvel superheroes—he can't fly\
    \ and doesn't have any remarkable powers. Batman obviously falls into this category\
    \ as well. The characters in these stories are powerful but not superhumanly so.\
    \ More importantly, almost, is the idea that the environment itself is the antagonist,\
    \ and the characters are exceptional—but otherwise ordinary—people who must fight\
    \ back or the world will destroy them. Tolkien was an influence only so far as\
    \ he influenced D&D. The world he created just didn't fit with what we were trying\
    \ to do with Golarion. To be honest, it is too hopeful, not grim enough. I asked\
    \ Jason Bulmahn when we were first creating Golarion, rhetorically, if it would\
    \ be possible for Paizo to build a world without gnomes, dwarves, elves, and the\
    \ like. Of course we immediately came to the conclusion that it would be impossible,\
    \ but it gives you an idea of what we were trying to achieve with Golarion. Gary\
    \ Gygax's Gord the Rogue books were very influential in the way that they showed,\
    \ through storytelling and world-building, the sort of milieux that the inherent\
    \ style of a world governed by the game's rules. Even if used simply as a point\
    \ of departure, that's an invaluable resource. The early Thieves World anthologies\
    \ were also an influence, more in terms of style and world-view than anything\
    \ else. Greyhawk and Sanctuary are photocopies of Leiber's Lankhmar, and when\
    \ it comes to a location most exemplifying the fantasy RPG spirit, Lankhmar is\
    \ the place. Thus concludes the first part of my interview with Erik and the first\
    \ installment of The Fabled Appendix. Next time: Erik discusses how Osirion and\
    \ Cheliax were born, and the books and horrible vacations that inspired their\
    \ creation. David Eitelbach Editorial Intern"
