  \ 4!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 30, 2013</p> \n   <p>Get ready for\
  \ even more monsters—<a href=\"/products/btpy8yop\"><i>Bestiary 4</i></a> is coming\
  \ this Fall!</p> \n   <p>We've searched through dozens of real-world bestiaries,\
  \ countless online sources, reports of strangeness from all over the world, our\
  \ favorite films and fiction, and right here on our own message boards to compile\
  \ another collection of creatures even more diabolical than those that have come\
  \ before. Like the first three, <i>Bestiary 4</i> has more than 300 pages and features\
  \ hundreds of monsters of a terrifying variety appropriate for every Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game campaign.</p> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This time\
  \ there's more than just strange stories and bizarre powers amping up the threats,\
  \ though. With the godlike powers soon to be unleashed in <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8c\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures</i></a>, there's about to be a\
  \ whole new caliber of heroes in need of threats to overcome, and <i>Bestiary 4</i>\
  \ provides. Just as characters of any level might have mythic powers, the same is\
  \ true of monsters. Infused with mythic power, legends like the immortal guardian\
  \ dragon, faith-fueled juggernauts, and vampiric leanen sidhe rise to rampage across\
  \ your campaign. But shattering all past power levels are truly world-ending terrors\
  \ like demon lords, Great Old Ones, elohim, kaiju, and more! Simply put, no Bestiary\
  \ has ever been as deadly as this.</span></p> \n   <p>But even though mythic creatures\
  \ function exactly as normal Pathfinder RPG monsters and are useable even in non-mythic\
  \ games, they comprise but a small percentage of this collection's total terror.\
  \ Inside, you'll find beasties of every Challenge Rating, of all your favorite creature\
  \ types, and appropriate for adventures of every level. So what should you expect?</p>\
  \ \n   <ul>\n    <li>Favorites from past bestiaries, like new clockwork creatures,\
  \ drakes, and gremlins!</li> \n    <li>The return of nearly forgotten foes like\
  \ formians, nosferatu, and even the terrifying almiraj!</li> \n    <li>Nightmares\
  \ from both the real world—like argus, einherjar, and pickled punks—and the world\
  \ of Golarion—like fleshwarps, gallowdead, and psychopomps!</li> \n    <li>Terrors\
  \ from your favorite fiction and film, like bodysnatchers, Grendel, and nightgaunts!</li>\
  \ \n    <li>The newest generations of Bestiary regulars, like slag giants, blood\
  \ golems, and the enigmatic outer dragons!</li> \n    <li>Entirely new terrors,\
  \ like karkinoi, necrocrafts, owbs, and soulbound shells!</li> \n    <li>New templates\
  \ like divine guardian, mummified, and shadow, to multiply your current creature\
  \ collection!</li> \n    <li>New player-friendly races, familiars, and constructs\
  \ offering characters a host of new options!</li> \n    <li>Mythic threats!</li>\
  \ \n    <li>And much, much more!</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>Beyond giving gamers the\
  \ creatures they've been begging for and expanding every GM's monstrous arsenal,\
  \ each Pathfinder Bestiary has a very general theme. With <i>Bestiary 4</i>... well,\
  \ just take a look at Wayne Reynolds's newest cover and take your best guess at\
  \ the sorts of stories that influenced our selections.</p> \n   <p>We'll have plenty\
  \ more to say about and show off from <a href=\"/products/btpy8yop\"><i>Bestiary\
  \ 4</i></a> in the months leading up to its Fall release, but for now, check out\
  \ that awesome cover and start dropping menacing hints to your players—because terrible\
  \ things are on the way.</p> \n   <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\
