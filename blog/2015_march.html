               <p itemprop="description">Hello! <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> marks the third Adventure Path for our humble little <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and we are just pleased as punch that you would pony up your hard-earned nickels to—</p> 
               <p>Man, to hell with that polite nonsense. Or rather, to the Abyss with it. Let's gas up our panhead Harleys, set fire to the gas station, and head off on a power ride into a canyon of flames.</p> 
               <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is all the sin you want in one game. Designers Paul Peterson and Tanis O'Connor will march you lockstep through the gory battlegrounds of the Worldwound in the next couple weeks. For now, I'm going to describe how we got to the gates of the Abyss, and why we barreled right on through.</p> 
               <h2>The First Sin: Pride</h2> 
               <p>When we were considering the next Adventure Path, we thought about what had come before it. <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> was a catalogue of essential fantasy tropes: there were goblins and ogres and dragons and giants and everything under the sun. <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> was a lot more focused and personal: you were kidnapped pirates trying to stay alive in a sea of sharks and buccaneers. As epic as those adventures were, they seemed... manageable. You could get your brain around how to defeat the challenge. We wanted something crazy impossible for the next set, something that would make everyone say "How exactly do you expect us to beat THAT?" Basically, we wanted to show off. So we pridefully looked around for the most impossible thing. Going into the Abyss to stop a demon prince's invasion of the world sounded pretty, pretty good.</p> 
               <h2>The Second Sin: Sloth</h2> 
               <div class="blurb180">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO9073-StormKing.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO9073-StormKing_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Illustration by Miguel Regodón Harkness</i>
               </div> 
               <p>I've made no secret of the major influence that the videogame Diablo had on the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. The plot of Diablo is pretty simple: there's a demon lord named Diablo, and he's not a very nice guy, and so you kill everything in your path to get to him. Blizzard made two more Diablo videogames after Diablo, and they were exactly that thing two more times. Maybe that thing was the best thing ever. I have probably sat on my couch for a full three months of my life playing Diablo. Yes, I could be using that time to go outside and interact with the world. To heck with that. There's demons to kill. So when it became apparent that we could write an entire Adventure Path about carving a swath through the Abyss, I was on it like a Shakespeare sonnet.</p> 
               <h2>The Third Sin: Gluttony</h2> 
               <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is about being mythic heroes. I mean, seriously mythic. Kings of the world, really. Everything is just bigger in the Worldwound. We wanted all that stuff. Of course, we had a real challenge ahead, because we needed every character we've ever created to work in that environment. We had to come up with a lot of clever trickery to make that all work. But basically, we did it because we like to eat the most awesome things, and nobody was gonna stop us from eating all of them.</p> 
               <br style="clear: both;"> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-Mythic.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-Mythic_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <h2>The Fourth Sin: Greed</h2> 
               <p>And oh, the toys! The Pathfinder RPG folks had built up all these artifacts and relics and other boss things that just didn't make sense in an intimate story like <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>. We made a thing called a Boomcrown for you. Also, we made a bow that fires dragon breath. And that's not even scraping the surface. Would you like to ride a Dire Griffon? Got that for you. Wanna cast a spell called Terraform? No problem. Maybe have a goddess as an ally? All of this and more can be yours! It's so cool.</p> 
               <h2>The Fifth Sin: Lust</h2> 
               <p>I would like to introduce you to my friend Nocticula. She's a demon lord who controls a realm made out of the corpses of demon lords she's killed. She's got a cavalcade of succubi and incubi and other demons of lust, ready to bring down the will of the mortal world. She's a super-hot nova of sex and violence. And she's your friend. That's just the kind of thing that keeps our attention in <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-NocticulasAttentionCard.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-NocticulasAttentionCard_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <h2>The Sixth Sin: Envy</h2> 
               <p>And okay, here's the basest reason we wanted to do <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>. We were working on <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> when the Pathfinder RPG guys were designing the RPG version of <em>Wrath</em>. Throughout the day, we would hear them chuckling at the latest evil machination that James Jacobs and his team had come up with. They were having so much fun. And quite honestly, we're not the kind of folks who can abide people having fun without us. So we stole their fun. I'm sure they will get it back someday.</p>

                <br> <i>Illustration by Bryan Sola</i>
               </div> 
               <h2>The Seventh Sin: Wrath</h2> 
               <p>With all those rationalizations under our belt, we set about to designing <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, breaking everything along the way. One of the coolest things about this game line is how the sets seem to take on the personality of one member of the design team. <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> is Chad's: it's a sweeping arc of everything one can pack into a fantasy game. <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em> is Gaby's: it's a jaunty adventure on the high seas, with all the yo-ho-hoing her galvo-obsessed brain can handle. The organized play seasons are Tanis's: they're a big inclusive tent under which all gamers can gather.</p> 
               <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is Paul Peterson's. Paul is the designer of Smash Up and Guillotine and other violent-sounding games. If I'm going to find someone to design a hellscape, he's my guy. And so he'll be leading you through <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>. Buckle up, because it's going to be a bumpy ride.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">PaizoCon 2013 was a special occasion—and not only because it was my first as a Paizo employee. It was also the playtest run of <a href="/products/btpy8xki"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #5-00: Siege of the Diamond City</em></a> by the esteemed <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfza">Thurston Hillman</a> (Thursty as we often call him), and the two of us had an opportunity to hang out in the hotel bar for several hours afterward. At first we spoke about entirely professional matters, such as how the playtest went, what changes we would make, and the screams of players whose characters foolishly attacked the <b>[REDACTED]</b>. As I have learned is typical of our conversations, we gradually meandered into the realm of theorycrafting, humorous hypotheticals, and madness.</p> 
               <p>Somehow we started talking about a Special to end all Specials—an event so maddeningly obnoxious that at least half of all tables would be flipped by the half-way point, the author would end the night tarred and feathered, and the Recent Reviews banner on paizo.com would be choked with the adventure's 1-star reviews for a week straight. Demons were still pretty fresh on our minds, and in an attempt to create a suitably kooky yet catchy title, I dubbed it "Shax's House of Pain," named for the demon lord of murder, lies, and sadistic torture.</p> 
               <p>We were on a roll that evening, and together we detailed at least ten different encounter areas that all centered on pulling the rug out from under players, tearing up Chronicle sheets, and metagame humor. Several brave souls stuck around for a while as Thursty and I spoke with escalating excitement and increasingly frequent falsettos. The shrill "Shax's House of Paaaain!" became our battle cry for the next 24 hours, and we sometimes heard a few others shout it from down the hall. Ever since, I've seen it referenced at the weirdest times on the messageboards, and sometimes I hear it uttered at conventions.</p> 
               <p>Well, two years ago, Mark Moreland and I cooked up a <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lely">fake blog post about defective Chronicle sheets</a> for April Fool's Day, and last year I felt the pressure to outdo that somehow. Unfortunately, April 1st fell on a Tuesday, so another blog was out of the question. Instead, I decided it was time to up the ante on Thursty's and my abyssal creation and grant it the mockery of unlife... by actually assigning it.</p> 
               <p>The email used the same format as any official assignment, but I tweaked the language to give Thursty a growing sense of its comical disingenuousness. For example, it informed him that he would be paid a negative amount of money and should expect an invoice from our finance department to sort out how much tribute Mr. Hillman owed us for the privilege of writing this piece. It further instructed Thursty to tinker with our stat block spreadsheet until it broke (and report any issues to Mark Moreland) and advised that his final turnover would be due on March 31st, 2014—the day before he even received the outline. As icing on the cake, I signed my name by including my dear officemate Mark Moreland's email address as the point of contact.</p> 
               <p>Of course, this was just some crude rewriting of email boilerplate, and I knew that leaving it at that would just elicit a shrug and a halfhearted golf clap. That wouldn't do. Instead I dedicated far too much free time to writing up a full assignment outline, which I have reprinted here (minus a bit of unnecessary introduction that spoils part of Season 5).</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><em>Shax's House of Pain</em> is a Pathfinder Society Exclusive scenario for 5th- to 9th-level characters. It provides characters an opportunity to cry their own bodyweight in tears and contributes to the ongoing Decemvirate faction metaplot.</p> 
                <h2>Adventure (30,000-40,000 words)</h2> 
                <p>... In fact, Shax, lord of lies, envy, and particularly violent murder, has worked from the shadows to ensure that the Pathfinder Society dies horribly in its final showdown with his disciple Tancred Desimire. Thinking themselves clever, Pathfinder agents studied Desimire's diaries and spelled out a hidden message by erasing all but prime-numbered letters, reversing their order, and then translating the new message into Aklo with a poorly written bilingual dictionary.</p> 
                <p>Master of Scrolls Kreighton Shaine gathers the PCs in the Grand Lodge to perform a counter-ritual to foil Desimire's plans, but upon beginning the rite, Shaine accidentally remarks that he is hungry and would appreciate a sandwich. The admission flings the PCs into the Abyss (no saving throw), specifically into the depths of Charnelhome, Shax's abyssal realm. They land in between two massive slices of whole wheat toast on top of a table made of fiendish spider swarms being used for a demonic tea party attended by powerful demons; to promote the <em>Advanced Class Guide</em>, be sure to give them levels in something sensible like bloodrager. This is a social encounter. Use the structure employed in <em>The Blakros Matrimony</em> in which the PCs must positively influence multiple demons to apologize sufficiently for ruining their party; however, skill checks alone are insufficient. A PC must perform a profane act of villainous, self-effacing depravity to be allowed to attempt a skill check. Be sure to include a sidebar reminding the GM how the atonement spell works.</p> 
                <p>Once the PCs successfully convince the demons to let them go, they are free to explore adjacent rooms in a sandbox-style adventure that actually allows the players no freedom of choice. To introduce the PCs to Charnelhome lightly, start them on easy (APL+4) encounters before ramping up the difficulty. Consider classic encounters such as fiendish kraken, hydras that are actually amalgams of all linnorms published to date, prismatic spray elementals, greater pugwampis, and some kind of evil clown demon (include the creature's stats in the appendix in case you want to use these in multiple encounters). When mapping this area, depict at least one chamber that can only be represented accurately by printing out the map and twisting it into a non-Euclidean Mobius strip. Should the PCs have difficulties, Shax himself appears in a burst of blood mist wearing a pristine white smoking jacket to heal the Pathfinders sufficiently to continue the adventure.</p> 
                <p>Once the PCs have overcome these routine challenges, begin presenting them with more difficult encounters. Popular choices include swarms of vorpal chickens, elder god golems (don't use that imitation elder god stuff; use the real thing), kaiju, and abyssal gut worms that consume the PCs from the inside out (pro tip: this grants them a surprise round). To save on word count, consider referencing random encounters in existing Adventure Path volumes without actually reprinting relevant text.</p> 
                <p>The PCs then come across a courtyard garden in which Shax has set out a pleasant buffet, table settings, and chairs. He apologizes for the PCs' recent inconveniences and invites the PCs to relax and let him know if anything has upset them lately. If the PCs fail to list their grievances without using the letter E, Shax cackles, eats 5d4+5 random boons (including ones earned by non-participating characters), and teleports them back to the initial encounter, where they find an insulting handout that informs them why they failed. When the PCs next encounter Shax, he repeats his tactic but chooses five other different letters at random to listen for. The third time, Shax is absent, but if any PC looks for him, the GM gets to smash the player's mini with a hammer (included with the pdf download). The scenario concludes with a thrilling ten-paragraph opus of read-aloud text in which less competent Pathfinders save the PCs in an excruciating act of <i>deus ex machina</i>.</p> 
                <h2>Metaplot</h2> 
                <p>Season 5, Year of the Demon, does not use traditional faction missions, but many scenarios emphasize the season goals of one or more factions. When such a faction's goal features in a scenario, it typically takes up more time than a Season 0-4 faction mission would have, but many are tasks that a Pathfinder of any faction would find interesting.</p> 
                <p>The Decemvirate faction is interested in accomplishing awesome stuff, which is explained in a faction head letter update on paizo.com accessible only by moderators. Include several opportunities for faction PCs to fulfill goals that rely heavily on player knowledge and yet-to-be-published sourcebooks in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting line.</p> 
                <h2>Maps</h2> 
                <p>You have a map allotment of 5 pages worth of new maps to create for this adventure. These can be 5 vertically aligned full-page maps or 10 horizontally aligned half-page maps. In either case, north should correspond with real-world geographic north when at all possible. Feel free to use out-of-print maps from Paizo's GameMastery Flip Mat and Map Pack lines. If you decide to generate your own maps, be sure that no single map can fit on a Flip Mat (24x30 squares). When possible, have one square equal 27 feet.</p> 
                <h2>Additional Reference Material</h2> 
                <p>Since this adventure takes place in Charnelhome, please familiarize yourself with that topic before outlining and writing the scenario.</p>

                <br><i>Mark Moreland just got his 'Not Canon!' stamp today, and he graciously weighed in with his opinion of my flawless outline.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>To Thursty's extraordinary credit, he took this assignment email and expanded it into a massive April Fool's Day email campaign sent to various Paizo employees. Among these jokingly-crafted missives were a letter to the finance department asking to meet in person in Florida for the cash transaction (which Thursty would happily pay using Canadian currency), a letter to Mark telling him to add a wealth of 3rd-party publications to the stat block spreadsheet (and build a new one to handle 3rd-edition psionics), a letter to the tech team requesting a new section of the website dedicated to the adventure be designed within the next week (including an interactive and animated demon element programmed entirely in Flash), and an email to several of our marketing and sales folks instructing them to prioritize a massive world-wide release of the adventure over promoting PaizoCon (including a request that Cosmo somehow finagle a Shax's House of Pain TV series). Of course, each of these ended with a polite request to forward any questions the recipients might have to Mark Moreland.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps my favorite was a letter to our project manager, Jessica Price. With their permission, I'll reprint a portion here.</p> 
               <blockquote> <i><p>The sheer amount of energy required to upkeep the time travel necessary to match these timelines is ridiculous. I have done some research, speaking with AP authors, and I have discovered that they are only required to go 1 week back in time to complete their projects. This is just another example of how AP authors are given <b><u>preferential treatment</u></b> over PFS writers. I don't mean to rant, but this is getting out of hand.</p> <p>I don't know how much money AP authors are expected to pay when they are tasked with writing for Paizo, but I'm assuming it's somewhere in the thousands. Compare this to the paltry tribute us PFS authors need to provide to our overseers... Again, further discrimination.</p> <p>Anyways, I digress. I simply wanted you to be aware of this potential problem with scheduling. As I am a handsome and charming miracle worker, this will pose no problem for me, but other less handsome authors may struggle under these conditions. My suggestion is to increase the tribute required by PFS authors to at least $XX, that way you know they have a well-paying job that affords them the extra time to work on freelance.</p></i> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Her response?</p> 
               <blockquote> <i><p>Thanks for the heads-up, Thursty. Unfortunately, we don't currently have the resources to manage having you pay us fees equal to those of the AP writers, or to extend your deadlines further into the past. I'm happy to put a meeting together to reevaluate this after our Gen Con 2025 crunch period, when we should all have a bit more breathing room to circle the wagons on our current processes.</p></i> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Brilliant.</p> 
               <p>The madness gradually wound down by the end of the day, but I fondly remember April 1st, 2014 as one of my favorite April Fool's pranks. The holiday's almost here again, but I think I'll take this year off. After all, I need to save my energy for another round of memory making at this year's <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>!</p> 
               <p>Oh, and Thursty? I still haven't received your turnover. What gives?</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Award-winning author Chris A. Jackson talks about writing his latest Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href="/products/btpy9aon"><em>Pirate's Promise</em></a>, and how living full-time aboard a 45-foot sailboat in the Caribbean inspires his tales of love, espionage, and high-seas adventure:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>A night as black as a devil's soul. No moon, no stars, only a light breeze in the sails and the roar of surf off the bow. We can't see it, but we can hear it, each successive crash of the sea against razor sharp coral a death knell that grabs your gut and gives a little twist. Our chart is crap, no radar, no GPS, only a compass and a depth sounder, and the soundings keep getting shallower. Did I mention the engine had quit? All we wanted was shelter from the seas for the night, but we didn't arrive until after dark; now we're committed. When it feels right, you turn into the wind, furl the sail, and drop anchor. It holds. We're safe. Deep sigh of relief, and where's the rum?</p> 
                <p>This is how I researched "approaching a shore in the dark" for <em>Pirate's Promise</em>. I don't recommend it. I researched "heavy weather" off the Oregon coast in 60 knot winds and 35 foot breaking seas. When one of those waves hits the boat, every item in the cabin becomes airborne and slams against the wall, including you. Your face is pressed against a window as the boat lies on its side, a thin layer of Lexan between you and a mile deep ocean, ready to take you... greedy, hungry. I don't recommend that either.</p> 
                <p>Okay, so this wasn't exactly research, but I use these experiences when I write nautical fiction. There have also been plenty of beautiful nights with skies so full of stars you can't see the constellations, and whales, and dolphins, and palm trees... and rum for the times both good and bad.</p> 
                <p>Looks like I've found my niche, or at least part of it. The other part seems to be making romance part of the plot, but better... because it's Pathfinder! Yes, she's a snake! So what? Beauty isn't just scale deep, you know!</p> 
                <p>How did I do my research on the romance? Well... I do recommend falling in love, and not just for literary research interests. Yeah, I can hear that one: "So, you wanna research a novel with me?" Still, there's nothing like experiencing that exquisite stupidity of being in love to add some realism to your romance writing.</p> 
                <p>I'm not telling how I researched Vreva Jhafae... </p> 
                <p>But if there's something else you want to know about <a href="/products/btpy8xc7"><em>Pirate's Honor</em></a> or <a href="/products/btpy9aon"><em>Pirate's Promise</em></a>, let's discuss it. I'd like to hear what everyone thinks, likes, or wants. With a lifetime's worth of sea stories, there must be something you want to know.</p> 
                <p>To quote 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: "It's a whale of a tale, and it's all true. I swear by my tattoo!"</p>

             <h1 itemprop="headline">The Gem</h1> 
             <p class="date">by Gary Kloster</p> 
             <h2>Chapter One: Gods and Crocodiles</h2> 
             <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
              <p itemprop="description">Outside, the children of Thirty Trees laughed and their parents talked, monkeys chattered in the canopy and birds sang to the morning sun. But inside the little house that Jiri shared with Oza, the only sound that mattered was the muted clicks of the clay pots her teacher was packing into his bag.</p> 
              <p>"They think I'll burn the village down." Jiri swung her feet and her hammock stirred beneath her, an unsteady motion that matched her mood. </p> 
              <p>"They don't think that." Oza, shaman of Thirty Trees, pulled the ties of his bag tight. "Well, not all of them."</p> 
              <p>"Most of them." Jiri's feet kicked too hard, and her hammock tipped. Used to its treachery, she dropped out before it could dump her. "They don't trust me. They only made me a Mosa because you wanted them to, and they love you. But I'm not you, Oza."</p> 
              <p>"Thank the spirits." Oza stood, the short braids of his graying hair brushing against the baskets of dried herbs and roots that hung overhead. "If there were two of me, we'd need a bigger house."`</p> 
              <p>Jiri frowned up at her teacher. She didn't like being reminded that her growth had stopped well before she had wanted it to, leaving her shorter than any other adult in Thirty Trees. "You'd have to make it bigger, or you'd choke on all the old-man farts," she grumbled.</p> 
              <p>Oza laughed, and Jiri smiled a little at the sound, but inside...</p> 
              <p><i>They don't trust me.</i> Her eyes rose to the cone of their roof. They had replaced the thatch that had burned, but she could still see the charred beams from that night. <i>One nightmare, and I almost killed us.</i></p> 
              <p>Oza's laughter faded when he saw her gaze shift, and his face grew serious. "It's been almost a year, Jiri, and that was the last time."</p> 
              <p>Oza was right. Almost a year had passed since that night Jiri had woken in terror from her dream of being trapped somewhere dark, somewhere deep, and seen the flames birthed by her anger and fear dancing overhead. But she still remembered that surge of joy, of triumph, that had flooded through her at the sight of the fire twisting like red and yellow vines through the thatch. She also remembered how that triumph and joy had crumbled into horror when she realized what she had done. </p> 
              <p><i>If it hadn't been raining, if Oza hadn't been ready with his magic, the whole house would have burned. Maybe the whole village.</i></p> 
              <p>Jiri had worked so hard since then. Practicing the meditations that Oza had taught her, walking the spirit world with him, learning to control her magic and her ability to call the spirits to her, to bargain with them for their power. She had learned control. The water bucket no longer sat full beside Oza's hammock. But...</p> 
              <p><i>The spirit of fire is always there, waiting, so eager for me to call it, so eager to serve. To burn, and destroy.</i> Jiri rubbed her hands together, hands that should have been marked with scars from all the times she had burned herself with her magic as a child. Oza had always been there to heal her, though, to fix the damage that she had caused. And now he was going, leaving her alone for the first time that she could remember. Jiri realized heat was gathering in the fists her hands had made, and the feel of it was comforting and terrifying all at once.</p> 
              <p>She breathed, in and out, focusing on herself, separating her spirit from the fire, putting its bright magic to the side. When she had control again, she looked up and found Oza's eyes on her, serious and patient.</p> 
              <p>"Mosa Jiri Maju," he said. "There will always be those who don't trust you. What matters is that you trust yourself. Like I trust you." Oza brushed back Jiri's long braids with a calloused hand. "You are strong in magic. You may be stronger than me someday. That's a dangerous blessing, and there will be times it feels like a curse. But your spirit is good. You will be a great shaman for your people."</p> 
              <p>"Even if they're not sure they want to be <i>my</i> people?" Jiri asked.</p> 
              <p>"They may not have that choice," Oza said. He smiled again, though his eyes stayed serious. "You may be shaman to more than this one village, this one tribe, someday. But for the next two days, you are the shaman of Thirty Trees. Which I'm sure will still be standing when I come back from Kibwe."</p> 
              <p>"Unless that giant crocodile we had three years ago comes back. Or that band of charau-ka that tried to raid us last harvest."</p> 
              <p>"Why worry small?" Oza said. "Why not both at once?"</p> 
              <p>"Because then we'd just feed the charau-ka to the crocodile and poison it." Jiri frowned at her teacher. "But what if—"</p> 
              <p>"What if dragons, or kongamato, or inkanyamba, or any other of the great beasts I've taught you about? What if demons or the Gorilla King himself? Then you can send someone to fetch me. Kibwe's less than a day away. But I think what you need to be ready for is spider-bites, fireweed itch, and arguments over how often you should bless the mango trees. Those are things I know you can handle." Oza hoisted his bag to his shoulder and reached out his hand. Jiri touched his palm with hers, and they gripped fingers for a long moment. Then Jiri let go with a sigh.</p> 
              <p>"Gods, spirits, and ancestors, may they watch, protect, and guide," Oza said in farewell. But he had barely stepped out the door before a thickset older man stopped him. It was Mazi, the wara of Thirty Trees. </p> 
              <div class="blurb180">
               <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TheGem-Oza.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TheGem-Oza_180.jpeg"></a>
               <br> <i>Everyone in Thirty Trees respects Oza's wisdom.</i>
              </div> 
              <p>"Shaman! Thank all my ancestors that you have not left yet. I need to speak to you about something urgent."</p> 
              <p>Jiri twitched, fear flooding into her, and relief that Oza was still there.</p> 
              <p>"What is it?" Oza asked.</p> 
              <p>"It is a matter that is best kept quiet," Mazi said. The village's leader stepped close to Oza, and Jiri had to strain to hear him. "Something bit me. In a very, ah, <i>tender</i> place. The itch is unbearable."</p> 
              <p>"Ah." Oza turned back toward his house, catching Jiri's eye. His face was serious, but his eyes weren't. "Jiri will be able to help with that." </p> 
              <p>"Yes. Jiri. Well." Mazi shifted uncomfortably, and Jiri noticed how the wara was carefully holding the loose cotton of his mud cloth away from his skin. "Couldn't you—"</p> 
              <p>"I follow the spirits, Wara," Oza said solemnly. "And they say I must be off. Jiri will heal you." Oza looked once more at Jiri, the corner of his mouth barely crooked into a smile. She frowned back at him, but smoothed her face carefully as she stepped out into the morning sun.</p> 
              <p>"Wara. Please, let me help. Or would you rather wait until Oza returns?"</p> 
              <p>Mazi watched the older shaman stride away and sighed. "No. Just... no fire," he said as he shuffled past her, into her house.</p> 
              <p>Jiri turned her back on all the other villagers who happened to be standing around outside, hiding their smiles with varying degrees of success.</p> 
              <p>"No fire," she said. </p> 
              <p><i>Maybe the giant crocodile wouldn't have been so bad.</i></p> 
              <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
              <p>"I'm sorry," Jiri said. "She's dead."</p> 
              <p>"Ancestors cry." Dama shifted her baby on her hip and sighed. "White Ear was my best milker, but she was never the smartest goat. Drowning in a puddle, though? I didn't think she was that stupid."</p> 
              <p>Jiri pulled her feet with some difficulty out of the deep mud and splashed out of the pool that her neighbor had found White Ear bobbing in. "It's surprisingly deep," she said, wringing out the bottom of her shirt. Yesterday, after Oza had left, it had started raining. This was not unusual in the Mwangi, where rained most days this time of year. But this rain had been heavy, and had lasted through the night, only clearing after dawn. Now the jungle steamed and dripped in the morning sun, and the children were sliding through the red mud and playing in the little streams that ran between, and sometimes through, Thirty Trees' houses.</p> 
              <p>Their parents seemed less amused.</p> 
              <p>"Neh." Dama shook her head. "Mud everywhere, and now I have to butcher a goat. At least we'll eat well tonight. Join us?"</p> 
              <p> "Thank you. I—"</p> 
              <p>"Jiri! Where's Oza?"</p> 
              <p>Jiri spun when she heard her name and saw the young man running up. Hadzi. The boy that Oza had been teasing her about for the past year, the boy that she had such trouble looking at when he was looking at her, but whom she could stare at quite happily when he was doing anything else. For a moment Jiri was acutely aware that she was covered in mud and goat hair, her braids an unruly tangle around her face. That feeling flashed away, though, when Hadzi splashed to a stop in front of her. He was breathing hard, covered in mud and soaked in water and sweat, and his eyes were wide in his handsome face.</p> 
              <p>"Oza's still in Kibwe. What's happened?"</p> 
              <p> "Boro." Hadzi gasped his brother's name. "In trouble. At the river."</p> 
              <p>"Take me," Jiri said, and she followed when he turned and started to run again.</p> 
              <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
              <p>They reached the river too early.</p> 
              <p>Rain-swollen, the dirt-red water had spread far beyond its usual banks. Jiri splashed through it behind Hadzi, stumbling over hidden brush, hoping not to fall into a hole, eyes searching for crocodiles. </p> 
              <p>"Here," Hadzi said, rounding the big gaboon tree that marked where the trail they were trying to follow turned toward the river's usual banks. "Oza's gone! I brought Jiri!" he shouted as he disappeared behind the tree's buttress roots.</p> 
              <p>Jiri thought she might have heard a curse answer Hadzi's shout, but she was too distracted to worry about it when she came around the tree. Below her, the jungle opened up and she could see the river proper. Normally narrow and placid, it had become a red-brown monster, its center churning with foam and drifting debris as it rushed by. Close to them, a great pile of branches and small trees had caught against the massive, moss-covered stone that normally stood at the river's edge. Tangled in that wrack of limbs and roots was a boat, one of the big river ships that ran cargo between Kibwe and the outer villages. Clustered on the stone over the wreck was a group from the village, young men and women mostly. Out on the snag, Jiri spotted Fumo, Hadzi's father, balanced on a tree trunk beside the boat, holding something that lay half in the water. </p> 
              <p>Boro.</p> 
              <p>Jiri splashed her way down toward the stone. The water rose rapidly, over her knees, to her waist, almost up to her arms, and she cursed her shortness as the current shoved at her and she had to half-swim to reach the outcrop. Hands grabbed her when she got close, yanking her out of the dangerous water, but she didn't feel much safer perched on the moss-covered rock. Still, the stone was much more certain than the unsteady wrack of logs. Carefully, Jiri stepped out onto a broken tree trunk. Then she dropped to her hands and knees and crawled forward, moving from trunk to branch to trunk toward Fumo, ignoring the constant shaking of the brush beneath her.</p> 
              <p>The man clung to a thick log, arms wrapped around Boro, holding him up. Boro's teeth were locked in pain, and he was twisted at a strange angle, his right leg under the water. Caught, Jiri realized, trapped by some shifting branch. Without his father's hold, he would be jerked down and crushed between the logs or drowned. </p> 
              <p>Fumo looked at her, his arms shaking. "I can't hold him like this much longer."</p> 
              <p>Gods and crocodiles, Jiri thought, staring at Boro. <i>What would Oza do?</i></p> 
              <p><i>What can I do?</i></p> 
              <p>Then one of the women crouching on the stone behind them shouted.</p> 
              <p>"Look out!"</p> 
              <p>Jiri looked up and saw it, a black-green shape being swept along by the river's current, but angling toward them. It could have been a fallen tree—it was big enough—but she knew what it was immediately.</p> 
              <p>"Gods and crocodiles," she swore again, watching the massive reptile swim toward them.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Today we're going to talk about the character line-up for the next <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game release, </a><a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>.

              <p>Speaking of the Base Set, here's your first look at the finished box, which features an all-new cover painting by Wayne Reynolds.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              </div> 
              <p>On to the characters!</p> 
              <h2>Base Set</h2> 
              <p><b>Alain</b><br> Alain the cavalier makes his ACG debut in this set, and he comes to the party with a shocking lack of tragedy in his backstory. Alain is an entitled scion of nobility who grew to manhood entirely convinced of his own competence in all things. As a brash young man, Alain gathered whatever funds and personal effects he could carry. He then declared himself a sellsword, setting off for the "crimson poetry of the fray." Today, whether leading soldiers in a suicidal charge or booting serving girls out of his bed in the morning, Alain cares little about the people around him. More than money, love, or lust, Alain cares about his reputation. With every encounter, he strives to increase his own legend, whether as a scoundrel or saint. Perhaps the only creature he truly values is his horse, Donahan. Exceedingly well trained, and having accompanied Alain for longer than any of his human compatriots, Donahan represents everything Alain looks for in a partner: absolute loyalty, absolute trust, and absolute obedience. Donahan is a new type of card called a cohort—we'll explain how those work in an upcoming blog.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Alain.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Alain_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p><b>Balazar</b><br> Summoner Balazar and his eidolon Padrig make their debuts in Wrath of the Righteous. Balazar grew up in the magical academies of Quantium in Nex after that region's Arclords stole him from his family. More interested in pranks and anarchy than his studies, Balazar was inevitably expelled. He set off on the road to Ecanus, a city infamous for its twisted magical experiments. The masters of Ecanus sought one who could look into a rift known as the Void Chasm and maintain his sanity. As they forced the gnome to stare into the Void, he heard a voice. "I will help you," it said in reassuring tones. "Give me form and allow me to leave this prison, and you and I will become as one." Balazar imagined a huge snakelike creature with a beak, and Padrig took form. Now the gnome and his strange companion wander the world, having fun and causing trouble in equal measure. Like Alain's horse Donahan, Padrig is a cohort card.</p>

              </div> 
              <p><b>Enora</b><br> Enora the halfling arcanist makes her ACG debut in this set. She's motivated by a love of knowledge. Enora was a star student at the Occularium, a child of two professors at the august center of arcane learning. While performing field research in a half-flooded temple to Nethys, the god of magic, Enora uncovered a stone tablet that radiated a magical aura unlike anything she had ever encountered before. Touching her hand to the tablet flooded Enora's mind with magical revelations, knowledge beyond her wildest dreams, and a sense of a much vaster world of magical discovery than she had ever imagined. Today, Enora travels the Inner Sea searching for knowledge, be it secular or religious in nature.</p> 
              <p><b>Harsk</b><br> ACG fan-favorite Harsk returns for a third time! Few things made young Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand in southeastern Varisia with his crossbow, listening to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by. After the brutal slaughter of his brother by giants, however, Harsk's view of his place in the world changed. Now the dwarven ranger seeks to forever be the voice of justice in wild places, preserving nature's balance and preventing the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p> 
              <p><b>Imrijka</b><br> Imrijka the inquisitor makes her Adventure Card Game debut in Wrath of the Righteous. Half-orc orphans aren't a common sight in the church of Pharasma, goddess of fate and death, but Imrijka isn't a common half-orc. She wears a mysterious disk that might hold the key to the truth of her parentage. Taken in by the church's high exorcist and trained as an inquisitor, Imrijka brings judgment to all who would violate the laws of life and death. Imrijka's seen it all, and she faces the future with courage and faith.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              </div> 
              <p><b>Kyra</b><br> Kyra's third appearance in the Adventure Card Game pits her against demons and heretics, but facing off against long odds is nothing new to this cleric of Sarenrae. Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's shrines. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught, she decided to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors. On the smoking ruins of the shrine, she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae. She pledged to protect those who could not protect themselves, vowing not to spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p> 
              <p><b>Seelah</b><br> Fans of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous">RPG version of the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> will not be surprised to see our iconic paladin Seelah make her second appearance here. Seelah first encountered warriors in Iomedae's service in the town of Solku, where her family had fled after witnessing horrible atrocities in the land of Geb. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku from marauding gnolls, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor. Within an hour, she had stolen a particularly fine helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Days later, Seelah was wracked with guilt and horror as she saw the paladin whose helm she had stolen struck down by a blow to the head from a gnoll's flail. As penance, Seelah joined the knights of Iomedae, hoping to carry on the good work that the fallen paladin might have done. You'll note that one of Seelah's powers mentions the new Corrupted trait—we'll talk about that in an upcoming blog too!</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              </div> 
              <h2>Character Add-On Deck</h2> 
              <p><b>Adowyn</b><br> Adowyn the hunter and her wolf Leryn make their first appearance in Wrath of the Righteous. As a girl, Adowyn accompanied her father into the perilous Fangwood on a trading expedition. One night a diseased bear charged into their camp, savaging Adowyn's father before she could even cry out. Using the bow her father had carved for her, she sank arrow after arrow into the beast, tears streaming down her cheeks. At last, the bear fell. The creature was dead—but so was her father. Adowyn spent months in the blighted forest alone, mourning her father and learning to survive by wit and arrow. During her isolation, she rescued a lean gray wolf and nursed it back to health, giving it her father's name as a last measure of grief and farewell. Now Adowyn and Leryn wander the Inner Sea region as bounty hunters, searching fruitlessly for the mother she left behind. Leryn is a cohort card in Wrath.</p> 
              <p><b>Crowe</b><br> The Shoanti bloodrager Crowe debuts in Wrath of the Righteous. Crowe was born under an auspicious sign during a thunderstorm that scoured the Storval Plateau one burning autumn evening. As a youth, Crowe often got into fights and then claimed he didn't remember how the scraps had started. He would feel his heart beating against his ribs. He would hear the blood thrumming in his ears, and that would be the last thing he recalled. After these amnesiac rages took the lives of a dozen horses and several of his tribe members one night, Crowe set out on his own with only his rage, his shame, and the power of the storm that coursed through his blood to help him make his way.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Crowe.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6021-Crowe_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p><b>Seoni</b><br> Back by popular demand, Seoni makes her third appearance in this set. The tattooed sorceress has long wandered the world, though her goals remain a mystery. Seoni's runic tattoos play an influential role in her personality. Coming from a culture where tattoo magic maintains a strong following, hers are simultaneously a manifestation of her power and a tool to aid in her castings. The sheer number adorning her skin, as well as the similar patterns woven into her clothes, are a mark of status among her tribe, although many of the so-called "civilized" residents of Varisia look upon such body modification with distaste.</p> 
              <p><b>Shardra</b><br> Dwarven shaman Shardra Geltl makes her Adventure Card Game debut here. As she grew into adolescence, Shardra discovered that objects could speak to her. The voices of stone and wood kept her company when her outward existence became fraught. They taught her much about the stories and histories of her people. A fall while out walking brought Shardra into an ancient cavern. Her journey into that holy place began her lifelong friendship with a spirit creature resembling a tuatara, whom she named Kolo. With Kolo the crag tuatara at her shoulder, Shardra now wanders the world, uncovering lost treasure and listening to the tales it has to tell. Kolo is a cohort card in Wrath.</p>

           <p itemprop="description">Yesterday brought the sad news that our old colleague, Mike McArtor, had passed away. Mike joined the Paizo staff back in the "magazine days," as an editor on <a href="/dragon">Dragon Magazine</a>.

              <p itemprop="description">Yesterday brought the sad news that our old colleague, Mike McArtor, had passed away. Mike joined the Paizo staff back in the "magazine days," as an editor on <a href="/dragon">Dragon Magazine</a>.

We're a much larger, much different company than we were in those now nearly mythical magazine days, but we like to think Mike's spirit hung around and continued to influence the company years after he left.</p> 
              <p>In recent years, Mike was an editor for Magic: The Gathering at Wizards of the Coast. That kept him in the Seattle game professional orbit, and many of us found ourselves running into Mike again and again at public events and parties. He was always a warm, friendly guy, and it was fantastic to see him still working in the field, obviously loving his job.</p> 
              <p>News of Mike's death yesterday hit many of us hard, and it wasn't long before some of Mike's friends and former colleagues shared some remembrances of his time at Paizo and the quality of his character. (Or, in the case of a guy who went through at least four characters in our office Age of Worms campaign, the quality of several of his characters.)</p> 
              <p>Here are some of those remembrances:</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <h3>James Jacobs</h3> 
               <p>I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that Mike McArtor is gone. Been thinking back on all the antics and shenanigans we all got up to back in the early days of Paizo, and I realized that Mike was not only one of the first people I ever gamed with at Paizo after I started working here... he was also the first Paizo GM I ever had. His game was a crazy one—his only real rule was that none of the player characters could be humans, because in the campaign he wanted to run, the humans were the monsters. We all got to pretty much choose anything we wanted as far as our character's race, and he used various books and house rules to help us build the characters we thought up... pretty much anything and everything was on the table. Our group had, among others, an air elemental, an ogre mage, a gold dragon, and some sort of dwarfataur thing (part dwarf, part lion, part beard). My character was Torak, an awakened deinonychus who had hopes of some day growing himself a pair of wings so he could fly.</p> 
               <p>Mike was instrumental in helping us all make it through when we shifted away from the magazines and started working on our own brand of products for Paizo. He was one of the three folks who handled the module line and the campaign setting line in those days, and in fact he pretty much single-handedly got the first hardcover version of the <a href="/products/btpy84eo"><em>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</em></a> put together—he wrangled all the freelancers and handled much of the book's initial developing and editing. He also wrote <a href="/products/btpy85ed">the second installment of the Second Darkness Adventure Path</a>—you know, the one where you get trapped in a lighthouse that breaks off its foundation and rolls down a hill into the ocean, and oh yeah, the lighthouse is filled with alien dog monsters whose bite turns you into zombies?</p> 
               <p>But if there was one book I'd have to pick that Mike worked on as my personal favorite, that'd hands-down be the <a href="/products/btpy81xy"><em>Guide to Korvosa</em></a>. It's still one of my favorite books in the campaign setting line; the amount of details he packed into that thing were invaluable in helping me build the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path, and it's a book I still reference today whenever I'm looking at designing new cities for the setting. While the city of Korvosa itself is from my homebrew setting, and while I was originally the one who was going to write the book, it became quickly apparent that I wouldn't have time... and Mike brought things to Korvosa that I never would have imagined. Things that, today, are what Korvosa is all about. From the little things, like the names for coins or those fun little squabbles between imps and pseudodragons, all the way up to elements that have become defining and iconic staples of our campaign world, like the name Jeggare or the infernal-minded Acadamae itself.</p> 
               <p>After I heard the news that he'd passed away, I went looking through my computer for any pictures I had of Mike, and it was tough. He never did like his picture to be taken, and I mostly respected that by not taking many pictures of him... I kinda wish I'd taken more now though. The only two I found, though, sum up Mike perfectly.</p> 
               <p>He was cool, and he was just about one of the friendliest, most peaceful guys I've ever known.</p> 
               <p>So indeed, Mike, my friend.</p> 
               <p>Stay cool, and be at peace.</p> 
               <h3>F. Wesley Schneider</h3> 
               <p>Mike and I started at Paizo the same week in 2003, joining Dragon magazine as assistant editors. You couldn't have chosen two people with more diametrically opposed tastes. We didn't agree on much, but that can be a good thing more often than you might think—especially when it comes to telling stories. Mike edited the same articles as me for years. Every day I found pages covered with his blue notes on my desk, challenging my design, correcting my grammar, and suggesting that maybe my articles needed more obscure historical factoids... or ninjas... or gnomes. Usually gnomes.</p> 
               <p>Our birthdays were the same week, too. When I was new here, Mike guaranteed I never spent a birthday alone.</p> 
               <p>Mike's most of the reason I know anything about editing. He taught me to see the value in other people's passions. He baffled me with how he could make friends with anyone. He proved that no matter the game, you can always play a ninja. He forced me to accept that some people can wear Micky Mouse sweaters unironically. Even now, there's plenty I'd argue with him about, and I doubt either of us would ever budge. But, even so, for all the candid corrections, all the enthusiastic suggestions, all the contrary perspectives, and all the countless other ways he was an honest, accepting, loving guy, I'll always be grateful.</p> 
               <h3>Stephen Radney-Macfarland</h3> 
               <p>I never had the opportunity to work with Mike McArtor. I worked at Wizards while he was at Paizo, and I was at Paizo during his stint with Wizards. But I did game with him, and always enjoyed the way we played and sometimes clashed at the table. Over my many years of chucking dice and playing roles amid a pile of books and the scattering of miniatures, I've found you can learn the measure of a person by gaming with them on a regular basis. I can tell you that Mike was one of the kindest, most sincere, and generous people I have ever had the opportunity to know. I will always cherish the roles he played around the table and the life he lived. Goodbye, my friend. You are missed.</p> 
               <h3>Liz Courts</h3> 
               <p>Mike was a sensei. In the very earliest days when I stepped into the Paizo board community pool, he was a warm and inviting presence. While my first attempts to pitch an article to <a href="/dragon">Dragon Magazine</a> died when the license ended, he still encouraged me to continue writing, a bit of motivation that later led to the formation of the (now ENnie Award-winning)<a href="/companies/paizoFansUnited">Wayfinder</a> fanzine. Without him, the tongue-in-cheek appellation of "gninja" that I use to this day would not be a thing, and marks of his subtle touch are everywhere, in both Pathfinder and in the Paizo community. He is sorely missed.</p> 
               <h3>James L. Sutter</h3> 
               <p>Mike McArtor was one of the first friends I made at Paizo: a majestic Assistant Editor of <a href="/dragon">Dragon</a> who deigned to take notice of a lowly editorial intern. Early on, he did me two big favors: the first when he let me write a Class Act article—and the second when he quietly killed it rather than let me embarrass myself in front of the rest of the staff with my own ignorance.</p> 
               <p>As time went on and I joined the editorial team in earnest, Mike and I bonded over a lot of things. We co-wrote articles. We formed a writers group with James Jacobs to work on our fiction. We codified The Rule—Paizo's system for when to use numerals versus spelling out numbers—and posted it on a support pillar with all the ceremony of Martin Luther nailing The Ninety-Five Theses to a church door. (Many years and an office change later, it still hangs in the Editorial Pit.) He would teach me about game balance and grammar, and in exchange I would try to shock him with tales of bohemian adventures and advise him on how to talk to girls. It was a good system.</p> 
               <p>Something you need to understand about Mike was that he was, at heart, a paladin. Or maybe a samurai. The point is, he believed in being a Good Guy, and honestly lived according to a code of honor. He was nice to everybody, and if you were his friend, there was never any question that he'd be there for you.</p> 
               <p>But let's not make this too mushy. If anything, Paizo's editorial team was built on its sense of humor, and there were pranks galore in the early days. One of my favorite memories of Mike was when, due to scheduling conflicts, I had to drop out of Jason Bulmahn's Eberron game that we'd been in together for years. To have some fun with it, I secretly arranged with Jason to punk everyone by killing off my character (tellingly named "The Kid") in the most spectacular way possible. When the time came, halfway through the session, everyone was shocked as my character was reduced to smoldering ruin.</p> 
               <p>But none more so than Mike. After a heartfelt, Darth-Vader-esque "NOOOOOOOO!", he tried desperately to save me, only to fail at every turn. I think there were actually tears in his eyes as I cleaned up my dice and walked—apparently heartbroken—out of the game. It was some of my best acting, and when Jason and I revealed the next morning that it had all been a setup, folks had a good laugh.</p> 
               <p>Except for Mike, who missed the explanation, and who later tracked me down to offer earnest condolences and make sure I was all right. I felt like a total jerk explaining the truth (even though he agreed it was pretty funny), but it drove home what I already knew: that Mike was a thoughtful guy who legitimately cared about people.</p> 
               <p>Mike moved on from Paizo while Pathfinder was still in its infancy, but if you've ever run a game in Korvosa, or worshiped Shelyn, or fought dragons, or interacted with any of a thousand other elements he contributed to the game, then you've been touched by his creativity.</p> 
               <p>Thank you, Mike. It was a privilege to know you, and none of us would be where we are without you. And as was drunkenly pointed out at many a joint birthday party—you had a heart of gold.</p> 
               <h3>Jason Bulmahn</h3> 
               <p>Just over 10 years ago, I moved to Seattle and one of the first friends I made out here was Mike McArtor. Mike and I both worked on Dragon. Along with Wes we were the ones responsible for developing the entire magazine month after month.</p> 
               <p>Being gamers, I soon started up an office game set in Eberron and Mike was one of my players. A lot of friendships were forged around that table and Mike, with his easy smile and good nature, was a huge part of that. I also killed Mike's characters... a lot. Mike had a tendency to make characters that would rush headlong into danger and I ended up using his PC as the "example" of how hard core my game was on more than one occasion. Mike would always laugh when his character was mulched, disintegrated, or charred. He always had another ready for the next session.</p> 
               <p>Years later, we both played in the office Age of Worms playtest. Mike's first character was a mute ninja (Mike loved ninjas). I honestly can't remember how he died.. but I am sure it was "quietly". His second character was a druid that was killed by his own animal companion. His third was Frothlethimble, a murderous, backstabbing gnome.</p> 
               <p>How I hated that character. Mike loved to goad on my honorable dwarf with his nasally gnome voice. We had a damn fine time going back and forth threatening to kill one another. At one point I even forced a confrontation with the rest of the party over which one of us would stay. After that, Frothlethimble promised to kill me in my sleep. Gar (my dwarf) had heard enough. In the next fight, against a mindflayer, the entire party was stunned except Gar. After putting down the aberration, Gar turned to Frothlethimble and his axe swung one more time.</p> 
               <p>Its the only time I have ever intentionally killed a fellow PC.</p> 
               <p>Mike laughed and laughed. That is what I loved about Mike. He was kind, he was honest, and he was a good man. I will miss him.</p>

              <p>Monica first won over judges and voters with <a href="/threads/rzs2rrwd">a magic weapon</a> that helps a cleric aid her party members when they face off against incorporeal undead, an idea drawn from her own experience as a player.

              <p>With that to look forward to, let's also take a look at the upcoming scenarios—as well as two of the talkative personalities that appear this month. The first scenario, <a href="/products/btpy9am7"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–16: Scions of the Sky Key, Part 3: The Golden Guardian</em></a>, is the last installment of this Tier 1–5 series that has sent the PCs to Sargava's Bandu Hills and later to the Kaava Lands. Having acquired a powerful weapon, the PCs hope to incapacitate the legendary warden that watches over the dwarven ruins of Ashkurhall. Those who have played through <a href="/products/btpy9am4">the first part of the series</a> will no doubt encounter some familiar foes, and the author Mikko Kallio has done an excellent job of presenting these creatures by combining a few classic features with just as many very clever twists. All told, it's a thrilling conclusion to a very fun three-part series.</p> 
              <p>On a related note, Mikko is one of the three <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar</a> 2014 finalists as well as a judge for this year's contest. By the time this blog goes live, there's probably only a narrow window left to vote, but I strongly encourage you to at least check out the submissions from the various rounds—especially if you're interested in participating in the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/getInvolved">Pathfinder Society Open Call</a>.</p> 
              <p>The second scenario this month is <a href="/products/btpy9ch1"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–17: Fires of Karamoss</em></a>, which in a way is also part of a series. Really it's the spiritual successor of <a href="/products/btpy97n5">one of the season's first adventures</a>, in which the PCs explored part of the Red Redoubt of Karamoss, a siege fortress rife with advanced technology. It seems the earlier discoveries have uncovered a more sinister plot, and it's up to the PCs to delve deep into the tower's foundation to save a major find—if not Absalom itself! The author is one of Paizo's own: the talented <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgqu">Joe Homes</a>. Working only a few dozen feet away from an author makes it really easy to bounce ideas back and forth, and Joe really impressed me with his ability to introduce charming NPCs into what could have easily remained a straightforward dungeon crawl. The result is an exciting adventure with a healthy helping of both memorable roleplaying and engaging battles.</p>

               <p>When I first picked up <em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—Rise of the Runelords</em> I was extremely unsure that the kids would like it. We played 3 straight games and failed the first time on the Poison Pill scenario, then immediately replayed it and won quite easily. They are looking forward to the last scenario and then moving onto the next adventure shortly after.</p> 
               <p>Obviously these are our more experienced kids, though they are still young (aged 13, 13, and 15, respectively), but they grasped the issue of developing their decks to improve their chances in the game, making their character more versatile and mitigating character weaknesses. Also, it was good to see the way each character had a role to play in the game and prompted them to work as a team.</p> 
               <p>We started the <em>Reign of Winter</em> Adventure Path last Thursday with a slightly new group of kids, some of whom are straight out of the village in Northern Uganda. Putting them into a snow scenario was quite interesting and the session was quite enjoyable.</p> 
               <p>I am continuing <a href="/threads/rzs2r32h">my blog on the forums</a> and more people are following it these days. Also, we have had a generous number of Pathfinder Modules and other hardback materials donated by one of Paizo's writers, which we are shipping by container in May to Uganda.</p> 
               <p>Very best wishes,</p>

I can assure you, however, that the editors aren't about to go down without a fight, which is why we've hired a brand new word-warrior: editor Jason Keeley!</p> 
              <p>While I go secure the perimeter defenses, here's Jason to introduce himself:</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Hello! I'm Jason Keeley, the newest editor here at Paizo. I'm thrilled to be working with this group of talented people.</p> 
               <p>I was introduced to RPGs shortly after college. Before that, I had only played video games like Might &amp; Magic and Baldur's Gate, so I was familiar with the concept, but I didn't realize how quickly tabletop gaming would become such a huge part of my life. Soon after, I discovered Paizo through Dungeon magazine, and started running the Savage Tide Adventure Path. Many, many APs later (I even ran two at once!), I felt ready to begin contributing to the game I enjoyed so much. I contributed a short story and a monster to issues of <i>Wayfinder</i>, wrote a grimoire of spells for Fat Goblin Games' Vathak setting, and, most recently, made it to the top 16 of <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar 2015</a>. I would have liked to continue in the contest, but, as you can see, the Golem came calling for me!</p> 
               <p>Outside of Pathfinder-related material, I edit stories for the swords-and-sorcery e-zine <i>Worlds Without Master</i>, as well as function as the editor-in-chief of my own (small) imprint, Pantheon Press. Our flagship product, <i>Fortune's Fool</i>, a Tarot-based RPG, won a Judge's Choice ENnie in 2011!</p> 
               <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, all kinds of gaming, and looking at funny pictures on the internet. Especially funny pictures of dogs.</p> 
               <p>Jason Keeley<br> <i>Editor</i></p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>Please help us welcome Jason to Paizo! With any luck, he'll survive the initial skirmishes. (If the photo is any indication, he's clearly no stranger to international espionage...)</p>

               <h2>Chapter Two: The Pyre</h2> 
               <p>There were no animals.</p> 
               <p>Jiri could still hear them in the jungle all around, the birds, monkeys, and bats, but their familiar cries were all distant. Even more unsettling, no insects flashed iridescent in the thin sunbeams that filtered down through the canopy, or swirled around her, eager to feast on her blood or sweat.</p> 
               <p>Ever since she was old enough to walk, Jiri had been warned never to pass the statue of the Mango Woman.</p> 
               <p>What tainted aura warned the animals to stay away?</p> 
               <p>Whatever it was, it touched the plants, too. Around her, the undergrowth grew thinner, sparser. The ground beneath the trees finally turned into empty red earth, mottled with patches of gray. Scarred ground, burned ground. The trees that arched over them looked the same: Their bark looked charred, and their leaves curled in, tattered and black. Twisted, injured, dying, they clawed at the empty sky, and the mud steamed between their roots.</p> 
               <p>"There's something here."</p> 
               <p>Jiri barely breathed the words, but Oza caught them. The old shaman nodded, but his hand touched his mouth.</p> 
               <p>Jiri locked her teeth together. They were hunting, and she should be silent, but...It was in the ground, in the tortured trees, in the air: a smell like smoke, a faint brush of heat. Some spirit touched the world here, something old and terrible, and Jiri burned with its presence.</p> 
               <p>With a deep, silent breath, Jiri forced the feeling back, locked it down and drifted like a shadow behind her teacher as he stalked forward. Just ahead of them, past the crumbling corpses of a few more trees, the Pyre rose.</p> 
               <p>It stood in the middle of a small, shallow lake, the black water a still mirror that refused to reflect the clouds and sun overhead. The Pyre stood like a stony splinter in the water's dark eye, a jagged rock cracked and blackened, as if touched by some ancient inferno. Ashes crowned its shattered peak, and the air over them twisted with a shimmer of heat.</p> 
               <p>Jiri stared at that warped curtain and her concentration disintegrated.</p> 
               <p><i>Like flames, like...</i>In her head she saw fire and flame, dancing all around her. Tall and beautiful, and everything was turning to smoke and ash, burning and rising and whirling and going away, even the screams...</p> 
               <p>Oza's fingers pinched hard on her earlobe, and Jiri gasped into the palm of his other hand, the one he pressed against her lips. The shaman's dark eyes were inches from hers, blocking the Pyre, staring at her until she nodded. Then he slowly took his hands away. Angry at herself, Jiri looked past him at stone and ash and—</p> 
               <p>Jiri jerked her eyes away from the broken mirror of heat that hovered over those ashes. She didn't understand what it was that she had seen there, but she didn't want to see it again.</p> 
               <p><i>I don't.</i></p> 
               <p>Instead, she forced her eyes to trace over the fire-blackened cliff that the ashes rested on. Halfway up she found the door, the opening like a wound in the rock. The stone that had once covered it like a scar now lay in the water below, a slab the size of a hippo, and Jiri wondered how the intruders had moved it.</p> 
               <p><i>And how do we move it back?</i></p> 
               <p>Oza touched Jiri's hand, motioning for her to stay by the blackened trunk of the dead tree they had crept up behind. Then he stepped into the open and began to chant. Rough and low-pitched, the words scraped through the shaman's lips, a call to the bones of the earth.</p> 
               <p>They answered.</p> 
               <p>The ground shifted at the pool's edge, stone tearing through dirt skin. Oza's hands rose, and mud twisted like tendons around the rough rock, snapping it together into a crude parody of a man. An avalanche on thick legs, the elemental towered over them, staring down at the man who had called it into the world with gleaming eyes of gem. When Oza pointed, the earth spirit lurched into the water and splashed toward the Pyre, its rough hands reaching.</p> 
               <p>Stone ground against stone when the elemental grasped the great slab, and dirty water poured from its body as the rocks that formed it shifted. Slowly the earth spirit began to lift the massive boulder, scraping it against the Pyre's cliff face, until at last it raised it back into place, covering the door's dark opening. Jiri watched the stone man work, so tense with triumph that she almost missed it when the water behind the elemental began to swirl.</p> 
               <p>The thing broke the surface of the pool with a roar, sunlight flashing off slick green skin and black scales. Smaller than the elemental, but still much larger than Jiri, it looked like some hideous amalgamation of gorilla, crocodile, and toad. Lunging up, it dug great claws deep into the mud and stone flesh of the elemental. It pulled the giant back, and its teeth flashed. The sound of those great fangs scraping against stone tore the air like a shriek.</p> 
               <p><i>Not a beast, not a spirit—gods and ancestors, what </i>is<i> that thing? </i>Jiri was scrambling back, her spear up, a puny, useless threat raised between her and the monster.<i> And how can it smell so bad?</i></p> 
               <p>It reeked of stagnant water and dead things, rot and gangrene and something else, something acrid and bitter and unnatural. The smell made Jiri's stomach heave, her eyes run, and she had to wipe her tears away to see the thing snarl and attack again.</p> 
               <p>The monster's claws gouged deep into living earth as it pulled itself up, climbing the elemental. Lunging forward, it drove its fangs into the earth spirit's head. With a vicious twist of its neck, the scaly thing ripped the lumpy stone head free from the thick, muddy shoulders and spat it down into the dark water.</p> 
               <p>Terror and nausea tore through Jiri, but she held her place, not running. Forcing herself to look away from the battle, she found Oza. His eyes met hers, flashing with warning.</p> 
               <p>"They left us a demon, Jiri. Stay back, and be ready to run."</p> 
               <p>The shaman turned away from her before Jiri could answer that. His hand drew a circle over his head, and he shouted for the spirits of fire. A spark gathered in Oza's hand, grew bright and hot into a flame that shot away from him, toward the demon.</p> 
               <p>The fire twisted in the air, thickened, red flame taking the shape of a mamba racing with gaping jaws toward the demon that still had its claws deep in the elemental's stony back. As Oza's spell neared it, the stinking thing jerked its claws apart, making mud gout like black blood as it tore the earth-wrought spirit apart, roaring with triumph. Then the fire serpent slammed into it, and the roar into a howl. For a moment, the demon stood, a misshapen shadow wrapped in flame. Then it fell, vanishing beneath the dark water with a splash.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Firesoul-Jiri.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Firesoul-Jiri_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br>For Jiri, fire solves many problems.
               </div> 
               <p>"Is it—" Jiri started, eyes watering from the sickening smell of the demon, but Oza cut her off.</p> 
               <p>"No." His hands were moving, drawing jagged lines in the air as he called the spirits again.</p> 
               <p><i>He hasn't told me to run yet.</i></p> 
               <p>That was something, wasn't it? And before it had fallen, the elemental had shoved the stone back over the gap that had been opened in the Pyre. Jiri watched the dark water shimmer, and for the first time since the demon had surfaced she felt her own power, burning like a coal beneath the dead ashes of her fear.</p> 
               <p>Stepping from her hiding place, Jiri reached for the spirits. When she felt them answer, felt life and resilience boil into her, she moved forward and brushed her hand across her teacher's back, letting the power flow into him.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," Oza said, voice harsh with strain as he held tight to the magic the spirits had given him. "Now by all those who came before you, stand back."</p> 
               <p>For a moment Jiri didn't move, her hands hot with magic. But she couldn't disobey Oza. She took one step back, another, and then the water before them split.</p> 
               <p>The demon broke the surface roaring, claws reaching, eyes flashing hate and hunger. Oza roared back, cutting the air before him with his spear, and the water between the demon and the shaman shattered with spray. Vines exploded up, green and thick as a man's leg, twisting into knots around each other as they rose. Thorns covered the vines, long as spearpoints, and they scraped over the demon's hide as the great tangle surged over it.</p> 
               <p>Jiri felt anger and triumph burn through her, and without thinking she raised a hand. A flash of fire burst from her palm, striking the demon, barely singeing it.</p> 
               <p>"Back," Oza snapped again, and then he began to call out another summoning.</p> 
               <p>In the water, the demon tore at the vines. Thorns gouged it, but their sharp points couldn't penetrate its reeking hide. The demon ignored them, ripped one of its arms free, and lashed out.</p> 
               <p>Oza moved back, barely staying out of reach of those huge claws, and finished his call. The water behind the demon surged and swirled, roiled by the thing taking shape beneath its surface.</p> 
               <p>Rumbling something like a curse, the demon pulled itself free of the vines and lunged after Oza, claws spread. Jiri shouted and threw fire again, barely a spell, more her rage and fear flung out into the world to destroy. But her attack sizzled to nothing against the thing's slimy hide.</p> 
               <p>The demon swung its head and tiny crocodile eyes found Jiri. Its thin lips skinned back, showing its terrible teeth, and the monster hunched like a toad, ready to spring.</p> 
               <p>Jiri stared at the demon, knowing it was going to kill her, but she raised her spear and called for the spirits, determined to draw blood before she died.</p> 
               <p>Then the tentacles caught it.</p> 
               <p>Striking like snakes, they wrapped around the demon, a hundred suckers biting down. In the black water, the slimy, giant-eyed thing Oza had pulled from the spirit world clacked the beak that lay in the center of its nest of tentacles and jerked the demon back.</p> 
               <p>"Jiri, go." On the muddy bank, Oza was reaching for his necklace. "Run!" he shouted, and the word slipped into a roar as the shaman changed, grew claws and fangs and black-striped fur.</p> 
               <p>Jiri clutched her spear, paralyzed.</p> 
               <p><i>But we're winning.</i></p> 
               <p>Tentacles wrapped the demon, and the great tiger Oza had become slashed its claws between them, spilling stinking gouts of blood. If Jiri stayed—</p> 
               <p>The demon threw back its head, and roared a word.</p> 
               <p>The twisted, evil power of it broke the air. It tore through Jiri's body like poisoned hooks, filled her lungs like filthy water. The world shuddered around her, dimmed, and Jiri felt herself being ripped away, sent into darkness.</p> 
               <p><i>No.</i></p> 
               <p>She held on with all that she could, straining for light, for heat, for life, and suddenly she was back in her body, sprawled retching in the mud. Dully, she could see the demon, laughing as it tore limp tentacles off its hide. The massive tiger crouched before it, his gray-shot muzzle bent and dripping blood.</p> 
               <p>"Oza," Jiri groaned.</p> 
               <p>The cat raised his head and his eyes met Jiri's, old and stern. Then he turned and leapt at the monster, roaring, even as the demon wrapped its claws around him.</p> 
               <p>"Oza," Jiri said again, but she pulled herself up, made herself turn and stagger away, doing what those eyes had ordered her to do. Stumbling into a run, she whispered as she moved, begging the spirits to hide the tracks of her passage.</p> 
               <p>Running beneath the dead trees, Jiri tried not to listen to the booming laughter that echoed behind her, hideous and triumphant.</p>

You've made it clear that you want more, and we're happy to oblige.</p> 
              <p>This August, we'll begin new monthly Class Deck releases, starting with the <b>paladin</b> in August, the <b>monk</b> in September, and the <b>druid</b> in October. After we complete the 11 core classes with the <b>barbarian</b> in November, we'll begin exploring classes outside the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em>. As with the previous Class Decks, each deck contains 109 cards, including boons that can take your character from the start to the end of any Adventure Path. Meet Maznar, a character from the upcoming Druid Class Deck:</p>

              </div> 
              <p>Maznar is part of a small sect of dwarf druids revered by his people and by many inhabitants of wild places. He follows the Green Faith, a philosophy that commands respect for nature. Maznar draws on the power of his spells and his animal friends to protect himself and his party.</p> 
              <p>There's one big difference between the previous seven Class Decks and the new one. After hearing a lot of feedback, we decided to focus each new deck on three characters instead of four. This allows us to add more support for each character and her roles throughout her entire progression while continuing to bring you innovative character designs. <a href="/products/btpy9cu9">Pre-order the Paladin Class Deck today</a>! </p>

              <p>Today, I bring you a story sent to me from Paizo's co-recipient of the 2014 Volunteer of the Year award, campaign service award recipient, and England Venture-Captain Rob Silk. Here is his awesome write up.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <div class="blurb120">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20150316-Photo1.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20150316-Photo1_120.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>It's tough when you are far from home and you are running three games a day at a long games convention. The adventures run over time, and the next game slot draws nigh. All your players have rushed to the restaurant queue and it's a l-o-n-g queue. The food is expensive, and it doesn't look too healthy. A hardworking GM is a hungry bear!</p> 
               <p>You need "The Wyrd Sisters Kitchen." Over here in England, our GMs' welfare is often cared for by these two superwomen, Chris Brockley-Blatt and Carol Tierney. They set up a cook house on site and, for a very modest fee, GMs can subscribe to their between-game meals. The food is delicious, and the company is convivial. It's for "GMs only" so we can support each other with confidential moans and groans or tips and hints between the games. There is always time for a group hug, and no one goes away hungry. When it's really tough going and you just can't get away from the GM screen, they even deliver to your games table!</p> 
               <p>This has been a huge help in recruiting GMs because Pathfinder GMs are the only ones who can get this benefit. Many other games systems look jealously on while we go off to eat this lovely grub. We have a team of very happy healthy GMs thanks to these wonderful Wyrd Sisters. The original third "sister" was Tonya Woldridge, who was in right from the start but went on to Venture Captain in Canada. So you can imagine the calibre of these amazing lasses who are also our Venture Lieutenants and GMs, and who organise their own Pathfinder conventions and raise money for charity. We love 'em.</p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>Thanks for the write up, Rob! And thanks to Chris, Carol, and Tonya for your efforts to help make PFS awesome! I always enjoy hearing unique stories from the field and hope you do as well. If you have an interesting story from the field you think others would be interested in, please email it to me along with some photos.</p> 
              <p>Have a great gaming week and I look forward to reading other's comments about The Wyrd Sisters Kitchen.</p>

             <p class="date">Friday, March 13, 2015</p> 
             <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
              <p itemprop="description">We're just a few days away from next week's GAMA Trade Show, where I intend to show off about half of June's <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set for our <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line of prepainted plastic gaming figures. In preparation for that, WizKids sent us a very early production set of the figures, and I've got to say, I'm absolutely THRILLED with how this set has turned out!</p> 
              <p>For starters, the <a href="/products/btpy9bep">Gargantuan Red Dragon</a> limited edition "case incentive" figure is one of the best figures we've done to date, and easily ranks as my favorite <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> dragon thus far. From the moment I set the figure up in my office I've had a parade of Paizonians pounding on my door to get a closer look. It's phenomenal.</p> 
              <p>I'm also pleased with the general <i>utility</i> of the <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set. From "dungeon dressing" props like chests and braziers to enemies like four different gnoll figures, a large ooze, and dungeon critters like giant centipedes and beetles, I see the figures in this set hitting game tables again and again, which really excites me.</p> 
              <p>Here's an early look at three additional figures that I'm excited about, even more so now that I've got production-run samples in-hand.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Deinonychus.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Deinonychus_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>First up this week is the Deinonychus, a creepy little dinosaur from page 84 of the <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>. We're excited about this guy not just because he's a dinosaur, but because it's one of our first chances to create a feathered dinosaur more in fitting with modern science's understanding of how dinosaurs might actually have looked. As a common, Medium miniature, <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">case subscribers</a> can be sure to get a whole pack of them to menace their player characters.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Bat.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Bat_120.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>Previous animals like <a href="/products/btpy96r0">ravens</a>, <a href="/products/btpy96qy">falcons</a>, and even <a href="/products/btpy9aay">pigs</a> have proven popular additions to the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. Now that we're venturing into the dungeon, it's only fitting that we include the Bat in <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>. The Bat is a Small, common figure.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-GnollLeader.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-GnollLeader_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>I mentioned gnolls up above. This guy here, the Gnoll Leader, is perfect for the Big Boss of a gnoll encounter. His breastplate even has the symbol of the evil beast-god Rovagug printed on it. Awesome! The Gnoll Leader is a Medium, rare figure.</p> 
              <p>That's it for this week. Expect a bunch of cool photos to leak out of the GAMA Trade Show next week. I'll still be in Las Vegas next Friday, so there's a good chance those photos won't show up here until a week from next Friday, but keep your eyes on the Internet.</p> 
              <p>They'll be out there!</p>

              <p itemprop="description">You're playing Pathfinder on game night, and you're ready to add Syrinscape's custom-made Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPacks to the session. Simply follow these step-by-step instructions for bringing epic sound to your gaming table.</p> 
              <p><b>How do I prepare?</b></p> 
              <ul>
               <li>Download the <a href="http://syrinscape.com" target="_blank">Syrinscape Fantasy Player</a> for free.</li> 
               <li>Stock-up on custom-made <a href="https://store.syrinscape.com/subscriptions/1-adventure-path/" target="_blank">Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPacks</a>, created specifically for the Pathfinder RPG's most-popular Adventure Paths, and don't miss the official monster sounds created to bring the most horrific creatures of Golarion to life, in earth rumbling surround.</li> 
               <li><a href="https://store.syrinscape.com/account/login/?next=/account/campaigns/" target="_blank">Create your Sound Campaign</a>, where you can organize your sounds so everything you need for the session is right at your fingertips.</li>
              </ul> 
              <p><b>What audio equipment should I use?</b><br> You want the floors to rumble with those dragon roars, don't you? Syrinscape will work on any PC, MAC, Android Tablet or iPad, but to get the most out of Syrinscape's beautiful audio, we recommend plugging into a Surround Decoder via HDMI, or connecting to a portable Bluetooth speaker. Something with a crisp treble and a good dose of bass will really help maximize the impact of Syrinscape's immersive audio.</p> 
              <p><b>How easy is Syrinscape to work during the game?</b><br> Very easy! Let's say you're starting in a medieval town, because really, most proper Pathfinder adventures start there, right? Syrinscape has several town settings, such as "Brindol Town" or "Local Heroes" from the <a href="https://store.syrinscape.com/store/products/35-burnt-offerings-sound-pack/" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path Burnt Offerings SoundPack</em></a>. Once you've selected the town setting, you can choose your MOOD for different flavors of town life, such as Main Street, Market Street, and of course, a tavern. When you're ready to begin, simply touch the MOOD button, and Syrinscape takes care of the rest by gently fading up a highly realistic town ambience. Every now and then a cart might go past, or a hawker selling their wares might cry out, or the local bard might chime in with a tune every now and then. Syrinscape does all the work.</p> 
              <p><b>What next?</b><br> Syrinscape provides so much more to your gaming session than dynamic ambient <i>background</i> sounds. Are your players ready for the big dramatic reveal, like an epic dragon raid? Choose your dragon from the Syrinscape library, and when you're ready, touch the MOOD button to set off the chaos. It's best not to warn your players, so you get the maximum impact from the first terrifying roar!</p> 
              <p><b>Is that really all there is to it?</b><br> Yes! Adding the amazing Sounds of Syrinscape to your game is so easy! And just wait till you see the dropped jaws of your players when you surprise them with the incredible realism and immersion that Syrinscape brings to your Pathfinder game.</p>

             <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
              <p itemprop="description">"He's resting, although not comfortably," Chakori said. She'd taken Anandi into the foyer outside Ravi's room, although they left the door cracked open. "I've done what I can for him. The rest he's going to have to do on his own."</p> 
              <p>Anandi handed her another purse. </p> 
              <p>She tucked it away in her pocket. "Tell me again why you're going to such trouble over this one?"</p> 
              <p>"It's business. Besides, if I'd left him behind, he would have been killed." <i>And he still might, if the Maurya-Rahm find out what he told me.</i></p> 
              <p>"Do I sense your icy heart melting a little?"</p> 
              <p>He eyed her, discomfited by her bluntness. "A courtesan doesn't love. You know that."</p> 
              <p>"That's your own stupid rule. Besides, I never said you had to. It's just..." She gestured to her patient. "He's pretty. Or he will be, at least."</p> 
              <p>"He's a low-caste orphan, raised in filth. It doesn't matter whether he's pretty or not. He can't stay here." <i>Even if I weren't afraid for his life.</i></p> 
              <p>"You're just worried that the Maurya-Rahm will hear you're consorting with a pirate's brat, which will keep you on their bad side."</p> 
              <p>"Don't go there."</p> 
              <p>She just stared at him. "You're an intelligent, capable man, but you can be so damn blind, sometimes."</p> 
              <p>Before Anandi could think of a reply, she walked away.</p> 
              <p><i>Damn her. And damn Ravi. Once Asa answers my request...</i></p> 
              <p>Although there was no guarantee Asa would get his message at all.</p> 
              <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
              <p>Anandi was sitting at Ravi's bedside when the half-elf woke, none too happy to see him.</p> 
              <p>"Damn you." Ravi's expression was wild with hatred. "This ain't what I wanted. You didn't even <i>ask</i>. This is torture. The captain was never so cruel."</p> 
              <p>"He left you in that awful little cabin to lie in your own filth and then he let his crew treat you like an animal. Tell me, did you enjoy being used and ridden like a pony?"</p> 
              <p>"He didn't... they didn't... Damn you." Ravi clenched his jaw, anger mingled with grief. </p> 
              <p>"I plucked you out of hell and set you down in paradise."</p> 
              <p>"Some paradise, keeping me locked up in here. Get me some wine, at least."</p> 
              <p>"Not until you tell me who paid the captain to kill me."</p> 
              <p>Ravi laughed. "How the hell should I know?"</p> 
              <p>Anandi hadn't known anyone so frustrating other than the Maurya-Rahm. "You told me you did."</p> 
              <p> A bitter smile twisted Ravi's lips. "You brought me here for nothing, fancy man. Cap kept it a secret."</p> 
              <p>The nickname was growing irritating. So was Ravi's attitude. "My name is Anandi. You may address me as <i>Master</i> Anandi."</p> 
              <p>Ravi caught his wrist in a bruising grip. "Master of what?"</p> 
              <p>Taking a bit of enjoyment in his patient's discomfort, he said, "I'm an instructor of courtesans."</p> 
              <p>Ravi's face went slack. He sank back against the pillows, looking even more wan and exhausted. "I should have known what kind of a fancy man you were when you started feeling me up back there in that cave. Most men are rough, but you..."</p> 
              <p>"I'm not the kind that gets a man drunk and drugged in order to sleep with him. Neither do I beat him to make myself feel better."</p> 
              <p>"You're a self-righteous son of a bitch."</p> 
              <p>"And you're an annoying little bastard."</p> 
              <p>"Go to hell."</p> 
              <p>"You first."</p> 
              <p>Ravi threw a pillow at him, but missed. "I'm the captain's boy. Not yours. Take me home."</p> 
              <p>"He'll kill you. He tried, remember?"</p> 
              <p>"He was after you. Not me." A second pillow followed the first. This time, it hit Anandi on the shoulder. Ravi's laugh was bitter and chilling. "I know why you brought me. You just want the same as everyone else, <i>Master</i> Anandi. I've heard the whispers. You only got your position because you used to be—"</p> 
              <p> "Shut up." Anandi clenched a pillow, barely resisting the temptation to use it to smother the insolent youth.</p> 
              <p>Ravi's face tightened into a mask of hatred. "What are you waiting for?"</p> 
              <p>"For you to realize I'm not your enemy." He threw the pillow back at Ravi and stalked toward the door.</p> 
              <p>From behind him came the sound of either choked laughter or sobbing. Anandi didn't bother to see which it was.</p> 
              <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
              <p>Later that evening, Anandi had his answer from Asa.</p> 
              <p>"He will not see you, but he bade me give you this." The Maurya-Rahm handed him an envelope sealed with Asa's mark along with a small, silk-wrapped item.</p> 
              <p>Anandi waited until she left to open the envelope. The card inside was scented with Asa's favorite cologne.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p><i>Dearest Ari,<br> Your service to Jalmeray has not gone unnoticed. This is but a small token of my regard.</i></p> 
               <p style="text-align: right;"><i>A.</i></p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <div class="blurb360">
               <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DiamondInTheRough-Anandi.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DiamondInTheRough-Anandi_360.jpeg"></a>
               <br> <i>Anandi walks the razor's edge between love and politics.</i>
              </div> 
              <p>The terse, emotionless message in Asa's hand dashed the last of his hopes. Anandi opened the package. Inside the silken wrappings was a wooden box containing the dried fragile petals of a white flower, the kind found in the gardens near the thakur's palace. The two of them had spent hours there, laughing, talking, and making love. Once, Anandi had teasingly plucked a bloom and tucked it behind Asa's ear. </p> 
              <p>This, he was sure, was the same flower. He dumped the petals into his palm, heartbroken by the gift, and feeling whatever love he'd once had harden into an impenetrable ball. Anything he'd once shared with Asa was finally, definitely over.</p> 
              <p>He sank down onto his bed, suddenly exhausted. The trip had been a death sentence. That was all. Likely Asa hadn't even known he was gone.</p> 
              <p>A cramping pain shot through his hand and fingers. Anandi cursed and flexed his fingers, which were sluggish and slow to respond. Inspecting his hand, he saw that one of the petals had turned crimson around the edges. Anandi pushed it aside to see blood welling from a pinprick in his palm. <i>How...?</i></p> 
              <p>A sudden, agonizing pain lanced up his arm. A moment later, it receded and he drew in a shaky breath. His hand had gone numb and frozen in a fist that crushed the fragile petals.</p> 
              <p>Panicked, Anandi surged to his feet just as a new cramp flared through his chest, so excruciating it took his breath away. Whimpering in pain, he staggered into the hallway toward Ravi's room.</p> 
              <p><i>Oh, gods. Irori spare me. Why would Asa...</i></p> 
              <p>But Anandi knew his former lover too well. Asa would never poison him, but the other Maurya-Rahm would. </p> 
              <p>The guards took one look at him and paled. "Help..." Anandi croaked. One guard caught him as he collapsed. The other raced toward the healer's quarters. </p> 
              <p>The cramps came more frequently, jabbing at his gut. Numbness spread throughout his body until it was all he could do to keep breathing.</p> 
              <p>"Fancy man?"</p> 
              <p>Anandi could just make out a blurry figure crouched beside him. </p> 
              <p>Ravi took the guard's place and slapped Anandi's face, causing it to burn and sting. "Did you eat something? Touch something?"</p> 
              <p>"The box..." It would have been easy to conceal a needle.</p> 
              <p>Ravi pried the box from Anandi's hand and used the silken wrapping to hold it for inspection. "Damn."</p> 
              <p>Anandi couldn't answer. He could barely drag air into his uncooperative lungs.</p> 
              <p>Ravi set the box aside and laid Anandi flat on his back. "Breathe, damn it." He curled his fingers together, one hand atop the other, and placed the heel of his hand in the center of Anandi's chest. He pushed down. Hard.</p> 
              <p><i>Oh, hell, that hurts.</i></p> 
              <p>Ravi kept up the compressions. "Don't leave me here alone, you bastard. You owe me."</p> 
              <p>Anandi supposed he did, but it was a little late for that, now. Poor Ravi. The Conservatory would throw him into the streets if the Maurya-Rahm didn't kill him first.</p> 
              <p>Footsteps pounded down the hall. "What have you done, you filthy devil?" Chakori's sharp cry cut through Anandi's rapidly fading awareness. "After all he did for you..."</p> 
              <p>"I didn't!" Ravi protested. "I ain't the kind to poison a man!"</p> 
              <p><i>So what kind are you?</i> Anandi wondered as blackness swallowed him.</p> 
              <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
              <p>From the angle of the sunlight, it was late morning when Anandi woke. His aching body felt too heavy to move.</p> 
              <p>"Easy," Chakori said. She was sitting in a chair next to his bed. "I almost lost you. In fact, I would have, if it weren't for..." She nodded at Ravi, who hovered nearby, looking uncomfortable.</p> 
              <p>"Thanks." It wasn't enough, but he was too tired to say more. </p> 
              <p>"We know who did it. We traced her through her operative, and when she was interrogated, she panicked and tried to make a run for it. I don't know what kind of pressure the Maurya-Rahm who conducted the interrogation put her under, but she confessed to forging Asa's note and copying his seal in order to poison you. Seems she'd overheard Asa mention how much he missed your company, and given the success you've made of yourself at the Conservatory, decided to eliminate you before your influence grew any stronger. The Maurya-Rahm—how shall I put it?—have one fewer member in their prestigious ranks this morning."</p> 
              <p>Anandi winced. At least that meant Asa still cared about him. "Leave us," he said to Chakori. When she was gone, Anandi asked, "How...?" </p> 
              <p>Ravi shrugged. "Cap seen a lot of men stuck by a lionfish and taught me what to do."</p> 
              <p> "Why?"</p> 
              <p>Jaw set, Ravi said, "I ain't the kind to let a man die if I can help it. Even if it's a man that kidnapped me." After a while, he sighed and took the chair vacated by Chakori. "You were right about Cap, you know. I thought..."</p> 
              <p>"You thought he loved you." <i>Like Asa loved me until he couldn't and sent me away to keep me safe.</i></p> 
              <p>Ravi nodded and slumped in defeat. "What happens now? I ain't any use to you."</p> 
              <p>"Not true." Anandi gazed at the young half-elf, past the flushed face, seeing once again the inner strength and intelligence that had allowed Ravi to survive for so long. "You're my diamond in the rough. Once I get you cut and polished, you'll shine like few other men do."</p> 
              <p>As he'd hoped, Ravi's eyes glittered with desire. "Why me? Why not some other poor pirate's brat?"</p> 
              <p>"I'll show you."</p> 
              <p>He summoned a djinni who procured Ravi a set of silk pantaloons, a matching vest, and sandals. Ravi already had a gold hoop in his ear, which Anandi left, but he hung a thick gold chain around Ravi's neck. Then Anandi sat Ravi on a stool, had the djinni fetch his cosmetics with which he added color to Ravi's cheeks and eyes and drew long, intricate designs to highlight his features.</p> 
              <p>When he was done, he turned Ravi to face the mirror. "There. That's a man who can have anything in the world that he wants if he knows how to get it."</p> 
              <p>Ravi was silent for a long time as he stared at his reflection. "Like you? Do you have everything you want?"</p> 
              <p>"I did, once." </p> 
              <p>"And now?"</p> 
              <p>"Now..." he shrugged. He ached for Asa's touch, but it was gone, never to be his again. He took Ravi's hand in his. "Now I have a diamond. The question is, how brightly will you shine?"</p> 
              <p>"Brighter than all the stars in the sky," Ravi said, and squeezed.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Before I get into this week's blog, let me tell you the best thing that happened to me at a fantastic <a href="http://east.paxsite.com" target="_blank">PAX East</a>.

He "introduced himself," and then introduced me to Sarah, a self-proclaimed fan of my games. Jim then asked me if I had any promo cards.</p> 
              <p>"Oh, yeah," I said, "I wasn't going to give those out till my <a href="http://youtu.be/wnzBhWwx1nI" target="_blank">100 Games You Absolutely Must Know How to Play panel on Sunday</a>, but I think I've got one in my bag." And then I proceeded to fish around in my shoulder bag for at least a minute, unzipping every pocket and shuffling around every piece of paper, while Jim sweated out the delay.</p> 
              <p>"Oh, here's one!" I said after the agonizing wait, and gave them a card that Jim had created. This one was something special. He got down on one knee as she looked it over.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>I would be lying if I said Sarah said yes immediately. In fact, her brain locked up, discombobulated from all that was going on. But after a paralyzing few seconds, her mind re-engaged and she leapt into Jim's arms and said yes. And that is the best thing that happened to me at PAX East.</p> 
              <p>I bring up this story both because it's awesome and because Jim created his card on the <a href="http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder" target="_blank">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Community Card Creator</a>, a spiffy new tool from DriveThruCards that allows you to make your own cards for the game. I've seen lots of fans experimenting with it, so I thought I'd revisit some guidelines I use for making cards of similar power level and compatibility to the ones in the game. Note that not all the features of the card creator are live yet, so some of this won't work on the site today. But eventually, it all will, and you'll have this as a resource. I hope you find this useful as you make cards that work with ours!</p> 
              <h2>Brainstorming</h2> 
              <p>Start with a concept, such as "an underwater fortress," "a divine alchemist," or "a vampire monk." You can come up with something on your own, or take some inspiration from Paizo books, real-world concepts, or other universes. Just make sure it's something where you can say "I thought of something new, and here it is."</p> 
              <p>Then, for most types of cards, think of what adventure deck number that concept matches. If you imagine your concept as something only really powerful characters can deal with, then maybe a 5 or 6 is appropriate. If it's something that anyone can handle, use B or 1. This decision will affect several aspects of your cards.</p> 
              <p>Depending on what type of card you're creating, some additional guidelines might be useful.</p> 
              <h2>Banes</h2> 
              <p>Monsters and barriers should scale in difficulty against the ones in the box. For noncombat checks, a good baseline difficulty is 6 to 10 plus twice the adventure deck number. However, if you're aiming solely for a skill that isn't one of the big six (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), keep in mind that most characters will be rolling a d4. So keep the numbers low in that case, unless you really want only those who have the skill to succeed.</p> 
              <p>For combat checks, consider a difficulty of around 8 to 10 plus 2.5 or 3 times the adventure deck number. You can start adding monsters and barriers with multiple checks after adventure 3 or so. The powers should be reasonably simple through adventure 3, and then start getting more bizarre. If the powers usually reduce the character's ability to fight, such as by dealing damage before you act or by requiring multiple checks, you might want to reduce the difficulty by 2 to 5.</p> 
              <p>Henchmen should be tougher than the average monster you can imagine in your scenario, so increase the difficulties from the previous paragraph by an amount roughly equal to the adventure deck number. If you expect to want to use the henchman in multiple adventures, consider giving it the Veteran trait and a power that uses the adventure deck number. The henchman should always say it gives a chance to close the location, unless it doesn't.</p> 
              <p>Villains can have difficulties of as much as 10 higher than your average bane. They should always have something special about encountering them. When a villain shows up, everyone at the table should be invested in the outcome. Villain powers that scale with the number of characters present, the number of locations, or the number of open locations help reinforce this.</p> 
              <h2>Boons</h2> 
              <p>Boons should have checks to acquire in the neighborhood of 4 to 8 plus twice the adventure deck number. Watch out for boons that can only be acquired by skills that not all characters have. If a boon has a recharge check, aim for a difficulty 2 higher than the check to acquire.</p> 
              <p>Loot should be pretty darn awesome.</p> 
              <h2>Characters, Roles, and Tokens</h2> 
              <p>Characters should be tightly balanced against the ones in the box. Each character should start with 15 cards on her Card List. Add up the dice in your character's skills; if it's more than 42, you're probably aiming too high. The character should have no more than 1d12 in any skill. She should have 15 skill feat checkboxes, 10 card feat checkboxes, and 4 power feat checkboxes on her character card; no skill or card type should have more than 4 checkboxes.</p> 
              <p>Roles should have 12 power feat checkboxes each, including the 4 from the powers on the characters they advance. Save your craziest powers for the roles.</p> 
              <p>Tokens should tell intriguing backstories that make you want to play the characters again and again.</p> 
              <h2>Story Cards</h2> 
              <p>Adventure Paths list a set of at least 3 adventures. They should specify what happens to cards in the box as the adventure progresses. You can add adventure path powers that typically refer to things that happen between games.</p> 
              <p>Adventures need a set of scenarios, usually 3 or more. We recommend that you specify an play order, or it can be hard to keep track of which ones have been completed. Pick a reward that is on the level of "a card feat" or "a skill feat." As with adventure paths, if adventures have powers, they should not be of the kind that you must remember to consult frequently, because players will forget about them.</p> 
              <p>Scenarios generally need at least one villain and some henchmen that are appropriate for the power level of your characters. Powers can be simple or complex; think of something that sets your scenario apart from others and implement it. Your location list should have eight locations, unless you're doing something wacky. A standard scenario will have two more locations than you have players. Be careful when setting rewards; you don't want to give out too much for success. Make sure to put any lasting benefits in the Rewards section. You want people to be able to replay your scenario multiple times without skewing the rest of the campaign.</p> 
              <h2>Locations and Support Cards</h2> 
              <p>Locations should have fairly simple powers in each section. Watch the difficulty on noncombat checks to close locations, as these do not scale well. If you want a power that continues after closing, put it on the back as well.</p> 
              <p>Ships should have noncombat checks to defeat in the 6 to 12 range, and similar Craft checks to repair. Most have powers that make them harder to fight in the Encountering section, and they'll usually have a power in the Commanding section that allows you to discard cards from the blessings deck to trigger effects. You're looking for simple, frequently usable powers here, as you'll refer to them a lot during play.</p> 
              <p>As these new types of cards start to roll out for the <a href="http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder" target="_blank">Card Creator</a>, experiment with them and see what you come up with. And if you decide to make an Engagement Ring card, be aware that it might take me just a little while to find it in my bag.</p> 
              <p>And again, congratulations, Sarah and Jim!</p>

               <p>Some of you may recall <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5laj3">an upstart goblin poking around the Paizo offices some five years ago</a>, stealing ears and feeding the cave raptors. A goblin who vanished—under mysterious circumstances no less—after her ill-advised journey into the wildest depths of the warehouse.</p> 
               <p>That goblin was me. I have returned! Rejoice!</p> 
               <p>For those of you less versed in goblin lore: I am Crystal Frasier, author, illustrator, cartographer, and Paizo's newest assistant developer. What does an assistant developer do, you ask? That is an excellent question! I'm glad you asked! Moving on...</p> 
               <p>As I mentioned, I spent a fun five years working for Paizo as a production assistant and digital products assistant before leaving for a spell to make it on my own as a freelance writer, artist, and general awesome girl. But a freelancer's life is an isolated one, and without my shining smile to warm their days, Paizo employees began to wilt.* So for my own good and theirs, I have returned to beam my glorious radiance down. Also to develop books and edit statblocks—but mostly the beaming.</p> 
               <p>I've been gaming since the early nineties, when my love of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics lead me into the seedy world of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness roleplaying game. From this harmless gateway RPG, I explored Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Silver Age Sentinels, GURPS, West End's Star Wars, and eventually Pathfinder. In those few minutes a week when I'm not playing tabletop games, reading game manuals, running games, writing game material, or dreaming about running games for Hayley Atwell, I like to read comics, make candy, and walk my corgi, Calamity.</p> 
               <p>It's good to be back.</p> 
               <p>Someone's got to feed those cave raptors!</p>

              <p>I want to make sure we have our cover designs finalized for the Season 7 scenarios before they appear on the website with their own product pages, but I'm sure you would appreciate hearing little more about what's in store there.</p> 
              <ul>
               <li><strong><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7–01: "Between the Lines" (Tier 1–5)</em></strong>: Rival explorers have beaten the Pathfinders to a valuable site in Katapesh, but fortunately most of the riches—including the obscure text the Society sought in the first place—have ended up in the capitol's extensive bazaars. What is at first a routine shopping trip spirals out of control as the PCs uncover the writing's secret past—and secret messages.</li> 
               <li><strong><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7–02: "Six Seconds to Midnight" (Tier 3–7)</em></strong>: A strange confluence of circumstances leaves the researchers of Uringen understaffed and in need of able-bodied assistants. Conveniently, recent Pathfinder Society experiments call for a rare reagent found only in that area, and the two organizations have negotiated a mutually beneficial deal. Can the PCs reach the secluded settlement in time to witness this extraordinary event—and handle the phenomenon's aftermath?</li> 
               <li><strong><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7–03: "The Bronze House Reprisal" (Tier 5–9)</em></strong>: A recent assault on the Pathfinder Society has renewed hostilities with the Aspis Consortium, and clues left behind point to one of its masterminds: the gold agent Maiveer Sloan. By infiltrating one of the Consortium's artifact-smuggling operations, the PCs can sabotage their rivals' criminal operations and send a clear message: No attack will go unanswered. </li>
              </ul> 
              <p>There are lots of exciting adventures in the works!</p>

              <p>Up first is the Mad Prophet, a deranged gnome culled from the pages of the <a href="/products/btpy8v3a"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>. This maniac has my favorite eyes in the set since the <a href="/products/btpy9abc">Leaping Boggard</a> in <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><em>The Lost Coast</em></a> and I think he doubles easily for a fanatical gnome spellcaster player character (which is to say, "a" gnome spellcaster PC).

              <p>Speaking of short player character minis, here we have the Sundering Axe, one of my favorite female dwarf images in the <a href="/products/btpy8v3a"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>. The Sundering Axe is just as happy to flatten you with her hammer than to cleave you with her axe. Take your pick, orcs! The Sundering Axe is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
              <p>That's it for this week! I've got to ration these guys out, as it's a long time until June!</p>

               <p>Hi, everybody! My name is Linda Zayas-Palmer, and I'm the new assistant developer at Paizo. I'm so excited!</p> 
               <p>I've always enjoyed RPGs and reading fantasy novels. In 2008, when Mark Seifter asked me if I would be interested in joining his 3.5 game, I jumped at the chance to join my first campaign. Since then, I've played and GMed 3.5, FATE, Mutants and Masterminds, and, of course, primarily Pathfinder. After an Adventure Path and a half, the pile of supplemental stories and subsystems I'd been building finally grew large enough that I decided to write for people other than my gaming group, and started freelancing.</p> 
               <p>In addition to my home games, I've been quite active in Pathfinder Society. I was Venture Lieutenant of Boston, along with Mark, and I recently earned my 5th GM star. If you haven't already checked out your local Lodge, even if you think home games are more your style, give it a shot! PFS has a lot to offer.</p> 
               <p>Other than tabletop roleplaying games, I enjoy a variety of board and video games, as well as linguistics, math, singing, and teaching.</p>

            <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
             <p itemprop="description">An hour's walk took them to a small cave along the rocky shoreline, one exposed by the low tide and grown brown and slippery with algae. Anandi followed Ravi inside, careful of his footing. "Well?" he asked, impatient.</p> 
             <p>Instead of answering, Ravi curled his hand around the back of Anandi's neck and pulled him close. The kiss tasted of wine and pesh. Anandi let it last longer than he should have, surprised by how much he liked feeling the firm body pressed against his. Gently, Anandi pushed him back. "Is this your price?"</p> 
             <p>"I owe you for taking care of me."</p> 
             <p>"You owe me nothing."</p> 
             <p>"But..."</p> 
             <p>"Nothing. Understand?"</p> 
             <p>Ravi didn't. Anandi could see his confusion and wished he had a way to explain it better, but he didn't have time. <i>Two can play this game.</i> He cupped Ravi's face in his palms and kissed him. As he'd expected, Ravi sank into his arms, pliable as soft clay. Anandi was tender with him, working from his mouth to his neck and shoulders. Ravi tried to return the gestures, but Anandi nudged him against the wall and pinned him there, mindful of Ravi's bruises. Once he'd gotten Ravi properly aroused, he said, "The bottle isn't here, is it?"</p> 
             <p>Ravi froze. "No. It is. I swear."</p> 
             <p>"Where, then?"</p> 
             <p>"I can't tell you." Ravi turned his head to the side, cringing as if expecting a blow.</p> 
             <p><i>Gods grant me patience.</i> Anandi kissed him again, nibbling gently at his ear and neck. "I won't hurt you, and I promise I won't tell the captain."</p> 
             <p> For once, Anandi had cause to be glad of the pesh addiction. The effects were wearing off, which made Ravi's emotions unstable. He started to ramble. "He'll kill me if I tell. I wasn't supposed to see. It was an accident I came along in the first place. I followed them, because I thought it might be fun to... you know... out on the beach and all... but when Cap saw me, he gave me an awful beating. Said I was dead if I ever told."</p> 
             <p>"Now that wasn't very nice of him. If you tell me, I'll give you a treat." He ran a finger down Ravi's chest, stopping just below his navel. "Where's the bottle, Ravi?"</p> 
             <p>Trembling, Ravi jerked his head at the beach. "Out there near the water. It's in the tide pool."</p> 
             <p>"Show me."</p> 
             <p>Ravi led him unerringly to the aforementioned tide pool. Lying on his belly on the slick rocks, he fished in the water with his hand and soon drew out a lead casket sealed with wax. "In there." He slid it toward Anandi, then sat up with his knees pulled to his chest, rocking back and forth.</p> 
             <p>There weren't any sigils of warding on the box, but that didn't mean the lock wasn't spelled or set with a trap. Anandi spent a few moments inspecting the lock, then dug out a pick from his pouch and worked it open. Inside, nestled in a bed of silk, was the bottle. </p> 
             <p>As soon as he saw the plain-looking stopper, the hastily scratched runes and fresh wax on the seal, he knew why it had been so shoddily protected, and his heart sank. He glanced back at Ravi, wondering if he knew the truth or if he was being used once again.</p> 
             <p>Not wanting to draw suspicion, Anandi tucked the bottle into his purse, then hastily locked and resealed the box. He found the hiding place without too much difficulty. The tide was already coming in, which meant their tracks would soon be covered over.</p> 
             <p>"Thanks. I owe you," Anandi said. He pulled out a small purse of coins and tossed it to Ravi, even though he knew it would only be wasted on drink and drugs.</p> 
             <p>Ravi made no move to touch it. He sat gazing glumly out toward the water.</p> 
             <p><i>Damn it.</i> He hadn't meant to hurt the man's feelings. "Ravi? What's wrong?" </p> 
             <p>For a long time, Ravi was silent. Then his face crumpled. "I'm sorry."</p> 
             <p>"You haven't done anything that—"</p> 
             <p>"About them."</p> 
             <p>Anandi looked up the beach, where at least ten pirates were bearing down on them, fast. He was more than capable of using the sword buckled to his waist, but it wouldn't do much good when he was this outnumbered. Captain Maldak wasn't taking any chances. </p> 
             <p>"Why?" Anandi asked.</p> 
             <p>"Because Cap and I got paid to set you up."</p> 
             <p><i>Figures. The Maurya-Rahm probably sent me over here knowing I'd get killed, and this way they could tell Asa I'd gotten myself into trouble.</i> "By whom?"</p> 
             <p>"I just did what Cap told me."</p> 
             <p>Anandi yanked the half-elf to his feet and set a dagger to his throat. Ravi was dazed, giggling as he saw his pirate friends with swords and knives drawn. With a sickening feeling, Anandi guessed it wasn't the first time Ravi had been used as a bartering chip. </p> 
             <p>"Touch me, and I'll kill him," Anandi told the captain.</p> 
             <div class="blurb360">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DiamondInTheRough-CaptainMalthak.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-DiamondInTheRough-CaptainMalthak_360.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>Captain Maldak never passes up an opportunity to make some gold.</i>
             </div> 
             <p>Maldak waved his men to halt, then shrugged. "He's of no more use to me."</p> 
             <p>"Liar!" Ravi shouted back. "You need me."</p> 
             <p>"There are always more whores, boy."</p> 
             <p>Ravi let out a screech of anguish that burned Anandi's ears. "Come on," he told Ravi. He grabbed the half-elf's wrist and hauled him up the slope that rose to the old city.</p> 
             <p>Once in the streets, Anandi grabbed Ravi's wrist and hung on as he dodged past vendors, drunkards, and traders. He kept the western side of the island in sight. Beyond the crumbling city's wall were the cane fields, now neglected and overrun. Anandi dragged Ravi toward them. "In there. Give me any trouble, and I'll stab you in the gut." Hopefully it wouldn't come to that. He didn't want to harm the half-elf, and injuring him would only slow their progress.</p> 
             <p>The threat worked, however, as did Anandi's dagger-tip lightly pressed against Ravi's spine. Anandi didn't let up as they ran blindly through the tall cane and hoped like hell the pirates wouldn't be able to track them. </p> 
             <p>"Let me go. I'll kill that son of a bitch. I'll kill him. He promised. He promised..."</p> 
             <p>Whatever the captain had promised, Anandi didn't find out. Ravi broke down sobbing, tears and snot streaming down his face. The only benefit was that his anger gave him speed, and he ran hard, heedless of where he was going. </p> 
             <p>Anandi herded him to the coast, where he called the two djinn that he'd left there when he'd arrived. Ravi dropped in the dirt, his face a mask of fury.</p> 
             <p>The pirates weren't far behind. Ravi looked over his shoulder, saw them, and rose shakily to his feet.</p> 
             <p><i>Ravi will die if he goes back to them. But I can't take him back to the Conservatory...</i></p> 
             <p>Maldak was nearly upon them, sword aimed straight at Ravi's heart.</p> 
             <p>Anandi shoved Ravi at the nearest djinni. "Get us out of here."</p> 
             <p>The djinn obeyed without question, lifting both him and Ravi and whisking them across the sea toward the safety of Grand Sarret. The rush of air didn't cool Ravi's fury. Almost immediately he started wriggling and trying to escape. When that failed, he settled for clawing at the djinni's arms and cursing loudly. Their landing in the courtyard of the Conservatory attracted attention from a number of people, many of whom grumbled about being disturbed by such racket. Anandi was glad to see Chakori, one of the resident healers, in the crowd.</p> 
             <p>"I need you," Anandi said, guiding her, Ravi, and the djinni still holding him to one of the spare rooms in the courtesans' building.</p> 
             <p>It took two soldiers and a djinni to hold Ravi still long enough for Chakori to tend to him. Even so, he wriggled and thrashed as she forced him to open his mouth and drink the tincture. She gave Anandi a dark look that said, You owe me.</p> 
             <p>A light tinkling of bells alerted him to another visitor. Damn. There was nothing he hated more than the thakur's insipid little advisors trying to coax information out of him. "His Eminence would like a report of your journey," said this one, a woman whose name he couldn't remember. </p> 
             <p>They always invoked the thakur's name, even when Anandi knew for certain the thakur didn't give a damn what was going on. "Here." He turned his back to everyone in the room but the advisor and took out the bottle. "We damn near got killed getting it for you."</p> 
             <p>He watched her face, searching for the slightest hint of betrayal, but her expression showed nothing beyond banal gratitude. "Excellent. I'm sure His Eminence will reward you for your efforts." She took the bottle, wrapped it in a cloth, and tucked it away in a pouch at her waist. </p> 
             <p>"Tell Asa I want to see him. Please."</p> 
             <p>"I'll take that under advisement," she said.</p> 
             <p>"<i>Tell</i> him." He handed her a heavy purse.</p> 
             <p>She nodded. "I will do my best. But tell me, what reason did you have to bring that with you?" She jerked her pretty chin at the unkempt figure on the bed.</p> 
             <p>"There's no one better to ask about the pirates. Trust me."</p> 
             <p>She raised an eyebrow. "The Conservatory isn't the place to keep that sort of rubbish. His Eminence will be most displeased."</p> 
             <p>Which meant the Maurya-Rahm did not approve. Anandi wondered if he'd just earned himself another attempt on either his life or Ravi's. "He won't be here for long. I'm only keeping him to answer a few questions on subjects that might prove of interest to the thakur. I'll send you a full report, of course."</p> 
             <p>"Of course." To his relief, she left him in peace. The two guards remained nearby, and the djinni aided Chakori, fetching cloths and bowls of ointments.</p> 
             <p>At last the healer came over to him, scowling. "That's a right little bastard you have in there. No manners at all. Where did you find him? In a slave's galley?"</p> 
             <p>"Close to it," Anandi admitted. "He was a pirate's boy. How is he?"</p> 
             <p>She shrugged. "Going without that damned drug is doing a number on him. There's not much I can do, and in my experience, it's better to let them suffer a little so they can learn. Make it too easy, and they'll go right back to pesh the first chance they get."</p> 
             <p>"What else?"</p> 
             <p>"I'm not going to bother telling you everything I found. You can probably guess. I will say that he's now clean and I mended as many of his bumps and bruises as I could. Other than that, he's malnourished and dehydrated, and he's going to get worse before he gets better."</p> 
             <p>"Thank you," Anandi said, and handed her a small purse for her troubles.</p> 
             <p>"That's all?"</p> 
             <p>He kissed her cheek. "I'll see you later."</p> 
             <p>"You'd better."</p> 
             <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
             <p>"You bastard. Why the hell am I here? What do you want from me?" Ravi paced the room like a wild thing in a cage, circling round and round. "I'm not going to tell you a damn thing. Take me home."</p> 
             <p>Anandi sat calmly in a chair near the door, having sent the guards to stand outside. They were there to protect Ravi as much as to protect others from him, but no need to make the young man any more nervous by telling him that. "If I take you home, they'll kill us both."</p> 
             <p>"You don't know them like I do. All it'll take is a little sweet-talking and I'll be back in their good graces. I've done it before."</p> 
             <p>"You mean, you'll be back in their beds."</p> 
             <p>Ravi shot him a dirty look and kept walking. "It's the best place to knife them while they sleep."</p> 
             <p>Anandi had patience. It was only a matter of time before the Ravi exhausted himself. The djinni hovered nearby, serenely watching half-elf's agitated movements, alert for any request. </p> 
             <p>An hour passed. Desperation replaced the anger in Ravi's expression. "I need some pesh. I'll do whatever you want. Just... <i>please</i>." </p> 
             <p>"You're not getting any more pesh. Ever."</p> 
             <p>Ravi snarled and tore at the bedclothes, flinging pillows, sheets, and comforter to the floor. Then, with a show of strength, he ripped off the mattress and sent it hurtling against the wall. The effort tired him. He doubled over, panting and trembling while the djinni remade the bed.</p> 
             <p>After two more hours, the pleading grew more frantic. He knelt beside Anandi's chair and clawed at Anandi's pants. "I need some pesh. Please. If you don't give it to me, I'm going to die."</p> 
             <p>"You're not going to die. I promise you that." He gripped Ravi's chin and forced him to look into his eyes. "Hear me? I won't let you die. I need your help."</p> 
             <p>Ravi laughed, a hollow, depressing sound. "There's only one thing people need my help for." He broke away and resumed his pacing. He shivered and chafed his arms. "It's freezing in here."</p> 
             <p>Anandi found the temperature quite pleasant, almost too warm, but recognized the symptoms of withdrawal. "I'll get you a blanket."</p> 
             <p>"You can get me some pesh or a bottle of wine, at least."</p> 
             <p>"No." Anandi gestured to the djinni, who magicked a blanket into existence and draped it around Ravi's shoulders. Ravi tossed it aside. "It itches." </p> 
             <p>By nightfall, Ravi had slumped against the bed and was shivering uncontrollably. Again, the djinni covered him with the blanket. This time, Ravi left it where it was. "Please," he begged, though his voice was hoarse now. "I don't want to die."</p> 
             <p> "Come on. Into bed." He went to help the youth up. Ravi shook so badly he could barely stand. Even so, he jerked away from Anandi's touch.</p> 
             <p>"Easy," Anandi said, gripping his arms and setting him on the bed. Hoping Ravi had been broken down enough to answer, he asked, "Who paid off your captain to have me killed?"</p> 
             <p>"Will you get me some pesh?" He was childlike now.</p> 
             <p>Anandi hated himself for lying. "If you tell me the truth. Who was it?"</p> 
             <p>"I..."</p> 
             <p>But it was too late. Ravi's eyes rolled back and he convulsed in Anandi's arms.</p>

             <p>One more challenge remains to determine which of our finalists shall claim that grand prize, and it comes in two parts. First, each contestant must send a short pitch for their adventure idea to James Jacobs and myself to ensure the basic concept is something Paizo can publish. Once their pitches are approved, they must create a full adventure proposal, up to 3,000 words, to be judged and voted on.</p> 
             <p>Because this is the largest challenge of the contest, and they have to get approval before proceeding, we're giving our final four a bit more time than previous rounds. They have until 2:00 PM Pacific time on Friday, March 13th, to turn in their proposals. Each must be for a 32-40 page adventure for 5th level characters, set in Nar-Voth. Hopefully that allows the contestants to use the research they've done for rounds 3 and 4, so they can take the entire time from now until March 13th to craft and hone their perfect proposals.</p> 
             <p>Also, if you didn't have a chance to catch it this past Saturday, our Top 8 were featured in a Know Direction podcast. <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2015/03/know-direction-rpg-superstar-2015-special-bonus-edition/">Check out their interviews here!</a></p> 
             <p>It's been a great contest so far, and I hope everyone will join me in congratulating the final four on their success making it to the final round, and thank all our contestants for the fabulous work and ideas they've provided us throughout the previous challenges.</p>

             <p>Anyway, I'm really excited for you to play these scenarios and I'm really excited to be done writing blogs for a while. Like, so glad that I don't remember that there's a blog to write until the night before I have to hand it over. Zomg, editors who deal with me are the best people ever. EVER. Anyway, this is my last chance to make you all read about a bunch of nonsense mixed in with some useful info about Skull &amp; Shackles. These are the things you need to know about RIGHT MEOW that may or may not be related to the game in any way.</p> 
             <ol>
              <li>Mangroves: These are the most amazing and remarkable plants. They do so much for our world and have been getting destroyed at an alarming rate. Seriously, learn about them and help protect them.</li> 
              <li><a href="http://FunnyOrDie.com/m/9i20" target="_blank">This video</a> of Billy Eichner, Michelle Obama, and Big Bird.</li> 
              <li><a href="http://gamestorm.org" target="_blank">GameStorm</a>: Some number of us (including me) will be at this convention in the middle of March. Come see us and play games!</li>
             </ol> 
             <p>All right, now that that's out of my system, let's get into the part where I talk about the game.</p> 
             <h2>OSS (Obligatory Shark Section)</h2> 
             <p>We now live in a post-Left Shark world. If you didn't watch the Superb Owl (bwahahaha, I'm such a hoot!) and also didn't watch the halftime show (which was a hoot-and-a-half!) and somehow you live under a gigantic rock and missed out on the whole Left Shark phenomenon, let me teach you about that.</p> 
             <p>This is the video of <a href="http://dailymotion.com/video/x2g6jpw" target="_blank">the whole show</a>. Now, if you're smart, you'll just watch the whole thing. But if you're pressed for time you can skip ahead to 4:23. And bask in the glory of the sharks. BASK, I SAY! Anyway, this caused me to purchase some cookie cutters and learn that I am as bad at frosting cookies as Left Shark is at memorizing dance sequences.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150303-Cookies.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150303-Cookies_360.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>After I made three abominations, I decided an eye and a frown were enough frosting.</i>
             </div> 
             <p>But anyway, we now live in a world that has seen the glory of the Left Shark and because of that (and because last time you didn't get a shark in the shark section) consider this an Obligatory Super Sized Shark Section! OSSSS!</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-WeresharkPirate.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-WeresharkPirate_180.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>Is it a man? Is it a shark? EVEN BETTER, IT'S BOTH!</i>
             </div> 
             <p>It's a Wereshark Pirate. Is this not the best? Well, I guess it's not the best if you aren't ready for a fight. You can't evade Wereshark Pirates, and if the top card of the blessings discard pile <i>isn't</i> a Blessing of the Gods, well, you can kiss that 26 goodbye because now it's a 32. Whoa. You also better have your buckles swashed because if your check to defeat doesn't have the Swashbuckling trait, the Wereshark Pirate won't be impressed with you and he'll knock the top card off the blessings deck. Not cool, brah.</p> 
             <p>And if that wasn't enough shark for you... here's another!</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-HorrusRiptooth.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-HorrusRiptooth_180.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>RWARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRCHOMP</i>
             </div> 
             <p>I could hear you guys through the Internet before I even finished writing this and I know half of you were like, "Bawbawbaw, the Wereshark Pirate is too easy" and so I got you this. Good old Cap'n Riptooth. Like the normal Wereshark Pirate, he cannot be evaded and if the top card of the blessings discard pile is not a Blessing of the Gods, the difficulty is increased by 6. So, that could bump him from a 28 then 32, to a 34 then 38. THEN. Did you see that "then"?! DID YOU? Well, it's there. Anyway, there's that. And then there's also that last power. "Before attempting each check, randomly choose another character at your location" is almost never the start of something good. Maybe this time you'll be lucky and that will end with "to recharge a card from their discard pile." Except you aren't lucky and that doesn't happen. What actually happens is that the chosen character recharges a card and their Strength die is the amount by which you increase the difficulty of the first check against ol' Rippy—pardon me, Cap'n Rippy—as he picks up that character and bashes him into you. And then you do that again for the second check. Best case scenario, nobody is there and nothing happens. Worst case scenario, you're standing next to Oloch and the difficulty is increased by d12. Oofda. Of course, maybe Oloch is standing next to you and you're Lem and Oloch can take on one of these checks and only add d4 points of Lem-bashing. Still, that's a whole lotta nonsense, isn't it? Good luck!</p> 
             <p>Ok, for the two of you out there who still feel like this shark section isn't super sized enough, maybe this will convince you.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Lusca.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Lusca_180.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>YOU get a shark head, and YOU get a shark head, and YOU GET A SHARK HEAD!</i>
             </div> 
             <p>It's less scary if it feels like Oprah is giving you the shark heads, right? I don't think she can do anything about the tentacles, though. Anyway, this is a Lusca. It comes with three checks. THREE. And boy is it a real jerk if it is undefeated. Everybody at your location gets damage and then (there's that pesky "then" again!) everybody better make a Constitution or Fortitude 11 check, which should totally be easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy because this is Adventure 6, or bury 1d4 cards from the top of his or her deck. Yipes. I hope you put your shark-beating pants on this morning.</p>

             <p>This set has more ridiculous things than a Lusca has heads and tentacles. Seriously, trying to narrow down cards to show you is harder here than it has ever been before. So I'm going to show you one scary thing and one happy thing. Scary first.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Brinebones.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Brinebones_180.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>Dear reader, meet Brinebones. Brinebones, meet your snack.</i>
             </div> 
             <p>I love Brinebones. I don't think he counts as a scary thing to show you but that's because he and I are pals. And I'm totally sane. At any rate, he's kind of terrifying. 32 then 32 is no joke. And neither are those immunities. Least jokey of all is the damage he is going to deal to characters at the randomly occupied location that get chosen. You want to know the real reason Brinebones zaps you? He just wants to give you a little jolt that makes you all jittery. That way, when he actually gets around to eating you, you're all spazzy in his mouth like Pop Rocks. True story.</p> 
             <p>And now for the happy!</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-BabyTriceratops.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-BabyTriceratops_180.jpeg"></a>

             </div> 
             <p>This wonderful little Baby Triceratops, who I have named Clompykins, just galumphs around giving you 3d6 to combat checks during an exploration. And then everybody at your location buries a card because THEY CAN'T HANDLE THE GALUMPH! Anyway, if you can't figure out that Clompykins is crazy useful when you know that a multi-check monster is ahead, then you don't deserve him. He'll stay with me. Clompykins likes me best anyway.</p> 
             <h2>Scenario Learning Time!</h2> 
             <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-FromHellsHeart1.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-FromHellsHeart1_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-FromHellsHeart2.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-FromHellsHeart2_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-InsideLucrehold1.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-InsideLucrehold1_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-InsideLucrehold2.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-InsideLucrehold2_180.jpeg"></a> 
             </div> 
             <p>Here we are in the penultimate scenario of Skull &amp; Shackles. You have no idea how much I wanted to show you what was in store for you in "Last Stand of the Hurricane King" but I really think it's important for you to be scared and excited and all the emotions when you open the box at home. So, again, penultimate scenario. This is a good one to show you though. You've already met Brinebones who plays an exciting role here. Before we get back to him, let's introduce you to my favorite lounge band, Tsadok Goldtooth and the Draugr Captains!</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Goldtooth.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Goldtooth_180.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>He may be a half-orc barbarian pirate, but he sure is a sharp-dressed one!</i>
             </div> 
             <p>Mr. Goldtooth is not here to make friends or help people. In fact, before anything else happens, two of the characters at your location are going to be dealt 1d4+1 Ranged Combat damage. This is a lot more fun if there's a group of you and you're all bunched together because let's face it, when there are two or fewer of you, "two random characters" becomes a whole lot less random. And don't even think about using your spells on him, as that Arcane and Divine stuff is just a nuisance to him and makes everything more difficult. And of course, whether not you succeed at those two checks to defeat, he's going to pick two more random people to deal some Ranged Combat damage to.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-DraugrCaptain.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-DraugrCaptain_180.jpeg"></a>
              <br> <i>At least this guy only has one check to defeat?</i>
             </div> 
             <p>Remember how you're really good at this game and you got yourself a perfect hand for dealing with big fights? Well, the Draugr Captain doesn't. You can just go ahead and recharge all but one of those perfect cards and draw as many as you recharged. Now, instead of that hand that you knew exactly how to use, you've got a bunch of cards you didn't plan on having. Unless of course you didn't have any cards left in your deck. Then you'll just draw all the cards you recharged. That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for you. (Pro-tip: It probably doesn't, but good for you with that high-risk, high-reward craziness!)</p> 
             <p>Now, I know you're thinking that dealing with Tsadok Goldtooth and the Draugr Captains seems pretty straightforward. And some of you probably thought, "That sounds easy" which is why we are BRINGING THE WRATH OF BRINEBONES DOWN UPON YOU. You won't know when and you won't know where.</p> 
             <p>That's right, while you're busy trying to close locations and corner the villain, Brinebones is lurking inside the blessings deck. He could show up at any time and there's no limit to how many times he might show up. Brinebones has an all-access pass to watching you fumble around trying to shank Tsadok Goldtooth. Isn't it terrifying to know that on any turn it doesn't matter where you are or what you have in your hand because Brinebones might show up and turn you into his latest round of Pop Rocks? I think it's glorious.</p> 
             <p>I think this is a good place to end this blog. It's been a pleasure writing for all of you and I hope that the end of Skull &amp; Shackles is as fun for you to play as it was for us to write!</p> 
             <p>May the winds blow favorably upon you!</p>

             </div> 
             <p>In the meantime, I am excited about the recently-released February scenarios for <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a>. This month was a little strange because both adventures are Tier 1–5, but that's mostly because I'm saving some of the higher-level adventures for later in the season when we resolve some other pieces of the Sky Key story. Several months ago, I also took a long hard look at how Gen Con's earlier date this year (July 30–Aug 2) would affect the Season 6 schedule. The Pathfinder Society team decided that the cleanest way to handle this would be to make the Year of the Sky Key shorter by a month and start Season 7 a month early. The result is a slightly compressed season in which you'll see a lot of plot coming together in the final six months and a slightly smaller number of scenarios per season (but not per year). The last standard scenario for Season 6 will be #6–23, plus several Special events released at <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> and Gen Con.</p> 
             <p>Now that we've talked a bit about the big picture, let's look at some of these recent releases. <a href="/products/btpy9am6"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–14: Scions of the Sky Key, Part 2: Kaava Quarry</em></a> is the second installment in a three-part series that takes the Pathfinders to northern Sargava and (in this adventure) a fun stretch of jungle in the southwest Mwangi Expanse. Author Mike Kimmel was one of the three <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar</a> 2014 finalists, and I think it's fair to say he had the most open-ended outline of the trio. I received a really fun proposal a few days later, and the result is a giant dinosaur on the cover of a Tier 1–5 scenario and one of my favorite encounters of the year. The PCs are going to need some help, so today I've included an illustration of one of the first acquaintances they meet upon entering the Kaava Lands.</p> 
             <p>I am also very excited about <a href="/products/btpy9ch0"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–15: The Overflow Archives</em></a>, written by Scott Sharplin. I first learned of Scott when speaking with a few freelancers at PaizoCon, and like the professional that he is, he had an Open Call submission waiting in my inbox soon after I got back in the office. You may already be familiar with his work in <a href="/products/btpy98nh"><em>The Silverhex Chronicles</em></a> (namely Mists and Mausoleum), and when the schedule had an opening for a low-level adventure tied to the Dark Archive, I asked Scott if he would be interested in turning his Open Call piece into a full scenario. The final adventure is unlike anything published in the campaign to date, and it's a delightful yet whimsically dark story that takes the PCs deep into one of the Grand Lodge's more notorious vaults. Just to give you a sense of the strangeness within, I present the Owl and the Albatross, two figures featured in the story within a story.</p>
