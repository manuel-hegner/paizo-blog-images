  \    <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <h2>OPM Musings</h2> \n      <p\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">With two online conventions under our belt, we’ve got\
  \ our processes down. That being said, there are still several more in the pipeline\
  \ – Virtually Expo (to replace UK Games Expo) and Gen Con being the next on the\
  \ horizon. Besides conventions, we have lots more going on in the OP realm, so I’\
  m going to end my musings with a huge thank you to all our GMs and volunteers organizing\
  \ games. As the world starts to resume in-person gatherings, I’ll note each community\
  \ will decide when and how to approach in person gaming and request that all our\
  \ players work with their organizers to take suggested precautions and keep our\
  \ community safe, healthy, and happy. </p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <h2>Achievement\
  \ Point Update</h2> \n      <p>Another month, another few code rolls getting us\
  \ ever closer to the final launch of the Achievement Points (AcP) system. For those\
  \ keeping a close eye, you may have seen the rolls last week. They fixed our outstanding\
  \ issues but had a few unintended problems that we needed to resolve before we could\
  \ keep the roll live. We’ve now resolved character number issues, points accrued\
  \ from Premier and Premier Plus events, GM credits, and how boons generate from\
  \ the system, as well as a few other back end items. This is in line to be resolved\
  \ after our long weekend and we hope to have the final deployment soon.</p> \n \
  \     <p>This brings into question the free rebuild boon that is currently on the\
  \ site. I said previously that we would remove the boon two weeks after AcP went\
  \ live. Given that we are less than 30 days from the release of the Advanced Players\
  \ Guide, I want to amend my commentary. We will extend the date of the free rebuild\
  \ to <b>31 August</b>. This allows us enough time to get the APG sanctioned and\
  \ for players to use the rebuild to include options from that book. </p> \n    \
  \  <p>We’ve made a change to the rebuild boon, however. One of the code rolls gave\
  \ the ability to customize the boons beyond the one sentence preview. With this\
  \ live, we are adjusting the rebuild boon to the style we will use with all other\
  \ AcP purchases. The full text of the boon outlines the parameters for rebuild,\
  \ including a all changes are final once character is played and a slight recalculation\
  \ of the gold your character has post-rebuild, to account for any consumables you\
  \ have purchased &amp; used as well as a favorable resale value of items. This is\
  \ intended to make the rebuild easier: rather than having to calculate the value\
  \ of every item you have purchased and used since creating the character, you will\
  \ now simply have 85% of the gold you have earned during the character’s career\
  \ to that point. This revised rebuild went live today. Any unapplied rebuilds that\
  \ don’t this text will still be honored. In that case, the player should utilize\
  \ the 85% rule when rebuilding. Players who rebuilt characters prior to this blog\
  \ do not need to make adjustments to their characters. In all cases, a copy of the\
  \ boon should be included in the character’s chronicle sheet history.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Another note on AcP. Most of the point totals have settled. You can review\
  \ your totals in your “My Organized Play” section of Paizo.com. If you are seeing\
  \ errors in your AcP count, make sure to click the “Refresh Points” button on the\
  \ GM/Event Coordinator tab of your My Organized Play page. If there are still errors,\
  \ check to make sure all your games are reported. If they aren’t, please reach out\
  \ to the coordinator/local venture officer with your chronicles to get the game\
  \ entered into the system. If all games are accounted for, then email <a href=\"\
  mailto:pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com\">pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com</a> with as much\
  \ detail as you can about the errors so that we can take a look and make adjustments\
  \ as needed. This email should also be used for any other reporting errors if your\
  \ GM or event coordinator is unable to fix them.</p> \n      <p>One final piece\
  \ of AcP. We’ve solicited a list of frequently asked questions and are working on\
  \ putting together answers. We hope to have this done before it goes live and will\
  \ post a link in the comments as well as distribute the link to our community.</p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Gen Con Online</h2> \n      <p>Our next major online convention is\
  \ just weeks away! Gen Con Online will be July 30-August 2, and we currently have\
  \ nearly 900 games on offer for our four programs. The event catalog will be available\
  \ for preview on July 6 on <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Gen Con’s website</a>. For GMs who haven’t signed up yet, we invite you to register\
  \ for the OPF Major Events discord, as there are still opportunities to volunteer;\
  \ for more information on how to play or GM games, visit <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sha1?Organized-Play-at-Gen-Con-Online-2020\"\
  >last week’s blog post</a>. Next week we’ll be previewing the new scenario releases\
  \ you’ll see at Gen Con Online.</p> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n      <p>This\
  \ month, we <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9i?June-2020-Pathfinder-Society-Releases\"\
  >released the sanctioning</a> for the Age of Ashes Adventure Path for Pathfinder\
  \ (second edition). Players and GMs may now report their sessions and earn credit\
  \ for the AP. Additionally, last week we announced the winner of the Battle of the\
  \ Pantheons contest, and their pantheon has <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sha2?Battle-of-the-Pantheons-Winner-Announcement\"\
  >officially been sanctioned</a> as well!</p> \n      <p>Going forward, we have plans\
  \ to get Near Space sanctioned for Starfinder Society and the Advanced Player’s\
  \ Guide sanctioned for Pathfinder Society before the end of the month. There may\
  \ be more, but these two are the next ones on our radar.</p> \n      <h2>Volunteer\
  \ Recognition.</h2> \n      <p>No new campaign coins have been awarded since PaizoCon\
  \ Online.</p> \n      <p>We did announce our Order of the Wayfinder for 2019. We\
  \ usually announce this recipient at Gen Con or PaizoCon, but we held it last year\
  \ to try and do it in person. Unfortunately, our lack of travel thwarted our plans,\
  \ so we announced it virtually at the most recent Venture-Captain gathering when\
  \ the recipient was in attendance.</p> \n      <p>The Order of the Wayfinder is\
  \ a step above the Campaign Coin and is given to one person a year in recognition\
  \ of their efforts on behalf of some aspect of the Organized Play Program. Their\
  \ activities support the actions of the entire community and make a huge difference\
  \ in the quality of our programming. The award comes with a wayfinder (compass)\
  \ with an engraved plaque and a new organized play number in the 100’s.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Past recipients included Bob Jonquet, Auke Teeninga, and Alastair Rigg.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Please join me in recognizing <b>Alexander Lenz</b> as the 2019 recipient\
  \ for his coordination of the Additional Resources Task Force. The AR Task Force\
  \ is a group of individuals drawn from the volunteer organizers who review published\
  \ materials for inclusion in the relevant organized play campaign and make recommendations\
  \ to the Organized Play team. Without their input, completing our sanctioning documents\
  \ would be a much different task. Thank you, Alex, for the years you’ve spent leading\
  \ the Task Force!</p> \n      <h2>Stars, Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n      <p>We have\
  \ no new GMs to recognize yet, but part of the updates rolling out with AcP will\
  \ also allow our venture-captains to easily and automatically provide evaluations\
  \ to GMs who request them. This will help us automate the process and get our top-tier\
  \ GMs their badges and recognition sooner!</p> \n      <h2>Convention Listing</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Many of the conventions planned for the upcoming months have needed\
  \ to cancel or postpone due to shelter in place orders, but several others moved\
  \ their events online. We’ve listed the status for each event, but please check\
  \ their websites or notices for any last-minute changes.</p> \n      <table width=\"\
