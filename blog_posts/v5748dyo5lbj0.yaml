  \ near, I was a subscriber to two very special magazines. When I heard that some\
  \ new company had taken over my beloved magazines, I immediately went to this strange\
  \ newcomer's website to see what was up. I was delighted and intrigued by what I\
  \ found—a like-minded community enthused about roleplaying games, and wonder of\
  \ wonders, so was the staff!</p> \n   <p>A little over five years later (and a not-insignificant\
  \ amount of cookies), I have been happy to call many of the people on the Paizo\
  \ staff friend. Now, though, I get to call them coworker and see the level of dedication\
  \ they give to the products they put out every month for our gaming pleasure.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>While I am a young padawan learning at the foot of masters, my compatriots\
  \ Cosmo and Sara Marie will be showing me everything that makes Paizo's Customer\
  \ Service department awesome. After one day looking over their shoulders, I know\
  \ that I have much to learn—maybe some of their awesomeness will rub off on me.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Time to go feed the cave raptors—I think Crystal knows where they are\
  \ at, but I don't think they eat cookies... I may need to arm myself, just in case.</p>\
