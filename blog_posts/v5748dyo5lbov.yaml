  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 7, 2010</p> \n    <p>I've been a gamer\
  \ for most of my life, starting with 1st Edition when I was a wee lad. A couple\
  \ of years later I distinctly remember walking into a Save-On (now CVS) Drug to\
  \ buy the original Red Box edition. After that I gamed throughout junior high and\
  \ high school, (Go <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_High_School_(Los_Angeles,_California)\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"> Gondos</a>!), and even when I was in Argentina for a couple\
  \ of years and didn't have the opportunity to game, I thought about gaming a lot,\
  \ and when I got back and went to college, the gaming continued. Since then I've\
  \ continued to game, including after I got married and even after the arrival of\
  \ the various members of the Savage Horde. (Hi kids!) I'm currently playing in Sean\
  \ K Reynolds's <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/exilesOfZirnakaynin\">high-level drow\
  \ game</a>, playing Daeanu Azrinae, a 15th-level drow noble rogue (swashbuckler)\
  \ who's working for the Matron in an attempt to keep the other PCs focused on who\
  \ attacked us; I'm co-GMing <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\">Kingmaker</a>\
  \ with Lisa and her group at Chateau Stevens-Wertz; I'm gearing up to run a <a href=\"\
  /store/games/roleplayingGames/d/4E/wizardsOfTheCoast/gammaWorld\">Gamma World</a>\
  \ game during lunch using the new version just released by WotC; I've just made\
  \ a character for a 4e game being run by some new friends here in Redmond; and I'm\
  \ in the planning stages for a Pathfinder game tentatively titled The Dregs, where\
  \ the PCs will be made up of adventuring group outcasts created by rolling 3d6 for\
  \ stats, straight down the row, old school style. In fact, just about everyone in\
  \ the office plays in a ton of games somewhere, with Rob McCreary and James Jacobs\
  \ the current leaders, with somewhere around 20 hours a week each spent gaming.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Why am I telling you all of this? It's because I'm a firm believer in\
  \ the importance of actually playing games, and I'm hoping to have this The Gorilla\
  \ King Wants You to Game! blog idea become a semi-regular feature were I talk about\
  \ the various games going on here at Paizo. After a decade in the industry, it's\
  \ become clear that too many game designers and industry folks don't play games\
  \ anymore, of any kind. But that's not how we roll here at Paizo. We're all HUGE\
  \ gaming geeks and we love all kinds of games, from boardgames to TCGs, to video\
  \ and standard card games. There's even talk of setting up some <a href=\"/store/brand/warhammer40000\"\
  >Warhammer 40k</a> battles once the craziness of the holiday season settles down.\
  \ It's refreshing to work for a company where we not only make games, we play them\
  \ too. (I also think that playing games helps you make awesome games, but that's\
  \ for a blog on another day.)</p> \n    <p>So this holiday season try to get some\
  \ gaming in, of any kind. Don't have a local group? Head down to your local store\
  \ and play in a Pathfinder Society scenario or two. Don't have a local store nearby?\
  \ Try Infrno, d20 Pro, Skype, or some other virtual tabletop. Technology today makes\
  \ it easier than ever to find a way to game. If all else fails, I bet your Aunt\
  \ Martha knows how to play Monopoly. Although I bet she might like <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112404140.html\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Settlers of Catan</a> better.</p> \n    <p>And while you think\
  \ about ways to get your gaming grove on, check out this very cool piece from the\
  \ upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/campaignSetting/v5748btpy8dd7\"><i>Inner Sea World\
  \ Guide</i></a> hardcover, due for release in February.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n\
