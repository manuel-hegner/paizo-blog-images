  \ Preview: Five for Fighting</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, December 6, 2013</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We're\
  \ less than a month away from the January release of the 55-figure <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures! These figures support the\
  \ pulse-pounding <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, but the set contains enough monsters and\
  \ heroes to make it a great resource for any fantasy campaign.</span></p> \n   \
  \ <p>Of course, the Wrath of the Righteous wouldn't be so righteous without truly\
  \ evil foes to fight, and this week we have three more demons to throw onto the\
  \ battlefield, as well as two more general monsters that are sure to come in handy\
  \ in all sorts of situations.</p> \n    <p>First, the demons.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_BloodDemon_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_BloodDemon_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Blood Demon, the assassins, murders,\
  \ and sadists in a plane filled to bursting with all of the above. Appearing as\
  \ a horned human skeleton smothered with a bone-tight hide of slimy leather, blood\
  \ demons exude acidic slime that will make heroes think twice about punching them.\
  \ WizKids has helpfully coated this figure in a shiny gloss, to emphasize its sliminess.\
  \ The Blood Demon appears under a different name on page 57 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>. The figure is a Medium common.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_IncubusDemon_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_IncubusDemon_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Incubus, the male version of the\
  \ seductive succubus. Incubi appear on page 73 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>, where they are described as counselors, torturers,\
  \ and companions for greater demons. They are formed from the souls of particularly\
  \ lustful and rapacious mortals. The Incubus is a Medium uncommon figure.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Gibrileth_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Gibrileth_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The last demon today (but certainly not the last\
  \ in the set!) is my favorite, for as my appreciation for the <a href=\"/products/btpy91m9\"\
  >Seaweed Siren</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ no doubt reveals, I like the weird ones. This ugly guy is the Gibrileth, or Filth\
  \ Demon. Gibrileths are covered in hideous tumors and grasping appendages. They\
  \ enjoy spreading illness and nausea. They're also nasty with a whip, in addition\
  \ to being just plain old nasty. The Gibrileth is a Large, rare figure. Its statistics\
  \ appear on page 46 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvk\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ The Worldwound</a>, a critical resource for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> campaign. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Basilisk_500.jpeg\"> <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Basilisk_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Moving from the Abyssal to the just plain mean and\
  \ dangerous, I give you the Basilisk. This squat, reptilian monster turns creatures\
  \ to stone with its baleful gaze, a power that has ensured its status as a “classic”\
  \ monster from not just the beginning of fantasy roleplaying, but in mythic history\
  \ in general. WizKids did a great job sculpting its eight legs and giving him a\
  \ cool color scheme. The Basilisk is a Medium, uncommon figure. Its statistics are\
  \ found on page 29 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_RiftDrake_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_RiftDrake_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up for this week is the treacherous Rift Drake,\
  \ a lesser form of dragon that is nonetheless more powerful than just about all\
  \ of its drake cousins. Weighing in at CR 9, Rift Drakes spit a ball of caustic\
  \ gas that bursts into a cloud on impact. Rift Drakes inhabit badlands and areas\
  \ scarred by the gods, a pretty good description of the Worldwound in which the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Adventure Path</a> takes place. The pose is really sweet, and while the color\
  \ scheme is a bit difficult to grasp from the photos, in hand it looks very, very\
  \ cool. The Rift Drake is a Large, Uncommon creature. Its statistics appear on page\
  \ 106 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>That's it for this week's previews. Please join me next Friday for more\
  \ reveals and exciting news regarding the Pathfinder Battles line! See you in seven\
  \ days!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
