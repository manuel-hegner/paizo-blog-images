  description\"><i>Shaia \"Shy\" Ratani used to be a member of the most powerful thieves'\
  \ guild in Taldor—right up until she cheated her colleagues by taking the money\
  \ and running. The frontier city of Yanmass seems like a perfect place to lie low,\
  \ until a job solving a noble’s murder reveals an invading centaur army ready to\
  \ burn the place to the ground. Of course, Shy could stop that from happening, but\
  \ doing so would reveal her presence to the former friends who now want her dead.\
  \ Add in a holier-than-thou patron with the literal blood of angels in her veins,\
  \ and Shy quickly remembers why she swore off doing good deeds in the first place...</i></p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter 1: Sociality and Shackles</h2> \n     <p>\"\
  Shaia Ratani.\"</p> \n     <p>This wasn't how I wanted to be introduced.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Approach.\"</p> \n     <p>My chains rattled as I shuffled slowly across\
  \ the floor on bare feet. Despite the multitudes of burning candelabras stretching\
  \ down the hall on either side of me, the tattered rags I wore failed to ward off\
  \ a chill. Even if I hadn't been walking the length of a hall so grand and drenched\
  \ in opulence, I would have felt small.</p> \n     <p>\"That's close enough, thief.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>I stopped. The shackles around my wrists seemed heavy enough to pull\
  \ my eyes to the ground. In the reflection of tile so polished you'd pay to eat\
  \ off it, I could make out someone looking back at me, black hair hanging in greasy\
  \ strands before a face covered in grime.</p> \n     <p>My face.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Shaia Ratani,\" a deep, elegant voice said. \"You are accused of a thousand crimes\
  \ against the aristocracy of Taldor, the most heinous of which include larceny,\
  \ fraud, extortion, assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to\
  \ murder, unsanctioned use of poison, trespassing, public indecency ...\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>I was hard pressed to think of any legends that began like this.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"...and consorting with deviant powers.\"</p> \n     <p>Hell, I couldn't\
  \ even think of a good tavern story that began like this.</p> \n     <p>But it was\
  \ bards who were concerned with how stories began. In my line of work, you learned\
  \ early on that it's only the ending that matters.</p> \n     <p>\"You may look\
  \ up, thief.\"</p> \n     <p>Bold, commanding words from a bold, commanding voice.\
  \ You'd think, upon looking up, that they'd belong to a bold, commanding man.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Those were not the first words you'd think upon seeing Lord Herevard\
  \ Helsen. They <em>might </em>have been the thirty-second and thirty-third ones,\
  \ if you were generous.</p> \n     <p>Tall and thin as a stalk of corn and with\
  \ ears to match, the aristocrat who stood upon a raised dais at the end of the hall\
  \ seemed an ill fit for his fancy clothes. Hell, he seemed a poor fit for his own\
  \ home.</p> \n     <p>While his hall was bedecked with tapestries and servants standing\
  \ at attention and portraits of strong men and women with strong, noble features,\
  \ Herevard, with his weak chin and shrewd eyes, shifted uncomfortably. Like he could\
  \ sense his ancestors' disapproval emanating from the portraits and was already\
  \ imagining what they'd say if they could see him now.</p> \n     <p>I never knew\
  \ them, but I imagined they probably wouldn't be pleased to see a filthy Katapeshi\
  \ girl in shackles dirtying up their halls.</p> \n     <p>\"Understand this, Miss\
  \ Ratani.\" Lord Helsen spoke down an overlarge nose at me, as though the dais he\
  \ stood upon wasn't high enough to separate us. \"I have had you brought from my\
  \ private dungeons at the behest of another. A mission of mercy that relies entirely\
  \ on your ability to be civil. Do you understand?\"</p> \n     <p>That would have\
  \ sounded significantly more authoritative if his face weren't beaded with sweat.\
  \ I chose not to call attention to that, though. I merely nodded and received a\
  \ nod in exchange.</p> \n     <p>Lord Helsen glanced to his side.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  She was captured not two months ago. My guards found her robbing my study. She's\
  \ been serving penance in my dungeons ever since, my lady.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Penance?\"\
  \ another voice chimed in. A lyrical birdsong to his squawk: soft, feminine, gentle.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I wasn't sure how I hadn't noticed the woman standing beside him before,\
  \ but the moment she spoke, I couldn't see anything else in the room.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Had Lord Helsen not addressed her as \"lady,\" I might never have guessed\
  \ her to be a noble. She certainly wasn't what you'd think of when someone mentioned\
  \ the word, let alone what I'd think of. Her dress was a simple thing of white and\
  \ blue linens, easy to move in and functional—words that make aristocratic tailors\
  \ cringe. Her brown hair was clean and washed, but not styled with any particular\
  \ elegance. She didn't look especially rich.</p> \n     <p>Pretty, though.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Or at least, she might have been. It was hard to tell, what with the massive\
  \ spectacles resting upon the bridge of her nose.</p> \n     <p>\"Penance, my lady.\"\
  \ Lord Helsen nodded to the woman. \"As you know, Yanmass's laws are rather ...archaic\
  \ when it comes to crimes against the gentler class.\" He chuckled. \"Why, I'm told\
  \ that Lady Stelvan, upon finding a vagrant in her wine cellar, appealed to the\
  \ courts to have him walled up inside and—\"</p> \n     <p><em>\"Please!\"</em>\
  \ The woman held up a hand. \"Er, that is, Lord Helsen, I do not need to be privy\
  \ to the details.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of ...of course, Lady Sidara.\" Lord Helsen\
  \ made a hasty, apologetic bow. \"Regardless, I couldn't let her walk away freely.\
  \ Time to reflect upon her misdeeds in the dungeons seemed adequate.\" He glanced\
  \ back toward me. \"I suspect that she will be ideal for your purposes.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Purposes?\"</p> \n     <p>I hadn't intended to sound quite so alarmed\
  \ when I spoke. I hadn't intended to speak at all. </p> \n     <p>Lord Helsen hadn't\
  \ intended me to either, judging from the annoyed glare he shot me. \"Yes, thief.\
  \ Purposes.\" </p> \n     <p>I bowed my head. </p> \n     <p>\"The Lady Sidara has\
  \ need of someone with particular ...talents,\" he continued.</p> \n     <p>I nodded,\
  \ head still lowered. Somehow, I figured it was going to be about this.</p> \n \
  \    <p>The three things nobles hate most, in order, are losing money, bad wine,\
  \ and being reminded they have the same needs as anyone else. No matter how big\
  \ your house is or who you pay to wipe your ass, eventually everyone needs a treasure\
  \ stolen, a throat cut, or something set on fire.</p> \n     <p>They might have\
  \ used words like \"talents,\" but nobody needed dirty work done more than a noble.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And they didn't come nobler than they did in Taldor.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8535-Cover.jpg\"\

  \ <br><i>Illustration by Ralph Horsley</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>\"She is firmly\
  \ bound, my lady, and no danger at all.\" Herevard gestured to me with one white-gloved\
  \ hand. \"You may inspect her at your leisure.\"</p> \n     <p>Lady Sidara cast\
  \ him a nervous look before glancing back at me. I was, at that moment, keenly aware\
  \ of every inch of grime on my skin, every ounce of weight in my chains, every tear\
  \ in the raggedy shirt and trousers I wore. Something about this woman, with her\
  \ drab dress and giant spectacles, made me feel naked. Vulnerable.</p> \n     <p>Unworthy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Still, she wasn't the first person to do that to me. Certainly not the\
  \ worst person, either. I kept my head respectfully low, my body reassuringly still\
  \ as she approached me.</p> \n     <p>One dainty hand reached out as if to touch\
  \ me, but she seemed to think better of it and drew it away. I averted my gaze as\
  \ she studied me from behind those big round spectacles.</p> \n     <p>\"You're\
  \ not Taldan,\" she said. \"From the south, maybe?\"</p> \n     <p>Lord Helsen spoke\
  \ from the dais. \"She's Qadiran, my lady.\" </p> \n     <p>I stiffened at that.\
  \ My hands tightened into fists, only relaxing when Lady Sidara spoke again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Not Qadiran, Herevard. Her features are a little too fine.\" She hummed\
  \ a moment before her face lit up. \"Ah! Of course. You're from Katapesh.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Herevard yawned. \"Same thing.\"</p> \n     <p>Still, I couldn't help\
  \ but raise an eyebrow. Not a lot of people from Taldor appreciated the difference\
  \ between us southern nations, let alone a noble.</p> \n     <p>\"You poor dear,\"\
  \ she said, eyeing the sorry state of my dress and hygiene. \"Listen. I know this\
  \ might seem ...unorthodox. It certainly wasn't my first choice. But I have ...an\
  \ issue.\" She glanced around, as though wary of who might be listening. \"An issue\
  \ that Herevard said you might be able to help with.\"</p> \n     <p>I cast her\
  \ a sidelong look but said nothing. As if embarrassed, she turned away and readjusted\
  \ her spectacles.</p> \n     <p>\"I can't give you the details here,\" she said.\
  \ \"Nor can I promise it will be easy. But I can promise you'll be adequately rewarded.\
  \ I'll see you safely exonerated of your crimes and granted a handsome sum besides,\
  \ in exchange for your assistance.\" She drew herself up, fixed me with a hard look.\
  \ \"Of this, you have my word, Miss Ratani.\"</p> \n     <p>Funny how words, common\
  \ as they are, seem to mean an awful lot to some people. Nobles and their heritages,\
  \ wizards and their spells, paladins and their oaths—words mean a lot to the kind\
  \ of person who woke up one day and heard a higher calling.</p> \n     <p>I once\
  \ heard that calling.</p> \n     <p>Then I put the pillow over my head and went\
  \ back to sleep.</p> \n     <p>People like me, we don't put much stock in words.\
  \ We know how cheap they are. We know how quickly they spin on glib tongues and\
  \ how swiftly they scatter on the floor. People like me, we needed firmer stuff.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I know this must sound odd,\" Lady Sidara said. \"Is there ...is there\
  \ anything I can get you? To help you make up your mind?\"</p> \n     <p>I took\
  \ a breath and spoke softly.</p> \n     <p>\"A drink.\"</p> \n     <p>Lady Sidara\
  \ nodded and made a gesture to Herevard. Herevard, in turn, gestured to a nearby\
  \ servant. The servant ran to a table set up against one of the hall's walls and,\
  \ in a few moments, came rushing up to me with a goblet upon a tray. I took it,\
  \ nodded my gratitude, first to him and then to her. I closed my eyes and took a\
  \ long, slow sip of cold, refreshing liquid.</p> \n     <p>And immediately spat\
  \ it out.</p> \n     <p>\"What the hell is <em>this</em>?\" I snapped at the servant.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"W-water!\" he replied, holding up his tray like a shield.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Well, did I <em>ask </em>for water, Cecim, or did I ask for a gods-damned\
  \ <em>drink</em>?\"</p> \n     <p>\"S-sorry, Shy!\" he cried out, cowering. \"Sorry,\
  \ Mistress!\"</p> \n     <p>\"'Shy'? 'Mistress'?\"</p> \n     <p>It wasn't until\
  \ I looked and saw Lady Sidara, her mouth wide open in puzzlement, that I realized\
  \ I <em>might </em>have just ruined things.</p> \n     <p>\"What did you call her?\"\
  \ The noblewoman glanced from Cecim to me, and the puzzlement turned to irritation.\
  \ It was a full-blown scowl when she whirled upon Lord Helsen and saw the thin nobleman\
  \ quaking upon the dais, the sweat on his face having gone from beads to big as\
  \ moons.</p> \n     <p>\"What did he call her?\" she demanded. \"What's going on\
  \ here, Herevard?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Uh, well ...that is ...\" Lord Helsen's tongue\
  \ seemed two sizes too large for him at that moment, and he fumbled over his words.\
  \ \"You see, Lady Sidara, when ...when we make mistakes and ...and things are said\
  \ ...and we try to make them right, and ...\"</p> \n     <p>\"Ah, give it up, Herevard,\"\
  \ I said. \"Whatever excuse you're choking on, it's obvious she's not going to buy\
  \ it.\"</p> \n     <p>Lady Sidara turned to me, shock wrestling with outrage on\
  \ her features as she watched me unfasten the shackles around my wrists and drop\
  \ them to the floor. </p> \n     <p>I looked up at her, blinking. \"What?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You ...you're not a prisoner at all!\" She pointed a finger at me\
  \ that would have been accusing had it not been so dainty. \"You <em>lied </em>to\
  \ me!\"</p> \n     <p>\"If you'll recall, good lady,\" I replied, holding up my\
  \ liberated hands in defense, \"I didn't say ten words to you. Any lying came specifically\
  \ from <em>that </em>man.\"</p> \n     <p>Lord Helsen squirmed under my finger,\
  \ flailing as though he could pull an excuse from thin air. But instead, all he\
  \ did was thrust a finger right back at me and let out a rather unlordly screech.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"She was <em>blackmailing </em>me!\"</p> \n     <p>\"I was not!\" I\
  \ shouted back. \"I asked you <em>specifically </em>what the information was worth\
  \ to you! <em>You're </em>the one that came up with the number!\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Oh, don't you turn this on <em>me, </em>you lying Qadiran—\"</p> \n     <p>\"<em>Katapeshi!</em>\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"<em>ENOUGH!</em>\"</p> \n     <p>To look at her, you wouldn't have\
  \ thought such a little lady could come up with such a bellowing voice. But it seemed\
  \ Lady Sidara, breathing heavily, holding her hands up in a demand for silence,\
  \ was a woman of more than a few surprises.</p> \n     <p>\"No more lies.\" She\
  \ split her scowl between me and Lord Helsen. \"And no more blaming. The truth.\
  \ Now.\"</p> \n     <p>The nobleman and I exchanged glances for moment—or rather,\
  \ <em>I </em>exchanged a glance and he gave me a look that suggested he might soil\
  \ himself. At that, I just rolled my eyes and sighed.</p> \n     <p>\"All right,\
  \ fine. What I did might, in some countries, be construed as blackmail.\" I waved\
  \ absently toward the dais. \"I got some information on Herev—\" I caught myself;\
  \ didn't want to rub salt in the wound. \"—on Lord Helsen and asked him what it\
  \ was worth to him to keep it quiet.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And what <em>was </em>it\
  \ worth?\" Lady Sidara asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Two months in a nice bedroom at his\
  \ manor,\" I replied. \"Waited on hand and foot by Cecim here.\" I shot a glare\
  \ at the servant. \"Who should damn well <em>know </em>by now what I mean when I\
  \ say I want a drink!\"</p> \n     <p>Cecim squealed and scurried off, still holding\
  \ his tray up. I sighed and looked back to Lady Sidara.</p> \n     <p>\"Anyway,\
  \ when he said you had a job that needed doing, we made up this bit about the private\
  \ dungeon.\" I gestured to my clothes and grime. \"Though had I known it would turn\
  \ out like this, I wouldn't have bothered painting so much dirt on myself.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lady Sidara frowned.</p> \n     <p>\"And what information did you have\
  \ to make ...<em>\" </em>She gestured over me. \"<em>This </em>seem intelligent?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Well, I—\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>\"\
  You <em>swore </em>you wouldn't tell!\" Lord Helsen piped up, his face a red-hot\
  \ contortion of embarrassment.</p> \n     <p>\"Herevard, what good do you think\
  \ <em>not </em>telling her would do?\" I looked back to the noblewoman and sighed.\
  \ \"I found out about his mistress. A lovely little halfling woman who visits his\
  \ chambers every other night.\" I shot her a wink. \"Herry likes his short women.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Lord Helsen's mouth hung open. His eyes looked like they were about\
  \ to roll out of their sockets. I had no doubt that, if I could have read his thoughts,\
  \ they'd be mostly my name attached to variations of the word \"strangle.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Frankly, I wasn't sure what the big deal was. I always thought they\
  \ looked cute together.</p> \n     <p> Lady Sidara, for her part, didn't seem particularly\
  \ upset, either. She slowly turned a sweet, sad smile on Lord Helsen.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Oh, Herevard,\" she said. \"We've all known about Numa for years now.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"W-what?\" Lord Helsen said. \"Everyone? All of Yanmass?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>She nodded gently. He made a soft whimpering sound.</p> \n     <p>\"Even\
  \ Lady Stelvan?\"</p> \n     <p>\"She was the first to know, Herry.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Well, then.\" I kicked off my ankle shackles and sent them skidding across\
  \ the hallway. \"I guess we've all learned an important lesson about honesty today.\"\
  \ I began wiping the painted-on grime from my skin. \"And it seems my time with\
  \ Herry is at an end. Give me a couple of hours to have a bath and I'm all yours,\
  \ my lady.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What?\" Lady Sidara looked at me, anger flashing across\
  \ her features. \"You assume I'd still hire you now, after ...after ...\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Oh, what? You were happy to have me when you thought I was a thief, but\
  \ now that I'm an extortionist, you're too good for me?\" I rolled my eyes. \"A\
  \ touch hypocritical, don't you think?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's not that! It's just\
  \ ...\" She rubbed the back of her neck, helpless. \"This ...this is a delicate\
  \ operation, one that I am intent on seeing carried through. I need people I can\
  \ trust.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Liar.\"</p> \n     <p>She looked at me like I had just\
  \ slapped her. \"What?\"</p> \n     <p>\"If you needed people you could trust, you\
  \ would have found a knight or a brave warrior or some lovesick noble. What you\
  \ <em>need </em>is someone who can get the job done, and the fact that you're here\
  \ tells me that the people you can trust simply can't do that.\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ fixed me with a long, methodical stare. And though it made me feel every bit as\
  \ naked as it had the first time, I held my ground and my smile like a sword and\
  \ shield.</p> \n     <p>\"And can you get the job done?\" she asked.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Are you still going to pay?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I will.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Then I can.\" I turned to walk away toward the hall's exit. \"But, as I said, let\
  \ me get a bath first. I'm not going to talk business covered in filth.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Yes, fine, whatever.\" Lady Sidara stalked behind me. \"Glad to be doing\
  \ business then, Miss ...\" She paused. \"Is your name even Shaia?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Of course it is.\" I glanced over my shoulder, spared her a wink. \"But my\
  \ friends call me Shy.\" </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
