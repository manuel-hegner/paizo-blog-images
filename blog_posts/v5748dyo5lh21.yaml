  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Adam Heine</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Not Some Hero</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">\"So where\
  \ do we go?\" Blit pulled the hood of his cloak over his head. He wasn't used to\
  \ being out at sunset. He felt exposed.</p> \n    <p>\"Green warehouse at the old\
  \ pier,\" Allyra said. \"We've known about it for a while, but our cell isn't equipped\
  \ for large-scale rescue, so we never moved on it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So the two of\
  \ us are going to do what you and all your friends couldn't pull off.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>She lowered her chin with a smirk. \"Yup.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit sighed. She\
  \ was enjoying this far more than he was.</p> \n    <p>The green warehouse lay in\
  \ one of the lowest parts of the Puddles. The bottom of it was perpetually wet,\
  \ covered in barnacles and algae—that's why they called it the green warehouse,\
  \ apparently.</p> \n    <p>There were no guards going in. Blit and Allyra dashed\
  \ up the stairs to a long corridor with rooms on either side. There were no guards\
  \ here either—the Banshees were busy with the slaves imprisoned in each of the rooms.\
  \ Blit and Allyra entered the first room on the right.</p> \n    <p>Thwack! Allyra's\
  \ hammer sang. A Banshee fell to the floor.</p> \n    <p>Blit winced. \"That was\
  \ Alver!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know. Will you get the key?\"</p> \n    <p>He poked\
  \ Alver in the chest. \"I think you killed him!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Blit.\" She put\
  \ a hand on his shoulder. \"We don't have much time. Are we helping the slaves or\
  \ the bad guys?\"</p> \n    <p>Blit wasn't sure—just a couple days ago, he was one\
  \ of the bad guys.</p> \n    <p>\"The key, Blit.\"</p> \n    <p>He nodded in spite\
  \ of himself.</p> \n    <p>While he was digging around in Alver's pockets (a disgusting\
  \ thought, whether Alver was dead or not), she gave the slaves directions to a place\
  \ in the Foreign Quarter where other Caydenites could keep them safe for a while.\
  \ The slaves were a mishmash of races and cultures, and not all of them spoke the\
  \ common tongue, but those that did translated quickly for the others.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Got it,\" Blit said. He tossed the key to Allyra, who unlocked the first\
  \ slave—man, not slave. That man began unlocking the rest.</p> \n    <p>While they\
  \ set themselves free, Allyra turned to Blit. \"We have to split up.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"What? But I thought—\"</p> \n    <p>\"I said there's no time. Listen, I'll\
  \ try to make noise about it. Hopefully they'll all come after me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No, Allyra!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then you help the ones who are left.\" She leaned forward\
  \ and—to Blit's simultaneous surprise, joy, and disgust—kissed him on the cheek.\
  \ \"Be careful.\"</p> \n    <p>Then she was gone. A couple of the prisoners who\
  \ hadn't been freed yet stared at him.</p> \n    <p>\"Shut up,\" he said. Realizing\
  \ they hadn't said anything, and maybe didn't understand Taldane anyway, he added,\
  \ \"Get yourselves out of here.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit poked his head into the hall,\
  \ ducking back quickly as a handful of thugs chased Allyra out of one room and down\
  \ the dark corridor. Blit stepped into the room she'd vacated.</p> \n    <p>Kip\
  \ and two other Banshees were still there. One of them, whose name Blit couldn't\
  \ remember, slashed a knife across a halfling slave's throat. The halfling fell\
  \ to the ground, choking on his own blood. Blit gagged. He'd seen the aftermath\
  \ of murder, but he'd never thought about how it happened. This is what the guilds\
  \ did—killed for their own gain.</p> \n    <p>And Blit was absolutely complicit.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Five other prisoners—men and women—lay on the ground dead, while another\
  \ dozen trembled, waiting their turns. Blit didn't think at all. He mixed and tossed\
  \ two bombs before anyone knew he was there. The entire building shook with the\
  \ blasts (so much for Allyra's distraction). When the smoke cleared, Kip and Sidro\
  \ were lying on the ground—most of them, anyway.</p> \n    <p>The other Banshee\
  \ (Nye! That was his name) charged. Blit slipped a vial quickly to his mouth, giving\
  \ himself a burst of speed, and he ducked easily. He dashed to where part of Kip\
  \ lay and grabbed his club, then drank the vial that tasted like leather.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Nye attacked again, clipping Blit on the arm, but he barely felt it. He\
  \ moved so fast now that he was able to get behind Nye and whack him on the back\
  \ of the head, dropping him easily.</p> \n    <p>A slow, heavy clap sounded behind\
  \ him. \"Well, well,\" Gedrak said. \"I didn't—\"</p> \n    <p>He only stopped because\
  \ Blit had smashed the club into the half-orc's face.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Sometimes Blit's job as the Patch Man gets a little intense.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>He hadn't really meant to. Normally Gedrak's voice would have\
  \ frozen him still, but something about the adrenaline or the extracts he'd drunk\
  \ or the fact that several dozen prisoners were counting on him to not die (not\
  \ yet, anyway), again drove him to act without thinking.</p> \n    <p>He hadn't\
  \ expected the club to splinter on Gedrak's jaw, though.</p> \n    <p>Gedrak staggered\
  \ to one side but didn't fall down (also somewhat unexpected). With a feral growl,\
  \ he drew his serrated blade and attacked.</p> \n    <p>Blit rolled away, grabbing\
  \ Nye's short sword on the way. Unfortunately, Blit had no idea how to use a sword,\
  \ but he was fast enough that Gedrak had trouble fending off all of his pathetic\
  \ attacks.</p> \n    <p>He needed more firepower. He led Gedrak out into the corridor\
  \ where his bombs wouldn't accidentally hurt anyone. Then with his extra speed,\
  \ he leapt backward and tossed a bomb at Gedrak's feet.</p> \n    <p>The half-orc\
  \ howled in fury. But when the smoke cleared, instead of Gedrak pieces, the guild\
  \ boss's ugly face snarled only inches away. Reflexively, Blit reached for another\
  \ vial, but Gedrak slashed at his cloak. The jagged blade missed Blit's mortally\
  \ important parts, for which he was grateful to no god in particular (all of them\
  \ equally, really), but it ripped an enormous gash through his pockets. Chemicals\
  \ splattered all over Blit. Glass vials sprinkled on the floor, many of them shattering,\
  \ none of them mixing into some fortuitous cocktail that blew up the whole building\
  \ (alas).</p> \n    <p>He still had his strength and speed, but not forever. Without\
  \ any more alchemy, he'd be dead for sure.</p> \n    <p>\"This isn't you, Blit.\"\
  \ Gedrak breathed heavily. He was at least as wounded as Blit himself. Blit had\
  \ done more damage than he thought. \"You're the Patch Man, not some hero.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yeah, well.\" Blit found he was panting himself. \"Someone was short-shrifting\
  \ me.\"</p> \n    <p>Gedrak laughed at that. \"You think your bar wench isn't doing\
  \ the same? She's using you, Blit. She wants one thing. I want another. Nobody cares\
  \ about what you want, do they?\"</p> \n    <p>Blit blinked. Allyra had used him\
  \ and, to be honest, was continuing to use him for this rescue.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Walk away, Blit.\" Gedrak put his blade back in its sheath. \"Really. If you walk\
  \ away now, I'll forget I ever saw you here. You can leave the Puddles and start\
  \ again, just like you want.\"</p> \n    <p>That was Gedrak's mistake, really. Blit\
  \ did want to walk away, to forget he'd ever come to Absalom in the first place.\
  \ But the last thing he wanted to do was start over somewhere else.</p> \n    <p>Gedrak's\
  \ other mistake was putting away his blade while a supernaturally fast alchemist\
  \ stood in front of him. Before Gedrak could blink, Blit dove forward and grabbed\
  \ one of the vials that hadn't broken. Not just any vial—he knew his extracts by\
  \ sight, even scattered across the floor—but his mutagen.</p> \n    <p>By the time\
  \ Gedrak had his blade out again, Blit had swallowed the green liquid. He grew a\
  \ foot in height. His hands became claws. His teeth stretched into tusks every bit\
  \ as ugly as Gedrak's. His entire body became monstrous and foul—even more so than\
  \ before.</p> \n    <p>Gedrak charged. Blit punched the half-orc in the chest, knocking\
  \ him backward and sending his blade spinning across the floor. Then he stretched\
  \ out his claws and released a demonic roar.</p> \n    <p>Gedrak stood and roared\
  \ back. He leapt forward and grabbed Blit by his now enormously strangle-proof throat.\
  \ They tore and bit and clawed at each other. Blit tossed Gedrak through a wall\
  \ and rushed in after him. Gedrak ripped a board up from the floor and belted Blit\
  \ in the head, sending him staggering back.</p> \n    <p>While Blit recovered, Gedrak\
  \ tossed a smokestick at Blit's feet. Thick smoke filled the hall and his lungs.\
  \ He coughed violently. Then through his tears, he saw Gedrak emerge through the\
  \ smoke, driving a blade at Blit's gut.</p> \n    <p>There was a shout and a gurgling\
  \ thud, but neither came from Blit. He opened his eyes. Between Gedrak and him stood\
  \ Allyra, with the point of the half-orc's blade sticking out of her back.</p> \n\
  \    <p>She'd saved him.</p> \n    <p>Allyra spat up blood. Gedrak blinked. And\
  \ Blit, still under the effects of his speed extract, did what any unthinking, feral\
  \ half-demon who had just seen his friend impaled would do. He grabbed Nye's sword\
  \ from the floor of the hall and drove it straight through Gedrak's misshapen head.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The half-orc slumped to the floor. With no one holding the blade, Allyra\
  \ fell too, unconscious and breathing raggedly. Blit dropped to his knees, cold\
  \ ice gripping his heart. His thoughts were fuzzed from the mutagen, but he knew\
  \ there was nothing he could do for her. He had no extracts that could save someone's\
  \ life.</p> \n    <p>The sound of footsteps strolled toward him. A mysterious wind\
  \ dissipated all of the smoke at once, and Blit found himself looking up at a tall,\
  \ imperious-looking woman dressed in a noblewoman's finery. A glint of adamantine\
  \ mail peeked out from her shirt. She was so out of place in the Puddles that he\
  \ knew immediately who it must be. \"Talish.\"</p> \n    <p>The woman looked down\
  \ her nose at Blit, at Allyra, at the dead Gedrak. She peered into each of the rooms\
  \ where the other dead Banshees were and where some of the slaves were still locked\
  \ up. </p> \n    <p>Blit flexed his claws, but he was trembling. He didn't know\
  \ whether he could defeat her in his current state—a woman whom even Gedrak served,\
  \ who had a whiff of magic about her.</p> \n    <p>Finally, Talish nodded. \"It\
  \ would seem you've patched up my loose ends.\" She nudged Nye's blade, turning\
  \ Gedrak's head back and forth. Then she turned around and left as calmly as she\
  \ had arrived.</p> \n    <p>An unnerving silence filled the corridor, broken only\
  \ by Blit's heaving breaths.</p> \n    <p>\"Allyra!\" He spun around, unsure what\
  \ he would do, when suddenly more unexpected visitors burst into the corridor. Men\
  \ and women in brigandines, wearing red scarfs with an ale mug embroidered on them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Two of them rushed to Allyra and knelt at her side. One muttered something\
  \ that sounded suspiciously like a prayer while the other wrenched Gedrak's blade\
  \ from her belly.</p> \n    <p>\"What are you doing?\" Blit growled.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  She'll be all right, Blit,\" said one. Blit blinked. It was the barkeep from the\
  \ Puddleglut.</p> \n    <p>Allyra gasped, then fell back down, breathing.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The barkeep smiled in relief and said again, \"She'll be all right.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Blit's heart became ten times lighter. He didn't know what means the\
  \ Caydenites had to save her from a wound like that, but he didn't much care either.\
  \ She was alive!</p> \n    <p>He stood, bumping his head on the ceiling, and felt\
  \ suddenly self-conscious. He didn't want her to see him like this. He looked around\
  \ at Gedrak, at Sidro and Kip, at the slaves making their way out into the night.\
  \ He shouldn't be here either. He hunted for an invisibility extract in the tattered\
  \ pieces of his cloak and found one still unbroken.</p> \n    <p>The next moment,\
  \ the Caydenites were alone.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It took him until sunrise to pack what remained of his equipment. He\
  \ would've finished sooner, but (one) he was hurt and (two) his claws had kept getting\
  \ in the way until his mutagen finally wore off. Packing up was bitter but familiar\
  \ work. Even bitterer would be the work of finding a new home.</p> \n    <p>\"What\
  \ are you doing, Blittervy?\"</p> \n    <p>He hadn't heard Allyra open the door.\
  \ She hunched over, one arm wrapped over her stomach in an enormous bandage. Had\
  \ she walked here like that?</p> \n    <p>\"Blittervy? Really?\" Blit sneered, then\
  \ shook his head. \"Town's run me out again. Time to move on.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Run you out?\" She slammed the door behind her. \"What the hell are you talking\
  \ about? You're a hero!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well I can't work as a Patch Man anymore,\
  \ can I? Gedrak's gone, sure, but he's not the only guild boss that used to hire\
  \ me. They'll all hear of this, maybe come after me just to make sure I don't turn\
  \ on one of them, too.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh.\" She looked embarrassed. \"I'm sorry.\
  \ I forget, you've been on your own for so long.\"</p> \n    <p>He snorted. \"I\
  \ gotta say, being a hero's even less practical than a fiend-blooded alchemist.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She came up behind him and touched his shoulder. Softly, she said,\
  \ \"I saw you, you know, when you were fighting Gedrak.\"</p> \n    <p>He froze.\
  \ \"You saw...?\" He never wanted her to see, never wanted anyone to see, what he\
  \ truly was.</p> \n    <p>\"It was amazing.\" She squeezed his shoulder, once again\
  \ making him feel awkward as hell. \"But it wasn't you, any more than those human\
  \ masks you wear.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit didn't know what to say to that.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Examining the paraphernalia in his pack, she said, \"Have you considered the\
  \ clergy? The Lucky Drunk could use someone like you.\"</p> \n    <p>He laughed\
  \ loudly, then found he couldn't stop laughing until long after his chest started\
  \ hurting. \"No,\" he finally said, wiping a tear. \"No, I don't think the Drunk\
  \ wants someone like me at all.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You never know.\" She took a deep\
  \ breath. \"Anyway, listen. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but my order has\
  \ this potion—a great secret, mind you—that's said to reveal one's true self. If\
  \ you wanted—\"</p> \n    <p>He rolled his eyes. \"It's beer. You're talking about\
  \ beer.\"</p> \n    <p>She laughed. \"Yeah, want some?\"</p> \n    <p>Blit looked\
  \ at his pack, at his tiny room that he couldn't stay in any longer, and smiled.\
  \ \"You know what? I really do.\"</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming\
