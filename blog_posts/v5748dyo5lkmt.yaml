  >Ultimate Add-On Decks</a>, is making its way into the hands of subscribers and\
  \ favorite local game stores everywhere, so it's finally time to spill the beans\
  \ on our design process for the Ultimate decks:</p> \n    <ol style=\"list-style:\

  \ of</li> \n     <li><b>Phase 2</b>: ?</li> \n     <li><b>Phase 3</b>: Profit</li>\n\
  \    </ol> \n    <p>Okay, wait, it was slightly more complicated than that.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>Hayato should spend some time with Jinfu's stylist.</p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>First, we identified a single character to include in each deck, preferably\
  \ ones we'd had trouble sneaking into a class deck otherwise. Hayato was the obvious\
  \ pick for <em>Ulitmate Combat</em>. He is a master of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaijutsu\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Iaijutsu</a> and mounted combat, fighting under a banner that\
  \ bolsters his comrades and strikes fear into his enemies. His bonded mount Jinfu\
  \ is a versatile warhorse that never lets him down.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6828-Yojimbo_360.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Yojimbo\" does sound way cooler than \"bodyguard.\"</p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Hayato's roles are designed primarily around your fighting style in your\
  \ party. Ronin is best for when Hayato who walks his own path, with a great deal\
  \ of healing and bonuses to checks while alone. Yojimbo is better for when Hayato\
  \ wants to protect others and make the best use of Jinfu in a group.</p> \n    <div\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6828-KabutoHelmet_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>I'd recommend a Wakizashi to pair with the Katana, and a Do-Maru\
  \ for that fine helmet.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Because Hayato is a Tian character,\
  \ this was a perfect opportunity to include some appropriately themed cards. That\
  \ includes the Katana, a more elegant Bastard Sword for a more civilized samurai,\
  \ and the Kabuto Helmet, highly protective and good for impressing those you come\
  \ across.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6828-DwarvenEarthbreaker.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Dwarven innovation to break down a wall, elven innovation to shoot\
  \ the army on the other side.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The deck is not limited to\
  \ just that theme, however. It features a startling array of weapons, with some\
  \ of the best one-handed and two-handed melee and ranged options in the game at\
  \ every adventure deck number.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Bringing armor back, baby!</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>We've been experimenting\
  \ with the design space for armor for quite some time. Our design goal (going forward,\
  \ but specifically for <i>Ultimate Combat</i>) is that armor should be good enough\
  \ that players are always tempted to spend a card feat on armor and a power feat\
  \ on armor proficiency. Armor is designed to save you from emergencies, but in doing\
  \ so it cannot increase your chance of failure to keep it around.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ new armors in <i>Ultimate Combat</i> tend to have great bonuses to make them worth\
  \ keeping in your hand or displaying. Kikko Armor displays, allowing you to use\
  \ it when needed with no downside. Choosing to use a one-handed weapon over a two-handed\
  \ weapon allows you to use a shield, but generally reduces your Combat check. That's\
  \ not an ideal formula for success, so the new shields like the Dwarven War Shield\
  \ help melee combatants make up that gap.</p> \n    <p>I'm extremely interested\
  \ in hearing what folks think of the new armor. I'm probably not supposed to say\
  \ that you're playtesting ideas for the next base set <i>[You are most assuredly\
  \ not.—Mike]</i> but you totally are.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>We play both Ranged and Melee at this fine establishment.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>While armor and weapons are the slim majority of the deck,\
  \ we did not remotely skimp on other cards. Any character who really cares about\
  \ combat, especially of the Melee and Ranged varieties, will other cards to keep\
  \ them occupied. That includes an entire cycle of Bow Ammunition (similar to the\
  \ bullets in Gunslinger), cards like the Grappler's Mask to help combat-focused\
  \ characters occasionally get past those pesky non-combat challenges, and a small\
  \ array of spells for Arcane and Divine mixed martial artists.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>There are indeed vikings in Golarion.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>There's\
  \ also a solid selection of great allies. Most trend towards assisting in combat,\
  \ moving to combat, and post-combat healing, but there should be something here\
  \ for everyone. I'd certainly consider taking a Swiftshooter on a non-Ranged character\
  \ just for the draw before I explore.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>You'll count your blessings that you've got these blessings.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>One of the earliest design decisions for the Ultimate decks\
  \ was how much each deck should support the included characters. There may well\
  \ be a <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Stephen-Hawkings-last-paper-predicts-parallel-universes/2351521467026\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">parallel universe</a> in which <em>Ultimate Combat</em> contains\
  \ only armor and weapons, where to remotely play Hayato you need to supply other\
  \ cards. That universe isn't this one, so we needed a bunch of blessings for every\
  \ Ultimates deck. Mike meticulously analyzed every single blessing we've made and\
  \ every deity who could still use one to make sure we solved this problem right.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Each Ultimates deck contains a new basic blessing, like Blessing of the\
  \ Samurai above, that should be well-suited and even exciting for its intended audience.\
  \ Each also contains a number of new deities, including deities from Tian and nonhuman\
  \ races when appropriate. Finally, spread over the Ultimate decks are normal and\
  \ upgraded blessings for every single one of Golarion's core deities.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Those of you playing in the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/acg\">Adventure Card\
  \ Guild</a> may wonder how Ultimates work for you. If you're playing a character\
  \ from a non-Ultimate Deck, you can add the cards from any 1 Ultimate Deck to your\
  \ deck; if you're playing a character from an Ultimate Deck, you can add the cards\
  \ from any 1 Class Deck. This means that Hayato can use cards from, say, the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9cu9?Paladin-Class-Deck\"><em>Paladin Class Deck</em></a>\
  \ if he wants. It also means that you can start taking <em>Ultimate Combat</em>\
  \ boons with any of your Organized Play characters like Crowe, Oloch, and Reta.\
  \ If you've ever regretted not having an upgrade choice for a boon type, fret no\
  \ more—we've got you covered. If you're prone to analysis paralysis and aren't sure\
  \ what boon to take... expect to spend a lot more time paralyzed with indecision!</p>\

  \ doodads in <em>Ultimate Magic!</em></p> \n    <p>Keith Richmond<br> <i>Adventure\
