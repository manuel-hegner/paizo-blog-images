  \    <p class=\"date\">Saturday, July 18, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In Richard Connell's 1924 short story \"The\
  \ Most Dangerous Game,\" a hunter bored with animals because they don't have the\
  \ brain power to be a threat to him instead hunts people he has trapped on his island.\
  \ This he finds exhilarating, especially when a big-game hunter lands on his shore.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online</a>,\
  \ the most dangerous game is played between two human-controlled characters. Even\
  \ the most advanced AI cannot provide the challenge and unpredictability of battling\
  \ another human-controlled character. Many MMO players crave the thrill of this\
  \ Player-vs-Player challenge and seek out PvP in preference to fighting NPC monsters\
  \ which can become predictable because of the limits of AI.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>Arch enemies Phyllain and Nihimon square off in a duel to the\
  \ death!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Our goal is to give players meaningful and focused\
  \ outlets for PvP while disincentivizing the random player killing that plagues\
  \ other open-world MMOs. In Pathfinder Online, settlements fight over territory\
  \ and other valuable items. There's still a risk that anybody can attack anybody\
  \ else at any time, which adds a sense of suspense to your encounters with other\
  \ characters in the game, but in PFO, meaningless PvP comes with a cost to the aggressor,\
  \ so the reality is that you will rarely (if ever) have this happen to you unless\
  \ you are part of a group which is at war with another group.</p> \n     <h2>Territory\
  \ Warfare Is Here!</h2> \n     <p>With the next patch to the game, players will\
  \ be able to vie for control of hexes in the River Kingdoms. There are currently\
  \ 603 claimable hexes in the game; as of the writing of this blog, 219 of them have\
  \ been claimed by someone by putting down a holding and some outposts. Holdings\
  \ and outposts produce the bulk goods that settlements will need to grow and thrive\
  \ once that system starts to come online in a month or so. For the last few months,\
  \ settlements have been putting down the holdings in anticipation of this. But until\
  \ now, those holdings were impervious to attack.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>A mass battle between Golgotha and Brighthaven over a tower.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>In EE10.1, a company will be able to feud the owning company\
  \ of a holding and then try to seize control of that holding's hex during the controlling\
  \ company's PvP window, which that company sets. This will be a multiple-day affair.\
  \ First, the invader will need to capture the hex's outposts. NPC guards will attempt\
  \ to fight off the interlopers and will give the hex's current owner time to arrive\
  \ in force to prevent the seizure. The more you upgrade your holdings and outpost,\
  \ the better and more numerous the guards will be, giving you more time to arrive\
  \ on the scene and beat back the attackers.</p> \n     <p>If the attacker is able\
  \ to take all the outposts in the hex by killing all the guards and then accumulating\
  \ enough capture points at the holding, the next day they will be able to try to\
  \ do the same thing to that hex's holding. If they are successful, the attacker\
  \ will take over ownership of those structures. Ownership of the holding gives ownership\
  \ over the hex. This is the way that countries, kingdoms and empires will be built,\
  \ hex by hex. And it all starts in a few days!</p> \n     <h2>The Future of the\
  \ Most Dangerous Game</h2> \n     <p>Over the next year, new systems will be coming\
  \ online to add more variety to PvP combat in the River Kingdoms.</p> \n     <p>First\
  \ up will be the Faction System. In this system, players will be able to join one\
  \ of several factions in the game and gain access to benefits from that association,\
  \ including unique gear, training and locations. But all of these benefits come\
  \ with a potential drawback: members of a faction opposed to yours can attack you\
  \ without penalty whenever and wherever they find you. And you can do it to them\
  \ as well. For instance, two of the first factions will be the Pathfinder Society\
  \ and the Aspis Consortium. These two age-old enemies hate each other with a passion,\
  \ and the lore of Golarion is full of stories of their fights against each other.\
  \ In PFO, lower-tier members of these factions will have the option of flagging\
  \ themselves for PvP with. members of the opposing faction, but as you rise through\
  \ the ranks of your chosen faction, the flag for PVP will become non-optional.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Farther down the road, we will add factions such as the Echowood Bandits,\
  \ the Crusader Knights (including the Eagle Knights of Andoran and the Knights of\
  \ Iomedae), the Hellknights, and factions serving each of the major gods. Factions\
  \ provide PFO players with a way to opt into consensual PVP that allows them to\
  \ add to their character's backstory and purpose in the game.</p> \n     <p>Even\
  \ farther on in the game's development, there will be settlement vs. settlement\
  \ warfare, including siege engines and army-vs-army combat. But those details will\
  \ have to wait for a future blog.</p> \n     <h2>Player Profile: Nihimon Vhane'Sylvan</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>The first time I heard of Nihimon was in the earliest days of Pathfinder\
  \ Online when we sent out a request for supporters to send us videos telling us\
  \ why they were excited about our game, which we used during our first Kickstarter\
  \ campaign. In the following years, Nihimon became a strong voice in our online\
  \ community, helping us crowdforge the game into what it is today. His <a href=\"\
  http://goblinary.com\" target=\"_blank\">goblinary.com</a> website has become an\
  \ essential resource for players interested in studying the game design behind PFO.\
  \ In-game, Nihimon is one of the leaders of the settlement of Phaeros, a community\
  \ of wizards in the southern Echowood. Allied with Brighthaven and Keeper's Pass\
  \ to form the Everbloom Alliance, the Phaerites have been in an almost constant\
  \ battle with the evil city of Golgotha to their north. Both sides have dealt blows\
  \ to each other in the last few months. It will be interesting to see how their\
  \ war changes as new features are added to the game.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>I first heard about Pathfinder Online\
  \ when a friend of mine pointed me to <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/blog/your-pathfinder-online-character/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Your Pathfinder Online Character</a> on the <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/blog\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Goblinworks blog</a>. I immediately recognized the revolutionary\
  \ potential of such a game and fell head-over-heels in love with it. The promise\
  \ of being one of those first players let into the game lured me to become active\
  \ on the forums. There, I worked hard to be helpful and informative and to push\
  \ back against the \"learn to use search, newb\" mentality that plagues so many\
  \ other game forums. What started with <a href=\"/people/Nihimon/wishlists/v5748l939kr71\"\
  >Guild Recruitment &amp; Helpful Links</a> gradually morphed into <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0THpTRVitJ7clFtVi1lZWptekk&amp;usp=sharing\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online (Public)</a> and culminated in the Goblinary.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The Seventh Veil organization officially announced itself on February\
  \ 20, 2012, almost exactly two months after the first Goblinworks Blog. We have\
  \ some of the most active longtime fans of PFO, and many of the players who came\
  \ together on the forums back then are still actively participating in the community\
  \ and have been playing PFO since Alpha. We set ourselves the goal of writing useful\
  \ guides and spreading our knowledge to the rest of the community, and we have achieved\
  \ those goals with many of the guides linked at Pathfinder Online (Public) having\
  \ been written by our members.</p> \n      <p>Nihimon first appeared in the River\
  \ Kingdoms in the form of an elf wizard. He holds divination magic in high esteem\
  \ for its ability to lay bare the truths of the world around him. As a Steward of\
  \ the Seventh Veil, he—along with Decius Brutus—is responsible for the well-being\
  \ of the citizens of Phaeros, and to a lesser extent all of the Everbloom Alliance.\
  \ This is a very diverse group consisting of peace-loving gatherers and crafters,\
  \ hardy adventurers, and stalwart warriors. We have been victorious against several\
  \ attacks by the Elves of the Mordant Spire, and against hordes of Elementals, but\
  \ by far our most ruthless and relentless enemies are the raiders from the Empire\
  \ of Xeilias who attack from the Northern Cragthorns. Although many of us have no\
  \ love of war, we have answered the challenge. Our many victories do little to quell\
  \ the attacks, or to give comfort to those who grow weary of endless war. And yet,\
  \ we do what we must, guarding the precious candle-flame of hope which holds back\
  \ the shadow of despair.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Player Profile: Phyllain</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Every game needs a villain, and the Empire of Xeilias and Golgotha in\
  \ particular have risen to the occasion, giving players a group to strive against\
  \ while providing players who want active PvP an organization that funnels their\
  \ needs into avenues that aren't toxic to the game. Leading this group of miscreants\
  \ is Benevolent Dictator Phyllain, whose journey to leadership was less \"carefully\
  \ planned rise to power\" and more \"last man standing.\" But Phyllain took a situation\
  \ he wasn't necessarily looking for and turned it into a powerful group in the game,\
  \ an empire that players will be striving against for a long time to come.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>Phyllain evades his enemies.</i>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>A brief backstory about Phyllain? This should be fun.</p> \n      <p>It\
  \ all started back in the second Kickstarter. One of my buddies told me about it,\
  \ describing it as \"like EVE Online, with swords.\" I was hooked.</p> \n      <p>We\
  \ originally started The Bloody Hand as an unaligned mercenary group of PvPers focused\
  \ on assassinations and resource interdiction. That dream lasted until we learned\
  \ about the support mechanic. At that point we needed to find a city that would\
  \ be willing to support a bunch of Neutral Evil players, or we'd have to found our\
  \ own. After deciding that it would be too much work to have our own city (oh, the\
  \ irony!) we decided to join with House Karnath and Maelstrom to found Golgotha.\
  \ We almost joined Phaeros at that point, but an actual evil city seemed more attractive\
  \ than a neutral one.</p> \n      <p>So once we formed Golgotha we started talking\
  \ to Callambea about an alliance. We would eventually add Auroral and Kreuz Bernstein\
  \ to this alliance, forming the Empire of Xeilias. At this point I was supposed\
  \ to just be in charge of small-group PvP—bandit-type stuff.</p> \n      <p>As Pathfinder\
  \ Online got closer to Alpha, some of the leadership for the Empire decided the\
  \ game wasn't for them. By the time we reached Early Enrollment, I was pretty much\
  \ the only officer left. That's how I went from being the small-group PvP guy for\
  \ one city to running four cities and an evil empire!</p> \n      <p>For the first\
  \ couple of weeks I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off, managing\
  \ every aspect of everything. It was going ok, but I was burning out fast. At this\
  \ point there was a sort of player intervention where I ended up promoting a bunch\
  \ of people to manage specific aspects of running four cities. People were put in\
  \ charge of recruiting, PvE, production and stuff like that. It reduced my workload\
  \ significantly and let me focus on diplomacy and stabbing people.</p> \n      <p>Around\
  \ this time we abandoned Callambea, Auroral and Kreuz Bernstein. We didn't need\
  \ them and it wasn't worth the effort to do anything with them. We did everything\
  \ out of Golgotha and consolidated. There were a few hold-outs in those cities,\
  \ but for the most part, the people who started those settlements weren't playing\
  \ the game any longer.</p> \n      <p>Eventually we turned that around. Quij joined\
  \ us and picked up Callambea, making it an actual city that could stand on its own.\
  \ We swapped to a coin economy inside Golgotha and recruited Clan Maugrimor, Dreamless,\
  \ and Stach. Those three groups have made Kreuz Bernstein into the best-stocked\
  \ and best-maintained market in the game.</p> \n      <p>That's where we stand today.\
  \ Golgotha stands strong against the combined forces of the Everbloom Alliance.\
  \ Kreuz Bernstein and Callambea are making money off that war handover fist. We\
  \ keep the server interesting. We are pretty much the only group on the server that\
  \ actually starts conflict. Every other group on the map responds to what we do.\
  \ Whether it's coming up and taking us on directly or signing peace treaties and\
  \ sending us bulk goods for continued peace, we are definitely the \"bad guys\"\
  \ of the server. It's a role I love and want to continue.</p> \n      <p>So if you\
  \ want to dive right into PvP, or provide for the war machine and get rich doing\
  \ it, head on over to <a href=\"http://xeilias.com\" target=\"_blank\">xeilias.com</a>\
  \ and put in an application—we will get you going!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n \
