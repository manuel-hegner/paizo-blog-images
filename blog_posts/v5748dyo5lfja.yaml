  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">If you haven't heard, Paizo Publishing will\
  \ release the playtest rules for the upcoming <i>Advanced Class Guide</i> tomorrow,\
  \ Tuesday, the 19th of November. That's ten new 20-level base classes that combine\
  \ features of the existing classes to create innovative options with both unique\
  \ powers and familiar mechanics with novel twists. I'm sure that by the time you\
  \ finish reading through all ten, you'll have multiple character concepts screaming\
  \ to be put on paper.</span></p> \n     <p>These classes are available for use in\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play immediately upon the release of the playtest\
  \ document. You'll need to have a print or PDF copy of the playtest document with\
  \ your character, and you'll need to incorporate any changes established by the\
  \ design team or campaign staff during the playtest as well as once the final versions\
  \ of the class are released in August 2014. <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >The Additional Resources list</a> will have specific details about what is allowed\
  \ in the campaign and should be referenced when creating a character that uses any\
  \ of these classes. Remember that everyone is gaining access to these playtest documents\
  \ at the same time, so be a good roleplaying game citizen and plan to arrive early\
  \ to any game for which you're using these rules so that you can discuss them with\
  \ your GM, help her to understand how the class works, and give a friendly heads-up\
  \ about what your character can do. Sure, you may only have a single class to learn,\
  \ but the GM may have to handle six new classes at once. </p> \n     <p>Also, don't\
  \ forget that in a little more than a week you'll have <a href=\"/products/btpy92ci\"\
  >The Confirmation</a>, a brand new Tier 1–2 Pathfinder Society Scenario designed\
  \ for unlimited replay by 1st-level characters (yep, we extended the level range).\
  \ That sounds like an ideal adventure to test out those new character concepts.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm always excited to see new character options because it gives me\
  \ tons of character ideas. Sometimes I get a cool idea about synergy between feats,\
  \ class abilities, or spells, which leads to a powerful character, but after building\
  \ and playing however many dozens of aspiring adventurers, nobles heroes, and dastardly\
  \ antiheroes, I recognize that sometimes new mechanics are most helpful in designing\
  \ new personalities, backstories, and comprehensive concepts. In fact, some of my\
  \ favorite characters are those that I or a friend built to break the mold of what\
  \ is expected in a class: a barbarian whose rage power choices make her behave like\
  \ a druid who channels elemental power, a \"paladin\" of Cayden Cailean who is actually\
  \ a bard that chose spells to replicate paladin abilities (e.g. <i>remove fear</i>,\
  \ <i>cure light wounds</i>, etc.), and most of all a \"cleric\" of Razmir.</p> \n\
  \     <p>When I play Jokhas, that \"cleric,\" I have two character sheets: a real\
  \ one that records my actual stats (that I show to the GM before the game) and a\
  \ somewhat reflavored one that renames many of my class abilities and spells. When\
  \ Jokhas the priest of Razmir casts a spell that's obviously unavailable to clerics—\
  such as <i>black tentacles</i>—I often get some strange looks before sharing a knowing\
  \ wink with the GM and then explaining in character that Razmir grants all magic\
  \ and transcends the arbitrary limitations set by less caring deities. That said,\
  \ Jokhas (member of the Silver Crusade faction) is also delusional, believing Razmir\
  \ is a benevolent but stern god of glory, love, and prosperity who must regrettably\
  \ strike down nay-sayers to remind mortals that justice is not to be mocked. It's\
  \ usually at the end of the game that I reveal to curious players that Jokhas is\
  \ a witch with a healing patron and has renamed his hexes as \"miracles.\" Of course,\
  \ anyone with Spellcraft can identify Jokhas's renamed spells or make other relevant\
  \ checks to learn about what he's <i>really</i> doing. For Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play, it's important I not change how <i>burning hands</i> works or appears, but\
  \ that doesn't stop me as a player from calling it the fires that destroyed Melcat.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>What's most interesting about playing such a character, though, is that\
  \ it inspires a different mentality in my fellow players. The character is not an\
  \ 8th-level witch with familiar rules mechanics; instead he's a strange and enigmatic\
  \ spellcaster, drawing others' attention to his style and presentation and less\
  \ to the numbers on the character sheet. When he calls on Razmir's blessings, the\
  \ results seem as miraculous to the players as to the player characters. In a way,\
  \ it's one more step toward immersion in the setting and the story.</p> \n     <p>So\
  \ as you explore these ten new classes, don't just limit yourself to considering\
  \ mechanics—though please do provide feedback about balance, flavor, and other features\
  \ important in the playtesting process; let these options inspire you to create\
  \ a truly unique character personality that your region will be talking about for\
  \ years to come.</p> \n     <p>Do you already have such a character?</p> \n    \
