  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">\"\
  For one epoch and one day, the Wardens of the Wild reigned. Where animals and beasts\
  \ disputed or doubted, the wardens quelled their infighting and fortified their\
  \ hearts. Where the wild grew threatened by disaster or development, the wardens\
  \ repelled intruders and restored the world with their vast power. Yet nothing of\
  \ the wild lasts forever—such is not the way of nature.</p> \n      <p>\"When their\
  \ time drew close, the four wardens felt the call. And as they were the stewards\
  \ of the natural world, so too did every animal in their care: those upon the land,\
  \ those within the earth, those under the sea, and those above the sky. The wardens\
  \ converged from their disparate realms upon a single location, tucked away in the\
  \ furthest expanses of the wilds, along with every beast that could make the trip.\
  \ The flocks and schools and herds all came together in a grand convergence known\
  \ as the Migration—every animal, even those so rare they’re thought extinct.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Can you imagine it, Charikleia?\" The naturalist, now much older\
  \ than a boy, put the stone tiles back in their velvet-lined box, the one his grandmother\
  \ had left him. \"Every animal on the planet, all in one place?\" He gazed out over\
  \ the deck of the <em>Zoetrope</em>. Below, the water was so clear you could see\
  \ the eels and fish and rays darting through the coral as the ship neared the coast.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Professor, you're getting off track again,\" Charikleia said with\
  \ as much tact as she could muster, even as her eye caught a majestic lightning\
  \ turtle through the waves. Instantly, her brush was in her hand, capturing the\
  \ turtle’s likeness in her sketchbook for the expedition’s records.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>\"Ah, apologies, got away from myself for a moment.\" Baranthet smiled at his\
  \ research assistant. Though he’d explained their mission as soon as funding was\
  \ secured—long before he’d finished constructing the ship or assembling the crew—\
  he wasn’t sure he’d ever properly told her the story that inspired it all, as he’\
  d originally heard it each year in his youth: Grandmother's story, which he now\
  \ told in her stead.</p> \n      <p>\"When the Migration was complete and the animals\
  \ were gathered, the Wardens of the Wild would select their successors. Some might\
  \ rely on their judgment, while others might hold contests of strength or wit or\
  \ heart, but in some manner, they would choose four new wardens to inherit the mantle.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"And so it was that the little elephant, the rattling snake, the angry\
  \ fish, and the kind butterfly became the four new Wardens of the Wild, growing\
  \ to great size as they were filled with the primal magic of their respective realms,\
  \ over which they reigned for one epoch and one day. And when the Migration came\
  \ yet again, as it must, they in turn selected their four successors before passing\
  \ from the wilds. </p> \n      <p>\"So it was again in the next epoch, and again,\
  \ and again, the great wheel of life turning. And though many consider it a myth,\
  \ some say that out there, somewhere in the last expanses of the world, the four\
  \ Wardens of the Wild yet reign.\"</p> \n      <p>Baranthet’s wistful sigh was drowned\
  \ out by the thrumming wings of the <em>Zoetrope</em> as the ship crossed the water’\
  s edge and began soaring over sand dunes. \"We’re going to find them, Charikleia.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"We have a similar myth back home, though it’s very obscure,\"\
  \ Charikleia said, adding some notes to her sketch as she scratched the base of\
  \ one of her horns. \"Though it’s more common in Earthsong minotaur art to carve\
  \ our stories in stone, rather than tell them in words. All the same, I remember\
  \ seeing a petroglyph depicting four great beasts in the corners of Kortos, though\
  \ the specific creatures differed.\"</p> \n      <p>\"That makes sense, the wardens\
  \ would have changed many times over the ages. Who knows what forms they—<em>AAAAACK!!!!</em>\"\
  \ Baranthet dropped his tea over the side of the railing as a small airskiff buzzed\
  \ past overhead, much too close to the deck, a young centaur man at the helm.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Professor! You should’ve seen the look on your face!\"</p> \n   \
  \   <p>\"Telero, that’s my favorite teacup!\"</p> \n      <p>Telero rolled his eyes\
  \ and gave a half-hearted salute before he kicked a pedal with a hoof, sending the\
  \ airskiff down toward the dunes (far more quickly than necessary) to retrieve said\
  \ teacup. \"Way’s clear up ahead—we should be able to get to the mountains by nightfall!\
  \ It’s a little close to roc territory, though, so if you see a red dye marker,\
  \ that’s too far!\" His voice faded as the airskiff plummeted.</p> \n      <p>Baranthet\
  \ shook his head. \"That boy will be the death of me.\"</p> \n      <p>\"He’s an\
  \ excellent scout, though.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Indeed.\" Baranthet turned to pick\
  \ up his book. \"Why don’t you get the rest of the crew together in the galley—\
  we can make a plan for surveying the area when Telero’s back.\"</p> \n      <p>Charikleia\
  \ closed her sketchbook and stowed her brush with her usual quietness, ducking inside\
  \ carefully to avoid scratching the <em>Zoetrope</em>’s doorframe with her horns.\
  \ Baranthet stayed on the deck a little longer, though. The naturalist took in the\
  \ sights as he reached out a hand, feeling the warm wind rush through his claws.\
  \ Below him, the land stretched out, far from Droon, far from Absalom, far from\
  \ anywhere he knew, rolling outward until it blended into the horizon. </p> \n \
  \     <p>While he and the crew had already seen amazing beasts and breathtaking\
  \ views on their journey, the Wardens of the Wild were yet to be found. But Baranthet\
  \ had a good feeling. For though he wasn’t quite as adept at hearing the stars as\
  \ his grandmother, he had a bit of her ear, and for the shortest of seconds, he\
  \ thought that he heard it resound across the land, somehow clear over the <em>Zoetrope</em>’\
  s wings—</p> \n      <p>The howl of the wild.</p> \n      <br> \n      <p>To read\
