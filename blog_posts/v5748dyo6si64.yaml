  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi, everyone! Paizo invited\
  \ me to write a guest blog to announce the newest project from Campaign Coins. <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/campaigncoins/pathfinder-coins-of-absalom\"\
  >Coins of Absalom</a> is now live on Kickstarter! At Campaign Coins, we have been\
  \ making coins for years. We’ve had a blast making licensed <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/byCompany/c/campaignCoins/pathfinder\"\
  >Pathfinder hero point tokens and pins</a>, but this is our first full set of currency\
  \ for use in Pathfinder campaigns.</p> \n      <p>Andre started our company because\
  \ he thought it would be much cooler to have actual treasure on the table rather\
  \ than just recording your wealth on a character sheet. He was so right! It makes\
  \ finding loot far more rewarding, and a player can estimate what equipment and\
  \ magic items they can afford easily by counting their gold by hand! At Campaign\
  \ Coins, we love party shopping sessions.</p> \n      <p>For our first Pathfinder\
  \ coin range the obvious place to start was <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens\"\
  >Absalom, City of Lost Omens</a>. All adventurers come here to make their fortunes\
  \ or disappear into the nearby Abomination Vaults. We suggested that the gold coins\
  \ could represent the key landmarks of the city, and it was marvelous working with\
  \ Mark Moreland, Paizo’s Director of Brand Strategy, who suggested the best architecture\
  \ for us to use.</p> \n      <br> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  > </p>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>Our coin designer, Brian Patterson,\
  \ took inspiration from the coin illustrations by Anthony Pratt in the sourcebook\
  \ and expanded them into to work for a larger set. Each coin has a unique shape\
  \ so that you can tell them apart, and as they rise in value, they get bigger. All\
  \ coins except the ones that represent 1 gp have a clear denomination on the back.\
  \ It’s probably true that in Golarion the coins wouldn’t have numbers (they don’\
  t have ATMs, after all), but the inclusion of this detail makes it easier for players\
  \ to track wealth at the table. </p> \n      <p>We’ve curated a number of coin sets\
  \ to assist at different levels of play, and each set has a mix of coins designed\
  \ to make it easy to make change at the table. The <b>Inns of Absalom set</b> has\
  \ a range of copper and silver coins in 1 and 5 denominations. Once you have 10\
  \ coppers, change up to 1 silver, and the same with silver to gold. The coins in\
  \ this set are perfect for food and lodging. The <b>Markets of Absalom set</b> has\
  \ low-gold denominations in 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s and 20s, which can serve as ideal loot\
  \ for early adventures and help characters purchase more equipment and starting\
  \ magic items. The <b>Trademaster of Absalom set</b> represents the highest values\
  \ of treasure with 50s, 100s, 500s and 1,000s, for when the adventurers start bringing\
  \ in bigger hauls.</p> \n      <p>We honestly can’t wait to see these in action\
  \ in Pathfinder games and have a range of stretch goals planned as we explore Absalom\
  \ together. (No surprise that our favorite district is The Coins!) <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/campaigncoins/pathfinder-coins-of-absalom\"\
  >Coins of Absalom</a> will be on Kickstarter until November 23, 2022.</p> \n   \
