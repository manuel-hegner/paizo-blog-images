  \ Society Organized Play, Part VIII: In the Secrets of the Past Come Tomorrow's\
  \ Triumphs</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 9, 2011</p> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/Osirion_big.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/Osirion_med.jpg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <p><i>Osirion is among the oldest human\
  \ nations of the Inner Sea region—its founding marked the end of the Age of Anguish.\
  \ Over its long history, it has experienced centuries of incredible power as well\
  \ as generations of subjugation under foreign rule, as its ancient might was lost\
  \ to desert sands and forgotten with the passage of time. With ambitions of once\
  \ again being the most influential and powerful nation in the Inner Sea region,\
  \ Osirion knows that Absalom is its largest competitor for the position. So while\
  \ the nations of Andoran, Cheliax, Qadira, and Taldor battle among themselves for\
  \ control of the City at the Center of the World, Osirion delves deep into its history\
  \ to resurrect the secrets of the past. As a sleeping giant, it amasses its power\
  \ to swoop down on its unsuspecting enemies when they have weakened one another,\
  \ using the strength of history to secure its future dominance.</i></p> \n   <p>Whether\
  \ it's the faction's Egyptian inspirations or it's unassuming <i>modus operandi</i>,\
  \ Osirion has been one of the most popular factions since the earliest days of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play. In many ways, this faction's ideals fall most closely\
  \ in line with the baseline mission of the Pathfinder Society, and that's not changing\
  \ with Season 3.</p> \n   <p>Back in the fall, we tried something new: We started\
  \ introducing faction leaders as NPCs and plot elements within scenarios beyond\
  \ just signing their names at the bottoms of faction mission handouts. And we began\
  \ with Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage, head of the Osirion faction. As far back as\
  \ PaizoCon 2010, there were hints that not all was as it seemed with the Sapphire\
  \ Sage, and with the onset of the Shadow Lodge conflict, his part in the overall\
  \ metaplot was revealed.</p> \n   <div align=\"right\"> \n    <table border=\"0\"\

  center\"></td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n   </div> \n   <p>I know\
  \ not everyone has played the scenarios in question, so I won't post any spoilers\
  \ (and I ask all comments below to use spoiler tags as necessary) but I will say\
  \ that observant Osirian players may have noticed their missions are coming from\
  \ some lowly scribe named Otoneraphim of late. The subplot with Amenopheus will\
  \ be resolved at PaizoCon in the two-part Tier 1–7 series <i>Shadow's Last Stand</i>,\
  \ so you've got a little over a month to catch up on past installments in this story\
  \ before the \"season finale\".</p> \n   <p>As part of the increase in metaplot\
  \ within the campaign, more venture captains and faction heads will play larger\
  \ roles in scenarios during the Year of the Ruby Phoenix, and many of the faction-specific\
  \ metaplots will involve their respective faction heads. I'm eager to hear what\
  \ people think of this, and specifically how you have or haven't liked the way we\
  \ used Amenopheus as a major player this season. Stop by the Pathfinder Society\
  \ section of the messageboards and make your opinions heard!</p> \n   <p>Next week\
  \ we'll continue looking at some of the campaign rule changes in store for next\
  \ season, specifically those dealing with prestige. The following Monday, we'll\
  \ look at another of the 10 factions, but which one depends on you. We're just a\
  \ few fans away from hitting 4,000 followers on Facebook; if you, the fans, can\
  \ spread the word and help us add 250 new fans before the end of the week, I'll\
  \ move one of the five new factions up in line and make it the following week's\
  \ blog topic, revealing its symbol as an even earlier preview.</p> \n   <p style=\"\
