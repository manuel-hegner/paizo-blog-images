  \ back to Seattle with Syrinscape for <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2017</a>. Syrinscape\
  \ has had such huge growth over the last twelve months and we are keen to hang out\
  \ with our best most devoted fans at PaizoCon, and we've got some really great plans\
  \ for our stay too.</p> \n    <p>Probably one of the most fun things we did last\
  \ year was our search for the perfect Green Dragon for the beloved <a href=\"/products/btpy9pvj?Syrinscape-Dragons-Demand-SoundPack\"\
  ><em>Dragon's Demand</em></a> module, so this year we are amplifying this to the\
  \ max. This year we are going to put absolutely everybody who gives a voice into\
  \ a great big <em>Shoggoth SoundSet</em>. You know, CR 19... blow your brain away,\
  \ kinda thing! Think the Borg, with green tentacles.</p> \n    <p>I am also running\
  \ sound for a few of the celebrity events, don't miss <a href=\"/events/v5748mkg0butb\"\
  >\"Celebrity Gaming with Amber E Scott\"</a>. Game Master Greg Vaughan and I have\
  \ been scheming to make life maximally difficult for this great panel of star players.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'll be talking at a seminar about immersion, which promises to be really\
  \ interesting, and doing sound for a game of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons</a> with the actual lead developer running the game. How cool is\
  \ that?!</p> \n    <p>Most excitingly however are the little surprises we have in\
  \ everybody's PaizoCon welcome bags. Long story short, this March I visited the\
  \ Paizo offices in Seattle. As well as talking business, dreaming and scheming about\
  \ Syrinscape's new Starfinder SoundSets, and playing a fantastic game of Pathfinder,\
  \ I also grabbed Jason Bulmahn and James Jacobs, put them in a quiet room and had\
  \ some fun building a couple of SoundSets. As a result of the madness and much giggling\
  \ that went on in that room, I'm now very pleased to present you with two new NPCs\
  \ to use in your Pathfinder games. With James Jacobs we built a fantastically colorful\
  \ Tavern Keep, a purveyor of comfortable accommodation, useful information and food\
  \ and drink of questionable quality. Perfect for any Fantasy adventure that begins\
  \ in a Tavern. We can't imagine when that might be useful. Jason Bulmahn brings\
  \ you his notorious Priest of Razmir, a terrifyingly convincing rendition of these\
  \ usurious, dishonest, blackmailing charlatans. If Jason ever starts a religion,\
  \ run for the hills.</p> \n    <p>These have turned out so well, I couldn't resist\
  \ taking it one step too far. Yup, stick-masks for everybody. I dare you, load up\
  \ the Razmir Preist on your phone and proselytize to the poor unsuspecting hotel\
  \ guests at the Hilton. Or hold whole conversations between twin Tavern Keeps. Most\
  \ importantly, I want photos!</p> \n    <p>So, if you're lucky enough to be at PaizoCon\
  \ this year, do make sure you drop by the Syrinscape stand and shake my hand, give\
  \ your voice, share a laugh and generally geek out with me and the Syrinscape team\
  \ about the game I love most of all, Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p>Also... can't WAIT\
  \ for Sunday's Pathfinder Society Special!</p> \n    <p>Ben Loomes<br> <i>Creative\
