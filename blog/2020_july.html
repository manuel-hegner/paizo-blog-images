                <p>“And you say they’re all connected, Miss…”</p> 
                <p>“Ah, it’s Mrs. Kavint. Roverrint may be gone, gods bless him, but he lives on in my heart and in my mind and I remain a faithful woman.” Another grimace. “Yes, I’ve done the work to prove everything that I can to show that—”</p> 
                <p>“You understand that you’re accusing Queen Abrogail of high treason,” Toulon interrupted, “and that such accusations don’t come lightly, right?”</p> 
                <p>“Y-yes, very much sir, but it’s all there! The Queen sent her foolish cousin to incite the rebellion in Kintargo while secretly supplying the rebels with weapons and supplies. It was her idea to destroy the Menador Keep! Do you think the rebels had the means to do that on their own? Of course not! And then I heard that one of those other Hellknights used it as a cover to fake her death. Trust me. I’ve found the connections and I can see…”</p> 
                <p>“Mrs. Kavint, that’s quite enough. I believe you. This evidence isn’t airtight, but there’s a lot here we can work with.” Toulon stood from his desk and walked to the door. “I greatly appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and I promise to put our resources toward investigating this further. I’ll have one of my knights escort you out.”</p> 
                <p>Mrs. Kavint sprung to her feet with a speed in stark contrast to her age but then immediately returned to the same hobbled walk she used to enter the office. Toulon made sure to not let on that he noticed the irregularity.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>“Thank you so much, Lictor. You won’t regret this. Cheliax will learn the truth and you’ll be a hero. The people need to know.” She reached out for his hand. “Thank you, thank you!”</p> 
                <p>“Yes, of course, Mrs. Kavint.” He pulled his hand back from the woman’s tight, sweaty grip. “You have a good day.”</p> 
                <p>Toulon returned to his desk and opened the report once again. <em>There’s definitely something here</em>, he thought to himself, attempting to shake the woman’s sweat from his hand. His flicks of the wrist did nothing, and as he reached for a handkerchief he noticed it wasn’t sweat at all, but some kind of thick mucus, probably due to her illness. <em>Disgusting.</em></p>

                <p>“Presenting, Lord Roverrint of Belde!” announced the guard.</p> 
                <p>An old man hobbled into the throne room. Abrogail watched as he continued his pathetic entry and she soon grew tired of waiting. “Paraduke Thurivan claims you have important information for me,” she yelled out as he continued his approach. “Know that I bestow you a great honor in just allowing you entrance in my palace. Now, what have you brought for me?”</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b2c52717-5bb7-4c6a-a434-10bea265b2dd/073020_abrogailthrune.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="350" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b2c52717-5bb7-4c6a-a434-10bea265b2dd/073020_abrogailthrune.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Queen Abrogail Thrune II stands holding a longsword once belonging to a paladin of Iomedae.

                <p>Lord Roverrint removed his hat and gave a slight bow to Abrogail. “My queen, I wish to thank you for your generosity. My family and the people of Belde believe you to be a just queen and—” </p> 
                <p>“Out with it, Lord Roverrint,” spat Abrogail.</p> 
                <p>“Yes, my queen. I believe that the Order of the Scourge is plotting against you. I believe that they mean to depose you with claims that you’ve committed treason against Cheliax.”</p> 
                <p>“Lord Roverrint, if I had to accept audience for every rumor of action against my throne, I would never leave this room,” Abrogail replied with contempt. “What evidence do you have of these claims?”</p> 
                <p>“I have acquired a copy of the material that they plan to use as evidence against you, my queen.” The old man produced a folio from within his robes, brimming with papers and scrolls.</p> 
                <p>“Bring it here, Lord Roverrint.”</p> 
                <p>“Of course, my queen.” Just as he began to step forward, he entered a coughing fit that echoed throughout the throne room. Abrogial watched on in disgust for a moment before sending Gorthoklek to fetch the folio. The pit fiend’s steps reverberated like massive boulders colliding against the ground, each step wreathed in the crackle of flames. He plucked the folio from Roverrint’s trembling hands and returned to his place beside the throne. Gorthoklek leafed through the pages in an instant and then produced an audible huff before closing the folio.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>“Gorthoklek tells me that some of this evidence is flimsy. In fact,” she smiled, “he believes that attempting to use some of this will actively hurt their case and put them in an incriminating position. Well done, Lord Roverrint.”</p> 
                <p>Recovering from his fit, Roverrint replied in a strained voice. “Thank you, my queen. I wish only what is best for you and Cheliax. Now, is there a possibility of a reward?”</p> 
                <p>“Yes, of course.” Abrogail waved over a guard. “See to it that Lord Reverrint receives a handsome reward for his loyalty to Cheliax and his queen. That will be all.”</p> 
                <p>Abrogail stared off in the distance as the guards escorted Roverrint out of the throne room. <em>Damned Touloc. He definitely has something here</em>, she thought to herself as the throne-room doors closed.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>A wild cackling echoed through the abandoned home. “Yes, it is all done, Chemurr.” Mrs. Kavint threw herself to the ground beside Lord Reverrint. “The Great Master’s will is done.” </p> 
                <p>Chemurr gave a pleased smile. “Very well. Kavint, Roverrint, you have earned a few minutes to speak with the master.” Chemurr extended her hand and several thick, slimy phlegm worms crawled out from her sleeve. The worms crawled forward, up toward Kavint’s and Roverrint’s ears. The two let out a terrible wail, one part agony and one part pleasure, as they collapsed in a writhing pile, calling out for the Great Master.</p> 
                <p>“The knights and her queen shall begin to play, and soon will we see who has the will to stay.” A phlegm worm writhed about between Chemurr’s fingers. “All while the Great Master watches and laughs.”</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p>Over the past year or so, people have become increasingly aware that Beadle and Grimm aren’t just random names we invented for marketing purposes – they were actual characters that we played and loved for many years. </p> 
                 <p>With that awareness came a lot of questions – who were they? Where did they adventure? What heroic feats did they accomplish? And we found ourselves struggling to provide good answers. The passage of time made names and dates hard to remember, and we often found ourselves mixing up one adventuring party with another. What we were missing, we realized, was a book where all of our journeys and exploits were immortalized – a sort of scrapbook for those characters and the lives they lived. And that’s where the Complete Character Chronicle was born.</p> 
                 <div class="blurbCenter">
                  <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/98e3b6c5-8bfa-4d3f-8344-94c10422be45/073020_BeadleGrimm.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="70%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/98e3b6c5-8bfa-4d3f-8344-94c10422be45/073020_BeadleGrimm.jpg" alt="A mockup of Beadle and Grimm's of the Complete Character Chronicles book"></a>

                 </div> 
                 <p>We had always wanted to work with Paizo, so we set up a meeting and pitched them the idea. What if you could have a single book that contained everything about one character, from birth to death? It would need to be part journal, part character record, part scrapbook, and would also need to contain the key reference pages from all the core rulebooks, so that you’d have every rule, feat and spell right there at your fingertips. Would they allow us access to all their rules, all their best art, and all their newest updates, so we could make this the best character book of its kind?</p> 
                 <p>Thankfully, their answer was “Yes”. In fact, it was “Hell yes, and how can we help?” which is about the best thing you can possibly hear. Now we’re working like mad to live up to that promise. We want this to be the best character journal that you’ve ever seen. We want it to be epic. We want it to be Platinum, because that’s what your character deserves.</p> 
                 <p>We’re grateful to Paizo for welcoming us into their family.

                 <h3>Building a Legend</h3> 
                 <p>In the square of a chilly town, a girl stares at a board so covered in pamphlets and cutouts that she can scarcely see the wood underneath. “Protect a caravan from troll attacks, slay a dragon, guard the baron’s son from assassins at the summer ball… I don’t think I’m up for any of these.” In her pocket, a painted metal egg flaps filigree wings, flitting to the bounty board and knocking gently at a worn paper barely visible under an advertisement for a wandering circus. “Retrieve a missing necklace, last seen in the town sewers…” the girl reads with a note of confidence, “I think I could manage this!”</p> 
                 <p>“If you’re going into the sewers, be sure to watch out for otyughs. Nasty fever,” a strange voice echoes from the girl’s ankles. When the girl sees its source—a small humanoid plant that appears to bleed red sap from a dozen cracks on its uncanny wooden body—she spins around in fright, sending a pulse of frosty magic into a nearby abandoned barrel. The discarded object rushes to life, scrambling on newly grown fowl’s legs to put itself between the girl and the plant.</p> 
                 <p>“No need for that,” the leshy says, “Name’s Hau. Doctor of Pharmacology.” He opens the gourd that serves as his head and retrieves a certification and several vials. “In any event, I was looking at that job too, and thinking I could use a partner. Care to join? I can inoculate us against the otyughs ahead of time.” He squeezes an extract into one of the vials with a fizz. </p> 
                 <p>The girl looks at the array of tools and substances that the small doctor measures before her with wonder, “Where did you learn such advanced techniques?”</p> 
                 <p>“Oh, you know,” Hau says, “I studied for a time in Rahadoum, under a brilliant scientist.” He eyes the objects still dancing strangely around the girl. “And where, pray tell, did you pick up such unconventional magic?”</p> 
                 <p>“Oh, you know,” Ivy says, letting the flying egg land in her palm, “from my grandmother.”</p>

                <h3>Guide Updates</h3> 
                <p>Today marks the first day of Gen Con Online, which means the launch of <a href="http://www.paizo.com/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society Year 2: Year of Corruption’s Reach</a>. A new program year means a new guide. This year, instead of dropping the guide the first day of Gen Con and hoping people can access and incorporate the information into their characters, we are going to release the guide updates next week. There are no major changes to the program, just some streamlining of processes and adding clarifying language around sections that seemed to cause some confusion for our players. </p> 
                <p>The same holds true for the Starfinder Society guide. Unfortunately we weren’t able to issue this one when the Year launched in June. It’s ready now and will be available for download next week. The new version incorporates new Faction goals and an updated Story So Far. The big program change in <a href="http://www.paizo.com/starfindersociety">Year 3: Year of Exploration’s Edge</a> is the phasing out of boons on chronicles. We are using this year to prepare for the launch of Achievement Points in Year 4.</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society guide changes involve adding adventurer’s decks to the guide. Other than that, the program is continuing the same as we start <a href="http://www.paizo.com/pacs">Year 7: Year of Reborn Strife</a>.</p> 
                <p>The biggest change is a revamp to how we are titling the guides. To avoid confusion with the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0233q?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide"><em>Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a> (releasing in October) and to add cohesion to the Paizo Organized Play program as a whole, the guides will now be <em>Guide to Organized Play</em>. We are also dropping Roleplaying Guild from the names of the Pathfinder Society and the Starfinder Society. These are small naming convention changes that bring cohesion to the idea of Paizo Organized Play and society play as a whole! We’ve included links to each of the guides below and plan to have them updated by next Thursday’s blog.</p>

                <h3>ESCAPING GRAVITY — CR 7</h3> 
                <p>Singulos is a kasathan solarian dedicated to the negative aspects of the Cycle; convinced that black holes and singularities will inevitably triumph over the birth of new stars, he has forsaken many solarian beliefs and trained a generation of followers. Traditional solarians—covertly backed by the Idari—have sought Singulos for years, but it was the Stewards who finally caught him hiding on a remote planet in the Vast. Now he’s aboard a Steward prison ship called the <em>Harrowstone</em>.</p> 
                <p>But Singulos has many followers, and they’re determined to break him free. They’ve attacked the <em>Harrowstone</em> and killed most of the crew; the remainder, led by Third Officer <b>Daneel Ris</b> (LG female human), are holed up in the passenger section of the ship. </p> 
                <p><b>A Singular Notion</b>: If you have played through A Singular Notion, “Escaping Gravity” follows when solarians from the Aphelion board the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section. If you have not used that encounter, the player characters are the nearest ship when the <em>Harrowstone</em> is attacked. Officer Ris begs them for assistance. “We have a very important prisoner on board here, and I think these creeps are trying to break him out. There’s only a few of us left... please help us!”</p> 
                <p>The player characters arrive through an airlock (area <b>A</b>). Singulos is kept prisoner in a large room on the middle of the western edge (area <b>B</b>), and his followers arrived through the hole in the ship in the southeast and have spread to the southwest. Officer Ris and the remaining Stewards are trapped behind a large door (area <b>C</b>), safe but unable to assist the PCs. Other rooms in the emergency section—lit by red lights—contain prisoners. They are unarmed and not a threat, and largely unfriendly to anyone they meet, but one room with 8 prisoners is on fire (area <b>D</b>); see Hazard, below.</p> 
                <p><b>Hazard</b>: Fires have broken out throughout this section of the ship. Characters entering a square that is on fire take 4d6 fire damage (DC 17 half) and are at risk of catching fire (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 403). One of the rooms containing prisoners is on fire (area <b>D</b>); their pleas for help can be heard by anyone in the red-lit areas of the map. There are 8 prisoners in this room; if not rescued, 2 of them fall unconscious from smoke and flame every turn. Once all of them have gone unconscious in this way, the cries for help cease. If they remain trapped within the burning room, two of these prisoners die every round.</p> 
                <p><b>Creatures</b>: Four solarians have reached the critical section of the <em>Harrowstone</em>. Unlike other solarians, they have forsaken photon revelations and cannot supernova. The stat block provided below is for human solarians; for enemies of other species, replace their Stealth skill and Close Combat feat with new racial abilities.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c3d61873-2720-4350-8a85-491e1306814b/072920_SolarianDarkWeapon.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c3d61873-2720-4350-8a85-491e1306814b/072920_SolarianDarkWeapon.jpg" hspace="5" align="left" alt="A human man in ceremonial black and gold armor wields a spear made of dark energy."></a>

                <p>If Singulos’s followers succeed in breaking down his door, he emerges, a kasatha dressed in dark blue, purple, and black and surrounded by an aura of crackling power.

                <p itemprop="description">Greetings from the heart of the Inner Sea—the shining city of Absalom! It has been a stupendous day, and a rogue blackmailing a tavern owner would be hard-pressed to have filled her cup with more ale than I filled today with sights and sounds the likes of which I had never imagined. I’m sitting down for the first time since I got off the boat, if you’d believe it, to pen this letter to you all to be sent out tomorrow.</p> 
                <p>Sailing into Absalom’s harbor was an experience. I stared up, wide-eyed with childish delight, white-knuckled from gripping the portside rail as we passed ever so gingerly through a reef of sunken ships beneath the watch of Absalom’s walls. Fort Tempest on the western bluff looked like an ugly duckling with its two-toned fortifications, like mismatched building blocks set together by a titan’s toddler. I also couldn’t help but notice the floating prison—the so-called Black Whale—half a dozen grounded ships all lashed together. It seems the city reminds me at every opportunity to watch myself, lest I become a more permanent resident (in less than ideal living conditions)!</p>

                </div> 
                <p>I’ve been parked at a tavern here in the Precipice Quarter for the past hour, and you’ll love the name: the “Tipsy Tengu”. The halfling owner has opened the place up to adventuring parties, and the ruckus, storytelling, and drinking has me tempted to ask if any are in need of a well-trained lockpick and confidence woman. All of those adventurers are here for a reason: Absalom has abandoned, treasure-filled siege castles dating back thousands of years spread all around its as-yet-impenetrable walls! How amazing is that?! Just outside the city walls and even running beneath it in Desna-only-known how many unmapped and abandoned tunnels, there’s a veritable adventurers’ playground!</p> 
                <p>Adventuring wouldn’t have me clapped in chains like crime within the city walls would, and I’ve had my ears chattered off by a bird—Runkles the Raven, the self-proclaimed flashiest familiar in the city—for the past twenty minutes trying to convince me of the benefits of joining an adventuring group. His mistress’s party is looking for a rogue to raid a particular siege castle, and I’m genuinely tempted to take them up on the offer. But first I need to get a better feel for this city and weigh my options. I don't know if treasure hunting on the city’s outskirts is any more or less safe than my usual work among the tourist crowds milling about, awestruck and not paying attention to their purse strings.</p> 
                <p>I spent most of the day walking through the city, its wide streets crowded past what I thought possible: every flavor of ancestry and culture from across the Inner Sea and beyond, all simmering in this great big stew of a divinely reclaimed island. I let my ears soak everything in, picking out anything on the locals’ tongues to guide my feet. I overheard a pair of street vendors talking about how they’d managed to raise prices due to the Radiant Festival. Now I’m well versed in history, but I’d never heard of this festival before, so I purchased a meat pie from one flashy cart called Mamma Middlepidge’s Delights and asked about it. I had planned to take advantage of the influx of potential marks in the wake of Absalom’s victory over the Whispering Tyrant’s failed siege, but what I’ve learned of the Radiant Festival has me giddy as a werebear in a trough of honey.</p> 
                <p>Apparently, thousands of years ago an evil wizard called Kharnas the Angel-Binder (pleasant sounding fellow, I know!) laid siege to Absalom. Since his defeat, they’ve celebrated each centennial with this grand festival. And oh my, do they go all out! They took the formerly abandoned, monster-haunted Precipice Quarter and remade it as the grounds for the Radiant Festival itself. All new buildings, pavilion grounds, exhibits, merchants, and crowds, crowds, crowds! It was all designed by a famed Absalomian architect by the name of Blune Bandersworth. Here’s the rub though: the entire district was literally a ruin-strewn waste filled with ravenous undead and monsters wandering up from who knows where beneath the city and here in less than a year it’s the newest, grandest part of the city and it’s hosting a massive festival! I don’t know how he did it. Neither does anyone else. It’s as if he conjured it from the ether by magic!</p> 
                <p>I’ve seen almost too much today to describe it all. The crowds were thick and at first I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see much, but I wasn’t prepared for the sheer size of some of the exhibits! The ground trembled and I looked up as I entered the festival grounds and beheld a gigantic walking castle. Can you believe it? A Keleshite palace on great mechanical legs with people on the ramparts waving down at me, colorful banners fluttering in the breeze high overhead. That was just the first of the wonders I saw, and it wasn’t even the largest of them!</p> 
                <p>A block away, surrounded by an even larger crowd, was a gigantic beast of a machine called Graveraker. Set up on giant metal treads with a huge drill and whirling scoops, it’s the largest construct that I’ve ever seen! The festival is here to display marvels of ingenuity, art, and craftsmanship, and I wonder what this one will be used for. Perhaps it was used in the remodeling of the district from its previously ruined state? Based on the name itself, I figure that maybe they intend to use it to excavate and loot the treasures buried within the ruin and rubble of the Cairnlands, or even Tyrant’s Grasp? I’ve no idea, but the longer I looked at the menacing contraption, the more I couldn’t help thinking that should it ever be turned to war it could surely eat any random building and still be hungry, or feast upon the walls of any city—Absalom included!</p> 
                <p>What caught my eye most though was a building still being completed: a massive Minkaian pagoda fashioned like a great dragonfly. And the construction workers: a gang of kobolds! Absalom attracts all types, and as an outsider it makes me feel all the more welcome to see them skittering about, employed and accepted like anyone else!</p> 
                <p>The Precipice Quarter would seem reborn, though not completely. Not to one with as discerning a gaze as me. It’s a fresh coat of paint over a mostly rebuilt fence, but if you look hard you can spot the rotten posts. The local Edgewatch has done a good job of making sure that folks are safe, and <em>feel</em> safe, even if certain areas are blocked off and still ruined out of sight of the general public. Those blocked off areas? They’ve posted guards and I’d swear that they’re there not to prevent anyone from outside sneaking in but to keep something inside from getting out… It’s a grim thought to be certain, but even if the threat of hungry undead seems mostly reduced to ghost stories, the crowds here have absolutely attracted an altogether mundane threat, but one I’m much more familiar with: thieves and confidence artists.</p> 
                <p>All this time I’d been on the watch over my own purse because the crowd attracts that element. I mean, I’m that element myself! So it was just by happenstance that this plump, bearded banker of Abadar walks past, all sure of himself and the security of the city. In the space of a heartbeat some large bird I couldn’t see through the throng let out a squawk, distracting the gilded cleric, and I see a devilspawn woman walking the other way lift his coin purse with the tip of her tail, real smooth-like. In a city of strangers, she was a strange one: horns, goat legs, tail, all that racket. Well that priest, he didn’t notice a thing, just kept walking. For her part, she walked straight up to a stall selling strange figurines that could have been shrunken corpses for how real they looked and bent over the wares. Some Gebbite selling stuff to Urgathoans or somesuch. But I digress.</p> 
                <p>So, of course I walked over and introduced myself just as she slid the pilfered purse into the pocket of her cloak with the tip of her tail. I didn’t directly mention the theft, but asked about “career opportunities” in the area and she caught my meaning. Nisha Starweather was her name. She snagged us drinks and snacks from Pelmo’s Pickle Hut, likely with the very money she’d taken off the Abadaran just moments before. We talked for a bit and watched a number of other pickpockets ply their trade—and watched nearly as many busted by the Edgewatch. They were doing a genuinely good job of it. Sadly, I figured pretty quickly that Nisha wasn’t the foot in the door I’d hoped for. She was recently arrived herself, visiting from what she described as “nowhere remotely close to this place.” I think she might have slipped a bit and started to say “plane”, not “place”, but I could have just misheard her among the din of the crowd. Anyway, she said she was in town hoping to meet up with an old friend who might be showing up herself in the next while.</p> 
                <p>While she wasn’t going to be the in I needed to set up a burgeoning career in the city’s criminal underworld, she was the one who suggested the Tipsy Tengu, since the place catered to adventurers at night. She said I might make friends and ask around for a place to stay. A lot of the inns I’ve passed today have hung a no-vacancy sign, with the city packed to the brim with visitors, and it’s dangerous to wander about any city at night, especially as a visitor, so it’s a genuine concern and that has occupied my mind for much of the evening.</p> 
                <p>Desna smiled on me, though!</p> 
                <p>In the midst of my first drink, wondering if I’d spend the night sleeping on a roof or in an alleyway, a bar fight broke out! This drunken halfling insulted this one hammered Chelaxian, calling her a “devil licker” and she retorted with a local slur against halflings, and that started it. She got clocked, he got kicked in the face, and their respective companions launched into the fray. It would have gotten worse if not for the Edgewatch showing up and intervening with magic to hold the combatants in place and a smooth bit of diplomacy to calm everyone down. That would have been the end of it, until that Chelaxian woman shrugged off the spell. She would’ve stabbed the watch sergeant if not for quick thinking by this half-orc next to me at the bar who stood up and, cool as could be, crashed her stool over the “devil licker’s” head.</p> 
                <p>Things calmed down after that, and I paid the chair-wielding hero’s tab. Ralso, her name was, and before she left for the evening, she gave me a business card with the address of a hotel called the Dreaming Palace. She said it had empty rooms if I were in need. The place looks fancy—sounds fancy, too, like maybe Desna’s blessed it or something. In any case, it should solve my housing problem, if only for the moment, before I figure out what to do next. Do I lapse back into the life of crime that saw me exiled from all of you in the first place, or instead turn to the life of heroic sanctioned robbery and murder of an adventurer? A good night’s rest in my new palace of dreams and I’ll figure that out while I explore the wonders of the Radiant Festival over the course of the next few days. I’ll be sure to keep you all apprised of my decision (and other craziness of the big, scary city). Until then, there are wonders to see and I’ve eyes to gander with! </p> 
                <p>May Desna smile on you all,</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Lem cleared his throat, and Merisiel guiltily ceased fiddling with her dagger, giving her full attention to the halfling standing on the table in front of her.</p> 
                <p>“<em>Now</em> can we get started with my plan?” he asked.</p> 
                <p>The two adventurers were holed up in a tiny inn in Almas, and thanks to Lem, every inch of their room was covered in paper. Books sat in high piles on the room’s only table, alongside spent ink bottles, quills, and, of course, sheets and sheets of parchment. But it wasn’t the pages of transcriptions and doodles on the table that concerned Lem now, so much as the ones displayed upon the wall.</p> 
                <p><em>His plan.</em></p> 
                <p>It was essentially a collage—sheets and scrolls to match the scraps around the room—pinned precariously between the chamber’s two sputtering torches. Every inch of paper had notes, names, commentary, and observations scrawled across them, and most of these were pinned beside illustrations that Merisiel had to assume were related. A few maps and blueprints, charcoal rubbings, and pictures torn from books—but most of the images were clearly quick sketches of people, in Lem’s familiar style. The only structure to these focal points came from a handful of strands of crisscrossing, multicolored yarn, pinned down from picture to page and beyond, intersecting here and there like a haphazard spiderweb. It looked like the kind of thing a mad servant of Rovagug might call art—but to her, it just seemed like a cry for help.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>“So,” he asked, lifting his bushy eyebrows. “What do you think?”</p> 
                <p>Merisiel took a deep breath, before finally asking the question she’d had since first boarding a ship for Andoran. </p> 
                <p>“What is all this about, Lem?”</p> 
                <p>To his credit, the halfling only faltered for a moment, a flash of disappointment as he scratched at the side of his head and his eyes flitted back and forth between his “plan” and the elf he’d roped into helping him with it. He lowered his hands, nodded, mumbled something under his breath so low even Merisiel’s keen ears couldn’t hear it clearly, and then met her concerned gaze with a solemn one of his own.</p> 
                <p>“As I said…I believe that there is a ring of Chelish spies at work here in Almas, a secret conspiracy of infernal agents subtly working to influence Andoren politics…and we are the only people who can stop them.”</p> 
                <p>“No, I mean—what does all <em>this</em> have to do with ambushing a Chelish spy?” the elf asked, shaking out a few loose strands of her long silver hair.</p> 
                <p>She glanced up at the wall again. She supposed now she could understand a little bit more of it; most of the map-scraps involved the border between Andoran and Cheliax, and there were a few infernal symbols and sketches of Hellknights. At least Lem’s paranoia made sense—he’d been raised a slave in Cheliax, after all. </p> 
                <p>“It all started,” Lem said, and there was a flash of performance in his tone, the spark of heraldry that usually only came out in the midst of battle. “When an old friend from the Bellflower Network reached out…”</p> 
                <p>The halfling indicated one of the doodles pinned to the wall. He began to speak at length about his old friend, a former slave, who had noticed certain Andoren merchants seemed to be making double their usual shipments…and all of them suspiciously close to the Chelish border.</p> 
                <p>“Her intel of course connects to Step Six of my plan,“ he poked at a different section of the wall. “Wherein, hopefully, any decoy Chelish caravans have already been waylaid by members of a certain halfling ‘legitimate business organization.’”</p> 
                <p>Merisiel was still seated, but she was trying to appear fully invested, even as her fingers fiddled with the dagger hilts protruding over her shoulder from the brace on her back.</p> 
                <p>“Legitimate…” she murmured, then brightened. “There’s a halfling mafia?”</p> 
                <p>“No,” Lem said, frowning. “But just in case, don’t ever mention them again.”</p> 
                <p>Without missing a beat, he charged back into his plan, jumping from point to point across the papers with no truly discernible pattern. One moment he’d be explaining how he’d mapped out town guards’ patrol routes, then he’d leap to a note about the weather along the border.</p> 
                <p>Although Merisiel had only just arrived in Almas, Lem had been lurking in the city for over a month. He’d eavesdropped on merchants and mercenaries, paid off Chelish expatriates, and pumped sympathetic Andoren warriors for intel—usually in disguise. The little bard had been busy with every manner of espionage at his disposal, and all of it had been for the sake of building an excruciatingly elaborate plan that, at least as far as Merisiel could tell, really only amounted to “ambush.”</p> 
                <p>The rogue felt her attention straying. Trying to keep her mind occupied, she flipped a knife around deftly, using its deadly point to clean beneath her fingernails. She grimaced at some of the filth she found there, and hastily wiped the dirtied blade off on the closest scrap of parchment. </p> 
                <p>Lem hadn’t noticed, still jabbering excitedly:</p> 
                <p>“…and thanks to the help of that poor hellspawn trader—no friend of the Chelish, unsurprisingly—we know exactly which coach our suspected spy will be driving.”</p> 
                <p>Merisiel looked up at him. “So then we catch it, and stab them?”</p> 
                <p>“No, no, no,” Lem said with a sigh. “We will already be lying in wait, assuming we leave tonight. Remember Step Thirty-four?”</p> 
                <p>Merisiel failed to subdue a groan.</p> 
                <p>“What?” asked Lem, blinking, genuinely perplexed.</p> 
                <p>“It’s just…” Merisiel trailed off awkwardly. She began digging her knife through some folded-up parchment, gently scoring the wood beneath.</p> 
                <p>“Where did I lose you? Step Fourteen, with the carriage switch? Or Step Twenty-nine, where Valeros and Kyra help us rig traps at the abandoned border checkpoint?”</p> 
                <p>Lem was pointing down at the table with a frown, where his friend’s knife was digging nervously into the parchment. Merisiel’s cheeks actually reddened a little as she saw that she had indeed scratched a line over a few scrabbled words, including “western border” and “abandoned checkpoint.” She cleared her throat and casually spun the knife before plunging its blade fully into the wood of the table, as if to say, “I meant to do that.”</p> 
                <p>“It’s not the, uh, overall plan, Lem,” she started, sighing. “Clearly you’ve been busy as a bugbear at a baby shower, but it all seems a bit…convoluted?”</p> 
                <p>The halfling gaped at her</p> 
                <p>“It just seems like it doesn’t require thirty-four—“</p> 
                <p>“Thirty-<em>seven</em>,” Lem interjected.</p> 
                <p>“—Thirty-seven steps! And we’ll follow you on all of ‘em. But doesn’t it all add up to: hide, wait, and then jump ‘em?”</p> 
                <p>Merisiel gestured toward the madcap collage of yarn, paper, and pictures, the books and debris strewn about the room, and finally, at Lem. The halfling was working himself into a lather over concocting the perfect scheme, when—at least as far as she was concerned—all they really needed was a head start and a little luck.</p> 
                <p>She rose from her seat, shaking her head softly, trying to meet his eyes under his mop of blond hair. </p> 
                <p>“You’ve planned enough,” Merisiel said, her tone steady and confident. “We’re ready.”</p> 
                <p>“Meri, this is Cheliax—it’s serious. If I’ve missed even one detail, misunderstood or forgotten one scrap of information—“</p> 
                <p>“You haven’t!” the rogue declared with an assuring smile, clapping her hand to his shoulder. “I mean, look at all this! You’ve thought this through from every angle.”</p> 
                <p>She deftly snatched blades from her dagger brace, and, one by one, with impossible swiftness, she tossed them at the wall—each one landing home on an illustration.</p> 
                <p>“We leave now—“</p> 
                <p><em>THUNK.</em></p> 
                <p>“We stay ahead of the spy—“</p> 
                <p><em>THUNK.</em></p> 
                <p>“We meet Kyra and Valeros—“</p> 
                <p><em>THUNK.</em></p> 
                <p>“And we stage our ambush before they cross the border.”</p> 
                <p><em>THUNK. THUNK. THUNK.</em></p> 
                <p>Lem looked at the circle of daggers embedded in the wall, watching as Merisiel strode over to the plan, withdrawing her knives one at a time. By the time she’d finished and turned back, he was grinning along with her. For the first time since the planning began, the halfling seemed like his old, confident self.</p> 
                <p>“I think you’re right,” he said with a cocky little grin. “I <em>have</em> thought of everything.”</p> 
                <p>Lem reached onto the table and plucked Merisiel’s last dagger from its resting place, tossing it back to her. She caught it deftly, and the two of them set about gathering their gear, ready to set off without looking back.</p> 
                <p>Unnoticed on the table, the scrap of paper Merisiel had been stabbing, no longer pinned, unfurled from the many folds and creases it had earned. Around the scratches, stains, and bits of under-fingernail dirt, text was clearly visible, a note hastily passed on to Lem by a terrified hellspawn trader—</p> 
                <p>“Along the western border, you’ll pass a single abandoned checkpoint…”</p> 
                <p>And beneath it, previously obscured by the parchment’s folds, the words continued— </p> 
                <p><em>“Avoid it at all costs.”</em></p>

The upcoming 2nd-edition update is one of the largest single print projects we’ve ever attempted at Paizo, with about a thousand pages represented between the 640 page Adventure Path (compare that to, say, the 432 pages in the <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> hardcover compilation), the 128 page Companion Guide (which brings in all 12 companions from Owlcat’s computer game version of <em>Kingmaker</em>), and a pair of Bestiary companions to help folks run the Adventure Path using 1st edition Pathfinder rules or even 5E rules.

                 <p>Unfortunately, the magnitude of getting this all done means that we’re not going to have it out for folks anytime soon. At this point, we’re targeting a release sometime in the second half of 2021—we’ll keep everyone updated as we get closer to the finish line, of course, but until then, work proceeds apace, with it being pretty much the only thing (other than meetings and product approvals) that I’m focused on right now.</p> 
                 <p>As soon as I’m done writing this blog post, I’m jumping right back in to development—I’m midway through Chapter 7: Blood for Blood, working my way through Fort Drelev. I’ve finished development on the Kingdom management rules, the Settlement building rules, and the narrative Mass Combat rules. We’ve got over 300 pages of content in edit as I race to stay ahead of that curve.</p> 
                 <p>But there’s more than words in an adventure, and now we come to the exciting part of this blog post! We’re ordering a mountain of new art for this project, both to illustrate scenes and characters and creatures we didn’t have the budget or time or pages to do in the first printing of Kingmaker a decade ago, along with lots of art for brand new content that’s never before seen print.</p> 
                 <p>Some of that art’s already coming in, in fact, as you’ve no doubt already noticed! </p> 
                 <p>First, we’ve got an image from the new introduction to the Adventure Path, based on the prologue from Owlcat’s version of the game when the brand-new PCs gather at Lady Jamandi Aldori’s estate for a feast and to be assigned their charters for exploring the Stolen Lands. Of course, even at first level, Amiri’s not gonna take any guff from midnight killers trying to ambush her while she’s resting up from a night of feasting! </p>

                 <p>And speaking of Lady Jamandi, we’ve got a brand new illustration of her—she’s essentially your patron for the first part of this entire campaign, and her role throughout the Adventure Path is a bit more involved... unless, of course, the players at your table decide to cut ties with Rostland and go off on their own to build a kingdom. It is a sandbox campaign still, after all!</p> 
                 <p>Being able to finally illustrate a certain enormous and angry owlbear in his own illustration had to happen, obviously.</p> 
                 <p>And finally, have a mutant chimera that may have gotten a bit too close to a volatile mix of planar energies from the First World and the Abyss. I won’t tell you where this last critter shows up, but he’s certainly a handful!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">This playtest presents two new options: the nanocyte class and the mech combat subsystem. The nanocyte is a cunning combatant who houses a host of nanites in their body. Using their nanite array, they can confound foes, spontaneously create equipment, and reinforce their own bodies, and specialized nanocytes can even stitch wounds, dissolve into nanite swarms, and shred foes with a cloud of microscopic assailants!</p> 
                <p>If bigger is better in your playtest, then strap into a mech! Mechs are specialized vehicles operated by one or more pilots, each of which contributes to the giant robot’s actions. Much like building a starship, you create your own mech (or mechs), allowing you to customize your frame, limbs, armaments, and more! Mechs operate on the familiar square grid maps, so although they’re bigger and more powerful than PCs usually are, many of the rules for using them are familiar, and many of the same foes are appropriate challenges.</p> 
                <p>This playtest is your chance to get a look at early versions of these new options and have a hand in their development before they hit shelves next year!</p> 
                <h3>Playtesting the Class and Mechs</h3> 
                <p>The <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em> Playtest launches today, <b>July 27, 2020</b>, and runs through <b>September 18, 2020</b>. So how can you help playtest this new class and new mechs? First, download the free PDF of the <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution Playtest</em> from <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">starfinderplaytest.com</a>. Then make up some characters or mechs using the new rules. We're most interested in feedback from actual play, so it's best if you can get some friends together and play a few sessions using these new options. If possible, make up characters at different levels and mechs at different tiers to get a sense of how they work at different points in their careers. There's no accompanying playtest adventure—you can use the new class in existing adventures like Starfinder Society scenarios or Starfinder Adventure Paths, and both the new class and mechs are a great fit for adventures or mock combats that you create yourself. It might be helpful to take some notes during play, so you can remember your thoughts on the experience after the game session. To gather the most useful data for this playtest, we ask that you avoid using house rules and play these characters using only published rules from the Starfinder RPG. </p>
                <h3>Playtesting in the Starfinder Society</h3> 
                <p>Players participating in <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety">Starfinder Society Organized Play</a> can also join in the worldwide playtest to test the nanocyte class. From now until the playtest's completion, players can create custom nanocyte characters of levels 1, 4 and 8. These custom characters use many of the same rules as pregenerated characters, though the Organized Play team has slightly relaxed the rules in order to encourage playtesting these new classes. For more information, check out this <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shbj">blog</a> about using the nanocyte in Starfinder Society.</p> 
                <h3>Surveys</h3> 
                <p>Our primary means of collecting feedback for the playtest is through surveys that we would like everyone participating in the playtest to complete. There is one survey for the nanocyte class and a separate survey for mechs, so please fill out the survey for the new option you play. If you get the chance to try out both, that's great! But it's okay if you can only play one or the other—just fill out the relevant survey or surveys. Links to the surveys can be found on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">playtest page</a>. Please make sure you've filled out your surveys by <b>September 18, 2020</b>.</p> 
                <p>In addition to responding via the surveys, you can engage with other players and designers on the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/playtest">Playtest forums</a>, discussing the new classes and possibilities for the future. While we want to focus on actual play feedback, we're interested in hearing all of your ideas about the classes. What are your thoughts about the playtest? Do you have any questions about the playtest process? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

                </div> 
                <p><b>Playtest Period</b>: The availability for these rules runs from the publishing of this post until the end of the playtest period (September 18th, 2020.) Once this period has expired, players can no longer use the Starfinder Tech Revolution Playtest class until the publication of the book in 2021.</p> 
                <p><b>How It Works</b>: We're opening up Society play for the playtest class via the use of custom-created characters that operate much like our pregenerated characters. We believe this should encourage players to test the waters with custom builds, be it with current scenarios or through our growing stable of repeatable options.</p> 
                <p><b>Creating a Playtest Character</b>: Prior to playing a scenario in the playtest period, a player can determine if they want to playtest the new class. Depending on the tier of the scenario, the player can then use a 1st-, 4th- or 8th-level character using the nanocyte class presented in the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest"><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em> Playtest</a> and created using the following guidelines:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Class</b>: The character must have all levels in the nanocyte class. Although multiclassing ramifications are important for the playtest as a whole, we're keeping to single classes in the organized play portion of the playtest for simplicity.</li> 
                 <li><b>1st Level</b>: The character can be created using the character creation rules presented in the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> and <em>Guide</em> to <em>Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em>.</li> 
                 <li><b>4th Level</b>: This character follows the same rules as above, except it can select one 4th-level armor or weapon and one 3rd-level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 4,000 credits on other available equipment.</li> 
                 <li><b>8th Level</b>: This character follows the same rules as above, except it can select one 8th-level armor or weapon and one 7th-level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 18,000 credits on other available equipment.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p><b>Credit</b>: The credit earned for playing a playtest character follows the same rules and guidelines as presented on page 7 of the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society</em>. This means that you must choose which of your characters will receive the credit at the beginning of the adventure. Credit must be assigned to characters of lower level than the playtest character. </p>
                <p><b>Resolving Conditions</b>: We recognize that players taking the opportunity to playtest these characters are performing a service for the game and campaign. As a result, whenever a player playtests a 4th- or 8th-level version of these characters, the cost to purchase a <em>raise dead</em> is reduced to 6 Fame and subsequent restorations to remove the negative levels are only 1 Fame each. This means that there's still some risk to your established characters, but the penalty for dying as a playtest character is far less onerous than it would be for a normal character or pregenerated character.</p> 
                <p><b>Applying Credit</b>: As we want to encourage extra play of the higher-level versions of the nanocyte, we're also going to open up the rules for applying credit when playing a playtest character. A player using a non-1st-level playtest character may choose to apply the earned Chronicle Sheet to an existing Organized Play character. To do so, simply replace the credits earned on the Chronicle Sheet with credits from the list below that match the level range of the existing player character.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Levels 1-2: 720 credits (2,160 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> 
                 <li>Levels 3-4: 1,460 credits (4,380 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> 
                 <li>Levels 5-6: 4,085 credits (12,255 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> 
                 <li>Levels 7-8: 5,835 credits (17,505 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p><b>Mechs</b>: Organized Play does not have a direct connection with the mech playtest that is occurring simultaneously with the nanocyte playtest. However, we strongly recommend that members of the Paizo Organized Play community get involved with testing the new mech system and providing feedback. We’ve made sure that the mech survey captures Organized Play member involvement, so we can further analyze the impact our community has on these various playtests.</p> 
                <p>With all this in mind, we encourage our players to take an active part in the playtest, both by sharing your opinions online in the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/playtest">Playtest forums</a> and by completing the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">playtest surveys</a>. We hope that by opening up the means in which players can create and customize characters for the playtest, that we can see some unique and fun builds using this new class and that such tests will provide the design team with priceless "field agent" feedback!</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>I look forward to hearing from each of you about your experiences with the <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em> nanocyte class and am even more excited to see this class join the roster of Starfinder classes officially in 2021.</p>

                <p>To help out with that, I’ve put together a brief little encounter in Qahir Palace, home of Satrap Xerbystes II, his wife Shahiyan Deena al-Parishat, and his vizier Hebizid Vraj. The palace is located in Katheer, capital of Qadira. For this encounter, the PCs have earned the right to visit with Satrap Xerbystes. Perhaps the PCs are here for a diplomatic endeavor to win the satrap’s favor. Maybe the vizier called them to the palace to task them with an important mission. It could also be that the PCs won Deena’s attention after a notable horse race. Whatever the case, the PCs are now in the royal palace and, of course, things are about to go wrong.</p> 
                <p>The encounter below is for 9th-level Pathfinder characters. First, let’s take a look at the map. The map is of a large Qadiran palace that has lots of room for intrigue, stealth, and of course, combat. Feel free to use this map as you like in your own game, sprinkling in encounters, traps, and more as you see fit. Today’s encounter takes place in the throne room, but could totally spill out into the rest of the palace!</p>

                <h3>Qahir Palace</h3> 
                <p>This luxurious palace serves as the home for Xerbystes II. The palace itself is relatively small compared to others throughout the Padishah Empire of Kelesh, but remains impressive nonetheless. The palace is lit with bright light throughout the day and the guards that patrol the palace use personal torches after dark. The palace ceilings rise to a height of 20 feet on the first floor and are only 10 feet high on other floors.</p> 
                <ol> 
                 <li><b>Palace Stairs</b>: These fine, marble stairs lead up to the palace.</li> 
                 <li><b>Bazaar</b>: Shahiyan Deena al-Parishat allocates this space for local merchants to sell their wares. She specifically selects merchants with unique or high-quality items in an attempt to showcase Qadiran crafting skill.</li> 
                 <li><b>Entryway</b>: This grand domed arch serves as the palace entrance. The pair of guards posted here make sure to only allow expected guests inside and also keep an eye on the bazaar.</li> 
                 <li><b>Barracks</b>: The palace guards sleep here between shifts.</li> 
                 <li><b>Stable</b>: Deena keeps a number of her prized mounts here as this stable offers better defenses than the stable on the palace grounds. The staircase leads down to the armory landing (room 23).</li> 
                 <li><b>Meeting Chambers</b>: Xerbystes and Hebizid use this chamber for meetings with diplomats and other guests. </li> 
                 <li><b>Courtyard</b>: This open-air garden offers a break from the cramped quarters of the palace.</li> 
                 <li><b>War Room</b>: Xerbystes uses the table’s illusion magic to discuss battle strategy with his advisors.</li> 
                 <li><b>. Storage</b>: Palace staff keep food and other supplies here. The staircase descends down to the additional storage (room 26) and the rest of the basement.</li> 
                 <li><b>Throne Room</b>: Xerbystes holds court in this large chamber. A secret door on the back wall allows Xerbystes to slip away to other floors in times of danger. Spotting the door requires a successful DC 25 Perception check, though a specialized mechanism prevents immediate use for the door. Xyrbestes, Deena, and Hebizid all know the required method of using the door and can do open it with a single Interact action. Anyone else will need to succeed at three total DC 30 Thievery checks to Disable the Device that locks the door. The secret passage leads up to the secret chamber connecting the royal bedroom (room 19) and the basement tunnel (room 29).</li> 
                 <li><b>Servant’s Quarters</b>: This are the resting quarters for the palace staff.</li> 
                 <li><b>Kitchen</b>: The palace staff are available at all hours to make a meal here.</li> 
                 <li><b>Dining Hall</b>: Xerbystes holds regular dinners here for guests. The palace staff use the smaller tables as serving tables during meals.</li> 
                 <li><b>Bathing Room</b>: This is Deena’s personal bath.</li> 
                 <li><b>Shahiyan’s Chambers</b>: This are Deena’s personal quarters.</li> 
                 <li><b>Office</b>: Deena uses this office when writing letters and other messages.</li> 
                 <li><b>Vizier’s Chambers</b>: Hebizid stays in these chambers and uses the connected office for his work. </li> 
                 <li><b>Vizier’s Office</b>: Hebizid uses this office for his work. </li> 
                 <li><b>Royal Bedroom</b>: This are Xerbystes’s personal quarters. A secret door connects to hidden chamber. Locating and using the door uses the same rules as the secret door in the throne room. </li> 
                 <li><b>Lounge</b>: Xerbystes relaxes here during evenings, usually with Deena or Hebizid as a companion.</li> 
                 <li><b>Bathing Room</b>: This is Xerbystes’s personal bath.</li> 
                 <li><b>Stairwell</b>: This staircase leads down to the main hallway between the servant quarts and the kitchen, allowing the staff quick access when tending to royal needs.</li> 
                 <li><b>Armory Landing</b>: This small landing contains a staircase that connects to the stable (room 5) upstairs.</li> 
                 <li><b>Armor</b>: The palace guards keep their equipment and extra gear in this room.</li> 
                 <li><b>Guard Lounge</b>: The palace guards relax here when off-duty or taking breaks. Extra beds are kept here to support additional guards during important events.</li> 
                 <li><b>Additional Storage</b>: The rest of the palace storage is here and connects with the storage upstairs (room 9).</li> 
                 <li><b>Library</b>: Xerbystes keeps notable reading material and important documents such as financial records here.</li> 
                 <li><b>Royal Treasury</b>: This room holds the palace’s treasure. A guard stands at the entryway at all times of the day.</li> 
                 <li><b>Basement Tunnel</b>: This secret tunnel connects to the other secret chambers on the above floors. Locating and using the doors that connect to this tunnel uses the same rules as the secret door in the throne room.</li>

                 <p>“You have a chance to meet with Qadiran royalty. Upon being ushered into the palace, you make your way into the grand throne room.”</p>
                </blockquote> 
                <p>A local pro-slavery group, the Burning Sands, has grown upset at Deena’s continued abolitionist stance and have decided to put an end to the abolitionist decrees coming from the palace. The group recently learned of the PC’s visit to the palace and recognized that it would serve as a perfect distraction for their attack on the palace so they can put an end to Xerbystes and Deena.</p> 
                <p><b>Creatures</b>: The members of the Burning Sands are disguised as staff and roaming the throne room. A servant notices one of the assassins drawing their blade. Her scream alerts the room and Xerbystes (or the appropriate person) immediately slips into the secret chamber behind the throne room, escaping to safety. It’s up to the PCs to fend off the assassins! 1d4+1 rounds after the combat begins, a squad of palace guards join in to assist the PCs. </p> 
                <h4>Burning Sands Assassins (4) — Creature 8</h4> 
                <p>Assassin (<em>Gamemastery Guide</em> 211)<br> <b>Initiative</b> Deception +12</p> 
                <br> 
                <h4>Qahir Guards (4) — Creature 5</h4> 
                <p>Elite Palace Guards (Bestiary 6, <em>Gamemastery Guide</em> 211)<br> <b>Initiative</b> Perception +14</p> 
                <p><b>Treasure</b>: Once the PCs deal with the assassins, they earn the satrap’s thanks. In addition to a hefty gold reward of 900 gp, Xerbystes offers the PCs a particularly unique gift. His palace spellcasters have developed a method that can infuse an animal companion with elemental power, converting the animal companion into a genie-touched companion. He is willing to have his spellcasters use this technique on the PC’s companions or grant them one of these companions as a gift.</p>

                <h3>A SINGULAR NOTION — CR VARIES</h3> 
                <p>This encounter is Average difficulty for a group of PCs flying a tier-8 starship, but your PCs may be higher or lower in level. A Singular Notion is an Easy encounter for 9th-level PCs, Challenging for 7th-level PCs, Hard for 6th-level PCs, and Epic for 5th-level PCs.</p> 
                <p>The player characters are traveling through the Drift when they receive a distress signal.</p> 
                <blockquote>
                 <p>“This is an emergency transmission from the Steward vessel <em>Harrowstone</em>. We have been attacked by kasathan pirates and have sustained serious damage. Our power core has been destroyed and our thrusters are non-functional. We are in need of assistance. Please, if you can hear us, this is the Steward vessel <em>Harrowstone</em>...”</p>
                </blockquote> 
                <p>The <em>Harrowstone</em> can be detected on sensors; it is a Large freighter outfitted as a prisoner transport. It has indeed lost all power and is floating helpless in the Drift amid clouds of time-eaters, a bizarre hazard unique to the Drift (see below). Player Characters who communicate with the ship will be answered by Third Officer <b>Daneel Ris</b> (LG female human), who is doing her best in a very difficult situation. “If you can rendezvous with us,” she says, “our modular passenger section can disconnect from the ship and attach to your vessel. You mind giving us a ride home?” A PC suspicious of officer Ris and who succeeds at a DC 22 Sense Motive check can tell she’s hiding something. If pressed, Ris admits, “We have a very high-profile prisoner on board, a kasathan cult leader who calls himself Singulos. I think the attack might have been an attempt at a jailbreak, I don’t know.”</p> 
                <p>If the PCs agree to help the <em>Harrowstone</em>, place the prison ship in the middle of a starship combat map and place the PC starship along a short edge. The few remaining Stewards aboard the <em>Harrowstone</em> have already separated the passenger section from the rest of the ship and stand ready with a docking clamp to attach to the PC starship.</p> 
                <p><b>Hazard</b>: This region of the Drift is infested with time-eaters, who have gathered together into massive colonies known as ganglions. Time-eater ganglions and many other space hazards are detailed on pages 134-137 of the <em>Starfinder Starship Operations Manual</em>, but the rules for time-eater ganglions are briefly summarized here. </p> 
                <p>Place 6 time-eater ganglions on the map, each occupying 1-3 hexes. They move toward the nearest starship 3 hexes every round at the start of the Helm phase. A ganglion that ends its movement next to a starship, or when it shares its space with one, tries to grab it; the pilot can avoid this with a successful Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 x the starship’s tier). Starships grasped by the ganglion lose shields in a random quadrant; if that quadrant’s shields were already depleted, the ganglion consumes the ship’s time energy, reducing the ship’s speed by 2 for 1d4 rounds. For the duration of this effect, the ganglion moves 1 additional hex. This effect is cumulative, to a minimum starship speed of 0 and a maximum ganglion speed of 10 hexes, and the duration is refreshed each time a ganglion grabs the starship. A ganglion can be targeted by starship weapons and has an AC and TL of 15. If a ganglion takes a total of 20 damage per hex it occupies, it breaks apart into individual time eaters, harmless to starships.</p> 
                <p>Third Officer Ris urges the PCs to hurry, saying, “That kasathan ship could be back any minute!” If the PC starship reaches the <em>Harrowstone</em>, the crew aboard it attach their drifting section of the ship to the PC starship at the beginning of the next Engineering Phase. </p> 
                <p><b>Starship Combat</b>: On the third round or as soon as the Harrowstone’s passenger section attaches to the PC starship (whichever comes first), another starship enters from a long edge of the map. “Look out!” Ris says over the comm, “that’s the same ship that attacked us before! They must have repaired whatever damage we were able to do.”</p> 
                <p>The new arrival is the <em>Aphelion</em>, an Idaran Thunderbolt crewed not by kasathan pirates, but by solarians intent on the rescue of their cult leader, Singulos. The Thunderbolt is a small but advanced kasathan design specialized for boarding enemy starships. The Thunderbolt is detailed on page 95 of the <em>Starfinder Starship Operations Manual</em>; its statistics are duplicated below and its special abilities summarized, but for full details see the <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>.</p> 
                <p>In battle, the <em>Aphelion</em> fights the PC starship while launching its breaching pod at the Harrowstone’s passenger section, attached to the PC vessel. The passenger section has an AC and TL equal to 15 + the Pilot ranks of the pilot aboard the PC starship; it has no shields. If the PC starship is grabbed by time-eater ganglions, the <em>Aphelion</em> maneuvers to take advantage of this, attacking through a lost shield.</p> 
                <p>A PC Engineer can attempt to extend the ship’s shields over the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section, protecting it from attacks. This requires a successful Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 the tier of the PC starship) and reduces the PC starship’s shields by half. As long as the PC starship has shield points remaining in a given quadrant, the <em>Aphelion’s</em> breaching pod cannot hit; a lost shield, however, leaves the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section vulnerable in that quadrant.</p> 
                <p>If the <em>Aphelion</em> cannot land its breaching pod on the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section, it attempts to ram, boarding on a successful hit. The <em>Aphelion</em> has a boarding party of 16 individuals, carried in the ship’s passenger seating, but only 8 fit in a breaching pod.</p>

                <p><b>Breaching Pod</b> The <em>Aphelion</em> can fire its breaching pod as a seeking weapon. It can only hit a target if the shield in that quadrant has already been lost. If it does hit, the boarding party within the pod boards the PC vessel. If it does not hit, it drifts in space and can be recovered by the <em>Aphelion</em> after combat is over.</p> 
                <p><b>Ramming</b> The <em>Aphelion’s</em> pilot can attempt to ram during the Helm phase, as a stunt. This requires a successful DC 24 Piloting check. The Aphelion’s Turn increases by 2, but the ship can enter the same space as the PC starship and attack the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section with its ramming prow, requiring a gunnery check against AC. On a hit, the <em>Aphelion</em> deals no damage to the PC starship, but it takes 4d4 damage to its front quadrant, ends its movement, and can board the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section. If the PC starship is Medium or smaller, it moves 1 hex in the direction the Aphelion is facing; if the PC starship is Large or larger, the <em>Aphelion</em> moves back 1 hex and is still facing the target.</p> 
                <p><b>Development</b>: If the crew of the <em>Aphelion</em> successfully board the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section, looking for their leader Singulos, move to the tactical encounter “Escaping Gravity” (appearing on the Paizo Blog next week).</p> 
                <p><b>XP</b>: Use the table on page 390 of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> to determine the appropriate XP for this encounter, based on the encounter’s difficulty.</p>

                <h3>Free RPG Day Sanctioning</h3> 
                <p itemprop="description">This year’s delightful Free RPG adventures, Pathfinder Adventure: Big Trouble in Little Absalom and Starfinder Adventure: Skitter Home are sanctioned for use in Paizo Organized Play programs as of their release date of Saturday, July 25th, 2020. Sanctioning guidelines and chronicle sheets will be uploaded to the product pages before then.</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder players may use one of the five provided pregenerated kobold characters, applying credit to one of their characters as per the standard Society rules. Once the Advanced Player’s Guide releases (July 30th), players may create kobold characters for Society play, including using them in Free RPG day adventure.</p> 
                <p>The Starfinder adventure utilizes either Skittermander Society characters of fourth level or one of the four provided pregenerated skittermanders. If using a pregen, credit application follows Starfinder Society guidelines. Remember that Starfinder Near Space provides character options for use in building new skittermander PCs!</p> 
                <p>There are a few restrictions for when and how Free RPG Day adventures. These are different than in prior years, to take into account social distancing due to Covid-19:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>GMs are permitted to run on a VTT for their local group, provided they get a physical copy from the store and are only running for local players.</li> 
                 <li>Once the scenario is released digitally on paizo.com in August, anybody may run it online or in-person for whomever wants to play!</li> 
                 <li>As always, you can get credit for the scenario twice: once as a player and once as a GM.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <h3>Achievement Points Update</h3> 
                <p>This morning, the last piece of the AcP puzzle fell into place and we turned on boon purchasing. You will now see a full list of purchasable Character Options on the Boon tab of your My Organized Play page. While our intention is to rotate boon options out, with the delay in launching AcP we intend to keep this first batch of boons until the end of the year. We may add to the options, but we won’t take anything away without plenty of warning towards the end of the year.</p> 
                <p>To help you navigate through the new features, we’ve put together a description of the information found on several tabs of your My Organized Play page, followed by a list of anticipated FAQ. If you have a question that isn’t answered below, please post it in the comments and we will get it answered, as well as including it on future iterations of the FAQ.</p> 
                <h3><em>Sessions Tab</em></h3> 
                <p>Your Sessions Tab holds a display of every game you’ve played, and that GMs reported by Paizo.com. We’ve listed a breakdown of the columns below:</p> 
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                 <li><b>Date</b>: when the session took place</li> 
                 <li><b>GM</b>: the GM’s name</li> 
                 <li><b>Scenario</b>: the scenario, module or AP volume you played</li> 
                 <li><b>Points</b>: the base value of the adventure, including GM credit and AcP. (This AcP value is not necessarily what you earned!)</li> 
                 <li><b>Event</b>: the event this session took place at</li> 
                 <li><b>Session</b>: the session number assigned to the table.</li> 
                 <li><b>Player</b>: Your Organized Play ID #</li> 
                 <li><b>Character</b>: the character that received credit for this session</li> 
                 <li><b>Faction</b>: the faction that character earned reputation with</li> 
                 <li><b>AcP Earned</b>: The amount of AcP you earned, after applying any multipliers from a Premier or Premier Plus event to the base value earned</li> 
                 <li><b>Prest/Rep</b>: Reputation or Prestige earned from this session</li> 
                 <li><b>Notes</b>: Any other notes added by the system</li> 
                </ul> 
                <h3>Boons Tab</h3> 
                <p>This is your Boons tab, where you will spend your Achievement Points. At the top, you will see how much AcP you have to spend. To purchase, select the character you are purchasing for with the dropdown at the top of the screen, then click “Purchase” on the right side of the screen.  </p>
                <p>After you purchase a boon, it will be available for download beneath the available boons. It is a downloadable PDF, which you can keep for your records and/or print out, per campaign guidelines for providing supporting documentation.</p> 
                <p>Characters may have only one ancestry boon. Ancestry boons may be added to a character who has chronicles assigned but not applied. Other boons may be added at any time as long as language in the boon does not specify otherwise. Guide 2.0 will include language about applying AcP boons. </p> 
                <p>Boons must be purchased in between scenarios, to not slow down gameplay. </p> 
                <h3>Achievement Points Frequently Asked Questions</h3> 
                <p><b>Can I change my ancestry and background with one of the rebuild boons?</b><br> It depends on the rebuild boon. Rewrite History permits you to change Ancestry and Background. This boon phases out of use August 31, 2020. Career Change and Evolving Destiny do not.</p> 
                <p><b>Can party members help purchase the Second Chance boon?</b><br> Party members may contribute gold to any costs incurred as part of the resurrection ritual. They may also sell the deceased characters’ items to help contribute to the cost if the player consents.</p> 
                <p><b>What does unlocking access to items mean?</b><br> When you have access to an uncommon or rare item, you can purchase it at its listed price. You can also purchase the formula for these items you have access to from the Pathfinder Society at the same price as a common formula of the same level. Only the PC with the relevant boon attached gains access to this item.</p> 
                <p>Formulas for items which limit how many a character may obtain are not available. </p>
                <p><b>What does unlocking access to spells mean?</b><br> Having access to an uncommon or rarer spell means that your character(s) can learn the spell in the same way they learn other spells, provided they meet all prerequisites. A character must have access to the spell to learn it from another character that knows it. Only the PC with the relevant boon attached gains access to this spell.</p> 
                <p><b>What spells are available with the Esoteric Spellcaster - Core Rulebook boon?</b><br> The spells available are: <em>circle of protection, discern lies, drop dead, ethereal jaunt, false vision, globe of invulnerability, hallucinatory terrain, locate, magic aura, mind blank, mind reading, nondetection, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, protection, spell turning, stone tell, or undetectable alignment</em></p> 
                <p><b>What items are available with the Avid Collector - Core Rulebook boon?</b><br> The items available are:<em> aeon stone (clear spindle), aeon stone (dull gray), aeon stone (gold nodule), aeon stone (lavender and green ellipsoid), aeon stone (lavender ellipsoid), aeon stone (orange prism), aeon stone (pink rhomboid), aeon stone (tourmaline sphere), bloodletting kukri, brooch of shielding, cape of the mountebank, channel protection amulet, chime of opening, clandestine cloak, dancing rune, dragonslayer’s shield, elven chain, floating shield, forge warden, greater disrupting rune, holy prayer beads, invisibility potion, katana, katar, keen rune, kukri, mending lattice, oil of animation, oil of keen edges, panacea, potion of tongues, ring of counterspells, spell-storing rune, spiked chain, or swift block cabochon</em></p> 
                <p><b>What do I do if I have errors in my reporting?</b><br> First, check with the GM or event coordinator to see if they can correct it. If not, reach out to your local Venture-Captain or email issues to <a href="mailto:pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com">pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com</a>. Please include photos or scans of the chronicle relating to the game with the error to make correcting info easier and faster.</p> 
                <p>We hope you are as excited in utilizing the AcP system as we are. We thank everyone for your patience as we worked through the bugs and got the system set up. </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p></p>
                <blockquote>
                 Ehu Hadif Ko’ra Amares of Clan Tolar steps into the office. His office now, he realizes, and smiles slightly. The newly-elected First Seeker sits behind the desk and brings up the data display, reviewing the mission information he’d already read countless times already at his temporary lodgings. The information detailed two important missions that had come to his attention in the immediate aftermath of his formal elevation and ceremony with the amalgam intelligence known as Guidance.
                 <p></p> 
                 <p>First, Ehu Hadif re-reads the request for assistance from one of the Veskarium’s highest members of government, High Despot Jularaz the Frozen, known as the senior political representative of the fringe Veskarium world of Vesk-8. The appearance of a message bearing his seal of office had at first surprised the new First Seeker. Ehu Hadif reads the message for the seventh time, trying to find some hidden meaning in the request for a Starfinder Society investigation of a strange anomaly on Vesk-8. No matter how many times Ehu reads the message, he always feels he’s missing some key piece of context and that the Society might be walking into a political trap.</p> 
                 <p>Bringing up the second mission report, Ehu smiles, knowing that it was already handled and doesn’t require his immediate attention. After some misunderstandings over the past few years, the Aballonian corporation, Resurgent Technologies, had reached out to Ehu Hadif in hopes of working with the Society on a new-generation starship. Not only had Celita of the Dataphiles and Fitch of the Wayfinders managed to handle the initial negotiations with Resurgent Technologies, but Fitch offered to join a group of Starfinders sent to retrieve a Resurgent Technologies scientist needed to complete the project from a research outpost in the Vast.</p> 
                 <p>Ehu flips back to the data from Jularaz the Frozen’s office and once again debates how to respond. Opening more ties with the Veskarium would have untold value to the Starfinder Society. However, Jularaz’s ruthless reputation, as well as the generally antagonistic approach of many Veskarium officials, is known and something Ehu must consider before sending Starfinders into a potentially dangerous situation. The First Seeker wonders if the benefits of improved relationships outweighed the risks of getting embroiled in Veskarium politics.</p> 
                 <p>He stares through the holographic data stream, but then his eyes catch something on the desk: a simple white envelope. Closing the data stream with a swipe of his upper arms, Ehu carefully grabs the sealed envelope with his lower limbs. Delicately breaking the wax seal, he reads the short words printed in ink on the paper within.</p> 
                 <p><em>“Trust your instincts. You’ll do fine. -Luwazi”</em></p> 
                 <p>Smiling at the letter’s simple contents, Ehu gently places the paper to the side. He opens the Veskarium invitation and begins formulating his reply.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Hey folks! This month sees us release our second batch of scenarios for the Year of Exploration’s Edge. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024x1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-303-Frozen-Ambitions-The-Shimmerstone-Gateway">Starfinder Society #3-03: Frozen Ambitions: The Shimmerstone Gateway</a>, by Paizo’s own Samantha Phelan, is the first in an interlinked series of scenarios that has the Starfinder Society exploring <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-Near-Space">Near Space</a>; starting with a visit to the outermost fringes of the Veskarium. Based on the narrative above, First Seeker Ehu Hadif still isn’t entirely sure how this mission is going to turn out! </p> 
                <p>Our second scenario, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024x2?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Vast-Experiment-Falling-into-Deliverance">Starfinder Society #3-04: The Vast Experiment: Falling into Deliverance</a>, comes from veteran author, and another fellow Paizo employee, John Compton (of some <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme">Live Exploration Extreme!</a> fame). This scenario starts off the Vast Experiment scenario series, and takes our PCs off into the depths of the Vast to rescue a scientist from a dangerous situation, all in order to start construction of a new generation of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual">Starfinder Society starship</a>.</p> 
                <p>As we mentioned previously, this Year’s storylines will feature three distinct arcs instead of one long metaplot. They do not follow the traditional multi-part scenario format in that you can play them in any order. You can find each scenario in an arc by looking for their series titles such as Frozen Ambitions or The Vast Experiment!</p> 
                <p>We hope you enjoy these scenarios and the series of adventures they kick off! Check back this afternoon for more Paizo Organized Play information!</p> 
                <p>Until next time,</p> 
                <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Thurston Hillman<br> <em>Starfinder Society Developer</em></p>

                <p>“And it’s a terrible job indeed, for such a handsome fellow,” the waitress mused. She tilted her pitcher of wine over his cup, and while the man was sure he’d had enough, he didn’t protest. “It’s such a gruesome thing for you to busy yourself with.” </p> 
                <p>“Someone’s got to be so busy.” He smirked, reaching into his pocket for a handful of coins and placing them in the waitress’s free hand. “Thank you for your assistance.” </p> 
                <p>The woman blushed at his touch, bowing as she stepped away. Quinn sipped from the now brimming cup of alcohol as he turned his attention back to his notes, the ones he had taken in his mind carefully as she spoke. This would be the eleventh body so far. He hadn’t seen it yet, but it was still fresh, and nearby—in an alley beside the rented homes at the docks, barely minutes of walking from the tavern he sat in. If the city’s own guards hadn’t moved it—and he was confident they wouldn’t, not until daylight had burned away most of their fear—then tonight was a good chance to get a look of his own. </p> 
                <p>The grim crime occurred near Augustana’s thriving docks, and Quinn knew which alley the victim lay in when the smell of rum and saltwater gave way to the overpowering stench of death as he approached. He held a torch above his head as he stepped into the dark toward the body. The corpse itself was as all the others, at least at first blush. It was dressed in the robes of the Skinsaw Cult, laying spread-eagle at the center of the scene. They had been exsanguinated, one clean deep cut to the neck letting all of their precious lifeblood out into a receptacle that was no longer at the scene, but left its round red ring of blood on the cobblestones as evidence.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The one difference between this scene and the others had been the first thing that Quinn saw, but he wanted to save his assessment of it for last. On the wall behind the body lay concentric painted circles of blood making a crude clock, skeletal arms pointing at the twelve and thirteen numerals. It was peculiar in ways that ultimately felt distracting. These cultists loved their gaudy death imagery—the skulls and bones and blood and exquisitely mannequined carcasses—all meant to elicit terror and leave those who witnessed their handiwork unable to shake the thought of the gruesome scene. As a rule, however, there was always something more meaningful beneath the theater, some misstep of a lazy mind, a revelation to be uncovered by the quick-witted. </p> 
                <p>Quinn stared at the macabre clock, waiting for it to reveal something deeper the its obvious message of intimidation and horror. It went up to thirteen hours—that would have been simple enough to dismiss as over-relying on superstition, but then why point at twelve? There were also the bones themselves. The body did have its arms split lengthwise, the skeleton severed at the joints for the bones to slip out as much as possible without disturbing the muscle beyond them. The arms nailed to the wall, however, did not belong to this victim. It took barely a moment of Quinn’s forensic acumen to tell. For one thing, there was a short hand, as all clocks were wont to have, but both limbs were still longer than the corpse’s. Each of these arms, then, must be another victim’s injury. </p> 
                <p>He paused to consider if that would be a useful hunch. That was where they pointed: to the twelfth and thirteenth bodies, somewhere waiting to be found among the ports of the Inner Sea. But why hint at them now? The murderer had so far never left any clues to a further kill. Perhaps he had learned that he was being followed, and the thrill had changed from the lust for blood to the game of not being caught. Quinn winced. “Please, don’t be one of the clever ones,” he muttered. </p> 
                <p>Quinn knelt and turned over the opened arms of the corpse with the tip of his cane, to check the rest of the man’s skin. The corpse’s nails were clean and manicured, and there were the clear tan lines of a bracelet and a ring around the wrist and fourth finger of the right hand. Nothing else about the person bore the kind of dazed, hungry demeanor of a cultist of the Skinsaw Man. Quinn sized up the man’s muscular build, sun-worn skin, and the pair of ornate anchor tattoos on each bicep—one in the Taldan or Andoren style he would expect of a citizen of Augustana, the other similar but with flourishes that appeared more Garundi, possibly Rahadoumi. This man must have been a sailor. This expanded his investigation quite a bit, and he sighed at the notion. </p> 
                <p>He endeavored to ask his questions in the morning, then. Sailors tend to be their most volatile at night.</p> 
                <p>At first light, Quinn awoke and took a moment to consider what he knew so far about the victims. The Skinsaw Cult garb was a ruse—but whose? Did a cultist find enough forethought to hide their latest body in their own robes? It was doubtful compared to the alternative: someone attempted to infiltrate the cult. It was highly unlikely that they were on the same path that he himself was. Still, what the poor soul may have found might be relevant, he thought. He hoped that the man may have shared some part of his plan with a crewmate. </p> 
                <p>Yes, he knew that would mean forcing the answers out of a sailor, the bulk of whom Quinn’s experience told him would be loyal to their oaths of secrecy, even those sworn to the dead. It’d be hard going, but at least there would be someone with answers. </p> 
                <p>Quinn spent the morning combing the Fleet District, listening and watching for any indication of what ship last night’s victim may have served on. If his theory were correct, if the victim truly was tracking the cult across the northern coast of the Inner Sea, then it’d be a ship recently arrived from Almas, after having put in at both Oppara and Cassomir, though not in that order. That narrowed the possible number of vessels to four.</p> 
                <p>It was early afternoon before he’d further winnowed the possibilities to a single ship, Oasis, which employed a Taldan crew but called Azir, Rahadoum’s so-called Port Godless, her home port. Oasis had arrived just two nights hence, and its crew were holed up in one of the sailor’s flophouses not far from the scene of the crime. When he found the home, Quinn lifted the head of his cane and rapped on the door three times with rhythmic precision, with the force of conviction but not malice. Just as he drew breath to call out his name and intention, the door slowly creaked open, and the stern face of a blond man in his forties glared at him. “What can I do for you, friend?”</p> 
                <p>“I may have a bit more to offer,” Quinn replied, smiling. “But first, do you know a tan-skinned man, around your height and build, maybe a bit younger, darker of hair, with twin anchor tattoos on the arms, of a kind but likely done by different needles in ports far from one another?”</p> 
                <p>“Er… I mean, I know lots of guys,” the man started, his eyes darting quickly from Quinn’s face to the head of his cane and back. “Why?” Quinn noticed that the man didn’t inhale at the end of the inquiry, nervously, subconsciously holding his breath.</p> 
                <p>Surely you heard tell of the murder last night, the ritual killing? I have reason to believe someone who’d been bunking here with the other members of his crew was involved.” Quinn drew his journal from a coat pocket now, making a show of checking it for the ship’s name. “Yes, the victim was most assuredly a sailor on the Oasis—strange name for a ship, no? You know it?”</p> 
                <p>“Victim?” the man said somberly, releasing his held breath and letting the door swing open wide enough for Quinn to enter. “Jassa, one of my mates…” His eyes opened wide, as if he were searching the floor between them both for something to make sense of his sudden grief. “I’m bosun of Oasis. I can’t imagine why Jassa’d be a target of a slaying that brutal. If what I heard is true, course.” When he finally found himself, he put his hand out to greet the detective. “Randall. Thank you for letting me know.” </p> 
                <p>Quinn shook the man’s hand firmly. There was the formality Quinn expected, the apprehension against opening up to anyone—especially non-sailors—who seemed to know more about a given situation. Experience told him that he just had to push a few buttons first. “Why would a man serving on a ship out of Azir be involved with religious zealots, cultists?”</p> 
                <p>“Cultists? You think one of those flesh-peeling Skinsaws did that to him?” Randall’s eyes flared with rage, but he caught himself suddenly. </p> 
                <p>There it was. Quinn had him now. “He told you something.”</p> 
                <p>“Like what, sir?” </p> 
                <p>“You didn’t even hesitate. Jumped straight from ‘cultist’ to ‘Skinsaws’. Your man Jassa was looking into something, and he let you know what. So now you’re going to tell me.” He walked past the man and toward the corner of the room that served as a kitchen and continued. “So, how do you like your tea?” </p> 
                <p>“… tea? What are you on about, man?” </p> 
                <p>Quinn peered into a kettle to ensure its cleanliness and began filling it with water, then turned to Randall and smirked. “When someone’s about to tell me a long story, I like to have something to drink.” </p>

                <p>In in the cosmopolitan trading city of Kibwe, at the edge of the Mwangi Expanse, innocent people struck by the terrible curse known as the <em>slithering</em> are melting into malevolent oozes. The heroes are at the epicenter of this slimy curse and might be the only ones capable of recovering the ancient magic needed to break it. Tracking the course of the curse through Kibwe’s bustling markets and shrines, they must untangle its origin and discover the role the nefarious Aspis Consortium plays in the unfolding conspiracy. The mysteries the heroes uncover might usher in a new era of plenty and prosperity for Kibwe—if they can survive the curse to experience it!</p> 
                <p><em>The Slithering</em>, written by our own Ron Lundeen, is designed for 5th-level non-human characters. Yeah, you read that right. Did we not mention that the curse only affects humans? That’s a very dangerous detail to overlook when preparing to start this adventure. Can you imagine what would happen if your entire party consisted of all humans? Talk about a total party kill!</p> 
                <p>But don’t worry, brave Pathfinder! We have you covered. Even if you’re set to start playing <em>right now</em>, you don’t need to go back to square one in designing a non-human PC to play. We’ve got a free web supplement providing four ready-to-go PCs for just such an event.</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, July 26, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> 
                </ul>

            <p itemprop="description">The fire in the forest clearing flickered merrily without wood or any sounds of crackling. Four fish sizzled on a blue-bronze pan, placed to the side to cool enough to safely eat. Candles and incense sticks were set in the earth, smoke rising from the smoldering tips to curl upward into the night. The occupant of the tidy campsite was absolutely stunning, her outfit rival to the leading lady of any royal court, her hair glowing like flame in the light. Yet the most notable thing, the thing that should have given Qiu's partners a bit of a clue, was the elaborate green mansion that loomed behind her, a home fit for nobles in the middle of a forest.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">The fire in the forest clearing flickered merrily without wood or any sounds of crackling. Four fish sizzled on a blue-bronze pan, placed to the side to cool enough to safely eat. Candles and incense sticks were set in the earth, smoke rising from the smoldering tips to curl upward into the night. The occupant of the tidy campsite was absolutely stunning, her outfit rival to the leading lady of any royal court, her hair glowing like flame in the light. Yet the most notable thing, the thing that should have given Qiu's partners a bit of a clue, was the elaborate green mansion that loomed behind her, a home fit for nobles in the middle of a forest.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071620_haojin.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="400" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071620_haojin.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="The sorceress Hao Jin holds a miniaturized building in her hands."></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Vladislav Orlowsk</p> 
                <p><em>You would have to be an idiot to go near her. That's a fox woman if I ever saw one</em>, Qiu thought to themself. So of course, Qiu's ox-brained partners had decided to rob the woman, and nothing the bandit had said could dissuade the rest of their party. Qiu had finally given up and left them to their fates, promising to be at their backs.<em> And stay at their backs, far out of sight.</em></p> 
                <p>Qiu shouldn't have even been that close. Maybe they felt they should at least stay and see what happened—that they at least owed their companions that much for the victories and spoils that the others had shared with them over the years. Maybe it was the woman. It had been so long since Qiu had seen another fox hiding behind a human face, another person who Qiu knew was truly like them.</p> 
                <p>Qiu watched their companions approach. Yahui was being dramatic, as usual, trying to scare the woman with his friendly-traveler-turned-threatening-robber act, as if anyone believed he was ever friendly. Qiu instinctively ducked behind a tree as the woman stood up. Best not to be in the splash zone if any bits of giblets came flying their way. Even so, they couldn't help but lean an eye out to peek. The woman's hair seemed to lose its gravity as she conjured magic power around her...</p> 
                <p>...and then burst into flame, as her form morphed into that of a gargantuan bird of fire.</p> 
                <p><em>Phoenix</em>, Qiu thought, their jaw dropping open in absolute stupor.</p> 
                <p>Yahui and the others weren't any more dignified, dropping their swords, falling to the ground, trying desperately to crawl backward away from the searing beast. They were bullies, not trained warriors. As they scrambled to their feet to escape, the phoenix gestured with a wing, causing a wall of fire to encircle the clearing. The magic blaze engulfed the trees, and yet the leaves and boughs did not blacken or burn. Yahui noticed, the same as Qui did, and decided to try his luck by leaping through the inferno. He was rewarded by his hair and clothes bursting into flames, and he shrieked in panic as he rolled against the ground to put himself out.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>It was too much for Qiu to take, the shock causing them to lose their grip on their form. Qiu felt a muzzle and white fur popping out from their human guise, and rode the transformation a little further, shifting all the way past a tailed humanoid into a small, four-legged forest creature. If they were lucky, they could pretend to be a common fox—oh, but it had been a mistake, a terrible mistake; the heat was unbearable in this shape, and Qiu found themself blindly darting out into the clearing to get away from those terrible embers and the pain of singed fur and whiskers.</p> 
                <p>The woman looked human again by the time Qiu finished rubbing their paws on their snout. No chance she hadn't noticed them now, a snow-white fox in the middle of her clearing, icy breath fogging in the warm air. Qiu gulped and looked around at their fellow bandits, though they knew their companions would be no help. At least Yahui looked like he would survive, though he'd likely be burned and missing his eyebrows for a while. </p> 
                <p>“Banditry is punished by execution, in these lands,” their captor said. “Or at least, so it was. The law may have changed, for I have been absent a long age.”</p> 
                <p>It hadn't, but Qiu didn't feel it necessary to say that. The other bandits gibbered something unintelligible. </p> 
                <p>“But what I do now is also unlawful. So are all tragedies—to be caught between honor and humanity,” the woman mused, apparently deciding that responses were optional. She gestured to Qiu, then lowered her hand to the ground in a clear summons to approach. “You are a huli jing? Let us speak.”</p> 
                <p>Qiu didn't bother trying to act dumb. It would be futile. This woman was <em>ancient</em>—it showed in her speech, and her power, and her eyes.</p> 
                <p>“That's not a name I've heard used in a long time,” Qiu said, slipping back into their true shape, a fox-faced humanoid with two tails, so that they could more easily speak. Already they could hear the more common names for their kind whispered among their bandit colleagues. Fox-demon. Liver-eater. Qiu would never be able to work with them again after this. They surprised themself by feeling a sense of mourning at that. </p> 
                <p>“I am Qiu. What can this humble huli jing do for you?” Qiu asked, giving a sitting bow. They did their best to speak formally, out of respect, but Qiu felt more like they had managed to land on pretentious instead. </p> 
                <p>“I am Hao Jin,” the woman introduced politely, and Qiu at last understood, and believed it. </p> 
                <p>The Ruby Phoenix. The most powerful sorcerer of a nation and of an age. Perhaps of all ages. There were plenty of children named in her honor, but Qiu doubted any possessed the raw magic they had just witnessed.</p> 
                <p>She continued, graciously ignoring their expression, “I am looking for a dead-people.”</p> 
                <p>“A dead-people?” Qiu echoed. It wasn't a phrase they were familiar with, and the literal words didn't quite make sense. There were corpses a plenty in this forest, and likely some undead as well, but they didn't feel like what Hao Jin was asking for.</p> 
                <p>“This is no longer the word that is used?” Hao Jin asked, after a moment of hesitation. “A people that the empire of Lung Wa declared dead. Their houses are to be destroyed, their records of lineage burned. Their language must never be spoken. Their name will become a myth. They are erased. They are no longer real.”</p> 
                <p>Qiu chewed their gums at the weight of those words. <em>Dead-people</em>. “I do not know how anyone could find such a group. Even Lung Wa is something of a myth, these days.”</p> 
                <p>“I remembered their name, in defiance. They were the Xijae people. They lived here once,” Hao Jin said, standing up to walk inside her ornate green mansion and gesturing for Qiu to follow. When they entered, they found a museum room graced with armfuls of jewelry, books, and scrolls in a mysterious writing. Costumes and headdresses, every thread and color vibrant and pristine. Qiu reached out before they could stop themself, eyes open in awe as they examined the embroidery and delicately worked metal. They'd never seen patterns like these before, never seen this artistic style. It had been <em>erased</em>. Erased before Qiu had been born, <em>stolen</em> without them ever knowing—but wait a moment...</p> 
                <p>“I've seen these before,” Qiu said after a long thought, rolling a jade and silver bead between their fingers. “There was an old man who made them in a village forty li to the south.”</p> 
                <p><em>We robbed his shipment blind,</em> Qiu did not say. They were starting to feel very bad about that. “I don't know if he's still alive, but...”</p> 
                <p>“Show me the way,” Hao Jin commanded, before Qiu could think of how to finish that sentence. She stepped back outdoors to set her pans and plates back in her house, ushering Qiu outside as well. Qiu watched in awe as the building shrunk down to the size of a child's wooden toy in her hands. She glanced at the other bandits, seeming to weigh their fate in her hands before she evidently decided they weren't worth the distraction. With a wave of the sorceress' arms, the wall of fire surrounding the camp vanished. Qiu thought they heard her trying to say 'Go forth and do no evil' or something else with suitable gravitas, but the bandits were running and screaming before she could get that far.</p> 
                <p>“Come,” Hao Jin said, with a sigh at the robbers' antics. A gust of wind blew out her campfire; another lifted the two of them into the air. They shot up above the earth, to a height that sent Qiu's head spinning—or maybe it was the speed, or the thin air. They barely managed to keep consciousness to point out the tiny speck below with one shaking claw. The descent was no slower or easier, leaving Qiu gasping for breath as Hao Jin approached the village on foot, having been kind enough to the nerves of the residents not to land in the middle of their town. </p> 
                <p><em>Now is the time to run</em>, Qiu thought. </p> 
                <p>But just the memory of the phrase <em>dead-people</em> sent them staggering into the town on the heels of the sorceress. Qiu could see that she had taken out the strand of beads Qiu had picked out, holding them up to a tiny crowd of four people, as another man hurried out from inside his small house with a woman following behind him. By the time Qiu reached the scene, the man was holding out his own hand, a trio of similar jade beads presented in his palm for Hao Jin to see.</p> 
                <p>“I was given these for safekeeping a long time ago,” Hao Jin said, pulling some of her ancient books from seemingly nowhere. She offered them to the man with a humble bow. “It has been long past the age when I should have returned them. Please, forgive me.”</p> 
                <p>Qiu could see the emotions run rampant across the man's face as he carefully took the book and opened it. Confusion, morphing into recognition, then disbelief. Then a profound and deep-cutting sadness, one that ran back generations, one that could never be healed, but perhaps now could be soothed.</p> 
                <p>“My grandfather spoke this,” the village man said, sharply turning his face away so that the ancient book's precious, forgotten language could not be smeared and ruined by his tears. </p> 
                <p>The former bandit watched the villagers crowd around Hao Jin, their voices blending in questions and exclamations. A breeze rustled through Qiu’s fur, and they suddenly felt a cold loneliness buried within their chest. </p>

                <h3>Duhgik, Kobold Trapsmith</h3> 
                <p>After her tribe exiled her for not adhering to some of their more ruthless traditions, Duhgik was forced to live on the surface in the too-too bright sunshine. She found solace in the deep shade of the forest’s tree canopy among the verdant foliage of various plants and edible mosses. Duhgik that the environment matched her own green scales well, and has since become an expert at hiding among the big-big trees.</p> 
                <p>When Duhgik found the cruelty of her old kobold tribe reflected in the cruelty of hunters and poachers in the forest, she set out on a personal mission to help the critters of the woods by disarming poachers’ snares and setting up some of her own. She strives to rid her woods of the would-be hunters who only care about trophies and leave the rest of the animal to rot—what a waste. As long as visitors to her forest are kind to the land and animals, Duhgik leaves them alone.</p>

If someone else crafted it, she must attempt a ranged Strike against the Crafting DC, triggering the snare only if she hits.</p>

                <p><b>Surprise Snare</b> [two-actions] (manipulation) Duhgik installs one of her snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that’s occupied by an opponent. It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to Craft. The snare automatically triggers, but it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts. </p>
                <h3>Plot Hooks</h3> 
                <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Duhgik into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>A local noble or prominent merchant hires the heroes, describing a terrible attack they suffered in the woods by a terrifying creature the last time they were out hunting game—likely an ogre, troll, or some other vicious creature. In truth, these claims are an exaggeration, and the embarrassed noble fell victim to one of Duhgik’s traps and simply embellishes the threat to save face.</li> 
                 <li>While traveling through the woods, the heroes come across a series of traps, each more dangerous than the last. A voice high in the trees tells them to flee or face the wrath of the “very-big-mean dragon” that protects the forest and its inhabitants.</li> 
                 <li>Duhgik meets the heroes while on a trip into town to buy supplies and sell some of her snares to hunters she trusts to use them honorably. She asks them to help her with a particularly aggressive magical beast that has been avoiding her snares and killing all the wildlife near her home.</li>

From all over Golarion, would-be adventurers had traveled to the Grand Lodge and applied for membership in the Pathfinder Society. Tengu feathers brushed against kobold scales as members of Golarion’s varied peoples brushed shoulders, waiting for the Society’s leadership to open the doors and announce who would receive the rank of initiate to begin their training. Just as the crowd grew restless, with grumbling voices tired of waiting filling the air, the doors opened and Janira Gavrix stepped out, flanked by Ambrus Valsin and Drandle Dreng.

                <p>But we have even more goodies for you, our players, before we get to Gen Con. Last week, we revealed that kobolds will be an always-available ancestry option for Pathfinder Society players upon release of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Players Guide</a>. Here and now, in advance of the book’s release, we’re happy to reveal the sanctioning for the other character options available from the APG—if you want to play that swashbuckler or witch at Gen Con, you’ll be able to! Check out our ongoing <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options">Character Options blog</a> for these updates.</p> 
                <blockquote>
                 <p><em>Venture-Captain Naiaj sighed as she swiped another set of documents off her datapad. “They were supposed to be here weeks ago” she muttered, knowing her companion would hear her over the din of the bustling spaceport.</em></p><em> <p>The vesk next to her smirked. “Yes, yes, but these things take time, you know? Sometimes I think you find things to worry about, just to make sure you don’t run out.” Radazsam knew he could get away with needling the gnome; underneath her stern, monochromatic exterior was a warm heart. Plus, he’d already seen his contact approaching through the crowd.</p> <p>Before Naiaj could formulate a response, she spotted them as well: a pale lavender vesk with the most elaborate set of facial bone spikes she’d ever seen, followed by a green-furred skittermander. Despite all laws of physics, the six-armed creature appeared to be hauling no less than 12 boxes of various sizes. “Well,” Naiaj said as they approached, “it’s about time. Let’s see what you’ve brought from the Veskarium, shall we?” </p></em>
                </blockquote> 
                <p>Fear not, Starfinder Society players, we have things for you as well! How about a fully sanctioned <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual">Starship Operations Manual</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-Near-Space">Near Space</a>? Note that the former, as a book focused on starships, doesn’t have any options for your characters to take, but we’ve still included it in our sanctioning for the sake of completeness. But in the latter, you’ll find many new items for players to use in telling their characters’ stories, including alternate options for vesk, skittermanders, and more; new weapons and fusions; and a few archetypes and themes to flesh out your Starfinders.</p> 
                <p>But enough chatter. Time to make more characters!</p> 
                <p>Until next week,</p> 
                <p>Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“COLLISION IN THIRTY SEC...” Keskodai punched a flashing button and the ship computer fell silent, but the cockpit was still roaring from re-entry. From behind, he heard the shrieking of metal as the ship’s rear quarter twisted into collapsing fragments. </p> 
                <p><em>If I can just get the nose up. Iseph would know what to do.</em> He was pathing now, as the only other living occupant of the Hellknight ship shared his telepathy</p> 
                <p>Raia dropped into the co-pilot seat next to him and began to struggle with the controls. <em>Surely, this vessel must have an aerobraking system for safe landing in an emergency?</em></p> 
                <p><em>And I’d gladly use it, but all the controls are in devilspeak</em>! Keskodai waved a hand over a control panel covered in infernal symbols.</p> 
                <p>Raia didn’t take her eyes off the viewscreen before her.<em> Perhaps we should not have killed the entire crew</em>.</p> 
                <p><em>They went to a Hell of their own making</em>. Keskodai stared helplessly at the controls. <em>I’m just not ready to join them yet</em>.</p> 
                <p>Their thoughts fell silent as the surface of the planet rumbled ever closer. The shaking front viewscreen went yellow, then red, before their eyes; re-entry was melting the ship. Beneath them, however, were endless fields of white, a thick blanket of snow that rolled gently over hills and down into deep drifts.</p> 
                <p><em>It must be one of those</em>, Raia pathed, pointing to a set of six brilliantly flashing buttons on Keskodai’s side of the cockpit. </p> 
                <p><em>But ... which?</em> He took a hand off the control wheel and hovered over the array of buttons. Each bore indecipherable symbols. He felt himself overwhelmed by the consequence of choice. How many chances would he have to activate the proper system? If he picked the wrong one, would his choice doom the vessel, himself, and Raia? Or could he try again? Was there some clue here in the cockpit, written in letters that were twisted like fire but rigid like prison bars, that would help him select the proper one? It was thrilling, this paralysis. And every moment of indecision made the consequences vastly greater. His antenna twitched and shivered in horrified delight.</p> 
                <p>Raia’s eyes were wide with fear. They were less than a mile above the ground now, little more than a meteor adorned with half-melted spikes. <em>Just pick one!</em></p> 
                <p>But he could not move</p> 
                <p>At the last instant, she lunged across the cockpit for the controls. Keskodai felt the braking thrusters fire, and they were both hurled from their chairs towards the viewscreen.</p> 
                <p>Then came blackness. And silence.</p> 
                <p>Raia awoke first. Everything was tilted at an angle. Crumpled in the cockpit’s nose, she tried to move. Pain. Broken shoulder. Her last healing serum... in her belt. Thinking was hard. But as the fluid trickled down her throat her head cleared. She was alive.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai lay on the floor, in bad shape. His chitin was cracked. She didn’t understand his biology but it wasn’t good. There was a box on the wall with a red vial on its face; she didn’t need to read the Hellknights’ devil language to recognize it as a first aid kit. Inside, a dermal stapler. The device made a ka-lunk sound as she put Keskodai’s abdominal plates back together. She bit the cap off a tube of sprayflesh and squeezed it out over the wound. It was all she could do.</p> 
                <p>The cold wasn’t from her injuries. Hull plates had separated in the descent, and a frigid wind outside blew snow sideways. She thumbed her environmental protections and leapt out one of the holes, landing in a knee-high drift.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The crash had attracted scavengers. Half a dozen, each big as a shotalashu, with whip-like tails and massive lower jaws ending in projecting tusks. “Calories must be exceptionally difficult to find in this biome,” she said, not expecting them to respond. “So your hunger is understandable, but you will find me more trouble than I’m worth.” Behind her, she heard Keskodai climbing from the wreck.</p> 
                <p>Before the first one could lunge for her, she hurled twin bolts of green force at it, and pieces of the creature flew away into the freezing air, digitized into binary code. That surprised it, but the others charged. Bringing her hands together, touching thumbs, she conjured a fan of emerald flame and backed towards the ship. A white light spiraled out from over her shoulder: Keskodai. His psychic blast overwhelmed one of the creatures; it fell writhing in the snow, but the others were close now. She tried to levitate; one of the creatures clamped down on her leg with its massive jaws and she cried out as pain overwhelmed her. Desperate, she found her baton. It wouldn’t be enough.</p> 
                <p>But the frenzy abated. One of the animals sniffed the air, and the pack made snuffling noises to each other. As Raia slowly slid down the side of the hull into the snow, the beasts loped off.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai lowered himself down and got an arm under Raia. <em>They can smell the Hellknight corpses</em>, he told her. <em>Let’s hope they enjoy barbecue</em>.</p> 
                <p><em>We only have a little time. If we have not found shelter by the time they come back...</em> she winced as she tried to put weight on her leg.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai helped her to her feet, and they limped to the top of a nearby hill. There wasn’t much to see, but a river of unnaturally dark blue was barely visible in the distance. They made for it.</p> 
                <p>The going was painful and slow. The snow stopped falling, but it was still thick and the ground was impossible to see, until suddenly only Keskodai’s long antennae were visible, the rest of him having fallen into a deep drift. It was growing dark as they reached the river. Raia knelt down to cup the water. “Antifreeze,” she said. It was the first they’d spoken since the attack. They couldn’t drink this.</p> 
                <p>“You’re mad at me.” Keskodai indicated no emotion, simply stating a fact.</p> 
                <p>“You shirren and your damn ... choice paralysis!”</p> 
                <p>“I am sorry, Raia.”</p> 
                <p>“My history teacher, Ms. Lueda, had a saying. ‘It is best to do the right thing. Next best is to do something. Worst of all is to do nothing.’”</p> 
                <p>“I said I was sorry.”</p> 
                <p>“Don’t they teach you anything in school?”</p> 
                <p>“I did not go to school.”</p> 
                <p>That made her pause. She couldn’t imagine it. “What?”</p> 
                <p>“My parents carried me with them, day after day. I learned about life through their experiences. Just as I carry Chk Chk.” He patted the armored cradle jar at his hip.</p> 
                <p>“Wait, you brought your son <em>here</em>? Through all,” she gestured in the vague direction of the crash and nearly stumbled. “That?”</p> 
                <p>“How else is he to learn?”</p> 
                <p>Raia’s leg was numb with pain. She was cold, but her environmental protections were running fine. That meant it wasn’t the weather. Shock was getting to her. She couldn’t stand any longer. Lowering herself to the river bank, she lay back in the snow.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai knelt down beside her.</p> 
                <p>Still angry, she pulled away from him ever so slightly. “What are you doing?”</p> 
                <p>“Healing your injuries.”</p> 
                <p>“You’re empty. We used almost everything we had on the Hellknights, and the rest on those scavengers.” </p> 
                <p>Was that a smile? Raia couldn’t tell. “See, this is where your magic and mine differ,” he said, placing a hand on her head. It wasn’t the leg that was killing her, he knew. It was head trauma from the crash. “So long as I’m alive, I’m never empty.”</p> 
                <p>Her head began to clear. But as it did, Keskodai’s green head gained ugly yellow bruises. Her leg stopped hurting, but cracks appeared in his chitin. One of his antennae withered. She lurched up, grabbing him, and emphatically pathed, Stop! He stopped.</p> 
                <p>“You didn’t have to do that, you ridiculous...” She was speaking again. “Why did you do that?”</p> 
                <p>Now it was Keskodai’s turn to fall flat on his back in the snow. She didn’t know how much damage he had done to himself, but it was serious. Maybe fatal. “It was easy,” he said. “There was only one choice.”</p> 
                <p>Raia still had the dermal stapler. She dug it out, gave it a quick whack to break the ice that had formed around the dispenser, and started <em>ka-lunking</em> the shirren back together. He began to make a noise, a rapid hk-ik-ikking noise.</p> 
                <p>“Are you laughing? Because from my perspective none of this is particularly funny.”</p> 
                <p>But he only rose a hand toward the sky. She looked over one shoulder. </p> 
                <p>The Sunrise Maiden emerged from the clouds. For the first time in days, Raia smiled.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Though the night air was still, Korakai’s feathers still rustled as if in a light breeze as he leaned on his staff and finally arrived at the mountain’s summit. The climb probably would’ve been easier if he hadn’t eaten so many skewers, but what was he to do? He’d reached the mountain trail after a long day’s travel, and he very well couldn't ignore the delicious smells and clinking glasses from the homey tavern tucked to the side of the road. </p> 
                <p>Korakai had to respect the location. He clearly wasn’t the only one who’d found the good food and drink more appetizing than an arduous hike, and like his family’s own restaurant, this tavern had been abuzz with the easy energy of a community that knew each other. One thing had led to another, and Korakai had ended up trading recipes with one of the regulars, an elderly spice merchant. </p> 
                <p>The night had devolved into an impromptu cook-off, and it would have been impolite for Korakai to not sample every combination of skewer and dipping sauce that had filled the table—as a professional courtesy to a fellow cook, of course. Korakai couldn’t believe the merchant had never heard of yuzu, though. He’d managed to whip up a substitute from lemon and orange, and though he knew his father would roll his eyes when he found out his only son had butchered a family recipe, Korakai thought the mix had actually turned out rather well. </p> 
                <p>Sighing contentedly, Korakai pulled a worn map out from his pack, shaking it out as his ever-present static clung the parchment to his feathers. He reflexively moved his talons, tracing symbols to conjure a light, but stopped as he realized he could make out the map just fine in the red glow of… Korakai turned around and his heart froze. In the valley below, he could see the tavern to his right, and creeping towards it, the glow of burning trees to his left.</p> 
                <p>No matter how quickly he ran down the trail, there was no way he’d make it around the steep switchbacks before the fires reached the tavern. Which meant… Korakai paced back and forth on the mountaintop for a few precious seconds, fidgeting and clicking his talons together. He wasn’t going to like this next part</p> 
                <p>Korakai recalled the words his grandfather had told him when he was younger. “A tengu belongs to the sky. A tengu does not fear the earth. A tengu belongs to the sky. A tengu does not fear the earth. A tengu belongs to the sky. A tengu does not fear—” Korakai clenched his eyes tight and leapt from the edge of the cliff, opening them again only when he felt the four winds catch him and carry him gently from the mountaintop.</p> 
                <p>Smoke stung Korakai’s eyes as he looked around a forest bathed in orange and red. Something felt wrong about this blaze, but he couldn’t quite place it. Soon enough, though, he found its source in a clearing before him: a pack of fiendish beasts slavering infernal fire that dripped to the group, setting the brush alight: hell hounds, four in all. Korakai’s legs locked. Had someone summoned the foul creatures here? </p> 
                <p>Before the fiends could notice Korakai, he tried to weave magic to shield himself, but fear had reduced his voice to a stammer too feeble to sustain the incantation, and the spell collapsed. As one of the hounds sniffed the air—how could it smell anything, when it reeked of brimstone?—Korakai wheeled around a tree and made himself as small as he could. He held his khakkhara staff close to him for comfort, for once happy that the heirloom was broken, as his trembling would surely have made the staff’s jingling rings give him away, were they still intact. </p> 
                <p>Maybe he could make a break for the tavern and warn them to evacuate? No, that wouldn’t do. Right now, the hounds were traveling in a pack, but if they split up, they’d set the forest on fire even faster. Even if everyone could get to safety—questionable, given the state some had been in when Korakai had left the tavern—it would take the owners forever to scrounge together the coin to rebuild it, and there’d be no replacing the memories it held. </p> 
                <p>No, he had to stop this here. Korakai breathed deep, trying to steady his trembling hands, and sank deep within himself. In his mind’s eye, he saw it standing there, unchanged since the day he’d swallowed the sea: a massive floodgate of salt-encrusted stone and metal. Even with the gate closed, Korakai could feel the ceaseless surging of water—six swelling waves, then a crashing seventh—the storm of creation just beyond. The hounds were powerful, yes, emissaries of the gods and rulers of the lower planes. But Korakai too was connected to gods, spirits, and myriad other sources of divine power—eight million or more—as numerous as grains in the sea. He had nothing to fear. Korakai stepped out from behind the tree and opened the floodgates but a crack.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Power welled forth, coursing through his veins and churning in his lungs. The hounds noticed him, snarling. As the first of the pack leapt forward, Korakai swung his khakkhara in an arc, feeling the deities of wind and sky—good and evil alike—guide him. A gale surged, catching the hound in midair and sending it careening into a tree, where it exploded into embers.</p> 
                <p>As his beak opened in a grin, Korakai felt the unleashed energies swirl, their opposing currents clashing in a turbulent whirlpool. Winds howled as a sacred storm spiraled forth, and Korakai winced as electricity danced across his feathers. He had known it would happen; this was the price of drawing on the tempest, of opening a door that led somewhere unknowable. </p> 
                <p>The second of the hounds took advantage of Korakai’s distraction to circle behind him. In response, the tengu willed the floodgates to open even further, and this time, the spirits of rain and waves passed through. Water collected in Korakai’s balled fist, and with no more effort than it took to splash in a tidepool, he blasted it at the hound, where the torrent met its pelt with a hiss of steam. For a moment, it seemed like the fiend would withstand the deluge, but less than a heartbeat later, the lightning that wreathed Korakai’s body found its way through the waters, extinguishing the hell hound in a spray of saltwater. The backlash was immediate and fierce. Rain fell despite the cloudless sky as the winds around Korakai accelerated into a fierce hurricane.</p> 
                <p>Enraged, the two remaining hounds inhaled, chests distending as they stoked internal hellfire before breathing out twin gouts of flame that met in a burning wave. Korakai laughed, feeling for a moment oddly at home—he knew how to meet a wave. Recalling childhood lessons learned from his mother in the island surf, he dove forward, tucking his head under his arms, and the deluge of his storm protected him from the worst of the heat. Emerging in front of the shocked fiends, Korakai gave himself fully over to the tempest and brought his hands together in a thunderous clap. A deafening peal dispersed smoke and steam alike, shaking leaves from the trees, and when the sound cleared, the hell hounds were no more.</p> 
                <p>Audible in his mind, even amid the echoes, Korakai heard the floodgates slam shut. Though the energies he’d already drawn forth continued to rage around him, he found himself cut off from the primordial storm, unable to gather any more from the other side. It was a humbling reminder that he was a conduit for its power, not its owner. Once again, he was just Korakai, nothing more. </p> 
                <p>As he stood at peace within the hurricane, Korakai leaned on his staff again and let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. With a bit of meditation, he’d be able to quell the storm somewhat, but as he looked at the flames, he realized he might have use for it for a little while longer. He’d let the revelers in the tavern keep enjoying their night while he searched for who, or what, had summoned the fiends here in the first place. Rains and wind quenching the flames with each step, Korakai walked into the burning forest, trembling no longer.</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, July 19, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                <h3>Pr’rall, Catfolk Stalker</h3> 
                <p>A hunter at heart, Pr’rall takes bounties throughout Avistan and Garund on anything from cockatrices to bandits. Gold pays the bills, but the thrill of the hunt is the reason he always takes the next job. Lately, Pr’rall has found the most satisfaction from hunting sapient creatures; he relishes the moment before the final strike when he knows that he’s won and his prey will fall under his blade. He’s begun to look into more than just bounty hunting, and is considering joining a local assassin’s guild, though he’s not sure if he wants to fully embrace his growing bloodlust.</p>

                <p><b>Flensing Slice</b> [one-action] <b>Requirements</b> Pr'rall's last action was a Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target; <b>Effect</b> When Pr'rall hits with both attacks with Double Slice, he flenses the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage, becomes flat-footed, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of Pr’rall’s next turn.<br> <b>Light Paws</b> [two-actions] Pr'rall can balance on his toes to step carefully over obstructions.

                <h3>Plot Hooks</h3> 
                <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Pr’rall into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>The heroes need to take down a particularly difficult foe and hire Pr’rall to help them hunt the target down.</li> 
                 <li>Pr’rall’s ancestral temple sword is stolen from him but he’s run out of leads in tracking it down. He asks the heroes to help him find out who has it so he can hunt them down and ensure they never steal from him again.</li> 
                 <li>A rich and powerful noble has been thwarted by the PCs too many times. He’s hired Pr’rall to hunt them down and bring them back: alive if possible, dead if necessary. Given the catfolk’s growing proclivity for killing, it’s likely he’ll find a way to force the PCs’ hands.</li>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Patross, the staff lead, was sneering again, and Ivy knew that would soon cause trouble for her. The waitress didn't even need to look to know what had offended the surly man. The two guests that sat by the dock-side windows—prime seats of the establishment, Patross would protest!—stood out enough from the regular crowd. It was an open question on what about them offended the most. The woman's clothing was too shabby, the man's clothing was too foreign. The woman was vicious and unpleasant. Truthfully, Ivy thought that Patross was most upset that the pair were both old, and the woman incredibly ugly.</p> 
                <p>He couldn't say anything about that, it would upset Taldan decorum. So Patross sneered and settled on, “Setting that filthy chicken on the table. As if she thought this place was a barn!”</p> 
                <p>As if other guests didn't bring their dogs into the tavern all the time, throwing their grimy leftover bones on the floor for the pets to chew on. Ivy would have rolled her eyes, if she didn't know what was coming next for her. She kept her gaze down on the floor and clutched her serving plate to her chest, willing herself to become invisible. If she could just slip under the man's notice, maybe he'd just complain and then leave it alone—</p> 
                <p>“Ivy!” Patross barked, and the poor waitress felt a cold shudder roll up her shoulders despite the fact she'd been expecting it. “Tell that woman to either take that louse-ridden bird out, or take herself out instead!”</p> 
                <p><em>Coward</em>, Ivy thought.</p> 
                <p>She moved as slowly as possible, dragging each step with a sense of building dread, but with Patross' eyes on her she couldn't draw her walk out forever. The more that Ivy could see of the old woman, the more terrified Ivy became. Maybe it was simply because the old hag was so hideous—Ivy didn't like to think she was so shallow, but what else was there? She'd dealt with far less pleasant drunks nearly every shift. The woman's teeth glinted like iron, but Ivy had seen gaudier dentures before, some made of far less pleasant materials. The woman was glaring at Ivy long before the girl reached the table, sniffing as if she could suck the waitress in through her nose. The price of dragging it out as she had; that always made things worse!</p> 
                <p>“Well?” the old woman snapped, and Ivy fought down another deep shudder. “What is it, child? Did you burn your tongue off? Spit out what you want or leave me to my tea!”</p> 
                <p>Ivy swallowed deeply, glad that her serving plate could hide the sweat on her palms. “Madam...” she said, mind racing on what to say, before she settled on something potentially inoffensive. “Would you like me to care for your chicken, while you are here?”</p> 
                <p>The woman sniffed heavily again, this time thoughtfully. “Careful with your words, are you? Yes, take care of my chicken. If you're a good girl and treat it well, I'll give you a gift and let you go free.”</p> 
                <p>“Stop tormenting the young woman,” the elderly man chastised. Ivy had nearly forgotten he was there, too focused on his horrible companion. He had dark skin, not too unusual in Taldor—plenty of families from Mwangi had come to Taldor with the returning Armies of Exploration—but none of those people wore clothing like his. He continued, “Pay your grandmother no mind, Ivy. Nor your staff lead, for that matter.”</p>

                <p><em>He must have overheard my name,</em> Ivy thought, because she didn't like to think of any alternatives. She wasn't sure what to say now, so she said nothing.</p> 
                <p>“A shy little bit like that must be pushed, or she'll never amount to anything,” the 'grandmother' complained. “Look at her, shoved around by quarrelsome women and grubby men. She'd be better off as a ham on a plate.”</p> 
                <p>“Isn't that right?” she said, suddenly snapping her attention back to Ivy. “You'd leap at any chance to get out of here, wouldn't you, child? Even one as horrible as I?”</p> 
                <p>Ivy wanted to. Ivy wanted to escape this miserable, harassment-filled drudgery more than anything. But Ivy had been raised on old tales of careless fools, and had learned well in Taldor to be cautious of windfalls, and so she took a step back and gave a short shake of her head.</p> 
                <p>“Plenty of 'shy young bits' grow up without <em>you</em> to threaten them,” the man scoffed at his companion. “Or do you think you're so important?”</p> 
                <p>“Of <em>course</em> I'm important,” 'grandmother' cackled.</p> 
                <p>“Oh? Care to wager?” the man asked.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The pair glanced at Ivy again, something unspoken passing between them. The old woman shook her head, picking up her chicken under one arm. “A waste,” she grumbled, with no further explanation, and hustled out of the tavern door. Both Ivy and the old man watched her go.</p> 
                <p>“You're wise to avoid suspicious gifts, and wiser still not to look toward someone else to save you,” the man said, after a moment. “But will you be able to live with the curiosity of what would have happened, if you had said yes?”</p> 
                <p>“Well, I'll have to, sir,” Ivy said, slipping easily back into her pleasant server persona now that the woman was gone. “Thank you for your patronage.”</p> 
                <p>The old man nodded, or perhaps it was a small bow, before he picked up his leopard-headed staff, paid the bill, and left. Ivy blew out a sign of relief, glad the situation had resolved itself without a confrontation. Patross couldn't yell at her for failing now... at least, not much. The waitress moved to clean up the dishes on the table, noting the silver and glass tea mugs weren't anything she'd seen used at the Dancing Dolphin before. Moving one of the cups onto her tray, she noticed a brilliant red and gold egg sitting behind it. It looked the size of a regular hen's egg, but it glittered with real gold, and something strange and powerful hummed beneath Ivy's fingertips when she touched it.</p> 
                <p><em>This is not safe</em>, Ivy thought to herself, for she was no fool. She looked out the window, but could see no sign of the old hag or her friend. Was this some kind of test? The smartest thing to do was leave the egg there, or perhaps give it to Patross and see what happened. But she thought back to the old man's words... <em>will you be able to live with the curiosity of what would have happened, if you leave it be?</em></p> 
                <p>Ivy picked up the Fabergé egg, slipping it into the pocket of her waitress' apron...</p>

                <p itemprop="description">While Gen Con won’t be happening in Indianapolis this year, Gen Con Online promises to be just as jam-packed with Organized Play events! We’ve got nearly 900 game sessions scheduled, so let’s take a look at some of the new scenarios we’ll be premiering.</p> 
                <p><b>Pathfinder Special: 2-00 The King in Thorns</b><br> In our first multitable interactive special for Pathfinder (second edition), the Pathfinder Society travels deep within the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, ready to do battle with a powerful fey adversary, the Thorned Monarch, whose shadowy plots have vexed the Pathfinder Society since its founding days. Adventurers will unlock lost magic and discover long-forgotten secrets—that is, if they don’t fall prey to the Monarch’s tricks! This interactive special currently has 70 tables scheduled at a variety of level ranges.</p> 
                <p><b>Starfinder Special: 3-00 The Last Bite</b><br> With her machinations laid bare, Datch is ready to execute the final stages of her plan: become the head of AbadarCorp and twist it for her nefarious purposes. Only the Starfinder Society can stop her plans in their tracks in this brand-new interactive special! The agents will have to battle drones, win friends and alliances, and work together to complete Luwazi Elsebo’s final mission and close the books on this saga.</p> 
                <p><b>New Scenarios</b><br> Gen Con will also see the premiere of a several new Pathfinder Society scenarios:<br> In <b>PFS 1-24: Lightning Strikes, Stars Fall</b>, Pathfinders chart a path through the Numerian wilderness, dealing with all matter of twisted and technological foes and a nefarious group that’s determined to make sure they never return. <br> In <b>PFS 1-25: Grim Symphony</b>, Pathfinders explore a haunted mansion in Ustalav filled with treasure – and discordant evil!<br> <b>PFS 2-01: Citadel of Corruption</b> kicks off the new year with a Decemvirate-led expedition into the corrupted forests of Iobaria.<br> <b>PFS 2-02: Mountain of Sea and Sky</b> ask the Pathfinders to secure a new lodge on an oceanside mountain in Minkai. Magical disturbances have sent the island’s guardians and wildlife into disarray. Through exploration, diplomacy, magic, and blade, the Pathfinders can set things right and earn welcome to a newly harmonious land. </p> 
                <p>We’ll also be releasing <b>Quest 13: Falcon’s Descent</b>, our final quest, in which the Eagle Knights request assistance with a band of slavetaking duergars, as well as our first Bounty, titled <b>The Whitefang Wyrm</b>, in which Pathfinders between missions accept a bounty to track down a dangerous dragon in the frozen Crown of the World. Starfinder released its first two offerings for Year 3, <b>Crash Down</b> and <b>The Subterranean Safari</b>, at ConCurrent, and you’ll find plenty of tables for both at Gen Con as well.</p> 
                <p>Not to be forgotten, the <b>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</b> will feature tables of the interactive special <b>6-99 Tyrant of the Harrow</b>, which debuted at PaizoCon and pulls the heroes into the Harrowed Realm populated by storybook characters. We're kicking off <b>Year 7: The Year of Reborn Strife</b> with zombie hijinks in the streets of Kaer Maga in <b>7-1: Attack of the Twice-Born</b>. We’re also premiering the <b>PACS 2020 Open: The Last Night at Everstand</b>, in which teams take on the role of embattled defenders against foreboding odds to compete against each other for fame, glory and prizes!</p> 
                <p> In addition to all these events, we’re featuring tables of some old favorites from Pathfinder (first edition) as well as selections from Year 1 of Pathfinder (second edition) and Year 2 of Starfinder Society. With nearly 900 tables over the four days of the convention, we’re sure you’ll have plenty of opportunities to roll some (virtual) dice!</p> 
                <br> 
                <p><b>Player Instructions</b><br> The event catalog is live now at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/online" target="_blank">https://www.gencon.com/online</a>, and player registration will begin on July 13. Badges are free and can be obtained now at their website. We do want to let players know that Gen Con event tickets are $2 per event, plus tax.

                <p>Pethjun tightens the bandage around her left bicep, wincing just a bit as the fibers of the cloth meet the open wound. “So, you want more Sewer Dragons in your Society, huh? How we gonna protect ourselves from things like this,” Pethjun kicks the slain body of a nearby otyugh, “if you take all our best warriors and explorers?” Trapmaster Tok and Chief Yiddlepode, standing nearby, nod their heads and turn to their Pathfinder friend Drandle Dreng, waiting for an answer.</p> 
                <p>“Well,” Dreng begins, “didn’t we come down here and help you put these things down before too many kobolds got hurt? And just think of how much stronger your tribe might become when veteran Pathfinders retire back here, bringing their magic weapons, arcane secrets, and experience with them? The Society and the Sewer Dragons have been allies for a long time; let’s make it official. I’ve already convinced Valsin that we need you all now more than ever, and you need us. Who warned you about that merchant who was giving you a bad deal on the maps and relics you were looking to trade, eh?”</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/070820_Kobold.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="450" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/070820_Kobold.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" alt="Red kobold holding a short spear"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>Yiddlepode steps forward before Pethjun can respond, drawing herself up to her full height and managing to make it seem much more impressive than the three feet she actually stands. “You’re a good friend, Dreng. And the Pathfinders have treated us fairly for all the years we’ve known each other.” Yiddlepode turns to the kobolds standing nearby, many wounded from the recent fight, but all focused intently on the current conversation. “Spread the word! From this day forward, any Sewer Dragon who wishes to join the Pathfinder Society may do so with my blessing. It is a large world, with much change and much opportunity swirling around us. Let us take this opportunity to spread our influence and gain new knowledge. Let the world to come be shaped by dragons!”</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>As Dreng watches the cheering kobolds pump their scaled fists into the air, a broad guffaw cracks his face in two, his head rolling back in unrestrained mirth. “Let the world to come be shaped by dragons, indeed” the venture-captain laughs, before a dark cloud passes across his features. “I expect we will need nothing less than dragons on our side in the days to come.” </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">The whole ship vibrated, and I gripped the edge of my bed, irrationally thinking <em>earthquake</em>, even though I hadn’t been on a planet in years. A metal blast sheet slammed down over the door of my lavish guest suite.</p> 
                <p><em>Honored human</em>, my liaison Ctherk mind-whispered to me. <em>I am told the Azlanti ship has launched an anchoring device and foiled our escape</em>. The shirren host, garbed in a red robe exactly the same hue as the fanciful ship we traveled in, stood before the viewscreen on the wall. <em>They pierced our hull with a metal spike, trailing a tether, and bound us together</em>. They gestured with a three-clawed hand and called up an image of the attacking ship.</p> 
                <p>I recognized the sacred geometries of an Azlanti Star Empire cruiser, one of the beautifully symmetrical ships crafted in the Imperial Foundry, hanging against the darkness like an elegant glass ornament. Death shouldn’t wear such a lovely form. The ship was probably Spindle-class, though I couldn’t be sure. I wished I’d paid more attention to reports on the Foundry during council meetings back on Absalom Station, but my work was focused on the Veskarium, the slightly <em>less</em> hostile interplanetary empire next door, rather than on the Azlanti. I vaguely recalled that Spindle-class ships were favored by the Azlanti Empire’s spy agency, so....</p> 
                <p>Oh, no.</p> 
                <p>“This isn’t a random attack,” I said. “I think they’re here for me.”</p> 
                <p>Ctherk’s mouthparts quivered and a chittering sound I couldn’t interpret emerged, one of the first verbalizations they’d made in my presence. <em>Why would they want you, honored delegate?</em></p> 
                <p>“I’m on my way to a summit in the Veskarium,” I said. “The uneasy peace between the Pact Worlds and the vesk has been strained lately, with attacks on the outskirts of various systems seeming to violate the truce in both directions. I’m supposed to go and reiterate our commitment to peace....” I shook my head. “I heard a theory that the attacks were organized by the Azlanti, using stolen vesk and Pact Worlds ships, hoping to destabilize relations between us. If they can make us fight each other, we’ll be weaker when the Empire decides to strike. If so, the Azlanti want to stop me from repairing relations... or to use me for some other scheme.”</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The ship vibrated, and a beautiful cut-glass decanter fell from a table and smashed onto the floor. <em>We are attempting to fight back</em>. The distaste in Ctherk’s mind-voice was evident. Despite popular belief, I knew not all shirrens were pacifists, but the ones on this luxurious diplomatic transport certainly were. That was part of why their vessels and crews were in such high demand for missions like mine. If you showed up for a summit in a Hivonyx Industries Diplomat-class cruiser like this one (its name was something in the shirren language which translated roughly to <em>Will They Or Won’t They</em>), crewed by peace-loving shirrens, everyone knew you weren’t planning a sneak attack or military treachery. That advantage was a weakness now, though. </p> 
                <p>“We actually have weapons on this thing?”</p> 
                <p><em>Sufficient to repel pirates and escape</em>, Ctherk said. <em>Likely not sufficient to fend off an Azlanti attack vessel that has already plunged a barbed stinger deep into our flesh.</em></p> 
                <p>I could see tiny specks pouring out of the enemy ship on screen. “Can you magnify that?”</p> 
                <p>Ctherk obliged. Those specks were people, wearing jet-packs of some kind, bearing rifles. “A boarding party,” I said. “Azlanti marines. Can they breach the ship?”</p> 
                <p><em>They have already gouged a hole in the hull</em>. The tone in my mind was mournful. <em>One of the upper decks suffered catastrophic decompression. Several of my hive-mates were lost.</em> </p> 
                <p>“Oh, Ctherk, I’m so sorry.” I took a long pause, allowing a moment of solemn gravity, thinking bitterly that my diplomatic training had taught me well. “How long can we hold them off?”</p> 
                <p><em>They.... Our tactical officer believes they are Aeon Guard.</em> </p> 
                <p>The elite shock-troops of the Empire, the spearhead of their invasion forces, the enforcers of their imperial goals. “Not long, then. What do we do?”</p> 
                <p>Ctherk’s mouthparts quivered. <em>Protocol is to shelter here while our officers negotiate with the aggressors.</em></p> 
                <p>“Ah,” I said. “So, wait here to be captured. I wonder if they’ll imprison me, or brainwash me, strap a bomb to me, and send me on to the summit?” My first absurd thought was that my career would be ruined; the Prime Executive had put me up for this mission personally, and its failure would reflect badly on me. My next thought was that I might be responsible for a new war between the Pact Worlds and the vesk. I tried to focus back on the first thought, but it was too late. </p> 
                <p>The viewscreen shifted to an interior view of a corridor on our ship. I didn’t know how far away that corridor was, but the <em>Will They Or Won’t They</em> was only about a hundred meters long, so it couldn’t be far. A group of four armored and blank-masked Aeon Guards stomped into view, moving as one, weapons held at port arms. They looked like they were in a formal parade, not a chaotic military action. One of them aimed and fired at something, and the screen went black.</p> 
                <p><em>The Azlanti are a curious people</em>, Ctherk said. <em>I confess I do not understand them. They are human, with individual wills, but they subjugate themselves, body and mind, to their leaders. They even choose to erase all signs of individuality with those faceless masks. It’s as if... they want to</em> become <em>the Swarm. </em></p> 
                <p>I could only nod. The shirrens were an offshoot of that monolithic insectoid race, descendants of Swarm members who’d rebelled, choosing individualism and peace over hive-minded destruction. They took physical pleasure from making even small choices, and I’d watched Ctherk luxuriate in the decision over which dessert to have at dinner the night before. I could understand why the faceless ranks of the lock-stepping Azlanti would strike them as particularly horrible. </p> 
                <p><em>Would you like to wait here for inevitable capture, or risk death for the chance at freedom?</em> Ctherk thought at me.</p> 
                <p>“Freedom,” I said, without hesitation.</p> 
                <p>I felt something like a smile appear in my mind. <em>Spoken like a shirren</em>. Ctherk slithered out of their robe, revealing their smaller pair of secondary arms, their chitinous exoskeleton, and their complicated, spiky legs.<em> Put this on, and pull the hood up.</em></p> 
                <p>I complied, hiding myself in meters of cloth. “What are we doing?”</p> 
                <p><em>I have coordinated with some of the crew. They will project their thoughts to the Azlanti, as if accidentally broadcasting too wide in a panic, and describe a false plan to take you to the hold of the ship and put you on board a shuttle. Perhaps they will be fooled. Meanwhile, I will escort you to an escape pod. It is equipped with stealth technology, and may avoid detection.</em></p> 
                <p>The blast doors rose up as Ctherk thumped a panel on the wall, which fell open to reveal a weapon that looked like a harpoon crossed with a plasma rife. <em>This is a non-lethal stunning weapon</em>, Ctherk said. <em>But it may buy time</em>.</p> 
                <p>“Once we get out of here—”</p> 
                <p><em>Once you get out of here, honored delegate. The escape pod has room only for one. </em></p> 
                <p>“Ctherk, if the Aeon Guards catch you, they’ll kill you. Even if I get away—”</p> 
                <p><em>Helping you is my choice</em>, Ctherk said. <em>The Azlanti would take all choice away. Please let me keep mine</em>.</p> 
                <p>I am a steely-eyed negotiator, unmoved by sentiment or emotion—that’s why I was chosen for this trip, because the vesk respect strength and cold clarity.</p> 
                <p>There were tears in my eyes as I put my hand on Ctherk’s smooth, hard shoulder. “The Pact Worlds thank you. Absalom Station thanks you. <em>I</em> thank you.”</p> 
                <p>Ctherk opened the door, and I followed them, into freedom or death.</p>

                <p>In addition to advice on how to build your characters so they fit into the ranks of the Edgewatch, this player’s guide includes a host of new character backgrounds to represent which city precinct you served in before transferring to Edgewatch. Whether you were a prodigy from the Learned Guard, an ex-acolyte who joined the Graycloaks after losing the faith, or a tough-as-nails detective from the Puddles, you’ll find your unique skills useful as you guard the newly revitalized Precipice Quarter from dangers both commonplace and out-of-this-world. To help orient yourself, the back of the player’s guide provides details on Absalom, the City at the Center of the World, including a map and descriptions of each of the city’s richly varied districts.</p> 
                <p>Due to the sensitive nature of roleplaying as city watch members in an Adventure Path, this player’s guide includes new required rules for players as well as guidance for Game Masters on how to mitigate or eliminate potentially upsetting aspects of the campaign—including running the campaign without roleplaying as city guards. This advice is intended to ensure that you have a safe, fun time playing Agents of Edgewatch.</p>
                <p> <br clear="all"> </p>
                <p>The following is just one of the 10 new character backgrounds in this player’s guide.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <h3>Learned Guard Prodigy — Background</h3> 
                 <p>For some, the nuts and bolts of keeping the peace are practically second nature. Such is the case for you, a member of the Learned Guard with an incredible mind for investigation as well as a gift for understanding magic. You probably aren’t a hit with your peers, who find your intellect and natural gift of deduction perhaps a bit off-putting, but when left to your own devices you excel, and you get along well with professors and mages such as those who work in Forae Logos or the Arcanamirium. </p> 
                 <p>After no shortage of debating the pros and cons, you decided to transfer to the Edgewatch precinct. Sure, you have a keen understanding of the theories and principles behind law enforcement, but you’ve reasoned that in order to be a truly effective guard you’ll need some first-hand experience in a high-risk area nabbing suspects and protecting innocents—all the while taking fastidious notes and writing your grand thesis on the merits and shortcomings of Absalom’s laws.</p> 
                 <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p> 
                 <p>You’re trained in your choice of the Arcana or Occultism skill, as well as Legal Lore. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks to interact with Learned Guards and with academics such as librarians and scholars. You gain the Recognize Spell skill feat.</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>There’s never a dull moment in the city of Absalom, and as a member of the Edgewatch you’ll have your hands full as you rescue citizens and travelers alike from villainous criminals. Make sure you’re prepared to save the day with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024wj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Agents-of-Edgewatch-Players-Guide"><em>Agents of Edgewatch Player’s Guide!</em></a></p>

                <p>In the core set, you can find Chief Zusgut—the most influential goblin in Absalom, the hippocampus-riding Wave Riders, and the amphibious humanoids known as the Low Azlant. You can also go on a quest for duergar, xulgath, dinosaurs, centaurs, minotaurs, harpies, and much more by the Brick, Booster, and Case. Collect all 44 miniatures!</p> 
                <p>Unlike a normal set, which comes with a single premium figure (or scene set) that’s directly tied to the purchase of an entire case of minis, this set features not one, but two different premium products. The first is a double offering of Huge dragons in the form of an Adult Black and Adult Red Dragon. These two beautiful display pieces stand several inches tall and dwarf the other miniatures in the <em>Pathfinder Battles: City of Lost Omens</em> set. </p>

                <p itemprop="description">Amanda Hamon joined the Paizo fam back at the start of April in 2015 and now she’s heading off to new adventures where she will be joining the Kobold Press fam as Editorial Director. (The Kobold empire is hers!—I can’t confirm that, but it’s likely.)</p> 
                <p>This blog has been hard for me to write. Amanda has been my partner in crime here at Paizo since she joined us, and for more than three years we’ve been managing the development of Pathfinder and Starfinder together. We’ve been collaborators and conspirators. We’ve been friends and confidants. We’ve been there for each other and we’ve worked long nights and some weekends to make sure that y’all get quality gaming material. We’ve made sure that our teams and our freelancers were taken care of and had what they needed to get the job done. We made a pact to let each other know if we had plans on leaving the company, so I was among the first to hear of this. I’m really sad to see her move on, and not having her here with me to talk over the kind of decisions we make is going to be hard. But, I know I will carry on the things she’s taught me to make the best calls I can. Thank you, Amanda.</p> 
                <p>As co-managers, we worked so well together. There have been so few work relationships I’ve had in my life that have been as flawless. I can’t think of a single time in our years that we ever disagreed with how we should handle something. We were always side-by-side on the decisions we made, and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better partner and colleague. </p> 
                <p>We’ve also had a lot of fun. We made rad games. Together we drove our company to better standards. Together we worked hard with other folks on the staff to make our conventions and those who attend them safer. Together we helped make positive and engaging (and creepy) content in the books we oversaw. Together we worked our asses off setting up for conventions (and we celebrated our victories for doing so—as we should!).</p> 
                <p>Amanda was a freelancer for us when I first joined the Paizo staff, and some of her early work for us was among the first I worked on as a staff developer. I was super impressed and continued to reach out to her for freelance work and encouraged other developers on staff to do so. She came from a journalism background, and that professionalism totally showed. Journalists know how to hit a deadline and deal with editorial standards. </p> 
                <p>Amanda, I wish you all the best in your new role of making awesome game material for folks! Wolfgang has certainly scooped up great talent and I know that you’re going to be an absolute asset to that company. I’ll miss working with you on the day-to-day, but I know that we’ll still hang out (and still talk shop!). Much love to you. I’ll miss you, and keep kicking all the ass you’ve always kicked!</p> 
                <p>Now I’ll share this space to let others in the company to give their thoughts.</p>

                <hr> 
                <br> 
                <p><b>James Jacobs:</b><br> Amanda! Your influence on Paizo is indisputable—you made the company better, and even though you're off to be a kobold now, I know that we'll continue to benefit from your influence and presence and imagination. Thank you for all of the hours/days/weeks spent in conversations about vampires and ghosties and sinister monsters and all the things that go bump in the night. Thank you for all the amazing adventures, particularly in helping to launch the first Adventure Path for 2nd edition Pathfinder. And thank you especially for the ghost pirates and the acid spewing crater aliens and the forever-quest of Groetus-vision-fueled pursuits of doubtful wine and questionable repasts. Most of those shenanigans will, of course, continue onward into the future, but when we finally get back to the office after all these months of working from home, with you not there to kick in my office door with conversations about creepy mushroom gifs or dancing clowns or brain-collecting vampires or which incarnations of Dracula are best (and which ones should be avoided forever)… the building will still feel emptier than before.</p> 
                <p><b>Devinne Caples:</b><br> I only really got to know Amanda on her way out. I have to say she is vibrant, intelligent, and down to Earth. A true joy to be around. Though our time working together was short, I wish Amanda the absolute best in her new position and in the adventures to come! Congratulations!</p> 
                <p><b>Jason Keeley:</b><br> Amanda and I moved across the country and started at Paizo at about the same time, and though we were in different departments (I was an editor then), we were in the same boat. She was, of course, super friendly and a pleasure to work with, but I didn’t get to know the real Amanda until we started gaming together. From board games to video games to RPGs, we’ve had hundreds of hours of fun in a style that I can describe only as “controlled chaos.” I’m going to miss her at the office terribly, but this feeling is tempered by the fact that I’m certain we’ll be gaming together again real soon (For the Crimson Eel!). If you ever get the chance to work with Amanda on a project, you should take it, and if you ever get the chance to play with her, consider yourself truly lucky because you’re in for a wacky, fun time! Cheers, Amanda!</p> 
                <p><b>James Sutter: </b><br> Amanda is one of the best game industry folks I've had the privilege to work with. Among many other projects, she was crucial in the development of the Starfinder Core Rulebook, especially when it came to figuring out ways to make the game fun and welcoming to the widest possible audience. She's someone you can always depend on—when everything's on fire and the wheels seem about to come off the bus, you know Amanda will be there to help you drag things across the finish line, and keep you laughing the whole time. I'm delighted that she's taking on such a huge role with Kobold, and I can't wait to see what she does with it!</p> 
                <p><b>John Compton:</b><br> Amanda, in your 5 years at Paizo you’ve always brought energy, ideas, leadership, compassion, perspective, and excitement to your work. From re-imagining devils to treading new ground for kobolds under that Hellknight Hill to working together to devise the future of mechs in Starfinder, you’ve always brought fresh inspiration and a readiness to question tired traditions.</p> 
                <p>Most of all, though, you’ve reminded us of what lies at the heart of the gaming experience: fun. Plumbing the depths of Elemental Evil wouldn’t have been the same without your reckless, sword-swinging, squirrel-toting antics. The ongoing story of rebuilding Crookcove isn’t complete without your character’s distinguished approach to Groetus. And of course, who can forget your bare-knuckle homages to the past decades’ wrestling greats in the wild antics of XTREM?</p> 
                <p>…you have a lot of antics. Never change.</p> 
                <p>For every grimdark conundrum and deep space disaster science-fantasy can deliver, your approach reminds us that in a setting so replete with weird worlds and utterly bizarre aliens, the genre is just as effective a conduit for levity. Your future projects gives the gaming community so much more to look forward to!</p> 
                <p><b>Judy Bauer:</b><br> Amanda, I’ve missed seeing you in person for months, and I’m going to miss your professional yet metal presence even more once you’re at Kobold Press. You’re gonna knock their socks off!</p> 
                <p><b>John Feil:</b><br> <u>A haiku…</u><br> Amanda Hamon<br> Her name has five syllables<br> and we will miss her</p> 
                <p><b>Payton Smith: </b><br> Amanda was always professional, attentive, and hilarious in the right moments. In all my years on working with developers and game industry professionals, Amanda Hamon will always be the shining example I will point to when talking to curious individuals seeking to enter this industry</p> 
                <p>For my single year at being here in Paizo, I’ve’d learned a lot from Amanda. And I wish her well in all of the things she will most certainly excel at in the future.</p> 
                <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer:</b><br> Amanda and I started at Paizo right around the same time, as Assistant Developers. She quickly established herself as the person who could do anything, the multitalented rock star who was always getting pushed on to whatever project was in the direst situation. And it wasn't long before people learned to rely upon her. I know I'm not the only person she's inspired with her determination, wisdom, empathy, and humor. Amanda's departure is a big loss for all of us at Paizo, but I know that she's going to do great at her new position. Keep being awesome, Amanda!</p> 
                <p><b>Aaron Shanks:</b><br> When I first came to Paizo I learned Amanda used to be a reporter, which might help explain why she was so articulate on camera. As a new PR Manager it was nice for me to talk things out with her. That poise was always present off camera. I'll miss having her on the team.</p> 
                <p><b>Lyz Liddell:</b><br> Amanda is the reason I moved to the Pacific Northwest to take on a full-time gig working for Paizo. I’d been lurking in the remote lands of Ohio as a full-time contractor for years, but when my contract was forced to end (thanks Microsoft?), it was Amanda who reached out to try and recruit me. She took the time out of her day to get me on a video call (way less common in pre-quarantine days) and talk me through the process of moving from the Midwest to the PNW and making a living making games—the good, the bad, the weird, the delightful. I ended up not taking Amanda’s offer (Judy Bauer stole me instead!) but I really think I wouldn’t have been brave enough to move out here if it weren’t for Amanda. Working with her has been a delight, and I can’t wait to see what wacky schemes she comes up with next.</p> 
                <p><b>Jason Bulmahn:</b><br> It is rare and special thing to work with someone who has such boundless optimism, infectious laugh, and tireless dedication to the craft. Amanda has all three in excess. She is an incredible creative force, and everything she touches turns out so much better thanks to her imagination and passion for games. I am sad to see her go, but and I am incredibly excited to see what she comes up with in her new endeavors.</p> 
                <p><b>Tonya Woldridge:</b><br> I enjoyed the time we spent working on convention circuit–long hours filled with laughs and voices and I thank you for the memories. UK trips just won’t be the same without you. I look forward to seeing what you do in future, as your creativity, drive, and passion for writing expand our industry. Best wishes on your future endeavors!</p> 
                <p><b>Diego Valdez:</b><br> Amanda’s and my jobs don’t really intersect, so we don’t see each other much in the office. Despite that we have become pretty good friends. Amanda has helped me build friendships with many wonderful people who are now mutual friends. I will always appreciate that. At an old job that closed up shop I was really sad because my coworkers were awesome. One of them reminded me that, “Even if you don't work with them anymore, you can still be friends with your coworkers.” Since then I have always tried to remember that when someone leaves. The office won’t be the same without her there, but that doesn’t mean we have to stop going to watch wrestling. Amanda, you’re a wonderful, awesome, SOLID STEEL friend! All my best wishes in your new adventure!</p> 
                <p><b>Erik Mona:</b><br> Amanda Hamon made a huge impact on Paizo from the moment she arrived to the moment she left us for an awesome editorial opportunity at another company last Friday. Her keen development skills, strong management of Starfinder’s developers, and her moral compass have been great assets to the editorial department as well as to Paizo as a whole, and we will miss her terribly. Amanda brought the same level of enthusiasm to her job as a leader and manager at Paizo as she did throwing herself into the role of a jittery space goblin at a convention demo. I’ll never forget the way her stunning, professional-grade goblin impression echoed through the halls of PaizoCon, bringing a smile to anyone who ever heard of it. Amanda’s also been a road warrior during her time here, helping with Gen Con booth set-up and tear-down, representing our games at industry conferences, and demoing across the land, from Seattle to Indianapolis to Philadelphia to the UK. Recently, we all got a chance to sit at her table thanks to the astounding Starfinder XTREM streaming game on our official Twitch channel. Had someone else pitched a game based on professional wrestling in the Starfinder universe, I might have balked. Not so with Amanda. I knew she would do a fantastic job, just as she has for every other task we’ve put before her since coming here (and, as a freelance writer, since even before that). Congratulations, Amanda! We all look forward to seeing what you create next. You made a tremendous impact upon Paizo’s culture, upon all your colleagues, and upon Paizo itself. See you on the road!</p>

               <div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;">
                <a href="/image/content/Blog/070620_JirellePreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/070620_JirellePreview_500.jpeg"></a>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“They tell stories of this stuff up in Ustalav. Call it ‘fishgold’,” Jirelle said as she turned the heavy statuette over in her hands. The craft of the ugly thing wasn’t impressive, but the value of the red-tinted gold was undeniable. “You should throw it back.”</p> 
                <p>Captain Trank’s eyes widened comically, and Jirelle was again struck by how unappealing the man’s countenance was—and how appropriate the name of his ship was. “Throw it back?” he gasped. “This thing’s gotta be worth at least a hundred gold. You’re asking me to throw treasure overboard because some backwards lubber thousands of miles away has some sort of superstition? What kind of mercenary are you? You afraid of getting rich or something?”</p> 
                <p>Jirelle shrugged. “You called me in here to ask my opinion. I gave it. You hired me to help protect the <em>Seatoad</em> from danger. I did it. But I’m not part of your crew, so I don’t have to put up with your ignorance. Your stubbornness. Your lack of empathy. But regardless of what I think about you personally, and regardless of the fact that we’ve arrived at port, I’ve grown fond of your crew. So that makes me concerned for the <em>Seatoad's</em> safety. The ones who craft fishgold don’t give up on their creations easily when they’re snatched from their clutches. If you value your crew and your ship... you should throw it back,” she repeated as she tossed the statuette onto the cluttered desk amid Trank’s tacky collection of figurines. She tried not to look too pleased as the top-heavy thing flopped over and smashed a particularly ostentatious ceramic toad.</p> 
                <p>As she stood up, she again cast a disparaging eye over the furnishing of Captain Trank’s quarters. A real captain of the Shackles wouldn’t be caught dead among such base frippery. She wiped her palm against the back of the chair, as if to try to scrape the scent of fishgold from her hand. Captain Trank was sputtering. “How dare you? You’re lucky I don’t have you clapped in irons for disrespecting me, elf! You can forget about your bonus!”</p> 
                <p>Jirelle paused, mid-step toward the door. “Half-elf,” she said under her breath. Her hand dropped to the hilt of her sword as she started to turn. “And for another thing, Trank...” she began, deliberately omitting his title, only to pause as the alarm bell rang out on deck. Both of them listened to the crew’s screams for a heartbeat before Jirelle flashed the captain a dazzling smile. “...it sounds like I’m about to earn that bonus after all</p> 
                <p>She threw the door open and leapt out on deck, not surprised in the slightest to see a scaly green tide seething up over the <em>Seatoad's</em> bulwarks. While Jirelle recognized the creatures as ulat-kinis (or more commonly “skums” to those surface folk the creatures often preyed upon), she didn’t understand the guttural language the creatures were shrieking. Nonetheless, she knew what they wanted. Blood for fishgold.</p> 
                <p>There were over a dozen of them already on deck, and she could see half again as many more clambering up onto the pier the <em>Seatoad</em> had docked at. Further out, villagers were yelling and pointing and screaming, but Jirelle knew that there’d be no aid from them in time to save the crew. She barked a laugh, drew her sword, and leapt into the fray.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/070620_Jirelle.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/070620_Jirelle.jpg" alt="Pathfinder Iconic Jirelle"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Jirelle, the iconic swashbuckler, swings into action in this exciting illustration by Stefano Moroni from the <i><a href="“https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide”">Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</a></i>, available everywhere July 30!</p>
                </div> 
                <p>The crew was already engaging the ulat-kinis, but it was obvious that against a foe driven by vengeance and armed with claws, teeth, and tridents, the <em>Seatoad's</em> sailors were outmatched. Jirelle leapt up onto the bulwarks and raced along the narrow beam to where the nearest skum was preparing to skewer the bosun. She whipped her bright red cloak out, cracking it like a whip in front of the leering monster, and as he foolishly snapped at it, Jirelle was already behind him. The creature snarled, then spun to face her.</p> 
                <p>“Best of luck in the next life, fishlips,” she said, then held up her sword in a salute. It was already dripping with blood, and the ulat-kini was already collapsing to the deck from the precise, killing blow she’d struck before it realized it’d been stabbed.</p> 
                <p>Jirelle bounced from the bulwarks onto a rain barrel near the mast. Balancing atop the open barrel with a foot on each edge, she called out to the slavering sea of green on deck before her. “Leave them alone! The one who has your gold’s back in the cabin behind me!” She shook her head as the creatures shrieked and hissed and slobbered, obviously not understanding her words, but she had their attention. That’s what really mattered.</p> 
                <p>As the ulat-kinis scrambled forward, Jirelle kicked with one foot, tipping the barrel over onto its side. The sudden deluge of water was enough to knock one skum from its feet, and as she ran atop the rolling barrel, the others watched in disbelief—up until the point the heavy barrel smashed into a pair of them, knocking them over as well.</p> 
                <p>Jirelle had vacated her position atop the barrel an instant before it bowled the two fishy creatures over and now clung to a rope in the rigging along the ship’s port side. Her blade swept to the left, then the right, catching and turning aside trident thrusts and replying with precisely delivered jabs of her own. As the creatures dropped to the increasingly bloody deck below, Jirelle caught sight of what could only be their leader. With a particularly wicked looking trident gripped in his hands, the ulat-kini commander had clambered up onto the nearby pier and was barking out commands to the scaly masses.</p> 
                <p>With a slash that simultaneously cut the neck of a skum and the rope bound to a cleat at her feet, Jirelle used the momentum to swing out over the churning gap between the <em>Seatoad</em> and the pier. She landed with a pirouette, then came up to face the monster with a wink. The creature’s eyes widened as it took a step back, surprised that the half-elf was suddenly perched on a piling just above him.</p> 
                <p>“You the one in charge here?” she asked, not caring if the commander understood her or not. Her blade stabbed out, precisely striking the creature between the gills, confidently finishing him off with a twist of the wrist. As the commander toppled into the waters below the pier with a foamy red gurgle, she whipped her blade to the side to clean it of blood. “Oh... guess not anymore!”</p> 
                <p>The sound of the remaining ulat-kinis crying out in fear and the splashes as they dove from the <em>Seatoad’s</em> deck into the waters below brought a smile to Jirelle’s lips, but as she turned to look back at the ship she’d been hired to protect for the past several weeks, that smile broadened.</p> 
                <p>It hadn’t been her displays of panache and bravado that had driven the monsters off. It was the sight of the bright red tentacles slithering up from the sea to grip the <em>Seatoad</em> by the stern that had done that. Captain Trank’s squeal of shocked fear was unmistakable as a tentacle slithered in through a cabin porthole. The crew had largely abandoned the ship by now and were fleeing up the pier to the shore, but as unappealing as the captain had been, Jirelle wasn’t about to let him be pulled below by whatever was attached to the unseen end of those tentacles.</p> 
                <p>She swung back from the pier onto the ship’s deck, already anticipating Trank’s reaction to being saved by the woman he’d just insulted. The ulat-kinis may have fled, but as Jirelle stepped forward to start cutting away at those writhing crimson limbs, she knew that the real fun was only just beginning!</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, July 12, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> 
                </ul>

                <p itemprop="description">First, the elephant: Let me say that we did not expect the title of our latest Pathfinder Adventure Card Society epic to be so prophetic. <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pacg/pacs/year6"><em>Year of Rotting Ruin</em></a> brought gamers a sweeping torrent of plagues, economic chaos, civil unrest, and... well, anyway. Sometimes you pick a theme and sometimes the theme picks you.</p> 
                <p>With that said, I want to wrap up one of the best Adventure Paths you’ll find in our eight-year Pathfinder Adventure Card Game history. Year of Rotting Ruin was the first Pathfinder Adventure Card Society AP to use our new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7"><em>Core Set</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> Adventure Path. Coordinator Linda Zayas-Palmer, designer Keith Richmond, and storytellers Elizabeth Corrigan, Katina Davis, Jaym Gates, Steven Hammond, Ron Lundeen, Jennifer Povey, and Diego Valdez crafted an intricate and pulse-pounding series of tales. These are not the kind of tales you tell your kids. These are the kind you read with one hand in front of your face.</p> 
                <p>If you’ve finished <em>The Dragon’s Demand</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>, and are wondering what to do next, here’s a travelogue through your next nightmare.</p> 
                <br> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0601E.jpg"><img width="200" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0601E.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Pathfinder Extinction Curse Adventure Path: The Apocalypse Prophet book cover"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>To start off, in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zry?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-6-1-City-of-Sails-and-Shrouds"><em>Adventure 1: City of Sails and Shrouds</em></a>, the forces of evil blew up a city. Straight up obliterated Vigil clean off the map. With the capital of Lastwall destroyed by the long-dead lich called the Whispering Tyrant, the Pathfinders faced the challenges of trying to help the citizens of the nearby city of Vellumis deal with the strife. Ron Lundeen and Linda Zayas-Palmer came up with scenario concepts that dealt with evacuations of refugees, uprisings of looters, and demonic forces stoking fear and chaos. </p> 
                <p>I’ll offer spoilers on one scenario per adventure in this blog. Scenario 1D: Treating the infection had a rude awakening for the players: You get arrested! Keith invented a delightful (to me, not to you) mechanic for how you deal with life behind bars. Good luck with that.</p> 
                <p>Also, there are sharks. Jigsaw Sharks. I don’t think there’s a card in this game whose title I love more than that.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <br> 
                <hr> 
                <br> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0602E_500.jpeg"><img width="200" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0602E_500.jpeg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Pathfinder Extinction Curse Adventure Path: The Apocalypse Prophet book cover"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>Dealing with these problems treated the symptoms, not the cause. Vellumis was wracked with peril, but it would have to fend for itself. To save the splintering province of Lastwall, writer Steven Hammond sends our heroes far into darkness in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217d?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-62-Urgathoas-Persistent-Shadow"><em>Adventure 2: Urgathoa’s Persistent Shadow</em></a>. </p> 
                <p>Scenario 2B: Spoiled Victuals features the return—and return, and return—of a card that’s been with us from the beginning: Plague Zombie. In this scenario, you really would prefer they stayed dead. It’s good to want things.</p> 
                <p>Also in this scenario, we meet the supporters Ketrik, Boors, and Moise, a trio of guards whose allegiance will become important. You decide which to rally when, and those decisions will affect your game thereafter for quite some time.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>Jennifer Povey kicks off <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021d5?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-63-Fortress-of-Ruin"><em>Adventure 3: Fortress of Ruin</em></a> with a deeply involving harrow reading, and—spoiler alert—it doesn’t augur well. </p> 
                <p>Scenario 3B: Fear and Flame begins with a sentence I’m sure you’re thrilled about: “Add the Perils wildcard Ablaze.” It’s a scenario Keith Richmond festooned with Traps amid burning buildings. Can you run through a maze of fire to get out? I’m sure it won’t hurt much.</p> 
                <p>Hey, I mentioned there’s a lich at the heart of this Adventure Path. I’ll bet you think that means you’ll fight that lich in Adventure 6. Nope! You run into a most fearsome foe halfway through the Adventure Path. If you win—no guarantee there—what could possibly await on the other side of an undead lord?</p>

                <p>In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021xh?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-64-What-Stalks-the-Shadows-PDF"><em>Adventure 4: What Stalks the Shadows</em></a>, you return to Vellumis in the wake of the battle with the lich. Unsurprisingly, things haven’t gone perfectly in your absence. It seems that the Whispering Tyrant had conspirators in your city. In Diego Valdez’s story, you have to navigate a twisty road of backstabbing and betrayal.</p> 
                <p>Like for example, when all the statues take wing and ambush you. Scenario 4B: Rock and Steel features a host of Ashwing Gargoyles pounding you with rocks, and also the first (but not last) appearance of a sentence that will tempt you in ways you won’t comprehend at first: “Once each turn, you may bury a card to explore.” Let’s see if you are willing to strip down that deck to make progress. Sounds good, right? Did I mention the Ashwing Gargoyles?</p> 
                <p>Time for Adventure 5! Wait, is that a record scratch I hear?</p>

                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>Surprise! We dropped a totally unexpected standalone adventure in between AP chapters. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor"><em>Standalone Adventure 1: A Night at Bloodthorn Manor</em></a>, a group of children wander into a haunted house, and you have to get them out. The story text by Jaym Gates is fun and creepy and really weird, and I love all of it.</p> 
                <p>I mean, how confident are you when you read a note that says:</p> 
                <center>
                 <b>“We are safe. Daddy will take care of the bad people.”</b>
                </center> 
                <p>Some confident? None confident?</p> 
                <p>I also love how Keith sets a trap for you in <em>Scenario D: Unfinished Business</em>. You get to choose your wildcards, one per character for this one. A six-player group starting with six wildcards had better make some careful choices.</p> 
                <br clear="all">

                <br> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0605E.jpg"><img width="200" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0605E.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Pathfinder Extinction Curse Adventure Path: The Apocalypse Prophet book cover"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>Taking us back to the AP, Katina Davis sets the stage for the return to Lastwall and a journey to the city of Ardis in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c5?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-65-Echoes-of-Death"><em>Adventure 5: Echoes of Death</em></a>. The city faces an uprising of previously dead monsters as well as an assassination attempt on its noble countess. Plus, there’s a giant golem in your way. That’s a lot to handle.p&gt; </p>
                <p>In Scenario 5B: Race for the Cemetery, Keith asks the heretofore unasked question, “What if every location was a Graveyard?” In case you’ve blotted it out of your memory, Graveyard is the Core Set location where every monster is Undead, and closing it spawns more Undead. So if every location is a Graveyard... well, you do the math.</p> 
                <p>And look, if there’s Undead everywhere, and this whole Adventure Path centers around a long-slain lich, you probably want to re-slay the Whispering Tyrant here. Otherwise, you’ll never make it to the end of this epic quest.</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <br> 
                <hr> 
                <br> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0606E.jpg"><img width="200" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPACS0606E.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Pathfinder Extinction Curse Adventure Path: The Apocalypse Prophet book cover"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                <p>All right, you’ve finally ended the threat of the Whispering Tyrant. Except... you haven’t. You still have to find his phylactery, which is the only way you can guarantee you won’t have to re-re-slay him. And that’s going to lead you to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0232x?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-66-Deaths-Vengeance"><em>Adventure 6: Death’s Vengeance</em></a>.</p> 
                <p>Lich-fighting makes strange bedfellows, so in the middle of this adventure, Elizabeth Corrigan and Keith Richmond give you one of the nastiest choices this game has ever seen: either ally with the Red Mantis assassins who promise they’re going to kill you later, or refuse their help and expect them to try to kill you now. Whether you choose to play <em>Scenario 6C1: An Unlikely Alliance</em> or <em>Scenario 6C2: Backstabbed</em>, you’ll come out of it in quite a different shape for your final boss fight. </p> 
                <p>It all ends in an arena of blood, but I won’t say any more about that. Well, except that once you’ve finished the six-course meal that is the Adventure Path proper, we tempt you with a wafer-thin mint of a bonus scenario that puts the lever controlling risk versus reward directly into your own hands. After all this, are you going to take the easy way out? (We didn’t think so.)</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <p>Year of Rotting Ruin is a big, soaring, down-in-the-muck Adventure Path. If you’re done with The Dragon’s Demand and Curse of the Crimson Throne, you owe it to yourself to pick it up. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll make it through alive.</p> 
                <p>Adventures Ahead!</p>

                <h2>OPM Musings</h2> 
                <p itemprop="description">With two online conventions under our belt, we’ve got our processes down. That being said, there are still several more in the pipeline – Virtually Expo (to replace UK Games Expo) and Gen Con being the next on the horizon. Besides conventions, we have lots more going on in the OP realm, so I’m going to end my musings with a huge thank you to all our GMs and volunteers organizing games. As the world starts to resume in-person gatherings, I’ll note each community will decide when and how to approach in person gaming and request that all our players work with their organizers to take suggested precautions and keep our community safe, healthy, and happy. </p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <h2>Achievement Point Update</h2> 
                <p>Another month, another few code rolls getting us ever closer to the final launch of the Achievement Points (AcP) system. For those keeping a close eye, you may have seen the rolls last week. They fixed our outstanding issues but had a few unintended problems that we needed to resolve before we could keep the roll live. We’ve now resolved character number issues, points accrued from Premier and Premier Plus events, GM credits, and how boons generate from the system, as well as a few other back end items. This is in line to be resolved after our long weekend and we hope to have the final deployment soon.</p> 
                <p>This brings into question the free rebuild boon that is currently on the site. I said previously that we would remove the boon two weeks after AcP went live. Given that we are less than 30 days from the release of the Advanced Players Guide, I want to amend my commentary. We will extend the date of the free rebuild to <b>31 August</b>. This allows us enough time to get the APG sanctioned and for players to use the rebuild to include options from that book. </p> 
                <p>We’ve made a change to the rebuild boon, however. One of the code rolls gave the ability to customize the boons beyond the one sentence preview. With this live, we are adjusting the rebuild boon to the style we will use with all other AcP purchases. The full text of the boon outlines the parameters for rebuild, including a all changes are final once character is played and a slight recalculation of the gold your character has post-rebuild, to account for any consumables you have purchased &amp; used as well as a favorable resale value of items. This is intended to make the rebuild easier: rather than having to calculate the value of every item you have purchased and used since creating the character, you will now simply have 85% of the gold you have earned during the character’s career to that point. This revised rebuild went live today. Any unapplied rebuilds that don’t this text will still be honored. In that case, the player should utilize the 85% rule when rebuilding. Players who rebuilt characters prior to this blog do not need to make adjustments to their characters. In all cases, a copy of the boon should be included in the character’s chronicle sheet history.</p> 
                <p>Another note on AcP. Most of the point totals have settled. You can review your totals in your “My Organized Play” section of Paizo.com. If you are seeing errors in your AcP count, make sure to click the “Refresh Points” button on the GM/Event Coordinator tab of your My Organized Play page. If there are still errors, check to make sure all your games are reported. If they aren’t, please reach out to the coordinator/local venture officer with your chronicles to get the game entered into the system. If all games are accounted for, then email <a href="mailto:pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com">pfsreportingerrors@paizo.com</a> with as much detail as you can about the errors so that we can take a look and make adjustments as needed. This email should also be used for any other reporting errors if your GM or event coordinator is unable to fix them.</p> 
                <p>One final piece of AcP. We’ve solicited a list of frequently asked questions and are working on putting together answers. We hope to have this done before it goes live and will post a link in the comments as well as distribute the link to our community.</p> 
                <h2>Gen Con Online</h2> 
                <p>Our next major online convention is just weeks away! Gen Con Online will be July 30-August 2, and we currently have nearly 900 games on offer for our four programs. The event catalog will be available for preview on July 6 on <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" target="_blank">Gen Con’s website</a>. For GMs who haven’t signed up yet, we invite you to register for the OPF Major Events discord, as there are still opportunities to volunteer; for more information on how to play or GM games, visit <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sha1?Organized-Play-at-Gen-Con-Online-2020">last week’s blog post</a>. Next week we’ll be previewing the new scenario releases you’ll see at Gen Con Online.</p> 
                <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>This month, we <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9i?June-2020-Pathfinder-Society-Releases">released the sanctioning</a> for the Age of Ashes Adventure Path for Pathfinder (second edition). Players and GMs may now report their sessions and earn credit for the AP. Additionally, last week we announced the winner of the Battle of the Pantheons contest, and their pantheon has <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sha2?Battle-of-the-Pantheons-Winner-Announcement">officially been sanctioned</a> as well!</p> 
                <p>Going forward, we have plans to get Near Space sanctioned for Starfinder Society and the Advanced Player’s Guide sanctioned for Pathfinder Society before the end of the month. There may be more, but these two are the next ones on our radar.</p> 
                <h2>Volunteer Recognition.</h2> 
                <p>No new campaign coins have been awarded since PaizoCon Online.</p> 
                <p>We did announce our Order of the Wayfinder for 2019. We usually announce this recipient at Gen Con or PaizoCon, but we held it last year to try and do it in person. Unfortunately, our lack of travel thwarted our plans, so we announced it virtually at the most recent Venture-Captain gathering when the recipient was in attendance.</p> 
                <p>The Order of the Wayfinder is a step above the Campaign Coin and is given to one person a year in recognition of their efforts on behalf of some aspect of the Organized Play Program. Their activities support the actions of the entire community and make a huge difference in the quality of our programming. The award comes with a wayfinder (compass) with an engraved plaque and a new organized play number in the 100’s.</p> 
                <p>Past recipients included Bob Jonquet, Auke Teeninga, and Alastair Rigg.</p> 
                <p>Please join me in recognizing <b>Alexander Lenz</b> as the 2019 recipient for his coordination of the Additional Resources Task Force. The AR Task Force is a group of individuals drawn from the volunteer organizers who review published materials for inclusion in the relevant organized play campaign and make recommendations to the Organized Play team. Without their input, completing our sanctioning documents would be a much different task. Thank you, Alex, for the years you’ve spent leading the Task Force!</p> 
                <h2>Stars, Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>We have no new GMs to recognize yet, but part of the updates rolling out with AcP will also allow our venture-captains to easily and automatically provide evaluations to GMs who request them. This will help us automate the process and get our top-tier GMs their badges and recognition sooner!</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>Many of the conventions planned for the upcoming months have needed to cancel or postpone due to shelter in place orders, but several others moved their events online. We’ve listed the status for each event, but please check their websites or notices for any last-minute changes.</p>

                <p>One final note on conventions: the team has decided to award Premier Plus status to all conventions that report 75 or more tables in their After-Action Report. As a result, you may see an increase in your AcP if you played at a qualifying convention.</p>
