  \ thick tree branches. In the foreground, Harsk, a gruff gnome ranger with long\
  \ hair and an almost equally long beard, is peering out from behind large, leafy\

  \ to brush back overgrown greenery from a stone column twice her height and half\
  \ as wide. She holds a torch in her left hand, which lights the image in dark red.\
  \ She has partially revealed square-shaped carvings in the side of the column. Behind\
  \ her - to the right - her snow leopard companion Droogami, looks  to see what she's\
  \ discovered.\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by Will\
  \ O'Brien</p>\n      </div> \n      <h2>Exploring</h2> \n      <p>Most of the time\
  \ when you're adventuring, you're exploring. Whether you're examining a dusty tomb,\
  \ blazing trails through a dense jungle, or disguising your way into an enemy fortress,\
  \ exploration is all about discovery. It takes place on a fluid time scale, ranging\
  \ from roughly 10 minutes to hours, or even days for a long overland expedition.\
  \ It's dangerous to go alone, especially when you don't know if you'll have an important\
  \ skill you need to brave the perils of a dungeon, but fortunately you'll be part\
  \ of a team. If you're an expert or better in a skill, you'll be able to help your\
  \ allies with that skill while exploring, by coaching your less athletic teammates\
  \ up the cliffside and spotting the worst of the climb, using hand gestures to sneak\
  \ your louder allies past the guards at the best moment, and more!</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ addition to a handful of exploration actions characters can take while in this\
  \ game mode, the book also presents a number of skills that can be used while exploring.</p>\

  \ alt=\"Text inset: SKILL EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES. Chapter 4: Skills include numerous\
  \ additional exploration activities, which are summarized here.  \r\nBorrow an Arcane\
  \ Spell: You use Arcana to prepare a spell from someone else's spellbook (page 241).\r\
  \nCoerce: You use Intimidation to threaten a creature so it does what you want (page\
  \ 247).\r\nCover Tracks: You use Survival to obscure your passing (page 252).\r\n\
  Decipher Writing: You use a suitable skill to understand archaic, esoteric, or obscure\
  \ texts (page 234).\r\nGather Information: You use Diplomacy to canvass the area\
  \ to learn about a specific individual or topic (page 246).\r\nIdentify Alchemy:\
  \ You use Craft and alchemist's tools to identify an alchemical item (page 245).\r\
  \nIdentify Magic: Using a variety of skills, you can learn about a magic item, location,\
  \ or ongoing effect (page 238). \r\nImpersonate: You use Deception and usually a\
  \ disguise kit to create a disguise (page 245).\r\nLearn a Spell: You use the skill\
  \ corresponding to the spell’s tradition to gan access to a new spell (page 238).\r\
  \nMake an Impression: You use Diplomacy to make a good impression on someone (page\
  \ 246). \r\nRepair: With a repair kit and the Crafting skill, you fix a damaged\
  \ item (page 243).\r\nSense Direction: You use Survival to get a sense of where\
  \ you are or determine the cardinal directions (page 252).\r\nSqueeze: Using Acrobatics,\
  \ you squeeze through very tight spaces (page 241).\r\nTrack: You use Survival to\
  \ find and follow creatures’ tracks (page 252).\r\nTreat Wounds: You use Medicine\
  \ to treat a living creature’s wounds (page 249). \"> \n      </div> \n      <h2>Encounter</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>When every action matters, your characters enter an encounter, proceeding\
  \ turn by turn, action by action. These crop up in the middle of exploration, putting\
  \ your travels on hold so you can deal with an immediate danger or opportunity.\
  \ Combat encounters are the most typical encounters, taking place on a scale of\
  \ mere seconds between life and death, but all encounters share a common structure:\
  \ you roll initiative to determine turn order, then you take turns, performing your\
  \ actions and determining what happens. In a combat encounter, each turn you get\
  \ one reaction and three actions you can spend however you want. For instance, on\
  \ her turn in combat, a sorcerer might spend all three actions to unleash a deadly\
  \ barrage of <em>magic missiles</em> while a fighter might raise his shield and\
  \ then use a Sudden Charge to rush an enemy and attack.</p> \n      <p>It's during\
  \ encounters that most player characters will bestow conditions upon their foes,\
  \ or gain a condition as the result of the conflict. To make the wide range of conditions\
  \ that can come into play easier for new players to learn, we provide a full-page\
  \ list of them without any of the associated rules. This allows someone to quickly\
  \ reference what it means to be stunned or stupefied, and tell the difference between\
  \ being undetected, invisible, or concealed.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  > \n      </div> \n      <h2>Downtime</h2> \n      <p>Even heroes sometimes need\
  \ a break from the incredible stress of an adventuring life! During downtime, you\
  \ can earn money, craft items, swap out old character choices for different options,\
  \ or just take a rest and carouse with the locals. You take your downtime when you\
  \ return to the safety of a town or home base, usually after completing an adventure.\
  \ While downtime in general flows quickly through days or weeks at a time, depending\
  \ on the choices you make, new options might open themselves up to you as the GM\
  \ sprinkles special downtime events into your chosen downtime activity, zooming\
  \ in temporarily to highlight interesting or unusual occurrences when you're not\
  \ out on an adventure.</p> \n      <p>Downtime gets the least amount of space of\
  \ the three game modes, but it's an incredibly rich design space built into the\
  \ core of the game that may lead to new innovations over the lifespan of Second\
  \ Edition (some of which we're already working on). As in Exploration Mode, players\
  \ can utilize some of their skills for downtime activities.</p> \n      <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> \n       <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-skilldowntime.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Text inset: SKILL DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES.\r\nChapter 4: Skills includes several\
  \ downtime activities, which are summarized here.\r\nCraft: Using the Crafting skill,\
  \ you can create items from raw materials (page 244).\r\nCreate Forgery: You forge\
  \ a document (page 251).\r\nEarn Income: You earn money, typically using Crafting,\
  \ Lore, or Performance (page 236).\r\nSubsist: You find food and shelter in the\
  \ wilderness or within a settlement (page 240).\r\nTreat Disease: You spend time\
  \ caring for a diseased creature in the hope of curing that creature (page 248).\"\
  > \n      </div> \n      <h2>Treasure</h2> \n      <p>While many adventurers risk\
  \ their lives due to heroism or a sense of duty, treasure is a major motivator for\
  \ others. And let's be honest, even when playing an altruistic PC, it's still a\
  \ lot of fun to find a cool magic item for your character. In Pathfinder, your characters\
  \ will find a fairly steady stream of magic items, ranging from simple <em>healing\
  \ potions</em> to the mighty <em>skyhammer</em>. Some of the more inexpensive items\
  \ are consumable, meaning they can be used once, like alchemical elixirs you drink,\
  \ scrolls you read, and special talismans you can attach to your other items. Others,\
  \ like magic weapons or enchanted clothing and tools, serve you again and again\
  \ as you adventure. You could wield a <em>storm flash</em> rapier arcing with electricity\
  \ and wear a <em>dread blindfold</em> to strike fear into your foes! You can also\
  \ find magic runes you can etch onto weapons and armor to build all kinds of powerful\
  \ combinations!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n       <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190708-stormflash.jpg\"\
  \ width=\"300\" alt=\"Text inset: Storm Flash. Item 14+. Electricity. Evocation.\
  \ Magical. \r\nUsage: held in 1 hand; bulk 1.\r\nDescription: This +2 greater striking\
  \ shock rapier has a golden blade, and miniature electric arcs flash across its\
  \ guard while it’s wielded. When out of its sheath under an open sky, the blade\
  \ causes storm clouds to gather slowly above.\r\nActivate  command, envision;\r\n\
  Frequency: once per day;\r\nEffect: You cast a 60th level lightning bolt (DC 33).\r\
  \nActivate reaction command; Frequency: once per 10 minutes; Trigger: An electricity\
  \ effect targets you or a creature within 10 feet of you, or has you or a creature\
  \ within 10 feet of you in its area; Effect: You try to divert the electricity off\
  \ course, to be absorbed by storm flash. Choose one eligible creature to protect\
  \ and roll a melee attack roll against the DC of the electricity effect. If you\
  \ succeed, the chosen creature takes no electricity damage from the triggering effect.\r\
  \nType: storm flash; Level 14; Price 4000 gp.\r\nType: greater storm flash; Level\
  \ 18. Price: 21,000gp.\r\nThis is a +3 greater striking shock rapier. When activating\
  \ the sword to cast lightning bolt, the spell is 8th level.\"> \n       <img src=\"\

  \ Mental.\r\nPrice: 15,000 gp.\r\nUsage: worn eyepiece.\r\nBulk: none.\r\nWhen tied\
  \ over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to\
  \ Intimidation checks and darkvision. You can see through the blindfold, but only\
  \ using darkvision. \r\nThe first time a particular creatures sees you in a day,\
  \ it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be frightened 1. This is an emotion, fear,\
  \ and mental effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.\r\n\
  \r\nActivate command; Frequency: once per minute; \r\nTrigger: You damage a creature\
  \ with a Strike; Effect: Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect\
  \ of a DC 37 phantasmal killer spell, but it is an enchantment instead of an illusion.\
  \ The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.\" width=\"300\">\n     \

  \ Points and Levels</h2> \n      <p>In Pathfinder, you learn from your adventures,\
  \ both your triumphs and your failures, growing more powerful and gaining fantastic\
  \ new abilities. We measure that progress with Experience Points (XP), and typically\
  \ the more impressive and insurmountable the challenge for your character, the more\
  \ XP you gain for overcoming it. Once you earn a total of 1,000 XP, you reach a\
