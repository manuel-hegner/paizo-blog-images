  description\">Paizo is pleased to report that in just a few short weeks, we're expecting\
  \ to begin the playtest for next year's Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (known to\
  \ some of you by the code name \"Project Swallowtail\"). Because playtesting a card\
  \ game isn't quite as simple as letting everybody download a PDF, it's not going\
  \ to be quite as open as our RPG playtests have been, but if you'd like to get involved,\
  \ read on to find out how that might be possible!</span></p> \n     <p><b>First,\
  \ let me tell you a bit about the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.</b></p> \n   \
  \  <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players\
  \ designed by Mike Selinker and his team at Lone Shark Games, which Paizo intends\
  \ to release at Gen Con 2013 (if not PaizoCon 2013).</p> \n     <p>Each player has\
  \ a unique character comprised of a deck of cards and a set of stats. Roleplayers\
  \ will find the stats very familiar—characters have classes such as fighter, wizard,\
  \ and rogue; they have numbers that define their Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence,\
  \ etc.; they have skills and proficiencies.</p> \n     <p>As your player adventures,\
  \ you'll improve your deck by acquiring new items, allies, spells, and weapons as\
  \ you explore and overcome challenges; over time, you'll be customizing your deck\
  \ to suit your own individual vision of your character.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1002_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game product\
  \ offerings will begin with the Rise of the Runelords Base Set, a big box containing\
  \ more than 400 cards including the \"Burnt Offerings\" Adventure Deck. Your party\
  \ will explore locations such as the Sandpoint Cathedral, the Rusty Dragon, and\
  \ the Glassworks; you'll meet helpful NPCs like Ameiko Kaijitsu or friendly Aldern\
  \ Foxglove; you'll visit the Swallowtail Festival, delve into the Catacombs of Wrath,\
  \ and invade Thistletop. You'll fight goblins, sinspawn, Warchief Ripnugget, and\
  \ maybe even face the Sandpoint devil, and eventually, become the heroes of Sandpoint!\
  \ The Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card add-on deck will expand the number\
  \ of players to 5 or 6, as well as adding more character options for any number\
  \ of players.</p> \n     <p>We'll follow the Base Set with bimonthly 110-card Adventure\
  \ Decks presenting the subsequent five chapters of Rise of the Runelords and, if\
  \ all goes well, we'll adapt other Adventure Paths after that!</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Game plays in an hour to an hour-and-a-half; it's easy to\
  \ learn, yet offers a lot of variety in play. Mike Selinker and his team did a stunning\
  \ job capturing the feel of the Pathfinder Roleplaying game, the Pathfinder campaign\
  \ setting, and the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path in a fun card game.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But to make this game is as fun and exciting as possible we're going\
  \ to need playtesters—lots of playtesters. If you're interested in being one of\
  \ them, <a href=\"/forums/dmtz6nal\">find out how on our messageboards</a>!</p>\
