  \ so far, thank you so much for your help! We’ve already learned a lot about these\
  \ four classes that we’ll be able to use going forward. If you haven’t yet, there’\
  s still a bit more time to get in a game or two, and you can download it <a href=\"\
  https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PZO2105+Character+Playtest.pdf\"\
  >here</a>. Either way, before the playtest period ends, be absolutely sure to head\
  \ to https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGClassSurvey to take the main survey, as well\
  \ as https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGOpenResponse optionally if you have more\
  \ detailed written feedback you’d prefer to submit to us directly.</p> \n     <p>We’\
  re extremely excited about the future of these four classes and the rest of the\
  \ Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide. We think these classes are going to be great,\
  \ but we couldn’t do that your help. Thank you for all of the time you’ve put into\
  \ creating characters, playing them, analyzing them, and giving us your feedback.\
  \ We’re extremely grateful to have such a passionate and committed community, and\
  \ we look forward to seeing the rest of your results. Logan and I will be on Pathfinder\
  \ Friday to discuss the playtest postmortem with you on Friday December 6th at 4PM\
  \ Pacific, so be sure to tune in and join us. Until then, thanks, and good gaming!</p>\
