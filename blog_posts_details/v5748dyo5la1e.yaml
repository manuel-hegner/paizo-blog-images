  artist: "magic, a mass of spears. He howled in his pain and madness as javelins\
    \ like the one we had seen earlier appeared in every part of his body until it\
    \ was almost impossible to distinguish the man beneath. He fell with a crash.\
    \ Seeing the creatures were at least mortal, I decided we should take advantage\
    \ of Bac Puri's mad attack and, waving my sword, I leapt through the entrance,\
    \ shouting: \"Come—they can be slain!\" They could be slain, but they were elusive\
    \ creatures and sight and feel of them brought physical revulsion. With the others\
    \ behind me, I carried the attack to them and soon found myself in a tangle of\
    \ soft, yielding flesh that seemed boneless. And the faces! They were vile parodies\
    \ of human faces and again resembled nothing quite so much as the ugly little\
    \ vampire bat of Earth. Flat faces with huge nostrils let into the head, gashes\
    \ of mouths full of sharp little fangs, half-blind eyes, dark and wicked—and insensate.\
    \ As I fought their claws, their sharp teeth and their spears, they slithered\
    \ about, gibbering and twittering. I had been wrong about them. There was not\
    \ a trace of intelligence in their faces—just a demoniac blood-hunger, a dark\
    \ malevolence that hated, hated, hated—but never reasoned. My companions and I\
    \ stood shoulder to shoulder, back to back, as the things tore at us… James Sutter\
