  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>Sixteen point five two\
  \ eight… move the seven</em>… Taihei tried to hold the quantities in his head, but\
  \ they jittered and danced. No matter, he could manage. He dipped a brush into his\
  \ inkstone and found a patch on the back of his right wrist where a cluster of silver\
  \ dots raised in precise intervals against his golden skin, counted off ten dots,\
  \ drew lines on either side, and covered seven dots with ink. <em>Leaving three.\
  \ Now… what was the trajectory coefficient again…</em> he felt for a second like\
  \ the answer was close, before the chirping of bell crickets pierced the tearoom-turned-study.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The remainders and decimals and factors scattered immediately.\
  \ Taihei groaned, crumpled his sheet of paper, and threw it to join its fellows\
  \ in the corner. As a distant chime rang, he retrieved a heavily notched metal rod\
  \ from his writing case and made a small cut in it to mark the time before going\
  \ to wash off in a basin by the door. <em>Another hour, another year.</em></p> \n\
  \     <p>The entrance examination for the College of Celestial Study would come\
  \ in a few months with the snows, and Taihei couldn’t come back empty-handed <em>again</em>—\
  he’d failed six times already, and this was getting embarrassing. <em>You wouldn’\
  t even use half these formulas in the field, we have counting boards and number\
  \ familiars for that.</em> Taihei just wanted to peer within a star, to chart the\
  \ comets as they flowed through the sky, but he’d be earthbound forever if he couldn’\
  t get into the program first. </p> \n     <p>Taihei allowed himself a moment to\
  \ find his favorite constellations before getting back to study, but he couldn’\
  t see a thing through the neighbor’s persimmon trees, which seemed to almost be\
  \ mocking him—they’d shot up sometime when he wasn’t looking, sealing off the courtyard\
  \ in a riot of red leaves and orange fruit. It made for a picturesque sight at least:\
  \ persimmons, courtyard, and harvest moon, even a small fox in frame near the koi\
  \ pond. “Must be nice, to just be a fox. You don’t have to worry about trajectories\
  \ or tests, do you?” </p> \n     <p>“I’ll have you know I have two degrees from\
  \ the College myself, so I find I rarely have to worry anymore” the fox stated matter-of-factly.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>He bowed to Taihei before striding forward on four legs, though\
  \ only two remained by the time he reached the door as his form blurred and shifted\
  \ to that of a wavy-haired elf man in a professor's robes and pleated trousers.\
  \ “And once I’m done with you, you won’t have to either.”</p> \n     <p>“Taihei,\
  \ remember to clean up before your new tutor arrives!” Taihei’s mother called from\
  \ the house, unfortunately a hair too late to save him the embarrassment. Sheepishly,\
  \ the student slid open the door and placed a cushion on the floor, but the man\
  \ strode right past him, taking a seat on the edge of the table instead</p> \n \
  \    <p>“So, out with it, why can’t you seem to pass the exam? Shouldn’t you be\
  \ able to just…” the professor appraised Taihei, noting a golden mote flickering\
  \ off his arm,” I don’t know, <em>aphorite</em> this?”</p> \n     <p>Taihei seethed\
  \ at the assumption that being born under the sign of Axis somehow granted immediate\
  \ knowledge of trigonometry and calculus, though he remembered his manners and prevented\
  \ the emotion from reaching his face. “I’m afraid that numbers are my weakest subject.\
  \ I’m not sure how to understand what they all mean in the real world.”</p> \n \
  \    <p>“In that case,” the fox in elf shape coughed into a fist, and when he withdrew\
  \ his hand, a curious crystal ball sat in it, glowing soft and blue, “we should\
  \ simply hammer all possible test questions into you so thoroughly that you’ll pass\
  \ the test even if you don’t understand.” He tapped the orb, which floated across\
  \ the room to hover in front of Taihei. “Write down your answers to the following\
  \ questions. Beginning immediately.” Before Taihei could voice his confusion at\
  \ this novel teaching strategy, the orb began reciting:</p> <b>\n      <ul> \n \
  \      <li>“List the seventeen most common alchemical components of an extraplanar\
  \ being in reverse alphabetical order of closest-affinity celestial body, beginning\
  \ from Aucturn”</li> \n       <li>“Compute trajectory of this model of a transiting\
  \ comet with a fey toroid structure and…”</li> \n       <li>“What is the average\
  \ density of a sixth-order star, assuming Positive Energy gateways have mass according\
  \ to Gyoen’s Third Theorem of…”</li> \n      </ul></b> \n     <p>Taihei was overwhelmed\
  \ swiftly and ruthlessly. He began trying his best to answer the questions, but\
  \ no sooner had he begun writing than his teacher cleared his throat. “Keep in mind\
  \ that the exam is 258 questions, so you’ll need to average one question every 90\
  \ seconds.” </p> \n     <p>“Y-yes... of course, Professor.” Taihei desperately tried\
  \ to rejoin his train of thought. The orb carried on:</p> <b>\n      <ul> \n   \
  \    <li>“Solve for X to yield the minimum possible amount of teleportation inaccuracy\
  \ given a conjurer using …”</li> \n       <li>“If ten human ganzi assistants and\
  \ one brilliant kitsune professor are each holding a planar tuning fork, then…”\
  </li> \n      </ul></b> \n     <p><em>Wait, wha—</em></p> \n     <p>“You know,”\
  \ the professor interrupted again, “What if you just found a way to visualize the\
  \ problems? Or like a feeling or something. Why, I used to be terrible at changing\
  \ forms, but look at me now!” The professor waggled his long elven ears as they\
  \ shifted back into those of a fox. “I just think of a sensation I connect with\
  \ being a kitsune, like the feeling of grass under paw, and it comes to me.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“That…” Taihei struggled to find a polite way to tell his teacher to\
  \ please shut up, missing a question about two ships leaving Sakakabe (one at noon,\
  \ the other at midnight) in the process, “That’s very helpful.”</p> <b>\n      <ul>\
  \ \n       <li>“The aforementioned brilliant kitsune professor is planning a three-day\
  \ planar expedition. How much fried tofu should his students gift him to ensure\
  \ his rations are…”</li> \n      </ul></b> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \">Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</a>.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>“Oh, this\
  \ one’s very important!” the professor noted most unhelpfully, and Taihei looked\
  \ up to see he had fully resumed fox form and was now pacing across the desk, stepping\
  \ in Taihei’s inkstone each time.</p> \n     <p>“Professor, you’re tracking paw\
  \ prints on my practice tests,” Taihei pleaded, on his very last nerve.</p> <b>\n\
  \      <ul> \n       <li>“Solve for X, where X is the number of years an aphorite\
  \ who can’t perform basic calculations without scribbling on his arms will attempt\
  \ the entrance exam before…”</li> \n      </ul></b> \n     <p>“Okay, that does it!”\
  \ Taihei snatched the orb from the air and ran to the door. Looking out into the\
  \ courtyard, he spied a nest under the eave of the neighbors’ estate, recently abandoned\
  \ by migrating swallows. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than to throw the\
  \ orb into the nest, but those blasted trees were in the way and he didn’t have\
  \ a clear shot. </p> \n     <p>No matter. He could manage.</p> \n     <p>Taihei’\
  s eyes darted around the courtyard, taking in angles and forces. He felt his mind…\
  \ not expand, exactly—the opposite. Connect. Point to point. Intention joined result.\
  \ He flung the orb, feeling its complete trajectory even before it had left his\
  \ hand. It skipped twice off the surface of the pond. It spun as it struck the tiles\
  \ of the courtyard wall and flew high into the sky. And it danced in the autumn\
  \ night as a breeze adjusted its path ever so slightly to the left, before it fell\
  \ perfectly between the branches of the trees to land in the abandoned nest. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>No sooner had it touched down than something strange happened. The trees\
  \ that Taihei had tried so hard to avoid shimmered in the night air, dissolving\
  \ into ghostly blue flames, and when Taihei had finished rubbing his eyes, they\
  \ were gone and the sky was visible once more. Rather than the blue sphere, a roasted\
  \ chestnut sat perfectly in the swallows’ nest. </p> \n     <p><em>Huh</em>. “The\
  \ coefficient was zero point nine two,” Taihei said to himself, perfectly recalling\
  \ the problem he had been working on earlier, every page in his textbook, and where\
  \ he had forgotten one of his sandals that morning. The strange clarity left him\
  \ as subtly as it arrived, but in its wake, he felt like he understood just a little\
  \ bit more of the test than he had in years.</p> \n     <p>“Oh, very nice! It looks\
  \ like you’re one of those students that learns better by doing. That’ll make the\
  \ rest of this so much more fun.” </p> \n     <p>Taihei looked back at the desk\
  \ to once more see an elf, eating from a bag of chestnuts. The professor flicked\
  \ a wrist and the glowing orb reappeared in his hand, and as he absentmindedly tossed\
  \ it into the air, nothing came back down. As he strode to the door and waved one\
  \ of his tails from beneath his robes, illusory equations and vectors sprung into\
  \ glowing existence around the courtyard, illuminating each phase of Taihei’s throw\
  \ in precise and clear mathematical detail.</p> \n     <p>“I think,” Taihei said\
  \ slowly, “you’re probably the worst teacher I’ve had.”</p> \n     <p>“You know,\
  \ for some reason, I get that a lot,” the fox said in mock offense. He tossed a\
  \ chestnut to Taihei before popping seven more in his mouth. “Now, do that again,\
  \ and this time, let's go through the calculations, step by step.”</p> \n    </blockquote>\
