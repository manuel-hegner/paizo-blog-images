  >Curse of the Crimson Throne<em></em></a><em>. I'll comment along as needed.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Almost a decade ago, I ran the <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\"\
  >RPG version of Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> for a group of players that included\
  \ my friends Chad Brown and Tanis O'Connor. It's a fantastic adventure that starts\
  \ you as a group of characters all wronged by a deranged dealer of drugs and kidnapper\
  \ of kids, drawn together by a mysterious gypsy fortune teller to bring him to justice.\
  \ From there, you become embroiled in saving the city of Korvosa—often from itself.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It has everything that makes for a great urban adventure full of morally\
  \ ambiguous allies and enemies. You parkour over, under, and through the city to\
  \ defeat criminal and political plots, a healthy mix of mundane greed and murder\
  \ alongside mystical rituals of mass murder. As you investigate, you interact with\
  \ such a fantastic cast of characters that you feel like the city becomes yours\
  \ to protect, not just a backdrop for the dungeon of the day. When you finally end\
  \ it by stabbing your magic sword into the heart of a centuries-old curse that's\
  \ plagued the Crimson Throne, you feel a genuine sense of accomplishment at having\
  \ changed the city's fate. It's the only adventure path I've GM'd multiple times,\
  \ the anniversary hardcover is excellent, and I'd cheerfully encourage you to play\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p>Back to the card game: about five years later, when I was looking\
  \ for a new game project, Chad and Tanis lured me onto the PACG team. (<em>After\
  \ I'd introduced Keith to everyone, I casually mentioned to Mike that he'd GM'd\
  \ Curse... three times.</em>—Chad) Once I'd proven I could be helpful, one of my\
  \ first big projects was to help architect the Curse of the Crimson Throne set.\
  \ I still have spreadsheets from 2014 with some of the initial ideas. I'll admit\
  \ that 5 years more experience designing, the help of the full team, and being able\
  \ to leverage Core were tremendous improvements over those nascent ideas. Still,\
  \ it is with great happiness and pride that I look forward to seeing this box, with\
  \ our names on the front, make it into your hands. (<em>What he said!</em>—Chad)</p>\

  \ with friends. We don't judge.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>One of the defining features\
  \ of the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path is how it centers around Korvosa.\
  \ Throughout several adventures, you work to save the city from crime, madness,\
  \ plague, traitors, and ancient dark forces. At the same time, the city is there\
  \ for you when you need a helping hand, perhaps to procure new equipment, gather\
  \ information, or heal whatever injury, disease, or even death that has befallen\
  \ you. (<em>Even more helpful than going through your pockets looking for loose\
  \ change.</em>—Chad)</p> \n     <p>The very first scenario rewards you with your\
  \ first supporter, Field Marshall Cressida Kroft (<em>She's the best!</em>—Chad),\
  \ commander of Korvosa's guards. Impressed by your heroism, and sorely in need of\
  \ help, she'll happily provide you all manner of armor and weapons. If you want\
  \ her help obtaining spells, you'll need to check off that box on the card by spending\
  \ a supporter feat on her. You'll receive a steady supply of supporter feats throughout\
  \ your adventures, so the city of Korvosa levels up alongside you. Just like in\
  \ the RPG, supporters in the ACG can change in and out, gain power, and even die.\
  \ Each group will favor different supporters, and you may eventually need to make\
  \ tough decisions about which supporters to obtain or save from calamity.</p> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Curse of the Crimson Throne also introduces you to Korvosa's\
  \ Hero, Blackjack (<em>Also the best!</em>—Chad). Blackjack is a masked hero who\
  \ has fought for Korvosa's poor for centuries. Fortunately for you, the current\
  \ Blackjack is ready to give up his mantle to a worthy successor. Someone heroic.\
  \ Someone adventurous. Someone who also fights to save the people of Korvosa. (<em>Sound\
  \ like anyone you know?</em>—Chad)</p> \n     <p>This special role can be earned\
  \ by any one character, adds to your existing character powers instead of replacing\
  \ them like a normal role, and comes with several wonderful toys.</p> \n     <div\

  \ Also, apparently a Hag with an eyeball in her mouth. Ick.</p>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Curse of the Crimson Throne makes extensive use of the Harrow, a Tarot-like\
  \ deck of cards used to predict the future and play card games. Folks familiar with\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy97ei?Pathfinder-Cards-Deluxe-Harrow-Deck\"><em>Harrow\
  \ Deck</em></a> that Mike helped design several years back will not be surprised\
  \ that a very similar deck has ended up in Curse, in the form of special Harrow\
  \ blessings. There are 6 suits (Hammers, Keys, Shields, Books, Stars, and Crowns)\
  \ representing different metaphysical concepts and also mapping to six familiar\
  \ attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma).\
  \ Each of those suits has 9 cards that correspond to the classic 9 alignments that\
  \ describe the struggle between Good and Evil, Law and Chaos. Mechanically, this\
  \ means that some Harrows are a lot kinder than others and they cover a wide variety\
  \ of effects, both when played and when they show up as the hour (that is, are faceup\
  \ on the hourglass discard pile). Also, following our design principle of more unique\
  \ cards=good, you get 54 unique Harrow blessings in Curse of the Crimson Throne.\
  \ More than enough to keep things interesting!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Every harrowing adventure has a Harrowing to start, so get to heroing.</p>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Each adventure in Curse is themed to a particular Harrow\
  \ suit. For instance, the first adventure is themed to the suit of Keys, and it\
  \ cares a lot about chases, criminals, finding lost treasures, and other dexterous\
  \ undertakings, so you get an automatic 1d4 on Dexterity non-combat checks. At the\
  \ start of the adventure, each character will draw an appropriate Harrow and get\
  \ to use it throughout the entire adventure, getting a special benefit each time\
  \ they play it. And if you're seeking a little bit of extra challenge or just more\
  \ Harrowing flavor, each suit has a wildcard you can add that evokes the right kind\
  \ of flavor and actions.</p> \n     <p>My forum avatar has been the <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/HarrowRabbitPrince_500.jpeg\"\
  >Harrow Rabbit Prince</a> for years because of fond memories of Tanis's barbarian\
  \ calling Chad's paladin \"Bunnyman\" for an entire campaign after he got it. (<em>Yeah,\
  \ she totally stopped after the campaign.</em>—Chad) We even put out a promo card\
  \ in Chad's honor.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-TheRealRabbitPrince.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Tanis would approve.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>I'm in no way suggesting\
  \ that you should use the Harrows as an excuse for silly nicknames, but I can confirm\
  \ that it's hilarious.</p> \n     <p>Keith Richmond<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Designer</i></p>\
