  \ Game Design</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 11, 2017</p> \n   <p\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">I'm big on game design rules. For example, you can see\
  \ me talk about ten (or so) of them in my PAX Dev video lecture <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshUdUEtIw8\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Ten Rules About Writing Rules</a>. In this blog, I want to talk\
  \ about one rule of mine that gets quoted a lot, and its effect on game design in\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A couple years ago in <a href=\"/threads/rzs2rjtu?Adventure-Deck-locations-and-box-management#4\"\
  >a Paizo forum post</a>, I described a rule we use at Lone Shark called \"the Afghanistan\
  \ Principle.\" Its technical definition is:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><i><b>No\
  \ interconnectivity without availability:</b> For an expandable game, a component\
  \ from an expansion cannot be required for use in any product other than the one\
  \ it is in.</i></p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>The genesis of this principle came\
  \ at Wizards of the Coast as I was helping prepare a shipment of games to members\
  \ of the military stationed in the Persian Gulf. Instead of just throwing everything\
  \ into the box, we sorted and bundled up several items at a time, labeling each\
  \ set as a single <i>playable</i> unit. For example, one Magic: The Gathering deck\
  \ is not very useful. Two Magic decks can be months of entertainment.</p> \n   <p>Now,\
  \ I don't know what happened after that. Some bureaucrat may have popped the labels\
  \ and made that work for naught. But I like to think that many of our soldiers wiled\
  \ away the desert nights with a D&amp;D 3rd Edition <em>Player's Handbook</em>,\
  \ a <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, <i>and</i> a <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p> \n\
  \   <p>After that, I started thinking about how to enforce that principle on the\
  \ games I worked on. I imagined a soldier with a copy of an RPG adventure that said,\
  \ \"For details on this important thing, see this other adventure,\" except that\
  \ other adventure was three countries away. That was no good. In my head, everything\
  \ needed for that adventure should be either in that adventure or in the basic game\
  \ materials required for play. It's not that I succeeded in getting this principle\
  \ enforced everywhere, or even that it worked everywhere, but I did make people\
  \ aware of its desirability.</p> \n   <p>A couple years later, the United States\
  \ invaded Afghanistan, and the principle got a name. A couple years after that,\
  \ I co-founded Lone Shark, and now I bring this principle into every project I help\
  \ create.</p> \n   <p>You can see it in action in the Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game. Each Adventure Path has a Base Set, and the components of that box (including\
  \ its Adventure Deck 1) are the <i>only</i> components that can be required to play\
  \ any of the other adventures in that path. Here are some of the decisions that\
  \ the principle mandates:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Any card needed in multiple adventures\
  \ must be in the Base Set box. For example, the Mummy's Mask support card Defensive\
  \ Stance is used in adventures 4 and 6, so even though it isn't used in adventures\
  \ B or 1, it's a B card.</li> \n    <li>The corollary to the above is that a card\
  \ introduced in Adventure Deck 2 or beyond can only be used in the deck it came\
  \ in. So the Adventure Deck 1 cohorts Irabeth Tirabade and Horgus Gwerm can appear\
  \ again and again, but the Adventure Deck 2 cohort Queen Galfrey won't turn up in\
  \ later adventures. (A practical implication of this is that when you add Adventure\
  \ Deck 3 to your box, you can safely remove the Adventure Deck 2 adventure, scenarios,\
  \ locations, villains, henchmen, and cohorts from the box if you like. You may find\
  \ this speeds setup a bit since you only need to look through the ones from B, 1,\
  \ and the current deck.)</li> \n    <li>The role card for a character needs to be\
  \ in the same product as the character card. So even though roles aren't used until\
  \ the end of Adventure 3, when a character appears in the Base Set, his role card\
  \ is in the Base Set as well.</li> \n    <li>The mythic paths and mythic tokens\
  \ you need in Wrath of the Righteous Adventure 2 and beyond are in the Wrath Base\
  \ Set. (Though the new mythic paths introduced in Adventure 5 can be used in Adventure\
  \ 6, that adventure works just fine without them, so they don't need to be in the\
  \ Base Set.)</li> \n    <li>The rules for cohorts weren't introduced until Wrath,\
  \ meaning they're not in the Rise of the Runelords or Skull &amp; Shackles rulebooks.\
  \ Since the Witch and Summoner class decks use cohorts, and can be used with RotR\
  \ and S&amp;S, the rules card in those decks tells you to download a free PDF of\
  \ the latest rulebook. The basic cohort rules will therefore now be included in\
  \ every new rulebook, even when there are no cohorts in that rulebook's Adventure\
  \ Path (as is the case in Mummy's Mask).</li> \n    <li>Troops appear in adventures\
  \ 2 and 6 of Wrath. Since troops are meant to be a surprise in Adventure 2, the\
  \ new rules for troops that appear on the back of the troop card in Adventure 2\
  \ had to be repeated on the back of the troop card in Adventure 6.</li> \n    <li>Since\
  \ we don't provide a d20 with any set other than Wrath, only cards from that set\
  \ can use a d20.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>I'm sure you can imagine more. The rule\
  \ can be restrictive sometimes. We've often talked about making a Swashbuckler Class\
  \ Deck, but we can't put new ships in that deck without enforcing the ship rules\
  \ from Skull &amp; Shackles, and those rules don't work in Mummy's Mask. We would\
  \ probably not write a power like \"You gain the Craft skill equal to your Intelligence\
  \ skill when on a ship,\" because that power would be useless in Wrath. (For flavor\
  \ reasons, we gave the Skull &amp; Shackles promo character Ranzak one power that\
  \ works only in that set, and only on one of his roles.) Without those things, the\
  \ hypothetical Swashbuckler deck loses some of its flavor. Until we figure out how\
  \ to replace that flavor, you probably won't see Jirelle outside of Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles.</p> \n   <p>All this said, there is one place where we violate the principle.\
  \ In <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> play, we break\
  \ this rule because fairness demands that every one of the thousands of PFSACG games\
  \ is played with the same box of cards (with the mechanically negligible exception\
  \ that the associated Character Add-On Deck is optional for parties smaller than\
  \ 5). For example, <a href=\"/products/btpy9non\"><em>Season of the Runelords Adventure\
  \ 4</em></a> requires the <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"><em>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Base Set</em></a> and Adventure Decks 1 through 4 to play, so it can use locations\
  \ from Adventure Deck 3. (Plus, this mix creates a better experience for veteran\
  \ players, since they're seeing combos of cards that they won't see in the box sets.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The Afghanistan Principle doesn't work for every game, but it works for\
  \ ours. It's got a good reason to exist, and a committed team behind it. Thanks\
  \ for reading about it, and for supporting our troops.</p> \n   <p>If you have any\
  \ stories about how the Afghanistan Principle has affected you—even if it has nothing\
  \ to do with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—let us know about it in the discussion\
  \ thread for this blog!</p> \n   <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Lead\
