               <p itemprop="description">As the Halloween weekend approaches, and fancy dress parties loom on the very near horizon, I find myself getting a bit thirsty for the cavalcade of beer and alcohol that's just around the corner. That brings me, naturally, to <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, the next set of prepainted plastic <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> gaming figures!

               <p>No more. By my count I have six figures plus an updated and much-improved case incentive to preview, and all but ONE of those figures fits hand-in-glove with the tavern theme. The outlier figure will have to wait for next week, but I suggest all minis fans start chilling their pint glasses immediately. There's some heavy drinking up ahead!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Bartender.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Bartender_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Every good bar needs a Bartender, of course, and the <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is no exception! This sassy, saucy lady is more than happy to pour you a foamy brew or share rumors from the local community—for the right-sized pile of coins, of course! I don't know why, but I appreciate the fact that she's got a dishrag. Adventurers can be such messy folk. The Bartender is a Medium, rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Table.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Table_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>I suppose the Bartender's dishrag might come in very handy once adventurers make a mess on this table! Randomly inserted about one-per-case in exchange for an uncommon figure, this Medium table is just one of a handful of useful bits of dungeon dressing spread out through the set (others include the previously previewed wagon, cart, and bed). I suspect a lot of folks would appreciate more tables than just the one they're likely to get in the set. As with the bed we previewed last week, I'll see what I can do about getting a promotional repaint, but there is not currently one in the works. But there may be more news on this in the next couple of weeks...</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-CaydenCailean.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-CaydenCailean_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>One of my favorite gods in the Pathfinder pantheon is Cayden Cailean, god of beer, wine, freedom, and bravery. With a sword in one hand and a frothy beer in the other, Cayden sometimes manifests in local bars to check out new brews. Here we see him in mortal form—he became a living god by drunkenly passing the Test of the Starstone. It just so happens that Cayden makes a GREAT proxy for a drunken player character, or a short-term ally of the party who gets them into trouble by always being a little too deep in his cups (or in his tankards, as the case may be). I love the expression on his face, which came through great on the paint master I saw a few weeks ago. What a wry bastard. Love him. Cayden Cailean is a Medium, rare figure.</p> 
               <p>By my count, we've got one more rare and two more pieces of dungeon dressing before we get to the grand finale!</p> 
               <p>Happy Halloween, everybody! See you at the bar!</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Many congratulations to Nick Wasko, who has won Season 9 of RPG Superstar!</p> 
               <p>The path to victory for Nick has been long and difficult. Through three months, five rounds, and more than a quarter of a million votes, he has continued to employ skill and creativity to overcome writing challenges that demanded originality, clarity, and strong game design. Along the way he forged armor powered by the <a hef="/threads/rzs2stxq">banshee's wrath</a>, dared to reveal the dangers of an <a href="/threads/rzs2swsg">ice dam</a>, unleashed the fabled horror of the <a href="/threads/rzs2sxwc">matianak</a>, and offered GMs an opportunity to run players through the trials of <a href="/threads/rzs2sz69">Dead Man's End</a>.</p> 
               <p>For the final round Nick wrote the adventure proposal <em>Beneath the Storm-Veiled Spires</em>, weaving a story of hags, thunderbirds, shipwrecks, and drowned cities, all set in the Sodden lands. The voters have spoken, and work will begin soon to turn this proposal into a full-fledged Pathfinder Module!</p> 
               <p>I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our voters and community, without whom this contest could not exist, as well as all the contestants who put in many hours of hard work and anticipation. I'd also like to thank our judges, especially Neil Spicer, who undertook the massive task of judging every round, and Adam Daigle and Crystal Frasier, who tackled the very difficult job of helping to judge the final round. Finally, I hope everyone will join me in thanking Chris Lambertz, who provides crucial logistics and technical support for the RPG Superstar competition in addition to her extensive and crucial responsibilities at Paizo.</p> 
               <p>I hope everyone has enjoyed the competition, and I look forward to starting the whole process over again... next year!</p>

               <p>The Wyrmwraith crushed the Fey by one of the wider margins in the contest. Sharp-eyed fans may have noticed a glowing green dragon on the cover of the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>, but now it has stats (and if it has a statblock, you can kill it...right? Guys, where did you go?)</p> 
               <p><strong>Adam Daigle (Developer)</strong>: "Dwarfed by the wyrmwraith, the thought eater is going to have to be clever to win this battle of the strange skeletons!"</p> 
               <p><strong>Mark Seifter (Designer)</strong>: "A lot of people have been saying that the wyrmwraith's phenomenally greater power level will cinch this fight, and it does have the ACG cover on its side, but fundamentally, this is a creature that detests its own existence, whereas the thought eater, while humble, has a go-getter attitude and isn't afraid to team up with adventurers."</p>

               <p>The Twilight Pitri Manasaputra is not the only manasaputra in <a href="/products/btpy9g9x"><em>Bestiary 5</em></a>, and many of her abilities tie heavily into elements from <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>—but to see which ones, she'll have to make it to future rounds!</p> 
               <p><strong>Ashley Kaprielian (Accountant)</strong>: "Let's hope that the Twilight Pitri can slap some enlightenment into this Deep Merfolk before she's unmade. The Deep Merfolk is cool, calm, and elusive under pressure though, so this will be an epic battle between these paragons of light and darkness!"</p> 
               <p><strong>Mark</strong>: "Let's face it, I have to give the twilight pitri credit for surviving the destruction of the previous Multiverse, and it could deep freeze the deep merfolk in an instant, but the deep merfolk is a mortal humanoid, so I think she's got this by just exploiting the pitri's aversion to meddling in mortal affairs. The pitri would have done better against the wyrmwraith or pakalchi."</p>

I'm confident she'll strike fear into her opponent and pull off a win."</p> 
               <p><strong>Ashley</strong>: "It's a good thing the Pakalchi Sahkil can fight blind, because those whelps have a face only their mother could love.

               <p><strong>Mark</strong>: "This one's a slam dunk: The su brings its whole family to bear, using its young as psychic batteries for its magic, but the pakalchi specializes in breaking the bonds between loved ones, so this is the perfect match-up for her."</p>

               <p>We've reached the mid-way point of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a> with the release of <a href="/products/btpy9grk"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #99: Dance of the Damned</em></a>. How's your group dealing with the tenacity of resident tyrant, Barzillai Thrune? I hope they're ready, because they've got a lot of work to do to get ready for <a href="/products/btpy9grm"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #100: A Song of Silver</em></a>. The next volume of the Hell's Rebels is a mega-sized volume, filled with articles that all fans of the Pathfinder Adventure Path line will want to have in their collection. We'll have more previews available as we get closer to AP #100's release in December.</p> 
               <p>Ever wondered what lies beyond the border Golarion's Inner Sea region? <a href="/products/btpy9gro"><em>Distant Shores</em></a> takes you there! Or may you're a character that prefers to lay low or the company of the unseen world? This month we had a double Pathfinder Player Companion release with <a href="/products/btpy9h7x"><em>Black Markets</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9grw"><em>Occult Origins</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>The current <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> Adventure Path, <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> cames to a close with the release of the epic conclusion: <a href=""><em>Adventure Deck 6: City of Locusts</em></a>. Fans of the Adventure Card Game will be excited to know we've also announced plans for the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li5d">Season of the Runelords</a>, which begins in early 2016.</p> 
               <p>Do you need monsters and frights? This month we rummaged up some ideas for you to add in some creepy elements to your games in a series on the Paizo blog (<a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li4e">Part 1</a>, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li5f">Part 2</a>, and <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li6a">Part 3</a>. We also launched a brand new feature in the <a href="/prd">Pathfinder Reference Document</a> to sort Bestiary entries so you can <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li4k">find just the <i>perfect</i> set of teeth to drop into your campaign</a>, and rounded <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li2m">all the free resources</a> you can find on paizo.com to enhance your game or plan your next character.</p>

                <p><b>8. <a href="/products/btpy8mw2">Pathfinder Module: Feast of Ravenmoor</a></b>: If you want less dead and more lively threats, <em>Feast of Ravenmoor</em> is a 3rd-level adventure that pits your innocent travellers against an all-too-human cult in a sleepy little hamlet.

From astrology to numerology to the secret societies and veiled masters who control the destiny of humankind, Occult Mysteries offers guidance in adding just enough of the weird to your game to keep your players uncomfortable.</p> 
                <p><b>5. <a href="/products/btpy8j5u">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</a></b>: Horror requires a certain sense of helplessness and hopelessness, and nowhere in Golarion do these elements flourish quite so well as Ustalav.

It provides plenty of inspiration whether you're running your own game or trying to make a pre-made adventure a little more terrifying.</p>

               <p><em>Bloodbound</em> follows Larsa, a dhampir and one of Ustalav's mysterious Royal Accusers, as she hunts an undead outlaw who threatens the nation's people—both the living and the dead.

Their journey takes them from the streets of Caliphas to the slums of Ardis, where their path intersects with famed author and former Pathfinder Society member, <a href="/threads/rzs2szj3">Ailson Kindler</a>. Together with an Osirian swordsman and a deathless dandy, they'll have to unlock a secret from Kindler's past if they're to prevent the rise of a new vampire tyrant.</p>

               <p>Lots of cool things happen in these adventures—get the pieces, do the thing.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is a nonstop thrill ride. The party goes to the Abyss and back multiple times. They fight demon lords, they meet gods, they defeat armies—how could such an Adventure Path end? By permanently changing the face of the world, of course!</p> 
               <p>Things are bad in the Worldwound. Deskari is tired of waiting and nervous about heroes interfering with his business. He's going for broke and trying to tear the Worldwound wide open. The heroes have to stop him by traveling to the heart of the tear and performing a dangerous ritual right on his doorstep. And if they have a moment afterward, maybe they'll go talk to him about what's he's done.</p> 
               <p>There are so many good parts to the <a href="/products/btpy9dyi"><em>City of Locusts Adventure Deck</em></a>. The characters are on a classic quest: They must find some mysterious artifacts and bring them to the worst place possible, defeat the most horrible villains ever encountered, then put their lives on the line to close a portal to the Abyss. This <i>defines</i> mythic.</p> 
               <p>And while I love all of the scenarios in this path, what I really want to talk about is a single moment.</p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game versions of Wrath are an interesting combination. They each take the players on the same journey and tell the same story, but they do it in very different ways. One of the most challenging (and also most fun) things I get to do as a designer for this game is taking events and situations from the RPG and trying to make them work in a card game.</p> 
               <div style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
                <b>Wrath of the Righteous Spoilers</b>: 
                <input type="button" value="Show" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
                <div class="spoiler-text"> 
                 <p>In the Adventure Path, there's a particular moment that is very striking to me. The players have just rescued a weird little demon called the Suture from the Soul Foundry. Given that the creature can help close the Worldwound, the Storm King instantly knows when he's been found. Khorramzadeh appears without warning and attacks the players to try to stop them from taking this key to the Worldwound. The players must defeat the mythic demon who destroyed Kenabres, starting them on this path. It's a time to realize how far they have come. They've changed from the people who ran for their lives into the underground while the Storm King slew a silver dragon above them to the mythic heroes who can now defeat that very same demon.</p> 
                </div>
               </div> 
               <p>This story arc exists in the card game as well. As you'll recall from my blog about Adventure Deck 1, Khorramzadeh appears in the very first scenario in that deck, but not as a bane to be fought—he would be much too tough for that. He's there to trigger calamity for the players. And now, in Adventure Deck 6, the players finally get the chance to face him and make him pay. All we had to do was properly simulate the conditions of the fight.</p> 
               <h2>Searching for the Suture</h2> 
               <p>Death of the Storm King has one very interesting feature: The Suture is a cohort that gets shuffled into a random deck as if he were a henchman. The players must find him in order to win the scenario because it's the only way to get the villain into the game.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-DeathOfTheStormKing.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-DeathOfTheStormKing_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-TheSuture.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-TheSuture_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>HERE'S JOHNNY!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>At some point, just like in the roleplaying game, the players will find the Suture and succeed at capturing him. And then, just like in the roleplaying game, the Storm King will appear, and the players will have their showdown with a power they had once believed to be undefeatable. The moment is preserved.</p> 
               <h2>The End?</h2> 
               <p>Much like in Adventure Deck 5, there's an optional fight in this deck. Actually, it's an entire optional scenario. This is a "reward" for completing City of Locusts, and it represents the players deciding to journey into the lair of Deskari in the Abyss to end his reign once and for all.</p> 
               <p>The scenario is simple. There's only one location: The Rasping Rifts. It's composed of six random high-level henchmen for each player, and the villain Deskari is on the bottom. The players just have to keep beating the toughest banes in the game turn after turn until they finally get to the big man. Then there's just the simple matter of making three consecutive combat 66 checks. Oh, and he has this text: "If undefeated, you die."</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-JustifiableDecide.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-JustifiableDecide_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-Deskari.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-Deskari_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>You could have said, "No."</i>
               </div> 
               <h2>Apocalyptic Challenges</h2> 
               <p>Adventure Deck 6 is the pinnacle of difficulty in the Pathfinder Adventure Card game, and the banes are here to prove it. The Elder Fire Demon tops the heap with an impressive 33 combat check. (Some knowledge can help you with that, though.) If he beats you, he drains your mythic charges, and even if you win, all the characters at your location might have to discard their hands.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-ElderFireDemon.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-ElderFireDemon_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>He just keeps asking, "Aren't you glad you took all of those hand size power feats?"</i>
               </div> 
               <p>A favorite of mine is the Insane Bythos. This thing is chaos incarnate. Before the players even get to act, it shuffles up all of their role cards. Alain might find himself with the ability to wrangle Padrig, but nothing to help with Donahan. And that change lasts until the monster is defeated or until the end of the scenario.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-InsaneBythos.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-InsaneBythos_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>"Where am I going to get a bow at this time of night?"</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The barriers are highly educational. For example, you can learn that "flensing" means "to remove the outer layer of skin and blubber." You can also learn that Death by Pleasure is a thing that can happen in this world. But my favorite barrier is Unstable Accelerant. It's not so much a barrier as a warping of the rules at a location. It looks like it will throw everything into chaos, and to an extent, it does. However, its real effect will be to make smart players very careful about what they play and when for fear of drawing too many cards out of other players' hands.</p>

               <h2>The Bright Side of the End!</h2> 
               <p>This deck introduces some of the most iconic boons in all of Pathfinder. Among the weapons, you'll find a Vorpal Blade that can succeed at any combat check if you can just roll a 20. You'll also see the Staff of the Hierophant, which lets you get your divine spells back almost immediately.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-VorpalBlade.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-VorpalBlade_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-StaffOfTheHierophant.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-StaffOfTheHierophant_180.jpeg"></a>

               <p>Those weapons don't really hold a candle to the spells, though. This set contains Miracle, which lets you get and play any other spell in the box. It has Meteor Swarm, which adds four dice and an automatic reroll. And, of course, it has Time Stop, which lets you get any and all cards in your deck and then play them without caring about the "one of each type" rule.</p>

               <p>I can't believe we're at the end of <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous/"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. What an amazing journey it's been! The characters have come humble beginnings, hiding from the chaos unleashed around them, to being mythic heroes fighting demon lords for FUN.</p> 
               <p>This set also introduced so many new mechanics: mythic cards, corruption and redemption, and don't forget cohorts. They all mesh and play off of each other well while helping players fight the increased difficulty of mythic opponents, temptations, and demon lords.</p> 
               <p>It seems like just yesterday that Mike was stopping me from revealing that you could play a succubus in Adventure Deck 3. Now there's nothing left for me to spoil.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">This month the <a href="/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society</a> finishes a two-part series, To Judge a Soul, which has traveled Amanandar and its neighboring regions as the PCs work with the Venture-Captain Bakten to uncover centuries-old secrets that touch upon at least half a dozen major regions in Tian Xia. One of the campaign's most prolific and acclaimed authors Larry Wilhelm concludes this storyline with <a href="/products/btpy9gww"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-08: To Judge a Soul, Part 2: Karma Reclaimed</em></a>, which travels into Zi Ha, bastion of the samsarans. The campaign rarely gives mountains the attention they deserve, and this was an excellent opportunity to revisit a rather underserved demographic: the yetis.

               <p>From a development standpoint, the Year of the Serpent storyline has proven one of the most rewarding I've worked on, but it's also involved some of the most ambitious assignments to date. I knew that as I outlined these next couple adventures that I'd need some proven authors who could assimilate our ongoing storyline and make these adventures come to life in amazing ways. The <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar</a> continues to identify up-and-coming authors, and the 2014 finalists Robert Brookes, Mike Kimmel, and Mikko Kallio especially impressed me in their handling of the <a href="/products/btpy9am4"><em>Scions of the Sky Key</em></a> series, and all three return with adventures in October and November. Robert's the first in line with this month's <a href="/products/btpy9gwx"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-09: The Blakros Connection</em></a>. As you'll no doubt guess, it involves the Blakros Museum, but it also takes the PCs to another famous site in Absalom in pursuit of one of the Aspis agents who recently attacked the Grand Lodge.</p> 
               <p>The team looks forward to hearing what you think!</p>

               <p>With that unfortunate news out of the way, let's move on to this week's previews!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-GracefulSlayer.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-GracefulSlayer_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first this week is the Graceful Slayer, an elf barbarian from page 22 of the <a href="/products/btpy8v3a"><em>Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex</em></a>. One of the last figure selections from my dear, departed licensing assistant Mike Kenway, this fearless warrior is ready to rock with an elven curve blade and a formidable bow. She should work great as a player character, or as a member of a wilderness tribe. The Graceful Slayer is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Bed.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Bed_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>It's been a while since I've had a chance to reveal any of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>'s "dungeon dressing," so I'm pleased to show off this handsome Bed. Sleep on it, tip it over and use it as cover, or... well, I'll leave other uses to your imagination, but you can't have a proper nighttime inn ambush without a proper bed, and <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is here to help you out! The Bed is a dungeon dressing piece that will be randomly inserted into booster packs, with the general idea of there being at least one per case (collation, as per usual, is an inexact science and is not guaranteed).</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Beaky.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151022-Beaky_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>And here we have my favorite miniature in the entire set, a bird/bear combination we can only call "Beaky". This monstrous creature is one of the largest of its time produced in prepainted plastic to date, and while he's technically a Large creature, he really pushes the limits of his size in a way that's sure to send shivers up the spines of your players. Beaky is <i>substantial</i>, in terms of size, weight, and table impact. I cannot wait to get one of my very own. Beaky is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week. Join us in seven days as we reveal more amazing figures from <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain,</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">For those of you that are big fans of monsters like me, paging through a bestiary is always a delight. While we pull many of our devious and dangerous creatures from folklore, we also draw from pop culture from time to time. Many of us here are fond of horror movies (and monster movies), and it's no small surprise that a number of our monsters are inspired by the movies we so love.</span></p> 
               <p>As a Halloween treat, here's a list of ten monsters from our bestiaries that owe part of their origin to the silver screen. For this list I tried to stick to influences that were strictly movie-based instead of things from folklore that happen to be the monstrous stars of horror movies, otherwise this list would be full of vampires, werewolves, flesh golems, ghosts, and even leprechauns (<i>oh, come on... you know you've seen at least one of the </i>Leprechaun<i> movies</i>).</p> 
               <p>And now for our feature presentation...</p>

              <p class="date">Tuesday, October 20, 2015</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">During PaizoCon 2015, we stood onstage with designer Liz Spain and revealed that the next <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> Adventure Path would be <em>Mummy's Mask</em>. And we said that we'd be releasing it in February. As it turns out, we're right an even 50 percent of the time.</p> 
               <p>Since the announcement, we've received a lot of feedback from customers, retailers, and distributors that our release schedule is outpacing all but our most enthusiastic players. People are still playing <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, or even <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>, and they aren't ready for a new set yet. So we've decided to delay <em>Mummy's Mask</em> until we feel the market is ready. That may mean July, and it may mean October, but it definitely doesn't mean February. When we commit to a firm date, we'll let you know. But fear not—it will come.</p> 
               <p>But wait a minute, you say—what if you <i>are</i> one of our most enthusiastic players? No worries. There's going to be plenty to keep you busy. We'll continue to release Class Decks: In the first five months of 2016, you can expect to see the Oracle, Alchemist, Inquisitor, Witch, and Gunslinger decks. We're even increasing the number of newly designed boons in some of those decks. (Hint: Damiel gets a pet giant slug.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-GiantSlug.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-GiantSlug_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Yikes!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>So great! That's a whole lot of new characters and boons, but what are you going to do with them? Where are the new <i>scenarios</i> to play through? If you've played through <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> (maybe a couple times), completed <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, and sailed through <a href="">Season of the Shackles</a>, you're probably just waiting for us to release the end of <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> and <a href="">Season of the Righteous</a>... and you need MORE!</p> 
               <p>Well, we have just the thing. We're pleased to announce the next Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild season:</p> 
               <h2>Season of the Runelords</h2> 
               <p>Imagine that you decided to release a game based on a system you created, and you wanted the most sweeping story to go with it. Some full-on epic thing. It's no accident that the <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> base set was one of the biggest sellers in Paizo's history—that story is really, really good. It's chock full of giants and dragons and ogres and all manner of malevolent things.</p> 
               <p>So we're going back to the well. A whole lot of you own <em>Runelords</em>, and we want that to be something you can play for a long, long time. We're making a brand-new, epic Season of the Runelords, spanning the entire length of the story. But we might mix things up a little bit. Okay, a whole lot. Because you can only burn down Sandpoint Cathedral so many times. (Ten, fifteen times, tops.)</p> 
               <p>And hey, remember this ol' horsey-monster? And this bad mamma-jamma?</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Remember how we never actually used them as villains for a scenario? Well, we've got plans for them. Big, big plans.</p> 
               <p>This will also harmonize with Obsidian's release of the PACG digital game, which (surprise!) will start with Rise of the Runelords. So we've been looking back at Runelords to see where we can improve it a little bit for the digital version. Nips and tucks, mostly. But we think you'll like what you see. And it'll tie in nicely with what we do in the Adventure Card Guild.</p> 
               <p>Season of the Runelords will begin early next year. It'll be glorious! Come play!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">The array of armaments available to archers, armigers, assassins, and the like has grown considerably since Paizo first published the fighter and the categories of weapons used in the class's weapon training ability. <a href="/products/btpy8mcz"><em>Ultimate Combat</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy8tmc"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9c23"><em>Melee Tactics Toolbox</em></a> all did admirable jobs of cataloging to which category each of the new weapons belonged, yet some implements of destruction have never received this treatment—especially those that are iconic weapons in on Golarion.</p> 
               <p>For the majority of these—by my count—290 weapons, there's little doubt as to where a given weapon falls (at least I hope we agree that a barbed spear does, in fact, fall into the "spears" category). For some it's a little less clear. In the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>, players have done an admirable job of making educated guesses when wielding battle poi or a ripsaw glaive regarding which category to use. However, it's nice to have confirmation about these things to minimize any table variation that might otherwise hamper the PC. In fact, players have requested this clarification <a href="/threads/rzs2kxk7">time</a> and <a href="/threads/rzs2scn5">time</a> and <a href="/threads/rzs2rjvy">time</a> again.</p> 
               <p>For those participating in the organized play program, this blog is going to appear as one of the legal sources on the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources">Additional Resources page</a>. If you're running a home game, you're certainly welcome to use it or disregard it as befits your campaign and play style. Especially in light of the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9hdy"><em>Player Companion: Weapon Master's Handbook</em></a>, I hope that perusing the list inspires you to use some obscure weapons you hadn't considered and build even more exciting characters.</p> 
               <p>Any weapons that appear in <em>Ultimate Combat</em>, <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>, or <em>Melee Tactics Toolbox</em> have not changed categories, though following discussions with the Pathfinder design team, a few more weapons were added to the Double Weapons and Thrown group. Any other weapons originate from <a href="" products btpy8ief><em>Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy9gro><em>Campaign Setting: Distant Shores</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8dmf><em>Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy89ca><em>Player Companion: Cheliax, Empire of Devils</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8b9j><em>Player Companion: Dwarves of Golarion</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8dmh><em>Player Companion: Gnomes of Golarion</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8i8p><em>Player Companion: Halflings of Golarion</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8l3k><em>Player Companion: Humans of Golarion</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy99s6><em>Player Companion: Ranged Tactics Toolbox</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8fo1><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</em></a>, <a href="" products btpy8rv2><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide</em></a>, and <a href="" products btpy9926><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a> (and possibly another book or two I didn't note while listing references).</p> 
               <p>Thanks also to Andrew Christian, Dave Higaki, and Robert Thomson for their assistance in reviewing these lists and tracking down a few weapons I missed.</p>

               <p>By the time contestants reach the last round, they've truly gotten a taste of how difficult the creative process can be. All of our contestants have done wonderful jobs not only producing interesting entries, but dealing with the pressures of forum critiques and the frustrations that come with not being able to jump in and correct inaccurate or unfair interpretations of their work. Every contestant has had to worry about how voters are reacting to a previous entry while trying to prepare to produce a new bit of game material for the next round. Over the course of the contest this process covers magic items, maps, monsters, and encounter design—some of the lynchpins in the toolbox of designing a good rpg adventure. I appreciate the hard work and dedication every contestant put into their entries, and hope those for whom the contest is over can sit back, relax, and enjoy the last round.</p> 
               <p>Of course for 4 contestants, things aren't over just yet. Major congratulations go to Charlie Brooks, Jason Evans, Crystal Malarsky, and Nick Wasko, who have one more round to face. While they might wish to bask in the accomplishment of knowing that each of them is going to get to write an adventure of us—a <a href="/pathfinder/modules">Pathfinder Module</a> for the winner, and a Pathfinder Society scenario for our runners-up, there's really no time to for them to relax.</p>

               <p>The last challenge is the biggest one—a 2,000 word adventure proposal to be used to form the outline of the winner's final published book. Our Top 4 have until 11:59 PM on October 22, to turn in their proposals. Each must be for a 32-40 page adventure for 5th level characters, set in the Sodden Lands, and focusing on a location-based adventure. Voting will begin on October 26, and our winner will be announced October 30.</p> 
               <p>It's been a great contest so far, and I hope everyone will join me in congratulating the final four on their success making it to the final round, thank all our contestants for the fabulous work and ideas they've provided us throughout the previous challenges, and offer sincere appreciation for the voters and judges who have helped us sort through the entries to get us this far.</p>

Not pictured (because we ran out of art budget): the holy symbol of Mazludeh (goddess of balance and community).</p>

               <p><a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is loosely themed around the types of characters and creatures you might find in a tavern in the Pathfinder world. That's meant a fair number of "NPC types" as well as urban adversaries. This week we've got a nice mix of both creature types.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-VampireSpawn.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-VampireSpawn_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>First up this week is the Vampire Spawn, a sort of lesser vampire created by a real vampire as a servitor. Stats for Vampire Spawn appear on page 271 of the <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>. These nighttime creatures make for a chilling urban ambush, so we've put the Vampire Spawn at the common rarity to make sure your vampire villains can build up a whole gang of them. The Vampire Spawn is a Medium figure. It's also the final common figure of the set. From this point forward, everything I reveal will be either uncommon or rare.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-Aristocrat.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-Aristocrat_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>I'll probably never get sick of miniatures of rich people in nice clothes, and <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon's</em></a> Aristocrat is the latest to come down the line. The Aristocrat's fine staff makes him a good proxy for a wizard or cleric, and I think his style runs the line between good and evil, making him an excellent option of a stylish hero or villain. The Aristocrat is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-GhoulMonarch.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151016-GhoulMonarch_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the insidious Ghoul Monarch, from page 87 of the <a href="/products/btpy9926"><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a>. This CR 12 beast was originally slated at rare due to his high degree of challenge at the table, but in production we realized that his simple design and relatively basic paint scheme would be better at uncommon, leaving the rare figures for truly unique or challenging sculpts. I think that works fine. While three of these guys on your table might not make sense as “monarchs,” they work great for any kind of spellcasting ghoul adversary. The Ghoul Monarch is a Medium figure.</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week. Swing by this space in seven days for another look at more minis from <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>!</p>

                <p>I've always been a big proponent of using technology to make your game run smoother, and so I put some of my old class skills to use. As some of you may have noticed during our latest update, some portions of the PRD got a bit of an improvement—most specifically the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/bestiary.html">Bestiary</a> and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/spelllists.html">Spell List Indexes</a>. More than just an alphabetical listing now, the new Bestiary Index now allows you to sort by Challenge Rating (including highlighting CRs based on the calculated APL), creature type and subtype, climate and terrain, size, and also a quick way to find companions, character races, cohorts, and familiars. (I also threw in the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/indices/templates.html">Template Index</a> as well.) For the Spell List Index, there was a lot of data corrections (not to mention that the bloodrager and shaman spell lists are now completely listed), and there's now an option to filter your results by a spell's school.</p> 
                <p>I'm not done hammering out some improvements to help you find the information you need to run your game or select options for your character—I'm just getting started! Keep your eyes out for a few other "free-tures" in our coming updates!</p> 
                <p>Happy gaming, and may your next crit confirm!</p>

               <p>Not sure you're cut out for crime? The bloodstains on your boots speak otherwise. I mean, we're all cut out for a little petty larceny, but you certainly have no qualms cutting out what's owed you. But if you'd rather look into a new line of work, the guide offers a few helpful hints, like the pesh-addled sorcerer of sleep; get your jollies and give them out for free. You'll be the absolute life of the party. Or push your own brands of magical death by becoming an Eldritch Poisoner; pairs well with the selection of magical necrotoxins I'm selling these days— and for you, pretty one, I'll offer a lovely bulk discount.</p> 
               <p>Wherever you're going, you'll need a few tricks like those anyway. I can stock you up on personal, portable traps—you do seem like the paranoid sort. Or a few polished-up cursed relics you can sell as genuine magic. Seven Hells, I've a man out back who will stich ghouls' guts into you for enough coin. Whatever it takes to finish this deal and get you out of my shop, before disrespectable sorts come looking for the bauble you've brought me. <a href="/products/btpy9h7x">Check the book</a>, pretty-pretty, tell me what you need, and let's get your new life started.</p>

                <br> <i>These awesome stories and more of our Pathfinder Tales novels are now available through Audible!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>One of the best things about the way Audible has approached these books is the amazing team of narrators they've assembled. For the last several months, my phone's been ringing day, night, and weekends as the narrators make sure they get pronunciations right for every character, city, and monster. (I actually spent a whole layover on the flight home from Gen Con sitting in an airport carefully speaking monster names into my phone—I'm sure the folks sitting near me thought I was summoning a demon via teleconference.) Not only is it fun to have a huge range of voices reading the books, but it's gratifying to see the narrators equally passionate about the work—not only are they all skilled voice artists, but some were already playing Pathfinder!</p> 
               <p>Yet that's not the only announcement I've been dying to make. While I mentioned it a bit on social media when it first went live, <b><i>all of the Pathfinder Tales novels are now available on Kindle</i></b> through Amazon. It's something I've been working on since literally before the first novel released, and I'm thrilled that our relationship with Tor has allowed us to finally get every Pathfinder Tales novel released in all the major formats—including the biggest contender in the ring.</p> 
               <p>It's a proud day for Pathfinder Tales. So whether you prefer to read in hard copy, on an e-reader, or while driving to work*, I hope you check out the novels!</p> 
               <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive Editor</i></p> 
               <p class="tiny">* Actually, that last one only applies if you're reading via audiobook—otherwise you should probably keep your eyes on the road.</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">The <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> is a cooperative game for 1 to 4 players, with an expansion for 5 or 6 players. When I tell people this at conventions, I usually end up repeating it, because "1 to 4 players" rolls naturally off the tongue, and so many people miss the "1" at the start. When we first launched PACG, true one-player games were relatively rare, and my own experience suggested that most people were listening for that high number, not the low one.</p> 
               <p>Solo play in the PACG is an interesting thing all by itself, in that it was both intentional and accidental. By that, I mean that we had always expected that the game engine would work with one person, but we didn't always expect that it would be a lot of fun to play solo. In fact, at one point in early development, Mike and I had a conversation that included this question: "Have we invented 'grinding'?" If you don't know, "grinding" is a common MMORPG term that describes game play experiences that are considered helpful for advancement, but usually separate from the good, fun parts of the game. It also has an important meaning in the world of poker, but I defer all conversations about poker to the honorable Mr. Selinker.</p> 
               <p>I'm telling you all this as a lead-in to an abstract discussion about how PACG responds to a variable number of players and characters. After some testing, we determined that one-player games were actually quite fun (probably not for everyone, but few game experiences are really good for everyone). Seven-player and eight-player games worked okay, but the extra downtime and overhead really did seem to make things drag for almost everyone. Six-player games were still pretty good; probably a bit long for some people, but if you're the sort of group that regularly has six people at the table at once, you're probably already prepared for the ups and downs that brings. It also helps that six is a traditional big table size for an RPG campaign, because we thought that some of our players were likely to be Pathfinder RPG groups that played PACG as an alternative.</p> 
               <p>The fundamental way that the game scales for variable number of characters is through the number of locations that are involved in each scenario. If you've played any of the PACG Adventure Paths, you've probably figured out that the default arrangement is "two more locations than players." This gives everyone a chance to start spread out, grouped up, or in a mixture of the two while still leaving a few places open to the future. It means that you can't quite end the game right out of the gate, even with outstanding luck. There are just too many places to cover. If you're designing your own scenarios, keep in mind that you almost always want there to be more "places" than "people." This creates room for progress.</p> 
               <p>The other major concern for scaling based on the number of characters in play is the game's timer: the blessings deck. This deck is nearly always 30 cards (and if it isn't 30, it's pretty darn close). This is somewhat counter-intuitive, because it seems plausible to most people that increasing the number of people should increase the number of turns to succeed. In truth, the math is trickier than it seems. If you dig in and figure out the right value for the timer for each of the cases from one to six players, it's always very close to 30.</p> 
               <p>I'm starting out talking about number of locations and number of cards in the timer deck, both because they're two of the biggest scaling factors, but also because they form the basis for discussing two different types of challenges in PACG: difficulty versus time. The game is balanced around the idea that you can usually succeed against any individual card, if you're willing and able to take enough time. Conversely, you can usually get through enough of the cards in a given scenario to see what you need to see in order to win the scenario, but you might not have the resources to succeed at everything you want to do along the way. Of course, in order to win the scenario, you need both: You need to see certain important cards, and you need to succeed against them. (We could also describe this as a tension between short-term and long-term success.) The tension between the two factors is important, and maintaining it is a tricky balancing act. This is also one reason why we have scenarios that change the parameters: we're shifting the balance of success versus time. When we add another location, we're pushing the "time" side; when we make all Goblins harder to defeat, we're pushing the difficulty side.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LocalHeroes.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LocalHeroes_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-HereComesTheFlood.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-HereComesTheFlood_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This also impacts in the number of characters, because while the number of important locations goes up, the number of cards in the timer deck does not. Obviously, this means that more characters will each have less time to accomplish roughly the same tasks than fewer characters. The game naturally tilts towards increased encounter difficulty in a one-player game or increased time pressure in a six-player game. In fact, many people, upon first seeing the game, assume that the timer deck <i>size</i> must adjust based on the number of players. This comes from a perfectly natural assessment. With more cards to get through, we'll need more time to get through it all, won't we?</p> 
               <p>The answer, it turns out, is "somewhat, but not as much as you probably think". Clearly, one character can be fairly cautious when using 30 "turns" to get through 30 (10 per location) cards, while six characters will each need to press through quite a bit more cards in location decks to get through 80 cards in those same 30 "turns." For many people looking at PACG for the first time, those numbers seem so far apart that it seems like something must be off. In practice, though, most six-player groups get through those scenarios with about the same win rate—that is, success <i>against the scenario</i>. In fact, we found that larger groups tend to win scenarios a little more often than smaller groups. Usually, these games take longer than one-player sessions of the same scenario, so that total rate of progress is pretty close to the same. Those of you who wrangle six-person tables (of any game!) know that there's often a certain overhead to it that makes a slightly higher win rate (and thus, a lower repeat rate) a welcome turn of events.</p> 
               <p>How does this work out? If two characters use twice as many cards from the timer deck, how do they keep up with the increased number of cards in location decks? There are many factors, but the biggest (I think) is the marvelous power of synergy. In PACG, characters are wonderful, powerful things. Simply put, having more characters gives the players more potential power. There are more cards in players' hands, more character and role card powers, and more major and minor areas of the game covered. This is potent by itself, but when you add in the ability to combine those cards, powers, and areas of expertise, that's where large groups catch up.</p> 
               <p>Let's look at either end of the scale. With one character, a typical scenario will have 3 locations of 10 cards each, including a villain and 2 henchmen. With a timer deck of 30 cards, the solo character can afford to proceed with caution, at least much of the time. A solo character probably wants a relatively narrow range of boons, but this opens up the use of random boons as "hit points," fuel for other powers, and one-shot effects. In a three-player game, Amiri probably has to consider whether to give that Cure spell to Lini or banish it for its sweet 1d4+1 cards right now; in a one-character game, there are no such concerns. With 30 turns, Harsk can afford to wait and reset his hand whenever things get a little tense. Kyra can afford to spend her first exploration on a turn to heal herself, even if she does nothing else. Merisiel, in many ways the iconic solo character, can just call "whoops, evade!" over and over in a way that would cause some serious time pressure in a six-player game.</p> 
               <p>If we add a second character—something that we recommend, just because the wide variety of challenges can make it <b>really</b> hard for a single character to handle everything we might throw at you—the math mostly remains the same. There are now 40 cards in 4 locations, and 30 "turns" in the timer deck. There's some pressure to explore more than once a turn, but it's usually not overwhelming. Slow and Steady, as they say, wins the scenario. (At least, I think that's how the saying goes.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Lem.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Lem_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Merisiel.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Merisiel_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br><i>Two great tastes that might not taste great together in your first two-character team.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>On the other end, the six-player group typically has to cover 8 locations of 10 cards each, including a villain and a gaggle of henchmen, and they've got to do it with the same 30 cards in the blessings deck. This means that the large group needs to build and maintain momentum. If each character encounters only 1 card each time she discards the top of the timer deck, the group really isn't going to see most of the cards in the scenario. That said, things aren't exactly bleak for the large group; in fact, they generally succeed slightly more often.</p> 
               <p>You might wonder why this happens, and there are many reasons. As a group, they usually can cover all of the bases. The group can include both characters that like to stay with others and characters that like to be left alone. Valeros can afford to spend most of his blessings to explore his location again and again, because there are 5 other hands that can donate a blessing if he <i>really</i> needs it. In fact, there are just a lot more cards in general, so there are usually resources available for helping—adding to a check, healing damage, scouting locations, moving characters around, and so on. When the group is looking at defending open locations, chances are really good that <b>someone</b> is good at whatever needs to be done, whether that's succeeding at a skill check, bashing monsters, or just having the right kind of card to spend. The number of weak spots goes down and the ability to cover weak spots goes up. Sure, there's a bit more competition for some resources, but when encounters <b>count</b>, the large group can almost always find a way.</p> 
               <p>There's another big factor, too: that gaggle of henchmen. While 80 cards in 30 "turns" sounds like a lot, the math is actually much friendlier; the group needs to get through 8 locations, rather than 80 cards. Breaking out some basic statistics, the chances are good (very good) that several of those locations <i>can</i> be closed after encountering roughly half of the location deck. In Statistically Average World, the large group will get to close each location after the fifth or sixth card. If they're successful each time they get this chance, they're now seeing about 50 cards instead of 80. Remember that large groups have a much greater ability to succeed at "important" checks. They have more collective resources to bring to bear, so their chances here are good. They can also afford (some might say "need") to be a bit more aggressive in exploring, because the group safety net is stronger.</p> 
               <h2>Different Challenges for Different Groups</h2> 
               <p>I've talked about the different types of challenge faced by small and large groups, and hopefully that makes sense to you now. Next I want to talk about how we design for these different types of challenge, including how we impact each type of group, and how we break it.</p> 
               <p>If we make the cost of failure against a particular card especially high, this tends to hit the small group harder than the large group. The large group can usually rally for "important" moments in a way that the smaller group can't. This is especially true for nasty henchmen, villains, locations, and scenarios.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br> <i>Meet the original RotR Power Couple.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>This is something that we keep in mind when we design scenarios especially. While we try to make sure that most groups see most of the cards in a given set, we also try to arrange to keep the "meaner" locations towards the end of the locations list, so that they show up more often for larger groups that are better equipped the deal with them.</p> 
               <p>When small groups get into trouble, it's often because they really need to do something that is hard for the group (say, a Divine check for Merisiel and Ezren) and they're low on resources at that time. Effects that take cards out of your hand before the encounter are rough here, because they're more likely to "hit where it hurts" in a small group.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Enchanter.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Enchanter_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>On the other hand, the "horde" barriers are a good example of cards that are aimed at keeping the challenge high for large groups. When we force an encounter for everyone, we expect that some of the characters will be able to best the encounter with minimal resources (which is great, because it lets a player feel mastery), but often there will also be a few characters who need help. This provides an opportunity for the group to come together and figure out how to handle the challenge as a group. Sometimes, this involves someone sacrificing himself to the challenge, thus spending his resources on someone else. In these situations, we almost always let the group decide the order for the encounters. We do this not just because it feels right for a cooperative game, but also because it enables these sorts of tactical and strategic decisions. When a "horde" bane must be defeated by everyone in order to itself be defeated, this creates a different strategic cascade than if the horde is defeated based solely on your check, so you'll probably want to proceed in a different order and play different cards for each.</p>

               <p>With this in mind, if you look through the various APs, I'll bet you can see its influence everywhere. You'll see it when a giant deals damage to everyone at its location; when a scenario encourages (or forces) everyone to group up; when a villain makes "you" or "a character at your location" summon and encounter another bane; when you're looking to see whether an item helps characters "at your location" or anywhere; or when a power counts the number of open locations, or characters, or locations. You'll also see it when you put characters who like groups (like <em>RotR</em> Lem or Valeros) alongside characters who want to be by themselves (like <em>RotR</em> Merisiel)... or at least, characters who want to be somewhere other than where the fight currently is (like <em>RotR</em> Harsk).</p>

               <h2>Adventure Paths: Different but Same</h2> 
               <p>Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about how we use this aspect of the game when we're designing Adventure Paths. Anyone who read my previous blog about the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhm4">Differences in Difficulty between the APs</a> should know that we aim for different experiences in difficulty over time between the Adventure Paths. We also use differences in scaling of groups to try to give each AP its own feel, but we want to keep the underlying game the same. This flows both from our attempts to make the game "different but the same", and it also flows naturally from the story of the Adventure Paths themselves. There are two specific examples that I think are worth talking about here: ships and armies.</p> 
               <p>In <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we knew right away that we wanted to have ships in the game. We played with several different systems for ships and ship combat before settling on the system used in the AP, and several of the changes came directly out of group size scaling. Comparing <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em> to <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, it should be immediately obvious that there are some specific skills that are very important to <em>S&amp;S</em>, including the skills that represent sailing, navigating, commanding, and repairing a ship. The characters in <em>S&amp;S</em> vary in their talent with these skills, but we tried to make sure that every character that we felt should be naturally good at dealing with a ship <i>alone</i> should have some way to be good at these skills, because we wanted to make sure that small groups could play the AP. Rather than having a specific location separate from the characters, the ship is (when not docked) assumed to be at the location of the active player. It comes and goes, and when it's your turn, the ship is with you. We also changed the way structural damage worked so that anyone could deal with it rather than only the characters at the relevant location. This change made the ship and its upkeep feel like it was a group responsibility, rather than an individual character's. These two factors balanced each other. Some characters are naturally better with ships than others, including dealing with trouble, should it occur. At the same time, everyone can use the ship, and a large group has a greater ability to deal with ship troubles when they happen.</p> 
               <p>In <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, we were looking instead to create a "crowded" feel. You start off overwhelmed. Once you regain your bearings, you get to reassert your (protagonist-level) control of the situation, but the enemy still has you outnumbered. To this end, we created armies, both yours and theirs. As nascent Big Damn Heroes, your army is more of a tool for you to personally wield than it is a method to get someone else to deal with the problem, but that shouldn't be a surprise. On the other side, army barriers require an increasingly difficult coordination and mastery challenge, represented by the set of six checks, each of which must be made without repeating. In practice, this means that small groups can usually find something that they're good at with a small expenditure of resources. With a larger group, chances increase that someone is forced to try something hard for them, but conversely, other characters should be able to find something relatively easy. The group <i>as a whole</i> must come together in order to have any hope of defeating enemy armies.</p> 
               <p>This is a big subject, and while I've written quite a lot about it, I'm sure I've missed some parts of it. Please, throw me your questions below, and I'll either answer them here or pull them together for a follow-up blog post, or maybe both.</p> 
               <p>Until then, thanks for playing!</p>

               <blockquote>
                The Minneapolis/St. Paul Pathfinder Lodge held the inaugural <a href="http://www.skalcon.org/" target="_blank">SkålCon</a> convention September 18-20. This convention, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhw7">previously featured in the Paizo blog</a>, had all proceeds donated to <a href="http://www.tubman.org/" target="_blank">Tubman</a>, Minnesota's largest provider of crisis services. By any and all measures, our convention was a success.
                <p></p> 
                <p>Over 80 people came together as a community to play some Pathfinder and raise more funds for Tubman than I ever thought we would. Going into September I thought, "If we can raise $1500 I'm going to be really happy." We smashed $1500 by 6:20 PM Friday night! At 8:30 PM we surpassed our goal of $2000. When I made the announcement to the room that we had made our goal and that I would be getting a shave and a haircut, Chris Mortika, unprompted, called out "How much more do we need to raise to get Andy [Christian] to shave his head?" Andy set our next goal; we needed to raise $3500.</p> 
                <p>In the end, we raised $3735 for Tubman. It is a testament to our players' generosity and kindness. As Andy remarked to me Saturday night, "This makes all the hard work and [everything else] of the past six years worth it." I couldn't agree more.</p> 
                <p>I had an opportunity to tour one of Tubman's transitional housing centers in Minneapolis when I stopped by to make our donation. Knowing our efforts are going to those in need was very heartening. Meeting the staff that do all the hard work and make people's lives better was an added perk. Being able to say "Thank you" to them while I was there, while not much of a thing, was still gratifying; especially when their eyes lit up when it was explained who I was and why I was there. Our plan is to continue working with Tubman next year and into the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p>Thank you, Pathfinder community, for supporting our convention. To the volunteers and organizers whom kept the convention running with no emergencies. Without their hard work, dedication SkålCon would not exist. Thank you to everyone who donated items to our silent auction. Thanks to everyone we chased down during PaizoCon to collect signatures for auction items. Thank you to Clinton Boomer who volunteered his time to run three sessions of the retired scenario "Hands of the Muted God", and to John Compton for allowing us to offer this scenario for credit. Clinton will be back next year, so if you want to maybe play a retired scenario for credit...</p> 
                <p>Running a convention for charity is hard work, but a rewarding community experience. If you feel like starting one in your area, know that you have our support. I am more than happy to help in any way I can.</p>

I had to escape from the terrible Cobra Clutch of Sgt. Slaughter himself to bring today’s blog to you, so let’s make it a good one!</p> 
               <p>We all love monsters, right? And when it comes to miniatures, I’m a big proponent of “bigger is better.” Lots of people, if presented with a time machine, would go back to solve some prominent historical mystery, or to witness some great achievement first hand. At this point what I would probably do is go back and convince the earliest tabletop gaming figure companies to make their tin soldiers just a little bit larger, so the gamers of future generations could get more detail on their prepainted plastic miniatures.</p> 
               <p>I imagine those gamers would be shocked by the idea of well-painted plastic figures of today’s quality, but shame on them for living in the past. In retrospect it was a very poor choice.</p> 
               <p>So, since regular-scaled minis are so small, it’s really something to get a larger creature, because they often have so many more details and personality. Today’s previews are certainly expressive, well-sculpted monsters that benefit from a larger presentation. I’ve seen all three in-hand at this point, and I’m proud of all of them.</p> 
               <p>These figures are all in the forthcoming <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9er4?Pathfinder-Battles-Rusty-Dragon-Inn">The Rusty Dragon Inn</a> set. </p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the Kirrix, an enormous six-legged rat monstrosity from the ratfolk section of the <a href="/products/btpy9926"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Monster Codex</em></a>. When that art rolled in, I couldn’t resist putting it on the fast track for miniature-dom. What a great match he makes for our oversized Dire Rat from <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8mq6?Pathfinder-Battles-Heroes-Monsters">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> or the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy91l0?Pathfinder-Battles-Skull-Shackles-Wererat">Wererat</a> from <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8xg6?Pathfinder-Battles-Skull-Shackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>. Rats are mainstays in dungeons, and I think this beast has what it takes to be the pinnacle fight against a whole rat-based faction. His mouth is huuuuge. The Kirrix is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>This imposing Flesh Golem will look very familiar to players of <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5s?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-44-Trial-of-the-Beast">"The Trial of the Beast"</a>, the second adventure in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown">Carrion Crown Adventure Path</a>, since the image comes directly from that volume’s cover. I’ve never seen a better flesh golem illustration than that one, so into the minis line he went. We’ve only got a few more “core” golems to go, and lots more from the later Bestiaries after that. Very exciting! The Flesh Golem looms over other figures, being an amalgamation of body parts from other similarly Large creatures. Seeing this guy hit the table will definitely have your players reaching for their torches and pitchforks. The Flesh Golem is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>There have been a lot of dragons hitting the prepainted plastic market in recent years, so I’m not in quite the hurry that I once was to cover all of the sizes of all of the basic dragons. That said, some of our dragon designs, like Ben Wootten’s Silver Dragon, simply cry out to be made in prepainted plastic, and who am I to resist their clarion call? They have breath weapons, don’t you know? The Silver Dragon is a Large, rare figure.</p> 
               <p>That’s it for this week. Come on back next Friday with a look at more figures from <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9er4?Pathfinder-Battles-Rusty-Dragon-Inn">The Rusty Dragon Inn</a>. I still have such sights to show you.</p>

               <p>Oh yes, we know that particular flavor of frantic look. You are far from the first whose eyes it has crossed, friend, and so long as the sun continues to rise you will not be the last.</p> 
               <p>You found a book, and in your childlike naiveté you assumed this book held answers. That is the lie we teach our children, after all: Books hold answers. Knowledge is power. Broaden yourself and you shall no longer be the fearful, mewling lump you dropped into this world as.</p> 
               <p>But now you know the truth.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">You read your <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>. You assumed it would satisfy you; would answer your questions. But now you're left with an intellectual hunger no crumb of written word can sate. Yet you scrape through the cupboards, hoping—no, begging to a universe you hope is just that page will relieve the pangs for just One. More. Day.</p> 
               <p>It won't. It can't. The truth of this world—beneath the playful façade of queens and dragons we set out to delight clumsier minds—is grisly and devoid of sense. I have the book you want; the book you need. This book of <a href="/products/btpy9grw"><em>Occult Origins</em></a> tempts you with so many new secrets—questions you never even thought to ask—but it can't offer peace of mind. You knew this before you stepped in, and yet here we both stand. You need to know how kineticists are born, and why they hurl the fundamental forces of the universe as carelessly as a child throws a disobedient doll. You long to know why the psychic mind can overwrite a world you believed to be so stable and sound and impervious to whim. But this book isn't a book of answer. You will leave here all the hungrier. But you will leave here book in hand, knowing you are richer, and perhaps one step closer to mad.</p>

               <p>The <a href="/products/btpy9grw"><em>Occult Origins</em></a> tells of chaokineticists, who channel the universe's devouring maw and wield death and decay, and the phytokinetic disciplines of distant Tian, who kindle the energy of life to violent and deadly ends. It whispers the secrets of Chelish mental disciplines to wither the unbending will of devils. It details the ancient art of the reliquarians, who suckle powers the gods themselves leave in their passing. It will teach you how to develop the powers of your psychic mind through introspection, or reflection on the lives—and deaths—you have long since outgrown. It can teach you to modify the delicate web of bone of sinew that contains the immortal essence of your being.</p>

                <p class="stat-block-title">Trepanation</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">Through careful study and practice, you have learned how to relieve pressure in the brain to balance the humors, promote health, and ward off outside influence.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Heal 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> You can perform the faith healing occult skill unlock<sup>OA</sup> even if you can't use psychic magic. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity<sup>OA</sup> feat, you can use faith healing one additional time per day.<br> So long as you have a healer's kit<sup>UE</sup> or surgeon's tools<sup>UE</sup>, you can spend 1 hour performing a full trepanation on a creature. This procedure requires a Heal check (DC = 20 + the target's Hit Dice). If you're successful, the target gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against curses, possession, and spells from the enchantment (compulsion) school. These effects persist for 1 day per character level you possess. If you fail the check, the target takes 1d3 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. You can perform this procedure on yourself, but the DC increases by 5.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>But it can't tell you such things are the law of the land, or pull aside the shadows far larger forces cast across your world—perhaps even across your self. It teaches occult rituals to bind gods into your army or force back psychic influence, but it can never teach you why an assemblage of words and willpower make the strict laws of creation shudder and cower.</p> 
               <p>But maybe it gives you just enough. Maybe this keeps you hungry enough that you keep asking questions and checking dark corners. Maybe you'll be the first to understand the why of it all without losing your life or your mind. Most likely not, but maybe. Gods' speed to you.</p> 
               <p>Or whatever you pray to.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Want to learn what lies beyond the border of the Inner Sea region? Eager to set sail to mysterious Arcadia, follow trade roads into vast Casmaron, or venture to legendary Vudra? The journey you chose is up to you, but your destination is right here: <a href="/products/btpy9gro"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Shores</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>Over years of developing the Inner Sea region we've dropped countless hints about this mysterious relic from Iblydos or that distant ruin in Holomog. Now, we're pulling back the curtain just a peak. Actually, we're pulling back six curtains, revealing destination cities on the fringes of such mysterious lands as Arcadia, Casmaron, Iblydos, Tian-Xia, Southern Garund, and Vudra. For the first time ever, we're detailing major cities in these distant regions (or unexplored nations therein), giving you full-fledged, thriving settings for you to explore. Each of these six cities presents new rules options along with them, be they a new player race, new deities to worship, new mythic abilities to claim, or other character options, assuring that your journey to distant shores leaves a distinctive mark.</p> 
               <p>As defining the lands beyond the Inner Sea region is such a major undertaking for us, we trusted these explorations to six in-house authors who have already proven themselves experts on these rich lands. In their authors' words, here are the six cities you'll find in Distant Shores, as well as some of the most exciting elements you'll learn about in each.</p> 
               <h2>Aelyosos, City of Tides, by John Compton</h2> 
               <p>The people of Iblydos owe their existence to the cyclopses that emigrated from Ghol-Gan during that doomed empire's decline, and though the giants have dwindled in number since, they and humans continue to co-exist on the archipelago. The greatest mortals earn the rite of myth-speaking, in which the cyclopses foresee how that hero might attain mythic power through great deeds. Many of these so-called hero-gods have since ruled one of Iblydos's city-states, granting spells to followers and heralding in a new age of prosperity or tyranny. Since the deaths of Aroden and prophecy itself, the tradition has failed with troubling frequency. Now the last hero-gods age and dwindle, and a new generation of heroes must arise to combat the greatest threat to the islands: the thalassic behemoth Ousmariku.</p>

               </div> 
               <h2>Anuli, City of New Beginnings, by Crystal Frasier</h2> 
               <p>I wrote up Anuli, the furthest-north city in the celestially empowered nation of Holomog. It stands out as a matriarchy that isn't evil, and as a good-aligned nation that still has plenty of possibility for adventure: political intrigue, chaos cults, an evil nation of undead on their borders, and 10,000 years worth of abandoned cities and ruins. Anuli is also the only nation on Golarion that has been continuously exposed to the energies of the outer planes for millennia, causing a number of unexpected side-effects, including a new player race.</p> 
               <h2>Dhucharg, City of Conquerors, by Amanda Hamon-Kunz</h2> 
               <p>The most intriguing part about fleshing out Dhucharg was playing with the pervasive undercurrents of dissidence and discord that must naturally arise in a city with absolutely rigid and militaristic social and political structures. On one hand, I got to create a society that has a law for everything, and into which each individual literally has a prescribed place. On the other hand, there's this sense that if any of the dissident elements in the city gain traction, the entire thing might collapse. Mix that intrigue with the fact that Dhucharg is a city of hobgoblins (some of the coolest goblinoids!) and this assignment was a blast indeed!</p> 
               <h2>Radripal, City of Arches, by Mark Moreland</h2> 
               <p>Since I first read about Vudra in the original Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer, I've been captivated by this fantasy version of India. So when the opportunity arose to further flesh out this part of the setting, I couldn't let it pass me by. My favorite part of writing Radripal was getting to define three new Vudran deities (of which there are hundreds) and to detail a non-evil city ruled by a rakshasa. Placing the riverside city on both sides of a natural bridge allowed me to define two distinct parts of the city and play with the interactions between them from a religious, social, economic, and demographic perspective.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9285-Radripal.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9285-Radripal_500.jpeg"></a>
                <br><i>Illustration by Ben Wootten</i>
               </div> 
               <h2>Segada, City of Keys, by Adam Daigle</h2> 
               <p>When we first started talking about which city in Arcadia we'd detail, the first things that popped up were places that we've already mentioned, but many of us weren't interested in doing an Avistani colony in a land ripe for something new. We did realize that we needed some element of a touchstone that people were familiar with, so with Segada you get to see not only a city full of Arcadians, but you also get to see how they interact with the Avistanis that have recently come to their shores.</p> 
               <h2>Ular Kel, The Caravan City, by James L. Sutter</h2> 
               <p>A while back, I wrote <a href="/pathfinder/tales/serial/boarAndRabbit">a web fiction story called "Boar and Rabbit"</a> about two men of the Iridian Fold who are major characters in <a href="/products/btpy94r3"><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a>. I'd already decided that the Iridian Fold (introduced way back in <a href="/products/btpy8fda"><em>City of Strangers</em></a>) came from a place called Karazh in central Casmaron, a region inspired in part by the real-world steppes of Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations—places that frankly get short shrift in the States. (I'm ashamed to admit that, not that many years ago, I thought Kazakhstan had been made up by comedian Sascha Baron Cohen. I blame the American public school system.) While "Boar and Rabbit" was primarily a prince-and-pauper love story, the bits of description I was able to seed about Karazh's capital city of Ular Kel kept nagging at me, and I started keeping notes. As soon as Wes posited the idea of the <em>Distant Shores project</em>, I pounced on it, and I'm thrilled to finally get Ular Kel out of my head and into the public eye at last!</p> 
               <p>You won't have to for long to plan your far-flung adventures, as <a href="/products/btpy9gro"><em>Distant Shores</em></a> releases this month. And be sure to let us know which regions are your favorites—as it might help us decide where to explore in more detail next!</p>

               <p>See, Mirian is a classic swashbuckling, two-fisted pulp hero, an explorer and Pathfinder who's part Indiana Jones and part Han Solo. She's also a woman of color—half native Mwangi, half colonial Chelaxian. That combination appealed to me deeply. Not just because we need more representation of rad women and heroes of color in the genre (though we absolutely do—one of the reasons I'm happy to see people connecting with characters like Seelah, or Alahazra, or Jiri from <em>Firesoul</em>). But because Sargava isn't just some adventure site full of monsters and ruins (even if some Avistani may see it that way). It's a society that's defined by racial tension, and Mirian and her brother occupy a unique place within it, neither truly a ruling colonial nor one of the native Mwangi people. That sort of conflict—both internal and external—makes for interesting characters, and provides a unique perspective from which to view that society. One of the best things fantasy can do is hold a mirror up to social issues in our own world, in a way that draws us in and lets us see ourselves more clearly. (And it's not just about skin color, either—that central idea of clashing societies and building bridges across cultural divides only multiplies when Mirian and her crew team up with a tribe of lizardfolk.)</p> 
               <p>But while I love it when fantasy addresses important social issues or interesting philosophical concepts, that's not enough to make a book for me on its own. (I can read blogs for that!) Pathfinder is a game about <i>adventure</i>, and so too do the novels need action to draw us in. Fortunately, that's something Howard Andrew Jones knows well, being a scholar of adventure fiction both old and new. After outlining Mirian to me, he promptly hooked me on the book's plot with the idea of an underwater lizardfolk city hidden in a cenote—one of those beautiful sinkholes filled with water. The idea of doing a deepwater dive <i>in the middle of the jungle</i> was so novel that I signed off on it immediately, and Mirian and her crew were forced to step off the rolling deck of the <i>Daughter of the Mists</i> and into the sweltering, unpredictable jungle.</p> 
               <p>As an interesting bit of trivia: this isn't a new story for Howard. When he originally sent me a writing sample, many years ago now, it also featured a deep water salvager—one who shared an eerie number of similarities with Mirian Raas. At the time, doing anything underwater seemed too unusual—how often do you actually run campaigns underwater?—and I was eager to have him write a more iconic "adventuring party" novel, which resulted in Elyana the elven ranger and her band of heroes. Yet that image of the bold salvagers stuck with both of us, and it's been really fun to see the characters come back around again. Some ideas just don't take no for an answer!</p>

We've published crosswords in the New York Times, constructed puzzle escape rooms and giant puzzle hunts, and we even have a 10-foot crossword wall at <a href="http://eltana.com/crosswords/" target="_blank">a bagel restaurant in Seattle</a>.

We're the kind of designers about whom people say, "Oh, I bet you think you're pretty clever."</p> 
               <p>And we do! One of our slogans is "We make puzzles for people who like games and games for people who like puzzles." Most of our games are often viewed as puzzles. When you play the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, the designers are presenting you with a puzzle: Can you defeat this Runelord before time runs out? What about rescuing this many civilians from the flood? Stopping that bomber before all your ships get sunk? We've laid down the gauntlet, and we'll see if you can run it.</p> 
               <p>But we've shied away from using actual puzzles. You won't find a palindrome on the walls or a code in the flavortext. You might find a few puzzly in-jokes—for example, I came up with the Skull &amp; Shackles location name "Scar Bay" while watching <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400506825" target="_blank">this college basketball game</a>. But we never made you a real puzzle—until the <a href="/products/btpy9dao"><em>Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth Adventure Deck</em></a>, that is. Now, as with <i>The Maze of Games</i>, we've made you a maze.</p> 
               <p>Now, making a maze in a game is challenging. James Jacobs said so in his introduction to <a href="/products/btpy92lh">the RPG version</a> of this adventure. He professed his undying love for mazes, and then continued: "But the shameful truth, I fear, is that mazes just aren't usually fun to play out in modern tabletop game sessions. In fact, I've never played in or run a tabletop game involving a significant maze that didn't outstay its welcome past the first few corners and dead ends and didn't end up with the GM simply hand-waving the exploration of the twists and turns so that everyone could get on with the next encounter or story development."</p> 
               <p>Been there, done that. So we weren't going to fall into that trap. While the other designers figured out how to make a <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li1n">worksite performance review</a> into a great scenario, Gaby and I set about to designing a maze that would be fun in the adventure card game. And we might've been a little bit... evil.</p> 
               <h2>This is Part of a Maze of Twisty Little Passages, All Alike</h2> 
               <p>The demon prince Baphomet, the Lord of the Minotaurs, was our go-to goat-guy for our labyrinthine extravaganza. The adventure takes place in the Ivory Labyrinth, his home plane in the Abyss. It is a giant maze of dark corridors and confusing twists and turns. The characters come here to find the kidnapped Herald of Iomedae because Baphomet has cloistered him in an Ineluctable Prison. It's a crazy place, and we wanted to make you feel lost and confused about where you were going. So we did.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BlackburghFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BlackburghFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BlackburghBack.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BlackburghBack_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-TwistyPassagesFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-TwistyPassagesFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-TwistyPassagesBack.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-TwistyPassagesBack_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>This is why you've got that maddening little earworm in your head.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The second and third scenarios of this adventure are your journey through the maze to reach the Ineluctable Prison. There are some tricks here that instantly bollix up your plans. The citizens of Blackburgh are real friendly types, so they want you to come visit them over and over again.</p> 
               <p>In Welcome to Blackburgh, when you move to a location, you shuffle its deck. The mere act of moving makes you lose your place. Along the way, you'll leave some breadcrumbs: You can always shuffle a card from your hand into your location deck to explore it. No more discarding that ally to explore—just fling him into the maze! You'll see him again, probably. Maybe.</p> 
               <p>In Twisty Passages, if you close a location, you reassign the location cards to different location decks. So here we make you move <i>without</i> making you move. When you encounter a blessing, you'll conjure up the weird base set location Middle of Nowhere, sticking you in a dead end at the very time you expect to feel like you're making progress. That cardless location stops you from helping folks at other locations and drains cards from the blessings deck when you want to leave. So far, so fun, right?</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BlackburghLocation.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BlackburghLocation_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-IvoryLabyrinthLocation.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-IvoryLabyrinthLocation_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-LightlessMazeLocation.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-LightlessMazeLocation_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Um, didn't we just leave here?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The plane's capital city is Blackburgh, home to Baphomet's tower. The Ivory Labyrinth extends out from it, and the Lightless Maze is its scariest section. These three cards make up the heart of the maze engine. The first three locations of these scenarios form a mind-boggling triptych.</p> 
               <p>Blackburgh is like the entrance to the maze. In Blackburgh, when you encounter a Cultist or Demon (hint: all the time), you move everyone else. Everyone moves whenever you fight something, so you can't count on folks to be lined up where they can help you the most. When you close Blackburgh—even when you do so temporarily—you pop over to that other weird base set location, Maze, where if you're not really smart, you'll always end up back there. So you get used to finding dead ends around Blackburgh.</p> 
               <p>Ivory Labyrinth and Lightless Maze are even more brain-melting. When you encounter one of the two types of cards that are in these location decks, you go to Blackburgh... always go to Blackburgh... never go to anywhere else other than Blackburgh. Except when you close one of these locations, in which case either you or your friends go somewhere random. Possibly to Maze or Middle of Nowhere. Maybe back to Blackburgh! You never know.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-IngerMaggor.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-IngerMaggor_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-LabyrinthMinotaur.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-LabyrinthMinotaur_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-MazeTapestry.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-MazeTapestry_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Oh, not you guys, too.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The things you encounter kick you around, too. These Minotaurs have nasty variations on the "first encounter" power seen on other Minotaurs. Now they're summoning up your favorite locations and sending your characters there. The Maze Tapestry is another bad penny, as you get to see Middle of Nowhere again and again. And so it goes. The motto of this place should just be "get lost."</p> 
               <h2>A Little Ball of Twine Shall Guide You</h2> 
               <p>So what makes all that fun? You get to puzzle your way out! You're going brain-to-brain against us. We've figured out lots of little ways to beat this dilemma—tricks with certain boons and certain banes—and we're gonna share them with you now.</p> 
               <p>Nah, just kidding. You should find them by yourselves. But hey, we wouldn't chuck you into a maze without some ways to help you get out.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-EvocationStaff.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-EvocationStaff_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Suurlahetas.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-Suurlahetas_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-IronShackles.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-IronShackles_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Probably should've put that last one in Skull &amp; Shackles.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The best way to control your destiny in this maze is not to trigger any of the disorienting things that can happen. The Evocation Staff pins monsters to the Ivory Labyrinth until you're ready to go to Blackburgh; the imprisoned devil Suurlahetas lets you snatch boons without encountering them and triggering Lightless Maze; and the item Iron Shackles holds you fast in place when one of these traps wants to move you somewhere.</p> 
               <p>And nothing is better in this byzantine world-dungeon than Baphomet's most treasured possession: a humble ball of twine. We're not sure why he loves this silver-a-dozen item so much. Maybe he killed Theseus in another life. But love it he does, which is why you steal it from him at the end of Welcome to Blackburgh.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BallOfTwine.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6025-BallOfTwine_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Wait. We steal </i>what<i> from </i>whom<i>?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>While it charges you up from pounding all these Minotaurs, Ball of Twine can get you out of Middle of Nowhere and Maze. But it can also move you <i>to</i> those places, and that can be very helpful at times. Don't want to deal with the Lightless Maze? Go to Middle of Nowhere. Heck, it's probably there already. Why not visit?</p> 
               <p>But other than those little perks, you're on your own against our devious little brains. When you finish these scenarios, we'll be saying to you, "Oh, I bet you think you're pretty clever."</p> 
               <p>And you will think just that.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Hail and well met to the Paizo community! My name is Tonya Woldridge and I am the new Organized Play Coordinator for the <a href="/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>.</p> 
               <p>I am honored to be chosen and will strive to step up and swing for the fences. The creativity of my Pathfinder Society teammates, John Compton, Linda Zayas Palmer, and Tanis O'Connor, defies words. The dedication of the "Venture Officer Corp" is the stuff of legend. Together, we are working to bring you the best campaign possible and I look forward to unveiling more over the upcoming months.</p> 
               <p>Working at Paizo is returning to my roots. I grew up in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, about 5 hours from the Paizo office, and spent 2 years at the relatively local University of Puget Sound. My extended family is dotted throughout the Pacific Northwest. I love the rain, mist, and mountains! If you want a beautiful vacation destination, the Olympic Peninsula is the best.</p> 
               <p>My gaming journey started in high school with 2nd Edition AD&amp;D. Over the years, my various home groups worked their way through Earthdawn, and 3.0/3.5. We were on the Shackled City Adventure Path when Pathfinder Beta released, and our GM (My husband, 5-Star GM extraordinaire "Crispy3ed") converted the campaign from 3.5 to Pathfinder. I went to the third PaizoCon UK and was hooked on organized play. Since then, I've been a Venture-Lieutenant in the United Kingdom, a Venture-Captain in Canada, a Gen Con HQ volunteer for the past three years, and achieved 5 Star GM status. When the Adventure Card Game released, we started with the <em>Runelords</em> box set and have continued through the next editions.</p> 
               <p>My husband is a Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force and we have 2 children. As a military spouse, my family has been fortunate enough to travel the world, spending 14 of the past 18 years living in England, Canada, and Korea. Our US posts include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. While not fluent in foreign languages, I understand Korean, German, French, and several varieties of English.</p> 
               <p>Outside of Pathfinder, I enjoy reading books across a variety of genres, with Anne McCaffrey, Sharon Shinn, George R. R. Martin, David Gross, and Diana Gabaldon all in my top 10 author list. Another hobby is researching historical methods of crafting, sewing, brewing, dancing, singing, and cooking. I have been a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism for over 20 years. This love of all things medieval led to getting a Bachelor's degree in History from the University of Maryland. I also have a Bachelor's in Asian Studies, as I fell in love with Korea when we lived there and needed to know more.</p> 
               <p>I thank the leadership at Paizo for their trust and support as we strive to bring a fantastic experience to the community.</p> 
               <p>Cheers!</p> 
               <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>

               <p>Round 4 is the last challenge contestants must face to reach the final round. We encourage voters and fans to not just read through these encounters, but consider actually playtesting them to see how they play in actual game situations. To allow time for this, voting on Round 4 won't close until Sunday, October 18. However, the contestants shouldn't be resting too much during this period, as they must consider what adventure they'll propose should they make it to Round 5 (and soon, they will receive the information needed to create a short elevator pitch to run by Creative Director James Jacobs, for pre-approval of their adventure ideas).</p> 
               <p>So check out the Top 8 encounters, see if you can get a group together to play through them, and think about which designer you want to give an opportunity to pitch an adventure to become an official part of Golarion canon!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">It's Friday, which means it's time for your (mostly) regularly scheduled preview of upcoming figures from the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line of prepainted fantasy gaming figures. Up this week are three early looks at digital sculpts for November's <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set. I should add here that while these are digital sculpts, I've actually seen and approved all of the paint masters for this set, and they look phenomenal. Because so many of our figures include stamped-on additional details (called "tampos" in the lingo of the business), I don't tend to photograph paint masters, even when I really want to. Once we begin to receive early production samples, we'll shoot several of them and show them off here. But for now, we're still looking at digitals.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">It's Friday, which means it's time for your (mostly) regularly scheduled preview of upcoming figures from the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line of prepainted fantasy gaming figures.

               <p>I've showed off a lot of the set's common and uncommon figures so far, so this week, in celebration of something special (which I'll get to below), I want to pull back the curtain on some of the set's rare figures. Our partners at WizKids always pack an amazing amount of paint and sculpt details into the rare figures, and this set is no exception. Some of my absolute favorites from the set are found at this rarity.</p> 
               <p>And so, as my favorite television scientist might say: "Awaaaaaaay we go!"</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Akkevrah.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Akkevrah_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the imposing Allevrah, Elf General, looking splendid in her green dragon skin armor. A few months back, as I was working on Pathfinder Battles set lists, my boss and Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens came by and said "Mona, put some more elves in the line. We need more elves!" I decided to fulfill that request in the form of a few figures from <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><em>The Lost Coast</em></a>, but I think Allevrah here is the coolest of the bunch. She was, in a slightly different form (NO SPOILERS) a major NPC in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness">Second Darkness Adventure Path</a>, but I think she works just as well as a major NPC ally or even a player character. There's no denying that she looks ready to kick some serious ass. Allevrah, Elf General is a Medium, rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-GoblinVulturePilot.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-GoblinVulturePilot_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up next is the Goblin Vulture Pilot, from page 109 of the <a href="/products/btpy9926"><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a> hardcover. I love the way WizKids' sculptors perfectly captured this guy's facial expression, and I can't wait to have him (literally) dive bomb my player characters. This figure looks incredible in hand, and I'm delighted to get more mounted figures into the line. Let me know if there are other mounted monsters and characters you'd like to see, and I'll try to sneak them in somewhere! The Goblin Vulture Pilot is a Medium figure at the rare rarity. (Ok, the goblin himself is Small, but the vulture is Medium and on a Medium base.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Zilvazaraat.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151002-Zilvazaraat_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last up today is one of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn's</em></a> stranger visitors, a multi-dimensional merchant of arcane wares known as Zilvazaraat. The towering planar peddler first appeared in <a href="/products/btpy8vss"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #70: The Frozen Stars</em></a>, and he was originally slated to appear as a miniature in the <a href="/products/btpy92s9"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a> set. That set (and a few others at the same time) lost about 10 figures when we went from 55-figure sets to 45-figure sets, and Zilvazaraat here has been waiting for his time to strike ever since. I figured, hey, you never know who might stop by <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> for a bit of drink and some back corner business, so he sauntered his way back into our lives. I think it's fair to say that this creature has never been made before in prepainted plastic. He's a little bit off-kilter, but he's got a gorgeous sculpt and I hope you like him. Given that he appears anywhere to buy, sell, and trade magic items, your players will probably love him. Zilvazaraat is a Large, rare figure.</p> 
               <p>With the previews behind us, I'd like to reveal some sad news to Pathfinder Battles fans. Although I tend to get a fair amount of credit for the line in public forums based on the regular appearance of this blog, the truth is that making these sets as amazing as they can be is a team effort. Over the last few years, I've been honored to include in that team Paizo's Licensing Coordinator, Mike Kenway. Mike has been an absolute workhorse behind the scenes of Pathfinder Battles, tracking down art, managing the approvals chain with WizKids, and making sure that I don't fall too behind on planning set lists and other Pathfinder Battles business.</p> 
               <p>We've got Mike to thank for the awesome <a href="/products/btpy9eo8">Bone Golem</a> from <a href="/products/btpy9bc6"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>, and numerous other figures he's championed over the years. A significant part of the line's quality and success can be attributed directly to Mike's keen eye for detail and excellent work ethic.</p> 
               <p>Unfortunately (at least for us!), Mike has accepted a job with another company, who understands how good he is at this type of thing, and what an asset he is to licensing coordination. Mike's last day in the Paizo office is next Thursday, October 8th, and I wanted to be sure to take this opportunity here in the Friday Publisher Preview to thank Mike for his tireless efforts on behalf of <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> fans. The line would not be what it is today without his hard work, and we will miss him dearly.</p> 
               <p>That said, time (and minis production) waits for no man, and the show must go on. We're currently looking for Mike's replacement to join the Paizo staff as Licensing Coordinator. Since a major part of the job involves helping me manage the Paizo side of Pathfinder Battles, I thought I'd put <a href="/paizo/about/jobs">a link to the job opening</a> here in the blog, in case some of you miniatures stalwarts might consider a change in career.</p> 
               <p>I could definitely use the help!</p> 
               <p>I'm off to New York Comic Con next week, and will try to drop a preview from the road. There's still so much awesome stuff in <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set that I can hardly believe it!</p> 
               <p>Until next time, I remain...</p>

v5748btpy959l">"Risen from the Sands"</a> were a part of the Free RPG Day promotion, along with the now-infamous <a href="/store/v5748btpy8j5v">"We Be Goblins!"</a> (and <a href="/store/v5748btpy8xc2">"Too!"</a> and <a href="/store/v5748btpy9c21">"Free!"</a>). And for our last free adventures, get in the wayback machine! <a href="/products/btpy82r0">"Hollow's Last Hope"</a> was one of the first places that introduced our world of Golarion (yes, even before <a href="/products/btpy7zkr">"Burnt Offerings"</a>) via the town of Falcon's Hollow! Another adventure <a href="/store/v5748btpy83w0">"Revenge of the Kobold King"</a> continues the mini-campaign in Falcon's Hollow, which is set after <a href="/products/btpy7yqz">"Crown of the Kobold King"</a>. Since these last adventures were made for 3.5, you may also want to take a look at the <a href="/store/v5748btpy89m6">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Conversion Guide</a>. If you're just getting started in Pathfinder and have a copy of the <a href=""><em>Beginner Box</em></a>, check out the <a href="/store/v5748btpy8q4o">first</a> and <a href="/store/v5748btpy919d">second</a> demos (not to mention the <a href="/store/v5748btpy8p2l">GM Kit</a>, <a href="/store/v5748btpy8p2k">Player Pack</a>, <a href="/store/v5748btpy8qev">Pathfinder Society Character Creation</a>, and <a href="/store/v5748btpy8uqm">Transitions</a> PDFs).</p>

The <a href="/store/v5748btpy9dgw">Faction Journal Cards</a> and <a href="/store/v5748btpy9ely">The Story So Far</a> PDFs give players a better overview of what's going on, while the <a href="/store/v5748btpy94ix">GM Star Reward Chronicle Sheets</a> gives GMs access to special rewards for running Pathfinder Society games.

               <p>Since the very beginning of Pathfinder, Paizo has allowed for fans to create and share their own material using our campaign setting of Golarion. The <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/about/communityuse">Community Use Project</a> allows for amazing resources like <a href="http://pathfinderwiki.com">PathfinderWiki.com</a>, the <a href="http://archivesofnethys.org">Archives of Nethys</a>, and the innumerable flyers and handouts made by our hard-working volunteer Venture Officers of the Pathfinder Society! I would be remiss if I did not mention the <a href="/companies/paizoFansUnited">Wayfinder fanzine</a> and <a href="/companies/paizoFansUnited">Pathfinder Chronicler</a> anthologies, one of the first Community Use Projects—and still going strong with the 14th issue in the works! If you're looking for character sheets, holy symbols, regional flags, they are available (along with a host of other things) in our <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/about/communityuse/package">Community Use Packages</a>, and if you want to make your desktop, phone, or tablet look a bit shinier, we have <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/tags/wallpapers">many, many wallpapers</a> for you as well!</p> 
               <p>Hopefully this post has illuminated you to the amazing array of resources available to you—without ever having to open your wallet!</p> 
               <p>May your next dice rolls be successful ones,</p>
