  \  </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>,\
  \ when you roll your d20, there's more than just success and failure on the line.\
  \ You can also critically succeed or critically fail at a variety of checks, from\
  \ attack rolls, to saving throws, to skill checks and beyond. Rules like these have\
  \ always been a part of Pathfinder—for example, if you fail a Climb check by 5 or\
  \ more you fall, and if you fail a Disable Device check by 5 or more you set off\
  \ the trap—but they are uncommon and not universally applied. In the playtest, we\
  \ have a unified mechanic.</p> \n     <h2>The Four Degrees of Success</h2> \n  \
  \   <p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, every check is rolled against a particular\
  \ DC. Your roll on the d20 + your proficiency modifier + your ability modifier +\
  \ all your relevant modifiers, bonuses, and penalties make up your check result.\
  \ If your check result meets or exceeds the target DC, congratulations! You succeeded,\
  \ and you might have critically succeeded. Otherwise, you failed. If you exceeded\
  \ the target DC by 10 or more, or if you rolled a natural 20 and met or exceeded\
  \ the target DC, then you critically succeeded. If your result was 10 or more lower\
  \ than the target DC, or if you rolled a natural 1 and didn't meet the target DC,\
  \ then you critically failed. Collectively, success, critical success, failure,\
  \ and critical failure are called the four degrees of success. You can gain special\
  \ abilities that increase or decrease your degree of success, often due to having\
  \ a high proficiency rank. For instance, if your class grants you evasion, you get\
  \ master proficiency in Reflex saves and treat any success on a Reflex save as a\
  \ critical success!</p> \n     <h2>Examples</h2> \n     <p>Let's start with a <i>fireball</i>\
  \ spell. In Pathfinder First Edition, if you succeed the Reflex save, you take only\
  \ half damage, and evasion allows you to take no damage on a successful save. In\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition, here are the degrees of success for fireball (and many\
  \ of its old friends like <i>lightning bolt</i> and <i>cone of cold</i>) in the\
  \ playtest.</p> \n     <ul style=\"list-style: none;\">\n      <b>Success</b> Half\
  \ damage \n      <li><b>Critical Success</b> No damage</li> \n      <li><b>Failure</b>\
  \ Full damage</li> \n      <li><b>Critical Failure</b> Double damage</li>\n    \
  \ </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180330-Weapons.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180330-Weapons_360.jpeg\"></a> \n   \
  \   <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Any character\
  \ who critically succeeds takes no damage, and characters with evasion count their\
  \ successes as critical successes. What about someone legendary at Reflex saves\
  \ with improved evasion? They count critical failures as failures and thus can never\
  \ suffer the deadliest effects of a Reflex save, even on a natural 1!</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Not all effects list all four degrees of success. If an effect doesn't list\
  \ a critical success entry, that means there is normally no special effect for critically\
  \ succeeding, so you just use the result for a success. Similarly, if an effect\
  \ doesn't list a critical failure entry, there is normally no special effect for\
  \ critically failing, so you just use the result for a failure. If a success entry\
  \ is missing, that means nothing happens on a success, and if a failure entry is\
  \ missing, that means nothing happens on a failure. Let's take a look at an example\
  \ that combines two of these rules: the results of a basic attack called a strike.</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Success</b> You deal damage, which equals the\
  \ weapon's or unarmed attack's damage dice plus your Strength modifier if it's a\
  \ melee attack, plus any bonuses.</p> \n      <p><b>Critical Success</b> You deal\
  \ double damage—you roll twice as many damage dice and add double the ability modifier\
  \ and double any other bonuses to damage. </p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Let's\
  \ unpack what this means. You deal damage on a success and double damage on a critical\
  \ success. Since there is no failure entry, that means normally nothing happens\
  \ on a failure, and since there is no critical failure entry, that means a critical\
  \ failure has the same effect as a failure, so nothing happens. But the fighter\
  \ might have something to say about that! The fighter can use the special certain\
  \ strike action, which lets him strike with the following failure effect.</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Failure</b> Your attack deals the minimum damage.\
  \ (Treat this as though you had rolled a 1 on every die.)</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>So with certain strike, a failed attack roll isn't actually a miss—\
  your fighter is so skilled that you still get a glancing blow on a failure and miss\
  \ entirely only on a critical failure! Meanwhile, a fighter with the twin riposte\
  \ reaction can use one weapon to parry and attack with the other weapon whenever\
  \ an enemy critical fails an attack roll.</p> \n     <h2>Save or Lose</h2> \n  \
  \   <p>One of the effects of the four degrees of success that adds the most fun\
  \ to the game is what this means for save or lose effects—effects where if you fail\
  \ your save, you're unable to continue the fight. These sorts of effects are tricky\
  \ in almost every roleplaying game, and Pathfinder is no exception. In Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition, even if your character has a 75% chance of succeeding at your Will\
  \ save against a mummy's paralysis, chances are pretty high that four mummies are\
  \ going to paralyze you. (Thanks a lot for that encounter in your Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario, Jason!)</p> \n     <p>It's tempting to just decide the solution is not\
  \ to have save or lose effects, but that really cuts off a wide variety of classic\
  \ feats, monster abilities, and spells from the game. The flip side of those abilities\
  \ is that if they don't just win, chances are that many of these effects are just\
  \ wasting a turn. So you either cast the save or lose spell and win, or you cast\
  \ it and waste the turn. Having those as the only two outcomes is not a great proposition,\
  \ and of course, players and GMs often maximize their DCs and saving throw bonuses\
  \ in order to tilt the outcome to their side as much as possible.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ with four degrees of success, suddenly the design space broadens significantly.\
  \ You can still suffer an effect that takes you out of the action entirely on a\
  \ critical failure, and you can completely ignore the effect on a critical success.\
  \ But on a failure, you suffer a powerful effect but not one that takes you entirely\
  \ out of the fight in one go, and even on a success, you suffer a milder effect\
  \ that is still useful for the spell's caster. For example, if you critically fail\
  \ your save against <i>dominate</i>, you are completely under the spellcaster's\
  \ control, but if you only fail, you can try to break out of the effect each round.\
  \ On a successful save, you aren't controlled, but you still lose an action on your\
  \ next turn as you struggle to fight off the mental commands, which could be a serious\
  \ problem—you might not be able to step away before casting a spell, or have time\
  \ to raise a shield.</p> \n     <h2>Some Mysterious Critical Effects</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>I'm closing out with some cool critical effects that result from critical\
  \ successes on your attack rolls or skill checks or from critical failures on your\
  \ enemy's saving throws. See if you can figure out where they come from!</p> \n\
  \     <ul>\n      <li>The creature is banished and can't return to your home plane\
  \ by any means for 1 week.</li> \n      <li>The creature takes the full collapse\
  \ damage and falls into a fissure.</li> \n      <li>The target believes the fact\
  \ for an unlimited duration.</li> \n      <li>The target's intellect is permanently\
  \ reduced below that of an animal, and it treats its Charisma, Intelligence, and\
  \ Wisdom modifiers as –5. It loses all class abilities that require mental faculties,\
  \ including all spellcasting. If the target is a PC, she becomes an NPC under the\
  \ GM's control.</li> \n      <li>The creature is pushed 30 feet in the direction\
  \ of the wind, is knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.</li> \n     \
  \ <li>You grant a +4 circumstance bonus.</li> \n      <li>Per a failure, except\
  \ the target believes that everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions\
  \ and free actions against these enemies regardless of whether they were previously\
  \ its allies, as determined by the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as normal\
  \ and will likely prefer to attack enemies that are actively attacking or hindering\
  \ it.</li> \n      <li>The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. Even\
  \ on a successful save, the target is frightened 2 and must flee for 1 round.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Your target regains Hit Points equal to 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Per a success, but even afterward, the target is too scared of you\
  \ to retaliate against you.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
