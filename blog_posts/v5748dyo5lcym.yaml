  \ forward to an exciting new year. I am sure quite a few folks gave or received\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8osv\"><i>Beginner Box</i></a> as presents\
  \ this past weekend. Inside that box, there is a flyer for Pathfinder Society that\
  \ includes a link to the website but no explanation of how to integrate the play\
  \ or rules from the <i>Beginner Box</i> into use for Pathfinder Society play.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>One of the earliest experiences I had during my first week at Paizo was\
  \ Erik Mona, our publisher, handing me the <i>Beginner Box</i> and advising me we\
  \ needed to have a guide that allowed players to create a legal Pathfinder Society\
  \ character using just the <i>Beginner Box</i> rules. As I had not seen it until\
  \ that moment, the task seemed quite daunting.</p> \n   <p>Like many of you, I had\
  \ looked forward to the release of the <i>Beginner Box</i> with much anticipation\
  \ and I liked what I found inside. I was scheduled to go to a trade show the following\
  \ week and the airplane flight gave me plenty of time to read through everything\
  \ in the box. The pawns also served as a good conversation piece for the people\
  \ seated near me on the plane between Seattle and Chicago. It was at 36,000 feet\
  \ that I started formulating ideas of what I thought should be included in a character\
  \ creation guide.</p> \n   <p>Once I was back in Seattle, I posted a list of ideas\
  \ and solicited suggestions from the Pathfinder Society Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants.\
  \ We brainstormed a good bit about what I had missed that should be included or\
  \ what I had placed in it that should be taken out. We worked at the phrasing of\
  \ sentences, brainstormed several more times about missed ideas, and finally arrived\
  \ at the finished free product. The guide provides a step–by–step walkthrough of\
  \ the Pathfinder Society character creation process while referring you back to\
  \ the Hero’s Handbook. These instructions allow for a seamless transition from the\
  \ <i>Beginner Box</i> to Pathfinder Society play. A special thank you goes out to\
  \ Boston Venture-Captain Don Walker for his incredible amount of wordsmithing that\
  \ went into the final document.</p> \n   <p>If you have any questions, especially\
  \ if you are new to Pathfinder and Pathfinder Society, please visit the Pathfinder\
  \ Society messageboards. Our Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants are more than\
  \ happy to answer any questions you might have, whether they are about how to find\
  \ a local Pathfinder Society game or about how some rule works that is found in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a> but not in the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8osv\"><i>Beginner Box</i></a>.</p> \n   <p>If\
  \ you have never experienced Pathfinder Society, I encourage you to make a New Year’\
  s resolution to give it a try. If you can’t find a game in your area, there are\
  \ options for play-by-post Pathfinder Society sessions. If you are a veteran of\
  \ the campaign, I look forward to working with you in 2012 to make Pathfinder Society\
  \ even better than it is now.</p> \n   <p>Happy holidays everyone!</p> \n   <p><a\
