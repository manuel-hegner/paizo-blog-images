  \ we here in Seattle gear up for what we hope (and expect) will be a fantastic Super\
  \ Bowl victory for our heroes on the Seattle Seahawks this weekend, the weather\
  \ has taken a slight turn for the better. It's a bit difficult to believe, but I\
  \ can actually see sunlight outside my office. But all it takes is another cold\
  \ day, and we'll be back into the dreariness of winter in Washington state, where\
  \ the line between rain-slicked highways and icy death-slides is only a few cold\
  \ degrees.</span></p> \n    <p>To celebrate the cold (and all of the icy driving\
  \ this week from Southerners in non-Super Bowl states), I thought I'd focus today's\
  \ preview blog on a substance near and dear to the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>: ICE.</p> \n    <p>Today's miniatures all come\
  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic\
  \ gaming figures, which is scheduled for a May release.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_IceElemental_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_IceElemental_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is the somewhat serpentine Small Ice Elemental,\
  \ whose statistics appear on page 114 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 2</i></a>. The figure is cast in clear blue plastic, with some light\
  \ blue and white highlights to create a sort of \"ice armor\" affect along the body.\
  \ The Small Ice Elemental is a Small, common creature.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_IceGolem_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This Ice Golem is a humanoid automaton created from\
  \ ice and given life through alchemical science. The creature's statistics appear\
  \ on page 161 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>,\
  \ where he comes in at CR 5, making him one of the more survivable golem encounters\
  \ in the book. The figure stands about 7 feet tall (relatively speaking), and is\
  \ cast in clear plastic. This Medium creature is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p>\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ice Trolls are somewhat smaller than normal trolls,\
  \ but they possess greater intelligence and are just as voraciously hungry. This\
  \ Male Ice Troll looks like he stepped right off page 271 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i></a>. He's a little bit shorter than the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91lq\">Sea Troll</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</a> set. This Large figure is slated at the uncommon variety.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_IceTrollFemale_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_IceTrollFemale_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Every ice troll deserves a mate, so we\
  \ decided to mix things up a bit in this set and provide just that. This Female\
  \ Ice Troll is an amazing-looking figure, definitely one of my favorite trolls we've\
  \ done to date. Interestingly, while compiling art reference for this figure we\
  \ discovered that the artist had originally given her sort of claw-like toes in\
  \ the originally published image, whereas the official ice troll from the Bestiary\
  \ had more-or-less regular toes. So we changed her feet to match his, and I'm thinking\
  \ it's that certain something special that will make sure the two of them get along\
  \ famously. They'll probably want to eat your PCs alive, though, so please do be\
  \ careful around them.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week! Come back in seven\
  \ days for more exciting <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> previews!\
  \ In the meantime, please consider setting up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a> to make sure you don't miss a\
  \ single figure!</p> \n    <p>Until next week, I remain,</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br\
