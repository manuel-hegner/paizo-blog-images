  >When setting out to write <a href=\"/products/btpy9wzs?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Taldor-the-First-Empire\"\
  ><em>Taldor, The First Empire</em></a>, I found myself presented with a circumstance\
  \ unlike any that I had previously undertaken: round up everything we've ever said\
  \ about the nation of Taldor in the 10 years the Pathfinder campaign setting has\
  \ been around, put all of that into a single cohesive document, make sure it's exciting\
  \ and inspirational for readers, and lay the groundwork for a Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path campaign that will take place entirely within the nation and deal with the\
  \ inner workings of its government and long history. But if anyone could do it,\
  \ I told myself in true Taldan fashion, it was me. Right?</p> \n     <p>The first\
  \ major challenge was determining what tone we wanted to present Taldor with going\
  \ forward, in part because we've been less than consistent on it in the past. Some\
  \ sources made it out to be more like the Byzantine Empire, complete with laws dictating\
  \ who could have a beard, while other sources described the court of Louis XIV,\
  \ with nobles so incompetent that they couldn't even spell their own names correctly.\
  \ The problem isn't with either presentation, but rather with the fact that there\
  \ are a lot of fans of both sides of Taldor.</p> \n     <p>I spent much of PaizoCon\
  \ 2017 chatting with the community about what they wanted out of the book, what\
  \ they liked about Taldor, and what never seemed to make sense to them. The development\
  \ team held a series of meetings wherein we broke down our own views of the nation\
  \ and what we needed from it in the future, from NPCs, locations, and events to\
  \ seed into the campaign setting for forthcoming adventures to even larger meta-plots.\
  \ Then I took all of that and used it as a guideline when combing through the myriad\
  \ bits we'd said about the Inner Sea's greatest nation to construct what would become\
  \ the book itself.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92105-Grogrisant.jpg\"\
