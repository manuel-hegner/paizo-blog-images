  date\">Sunday, April 22, 2007</p> \n   <p>Once upon a time, I was running one of\
  \ my favorite adventures, <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, for my players. They messed\
  \ up good, got split up, and ended up all being dominated by a certain vampire charged\
  \ with guarding a certain hammer. Now, I didn't want to admit I had a TPK on my\
  \ hands, so I took a cue form another favorite adventure, \"The Mud Sorcerer's Tomb,\"\
  \ and introduced a whole ancient society of primeval necromancers over the span\
  \ between game sessions, and next time we gathered, I had the now-dominated PCs\
  \ sent by their new vampire lord to release the first of several slumbering wizards\
  \ from a forgotten age. They let one out, but then escaped their charm and spent\
  \ the rest of the campaign trying to undo what they'd done. But the idea was too\
  \ cool to let my players fix. They defeated one of the ancient wizards, but once\
  \ one woke up, the others came back in a chain reaction. Today, my world has several\
  \ new nations ruled by these reborn necromancers, all because back in college a\
  \ few friends of mine blew their saving throws. </p>\n   <p>And now, that fateful\
  \ happenstance extends to <i>Pathfinder</i>. The ancient Runelords of Thassilon\
  \ have developed into their own unique force, but they certainly owe their conception\
  \ to that fateful day deep under the game's most famous volcano. Reproduced below\
  \ are some of my notes on the nature of the Runelords and Thassilon. Warning for\
  \ those who plan on playing in the Rise of the Runelords campaign: serious campaign\
  \ spoilers ahead! </p>\n   <h2>The Runelords</h2> \n   <p>In the first <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ blog post I mentioned how we needed to build a new region to set Rise of the Runelords\
  \ in. In fact, it's more complicated than that. We actually had to create TWO regions.\
  \ The first of these is Varisia, the realm in which the new Adventure Path takes\
  \ place. The other is Thassilon, the ancient empire that once sprawled across much\
  \ of this corner of the world. An empire that was, at its height, ruled by seven\
  \ powerful wizards known as Runelords. </p>\n   <p>Thassilon was a sprawling empire\
  \ that covered an area about as large as the western half of the United States.\
  \ The Runelords were maniacal arcanists who used magic to fuel their own decadent\
  \ vices. They forged alliances with dragons and enslaved giants by using secrets\
  \ of rune and glyph magic stolen from the aboleths. With their enslaved giant armies,\
  \ the wizards of Thassilon built massive tombs, enormous magical constructs, and\
  \ staggering monuments that survive today, mute testimonies of a mysterious age\
  \ long past. Yet as all evil empires must, Thassilon fell. The reason for this fall\
  \ remains a mystery, but as the end drew near, the seven Runelords retreated into\
  \ the depths of their greatest monuments, entombing themselves with orders for their\
  \ minions to release them later to reclaim their empire. Alas, Thassilon's minions\
  \ were enslaved or slaughtered. No one was left to waken them, and so the wizard\
  \ kings of Thassilon slumbered for countless ages. Virtues of Rule, Sins of Magic\
  \ </p>\n   <p>At Thassilon's dawn, the Runelords held that wealth, fertility, honest\
  \ pride, abundance, eager striving, righteous anger, and well-deserved rest were\
  \ the seven virtues of rule—rewards that one could enjoy for being in a position\
  \ of power. But the Runelords soon abandoned the positive aspects of these traits,\
  \ instead embracing greed, lust, boastful pride, gluttony, envy, wrath, and sloth\
  \ as the rewards of rule. Today, long after the fall of Thassilon, the original\
  \ seven virtues are held as the great mortal sins, although only a few scholars\
  \ who have studied ancient Thassilon know of their true sources. </p>\n   <p>The\
  \ Runelords' magic was closely tied to these seven categories, to such an extent\
  \ that they developed their own schools of magic. All of the Runelords were specialist\
  \ wizards. They recognized seven schools of magic (lumping divination magic into\
  \ the universal school), and each school was associated with one of the seven sins.\
  \ A Thassilonian wizard selected one sin when he became a specialist, and that determined\
  \ his prohibited schools, as detailed below. </p>\n   <p><b>Envy</b> <br>Focused\
  \ on the suppression of magic other than your own. <br><i>Specialty</i>: abjuration\
  \ <br><i>Prohibited Schools</i>: evocation and necromancy <br> <br><b>Sloth</b>\
  \ <br>Focused on calling agents and minions to perform your deeds for you, or used\
  \ magic to create what you needed as you needed it. <br><i>Specialty</i>: conjuration\
  \ <br><i>Prohibited Schools</i>: evocation and illusion <br> <br><b>Lust</b> <br>Focused\
  \ on using magic to control and dominate others to force them to satisfy your desires,\
  \ and in the control of other creatures' minds, emotions, and wills. <br><i>Specialty</i>:\
  \ enchantment <br><i>Prohibited Schools</i>: necromancy and transmutation <br> <br><b>Wrath</b>\
  \ <br>Focused on the destructive powers of magic, and the use of magic to channel\
  \ destructive forces. <br><i>Specialty</i>: evocation <br><i>Prohibited Schools</i>:\
  \ abjuration and conjuration <br> <br><b>Pride</b> <br>Focused on using magic to\
  \ perfect your own appearance and your domain through trickery and illusions. <br><i>Specialty</i>:\
  \ illusion <br><i>Prohibited Schools</i>: transmutation and conjuration <br> <br><b>Gluttony</b>\
  \ <br>Focused on the use of magic to manipulate the physical body in order to maintain\
  \ an unending thirst for continued life. <br><i>Specialty</i>: necromancy <br><i>Prohibited\
  \ Schools</i>: enchantment and abjuration <br> <br><b>Greed</b> <br>Focused on the\
  \ use of magic to transform things into objects of greater value or use, and for\
  \ the enhancement of the physical self. <br><i>Specialty</i>: transmutation <br><i>Prohibited\
  \ Schools</i>: enchantment and illusion</p> \n   <h2>The Big Bad End Guy</h2> \n\
  \   <p>Although Rise of the Runelords touches upon many different aspects of the\
  \ ancient empire of Thassilon and its evil rulers, we knew from the start that we\
  \ wanted to focus on one Runelord as the main bad guy for the campaign. Not only\
  \ is it better to have a single villain for PCs to obsess over and hate, but by\
  \ leaving the other six Runelords more or less undeveloped, we're leaving lots of\
  \ room for further expansion to this Adventure Path and our campaign setting as\
  \ a whole. We also knew that, in order to realize his evil plot, this Runelord would\
  \ be harvesting the souls of creatures that had succumbed to his favored sin. </p>\n\
  \   <p>But still—which sin to pick? </p>\n   <p>Wrath seemed like the obvious choice,\
  \ because who can't get behind an explosion-launching bad guy who has fire for blood\
  \ and lightning for hair? (That's probably a little over the top, but you get the\
  \ idea.) Wrath certainly fit well with the giants we wanted to use, but it broke\
  \ down when you applied the themes to the second adventure, which requires a group\
  \ of murderers who are murdering prominent citizens. If we went with wrath, they'd\
  \ just be killing themselves off. </p>\n   <p>So then we looked at lust. Also a\
  \ great sin to build a villain off of, and it certainly works well with the second\
  \ adventure in a Jack the Ripper sort of way. But then we get back to our giants.\
  \ These guys are huge menacing brutes. Not really known for being sexy and what\
  \ not. So lust was out the window too (though it shows up in the GameMastery module\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiz\">Seven Swords of Sin</a>). </p>\n   <p>That was\
  \ when we hit upon greed. With the Runelord of greed, we had a big bad end guy who\
  \ had a built-in way to tempt and gain his minions; he was filthy rich. Giants are\
  \ certainly easy to see as greedy, and having our murderers stalking and killing\
  \ merchants and politicians (and maybe even adventurers like the PCs!) worked perfectly.\
  \ It also gave us some interesting options when designing his look. Gemstones embedded\
  \ in his knuckles and forehead! Tattoos made out of gold! And if we do our job right,\
  \ and our Runelord of greed ends up being a really effective villian, you get to\
  \ see the looks of worry on your players' faces when, at the end of the Adventure\
  \ Path, you remind them that there are six more Runelords still out there. Runelords\
  \ associated with far more violent sins than greed… </p>\n   <p>And that's how we\
  \ ended up with Karzoug, Runelord of Greed, becoming the first megavillian of <i>Pathfinder</i>.\
  \ That's him up near the top of this page. He's lookin' pretty good for a guy who's\
  \ probably over a thousand years old, eh? </p>\n   <p>James Jacobs <br><i>Pathfinder</i>\
