  alt: "This is an urban scene of a high-tech city built by machines, for machines.\
    \ There are towering structures and a wide variety of robots, from huge to tiny,\
    \ flying or walking around. The sky overhead is just space and stars (no atmosphere).\
    \ The city is very clean and orderly, but in a way that caters specifically to\
    \ robots."
