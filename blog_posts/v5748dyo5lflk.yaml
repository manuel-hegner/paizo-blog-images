  \ office as folks are working ahead to ensure that everyone can get their products\
  \ on time even as the diligent editors, developers, graphic designers, and others\
  \ look forward to taking a little time off. I spent much of last week outlining\
  \ and assigning scenarios, and you should be seeing the product pages going up soon.\
  \ Here's what to watch for:</span></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>January</b></p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>#5–12: Destiny of the Sands, Part 1: A Bitter\
  \ Bargain </i>(Tier 1–5)<br> <i>#5–13: Weapon in the Rift</i> (Tier 5–9)</p> \n\
  \     </blockquote> \n     <p><b>February</b></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>#5–\
  14: Day of the Demon</i> (Tier 3–7)<br> <i>#5–15: Destiny of the Sands, Part 2:\
  \ Race to Seeker's Folly</i> (Tier 1–5)</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p><b>March</b></p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>#5–16: Destiny of the Sands, Part 3: Sanctum\
  \ of the Sages</i> (Tier 3–7)<br> <i>#5–17: Fate of the Fiend</i> (Tier 7–11)</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Yes, that's right; the third\
  \ scenario in the three-part series is actually one tier higher than those that\
  \ precede it. This is the first time that we've jumped tiers during a named series,\
  \ and there are very important in-game reasons for Part 3 being the level range\
  \ that it is. Don't worry about having to play the three scenarios one after another,\
  \ though; there are no plans to include a reward for consecutive play. Of course,\
  \ there is something else that makes this series particularly special, but I won't\
  \ spoil that just yet.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, it's back to development. I\
  \ want to make sure that everyone has the December scenarios to enjoy over the holidays.</p>\
