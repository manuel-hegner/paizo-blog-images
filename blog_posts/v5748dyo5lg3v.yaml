  \ Preview: Lost &amp; Found</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, May 9, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">With\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set scheduled for release\
  \ next month and the last three figures from that set being previewed last Friday,\
  \ it's time for a very special event here on the Friday preview blog—it's time to\
  \ reveal the next set!</span></p> \n    <p>I'm very pleased to announce that the\
  \ next set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted plastic gaming figures will be <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><b>The\
  \ Lost Coast</b></a>! The Lost Coast of Varisia stretches from the city of Magnimar\
  \ to the mighty Fogscar Mountains. It's a wild and desolate country full of lingering\
  \ fogs, small woodlands and crashing waves. It's also a land of cultists and bandits\
  \ and monsters of all description. Many an adventuring party has travelled to the\
  \ Lost Coast seeking fame and riches, never to be heard from again...</p> \n   \
  \ <p><a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> set contains 45 figures,\
  \ and is scheduled for a November 2014 release. The set is not based on a specific\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>, like <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> or <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</a>. Rather, the creatures in this set take their inspiration\
  \ from the wealth of Pathfinder products released to date, with a special focus\
  \ on creatures native to Varisia, home of several of our Adventure Paths and some\
  \ of our most popular releases across all our product lines.</p> \n    <p>Expect\
  \ to see a wide variety of monsters, heroes, and humanoids culled from these sources.\
  \ We'll fill in some gaps for encounters based on existing <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> figures, and flesh out some entirely new monster types we\
  \ have not yet produced in the line.</p> \n    <p>I'm very excited by this set.\
  \ For the first time in a long time, we were able to build an entire set around\
  \ simply which creatures and images would look coolest, and which would be useful\
  \ to the largest number of players. Adventure Path-themed sets are great and lead\
  \ to some really unique figures that we otherwise would probably not do, but with\
  \ sets like <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a>, it all comes down\
  \ to table use and illustration quality, period.</p> \n    <p>Oh, and the Gargantuan\
  \ case incentive, the mighty <a href=\"/products/btpy96k7\">Shemhazian Demon</a>,\
  \ is face-meltingly awesome. I don't want to spoil things by bragging about it before\
  \ we show the image (which isn't quite ready yet), but you guys are going to freak\
  \ out when you see this hideous creature. It's the biggest—and heaviest—Pathfinder\
  \ Battles figure produced to date. Given that people have been asking for this creature\
  \ since our second set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ I am happy to finally provide it.</p> \n    <p>But, as I am wont to do, I'm getting\
  \ ahead of myself. The <a href=\"/products/btpy96k7\">Shemhazian</a> will get his\
  \ place in the spotlight in due time. In the meantime, let's take a look at three\
  \ of the set's \"troop builder\" units—the Cult of Lamashtu.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LamashtuCultist_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LamashtuCultist_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have a Lamashtu Cultist, inspired\
  \ by the art from the first 12 issues of Dynamite Entertainment's <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics</a>. The cultist is depicted holding a bubbling cup of magical\
  \ liquid—the mystical waters of Lamashtu so pivotal to that series and to events\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path</a>. This figure in particular is drawn from art by original Pathfinder\
  \ comics illustrator Andrew Huerta, so the face in particular is a little more expressive\
  \ than in several of our other figures. I love it. This guy is definitely unhinged.\
  \ The Lamashtu Cultist is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LamashtuThug1_500.jpeg\">\
  \ <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LamashtuThug1_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>A cultist ain't nothing without some muscle\
  \ to back him up. This set contains two examples of the sort of armed scum that\
  \ make a cult work. Lamashtu Thug 1 is good for up-close work with a couple of nasty\
  \ daggers and a domino mask, just as we saw in <a href=\"/products/btpy8xs4\">Pathfinder\
  \ Comics #7–8</a>. As a Medium common, you can combine this figure with the other\
  \ minis in today's preview to build a really sweet battle against agents of the\
  \ cult of Lamashtu. For that matter, this guy easily doubles as a bandit, highwayman,\
  \ or even a masked player character.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LamashtuThug2_500.jpeg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LamashtuThug2_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  > </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Lamashtu Thug 2, here, is ready to back up his team\
  \ with his trusty crossbow. His colors match the robes of his companions. There's\
  \ a bit of wash-out on the photos here that makes the robes look a little less detailed\
  \ than they do in hand. When all three of these guys stand together they look really\
  \ imposing and awesome. The Lamashtu Thug 2 is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n \
  \   <p>And that's not all. The set also includes a few other figures that work in\
  \ concert with the Lamashtu cultists, including leaders and monsters—but we'll get\
  \ to them in future weeks, as their paint masters have not yet been completed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As I mentioned, these figures take their inspiration from Dynamite's\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\">Pathfinder\
  \ Comics</a>. We're about to start up a new Pathfinder comic series, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9474\">Pathfinder: City of Secrets</a>, which brings the iconic characters\
  \ to the city of Magnimar (on the Lost Coast, naturally). All issues of the new\
  \ series contain detachable poster maps, and the first one comes out in just a week\
  \ and a half, on Wednesday May 21st. You can <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">set\
  \ up an ongoing subscription</a> to the comic to make sure you don't miss a single\
  \ issue. With a hot new artist, poster maps and Pathfinder RPG encounters in each\
  \ issue, and a fun urban storyline, I expect the new series to sell well and rapidly.\
  \ Make sure you don't miss out!</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week. We'll have\
  \ much, much more to say on this set and many more figures to preview in the weeks\
  \ to come!</p> \n    <p>We'll see you on the Lost Coast!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br\
