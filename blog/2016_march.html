               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Chapter 1: The Scholar's Murder<br> <i>Jheraal</i></h2> 
                <p>Birds cared nothing for murder.</p> 
                <p>Sweetly they sang from the branches of the fig and lemon trees that wreathed the grounds of Vaneo Celverian, the city manor of proud, ancient House Celverian. Under the elegant tile roofs and gilded balustrades, all might be in panic, but nothing disturbed the birds among their sun-dappled leaves. They sang and sang, bright as joy, while down below, mortal men and women struggled to grasp the enormity of loss.</p> 
                <p>They'd suffered a staggering one, Jheraal knew. Master Othando Celverian, second and favored son of Lord Abello Celverian, heir to his house and hope of his family's future, had been murdered in the night. Others had been killed, too, but in Cheliax, only one of those deaths really mattered.</p> 
                <p>Out on the grand lawn, a semicircle of maids, grooms, cooks, and washerwomen in white and gold-slashed blue stood where they'd been turned out for her inspection. Every one of House Celverian's servants was a picture of shock and grief. The younger maids held handkerchiefs to their tear-puffed eyes, while the older servants muttered about what they'd do when they found their master's killer.</p> 
                <p>Both the sobbing and the plotting died abruptly when Jheraal rode into the servants' view. One did not cry before Hellknights, and one certainly did not conspire to commit crimes. A sullen hush fell over the Celverian household as Jheraal's chestnut destrier trotted across the graveled path, coming to a halt before the chief steward.</p> 
                <p>He was a tall man, spare and elegant and silver-haired, and although Jheraal was framed against the sun, he looked up into its full glare without blinking. "Sir?"</p> 
                <p>"I'm here to investigate the murders." Jheraal removed her fearsome, devil-visaged helm, allowing the servants to see her face.</p> 
                <p>It caused a stir, as she had known it would. House Celverian's people were well trained, and other than a gasp from one of the youngest grooms and a few tightened mouths and half-steps backward, none showed an overt reaction to her appearance. But Jheraal read their shock all the same.</p> 
                <p>The hellspawn taint ran strong in her. Jheraal's skin was white as snow and covered with fine, soft scales, each one edged with a faint shimmer of copper. A pair of four-inch horns, curved and sharp as a goat's, poked through her bronze-streaked black hair. They fitted into the hollows of the horns in her helm, and had indirectly served as inspiration for the same.</p> 
                <p>It was not unheard of for the devil-blooded to serve among the Hellknights, but neither was it common. In Cheliax, hellspawn were widely considered to be no part of proper society, and few of them received the training in arms or spellcraft needed to gain acceptance into the Hellknight orders' ranks. Yet here she was, armored in the scarred breastplate and horned helm that marked her as a full Hellknight sworn to the Order of the Scourge.</p> 
                <p>The chief steward, a consummate professional, tipped his head downward in an extremely correct nod, affording Jheraal precisely the degree of courtesy that her status warranted. "It is our honor. Should we be expecting any of your associates?"</p> 
                <p>As he spoke, his eyes flicked to the star of bleeding lashes painted on Jheraal's shield. That was the Scourge's sigil, and the steward's unspoken query was clear: <i>Will the Order of the Rack be coming?</i></p> 
                <p>It was a delicate question. The Hellknight Order of the Rack, based in Citadel Rivad near Westcrown, was the primary order of Hellknights in the city. Jheraal's order, the Scourge, was less well known and much less strongly represented, which was both advantage and disadvantage: it gave her greater independence, but fewer resources to call upon.</p> 
                <p>Less currency with the common people, too. As Westcrown had long been troubled by rumblings of dissent, Her Imperial Majestrix, Queen Abrogail Thrune II, had granted the Order of the Rack wide-sweeping authority to detain, question, and even execute suspected rebels in the city.</p> 
                <p>And although the Order of the Rack held the preservation of peace to be its highest duty, the methods it chose to achieve that duty were not always peaceful. In much of Westcrown, the order had a fearsome reputation. Few Wiscrani were glad to see them coming.</p> 
                <p>House Celverian, Jheraal recalled, might have more reason than most to be wary where the Order of the Rack was concerned. There had been some trouble with the eldest son, who'd gotten caught up in the idealistic fervor of the young. He hadn't been accused of any serious wrongdoing, and his father's influence had hushed any whiff of scandal, but nevertheless the boy had been sent packing to a crusader's exile in Mendev.</p> 
                <p>That had been years ago. Well over a decade, in fact. But fear could take a long time dying, and Jheraal couldn't blame the servants of House Celverian for being cautious.</p> 
                <p>"The Order of the Rack has no part in this investigation," she said. Some of the servants relaxed visibly at her words. Out of long habit, Jheraal noted their faces, as well as those of the servants who didn't blink at all. "The dottari will assist in whatever capacity they can, but they will not send a separate investigator. In this matter, I serve both the throne and my order. All of us wish to see your master's killer brought to justice. You have my condolences for your loss."</p> 
                <p>"We are grateful for your kindness. I have the honor of being Belvadio, chief steward of this house. Lord Abello Celverian should be arriving late tonight or early tomorrow. In the meantime, the household staff is at your disposal." The chief steward clapped his hands, signaling the end of the assembly. In a flurry of curtseys and bows, the maids, cooks, and house servants dispersed. Jheraal dismounted, and one of the grooms led her horse away. Two servants, a pair of boys who looked no older than fourteen, remained behind at the steward's signal.</p> 
                <p>"Achio and Tirol were the first to discover the... the... what had been done," Belvadio said, clearing his throat. "They found Nappandi, one of our guards, lying in the hedges and came together to wake me a little after midnight. I hastened to wake the young master, and that is when we found him. Master Othando had been murdered in his study, where he was accustomed to read nearly until dawn. There are still two servants unaccounted for. We have not found their bodies, but I fear the worst." The chief steward took a breath, quavering only slightly. "Where would you like to begin?"</p> 
                <p>"Show it to me as you found it." Jheraal had no reason to doubt the steward's honesty, but if there were any gaps in his story, she expected that it would be easiest to find them by walking alongside Belvadio and seeing whether the evidence matched his words.</p> 
                <p>"Of course. Please, this way." With a courtly bow, Belvadio led his armored guest through the gardens' fragrant shade toward the honeysuckle-threaded hedges that encircled the vaneo. Overhead, the birds continued their merry, oblivious song.</p> 
                <p>Although House Celverian's main seat lay in the hinterlands, and its manor in Westcrown was not as grand or expansive as the sprawling estates called vira, it took several minutes for them to reach the bloodstained spot by the walls where Nappandi's body had been found.</p> 
                <p>There wasn't much blood. Only a few brownish drops, already mostly soaked into the earth, and a patch of crushed clover near the base of the hedges where the body had lain. In the darkness, screened by the dense thorned shrubs, it might have been a long time before anyone noticed a body at night.</p> 
                <p>Jheraal crouched and looked for tracks that might have been left by the killer, but found none. Either Nappandi's assailant had known how to hide them, or the servants had already trampled out those traces.</p> 
                <p>She straightened with a clanking of steel and leather. "Your guard kept a regular patrol?"</p> 
                <p>"Yes. Every hour on the hour. Nappandi was extremely diligent. He would never have missed a round, nor been a minute late on his circuit."</p> 
                <p><i>Predictable, then. Easily evaded.</i> The lack of struggle suggested that the killer had never been seen. He could have slipped by if he'd wanted, but instead he'd chosen to kill the guard.</p> 
                <p>"Was anything taken from his body?" Jheraal asked.</p> 
                <p>"Yes. A ring of keys. Nappandi had keys to most of the vaneo, other than the master's private rooms and the wine cellar. That was the only thing I could see that was stolen. Do you wish to examine the body?"</p> 
                <p>"Later. Show me where you went and what you did after you found him."</p> 
                <p>Belvadio glanced at the two boys behind him. They hung back nervously while Jheraal examined the blood-speckled grass. "After Achio and Tirol told me what they'd found, and I had confirmed with my own eyes that this was no prank, we went together to inform the master. I also sent word to the captain of our household guard that there was a murderer at large in the vaneo."</p> 
                <p>"How many guards do you have?"</p> 
                <p>"Four." The steward grimaced, shaking his head. "Three, with Nappandi dead. But none of the others saw whoever did this."</p> 
                <p>Jheraal nodded. Three household guards were unlikely, in her estimation, to present much difficulty for someone who could kill one of their number so easily and silently. That they had seen nothing meant little. There was no need to insult their honor by saying so, however. "Show me to Master Celverian's study."</p> 
                <p>"At once." With another neat bow, Belvadio strode toward the manor, the two younger servants trailing him like puppies. A few steps from the servants' door, he hesitated. "Do you wish to follow precisely the same path we took? These halls are... not grand enough for guests, I fear. I would not wish to cause any insult."</p> 
                <p><i>He is worried about offending the Hellknights.</i> Belvadio's concern about ushering her through the servants' door might have been reasonable if he'd been dealing with the touchiest of high Chelish lords, but she had no illusions that a steward who'd spent his entire life in service to a great house really believed that her rank was so exalted, or her skin so thin. This was caution and nothing but.</p> 
                <p>Jheraal snorted. "I'm not a duchess, Belvadio. I won't be insulted by walking through the service door. Just show me where you went."</p> 
                <p>"Forgive my presumption." Producing a ring of keys from some unseen pocket inside his blue coat, Belvadio unlocked the door and stepped aside to hold it open. "The young master's library will be up the stairs and to the right."</p> 
                <p>"Lead on."</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8532-Cover.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8532-Cover_500.jpeg"></a>
                 <br><i>Illustration by Jason Rainville</i>
                </div> 
                <p>He took her past the larder and buttery, through the kitchens, and up a flight of well-worn wooden stairs. No footprints stood out here, either.</p> 
                <p>At the top of the stairs, they reached the discreet little door that separated the servants' quarters from the nobles' halls. Quilted padding covered the servants' side of the door, insulating their superiors from any unwanted noise or smell that might drift up from the kitchens. The other side of the door, Jheraal noted, was painted white and adorned with gilded scrollwork. All the unsightliness—and all the function—was on the servants' side.</p> 
                <p>Although the servants' halls had been lit only by the daylight that streamed through their small, cloudy windows, enchanted lights shone serenely along the ceiling and upper walls of this corridor. Wide picture windows overlooked the manor's gardens, while carpets in faded blue and white sank under Jheraal's booted feet. The carpets were lush at the periphery but worn in the centers. That they hadn't been replaced suggested that House Celverian wasn't as rich as it had been in years past. No surprise. Failing fortunes were common among the old nobility that had declined to align strongly enough with House Thrune.</p> 
                <p>Nevertheless, it was lovely. The airy beauty of the upper hall was marred only by the faint whiff of blood that grew stronger as they approached an open door on the right.</p> 
                <p>"In there," Belvadio whispered. The color had drained from his face.</p> 
                <p>They hadn't moved the body. The mortal remains of Othando Celverian remained in the overstuffed armchair where he had presumably died. A linen sheet covered his slumped form imperfectly, trailing over part of the desk in front of him. A carafe and half-full wineglass rested on a silver tray near his elbow. Papers spilled across the floor by his side, along with a fallen candle stub trailing a comet's tail of wax spatters.</p> 
                <p>Jheraal stepped forward to examine him, taking care not to disturb the papers. "This is all as you found it?"</p> 
                <p>"Almost. There was... a cleric came before you. Udeno of Abadar. He looked over the master and said there was nothing he could do. Other than his examination, and the sheet I placed over the master, nothing has been touched."</p> 
                <p>The Hellknight nodded without looking up. With as much delicacy as she could muster, she lifted the sheet that covered Othando Celverian.</p> 
                <p>He had been a young man. Twenty-five, she guessed. Maybe a year or two to either side. Slim, handsome, with the soft hands and pale skin of a scholar who spent little time outdoors. Drying blood spilled from a single deep puncture wound on the side of his neck and darkened his sleeping robe in a crooked fan that widened as it stretched toward the floor. More blood painted the carpet behind him and to the side, and a single brownish-red fingerprint smudged his right arm near the elbow.</p> 
                <p>Othando's own hands were clean. That bloody fingerprint had come from someone else.</p> 
                <p>His face was buried in the pages of the book he'd been reading. When Jheraal lifted Othando's head, she saw that his eyes were wide and his lips slightly parted. The breeze from an open window fluttered dark blond hair across his brow. She couldn't tell if he had been talking, trying to cry out, or just gasping for breath in his last extremity, but it seemed that he'd been looking at someone when he died. The spill of blood from his wound suggested that he had turned toward, and then away from, something or someone at his back.</p> 
                <p>The killer? It was tempting to conclude that Othando must have seen his assassin. If he had, his shade might answer a cleric's prayer and identify his attacker.</p> 
                <p>Jheraal had been an investigator long enough to know that such hopes almost always proved futile. Something as simple as a mask or hood sufficed to prevent recognition, as every professional killer knew, and the dead were blessed with no more knowledge than they'd had in life. The Hellknight had worked on dozens of murders in the twelve years of her investigative career, all across Cheliax and its vassal states, and never once had she seen the spirit of an assassin's victim able to identify his killer. Amateurs might be named by the dead. Professionals never were.</p> 
                <p>That didn't mean she had no use for magic. Only that its use had to be less easily anticipated by her target.</p> 
                <p>She glanced at the open book. Drying blood gummed its pages and darkened the illustrations, but the lettering remained clear. It looked to be a collection of Taldan heroic stories—disgraced knights winning back the honor of tarnished houses, second sons and valiant daughters carving names for themselves in savage lands, heroes who vanquished monsters and won the love of their people. Tales to stir excitement into a quiet life.</p> 
                <p>The letters that had blown onto the floor appeared to be correspondence: invitations to various social events from other Wiscrani nobility, orders from his lord father at the family estate, and an unfinished letter from Othando himself to his exiled brother in Mendev.</p> 
                <p>Drawing the sheet back over the body, Jheraal stepped sideways to examine the desk. Two of the drawers were partly opened. One held signets in gold and bronze, sticks of sealing wax, unsharpened quills, a paring knife, and a wrinkled paper sachet of sugar-rolled mints. The other was empty save for a few faded stains at the bottom. The remaining drawers were locked.</p> 
                <p>She motioned to the desk. "Was anything taken from here? Or from Master Celverian himself?"</p> 
                <p>"I cannot be certain," Belvadio admitted. "The master's study was private. I did not notice anything stolen, but some small theft might have escaped my notice."</p> 
                <p>"How busy would the household have been at that hour?"</p> 
                <p>The steward took a moment to think it over. "We had no guests at the vaneo, and no entertaining planned for the next few days. Other than one or two of the under-cooks in the kitchen and the guards making their rounds, everyone should have been sleeping. Achio and Tirol were out only because they were making mischief."</p> 
                <p>"Was it Master Celverian's custom to leave that window open?" Jheraal gestured to the skylight, although she already knew the answer. That window was too high to be opened without the aid of a ladder, and she had seen none in the study.</p> 
                <p>Belvadio frowned, confirming her guess. "Pleasant as the weather is, no. The master was concerned that nothing should damage his books—not rain or sun or snow. The window was only to admit light to assist his reading. He never opened it."</p> 
                <p>"You said there were two other servants missing?"</p> 
                <p>"Chiella and Nodero." The steward fidgeted with a button, then caught himself and stopped, smoothing his coat. "Chiella was here when I sounded the alarm. I saw her with my own eyes. No one recalls seeing Nodero after he retired to his room last night. Both were gone by the time I found the master, or soon after."</p> 
                <p>"Do you believe they might have played some role in this?"</p> 
                <p>Belvadio shook his head vehemently. "Impossible. No one loved House Celverian more than Nodero and Chiella. Their loyalty is beyond question."</p> 
                <p>"You're sure of that? How?"</p> 
                <p>The silver-haired man exhaled. With a quick, uncomfortable glance at Jheraal, he said: "House Celverian has always been adamant that everyone in its service is to be dealt with fairly, as fits each person's talents and disposition, and that no one is to be slighted on account of their ancestry." Belvadio's eyes flickered to the carpet, avoiding her, on the word "ancestry."</p> 
                <p>The missing servants were hellspawn, then. No other reason for that discomfort. And not everyone on the staff was as accepting as their master had been, judging from the reception she'd gotten on the lawn.</p> 
                <p>"Those who offend this policy are dismissed without references, which is a death sentence for employment among the great houses. The young master, like his father, was an uncommonly enlightened man, and he was fiercely beloved by all who had the good fortune to serve him. It is inconceivable that either Chiella or Nodero would ever have done anything to hurt him, or to damage the honor of his house."</p> 
                <p>"As you say." It sounded like burnishing the virtues of the dead to her, but perhaps Othando Celverian really had been a saint among men. "I'll visit the church of Abadar to speak with the cleric who examined Master Celverian, and then return to the Order of the Rack's garrison. Please send word when his father, Lord Celverian, arrives in Westcrown."</p> 
                <p>"Of course." He followed her back out of the manor, keeping always two paces behind and a half-step to the side, like the most discreet of ghosts. As they reached the servants' door, however, the steward took a small step forward.</p> 
                <p>"Truly," he said, dropping his reserve for a moment and letting her see the real anguish beneath, "I don't believe Chiella or Nodero could have had any part in this horror, let alone both of them together. Never. In my bones, I know they are innocent. But I do believe someone might try to use them to discredit their kind. Not everyone approved of the master's views on hellspawn, and some of the servants I was forced to dismiss might seek revenge for their disgrace."</p> 
                <p><i>No servant could afford to hire an assassin with that much skill.</i> They might have aided in the killer's plots, but they couldn't have been the driving force. "Did he have enemies among the nobility?"</p> 
                <p>"The young master? No. He was being courted by some of the lesser houses with marriageable daughters, but as yet he had chosen none, so no one had reason to be insulted by his refusal. He had no position at court and no place in political schemes, and his hobbies were harmless. Master Celverian was a dreamer and a scholar. He was no threat to anyone."</p> 
                <p>"What about the rest of his house?"</p> 
                <p>Belvadio opened the door. Outside, the sun was a glory and the birds were singing, and Westcrown's life went on. Even within the vaneo's walls, the rhythms of the day were returning. A washerwoman pinned damp sheets to her lines. Across the yard, a stocky, freckle-faced boy carted muck from the stables. Already, the night was beginning to recede in their memories.</p> 
                <p>"Their mistakes are in the past," the steward said, returning Jheraal to the city.</p> 
                <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
                <p>The cleric of Abadar had little to tell her. Yes, he had gone to the vaneo that morning. Yes, he had seen Master Celverian's corpse. No, he had no suspicions regarding how the murder might have been carried out, nor about who would have had a motive to strike at House Celverian's younger son.</p> 
                <p>"It's what they do, isn't it?" Udeno shrugged. "The courts are snake pits. No surprise when one gets bitten by a viper."</p> 
                <p>Jheraal hadn't argued, but as she walked down the temple's steps back into the canal-lined streets of Westcrown's Rego Sacero, she'd thought, <i>Not like this</i>.</p> 
                <p>It was true that the Chelish nobility spent an inordinate amount of time plotting against each other, and that espionage and assassination were well-used weapons in their arsenals. But it was also true that blatant, barefaced murder was considered extremely bad form.</p> 
                <p>Cheliax prided itself on being a nation governed by law. Its killers might disguise their doings as hunting accidents, food poisoning, or highway robberies gone wrong. The more cunning and ambitious might even go so far as to trump up criminal charges and let the royal executioners take their enemies' heads.</p> 
                <p>But they <i>did</i> disguise their murders, because otherwise they invited the full wrath that Cheliax visited upon all those who broke its laws.</p> 
                <p>The assassination of a well-born scholar in his study was precisely the sort of crime that offended Her Imperial Majestrix and insulted her rule. That it had happened in Westcrown, which chafed at its loss of prominence under House Thrune and needed little provocation to stoke its smoldering discontents into new flame, made the investigation more urgent. And that the victim had been an eligible young bachelor who was actively courted by several Wiscrani houses added an edge of intrigue. Jheraal guessed that there were several furious dowagers who were eager to learn which of their rivals might have destroyed their daughters' prospects.</p> 
                <p>For all these reasons, it was exceedingly important that she find the killer.</p> 
                <p>No one had said this, of course. Not explicitly. The mere fact of her assignment made it clear enough. Jheraal was of the Order of the Scourge, and she had been chosen to investigate a crime in a city where the Order of the Rack held sway. There were any number of messages bound up in that, but the key one was that Her Imperial Majestrix expected results. Failure was not to be countenanced. That was why Jheraal, of all the investigators available to the Hellknights, had been singled out and sent to serve. The Queen wanted answers, and Jheraal was meant to find them.</p> 
                <p>The obvious course was to question Lord Celverian. But the lord hadn't yet arrived in Westcrown, so Jheraal returned to Taranik House, the Order of the Rack's base of operations in the city, to see whether any messages had come.</p> 
                <p>There was one. The courier, a towheaded halfling boy, was standing in the foyer and filling his satchel with new missives when Jheraal arrived. He dropped the packet he was holding and waved excitedly when he saw her. "Jheraal! Hellknight Jheraal!"</p> 
                <p>Jheraal raised a hand to calm him. "What?"</p> 
                <p>"I have a message of utmost urgency. Utmost! From Durotas Tuornos. His rundottari found bodies in Rego Cader. Two from House Celverian. The durotas said you'd want to know immediately. Here—he wrote this for you, but it only says the same thing." The boy held out a folded slip. It had been hastily written. The ink soaked through the cheap paper.</p> 
                <p>"He was correct." The Hellknight took the letter, gave it a cursory look, and put her horned helm back on. Rego Cader, the long-abandoned Dead Sector of the city, was infamously perilous, full of thieves and murderers and worse. Even the dottari, Westcrown's city guard, didn't like to linger in those blighted ruins. Rego Cader was so dangerous that it had its own division of the guard—the rundottari, or "ruin wardens"—dedicated exclusively to holding back the threats that proliferated in that sector. "Bodies, you said. Where, exactly? Are they still there?"</p> 
                <p>"I don't know." The halfling said, fumbling to pick up the packet he'd dropped, "but Durotas Tuornos is on the Obrigan Gate. He hoped that you would hurry. He hoped, also, that you would send word to the capital. For a wizard."</p> 
                <p>"Why? Aren't there enough wizards in Westcrown?"</p> 
                <p>"I don't know." The boy shook his head in helpless confusion. He closed his overstuffed bag and went to the door. "The durotas didn't tell me, not really. All he said was that there was magic in this. Deviltry. And... " he swallowed, "and that the dead might not be dead." </p>

               <p>First of all, I would like to thank everybody for participating. There was a lot of really excellent entries, encompassing 29 different iconics, and all of them different enough from each other that I had a hard time choosing our finalists! Kyra the Cleric was the top favorite, with six different variations, followed by Jirelle the Swashbuckler, and all of the entries avoided the moustache-twirling evil that we try and avoid in our own antagonists. Well done, everyone! Let's get our runners-up out of the way, who will each earn $10 in store credit for their entries!</p>

               <p>But, as one of my cult favorite shows (and movie) says, there can be only one, and the winner is <strong>meloriel</strong> with a version of <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijm&amp;page=3?Am-I-Evil#126">Lini the Druid</a>. With a pretty universal reaction of " D: " among the staff that read the entry, this Lini embraces the darker, crueler aspects of nature.</p>

                <div class="stat-block"> 
                 <p class="stat-block-title">Lini the Cruel—CR 3</p> 
                 <p class="flavor-text" style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 1em;">After being viciously mauled by a snow leopard and left for dead by her Enclave, Lini managed to escape the beast with her life—barely. Horribly scarred and angry at both her kin and the beast, Lini treated her wounds as well as she could and bided her time, stalking the snow leopard over the course of days and learning its habits while using stealth and her magic to hide from its senses. Eventually Lini struck, sneaking into the snow leopard’s lair while it was out, killing all of its cubs and then beating the beast into submission (with heavy use of poisons). She turned the cubs pelts into a cloak, their teeth and claws into jewelry and spent the next two years breaking the snow leopard, viciously training it into her loyal defender. Now, she and Droogami stalk the lands as bandits and mercenaries, inflicting violence for coin and the sheer joy of it.</p>

                   <p class="stat-block-breaker">Tactics</p> 
                   <p><strong>Before Combat</strong> Lini applies poison to her weapons daily or before engaging enemies (using blue whinnis only when she intends to take someone alive). If she knows she will be fighting in a building or facing multiple enemies she casts <em>call animal</em> and handles or <em>charms</em> the animal as necessary at least an hour before approaching. Once prepared, Lini stalks her prey from afar studying them (with studied target) and her surroundings before approaching. She uses stealth and the terrain to her advantage, hiding behind or atop of buildings, trees and other obstacles. Before fighting she casts <em>barkskin</em> and <em>bull’s strength</em> on herself.</p> 
                   <p><strong>During Combat</strong> If Lini has called an animal to her side she directs the animal first, typically pushing it to enter the building and attack everyone inside or to attack a large group of enemies. She does not expect the animal to survive such tactics and does not make any effort to save or assist it. After the animal is unleashed or, if there is no called animal, Lini and Droogami stalk as near to their targets as they can without being spotted, from opposite directions. Lini studies her target and attacks from hiding with one of her poisoned weapons or <em>stone discus</em> while Droogami fights in melee combat. Once enemies are aware of her presence Lini prefers to fight in close ranged combat with her darts or <em>produce flame</em> using Acrobatics to remain mobile. If the terrain provides potential cover she utilizes skirmishing tactics, breaking line of sight with her enemies, stealthing to a different location and attacking again from hiding to gain her sneak attack damage. Once personally engaged in melee combat Lini fights with her sickle, flanking with Droogami at all times. If wounded, Lini temporarily retreats from combat leaving Droogami to continue the fight, heals herself with her <em>wand of cure light wounds</em> and then returns to combat (preferably unnoticed). Lini takes the time to cure Droogami if he is below half of his hit points, but only if doing so won’t cause her any harm. She will not put herself in danger for Droogami.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Morale</strong> Lini values her life above all others and will happily sacrifice anyone, including Droogami, to protect herself. Unless Lini orders otherwise, Droogami fights to the death to protect her. If Lini is reduced to half of her hit points she retreats to heal herself while Droogami continues fighting. Once she is healed, if Droogami still lives, Lini reenters combat, otherwise she flees using acrobatics and stealth to her advantage and hiding if necessary.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Last week, a bunch of us attended the GAMA Trade Show, the hobby game industry's annual spring showcase event. I did a few interviews there, including this one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVc9uQIg3Vs#t=19m00s" target="_blank">noted Pathfinder ACG fan Eric Summerer of the Dice Tower</a>, where I lead off with some information on <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li5d"><em>Mummy's Mask</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> before launching into other stuff Lone Shark Games is doing.</p> 
               <p>Going to GAMA always makes me reminisce, because it was four years ago almost to the day when I walked into GAMA 2012 with a wine box containing a humble prototype called "Saints" under my arm. Lead Developer Chad Brown and I had whipped up a set of cards based on a concept by me and my friend Rian Sand. It carried with it a modern horror story, but fundamentally it could work with any sufficiently adaptable story-based property. We weren't sure what we were going to do with it, but we resolved that we would know that by the end of the show. My first meeting was the one I wanted to work out the most, with Paizo's Erik Mona and Jeff Alvarez.</p> 
               <p>Across the table in my hotel room, I said something like, "Now, this game isn't Pathfinder. But you guys are smart enough to know what it would look like if it was Pathfinder." After playing for an hour, Jeff and Erik looked at each other and—after a bit of uncomfortable silence where they figured out who was gonna talk first—Erik said, "This is amazing. We have to talk to Vic and Lisa, but I think we want to do this."</p>

                <br>Cover Image for the <em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em>
               </div> 
               <p>A week later, our team had a plan to make a game with our friends at Paizo. It would require a year of investment as we rebuilt the game to work with the richest set of material we could imagine. The game expanded in its reach: Originally designed to scale from low-level metahuman to moderate-level metahuman, now it had to scale from fresh-faced cub adventurer to near-godlike titan of sword and sorcery. The stories would be big, based on Paizo's vaunted <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath">Adventure Paths</a>. And we picked probably the biggest story we could right out of the gate: the modern classic <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>. This set would take Chad's personality: expansive, complex, and all-inclusive.</p> 
               <p>By the GAMA Trade Show of 2013, Chad, Gaby Weidling, Paul Peterson, Tanis O'Connor, and I had finished design on the <a href="/products/btpy951a"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a>, edited by Vic Wertz and Judy Bauer, and made into a real-looking game by Sarah Robinson and her team. I showed up to GAMA with a pre-production copy—the <i>only</i> pre-production copy. Sales savant Cosmo Eisele and I tucked ourselves in a tiny room in the top floor of the conference center at Bally's. I mean, it was no bigger than the interior of a VW Beetle. We showed the game to distributors and retailers five at a time at a nonstop clip. At this point, we guessed we had a pretty good game. Maybe a minor hit with people who'd stopped playing the Pathfinder RPG. Maybe bigger, if the cards broke right.</p> 
               <p>I think you know how that went. To our surprise, the <a href="/products/btpy951a"><em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a> blew the walls off Gen Con 2013, becoming the number one hit of the show. It was a vastly bigger reaction than we imagined we'd get. Most interestingly, only a small portion of the game's fan base had ever played the Pathfinder RPG, or for that matter any RPG. What Paizo and Lone Shark created was a new genre, if only we managed to get more of it done.</p> 
               <p>As we came home from Indianapolis, our teams agreed we needed to make another base set that could show off some more tricks that the system could perform. We settled on the pirate-themed <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>—and were already two months late on our design. With ships and sharks galore, this would become Gaby's set: rollicking, inventive, challenging to figure out. Emblematic of the set was our first promo character, the highly popular goblin <a href="/products/btpy96ie">Ranzak</a>.</p> 
               <p>To make our lives more difficult, we also began a line of seven <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks">Class Decks</a> that would allow for a new style of organized play. What that style of organized play would become was anyone's guess. Tanis hopped over from Lone Shark to Paizo to figure that out. What emerged was the groundbreaking Season 0 of the <a href="/pfsacg">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>. Season of the Shackles was Tanis's "set": adventurous, clever, mildly strange <i>[also winning and fun at parties—Tanis]</i>. I don't mind saying that we barely knew what we were doing, but it worked. People came out in droves to play with strangers at conventions and retail shops.</p> 
               <p>By GAMA 2014, we had picked up some new friends along the way. UltraPRO created <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/accessories">a line of boffo accessories</a>, including playmats, deck boxes, and deck protectors. WizKids gave us <a href="/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">six sets of miniatures</a> in which we embedded promo cards for all our iconic characters. And DriveThruCards constructed a fantastic <a href="http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder" target="_blank">community card creator</a> so that all our fans could make their own cards.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the Lone Shark team grew. We added designers Liz Spain and Keith Richmond to the club right as we were developing <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. GAMA 2015 saw the release of Paul's set: gigantic, intricate, over the top. Everything that could happen in a PACG set happened here: army battles, mythic power, retainers, characters introduced midway through the adventure path. Wrath had no limits.</p> 
               <p>We continued pounding away at the corners of the game with three new waves of Class Decks, now available in a <a href="/products/btpy9ewj">monthly subscription</a>. We followed up Season of the Shackles with a new tier system for <a href="/pfsacg/products/season1">Season of the Righteous</a>, written by Keith, Tanis, and I. And Tanis introduced a whiz-bang new format for tournaments at Gen Con: the <a href="/blog/v5748dyo5lhtk">PACG Open</a>.</p> 
               <p>Oh, and there was <a href="https://pathfinder.obsidian.net" target="_blank">this cool thing from Obsidian</a>, developed in collaboration with us. Pathfinder Adventures is the digital realization of everything that's cool about PACG, without any of the less cool fuss and bother of setup and cleanup. You'll get it in just a few weeks.</p> 
               <p>By GAMA 2016, we were closing the books on <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li5d"><em>Mummy's Mask</em></a>, which became Liz's set: crafty, historical, just a little insane. The team also started work on wave 5 of the class decks, bringing our total of developed class decks to a mind boggling 20 decks. (You don't know yet what #19 and #20 are. Stay tuned.) By GAMA 2016, adding together all the sets, expansions, class decks, guild adventures, accessories, and miniature sets, we were almost at 100 different things we'd designed or approved for PACG. It's a very big game with a whole lot of ways to play.</p> 
               <p>All that in four short years. More soon, I promise, including what we hope will be Keith's set in 2017. It's been a fun ride, so thanks for coming along!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Like the Pacific Northwest, the Gloomspires off the west coast of Garund both see their fair share of precipitation and experience predictable periods of pleasantly navigable weather (okay, perhaps I'm being a little unfair, as Seattle is positively gorgeous in time for <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>). A team of Pathfinders recently returned to the Gloomspires to explore Sevenfingers' tomb, but Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry—illustrated here for the first time—has heard nothing from them since. Fearing they are in need of aid, she has asks the PCs to mount a rescue in <a href="/products/btpy9k92"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-19</em>: "Labyrinth of Hungry Ghosts"</a> by Tom Phillips. As in <a href="/products/btpy9986">last season's visit to the Gloomspires</a>, Tom has created an adventure rich in atmosphere and steeped in thematically wowing danger. One of my favorite elements of the Gloomspires is that they're Tom's creation, dating back to his 2012 RPG Superstar submission, meaning he has been able to take an especially active role in presenting the site and unveiling its secrets. Linda and I hope you have as much fun playing through them as much as we developing them.</p> 
               <p>I would also like to recognize Sean Macdonald, who has handled the majority of the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild's</a> custom maps for several years. He does great work overall, yet Linda and I were especially impressed with the visual impact of his cartography for this assignment.</p> 
               <p>Not all getaways need transpire in the nigh-inaccessible locales, as our third and final installment in the Faithless and Forgotten series shows: <a href="/products/btpy9huz">"The Infernal Inheritance"</a>. An ally of the Society has disappeared, and the Pathfinders have traced him to one of the cruelest facilities in Ostenso: a prison known as the Bloody Nail. Fortunately the Society has the local expertise of the halfling Tamrin Credence, an expert in planning heists and getting out alive. He can get the PCs into the facility, but from there its up to them to evade the security, find the captive, and escape one of Cheliax's most militarized cities. <a href="/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar</a> 2015 finalist Christopher Wasko has composed a great heist with lots of options for a wide range of PCs—a fitting conclusion to this three-part series that contains several big secrets.</p> 
               <p>In parting, remember that Tonya and I are appearing on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com" target="_blank">Know Direction podcast</a> on April 6th to answer questions about future campaign developments, including the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lil4">upcoming seeker arc</a>. We hope to see you there!</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">This week I've got two figures from October's <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, the next set of prepainted plastic <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> gaming figures! This week's choices allow me to show off figures tied to one of my favorite features—clear plastic.</p> 
               <p>When it comes to things like invisible creatures and flames, clear plastic offers a verisimilitude that's very difficult to achieve even with a well-painted miniature. Try as I might, I can never blend orange, yellow, and red well enough to really "sell" it as fire, but when clear plastic comes into the picture, things get considerably more "realistic."</p> 
               <p>I've loved several clear figures from the past of the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> range, from the flaming pole-arm of early experiments like <a href="/products/btpy8sfg">High Lady Athroxis</a> to all-out classics like the elementals from the <a href="/products/btpy8v0b"><em>Shattered Star</em> set</a>. <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> continues the tradition, with a significant number of creatures that employ clear plastic effects sure to drop your jaw.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-InvisibleGuardian.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-InvisibleGuardian_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the Invisible Guardian, an incredibly versatile figure that can double as a dungeon stalker or any kind of incorporeal undead. The Invisible Guardian stands a bit taller than your average adventurer, and it's ready to sneak up and do some stranglin'. The Invisible Guardian is a Medium, common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Hellcat.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Hellcat_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Also today we've got the Hellcat, one of my favorite sculpts from the <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set. If previous <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures like the <a href="">Hell Hound</a> from <a href="/products/btpy8v0b"><em>Shattered Star</em></a> are any indicator, this guy is going to turn out wonderfully. Even better, it's a Large figure, so I expect the juxtaposition between bone and fire is going to look fantastic. The Hellcat is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <p>I hope you agree that both of these figures are "clearly" great choices for your game table! I'll be back next week with a look at some more figures from <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>! </p>
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

            <p itemprop="description">As a GM, one of the things I love about the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</em> is that it allows you to play out any story you can imagine in the fantasy world within. But when those stories have fewer physical combats and more scheming, infiltration, persuasion, and other types of intrigue, the rules don’t have your back as solidly as they do for combat, so a GM, like me, who ran lots of those plots had to do a lot of improvisation. In <a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>, we present both subsystems and advice for players and GMs alike to sink their teeth into an intrigue game and all sorts of fun challenges they might find therein.</p>

               <p>First up, we have two influence systems, one for gaining influence with particular characters at an event to pursue a goal, and another for gaining influence and power within an organization. Next, the Heists section shows you how to build and play a fun heist and get started with some "Ocean's Elven" style action. The leadership section shows how to modify leadership for a variety of types of leader or follower that break the standard assumptions and how to tie leadership into all the other subsystems, as well as presenting an enormous chart of potential monster cohorts from all five Bestiaries, with some adjusted cohort levels that reflect either disruptive abilities or relative lack of options in an intrigue game (for instance, stone giant is much lower now, but the hound archon with its at-will <i>greater teleport</i> is much higher). The nemesis subsystem helps with creating and managing of various nemeses of the PCs, including increasingly drastic options a nemesis might take once she has fixated on the PCs as a thorn in her side. Pursuit offers a long-term version of a chase where the whole group works together to overcome the challenges of the terrain and catch up to an NPC, escape an NPC, or beat an NPC in a race to a crucial site. The research subsystem helps in roleplaying the challenge of discovering hidden lore, based on the system from <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/mummysMask"><em>Mummy's Mask</em></a> but adding a bunch of fun twists, like monsters or traps tied into the research progress. Spells of intrigue is an advice section on some of the most common spells in an intrigue game and how they fit into the world of intrigue without cracking it wide open (including their limitations, countermeasures, and so on). This section includes advice on adjudicating charms and compulsions, illusions and what counts as interacting, divinations, and more! </p> 
               <p>The social conflicts section is in some ways a centerpiece for the various subsystems, as it addresses directly how to put together a social conflict with various stakes and contenders like you might see in <em>Game of Thrones</em> (including an example social conflict where fey changelings are instigating a class war between the common folk and the nobility). Verbal duels are battles of wits and words where each duelist chooses various tactics to try to defeat their rival and impress the crowd. For instance, the allegory tactic is a good opening tactic, but telling a story isn't great in the middle of a fast-paced exchange, baiting tries to goad your opponent into responding with a penalty, mockery is great if your opponent is on the ropes with the crowd, and red herring lets you escape a tense situation by starting a whole new argument). Lastly, the skills in conflict section provides a variety of advice for the skills most often used against each other, like the social skills, Perception, and Stealth, filling out some of the skill descriptions from the <a href="/products/btpy88yj"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a> with more expansive rulings and advice. We've got advice in here for dealing with situations like:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>bluffing with a party</li> 
                <li>true lies and implausible truths</li> 
                <li>the aftermath of a bluff</li> 
                <li>bluffing someone who has already been bluffed in a different way</li> 
                <li>requests are not mind control</li> 
                <li>roleplaying and social skills</li> 
                <li>calling for a cease-fire</li> 
                <li>when disguise is opposed</li> 
                <li>seeing through an illusion that augments a disguise</li> 
                <li>two sides each attempting to Intimidate the other</li> 
                <li>explaining negative consequences to someone who doesn't like you without using fear tactics</li> 
                <li>active and automatic Perception</li> 
                <li>precise and imprecise senses</li> 
                <li>cover and concealment for Stealth</li> 
                <li>states of awareness (unaware, aware of presence, aware of location, and observing)</li> 
                <li>hunches with Sense Motive</li> 
                <li>Sense Motive is not mind reading</li> 
                <li>and more!</li>
               </ul> 
               <p><a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> is the toolkit that will let you bring all sorts of new styles of adventure to your gaming table, or enrich your games if you were already throwing those kinds of plotlines and adventures at your PCs. I can't wait to hear what sorts of stories of intrigue you tell using this book!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">By now, <a href="/products/btpy9j74"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Faiths</em></a> has shipped out to friendly local game stores and subscriber mailboxes everywhere, giving you details on some of the lesser-known gods of the Inner Sea—and a couple of them really bug me!</p> 
               <p>Bug me in the best possible way, of course. Achaekek and his Red Mantis assassins first showed up in as part of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a> (which we'll be happily returning to <a href="/products/btpy9kg6">this fall</a>), and I've had a fondness for them ever since their debut. I'd tell you where Ghlaunder and some of these other gods might show up in an adventure, but that might be a bit too spoilery (although it's not much of a spoiler to say that some of these cults would prefer to stay hidden). On to more art previews for <a href="/products/btpy9j74"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Faiths</em></a>!</p>

                <p>Before we jump into your regularly scheduled blog, we have the following message to relay from Obsidian:</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the chance to explore Sandpoint and defeat the Runelords, and we're sorry to keep you waiting just a little bit longer: We're moving the launch day for <a href="https://pathfinder.obsidian.net/" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Adventures</em></a> to April 26.</p> 
                 <p>The good news is why the game is being delayed: during beta testing over the last couple of weeks the community has given us a ton of feedback on everything from visual polish to card balance and general gameplay. We want to evaluate all of the ideas and address as many as possible before launch, and that process is going to take a little bit of time.</p> 
                 <p>Ultimately, we hope you all agree that the result will be a better <a href="https://pathfinder.obsidian.net/" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Adventures</em></a>, just at a sliiiiightly later date.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">We're just laying down the final versions of the <em>Mummy's Mask</em> promo cards this week, which reminds me that we have more promos to talk about! <a href=" /pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes Set #6</a> has just been released, complete with an extra miniature <i>and</i> an extra promo card. (See? Don't say we never gave you nothin'.)</p> 
               <p>Here's a look at the promo cards in <a href="/products/btpy9fyt">Set #6</a>. As a reminder, these cards have the Owner trait, meaning the character whose name is on the card can treat it as a Basic card.</p> 
               <h2>Some Cards from Iconics that Already have ACG Character Cards...</h2> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-SliverFlute.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-SliverFlute_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-ElvenScimitar.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-ElvenScimitar_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-Daji.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-Daji_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Daji's card could have been named "Red Fox," but then I wouldn't stop shouting "I'm coming to join you, Elizabeth!"</i>
               </div> 
               <p>People have been saying "Where's Lem?" since <a href="/products/btpy98sw">Iconic Heroes Set #1</a>. There's this thing where we could only get one small mini into each set, and we wanted to make sure that Biter and... screw it, the important thing is that he's finally here.</p> 
               <p>And he brought his flute! The Instrument trait first appeared on Oloch's <a href=" /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie0">Orc War Drum</a>, but has since migrated into <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> and other decks. Basically, it means that you're gonna add 1d4 to other people's checks in some way—in other words, it'll make you a bit like a Bard. But if you're <i>already</i> a Bard, you get to add that d4 to everything anyone does that turn. <i>Everything.</i> Lem + Flute = popular.</p> 
               <p>Our favorite emo magus gets a shiny bent scimitar. Since he's just as concerned with spells as swords, Seltyiel can use it to pick up spells and then fling them back later.</p> 
               <p>Feiya has two cards in this set, including Daji the fox. Feiya's trick, both in the <a href="/products/btpy92zk"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Character Add-On Deck</em></a> and the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9icp"><em>Witch Deck</em></a> revolves around recharging cards to reduce the difficulty of checks. Daji's great for many a spellcaster due to the Intelligence and Wisdom bumps, but when it's Feiya, suddenly she's reducing difficulty by 6 or 7 all the time. Pretty dodgy, if you ask me.</p> 
               <h2>... And Cards from Iconics that Don't have Character Cards Yet</h2> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-InvestigatorsLamp.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-InvestigatorsLamp_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-ShinobiShozoku.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-ShinobiShozoku_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>I swear there was some armor around here a minute ago.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>We haven't released playable versions of Quinn the Investigator, Hayato the Samurai, or Reiko the Ninja yet. But their <em>Iconic Heroes</em> cards are useful even without their owners.</p> 
               <p>The investigator's main gimmick is peering into dark places. Just as Holmes has his magnifying glass, Quinn has his lamp. Anyone can use it to peek at cards and clear out barriers. When Quinn shows up, he'll be doing that a lot.</p> 
               <p>Reiko's black ninja armor is loaded with hidden weapons. Don't have a need for armor right now? <em>Voop</em>, it's a Hand Crossbow. Or a Dragon Pistol. Or in Reiko's case, maybe it's a Kusarigama. Just the kind of thing your shadowy figures would need in a pinch.</p> 
               <p>So that's Set 6. We get asked a lot, "Will there be more Iconic Heroes sets?" WizKids is still contemplating the answer to that, but we sure hope so.</p> 
               <h2>And Speaking of Promos...</h2> 
               <p>This year's <a href="http://freerpgday.com" target="_blank">Free RPG Day</a> is June 18, and we've got another goblin character coming your way. We're not gonna say much about him for a little while, but here's Tup the Terrible!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/Tup-Token-Back.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/Tup-Token-Back_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Tup-Token-Front.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Tup-Token-Front_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Oh, one more thing: He has a sheep named Deliverance.</i>
               </div>

Today, we bring you more sanctioned content for your enjoyment both at and away from the gaming table!</p> 
               <p>One of my favorite projects is sanctioning the <a href="/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales</a> novels, which continue to impress me with the authors' insight into our shared campaign setting, fun characters, and subtle incorporation of game mechanics into the narratives. This latest round of reading began with Michael A. Stackpole's <a href="/products/btpy8xth"><em>The Crusader Road</em></a>, a story of frontier survival in the River Kingdoms, and concluded with Tim Pratt's <a href="/products/btpy9ckd"><em>Liar's Island</em></a>, a tale of mischief, humor, and opportunistic heroism in Jalmeray. If you're a fan of the Darklands—especially if you enjoyed the recently released <a href="/products/btpy9j6s"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Shadows</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9j72"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Darklands Revisited</em></a>—you'll love <a href="/products/btpy9dz2"><em>Forge of Ashes</em></a> by Paizo's own Josh Vogt, who shows us how cool an oread can be and how delightfully bizarre the Darklands' residents are. Check out both Pathfinder Tales, Volume VI and Pathfinder Tales, Volume VII for all eight of the newest sanctioned novels.</p> 
               <p>On a related note, remember that <a href="http://www.audible.com/mt/Pathfinder" target="_blank">Audible</a> now produces audiobook versions of the Pathfinder Tales novels, letting you experience the stories wherever you go. Our partnership with TOR also means that these novels are available in ebook form through a variety of online retailers. In light of the new digital formats available, showing a GM the audiobook or ebook file on your phone, laptop, or even printed out screenshot now qualifies for activating any of the Pathfinder Tales boons.</p> 
               <p>But that's not all! Linda has also composed the sanctioning document for <a href="/products/btpy9au7"><em>Pathfinder Module: Daughters of Fury</em></a>, opening up new adventure content for character levels 2-6. As with many of our sanctioned 64-page modules, this adventure is broken into three chapters, each with its own Chronicle sheet. Play the whole adventure with the same character to qualify for a bonus Chronicle sheet at the end, helping to either boost your PC's Prestige Point total or gain additional experience points and wealth.</p> 
               <p>You can download all of the sanctioning document files from their respective product pages. These documents will be added to the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources">Additional Resources page</a> next week, along with the rest of the monthly update.</p> 
               <p>We're busily looking ahead to other sanctioned content in the Module, Adventure Path, and Tales lines, so don't worry if you don't see the next publication's Chronicle sheets here; they're in the pipeline. We'll see you next week for a preview of March's new scenarios.</p>

I'm writing to you today from the floor of the GAMA Trade Show, the game industry's annual convocation of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers in lovely Las Vegas, Nevada.

               <p itemprop="description">Greetings, everyone! I'm writing to you today from the floor of the GAMA Trade Show, the game industry's annual convocation of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers in lovely Las Vegas, Nevada.

You may not have seen the great news about Pathfinder miniatures, however, so I wanted to carve out some time from my busy convention schedule to bring you up to speed.</p> 
               <p>Our partners at WizKids, who have already produced nearly a dozen sets of prepainted plastic <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> releases, announced on Tuesday that they are launching a brand-new line of <i>unpainted</i> plastic miniatures based on their two popular fantasy miniatures licenses—Pathfinder and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, along with some original unbranded dungeon scenery!</p> 
               <p>In all the new unpainted figure line will launch with more than 150 unique sculpts, and is scheduled for a fourth-quarter 2016 release. All of the figures will come fully assembled, and will be pre-primed with Acrylios Vallejo primer, some of the finest-quality hobby paint available. The figures will come in a few different configurations:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><b>Hero Packs</b> will contain both a low-level and a high-level sculpt of the same character, such as the Pathfinder iconic hero Valeros, pictured below.</li> 
                <li><b>Monster Packs</b> will contain 1–3 miniatures with different versions of the same type of monster (for example, goblins, orcs, etc.).</li> 
                <li><b>Item Packs</b> will contain scenery and items (treasure chests, traps, furniture and the like) for detailing adventures.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Each pack will be priced from $2.99-$3.99, depending on the size and number of figures included.</p> 
               <p>I had a chance to review early versions of these figures in hand at the show, and I think you will all be blown away by the enhanced sculpting process WizKids will be using, which highlights minute elements and includes deep cut surface details and scaled features for easier hand painting.</p> 
               <p>Take a look at the quick photos I took of Valeros on my iPhone to get a sense of how cool these will look. Much more detailed photos will appear here in the weeks to come.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160318-Valeros1.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160318-Valeros1_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160318-Valeros2.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160318-Valeros2_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>The launch of WizKids new unpainted figure line will not impact either of Paizo's two existing miniatures lines, <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> from WizKids and <a href="/pathfinder/miniatures/reaper">Pathfinder Miniatures</a> from Reaper. As the new figures will use completely new sculpts and poses, there should be very little overlap with existing figures, though it's safe to assume that some familiar faces are certain to appear in the new line.</p> 
               <p>Also at the show, I revealed two more digital sculpts from the forthcoming <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, scheduled for an October release.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Look out! It's a Cockatrice! He nips you with that nasty beak of his and you're sure to be turned to stone. The Cockatrice is a Small, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Doppelganger.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Doppelganger_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Look out! That friendly NPC you picked up a few dungeon rooms back isn't friendly at all—it's a Doppelganger! The Doppelganger is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <p>Lots more to reveal in the weeks to come. Keep your eyes on this space for more exciting Pathfinder miniatures developments!</p> 
               <p>Until the stars are right, I remain...</p>

            <p itemprop="description">The Brilliant Planner feat lets you make a fund that you can use to pull out the item or resource you need in a particular situation, which can be pretty useful in clutch situations. The fighter gains several new combat feats that enhance his bravery (both against all mind-affecting effects and against social attacks like feint and demoralize) and even allow him to share his bravery with nearby allies. Legendary influence lets mediums choose one feat for each legend and accept influence to gain the feat they chose when they channel that legend (so you can pick things that only help you with one legend, like Selective Channel for hierophant, which has channel, Arcane Armor Training for archmage, and so on). Feats like Subtle Enchantments are great for manipulating others (in this case, it makes it harder to notice the target is enchanted with Sense Motive and gives a 50% that a target who succeeds on the save doesn't notice it had to make a Will save). The three new styles are Fox Style, which lets high-Int characters master feinting, dirty tricks, and the like, Owl Style allows martial characters to use their fighting skill to maneuver around the battlefield fluidly, and Street Style lets urban characters create combo attacks using the environment around them.

               <p><a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> has plenty of feats, spells, and magic items that help your character get herself into all sorts of trouble—and out of trouble as well!</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The Brilliant Planner feat lets you make a fund that you can use to pull out the item or resource you need in a particular situation, which can be pretty useful in clutch situations. The fighter gains several new combat feats that enhance his bravery (both against all mind-affecting effects and against social attacks like feint and demoralize) and even allow him to share his bravery with nearby allies.

               <p>On to spells: Intrigue spells in general lend themselves to sneaky and clever usage, but there's plenty of choices for all sorts of characters, even the most straightforward ones. One of the cool new things for spells is the ruse descriptor, which allows you to cast a spell that seems to be another spell unless the person identifying it succeeds by 10 or more. Things like the <i>false resurrection</i> spells, where you pretend to bring someone back to life but actually revive the body with a possessing demon or devil inside, <i>hollow heroism</i>, which works as normal for a while, but then you can change the effect from +2 to -4 at any time, and <i>treacherous teleport</i> where you send the other passengers of the <i>teleport</i> somewhere different than where you go. The <i>entice fey</i> spells allow you to bargain with fey and potentially earn their service and <i>conditional favor</i> lets you call take-backs on a beneficial spell you cast, so you could say "Sure, I'll cast this spell and remove your blindness, but only as long as you promise to follow the paladin code." There's all sorts of other fun measures and countermeasures in the spells so that PCs and their foes can escalate things like reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance, and then there's such fun spells to show off the bling of your magic, like <i>resplendent mansion</i>, which creates an actual mansion on a flat area that last for weeks!</p>

               <p>Finally, items: There's a variety of fun nonmagical intrigue items like a book with a hollow compartment in it and a wrist-launcher that shoots darts, as well as some suggestions of some top tools of the trade from <a href="/products/btpy8tmc"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a>. Some of the cool magic items include a shield that can pick a lock for you while you stand by the door fighting with your other hand, a weapon property that makes your weapon invisible, an armor that lets you redirect divinations meant for someone else to yourself, an erasable book that appears innocuous but secretly records everything people say around it, a pouch that erases the writing within it if anyone else tries to open it, a deck of cards with various doors on them that turn into doors when you put them on a wall, and the <i>quick-change mask</i>, a consumable that lets a vigilante instantly switch identities in a tight spot, and that's just a few of them.</p> 
               <p>Next week I'll cover the various special subsystem in <a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>, like verbal duels and influence, so be sure to keep a careful eye out; the blog might be plotting a heist to nab your prized McGuffin while you read it!</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Faith and religion are ubiquitous in Golarion, and some of the world's most fascinating divinities have also historically been its most mysterious. With the recent release of <a href="/products/btpy9j74"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Faiths</em></a>, though, we're drawing back the curtains shrouding 15 of the Inner Sea region's lesser-known deities. From Milani, the valiant Everbloom, to Brigh, the enigmatic Whisper in the Bronze, to Zyphus, the Grim Harvestman, this divine goody bag is filled with lore and tools for faithful characters. Now, let's reveal some of its secrets!</p> 
               <p>For those who want to play a devout character with the Deific Obedience feat, this book offers obediences and boons for all 15 featured deities. There are boons available to characters with levels in the evangelist, exalted, and sentinel prestige classes (<a href="/products/btpy8ief"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods</em></a> 198-203); characters without levels in those prestige classes can access the exalted boons.</p> 
               <p>Like other obediences we've published, the obediences in <a href="/products/btpy9j74"><em>Inner Sea Faiths</em></a> are tightly tied to their deities' portfolios, concerns, and roles in the campaign setting. For instance, take Kurgess's obedience, as written by freelancer Patrick Renie:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>Find the nearest boulder, log, or other unattended object that you can reliably lift over your head, and hold it up high for the duration of the obedience. If you are interrupted at any time by any creature or person, you must challenge your interrupter to a contest of strength, speed, or stamina, with the boulder or other object of your obedience as the main focus of the competition. Regardless of who wins, gain a +2 sacred bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.</i></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>For those more interested in how these faiths fit into Golarion's society at large, the book provides in-depth information about each divinity's priests—how they tend to approach their roles, what their lifestyles look like, and how they might interact with passing adventurers.</p> 
               <p>Each divinity's section also includes artwork of a priest of that faith. For instance, below we have priests of Achaekek, the Mantis God, whose section's author is Creative Director James Jacobs; Gyronna, the Angry Hag, whose section's author is Developer Crystal Frasier; and Sivanah, the Seventh Veil, whose section's author is Project Manager Jessica Price.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the oracle is a divine spellcaster driven by devotion to an ideal rather than to a particular deity.

That idea carried through into the new character designs for the <a href="/products/btpy9ezo"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>In the <a href="/products/btpy92zj"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</em></a>, the blind Oracle Alahazra wielded the power of storms against her enemies, while using her divine abilities to open a brief window into the party's future. In her new incarnation, the Bride of the Sun calls down the daystar's light on anyone who gets in her way, and that dazzling illumination makes many things clear to even those who lack eyesight. (She also has a sweet <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lid6">hat</a>.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraTempest.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraTempest_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraToken.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraToken_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BrideOfTheSun.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BrideOfTheSun_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>No, we don't know how she gets dressed like that without sight either.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>That last role power works in combination with the second power, so Alahazra can provide a long term strategic view of what's to come by peeking at the bottom two cards of a deck. Cartmanbeck gave you a preview of her other role, Wandering Prophet, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijp">two weeks ago</a>.</p> 
               <p>For the two new characters in the <a href="/products/btpy9ezo"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>, we decided to get freaky with our divination methods. Ramexes, as mentioned in that "Class Decks Update" blog, is a haruspex. That means he guts things and sees what's to come in their entrails. Since we're fully into fantasy stereotypes here at the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, we knew Ramexes had to be a pitborn.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesToken.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesToken_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesFront.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-Haruspex.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-Haruspex_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>He's not bad, he's just drawn that— ...well, actually, he's pretty bad.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Ramexes has a straightforward "kill 'em, cut 'em open, see what's coming" mechanic in his first character power. My favorite power of all time is his third character power, in which he cuts open his allies to gain prescience and bonus explorations. I cackle every time I play him, and he's one of my playtest characters for Season of the Runelords, so I play him a lot. The other folks in the office have gotten used to the frequent cackles that emanate from my cubicle. Or at least they've stopped asking about it.</p> 
               <p>The final character in our clairvoyant trio is Grazzle, a lizardfolk life oracle who practices ossomancy, or bone divination. He's slightly more fastidious/carnivorous than Ramexes, and prefers to use the whole kill rather than just the entrails.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleToken.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleToken_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleFront.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BoneDiviner.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BoneDiviner_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog... wait, </i>wool of bat<i>?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>As you can see, Grazzle's focus isn't on scrying, but rather on healing his party through a little self-sacrifice. He can automatically recharge his spells, so he fights like a sorcerer, and the Bone Diviner can still do a little divination where his friends are with a mechanic similar to S&amp;S Alahazra. The Bone Diviner also has a power that works with the variety of new diviner items that we've put in the <a href="/products/btpy9ezo"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>—but you'll have to wait and see those another time!</p> 
               <p>I showed off this deck to a playtester of mine, and he shuffled through the deck and gave me a look full of shock and misery. "Where's Augury?" he asked plaintively.</p> 
               <p>That's right, kids, the <a href="/products/btpy9ezo"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a> doesn't contain the Augury spell. Doesn't have it, doesn't need it. Between the new items and powers we've jammed in there, these oracles will be examining decks like it's their jobs; they'll want to save their spell slots for other things. We encourage you to pick it up and try it out, and see what you think.</p> 
               <p>Until next time, Pathfinders.</p>

               <p>In Season 7 we want to change that. We've assembled an all-star team of writers for our new three-part Seeker arc <em>All for Immortality</em>, which debuts this April. As in <em>Eyes of the Ten</em>, this new story takes the PCs to exciting new locations, many of which I've always wanted to visit but could never justify in a lower-level adventure. Likewise, you'll clash with powerful villains we dared not face before and deal a powerful blow to some of the Society's oldest enemies. The action begins in Thuvia with <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9k93/"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a> by veteran organized play author Thurston Hillman. Now that the secret's out, you'll see the product page appear soon.</p> 
               <p>Let's talk some numbers. First, this is a three-part series, and we're not going to make you wait a whole season to experience the story; expect #7-26 (Part 2) in June and #7-29 (Part 3) in July, following a brief hiatus to manage <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> releases in May. Second, we're aware that it can be tough to schedule <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> because it requires PCs to have exactly 33 XP. That's a necessary restriction for a series written with only one character level in mind, but it would be so much easier for players and organizers if we treated this more like standard scenarios, right? After all, I imagine many players would love to play both Seeker arcs with the same character. With that in mind, I'm happy to announce that all three <em>All for Immortality</em> adventures are Tier 12-15 (Subtiers 12-13 and 14-15).</p> 
               <p>Finally, there's one additional date that you should remember: April 6th! That Wednesday, Tonya and I will be joining Ryan and Perram on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com" target="_blank">Know Direction Podcast</a> to discuss this—including the other adventures' titles, authors, and destinations—share news about upcoming conventions, and answer your questions.

              <p class="date">Friday, March 11, 2016</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">I'm thrilled to announce that the next set of <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic gaming figures will be <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>! Deadly Foes is a 45-figure "full" Pathfinder Battles set with 6 pieces of bonus "dungeon dressing" randomly inserted into standard 4-piece booster boxes. The set's general theme allows for a huge variety of high-utility monsters and allies, with a focus on key creatures we've not yet produced and some exciting new surprises.</p> 
               <p>The biggest surprise, both literally and figuratively, is that the <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set includes two HUGE figures as its limited-edition case incentive! It's been a long, long time since we've been able to include Huge creatures in Pathfinder Battles, for a number of largely boring reasons related to production hurdles, form factors, and the like. I'm thrilled to report that we worked with WizKids for a solution to this problem. Past case incentive figures have been Gargantuan, the Pathfinder RPG size just above Huge, and we'll continue to include Gargantuan case incentives when they make sense. Mixing things up with our previous set, <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> was so successful that we're in an experimental mood. And we've decided to experiment by making the <a href="/products/btpy9kcv"><em>Deadly Foes</em> Case Incentive</a> a two-pack of two of our favorite Huge creatures: the Clockwork Dragon and the Spawn of Cthulhu!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Dragon.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Dragon_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the insanely detailed Clockwork Dragon, from the pages of <a href="/products/btpy91ds"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</em></a>! The creature's neutral alignment makes it the perfect foe for good or evil characters, and its looming size make it an impressive addition to any tabletop battle. The art for this creature is one of my favorite pieces to ever appear in a Pathfinder monster book, so I'm extra delighted to see it come to glorious three dimensions!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Cthulhu.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72379-Cthulhu_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die" is not just a sweet line from a Metallica song, it's also a key phrase in the mythology of American horror author H. P. Lovecraft, creator of the Cthulhu Mythos. It's also the inspiration for Pathfinder's next Adventure Path, <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a>, which launches in August. Here we have the dreaded Spawn of Cthulhu as it emerges from the water to destroy the sanity of your player characters. The world has seen a lot of Cthulhu miniatures over the years, but I've never quite seen one emerging from the ocean like this guy. WizKids's brilliance with clear water effects is sure to make this a distinctive, pants-ruining experience for your players when you plop down the Big C on your game table.</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week! I've got a ton of other images to show for this set, but it's unfortunately going to take two weeks to get to them. I'm off to the GAMA Trade Show in Las Vegas on Monday, and will be out for the entire week. I will try to get a blog completed while I am on the road, but I expect to be very, very busy next week and don't want to make any promises I can't keep.</p> 
               <p>But I did promise the Huge figures would reappear in <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a>, so I think you can count on my word!</p> 
               <p>Until the stars are right, I remain,</p>

Lovecraftian creatures are not new to the world of Golarion—they've been there since the beginning, thanks to Creative Director James Jacobs' love of the genre, but we haven't quite done an entire adventure path around them. The wait is over, starting with <a href="/products/btpy9k5o">"In Search of Sanity,"</a> penned by our own Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider, wherein you start off at a wee bit of a disadvantage—in an insane asylum. But that's not all that lies ahead! Check out other new stuff heading your way!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>If you've been with us since the playtest, the biggest change is that zealot and warlock are now archetypes, and while avenger and stalker each have some talents that only that specialization can choose, many of the talents that seemed like they fit the vigilante in general are now available to all vigilantes, as you requested in the playtest. Also, you asked for social talents based on being a craftsman or professional, and those are now available as well!</p> 
               <p>So I mentioned that warlock and zealot (which were arcane and divine vigilantes for those of you not part of the playtest) are now archetypes. All told, the vigilante has <i>10 pages</i> of archetypes, the most that any class has ever received in a book. After all, he has plenty of catch-up in order to match his older cousins that have been around for more books. The brute has a hulking out-of control vigilante identity, and he can't always stop the transformation when he's in danger. Cabalists make blood pacts with dark patrons, gaining witch spells, blood powers, and a familiar. Gunmasters bring justice with firearms, and they gain a bunch of deeds as potential vigilante talents. The magical child archetype covers the "magical girl" trope, with a transformation sequence ability (faster switch between identities, but with flashy lights and music), summoner spells, and an otherworldly buddy. Mounted furies are mounted vigilantes like Zorro whose steeds also have a secret identity. Psychometrists are gadgetmasters and tinkerers who create personal occult gadgets to do things like fly (basically creating gadgets that each perform a single occultist focus power). Warlocks, are arcane casters from the magus list, with elemental options and mystic bolts of energy. Wildsouls are vigilantes who gain animalistic features in their vigilante identity. Finally, zealots are secret champions of their faiths, often because their religion is outlawed or persecuted, who cast from the inquisitor list and smite foes of one opposing alignment. </p> 
               <p>But vigilantes aren't the only ones with archetypes. Exciting archetypes for other classes include the tyrant (a lawful evil antipaladin archetype!), cardinal (a politics-heavy cleric with 6 skill points per level), gray paladin (can be one step from lawful good and smite any foe, but the lack of absolute conviction makes many abilities less absolute), fey caller (unchained summoner that summons a fey, with an all-new fey eidolon), zeitgeist binder (spiritualist that calls in a local zeitgeist based on a settlement statistic like corruption or society), battle scion (Celt/King Arthur blend skald that can call others to a quest and go into a deathlike sleep to return some day), dandy (a courtly ranger with the ability to manipulate rumors instead of wild empathy), vizier (a mesmerist that has a "power behind the throne" ability to make it look like his allies are the real threat while insidiously influencing them for his own agenda), feyspeaker (a fey-themed druid with 6 skill points per level that casts using Charisma!), and plenty more. In addition, the classes chapter two new inquisitions (Crime and Secrets), three new ranger combat styles (deceptive, menacing, and underhanded), four new rogue talents (follow along, shades of gray, hidden mind, and stalker talent), an oracle mystery (Intrigue), and even five intrigue-themed kineticist utility wild talents (earthmeld, flame trap, spying touchsight, greater voice of the wind, and greater watersense).</p> 
               <p>Tune in next week to hear more about some of the cool feats, spells, and magic items of intrigue!</p>

               <p>Let me walk you through another good scenario...</p> 
               <p>I recently jumped into Trouble in Sandpoint in "Burnt Offerings." After selecting the scenario and watching a short cutscene, we see the scenario preview which would normally show a power telling me that after encountering a Wrathful Sinspawn, I would have a 1 in 6 chance of discarding blessings from the blessings deck. As you see below, things have changed... a bit.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Scenario.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Scenario_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Who needs a blessings deck anyway?</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Instead of a 1 in 6 chance of losing blessings, it's 1 in 2. Given that most of the henchmen, one of the location closing conditions, and the villain's summoning power will trigger this, my time is limited.</p> 
               <p>But wait, there's more! I've also been given two "Wildcard" powers. Wildcards are additional randomly chosen increases in difficulty. Night is approaching which means that each time I fail to get a boon, I lose another blessing, and coupled with the driving rain, those boons will be even harder to get. Time is definitely not on my side.</p> 
               <p>But wait, there's even more! I can move only to an adjacent location. Let's see what that means.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Setup.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Setup_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Amiri and Seelah leap into danger, while Ezren and Lem chill at the Apothecary. Yeah, that's about right.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>This is our location selection screen to place characters before the scenario begins. There are now connections between all of the locations and now movement is limited to those travel lines. No longer will healers be able to parachute into any location they're needed. So I have to place each character carefully using a strategy that takes into account location deck composition, location power, closing check, connections to the locations around it, distance from other characters, and an ideal path</p> 
               <p>I see a couple challenges immediately:</p> 
               <ol>
                <li>Two Intelligence/Knowledge location closures are spread far apart, but for Lem to be effective, I want to group him with Ezren.</li> 
                <li>Shrine of Lamashtu is connected only to the Old Light, so it's isolated. I decide to post Seelah there because, let's face it, she was made to face the Shrine.</li>
               </ol> 
               <p>So we're set! Let's take a look at what this looks like in game.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Map.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Map_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Welcome to Sandpoint, where you'll find bunyips aplenty in Ven Vinder's general store.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>From this view, which we call the scenario view, you can better see the spatial and thematic reasons that the travel lines are configured in this way. The Village House is acting as a hub and the Shrine to Lamashtu is the most remote location on the map. Not all locations map exactly to a place in Sandpoint, but if you look at the map of Sandpoint in the <a href="/products/btpy8tc0"><em>Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</em></a>, you’ll find that the Old Light, Junk Beach, and the Glassworks are all in the right places; the Apothecary is located at Pillbug Podiker’s, and the Village House is at the White Deer tavern and inn.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of the Village House, let's fast forward to the end of the Scenario. I have 2 blessings left before the scenario ends. Those blessings went fast! Ezren's moved over to Village House, Lem and Harsk have converged on the Waterfront, Amiri and Merisiel are tied up at their starting locations, and Seelah's just closed the Shrine. Ezren defeated the henchman last turn so he knows he's about to fight the villain. The Old Light is open.</p> 
               <p>If only I had a way to get someone over to Old Light...</p> 
               <p>Ezren knows that he's got a useful spell in his deck and he just drew Detect Magic. Ezren understands that the best way to hit a dangerous enemy is... carefully. And he embarks on some rather arcane planning. He casts Detect Magic to look at the villain he already knows to be there, and activates his Expanded Spellbook and comes across...</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Stride.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Stride_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Swift like a Sajan!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>...Stride! Perfect!</p> 
               <p>Stride is Obsidian's version of Levitate. We found that while Levitate was a good card (particularly for Legendary difficulty), it would have to prompt at the end of each character’s turn to activate properly, which can get old real fast. We pitched an alternate version with less versatility in some ways and more in others to Mike Selinker, Chad Brown, and Vic Wertz. Vic made an excellent point that we'd be diverging enough from the original Levitate card that it would make sense to call it something else. And since it's a new card, new art!</p> 
               <p>Anyway, back to the matter at hand. It's time for Seelah to move to The Old Light and do hero's work. Ezren pulls Erylium from the location deck and trusts in his friends to close their locations. Everyone does their part, leaving Seelah to try an Intelligence check.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-TempClose.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-TempClose_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Seelah's got this because she's literally the best character.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>It's tough, but with the power of prayer and Irori's blessing...</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Closed.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Closed_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Faith is just as good as brains to Seelah.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>She nails it! Now all that's left is for Ezren to blast Erylium to bits with all of the remaining dice.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Zap.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160308-Zap_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Lightning never gets old!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Boom!</p> 
               <p>Now that you have a sense for how Legendary Difficulty works, I'll give a super-brief history of this feature. One of the first big shifts we made from PACG was the use of maps and points to show the locations. Almost immediately, it was clear that we could do something more with maps, but we held off for a long time. We started developing the concept for having increased difficulties based on a number of factors. We knew that there was a strong desire to replay scenarios from Rise of the Runelords and many of you have run through Perils of the Lost Coast many, many times. I also spent some time checking out a lot of <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/homebrew">homebrew mods</a> people had done to make the game their own. I put this version of restricted movement together before PaizoCon last year (along with some other stuff we will talk about soon) and requested a meeting with the original PACG development team at the convention.</p> 
               <p>I think I led with, "We love your game! Development is going really well! Here's my plan to screw it all up." Mercifully, the whole team was excited and on board! They gave us a lot of fantastic input across the board.</p> 
               <p>The plan simmered for a while as we were nailing down other parts of the project, like the tutorial and roles. At the end of last year, David Williams (Designer for Legend of the Five Rings, Doomtown, and so many more) joined the team here at Obsidian and locked down our difficulty design and added the concept of randomly chosen Wildcard powers which makes such a big difference in replayability and challenge level.</p> 
               <p>Dave will be joined by art lead and UI designer Andre Nguyen and artist Lindsay Laney in <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/obsidian" target="_blank">another Twitch stream this Friday at 4 PM Pacific time</a>! Be sure to check it out!</p>

               <p>Of course, we don't need an International GM's Day to say thank you to all the GMs out there that spend large amounts of their free time preparing and running games for their players! The Pathfinder Society team would especially like to recognize those GMs achieving their 5th star over the past six weeks. To reach 150 games, a GM dedicates more than 750 hours to their craft, and that's just the time it takes to run games. There are many more hours of preparation and planning involved. Please join in a big round of applause for our newest 5-star GMs!</p>

Then I am off to Florida, where I'll hold a meet &amp; greet in Tampa and spend some vacation time with my family. While I'm away, John will be writing the Pathfinder Society blogs, so I will wish everyone a fun and happy Pharast and see everyone in Gozran!</p>

               <p>As a longtime band guy—one for whom getting played on 99.9's Metal Shop was a career highlight back in my metalcore days—it was a thrill to get to run a game in such a legendary location, surrounded by gold records from some of my favorite bands.

               <p itemprop="description">Introducing <a href="/products/btpy9j6p"><em>Ultimate Intrigue's</em></a> newest iconic character, Aric the vigilante. Be sure you also meet <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijc">the Red Raven</a>, his masked guise and alter ego.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Tumultuous Galt has captured the popular imagination—and noble nightmares—as blood-drenched anarchy dominated by unscrupulous demagogues, anonymous executioners known as the Gray Gardeners, frothing mobs that seek the destruction of a shattered aristocracy, and imposing guillotines known as final blades that drink the souls of the deceased. The madness has persisted for decades and consumed more than a dozen failed governments, claiming countless lives and shattering as many families—all in the name of liberty and the common good.</p> 
                <p>Aric was too young to understand why the Gray Gardeners came, dragging his parents into the night on charges of treason. He was too scared to watch as the final blade known as Madame Margaery descended twice, and he was too lonely to stop crying on the ride from the capital to his new home in the countryside. At Sister Sarinda's Home for Revolutionary Orphans, he learned that he could not show too much anger, even when forced to work too many hours sewing garments sold by his pitiless caretaker, his wages garnished to supplement funds the revolutionary governments promised but rarely delivered. While food was scarce, he was fed a torrent of “true” Galtan values that changed with every coup.</p> 
                <p>Like his fellow orphans, Aric eagerly absorbed these hateful lessons. However, where they believed themselves young revolutionaries who might sniff out traitors, he could not forget the cruel regime that had killed his parents and changed his life. He instead likened himself to the folk heroes of legend who served the common people at the expense of foul nobles. And so he ran away to live out his reckless fantasy.</p> 
                <p>He didn't find freedom so much as bandits found him. Fortunately they also found young Aric's dream amusing, and the aging leader Thanarus accepted the boy as his protégé. As Aric quickly learned, the bandits were not unprincipled thieves; the Revolution had wronged every one of them, much as it had wronged him. As a former knight who had seen the anarchy consume everything he held dear decades before, Thanarus had suffered longest of all. Nonetheless, he had upheld the old oaths of conduct sworn so long ago, and instructed Aric in the ways of mercy and morality, hoping to banish the hatred that burned within his pupil's heart. Thanarus also taught him the arts of the battlefield, acknowledging that no amount of integrity could keep a man safe in their tumultuous land.</p> 
                <p>These relatively happy times could not last. The merciless eyes of the Gray Gardeners inevitably turned upon Thanarus and his daring exploits, capturing him and his followers just before Aric returned from an errand in Woodsedge. By the time Aric pushed his way into Isarn, Thanarus was already dead—one more spirit consumed by Madame Margaery, body unceremoniously thrown from the city's crumbling walls, and victim of the current Revolutionary Council, known as the Council of Skulls. Aric waited until nightfall, chased away the scavengers, and buried his mentor by moonlight, keeping only the shredded cloak and ivory cameo of a bygone age that Thanarus had worn so proudly.</p> 
                <p>What followed was a blur of nights, weeks, and months spent seeking revenge against the council and Galt's corruption. Aric—now garbed in scarlet and Thanarus's cloak to hide his identity—tracked down and destroyed the Council of Skulls' inner circle. Hardly a morning passed without some citizen discovering a dead senator being scavenged by gruesome ravens that cawed with pride. In time, the people of Galt gave this crimson killer a name: the Red Raven.</p> 
                <p>The Council of Skulls buckled under the Red Raven's attacks and the demagoguery of their political rivals. The bloodthirsty mobs overthrew the regime and elected a new council headed by Citizen Korran Goss, who invited the red-garbed vigilante to help rebuild Galt and stop those who would perpetuate anarchy. At first the tasks were simple: deliver a message here and spy on a conspirator there. Then the requests grew in their violence: the breaking of an arm to send a warning or the apprehension of a traitor. Donning his mask gave Aric the courage to act and suppressed the mercy Thanarus had taught behind a faceless mien of unforgiving justice. As Citizen Goss's requests grew increasingly bloody, Aric began questioning his own role and whether the Red Raven was truly serving Galt or merely perpetuating a new generation of hatred. By night, the Red Raven could bury these doubts. By day, Aric couldn't help but voice his concerns, hoping to unearth some method behind the madness—or at least find true allies among the angry mobs. Driven by his passion and Thanarus's training, Aric's words began to find purchase in sympathetic ears. Unfortunately, they also reached the Revolutionary Council, and Citizen Goss quietly signed Aric's death warrant, contacting the only man he trusted to apprehend the miscreant: the Red Raven.</p> 
                <p>With the signed orders in hand, the Red Raven set off across the city while grappling with the irony of his task: the capture of his secret identity by his masked guise. Questions coursed through his mind. How could he, the Red Raven, survive the night without sacrificing the seductive fame in which he reveled? How could he convince Citizen Goss to reconsider? At last, he paused atop a roof and tore the mask from his face. “How?” he asked. “How can I delude myself? The Red Raven was supposed to end tyranny, yet here I am the worst tyrant of them all.”</p> 
                <p>Citizen Goss awoke to delightful news. The knave Aric of Halvon had been captured and left on the front steps of the council building, and the Red Raven had left a personal note praying that Aric's death would bring Galt one step closer to freedom. Goss cackled his approval when Aric's sham trial delivered a guilty verdict, and congratulated himself when the Gray Gardeners threw Aric into prison to await execution. His mirth only faded when the Red Raven stopped answering his summons. There was no sign of the masked hero. Even the ashes of the vigilante's incinerated costume had been swept from the street the day before. And in the prison Aric found peace.</p> 
                <p>However, not all were content to let another innocent fall to Madame Magaery, especially one so outspoken as Aric. In the dead of night, his cell door swung open, and an aging legal clerk by the name of Quinn extended a hand to help Aric to his feet. Together they fled south to Taldor, evading bounty hunters and exchanging tales of noble souls who had fallen prey to Galt's bloodlust. Where guilt wracked Aric with memories of the lives he had taken, Quinn was resolute, dedicated to aiding the falsely accused no matter the price. Aric could not help but find strength in his savior's words and actions. They parted ways soon thereafter, Quinn vowing to one day lay low the red-cloaked vigilante who had captured Aric. Aric in turn silently promised to uphold the ideals that Thanarus had taught him so long ago, and that Quinn had reinforced.</p> 
                <p>Aric has wandered ever since, wielding his courtly charms as an outspoken defender of liberty and peace. Thanarus's cameo once more serves as a reminder of the virtues Aric hopes to uphold—and the cost of losing himself in a cycle of violence. Yet charisma cannot vanquish all evils. When nothing can stop an injustice but cold steel, Aric dons his recreated disguise, and the Red Raven flies once more.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Some beings—like those from the Outer Planes—are intrinsically virtuous or malevolent; however, mortals enjoy the unique characteristic of free will. No humans are born evil. They become evil.</p> 
                <p>Like many children in the Nidalese city of Ridwan, the girl who would one day be called Zelhara grew up in a massive nursery run by the church of Zon-Kuthon. This institution allowed parents to continue their work without having to attend to their children's daily needs, and after a number of years, once the children could physically contribute to the household, they were returned to their families. Agents of Nidal's Umbral Court performed numerous tests on the children during their time under the care of the Kuthite clergy, selecting certain candidates for the state's and church's future needs. Mere weeks before she was to rejoin her family, Zelhara herself was brought before an Umbral Court agent who claimed he could see something in her that pleased the Midnight Lord. One day she would share his message of pain and duty with thousands of fearful inheritors. Her family, loyal Nidalese who worked meager trades in the city, found delight in knowing that their child would one day hold high status in the state.</p> 
                <p>Zelhara and 12 other children from the nursery began their training at a young age. Unlike shadowcallers, Zelhara and her young companions didn't undergo the scrutiny of a nightglass, but were instead selected by virtue of their mere presence and their reactions to fear and pain. Zelhara proved a severe and obedient child, perfect for the role of a state inquisitor.</p> 
                <p>After their selection, the children in Zelhara's group were moved into a wing of dormitories within the temple of Zon-Kuthon. The priests began the children's training with religious study and the dark history of their nation. The Kuthites taught the children how to identify enemies of the church and state. The members of Zelhara's group received the best foods at mealtimes, and as long as they performed their required duties and showed the proper respect to their tutors, they were allowed relative freedom to do as they pleased. They were even allowed outside the temple, and granted the privilege to occasionally spend time with their parents, provided they lived within Ridwan. This favorable treatment attracted jealousy and animosity from the young shadowcaller initiates and prospective clerics also training at the temple. Zelhara's tutors told her that the other children were envious because they were too independent and didn't properly understand submission. Zelhara believed it was because they knew they might one day have to withstand her ministrations.</p> 
                <p>Zelhara's training grew more rigorous as the instruction continued. She and her colleagues were encouraged to invent their own unique methods of inflicting pain and drawing the truth from their victims. Zelhara preferred emotional manipulation and stress positions rather than direct pain, for she believed pain to be a form of religious ecstasy that only the truly devoted could enjoy. As she subjected dissidents of Nidal to her ministrations, she felt strong and grew proud of the service she performed for her nation and her god.</p> 
                <p>As Zelhara and her companions matured into their teenage years, they moved to their own building in the city near the volcanic rift that splits Ridwan's central square, and their training changed significantly. Their tutors became more strict and abusive. Zelhara, who had been the standout student within her group, started to be treated with suspicion and disdain. She couldn't even perform simple tasks in the dormitory kitchens without being scolded and punished. She and the others suffered beatings, periods of isolation, and the burden of meaningless tasks at all hours of the day. Their old names were stripped away and their tutors provided new ones. The Kuthites forced Zelhara and her colleagues to torture and humiliate each other as part of their training, yet they still gave the students the chance to voluntarily remove themselves from the process and return to their families. Surprisingly, none of the children accepted. Despite their abuse, they wanted to be useful tools of the state, and while their instructors dehumanized them, the children formed bonds with one another, as they had no one else to rely upon. During this period, Zelhara grew close to Tornine, a boy she had known since her time at the nursery.</p> 
                <p>Finally, Zelhara and the others were judged ready to undergo a ritual called the Descent. More to test loyalty than to extract admissions of guilt, prospective inquisitors are placed in pairs within iron cages, their faces mere inches from each other, and then lowered into the rift in the center of Ridwan where the Midnight Lord is said to have first manifested upon Golarion. The oppressive heat causes intense pain and the cloying smoke makes breathing an ordeal. As the inquisitors are lowered into the rift, they must overcome their own suffering and disorientation to force their counterparts into absolute submission to their authority. Zelhara found herself paired with Tornine, and as the iron cage creaked down into the crevasse, they engaged in a battle of wills. Tornine tried to remain strong under Zelhara's scrutiny as tears evaporated from his cheeks, but Zelhara was unrelenting. She knew her strength was superior. When Tornine began to crumble within minutes of hanging over the sulfurous fissure, Zelhara felt utter disgust for her former friend and continued to disparage him. She didn't give the signal to raise the cage until she knew Tornine had died—just another useless tool to be discarded. Having passed the test, Zelhara achieved the rank of full inquisitor, earning her family's pride and admiration.</p> 
                <p>As one of Nidal's best and most thorough inquisitors and torturers, Zelhara now travels throughout Avistan in service to her nation and the Midnight Lord. Zelhara claims that, with enough time, she can make anyone divulge what they know—yet she doesn't care for forced statements, when people blurt out anything just to make her stop. Zelhara hears the real voices of her subjects when they scream in agony, and she can smell the truth in the blood that she spills in pursuit of her goals.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">Cartmanbeck's Best Character Ever—Alahazra</h1> 
              <p class="date">Tuesday, March 1, 2016</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>Hello all! I've been reading the "Best Character Ever" blogs for a while. Watching. Waiting. Biding my time until I got the perfect chance to explain why every one of them has been completely and utterly wrong (except Tanis's: goblins are pretty cool, after all.) <i>[I did not add that aside, but I applaud the author's good sense. -Tanis]</i> But even goblins do not compare to the awesome might that is Alahazra.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraFront.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraFront_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>If those white and red robes remind you of a certain classic video game character... trust me, she's not quite so forgiving.</i>
               </div> 
               <p itemprop="description">Alahazra, the iconic oracle, made her first <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Adventure Card Game</a> appearance in the <a href="/products/btpy92zj"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</em></a>. She may look weak at first, with her paltry d4s for Strength and Dexterity, but she sees things that others can't, and uses that information to beat down on enemies, acquire cards, and close locations like a <i>boss</i>. You see, S&amp;S Alahazra has a d12 for her Charisma, and she also uses that for her Divine checks. This means that when it's time to cast an offensive spell, she's often going to deal a ton of damage, especially with her final power giving her an extra +2 on all spells that have the Attack trait. She also has a great chance of recharging her spells with that high Divine check... but even when she fails a recharge check, she gets to trade any discarded card with the Divine trait for any other one (so a blessing for a spell, perhaps?) at the end of her turn.</p> 
               <p>Alahazra's other main power is the ability to recharge a card with the Divine trait to examine the top card of any location. This means that Alahazra can scout for everyone as long as she has a few blessings or spells in her hand that she doesn't mind recharging. (And she starts with 2/3 of her deck being spells and blessings!) In my playthrough of <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, I found that a perfect turn for Alahazra entailed recharging enough cards to look at the top card of every location deck, leaving just a spell in her hand, and then exploring and hopefully killing a monster with that spell.</p> 
               <p>Now, I'm not going to try to act like Alahazra has no weaknesses. If she's dealt damage, since she starts with no armor, she'll usually be taking all of that damage from her large hand size. With her ability to fish Cure spells back out of her discard pile, though, this generally doesn't end up being a huge problem. Our S&amp;S Damiel was at risk of dying way more often than my Alahazra was. (Though our Damiel player was a fan of living dangerously... this might be an Alchemist trait.)</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraTempest.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraTempest_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraStargazer.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraStargazer_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>If Alahazra isn't gazing into the stars, she might as well be destroying them.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>For roles, I'm going to start with the Tempest. This role is all about damaging enemies with her spells. In fact, she likes spells that have the Attack trait so much, she can even cast Arcane spells as long as they have that trait! She also adds up to 4 to each of her combat checks when using the Attack trait, so she can dole out some serious punishment.</p> 
               <p>But while Alahazra's Tempest role is great, her Stargazer role is absolutely <i>amazing</i>! This role gives her several powers that build upon her examine ability, allowing her to recharge cards for other characters or—and this is the important one—<i>encounter</i> boons that she examines at any location! This means that, for the price of recharging a blessing or a Divine spell, Alahazra can examine a card at another location, and if it's a boon, she can attempt to acquire it. If she makes the check, awesome, new boon for her! But even if she fails the check, she has just removed a card from the top of another location deck without risking fighting a monster. By the end of <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, my Alahazra was spending her whole turn recharging blessings to rip boons off the top of every deck, leaving all the monsters for other combatants to face.</p> 
               <p>The <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> version of Alahazra was amazing, the best character I've ever played... and now in the <a href=""><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>, we're getting a NEW version of her! This Alahazra is tougher and more combat-oriented than the S&amp;S version, so I imagine she'll appeal to a different group of players. Don't worry, though, she still has the ability to examine cards and scout ahead.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraFront.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraBack.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraBack_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Just as beautiful, and even more deadly.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>This new version of Alahazra still has paltry d4s for her Strength and Dexterity, but her Constitution is a respectable d8, as is her Intelligence. She still has a bonus to Knowledge, which will be very helpful if you play her through Season of the Righteous, and her awesome d12 Charisma with +2 Divine bonus is still there in all its glory. However, this time Alahazra can shirk other Attack spells to use her own holy fire on enemies, getting a respectable 1d12 + 2d4+2 right off the bat by discarding the top card of her deck. This means you can feel free to load her deck up with Cure spells to get all those discarded cards back without worrying about whether you have the resources to fight.</p> 
               <p>Oracle Deck Alahazra still has a power that involves examining cards, and in this case it lets her examine an extra card whenever she examines. This pairs incredibly nicely with the promo card that came with the Alahazra mini in <a href="/products/btpy99z3"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes Set 3</em></a>, allowing her to examine yet another extra card. Make sure to pick up an Augury spell!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-SeersHeaddress.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-SeersHeaddress_120.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>It may not be comfortable, but at least it's lighter than <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgcn">Shardra's</a>!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>The last power listed on Alahazra's card uses a new term you might not have seen before: "invokes". The term will be familiar to those playtesting the upcoming Mummy's Mask Base Set, but this is the first time a card bearing the word is seeing the light of day. A check invokes a trait if it has or is against a card that has that trait, so if either your check or the card you're encountering has the trait, you're good. A bane invokes a trait if it has that trait or if it deals only damage of the type that matches that trait.</p> 
               <p>As you can see, this "invokes" power applies to Alahazra's first power, letting her burn evil away with her holy fire and then move away afterward. Perhaps you examined the top three cards of your current location, saw a monster that you could easily destroy, but then found an important boon that Alahazra just doesn't have the correct skill to acquire? Just kill off that pesky monster and move away to another location to explore some more, leaving that sweet magic pistol for Lirianne to pick up on her turn instead.</p> 
               <p>Before I leave you, let's examine one of Class Deck Alahazra's roles. This happens to be my favorite of her two new roles: the Wandering Prophet.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraWanderingProphet.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraWanderingProphet_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>When Alahazra shows up in your village, you should probably ask her about your future. It might just save your life.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Why do I like this role? Well, mostly because it brings back some of that seer-y goodness that I loved so much about her in <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>. First off, you don't always have to discard a card to use your holy fire anymore—if it's a spell or a blessing, you get to recharge it instead (and let's face it, most of her deck is going to be made up of spells and blessings). She also gets to move other characters when she invokes the Fire trait, which is useful. But it's those new powers at the bottom that I'm most excited about. First, you get to evade barriers, which are in all honesty a challenge for both incarnations of Alahazra. You can even let other characters evade barriers eventually.</p> 
               <p>My favorite new power, though, is that examine power. You get to examine the top card of your location deck, at the end and eventually <i>also</i> the start of your turn, at no cost. Combine this with her earlier power (and her headdress!), and you're examining most of the deck in just a few turns. You can plan out every step of your turn before encountering a single card!</p> 
               <p>Now I know you can agree that Alahazra is the best character ever. She doesn't need brute strength, fancy weapons, or armor. She knows what's coming before it arrives, and can prepare herself accordingly. She can look into the future and see the answer to a question before it is asked... and when necessary, she can rain down some serious divine wrath on an enemy or two. As much as I love <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li9y">Lini</a>, and as much as I'm looking forward to seeing <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lid6">Ramexes</a> in action, the best character ever released (so far) for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is, without question, Alahazra.</p>

               <p>With the completion of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>, our thoughts have turned to scum and villainy in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance">Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>! While not everybody's cup of mint-flavored tea, it certainly is a change of pace from being more good-aligned (let me tell you about my veneficus witch some time), and I'm here to offer you a special <del>contract</del> challenge: turn one of our Pathfinder iconics into one of the bad guys.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1114-Seelah.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1114-Seelah_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br><i>Antipaladin Seelah, or Hellknight Seelah—you get to decide!</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Okay, so that's not much of a stretch for Seltyiel (or the crew he's running around with in <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain"><em>Pathfinder Comics: Hollow Mountain</em></a>).</p> 
               <p>But sometimes it's just one incident to make a hero into the bad guy, and you get to design what that looks like! Your entry will be judged on presentation and theme, and we're offering a rare prize for the winning entry: A <b>custom Paizo.com avatar</b> with art selected from <a href="/products/btpy9gds">"The Hellfire Compact"</a>, <a href="/products/btpy9h32">"Wrath of Thrune"</a>, or <a href="/products/btpy9hdv"><i>Cheliax, the Infernal Empire</i></a>. The winner will also receive $25 in store credit, and <b>five runner-ups</b> will get $10 in store credit.</p> 
               <p>Here are the rules to design your villain:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Entry must be based on one of the non-evil <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/iconics/meetTheIconics">Pathfinder iconics</a> (but not any of the "Meet the Villains" characters). (A complete package of pregenerated characters for comparison is <a href="/products/btpy9a64">located here</a>.)</li> 
                <li><b>Character level</b>: 4th. At least one class level must as the iconic as originally presented. (Seelah needs at least one level in paladin, for example.) Archetypes are encouraged, but not required.</li> 
                <li><b>Ability Scores</b>: 20 point buy</li> 
                <li><b>Traits</b>: Two, with a campaign trait from <a href="/products/btpy9jva"><em>Hell's Vengeance Player's Guide</em></a> (Amoral Mercenary, Apprentice Devilbinder, Asmodean Acolyte, Erratic Malefactor, Ex-Iomedean, Good Slip, Hellknight Aspirant, Local Tough, Scion of the Nine Circles, or Thrune Informant).</li> 
                <li><b>Available Gold</b>: 6,000 gp</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>But that's not all! I have some rules that I must pass down, and I think they might be Asmodean rather than Abadaran in origin...</p> 
               <ul>
