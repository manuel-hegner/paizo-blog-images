  \ – James Jacobs (Part 2)</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 16, 2009</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Today we continue the series on Paizo's Appendix N with the second part\
  \ of my interview with James Jacobs, the editor-in-chief of Pathfinder. We pick\
  \ up where we left off, as James finishes discussing his most important literary\
  \ influences and closes the interview with an explanation of his favorite horror\
  \ films.</p> \n   <p><b>James</b>: Stephen King's Dark Tower books were particularly\
  \ influential, as they are as much magic and science fiction as they are horror.\
  \ What's neat is that all of his stories are interconnected, like Lovecraft's. Names\
  \ and locations reappear and become part of King's mythos—which also includes nods\
  \ to the Cthulhu Mythos. I think King very successfully straddles the fine line\
  \ between homage and pastiche, as it's easy enough to write in the style of Lovecraft\
  \ and other classic horror authors, but much harder to use those themes while writing\
  \ with your own voice. Stephen King does this admirably.</p> \n   <p>F. Paul Wilson,\
  \ and particularly his character Repairman Jack, was another big influence. The\
  \ series of stories featuring Repairman Jack are like modern-day X-Files, except\
  \ that one of the primary themes is the idea that it's just one man versus cosmic\
  \ horror.</p> \n   <p>Ramsey Campbell was another influence; he's a British author\
  \ who began his career writing Lovecraftian horror fiction but later moved on to\
  \ more psychological horror themes such as madness, ghosts, and deranged murderers.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>The Descent</i>, by Jeff Long, really captured my imagination. Without\
  \ giving away too many details, the novel is essentially about a real-world Darklands.\
  \ Humans live on the surface of the world, oblivious to the fact that \"other\"\
  \ descendents from our common ancestors live beneath them; in the novel, Long explains\
  \ that, over the course of human history, these creatures have served as the basis\
  \ for humanity's shared myths of devils living beneath the earth.</p> \n   <p><b>David</b>:\
  \ That's quite an extensive list of fiction! But you're even bigger movie buff,\
  \ correct? Tell us about the movies that most influenced you.</p> \n   <p><b>James</b>:\
  \ There's probably too many to name all of them; I have a wall of DVDs in my apartment.\
  \ In terms of movies, my main interest is still horror. When I was a kid, my dad\
  \ and I would watch <i>Creature Features</i>, a TV series that aired a new monster\
  \ flick every Saturday night. So my love of horror movies began at an early age.\
  \ My two all-time favorites are, without a doubt, <i>Alien</i> and John Carpenter's\
  \ <i>The Thing</i>.</p> \n   <p>To rattle off other big influences, there's <i>The\
  \ Blair Witch Project</i>, <i>Godzilla</i> (which asks the question \"what if the\
  \ atomic bomb was actually a creature?\"; there is a scene in the movie where a\
  \ bunch of kids are horribly burned and crying for their moms, not realized that\
  \ they've been killed—it's super-grisly), <i>Jaws</i>, <i>the Exorcist</i>, <i>Lord\
  \ of the Rings</i>, Schwarzenegger's <i>Conan</i>, <i>Psycho</i>, <i>The 7th Voyage\
  \ of Sinbad</i>, <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i> (Stitch served as a primary inspiration\
  \ for Pathfinder goblins, both in terms of look and personality), and the classic\
  \ 1950s horror film <i>Tarantula</i>.</p> \n   <p>Whenever I assign adventures to\
  \ freelance authors, I like to point them to movies that will give them an idea\
  \ of the tone we are shooting for—it's much faster for authors to find inspiration\
  \ by watching a 2-hour movie than to read an entire book, although if they have\
  \ time in the sometimes too-short deadlines we give them, books can remain a great\
  \ source of inspiration. For instance, I told Richard Pett to check out the old\
  \ Hammer Horror movies when he was writing \"The Skinsaw Murders\" and pointed Nick\
  \ Logue at <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i>, <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, and <i>Deliverance</i>\
  \ for \"The Hook Mountain Massacre.\"</p> \n   <p>Overall, I would have to say that\
  \ my two biggest inspirations are H. P. Lovecraft for books, and John Carpenter\
  \ for movies.</p> \n   <br> \n   <p>Thus concludes my interview with James Jacobs.\
  \ Thanks for taking the time to discuss your biggest inspirations, James, and thanks\
  \ for reading, Paizonians! Come back again as we continue to expand Paizo's own\
  \ Appendix N!</p> \n   <p>David Eitelbach <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote>\
