  description\"><p>Remember when Paizo first announced the new 64-page format for\
  \ the module line back in November 2012? I recall mentally comparing it side-by-side\
  \ with the 32-page modules from the perspective of a Venture-Lieutenant, store liaison,\
  \ and event organizer. Those 32 pages were already pretty tough to squeeze into\
  \ a one-day event. 64 pages would certainly be impossible. I remember thinking back\
  \ then that Mike and Mark would have to do some clever thinking to find some way\
  \ to sanction the module for Pathfinder Society Organized Play. I shrugged and just\
  \ assumed that I would end up writing the boons for the Chronicle sheets but nothing\
  \ more.</p></span> \n    <p>Soon after I started work at Paizo in February, they\
  \ both asked me what my plan was for sanctioning <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvy\"\
  ><i>Dragon's Demand</i></a>. My how things change over the course of a few months.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The new module format is an exciting opportunity to explore new ways\
  \ of sanctioning adventures that were not written with Pathfinder Society in mind.\
  \ On one end we have the 32-page modules that are sanctioned in their entirety,\
  \ allowing players to earn 3 XP and experience a complete story. On the other end\
  \ we have the Pathfinder Adventure Path line, which gets sliced up a bit during\
  \ the sanctioning process to provide players and organizers with a fairly contained\
  \ play experience that might fill the same amount of time as a 32-page module. Players\
  \ can experience Adventure Paths in \"campaign mode,\" in which the players just\
  \ play the Adventure Path as they like and get Chronicle sheets in the end, or they\
  \ can play in \"module mode,\" in which the players only play the sanctioned sections.\
  \ I love the versatility that these two options give groups, but I also love knowing\
  \ that players have experienced the full story that an Adventure Path has to offer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With 64 pages there's just enough material that it seems in need of trimming,\
  \ but at the same time the length is so tantalizingly accessible that I wince at\
  \ the thought of irreverently carving it up for a waiting crowd of Pathfinder Society\
  \ players. Also the idea that a character could progress a full six levels in one\
  \ module is both exciting and daunting; it both means that players can zip ahead\
  \ to enjoy higher level content, but it also means that they can level up a character\
  \ far faster than is intended. That would probably also mean making six Chronicle\
  \ sheets!</p> \n    <p>Well, let me get the bad news out of the way first: Playing\
  \ through all of Dragon's Demand will not grant a Pathfinder Society character six\
  \ levels of credit. Now let's talk about everything else, which is all positive.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You can play through Dragon's Demand in either \"campaign mode\" or \"\
  module mode.\" In module mode, the module is broken into three large chunks that\
  \ grant respective Chronicle sheets, cover about 75% of the module, and can be played\
  \ stand-alone. As usual, one can play any legal, level-appropriate character in\
  \ each sanctioned section—even playing a different character in each.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In campaign mode, one can play through the whole module with a single character\
  \ (Pathfinder Society legal or not, just like in Adventure Paths). During the adventure,\
  \ you level up your character following normal Pathfinder rules, just like in a\
  \ home game. If you play through the whole thing, you not only get the three Chronicle\
  \ sheets, but you also gain a fourth sheet. Each one represents 3 XP and 4 Prestige,\
  \ so playing the whole story not only means that you get to enjoy the whole story;\
  \ it means your character's XP value in Pathfinder Society more accurately reflects\
  \ the challenges you overcame.</p> \n    <p>I'm sure someone will ask, so here are\
  \ the planned level ranges for the Chronicle sheets and sanctioned portions.</p>\
  \ \n    <ul> \n     <li>Chronicle sheet 1: Level 1–3 </li>\n     <li>Chronicle sheet\
  \ 2: Level 3–5 </li>\n     <li>Chronicle sheet 3: Level 5–7 </li>\n     <li>Bonus\
  \ Chronicle sheet: Level 2–6 </li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Enjoy the scenario, and you'll\
  \ have a 4th-level dragonslayer with a Chronicle sheet ready to apply once you gain\
  \ a level.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
