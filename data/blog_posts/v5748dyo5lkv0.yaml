  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today is Free RPG Day! Participating\
  \ hobby game retail locations and industry publishers will be giving away free adventures\
  \ and other materials so that gamers can try new games and play exclusive content\
  \ together. This year Paizo has contributed three special products.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ first thing we're providing is the next adventure in the We Be Goblins series\
  \ featuring the hijinks of Chuffy, Mogmurch, Poog, and Reta—<a href=\"/products/btpya1au?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-5uper-Goblins\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Module: We Be 5uper Goblins</i></a> by our own Crystal Frasier. The\
  \ brainstorm meeting for this adventure was easily one of the funniest meetings\
  \ I've ever attended, which was super welcome because we'd all had a few really\
  \ stressful weeks at that time. Here are a few words from Crystal about her zany\
  \ adventure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180616-SquealyNord.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <br><i>Artist: Oksana Federova</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Goblins win! Goblins reign! Goblins venture ‘cross\
  \ the planes!</p> \n      <p>There's not a lot our intrepid goblin hero-chiefs—\
  Reta, Chuffy, Mogmurch, and Poog—haven't done at this point. They've conquered vicious\
  \ halflings, slain literate cannibals, bested ogres, and battled terrifying harpies!\
  \ They've grown from mere whelps to big bad hero-chiefs! What's left?</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Maybe travelling the planes and fighting a vicious dragon?</p> \n      <p><i>We\
  \ Be 5uper Goblins</i> is the capstone for the We Be Goblins series, dropping everyone's\
  \ favorite anarchists into a strange new setting where they need their wits and\
  \ strong stomachs to survive.</p> \n      <p>Goblin adventures are always fun to\
  \ write, because you can play with weird, fun ideas and bend the rules more than\
  \ you can in a typical Pathfinder adventure, so I'm always happy when they come\
  \ around. It turns the typical adventure dynamic on its head; you assume, on some\
  \ level, that adventurers because they want to do \"good\" and they want to get\
  \ rich. But goblins adventure because they want to do \"crime\" and get fed! Those\
  \ two simple words open up lots of weird, fun new encounters, and I hope your players\
  \ utterly break the narrative presented in this book for this year's Free RPG Day!\
  \ I know mine did.\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The next exciting thing\
  \ you'll find at your local retailer is a short adventure for Starfinder—<a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot\"><i>Starfinder Module: Skitter Shot</i></a>,\
  \ featuring the colorful, lovable, and helpful six-armed skittermanders. Our own\
  \ Jason Keeley wrote this adventure, and I tracked him down in the far reaches of\
  \ space to get a few words about his adventure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ \n      <br><i>Artist: Graey Erb</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Hihello, nufriends! Today, you'll finally be able to get all of your\
  \ hands on Starfinder's Free RPG Day offering,<a href=\"/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot\"\
  ><i>Skitter Shot</i></a> and see what happens when you point a quartet of skittermanders\
  \ at a problem and say, \"Go help!\" The four fuzzy friends will need to work together\
  \ to defeat a rogue artificial intelligence aboard a luxury cruise ship, and will\
  \ hopefully come out the other end with all their limbs intact.</p> \n      <p>When\
  \ we decided skittermanders would be the focus, we took the opportunity to not only\
  \ give you a fun and wacky adventure, but to illustrate our vision for the hyperactive\
  \ creatures. Since they appeared in <i>Starfinder Alien Archive</i>, skittermanders\
  \ have certainly captured most everyone's imaginations! And so, to further stoke\
  \ those fires, <i>Skitter Shot </i>presents detailed backstories of the four skittermander\
  \ pregens, each with a fun piece of skittermander slang that you can work into your\
  \ everyday Starfinder conversations. But that's not all, the inside back cover of\
  \ the book features a list of ten fun facts about skittermanders that will give\
  \ you insight into their society and personal relations.</p> \n      <p>Like any\
  \ good skittermander, WE only want to help YOU.\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n  \
  \   <p>Lastly, players can add some ferocious goblin fun to their to Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game with <a href=\"/products/btpya1be?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-NokNok\"\
  >Nok-Nok</a>. This fully playable character, complete with role and token cards,\
  \ will be released for Free RPG Day 2018. Nok-Nok may be used with any <a href=\"\
  /store/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> set.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As in past years, the new Free RPG Day module is also sanctioned for\
  \ the organized play campaign, and we've released the sanctioning document so that\
  \ GMs have a chance to read over it and print out Chronicle sheets. You can find\
  \ links to these downloads on the product pages, but we've also gathered them here\
  \ to make things easy on you. If you're planning on playing the adventure, it's\
  \ best to not check out the sanctioning documents. No one wants spoilers!</p> \n\
