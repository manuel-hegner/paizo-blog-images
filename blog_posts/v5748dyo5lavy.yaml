  \ <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, March 17, 2010</p> \n    <p>I hate airing our dirty\
  \ laundry in public...</p> \n    <p>Who am I kidding, I relish airing our dirty\
  \ laundry in public, but professionalism and good taste often makes doing so...\
  \ \"inadvisable.\" But this is a special situation and in this instance it's easy\
  \ to talk around the specifics so to protect the innoce—well, in this case, to protect\
  \ the guilty. As we've been trying to show off our editorial processes with this\
  \ project, even more reason to let you all in on how things sometimes play out around\
  \ here.</p> \n    <p>The product in question: <a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8b7y\"\
  ><i>From Shore to Sea</i></a>, our Pathfinder Module partnered with Wolfgang Baur's\
  \ patron-fueled <a href=\"http://open-design.livejournal.com/\" target=\"nofollow\"\
  >Open Design</a> venture.</p> \n    <p>The topic: Sometimes we get screwed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So, let's backtrack a little bit. Here's something most folks didn't\
  \ notice—unless you've been getting emails from me or really enjoy reading the credits\
  \ pages of our projects. Around October of last year my title here at Paizo totally\
  \ didn't change. What comes after that title did, though. Thus, \"Managing Editor\
  \ of <i>Pathfinder</i>\" became \"Managing Editor of Paizo Publishing.\" The distinction:\
  \ now I'm not just in charge of making sure everything runs smoothly for <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i></a>, but everything\
  \ else we publish too. And, as a special bonus challenge, that it all happens in\
  \ a timely manner. That's been the real trick. It's like telling someone to build\
  \ a number of towers (one for each product line) but, hey, for fun, let's start\
  \ at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, in this case, is our \"schedule\
  \ debt,\" a sizable hole with depth markers called <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ magazines, the <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/35E/v5748btpy84eo\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting</i></a>, the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</i></a>, and other beautiful fiascos that have gradually meant nearly\
  \ everything we publish has fallen off its intended tracks. A real nasty peril when\
  \ you've got thousands of gamers rightly demanding the products they've subscribed\
  \ to and expect from month to month. But with my shiny Paizo-brand carrot and Paizo-brand\
  \ stick, and the incredible efforts of our insanely talented and even more dedicated\
  \ designers, editors (with a special nod to Judy Bauer, Chris Carey, Rob McCreary,\
  \ and James Sutter), and folks at all levels of the company who have sacrificed\
  \ nights, weekends, sleep, and meals to write and edit, those towers have reached\
  \ up and up toward the light. The first tower to break the surface was the Pathfinder\
  \ Module line with <i>From to Shore to Sea</i>, scheduled to go to print, on time,\
  \ March 5th.</p> \n    <p>Or rather it would have, if the art we ordered actually\
  \ came in. Oh, I don't just mean came in on time, I mean, was going to come in <i>at\
  \ all</i>. What we got on the due date instead of a half dozen illustrations was\
  \ an apology from Joe \"You'll-Never-Work-in-this-Town-Again\" and a very empty\
  \ \"good luck!\" Lame. Now, art directorix Sarah Robinson is a goddess for a variety\
  \ of reasons, but the power she employed in this particular crisis was to bat her\
  \ eyelashes via email and coax a whole host of fantastically talented artists to\
  \ take up the slack, and in record speed. What that did mean, though, is that instead\
  \ of going out on time, <i>From to Shore to Sea</i> is now going out next week,\
  \ three weeks behind my precious schedule. Ugh.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <div\

  \    </table>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Wolf set us up with this great\
  \ plan, author Brandon Hodge pulled together a fantastic adventure, the Open Design\
  \ patrons made a host of inspired suggestions, and Rob developed this thing into\
  \ a fine addition to our Pathfinder Modules line in record time. And Dan Scott,\
  \ our ever reliably awesome cover artist, did the incredible cover I’ve attached\
  \ here. (Again, Dan: great and timely work. We love Dan’s stuff.) Yet despite top-notch\
  \ materials and everyone who touched the adventure doing heroic work, sometimes\
  \ things still don't work out the way they should. Sometimes it makes things frustrating\
  \ and stressful, but never, ever boring.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8b7y\"\
  ><i>From Shore to Sea</i></a> will be awesome, there's no doubt about that, and\
  \ I'm more excited about this one than I am about most. But, sadly, this one has\
  \ had a bumpy journey, and my first tower breaking the surface will likely have\
  \ to wait for <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8b7r\"><i>City of Strangers</i></a>\
  \ in the Pathfinder Chronicles line later this month. Missing a deadline sadly isn't\
  \ something new, so don't go adjusting orders or rechecking release dates; this\
  \ happens sometimes and no one outside this building ever hears about it. Our website\
  \ and warehouse teams are also quite adept—to our chagrin—at picking up our slack.\
  \ And, should all our plans continue to work and there are relatively few additional\
  \ catastrophes, you shouldn't ever hear me griping about our \"editorial debt\"\
  \ again.</p> \n    <p>So just a heads-up for all the folks who have been invested\
  \ in and keenly anticipating Open Design's <a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8b7y\"\
  ><i>From to Shore to Sea</i></a>: it's awesome and it's coming, but sometimes the\
  \ path from author to your hands has some unanticipated adventures. And expect a\
  \ very boring blog post from me in a few months announcing that all our product\
  \ lines are, at last, shipping to the printer on time. It might not matter much\
  \ to folks outside these offices, but here, it's going to be cresting the top of\
  \ a very tall hill.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p>Wes Schneider<br> Managing\
