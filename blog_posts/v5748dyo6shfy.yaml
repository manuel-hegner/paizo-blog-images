  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With the release of the\
  \ Precog Playtest, the Starfinder Society Organized Play Program is also opening\
  \ its doors to a limited form of playtest, specifically for the Precog class. Since\
  \ this class won't be for some time, we're looking at allowing players the chance\
  \ to test out this new during the playtest period.</p> \n     <p><b>Playtest Period</b>:\
  \ The availability for these rules runs from the publishing of this post until the\
  \ end of the playtest period (December 25, 2020.) Once this period has expired,\
  \ players can no longer use the Precog Playtest class until its publication in a\
  \ future Starfinder product.</p> \n     <p><b>How It Works</b>: We're opening up\
  \ Society play for the playtest class via the use of custom created characters that\
  \ operate much like our pregenerated characters. We believe this should encourage\
  \ players to test the waters with custom builds, be it with current scenarios or\
  \ through our growing stable of repeatable options.</p> \n     <p><b>Creating a\
  \ Playtest Character</b>: Prior to playing a scenario in the playtest period, a\
  \ player can determine if they want to playtest the new class. Depending on the\
  \ tier of the scenario, the player can then use a 1st-, 4th- or 8th-level character\
  \ using the Precog class presented in the Playtest and created using the following\
  \ guidelines:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Class</b>: The character must have\
  \ all levels in the Precog class. Although multiclassing ramifications are important\
  \ for the playtest as a whole, we're keeping to single classes in the organized\
  \ play portion of the playtest for simplicity.</li> \n      <li><b>1st Level</b>:\
  \ The character can be created using the character creation rules presented in the\
  \ <em>Starfinder Core RulebookM</em> and <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder\
  \ Society</em>.</li> \n      <li><b>4th Level</b>: This character follows the same\
  \ rules as above, except it can select one 4th level armor or weapon and one 3rd\
  \ level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 4,000 credits on\
  \ other available equipment.</li> \n      <li><b>8th Level</b>: This character follows\
  \ the same rules as above, except it can select one 8th level armor or weapon and\
  \ one 7th level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 18,000\
  \ credits on other available equipment.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p><b>Credit</b>:\
  \ The credit earned for playing a playtest character follows the same rules and\
  \ guidelines as presented on page 7 of the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder\
  \ Society</em>. This means that you must choose which of your characters will receive\
  \ the credit at the beginning of the adventure. Credit must be assigned to characters\
  \ of lower level than the playtest character.</p> \n     <p><b>Resolving Conditions</b>:\
  \ We recognize that players taking the opportunity to playtest these characters\
  \ are performing a service for the game and campaign. As a result, whenever a player\
  \ playtests a 4th- or 8th-level version of these characters, the cost to purchase\
  \ a <em>raise dead</em> is reduced to 6 Fame and subsequent restorations to remove\
  \ the negative levels are only 1 Fame each. This means that there's still some risk\
  \ to your established characters, but the penalty for dying as a playtest character\
  \ is far less onerous than it would be for a normal character or pregenerated character.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Applying Credit</b>: As we want to encourage extra play of the higher-level\
  \ versions of the Precog, we're also going to open up the rules for applying credit\
  \ when playing a playtest character. A player using a non-1st-level playtest character\
  \ may choose to apply the earned Chronicle Sheet to an existing Organized Play character.\
  \ To do so, simply replace the credits earned on the Chronicle Sheet with credits\
  \ from the list below that match the level range of the existing player character.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Levels 1-2: 720 credits (2,160 credits for Adventure Path\
  \ module)</li> \n      <li>Levels 3-4: 1,460 credits (4,380 credits for Adventure\
  \ Path module)</li> \n      <li>Levels 5-6: 4,085 credits (12,255 credits for Adventure\
  \ Path module)</li> \n      <li>Levels 7-8: 5,835 credits (17,505 credits for Adventure\
  \ Path module)</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>With all this in mind, we encourage our\
  \ players to take an active part in the playtest, both by sharing your opinions\
  \ online in the Playtest forums and by completing the playtest surveys. We hope\
  \ that by opening up the means in which players can create and customize characters\
  \ for the playtest, that we can see some unique and fun builds using this new class\
  \ and that such tests will provide the design team with priceless \"field agent\"\
  \ feedback!</p> \n     <p>I look forward to hearing from each of you about your\
  \ experiences with the Precog class and am even more excited to see this class join\
  \ the roster of Starfinder classes sometime in the future!</p> \n     <p style=\"\
