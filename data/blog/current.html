                   <h3>THE LAST STAND OF KARNATH! — CR 6</h3>
                   <p>After catching Firefight’s notice playing Valko Derby, the PCs were invited to step out of the valkopods and become the real huzkars by joining the New Valor Defense Force. NVDF training is comprehensive for all recruits, regardless of prior vocation, to prepare them for military duties and potential challenges from combat training and mech repair to physical fitness and aircraft piloting. All potentially dangerous training occurs in simulated environments utilizing some of the galaxy’s best virtual reality technology. As a result, NVDF training pods are a familiar sight to every NVDF recruit, even if they aren’t offered many chances to train in the simulated valko cockpits. But with the placement exam schedule communicated well in advance, the prevailing mood is a flux of excitement and anxiety as everyone hopes for the chance to prove themselves. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>Commander “Raptor” Wano’s voice issues a disembodied message as his training assistant, Lieutenant Bastian-5, helps the recruits into individual cockpits in the training center’s testing chamber. “Recruits! Today is your placement exam. Do well and you might find yourself in the 3rd battlegroup as the 13th, 14th, or even 15th Valko squadron under my command! Thanks to an agreement with Storyteller Productions, today’s exam will feature colossi from the popular Kaiju Riot holovid series. As you know Lt. Bastian-5 is a huge fan of those movies—time to make them proud. Today you get to be the heroes!”</p>
                   </blockquote>

                   <br>
                   <h4>Culture or Profession (Charisma-based) (Recall Knowledge)</h4>
                   <p>The <em>Kaiju Riot!</em> series of films is well-known on Daimalko and has small cult followings all over the galaxy. NVDF recruits have likely seen one or more of the films and that film knowledge could help them in the upcoming simulation. For more benefits of watching these films, see <strong>Trivial Knowledge</strong>, below.</p>
                   <p><strong>10+:</strong> The <em>Kaiju Riot!</em> series follows the often-terrible exploits of a lone colossus, Gadrakor. In early films, Gadrakor brutally destroyed several Daimalkan settlements. Critics applaud these early films for teaching the benefits of environmentalism through cinematic media. Eventually, Gadrakor became a hero, defending Daimalko against unspeakable horrors.</p>
                   <p><strong>15+:</strong> Pop star Jollys Vass got her start with the hit <em>Don’t Fall</em>, a ballad written from the perspective of two damai lovers who were separated during Gadrakor’s rampage in <em>Kaiju Riot! 1</em>. In that film, Gadrakor’s characteristics were based on questionable information about an illusive colossus called a drakogor. In the years since, groundbreaking field research about real drakogors has provided new material for the sequels.</p>
                   <p><strong>20+: </strong>In <em>Kaiju Riot! 3: The Doom from Beyond,</em> Gadrakor teams up with a nearly invulnerable mechanical version of himself from the previous film, Mechagadrakor, to face a demonic version of himself, the space emperor colossus King Gadrakor.</p>
                   <p><strong>25+:</strong> Gadrakor and his iterations have all the same abilities as a real drakogor: they can absorb energy attacks to power their breath weapons, which deal sonic damage, and have a hardened mantle that adds to their natural armor. Encourage the PCs to swap out their simulated mechs’ weapons to avoid giving the enemy an advantage.</p>
                   <h4>The Mission</h4>
                   <p>The PCs’ simulated mechs begin in the center of Karnath, an ancient Daimalkan city lost to colossi attacks long ago. The simulation completes almost instantly, finalizing the holographic details of a breezy spring afternoon with streets empty except for the PCs. A Daimalkan orb rests in a hollow built into the bronze statue the PCs’ mechs are positioned around. Four wide streets wind in all four cardinal directions leading away from the monument. Tall office buildings and empty residences line each block except for the planetary transit landing pad northwest of the PCs.</p>
                   <p>When the PCs are ready to begin, Commander Wano’s voice gives the final orders before the simulation begins. “The Gadrakors have only one goal: Destroy the orb. To pass this exam, you only have to stop them. Defeat all your enemies and protect the orb. Good luck, recruits.”</p>
                   <p><strong>PCs and Mechs:</strong> This encounter is designed for four level 2 PCs. As part of their ongoing training at the NVDF Academy, the PCs have been learning the ins and outs of various mech configurations to better prepare them to their assignments as huzkars in the new modular Apex valkos, or as support crew for others who are assigned that role. As a result, players should create Tier 2 mechs for their PCs using the rules in <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em>.</p>
                   <p><strong>Map:</strong> This simulation uses the monument side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Metropolis.</em> The PC’s mechs begin the encounter huddled in the middle of the map around the monument. 1 square represents 10 feet of terrain.</p>
                   <p><strong>Trivial Knowledge:</strong> Watching the <em>Kaiju Riot! </em>film series has given the PCs prior knowledge of their opponents’ capabilities. The PCs can attempt the normal Recall Knowledge checks to identify their foes’ abilities prior to the beginning of the encounter. They may attempt these checks using Culture or an appropriate Profession skill instead, using the same DCs.</p>
                   <p><strong>Creatures</strong>: The three holographic colossi the PCs face are inspired by the popular holovid, <em>Kaiju Riot 3: The Doom from Beyond</em>. The three kaiju begin the encounter near the edges of the map and have a single goal in mind: destroy the orb at the center of the monument the PCs are protecting. The colossi act well as a team, contrary to their adversarial roles in <em>Kaiju Riot 3</em>. King Gadrakor relies on its roar and fearsome presence to throw the PCs off, while Gadrakor tries to draw them away from the monument or take them out with its breath weapon. Mechagadrakor is the key to their strategy. If nobody attacks Mechagadrakor, it moves adjacent to the monument and spends the next two turns attacking the orb. The other two eventually attempt the same tactic until the PCs target them with attacks. All three colossi fight until they are destroyed.</p>

                   <p><strong>Development</strong>: The orb has 100 Hit Points. If it takes enough damage to reduce it to 0 or below, the orb is destroyed and the simulation ends in failure. If the PCs manage to defeat their foes, the simulation ends in victory the moment the last Gadrakor falls and the opening chords to Jollys Vass’ triumphant <em>Don’t Fall</em>start to play.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                   <p>If the PCs successfully protect the orb, when the simulation ends they are formally offered spots in the NVDF’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Battlegroup as huzkar recruits. The next step in their training will be piloting brand new Apex mechs! If the simulation ends in failure, the PCs can enter remedial training before attempting the placement exam again, or accept positions in Valko Support, Infantry, Tank command groups, or even as Skywatch air support pilots.

                   <p>Of course, this book had its own crew in the form of wonderful writers and designers who each brought a taste of the wild to the project and were sure to keep the writers’ room well supplied with animal gifs and links to nature documentaries.

                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3>
                   <p>When James pitched <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, I was immediately hooked! I want to bring a sense of embodiment to TTRPGs so that players and GMs have tools to understand what it might be like to live in a world so fantastic, so I was looking forward to focusing an Attenborourgh-style lens on Golarion’s natural world. While working on my sections—the athamaru ancestry, holdfast, some of the big game siege weapons, and the Warden of Caverns and Burrows—I hoped to make the world seem fantastical from its skies to its lowest depths. This book is going to be a great tool as I continue to run my own games and design adventures, and I can't wait to see how everyone uses it in their games.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Chris Bissette (he/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I'm Chris Bissette, a game designer from the UK. Writing for Pathfinder has been a dream of mine for over a decade at this point, and I'm delighted to have finally had the opportunity on <em>Howl of the Wild</em>. Monsters were my first love in RPGs and getting to put together the dischorans for this book was some of the most fun I've had writing games.</p>
                   <p>When I'm not writing for Pathfinder, I can usually be found working on my free and very imaginatively titled dungeon crawler <a href="https://loottheroom.itch.io/a-dungeon-game">A Dungeon Game</a>. On socials, you can find me on Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loottheroom.bsky.social">@loottheroom.bsky.social</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>I wrote the ostilli host archetype for <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, the anti-behemoth weaponry (anybody catch the Godzilla reference in there?), and the decapod dinghy, which is basically Catbus as a giant crab. Contributing to this wonderful celebration of nature's finest offerings was a nice shift, as it immediately followed the work I did to redesign Linvarre for the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>, which should now be in everyone’s hands. I've also penned some rad stuff for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> and have several unannounced Pathfinder contributions in the pipelines.</p>
                   <p>Outside of the Paizo sphere, my biggest project is <a href="https://www.threesailsstudios.com/mappamundirpg">Mappa Mundi: An Exploration + Ecology RPG</a> for Three Sails Studios, a small three-man company based in the UK. It's a TTRPG about mapping the wilderness, studying monsters like a biologist instead of fighting them, and returning the art of storytelling to a voiceless world. Our recently released playtest could be used in conjunction with <em>Howl of the Wild</em> to run a gorgeous, monster-observing campaign that spans Golarion and beyond, since the themes are quite similar! Mappa Mundi's full release will crowdfund in 2025, so if you're interested, please follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelGrotto">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pixelgrotto.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> for the latest news.</p>

                   <p>Hey folks! I’m Brite (pronounced Bright), a TTRPG freelancer and prop maker. You might have seen my recent Pathfinder Quest, <em>The Winter Queen’s Dollhouse</em>, among other works. I had a blast writing a narrative section for <em>Howl of the Wild</em> and trying to capture Baranthet’s unique voice. He is so inquisitive and adventurous, yet simultaneously levelheaded. I hope you all enjoy meeting the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> and all the other wonders hidden in this book. I also hope your players “enjoy” the marp and its adorable gold-eating habits.</p>
                   <p>When not writing for or playing games, I make and sell hand-crafted props and accessories for TTRPG, cosplay, and LARP. You can find links to all my work, including where to contact me for custom commissions, at <a href="https://linktr.ee/mrgwillickers">https://linktr.ee/mrgwillickers</a>.

                   <p>Hello, hello! I've been around the Paizo blog quite a bit this past year since joining the marketing team, but I'm super excited to be dropping myself into this blog—because <em>Howl of the Wild</em> is the first Pathfinder project I’ve ever written for! A thousand thanks to James Case for scooping me out of the river for this project and giving me an opportunity to work on Pathfinder. It's opened a number of doors for me, and I love getting to be a part of the game I love (and market, haha). For Howl, I worked on the hexmoth and the zoophonia muse, and I look forward to seeing what everyone does with the cool stuff in this book! Please feel free to @ me on socials about your Howl stuff. I want to see it!</p>

                   <h3>Matthew Fu (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Hi everyone! I first wanted to say that it was a fantastic experience to be able to work on this project alongside so many other talented writers. Getting to see so much positive feedback on the creatures that I wrote (apothecary bee and hardhead mole) has already done numbers to lift my spirits, and seeing someone refer to my beastmaster feats as "swanky AF" really made my day. I wanted to give a quick shoutout to James Case and the rest of the Paizo team for having me on this project and allowing me to pour my heart and soul into this project. I can't wait to see what kind of characters my friends and the community at large come up with given the sheer quantity of high-quality work that can be found in this book.</p>

                   <h3>Steve Hammond</h3>
                   <p>Hello everyone! I'm Steve Hammond, and I wrote a few beast items, the tardigrades, and had the distinct pleasure of writing the surki ancestry! They are the first ancestry I've written, and my time working on them was really special. The response to them so far has been great, and I can't wait to see more of the characters you create with them!</p>
                   <p>I'm not really on social media these days, but I pop up in a few books here and there. Most recently, I worked on <em>War of Immortals</em>. Thank you all for your lovely words and praise for the book. Everyone on this team did incredible work, and I cannot wait to work with them again.</p>

                   <h3>Dustin Knight (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! I'm Dustin Knight, Starfinder developer and proud freelancer for the incredible tome of beasts and critters that lies before you! Working on the swarmkeeper archetype was a blast and fulfilled one of my long-time bucket-list entries of designing an insect-themed archetype. While I've yet to incorporate my own swarm of creepy-crawlies, I'm a big fan of bugs, especially bees! If you'd like to help your local pollinators, you can find resources such as Lawns to Legumes that can help turn your yard into a pollinator's paradise.</p>
                   <p>I also wrote some of the spells in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, including <em>antlion trap</em>, <em>summon stampede</em>, and <em>summon warden of the wild</em>. You can catch me on dozens of different Paizo-adjacent Discord servers, including my own for <a href="https://discord.com/invite/JBERvMFVtJ">Pathfinder Infinite creators and fans</a> under the username KitsuneWarlock. You can also catch me at PaizoCon on the Paizo Events Discord where I'll be answering questions, posting memes, and participating in some panels! I'd love to answer as many of your questions as I can and hear about the insects you'll be using with your future swarmkeepers!</p>

                   <p>Greetings and salutations! This was my first ever TTRPG writing experience, and I’m so grateful to James Case and the whole team for their support. I had the unique privilege of writing up the <em>Zoetrope</em>’s design and seeing it be brought to life by the artists was an incredible experience I’ll never forget. Working with Paizo really set the standard for what I expect as a freelance writer. I can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on this special book.</p>
                   <p>I’m currently working on some other TTRPG projects, all of which will be announced in time on <a href="https://twitter.com/carpechristi">Twitter</a>. You can find me at @carpechristi on all socials. In the meantime, I love streaming TTRPG Actual Plays with my friends (which, let’s be real, are just paid opportunities to flirt with each other), collecting special edition novels, and crocheting absurdly long scarves.</p>

                   <p>Howdy! I'm Jonathan, and I wrote the rumindrol and the beast guns for <em>Howl of the Wild</em>! This book was my first experience writing for Pathfinder and Paizo in general, and I'm happy to say I thoroughly enjoyed the creative spirit and collaborative nature of working on this book alongside so many talented people! I hope you use the rumindrol to remind players who think nothing of stepping into the dark, forbidden places of the world that there is a reason we fear the unknown, and I hope that the beast guns help you attain the gunslingin', yeehawin', fantasy-anime-nonsense vibes so many of us enjoy. You can find me nerding out and/or yeehawing over on <a href="https://twitter.com/ry0masa">Twitter</a> (I will never call it anything else) or reach out through my <a href="https://ryomasa.carrd.co/">website</a>.</p>

                   <p>Dave Nelson is a queer and neurodivergent freelance writer and editor with multiple credits for Pathfinder. This time, he put his degree in Classics to work to bring you the minotaur ancestry and the bestiary section on hydras. They also spent hours throwing cat toys while writing the clawdancer archetype, and they watched nature videos of birds for the winged warrior archetype. He also managed to write a few new spells, like <em>divine beasts</em> and <em>albatross’ curse</em>.</p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-American historian, educator, and author. I’m also a Pathfinder author of long standing—if you’ve suffered at the hands of a kholo, been lost in the <em>Dark Archive</em>, or had to dodge a laser-bear, that is my fault. I regret nothing.</p>
                   <p>In this particular venture, I was responsible for writing the merfolk ancestry, the sky fisher, and the character of my beloved buggy protégé, Ten. The merfolk ancestry was a particularly interesting challenge—usually, the trick with ancestries is filling them out, but here, we had a veritable buffet of myth, legend, and pop culture to choose from. If you want to weep tears of pearl, lure sailors to their doom with your voice, or merely stroll down the harbor walk with your new pair of legs, <em>Howl of the Wild</em> has you covered.</p>
                   <p>And if you like the sky fisher, well, would you like to know where you can find even more horrific beasties? It just so happens that I am also the creative director for the Luminant Age Campaign Setting, and we have a small bestiary of vampire dogs and teleporting rats over at <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io/">https://luminant-age.itch.io/</a>.

                   <p>Hello everyone! I’m Kai, and contributing to the <em>Howl of the Wild</em> team as a freelancer was my first foray into professional writing. I had a blast and hope to do it again in the future!</p>
                   <p>It was my joy and privilege to help bring Dr. Gulnara Pom to life, as well as provide some new animal companions, beast armor, and beast armaments. As a child, I was heavily influenced by Brian Jacques’ <em>Redwall</em> series and jumped at the opportunity to create my very own badger. As a Forever DM/GM, my approach for the items and animal companions was to provide players with interesting or surprising things that I would love to see at my own table. Personally, I’m looking forward to seeing art of a giraffe in full barding or anything flying squirrel related! As far as items go, my favorite was a particularly stinky maul. I love when I can utilize a piece of equipment for roleplaying! The best place to find me is <a href="https://twitter.com/KeenKoala">@KeenKoala</a> on Twitter/X.</p>

                   <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hi, fellow nature enthusiasts! I'm so excited for you all to tag along with Baranthet and the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> on their quest for the wardens of the wild. This has been my favorite book to work on so far, both as a writer and an edit lead, and I can't wait for everyone else to dive in (or burrow, if that's more your Speed). In addition to co-creating Baranthet with James, I got to write Baranthet's narrative introduction, conclusion, and the climactic chapter of the crew's adventure! I also upheld my contractual obligation to seed mushrooms into everything I do by way of the primal witch patrons. There are such fun new creatures, lore, and player options in this book, and I know I'm not the only one ready to build at least six new PCs.</p>
                   <p>I'm difficult to track down on social media these days, but you can always send notes to Almas University, c/o Baranthet Zamendi—he'll know where to find me.</p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Kendra, frequent freelancer for Paizo (credits at <a href="https://klspeedling.com/">klspeedling.com</a>). For <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, I did the bio for Charikleia, the Techniques and Tricks story, the sharks (my favorite ocean creatures!), and the Warden of Peaks and Skies.</p>
                   <p>When writing, I had to decide the type of contest to choose the new warden. A sky race made sense for flying creatures, but I didn’t want it to be that straightforward. I thought about what qualities the wardens might value, and one that jumped out to me was the interconnection of the natural world; while nature can be harsh and unforgiving, nothing within it exists in isolation, and I felt the wardens would be mindful of that. Maybe the true test would be the candidates’ willingness to aid others and accept help in turn. I wondered if it was too trite, too saccharine. But I decided that if I often need the reminder that assistance isn’t cheating or failure, just a part of existence, well… maybe someone else might need that, too.</p>
                   <p>The storm’s rough out there. Help others fly if you can, and don’t begrudge yourself the need to shelter under someone else’s wing for a while.</p>

                   <p>Hello everyone! I'm Kyle, a writer from the Philippines, and this is my first time writing for Paizo! For this book, I had the pleasure of introducing everyone to your favorite navigator, Lythea, and writing the thunder snake! I've written my own tabletop RPGs as well as writing for other people’s games, and I've also published my fair share of short stories, all of which you can find at <a href="https://whatkylewrites.carrd.co/">https://whatkylewrites.carrd.co/</a>.</p>
                   <p>I LOVE mermaids, so it is with absolute joy that I took on the task of bringing Lythea to life! She's basically the kind of character I'd love to play in a campaign of exploration, at one with the land, sea, and sky thanks to adaptive technologies giving her the best of all worlds. The thunder snake concept came to me by looking at electrical cords and adjustable lamps, watching the way coils and wires moved—so you can imagine it like a giant electrical plug!</p>

First, I'd like to say how proud I am to have contributed to this cool book alongside other fantastic authors. Field biology was one of my favorite undergrad classes, and seeing this book come together has brought me an untold amount of joy. Only one thing could make this better for me, and that's if all of you would share your favorite parts of the book. Now, maybe you're wondering, "That's cool, Ruvaid, but what did you work on?"</p>
                   <p>Surprise, dear reader, for I have seeded a trail to answer that very question—one that can be found by tracing steps back through these sentences of mine.</p>
                   <p>That's right, it was the griffon section! Well, that, and some of the beast armaments and alchemical items.</p>
                   <p>I hope you guys enjoy this awesome book. There's a ton of cool things in here that I can't wait to play with for myself.</p>

                   <p>Under surprising new leadership, the Wildwood Lodge begins a campaign of violence. Shocked, the PCs and their allies form a new lodge in exile to oppose this new regime.

If the PCs are to prevail, they will need to track down one of the Verduran Forest’s most dangerous inhabitants and convince her to aid their cause—or ensure she cannot aid their enemy.</p>

                   <p>For years, Zo (the city) and Zo! (the bombastic undead media mogul) have been engaged in a legal dispute over their shared name. Finally, both parties have agreed to a trial on the planet of Triaxus to put the matter to rest for good. In a bold move, Zo! calls in a favor from the Starfinder Society, requisitioning a team of Starfinders to represent him in the trial. Make your case to the jury, ready your counterargument, participate in a trial by combat against a team of crack combat-lawyers, and smile for the camera in the live broadcast of the decade!</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 3rd- through 6th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>Poorer citizens of Kaer Maga, the City of Strangers, have been going missing, and while many think they've simply left to emigrate to New Thassilon, a purported haven for outcasts, an independent journalist feels that there's something unsavory going on. Kaer Maga doesn't have much in the way of authorities, and those who hold any power aren't taking her seriously, so she's turned to the Pathfinder Society. The PCs need to figure out what's going on, and if it is unsavory, perhaps put a stop to it.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society has heard reports of a ship sighted over and over, apparently following the same path before vanishing each week. This unfortunate ship is stuck in time, repeating the same week over and over. The crew has tried everything to escape this fate, and gave up years of the same week ago. The PCs must find a way to return things to normal and save the crew from an eternity of this single week.</p>

                   <p>The Exo-Guardians faction once maintained an impressive fortress known as Sangoro's Bulwark. Years ago, mysterious forces attacked the bulwark, and the fortress was lost. Now, under the command of Ixthia the Unbreakable, the Starfinder Society launches a massive operation to reclaim Sangoro’s Bulwark, rescue any survivors, and destroy the foul forces that dared take the lives of the Starfinders stationed there. The battle for Sangoro’s Bulwark has begun!</p>

Over the years, the Infinite Masters have provided some of the best-in-class titles to pair with your adventures.</p>
                   <p><em>“One of my greatest joys each month is getting to write a blog showcasing the top performing and newest releases on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite. The Infinite creators have such amazing ideas, and I’m always looking forward to what they’re cooking up next.” –</em>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe) | Marketing &amp; Media Specialist</p>
                   <p>The Infinite Masters Program is currently by invitation only; DriveThru and Paizo take suggestions from the community about who would be great fits for the program. Infinite Masters offer support to one another, giving suggestions and constructive criticism, and fostering collaboration that has been part of our best sellers in recent years.</p>
                   <p><em>“Despite the vast amount of content for Pathfinder and Starfinder we generate at Paizo, our long production timelines and resource limitations mean that we can neither be as nimble or prolific as our community sometimes demands. Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite allow the community to meet their own demands for MOAR! and with much more responsive timelines. Seeing the professional and inspired creations of the Infinite community are a great joy, and provide an incredible amount of encouragement to all of us here at Paizo.”</em> –Mark Moreland (he/him) | Director of Brand Strategy</p>
                   <p>There is no end to the Infinite community’s imagination; Masters continue to surprise us with every single release. The group has grown since its inception, with new creators invited every few months. They generate some of the coolest content to pair with your Pathfinder and Starfinder adventures and we’re grateful for not only their creativity, but their willingness to be so communicative and open about their hopes about the program.</p>
                   <p>While this is only a handful of Infinite Masters in this Infinite Masters Spotlight, we hope that you check out all the Infinite Masters and take their incredible releases with you on your next journey!</p>

                   <p>Originally designated “Pacific/Asian American Heritage Week” in 1977, AANHPI Month was codified into the American calendar of holidays and heritage months in 1992. Each year, the Federal Asian Pacific American Council (FAPAC) dedicates a new theme for AANHPI Month, giving a focal point to how we celebrate the contributions of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders. The theme of this year’s AANHPI Month is “Advancing Leaders Through Innovation.”</p>
                   <p>According to the FAPAC press release, this theme “pays homage to the visionaries and trailblazers who have shaped our AANHPI history and continue to influence our collective future.” Anyone can help uplift these current and future leaders by supporting organizations that foster AANHPI creatives, support AANHPI mental health, and provide opportunities to AANHPI youth. The following list is non-exhaustive, but a good start for people looking to volunteer or donate:</p>

                   <h3>Valko Derby — CR (varies)</h3>
                   <p>Valkopods—more often called mech pods in the Pact Worlds—are specialty game consoles found at high-end arcades, military recruitment centers, trade shows, and in the homes of some affluent collectors. The 6-foot half-globe pods are constructed of durable plastics with transparent aluminum and structural steel frames. The pods are programmed to simulate the experience of being in the cockpit of a mech, starship, or other war vehicle. Hyper-realistic terrain and foes generated by the simulation provide a challenge for the operator, and the simulation provides a score based on the operator’s reactions and maneuvers.</p>
                   <p>Valkpods aren’t just for fun. A form of this technology is used for military training in the Pact Worlds, Veskarium, and on Daimalko, where the tech was initially tested. Networking connections allow many pods to sync simulations for large-scale experiences while the simulated feeds are broadcast to viewing terminals, betting houses, and infosphere sites. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>

                   <blockquote>
                    <p>Holos blast a hypercolored message above a row of globular arcade cabinets, each large enough for a person of any conceivable anatomy to fit comfortably inside. “Mech pods—Play Now!” The signs repeating flash is accompanied by booming music and the roar of simulated laser cannons. A humanoid pilot dressed in a red and white suit stands outside the massive cabinets. A crowd of excited people bustle around her. “Hey there! Ever ride in a mech before?” She calls. “Now’s your chance. Our sponsor, Apex, installed this set of networked valkopods—you call them mech pods in the Pact Worlds. Apex engineers programmed a special simulation just for today: A demolition derby! Want to play?”</p>

                   <p><strong>Resa "Firefight"&nbsp;Prosst</strong> (LN female ifrit) is a decorated pilot. After acing her training, she was promoted quickly to squad leadership and earned a role as DCVG (Deputy Commander Valko Group) of the 3rd Battlegroup of the New Valor Defense Force, a military sworn to protect the city of New Valor from rampaging colossi. She’s not just here for public relations—she’s tasked with recruiting high-scoring players to join up with the NVDF.</p>
                   <p>On Daimalko, huzkars (the local name for mech pilots) are minor celebrities as well as military personnel. Most Daimalkans regard mech pilots as heroes since many are injured or even perish defending cities from colossi, terrifying monsters that move through populated settlements like unstoppable forces of nature. Without mechs, Daimalko would be unlivable; in fact, the entire planet was decimated by the colossi’s first emergence many years ago. Rebuilding has only been possible because of organizations like the NVDF.</p>
                   <h3>Derby Rules</h3>
                   <p>Once the derby program loads, the PCs find themselves virtually piloting humanoid-shaped Daimalkan mechs within a massive digital stadium divided into zones by glowing markings. Each team begins the match in the goal zone that matches their team’s colors. The PCs are blue and begin in the southern zone. Enemy players’ mechs are red and begin in the northern zone.</p>
                   <p>As soon as the starting siren sounds, the teams can move around the map and engage their foes. Roll initiative to determine the order in which players and enemies act. Teams score points in two ways. If a mech makes it to the opposing goal, the pilot scores 2 points for their team. If a pilot scores a final blow on an enemy mech (destroying it), they score 4 points for their team. If a mech is destroyed, it cannot score points even if it is already inside the enemy goal, and that player (PC or enemy) is out of the battle for the remainder of the match. During the match, a glowing holographic display above the simulated stadium displays each team’s current score. Once all mechs on one team have been defeated or six rounds have passed, the match ends. The entire field glows in the winning team’s colors as a victory celebration and final scores are displayed.</p>
                   <p><strong>The Map:</strong> This simulation uses the digital side of <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Stadium</em>. One square on the map represents 10 feet to accommodate the Huge combatants. The programmed terrain simulates a massive sports arena. Once the match begins, the tiered bleachers are filled with a simulated audience. Any mech that moves into (or is forced into) spaces outside the play area and into the crowd suffers an automatic system failure based on the chart found in <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution </em>page 114. Enemy mechs forced into the crowd are staggered until they return to the play area.</p>
                   <p>The glowing circle in the middle of the arena temporarily boosts a mech’s movement speed. Whenever a mech begins its turn inside the circle, the mech’s base speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
                   <p><strong>PCs and Mechs:</strong> This encounter is designed for four 1st-level characters. The mech pods are programmed to use simulated representations of dozens of different mechs, but for this program, all players use the same type of mech: the duello class valko. For the duration of the simulation, the PCs’ mechs have blue glowing stripes to differentiate them from their opponents, which are red. If you’d prefer to adapt the simulation for different mech models, the PCs can instead build tier 1 mechs using the rules in <em>Tech Revolution</em>.</p>
                   <p>The basic duello class mech is detailed below.</p>
                   <h3>Duello Class Valko — Tier 1</h3>
                   <p>Huge skirmisher<br><strong>Operators</strong> 1; <strong>PP</strong> 1 (2/turn, max 6)<br><strong>Speed</strong> 60 ft.<br><strong>Senses</strong> blindsense (vibration) 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., low-light vision</p>
                   <p><strong>DEFENSE</strong><br><strong>HP </strong>19; <strong>SP</strong> 5; <strong>Hardness</strong> 0<br><strong>EAC</strong> 19; <strong>KAC</strong> 20<br><strong>Fort</strong> +3; <strong>Ref</strong> +4<br><strong>Immunities</strong> construct immunities</p>
                   <p><strong>OFFENSE</strong><br><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong> +8<br><strong>Melee</strong> scythe (upper limb—1d6+5 S)<br><strong>Ranged</strong> laser rifle (frame—1d6+1 F; critical burn), missile battery (frame—1d4+1 F&amp;P)<br><strong>Space</strong> 15 ft.; <strong>Reach</strong> 15 ft. (20 ft. with scythe)<br><strong>Strength</strong> +4</p>
                   <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> The simulation always pits teams against their each other in even numbers. So, for each PC, one opposing duello mech appears with red glowing stripes inside the opposing goal. The enemy mechs are piloted by other players in their own valkopods networked together with the PC’s valkopods.</p>
                   <p>As soon as the sirens denote the start of the derby, the two duello opponents on the outside edges of the opposing team run up the sides of the arena. They intend to get to the blue goal as fast as possible and lend fire support to their allies from there. The remaining enemy mechs choose individual targets, focusing on PCs who lead the charge across the arena. They use up as much ammo as possible from a distance before switching to scythes for melee combat. All enemy mechs fight until destroyed.</p>
                   <br>

                   <p><strong>Development</strong>: If either team moves all surviving mechs into the opposing goal zone, the simulation ends and that team wins. If either team defeats every enemy mech, they win by default. If both teams end the derby with an equal number of combatants in the opposing goal, the simulation resets, allowing all players to return and try again.</p>
                   <p>When the match ends, the PCs exit their valkopods and notice a crowd watching a holovid of their match. Firefight’s eyes are intent on the screen as she takes notes on a datapad. She gets the PCs’ attention as soon as she notices them.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>GREETINGS HUZKAR! YOU HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY THE NEW VALOR DEFENSE FORCE</h3>
                   <p>Firefight takes note of players who show enthusiasm and skill during the simulated battles. She sees the PCs’ potential and eagerly tries to recruit them. If the PCs beat their opponents, she plays to their egos, praising them and saying that “New Valor needs your help,” or “all of Daimalko is in danger!” If they lost the match, she asks if they’d like another shot at winning, but “for real this time.” She answers the PCs’ questions about her organization, explaining that they’re a military corps who defend the city of New Valor from colossi attacks. They’re based on the distant planet Daimalko (unless the PCs begin this encounter on Daimalko, they’ll need to take a shuttle there for further training). If the PCs are interested in joining, she sets up an appointment for them at a nearby recruiting office where they can fill out formal applications and complete their physical assessment.</p>
                   <h3>VALKO DERBY COMPETITIVE PLAY</h3>
                   <p>If players are interested in using the Valko Derby rules for PVP matches, replace the NPC mechs with even teams of players. If there’s an odd number of players, include an NPC to fill the empty slot.</p>
                   <p><strong>Map:</strong> Firefight specifically programmed this Valko Derby to reference her love of the sport kaijuball, but any map can be holographically recreated for a battle. Throwing in cover and level-appropriate hazards or traps isn’t just an option, it’s encouraged!</p>
                   <p><strong>Mechs:</strong> The duello class valkos are perfect mechs for low-level PCs, but if your players want to customize their own, build mechs appropriate to the average level of the PCs using the rules in<em> Tech Revolution</em>. Both sides should build their mechs with the same amount of Mech Points in their pool and should limit movement to ground based for a fair challenge.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Welcome! We’re a week out from PaizoCon and you’ve got a whole slate of reveals for new stuff to look forward to: <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em>,<em>Pathfinder War of Immortals</em>, <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, the list goes on! But some of you might be looking back thinking, “Sure all this new stuff is great, but I’d really love some updates and clarifications for some of these books I bought right before the remaster started.”</p>
                   <p>Well, good news! We’ve got a slate of errata for you. Right about now, you should find some new entries over at <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq">https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq</a> for <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Firebrands</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ll let you read those entries to see the specifics, but some highlights include a broad update in the <em>Ancestry Guide</em> entry for re-standardizing the flight feats of certain ancestries like sprites and strix to bring them more in line with the new standard we’ve set for ancestries with inherent flight following the Remaster. We’ve also got a swath of minor updates to combination weapons to align with the new standard set by the swap function of the Interact action in the Remaster, and some much requested clarifications for <em>Rage of Elements</em>.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8a7a3dd4-5889-4706-b175-50358398b905/PZO2112_Grimoires_HalfPage_2000x1333.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8a7a3dd4-5889-4706-b175-50358398b905/PZO2112_Grimoires_HalfPage_2000x1333.jpg" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Ezren with the magic grimoire"></a>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>This also marks the beginning of a return to normalcy for us following the flurry of activity around the OGL events of last year and the need for us to pivot to the Remaster project and the introduction of the ORC license. With all of that in the rearview mirror and a clear road leading into a bright blue horizon ahead, we’re looking to get back on track for the annual errata cycle we had announced right before those plans got altered. As part of this pivot, we want to set some clear expectations for what the future we’re working toward is going to look like for FAQs and errata.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardcover Rulebooks: </strong>This includes books like <em>Player Core</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Rage of Elements</em>, etc. Our goal for this product line is for it to receive two errata and FAQ cycles per year on an as-needed basis, one in the spring/summer and one in the fall/winter. This current drop is the spring/summer cycle, so you can expect one more errata update before the end of the year!</li>
                    <li><strong>Lost Omens Books: </strong>This line of books will receive one errata and FAQ update cycle per year on an as-needed basis, coinciding with one of the two hardcover rulebook cycles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adventures: </strong>Our Adventure Path line is a monthly periodical and the player content produced in it is intended for use with the associated adventures. The standard for player content presented in adventures is that it is of uncommon or rare rarity and directly tied to the story it is presented with; using this content outside of the associated adventure inherently requires GM review and approval (or appropriate sanctioning for use in Pathfinder Society organized play). We do not currently have any plans at this time to include adventure content in a scheduled errata cycle. We may still do errata around particular reprints, such as when compiling an adventure for a hardcover release.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>So, that’s our roadmap for the errata and FAQs going forward! If you’re planning on playing some Pathfinder Society games at PaizoCon, make sure to check for any updates your character might have received!</p>
                   <p>Catch you next time!</p>

                   <p>Greetings Pathfinders!</p>
                   <p>This month we’re heading out west, with one scenario set in Kaer Maga, a place we haven’t been for some time, and another off the coast in waters near the Ironbound Archipelago.</p>
                   <p>To start off, it seems poorer citizens of Kaer Maga, the City of Strangers, have been going missing, and while many think they've simply left to emigrate to New Thassilon, a purported haven for outcasts, an independent journalist, Nellie Bow, feels that there's something unsavory going on. She’s found her investigation hampered by rumors spread by an unknown party. Without any other options, she's turned to the Pathfinder Society. It’ll be up to you to figure out what’s going on, and put a stop to anyone taking advantage of any desperate dreamers in the City of Strangers.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Meanwhile, our next scenario has its roots beginning years ago, with the return of Xin Edasseril from its exile outside of time. A ship off the coast of the reappearing city was somehow caught up in the eddies of released time. Though it’s been years, rumors have slowly spread and the Pathfinder Society has heard reports of a ship sighted over and over, apparently following the same path before vanishing each week. This is that same unfortunate ship. It seems it is somehow stuck in time, repeating the same week over and over. The crew has tried everything to escape this fate, and gave up years of the same week ago. You must find a way to return things to normal and save the crew from an eternity of this single week.</p>

                   <p></p>Commander Vadien “Raptor” Wano (LN male damai soldier) acts as commanding officer for the PCs and Tempest Squadron during their training and throughout their careers as huzkars—the Daimalkan name for a mech pilot or operator. Raptor is a seasoned huzkar, having piloted his mech against colossi and on mercenary missions in local systems. He was one of the first pilots selected for the launch of the program that became the New Valor Defense Force. Raptor is one of eight huzkars who fought every skirmish in the Month of Fire campaign and survived.

                   <h3>THE ENEMY</h3>
                   <p>Daimalko has been under attack by colossi—the Daimalkan name for kaiju, or giant monsters—for generations since the Awakening devastated the planet. Colossi come in a variety of forms, some more vicious and destructive than others. Recently, there seem to be more frequent attacks; something is causing aggressive behaviors to increase across species of colossi. Perhaps finding the cause will give your heroes an upper hand in the battle to save Daimalko?</p>

                   <p><em><br></em>But Raptor doesn’t expect you to fight alone! Throughout this campaign, you level up two characters: your hero and your mech—known on Daimalko as a valko! Eventually, you might add a starship form to that list. Most encounters in<em>Mechageddon!</em> are designed for mechs, but there are plenty of opportunities to show off your pilot’s abilities, too.</p>
                   <p>Everyone begins with a basic mech, choosing one of the lynkor models provided by the NVDF or a fully custom version if you prefer. Check out the <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/240503_PZO7253_Mechageddon_PlayersGuide.pdf"><em>Mechageddon!

It’s no secret that <em>Mechageddon!</em> was my dream project, but I’m not the only one who feels that way.

What we created together is special not just because of its epic story, unforgettable characters, gorgeous art, high CR encounters, and new rules content; it’s special because the whole team is so passionate about <em>Mechageddon!</em> and poured their hearts and souls into its creation.</p>
                   <p>This passion was evident in the extracurricular hangouts, playtests, and planning meetings the authors scheduled with and without me. To prepare for the writing phase, the writing team got together for a few movie nights. We watched a lot of epic anime and cheesy 80s movies, bonding over our shared passion for mecha media. It was important to us to highlight certain tropes and themes, and our time together created synergy between the adventures and backmatter articles. But don’t worry, <em>Mechageddon!</em>isn’t all anime sparkles and action movie schlock. (Not 100%, anyway.) The authors each brought their own perspectives to the project, pulling inspiration from their lived experiences, favorite media, and more.</p>
                   <p>On the surface, a tabletop campaign like <em>Mechageddon!</em> is a fun way to pass the time playing a game with your friends. But for many of us, it’s also a way to escape our problems and worries for a few hours. The magic of tabletop storytelling is that it can be a way to explore our dreams, desires, and fears in a safe setting, or a way to play out scenarios that imagine better worlds or tell cautionary tales of timelines gone wrong. In that respect, <em>Mechageddon!</em> can be whatever you want it to be, but here’s what it means to us.</p>

                   <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)<br>
                     Adventure 1 Author</h3>
                   <p>I was ten years old, the ideal age for mecha indoctrination, when <em>Robotech</em> hit American shores. Sure, I’d already enjoyed Americanized anime in <em>Battle of the Planets, Voltron</em>, and <em>Tranzor Z</em>, but <em>Robotech</em> was different. For the first time, there was character-driven, dramatic storytelling in an animated show about alien attacks and giant robot combat, and halfway through the first season, my favorite character died! This was a big change for cartoons in the states, and I was sold—hook, line, and sinker.</p>
                   <p>From there, my media interests changed. I immersed myself in the anime that were the basis of <em>Robotech: Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, Genesis Climber Mospeada,</em> and most importantly, <em>Super Dimension Fortress Macross</em>. My interests grew to encompass the <em>Fang of the Sun Dougram</em> and <em>Gundam</em>. While my friends identified with their heroes from He-man, GI Joe, and Thundercats, my tastes involved giant robots piloted by the types of heroes that propaganda movies could be made about. And don’t even get me started on kaiju!</p>
                   <p>My interest in games followed suit with a love of <em>BattleTech</em>, <em>Mekton</em>, and <em>Heavy Gear</em> taking up a great deal of my playtime. So, when my D20-based RPG of choice began building towards mecha stories, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. But I was lucky; I’d already written for Starfinder, and I had been running games for Paizo Organized Play since the beginning—I was a known quantity. Regardless, when Jenny asked if I would be interested in contributing to the project, there was nothing that could have kept me away.</p>
                   <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is one of the most fun projects I could ever have hoped to be a part of. For “research,” I watched a lot of movies, like <em>Pacific Rim</em> and <em>Robot Jox</em>, in addition to diving deep into some of the anime I’d missed over the years—especially the later <em>Macross</em> stuff (oh, how I missed you, <em>Macross</em>). There was a timely renewed interest in <em>BattleTech</em>, <em>Heavy Gear</em> got a new edition, and I had the opportunity to seed some of the tropes and brilliance of the shows I loved into my writing.</p>
                   <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is a love letter to the anime, films, and media that came before it. The adventure is full of dramatic moments and enough giant robot combat to whet any appetite. It’s an adventure where the people you meet matter and where encounters are harrowing and full of meaning, dropping hints and plot points for the future. It’s like no Adventure Path you’ve seen before. For my part, I worked alongside two of the best authors in the Paizosphere, and the three of us even met outside of our shared server to put together something of a story bible to inform our tale that could seed dozens more adventures! I envy you, fearless reader, for the journey you will get to experience and the stories you will tell.</p>
                   <p>Until that day, New Valor stands!</p>

                   <h3>Dennis Muldoon (he/him)<br>
                    Adventure 2 Author</h3>
                   <p><em>Mechaggedon!</em> Oh, what a joy! Over the last few years, I’ve written for nearly every line Paizo publishes, but this is without a doubt the biggest, most challenging, and most exciting project I’ve ever worked on. I love how Starfinder allows us to tell so many different types of stories, and the mech rules are one of my favorite tools in the GM toolbox. My own love for mechs dates to my childhood watching <em>Transformers</em>, <em>Voltron</em>, and of course, that seminal classic, <em>Robot Jox</em>.</p>
                   <p>For <em>Mechaggedon!</em>, I wrote the middle volume, the space where the plucky heroes get to catch their breath after the initial rush, take stock of their new careers as mech pilots and heroes of New Valor, and find their place in the wider universe. What could go wrong? This volume presents the players with choices to make, opportunities to build relationships and earn allies, and space to truly make their mechs their own. I’m particularly proud of the variety of missions presented in this volume, as they draw inspiration from sources ranging from space operas to westerns to real-world corporate labor politics, before ultimately tying together to lead to something bigger. I can’t wait for you all to play it!</p>

                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)<br>
                     Adventure 3 Author</h3>
                   <p><br>
                    I wish I could sit down and tell you every little detail I included in my volume of&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em> However, since I wrote the final book, that mean sharing major spoilers for the plot. Since I can't do&nbsp;<em>that</em>, I'd instead talk about my inspirations!</p>
                   <p><em>Devilman</em>&nbsp;is one of the most influential works of art I've ever experienced. It is also deeply weird and even unenjoyable at points, with a complex lore and timeline that honestly hurts my head to think about too much. For my adventure, I drew much on what I found meaningful about&nbsp;<em>Devilman</em>, from its corruption narratives, to the feelings of apocalypse it conveys, to downright weird demon designs.&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>(at least my section) is also deeply informed by my experience as a queer person, my relationship to religion, and the strange ways that religion might function in a world where you could meet many of the gods. My volume is in part about trying to fight an apocalypse you don't want to be in, but also about what it means to want love from a god who will never love you back. In that way, it's also about work, and about how many people believe that a job you love can never love you back.</p>
                   <p>Mech stories are also tied into stories about bodies. I finished writing&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>the day before I underwent gender-affirming surgery. In my section, there's many kinds of bodies and relationships to them: kaiju bodies, bodies that have changed (positive), bodies that have changed (negative), big robot bodies, and more. You also may be thinking, "Wow, Rigby, that's doing a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>!" Well, yes—but this adventure is also a deep dive into the mech genre and will be hopefully played across hundreds of hours with your friends. Many of these things end up naturally intertwined. The demands on the body are often the demands of capitalism, or the demands of patriarchy, or the interpolation of white supremacy into our own desires.</p>
                   <p>Okay, okay, that's the big philosophy. It's also about punching demons while being in a mech suit, the relationship you have with other pilots, and saving the world! The point is this: it’s going to be fun,it's going to be big, and it's going to be a story you'll remember!</p>

                    Hello! I’m Kate Baker, and I can’t wait for you to experience <em>Mechageddon!</em> I couldn’t resist contributing to an Adventure Path that lets the PCs run around in giant mechs. What could be better? I enjoyed watching <em>Pacific Rim</em>, <em>Robot Jox</em>, and even the dubious <em>Robot Wars</em> (on MST3k) to get inspiration. I worked on backmatter, creating both a mech that you’ll encounter and a Side Job you can go do for some extra cash. Just don’t forget to bring your mechs! You can follow more about what I’m up to on BlueSky at @katebakerGM.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Mechs are rad.Anyone who’s known me for any amount of time knows that I am a mecha fan, so taking part in&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>was an opportunity I immediately jumped at. I can distinctly remember walking into a bookstore in New Orleans in 1995, seeing this cool mech book on the shelf, and realizing that <em>MechWarrior&nbsp;</em>was more than just a one-off of the distant past.&nbsp;Many years later, a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Macross’&nbsp;</em>newest series helped to remind me that everyone loves giant robots no matter what flavor they come in. They have a magic to them that can be used to tell unique stories and lift spirits. In that way,&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>was something of a dream come true to work on, especially as I was able to design new mechs and had the opportunity to bring the city of New Valor to life. I hope that what we’ve put together can lift your spirits, wherever you are, and help you to remember love as you strive to defend New Valor.</p>

                   <p>Hey there! I'm Mikko, a cloud architect by day and a game designer when the stars come out. My journey as a Paizo freelancer began in 2014, and since then, I've left my creative mark on around 50 fantastic products. For&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em>, I wrote a Side Job in which you and your trusty mechs venture to a planet of dinosaurs. Get ready for high-speed thrills, breathtaking views of wind-kissed hills, steamy jungles, and fiery volcanoes, plus a hearty dose of head-banging riffs courtesy of Abysshead—the undisputed overlords of the Pact Worlds music scene. Hope you have a blast playing it!</p>
                   <p>My fascination with mechs and towering robots goes way back. My earliest influences came from shows like <em>Power Rangers</em> and <em>Transformers</em>, and who could forget that iconic moment when Ellen Ripley hops into a power loader and takes on a xenomorph queen? Legendary stuff. A newer fascination of mine is Scythe, a world that seamlessly weaves diesel-punk mechs into a reimagined 1920s setting.</p>
                   <p>Let me wrap up with a story. Flashback to 2017, when Paizo presented me with an intriguing challenge: writing an interactive special named&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom"><em>Assault on Absalom</em>&nbsp;</a>for the Pathfinder Society. One of the missions in that adventure involved unearthing an ancient weapon, and my imagination was on fire. What if this weapon took the form of a gargantuan construct? What if the players could pilot it, controlling distinct limbs and weapons? And so, Gulgamodh emerged—a sentinel that dutifully guarded Absalom and perhaps inspired the seeds of future mech wonders.</p>

                     Contributing Author</h3>
                   <p>I had a ton of fun writing an alien, a mech, and a Side Job for&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em> The first came easily after I found a video of a starfish walking along the beach. The creature's form was so familiar and yet so alien, so I thought of how I'd stat it if I turned it upside down and made it mech-sized. Considering its&nbsp;environment reminded me of the long history of otyughs as both violent monsters and a source of curious social encounters, a perfect fit for my armored junkyard behemoth. The latter two took some time, and ultimately became homages to my online Roll20 campaigns that withered as life got complicated.</p>
                   <p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy94qz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-79-The-HalfDead-City"><em>Mummy's Mask</em>&nbsp;</a>campaign fell off right after Book 5, when the PCs encountered the flying pyramids of ancient Osirion. Not having those mythical structures as some form of airborne vehicle in the Starfinder setting's distant future struck me as a ripe design space, especially for a book about mechs. Meanwhile, my&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie"><em>Fly Free or Die&nbsp;</em></a>campaign wound down in the middle of my own installment, <em>Crash and Burn</em>. The party was composed of eight people with variable schedules that usually led to split sessions of four PCs each, so I would write concurrent homebrew adventures alongside the published content so the two groups could swap stories offline. One of those original adventures involved an ecological mission to Osoro to study the irokirois, one of my favorite&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em>&nbsp;</a>creatures, which&nbsp;I adapted into what appears in <em>Mechageddon!</em> I hope you enjoy our work!</p>

                     Contributing Authors</h3>
                   <p>Nick and Fox have been writing together since Nick Wasko won Paizo's RPG Superstar Season 9 contest. Nick inspired Fox's interest in Pathfinder and Starfinder, and together they enjoyed creating new mechs for this Adventure Path. Nick and Fox drew upon their backgrounds in health care for the&nbsp;idea of the Hecatomb, which draws upon the operator's life force to function. High-level characters have plenty of health, so sacrificing hit points to power a mech made a better thematic and mechanical fit for a high-risk, high-reward playstyle among low-level players.</p>
                   <p>Meanwhile, the Terrotodile started out as a thought experiment for mechs designed for purposes other than combat. Its original intent was to protect laborers mining for resources, but like so many inventions meant for the betterment of society, it was repurposed for battle. Nick and Fox enjoyed this opportunity to explore a departure from the high-powered war machines often seen in this genre. Since they’ve recently struggled to make time for tabletop gaming, they are especially excited for the opportunity to contribute to this project. You can find more of Nick's work with Paizo <a href="https://paizo.com/people/NickWasko">here</a>, or his academic&nbsp;writing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=nicholas+wasko">here</a>.

                   <p style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve always enjoyed robots and mechs. I’ve been a huge <em>Transformers</em> fan since I was small, and I regularly build Gundam models (as well as watch the shows), so creating a mech was an opportunity I was excited for. I wanted to make something a little more unique, different from a robot with a theme. One of the best toy lines on the market, in my opinion, are the Diaclone Reboot figures. They’re super modular, so it’s easy to swap parts and make your own creations. I really like that, so I wondered: What if I could do that for a Starfinder mech? With that, the Mobile Disunion was born. Just like the Diaclone Reboot figures, the Mobile Disunion can be customized by players and their characters. Swap out the legs, the arms, the head—whatever you want! Like with a <em>Transformer</em>, you can even change the configurations in combat. I hope everyone enjoys playing with the Mobile Disunion as much as I enjoyed creating it (and playing with some of my toys while I did)!</p>

                     Narrative Lead and Contributing Author</h3>
                   <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is a love letter to one of my favorite things in all the universe: mechs. But you knew that. Now listen up, because I’m about to tell you a secret! I wasn’t really into mechs growing up. I know, I know; it’s SACRILEGE! But listen, the mecha media in the United States at that time targeted a more masc audience, and I was more of a princesses and ponies type of kid. If Sailor Moon had summoned a sparkly mech and fired its moon tiara magic laser, I would’ve been all in, but alas, that wasn’t on offer at the time. It wasn’t until much later in life that I discovered the joy of mechs that transform and power up to catchy music using the power of friendship.</p>
                   <p>One day a friend showed me a video clip from what would become my favorite mecha anime, <em>Macross Delta</em>. In the video, a group of magical girls team up with military mech pilots to defend a city from an alien attack, and they do it by <em>singing</em>. I desperately wanted more context for this video, so I dove into the show headfirst. Fast-forward to now: I’ve become a <em>Macross</em>superfan, a player of <em>MechWarrior</em>, a builder of model kits, and an all-around mecha enjoyer.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>What really draws me to mechs, though? First and foremost, mecha as a concept is inherently both badass and ridiculous, and there’s as many wonderfully absurd gems out there as there are epic, grimdark treatises on the realities of war and the nature of humanity. But I’ve identified some themes most mecha media shares, regardless of where they fall on the spectrum from military drama to super sentai. I’m inspired by these themes of friendship, loyalty, courage, and hope in the face of doom. And who among us wouldn’t hop into a gigantic robot and help their friends save the world if they had the chance?</p>
                   <p>Now’s your chance!</p>
                   <p>I should clarify that we’re not actually saving <em>the</em> world, but that we are going to save a planet in a TTRPG adventure. And for the record, while saving the real world isn’t part of this campaign, I encourage you to do your best at that, too.</p>
                   <p><strong>From all of us on the writing team, we truly hope you enjoy the book we made for you! Use it well. </strong></p>

                   <p>At Gen Con, we’ll be closing Year 5 of Pathfinder Society with our finale adventure for high-level characters. We’ll also be launching Year 6: Year of Immortal Influence with two brand-new scenarios that are fully compliant with the Remaster ruleset! Bring your new Player Core 2 characters and jump right into the action!</p>

                   <p>Our Pathfinder Special is always a packed house, and this year, we’re getting nautical! Characters from 1st through 8th-level can join us for our Saturday night marquee event. This event absolutely will sell out, and while we’ll try to seat as many walk-ups as possible, we make no guarantees. Note that we have pregenerated characters only up to 5th-level, so those playing at 7-8 tables must bring their own characters or be reseated.</p>

                   <p>We’ll also be offering a limited number of Pathfinder Quests! These shorter adventures have more seats reserved for walk-up players, though we have some early tickets on sale as well. Dip your toe into Golarion and join us at one of these tables!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Welcome to the <strong><a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/240508_Starfinder_FieldTest_5.pdf">fifth Starfinder Second Edition Field Test</a></strong>!</p>
                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">Starfinder Second Edition Playtest</a> is coming soon—but for some, August isn’t nearly soon enough! To give you some insight into the process of creating a new edition of Starfinder, the Starfinder team has released four Field Tests so far. These small snapshots of our work in progress have previewed three classes (the envoy, mystic, and soldier) as well as new ancestries. For our fifth Field Test, we’re doing something a bit different: encounters! So, it’s time to make some Starfinder characters, if you haven’t already. These Corpse Fleet raiders and Aeon Guard soldiers aren’t going to fight themselves! (<a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/240508_Starfinder_FieldTest_5.pdf">However entertaining that would be…</a>)</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Who needs regular zombies when we’ve got cybernetic zombies?<br>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>Field Test #5 includes two encounters, one for 1st-level characters and one for 5th-level characters. Each encounter includes everything a GM needs to throw their party right into the action: a basic narrative setup, a battle map, multiple enemy stat blocks, and enemy tactics. We’ve even included the text of our new weapon traits so you know how the enemies’ weapons work, and some discussion of our encounter design principles so you can see what we’re going for.</p>
                   <p>The first encounter tasks the player characters with defending a data center from Corpse Fleet privateers. If the initial encounter isn’t enough for you, there’s a bonus stat block for groups who want an extra challenge against a tough enemy! (Spoiler alert: some of you may die.)</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   <br>
                   <p>You’ll need 5th-level characters for the second encounter, which pits the player characters against a group of Aeon Guard troopers. Careful! Rumor has it that they’ve got some sort of ferocious beast protecting them. I’m sure it’ll be fine, though. You’re going to make an amazing Field Test character. And they totally absolutely won’t die. Definitely not!</p>
                   <p>In all seriousness, please feel free to use this content in whatever way you like. The Field Tests are only snapshots, and we realize that you can’t really create a full Starfinder party yet, unless you double up on some of the classes we’ve previewed so far. That’s okay! This content is meant as a preview. Have fun with it. Mix it up. Maybe give enemy stat blocks to the players and let them play out a Corpse Fleet vs. Aeon Guard battle royale!</p>
                   <p><strong>What’s next? When’s the playtest?!</strong><br>
                     It’s only a few short months until Gen Con 2024, when we’ll officially be releasing the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez4?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Rulebook"><strong>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</strong></a>! The PDF of the rulebook will be a free download, and you’ll also have the option of buying a softcover print book if you prefer a physical format for your playtest rules! We’re printing a limited quantity, so if you want a piece of Starfinder history, consider grabbing a copy.</p>
                   <p>Along with the rulebook, we’re releasing two playtest scenarios (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jnz?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-1-Shards-of-the-Glass-Planet"><em>Shards of the Glass Planet</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02jo2?Starfinder-Playtest-Scenario-2-It-Came-from-the-Vast"><em>It Came from the Vast!</em></a>&nbsp;) and a full 64-page module, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday"><em>A Cosmic Birthday</em></a>&nbsp;, filled with more encounters and lore. Watch this space for news about more scenarios and another adventure module releasing in the following months. Finally, on June 22, 2024, you can pick up even more free Starfinder Second Edition Playtest stat blocks in our <a href="https://freerpgday.com/">Free RPG Day</a>product!</p>
                   <p>I’m sure you can’t wait to make characters, play the adventures, and provide playtest feedback. We’re not quite there yet—but we will be soon! In the meantime, check <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest">starfinderplaytest.com</a> for the latest news and information about Starfinder Second Edition, enjoy Field Test #5, and be sure to check out our Starfinder panels and play some games at <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online 2024</a>! (Alas, we don’t have an entire panel dedicated to the many benefits of making attack rolls against Aeon Guards, but it’s on our bucket list.)</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Paizo’s made a name for itself on its adventures—even before the rise of the Pathfinder RPG, we were creating standalone adventures and Adventure Paths. There’s an old industry adage that “adventures don’t sell,” and while it’s true that a product like an adventure, which is aimed only at the GM, will sell less than a product aimed at players, I’ve never agreed with the theory that creating and publishing adventures is a waste of resources. To me, adventures are the whole point of an RPG—without adventures, GMs have nothing to run and players have nothing to play.</p>
                   <p>While a custom-created adventure by your own GM will always be able to speak to your table’s gaming preferences, creating adventures takes a lot of work. With published adventures, a GM can not only save a lot of time in preparing for a game or a campaign, but also find inspiration in them or learn how adventures are written, both of which help a GM get better at their craft. And when you don’t have a group to game with, even the simple act of reading a published adventure can help you feel that you’re still connected to your hobby until you find a new group to game with.</p>
                   <p>Published adventures have another advantage as well—they create shared experiences for gamers to talk about. It’s one thing to be at a convention or go online to talk about an adventure your PCs went on and how you barely made it out of the dungeon alive, but when you’ve done this with a published adventure, other gamers out there in the world who have been on the same adventure feel a connection to your game, and a greater discourse can be born out of that experience much in the same way as talking with friends about a recent movie or video game everyone’s been watching or playing.</p>
                   <p>As big a part of Paizo’s history as adventures are, it’s no surprise that we have several categories of adventures to choose from—and with the recent adjustments to our Adventure Path lengths and the formats of our standalone Adventures, I figured it’s time to chat a little bit about how Paizo’s three categories of published adventures are different, so you can figure out which category works best for your current campaign. Adventures are broken down into three size categories: Small, Medium, and Large.</p>
                   <h2>Small: Scenarios and Quests</h2>
                   <p>Our shortest adventure offerings are Scenarios and Quests. These PDF-only products give you a shorter game experience meant to play out over the course of two hours or so (in the case of a quest) or a single game session (a scenario). These are all part of Paizo’s Organized Play program, but they work just as well for a home game that needs a quick encounter or a short filler adventure in between longer storylines. You can think of a Scenario or a Quest as a short film.</p>

                   <h2>Medium: Standalone Adventures</h2>
                   <p>Our standalone Adventures have recently undergone an upgrade—from this point onward, starting with the upcoming adventure <em>Prey for Death</em>, our standalone adventures will be hardcover 128-page books. A standalone Adventure will typically present a single storyline that covers several sessions of gaming—as a general rule, you can expect your characters to gain somewhere between 3 to 6 levels over the course of a single standalone Adventure. This format allows us to explore larger storylines that need more room than a single volume of an Adventure Path to play out, but that don’t require the commitment to a three-part campaign—and also allow us to get a bit more experimental (such as with <em>Prey for Death</em>, which expects the players to all be Red Mantis Assassins—or at least closely allied with them!). We’ve got some more fun experiments in the works going forward for this line, so stay tuned! You can think of a standalone Adventure as a feature-length movie.</p>

                   <h2>Large: Adventure Paths</h2>
                   <p>Our Adventure Paths have been going strong for over 200 volumes, and while we’ve made some adjustments to their length (shifting from six-part campaigns down to three-part ones), this line of adventures isn’t going anywhere. An Adventure Path is published in three volumes that come out monthly; it can cover months or even years of gaming. You can expect your PCs to gain about 10 levels over the course of an entire Adventure Path. This format lets us tell long, sprawling stories that cover a wide range of themes, to explore ongoing events in the world of Golarion, and to present new parts of the world in great detail. You can think of an Adventure Path as a season of episodes for a television series.</p>

Now, as the year turns yet again for the Pathfinder Society, everything seems... peaceful?</p>
                   <p>Though, a new socialite has arrived in Absalom, Lady Hesla Embersplitter. She has no family, no background, no claim to fame, and yet, she’s entranced the hearts of the people and leaders of the community, including two very powerful forces: the Peacebuilders and Watcher-Lord Ulthun II. However, something seems... <em>off</em> about Hesla. And the weather across Golarion seems to be shifting, as though some dark change is on its way.</p>

                   <p>There are seven Pathfinder Society Scenarios that influence the Year of Immortal Influence’s metaplots, and each will be marked with a special metaplot icon on the cover. More information about the metaplot, as well as upcoming locations and characters, will be revealed during the News from Organized Play panel at PaizoCon 2024!</p>
                   <p>The Year of Immortal Influence’s first metaplot scenario kicks off with Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Immortal Influence, an adventure for 1st- to 4th-level characters written by Rigby Bendele. This scenario takes place during a fancy charity dinner, hosted by Lady Hesla as she seeks to raise money to fund the Knights of Lastwall. This scenario debuts at Gen Con 2024 with one other Pathfinder Society scenario.</p>
                   <p>This year is about uncovering secret plots and plans to unravel one of the most vulnerable areas in Avistan, even as the enemy wears a pretty face!</p>

Everyone keeps telling me I can eat all the ice cream I want, which is true, but I’m an adult now. I have to buy the ice cream myself, and that takes some of the fun out of it! Luckily, I have a wonderful husband to take care of me, and I’ll be back up and running just in time for convention season!</p>
                   <p>Speaking of… I’ve got quite the travel schedule this summer: PaizoCon in late May, Origins in mid-June, and then a quick turnaround to go to the ALA Expo with our Community Manager a few days later. I’ll have a few weeks of rest in July and then it’s off to Gen Con and PaizoCon Europe in August! Hopefully my cats will remember me by the time I’m back.</p>
                   <p>Before we jump into the blog, I want to shout out the Mox Gauntlet! Team Paizo is raising money for charity and participating in this annual board game tournament. If you donate to me you can get cat pics, a Harrow reading, or even a one-shot GMed by me! You can learn more and donate <a href="https://events.gamersengaged.org/participant/1252">on my participant page here</a>.</p>

                   <h2>SFS Year 7 Rule Updates</h2>
                   <p>Starfinder Society Year 7 launches at PaizoCon at the end of the month! Upon commencement of the convention (May 24), the following species will become always available for play:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>barathu (<em>Alien Archive</em>)</li>
                    <li>borai (<em>Pact Worlds</em>)</li>
                    <li>ghibrani (<em>Starfinder #5: The Thirteenth Gate</em>)</li>
                    <li>morlamaw (<em>Alien Archive 3</em>)</li>
                    <li>prismeni (<em>Starfinder #49: A Light in the Dark</em>)</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Players will still need to own the indicated sourcebook but will no longer require a boon to play any of these species.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, two new boons will be available for purchase that week! I won’t give any spoilers just yet, but they’re the direct result of player actions over the past year of play. Stay tuned for those at the convention!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Death of a God</h3>
                   <p>On our livestream last month, we announced the first major god who will die in the upcoming War of Immortals meta-event. Obviously, this death will have an impact on the Pathfinder Society campaign. Developer Josh Foster wrote a blog to talk about the exact rules surrounding the god’s death; <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6tabl">check it out here</a>!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
                   <p>The sanctioning machine is back in full swing! Last month we posted <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Seven+Dooms+for+Sandpoint+Sanctioning.pdf">sanctioning for the </a><a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Seven+Dooms+for+Sandpoint+Sanctioning.pdf"><em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Adventure Path</em></a>, as well as the brand-new <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions#lo-txwg"><em>Tian Xia World Guide</em></a>!</p>
                   <p>We’re hard at work on the major May releases, <em>Howl of the Wild </em>and <em>Mechageddon!</em> We aim to have them both ready for PaizoCon so you can play your new awakened animals and centaurs right away. GMs, prepare to make the hallways larger!</p>
                   <p>After that, it’ll be pretty quiet until July, when <em>Player Core 2</em> crashes in for Gen Con and the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>follows a mere month later. Hope you’re all ready!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>

                   <p>There seem to be two entries, one related to elemental birds, the other to unicorns! Let’s see what he has to say.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Elemental Birds and the Power of the Storm</h3>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/aafcdd65-8b00-4824-8ef2-c08ce0fd360d/ScientificIllustration_ElementalBirdFeathers_2000x1333.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/aafcdd65-8b00-4824-8ef2-c08ce0fd360d/ScientificIllustration_ElementalBirdFeathers_2000x1333.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Art by Luca Sotgiu : A scientific illustration of a variety of chaos falcon feathers."></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">A scientific illustration of a variety of chaos falcon feathers. Art by Luca Sotgiu.</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><em>The elements have a life of their own. I have always believed that birds embody these elements particularly well—phoenixes, thunderbirds, and tidehawks to name a few—but each of these creatures is so different from one another. They make their homes in different habitats and approach life with such different philosophies that they rarely meet without clashing.</em></p>
                   <p><em>My question, dear reader, has always been about the connection between these birds. Most sources say there is no doubt the three creatures have a common ancestor. What could that creature be? And does it still live?</em></p>
                   <p><em>I needed to trace the birds back to their commonalities for an answer. The Zoetrope could not take us back in time, but my studies could, and I soon found several similarities within a handful of creation myths. In ages past, the world was said to be in an everlasting tempest. Volcanoes spat fire into the sky, lightning jumped between clouds of ash, and sharp ice fragments whipped through the wind. It was the storm from which all other storms were born. How fitting would this primordial tempest be as the birthplace of the species of elemental bird from which the others evolved?</em></p>
                   <p><em>I searched volcanoes for the creatures known as chaos falcons, waiting for a violent eruption to give me a glimpse into the world of the past. It was in the Kullan Dei mountains that I at last found it.</em></p>
                   <p>This journal entry was written for <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em> by Caryn DiMarco.</p>
                   <p>How odd, it seems Baranthet also included some notes about the chaos falcon’s “abilities.”</p>
                   <h4><u>CHAOS FALCON — CREATURE 10</u></h4>
                   <p><b>Dive-bomb</b> [two-actions] (earth, fire, primal) <b>Requirements</b> The chaos falcon is Flying; <b>Effect</b> The chaos falcon Flies twice straight down. If they reach the ground or a similarly solid object at the end of this movement, their landing shatters that surface into sharp shards, and droplets of molten stone deal 4d6 fire and 3d8 piercing damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) to all other creatures within 20 feet.<br></p>
                   <p><b>Storm Bolt</b> The chaos falcon's bolt Strike always deals the damage type of their storm nexus aura.</p>

                   <h3>A Sanctuary for Unicorns</h3>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f6a7833e-dd44-48e8-a084-c79c6320653c/ScientificIllustration_UnicornHerd_2000x1333.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f6a7833e-dd44-48e8-a084-c79c6320653c/ScientificIllustration_UnicornHerd_2000x1333.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt=" Art by Luca Sotgiu : A scientific illustration of unicorns grazing, drinking water, and frolicking in a field."></a>

                   </div>
                   <p><em>During our journey, we were lucky to stumble into the Monkeros Sanctuary, a hidden forest doubling as both a nature reserve and home for a small herd of unicorns. Of course, I will not share its location—indeed, publicizing the location of any unicorn poses a terrible danger to them. With that in mind, many who support the sanctuary do so without ever seeing the unicorns they protect. A rare few academic visitors are allowed along with a handful of mercenaries, both vetted through the churches associated with Monkeros and further by the unicorns themselves.</em></p>
                   <p><em>Although unicorns have the capacity for speech far surpassing my own eloquence, their nervousness around outsiders makes direct interviews difficult. It was only by enlisting the aid of ten-year-old Theom, the son of a visiting scholar, that I was able to establish something of a dialogue with the most outgoing of the unicorns. Theom knew the unicorn as “Periwinkle,” which she seemed happy to accept—much like our own Ten has adopted their moniker. Even in the oldest stories and tales, the true name of a unicorn is always missing. It seems too much of a coincidence that this detail is so persistently lacking; I’m left to believe that unicorns must have a very good reason to protect the secrecy of their true name.</em></p>
                   <p>This journal entry was written for <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em> by Jessie “Aki” Lo.</p>
                   <p>Another note—perhaps Baranthet has found a system of denoting abilities across the wide variety of Golarion’s wildlife... Apparently, unicorns comprise not just the eponymous species, but many others as well, such as the flying alicorn.</p>
                   <h4><u>ALICORN — CREATURE 15</u></h4>
                   <p><b>Draw in Magic</b> [reaction] (arcane, concentrate) <b>Trigger</b> A creature within 30 feet of the alicorn Casts a Spell; <b>Effect</b> The alicorn attempts to counteract the triggering spell (counteract modifier +28, counteract rank 8th). If successful, the alicorn can choose to gain the effects of the triggering spell as its sole target.</p>

                   <p>The commander is an Intelligence-based tactician with unparalleled authority over the battlefield. By drilling specific tactics with your allies during your daily preparations, you can signal them with your unfurled banner during a fight to take additional actions. Call for a Defensive Retreat to allow each of your squadmates to Step up to three times (away from enemies, of course) as a free action. Using the Double Team tactic to allow a squadmate with an opponent in reach to Shove or Reposition that foe as a free action. If they are successful and move that creature adjacent to you or a different squadmate, you or that squadmate can Strike that opponent as a reaction. The commander is no slouch in the fight themself, being trained in martial weapons and all armors, so if you want to lead your fellow adventurers to victory, be sure to playtest the commander!</p>

                   <p>The guardian is a Strength-based protector who excels in the use of armor, both for their own benefit and the aid of others. You gain the effects of armor specialization at 1st level, and you can also Intercept Strikes meant for your allies, taking the hit but gaining resistance against that damage. Because of your armor, you’ll be a little more difficult to hit than your friends, so what’s to stop monsters from simply ignoring you? Your Taunts! By Taunting a foe, you make yourself a more tempting target and impart penalties to their attacks on anyone else.

                   <p>This playtest will run for almost two months, beginning April 29 (today!), and continuing through June 21, 2024. In addition to playtesting these classes in your home games, you’ll be able to try them out in our organized play program by making your own Pathfinder Society characters using the rules located in the Guide to Organized Play. The commander and guardian classes and all related options are available to all players during this playtest.</p>
                   <p>Our friends at Demiplane are also hosting a free character builder for the commander and guardian classes, available at <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e">www.pathfindernexus.com/playtest</a>, for those of you interested in taking advantage of their digital toolset to generate your characters.</p>
                   <p>Once you’ve had a chance to get a feel for the new classes, please be sure to leave your feedback at <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BattlecryClassSurvey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BattlecryClassSurvey</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BattlecryOpenResponse">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BattlecryOpenResponse</a> to let us know what you think of them and where you think they could be improved! We’ll also have dedicated playtest forums here on paizo.com to discuss these classes and options with your peers. We’re looking forward to hearing what you have to say! We’d also love to see stories of your adventures with these classes on social media!</p>

Your work might even be recognized by the community and earn you an invitation into the Infinite Masters elite creator program.</p>

                   <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

They prefer the unpredictable and uncharted, far from prying eyes and folks what ask too many questions. Never tied to one place, these vagabonds stay strange and savvy, doing what they can to keep alive. When the galaxy needs a job done, they call for the rough and tumble Space Cowboy.</p>

Discover the hidden secrets and lives of more than half a dozen fully fleshed-out characters… or break all of the above up into pieces and use them in your own campaign! An adventure toolbox is designed to be easily changed to fit any level, and modular enough that story threads, characters and locations become a resource that can be repurposed, redesigned and re-themed to your heart’s content.&nbsp;</p>

                   <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them primarily)</h3>
                   <p>안녕하세요, 여러분! My name is Eren, and I had the incredibly fun opportunity to refresh Daikitsu and Lao Shu Po for the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> as well as contributing some lore around the mystical imugi. As someone who loves exploring the relationship between mortality and divinity, it was an absolute dream to have the opportunity to expand on Tian Xia's pantheon. I hope you all fall as deeply in love with the Lady of Foxes and Old Rat Woman as I did while writing them.</p>
                   <p>You can find me sporadically talking about my writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erenahn.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> (by the time you're reading this, I'll have posted more detailed threads on my contributions for this book, if you're interested in reading about my process) and talking about everything else on <a href="https://twitter.com/chromathesia">Twitter</a>. You will also see me in a couple of months for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Alyx Bui</h3>
                   <p>Hear ye, hear ye! Here come the imperial dragons of Tian Xia! I had the pleasure of crafting and writing on the Imperial Dragons and the peoples and land of Zi Ha! This was a massive collaboration between so many talented writers and artists—Basheer Ghouse to place Arindham, a forest dragon within the Valashmai Jungle, with Jay Zhang to place Luong Phung, a sea dragon within Xidao, with Jacky Leung to place Shen Ra, a sky dragon within Po Li, with Kevin Thien Vu Long Nguyen to place a sovereign dragon, Pham Duc Quan within Xa Hoi, and Grady Wang to place an underworld dragon, Zhu Long, within Chu Ye.</p>
                   <p>For Zi Ha, it was brilliant to connect with Kienna Shaw, as we placed the samsaran peoples and their origins in this magical land. We wanted to make sure that we inserted a non-colonial view of this world. I wanted joy and wonder to come out of these harsh, wintery lands—from bioluminescent fungi and large, carnivorous plant hunting to festivals that honor the mountain peaks, dragon cycles, and the long day and night phases. Enjoy the epic lore of Shei Long, a Sky Dragon, and the moon deity Tsukiyo! Continue the conversation with me on X (Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/daredevilalyx">@daredevilalyx</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Banana Chan (she/they/he)</h3>
                   <p>I'm Banana and I wrote a bunch of stuff for Tian Xia, but what I need EVERYONE to know about is the Great Flood, based on the creature Xiangliu. It's one of my favorite mythical creatures because of how silly it looks in drawings, but if you could see it in real life, it would probably be a body horror disaster. It has the body of a giant snake or eel with nine human heads attached to it. I'd been wanting to write about the Xiangliu for the longest time, so I'm extremely grateful that Paizo gave me that opportunity.</p>

                   <h3>Connie Chang (they/he/she)</h3>
                   <p>Hey there! I'm Connie Chang, and I wrote Quain, a location full of wuxia fantasies, grandmasters, and cultivation! As a queer and trans diasporic Chinese person, I'm a huge fan of the wuxia and xianxia genres as a way to explore historical fantasy beyond western imaginations—so of course I jumped at the chance to help create something with Paizo. I'm especially interested in seeing the stories that will bloom from centuries-old, deeply complicated rivalries between grandmasters!</p>

                   <p>Hai tai! Wanne Hiromi yaibiin! Hi! I’m Hiromi! For folks unfamiliar with me, I’ve worked on over a hundred books and games, usually as a writer or game designer. I’m excited to have worked with Paizo, as I’ve wanted to for years. I’m even more excited to say that I also got to work on the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> and pen the tie-in fiction <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sii3?Tian-Xia-Days-The-Matsuri">The Matsuri</a>! Hopefully, I’ll have more opportunities to work with Paizo in the future. If I do, you’ll find out about them from my Bluesky account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiromicota.bsky.social">@hiromicota</a>!</p>
                   <p>For the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I worked on Kwanlai. I had fun providing an in-world explanation as to why Kwanlai is principally populated by tengu (a Japanese creature) but has a Chinese name. The answer, in short, is colonialism. In real life, Japan colonized Uchinaa and foisted the exonym “Okinawa” upon my people. So, it was natural for me to depict the Lung Wa conquering the nation of Ootoya and foisting the exonym “Kwanlai” on the Ootoyans. Another fun tidbit in the writeup is takoyaki (battered and fried octopus) becoming a popular snack due to Wanshou (a nation ruled by a kraken) attacking Kwanlai.</p>

                   <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3>
                   <p>Dana Ebert (nonchalant female human writer) is a common author to find credited in Pathfinder publications, and the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> is no exception. Known for fanciful and often extravagant prose, her work reimagining Minata is most evident in phrases like "swallowing dragons like krill" and "churned the sea like a mortar and pestle." In addition to authoring the chapter on Minata, she contributed substantial Minata-adjacent content to the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>. When she's not writing for Pathfinder, Dana is a full-time content creator at <a href="https://www.tpkbrewing.com ">TPK Brewing Co.</a>, a tabletop roleplaying-themed brewery she co-owns in Portland, Oregon.</p>

                   <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Hi! I’m John, a mixed-race Filipino American gamer, gamemaster, freelancer, and podcaster. For the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em> I wrote the Oceans of Tian Xia as well as several new Tian ships, along with Yamatsumi the mountain god and General Susumu. I was very excited to work on these as I spent my early childhood in Hawai'i and Philippines, and later sailed the seven seas as I started my career.</p>
                   <p>As a freelance game designer, I’ve written mostly for Paizo but also some for Evil Robot Games and Legendary Games. As a gamemaster, I earned my 5th Nova in 2021 and have volunteered at dozens of gaming conventions. As a podcaster, I produce three podcasts on the Know Direction Network: <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/digital-divination/">Digital Divination</a>, with Paizo Senior Designer Jason Keeley and D&amp;D Designer Ron Lundeen; <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/">Intrepid Heroes</a>, an RPG actual play where we just completed the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk">Devastation Ark</a> AP and soon begin a <a href="https://evilhat.com/product/scum-and-villainy/">Scum and Villainy</a> adventure run by Jason Keeley; and <a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/presenting/">Presenting - Gamers Making Games</a>, a podcast where I have interviewed over 100 game designers, developers, artists, and editors. In addition, I am also GMing a <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</a> campaign and playing <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/outlawsOfAlkenstar">Outlaws of Alkenstar</a> and <a href="https://dndstore.wizards.com/us/en/product/820944/planescape-adventures-in-the-multiverse-digital-plus-physical-bundle">Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse</a>. In my non-gaming life, I am a university professor teaching entrepreneurship and social venture creation in the Seattle area.</p>

                   <p>Hello! My name's Daniel! I'm the co-host of the Asians Represent Podcast and am a freelance game designer and cultural consultant with over 40 games credits! The <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> is my second Paizo contribution and certainly the one I'm most excited about. I had a blast bringing my love of weapons, horror, and mythology to life for the project. It is such an honor to be part of such a diverse team of Asian creatives who have worked so hard to bring life to Tian Xia! Fun fact, some of my fellow freelancers and I started a home game to test out many of our contributions during the development period!</p>

                   <p>Hey, everyone! I'm Jacky Leung, and it's been a while since I worked freelance for Paizo. Tian Xia was an amazing experience to revisit as a player and a creator. I had the pleasure of writing for Po Li and expanding life in a country ruled by the theologic elite and how people governed by oracles thrive despite its previously sheltered portrayal in earlier works. I had the opportunity to provide faces to the extremely secretive Oracular Council that governs Po Li, introduce the equally secretive Lapis Watchers, and expand new iconic locations for players to explore such as Tuotuo, the Enlightened City—a historical education center containing special archives housing racks of prophecies and oracular writings. Beyond the nostalgic glamor lies also the Emperor's Footprint, a site rumored to contain mystical properties, a supposed asteroid, and stunning panoramic beauty—just highly dangerous and full of monsters, I'm sure it's fine. I hope folx gets to experience the social and political dissonance that awaits them when adventuring through Po Li; it was a fantastic challenge.</p>

                   <p>Hello friends! I'm so excited for you all to sink into this beautiful world. For many of you it will be a marvelous opportunity to immerse yourself in a land rich with cultures perhaps outside your own. I'm right there with you. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder's rich world, and I never expected to go so deep into exploring my own culture and heritage through the lens of Wanshou's horror and paranoia. Just remember, if anything bad happens to your party while exploring this flooded land, it's definitely not a coincidence and probably your party member's fault. You know which one I'm talking about.</p>
                   <p>I work on all kinds of TTRPG content, so if you're into grand adventure with a bit of horror, then we'll get along great! If you're a fan of my contribution to Tian Xia and want to follow my other work you can find me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/34thgingerbread.bsky.social">Bsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/34thGingerbread">Twitter</a> as 34thGingerbread - or you can visit my website: <a href="https://www.adam34th.com/">https://www.adam34th.com/</a></p>

                   <p>Hi! I'm Tan Shao Han / 陈绍涵 (family name Tan/Chen, 陈; generational name, Shao 绍; personal name, Han 涵), a TTRPG creator, lecturer, and cultural consultant from Singapore, Southeast Asia. I'm proudly part of the RPGSEA TTRPG design movement based in Southeast Asia! I grew up a steady diet on wuxia media (movies, books, TV series, manhua), and am happy to re-imagine and create settings (the histories, lands, and peoples of Goka and Songbai) in the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> to inspire the telling of new wuxia-influenced stories in your Pathfinder games! It has been an absolute privilege to work on the Tian Xia books, alongside great colleagues and supervisors whom I now have the pleasure to call my friends.</p>
                   <p>Outside of freelancing with Paizo, I also run an indie TTRPG company, <a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/">Curious Chimeras</a>. If you're interested in more of my takes on Chinese fantasy, check out my recent indie games: <a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/product/swordfarer/"><em>Swordfarer</em></a>, a wuxia journaling game of jianghu melancholia and friendships and <a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/product/shrine-the-siege-of-yueyuan/"><em>Shrine</em></a>, a xianxia storytelling game of karma, despair, and reincarnation.

                   <p>Hello, y’all! Ruvaid here. You may have seen my name in previous Paizo books such as <em>Dark Archive</em>, <em>Impossible Lands</em>, and <em>Rage of Elements</em>. For the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I wrote the entry for the nation of Hongal. I have a deep appreciation for Mongolian culture from which Hongal draws inspiration, and I endeavored to bring as much respect to my words as possible. I sincerely hope that you enjoy reading about Hongal as much as I enjoyed writing about it.</p>
                   <p>If you’re looking for a South Asian/Muslim freelancer for your next project, or should you simply wish to perceive me, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider/">@Darth_Ruvaider</a>, or the other one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/darthruvaider.bsky.social">@darthruvaider.bsky.social</a>.

                   <h3>Grady Wang (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Howdy, I'm Grady and my work on Chu Ye in the <em>World Guide</em> was my first-ever assignment for Paizo! I'm so excited that it's finally out! This nation has incredible potential for grand stories, from its historical contributions to medicinal knowledge to the present-day four-way clash between its greedy oni ruling class, a scrappy humanoid rebellion, an underworld dragon out for revenge, and a jealous god. I was also thrilled to be able to draw upon my Chinese and Taiwanese heritages to expand Chu Ye’s culture and its experiences under occupation.</p>
                   <p>My next contribution will be in the <em>Character Guide</em> coming later this year, which contains Tian Xia’s unique takes on medicine. You can also find me online at The Gallant Goblin where my partner and I review TTRPG products on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin">https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin</a>, sell kobold plushies at <a href="https://www.gallantgoblin.com/heroplush/">heroplush.com</a>, and produce expanded content for Pathfinder at <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/">https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/</a>, where we just released the first community print-on-demand product, <em>Adventures in Jalmeray</em>, which is an anthology of three adventures set in Jalmeray (<em>Lost Omens: Impossible Lands</em>) designed by an all-Desi team of writers!</p>

                   <p>The annual Greenwood Gala—a convention for primal power brokers and a festival associated with the Green Faith—is ruined when saboteurs assassinate several of the region’s eminent leaders. To keep tensions from erupting into more bloodshed, the PCs must maintain order long enough for the Wildwood Lodge to choose a new leader and restore peace.

                   <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 7th- through 10th-level characters.</p>
                   <p>For a century, the villainous Order of Dawning Fate has operated in the shadows, remaining anonymous and untouched despite extensive criminal activity, political manipulation, and espionage. Thanks to the efforts of countless Starfinders and their allies across the galaxy, the Order of Dawning Fate is crumbling—their members are exposed, their holdings are under investigation, their proxies are moving to cut ties, many of their highest-ranking members are dead or arrested, and their supply of the rare starmetal finitrium has been cut off. Yet a threat remains…</p>
                   <p>Zhaneni, founder and mastermind of the Order of Dawning Fate, has evaded capture, retreating to her personal demesne on the planet Kax to wait out the turmoil alongside her closest ally and fellow founder of the Order, Evethriel. As the Stewards, Veskarium, and numerous other galactic bodies move against the Order’s now-exposed agents and holdings within their respective jurisdictions, First Seeker Ehu Hadif and Ixthia the Unbreakable dispatch Starfinders to confront Zhaneni and destroy the last remnants of Project Dawn—the hybrid machine that amplifies Zhaneni’s natural precognitive abilities, enabling her to see and shape the future.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society is running low on a critical alchemical catalyst, and all their usual suppliers have run dry. The Supplies and Procurement Division is desperate and has put a call out directly to agents. They know of one alchemist skilled and knowledgeable enough to make the catalyst: Tragshi the Herbalist, master of the Daggermark Poisoner's Guild. The Society has used what contacts they have remaining in Daggermark to arrange a meeting, but the chief poisoner isn't one to give things away for free. The PCs will need to do several errands for her, proving the Society's worth to the guild and to Tragshi herself.</p>

Teacher Ot has been tasked with showing the PCs the ways of the magical school as well as with taking their measure. The future of this partnership lies in the PCs' hands.</p>

                   <p>The Burning Sun orc hold has spent the past year guarding the body of Mahja Firehair as she fights her Crucible in the afterlife. Unfortunately, there have been strange attacks on Freedom Town as of late. Desperate for answers and hopeful for assistance, Uirch reaches out to the Pathfinder Society to investigate the mysterious attackers and see if their flames belong to the Whispering Tyrant or to another enemy lying in wait. The Pathfinders will need to investigate the town while ensuring that an enemy of mythical proportions doesn't see their plan succeed and interrupt Mahja's Crucible.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">New Year’s first fireworks danced across Changdo’s night, their exuberant sparks half-reflected upon the Sea of Ghosts. Ling Zhiyu, courtesy name Wenhan, Sixth-Rank Clerk of the Ministry of Truth, Junior Secretary of the Lower Oracular Council, set down his brush to admire the distant pyrotechnics.</p>
                   <p>This far from the city, the celebrations looked almost peaceful. Whenever possible, Zhiyu spent New Year here, at this shoreside teahouse, preferring to stay away from the devotees jostling to light the auspicious incense to welcome the Eternal Emperor’s spirit, away from wending swells of dragon dancers bearing the throne’s five colors, and most of all, away from the Ministry of Faith’s magically amplified, self-congratulatory platitudes for yet another year of Po Li’s glory.</p>
                   <p>The Sea of Ghosts’ lapping waves broke the oracle’s reverie, their leisurely cadence not unlike the murmuring of some unknown tongue. Zhiyu smiled despite himself. <em>No point thinking such dour thoughts during New Year. You'll invite Heaven’s displeasure... and more importantly, spoil everyone’s mood here. They’ve suffered enough.</em></p>
                   <p>Facing the vacuous waters, Zhiyu spoke loudly and clearly to no one at all.</p>
                   <p>“Yes, elders. Happy New Year to you too. May your heart realize ten thousand desires, may your descendants lead long and healthy lives, may the Eternal Emperor hasten your reincarnations for your loyal service. You can see, Changdo still stands, bright with lanterns, altars, cooking fires, and fireworks. You did not fight the War of Widow-Makers in vain; every New Year is your everlasting gift to us all.”</p>
                   <p>The currents settled. His invisible audience seemingly placated, Zhiyu returned to his table’s reports, and was pleasantly surprised to find the teahouse’s proprietors had discreetly left some fried niangao and a fresh pot of aged Tuotuo tea. These refreshments were not unwelcome; there was much to attend to, from goiter and beriberi coinciding with recent fads of grain diets emulating the Eternal Emperor’s piety; stirring instability in the West with Lingshen and Quain; troubling developments on the East with Hwanggot and Bachuan. So much to do! But for now, tea and rice cakes. Zhiyu sipped gratefully, smiled his thanks to the teahouse’s owners, and returned to his paperwork, as fresh fireworks and celebratory songs filled the night.</p>
                   <hr width="50%">
                   <p>“Oracle Ling looks tired. He’s always working so hard, even on New Year.”</p>
                   <p>“You know how it is, my beloved. There are some oracles who work very hard, because there are so many who don’t...”</p>
                   <p>“Close your mouth, my foolish husband. These things! You shouldn’t even think them, let alone speak them... nobody, especially us, can afford to pay the price.”</p>
                   <p>On this solemn note, the teahouse owners’ whispered conversation reached a brief lull. Fireworks flared above, in the shape of a celestial peach tree; a sign of life’s renewal and promise. Husband and wife contemplated the sky together, a shared silence; then, both spoke abruptly at the same time.</p>
                   <p>“Do you suppose we can ask Oracle Ling...”</p>
                   <p>“Maybe it’s as good a time as any to ask Oracle Ling...”</p>
                   <p>They laughed quietly at this simultaneous blurting of their hearts’ nervousness. Who could blame them? They were but humble merchants without clan or fame, whose usual clients were fishers who plied the Sea of Ghosts for minnow and perch. Oracle Ling was by far their most prestigious guest, a virtuous official without outrageous demands or haughty airs, who paid in full and tipped well.</p>
                   <p>To ask an extra favor of him, and especially on this New Year, when families traditionally would have their Reunion Dinners, and officials would vie to fete the Ministers in grand court banquets... Oracle Ling must be truly busy to forsake those commitments and opportunities. What right would they have to disturb his schedule with such a selfish request?</p>
                   <hr width="50%">
                   <p>Zhiyu yawned as he completed his report on the Gokan trafficking of false Po Lian relics and rubbed the poultice of chrysanthemum and wolfberry over his tired eyes.</p>
                   <p><em>I suppose it's time.</em></p>
                   <p>The waves stirred, as if in assent.</p>
                   <p>Zhiyu forced a smile, trying to let the wisdom in his mind fade away, to return from realms of divine insight dwelled by praiseworthy sages. He stood up quietly and tiptoed to the teahouse.</p>
                   <hr width="50%">
                   <p>“Excuse me.”</p>
                   <p>The proprietors nearly jumped from shock. Zhiyu reprimanded himself; he had not wanted to cause any disturbance, but alas, that was exactly what had happened. <em>Ah well, let's get on with it.</em></p>
                   <p>“Good sir, good madam, I understand you would like my help with something. I understand you have a child, of the right age for a Test of Fate, and you would like to see what the Heavens are willing to reveal about your child’s destiny.”</p>
                   <p>This time, the proprietors were truly in shock. How did the esteemed guest know all these? But then, he was an oracle...</p>
                   <p>“I understand your grandparents were from Lingshen and Quain, who fought here to defend the Imperial City during the War of Widow-Makers...”</p>
                   <p>The wind hissed, like a thousand knives drawn all at once.</p>
                   <p>“...and your parents stayed behind, but Changdo has not treated you all that well. Due to the present... succession disputes. Of things much bigger than you or me, our politics, histories, cultures...”</p>
                   <p>The wind stopped abruptly, A sleeping waterbird woke in surprise, and uttered a mournful cry.</p>
                   <p>“...and so, you have no lands, no clans, no names, no sponsors; no choice but to take on the regrettable work of doing business on your own. And you wonder... will your child inherit the same fate?”</p>
                   <p>Wife and husband nodded as one, their eyes red-rimmed and knuckles white-edged.</p>
                   <p>“If you will permit me, I will perform the Test of Fate for your child, and let his destiny be revealed in Heaven’s gaze. I apologize I must inconvenience you to visit my residence, because my luopan, almanacs, yarrow stalks, and other divinatory tools are at home.”</p>
                   <p>The couple fell to their knees in gratitude; Zhiyu stepped forward to help them back up. As they ambled to the oracle’s tiny manor, the night sky above Changdo seemed lighter somehow, and not just for the fireworks that flooded its inky expanse.</p>

                   <p>In the heart of the Verduran Forest, the largest woodlands in Avistan, druids and Green Faith adherents gather annually to share what they’ve learned from the natural world at an event called the Moot of Ages. Nearby, other forest denizens gather for the Greenwood Gala, a festive three-day event filled with feasts, games, and exuberance held on the river’s banks. The gala ends with a symbolic renewal of the Treaty of Wildwood, an agreement that has allowed a modicum of peace between those who call the forest home and those who harvest resources from it.</p>
                   <p>This doesn’t stop people from airing their grievances, yet the tone of such disagreements tends to be respectful. This year is different. Resentment has grown so deep and toxic that attendees are wielding their grudges like a keenly honed axe. Anyone stepping up to calm the situation is going to be forced to pick a side.</p>
                   <p>Inside the Wardens of Wildwood Player’s Guide, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free lore and tips to create an exciting character suited for the Wardens of Wildwood Adventure Path. Contents include:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>An overview of the Verduran Forest, the Wildwood Lodge, and the annual Moot of Ages.</li>
                    <li>Character advice, including ways different character classes and ancestries might excel in this Adventure Path.</li>

                   <br>
                   <p>Let’s jump from the first two Sandpoint <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/">SoundSets</a> created for Syrinscape to the latest two. Number 1,081 (“Bones and Ashes”) and Number 1,082 (“Strange Times in Sandpoint”) were built to support the opening of this fantastic NEW adventure. Nowadays Syrinscape has a few more content creators than just me; while it’s still much of my music in there, Chris Körding built these sounds AND contributed even more rich evocative music of his own.</p>
                   <p>Back in 2009, Chris was playing <a href="https://syrinscape.com/store/?q=rise&amp;order=featured&amp;game-system=pathfinder&amp;type=everything">Rise of the Runelords</a> when, as he describes it, "Syrinscape came along and released the official soundscapes (SoundSets) for the adventure I was playing and I was blown away by the richness and textures and what it provided to the gaming table. Needless to say, <a href="https://syrinscape.com/">Syrinscape</a> became a permanent addition to every gaming session.”</p>
                   <p>Chris adds, “Fast forward to 2024 and Adventure Path 200! But this time I get to bring it to life for Syrinscape. Expanding from the original adventures and sounds, what could I do to propel it to the roaring 20s?" Nowadays, Syrinscape is more powerful—it can run more channels of sound, with individual reverb units set for every channel, and run sounds which are positioned binaurally for an increased sense of immersion. So, what has Chris done with these new capabilities? He’s had fun, that’s what!</p>

                   <p>Syrinscape supports all the key locations in this “new” Sandpoint with specifically crafted ambiances. Traps and dramatic events are meticulously crafted for maximum shock and affect. Encounters feature dramatic music to help keep everyone focused and specifically voiced creatures to trigger all those subconscious fears! And of course, as always, <a href="https://syrinscape.com/">Syrinscape</a> is 100% customizable.</p>
                   <p>When it comes to the music we have created, Chris says, “Don’t want piano hits? Just stop the element. Need some extra choir sounds? Just hit play on THAT element and you have your angelic voices. All of this can easily be done with the power Syrinscape puts into your hands.” With a <a href="https://syrinscape.com/subscriptions/3-supersyrin/">SuperSyrin</a> sub, you can even compose your own music and upload it to play along with the ambiances we designed. Syrinscape’s support for the Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Adventure Path is rich, specific, and immersive.</p>
                   <p>If you haven’t used Syrinscape at your table before, now might just be the time to give it a go! And if you are playing remotely with a team of headphone-wearing warriors, Syrinscape has you sorted with our new <a href="https://app.syrinscape.com/">Web Player</a>, which lets you share your audio with any of your friends ,wherever they are, with just a simple link they can open in any browser.

                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!<br></p>
                   <p>It turns out that all the various consumables handed out on missions require a pretty solid support network, and now a supplier of a rare catalyst aiding in mass production is retiring, leaving the Society to turn towards a more troublesome source–Tragshi the Herbalist, head of the Daggermark Poisoners’ Guild. Fortunately, Tragshi is open to the idea, as the Outlaw Council, a meeting of various leaders of the River Kingdoms, is happening in Daggermark soon, and Tragshi has agreed to supply what the Society needs if they can be seen taking orders for her, letting her show off politically. She says there will also be other sundry tasks that need doing as well, but there’s a pretty good chance that the Pathfinders might end up dragged into an internal power structure within one of the most dangerous organizations in the Inner Sea.</p>

                   <p>The Burning Sun orc hold calls for the Pathfinder Society’s assistance in protecting the corpse of Mahja Firehair as she continues to undergo the Crucible. Lately there have been strange attacks on Freedom Town, centered on the house protecting her body and filled with signs of sulfur and occult magic. While the council of Freedom Town suspects the Whispering Way, Uirch has other concerns and requests that the Pathfinders investigate to find out who might be at the root of this chaos and find out their intentions with Mahja’s body, never suspecting that <em>he</em> may also be the target of this strange attacker.</p>

The Pathfinder Society has long desired a closer relationship with the Magaambya, and Kreighton Shaine has finally gotten a chance to achieve that. He’s selected some of his finest students to show the instructors at that storied institute of magical learning just what Pathfinder can do. The future ties between these organizations are in your hands!</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Greeting Pathfinders,</p>
                   <p>By now you’ve all learned which of the core 20 will be dying—Gorum. Many of you may have characters that through one way or another draw power from Our Lord in Iron, and I can imagine that you’re all wondering what this means for those characters going forward. Our setting is one where dead gods don’t grant spells, no matter how fervent their remaining believers. We’re also running the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign in a living setting, and that means that setting-altering impacts will happen, and that they will matter. So, starting <strong>at Gen Con, August 1st 2024</strong>, Gorum will no longer be alive to grant his faithful power.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bd64be30-c5c5-4858-9bf2-82c10b8cf254/PZO9303_GORUM_1600x2000.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bd64be30-c5c5-4858-9bf2-82c10b8cf254/PZO9303_GORUM_1600x2000.png" width="400px" style="padding: 10px;" alt="The armored god Gorum menacingly wields a sword, the glow of his eyes the only thing visible within his helm"></a>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>What that means is that any character with an option than relied on Gorum, such as a cleric, gets a free rebuild <strong>immediately</strong>. You don’t have to use it right away, but if you want to play your character on or after August 1st, you won’t be getting power from Gorum. I know many of you have characters intensely devoted to the gods they follow, and I’ve seen some really incredible Gorumites in my time volunteering for Pathfinder Society and since coming on as a developer. You don’t have to erase that fervor though. Just as we allow the reporting conditions for our scenarios to shape our setting, changes to the setting can be a part of your character’s story. We have some of the most creative players out there, and I look forward to seeing how you incorporate this twist into the characters you play.</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>The death of Gorum is going to hugely impact the setting, but we’ll also be releasing some Godsrain scenarios, so you’ll be able to play through some of the setting-altering aftermath of Our Lord in Iron’s demise. I know some of you will still be disappointed that a character you’ve put a lot into has to change, but we can’t keep our promise of a living setting if we don’t have those setting changes impact everyone. Though Gorum will be gone, your characters’ stories will continue. And I can’t wait to show you some of the scenarios we’ve shaped around this massive event, stories you’ll be able to contribute to because this is a living setting.</p>
                   <p>But that’ll have to wait for another blog. So, to reiterate, as of August 1st, Gorum will be dead, and any option explicitly receiving power from him won’t work. Any character using such an option, like a cleric, will receive a free rebuild. Until then, play your Gorumites’ hearts out.</p>
                   <p>Happy gaming everyone. It’s been a blast watching everyone’s theories and reactions throughout this announcement process.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Our Lord in Iron, Gorum! Now, the how, when, and why of this deific death are elements of War of Immortals we’re not quite ready to talk about yet, but we promise: Gorum is going to die “on screen” in an adventure in which your player characters play a role. We’ll have more details about that as the adventure’s release approaches. In the meantime, let’s take a brief look at the slate of products coming in the second half of 2024 in which Gorum’s death and the larger War of Immortals metaplot will play out!</p>
                   <p>First on the list are an adventure and adventure path that have already been announced. In July, we’re releasing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eyz"><em>Pathfinder Adventure: Prey for Death</em></a>, a 128-page hardcover adventure for 14th-level characters, written by former Paizo Developer Vanessa Hoskins. In this adventure, you’ll play members of the Red Mantis, the notorious and mysterious assassins guild and cult of the mantis god, Achaekek, who must clear their names when treachery threatens to besmirch their honor. Not only is <em>Prey for Death</em> the first tie-in to the War of Immortals storyline, but it’s also the debut of the new ongoing format of the Pathfinder Adventure product line!</p>

                   <p>Also in July, we’ll kick off our 40th Pathfinder Adventure Path (!!!), entitled Curtain Call, with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez2"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #204: Stage Fright</em></a> by veteran designer Richard Pett. <em>Stage Fright</em> starts characters as 11th-level adventurers who, over the course of the AP, help to produce an opera based on their own prior adventures while simultaneously facing a new threat that only the most powerful of heroes can stop. The connections between a theater-based campaign and the death of one of Golarion’s most powerful deities may seem tenuous, but you’ll have to trust us on this: the ramifications of Gorum’s death and the ensuing Godsrain affect all aspects of the world. And players of the Curtain Call Adventure Path will have a front row seat!</p>

                   <p>In September, we’ll be releasing the first of a pair of e-book short fiction collections exploring the event, a compilation of Erin Roberts’s smash <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/theGodsrainProphecies">web fiction series</a>, <em>The Godsrain Prophecies</em>, complete with additional material exploring the identity and motivations of the mysterious seer who first penned the prophecies.</p>
                   <p>In October, we’ll publish <em>Before the Godsrain</em>, an anthology of short and flash fiction featuring four Iconic characters: the barbarian Amiri, the wizard Ezren, the cleric Kyra, and elven rogue Merisiel. These stories—mostly previously published on the Paizo Blog—explore the characters’ origins, character, and prior adventures and set the stage for something we’ll chat about a little bit later.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Also in October, Paizo is proud to announce the tentpole release of the War of Immortals event, the aptly named <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oar?Pathfinder-War-of-Immortals">Pathfinder War of Immortals</a></em>hardcover rulebook. This 240-page hardcover (also available in special edition, retailer-exclusive sketch variant, and forthcoming pocket edition) will introduce mythic rules to Pathfinder Second Edition, as well as two brand new classes—the first original classes built on the remastered foundation of the <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>—the animist and exemplar! In addition to loads of new character options, <em>War of Immortals </em>also explores Gorum’s death and the ramifications. Most notable among these is the Godsrain: a literal shower of the slain god’s blood, shattered armor, and divine essence that falls upon Golarion and every world on which he was worshiped, leaving war and mythic power in its wake. A book called <em>War of Immortals </em>would hardly be doing its job if it didn’t explain the selfsame conflict, an extended period of conflict in which gods struggle to survive a slew of divine deaths and mortals vie for the newly available god-sparks upsetting the balance of power.</p>
                   <p>October also brings our second War of Immortals tie-in adventure path, Triumph of the Tusk, beginning with <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02sxe?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-207-The-Resurrection-Flood">Pathfinder Adventure Path #207: The Resurrection Flood</a></em>, by Brian Duckwitz and John Compton, and adventure for 3rd-level characters. Triumph of the Tusk is a three-part monthly campaign in which an eclectic band of dignitaries become battle-hardened survivalists fighting for the orcs’ homeland and independence. “How does this tie into the larger War of Immortals?” you might ask. Well, let’s just say that Gorum isn’t the only god who’s going to die during this event, and some ancestral pantheons are going to get hit harder than others. For more info, you’ll just have to wait until October!</p>

                   <p>In November, we round out the products we’re announcing today (though the consequences of the Godsrain and War of Immortals will continue into 2025 and beyond) with two exciting new releases. The first, <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02oal?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Divine-Mysteries">Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</a></em>, explores, well, the divine mysteries of the setting and provides an overview of the gods and faiths common throughout the Age of Lost Omens, reflecting the changes to the setting brought about by the War of Immortals. You’ll notice that Arazni is featured prominently on the cover, and that’s because she’s graduating into the ranks of the Core Twenty to fill the vacancy left with Gorum’s death. While she won’t take on his mantle of war, she will nevertheless rise to more and more prominence within the setting as a new status quo materializes.</p>

                   <p>Finally, November also sees the return of long-format Pathfinder fiction to print with the much-anticipated <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02sx8?Pathfinder-Godsrain">Pathfinder Godsrain</a></em> by fan-favorite author Liane Merciel. Unlike previous novels published under the Pathfinder Tales brand from 2010 to 2017, <em>Godsrain </em>will debut as a deluxe hardcover with wraparound dustjacket and will feature Pathfinder’s popular Iconic heroes as its protagonists. In this exciting tale, Amiri, Ezren, Kyra, and Merisiel will witness Gorum’s death, receive their own nascent god-sparks, and even meet one of their patron deities as they take on a desperate quest to prevent the greatest threat Golarion has ever known from escaping an ancient prison. Can they use their unique talents, newfound mythic power, and the blessings of the Dawnflower to maintain the seal on the Dead Vault? You’ll just have to read and find out!</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The advent of the War of Immortals on Golarion will necessitate seasoned warriors, and we’re answering that call with the newly announced Battlecry! Class Playtest, launching on April 29, 2024. During this public playtest, players will have the chance to put two new war-themed classes through their paces before their release in an as-yet-unannounced product coming in 2025. The commander is a martial support class that can issue commands to her allies, granting them extra movement, actions, reactions, and more. The guardian is an armored tank, who can taunt opponents and maximize the effectiveness of heavy armor to be a bulwark against nearly any threat. Be sure to try these exciting new classes out in just a few weeks!</p>
                   <p>That’s all the announcements we have for now, but we’ll have a lot more to say about these releases and more in the coming months, beginning at PaizoCon in May. Until then, you can catch up on yesterday’s stream on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PaizoInc">Twitch or YouTube</a> and join the conversation here, on the Paizo Forums, or any of the many social media communities where Pathfinder fans congregate.</p>

                  <blockquote>
                   <p itemprop="description">One of my favorite places aboard the <em>Zoetrope</em> was the menagerie, where I would tend to the flora and fauna we’d taken aboard temporarily for further study. Unfortunately, things were decidedly less peaceful this evening as I raced up the steps to the upper deck, pausing to catch my breath before a small blue creature scampered past me along the ship’s outer railing, giving me a dreadful start.</p>
                   <p>“She’s still not eating, Baranthet.” Charikleia came around the side, gingerly navigating the narrow space between the railing and the <em>Zoetrope</em>'s menagerie. Through the structure’s glass walls—perfect for letting in natural light—I could see our other specimens settling in for the evening amid the lush vegetation, under ballast rocks, or near the drinking pond. The little blue creature, however, swiveled her enormous amber ears in my direction as Chari spoke, resolutely ignoring the seedcake in Chari’s hand.</p>
                   <p>“Hmmm.” I leaned down and peered at our guest, who chirped plaintively at me in a way that sounded like speech. “Chari—”</p>
                   <p>“I agree,” she said, already scribbling notes. “That sounded like language. Can you understand us, little one?”</p>
                   <p>The creature surveyed us solemnly, then without warning sprang from the railing and scrambled through a window.</p>
                   <p>I let out a rather undignified yelp of surprise and hustled to the nearest door, Chari following soon after. Dr. Pom was at the helm this evening (she was always a bit more alert at night), and the <em>Zoetrope</em> was well underway; we couldn’t have our small guest accidentally falling overboard!</p>
                   <p>The tiny patter of paws overhead led us upstairs to the mess deck, where, sure enough, the creature perched in the doorway to Grefu’s kitchen, sniffing the air with a disappointed look.</p>
                   <p>“Well now, who’s this?” Grefu turned from a simmering pot and looked from the creature to us. “I didn’t set a place for an honored guest.”</p>
                   <p>She emitted the sound—a word?—again, but Grefu looked as nonplussed as the rest of us.</p>
                   <p>“Well, it’s not Jotun or Thalassic,” muttered Chari, surely making a mental note for our records. Before I could reply, the creature shot between the legs of the chairs and dining table and tore back downstairs. Grefu shrugged and returned to his work as Chari and I gave chase.</p>
                   <p>The creature was perched on a crate as we came downstairs to the storage area but looked almost disapprovingly at us before scrambling down the stairs to the next flight. We heard a “Goodness! What—?” from Dr. Pom as the creature chirped at her and continued down another level, then a clang a few seconds later. She must have already reached the engine room on the next deck down.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>&nbsp;“Hey; I need that!” called Ten as the creature emerged clutching a small gear in her hands. She chirped at them, placed the gear gently on the ground, and took off once more.</p>
                   <p>“She’s very energetic,” I observed to Chari, pausing to catch my breath.</p>
                   <p>“And she’s not speaking Surki either,” said Chari, who seemed unaffected by our unexpected evening exercise. “Oh no!”</p>
                   <p>We heard a distant splash and ran down another level to find the creature sputtering and pulling herself out of the access pipe leading down to the aquatic deck. She looked rather affronted as Lythea swam up the pipe and broke the surface, inadvertently splashing a few droplets onto the creature’s head.</p>
                   <p>“So sorry, little one,” our navigator said, holding out a hand. “How can we help?”</p>
                   <p>The creature instead clambered up onto Chari’s arm, flicking water from her ears. She chirped again. It sounded so familiar! I was increasingly convinced that lyrical chirp was, in fact, a word in a language I’d heard before.</p>
                   <p>“I’m going to stop for my notes before we go back up,” Chari called over her shoulder, turning down the hall toward the crew quarters. I followed her, thinking to peruse my own small collection and check again for any clues as to this creature’s identity.</p>
                   <p>“Professor, is that you?” Telero opened the door at the end of the hall, emerging from the shuttle bay just as I stepped into my own room. “Hey, who’s this?”</p>
                   <p>The creature, catching a glimpse of the darkening sky through the branches of the shuttle bay door, squawked and leapt from Chari’s shoulder to her head, climbing up one of her horns and chattering at Telero. He quickly closed the door behind him and approached slowly. “Hey there, it’s okay, friend,” he said. “You’re safe. What’s your name?”</p>
                   <p>The creature blinked at him, then chirped that same familiar syllable.</p>
                   <p>Telero frowned in confusion. “Gold?”</p>
                   <p>I’d become distracted while opening the door to my own room, bemoaning the untidy stack of scrolls and maps I’d meant to organize the previous day, but I turned at this. “Wait, did you say—?”</p>
                   <p>The creature leapt from Chari’s head and shot into my cabin, papers flying as she disappeared under my desk. I crouched at once to see her clutching my long-missing volume of <em>The Thrilling Tales of Spiridendra</em> (so that’s where it had gone!). She chirped once more.</p>
                   <p>“She’s saying ‘gold’ in Fey,” Telero said, he and Chari crowding in behind me.</p>
                   <p>“Of course,” I breathed, looking back up at Chari.</p>
                   <p>“A marp!”</p>
                   <p>“They usually communicate in both Common and Fey, but perhaps this one is too young,” I reasoned, reaching out for the book as she began to lick its gold embossing experimentally. “Wait, please! I’ll trade you.” I slowly reached into my pocket and withdrew a gold piece. “Would you like to return to the menagerie? We’ll make sure you’re well fed!”</p>
                   <p>The marp reluctantly relinquished her grip, but cheered up when she grasped the gold piece with her small hands. We climbed back up to the menagerie, the marp riding on Chari’s shoulder and crunching happily.</p>
                   <p>The rest of the crew gathered around to exclaim over our guest and her unique menu. (Ten dashed off and returned with an armful of metal scraps to see if the marp found anything else to her liking, but as you’ll see in Charikleia’s notes, gold remains the preferred meal.) As I looked around at my companions, the moonlight streaming through the menagerie’s glass dome, a wave of joy overcame me, as it has so often done on this journey—the joy of discovery, of reaching shared understanding, and of building communities. The joy of belonging.</p>
                   <p>The <em>Zoetrope</em> hummed quietly under our feet, whisking us away to our next adventure.</p>

                     Baranthet Zamendi cultivated his love of the natural world at a young age, enamored with his grandmother’s awe-inspiring tales of the legendary Wardens of the Wild. He briefly attended Almas University before returning home to rebuild Droon’s public library, eventually becoming its head archivist. His upcoming book on the crew of the <em>Zoetrope</em> and their search for the wardens is his first, but he’s already planning his next adventure.</p>

Sallé is a senior editor at Paizo and has written for numerous Pathfinder and Starfinder books, including more of Baranthet’s tale in<em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, the primal treatise and witch journals in <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>, and <em>Starfinder Bounty #12: Under Pressure</em>. When she’s not extolling the virtues of the en dash, she enjoys playing as many narrative games as her schedule allows and wandering the woods with her Disreputable Dog.</p>

                   <p>Good morning, explorers! While we’ve taken a look at the crew you’ll see throughout <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, we realized there’s one more character we still needed to introduce: the <em>Zoetrope</em> itself! This unique airship serves as a home to our eccentric crew as they search Golarion for the Wardens of the Wild and features its own onboard menagerie, darkroom, research deck, and aquarium for all their exploratory needs.</p>

                   <p>It's hard to believe our foray through the Zoetrope logs is at a close. But this is just a taste of Baranthet’s story, and we hope that you’ll want to take part when <em>Howl of the Wild</em> releases next month. Look forward to seeing some more tidbits about all the creatures, options, items, and more coming in the book, and let us know what sort of expedition <em>your</em> characters are thinking about going on!</p>
                   <p>But that, explorers, is a story for another day.</p>

                  <p><strong>What is a game jam?</strong><br>
                    A game jam is an event designed to create something from scratch during a timed period. In this case, all entries will be due no later than <strong>May 1st, 2024.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>What is the game jam theme?</strong><br></p>
                  <p>The theme marries with the PaizoCon 2024 theme: <em>Educate, Entertain, and Inspire!</em></p>
                  <p><strong>Who can participate?</strong><br>
                    Anyone! All you need is a customer account for DriveThru sites.</p>
                  <p><strong>Why should I participate? </strong><br>
                    Aside from it’s a blast to jam together with the community, you’ll get promotions from Paizo, DriveThruRPG, and Pathfinder/Starfinder Infinite; you will be providing a very cool option for GMs to bring to their table; and you’ll be challenging yourself as a creator or bringing an idea from your table to life.</p>
                  <p><strong>What are the rules?</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>Must fit one page, double sided. <em>(Technically, it will be two pages of a single-page PDF or a two-page spread. When someone prints it out, they’ll have one sheet with information front and back)</em></li>
                   <li>Must be uploaded to Pathfinder Infinite or Starfinder Infinite before <strong>May 1st, 2024</strong>.</li>
                   <li>Must follow the <a href="https://help.pathfinderinfinite.com/hc/en-us/categories/12777144310039-Community-Content-Creator-Questions">Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite Guidelines</a></li>
                   <li>When you’re finished setting up your title, please keep it <strong>private</strong>. We will turn all of them to be available for purchase slightly before PaizoCon.</li>
                   <li>Email <a href="mailto:meredith@roll20.net">meredith@roll20.net</a> with a link to your private URL, your customer email, and a two-sentence synopsis.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Do you have a font size restriction? </strong></p>
                  <p>No. You’re welcome to make the font any size you’d like, but we recommend at least 9.5 for readability.</p>
                  <p><strong>Do I have to put artwork in?</strong></p>
                  <p>Not a requirement! We recommend keeping it simple so people can easily print it out. You’re welcome to also make a printer-friendly version to upload alongside your submission (so, two files!) if your submission needs color, art, and flourish!</p>
                  <p><strong>I submitted my title. Now what?</strong></p>
                  <p>Pathfinder Infinite/Starfinder Infinite will notify you when it is live and when Paizo posts a “round up” promoting it the week of PaizoCon.</p>
                  <p><strong>Can I make changes? Won’t that cause problems for the URL I send?</strong></p>
                  <p>You are welcome to make changes to your submission—the PDF(s), the description, title—at any time.</p>
                  <p><strong>Can I charge for this?</strong></p>
                  <p>Absolutely! Infinite Masters are recommending at least 99 cents. You are not required to charge but we always recommend it because you should charge for the work you did!&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>We cannot wait to see what you create!</p>

                  <p itemprop="description">Hello, everyone! Today we’re giving you a sneak peek into our two upcoming multi-table interactive events for the 2024 Paizo Organized Play season!</p>
                  <p>Every year, Pathfinder Organized Play and Starfinder Organized Play each release one multi-table event that can be played with as few as three tables and well over 150+ tables at the world’s largest gaming events. These are intended to be epic adventures where players work alongside each other to accomplish monumental feats and battle great evils. In the past, these events were tied to key story points for Organized Play. In recent years, our special events have been standalone adventures that tell exciting but isolated stories, making them usable at conventions and special events for many years to come. This year, we’re continuing this trend, with two exciting interactive events that are standalone, so they can be enjoyed by anyone at any time.</p>
                  <p>Debuting at PaizoCon 2024, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ezb?Starfinder-Society-Special-699-The-End-Awakens"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-99: The End Awakens</em></a> is an adventure for 1st- through 4th-level characters written by Joseph Blomquist and Mike Kimmel.</p>
                  <p>Every year the Starfinder Society dispatches agents to perform initial exploration and surveys of hundreds of worlds, identifying resources, cataloging biological samples, mapping terrain, and initiating peaceful contact. This year is no different. …Or is it?</p>
                  <p>Respected Starfinder Palivhar Chooser of Hues, has recently discovered a planet they believe to be Krethiskar, a “missing” planet in the distant Szandite Collective that failed to reconnect after the Gap. Keen on investigating further, Palivhar leads an expedition of rookie Starfinders to Krethiskar’s surface, to conduct initial surveys and routine testing.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately for the Starfinder Society, Krethiskar is a huskworld consumed by the voracious Swarm in ages past, and this mission is anything but routine. Palivhar’s survey expedition is doomed to become a desperate fight for survival, as the hibernating Swarm awaken. Can you escape the planet alive?</p>
                  <p>I hope you join us on Krethiskar for this year’s interactive special!</p>

                  <p>Premiering at Gen Con 2024, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-00: Salt of the Ocean</em> is an adventure for 1st- through 8th-level characters written by Rigby Bendele and Jacob W. Michaels.</p>
                  <p>As the year turns over and different events start to pick up across Golarion, two things of interest are discovered as the Eye of Abendego, the massive hurricane off the coast of the Mwangi Expanse, shifts and turns. The first is a shipwreck of an old Pathfinder ship, <em>the Whippoorwill,</em> and the second is an island of legend spoken only in the stories of the crumbled Ghol-Gan empire, the Island of Teeth and Terror.</p>
                  <p>Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind has reached out to the Pathfinder Society to inform them of both discoveries, prompting an expedition to see what can be found on both the ship and the island. However, the Island of Teeth and Terror is also the goal of the notorious pirate Sharkskin, spurred on by xir companion and mentor, Enava, who has her own plans for the nephilim and the island.</p>
                  <p>Can the Pathfinders put a stop to these nefarious plans? Can you survive the threats within the Abendego Ocean?</p>
                  <p>Gather your sea legs, Pathfinders!</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p itemprop="description"><em>Despite my apprehension at reading about the deaths of so many of Golarion’s gods and my continuing belief that these </em>Godsrain Prophecies <em>cannot be taken at their word, I still feel a bit wistful about reaching the end of my analysis. While it is certainly possible that there are other prophecies in this vein, this is the last that I will read before delivering the collection to my Lady. </em></p>
                  <p><em>I am not sure why I feel so hesitant to put this work aside. Of course, there is something satisfying about feeling like you are a part of important research, even if the experience of it is less than pleasant. (I think here of those who have documented the beliefs of faiths that are somewhat more difficult to understand, as in</em> To Scream Is Divine: My Year at a Nidalese Temple <em>and its somewhat more uneven follow-up,</em> Kuthite Lullabies<em>.) Beyond that, though, I believe I will miss the gods themselves—or at least the insights into them that these texts have given me, even when I don’t believe a word that I am reading.</em></p>
                  <p><em>After reviewing the entirety of the</em> Godsrain Prophecies<em>, I am confident in one thing and one thing only: that the author has been made privy, whether through prophecy or otherwise, to the fact that one of Golarion’s gods will die. The preoccupation with the subject of a dead god, accuracy of some of the smaller details, and feeling of anticipation throughout are compelling evidence in favor of my theory. With all the contradictions and confusions in the text, though, I do not believe that the author knows which god, how they die, or why. </em></p>
                  <p><em>Unfortunately, this is where my certainty ends, as there are several different reasons why the author may have taken this information and used it to create the prophecies. It is possible that they feared what might happen and wrote these prophecies as a warning, attempting to prevent the dangers they dreamed up. It is also possible that they hope the death will be a destabilizing event, and that they intended for these prophecies to weaken faith and trust in the gods, making them easier to abandon in the aftermath of a catastrophe. There is no way to know, as I will admit to my Lady; I hope that in her wisdom, she can discern the truth.</em></p>
                  <p><em>If nothing else, as with all futures, only time will tell.</em></p>

                  <h2>The “Death” of Rovagug</h2>
                  <p>The chant starts as a whisper—an idle piece of pillow talk on nights Sarenrae cannot sleep, her fingertips gone marching on the canvas that is Shelyn’s back, her hands casting surging shadows onto Desna’s resting arm. She weaves a tale of how to win the battle that she hungers for, imagining alliances that span across the Great Beyond and speaking life to victory until the passion of her dream becomes a shared ambition. All three lovers make mention of it, idly, to those who share their interests, pitched in a tone and timbre meant to echo in the listener’s chest. The message drums with nostalgia tinged with rage and thirst for justice long delayed, and it is passed along from ear to ear until it finally circles back, a call to action with the deadly urgency of war.</p>
                  <p><em>Imprisonment is not enough. Rovagug must die.</em></p>
                  <p>There are more gods now than there were when Rovagug was sealed away, and many sign up for the quest to kill the Great Destroyer, to stand alongside Abadar and Gozreh and Calistria. Some do so to show their mettle, some to gather bragging rights, and some to reassure themselves that if there is something to gain, they won’t leave empty-handed. Sarenrae worries, privately, that many do not understand the danger they’ve signed up for, but she takes the names and notes the skills and hands the roles out all the same—rear guard to those who fear but fight, support for those who dwell in hope, melee for those who want to feel the blood beneath their fingers.</p>
                  <p>At first, it seems too easy. Asmodeus unlocks the seal that leads into the Dead Vault and gods pour through in something like a line. Wrackworms turn from feasting on the Rough Beast’s flesh to face them, but fall to sword and spell and scythe as if they were an afterthought, slicking the ground around themselves with remnants of their dying. After the cheers and murmurs fade, a gnawing silence fills the air, thick and dank and hungry, and for a moment, no one moves, a huddled mass of godhood waiting for something to happen.</p>
                  <p>Then Rovagug is everywhere—suddenly, impossibly. Rending, clawing, tearing open, shoveling exalted flesh into his waiting mouths. Apsu’s wing is torn asunder. Hei Feng’s feathers fall like rain. Grandmother Spider holds her own, her arms a whirling blur of blades, but watches as Thamir falls still, body crushed beneath a claw, and Hanspur drowns a second time, awash in his own blood. But Rovagug, despite his power, cannot overcome them all, and soon the tide of battle changes, rattling the prison’s walls as gods press their advantages, slamming his body side to side—an endless, rhythmic dying.</p>
                  <p>With each impact on the Dead Vault’s walls, Golarion is shaken. Buildings tumble into streets. Rivers shift to find new banks. Old trees flatten forests. Volcanoes long thought dormant, from Taldor to the Five Kings Mountains, spit dense ash into the sky, blanketing the life around them and blocking out the sun. The Eye of Abendego expands twofold, turning the Mwangi Expanse into newly Sodden Lands. When Rovagug is finally still, Sarenrae standing by his head with her arms held high in victory, the gods emerge from the Dead Vault to find a world that thinks the end has come.</p>
                  <p>After all the dead are mourned, no one agrees on what comes next. The aftermath grows tense and bitter, victory turned vicious. With Rovagug no threat to them, godly alliances feel heavier, a burden to be shrugged off or set down and ignored. How to rebuild a ruined land becomes the stuff of smaller wars—Abadar feuds with Erastil, Irori shuns Iomedae, Sarenrae feels the weight of blame hurled at her from every corner, and Norgorber sides with anyone who might advance his cause. But while they bicker here and now, the gods may yet unite again, as deep in Avistani soil, disturbed by distant tremors, the worst of Rovagug’s spawn have felt their prison falter and ready for destruction that would make their sire proud.</p>

                  <p><em>That is certainly one way to end things. If I am being honest, the idea of Rovagug trapped within the bowels of Golarion has always made me a bit nervous, but it seems it may be better than the alternative! Which gives me one final idea as to why these prophecies exist—perhaps they argue against change and tell those who read them that, even for those gods whom you might fear or hate, the status quo is better than anything new that you might long for—a desperate version of a wish that, no matter what they have seen coming, it would be best for things to continue as they are. Sadly for the author, change, I believe, is inevitable. I hope only that we are ready and that we meet it, heads held high and wings outstretched, however and whenever it comes.</em></p>

                  <p itemprop="description">From first light to sunset, the Indraracha Institute bustles with activity. The docks continually ferry people in and out of the campus. Meal, study, repeat—every day is a routine at the academy, a routine strengthening the minds and sharpening the skills of the future sorcerers and politicians of Tang Mai.</p>
                  <p>For one young boy, though, things were different. School was just school. Sometimes, all he wanted to do was to just run around, not bury himself nose-deep in a book about the nation’s history. One morning, he was doing just that—running through the halls of the Institute, weaving between his classmates that filled rooms and corridors studying all things magical.</p>
                  <p>Asok’s circuit ended in one of the many gardens. Resting under a tall banyan tree, the boy began to doze off. He snapped his eyes open when he heard a familiar voice.</p>
                  <p>“What are you doing here?” A tattooed young man strode over, a basket of herbs in hand.</p>
                  <p>“Thanom!” The boy scrambled up to his feet, putting his hands together in a greeting. “I’m just on my way to study hall... unless you need help in the gardens?” He gave a wide grin.</p>
                  <p>“And take you away from your studies? Your instructors will have my head! And if I’m gone, there will be even fewer people who tolerate your behavior.” He pulled out a mangosteen and handed the fruit to Asok. “Now go to class. Next time I need help, <em>I’ll</em> come to <em>you</em>. When you’re not trying to hide from your instructors.”</p>
                  <p>Asok gave another huge grin to the alchemist before rushing off to his class, conveniently located in a quieter corner of the Institute. He tucked himself alongside his classmates as they all settled in, twisting open the mangosteen and eating the meat inside. Mali, his seatmate, glared. In return, he smiled and offered a piece to her, but she turned her head away in annoyance.</p>
                  <p>“Remember, students, placement tests are coming up soon. While you all are young, it’s important you take your exams seriously.” Teacher Chai walked around, handing out textbooks. “We want to make sure you all end up learning subjects you enjoy and excel at.”</p>
                  <p>Asok opened the book to the lines, “Sorcerer diplomats provide the Chaophaya counsel and identify magical phenomena to aid them in their rule. Following the precepts of the Indraracha Institute, diplomats must be impartial...” The text was dizzying.</p>
                  <p>“Aiyyyyy, I’m tired,” he groaned.</p>
                  <p>“Shhhhh!” Mali nudged him. “Stop complaining. You’re going to get us in trouble.”</p>
                  <p>“It’s hot and it’s sooooo boring.” Asok began fanning himself with the textbook.</p>
                  <p>“It’s always hot,” the girl reminded him, “and you say everything is boring.”</p>
                  <p>Asok nudged her back. In a huff, they both started jostling each other, though mostly in jest.</p>
                  <p>Their instructor eyed them with suspicion, but before he could say anything, sparks coalesced in the air.</p>
                  <p>“Teacher Chai!” An illusion of an older student sprung into being. “Apologies for the disturbance—we could use some assistance with an artifact in the south research laboratory.”</p>
                  <p>“Of course. Right away.” The instructor turned to the class, saying, “Now, students, be diligent while I’m gone,” before hurrying out.</p>
                  <p>In the heat and humidity, diligent self-study didn’t last long. Mischievous as ever, Asok got to his feet and reached for the magic within him. A small flame sparked to life in his hand.</p>
                  <p>“Asok, stop,” Mali chided. “You shouldn’t be doing that.”</p>
                  <p>“Come on, we’re studying, right?” Asok juggled the flame between his fingers. “If we don’t break anything, it’s fine. Unless you’re a scaredy-cat?”</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>“Am not!” She frowned before standing up, a spell coming to her as easy as breath. “You know I’m sooooo much better than you at casting.”</p>
                  <p>Students discarded their textbooks and started chatting among themselves. In a moment, the alcove filled with all sorts of spells. A young nagaji girl conjured a bubble of water and began shaping it into a flower. Another student drew a monstrous face on a nearby stone before levitating it to chase their classmates through the alcove.</p>
                  <p>Between the two rival factions, a heated competition quickly drew the class’s attention. Mali shot her hand up in the air, spraying an array of bright colors. The crowd was mesmerized with the lights. She gave her opponent a playful grin.</p>
                  <p>Asok huffed, “It’s just colors—isn’t this so much cooler?” He caught the ember in his fist before shooting it out. The small burst of fire cut through the rainbow. The boy puffed his chest in pride.</p>
                  <p>The “oooohs” from the crowd turned to a giggle as Mali wiggled her fingers and a second image of Asok appeared next to him. While crude, the illusion was unmistakably of the boy. It hopped around, flexing in an exaggerated manner. Asok frowned at his double, which frowned back.</p>
                  <p>Not to be outdone, Asok threw his memory and being back into his blood, finding the might of elementals. He breathed in deep before releasing a gust of flame that spilled from his lips and billowed outwards. The fire dispersed the illusion before launching upward to the sky. Asok was careful to not let it hit Mali or their classmates, but the size of the breath was growing larger than he could control. The expanding heat licked the roof of the outdoor galleries that surrounded their study area, lighting up small pieces of foliage.</p>
                  <p>“Asok! Look what you did,” Mali yelled, taking a step back from the sparks.</p>
                  <p>“I didn’t mean to,” Asok stammered, ashamed about his mistake. “I—I’m sorry!”</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;“Come on, we have to stop this before Teacher Chai comes back.”</p>
                  <p>The nagaji student guided her water magic to the fire. While it extinguished some of it, the flames were spreading faster than she could handle. The class chipped in with various spells, with little impact.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly, a chill wind gusted through the alcove, frost trailing in its wake and collecting on the stones. The winds roared across the roof, blowing the fires out as easily as candles, making Asok and Mali shiver and clutch their arms close despite the fires and the Tang Mai sun. Turning around, the students saw Teacher Chai with an expressionless face, magic still trailing from his fingers as his incantation left him.</p>
                  <p>“Spellcraft is not allowed without instructor supervision at your age.” Teacher Chai said sternly as he walked toward the panicked students. “I expected as much from you, Asok. But you, Mali...”</p>
                  <p>“I—I—I’m sorry, Teacher!” Mali bowed her head, “We tried to stop it ourselves. We know it was wrong, but—”</p>
                  <p>The teacher put a hand up to stop the student. “While you all showed responsibility in fixing your mistakes, magic is volatile. One misstep, one wrong incantation, can cause chaos. Now, back to your studies.”</p>
                  <p>As the young students began to quiet down and shrink themselves back into their texts, Teacher Chai looked at Asok and Mali. “Though, I must admit it was quite the impressive feat. You two have the makings of incredible sorcerers.”</p>

                  <p>The mods at r/Pathfinder2e saw a need to help bring Pathfinder to new players, and thus Beginner Box Days were born! This year, events will be running <strong>between April 13th and April 21st</strong>. Using the power of the internet, we have been able to connect new players hungry to try Pathfinder Second Edition with experienced GMs. So, how can you get involved?</p>
                  <div class="blurbCenter">
                   <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2338a9e6-f843-4c5f-a098-ce1375c189c9/BeginnerBoxDay_Splashimage_2024.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2338a9e6-f843-4c5f-a098-ce1375c189c9/BeginnerBoxDay_Splashimage_2024.png" width="90%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Beginner Box Days: April 13th to the 21st - BeginPF2.com"></a>
                   <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p><strong>RUN A GAME!</strong> GMs can register their game at RPGChronicles.net using event code <strong>2716006</strong>. Once you set up events for both the Upper and Lower levels, players will be able to join your game starting TODAY! You can run games in your local time zone or even in a non-English language to help introduce the next generation of Pathfinder players to the game. Just make sure to get a Beginner Box module version for your VTT of choice or request a FREE PDF copy from Paizo through our form at <strong>BeginPF2.com</strong>.</p>
                  <p><strong>PLAY A GAME!</strong> Starting TODAY players can register themselves for both levels of Paizo’s remastered Beginner Box adventure: <em>Menace under Otari</em>! Each level is designed to slowly introduce the player to important aspects of the game, from combat to skills to puzzles! The Upper Level is the starter level, where you’ll investigate Tamily Tanderveil’s basement to investigate who (or what) is stealing her fish. This level is best for people who are brand new to playing Pathfinder or any TTRPG. The Lower level introduces more challenges as you begin to uncover the menace under the logging town of Otari, putting your new skills to the ultimate test! Players can play one level, or both, by finding a slot that matches their availability and signing up on <strong>BeginPF2.com</strong>.</p>
                  <p><strong>EARN SOCIETY CREDIT!</strong> Both GMs and players can earn society credit that you can use on your first official character. The Beginner Box is played in Adventure Mode so you can try any class or ancestry that your GM will allow, or play any of Paizo’s remastered pregenerated characters if you just want to get rolling! To earn society credit, simply add your Paizo Organized Play number on RPGChronicles when you create or sign up to a game. We will be reporting all sessions, but it is not necessary to join Pathfinder Society to participate in Beginner Box Days.</p>
                  <p>Paizo has also given us a stack of vouchers we’ll be raffling off to players and GMs, which we’ll distribute after all games are reported. Also, <em>Rise of the Rulelords</em> podcast <em>and </em>Team + Publishing are giving away 3 physical remastered Beginner Boxes, and Team + will be raffling away bundles of their best-selling class expansions! <strong>So don’t wait! Begin your next adventure, or help someone start their own at BeginPF2.com!</strong></p>

                  <h2>Convention News</h2>
                  <p>Convention season is in full swing! There are dozens of local conventions happening this spring around the world and online. Check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Paizo Conventions Calendar</a> for details on everything going on in the months to come.</p>
                  <p>Of course, the convention looming largest on my mind is PaizoCon! We’re less than two months away from Paizo’s first major convention of the year, and I cannot wait. <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sijd?Get-Your-Tickets-for-PaizoCon-Online-2024">Badges are on sale now</a>; stay tuned to the blog later today for more news on signing up for events.</p>
                  <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
                  <p>The Pathfinder Remaster has gained another pillar! Last week we released <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em>, available now on paizo.com or at your FLGS (with an exclusive sketch cover!). Sanctioning for <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em> has also been added to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions#monster-core">Pathfinder Character Options page</a>, though the vast majority of this content is only relevant for those of you with summoning spells.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> got a slight tweak thanks to the Remaster. Any deity who grants <em>dreaming potential</em> instead grants their followers <em>illusory scene</em>, effective immediately.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, I botched the calendar, so the sanctioning documents for <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em> have been delayed slightly. At press time for this blog, they’re not ready yet, but I expect them to be available very soon!</p>
                  <p>This month sees the release of the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>, the first of our two Tian Xia-focused books, to be followed by the Tian Xia Character Guide at the end of August. I expect sanctioning for this book to go live on street date! After that, May sees two exciting releases with <em>Howl</em><em> of the Wild</em> and <em>Mechageddon!</em>, the final Adventure Path for Starfinder First Edition.</p>
                  <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                  <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                  <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                  <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>
                  <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Joel Hager</p>
                  <p>That’s all from me this month, folks! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the eclipse!</p>

                  <p><em>Unfortunately, this need for clarity means that I must dismiss (or at least deemphasize) one of the more exciting ideas I have come up with thus far: that these are a collection of the gods’ fears. I have noted throughout these pages that there are responses to the gods’ deaths in each of the prophecies that seem out of character, either for the other gods or their followers, but I don’t believe this lack of consistency is due to these being reflections of what a god would worry over. In truth, I am not sure that gods fear anything at all. Is fear not driven by a sense of mortality, or at least, the potential for one’s role in the world to change or end at a moment’s notice? I wonder if, instead, the “prophecies” are intended to help the gods develop fear, to remind them that they are not beyond the reach of death and give them a small taste of mortal terror. Though to what end, I do not know. Who would want to give a god a nightmare?</em></p>

                  <h2>The “Death” of Irori</h2>
                  <p>Irori is not one for dying. Death is common. Death is normal. Death is there for mortals who have not yet mastered how to reach new levels of perfection, who have not willed themselves into attaining the divine. Death might take some weaker god if given the right circumstances, starting with those cheaters who let the <em>Starstone</em> grant them power, grabbing godhood like some prize for drunks and thieves and zealots. But for a god like him, who’d worked and willed himself to godhood? Death is something of the past and he is moving forward.</p>
                  <p>Irori’s never rested long, no matter his successes. There’s always some new path to take at any well-earned milestone, some new technique to master, some new knowledge to find. Yes, it was good to be a god, if for no other reason than to share new possibilities with those who’d turn their will toward doing better with their lives. But he is one of many gods—some virtuous, some indolent—and so there must be something more, some way that he can still evolve. Some new route toward perfection.</p>
                  <p>Irori works with diligence, the way that he has always done, reaching beyond the world he’s known to better what he has become. Until one day, he grasps it all—the spaces in the sum of things, the power in the truth of everything that was or will be. And though total enlightenment is only for a moment, slipping between his fingers like a cloud of windblown sand, he still can feel the barrier between himself and something more, as pliable and thin as what once kept him from divinity. While he has it in his reach, he passes through the boundary, as bracing and as easy as a step through falling water. Irori, once a mortal, is now much more than deity.</p>
                  <p>Irori savors everything, if only for a moment. He takes a breath in every plane, his heartbeat now a multiverse, and feels the coursing power as it crashes through his veins. But he has departed our reality, has left a tear along the border of the way of things, and everything, on every plane, begins to shift toward him, as if he were a beacon for something within the Great Beyond—a single life, a single god, become a singularity. Gruhastha is the first to fall, the Keeper’s arms stretched uselessly, hands grasping at the emptiness he finds beside Irori’s feet. He’s swallowed by a void that somehow still contains a multitude, his body torn asunder in a bright and blissful darkness, his lips mouthing his gratitude, his throat choking on screams.</p>
                  <p>Irori is a magnet now, pulling those closest to him; Chaldira’s luck lost in a cry while Magrim’s runes go tumbling, some force dragging them both to places even he can’t follow. All he can do is close the gap before it sunders everything, using the power that he holds, still far beyond what it once was, to fix whatever he has done (or is doing or one day will, time half-unraveling in his hands). As he repairs the barrier, still dripping with the power that he touched from passing through it, Zon-Kuthon comes to stand beside him, image of the blinding void reflected in his longing eyes, and Nethys tries to touch the power nestled just beneath his skin, hands clawing unknown patterns of magic in the air. Both soon become his shadows, hounding every move he tries to make, Zon-Kuthon chasing memories and Nethys seeking answers, with Torag always close behind, holding his brother Magrim’s blade with vengeance on his mind. Some of Irori’s followers also trail behind him; those who were deep in prayer at the moment that he moved beyond, unable to unsee the void, dedicate themselves to its return, doing whatever they can to hasten the end of all things.</p>
                  <p>But Irori has a new path now, divinity left far behind as he masters the power that’s now deep within his bones. He sees things now—beneath the ground, between the breaths, inside the skin—and knows that they will take him where Gruhastha and the rest have gone, that what tore them apart will help him make himself anew. If there are prayers for him to hear, he is no longer listening. If rakshasas take his guise and use his faith to build their power? If Urgathoa’s clerics tell his followers that next time he will end the world and they should eat and drink and die with no thought for tomorrow? How can he care when there’s a new path for him to gain perfection? And if the world unmakes itself, if he had to unmake the world, if that brings him enlightenment, then that’s what it must be.</p>

                  <p><em>Well, that was certainly involved. Multiverses? Singularities? Bright voids? And yet, in all of that, I almost see a pattern. I have tried not to reference other prophecies in my notes here; if my Lady chooses to read them out of the original order that I chose, I would hate for her to learn a piece of information in these notes that would be better divulged by the original text. Still, I am reminded of the prophecy regarding Desna, which also mentions a void. And there are similarities between this prophecy and the one for Nethys, not only in their reciprocal mentions but in their fascination with the fundamental properties of our universe. Perhaps instead of looking at the prophecies individually, I should be looking for these types of commonalities—could things that are repeated be elements of some underlying message, or a hint as to what among these “prophecies” might be true amidst the overstatements and suppositions? If there was ever a time to make a chart, that time is upon us.</em></p>

                  <p itemprop="description">The next morning dawned bright and clear, no trace of the previous day’s storm left on the horizon. Dr. Pom joined me on the research deck for our customary morning tea, sipping in companionable silence until we’d finished our first cup and were contemplating our second.</p>
                  <p>“How are you feeling, Baranthet?” she asked kindly as she held out her cup for a refill. “That was an intense day of travel yesterday.”</p>
                  <p>“Quite well, thank you,” I said as I poured, reveling in the wisps of aromatic steam rising from our mugs. “How are you? Are you used to storms like that where you’re from?”</p>
                  <p>She took a moment to consider this, her eyes following the gulls soaring over the cliffs. “We did have some mighty storms, yes, but it’s different now,” she said thoughtfully. “The instinct to seek shelter is the same, of course, but there’s... a deeper appreciation, I suppose. A sense of thinking about the past and the future, whereas before there was only the present moment. I find joy in their beauty and feel appreciation for the sheer primal power of the skies. Though,” she said with a laugh, “I never expected to be <em>flying</em> in those skies in the middle of one!”</p>
                  <p>“Neither did I,” I admitted, grinning. “A humbling and awe-inspiring experience, to be sure!”</p>
                  <p>We sat in comfortable silence for a while as the others drifted in for breakfast or set about their tasks for the day. I wondered idly where my <em>Spiridendra</em> book had gone and what we might find next in our journey as I watched Telero and Ten examine one of the ship’s wings—they’d been busy checking and recalibrating this and that after the flight through the storm the day before. For my part, it was nice to have a slower morning before returning to the expedition.</p>
                  <p>“It’s wild, isn’t it,” Dr. Pom said softly, “looking back on the changes you’ve weathered in your life?” Her eyes met mine, and though we were close in years, I sensed she wasn’t talking merely about aging.</p>
                  <p>“I certainly never thought I’d go from ink-stained librarian to bold explorer,” I said fervently, and she chuckled, her small spectacles slipping down her striped snout. “When you awakened, did you ever plan on having such adventures?”</p>
                  <p>“It was hard to make plans at all, at first.” She adjusted her glasses and looked back out over the cliffs. “Awakening is... a turbulent time, for most. There’s a lot of information to process all at once, and many of us are overwhelmed by the concept of a vaster and more specific future than what we’d previously had the capacity to consider. But I always felt called to be a healer,” she added, and smiled again. “I know what it’s like to be hurt, and afraid. It gladdens me to provide comfort and support where I can.”</p>
                  <p>I reflected on this as I watched Telero hoist Ten higher up the wing, where they began to hammer at one of its joints. Suddenly, tension released in an explosive pop, the wing springing back into place… and catapulting our mechanic overboard, falling past Telero’s arms to land with a thud and a yelp in the water below.</p>
                  <p>“Goodness, not again!” Dr. Pom and I were on our feet at once, tea abandoned. Grefu surfaced in the waves near our mechanic (no doubt he was enjoying his morning constitutional), and swam Ten over to the research deck, hoisting them aboard. Their eyes blinked rapidly at us as we gathered around.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Pom knelt next to them, illuminating the lamp at her shoulder and setting her bag down as she looked them over.</p>

                  <p>“It’s my fault, Professor,” Telero said in anguish. “I tried to catch them—”</p>
                  <p>“It is not his fault; the wing was badly jammed from the storm; it was more badly misaligned than I thought,” Ten chirped in their customary staccato tone, their eyes glittering as Dr. Pom shone her light in one and then the other. “Do not fret; I feel fine; and that should be the last of the repairs!”</p>
                  <p>“I keep telling you to use your safety lines when you’re doing repairs,” said Dr. Pom, ignoring this tale of triumph as she peered into her patient’s eyes. “You seem coherent, but I’d like to confirm, please. What’s your name?”</p>
                  <p>“Whose Antenna Is Askew,” they replied promptly, wiggling the appendage in question. “You know me; I am the ship’s mechanic; you’ve patched me up many times before.”</p>
                  <p>Dr. Pom smiled wryly and looked up at me. “They’re all right.” She rummaged about in her belt, retrieving a slip of paper and weighing several powders and herbs onto it. “Take this before you tuck in tonight. It should help your carapace mend.”</p>
                  <p>An aggrieved Telero relaxed slightly next to me as Ten withdrew the frayed checkered cloth that was always at their toolbelt and dried their face. “Telero; now the repairs are done; do you want to check the cliffs for geodes?” they said, pointing at the shore.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Pom and I left the young friends to their explorations as they boarded the airskiff for shore, but I checked in on our mechanic later that evening. They were in the engine room, as usual, cleaning various gears and leaning close to the engine to listen to its steady hum.</p>
                  <p>I knocked on the doorframe. “Doing all right, Ten?”</p>
                  <p>They jumped and dropped what appeared to be an armful of wrenches, the tools clanging on the floor and narrowly missing their feet. “So sorry; you surprised me; please come in; hello.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh! The fault is mine,” I said, crouching down to help them collect everything. “You’re still feeling well?”</p>
                  <p>Ten nodded. “My carapace is very tough; it’s held up through worse falls; I am fine; thank you.”</p>
                  <p>I smiled at their earnest assurances. “I’m glad to hear it! And the <em>Zoetrope</em>? Everything running smoothly?”</p>
                  <p>“Running like a dream,” Ten said, casting their expert eye over the complex machinery that made our expedition possible. “The good kind of dream; the ones with friends; and cookies; and adventures. Like what we have.”</p>
                  <p>How had I been so fortunate as to find such bright, kind, brave, and talented companions? “Like what we have,” I agreed, handing over the last of the wrenches. “A dream come—”</p>
                  <p>“Come quick!” a voice yelled from above. “One of the specimens has escaped from the menagerie!”</p>

                  <p>Hi everyone! James here again to talk about the last two ancestries featured in <em>Howl of the Wild</em>. We’ve saved the awakened animal and surki for last, as they’re quite different from the ancestries we’ve put out so far! Each uses its heritage in a pretty different way than any ancestries we’ve published previously, so we’ll be previewing those here instead of some feats.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;The awakened animal freely chooses their size (from Tiny to Large) as a part of character creation, which also determines their starting Hit Points. Afterward, they choose a heritage that represents their general body plan. Your heritage will usually give you some suggestions for an unarmed attack that replaces the fist attack that most ancestries get, but given how broad the animal world is—some aquatic animals have wing attacks, after all—these are treated as suggestions to work out with your GM rather than as hard restrictions. The climbing animal heritage showcased below is great for a bipedal animal, like Dr. Pom.</p>
                  <h3>Climbing Animal Heritage</h3>
                  <p>You are an animal whose limbs are adapted to grab, climb, and brachiate. You might be dexterous and ready to use tools like a chimpanzee or otter, or you may simply be a quick climber like a bear, raccoon, or sloth.</p>
                  <p>You have a land Speed of 20 feet, a climb Speed of 20 feet, and one animal attack of your choice (typically claw, fist, or jaws; see the animal attacks sidebar).&gt;[?</p>
                  <p>Surkis also approach heritages in an unusual way. Surkis absorb magic as larva and young adults, which accumulates in nodes throughout their bodies. All surkis freely choose a tradition of magic at character creation that represents the type of magic they most consumed as a larva, which affects the tradition of their magical abilities (plus a few others). Then, they also choose a heritage. A surki can then, later in life, undergo metamorphosis to develop these nodes into unique magic-projecting organs. Each surki heritage has a base ability as well as two possible directions they can evolve the ability later by taking feats such as the 9th-level Grand Metamorphosis. Surkis can even gain multiple heritages or change their heritage late in life with various feats as well! We can take a look at this with the light-emitting lantern surki heritage below:</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Lantern Surki</h3>
                  <p>The nodes in your abdomen are particularly luminous. You can use an Interact action to shed light from your abdomen in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). This is a magical light effect with a level equal to your own. You can change the color of the light or extinguish it with another Interact action.</p>
                  <p><b>Evolution</b> Your abdominal nodes have evolved into a pair of secondary limbs that project a magical focusing lens. You gain the Lantern Beam action.<br><b>Lantern Beam</b> [one-action] (light, fire, magical) <b>Requirements</b> Your lantern light is shining; <b>Effect</b> Your lenses focus your light into a searing beam. You deal 5d4 fire damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line, with a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. Your lantern light then extinguishes, and you can’t use this ability or use your lantern light again for 1d4 rounds. At 11th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.</p>
                  <p><b>Evolution</b> Secondary light emitters grow from your shoulder nodes that flash in time with your lantern. You gain the Lantern Strobe action.<br><b>Lantern Strobe</b> [two-actions] (light, magical, visual) <b>Frequency</b> once per hour; <b>Effect</b> As you pulse your lantern, your emitters flash erratically, disorienting your opponents that see it. Each opponent in a 15-foot cone must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a failure, the creature is dazzled for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round and dazzled for the following round.</p>
                  <p>“But wait,” you might be asking. “My explosive surki sorceress, Blastrellina, isn’t just a surki; she’s also a nephilim because she fed upon the lingering unholy magic of the Worldwound! How will these ancestries interact with versatile heritages?” We know that versatile heritages are very popular, and so if you want to take one with either an awakened animal or a surki, you can! In this case, you still select a heritage purely to define your character’s story and cosmetic appearance, and you gain some basic benefits but not their specialized heritage abilities. However, you can take either the Late Awakener or Secondary Adaptation feat later to gain these benefits.</p>

                 <p>It’s been so fun that I’ve started stashing <em>anything</em> I’ve deemed April Fools–worthy, to the point where if someone else deems it worthy of The List, I’m summoned to add it immediately. Around a month ago, I added to the goblins’ ever-full dance cards by releasing The List into the wilds of the Paizo Chat. So with a year’s worth of out-of-context inspiration, the goblins responded to me with this year’s foolish wonders!</p>
                 <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;">Maryssa Mari<br><em>Web Content Manager</em><br></p>
                 <h3>Wordsmith</h3>
                 <p>With every strike of a wordsmith’s hammer, a new onomatopoeia is formed. They swiftly grab the word as it flies off the anvil before nailing it to the pages of our favorite comics. <em>POW! WHAM! SPLAT!</em> The hammer crafts each and every sound. The humble wordsmith is often overlooked by their artisan peers, whose pictures are the primary focus of readers. However, many don’t realize that while pictures can be sent to the printing press, sounds are not captured so easily on the page and must be hammered into place by a skilled wordsmith.</p>
                 <p>While most wordsmiths are content to forge their words out of sight of the public, they are fierce defenders of their work and are quick to fight anyone who belittles it. They know the pen is mightier than the sword, but the hammer is mightiest of all, and they use it mercilessly to <em>SMASH!</em> through their foes.</p>
                 <p>Though many wordsmiths are dwarves, they come from all kinds of backgrounds, each bringing their own unique sounds and noises from their culture. Tengu wordsmiths particularly favor onomatopoeias similar to bird calls like <em>caw</em>for crows or <em>okalee</em> for red-winged blackbirds. Meanwhile, leshy wordsmiths favor sounds inaudible to most non-plant creatures, such as the <em>tr-tr-tr</em> that reflects the sound of a plant growing.</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p>Armiger Khelum,<br>
                    If this letter comes across my desk one more time, I’ll be reporting you to Lictor Stought. I understand the fear one carries when confronted with the possibility of hags, but I can reassure you that the <em>Bloddey Glass Hag</em> is not one to fear because she <em>does not exist</em>.</p>
                  <p>“You are now cursed!! You must copy this letter and send it on or you will be killed!!! In a fortnight at twilight the Bloddey Glass Hag will crawl out from under your mattress! This isn’t a joke! She will stab your chest and pull out your eyeballs with a fork and if you don’t have eyeballs she will pull out your liver and if you don’t have a liver she will pull off your skin and use it to make a newe dress! And then she’ll take your corpse and she’ll stuff it under your bed or she’ll put you in the closet! What will your Maralictor tell your family??? It won’t be funny then! Send this letter to ten other Hellknights to break the curse! Remember, the Bloddey Glass Hag is watching you sleep!!!”</p>
                  <p>This is ridiculous, armiger.</p>
                  <p>I’ve sent copies of this to my fellow Paralictors, the Master of Blades, the Maralictors, and the Paravicar of our Order, just so they also have copies of this... ghost story of yours. I don’t want to see it again.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Signed,<br>
                    Paralictor Shudi Osra<br></p>

                  <p>Kreighton,<br>
                    Never let it be said that I’m not grateful for the random bits and bobs that you’re able to submit to the archive that tell us more about pre–Age of Darkness Kyonin. But this one does seem a little... strange. Perhaps you could provide more context?</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">— Gorm</p>
                  <p>“I was dining with my youngest child at the Viridian Crystal, and we had the most wonderful little cakes. I asked the chef’s familiar if we might have the recipe and the little jay twittered and said that while he couldn’t give away the lady’s recipe, I would be able to purchase it. Of course, being quite sensible I requested the price and was told ‘two pieces.’ This seemed very reasonable, so I accepted, and I was told it would be added to my bill.</p>
                  <p>The next day, I was going through my letters and found my bill from the Crystal, and I was being charged two platinum, 32 silver. Of course, 20 silver for dinner, 12 silver for the lovely crystal tiara I purchased for my child, but apparently the two platinum were for the recipe for the little cakes! Well, I threatened to take this up with the Edasseril family, only to be told that I could put the recipe wherever I wanted, so here I am. I’m sharing this recipe with everyone I know and hoping that they’ll send it to everyone they know, and I hope that Chef Avie Vandlade enjoys her comeuppance!</p>
                  <p>Viridian Crystal Cakes</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>1 and a quarter cups flour, weighed</li>
                   <li>Three-fourths cup and two tablespoons fine white sugar</li>
                   <li>Three-fourths teaspoon baking powder</li>
                   <li>One-fourth teaspoon baking soda</li>
                   <li>One-fourth teaspoon salt</li>
                   <li>Six tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</li>
                   <li>Two tablespoons oil (vegetable)</li>
                   <li>One whole egg and one egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
                   <li>One and one-half teaspoons vanilla</li>
                   <li>One-half teaspoon butter flavor</li>
                   <li>One-half cup soured cream, room temperature</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Activate your fire elemental and put your oven at cake temperature. Well grease a half-foot round pan.</p>
                  <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt gently in a medium bowl. Add softened butter and oil and mix until it looks like delicate sand.</p>
                  <p>In a small bowl, combine egg, yolk, vanilla, butter flavor, and soured cream. In batches of three, add the wet to the dry and beat until smooth. Scrape the bowl for any pockets of dry goods and make sure everything is fully combined. Once all thirds are in, beat for another half-minute until fully incorporated.</p>
                  <p>Pour into round pan, bake for around 40 minutes, or until a skewer comes clean. Cool in the pan for ten minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Cut into small circles or squares. Top with chocolate frosting.”</p>

                    Yes, of course, I realize this letter was slightly obtuse. Cake temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
                    With care,<br>

                 <br>
                 <p>Omen dragons are tied to the occult tradition, granting them strange powers. In the case of omen dragons, those powers are connected to prophecy and fortune-telling. Although proper prophecy no longer works in the world, short-term fortunes like those explored via <em>augury </em>still function. Beyond that, fortunes become less accurate, but might still have nuggets of truth within them. It’s these short- to medium-length fortunes in which an omen dragon dabbles.</p>
                 <p>Every omen dragon is constantly seeing glimpses of possible futures. These dragons’ occult nature compels them to share what they see with the relevant parties, regardless of the people involved or the nature of the future glimpsed. The dragon usually shares this future through their prophetic wings. An omen dragon’s wings have a reflective inner portion that is much like a mirror. The dragon can use their ability to allow another person to glimpse their future, sometimes months into the future, within the wings. Since an omen dragon has no other information beyond what it shares in the glimpse, they leave the task of deciphering the vision and dealing with the future to the people involved.</p>
                 <p>Omen dragons have a number of additional abilities tied to the fate and prophecy. Every omen dragon is unbound by the restrictions of fate, making them immune to fortune and misfortune effects except when the omen dragon chooses to be subject to them. They can also twist the immediate future to force misfortune on foes who attempt to attack the dragon. Even the breath weapon of an omen dragon is tied to fate and future. An omen dragon’s breath grants victims a small taste of an omen dragon’s power, inundating the victim with countless visions of possible futures that can overwhelm.</p>
                 <p>As they’re always seeing these future glimpses, omen dragons often collect items and treasures related to the future. Omen dragon hoards tend to be smaller than that of a typical dragon, but most omen dragons maintain several hoards at once. Most of these hoards hold items of some future importance, such as a weapon that will strike down a great power or a relic that can save an entire village. People who want or need these items can speak with the dragon in an attempt to claim the items, but doing so can be a difficult feat!</p>
                 <p>That’s the omen dragon, and with that we’ve finished our look at all the dragons in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a>! The book has been out for a few days now and I’m sure some of you reading this already had access to your PDFs or received your physical copies and learned about the omen dragon. In a way, you got to see the future before others, making you not unlike an omen dragon! I want to thank everyone who followed these draconic previews and I hope you’ve had a good time reading them. Also, special thanks to Kent Hamilton for his incredible work and being a great collaborator in helping create these dragons. These dragons wouldn’t be what they are without him!</p>
                 <p>As the author for the new dragons, I’ve been excited to talk about them, but I’m more excited to hear how everyone uses them in their games. I look forward to exciting stories in the months and years to come!</p>

                 <p>Also, I was out and about at the Grand Bazaar, like I usually am on my off hours, poking around who knows what and who knows where and I saw a certain <em>watcher-lord</em> shopping with a fancy lady!

                 <p><em>The warning theory is of particular interest to me because it reflects an ongoing scholarly debate about the ability to prevent a true prophecy. As noted in</em> Beyond Aroden <em>(which I believe I have already mentioned in these pages), there are some who believe in the Fate’s Chain theory, which holds that any action taken to prevent a foretelling only hastens its speed and effects. Conversely, others believe that all prophecy presents the opportunity to exert free will. In the words of one notorious scholar, “those who lie down in front of the hooves of prophecy instead of taking the reins of their lives deserve to be trampled to dust, even if only metaphorically.” Fiery words, and ones I am not sure I believe, but given the gravity of this particular set of prophecies, I do like the idea that this might be an opportunity to shift the course of the future. </em></p>

                 <h2>The Death of Desna</h2>
                 <p>The thing about journeys, especially the good ones, was how easy it was to lose track of the past. Hard to move forward while looking behind you. Desna had always believed that. Each new night, each new step, had something new to offer up—a bit of knowledge to excite her, a dark horizon to invite her, a way for love to keep her grounded as she wandered from place to place.</p>
                 <p>But something else was out there. A threat that she’d forgotten from the void between the stars, seeking only to expand its brutal, ceaseless silence. Not an enemy that could be caught or stopped forever, but something she’d held at bay as it consumed star after star, by making them anew as she had done since the beginning. Back then she’d set the stars like jewels, each a perfect piece of art, and now they were a chorus that only she could truly hear, gentle bells that softly chimed and brought new hope to dreamers.</p>
                 <p>Except with so much journeying, she’d let the task slide down her list, forgetting to replace the stars that steadily winked out. She hadn’t heard their quiet ringing slowly growing quieter, as something more than silence brought new fury to its form. And by the time it reached her ear, that music wasn’t quite as rich, and starlight twinkled that much less, and butterflies flapped weakly. Absence had turned to abscess turned to deep vulnerability, and what was of the past became the killer of the present. In one fell swoop of emptiness, no longer held back by her lights, something of the Dark Tapestry she thought she’d left behind took her and Cynosure as one, and with her all the stars that filled the skies above Golarion.</p>
                 <p>Desna was loved by many, and all stepped up to play a part and try to build a new world in the space left by her death. Cayden Cailean raised cups “to Desna and to freedom” (though he stayed still for many months, sometimes with Kurgess by his side, drinking to his memories and running up his tab). Shelyn offered welcome to those who sang in Desna’s name, collecting songs and poems so she would not be forgotten. (And when they sounded out of tune, as if something was missing, she called them Desnal melodies and blessed those who repeated them, ignoring art’s new promise for the haunting elegies). Sarenrae sought her vengeance but had no one to strike out against, and so she turned to healing in its place (by never letting hurt inside, and building walls around her heart she dared Shelyn to climb).</p>
                 <p>No one could prove the daytime light was any different than before, but even on the fairest day, there was something in the air—a stagnant sort of thickness that weighed upon the spine. Scouts moved slowly, and travelers lingered though they knew to hurry (to get themselves to safety long before the starless night). With no means by which to navigate, sailors called off voyages, reduced to tiny odysseys that kept the shore in sight. And while the feeling dissipated, slowly easing day by day, everything about the world felt dormant for a time.</p>
                 <p>Even as the pace picked up, no stars returned to fill the sky. At night, only the moon shone down, and paths forward could change in ways unlucky and impossible; more often did travelers disappear from the shadowed roads ahead. And while some blamed her ancient nemesis, Ghlaunder, who was emboldened by Desna’s demise, or Zon-Kuthon, who reveled in the new depth of the darkness, only Desna would have known that what killed her waited, determining its next advance, growing in the spaces left within a starless night.</p>

                 <p><em>The Dark Tapestry? It has been some time since I thought about that void of space, which has long been reported to be the home of godlike beings far beyond my comprehension. Maybe this is why I am the most intrigued about Desna’s seeming knowledge of the place and its dangers. It is the first I am hearing of a potential connection, though that may simply be because I do not attend the right discussion groups. Whether or not this prophecy turns out to be true (or, again, maybe a warning that my Lady might be able to give to Desna to prevent this outcome), I will add a note about the possible link between Desna and the Dark Tapestry to my collected papers covering her works as a deity. I am not sure when or if I will have the time to publish any of the works I have begun to write, or if there will be room in my papers for all of the data I now have, but I am glad that I have at least begun collecting information. If these prophecies make nothing else completely clear, my own takeaway is this: it is important to understand what you know (and don’t) about the gods.</em></p>

                 <p>A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for 11th- through 14th-level characters.</p>
                 <p>The Azlanti Star Empire is a vast union of diverse species, worlds, and star systems under the tyrannical dominion of humans who left Golarion for the stars long before the Gap. Under the leadership of Star Imperators Iorian and Yridela Ixomander, the Azlanti Star Empire seeks to bring all inhabited worlds under its hegemony, exploiting their knowledge, labor, and resources for the good of the empire. With a navy rivaling that of the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium combined, its ruthless legions of gem-augmented Aeon Guard pose a terrifying threat to the inhabitants of the galaxy. Most systems—including the Pact Worlds—have forbidden their citizens from entering Azlanti space, lest they draw the Imperators' covetous eyes.</p>
                 <p>Yet, a foe as powerful as the Azlanti Star Empire can’t be ignored, and numerous factions have dispatched agents into the Star Empire to operate in secret, acting as the eyes and ears of the Pact Worlds—a first line of defense against invasion.</p>
                 <p>When an undercover Starfinder broadcasts an emergency call for extraction from New Thespera, at the heart of the Azlanti Star Empire, Venture-Captain Naiaj dispatches a team of highly experienced Starfinders to answer the call. Infiltrate the Azlanti Star Empire, retrieve a Starfinder in peril, and escape with your lives—if you can!</p>

                 <p>The Maze of the Open Road has mostly been stabilized, and yet agents are still ending up at the wrong destination. While no one has been hurt, Venture-Captain Sigvard Tornkvist fears that it might be a matter of time until injury or worse results. She tasks the PCs with investigating the cause of these mishaps, and dealing with it, if possible. Little do the PCs know what they’ve gotten themselves into, but there’s a nonzero chance they’ll find themselves in a dance-off before their mission is complete.</p>

                 <p>A Starfinder Bounty designed for 4<sup>th</sup>-level characters.</p>
                 <p>Illegal gas mining operations are nothing new on the enormous Pact Worlds gas giant Liavara, but mining platform pilot Alana Eledin thought she had a foolproof plan to get past the mining syndicates’ and the Confluence Agents’ watchful gaze. She and a crew of desperate fortune seekers would power up a derelict platform they used to work on and take it down into the depths, to the limit of the structure. Of course, no plan is perfect, and reactivating the maneuvering systems on the old rig sent out an alert. Now a Confluence Agent, with Deep Station’s troubles still fresh in mind, has assembled a team of deep pressure specialists and the PCs to, if possible, rescue the derelict and learn what sent it plunging into the clouds. What no one involved has realized is that there’s a greater danger than the immense pressure facing everyone involved.</p>

                 <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 5th- through 8th-level characters.</p>
                 <p>The simple mission is: deliver a letter. However, upon entering the magical hedge maze to do so, the Pathfinders find that two of their sticky-fingered friends have arrived at the same time and intend to hide a powerful elemental artifact within the Maze of the Open Road! This completely realigns the keystones of the maze, leading to planar interruptions and wild disruptions to operations. It's up to the Pathfinders to realign the keystones, calm down an angry genie, and help everyone who's been misplaced along the way! (And just maybe get that letter delivered!)</p>

                 <h2>February’s Top Performers</h2>
                 <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

                 <p itemprop="description">It’s 30 minutes until midnight and the river’s delta is gleaming with bits of gold dust coming off the tips of the fires scattered about. Dragon-tailed lanterns illuminate the paths as multi-generational families recount raucous stories.</p>
                 <p>Overheard, a gravelly voice mixed with sincerity comes from an elderly kobold: “Do you remember that time when...”</p>
                 <p>Cut off, an innocent yet bright voice coming from a toddler yells, “We’ve already gone over this, ông nội! I wasn’t even born yet! You and grandma met <em>ages</em> ago...!”</p>
                 <p>A family of seven bursts out into loud laughter as they filter into the streets, seamlessly mixing in with the noises of carts carrying crafts and garments, silks and spices; from afar, melodies of wood, wind, and percussion firmly grace the air.</p>
                 <p>It’s the second day of the Festival of the Loss: Xa Hoi’s yearly celebration of the lives of the recently deceased, but also the ancestors that have been watching over the collective for centuries.</p>
                 <p>Bordering each side of the river, home cooks, restaurant chefs, and food stall owners squat, cooking fragrant foods on portable stoves and fires. Closer to the water are tables draped with lucky red fabric, used year after year, dishes placed carefully. The food is surrounded by burning incense that wafts up to the heavens:</p>
                 <p>· Pillowy, perfectly cooked rice next to crisped, barbecued game glazed with a translucent, sweet red sauce that reflects all the lanterns and lights.</p>
                 <p>· Bowls of fragrant broth, simmered for a full day prior to pull the flavor from livestock bones and aromatics into the perfect infusion, filled with tender noodles and garnished with fresh herbs.</p>
                 <p>· Beautiful golden pancakes still sizzling on the griddle, loaded with glowing leaves and minced meat, folded into half-moon parcels.</p>
                 <p>· Rice paper rolls stuffed to the brim with fresh vegetables, herbs, noodles, and steamed prawns caught and delivered just the morning prior, served next to a sweet, crunchy peanut sauce.</p>
                 <p>· A three-layered bean and jelly parfait drizzled with a viscous cream, multicolored glutinous rice dumplings in a ginger syrup, and big, round fried pastries covered with seeds, filled with a mixture of locally harvested sweet beans.</p>
                 <p>Yet, no one has approached the tablescape. Though outsiders might be curious why this mile-long spread adorning the riverside isn’t being touched, for the people of Xa Hoi, it’s because it’s tradition. You see, the dead always eat first.</p>
                 <p>Legends have been told of ancestors who moved to the afterlife and existed miserably because they were forgotten. Instead of joining those who've moved on peacefully to look over their family’s health and luck, these now-lost souls are cursed for eternity. Wondering why their families have forgotten them they manifest as bad luck, nightmares, or even come to our mortal plane themselves, seeking attention and respect.</p>
                 <p>This is why the dead always eat first. The meals are put out under the full moon of the Festival of the Loss to invite those who protect Xa Hoi to join in celebration, feast, and remembrance.</p>

                 <br>
                 <p>As the hour and minute hand of clocks join at midnight, there’s one more moment of silence. A single, unified prayer. One big breath inhaled together with hands pressed close to the hearts—families are sending final well-wishes to their loved ones. Then, as if on cue, the chaotic symphony of music and laughter and joyous conversation rises back to fill the streets along the river as families take turns making their plates and enjoying the delicious, jubilant dinner.</p>
                 <p>As some folks go back for seconds, many start making their way toward the center of the city of Ngon Hoa, where the rivers meet. Shining brighter than the lanterns that line the river, a stage next to the water is covered with vibrant tapestries lined with golden trim. Embroidered into the curtains are stitched portraits of dragons and warriors and empresses and flowers, seamlessly flowing into each other like scenes from a play, draping across the fabric.</p>
                 <p>Though performers have been rotating throughout the night, in and out of the larger festival grounds, with lighter crowds watching and cheering them on, now, people start to enter en masse, staking their place on the damp, grassy ground with blankets and stools to see the annual water puppetry show, Múa rối nước. On stage, the orchestra sets up gongs, wooden flutes, drums, chimes, and string instruments rarely seen outside of Xa Hoi. At the stage’s edge, closest to the water, lie ornate hand-carved wooden puppets, ranging from humans to dragons, merfolk, and nagaji, mirroring the crowd that has gathered around.</p>
                 <p>The spotlights bolt up and down, right to left, finally converging to shine over the river, and the water seems to slow down. The Sorcerer Storytellers rise enchantingly from below the surface and begin the show to roaring applause. They recount stories over the water to tell of this year’s troubles and successes, their magic manipulating not only the puppets from the stage, but shaping the water itself with swipes of their hands like a timeless dance that’s both familiar and not from this world. Their silken garments, meticulously crafted by masterful seamstresses, almost seem to enhance their dragon-blooded magic, each embroidered stitch exuding small glimmers of light as they perform. Dramatic scenes reenact wars with swelling, cacophonous music and powerful imagery, these darker moments interwoven with flashes of occasional victorious triumphs while plumes of water fly high to the sky in unison with the music.</p>
                 <p>As the show ends with a magnificent finale, swirls of iridescent water whipping around in a display of elegant magic, the festivities start to wane. At a glance across the river, the ornate and lavish outfits start to dwindle as workers change into their ordinary uniforms. The next day's tasks still must be done. The incense has burned down to the bottom, leaving small piles of gray ash at the base of ceramic bowls. Performers start packing up their instruments and tear down their festival stages. Carts that once held celebratory candies and toys are stowed away for household wares and common fabrics—the tables’ lucky red clothes are folded up and stored for next year’s celebration, too. Farmers head back toward their plots to tend to the crops and livestock. Store owners start opening shops for the last few hours before the sun starts to rise once more in Xa Hoi.</p>
