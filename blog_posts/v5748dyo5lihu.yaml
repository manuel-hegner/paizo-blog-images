  /products/btpy9e8d/\"><em>Barbarian Class Deck</em></a>! These arrived in the warehouse\
  \ last week and will soon be winging their way to lucky <a href=\"/products/btpy9ewj\"\
  >Class Deck subscribers</a>, so we're going to talk about what to expect when they\
  \ land on your doorstep/FLGS-step.</p> \n    <p>In the card game design world, when\
  \ we design a small group of cards that share mechanical concepts and story themes\
  \ but have different sets of abilities, we call that a cycle. Magic: the Gathering\
  \ is <a href=\"http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/bb52\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">famous for them</a>—perhaps you've heard of the Mox jewel cards?\
  \ In this deck we decided to design a couple of cycles. First up, we've got the\
  \ War Paints:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-BlueWarPaint.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-BlueWarPaint_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OrangeWarPaint.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OrangeWarPaint_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-SilverWarPaint.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-SilverWarPaint_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Paint the town while painting your face.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>All the barbarians can use these items, but different players will prioritize\
  \ different paints' powers. Cycles are like a card game buffet—eat what you want,\
  \ but only a certain amount of food's gonna fit in your stomach.</p> \n    <p>We\
  \ also designed a bunch of weapons for the discerning barbarian, based on our popular\
  \ Improvised Dinosaur promo card from <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. Behold the Improvised cycle:</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-ImprovisedRock.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-ImprovisedRock_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-ImprovisedGreatclub.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-ImprovisedGreatclub_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-ImprovisedBoulder.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-ImprovisedBoulder_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Sometimes you don't have your giant greatsword, but a barbarian's\
  \ still gotta rage.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>As you can see, these weapons have\
  \ a higher initial cost that can be offset with a lucky roll. Both Mike and I are\
  \ very fond of the destroys-everything-around-her-when-she-rages style of barbarian.\
  \ For a companion take on hitting people with whatever's to hand, meet Brielle:</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-BrielleToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-BrielleToken_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-BrielleKneecapper.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-BrielleKneecapper_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Service with a smile... and a butter churn handle to the face.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Brielle specializes in improvisational combat, and her Kneecapper\
  \ role enables both the before-you-act cheap shot and the feeling of invincibility\
  \ after a raging victory. Because she's a halfling, she can also sneak away from\
  \ a foe she'd prefer not to encounter.</p> \n    <p>Back when we did the original\
  \ concept brainstorming for the <a href=\"/products/btpy9e8d/\"><em>Barbarian Class\
  \ Deck</em></a>, Mike and I agreed that barbarians do a few things very well: they\
  \ rage, they smash foes with whatever is nearby, and they hate it when things stand\
  \ in their way. Our new version of Amiri <i>really</i> doesn't like it when things\
  \ stand in her way.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-AmiriToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-AmiriToken_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-AmiriUnstoppableForce.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-AmiriUnstoppableForce_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Let us not to the marriage of true barbarians admit impediments.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>This Amiri is looking for trouble, and nothing but trouble.\
  \ If a location's closed, or if she's bored with it, she's out of there. Boons just\
  \ give her incentive to keep going. And when she gets to smash something, she charges\
  \ ahead.</p> \n    <p>Paizo fans know the legend of Ostog the Unslain, Erik Mona's\
  \ intrepid PC. He doesn't wear armor and he's never died. There was zero chance\
  \ Ostog wasn't going to show up in this deck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OstogToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OstogToken_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OstogTheUnslain.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OstogTheUnslain_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>No, his other role isn't \"The Slain.\" That proved unpopular\
  \ in playtesting.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ostog has no time for anything that's\
  \ not a big two-handed weapon, and he doesn't need armor because he's one tough\
  \ cookie. Put him together with the Improvised Boulder, and even dragons cower in\
  \ fear.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week's <a href=\"/products/btpy9e8d/\"><em>Barbarian\
  \ Class Deck</em></a> preview. Next week, Mike delves into the topic of cycles a\
  \ little more deeply. Until next time, Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br>\
