  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Arvin Utner\
  \ knew his next words would save him or doom him. His head started to perspire beneath\
  \ his powdered wig. A rivulet of sweat ran down behind his left ear, leaving a small\
  \ white smear from the wig’s powder. </p> \n      <p>“Well?” the blonde elf demanded,\
  \ her features becoming even sharper as her mouth angled downward into a frown.\
  \ “Was a hood among his belongings, or not?”</p> \n      <p>Arvin looked nervously\
  \ around his office, knowing nothing there would help him. He’d had this office\
  \ less than a year, taking over as notary when his hardworking employer retired\
  \ quite suddenly. The old solicitor had cited the drier climate of Taldor as more\
  \ conducive to his failing health than that of Galt. Arvin wasn’t surprised at anyone\
  \ leaving Galt—he was thinking very, very hard about it himself right now—but he’\
  d been surprised that his employer would leave such a prosperous enterprise behind.\
  \ The senior advocate had ascended to manage the business, her junior advocate had\
  \ taken her position, and so on, with employees inching up through the ranks. Arvin\
  \ had gone from junior scrivener all the way to notary, earning a tidy raise and\
  \ this office. He’d thought it was quite a coup for his career. He heartily regretted\
  \ it now. </p> \n      <p>The rotund man sitting in the plush chair next to the\
  \ elf frowned. “Master Utner, it’s a deceptively simple question. But answering\
  \ on behalf of the deceased could be…unwise.” The man, a pompous aristocrat named\
  \ Entienne Quibnel, leaned over to examine the papers on Arvin’s desk. Arvin resisted\
  \ the temptation to throw himself bodily across his desk to block Lord Quibnel’\
  s view. It wouldn’t have helped. He felt his trail of sweat turn into a small river.\
  \ It was now past sundown, with a light rain falling in the city of Litran. His\
  \ sweat couldn’t be passed off as anything but nerves.</p> \n      <p>The elf, Zintaya\
  \ Calbieste, sighed. “Perhaps we cut this meat from a different angle.”</p> \n \
  \     <p>Arvin found the metaphor gruesome. He was already thinking much too much\
  \ of the <em>final blades</em>, the magical guillotines used across Galt to behead\
  \ criminals and those who threatened Galt’s national security.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ elf kept speaking in a folksy drawl that Arvin guessed was an affectation. Secretary\
  \ Calbieste was the head of Galt’s farming cooperative, a union of ranchers and\
  \ farmers. The political power that came from controlling food was immense, and\
  \ Zintaya talked like the dirt-diggers she represented to earn their trust and to\
  \ bait rivals into underestimating her. Arvin wasn’t falling for it.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>“The dead fellow, he farmed kohlrabi, I recall.” </p> \n      <p>“Yes, some\
  \ of the most delicious kohlrabi in Litran,” Lord Quibnel agreed, nodding his jowly\
  \ head.</p> \n      <p>The elf ignored him. “And the Gray Gardeners—the ones who\
  \ name wrongdoers, arrest them, and execute them—could be anyone, right? They wear\
  \ masks while on duty. But other times, they go about as anyone else, digging out\
  \ traitors and revolutionaries and criminals like they were rabbits in your radish\
  \ patch. Who’s a Gray Gardener? Maybe a beggar, maybe a wainwright, maybe a noble.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“And maybe a notary,” added Lord Quibnel with a chuckle, “though\
  \ certainly not <em>Arvin</em>, here.”</p> \n      <p>Arvin hated being referred\
  \ to in the third person when he was present, but he didn’t hate it enough to protest.\
  \ Certainly, a Gray Gardener could be anyone—such as a plump aristocrat or an elven\
  \ union manager. He was certain that Gray Gardener business had brought one of these\
  \ two visitors into his office this evening.</p> \n      <p>Secretary Calbieste\
  \ continued, “But Gray Gardeners zealously protect their secrets. And when this\
  \ kohlrabi farmer was pulped into grease under the wheels of a runaway grain wagon…\
  ”</p> \n      <p>Both Arvin and Lord Quibnel grimaced at the graphic description,\
  \ but the elf seemed unbothered.</p> \n      <p>“…his property was boxed up and\
  \ shipped here to the city, to a relative who’d died of the pox. So the property\
  \ came to your firm, Master Utner, and you catalogued it. So, I repeat the question:\
  \ <em>Was a hood among his belongings, or not</em>?”</p> \n      <p>“As a point\
  \ of legal clarification,” insisted Lord Quibnel, practically preening, “the deceased\
  \ was a freeholder indebted to me, so his possessions default to me. This means\
  \ his secrets do so, as well. Master Utner, don’t answer her question.”</p> \n \
  \     <p>“As a counterpoint, Lord Quiverjowl Quibble, as he was a member of the\
  \ farming cooperative, his affairs are <em>my</em> business. And outing one of the\
  \ Gray Gardeners is a <em>very</em> serious business.”</p> \n      <p>Arvin closed\
  \ his eyes, thinking hard. His father had been one of the finest and quickest tailors\
  \ in the city, with a keen eye for style. He’d been taken away by the Gray Gardeners\
  \ when Arvin was a boy for “promoting unpatriotic fashion,” whatever that meant,\
  \ and joined those slain beneath a <em>final blade</em>. But his father never had\
  \ to thread such a fine needle as Arvin did now. One of these two visitors was a\
  \ Gray Gardener, Arvin was sure of it. Was it Lord Quibnel, as good as ordering\
  \ Arvin to keep the dead man’s secret? Or was it Secretary Calbieste, wanting to\
  \ find out whether Arvin knew about the gray silk hood jumbled among farm clothes?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Arvin opened his eyes and spoke slowly.</p> \n      <p>“Farmers have\
  \ need for rough daily clothing. Fancy things don’t suit them, except for an occasional\
  \ trip into Litran for a wedding, a mandatory National Day celebration, or a significant\
  \ execution.” He was stating the obvious, he knew, and his visitors both listened\
  \ very carefully. He pictured a very fine thread advancing toward the eye of a very\
  \ small needle.</p> \n      <p>“And while a farmer might have need for a nice cloak\
  \ or fine hat, he wouldn’t need a hood, no. Not at all.” He started sweating again.\
  \ His visitors were becoming impatient. The thread in his mental image shook.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“And if there had been a gray silk hood among this man’s possessions,\
  \ and I’m not confirming or denying that there was, only a notarized probate inventory\
  \ could prove it. And as I’ve not yet concluded the notarization, there might be—\
  officially speaking—no mention in any formal inventory, ever. Regardless of the\
  \ hood’s existence.”</p> \n      <p>The office was silent. There was an instant\
  \ after threading a needle when you made a slight tug, just to see whether you’\
  d hit the eye and the thread held or missed it and the thread came free. Arvin thought\
  \ about that tug.</p> \n      <p>Secretary Calbieste smiled. “A <em>gray silk</em>\
  \ hood, you say?”</p> \n      <p>Lord Quibnel grinned as well. “Not yet notarized\
  \ in the inventory, eh?”</p> \n      <p>The doors to the office flew open. Two large\
  \ figures in rain-soaked capes and wide hats barged into the room. The facemasks\
  \ they wore obscured their features and their gloved hands reached for Arvin.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>In his mind, the thread flew free. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
