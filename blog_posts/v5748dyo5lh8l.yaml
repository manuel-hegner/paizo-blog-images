  \ announce the newest addition to the Pathfinder development team: Linda Zayas-Palmer!\
  \ Linda blew us away with the development, design and editing chops she demonstrated\
  \ on our blind test for the position. She also chose a nosoi psychopomp for her\
  \ avatar, proving we chose well.</p> \n    <p>I'll let her introduce herself in\
  \ her own words:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a\

  \ My name is Linda Zayas-Palmer, and I'm the new assistant developer at Paizo. I'm\
  \ so excited!</p> \n     <p>I've always enjoyed RPGs and reading fantasy novels.\
  \ In 2008, when Mark Seifter asked me if I would be interested in joining his 3.5\
  \ game, I jumped at the chance to join my first campaign. Since then, I've played\
  \ and GMed 3.5, FATE, Mutants and Masterminds, and, of course, primarily Pathfinder.\
  \ After an Adventure Path and a half, the pile of supplemental stories and subsystems\
  \ I'd been building finally grew large enough that I decided to write for people\
  \ other than my gaming group, and started freelancing.</p> \n     <p>In addition\
  \ to my home games, I've been quite active in Pathfinder Society. I was Venture\
  \ Lieutenant of Boston, along with Mark, and I recently earned my 5th GM star. If\
  \ you haven't already checked out your local Lodge, even if you think home games\
  \ are more your style, give it a shot! PFS has a lot to offer.</p> \n     <p>Other\
  \ than tabletop roleplaying games, I enjoy a variety of board and video games, as\
  \ well as linguistics, math, singing, and teaching.</p> \n     <p>Linda Zayas-Palmer<br>\
