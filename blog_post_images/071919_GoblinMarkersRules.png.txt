| summary  = Rules: Goblin markers. One side of each of these role cards uses goblin markers. Each character using goblin markers chooses one type of marker. (Since there are only 7 markers of each type in the game, this means that unless you have a power that allows you to steal markers, you cannot have more than 7 goblin markers on your role.)
