  \ about to hit physical and virtual store shelves, we got in touch with author Howard\
  \ Andrew Jones for a peek inside his technique...</span></p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>In your own words, what's Stalking the Beast about?</b></p> \n  \
  \   <p>Elyana and Drelm lead a team of professional hunters and woodsmen after a\
  \ strange monster that’s haunting remote settlements of the River Kingdoms. Before\
  \ long they realize there may be sinister forces behind the monster’s seemingly\
  \ random attacks, and not everyone within their group may be who they claim...</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Without spoilers, what was your favorite aspect of this novel? What\
  \ was the most fun part to write?</b></p> \n     <p>There are a couple of key action\
  \ scenes that really please me, and I am proud of the various twists and turns.\
  \ I think the moment I grew secure with the book was when I introduced the bounty\
  \ hunter Lisette in chapter three while she was taking down one of her targets.\
  \ I knew then that I was on to something that would work. I was pleased with the\
  \ way the whole book turned out in the end, even though that end took a turn the\
  \ outline hadn’t predicted...</p> \n     <p><b>Who's your favorite character and\
  \ why?</b></p> \n     <p>That’s like asking me to choose a favorite child! That\
  \ said, of the three characters in the book, this time I enjoyed writing the newest\
  \ of them, Lisette, just a little bit more than writing Elyana and Drelm. Perhaps\
  \ that’s because she was new to me, or perhaps it was because of her character arc,\
  \ but her chapters more or less wrote themselves.</p> \n     <p><b>We haven't seen\
  \ Elyana and Drelm since Plague of Shadows—how have the characters changed since\
  \ then, both in-world and in how you approached writing them?</b></p> \n     <p>I\
  \ know Elyana well enough that slipping into her POV is pretty simple for me. She\
  \ hasn't changed much in a long while, having settled into her personality some\
  \ decades ago. Drelm, on the other hand, is more complex, even though he's not as\
  \ sophisticated as his elven friend, because he's still finding his place in the\
  \ world. He's still growing and changing. </p> \n     <p>In the years since we last\
  \ saw them they have come to depend upon one almost without question, so there are\
  \ very few of those “what are you doing” moments between them anymore.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><b>One of the point-of-view characters in this book—Lisette—is a gunslinger.\
  \ What made you decide to include a gunslinger in such a prominent role?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>I’d like to say it was a complex choice borne of careful consideration,\
  \ but the truth is she walked into my subconscious with her personality and gear\
  \ and her backstory. She virtually insisted upon being in the narrative... so there\
  \ she is!</p> \n     <p><b>What drew you to this particular region of Golarion as\
  \ the setting for a novel?</b></p> \n     <p>I wanted a wilder portion of the world,\
  \ but I wanted one that wasn’t too far from where Drelm and Elyana had last adventured.\
  \ The River Kingdoms proved to be exactly what I needed. I loved the idea of a region\
  \ that wasn’t thoroughly explored or detailed so that I could plop a little settlement\
  \ into the midst of it and do what I wanted with the place. And I have to admit\
  \ I was drawn to the evocative setting that its authors had created – I could practically\
  \ smell the trees and the mist off the river.</p> \n     <p><b>What's your favorite\
  \ part of Golarion that you haven't written about yet?</b></p> \n     <p>Sargava.\
  \ I can’t emphasize that enough. I can barely wait to write some stories set down\
  \ south in Sargava. I can’t believe there’s been so little written about it already.\
  \ It’s just rife with possibilities! I think some Pathfinder writers are drawn to\
  \ populous places, but I prefer writing in less detailed areas so that I have a\
  \ lot more freedom to make things up. And after a visit to the Hawaiian islands\
  \ a few years ago I’ve been dying to try my hand at some exciting tropical stories.\
  \ I’ve been wondering if Paizo would sponsor a trip back to the isles for me. You\
  \ know, for research purposes.</p> \n     <p><b>How did you first get into writing?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>I’ve always wanted to tell stories. When I was a little kid I used to\
  \ draw pictures and my mom kindly wrote down what was happening underneath them\
  \ (I couldn’t write yet). She once told me she knew I’d end up being an author because\
  \ the details about the picture were a lot more involved than the pictures themselves...\
  \ but she might just have been kind, because I was a bad artist. (My son’s tremendous\
  \ artistic talent comes from my wife, not me.) </p> \n     <p>Once I started telling\
  \ stories, I never stopped. Come high school I was writing what’s now called fan\
  \ fic set in the original Star Trek universe, but with my own characters. I was\
  \ big into both science fiction and fantasy and I just kept writing, even as the\
  \ rejection letters flowed in. Gradually the ratio between acceptance and rejections\
  \ flipped, and then I landed a book deal for some historical fantasy novels through\
  \ St. Martin’s, which opened the door for writing some Paizo Pathfinder stories.\
  \ I’ve been here ever since.</p> \n     <p><b>Any advice for aspiring writers?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>If you’re serious about writing, keep at it. Be open to criticism yet\
  \ know when to stick to your guns, because not every critique is right. Know what\
  \ every character wants in the scene before you sit down to write it. Writing only\
  \ happens if you make it happen. Taking the time for a single page a day equals\
  \ a novel by year’s end.</p> \n     <p><b>What's an interesting bit of trivia that\
  \ our readers might not know about you?</b></p> \n     <p>I actually own horses,\
  \ which plays into my fiction, and I have a black belt in Shotokan Karate, which\
  \ almost never does, except that I think knowing how to spar informs the writing\
  \ of my combat scenes. </p> \n     <p><b>Last but not least: if you had only 30\
  \ seconds to convince someone to read this particular novel, what would your pitch\
  \ be?</b></p> \n     <p>Elevator Pitch: The 13th Warrior crossed with Aliens! Okay,\
  \ sort of, but with a wily elven ranger and a valiant half-orc warrior as the leads,\
  \ joined by a dangerous gunslinger/bounty hunter. You want driving action, compelling\
  \ characters, life and death choices? Sword-slinging, intrigue, and surprises? Elyana\
  \ and Drelm will lead you there. If you enjoyed the first novel, everything that\
  \ you liked is ratcheted up a couple of notches.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Check\
