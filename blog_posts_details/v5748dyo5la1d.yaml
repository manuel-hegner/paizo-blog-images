  artist: "the Pathfinder RPG are designed to smooth out some of the rough spots of\
    \ 3.5, while adding some spice to some rules elements that have become a bit ordinary.\
    \ One of my favorites is adjusting the turn undead rules to also heal living creatures.\
    \ This allows a cleric to actually cast some of his spells instead of saving them\
    \ for healing. It also allows the party to adventure a bit longer. Combine that\
    \ with reusable powers for both wizards and clerics and you have a longer adventuring\
    \ day, something the game sorely needed. Do you think the Pathfinder RPG will\
    \ eventually replace 3.5 edition? Since the core books for the 3.5 edition of\
    \ the game are about to be out of print, I think that the Pathfinder RPG will\
    \ replace them as the common reference point for those who are still interested\
    \ in playing the rules system. Are there any surprising things in the Pathfinder\
    \ RPG? Yes, quite a number of things actually. The changes to domains and arcane\
    \ schools, the unification of the various combat maneuvers to one simple system,\
    \ and the alterations to turning all seem to have surprised a number of people.\
    \ There are a lot of little surprises lurking in the rules too. We changed Intimidate\
    \ somewhat so that it can demoralize a foe for more than 1 round. It's not a huge\
    \ change, but it makes the skill a much more interesting option than it was. Changing\
    \ Dodge so that it is a flat +1 bonus to your Armor Class is another change that\
    \ works to simplify the game by removing the pesky need to remember who you are\
    \ using Dodge against. I think a lot of these little surprises have not been spotted\
    \ quite yet, and I look forward to discussing them with the playtesters. What\
    \ are your hopes for the Pathfinder RPG? We've got a long way to go before the\
    \ Pathfinder RPG is in its finished form and between now and then I am really\
    \ looking forward to working with the fans and playtesters to make this the game\
    \ that we all want to play. I hope that the finished game meets that goal, and\
    \ I am confident that with more than 5,000 playtesters on board, we will be able\
    \ to solve any problem that stands in our way. Carolyn Mull Paizo Sales & Marketing\
