  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">When it comes to creating characters, I think\
  \ we all have at least one stereotype, habit, or guilty pleasure that we fall back\
  \ on. Perhaps you love playing two-handed melee bruisers, or maybe you can't stop\
  \ designing oracles. I've known my share of folks who would repeatedly build idealized\
  \ versions of themselves as well as those who are hard-pressed to leave the house\
  \ with an Armor Class below 20 at 1st-level.</span></p> \n   <p>Me? I can't stop\
  \ creating characters that masquerade as a member of another class. Whether its\
  \ a druid nearly indistinguishable from a bard, a witch who tries to be a cleric,\
  \ or an inquisitor that claims to be a ninja, something about characters that pretend\
  \ to be something else scratches an essential design itch of mine. A recent messageboard\
  \ post reminded me of one of my favorite classes to emulate: the paladin. The player\
  \ in question had a \"paladin\" of Yaezhing—in truth an oracle of the brutally evil\
  \ deity—which gave me considerable amusement.</p> \n   <p>I've run across several\
  \ such non-paladins. One was a \"paladin\" of Cayden Cailean, complete with a scimitar\
  \ he ignorantly referred to as a rapier, as well as a \"smite sobriety\" class feature.\
  \ While under its effects, the \"paladin\" would undergo a major change in accent\
  \ and personality, after which he remembered nothing. Of course, on his character\
  \ sheet he is a bard with the archaeologist archetype (and \"smite sobriety\" is\
  \ simply archaeologist's luck renamed), who chose spells like remove fear and cure\
  \ light wounds to further his character concept.</p> \n   <p>The other \"paladin\"\
  \ is one I had a hand in creating, for my Razmiri priest is always on the lookout\
  \ for converts. Having convinced another player's samurai that Razmir is a god of\
  \ healing, prosperity, love, and just retribution, she swore the oaths of a paladin\
  \ and claimed Razmir as her patron. Sure, her \"divine grace\" may actually involve\
  \ daily uses of resolve, her \"smite evil\" works on any target due to its being\
  \ the samurai's challenge, and her mount has never imagined a good-aligned plane\
  \ much less been summoned from one. Nonetheless, she's one of the most altruistic\
  \ paladins I've ever come across.</p> \n   <p>I find Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play is a great way to try out this type of character. Do you know any particularly\
  \ weird \"paladins?\" If so, how did that character emulate the class features or\
  \ otherwise accomplish the deception?</p> \n   <p>Happy gaming,</p> \n   <p>John\
