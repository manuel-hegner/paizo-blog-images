  \ Foam Terrain</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 14, 2011</p> \n   <p>At\
  \ PaizoCon this year I did a seminar/workshop introducing all sorts of things about\
  \ making terrain for RPGs and wargaming. In between various demonstrations of hot\
  \ wire foam cutting, casting bricks in dental plaster, mixing epoxy putty, and using\
  \ polymer clay, I rattled off a bunch of websites with more information and/or product\
  \ links. Here's a rundown on the terrain-building information and links for making\
  \ foam terrain, just in case you missed the seminar.</p> \n   <p><b>Building With\
  \ Foam</b></p> \n   <p>Whether you want to make some movable hills, an elaborate\
  \ cave system, or build an elaborate set piece that you'll use over and over again,\
  \ styrene foam (such as Styrofoam) is the go-to material for building. It's light,\
  \ inexpensive, reasonably durable for this purpose, and easily shapeable with a\
  \ hobby knife or hot wire cutter. Although you can use common white styrene (technically,\
  \ \"expanded polystyrene,\" or EPS) for this, its cell-like structure is a little\
  \ crumbly and may not give you the look you want. A better choice is a denser material\
  \ called extruded polystyrene, which is stronger and smooth. You can buy it in hardware\
  \ stores (such as TrueValue, Home Depot, and Lowes) where it's sold in large, rigid\
  \ pink or blue sheets (typically 2 ft. by 8 ft.) for insulating walls, in 1/2-inch,\
  \ 1-inch, and 2-inch thicknesses.</p> \n   <p><b>A Sturdy Base</b></p> \n   <p>Styrene\
  \ is slightly flexible, and the underside can get scratched or gouged if you place\
  \ it on a rough surface, so you should attach it to a harder, less-flexible base.\
  \ Plywood is sturdy but heavy, so many modelers use fiberboard (often called \"\
  medium density fiberboard,\" or MDF), which is stronger than heavy cardboard but\
  \ easier to cut than plywood. It's medium-brown, typically smooth on one side and\
  \ rough like dried pulp on the other side. You can buy this at most hardware stores\
  \ in large sheets (<a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=202089097&amp;R=202089097\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">here</a> is a link to it at Home Depot, though this is 1/2\"\
  \ thick and 1/8\" thick is generally sufficient). In my experience it is easier\
  \ to cut the fiberboard to the size you want for your terrain piece, then cut the\
  \ styrene to match the base, rather than cutting the (softer) styrene and trying\
  \ to cut the base to match that.</p> \n   <p><b>Time For Glue</b></p> \n  </blockquote>\

  \  </table> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>My terrain supplies box has a bottle of <a\
  \ href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_glue\" target=\"_blank\">Gorilla Glue</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"http://aleenestackyglue.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aleen's Tacky Glue</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"http://www.elmers.com/product/detail/E1322\" target=\"_blank\">Elmer's\
  \ white glue</a>, all of which are available in hardware and/or craft stores. Gorilla\
  \ Glue is good at affixing styrene to MDF, though it expands slightly so you need\
  \ to stack books on top of it while it dries, as the foam is light enough that the\
  \ expanding glue could form a gap between the MDF and foam. You can use tacky glue\
  \ or white glue if that's all you have available, but the bond isn't as strong.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Cutting Foam</b></p> \n   <p>Once you've cut the base material and\
  \ glued it to the foam, you need to be able to cut and shape the foam. The stuff\
  \ is easy to cut with an X-Acto knife or a box cutter, though the thickness of the\
  \ foam may make that a slow process. It's much faster and more fun to use a hot\
  \ wire foam cutter, and if you plan to fiddle with foam on a regular basis, you\
  \ should get a foam cutter. The principle of the foam cutter is it uses electricity\
  \ to heat a metal wire, which slices through foam like a poor man's lightsaber.\
  \ There are several types available:</p> \n   <p>The cheap: Often these are powered\
  \ by D batteries (and drain them quickly), but there's at least one with an AC adapter.\
  \ Look for the brand names <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy75hr\">\"FloraCraft\" or \"\
  Wonder Cutter.\"</a> Retailing for under $20, they're of low quality and they don't\
  \ cut very fast, but are an easy way to get started with foam-cutting.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>The mid-range: The <a href=\"http://woodlandscenics.woodlandscenics.com/show/Item/ST1435/page/1\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"> Woodland Scenics Hot Wire Foam Cutter</a> is a little powerhouse\
  \ and sells for under $50 (you can find it cheaper at Amazon.com and other online\
  \ stores). It runs hotter than the cheaper cutters, allowing you to cut faster.\
  \ I also like the wide \"U\" of the rigid bars, allowing you to cut thicker foam.\
  \ You can even punch a hole in the foam, untie the wire from one end of the cutter,\
  \ thread the wire through the hole, and reattach it to the cutter, allowing you\
  \ to make interior cuts (like a pit in the middle of your terrain). The only drawback\
  \ to this cutter is you have to hold the thumb-trigger in the \"on\" position (rather\
  \ than having an on-off switch) when you use it.</p> \n   <p>The expert: The <a\
  \ href=\"http://hotwirefoamfactory.com/home.php?cat=108\" target=\"_blank\">Hot\
  \ Wire Foam Factory</a> has an entire line of crafter and professional oriented\
  \ foam cutters, including U-shaped cutters, cutting wands, flat cutting knives,\
  \ and jigsaw-like cutting tables. I picked up the 4\" hot knife, which lets me carve\
  \ directly into the foam (for example, to create the appearance of bricks or mortared\
  \ stone). These all require one of their power supplies, either a simple AC adapter\
  \ for $11.95 or a more advanced model for $99.95 that lets you change the cutter's\
  \ temperature.</p> \n   <p><b>This Stuff Will Kill You</b></p> \n  </blockquote>\

  \ in an open area, or with a fan blowing the fumes away from you. And remember that\

  \ with this blog are of an incomplete foam terrain piece I used at PaizoCon. It's\
  \ an elevated rise with a bridge over an underground river. The rise pieces are\
  \ pink foam, carved with a foam cutter, and glued together with Gorilla Glue. I\
  \ used a blunt pencil to draw a grid on the pieces (not a precise grid, as this\
  \ looks less artificial), painted them with brown craft paint, painted a second\
  \ layer of craft paint mixed with sand for texture, then drybrushed with a lighter\
  \ brown to make the texture show up better. The \"water\" is currently just blue\
  \ paint, but I'll be covering that with either a clear resin or layers of clear\
  \ glue to make it shiny. The bridge is a picket fence from a craft store, stained\
  \ a darker brown with dilute brown craft paint, and screwed into the top of the\
  \ foam with long screws. Total building time, spread out over several weeknights,\
  \ was about two hours, not including time for the glue to dry.</p> \n   <p style=\"\
