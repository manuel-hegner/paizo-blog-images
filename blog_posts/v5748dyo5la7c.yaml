  \   <p>Here at Paizo, we've been using our new <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wv9\"\
  >GameMastery Critical Hit Deck</a> in office games for a while, and while it's provided\
  \ a number of awesome moments, I thought I'd take a minute to share a few anecdotes\
  \ that stand out above the others in my mind.</p> \n   <p>Early in the process,\
  \ Thursday-night GM and Paizo Publisher, Erik Mona, was running his campaign with\
  \ most of the editorial staff in attendance. Up to this point, the deck had only\
  \ been used by the players, but Erik—notoriously unafraid of killing off characters—\
  decided to let every monster have a go at it as well, to our collective horror.\
  \ My character, a gruff, magic-using dwarf fighter named Gar, tends to be a front-line\
  \ fighter and caught the brunt of Erik's angry dice that night. After two critical\
  \ hits to the face and neck, Gar was drained of 1 point of Charisma and nearly decapitated.\
  \ I think this is the first time since the new edition of the game that I have had\
  \ to redraw a character portrait based on in-game action. </p>\n  </blockquote>\

  \   <p>The deck also saw some action with my weekly Monday-night game, running the\
  \ Savage Tide Adventure Path. During a face-off against some rather angry bullywugs,\
  \ Jufas Greenbottle, the halfling rogue in the group, managed to score a critical\
  \ hit with his rapier. He drew \"overreaction,\" causing the unfortunate monster\
  \ to draw attacks of opportunity from all adjacent foes. The poor frogman was finished\
  \ when Jufas scored a second critical hit, dealing triple damage after drawing \"\
  perfect strike.\" I think that group fell in love with the deck right then and there.\
  \ I, personally, can't wait until they reach a big fight where I get to use the\
  \ deck against them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <br clear=\"right\"><a href=\"/image/product/secondary/CritHitDeck/CritHitCard7_500.jpg\"\

  \ align=\"right\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Card 7, aka Gar's Bane\"></a> \n  <blockquote>\n\
  \   <p>I've been using the deck in my Wednesday-night game as well, with some of\
  \ the folks from Wizards of the Coast. Fortunately for my players, I generally don't\
  \ allow the monsters to draw cards from the deck unless it is a boss-monster fight.\
  \ In one particularly harrowing encounter, my group managed to crit a nasty half-ogre\
  \ barbarian, but after drawing \"spun around,\" the fighter only dealt normal damage,\
  \ with the brute being flat-footed for one round. Suffice to say, some in the group\
  \ were not very pleased with the result. The rogue was off fighting another foe\
  \ and the only character engaging the half-ogre was badly hurt and hoping to drop\
  \ him with that hit. As the round progressed and the players got to think about\
  \ it a bit, the flat-footed status of the barbarian ended up being a great benefit.\
  \ The fighter pulled a potion and drank it without provoking an attack and the rogue\
  \ pulled away to sneak attack the barbarian with his bow, forcing him to flee. After\
  \ that exchange, I realized one of the great things about the deck: it lets you\
  \ play just a little differently and forces you to really think on your feet to\
  \ get the most out of your critical hit.</p> \n   <p>All of which leads us to wonder\
  \ what kind of havoc we're causing in other people's games. If you've had a run-in\
  \ with the deck, post your own \"Tales from the Crit\" on <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/gameMastery/general/talesFromTheCrit\"\
