  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Every once in awhile, I receive\
  \ a neat story from the field that I think others might be interested in. Stories\
  \ that provide insight into how Pathfinder Society is played or how communities\
  \ work together to bond are very interesting readsâ€”whether that be playing a game\
  \ in the middle of the desert or what gamers in Turkey are like.</p> \n    <p>Today,\
  \ I bring you a story sent to me from Paizo's co-recipient of the 2014 Volunteer\
  \ of the Year award, campaign service award recipient, and England Venture-Captain\
  \ Rob Silk. Here is his awesome write up.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20150316-Photo1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20150316-Photo1_120.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>It's tough when you are far from home and you are running\
  \ three games a day at a long games convention. The adventures run over time, and\
  \ the next game slot draws nigh. All your players have rushed to the restaurant\
  \ queue and it's a l-o-n-g queue. The food is expensive, and it doesn't look too\
  \ healthy. A hardworking GM is a hungry bear!</p> \n     <p>You need \"The Wyrd\
  \ Sisters Kitchen.\" Over here in England, our GMs' welfare is often cared for by\
  \ these two superwomen, Chris Brockley-Blatt and Carol Tierney. They set up a cook\
  \ house on site and, for a very modest fee, GMs can subscribe to their between-game\
  \ meals. The food is delicious, and the company is convivial. It's for \"GMs only\"\
  \ so we can support each other with confidential moans and groans or tips and hints\
  \ between the games. There is always time for a group hug, and no one goes away\
  \ hungry. When it's really tough going and you just can't get away from the GM screen,\
  \ they even deliver to your games table!</p> \n     <p>This has been a huge help\
  \ in recruiting GMs because Pathfinder GMs are the only ones who can get this benefit.\
  \ Many other games systems look jealously on while we go off to eat this lovely\
  \ grub. We have a team of very happy healthy GMs thanks to these wonderful Wyrd\
  \ Sisters. The original third \"sister\" was Tonya Woldridge, who was in right from\
  \ the start but went on to Venture Captain in Canada. So you can imagine the calibre\
  \ of these amazing lasses who are also our Venture Lieutenants and GMs, and who\
  \ organise their own Pathfinder conventions and raise money for charity. We love\
  \ 'em.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Thanks for the write up, Rob! And thanks\
  \ to Chris, Carol, and Tonya for your efforts to help make PFS awesome! I always\
  \ enjoy hearing unique stories from the field and hope you do as well. If you have\
  \ an interesting story from the field you think others would be interested in, please\
  \ email it to me along with some photos.</p> \n    <p>Have a great gaming week and\
  \ I look forward to reading other's comments about The Wyrd Sisters Kitchen.</p>\
