  \    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Today's Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Homebrew\
  \ Special blog is by Richard Noble (<a href=\"/people/BrotherTyler\">Brother Tyler</a>),\
  \ about a homebrew of a different kind. Richard wanted to organize his PACG cards,\
  \ so he came up with some dividers and other tidbits to facilitate storage and gameplay.\
  \ They're pretty boss, sez me. —Mike</i></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>As our\
  \ gaming group's facilitator, it falls to me to control the game box, drawing cards\
  \ and returning them to the box during our PACG sessions. It's like being the banker\
  \ in a popular real estate game, but without the benefit of being able to skim money\
  \ from the top.</p> \n      <p>Has something like the following ever happened to\
  \ you?</p> \n      <p><i>With the town guard searching for Pillbug Podiker, Valeros\
  \ offers to stand post at the city gate. Recalling a large chest in which the guardsmen\
  \ kept confiscated contraband, he hopes to find some useful weapon. Finding the\
  \ chest durably locked, he turns to his crowbar...</i></p> \n      <p><b>Simon:</b>\
  \ I rolled a 14, opening the chest. And I got a 1 on the d4 roll, so I get 1 weapon\
  \ from the box.</p> \n      <p><b>Richard</b> (reaches into the box and pulls out\
  \ a weapon, handing the card facedown to Simon): Here you go!</p> \n      <p><i>Valeros\
  \ quickly opens the lid of the chest and guffaws in delight, withdrawing a large\
  \ glaive from within.</i></p> \n      <p><b>Simon:</b> Alright! A Shock Glaive +1!\
  \ Waitaminute, why is there a \"1\" in the top right corner? Isn't this a \"B\"\
  \ scenario?</p> \n      <p><b>Richard</b>: Dangit!</p> \n      <p>Or how about this?</p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>Meanwhile, in one of the village houses that Pillbug Podiker was\
  \ known to have visited before his disappearance, Merisiel is searching for clues.\
  \ Hidden in the corner beneath a pile of blankets she finds a battered chest. \"\
  No problem,\" she says confidently as she pulls a set of slender tools from inside\
  \ her jerkin.</i></p> \n      <p><b>Christina:</b> I recharged the Masterwork Tools\
  \ to automatically defeat the barrier, and I rolled a 1 for the number of items\
  \ I get.</p> \n      <p><b>Richard</b> (reaches into the box and pulls out a card,\
  \ handing it facedown to Christina): Here you go!</p> \n      <p><i>Cautiously,\
  \ Merisiel lifts the lid of the chest to reveal its contents, jumping back in surprise\
  \ when a large beast suddenly forces its way out, growling in fury. As she reaches\
  \ for her knives, she wonders how the chest's owner got the Saber-Toothed Tiger\
  \ into the small chest.</i></p> \n      <p><b>Christina:</b> (Looking archly at\
  \ her husband): I said I get an item, not an ally.</p> \n      <p><b>Richard</b>:\
  \ Great googly moogly!</p> \n      <p>Now I won't say that neither of these types\
  \ of incidents has ever happened to me, and I can't say that they haven't. Besides,\
  \ my wife tells me that it happens to everyone. To keep things like this from happening\
  \ again, and to satisfy my abnormal compulsion for organization, I developed some\
  \ dividers to keep everything neat and tidy. I decided early on that I wanted to\
  \ make the dividers sufficient to support whatever sort of organizational method\
  \ different players might like, with color coding and text of sufficient size and\
  \ font type to be legible at arm's length.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers1_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n       <br>The dividers that started it all\n       <p></p>\n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>Something else to consider was long-term storage. While the stock box\
  \ comes with a plastic vacuum tray that can fit all of the cards, things get a little\
  \ dicey when you sleeve the cards. Personally, I sleeve all of my PACG cards. I\
  \ wanted to make sure that the cards last, even when my wife is eating potato chips\
  \ during a game. I used the PACG organizer available from The Broken Token, removing\
  \ all of the cards for the AP from their boxes. I needed to ensure there were dividers\
  \ for all of the different card types as well as for all of the different deck indicators.\
  \ This makes adding cards (say, a 5th player joins us for a game) or removing them\
  \ (say, when we finish an Adventure Path) a snap.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Token's PACG Organizer (right)\n       <p></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>The basic\
  \ dividers are tall enough so that the labels can be seen over the top of the cards\
  \ when they are unsleeved, but they're short enough to fit in the base set box with\
  \ the rules on top and the lid all the way down. If your cards are sleeved and the\
  \ dividers are cut to the shortest height, much of the label is obscured by the\
  \ sleeve, but the color bar is still visible. Some players might not use the base\
  \ set box, and those that have a storage solution that allows for more height can\
  \ cut the cards to different heights so that they can be seen above the cards even\
  \ when they are sleeved. There are even different cut lines so that some dividers\
  \ can be taller than others—perhaps you want the main WEAPON divider to be visible\
  \ above the other weapon dividers (e.g., WEAPON—B, WEAPON—1, etc.).</p> \n     \

  \ also includes special dividers peculiar to that AP. The Skull &amp; Shackles dividers\
  \ include dividers for the ships and the fleet card; Wrath of the Righteous has\
  \ dividers for cohorts, mythic paths, and the redemption card; and Mummy's Mask\
  \ has dividers for scourges, traders, and the bazaar and defensive stance cards.</p>\

  \      </div> \n      <p>Dividers for the organized play \"Season of…\" cards are\
  \ also included, using the color black. Also, there are \"blank\" dividers that\
  \ allow you to further customize. These use a light gray so you can write your own\
  \ text.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers5.jpg\"\

  \ a taller height\n       <p></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>There are also some optional\
  \ cards to facilitate different types of storage methods. Most of the card types\
  \ have an IN USE divider. There are three options for removing cards from play,\
  \ depending on what floats your boat: When you decide that you're tired of seeing\
  \ the Mace come up during Fortress of the Stone Giants, you might simply put it\
  \ behind the WEAPON—B divider. Or maybe you'd prefer to put it behind the WEAPON—\
  BASIC divider. And when you finally banish that pesky Goblin Pyro during <i>Spires\
  \ of Xin-Shalast</i>, you might decide to put it behind the MONSTER—REMOVED divider.</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers4.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n       <br>It's like the Whopper® of card organization: you can have it\
  \ your way.\n       <p></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>I use the full-size dividers.\
  \ I print them on card stock, laminate them, and cut them to size. Lamination isn't\
  \ absolutely necessary, but they're pretty durable this way, and any snack residue\
  \ wipes away easily.</p> \n      <p>At some point it occurred to me that some people\
  \ might already have dividers and just need labels. Some game supply companies sell\
  \ dividers; and some players might use materials such as plasticard or cardstock\
  \ cut down to size. To support these and other options, I added pages that only\
  \ have the labels. Players can then cut out the ones they want and affix them to\
  \ their dividers using tape or glue.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers2.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n       <br>These labels have been affixed with tape to thick plasticard\
  \ cut to size\n       <p></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Another thing I did was create\
  \ dividers and labels for the class/character/add-on decks. There is a basic set\
  \ of dividers applicable to all class/character/add-on decks (boons), and a set\
  \ of dividers specific to each class/character/add-on deck (cohorts, if included\
  \ in that deck, and each of the characters). Most of the dividers are exactly the\
  \ same as for the APs, with the addition of two different types of dividers for\
  \ the overall deck and small labels for your storage solution. Two of the deck dividers\
  \ have the name of the deck and images of all of the characters in that deck. The\
  \ other two deck dividers simply have the deck name and logo. Any/all of these can\
  \ be used however you want, depending on your storage solution.</p> \n      <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Deckboxes.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Deckboxes_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n       <br>The boxes for my class/character/add-on decks from different\
  \ angles\n       <p></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>I use plain boxes for long-term\
  \ storage. These generally don't have the majority of card dividers in them because\
  \ I don't want to print up that many dividers. I have a special deck holder for\
  \ when I use a class/character/add-on deck in organized play, and this holder has\
  \ the dividers for all of the cards.</p> \n      <p>Cards for characters include\
  \ the logo and/or name of the base set or class/character/add-on deck to which they\
  \ belong. This way you can see at a glance that it's Kyra from the Cleric Class\
  \ Deck romping around in the Worldwound and not Kyra from Wrath of the Righteous.</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-CharacterDividers.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-CharacterDividers_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n       <br>Dividers for all three versions of the iconic cleric, Kyra\n\
  \       <p></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Another part of my divider files is standees.\
  \ When my group first started playing the game, we found that the tokens were sometimes\
  \ difficult to see, pick up, and move, so we often proxied the tokens with dice\
  \ (which didn't work well). Also, those tokens take up space, and we often played\
  \ where space was at a premium. I decided that some sort of substitute was necessary.\
  \ I would have preferred to use miniatures, but some of the characters don't have\
  \ miniatures and I didn't want to have to either look for miniatures that were \"\
  close enough\" or explain to players, some of whom can be quite persnickety, that\
  \ the red-bearded dwarf miniature represents Agna or some such. Most of the characters\
  \ have images that are part of the Community Use Package, making paper standees\
  \ relatively easy. I made the standees in two sizes, though my group uses the smaller\
  \ ones. These can be printed, cut out, and assembled to make triangular standees\
  \ that are easier to see, pick up, and move. I also laminate the standees to avoid\
  \ that annoying snack residue. We found that the standees needed some weighted bases\
  \ to keep them from tipping over, so I found suitably sized art tiles at a local\
  \ craft store and glued each standee to a tile, then cut small squares of drawer\
  \ liner (available by the roll at local DIY stores) and glued them to the bottoms\
  \ to protect the table surface. For those characters that don't have images, I have\
  \ six blank standees, each on a different colored base. The standees can be stored\
  \ easily in tackle box inserts.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \

  \ (left); my standee and dice storage (right)\n       <p></p>\n      </div> \n \
  \     <p>Every time Paizo and Lone Shark bring us a new adventure path or class/character/add-on\
  \ deck, I upload a corresponding set of dividers/standees to BoardGameGeek and provide\
  \ a link to the files <a href=\"/threads/rzs2t86z?Vertical-Card-DividersOrganizers\"\
  >here on paizo.com</a>. It will be interesting to see how next year's new core set\
  \ and Curse of the Crimson Throne AP change things up. I'm always looking for ways\
  \ to improve the dividers/standees. Hopefully, some of you have found these useful\
  \ in some way!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Richard Noble (<a href=\"/people/BrotherTyler\"\
