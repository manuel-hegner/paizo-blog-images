  headline\">Meet the Iconics: Merisiel</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 23,\
  \ 2007</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>The elves have a name for\
  \ elven children unfortunate enough to be born and raised in human society—the Forlorn.\
  \ In a few rare cases, these foundlings or orphaned elves find loving homes with\
  \ humans, although the fact that, over the course of their childhood, one-time playmates\
  \ become their effective guardians and foster parents results in a strangely skewed\
  \ sense of the self. Most Forlorn aren't as fortunate—they live on the streets as\
  \ almost eternal urchins, watching alone as their companions age and move on to\
  \ greater things.</p> \n    <p>Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, only now emerging\
  \ from decades spent as a child of the streets into a young adult ready to make\
  \ her own way in life. A master at stowing away on ships, she's called dozens of\
  \ cities home, leaving one for another when her companions outgrew her or she outlived\
  \ them. Life has been hard for Merisiel, made more so by the fact that she's always\
  \ found it difficult to master skills that come easily to her companions. Never\
  \ the sharpest knife in the drawer, as the saying goes, Merisiel has learned to\
  \ make up for this by carrying at least a dozen of them on her person. When things\
  \ go wrong with her carefully laid plans (as they almost always seem to do), the\
  \ knives come out and what needs to be done gets done. To date, Merisiel hasn't\
  \ met a problem that can't, in one way or another, be solved with daggers.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Merisiel's life experiences have taught her to enjoy things to their fullest\
  \ as they occur—it's impossible to tell when the good times might end. She's open\
  \ and expressive with her thoughts and emotions, and while she's always on the move\
  \ and working on her latest batch of plots for easy money, in the end it comes down\
  \ to being faster than everyone else—either on her feet, or with her beloved blades.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She wouldn't have it any other way.</p> \n    <p>Merisiel, along with\
  \ the rest of the first four iconics, makes her debut as a pregenerated character\
  \ in volume 1 of <a href=\"/pathfinder\"><i>Pathfinder</i></a> and <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7yqz\"\
