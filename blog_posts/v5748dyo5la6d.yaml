  \   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 26, 2007</p> \n   <p>In celebration of the release\
  \ of the free PDF of <i>GameMastery Module D0: Hollow's Last Hope</i>, the start\
  \ of our Module Subscription Service, and the eminent release of <i>D1: Crown of\
  \ the Kobold King</i>, we thought it was high time that we gave you some information\
  \ about the small town featured in both modules: Falcon's Hollow. For more information,\
  \ make sure to check out the appendix in <i>Crown of the Kobold King</i>. </p> \n\
  \   <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Falcon's Hollow makes an excellent base of operations\
  \ for a party of PCs seeking adventure in Darkmoon Vale and the dungeons beneath\
  \ Droskar's Crag. In addition, the schemes of crooked politicians, lumber tycoons,\
  \ and flesh-peddling crime bosses in Falcon's Hollow offer a breadth of opportunities\
  \ for conflict and action. The party may become embroiled in local politics as this\
  \ fledgling settlement grows and factions arise who seek a formal government in\
  \ hopes of throwing off the crushing yoke of the Lumber Consortium. Additionally,\
  \ the party may become involved in religious struggles between various sects devoted\
  \ to all manner of strange deities, some merely against the grain of common theocracy,\
  \ others downright evil and bent on corrupting the souls of the simple folk who\
  \ call the Hollow home. Finally, crime is one of the largest sources of revenue\
  \ in town, and gangs of organized thugs engage in every illicit activity imaginable.\
  \ Good heroes residing in Falcon's Hollow won't go long without rubbing these syndicates\
  \ the wrong way, and the PCs may be swept up in street wars with local criminals\
  \ before they even have the chance to venture into the Vale and seek their fortunes.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Places of Note:</h2> \n    <p><b>Church of Iomedae:</b> With all the\
  \ downtrodden to preach to in Falcon's Hollow, missionaries of Iomedae, Goddess\
  \ of Valor and Justice, have established a foothold in town. Many other religious\
  \ sects who fled to the Hollow to escape the Church of Light's persecution resent\
  \ Iomedae's followers, and tensions run high between congregations, often resulting\
  \ in less-than-holy brawls on the muddy thoroughfares of Worship Way.</p> \n   \
  \ <p><b>Goose'n'Gander:</b> The local general store in Falcon's Hollow is run by\
  \ the only gnome resident, named Brickasnurd Hildrinsocks, who sells everything\
  \ from standard amenities such as grain, lamp oil, ink, and mining supplies to such\
  \ rare oddities as alchemist's fire, antitoxin, a fat petrified pseudo-dragon, and\
  \ stuffed nixies (all the rage this season). </p> \n    <p><b>Hollow Tribunal: </b>This\
  \ is where the diminutive halfling Magistrate Vamros Harg dispenses merchant licenses,\
  \ stamps mining and lumber claims, and passes judgment on criminal and civil cases.\
  \ Most Falconers enjoy the irony of the Hollow Tribunal's name, since the justice\
  \ meted out there is rarely equitable. The fact that Harg is firmly in Gavel Thuldrin's\
  \ pocket is well known, but rarely uttered in public by those who value their lives.\
  \ </p> \n    <p><b>The Sitting Duck: </b>Located a little too close to the town\
  \ palisade for many folks' comfort, the Duck is the local hotspot for adventurers,\
  \ explorers, and other rapscallions looking for adventure. The tavern serves a potent\
  \ local brew of fermented darkwood leaf that can floor an ogre in a few tankards.\
  \ Raucous games of \"knivesies\" and \"mig-a-mug-tug,\" two dangerous local recreational\
  \ activities, both with a high rate of maiming injury, often rage late into the\
  \ night. Many adventurers share tales of Darkmoon Vale and information on Droskar's\
  \ Crag, and other surrounding locations can be gleaned here for the price of a mug\
  \ of ale.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>GameMastery Brand Manager</p>\
