  \ uncertain prophecy and turmoil—the Age of Lost Omens. Now another god has died,\
  \ his death broadcast across the skies in a metaphysical projection of his murder,\
  \ reverberating over any world on which he was worshipped. And from his rent corpse\
  \ falls the Godsrain, a torrent of the god’s blood and divine essence. Those touched\
