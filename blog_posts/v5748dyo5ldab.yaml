  date\">Friday, March 30, 2012</p> \n   <p>Things are moving fast and furious on\
  \ the Pathfinder Battles front, with the \n    <link>Rise of the Runelords set moving\
  \ ever closer to its August release. We're currently designing the packaging for\
  \ the set, and I can say with confidence that we will be posting full product release\
  \ details such as price and product configuration in next week's preview blog.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Before that happens, though, we've got one more standard preview, and\
  \ in honor of the gremlins who have kept some of the details secret and prevented\
  \ us from posting the product pages to date, I've decided to dedicate this week's\
  \ preview blog... TO EVIL!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120329-Azaven.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120329-Azaven_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>First up this week we have the ancient lich\
  \ Azaven, a key villain from the second half of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>. Some of you may remember Azaven as Kazaven,\
  \ his original name. We changed it in the upcoming hardcover collection of the campaign\
  \ to prevent confusion with the dragon Kazavon from <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> and Varisia's Kazaron River. I still remember the\
  \ day five years ago when the Adventure Path staff realized it had used three nearly\
  \ identical names in less than a year, and the new edition of the campaign was the\
  \ perfect chance to make this minor change to clear up any lingering confusion.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Azaven's name may have changed, but he's still as treacherous and imposing\
  \ as ever. This rare miniature has a cool crown and a gnarled staff. With pallid\
  \ skin and a scraggly beard, Azaven represents a lich that hasn't quite rotted away\
  \ to a skeletal state like the one in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a>. I think the two of them make a nice team, and I'm sure your players\
  \ will too!</p> \n   <p>The image shown here is a paint master. The final production\
  \ miniature will have additional painted detail on the hem of his cloak.</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120329-AluDemon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120329-AluDemon_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>A lich not evil enough for you? How about a half-demon filled\
  \ with the pure evil of the Abyss? Did I mention she's quite the looker? This gorgeous\
  \ Alu-Fiend figure is a common, because you \"get\" to fight a bunch of them in\
  \ the Rise of the Runelords campaign. They make great minions for the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8qjp\">Succubus from Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>.</p> \n   <p>This is\
  \ one of those miniatures that you can't believe is a common when you hold it in-hand.\
  \ The detail on the open hand, the face, and the back of the outfit is just breathtaking,\
  \ and I'm not just saying that because this figure is a serious hottie. </p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120329-YethHound.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120329-YethHound_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Last up this week is the Yeth Hound, a traditional canine foe\
  \ with a long history in mythology, fantasy fiction, and fantasy gaming. Yeth Hounds\
  \ are particularly honored allies of the twisted aasimar villain Nualia we showed\
  \ off a few weeks ago, but they also make devastating enemies in their own right.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>They're common, making it easy to build an encounter with a pack of these\
  \ fearsome creatures.</p> \n   <p>So that's it! The last preview before you can\
  \ click through and start ordering these miniatures directly off the product page.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Thanks for being patient with the product details. It's almost impossible\
  \ to believe, but there are still several awesome minis we have yet to reveal. Be\
  \ here next week to be among the first to see the next batch!</p> \n   <p>Until\
  \ then,</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
