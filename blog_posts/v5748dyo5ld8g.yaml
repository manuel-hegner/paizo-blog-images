  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Burnt Offerings</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Friday, March 3, 2012</p> \n   <p>The Paizo office is abuzz with activity\
  \ as the schedule shifts into overdrive in advance of the big summer releases. We're\
  \ shipping the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ld1\">Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide</a>\
  \ today, and final pages of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a> are spooling off the new color printer\
  \ and into the hands of eager editors. Most of you will enjoy the fruits of our\
  \ recent activity later this summer, perhaps at Paizo Con or Gen Con, but in order\
  \ to get all this great stuff to the printer in time for its release, Paizo central\
  \ is buzzing NOW.</p> \n   <p>As I write this sitting on my couch at 2:32 AM, I've\
  \ just finished looking over the color proofs of the first chapter of the Rise of\
  \ the Runelords, “<a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\">Burnt Offerings</a>,” by our own\
  \ James Jacobs. James really set the tone for the Adventure Path (and Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Paths in general) with his devious adventure. When we decided to feature\
  \ the Rise of the Runelords in the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set with our partners at WizKids, one of the things that\
  \ excited me most was the opportunity to bring some of James's brilliant NPCs to\
  \ full-color life in plastic. </p> \n   <p>This week in the Paizo Blog, we'll take\
  \ a look at four NPCs from “Burnt Offerings.” I'd call them all villains, but that\
  \ would mean spoilers, and I wouldn't want to do that to you. Besides, at least\
  \ one of these folks could be convinced to join your party as you venture through\
  \ the town of Sandpoint and the nearby goblin enclave of Thistletop.</p> \n   <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120309-Tsuto.jpg\"\
  >\n   </div> \n   <p>First up we have Tsuto Kaijitsu, a half-elf about town whose\
  \ obsessions help to embroil the player characters in the events of the Adventure\
  \ Path. Tsuto's sister is the already-previewed <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ld4u\"\
  >Ameiko Kaijitsu</a>, and players will have occasion to encounter both of their\
  \ miniatures on the field of battle. Tsuto also makes for a good player character\
  \ miniature. Like all of the miniatures in this week's preview, Tsuto is rare.</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120309-Nualia_360.jpeg\"\
  >\n   </div> \n   <p>Tsuto's obsession is Nualia, an aasimar who is not one of Sandpoint's\
  \ most upstanding citizens, to put it lightly. She's got a demon hand, a belly full\
  \ of scars, and a nice big sword to carve up player characters. It took us a few\
  \ tries to get Nualia's pose correct, but I'm very happy with how it came out. I\
  \ love the way she's beckoning her enemies to approach.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120309-Lyrie.jpg\">\n   </div> \n   <p>Lyrie\
  \ Akenja is another interesting adventurer and Varisian wanderer pulled into the\
  \ schemes of Tsuto and Nualia. This figure gave us a chance to incorporate a familiar\
  \ into a spellcaster miniature. Lyrie's little cat is super cute. This figure works\
  \ great as a player character, too.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120309-Orik.jpg\">\n   </div> \n   <p>Lastly today\
  \ we have Orik Vancaskerkin, a fighter who like Lyrie found himself drawn into the\
  \ affairs of Nualia and her minions. Whether or not he counts as one of those minions\
  \ is really up to the player characters, meaning this figure could easily double\
  \ as a friend or a foe. Like Lyrie, he makes an excellent player character miniature.\
  \ Orik is only one of many Vancaskerkins in the Varisia area. Others appear in other\
  \ Adventure Paths (and at least one more will soon appear as a Pathfinder Battles\
  \ miniature!).</p> \n   <p>That's it for this extremely busy week! I'll be meeting\
  \ in person with the folks from WizKids at the GAMA Trade Show in Las Vegas next\
  \ week, and I hope to reveal specific release details (including cost, case information,\
  \ and more) shortly thereafter. </p> \n   <p>Incidentally, that means we'll be taking\
  \ a break from previews next Friday, as I'll be on the road and scheming wonderful\
  \ schemes.</p> \n   <p>See you in two weeks!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
