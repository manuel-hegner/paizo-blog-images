  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the most popular and\
  \ innovative elements of the original Kingmaker pen-and-paper campaign was the introduction\
  \ of kingdom-building and -management elements to the standard hack-and-slash gameplay\
  \ of the tabletop RPG experience. Starting with the beginning of the second chapter,\
  \ the players find themselves the rulers of a fledgling nation and are tasked with\
  \ resolving conflicts, allocating resources, appointing trusted advisors, and even\
  \ urban planning.</p> \n     <p>Players and Game Masters alike raved about the kingdom\
  \ rules presented in the adventure path so much that we included them as a major\
  \ section of <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i> a few years later. When we\
  \ realized that the system would be ported over to the CRPG format along with the\
  \ rest of the adventure path in <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i>, we were excited to\
  \ see how the folks at Owlcat adapted and expanded on the system.</p> \n     <p>Not\
  \ only can you select what buildings and public works your capital will feature,\
  \ but you'll be able to gather additional resources by uncovering hidden locations\
  \ throughout the land during the course of your adventuring. Sit upon your throne,\
  \ hear the pleas of your subjects, and decide upon their fate. How you resolve conflicts,\
  \ who you select as your advisors, and whether you rule with an iron fist or a benevolent\
  \ smile all influence your kingdom's destiny.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>While you're out adventuring—whether you're more a\
  \ diplomat, monster hunter, or canny explorer—you can leave those companions not\
  \ actively in your party to manage different aspects of the kingdom in your absence.\
  \ Even non-companion NPCs can fill such roles as treasurer or general, so who you\
  \ befriend and who you make enemies of can have farther reaching consequences than\
  \ you might expect. Balance the right skills with the needs of your kingdom, keeping\
  \ the alignments and temperaments of your proxies ever in mind, to ensure the vision\
  \ of your kingdom comes to fruition!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \     <p>Now that the game's been out a week (Cayden's cup, time flies, doesn't\
  \ it?) many players are likely already starting to shape their own kingdoms. I'm\
  \ already starting to see some really exciting results on my favorite Twitch streams,\
  \ message boards, and even some coworkers' computer screens! What's your kingdom's\
  \ story?</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise Manager</i></p> \n    </div>\
