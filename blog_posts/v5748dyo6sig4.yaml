  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Tomorrow, Paizo will release\
  \ our first books using the Open RPG Creative license (ORC), which, like the OGL\
  \ before it, will allow other publishers to use some of Paizo’s copyrighted material\
  \ (specifically, rules expressions) in their own products. There are several extant\
  \ licenses that allow other parties to use Paizo’s IP, including the OGL, Pathfinder/Starfinder\
  \ Compatibility Licenses, and Paizo Community Use Policy. But today, I’d like to\
  \ address some questions we’ve been receiving from creators releasing content under\
  \ the Community Content Agreement for Pathfinder Infinite and Starfinder Infinite,\
  \ on those respective marketplaces. Specifically, I want to answer everyone’s burning\
  \ question, from the newly updated Infinite FAQ: </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <h3>How does Pathfinder Infinite interact with the Open RPG Creative License\
  \ (ORC)?</h3> \n       <p>The Open RPG Creative License and Pathfinder Infinite\
  \ are two distinct and separate things that allow you to use rules and IP owned\
  \ by others.</p> \n       <p>The ORC allows publishers to use material designated\
  \ as Licensed Material in ORC-licensed Paizo publications in their own ORC publications.\
  \ This is restricted to only Licensed Material, which is nearly always copyrighted\
  \ expressions of game mechanics. While Paizo now releases game rules under the ORC,\
  \ the Community Content Agreement for Pathfinder Infinite and Starfinder Infinite\
  \ already grants you the right to use this same content and more. As such, you do\
  \ not need to cite the ORC when using any Paizo-owned material that was otherwise\
  \ released under the ORC.</p> \n       <p>This means that you can already use anything\
  \ Paizo owns under the terms of the Infinite License, including game rules. Thus,\
  \ you don’t need the ORC to be able to publish derivative material on Pathfinder\
  \ Infinite.&nbsp;</p> \n       <p>In fact, as of the publication of this FAQ, you\
  \ are expressly prohibited from releasing any content in your Pathfinder Infinite\
  \ or Starfinder Infinite product as Licensed Material under the ORC.</p> \n    \
  \   <p>This ensures that what you release on Pathfinder Infinite or Starfinder Infinite\
  \ remains within this closed ecosystem, as required by the Infinite license. It\
  \ also ensures that you or another Infinite publisher don’t inadvertently release\
  \ something you or Paizo don’t own, that wasn’t previously ORC-Licensed Material\
  \ (like OGL-based Open Game Content) under the ORC license. Doing so would put you\
  \ in violation of the OGL, which doesn’t allow Open Game Content to be released\
  \ under a secondary license.</p> \n       <p>This also means that you can’t use\
  \ any ORC Licensed Material that didn’t originate in a Paizo publication, as the\
  \ Infinite License doesn’t grant you the rights to that material, and you can’t\
  \ comply with the ORC by passing that open content through to downstream users.</p>\
  \ \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>This is a lot of FAQ text to say, basically,\
  \ that the Infinite license already does what you want the ORC to do when making\
  \ products for Pathfinder Infinite. By ensuring products released on Infinite are\
  \ subject to only a single license (the Community Content Agreement for Pathfinder\
  \ Infinite and Starfinder Infinite), we actually make a cleaner process for everyone,\
  \ because it means that you don’t have one license telling you that you need to\
  \ make all your game rules open for anyone to use anywhere, and another telling\
  \ you that what you release on Pathfinder Infinite needs to stay on Pathfinder Infinite.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For publishers looking to release content based on or supporting the\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Player Core </em>and/or <em>Pathfinder GM Core</em>, this doesn’\
  t really change anything for you. Paizo has already ensured that there’s nothing\
  \ in those books that would require you to use a secondary license like the OGL\
  \ or ORC to reprint or iterate on their content; it’s all 100% created by and owned\
  \ by Paizo, so the Infinite license already lets you do whatever you want with it.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For publishers who had hoped to make ORC conversions of OGL content,\
  \ I’m afraid you’re not going to be able to do so. But technically neither the OGL\
  \ nor the ORC nor the Infinite license allow you to do that anyway! At this time,\
  \ we are not restricting the use of the OGL or inclusion of Open Game Content in\
  \ Infinite releases, because we still have classes and monsters and other game and\
  \ setting elements that creators will need access to in order to make content for\
  \ Pathfinder. You just can’t cross the streams, and you’re required to adhere to\
  \ all the rules of the OGL, as normal.</p> \n      <p>We understand that there are\
  \ going to be a lot of questions about this policy, and because IP law is complicated\
  \ and hard to put into text, I’ll be hosting a Twitch stream next Tuesday, November\
  \ 21, at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST)—with Meredith from DriveThruRPG—\
  to answer any questions we receive in the comments below or via other channels.\
  \ This will be a live stream, but not a live Q&amp;A, so if you have questions,\
  \ please ask beforehand. I’ll do my best to clear things up in comments, but for\
  \ frequent or complex questions, you may have to wait a week.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ the meantime, we’ve updated the FAQ for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite\
  \ with this policy as well as some clarification on older questions, and a few other\
  \ news ones. Check that out <a href=\"https://help.pathfinderinfinite.com/hc/en-us/categories/12777144310039-Community-Content-Creator-Questions\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n      <p>We are excited about Pathfinder Infinite’s future, and\
  \ how the Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster Project is already a vitalizing force\
  \ in the community, and we want to make sure everyone has the tools they need to\
  \ participate and help Pathfinder, Pathfinder Infinite, and their own products reach\
  \ their full potential.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
