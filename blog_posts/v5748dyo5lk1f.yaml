  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Amid our preparations for Gen Con,\
  \ we here at the Paizo offices are strapping ourselves in for the launch of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>\
  \ and all of its related material (in less than a week!), including the first volume\
  \ of the Dead Suns Adventure Path, <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station\"\
  ><em>Incident at Absalom Station</em></a>. You've already seen a preview of the\
  \ adventure, but I'm here to talk about the exciting new aliens and other threats\
  \ that appear in the back of the book!</p> \n    <p>Much like how Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path volumes present new monsters, every volume of the Starfinder Adventure Path\
  \ will come chock full of new creatures in a section we are calling the Alien Archives.\
  \ Many of these aliens will be found within the accompanying adventure, and some\
  \ will present rules for playing them as characters, but all of them will help to\
  \ flesh out the wider Starfinder universe. For the first volume, we presented ourselves\
  \ with a unique challenge: we asked artist Allison Theus to draw two new aliens\
  \ of her own design, and we would then write statistics and words to match! Feast\
  \ your eyes on what she provided to us.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Pretty cool, right? Here's where I came in. Starfinder\
  \ creative lead Robert G. McCreary asked if I wanted to be the one to write up these\
  \ new aliens. Of course, I jumped at the chance to contribute to the first ever\
  \ Starfinder Adventure Path volume. And since I had created adversaries for the\
  \ playtest and the Free RPG Day product <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmr?Starfinder-First-Contact\"\
  ><em>Starfinder First Contact</em></a>, I was already familiar with the system we\
  \ were using to build NPCs.</p> \n    <p>Let me walk you through some of my thought\
  \ processes as I got my first glimpses of the art, starting with the rauzhant—that's\
  \ the purplish-blue flying creature. We didn't yet have plans to introduce any new\
  \ types of dragons into the game, and this beast has some wyvern-like qualities,\
  \ so I started with the dragon creature type. The next thing that drew my attention\
  \ was its face… or lack thereof. I figured it would have some form of blindsight\
  \ (perhaps even being completely blind without it), and it really had to be able\
  \ to do something with all those extra teeth and fangs, as well as those little\
  \ hook-shaped claws. I decided it would have the ability to clutch on to its prey\
  \ after succeeding at a bite attack and then rake with those claws in subsequent\
  \ rounds. In the process, a rauzhant folds up its wings so that it and its victim\
  \ begin plummeting through the atmosphere of Liavara, the gas giant the creature\
  \ calls home. Once its prey is dead, it resumes flight while feasting on the corpse.\
  \ A Large creature, the rauzhant is CR 6.</p> \n    <p>Next, let's look at the vracinea—\
  that sort of plant-spider hybrid. With its wood- and grass-covered exterior making\
  \ for good camouflage in jungle environments (especially those of Castrovel), this\
  \ plant creature seemed like it could be an ambush predator of some kind, using\
  \ its bright-purple blossoms as a lure. I followed this train of thought for a bit,\
  \ making the lure a supernatural effect, turning the creature into a kind of aboveground\
  \ plant-based anglerfish. I decided that, as a plant, the vracinea isn't very fast,\
  \ so I gave it a paralyzing scent that freezes its prey in place, giving the creature\
  \ enough time to approach and begin chomping with its many sharp-toothed maws. Also\
  \ a Large creature, a vracinea is CR 4.</p> \n    <p>Look for more exciting new\
  \ aliens in the upcoming <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath\">Dead Suns Adventure\
  \ Path</a> volumes and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>, all coming soon!</p> \n    <p>Jason Keeley<br>\
