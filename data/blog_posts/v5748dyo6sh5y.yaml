  \  <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Due to the ongoing COVID-19\
  \ pandemic, Paizo has made the decision to cancel PaizoCon 2020. We look forward\
  \ to this celebration with our gaming community every year, and while it’s hard\
  \ to cancel an event like this, we feel this is the best course of action given\
  \ the global situation.</p> \n      <p>The Seattle Airport Doubletree by Hilton\
  \ will cancel all PaizoCon 2020 room reservations en masse. If you have follow up\
  \ questions regarding your hotel reservation, please contact the hotel.</p> \n \
  \     <p>We’re looking into some options for things we might be able to do digitally\
  \ over Memorial Day weekend that would still allow us to connect with our fans.\
  \ With the rapid changes occurring both locally and globally, we have not yet come\
  \ to any conclusions on the feasibility of providing digital content. Once we make\
  \ a determination, we will let you know.</p> \n      <p>There’s also likely to be\
  \ some questions about what this means for 2021. We’re doing our best to adapt to\
  \ these challenging times, and we’ll update folks when we have more details for\
  \ next year’s PaizoCon, May 28th-31st, 2021. For fans who plan to attend next year’\
  s convention and choose to push their 2020 4-day Badge forward to 2021, we’ll have\
  \ an enhanced swag bag at the show to express our appreciation. We know that many\
  \ in our community are facing uncertainties with their future plans and may not\
  \ yet know if they will be able to attend next year’s PaizoCon. <b>There’s no pressure\
  \ to make a decision about what to do with your Badge: all 2020 PaizoCon Badges\
  \ and preview Banquet Tickets that have been issued will automatically work for\
  \ PaizoCon 2021.</b> If you determine that you need to return a Badge or a Banquet\
  \ Ticket, just follow the instructions below for requesting a refund.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>If you would prefer to receive a refund for a purchased PaizoCon 2020 Badge\
  \ or Preview Banquet Ticket, please review the following instructions to process\
  \ your return:</p> \n      <p><b>Refunding PaizoCon 2020 Badges or Preview Banquet\
  \ Tickets if you do not want to push them forward to PaizoCon 2021:</b><br> <em>Please\
  \ note, once we have processed a request for a refund for a Badge or Banquet Ticket,\
