  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The whole ship vibrated,\
  \ and I gripped the edge of my bed, irrationally thinking <em>earthquake</em>, even\
  \ though I hadn’t been on a planet in years. A metal blast sheet slammed down over\
  \ the door of my lavish guest suite.</p> \n     <p><em>Honored human</em>, my liaison\
  \ Ctherk mind-whispered to me. <em>I am told the Azlanti ship has launched an anchoring\
  \ device and foiled our escape</em>. The shirren host, garbed in a red robe exactly\
  \ the same hue as the fanciful ship we traveled in, stood before the viewscreen\
  \ on the wall. <em>They pierced our hull with a metal spike, trailing a tether,\
  \ and bound us together</em>. They gestured with a three-clawed hand and called\
  \ up an image of the attacking ship.</p> \n     <p>I recognized the sacred geometries\
  \ of an Azlanti Star Empire cruiser, one of the beautifully symmetrical ships crafted\
  \ in the Imperial Foundry, hanging against the darkness like an elegant glass ornament.\
  \ Death shouldn’t wear such a lovely form. The ship was probably Spindle-class,\
  \ though I couldn’t be sure. I wished I’d paid more attention to reports on the\
  \ Foundry during council meetings back on Absalom Station, but my work was focused\
  \ on the Veskarium, the slightly <em>less</em> hostile interplanetary empire next\
  \ door, rather than on the Azlanti. I vaguely recalled that Spindle-class ships\
  \ were favored by the Azlanti Empire’s spy agency, so....</p> \n     <p>Oh, no.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“This isn’t a random attack,” I said. “I think they’re here for me.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Ctherk’s mouthparts quivered and a chittering sound I couldn’t interpret\
  \ emerged, one of the first verbalizations they’d made in my presence. <em>Why would\
  \ they want you, honored delegate?</em></p> \n     <p>“I’m on my way to a summit\
  \ in the Veskarium,” I said. “The uneasy peace between the Pact Worlds and the vesk\
  \ has been strained lately, with attacks on the outskirts of various systems seeming\
  \ to violate the truce in both directions. I’m supposed to go and reiterate our\
  \ commitment to peace....” I shook my head. “I heard a theory that the attacks were\
  \ organized by the Azlanti, using stolen vesk and Pact Worlds ships, hoping to destabilize\
  \ relations between us. If they can make us fight each other, we’ll be weaker when\
  \ the Empire decides to strike. If so, the Azlanti want to stop me from repairing\
  \ relations... or to use me for some other scheme.”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>The ship vibrated, and a beautiful cut-glass decanter fell\
  \ from a table and smashed onto the floor. <em>We are attempting to fight back</em>.\
  \ The distaste in Ctherk’s mind-voice was evident. Despite popular belief, I knew\
  \ not all shirrens were pacifists, but the ones on this luxurious diplomatic transport\
  \ certainly were. That was part of why their vessels and crews were in such high\
  \ demand for missions like mine. If you showed up for a summit in a Hivonyx Industries\
  \ Diplomat-class cruiser like this one (its name was something in the shirren language\
  \ which translated roughly to <em>Will They Or Won’t They</em>), crewed by peace-loving\
  \ shirrens, everyone knew you weren’t planning a sneak attack or military treachery.\
  \ That advantage was a weakness now, though. </p> \n     <p>“We actually have weapons\
  \ on this thing?”</p> \n     <p><em>Sufficient to repel pirates and escape</em>,\
  \ Ctherk said. <em>Likely not sufficient to fend off an Azlanti attack vessel that\
  \ has already plunged a barbed stinger deep into our flesh.</em></p> \n     <p>I\
  \ could see tiny specks pouring out of the enemy ship on screen. “Can you magnify\
  \ that?”</p> \n     <p>Ctherk obliged. Those specks were people, wearing jet-packs\
  \ of some kind, bearing rifles. “A boarding party,” I said. “Azlanti marines. Can\
  \ they breach the ship?”</p> \n     <p><em>They have already gouged a hole in the\
  \ hull</em>. The tone in my mind was mournful. <em>One of the upper decks suffered\
  \ catastrophic decompression. Several of my hive-mates were lost.</em> </p> \n \
  \    <p>“Oh, Ctherk, I’m so sorry.” I took a long pause, allowing a moment of solemn\
  \ gravity, thinking bitterly that my diplomatic training had taught me well. “How\
  \ long can we hold them off?”</p> \n     <p><em>They.... Our tactical officer believes\
  \ they are Aeon Guard.</em> </p> \n     <p>The elite shock-troops of the Empire,\
  \ the spearhead of their invasion forces, the enforcers of their imperial goals.\
  \ “Not long, then. What do we do?”</p> \n     <p>Ctherk’s mouthparts quivered. <em>Protocol\
  \ is to shelter here while our officers negotiate with the aggressors.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Ah,” I said. “So, wait here to be captured. I wonder if they’ll imprison\
  \ me, or brainwash me, strap a bomb to me, and send me on to the summit?” My first\
  \ absurd thought was that my career would be ruined; the Prime Executive had put\
  \ me up for this mission personally, and its failure would reflect badly on me.\
  \ My next thought was that I might be responsible for a new war between the Pact\
  \ Worlds and the vesk. I tried to focus back on the first thought, but it was too\
  \ late. </p> \n     <p>The viewscreen shifted to an interior view of a corridor\
  \ on our ship. I didn’t know how far away that corridor was, but the <em>Will They\
  \ Or Won’t They</em> was only about a hundred meters long, so it couldn’t be far.\
  \ A group of four armored and blank-masked Aeon Guards stomped into view, moving\
  \ as one, weapons held at port arms. They looked like they were in a formal parade,\
  \ not a chaotic military action. One of them aimed and fired at something, and the\
  \ screen went black.</p> \n     <p><em>The Azlanti are a curious people</em>, Ctherk\
  \ said. <em>I confess I do not understand them. They are human, with individual\
  \ wills, but they subjugate themselves, body and mind, to their leaders. They even\
  \ choose to erase all signs of individuality with those faceless masks. It’s as\
  \ if... they want to</em> become <em>the Swarm. </em></p> \n     <p>I could only\
  \ nod. The shirrens were an offshoot of that monolithic insectoid race, descendants\
  \ of Swarm members who’d rebelled, choosing individualism and peace over hive-minded\
  \ destruction. They took physical pleasure from making even small choices, and I’\
  d watched Ctherk luxuriate in the decision over which dessert to have at dinner\
  \ the night before. I could understand why the faceless ranks of the lock-stepping\
  \ Azlanti would strike them as particularly horrible. </p> \n     <p><em>Would you\
  \ like to wait here for inevitable capture, or risk death for the chance at freedom?</em>\
  \ Ctherk thought at me.</p> \n     <p>“Freedom,” I said, without hesitation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I felt something like a smile appear in my mind. <em>Spoken like a shirren</em>.\
  \ Ctherk slithered out of their robe, revealing their smaller pair of secondary\
  \ arms, their chitinous exoskeleton, and their complicated, spiky legs.<em> Put\
  \ this on, and pull the hood up.</em></p> \n     <p>I complied, hiding myself in\
  \ meters of cloth. “What are we doing?”</p> \n     <p><em>I have coordinated with\
  \ some of the crew. They will project their thoughts to the Azlanti, as if accidentally\
  \ broadcasting too wide in a panic, and describe a false plan to take you to the\
  \ hold of the ship and put you on board a shuttle. Perhaps they will be fooled.\
  \ Meanwhile, I will escort you to an escape pod. It is equipped with stealth technology,\
  \ and may avoid detection.</em></p> \n     <p>The blast doors rose up as Ctherk\
  \ thumped a panel on the wall, which fell open to reveal a weapon that looked like\
  \ a harpoon crossed with a plasma rife. <em>This is a non-lethal stunning weapon</em>,\
  \ Ctherk said. <em>But it may buy time</em>.</p> \n     <p>“Once we get out of here—\
  ”</p> \n     <p><em>Once you get out of here, honored delegate. The escape pod has\
  \ room only for one. </em></p> \n     <p>“Ctherk, if the Aeon Guards catch you,\
  \ they’ll kill you. Even if I get away—”</p> \n     <p><em>Helping you is my choice</em>,\
  \ Ctherk said. <em>The Azlanti would take all choice away. Please let me keep mine</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I am a steely-eyed negotiator, unmoved by sentiment or emotion—that’\
  s why I was chosen for this trip, because the vesk respect strength and cold clarity.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There were tears in my eyes as I put my hand on Ctherk’s smooth, hard\
  \ shoulder. “The Pact Worlds thank you. Absalom Station thanks you. <em>I</em> thank\
  \ you.”</p> \n     <p>Ctherk opened the door, and I followed them, into freedom\
  \ or death.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
