  >As I write this, the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i> (which I described <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le0n\">in an earlier blog</a>) is getting ready to\
  \ go to the printer. We're incorporating the last bits of feedback from playtesters\
  \ and developers, templating the cards for consistency and flavor, and rearranging\
  \ the rulebook so that it's fun and easy to read. This is the end of the development\
  \ process, the point where a game designer gets ready to bid farewell to his design\
  \ as it walks out the door for a rich new life.</span></p> \n    <p>As you can tell,\
  \ I'm a little sad to see it go. I mean, I know it will do great things. If, as\
  \ they say, it takes a village to raise a child, then this child got one mighty\
  \ fine upbringing. Even if it started as a very different sort of child indeed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Conceived out of mad science in my lab, born of the unholy union of Epic\
  \ Roleplaying Game™ and Cooperative Card Game™, the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i></a> was not destined to go unnoticed. The\
  \ first clue was its larger than average size. At 1,155 cards released over a year,\
  \ it's a colossus. At the point I learned that all of them would fit in the same\
  \ box, I thought, \"Man, that is some box.\" All of <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>\
  \ packs into more than 30 epic adventures. That is a lot of adventures.</p> \n \

  \   <p>But it isn't a hulking brute. This game has moves. It plays with a catlike\
  \ grace, whipping along and keeping you in suspense as you play. If you're the kind\
  \ of person who looks at a polar bear and thinks, \"I'll bet that big thing can't\
  \ catch me,\" you're gonna get caught by this game too. Once you set up a session,\
  \ the game will guide you through a thrilling adventure, ticking down to a moment\
  \ where panic will set in as to whether your party will win or lose. And just like\
  \ that cuddly polar bear, make no mistake: This game might just kill you. It's sure\
  \ gonna try, anyway.</p> \n    <p>Oh yeah, the whole village thing. This game went\
  \ through a stellar development team, both in my group (Chad Brown, Paul Peterson,\
  \ Gaby Weidling, and Tanis O'Connor) and at Paizo (Vic Wertz, Wes Schneider, James\
  \ Jacobs, and Jason Bulmahn). At some point, I convinced the Paizo team to run a\
  \ \"semi-open alpha test,\" where we gave it to more than three hundred Pathfinder\
  \ Society members and said, \"Break this thing.\"</p> \n    <p>Boy, did they. Over\
  \ three months of testing, we received thousands of pieces of feedback. A single\
  \ card might have 30 forum comments about it; put two cards together and a vigorous\
  \ debate about card combos would break out. My favorite thread title: \"Harpy +\
  \ Treacherous Cave raises suck to a new level.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    <br> \n    <p>Everything got sanded down and reshaped. Vic, Chad, and I were\
  \ on the super-secret playtest forum every day, answering questions and updating\
  \ the game at a breakneck pace. The Pathfinder players made our game into their\
  \ game.</p> \n    <p>The game has been through an epic journey over a year's time,\
  \ just like you will make when you play it. And now, it's getting ready to leave\
  \ the nest. I'm going to miss it. But it's coming home for summer, and I'm keeping\
  \ its room open.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Lone Shark Games</i></p> \n \
