  \ “exhibition hall” on the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/ZGTEqnemFx\">Discord\
  \ Event Server</a> over the weekend! They’ll be joining us to show off their amazing\
  \ products, answer questions, and hang out with the community. Some have even planned\
  \ panels of their own via Discord Stages!</p> \n      <p>We’ve given them a chance\

  \ href=\"https://abyssalbrews.com/\">AbyssalBrews</a></h3> \n      <p>AbyssalBrews\
  \ began as a passion project between two best friends to create a collection of\
  \ magic items, creatures, systems, player options, and more. Now, two years in,\
  \ they're finding a new path in Pathfinder 2E as they seek to expand their offerings\
  \ and share their passion with a new audience. All of their creations are fully\
  \ illustrated by Fernando Dominguez and written by Matthew Ross with the simple\
  \ goal of making the magic they want to see in the TTRPG space. While they’re still\
  \ fresh faces in the Pathfinder scene, they hope to find a new community to share\
  \ their work and passion with.</p> \n      <p><b>Discord Events</b></p> \n     \
  \ <p><b>Saturday, May 27th - 8PM EST<br> Making Magic with AbyssalBrews</b><br>\
  \ AbyssalBrews has been creating fully illustrated third-party content for years\
  \ and has recently expanded into Pathfinder 2E. Join illustrator Fernando Dominguez\
  \ and writer Matthew Ross as they talk about their process and make a magic item\
  \ along with them. They'll be taking audience questions while they forge a new Pathfinder\
  \ 2E magic item from your suggestions.</p> \n      <p><b>Sunday, May 28th - 1PM\
  \ EST<br> Rising from the Depths</b><br> AbyssalBrews started as a team of two passionate\
  \ creators attempting to make the content that they wanted to see in TTRPGs. Several\
  \ years later, they're still a team of two, albeit with more ambitious goals and\
  \ more creations under their belt. Join illustrator Fernando Dominguez and writer\
  \ Matthew Ross as they discuss their path to creating in the TTRPG space. Learn\
  \ from their wins, laugh at their follies, and find your own path to turning a hobby\
  \ into a passion project.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3><a href=\"https://alchemyrpg.com/home\"\
  >Alchemy RPG</a></h3> \n      <p>Alchemy is a new kind of virtual tabletop that's\
  \ focused on creating an immersive, cinematic experience everywhere you interact\
  \ with roleplaying games: playing a game, creating a world, discovering new content,\
  \ and streaming live games.</p> \n      <p><b>Playing Games.</b> The Alchemy experience\
  \ creates a window into any story world. It seamlessly weaves together story assets\
  \ and automates common patterns that distract from the game experience today. Players\
  \ connect through integrated voice chat while dynamic music, ambient sound, and\
  \ particle effects enable Game Masters to craft immersive environments for their\
  \ players to tangibly explore.</p> \n      <p><b>Worldbuilding.</b> Licensed game\
  \ content can be purchased from the Marketplace, but Game Masters can also create\
  \ their own universes, then share or sell them with ease on the Alchemy platform.\
  \ Thousands of TTRPG creators monetize their content through third-party seller\
  \ tools today, but the experience is costly, has poor distribution, and makes it\
  \ hard for players to get started quickly.</p> \n      <p><b>Content Discovery.</b>\
  \ The Alchemy Marketplace provides content publishers and creators with a modern\
  \ digital game store that elevates their titles and connects them to new customers.\
  \ Some of the industry’s best content creators have officially licensed titles available,\
  \ including Paizo, Free League, Modiphius, Chaosium, Kobold Press, Hunter’s Entertainment,\
  \ Steamforged Games, Hit Point Press, Magpie Games, and more.</p> \n      <p><b>Streaming.</b>\
  \ With streamer mode, players can make their games observable directly on Alchemy.\
  \ Spectators can join the game experience and chat, emote, participate in polls,\
  \ and leave tips for the Game Master. The Alchemy home screen hosts current live\
  \ games to keep players engaged between game nights and helps teach newcomers the\
  \ game.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3><a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com\">Archives\

  \ Starfinder and Pathfinder 2E. Aside from Blake, who still manages the team and\

  >PF2Easy.com</a></h3> \n      <p>Ivan Blanco Catalán. Born in Barcelona, Spain.\
  \ I work as a chemistry teacher at a high school. I also have a wife and a 7-year-old\
  \ son. My hobbies are playing in the theater, reading a lot of fantasy books, and\
  \ computer science. Ah, yes… I have been playing TTRPGs since I was 13, too.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I regularly bought <em>Dungeon</em> magazine and I remember GMing the\
  \ Shackled City Adventure Path. Iolanda, who played a druid character, had several\
  \ problems choosing which animal to transform into. As computer science is one of\
  \ my big first hobbies, I tried to help my player, and I made my first webtool for\
  \ the old Pathfinder system. She loved it and used it every game day, so eventually\
  \ I shared it with the community for free. I also remember playing around with more\
  \ computer science and sharing the featsweb, a handy tool when you wanted to build\
  \ and follow a feat path.</p> \n      <p>Then the Pathfinder 2E playtest started.\
  \ I decided I wanted to test my computer science abilities and try my best to develop\
  \ a handy webtool for the Pathfinder 2E community, so I made the playtest PF2Easy.com,\
  \ a search webtool for the PF2E playtest. It was a hit, as there were so few webtools\
  \ like that for the playtest on the internet. Pathfinder’s Reddit community was\
  \ boiling at that time, and I remember receiving a lot of support there that led\
  \ me to keep working and make numerous small webtools for the Pathfinder 2E playtest.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Pathfinder 2E began and with all the experience I’d earned, I\
  \ wanted to be part of this new era. I knew that AoN as an official partner was\
  \ going to have the sourcebooks before I would and that they had plenty of good\
  \ people working for the website, but I kept working on what I knew. No ads, updating\
  \ the database, and answering community requests were my line of work. </p> \n \
  \     <p>Nowadays, after I wake up, I spend a while working on uploading data and\
  \ planning new tools before I have breakfast. I have spent some nights on it too,\
  \ and if my family allows me, I spend some time on the weekend answering community\
  \ requests. (Wait, I think that Paizo has just released some new adventures… I have\
  \ to stop writing and start uploading them!)</p> \n      <p>In all, PF2Easy.com\
  \ is a collection of webtools for both masters and players!</p> \n      <p>I have\
  \ met a lot of good people in the Pathfinder 2e community: players, GMs, and various\
  \ other creators who help make this game so wonderful. I feel comfortable in this\
  \ community thanks to the recognition and support of all these people.</p> \n  \
