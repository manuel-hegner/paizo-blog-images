  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last Friday, the <a href=\"http://www.gencon.com/experience/find\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con event listings</a> launched! With all the offerings\
  \ available, searching the catalog can be daunting. So the team put together some\
  \ highlights to aid in planning. From 8:00 AM on Thursday until 2:00 PM on Sunday,\
  \ the Sagamore Ballroom will ring with the sounds of dice, combat, and Venture-Captain\
  \ briefs.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9k94\"\

  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy9gwx/\"><em>#7-09: The Blackros Connection</em></a>\
  \ through <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbc\"><em>#8-03: Captives of Toil</em></a> is\
  \ available, as well as the evergreens <a href=\"/products/btpy92ci\"><em>#5-08:\
  \ The Confirmation</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9a1y\"><em>#6-10: The Wounded\
  \ Wisp</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9hgx\"><em>#7-10: The Consortium Compact</em></a>.\
  \ The multipart \"Faithless and Forgotten\" series will run in consecutive slots,\
  \ so it will be possible to play the three parts (<a href=\"/products/btpy9huv\"\
  ><em>#7-14: Let Bygones Be</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9hux\"><em>#7-16: Lost\
  \ Colony of Taldor</em></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9huz\"><em>#8-18: The Infernal\
  \ Inheritance</em></a>) in order. For each scenario, the Gen Con website shows a\
  \ short descriptive blurb that appears in the program book and a longer blurb available\
  \ online. The longer blurbs for the Season 8 adventures weren't available at the\
  \ time of event submission, so I've included them here to give everyone a taste\
  \ of Season 8 flavor. </p>\n    <div style=\"padding: 10px;\">\n     <b>Pathfinder\

  \ \n      <p>Even in an age where prophecy rarely comes true, many in Varisia hold\

  \ Society's ally Zeeva Foxglove recently received a Harrow reading as repayment\
  \ for her generosity, but a rare card appeared and portended imminent doom. Now\
  \ that these terrible predictions are coming true, Zeeva realizes she cannot weather\
  \ this storm alone. It's up to the PCs to save this friend and philanthropist—perhaps\
  \ by changing fate entirely.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div> \n    <div style=\"padding:\

  >\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed\
  \ for levels 3-7.</p> \n      <p>The legendary sorceress Hao Jin transferred many\
  \ abandoned historical sites to her museum demi plane, though even her magic had\
  \ limits, forcing her to transport only part of an architectural treasure. The half\
  \ of a temple she left behind in the jungles of Dtang Ma has developed a haunted\
  \ reputation in the centuries since. Now an unlikely ally has approached the Society\
  \ with tales of unspoiled historical secrets and hidden treasure left within the\
  \ shattered sanctuary of Yamatsumi, the mountain god.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div>\

  \ Captives of Toil</b> \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <p>A\
  \ Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.</p> \n      <p>Two years\
  \ ago, the Pathfinder Society concluded its extended campaign to find, reclaim,\
  \ and explore the lost sky citadel Jormurdun. After ousting the vile demons and\
  \ duergar within, the Society turned over control to their dwarven allies, who have\
  \ defended the ancient fortress ever since. A recent raid by duergar slavers has\
  \ captured some of Jormurdun's dwarves, who have disappeared into the Darklands\
  \ and bound for the cruel capitol of Hagegraf. Only the Pathfinder Society is equipped\
  \ and able to launch a daring rescue into the lightless depths, intercept the slaver\
  \ convoy, and save these dwarves from a grisly fate.</p> \n      <p>Content in \"\
  Captives of Toil\" also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Liberty's\
  \ Edge faction.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div> \n    <p>After much deliberation and\
  \ because they have the potential to run long, we scheduled the new Seeker Arc,\
  \ \"All for Immortality\" across the morning slots. We are offering Part 1 (<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9k93\"><em>#7-20: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>) on both Thursday\
  \ and Friday, Part 2 (<a href=\"/products/btpy9m01\"><em>#7-26: All the Gods Beyond</em></a>)\
  \ on Friday and Saturday, and Part 3 (<a href=\"/products/btpy9m02\"><em>#7-29:\
  \ Serpents Fall</em></a>) on Saturday and Sunday. This gives players the best chance\
  \ to finish the arc at the event. The GMs for these tables are among the best, familiar\
  \ with running in a convention setting and adjudicating high-level combat. While\
  \ they have the potential to run long, we felt the opportunity to play through the\
  \ arc with friends from other areas provided a benefit that couldn't be passed up.\
  \ So prepare your team and come see if your character is worthy of the title \"\
  seeker\".</p> \n    <h2>Adventure Card Guild Scenarios</h2> \n    <p>Adventure Card\
  \ Game Designer Tanis O'Connor asked me to save them for her to preview. So I will\
  \ leave you with an... tic... pa... tion for tomorrow's blog.</p> \n    <h2>Pregenerated\
  \ Character Specials</h2> \n    <p>The popularity of <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"\
  ><em>#6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu6\"><em>#6-99:\
  \ True Dragons of Absalom</em></a> led us to plan two more scenarios with pregenerated\
  \ characters. Thursday afternoon, we reprise some tables of <em>Serpents Rise</em>\
  \ for those attendees who haven't experienced it yet. Thursday evening sees the\
  \ Sagamore engaged in <a href=\"/products/btpy9lzy\"><em>#7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a>,\
  \ a continuation of the Aspis Consortium storyline. On Saturday, we delve into Season\
  \ 8 with <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"><em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>.\
  \ Sunday morning sees repeats of both pregen specials, as well as For those Gen\
  \ Con attendees unable to make Thursday or Saturday night, Sunday morning sees repeats\
  \ of both new specials. <em>True Dragons of Absalom</em> is on offer several times\
  \ throughout the convention.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Interactive Special</h2> \n    <p>This years special,\
  \ titled <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>#8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a> and\
  \ authored by Matt Duval, starts at 8:00 PM on Friday night. In past years, we ran\
  \ 160 Roleplaying Guild tables, spanning levels 1 through 11. This year, we are\
  \ keeping 160 Roleplaying Guild tables and adding 20 Adventure Card Guild tables.\
  \ All 180 tables will work together to achieve common goals, and the actions of\
  \ one effect the outcomes of others.</p> \n    <div style=\"padding: 10px;\">\n\
  \     <b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-00: The Cosmic Captive</b> \n     <input\
  \ type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\"\
  >\n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <p>Astronomers have marveled as the\
  \ famous comet Aucturn's Tear once more soars through the solar system, yet this\
  \ cycle, strange portals have begun opening on each planet the comet passes, and\
  \ a powerful entity trapped on the other side of these gateways desperately calls\
  \ for help. To the Pathfinder Society, this is a once-in-a-human-lifetime opportunity\
  \ to discover what lies through these portals—and either free the captive trapped\
  \ within or ensure that it remains sealed forever.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Based on feedback concerning the number of tables available to players\
  \ of each level, this year you may purchase tickets for a particular sub-tier. While\
  \ this aids us in allocating GMs to the proper sub-tier, it presents a challenge\
  \ to the player to ensure their character remains at the correct level. Be sure\
  \ you purchase tickets for the level your character will be at the convention!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy (PSA)</h2> \n    <p>Pathfinder Society Academy\
  \ incorporates the Kid's Track adventures of previous years, as well as youth friendly\
  \ tables of <em>The Confirmation</em>, <em>The Wounded Wisp</em> and <em>The Consortium\
  \ Compact</em>. It provides a place for our younger GMs to hone their skills under\
  \ the leadership of adult mentors. This year, we added <em>Kid's Track Transitions</em>,\
  \ a new series of lessons and quests aimed at bridging the gap between the original\
  \ Kid's Track lessons and full Roleplaying Guild play. When completed, the player\
  \ receives a chronicle with enough experience, prestige, and gold to make a second\
  \ level Pathfinder Society character.</p> \n    <h2>Demonstrations</h2> \n    <p>There\
  \ will be quite a few demos going on! In the Exhibition Hall, Adventure Card Game\
  \ demos of the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a>\
  \ will be held next to the Paizo Booth. In the Sagamore Ballroom, scheduled demos\
  \ include <a href=\"/products/btpy9mb9\"><em>Pathfinder Society Quest: Honor's Echo</em></a>\
  \ for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"><em>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Base Set</em></a> for the Adventure Card Game.</p> \n    <h2>Seminars</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>We've planned a full complement of seminars, starting Thursday at 11:00\
  \ AM and continuing through Sunday at 2:00 PM. Some old favorites, like \"Aunt Lisa's\
  \ Story Hour\", Mark Moreland's \"Become a Pathfinder Sage\", and the ever popular\
  \ \"Ask the Paizo GMs\" are back, as well as new offerings. Join Ben Loomes to chat\
  \ about using sound, especially Syrinscape, as mood enhancement at the table. Or\
  \ see what's in store for the Pathfinder Comics line with \"Pathfinder Comics: Hollow\
  \ Mountain and Beyond\". If you're interested in running a convention, visit us\
  \ on Thursday at 6:00 PM to learn some of the tips of the trade. With a wide range\
  \ of offerings, attendees are sure to find something to pique your interest.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>All of these games utilize volunteers as GMs, as well as a full complement\
  \ behind the scenes making things happen. To those that signed up, thank you. It\
  \ wouldn't be possible to hold Gen Con without you! For those still thinking about\
  \ it, I have a handful of Tier 1 GM positions available. For more information, check\
  \ out the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2\">Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers</a>\
  \ blog and follow the registration instructions found there.</p> \n    <p>Last,\
  \ but not least, let me introduce to the Lead Volunteers for 2016! These individuals\
  \ do it all—scheduling, volunteer organization, setup, tear down, and everything\
  \ in between. This year brings back the Terrific Trio of Jon Cary, Bob Jonquet,\
  \ and Todd Morgan. Tune in on Saturday to learn more about our stalwart leaders!</p>\
