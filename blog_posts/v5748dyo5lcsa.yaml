  \    </div> \n    <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Spooky Salutations!</h1> \n  \
  \  <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 28, 2011</p> \n    <p>All-Hallow’s Eve is almost\
  \ upon us, so I’ve decided to shake up the regular preview regime and show off a\
  \ few spooooooooky Pathfinder Battles miniatures from the forthcoming <a href=\"\
  /store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\">Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</a> set, regardless of their distribution rarity within the set.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>First up is the Zombie, one of the most iconic horror creatures of all\
  \ time. We figured that most GMs would appreciate a horde of these undead critters,\
  \ so we’ve placed him in the common rarity—the better to overrun your player characters,\
  \ of course!</p> \n    <p>This guy was a real struggle to get right. The first digital\
  \ sculpts we received had his hands in the air like he was some kind of dancing\
  \ fool, but after a bit of tweaking I think he’s finally in a correct “grasp/lunge”\
  \ sort of stance. The photo doesn’t quite do justice to the details on this figure.\
  \ Parts of his skull and ribcage are peeking through holes in his rotted skin. Yuck!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-ZombieFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-ZombieFront_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a><a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-ZombieBack_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-ZombieBack_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up we have the Werewolf, a fearsome\
  \ foe from myth and legend. This lupine horror lunges straight at your player characters\
  \ with one set of claws up in the air for a killing strike! I especially like the\
  \ way that the Werewolf still has remnants of his human outfit, such as the torn\
  \ bits of his pants around the waist and the single leather bracer on his left hand.\
  \ WizKids has also added a nice drybrushing effect to highlight the contours of\
  \ the rare Werewolf’s fur. And though I don’t have a photo to show this week, gamers\
  \ will be happy to know that the regular Wolf in this set has exactly the same color\
  \ fur, meaning that you could use both miniatures to represent different stages\
  \ of the Werewolf’s lycanthropy.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-WerewolfFront_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-WerewolfFront_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a><a href=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-WerewolfBack_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-WerewolfBack_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Lastly we have a creepy rare critter that you definitely don’\
  t want showing up outside your door whispering “trick or treat.” Keeping the door\
  \ shut won’t keep him out, because he is incorporeal and can walk right though!\
  \ Beware, the Spectre!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-SpectreFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-SpectreFront_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a><a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-SpectreBack_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102811-SpectreBack_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Super-dedicated Pathfinder fans might notice\
  \ that this Spectre miniature is not based on the Spectre illustration in the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i></a>. That’s probably\
  \ OK, I reasoned, since the illustration of that creature in the <i>Bestiary</i>\
  \ wasn’t originally a Spectre either, and its wispy bottom half and dwarf upper\
  \ half didn’t strike the right pose for a miniature, anyway. Knowing that we needed\
  \ a Spectre in our set, we looked through our entire art archive and pulled the\
  \ best-looking “spectral dead” image we could find. Thus was born this nasty critter,\
  \ who can double for just about any type of incorporeal undead in the game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yes, it would be an even cooler miniature if we’d figured out some way\
  \ to incorporate transparent plastic into the figure, but for this first set we\
  \ didn’t have the time to do that kind of trickery.</p> \n    <p>I’m happy to report\
  \ that that isn’t the case for future sets, however, and plenty of creepy and cool\
  \ minis with see-through bits are just over the horizon</p> \n    <p>So there you\
  \ have it. Three of the creepiest minis from <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, soon to be appearing on your gaming table. They won’\
  t make it in time to share Halloween with you, but since they’re scheduled for a\
  \ December release, I suggest making room for them at Christmas dinner.</p> \n \
  \   <p>I hear they’re <i>ravenous</i>.</p> \n    <p><b>Next Week:</b> I reveal photos\
  \ of some of the set’s amazing common creatures!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
