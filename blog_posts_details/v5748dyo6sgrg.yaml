  alt: "Quick. Background. Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb\
    \ required a deep knowledge of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses.\
    \ More often than not, it also required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving\
    \ half-truths capable of swaying a stilled heart. Choose two ability boosts. One\
    \ must be to Charisma or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost. You're\

  alt: "Martial Disciple. Background. You dedicated yourself to intense training and\
    \ rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have\
    \ been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch\
    \ of a prestigious mercenary organization. Choose two ability boosts. One must\
    \ be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained\
    \ in your choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. You gain a skill feat:\
    \ Cat Fall if you chose Acrobatics or Quick Jump if you chose Athletics. You're\
    \ also trained in the Warfare Lore skill."

    \ feet shorter. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter.\
    \ If you're a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary\

  alt: "Powerful Fist. You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage\
    \ die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance\
    \ penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because\
    \ they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this\
    \ penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks."

    \ both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances\
    \ and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally.\

    \ unarmored and touching the ground. You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—\
    a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the\
    \ weight of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed\
    \ attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have\
    \ the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.\r\nWhile in Mountain Stance, you\
    \ gain a +4 status bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against\
    \ being Shoved or Tripped. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your\
    \ AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are\
    \ all reduced by 5 feet."

    \ damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse,\
    \ nonlethal, and unarmed traits.\r\nIf you’re flanking a target while in Wolf\
