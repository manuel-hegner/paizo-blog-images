  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">I hope everyone had a\
  \ great time at PaizoCon Online! It was great to talk to everyone in a little more\
  \ depth about <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, and all the animals and beasts\
  \ that this book about wilderness expedition contains as the <em>Zoetrope</em> airship\
  \ journeys across Golarion in search of mythical beasts.</p> \n      <p>In addition\
  \ to monsters, wilderness-inspired items and feats, and a whole lot more, <em>Howl\
  \ of the Wild</em> comes with six new playable ancestries, each of which is represented\
  \ by a different member of the airship’s crew. You’ll see these characters appear\
  \ throughout the book (alongside our iconic characters), letting you get to know\
  \ them over the course of their journey. The crew's snuck out a little earlier than\
  \ we anticipated—that just goes to show, the wilds can't be tamed—so we thought\
  \ we'd take the chance to introduce you to them. Having a unique cast for the book\
  \ wouldn't have been possible without the superb work of art director Kent Hamilton,\
  \ who designed each crewmate based on the personality and story lovingly written\
  \ by that character's author.</p> \n      <p>Let's meet the crew!</p> \n      <div\

  >Wardens of the Wild</a>—mythical creatures said to steward the great biomes of\
  \ the planet. Baranthet's an iruxi, also known as lizardfolk, who will be getting\
  \ a remaster in <em>Player Core 2</em>. He’s older than your typical adventurer\
  \ and has spent most of his life reading rather than exploring, but he's excited\
  \ to be setting off on a grand adventure, even if it took him a little longer than\
  \ most to leave the library.\n      <p></p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ to a crewmate who's had a hard day. Grefu is an athamaru, an amphibious people\
  \ primarily located in the undersea nation of Xidao in Tian Xia. Athamarus are highly\

  \ most recent of which was triggered by the closing of the Worldwound. Surkis ambiently\
