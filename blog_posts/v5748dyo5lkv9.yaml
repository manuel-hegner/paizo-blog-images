  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">The Origins Game Fair took place this past weekend,\
  \ and we are happy to announce that Starfinder won the Fan Favorite Best Roleplaying\
  \ Game award at the 2018 Origins Awards on Saturday, presented by the Academy of\
  \ Adventure Gaming Arts and Design.</p> \n     <p>We are honored, and humbled, to\
  \ be chosen as the best RPG of the year by our fans. As game designers, winning\
  \ any award is always gratifying, but fan-voted awards are especially meaningful.\
  \ Fans are the people who play our games, and without players, the games themselves\
  \ don't serve much purpose. We want to thank everyone who voted for Starfinder,\
  \ as well as every fan who plays Starfinder, talks about the game with friends,\
  \ and helps make Starfinder's player base a vibrant community.</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ also want to thank everyone involved in the creation of the game. This was very\
  \ much a team effort on a massive scale, and involved some of the most involved\
  \ collaborative work we've ever done. The Starfinder design team, creative directors,\
  \ developers, editors, authors, artists, art directors, and graphic designers all\
  \ did an amazing amount of work to make this game happen. And even beyond that,\
  \ everyone at Paizo took on some of the herculean workload needed to put the physical\
  \ book in the hands of players.</p> \n     <p>Looking forward to the future, we\
  \ plan to continue creating more exciting content for Starfinder in the months and\
  \ years to come, and we can't wait for you to see what we have planned. Keep aiming\
  \ for the stars!</p> \n     <p style=\"clear: both;\">Robert G. McCreary and Owen\
