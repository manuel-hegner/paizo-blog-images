  \ Horror</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 14, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n    <p>Just three short weeks until <a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"\
  ><em>Horror Adventures</em></a> emerges from the shadows! This week, I'm going to\
  \ focus on the material in the book that helps GMs enrich horror games, from rules\
  \ to advice.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">New rules for a more nuanced\
  \ fear track with seven levels, as well as for sanity and madness, allow your group\
  \ to play around with the psychological consequences of the terrible events that\
  \ are all too common in a horror game. The fear track has a split between lesser\
  \ fear (which can cause increasing weakness but doesn't make you lose control of\
  \ your character) and greater fear (where your character is so frightened that they\
  \ can't help but act on it). Sanity is a sort of mental pool of hit points, and\
  \ losing too much at once exposes you to a new madness (of increasing severity if\
  \ your current sanity is below half your maximum). Of course, even if you lose sanity\
  \ a little at a time, losing all your sanity causes you to completely lose your\
  \ grip on reality.</p> \n    <p>The environments section contains 30 different creepy\
  \ locations and hazards, each with their own rules. Locations include pools where\
  \ a creature's reflection shows their true self (though sometimes, after you trust\
  \ them, the pool will show your friend to have been replaced by a horrific creature\
  \ even if she wasn't) and godless voids where divine power can't reach. Hazards\
  \ range from weak threats witch lights that lead you into a trap and grasping undergrowth\
  \ that actively impedes you, to major dangers like an honest-to-Desna bottomless\
  \ pit and the dread apocalypse fog, which animates all corpses within into zombies.\
  \ Environments also includes rules for domains of evil, dark pockets of supernatural\
  \ activity embedded in a plane, plus a few horrific traps and a brief look at nightmare\
  \ dreamscapes.</p> \n    <p>We also have sections for you on curses and horrific\
  \ diseases, providing a variety of new twists on both topics, including curse templates\
  \ like death curse and generational curse, disease templates like incurable, magic-resistant,\
  \ plague, and virulent, tips on creating your own curses. There's even new diseases\
  \ that all follow their own tracks of progression, like Unchained diseases, but\
  \ much more personalized and gruesome; for instance bloody end causes blood to seep\
  \ through your skin as you become prone to fits of rage.</p> \n    <p>The fleshwarping\
  \ rules are the most PC-friendly of the bunch, at least if the PCs are evil enough\
  \ to use them. They allow for three sorts of neat fleshwarps: true fleshwarping,\
  \ where you make a new creature from several old creatures, fleshcrafting, where\
  \ you graft tentacles, antennae, tails, and more onto a creature, and fleshwarp\
  \ mutations, which are usually unintentional results of failed experiments, radiation,\
  \ or other mutagenic experiences.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Kent Hamilton</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The haunts\
  \ section is one of the true gems of the entire book. First of all, it contain delightfully\
  \ twisted haunts from CR 1/4 all the way to the incredibly deadly CR 20 twisted\
  \ wish haunt (pictured here, as Valeros wishes for more ale). It also has new haunt\
  \ elements like elusive and latent. But the coolest part is probably the variant\
  \ haunts, which shows how to use the haunt rules to create experiences other than\
  \ hauntings from dead souls that are dealt with in ways other than positive energy.\
  \ The variant haunt types are dimensional instabilities (places where the veil between\
  \ the Material Plane and another plane is thin), maddening influences (tied to the\
  \ reality-warping influence of eldritch beings and defeated with dangerous Knowledge),\
  \ magical scars (places where dozens of powerful spells were hurled together), and\
  \ psychic haunts (gatherings of emotional energy that can be defeated by calming\
  \ them down with Diplomacy). Each variant also comes with an example haunt.</p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Dave Allsop</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>In terms\
  \ of monsters, we have a template for dread lords who rule evil domains, three hive\
  \ creatures to go with the hive corruption, the Jason-like implacable stalker template\
  \ (Vorhees, not Bulmahn) that can appear behind you and resurrect itself in your\
  \ nightmares, the apostle kyton template for those transfigured by kytons, the trompe\
  \ l'oeil (a creature that emerges from a painting), unknown (a fey that feeds off\
  \ mental energies and erodes others' psyches until they too become unknown), and\
  \ the waxwork creature template for creatures made of wax. There's simple templates\
  \ associated with the theme of each corruption, in case you need to quickly and\
  \ efficiently create a chimera whose dragon head is a construct, a dragon that turns\
  \ into a tyrannosaurus rex every full moon, a vampiric unicorn, or a vegepygmy possessed\
  \ by the spirit of the creature it once was. There's also two variant types of werewolves\
  \ and the familial lich, which uses its own family line as a phylactery.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The \"Running Horror Adventures\" chapter, by master of horror Wes Schneider,\
  \ is another of the books gems, particularly for me, as I've always wanted advice\
  \ on how to make my horror games work out better. The chapter highlights the challenges\
  \ of running horror games in Pathfinder before leading out with a preface about\
  \ out-of-character consent to run horror games. It then explores subgenres of horror\
  \ (body horror, cosmic horror, dark fantasy, ghost story, gothic horror, psychological\
  \ horror, and slasher horror), explaining in each case how to tell those sorts of\
  \ stories (and whether they are particularly easy or hard to tell in Pathfinder)\
  \ and what sorts of threats and plots work best in a Pathfinder game themed around\
  \ that subgenre. Afterwards, there's plenty of storytelling and atmospheric tips,\
  \ tricks, and techniques, both in-character and out-of-character, that can keep\
  \ both players and their characters on their toes. Finally, there's some suggestions\
  \ on how to improvise rules for unusual horrific situations, with examples including\
  \ being buried alive or burned at the stake.</p> \n    <p>With all these new rules\
  \ at the GM's fingertips, I'm actually a little frightened to play in Developer\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer's next game (she wrote the haunt section, so soon you might\
  \ be too!). And of course, the book is a perfect companion for those of you looking\
  \ to check out the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange Aeons\
  \ Adventure Path</a>. Next week, we'll be back with a very special composite preview\
  \ where a bunch of us share our favorite new toys from <a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"\
