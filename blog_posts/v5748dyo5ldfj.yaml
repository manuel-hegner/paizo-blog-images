  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>Hell or High Water</h1> \n    <p>by Ari\
  \ Marmell</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: Over Their Heads</h2> \n    <p>The undead\
  \ crocodile lashed out with its tail now, rather than its mangled jaw, and Ameyanda\
  \ could not entirely avoid the blow. She staggered almost to the edge of the wobbling—\
  and now disintegrating—tussock.</p> \n    <p>For an instant, she seriously considered\
  \ drawing a mambele across her own throat. Considered, and dismissed.</p> \n   \
  \ <p><i>If they keep me alive, that's </i>their<i> mistake.</i></p> \n    <p>Still,\
  \ she'd prefer not to leave herself helpless. Again she cast about, desperate for\
  \ any advantage...</p> \n    <p>And saw it, almost buried in the muck and sticks.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The White Leech who'd struck down Seyusth was moving in on her, again\
  \ with club rather than blade raised. Even through the rain, the sour reek of old\
  \ sweat, rotting teeth, and poorly tanned hides was worse than the undead.</p> \n\
  \    <p>She let the club come, raising crossed mambeles to parry only at the last\
  \ instant, allowing the blow to send her sprawling.</p> \n    <p><i>Oh, Grandmother\
  \ Sun, this is going to hurt!</i></p> \n    <p>Agony, white hot and piercing, as\
  \ her hand came down upon the tiny prize she'd noted a moment earlier. It was crippling,\
  \ nauseating; her whole body spasmed, and she could feel the object shifting inside\
  \ the flesh of her palm.</p> \n    <p>But they wouldn't find it there, and the rain\
  \ should wash away the worst of the blood before the enemy could grow suspicious.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Racked by pain, Ameyanda didn't have to fake helplessness as the White\
  \ Leech swarmed over her, confiscating her weapons and tying her arms with rough\
  \ hemp before dropping her like a sack of tubers into the massive skiff.</p> \n\
  \    <p></p>\n    <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>She didn't\
  \ pass out precisely, but the wash of pain, exacerbated by the rough handling, smothered\
  \ her mind in a thick caul. It was some moments before she once more became aware\
  \ of her surroundings.</p> \n    <p>She shivered, and realized that she lay in water\
  \ two fingers deep—accumulation from the rain. She was lying on the deck of the\
  \ skiff, which was now surging through the swamp with that unnatural speed she'd\
  \ noticed earlier.</p> \n    <p>And now she saw how.</p> \n    <p>Clamped to the\
  \ rear corners of the raft with thick iron spikes, a pair of undead torsos worked\
  \ effortlessly and tirelessly with heavy poles to keep the craft in motion. Someone\
  \ had taken a few sizable bites of excess flesh out of one of the torso's shoulders.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Swallowing bile, she scooted to look around. To her right lay one of\
  \ the men the White Leech had attacked, also bound. Apparently hostilities had resumed\
  \ after the mutual enemy was down. He sported fresh bite wounds, and was already\
  \ shivering with fever.</p> \n    <p>Instinctively, she glanced down at her stomach\
  \ and legs, searching for similar bites.</p> \n    <p>\"You will not find any,\"\
  \ breathed a weak voice from her left. \"The obese one did that to him in battle,\
  \ not after capture.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Seyusth?\" She twisted and flopped to face\
  \ her companion. \"Are you—oh, gods and spirits!\"</p> \n    <p>\"It appears,\"\
  \ the lizardman said, \"that the White Leech has experience countering a shaman's\
  \ magics.\"</p> \n    <p>A pair of small logs had been lashed together with leather\
  \ straps and hemp, forming a rough T.</p> \n    <p>And to that, Seyusth had been\
  \ crucified.</p> \n    <p>A squared metal stake pinned both feet to the heavy branch.\
  \ Each arm was nailed down with a length of iron curved in a rough U, penetrating\
  \ palms and wrists both. Ugly, primitive sigils, etched in corrosion and flaking\
  \ rust, wound in uneven spirals around the spikes.</p> \n    <p>No spellcasting,\
  \ not without his hands. And no shape-changing, presumably, not pinned as he was.\
  \ Amayanda needed no eldritch knowledge to sense the magics, cold and sickly, emanating\
  \ from that profane iron.</p> \n    <p>She couldn't help him. All she could offer\
  \ was the courtesy of not asking something stupid like, \"Are you all right?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Instead, she asked, \"What do we know?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ogrekin.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ogrekin_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \   <br> \"Galgur the Gullet always has room for one more prisoner.\"\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Seyusth took a few deep breaths before answering. \"Their leader is the\
  \ big one. The men call him ‘Galgur the Gullet.' From what little I overheard, while\
  \ he may answer to the White Leech chieftain...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Montirro the Thrice-Blind,\"\
  \ Ameyanda reminded him.</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. He may answer to this Montirro, but\
  \ not often. His band controls this region of White Leech domain with relative autonomy.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Good. I thought we were in trouble there, for a moment.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The lizardman couldn't muster a laugh, but his snout pulled back from his\
  \ teeth in what Ameyanda assumed was a polite grin.</p> \n    <p>\"Issisk?\" she\
  \ asked after a moment's pause.</p> \n    <p>\"Not here. I never saw the unliving\
  \ one close, but he appeared the wrong build to be Issisk.\"</p> \n    <p>Ameyanda\
  \ nodded, shifted without thinking, then gasped at the renewed pain.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I am sorry,\" Seyusth told her.</p> \n    <p>\"It's not as though I could expect\
  \ you to rush to help me,\" she said, struggling for a light tone.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No. It is my fault you are here. My fault either of us <i>had</i> to be here.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"How is that, precisely?\" This was starting to sound disturbingly\
  \ like a deathbed confession—did lizardfolk <i>do</i> that?—but Ameyanda hardly\
  \ cared what he was saying. As long as he kept speaking, he was conscious; as long\
  \ as he was conscious, he wasn't dead.</p> \n    <p>\"Years ago, emissaries of the\
  \ Terwa Lords approached us. They wanted Haa-Ok to serve them, as a—a stepping stone—\
  in Mwangi. I opposed this, as did many others. To join with the Terwa would be to\
  \ betray our traditions, our heritage; to become something the world never intended\
  \ of us. But I was merely an apprentice shaman, and my protests carried little weight.\
  \ My mentor, Errash, supported the alliance. Further, he claimed the spirits of\
  \ the Expanse supported it as well.\"</p> \n    <p>Seyusth's words were coming slower,\
  \ now, between heaving, labored breaths. \"After several moons of debate and consideration,\
  \ Haa-Ok sent some of our own to announce our assent to the Terwa Lords. The band\
  \ was led by Hasseth, our greatest warrior, as a sign of respect. I was to go with\
  \ them as well, to offer what magical protections I could along the way.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I proved insufficient. Perhaps we took too long for the Terwa's liking?\
  \ Perhaps they had some other plot. We never knew. We were attacked along the way;\
  \ only I survived, due to my magics, and then only barely. But worse, when I finally\
  \ made my way home, I found that Errash had been slain in his sleep! No agent of\
  \ the Terwa should have proved able to infiltrate our home, murder our shaman, and\
  \ depart undetected!</p> \n    <p>\"It could only mean that the spirits had removed\
  \ their protections from him. They could not, after all, favor such a hideous alliance.\
  \ Some good came from the catastrophe, then, for while a few of my people still\
  \ argue, even to this day, to join the Terwa, most are wise enough to heed the spirits'\
  \ signs.\"</p> \n    <p>Seyusth lapsed into a fit of coughing, which in turn tugged\
  \ at the spikes and set his wounds bleeding anew. Several of the men up front glanced\
  \ their way, attracted by the sudden spasm. A few laughed; one flicked his tongue\
  \ in and out, like a reptile.</p> \n    <p>\"How does that make what happened to\
  \ Issisk your fault?\" she insisted. <i>Keep talking. Stay awake...</i></p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I... After becoming shaman to Haa-Ok, I spoke long about the evils of the\
  \ Terwa Lords and those who follow them. And many of our youth took those lessons\
  \ deeply to heart. We sent hunting bands far from our territories, in part, to patrol\
  \ against Terwa incursion from the Sodden Lands. And Issisk's band... I found them\
  \ well beyond their accustomed terrain. I fear they went <i>looking</i> for the\
  \ enemy, and it was this that brought them to the White Leech.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And we're <i>so</i> delighted it did!\"</p> \n    <p>The voice was soft—not with\
  \ kindness, but like a smothering pillow—and high as a young girl's. Ameyanda looked\
  \ up at the obese bulk that now kept much of the rain from her skin; she could not\
  \ even imagine how a body that fleshy could approach so quietly. Or without rocking\
  \ the entire skiff.</p> \n    <p>He squatted so that the jiggling of his thighs\
  \ threatened to slap against their feet. Ameyanda could smell not merely sweat,\
  \ but mildew and the seepage of open sores.</p> \n    <p>She could see, too, the\
  \ cause of his misshapen jaw. His teeth had been removed and replaced, via foreign\
  \ magics or surgeries, with twin ridges of serrated bone.</p> \n    <p>As much to\
  \ keep from gagging as anything else, Ameyanda spoke. \"‘Delighted'? Why?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Galgur ignored the question. \"Did we hear,\" he asked Seyusth, \"that\
  \ you dislike the Terwa lizards? Oh, that's <i>really</i> too bad, since we'll be\
  \ trading you to them. Not for a while, though. We've a friend who would <i>dearly</i>\
  \ love to speak with you first!\"</p> \n    <p>The shaman hissed, deep in his throat.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"And you two...\" He turned to Ameyanda and the other captive. \"We'll\
  \ put you in the swamp for a time. You'll be so much more succulent after you've\
  \ softened and ripened!\"</p> \n    <p>It wasn't the laughter and cheers of the\
  \ White Leech that sent a shiver through Ameyanda's spine, but the string of anticipatory\
  \ drool that dangled from Galgur the Gullet's maw.</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n\
  \     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>The village had been built in part\
  \ on a gentle hillside. It had probably been beautiful, pastoral gardens and fields\
  \ of crops. But that was before the coming of the eternal storm.</p> \n    <p>Now\
  \ most of it was permanently submerged, the wooden buildings rotted to skeletons\
  \ of what they'd been. A few, however, stood tall enough, and high enough on the\
  \ hill, that a story or two protruded from the swamp. These, too, harbored the restless\
  \ stench of decay and rough smears of various molds. Still, with the use of uncountable\
  \ patches and slapdash repairs, they remained good enough for some.</p> \n    <p>Galgur's\
  \ faction of the White Leech called them home.</p> \n    <p>They'd approached the\
  \ hillside through a veritable thicket of peculiar reeds. Protruding stiffly, reaching\
  \ almost a man's height above the waters, they didn't appear remotely natural to\
  \ their surroundings.</p> \n    <p>And now Ameyanda knew why.</p> \n    <p>\"<i>We'll\
  \ put you in the swamp for a time. You'll be so much more succulent after you've\
  \ softened and ripened!</i>\"</p> \n    <p>Despite her best efforts, or the shame\
  \ it brought, she'd finally panicked. First the bag, yanked over her head and sealed\
  \ around the neck with some viscous sludge. It smelled of light tanning and animal\
  \ fat, and it had one of those long reeds—long, <i>hollow</i> reeds—protruding from\
  \ one side.</p> \n    <p>And then she'd felt herself manhandled, strapped by leather\
  \ cords to a heavy log, and tossed in to lie amidst the others.</p> \n    <p>They\
  \ didn't even mean to kill her first. Let her lie, submerged in the marsh, half-buried\
  \ in muck, until her waterlogged skin came loose on her flesh. Only then, she knew,\
  \ would they haul her up—a primitive rope-and-pulley system dangled from an overhanging\
  \ cypress branch—to feast.</p> \n    <p>So yes, as the world went away save for\
  \ the sound of the torpid waters beyond the bag and the patter of rain on the surface,\
  \ gradually slowing as the squall finally passed, she'd thrashed, bucked, screamed\
  \ in panic.</p> \n    <p>But only for a moment.</p> \n    <p><i>No large animals</i>,\
  \ was her first rational thought. Galgur and his men wouldn't want anything to rob\
  \ them of a meal, so they must have some means of keeping the bigger predators away\
  \ from their \"crop.\" Nets in the water, perhaps. It meant there was nothing—well,\
  \ nothing large enough to kill her outright—to be attracted by the blood.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And there would be a lot of blood.</p> \n    <p>Ameyanda pulled her left\
  \ wrist toward her shoulder, as far as the straps would allow—and then kept pulling.\
  \ For minutes beyond count, she pressed the ball of her hand against the leather,\
  \ against the soft wood of the log. The pain was enough to draw another scream.\
  \ So be it; let them think she howled in terror, if they could hear at all through\
  \ the breathing reed.</p> \n    <p>She pushed; she twisted. And slowly, agonizingly,\
  \ the jagged crocodile tooth—one she'd knocked from the unliving creature's mouth,\
  \ the thing she'd deliberately fallen upon and concealed within her own meat—slid\
  \ from her skin.</p> \n    <p>She'd expected that she might need to free herself\
  \ of bonds; she'd never begun to imagine the <i>circumstances</i> in which that\
  \ need would arise.</p> \n    <p>Her fingers seized up, twitching, and she almost\
  \ dropped it. The breath caught in her throat as she bobbled at it, and she almost\
  \ cried in relief when she once more held it firm. The hand was weak, limp with\
  \ pain and a growing infection she could already feel.</p> \n    <p>But it would\
  \ do. It <i>had</i> to do.</p> \n    <p>In tiny twitches, Ameyanda began to run\
  \ the edge of the tooth over the leather, again and again.</p> \n    <p></p>\n \
  \   <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>\"I know what you did.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>It was hearing his own language, more than the words themselves, that\
  \ yanked Seyusth awake through the fog of pain. The room smelled of rotten wood,\
  \ and as he pried his eyes open, he could see huge blotches of mold and water damage\
  \ on the walls.</p> \n    <p>The room was also at a slight angle—no, <i>he</i> was\
  \ at a slight angle. They hadn't even bothered to stand the stake to which he was\
  \ crucified straight up; just leaned it in the corner.</p> \n    <p>And then full\
  \ awareness finally flooded through him, and he lowered his gaze to the one who'd\
  \ addressed him.</p> \n    <p>\"Issisk! Leaves and scales, you live!\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The younger lizardfolk stood in the chamber's open doorway, perhaps a bit\
  \ scrawnier than Seyusth recalled, but healthy enough. He nodded once, but otherwise\
  \ offered no response.</p> \n    <p>\"They allow you to move freely?\" Seyusth asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Largely. They keep eyes on me, to ensure I do not attempt to leave,\
  \ but otherwise I do as I will.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A strange sort of imprisonment.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And what makes you believe I am a prisoner, Seyusth?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>It was, somehow, shocking to the core of his soul and the precise answer he'd\
  \ anticipated, both at once. \"I don't understand. Issisk, why—?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  They needed another of our people,\" Issisk said, his voice oddly flat, even for\
  \ a reptile. \"They grew accustomed to having one of us work alongside them, to\
  \ serve as spy in Terwa territory, or negotiator with their patrols, or scout who\
  \ could swim farther than any human.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Accustomed to...\" Seyusth\
  \ was feeling dizzy, and not only from his wounds or the precarious angle.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"The one who had been with them was dying. They were <i>hunting</i> our\
  \ kind when they came across my patrol. I was the fortunate survivor, and I chose\
  \ cooperation over consumption. And I had some time to converse with my tribesmate\
  \ before he died of his illness.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Who... Who was...?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I thought you would never ask.\"</p> \n    <p>Issisk stepped aside, and\
  \ a second lizardman strode—no, shambled—through the door. The dull scales and gaping\
  \ holes were sufficient to tell Seyusth that this was the undead who had attacked\
  \ him in the swamp.</p> \n    <p>But this near, he could also see details he'd missed\
  \ at the time—including a face that, though partially worn away, he recognized.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Oh, spirits. Hasseth...\"</p> \n    <p>\"As I said, <i>murderer</i>,\"\
  \ the younger one hissed, \"I know what you did.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
