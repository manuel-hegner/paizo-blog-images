            <p itemprop="description"><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space"><em>Starfinder Near Space</em></a> releases this month, and to show off some of the new character options available in the book, we present Sheevak Smoke-Eater, an NPC antagonist and rival that you can use in your Starfinder campaigns. Among his many abilities, Sheevak utilizes an alternate vesk racial trait and the battle leader archetype, in addition to a new weapon in the form of the doshakari, all from <em>Near Space</em>. While NPCs don’t normally use themes, we’ve given Sheevak the stormrunner theme to give you a sneak peek at one of the new themes from the book as well. In addition, we offer a brief look at Sheevak’s current base of operations, the gas giant Ulthel, which is fully detailed in <em>Near Space</em>.</p>

                <hr> 
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                 <li><b>Brawny</b> Sheevak takes pride in being as physically fit as possible. He gains a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks. This alternate racial trait replaces fearless.</li> 
                 <li><b>Eye of the Storm</b> When in stormy conditions, Sheevak is able to gather greater information about his surroundings. His visibility range in a storm is reduced by only half, and he takes a –4 penalty to Perception checks instead of –8. When he succeeds at a Survival check to endure severe weather, he can move his full overland speed and still receive the +2 bonus to Fortitude saves against severe weather. He suffers the forced movement and takes damage from a failed Acrobatics check to fly in dangerous wind conditions only if he fails the check by 10 or more, instead of by 5 or more.</li> 
                 <li><b>Stormrunner Theme</b> Sheevak is trained to navigate the tumultuous atmospheres of gas giants with grace, learning weather patterns and recognizing the order in the apparent randomness of storms. Stormrunners gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Dexterity at character creation.</li> 
                 <li><b>Stormrunner Theme Knowledge</b> The life of a stormrunner is about beating the odds in high-risk situations. Reduce the DC of Survival checks to endure severe weather, orienteer, and predict weather when in rainy, snowy, or windy conditions by 5.</li> 
                 <li><b>Tactical Doshakari</b> This punch dagger resembles a miniature doshko extending from the knuckles, with one to four diamond‑shaped blades.</li> 
                 <li><b>Victory Cry (Ex)</b> Followers of a tradition that originated in the Veskarium among devout followers of Damoritosh, battle leaders are known for celebrating victories as they happen. Sheevak knows how to capitalize on his allies’ successes in battle, inspiring them to further incredible feats. As a reaction when Sheevak or an ally scores a critical hit against a significant enemy with an attack or drops a significant enemy to 0 Hit Points, he can issue a victory cry, choosing one of the following and providing its benefits to all allies within 60 feet (but not Sheevak himself):</li> 
                 <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                  <li><em>Got ’Em!</em>: Affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to damage rolls until the end of their next turn.</li> 
                  <li><em>Regroup</em>: The triggering ally regains 10 Stamina Points.</li>

                <p>Sheevak Smoke-Eater is a veteran stormrunner, leading a team salvaging minerals and other valuable resources from the atmospheres of gas giants. He’s currently working for Project Omega, a top secret research facility in orbit around the Near Space gas giant Ulthel. Sheevak’s mission is to take samples from ulthelim, the planet’s native species, for study by Project Omega’s scientists. Project leader Dr. Holton-8 pays well, and ethical characters who seek to shut down Sheevak and his employers are in for a fight. </p> 
                <p>For members of Sheevak’s stormrunning team, you can use the stats for the mercenary rookie on page 174 of <em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em>, but replace their Stealth skill with Acrobatics +13 and add the Eye of the Storm and Stormrunner Theme Knowledge special abilities from Sheevak’s stat block above.</p> 
                <h3>ULTHEL</h3> 
                <p>Ulthel is a gas giant in Near Space with a toxic atmosphere, home to a species of jellyfish-like creatures known as ulthelim. Early visitors to Ulthel reported hearing mental pleas from the ulthelim, which begged the visitors in a single cacophonous voice to partake of the planet’s wisdom, to merge with the clouds of ulthelim, and to become one with the planet as a single entity. These were always the last reports visitors logged before they themselves disappeared without a trace. To some, visiting the planet is a surefire death sentence. But to others, the transformative nature of the ulthelim represents a blueprint of utopia. To still others, the gas giant holds a potential gold mine of riches and scientific secrets that’s worth braving any risk.</p>

                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                <p>From <b>Jesse Davis</b> (IronHelixx), Regional Venture-Coordinator, Online Region:</p> 
                <p>Watching the virtual gaming space adapt, evolve, and grow over the last thirty+ years has been an interesting and exciting experience. It's grown from simple, kludgy, rudimentary tools to realistic 2-D, and even 3-D, tabletop experiences rivaling its analog progenitors, and even exceeding them in certain aspects. The virtual tabletop has allowed friends and family spread wide-and-far to continue, or even begin, their campaigns that otherwise would never have happened; its allowed people from all over the world to “sit” at virtual-tables together in ways impossible in the past; allowed those with no access to game-spaces to play when they would otherwise be without; and extended opportunities for those unable to attend conventions to finally take part in such events from the comfy confines of their own homes. Watching the org-play opportunities explode online over the last decade has been even more exciting to watch. The online world is now a vibrant 24/7, 365 community filled with gaming opportunities, for every system and style of play that you can imagine.

                <h3>Virtual Table Tops</h3> 
                <p>Living in an area with little in the ways of Society games locally, and between my job and family being unable to drive the hour to Toronto where games are abundant, I found myself drawn to the online community. While there is a little more of a learning curve compared to physical games, I found a welcoming and robust community drawn from all across the globe eager to take a new player under wing and show me the ropes. A few years later and I somehow ended up being the Venture Captain for the VTT Community and am now helping new players with the transition to online.</p> 
                <p>What is VTT? VTT stands for Virtual Table Top and is a system of online play utilizing a representation of the physical table top for maps and tokens. Instead of flip maps we use digital copies and images instead of mini’s/tokens. The most popular VTTs used for organized Play are Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds , which are usually accompanied by Discord or Google hangouts for voice chat capacities. Finally, when a game is done the GM will fill out the chronicle sheets using a PDF editor like Foxit or Adobe Reader and email them out to the players.<br> <b> — James Bartlett (Finegas)</b>, venture-captain VTT</p> 
                <p>I got involved in the VTT games a few years ago, and I have never looked back. The community is incredible. We have so many GMs and players from so many diverse backgrounds. Everyone is made to feel welcome, from new players looking to dip their toe into society play, all the way through to 5 Star and 5 Nova GMs, looking to help with conventions. One of my favourite things about our online community, is that everyone is always happy to help. Have a rules question? Come and ask in one of the rules channels. Need some support setting up your first table? Just ask! And (my personal favourite), asking if someone is happy to run their children through their first game, to help them learn about internet safety. Honestly. The PFS and SFS community worldwide is fantastic. And I believe we are lucky online to have built that same community feel- Just stretched over a few more miles! <br> <b>— Helen Yau</b>, venture-lieutenant VTT</p> 
                <p>Want to know the real secret to playing Society games online? It's easy. Really easy! If you can send an email, you can play online. The various virtual tabletop systems available are all fantastic and have many incredibly useful tools and options that you can use to build some amazing experiences and unforgettable games. With all these tools available it can sometimes seem daunting to get involved, but the most important part of the game is the players and GMs, with those and a short introduction to the basics of playing online you can jump in and be playing games with your regular group, or nufriends from across the world, the same evening you decide to try. We'll be very glad to see you there!<br> <b>— Rich Lowe</b>, venture-lieutenant VTT</p> 
                <p>Roll 20 my chosen virtual tabletop "VTT" is a robust tool that allows people from all over the world to join up and play Pathfinder/Starfinder just like we were sitting together in the same room. Moreover, it allows beginners and experts with the system to sit at the same table and use basic to advanced tools as each chooses. From relying on the built-in dice roller, to using character sheets or building simple to complex macros.<br> <b>— Steven Mombourquette</b>, venture-agent VTT</p>

                <p>From <b>Jesse Davis (IronHelixx)</b>, Regional Venture-Coordinator, Online Region:</p> 
                <p>Watching the virtual gaming space adapt, evolve, and grow over the last thirty+ years has been an interesting and exciting experience. It's grown from simple, kludgy, rudimentary tools to realistic 2-D, and even 3-D, tabletop experiences rivaling its analog progenitors, and even exceeding them in certain aspects. The virtual tabletop has allowed friends and family spread wide-and-far to continue, or even begin, their campaigns that otherwise would never have happened; its allowed people from all over the world to “sit” at virtual-tables together in ways impossible in the past; allowed those with no access to game-spaces to play when they would otherwise be without; and extended opportunities for those unable to attend conventions to finally take part in such events from the comfy confines of their own homes. Watching the org-play opportunities explode online over the last decade has been even more exciting to watch. The online world is now a vibrant 24/7, 365 community filled with gaming opportunities, for every system and style of play that you can imagine. We look forward to where it goes from here - and look forward to you joining us and becoming part of the virtual gaming community we love so much.</p> 
                <h3>Play-by-Post</h3> 
                <p>One of the best kept secrets Pathfinder is the Online Community. Not every community or individual has an established group of players or Lodge within a reasonable distance of them. This is what led me in search of online Pathfinder games several years ago. I came across Play-by-Post on the Paizo website and a very helpful and fun community. With games more than 2+ hours away from my home I was able to easily find games within the online Play-by-Post community. While they may take a bit longer (One post a day) than a traditional face to face game I can put more effort into the actual roleplaying aspect which helps enrich the purpose of our games. At first it might seem a bit overwhelming, but it is incredibly easy, and we have a great and wonderful community that will help guide you each step of the way. Come and join us for a game during these trying times. Locations can be found below:</p>

                <p><b>— Derek Larsen (Tyranius)</b>, venture-captain PbP</p> 
                <p>Play-by-post gaming was the one thing that kept me playing Pathfinder and roleplaying games in general. It started about 15 years ago when I moved away from the metro Boston area. I left a land of plenty when it came to game stores and places to engage in my favorite hobby to a place where few opportunities existed. So, I started getting into virtual tabletop games to satisfy my need to play. Then I started to have a family, one child then two, the third and fourth followed. Now with a full family and more responsibilities in my career, the time to set aside four or five hours at a time was no longer there. Play-by-post gaming which I had dabbled in before seemed like the natural solution. I found the Pathfinder Society group on Myth Weavers and jumped right in. Played a few games to get my feet wet, then tried my hand at GMing when I was ready. Fast forward a few years and our first VA had to leave his post and that when I was picked to step into the VO corps. While I play and GM on Paizo as well, my focus is on the smaller lodges. There may not always be a game mustering when you get there but stop in some time at <a href="https://rpggeek.com/guild/1329" target="_blank">RPG Geek</a> or <a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=19749" target="_blank">Myth weavers</a> and say hello. Tell us what you are interested in playing and maybe someone will be happy to help you find a game. We’ll certainly be willing to show you the ropes. Figuring out the post formats may take some getting used to, but we'll guide you along until you get used to it.<br><b>— Michael Hallet</b>, venture-lieutenant PbP</p> 
                <p>If a face-to-face roleplaying session is like exploring the set of a big-budget movie, a Play-by-Post or PbP game is akin to living inside the pages of a great book. PbP evokes the literary roots of fantasy gaming. And just as you are unlikely to digest an entire book in one sitting, you can play a PbP game as much, or as little, as you like throughout the day and weeks. The text format and slower pacing allow time to experience vivid, detailed descriptions, deep, internal monologues, and shrewd, sharp-witted negotiations. When I play via PbP, my bards' songs are more lyrical, my androids’ computations are more analytical, my clerics are more prayerful, and my gnomes are more playful. My insightful envoy can readily pick up on the thoughts in the room. My crazed, mad witch usually has a song running through her head. My incompetent witchwyrd spy always finds his well-planned schemes becoming thwarted by his more savvy, fellow party members. My pompous, scholarly wizard spouts out facts with Wikipedia-like knowledge. And whenever someone speaks to her, my wise-cracking ysoki always-- always-- has the perfect, instant comeback. Indeed, if one didn't know any better, they'd almost think that she'd taken several hours, perhaps even days, to come up with it.<br><b>— Lysle Kapp</b>venture-agent PbP</p>
                <p></p> 
                <p>I first became involved in RPGs several decades ago though I did not have my first Organized Play experience until August 2017. I had a great local community to play with and within a year I had GMed my first game, attended my first PaizoCon, and discovered Play-by-Post (PbP). The online community was just as welcoming and supportive, and I discovered PbP provides the ideal environment to improve my roleplaying and GMing skills. It also provides an opportunity to play with others in very many areas of the world and without needing to commit a significant single block of time or share a time zone. I have since begun to enjoy the different benefits of online VTT (virtual table top) play, also with an international group of players. I am happy and honored to be a part of the team that helps provide structure for our Online Organized Play community.<br><b>— Katrina Hennessy</b>, venture-agent PbP</p> 
                <p>Though I didn’t participate in my first Play-by-Post under the Organized Play umbrella until 2015 I’d discovered the format nearly a year and a half earlier by random chance and pretty quickly fell in love. Some of my fellow Venture Officers have already laid out many of the wonderful advantages to be found by playing online such as flexibility, convenience, and expanded opportunities for roleplay. Yet the one that has been the most meaningful in a personal sense is that Play-by-Post has allowed me to find my own voice and tap into a sense of creativity that I never knew I had, all through the power of writing and cooperative storytelling. It allows me to be the things I want to be and express myself in a way that I’ve always had a difficult time doing at face-to-face tables. The feeling this gives me is something that I wouldn’t trade for the world - and it’s a feeling that I’d love to share with others. So, if Play-by-Post sounds appealing to you, please drop in at any of the lodges and say hello! We’d love to meet you and help you get started.<br><b>— Kristin Wilhite</b>, venture-agent PbP</p> 
                <h3>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</h3> 
                <p>While our colleagues over in the roleplaying game space have many options for where and how to run their games, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is understandably more constrained… after all, PACG cards don’t fall under the Open Gaming License. Despite this, Paizo has been more than willing to work with those of us who don’t have the time or opportunity to meet in face-to-face space to play this game that many of us are very passionate about. Over the past year or so the online PACG community has been consistently growing. To handle that growth an online system, which can be found at <a href="https://acg.orgplayonline.com/accounts/login/" target="_blank">acg.orgplayonline.org</a>, has been created to allow for games to be played through play-by-post on the Paizo forums. This system is still in its relative infancy, but it allows games to be run by a “box runner” (or BR), with that BR posting updates to the forums and players posting their actions and a summary of their current hand. You can see an example of one of these games, where BR AAUGHWHY has been running myself and others through all 6 adventures of the Season of Tapestry Tide <a href="https://paizo.com/campaigns/v5748p75ivkh3/gameplay">here</a>.</p> 
                <p>For more info on how this all works, check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkot?A-New-Way-to-Play-the-Pathfinder-Adventure">second half of this blog post</a> which gives a high-level overview. If you’re interested in trying out one of these games, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge">Flaxseed On Deck Lodge</a>. There we have instructions on how to get involved as well as other resources that can help you get started with building your character deck to play online.</p> 
                <p>In addition to our play-by-post system, we’ve been authorized for the time being to allow for other methods of play. Some of our player base has had luck with running games using web cameras, with players using the <a href="https://pacg.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Adventure_Card_Game_Wiki" target="_blank">PACG Wiki</a> to reference cards they acquire and may not have physical copies of. We’re also looking into additional options, so please feel free to post in the <a href="https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge/discussion&amp;page=last">Flaxseed On Deck Lodge discussion thread</a> if you’d like to propose or ask about other options.</p> 
                <p>We very much look forward to having you join us in playing PACG online!<br><b>—Tyler Beck</b>, venture-captain online ACG</p> 
                <p>I got involved in Play-by-Post for Pathfinder Adventure Card Game a few years ago because my schedule does not always allow me to take large blocks of time to play with my local group. That makes it difficult for me to attend regularly and complete a campaign with them. What I like about play-by-post is that it can be done anywhere, and it takes less time out of my day spread out over a week rather than all in one afternoon. Basically, it's been a convenient way to get a little dose of ACG on a regular basis without straining my schedule. Another part of the online play-by-post I have enjoyed is that it allows players to connect from all over the world. </p> 
                <p>Something somewhat unique to play-by-post for the card game is that some players choose to roleplay their turns. This is not required by any means but is sometimes a nice way to add flavor to turns that I have never seen at a face-to-face card game session. Here’s an example from <a href="http://paizo.com/campaigns/ACGCaGSeasonOfTheRighteousByRedeux/gameplay&amp;page=26#1259">Amaryllis meeting a Treachery Demon</a>, or <a href="https://paizo.com/campaigns/v5748p75ivkfi/gameplay&amp;page=5#239">Lem fighting a Cultist</a>.</p> 
                <p>We have many helpful players so don’t be afraid to check out the resources Tyler provided and ask questions as needed. We were all new to the online format and/or card game at one point or another!<br><b>—Race Dorsey</b>, venture-agent online ACG</p> 
                <p>A huge thank you to Online Regional Venture-Coordinator Jesse Davis and his team for assisting our community and sharing their knowledge!</p> 
                <p>See you tomorrow for the second half. Until then – Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">I just wanted to update you with new information about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Paizo and what it means for you. As you know, the situation is changing rapidly and the team here at Paizo is having to take in new government rules, regulations, and health department guidance on almost a daily basis.</p> 
                <p>On Monday, March 23rd, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee issued a stay-at-home order for non-essential businesses. Most of Paizo has been working from home for a while now, but our warehouse team had been continuing to ship orders to distributors and paizo.com customers. Paizo will now be closing our warehouse for two weeks starting on the evening of Wednesday, March 25 and put those workers on a paid furlough during that time. The team is working hard to finish March subscription shipments before this shutdown. After two weeks, we plan to resume warehouse shipments unless the situation dictates that we do otherwise. Our customer service team will continue to work from home answering your questions. They have a thread on our forums to keep customers updated with their progress on customer requests: <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42z7x?Paizo-Customer-Service-Status-Updates-What">Paizo Customer Service Status Updates &amp; What to Do</a>.</p> 
                <p>We can still fulfill PDF sales, and we will be launching a PDF sale later this week. Buying PDFs is a great way to help Paizo get through these troubling times as well as getting great gaming products at great prices! Watch for an email announcing the sale in your inbox later this week.</p> 
                <p>I must also announce that we have made the decision to cancel PaizoCon 2020. Though we and our partners at the DoubleTree Hotel believe this is the best course of action for the safety of our staff and attendees, this is particularly sad for us because we at Paizo really enjoy having the chance to hang out with all of you and play games for a weekend. There will be a number of options for dealing with your badge and banquet ticket purchases, including rolling it forward to next year with a nice gift waiting for you at PaizoCon 2021 to thank you for sticking with us through these times. If you have purchased a badge, look for an email explaining your options soon. Our customer service team would greatly appreciate if you could wait to contact them about PaizoCon badge options until after we have sent out the email to badge holders.</p> 
                <p>The staff has been hard at work from home. <em>The Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em> and the Starfinder <em>Starship Operations Manual</em> have both been sent to the printer to be delivered in time for Gen Con, and other products are going to the printer each week. There is a light at the end of this tunnel, and we want to make sure that there are new roleplaying game products there for you to enjoy when we get through it.</p> 
                <p>Once again, thanks so much for your kind words of support and your continued patronage of our products. Together, we can get through these difficult times. We look forward to seeing many of you at the gaming table soon.</p>

                <h3>WELCOME TO NEAR SPACE</h3> 
                <p>In the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, the discovery of the hyperspace dimension known as the Drift has granted explorers access to a plethora of new worlds. Home to many sapient species both peaceful and otherwise, Near Space is not a single geographical area. Rather, it is defined by how quickly one can reach a world using the Drift, which depends on how many of the mysterious Drift beacons are nearby. One world might be virtually unreachable to another through normal travel, but the two might be neighbors via Near Space and can therefore reach one another in a matter of days.</p>

                <p>Is this what my forebears felt, some 300 years ago, fighting against the vesk invaders intent on reconquering a world they knew they had once controlled? Or even longer ago, before the Gap, when the Veskarium first came to Pulonis and claimed it as Vesk-6, the newest part of their empire?</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032320_VeskRobertoPitturru.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/032320_VeskRobertoPitturru.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div> 
                <p>But this isn’t a war. We aren’t a guerilla team fending off an invasion—it’s a training exercise, and the vesk in the clearing are as much my teammates as the other pahtras in the trees around me. The largest and boldest vesk in our unit leads the way, with just over a half-dozen others not far behind her. One vesk for each pahtra in our unit. Usually we train side-by-side, learning from one another, but today we’ve been divided up, pahtras against vesk. My own vesk partner stands firmly in the center of his unit, holding his rifle steady and firing careful blasts. It’s a typical vesk tactic, all stoic and solid and focused on formation, while my half of the unit has split up, each of us blending into the trees and utilizing the tactics that work best for us. </p> 
                <p>It makes Major Koboratash furious, our disregard for formal strategies. It’s also how we’ve won the last six of these mock battles. I wonder what she’s trying to accomplish, dividing us up into Team Pahtra and Team Vesk when the high despot’s program has us training side by side in the first place. I know some of my teammates think the major is secretly training the vesk to fight some of the pahtra resistance cells active near Leapfang Bay. I hope they’re wrong.</p> 
                <p>I wait for my chance to leap into the fray, watching for an opening, a distraction, an opportunity. My gaze settles on Jaskenayo, a particularly stodgy vesk with dark green scales, and the fur down the back of my neck suddenly stiffens. A shiver runs down the length of my spine. Something here is... wrong. I can’t say what or why or even how I know, but something about him has me deeply unsettled. His movements aren’t quite in step with the others, the tracking of his beady eyes just a little jerky. Like he’s watching the skirmish and reacting just a nanosecond too slow to be real. I’ve never seen anything like it before, and the tension along my spine grows so tight it’s painful. Something here is deeply, terribly wrong.</p> 
                <p>I slip back into the shadows. Make my way around the simulated firefight, slinking along the underbrush, until I’m off to one side, almost opposite our war drummer. Slowly, careful not to draw attention to my movements, I dump the blanks from my rifle and swap in the magazine of live ammunition from my belt. We all carry it, as a precaution against the countless predators of Vesk-6, since you never know when a sky viper might turn a training exercise into a life-or-death fight. Somehow, even though I can’t say why, I know this is one of those times.</p> 
                <p>The headstrong scrapper of my unit gives me the opening I need, rushing in to take on the frontline vesk with her bare hands like the reckless brawler she is. I lift my rifle, take careful aim. Breathe out. Pull the trigger. </p> 
                <p>Jaskenayo goes down so easily. He hadn’t seen me, and I was so close my single shot punched right through his overplate. He falls with a strangled cry. </p> 
                <p>Chaos breaks out. Of course it does—these training exercises aren’t supposed to be lethal. Everyone is shouting, and eight standard-issue Veskarium laser rifles swing around to focus on me, sharp clicks ringing out as they, too, are switched to a lethal setting. The hammering rhythm of the war drum falters, and then ceases altogether. My pahtra teammates stare, aghast. I feel my vesk partner’s eyes on me, betrayed and furious.</p> 
                <p>My fear—that creeping sensation of wrongness—dissipates almost as soon as Jaskenayo’s body hits the ground. But it’s immediately replaced by a different kind of fear, less visceral and much more intellectual, as Major Koboratash’s outraged shouts resound through the jungle. Demanding to know what just happened. What I thought I was doing. And I realize, really realize, what I’ve done. I just killed my teammate. Our war drummer’s partner. My partner’s childhood friend. </p> 
                <p>The major stomps up to me, and I hand over my rifle. I try to explain myself, but I don’t have the words for it. I have no proof, no justification—I just knew something was wrong. She doesn’t believe me, of course. She sees a recruit killed by friendly fire. A personal vendetta turned lethal. </p> 
                <p>I can’t even pretend it was an accident. They’ll court-martial me, and I’ll be discharged, dishonorably, without the Soldier’s Due. </p> 
                <p>Then, behind the major, Jaskenayo’s body twitches. I flinch back, and the major spins around as the dead vesk body jerks and shudders. Then, horribly, his body seems to deflate as a slick, bulbous ooze slithers out from beneath his armor. </p> 
                <p>A hymothoa. </p> 
                <p>I understand, then. I hadn’t encountered one of the indigenous oozes before, but I knew about them. Like how they eat away at a host’s organs and replace them, puppeting them around in pursuit of goals no one has ever been able to understand. And that some pahtras have something of a sixth sense for hymothoas, when most other species have no way to detect them other than with extensive medical scanning—something almost impossible here given our planet’s unpredictable magnetic storms.</p> 
                <p>The major snaps out an order, and suddenly eight azimuth laser rifles are firing on the thing with lethal force. When I blink away the afterimage of eight laser beams, all that remains of the hymothoa is a damp patch on the leafy jungle floor beside Jaskenayo’s now-unmoving form. I begrudgingly admit to myself that the vesk weapons have some benefits after all—my own rifle would have been far less effective against an amorphous foe.</p> 
                <p>Major Koboratash looks back at me, scowling. “You knew?”</p> 
                <p>I nod and stammer, trying to put into words the gut feeling, the absolute certainty that things weren’t the way they should be. Childhood tales flit through my mind, warning of the bogeyman oozes, but I can’t use a ghost story as a justification. My heart is hammering louder than the war drums had before. She can still court-martial me. Have me discharged. Order the squad to turn their laser rifles on me and fire—the Army of the Veskarium certainly has no overabundance of mercy. </p> 
                <p>But she cuts me off with a snarl and a sharp gesture. “That was well done, Gunner Sehvet.”</p> 
                <p>I shut my mouth. The major looks between me and the unmoving corpse on the jungle floor. I wonder what the ooze had hoped to accomplish by parasitizing Jaskenayo. Probably nothing good—for all their inscrutability, the creatures seem to have as much resentment of the vesk occupation of our planet as the most deeply entrenched pahtra resistance cells.</p> 
                <p>The major barks new orders. She turns north and leads the way as if nothing unusual had happened. We all leap to comply, vesk and pahtra alike. Lines form as we pair up with our counterparts and begin the strict, regimented march back to Command 6. My vesk partner falls into place beside me, and I can feel his uneasy eyes watching me, but now isn’t the time for chatter. I don’t know what I’d say anyway, because I have a sinking feeling this is just the beginning.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.astraltabletop.com/" target="_blank">Astral</a> currently only supports just the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook, but it has a lot of amazing tools and features to manage your campaign. Features like animated maps, weather effects, line of sight, an intuitive interface to help keep up with the game’s rules, and so much more! I have been using Astral to run demos of Pathfinder Second Edition, and I love it more and more every session. With its easy drag and drop interface, I find myself being able to Game Master fairly efficiently with my improv style storytelling.</p> 
                <p>Astral as of this time is opening up their paid features for free until the end of April, so for newbies and veterans of virtual tabletop, now is the time to give Astral a try. </p> 
                <p>For those needing help learning how to use Astral, I highly recommend checking out Astral’s tutorials provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF-1m1Da47rCzURCZjC448K6WXNVHL9zg" target="_blank">here</a> to help you get started.</p>

So for those wanting to play through <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/store/product.php?id=PZOSMWPZO90151FG" target="_blank">Pathfinder Second Edition’s Extinction Curse Adventure Path</a> or any other Adventure Path you can do so fully prepared for your Game Master and players in Fantasy Grounds.

Also, shout out to all the Pathfinder &amp; Starfinder fan-made discords out there (I’m lurking in a few of them). Discord allows you to host private chats &amp; calls to help organize your tabletop RPG campaigns. And the best part is that the entire service is free! One of the significant advantages of Discord is the ability to find games within various servers. Check your favorite fan websites or fan groups, and see if they have a Discord server. Then ask if anyone is up for playing a game! Discord is a great platform to find like-minded communities, gaming sessions, and friends!</p>

                <p>Strange forces assail the Swardlands, breadbasket to the city of Absalom. A malevolent spirit haunts the region’s leader, an unseen murderer mutilates her victims, and malicious forces occupy the once-sacred aeon towers. The heroes must stop the killings, repel subterranean invaders, and stun the people of the Swardlands with circus shows the likes of which they’ve never seen! The Extinction Curse Adventure Path continues with “Life’s Long Shadows,” an adventure for 9th- to 11th-level characters.</p>

                <p>Explore the breadbasket of the Isle of Kortos, including its towns, personalities, and mysteries in <em>Swardlands Gazetteer</em> by Greg A. Vaughan!</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“A city with nearly a third of a million souls, Absalom—the City at the Center of the World—has a huge logistical burden in feeding its populace. When Aroden, the Last Azlanti, raised the island from the depths of the sea, he foresaw this need and blessed it with fecundity through the aeon towers and their magical aeon orbs. Even after Aroden’s death, these towers nurture what was once barren, submarine rock.</p> 
                 <p>However, as the influence of Aroden has waned in the century since his death, so too has the power of the aeon orbs. What was once a near-perfect cornucopia of growing lands for crops and timber—a region virtually untouched by climatic fluctuation or soil exhaustion— has begun, in small increments, to creep back toward a more mundane environment as the power of the aeon orbs slowly dwindles. The expected multiple harvests per year have become unreliable, timber stands are sparse and recover slowly from logging, and the soil in some fields has become exhausted, forcing farmers to leave them fallow. Some people of the Swardlands— Swardfolk, as they call themselves—are on the verge of panic, while others blithely ignore the changes around them, insisting any change must be only temporary or imaginary. Something has to change, and soon, or the Swardlands will fail. And if the Swardlands fail, can Absalom be far behind?”</p>

                <p>Unbury the dogma and mythos of the gluttonous demon lord Zevgavizeb, god of subterranean horrors, cavern‐dwelling reptiles, and debased xulgaths in <em>Zevgavizeb</em> by Amber Stewar</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“Zevgavizeb—the Beast of Gluttondark, Lord of Reptiles, and Sun-Devourer—is a ravenous and cruel demon lord whose followers commit heinous sacrifices and engage in long, brutal wars in the name of their deity. Beyond his followers among the xulgaths (also known as troglodytes) who form the majority of his congregation, Zevgavizeb is little known among mortals, for his interests rarely extend beyond his own Abyssal demesne and his insatiable hunger. Most scholarly works describe him briefly, pointing to his origins as a qlippoth before his ascension to demonkind as one possible explanation for his insatiable hunger and unquenchable bloodlust. The Sun-Devourer alternates between periods of genocidal gluttony and torpid slumber, with his followers reflecting this pattern of war and peace in their cycles of catastrophic collapse and societal elevation.</p> 
                 <p>Faithful xulgaths believe that each period of Zevgavizeb’s infamous slumber allows the demon lord to literally digest and incorporate some portion of the knowledge of those he devours and those sacrificed in his name. In this state of torpor, there is little to fear from the Lord of Reptiles, and his followers enjoy periods of peace and prosperity. When the demon lord’s hunger riles him once more, though, the shock waves of his cravings can be felt in the very bones of his devotees, who themselves become driven to rage-fueled violence. These “ravenings,” as xulgaths refer to the periods of war that coincide with Zevgavizeb’s hunger, have kept his cults in eons-long conflicts and stunted the development of their societies for as long as they have worshipped the dread demon. His adherents believe that each cycle of sleep and rampage progresses the Beast of Gluttondark toward some unknown endgame. While other civilizations disregard Zevgavizeb’s followers as brutish cannibals and warmongers, they fail to see that the deity’s adherents remain in a state of relative unenlightenment only due to the nightmarish culls that fuel their ancestral deity’s continuing apotheosis.”</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>For more information on Zevgavizeb’s personification, realm, dogma, worshippers, temples, shrines, priests, holidays, aphorisms, holy text, relations with other religions, and new rules—including a Zevgavizeb-themed background, feat, and spell—devour the full five-page article. </p>

                <p>This volume presents a new ancestry, archetypes, monsters, and much more in the <em>Adventure Toolbox</em> by Anthony Bono, Jacob W. Michaels, Andrew Mullen, Patrick Renie, Alex Riggs, Timothy Snow, and Greg A. Vaughan. Yes, there are three new magic items, ten new monsters, the golem grafter and lumberjack archetypes, but this volume contains a surprise that I think will bring us all delight for years to come — the shoony ancestry!</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“Diminutive humanoids who resemble squat, bipedal dogs, shoonies are sometimes mistaken for weak and insular pacifists. However, their sheer perseverance, incredible work ethic, and resourceful use of diplomacy make shoonies far from helpless.</p> 
                 <p>According to shoonies, Aroden created their kind to provide him with pleasant company soon after he created the Isle of Kortos. Shoony culture is rooted in this myth and its implications, which help to explain the ancestry’s long reputation for hospitality, good will, and pacifism. War is antithetical to the shoony way of life; shoonies rely on cooperation and persistence to make their way through a world that can seem at times hellbent on destroying them. Shoonies are unflappable in their optimism and always see the best in others, even when faced with frequent subjugation and exploitation that might create bitterness or xenophobia among other societies. To shoonies, peace is a goal always worth striving for, and no villain is beyond redemption, so they aim to resolve problems with peaceful solutions.”</p>

                <p>Often in Pathfinder, we focus on creatures that are cruel and vicious, to better serve as foes for player characters. But right now, I think a humble yokai that seeks to do good deserves its own spotlight. So here is my “picture” of the amabie, sketched with words, to give to you.</p> 
                <table style="width:50%">

                <p><b>Disease</b> Sense The amabie detects sources of disease and creatures that are infected with a disease, but receives no information beyond the location of the disease or such afflicted creatures.</p> 
                <p><b>Warding Visage</b> An amabie’s image helps ward off sickness and bad fortune. For this ability to function, a non-amabie creature must clearly see the amabie and succeed at a DC 10 Crafting (Artistry) check to create an image of the amabie within 7 days. Any creature that sees this image within the next 28 days can use a +11 modifier to saving throws against diseases and curse effects instead of its own saving throw modifier for the next 14 days. Once a creature has gained a bonus from a specific amabie’s warding visage ability, it is permanently immune to that amabie’s warding visage ability.</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, March 29, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> 
                </ul>

                <p>We are excited to introduce our new licensed partner, Geek Grind Coffee Company! Their limited-edition whole bean Goblin Gulp Coffee is hand-harvested in Colombia and will arrive in April 2020. You can pre-order right now at a special discount price with early-bird pricing.</p>

                <p>Goblin Gulp is 100% Colombian coffee which Geek Grind Coffee Company harvests in the mountains, sun-dried and roasted to perfection. The taste notes are ripe red fruits, green apple, and vanilla, with medium body, low acidity. The caffeine content is somewhat higher than average for a 100% Colombian. It is smooth, delicious, and perfect for breakfast or after dinner via drip or french press. It is also outstanding for espresso shots. The coffee is whole bean so you can grind as needed, according to your use and brew style.</p>

                <p><b>Only Natural Methods</b><br> A lot has changed in the world of coffee in the last hundred years but the best way to get from farm to your cup is not necessarily one of them. Handpicked, hand dried in the sun, carefully sorted and roasted quickly in small batches; this is how they do it. Sometimes the old way is still the best way. This is as true today for Geek Grind Coffee as it was when they started more than 40 years ago.</p>

                <a href="/image/content/Blog/PaizoPreview_360.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/PaizoPreview_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Apologies in advance for adding yet another COVID-19 email into your inbox, but it’s important that I let you know how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Paizo and what we are doing about it.</p> 
                <p>As you know, social distancing is the most important way that we, as a society, have to fight this new viral threat. Three weeks ago, I started the process of shifting almost all Paizo employees from working in our Redmond offices to working from home; they will continue to do so until we believe it is safe to congregate in our office again. For now, our small-but-valiant warehouse team remains in place, shipping orders to both customers and distributors. Even in the warehouse, we practice social distancing, staggering work schedules and limiting the number of people in each area of the warehouse; if we are given cause to believe that their safety is compromised, we will cease warehouse operations until the crisis passes.</p> 
                <p>As for the products and packages our warehouse team is handling (including products made in China and other countries), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that “In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures... Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods.” (See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</a> for more information.)</p> 
                <p>Working from home does require Paizo to sacrifice some of our normal procedures. Our customer service team can’t answer the phones from home, so until we are able to move back to the office, customer service is available only by email (customer.service@paizo.com) and via the <a href="paizo.com/community/forums/paizo/customerService">Customer Service forum</a> on paizo.com. We have also unfortunately had to cancel all of our visits to gaming conventions and trade shows for the foreseeable future.</p> 
                <p>Which brings us to PaizoCon. The safety of our attendees and staff is of paramount importance, and we are working closely with our host hotel and monitoring local, state, and federal government guidelines on a daily basis. The Washington State government is currently prohibiting gatherings of 50 or more people, though the timeframe does not yet approach the announced dates for PaizoCon (May 22–25). If the gathering ban or other concerns suggest that we should cancel or postpone PaizoCon, we will inform the community as soon as we can.</p> 
                <p>While Paizo is currently able to carry on with relatively few issues, many game stores are unfortunately at risk of going out of business if the pandemic goes on for an extended period of time. If your local store is still open, please help them out by buying from them when you can.</p> 
                <p>Please also keep in mind that social distancing doesn’t have to mean the end of social gaming. Our partners at <a href="http://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php" target="_blank">Fantasy Grounds</a>, <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank">Roll20</a>, and <a href="https://d20pro.com/" target="_blank">D20PRO</a> provide great tools for playing roleplaying games online. Paizo also hosts some great <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/campaigns">play-by-post campaigns</a>, so you can practice social distancing and still have a great time gaming with your friends.</p> 
                <p>We are at the start of one of the more difficult moments in the history of the world. We are going to have to help our neighbors, our local businesses, and each other get through this. It won’t be easy, but Paizo will be here fighting to keep great RPG products coming into your homes. </p> 
                <p>Thank you for your continued friendship and business. We will update you when the situation changes.</p>

                <h2>Pathfinder Society Releases</h2> 
                <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! This month we’ve got a couple exciting scenarios for you and one awesome quest, so I’ll be jumping right in and letting you know what those are.</p> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0232v?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-116-The-Perennial-Crown-Part-1-Opal-of-Bhopan"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario # 1-16: The Perennial Crown Part 1, Opal of Bhopan</i></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0232w?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-117-The-Perennial-Crown-Part-2-The-Thorned-Monarch"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-17: The Perennial Crown Part 2, The Thorned Monarch</i></a> are a pair of back-to-back Tier 3–6 scenarios written by Alex Augunas, veteran Paizo freelancer and third-party publisher, and Thilo Graf, who you might know for his comprehensive reviews of tabletop gaming products at <a href="http://endzeitgeist.com/" target="_blank">endzeitgeist.com</a> and contributions to high-profile third-party products like Lost Sphere Publishing’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y52?The-City-of-7-Seraphs"><i>City of 7 Seraphs</i></a>. When I reached out to Alex and Thilo about working on this project, I knew I had something really unique and I had a strong feeling that they were the ones who could give it to me. <i>The Perennial Crown</i> adventures are part of the Open Road season metaplot, which send the Pathfinders sailing down the eastern coast of Garund to the famed island of Bhopan, where founding Pathfinder Selmius Foster met his end some four centuries ago. On this island that much of the Inner Sea has considered to be practically mythological for hundreds of years, the PCs will find that both their enemies and allies are fey and inscrutable, bound by beliefs, traditions, and ambitions far older than the Pathfinder Society or most nations of the Inner Sea.</p> 
                <p>In addition to exciting new NPCs like the one pictured here, be ready to see these adventures showcase some of the exciting new subsystems introduced in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide"><i>Pathfinder GameMastery Guide</i></a>!</p>

                <p>For this month’s quest, Alexandria Bustion shares her awesomeness and takes us to Numeria with Tier 3–6 quest <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0232u?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-8-Shadows-of-the-Black-Sovereign"><i>Pathfinder Society Quest #8: Shadows of the Black Sovereign</i></a>! Numeria is a land of high technology ruled by a warrior-king, and for years the Pathfinder Society has been banned from operating within its borders. This hasn’t stopped Venture-Captain Dagur Hawksight from maintaining a secret lodge in the border town of Hajoth Hakados, however, and now the time for the Pathfinders to step out of the shadows has come once more! Not everyone is excited to see the Pathfinders joining Numeria’s political scene, and as the Black Sovereign himself makes his way to the lodge, Dagur finds that a scribe has gone missing with ledgers critical to sealing a deal that would allow the Pathfinders to more openly explore the country and its technological wonders. Can the PCs track down the critical documents and missing scribe before Numeria’s iron-fisted warlord arrives to drive the Pathfinders from Numeria once and for all?</p> 
                <p>That’s all I’ve got for you adventurers! Good luck in the battles to come, and until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                <h2>Starfinder Society Releases</h2> 
                <p>Two new adventures coming to you this month, including our first trip to Vesk-controlled territory, as well as an extraplanar jaunt that starts the endgame for our Season 2 storyline. Let’s see what’s on the docket!</p> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x5?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Truth-Keepers"><i>Starfinder Society #2-19: Truth Keepers</i></a> is a repeatable Tier 3-6 scenario from 5-nova GM Natalie Kertzner and new author (and prolific GM) John Curtin. This one starts with a bang, as an evening of relaxation at a Starfinder bar is interrupted by an attack! To retrieve a stolen artifact, the PCs will have to travel to the heart of the Veskarium itself and tangle with a fringe cult of vesk soldiers. This adventure features randomized elements, as well as a number of colorful NPCs, that are sure to keep you coming back for more! And if you’re really hungry for more Veskarium, pick up <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zud?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space"><i>Starfinder: Near Space</i></a>, on shelves next week! </p> 
                <p>The Seeker’s Respite (the bar in question) is a regular hangout for Starfinder agents. Inside, while your time away celebrating Starfinders new and old, joining in a vidgame, or just stewing with other agents over this terrible equipment they keep sending you out with, I mean, this battery barely holds a charge, and I’m pretty sure this second skin is more like a fifth skin at this point…</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Starfinder Society #2-20: Shades of Spite is a Tier 7-10 scenario from veteran author Vanessa Hoskins. Those of you keeping up with the Year of a Thousand Bites storyline will likely have strong feelings about a particular white-furred ysoki, and many are asking: “Why is Datch like this?” To get the answer to that question, the PCs, along with a priest of Lao Shu Po, venture to the Shadow Plane. While there, a master assassin tests their mettle, in the hopes that they get what they need to finally defeat their foe.</p> 
                <p>We’re in the endgame of year 2 now, and the only thing standing between the Starfinders and Datch’s machinations is this enigmatic individual. Will the PCs convince him to share what he knows, or does he have other motivations entirely?</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Alrighty, that’s it for March’s releases! Come back next month we’ve got a notorious collector bringing the Swarm to the Pact Worlds, and the next stage in an ongoing historical treasure hunt.</p> 
                <p>Until next time,</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Roberto Pitturru.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>“I still do not understand you mammals!” Obozaya sounded more amused than perplexed. “If the atmosphere’s odor is so terrible it turns you into mewling monkeys, why not activate your environmental controls rather than just using the breather mask?”</p> 
                <p>Zemir ignored the “monkeys” jab. He was still relatively new to the crew of the Sunrise Maiden, hired for his power to search through and bring things from various iterations of reality. Obozaya was a respected, veteran member of the crew, and Zemir was better off humoring her. If he could earn Obozaya’s trust, the rest of the crew would quickly follow.</p> 
                <p>“There are two reasons.” Zemir sidestepped a group of haggling kasathas and picked up his pace to walk next to the vesk. “The first is that I’m not sure how much I trust this filter to pull the actual toxins out of the air, given how much of the rotting-fish-and-eggs odor it lets in. Since we’re here to get surplus air filters and pressurized tents so the rest of our crew can operate on this planet long-term—longer than our armor’s environmental seals will last—I’d like to test this model in the field. I don’t fully trust AbadarCorp’s marketing claims.”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya nodded, her teeth flashing briefly in what Zemir had come to believe was an expression of appreciation. Vesk might be one of a dozen species immune to the toxins in this planet’s air, but she was pragmatic enough that she certainly wouldn’t want her teammates hampered by nausea and weakness if their mission ran more than a few days.</p> 
                <p>“Secondly... are we being followed?”</p> 
                <p>Zemir did not change the tone of his voice at all, and to her credit Obozaya did not spin to look around. Instead she simply angled her path to skirt a denser part of the crowded market’s patrons. Zemir fell in behind her, moving through the wake she made in the throng. Creatures of half a dozen species cursed and stepped in behind them, shaking fists and raising their chins in angry postures. Which meant it was easy for Zemir to spot the group following them as they plowed into the already-agitated crowd, shoving sapients out of their way while remaining quiet and taking on hunched postures, trying to keep their profiles below the general level of the market’s customers.</p> 
                <p>There were three of them, short and broad humanoids in heavy armor. Zemir guessed they were lashuntas... or dwarves, though he had much less experience with dwarves. Their equipment was worn and patched, but looked functional enough. All three had laser rifles of some kind slung over their shoulders, and holstered sidearms. Their armors’ environmental seals were active, protecting them from the extreme discomfort of the atmosphere, and making their faces harder to discern.</p> 
                <p>But their facial tattoos were clear enough. He shifted his view, searching through nearby iterations of his own reality, and saw the three figures following someone on this street, at this time, in most alternate realities. Their presence here was not random.</p> 
                <p>Obozaya took a sharp turn onto another major road and stepped to the side, allowing Zemir to pass her. She shot him a glance with a raised brow ridge.</p> 
                <p>“Three of them, definitely following us. Short, maybe korasha. Facial tattoos.”</p> 
                <p>“Golden League?” Obozaya asked.</p> 
                <p>Zemir shrugged. “I don’t know the local families well enough to hazard a guess. Would Golden League assassins be likely to want you dead?”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya shook her head once, firmly, while unclipping the safety strap from her stellar cannon. Zemir bit his lower lip, though his mask concealed the expression. If they weren’t Xun assassins, then they were most likely just robbers, possibly drawn by his own obvious good taste in equipment. In that was the case, Obozaya and he could likely deal with them if it came to a fight, but likely not without getting ejected from the market for getting flechette holes in nearby shops. And even if he could talk their way out of expulsion, the shop they were headed to for supplies might close for the day if there was talk of a brawl in the street</p> 
                <p>Of course if they <i>were</i> robbers, their main motivation would be to make a quick credit in a shakedown.</p> 
                <p>Zemir put a hand on Obozaya’s arm. “Follow my lead.” </p>
                <p>Her brow ridge went up even higher, but she nodded. Just as the three tattooed pursuers rounded the corner, Zemir stepped into the street and turned to face Obozaya.</p> 
                <p>“NOW you want your back pay?”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya was clearly surprised, but covered it quickly enough, especially since all eyes were on Zemir. She growled at him, which he hoped was just her way of playing along.</p> 
                <p>“I’m mortgaged to the hilt!” Zemir let exasperation leak into his voice. “I’ve even been reduced to wearing cheap knock-off fashion. Not a thing on me is worth a tenth its appearance. And since the family disowned me, I can’t turn to them for support!”</p> 
                <p>At first the squat ruffians simply stood in shock and stared at Zemir complaining to his apparent bodyguard, but as he continued to describe the dire straits of his finances, and lack of extended family, their expressions went from shock to sour. About the time he claimed he could pay Obozaya in a week, when his next loan came through, the lashuntas—he’d seen at least one antenna, so they must be lashuntas—turned as a group and trundled back the way they’d come.</p> 
                <p>Once Zemir was sure they were out of earshot, he stopped whining.</p> 
                <p>Obozaya chuckled. “Not how I’d have handled it, but effective. But aren’t you worried word will get out that you‘re broke, and merchants will refuse to talk to you?”</p> 
                <p>Zemir shrugged. “If we needed high-end or custom goods that you can only buy with an appointment, maybe. All we need are more filter masks. When we show the paramilitary surplus dealer our credits, he won’t care about rumors.”</p> 
                <p>Obozaya seemed satisfied, and began making her way toward the surplus shop again. “That taken care of... what was the second reason you’re not using your environmental seals?”</p> 
                <p>Zemir’s mask kept his predatory grin from being obvious, but his eyes did sparkle.</p> 
                <p>“I want to know this miasma well enough that I can grab a cloud of it from another iteration of reality. If I ever need to flood a room with it, anyone unfamiliar with the stench is in for quite the shock.”</p>

                <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, March 22, 4:30 p.m.</h2> 
                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> 
                </ul>

                <p>New from Jason Keeley, the Sanjaval Palanquin is a long-haul passenger transport freighter. It could be the setting of many adventures for Pact Worlders and Starfinder homebrewers of all stripes.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“Sanjaval Spaceflight Systems produces the Palanquin model of heavy freighter for a variety of transport applications, but it’s often converted into a long-distance high-quality passenger conveyance for regularly traveled space lanes. The Palanquin’s several decks provide enough room for spacious guest accommodations, which are far enough away from crew quarters that the two groups don’t need to mingle in the corridors. With two cargo holds standard, the Palanquin serves as a capable freighter for those passengers who are transporting valuable goods to far-off reaches.”</p>

                <blockquote> 
                 <p><i>“You want to know why you’re here? Imagine you’re a brain, yeah? But no eyes, no ears, just sittin’ warm and cozy in your skull with nothin’ but imagination and pixie sparkles to keep your attention. You’d never need to see how mean the real world is. How it can chew you up and spit you out. That’s great for some. But me? If something is about to go pear-shaped, I want to know. I like to see the bullet coming. And that’s what we do, kid. We’re not soldiers. We’re not heroes. We watch and we listen, and when we see the bullet coming, we tell the brain when to get out of the damn way.”<br> —Donlaia Sekk on Training Day 001</i></p> 
                 <p>Subterfuge is the exacting scalpel to warfare’s indiscriminate shrapnel. And in a galaxy where superweapons can wipe out entire planets, a careful hand is infinitely more useful for achieving practical goals. Even the most noteworthy interstellar conflict in recent memory— the war between the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds—lasted only 5 years before both sides shuddered at the mounting cost and devastation of open conflict. But the so-called Silent War— focused mainly on smaller skirmishes and espionage—lasted ten generations, as dedicated spies and agents on both sides faced off to uncover the other power’s secrets, sabotage their efforts, and sway the direction of their politics.</p> 
                 <p>Espionage encompasses a number of tactics. A nation conquered by placing loyal entities on its throne without a drop of spilled blood can immediately turn its engines of commerce to fill your pockets. Quietly bribed researchers can grant you access to scientific knowledge. Magical scrying sensors can overhear state secrets. Deep cover agents can live among the enemy populace for years and find work within government and security organizations. The ultimate goal of espionage is to take what your foe can’t afford to lose— knowledge, resources, loyalty from their populace, or the lives of key figures—while knowing exactly how they will respond.</p>

                <p>Catch a glimpse of Gadravel, a planet of war-torn ruins and ghosts, by Erik Mona.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“By the time explorers affiliated with the Pact Worlds first came across the lonely, haunted planet of Gadravel on the frontier of Near Space, it was already an ancient graveyard. The trench-like scars across Gadravel, visible from space, hint at an ancient destruction wreaked by some unknown force or super weapon that also wiped out every living thing on the planet. In the decades since its rediscovery, the unquiet spirits of Gadravel’s slaughtered populace have swallowed a dozen scientific research expeditions and countless opportunists and explorers. Scavengers come in search of forgotten technology or unclaimed plunder, while pirates seek refuge among the silent streets of abandoned cities, hoping to shake off pursuit by bounty hunters. Those who alight on the planet’s surface and leave within an hour or two often escape with fantastic riches and intriguing components of baffling alien technology. Those who linger too long are devoured by the ghosts and remain on the planet for a torturous eternity.”</p>

                 <p><i>“Marrax and I noticed the smears of blood on the floor right away. They seemed to form some kind of pattern or maybe words in a language I never seen before. Someone stepped forth from the shadows. It looked like Professor Ko, but her clothes were tattered and there was some kind of symbol carved into her chest. She shuffled forward and grabbed Marrax and slashed at his shirt with long nails. I panicked and ran out of there. But Marrax’s wounds began to shift and glow, and it was like he was moving through tar... I’m sorry, I left him screaming in the dark.”<br> —Report from Lonthis Vens, janitor at Qabarat University of Xenoarcheology and Xenoanthropology”</i></p>

                <p>Which brings me to what organized play is doing. Staff are practicing hygiene and social distancing techniques. We suspended travel to events through the end of May, which caused us to withdraw from a number of conventions. Paizo leadership is looking at PaizoCon and evaluating options. Many of the conventions we withdrew from have now cancelled or postponed their events and others are following suite. The Washington state government banned gatherings over 250 people. This is the first governmental restriction in the US, but I don’t expect it to be the last. Europeans in many countries have limited travel and some are in lockdown status. I expect directives from other nations as well as we all step in to combat the spread of the virus.</p> 
                <p>What does this mean for our players and the communities that support the events? Fortunately for us, several years ago we established an online region under the direction of regional venture-coordinator Jesse Davis. We are working closely with Jesse and the online team to look at moving physical games to online space. We ask that any GM willing to run online games let their local coordinators know. We are still processing event support for those events that have not cancelled. We ask organizers to drop us a line to update their event status at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                <p>These are trying times and we appreciate our communities stepping up and doing their part to limit the spread of the virus. We thank you for your assistance and will let you know more when we have the information.</p> 
                <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

                <p></p> 
                <p>Previously, in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh4q?The-Greatest-Show-on-Golarion">The Greatest Show on Golarion</a><a></a>, we took a look inside volume one of the Extinction Curse Adventure Path. Now we charge ahead to volume two!</p> 
                <p><i>Legacy of the Lost God</i> is a Pathfinder adventure written by Jenny Jarzabski for four 5th-level characters. This adventure continues the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, a six-part, monthly campaign in which the heroes lead a traveling circus as they unravel a plot to eradicate all life from the islands of the Inner Sea. This adventure also includes information about catfolk of Golarion and the villainous xulgaths, as well as new monsters and circus-themed rules.</p>

The heroes must confront foul forces in a buried temple to learn more about the looming threat facing the Starstone Isles. Their investigations put the heroes on a collision course with their circus’s greatest rival: the cruel catfolk Mistress Dusklight, ringmaster of the Celestial Menagerie! The Extinction Curse Adventure Path continues with “Legacy of the Lost God,” a complete adventure for 5th- to 8th-level characters.” </p>

                <p>Perhaps the most player-friendly lore in this volume is the <i>Catfolk of Golarion</i> article by David N. Ross.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“With many of the most prominent physical features of felines, catfolk make an impression virtually everywhere they are encountered—which is all over, considering their propensity for travel and adventure. In addition to catlike personality features such as curiosity and pride, they have a rich shared culture and often know much more about the situations they find themselves in than they let on. Indeed, the story of catfolk is a story of nobility and confidence, of wit and guile, and of exploration and friendship to the highest degree.</p> 
                 <p>While catfolk are well known for their strong sense of individuality, they share a number of common characteristics that differentiate them from other people of Golarion. They are almost universally curious, making them natural adventurers and voyagers as well as scholars and researchers. Many are gregarious and talkative—social traits reinforced by upbringings that emphasize strong bonds with close friends, whom catfolk refer to as their found kin. They are equally at home in cities as well as in the wild, though their tendency to inadvertently meddle in others’ affairs sometimes pushes them to the fringes of non-catfolk societies, where they socialize with similarly capricious people such as tengus and kitsunes.”</p> 
                </blockquote>

                <p>Going deeper, some Game Masters who don’t intend to run this Adventure Path might want to adapt or adopt this troglodyte lore for their campaign. Enjoy this excerpt from <i>Among The Xulgaths</i> by Andrew Mullen.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“None of Golarion’s Darklands denizens are as prolific— or as underestimated—as xulgaths. Called troglodytes by the surface‐dwellers who see them as little more than foul‐smelling brutes, these lizard‐like humanoids once ruled a vast empire beneath Golarion’s surface during the Age of Legends, and powerful xulgath psychic leaders commanded legions of formidable warriors amid grand obsidian temples and stone ziggurats. Now, xulgath civilization—if it can even be called that—exists in disparate fragments spread throughout the Darklands and in the dark corners of the world’s outer crust, and craven groups of scavengers, backstabbers, and cannibals fight among themselves for control of petty caverns and scraps of food.</p> 
                 <p>Ancient xulgath civilization spread from a massive subterranean vault called Vask, in the deepest layer of the Darklands, Orv. In the time of xulgath dominance, Vask was filled with lush vegetation and kept safe from the Darklands’ ambient radioactive energies by the nurturing glow of six mysterious orbs known as "cavern hearts." Beneath this quickening luminescence, the xulgaths thrived, establishing large communities around mysterious stepped pyramids. Impressive aqueducts, fungus farms, and vermin ranches supported the xulgaths’ orderly—if bloody— society as it spread throughout the vault.”</p> 
                </blockquote>

                <p>Now for the crunch! The <i>Adventure Toolbox</i> by Stephen Glicker, Luis Loza, Ron Lundeen, and Andrew Mullen includes 14 circus magic items, the animal trainer archetype, four circus spells, and nine uncommon monsters. You will find aberrations, animals, fey, undead—including the new visitant template. Finally, there are three unique, detailed creatures. All of these new materials can be dropped into your Age of Lost Omens or homebrew games..</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Rock rained near New Valor.</p> 
                <p>With a twist of the wheel, Zurkrishu maneuvered the hover tank out of the largest boulder’s path before drifting back onto their collision course with the colossal kyokor as Renz kept firing the main autocannon. “Stay with me, Renz,” Zurkrishu admonished over her shoulder as Renz’s tracer rounds veered off target. “We only got this one chance, yeah? Let’s do it for Daimalko!” Still hundreds of feet off, the kyokor lunged toward another vehicle, snatching and crumpling it in a single motion as its occupants rained haplessly back to the ground. As Renz’s explosive shells hit home, the kyokor hurled the wreckage at their hover tank, striking it straight on and flipping it end over end. </p> 
                <p>Time slowed. Zurkrishu went flying, her hand outstretched toward Renz as she cried out “Captain!”</p> 
                <p>Captain? In that frozen moment, Renz looked down at their sleeve. No, they were a sergeant, weren’t they?</p> 
                <p>“Captain!”</p> 
                <p>Something wasn’t right. The kyokor’s roar was fading into dull static as Renz tumbled through the air.</p> 
                <p>“Captain?”</p> 
                <p>Renz blinked awake. Their sheets were tangled like so much wreckage, and the only light came from an unblinking featureless face projected on their wall monitor.</p> 
                <p>“Captain, there’s an incident,” Stilchee announced patiently. The embri’s mask hid her emotions admirably, yet Renz could detect a hint of silent judgment. “You’re needed on the bridge.”</p> 
                <p>“An incident?” Renz quipped while rolling off their bed in a vain search for trousers. “If they’re fighting again, just break ’em up.”</p> 
                <p>“I assure you, Flowers and Esh are on their best behavior. I respect your non-Pact Standard sleep cycle enough not to disturb you unless it’s important.” Stilchee paused before adding, “We have unexpected company.”</p> 
                <p>Renz swore quietly all the way to the bridge, idly rubbing the Daimalkan military insignia on their jacket. For decades, the Veskarium had subjugated the planet Landahl and its peaceful illyr inhabitants, provoking a guerrilla war that the illyrs were slowly losing. Not wanting to provoke another Silent War, the Pact Worlds had stayed out of the unjust annexation, but sympathizers with deep pockets still supplied the illyrs where they could. It was just such a smuggling run that Renz had accepted, sneaking ordnance to the rebels.</p> 
                <p>As Renz arrived, Esh reflexively stood and saluted, the hobgoblin’s military upbringing taking over before he sheepishly returned to his seat. The ghoran behind him smirked before Esh chidingly swatted them, ruffling the ghoran’s fern-top undercut. “All right, business time. What’s happening?” Renz demanded.</p> 
                <p>Stilchee maintained eye contact as she turned on the main viewscreen, displaying a fleet of Veskarium warships.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>“What the Hell’s with this welcoming party?” Renz demanded. “All reports described light patrols, not a blockade!”</p> 
                <p>“Kinda wish we were being paid more for the run, huh Renz?” quipped Flowers, their sarcasm belied by their nervously gripping the starship’s controls.</p> 
                <p>“Hey, it’s a good cause, alright?” Renz shot back before looking to his embri science officer. “Stilchee, our cover’s still in order, right?”</p> 
                <p>“Aye, captain.” The alien mollusk bobbed her mask as her claws tapped away. “Our hold remains shielded, and our documentation still insists we’re shipping scientific instruments and other supplies to the Obedurn Associates research colony, a neutral entity. I worry more that their flagship has begun scanning us aggressively.”</p> 
                <p>“Your countermeasures holding up, though? Good.” Renz shook out their shoulders, checked their mutton chops, and ran a hand through their hair. “Patch me through to our new friends, and I’ll clear up this misunderstanding before they dig too deep.”</p> 
                <p>Stilchee tapped away diligently as Flowers mockingly mouthed “nu-nu-friends” and pantomimed a dancing skittermander to Esh in an attempt at levity. The ghoran snapped back to the controls when the screen suddenly displayed a massive Veskarian starship’s bridge filled with dozens of vesk officers. Before them loomed their leader, a vesk in overplate armor, her fuchsia-and-green scales bristling with confidence. “Attend, and identify yourself,” she boomed, her vesk second-in-command stepping into view at her side.</p> 
                <p>“Glory to you.” Renz inclined their head slightly in respect. “I am Renz, captain of the <i>Zurkrishin</i>. We’re bound for Landahl carrying food, clothing, and scientific instruments for Obedurn Associates. What earns us this welcome?”</p> 
                <p>“You stand before Wing Commander Tolskamash of the Army of the Veskarium, Thrice-Tested Conqueror of Persam-6 and commanding officer of the <i>Scorchrazor</i>. I trust you understand commerce to Landahl is tightly restricted?” </p>
                <p>“Absolutely, wing commander.” Renz briefly glanced to Stilchee, who pointed insistently to her station’s display, indicating multiple ships were now scanning the <i>Zurkrishin</i>.</p> 
                <p>“Yet even so, you traffic in the name of rebel sympathizers?”</p> 
                <p>Renz stared back in disbelief. “Sympathizers, wing commander?”</p> 
                <p>The vesk’s first officer responded. “Sympathizers,” he intoned grimly. “They recently declared their support for the illyr resistance. Those who serve them are in violation of Veskarium law. Violators are to be eliminated with prejudice,” he added with a hungry grin.</p> 
                <p>“The Veskarium’s justice is not so cruel, sub-commander,” Tolskamash remarked calmly to her second without breaking her predatory menace.</p> 
                <p>“Then no doubt the captain would welcome a boarding party to search his starship,” amended the first officer.</p> 
                <p>“They/them, thank you!” snapped Flowers from the pilot’s chair, interrupting the vesk’s interrogation.</p> 
                <p>“They/Th—?” Wing Commander Tolskamash blinked, quirked her head, and studied Renz before straightening and raking three claws over her breastplate in display of the god Damoritosh’s doshko blade, nudging her second to do the same. “My subordinate and I were mistaken and meant no disrespect,” she apologized while struggling to regain her earlier momentum. “The captain, ah, they would certainly—"</p> 
                <p>“It’s an honest mistake, please,” Renz interrupted with a casual wave before adding, “But I believe it’s not the only honest mistake at hand—we’re simple teamsters given bad information. My crew will send you our manifest imminently, and we can forget about these misunderstandings. Hold, please.” Stilchee cut the transmission as the off-balance vesk struggled to respond.</p> 
                <p>Renz furiously scratched their mutton chops before Flowers began another round of gallows humor. “Hey, hey!” Renz snapped. “News doesn’t travel any faster through the Drift than we do, okay? It’s just bad timing. We can talk our way out.”</p> 
                <p>“We don’t have long to talk, captain,” Stilchee reported, pointing to her screens. Alerts silently popped up every few seconds, signaling that each of the vesk ships was scanning them. Their cover was slipping as surely as Stilchee’s masked emotions, and Renz could hear the restrained fear building in her voice as she more quietly counseled: “Just because you named the ship after a colossus hunter doesn’t mean it can take on that many goliaths.”</p> 
                <p>“That, ah, might not be true,” countered Esh, pantomiming finger-guns to emphasize his point. “At this rate, they won’t just find our illyr shipments.”</p> 
                <p>Renz scowled. “And why would our starship’s basic armaments upset the vesk?”</p> 
                <p>“What are a few lasers between friends?” The hobgoblin flicked at his own screens and added, “But when we were doing maintenance last, I gave our systems a little, ah, upgrade that might spook their sensors.”</p> 
                <p>“Like what?”</p> 
                <p>Esh’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Little something we called ‘Gideron Gold’ back in the home system.”</p> 
                <p>“Gider—" Flowers visibly wilted. “We’re packing nukes?!?”</p> 
                <p>“Hey, you de-stress with spa days, I de-stress by knowing we’re packing real heat!”</p> 
                <p>“Damn, you Authority types don’t mess around.” Flowers cracked their knuckles. “That changes the odds just a little.”</p> 
                <p>Esh gave the ghoran a playful shove, “Well look who bloomed and grew some stamens!”</p> 
                <p>“Irrelevant!” Stilchee chided while furiously reconfiguring their starship’s signatures to foil the vesk scanners. “Captain, we have perhaps a few minutes before they see through our cover. We need a plan.”</p> 
                <p>Renz quickly reviewed the armament specs before responding. “Typically vesk. This isn’t a patrol fleet, but one designed to make an example, just like they’re doing to the illyrs. Whether we let them on board or just wait long enough for them to scan us, they’re going to learn just how much ordnance we’re packing.” They glowered out the window while idly rubbing their jacket’s insignia. “But when it comes to dealing with colossi, I like to think there’s an Option 3.”</p> 
                <p>The embri deflated slightly. “By your tone, captain, I’m sensing that last option is not ‘retreat?’”</p> 
                <p>“You can bet your best mask it ain’t,” Renz declared dangerously. “Didn’t you hear me earlier? I promised the good wing commander a full inventory—and that means declaring every rocket, bullet, and beam we’re packing.”</p> 
                <p>Esh cackled and rubbed his hands in anticipation before turning to the starship’s targeting computers. “Permission to send those scaleys the first line item?”</p> 
                <p>Renz nodded. “Shields up, Stilchee. Flowers, take the first opening through this blockade. Esh, light ’em up with whatever you’ve been bragging about. We’ve only got this one shot, yeah?” they encouraged, tapping the Daimalkan insignia once more, their face briefly lit by the saffron glow of Esh’s torpedoes silently screaming toward their targets. “This time, we do it for Landahl.”</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">The galaxy of the Starfinder RPG expands with this month’s release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space"><i>Starfinder Near Space</i></a>, which details dozens of planets and civilizations in this region of the galaxy and includes new starships and a wide selection of character option as well.</p> 
                <p>Among the many worlds located within Near Space are not only the allied planets of the Pact Worlds, but also the core worlds of the Veskarium, the interplanetary empire of the warlike vesk. While vesk are a relatively common sight in the Pact Worlds and throughout the galaxy, their home system has remained something of a mystery. But no longer! Starfinder Near Space takes us into the Veskarium for the first time, so let’s take a brief look at the vesk empire and its diverse worlds.</p> 
                <h2>The Veskarium</h2> 
                <p>Centered around a blue sun called Ghavaniska, the Veskarium is an autocratic empire and military dictatorship with one overarching goal: conquest. Long before the onset of the Gap, the vesk conquered all of the planets of their home system, renaming these worlds after themselves and numbering them in order of their distance from the sun. When the Gap ended, the vesk turned to their well-organized pre-Gap military archives and set about relearning the boundaries of their ancient empire and re-establishing the Veskarium’s dominion over their subject worlds in less than a decade. Vesk dominate the empire and make up the majority of its inhabitants, but the Veskarium encompasses dozens of planets, and their native inhabitants enjoy full citizenship in the empire. Vesk believe they have an obligation to care for their conquered vassals, and while the Veskarium’s laws are strict and draconian, standards of living are high, and most residents of the empire, vesk or not, are content with their lives and support—or at least tolerate—their government.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/030520_Veskarium.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/030520_Veskarium.jpg" width="100%"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                </div> 
                <h3>Vesk Prime</h3> 
                <p>The closest planet to the sun, Vesk Prime is the vesk home world and the imperial capital of the Veskarium. It is the most densely populated world in the empire, with large, modern cities—like the sprawling metropolis and vast military installation Command Prime—surrounded by huge tracts of cultivated lands and wilderness reserves. Under the leadership of High Despot Vindaskayo Swarmripper, Vesk Prime remains the center of the empire, both politically and culturally. The Veskarium originated here in ages past, when the vesk defeated the other native sapient species of their home world, the caiagaras and the skeraskens, and first proclaimed their empire before expanding to the other worlds of the Ghavaniska system.</p> 
                <h3>Vesk-2</h3> 
                <p>Ghavaniska’s second planet, a calm, watery world with a shallow, salty ocean covering much of its surface, was the Veskarium’s first extraplanetary conquest. The squid-like ijtikris are native to Vesk-2, and after centuries of vesk rule, they are highly integrated into Veskarium society. Strange, ancient ruins that predate ijtikri culture dot the scattered islands of Vesk-2 and are an enduring mystery on the planet, hinting at the possibility of another sapient species that inhabited the world in the distant past. Ijtikris have an instinctive aversion to these sites, but vesk have no such compunctions and have explored many of them. The flooded swamp-forests of Vesk-2 are also a center of domesticated defrex ranching in the Veskarium.</p> 
                <h3>Vesk-3</h3> 
                <p>A garden world with expansive forests, abundant nutrients from constant volcanic activity, and warm, shallow oceans, Vesk-3 is saturated in a constant, rainy spring. Ostensibly a paradise, Vesk-3 remains one of the Veskarium’s most difficult planets to rule, thanks to its indigenous population of ever-helpful skittermanders. Although they far outnumber their vesk overlords, skittermanders generally don’t seem to understand the significance of their conquest. Their obsequious nature grates on the practical-minded vesk, who commonly joke that skittermanders will eagerly “help” tear down your engine unless you eat them, and even then they’ll stick around and help chew your food. As a result, vesk presence on the planet is mostly confined to one of the planet’s two primary continents, leaving skittermanders largely autonomous in their native lands.</p> 
                <h3>Vesk-4</h3> 
                <p>Nicknamed “the Glutton” by early vesk conquerors for its tendency to pull celestial bodies—such as its own moons—into its powerful gravitational field, Vesk-4 is a dense planet with a single landmass teeming with lush jungles, sodden swamplands, and volcanic mountain ranges. Home to an indigenous species of sapient mole‑like creatures called talphi, Vesk-4 is an important hub for mining useful minerals, left behind by millennia of meteorites crashing into the planet. Recently, however, the Veskarium has begun harvesting crystals that can be refined to power solarian weapons, and Vesk-4 now supports an academy specializing in training solarians. Life on Vesk‑4 is generally difficult. Citizens lead austere, regimented lives focused on labor and service, and seismic activity, radiation, and frequent meteorite collisions constantly threaten settlements.</p> 
                <h3>Vesk-5</h3> 
                <p>Encircled by bands of red and purple gases, Vesk-5 is the largest planet and the only gas giant in the Ghavaniska system. The planet’s atmosphere surges with powerful lightning storms and pounding hydrogen rain, and its dense, unstable core constantly ejects valuable ore that the Veskarium monopolizes. Nevertheless, daring adventurers called stormrunners dodge military patrol craft and brave Vesk-5’s dangerous atmosphere to “mine” these profitable minerals using gigantic energy nets deployed from their ships, causing the Veskarium to brand them outlaws—a label that many stormrunners adopt as a badge of honor. Vesk-5’s only native sapient species, formians, reside in orbiting hives in the planet’s small, rocky ring system, and most other inhabitants live on the gas giant’s largest moons.</p> 
                <h3>Vesk-6</h3> 
                <p>Though distant from the sun, Vesk-6 is an inexplicably warm jungle world with relatively low gravity, towering trees, gigantic insects, and other titanic flora and fauna that struggle ruthlessly with one another to survive. A powerful magnetosphere helps the planet retain its atmosphere, but the magnetic winds it generates devastate many forms of technology, with the result that Vesk-6’s surface remains mostly untamed. The planet’s dominant sapient species, the catlike pahtras, initially resisted the vesk invasion, but they were eventually conquered and incorporated into the Veskarium. Most pahtra nation-states signed treaties with the Veskarium that grant them an unusual amount of autonomy, but some groups of pahtra guerillas continue to battle vesk peacekeepers for the liberation of their home world.</p> 
                <h3>Vesk-7 and Vesk-8</h3> 
                <p>The distant, icy worlds of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 are the outermost planets of the Ghavaniska system, and a posting to either of them is usually a punishment for dishonored vesk or those exiled for controversial or troublesome political views. The two worlds share virtually the same orbit, though Vesk-7’s orbit is retrograde, and twice each planetary year, the planets’ shared moon, Traverse, transfers its orbit from one world to the other. Magical gates linking the planets and their moon activate at these times, allowing the native kothamas of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 to travel between them. Vesk-7 hosts a small, nominally independent city of people who want to leave their pasts behind them, while Vesk-8 holds a penal colony established to mine the planet’s valuable shimmerstone deposits.</p> 
                <h3>Conqueror’s Forge</h3> 
                <p>Initially constructed to address a perceived technological gap between the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds, this massive space platform and shipyard—with a distinctive silhouette reminiscent of a doshko—has the full status of one of the Veskarium’s core worlds, with its own high despot in command. Equipped with banks of mighty thrusters (and even a powerful Drift engine, if rumors are to be believed), Conqueror’s Forge travels throughout Veskarium space, collecting resources for research and production, manufacturing weapons and starships for the Veskarium’s military, and selling its technological developments to other species to fund additional research. One section of the station, officially denied by the Veskarium government and known only by the codename Vesk-9, is devoted to confidential research, advanced experimentation, and other secret projects that remain classified to all but those with the highest security clearances.</p> 
                <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this glimpse of the worlds and peoples of the Veskarium. If you’d like to learn more about the Veskarium (or other Near Space cultures), pick up a copy of Starfinder Near Space and keep your sensors locked on the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog">Paizo blog</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Paizo’s Twitch stream</a> for more previews and behind-the-scenes details of Near Space and Starfinder!</p>

                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                <p>For those wanting to game but not wanting to gather in public places, the Online Community, led by Regional Venture-Coordinator Jesse Davis, have a full roster of virtual tabletop and play-by-post games. For more information or to register for games, visit the Org Play Online discord channel.</p> 
                <p>A quick update on our tech backlog. I’ve been poking around the system (you may have seen some of my efforts) and have pieces in place as soon as we can get the user-interface complete and through quality assurance. This includes updates to 0 table Starfinder GMs and erroneous AcP numbers. Will update again when we have a firmer rollout date.</p> 
                <h2>Welcome Alex</h2> 
                <p>I asked Alex to write a few words of introduction to share with you!</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>Hi nufriends! I’m Alex Speidel, the new Organized Play Associate (read: Tonya’s minion). Our Venture Officers are already well-acquainted with me, as I’ve been sending them everything they’ve asked for over the past few weeks.</p> 
                 <p>I’ve been playing Starfinder since its release in 2017; I’m here for the “roleplaying” part of the roleplaying game, and I think it’s a great universe to explore. When I’m not in the Pact Worlds, I’m watching reality TV at home, reading sci-fi and fantasy, or getting ice cream with my future husband. Moving to Seattle is a great chance for us to get out and explore the beauty out here, and I’m excited to come out to conventions and meet you all! If you like to make bad decisions, you can follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexSpeidel" target="_blank">@AlexSpeidel</a>.</p>

                <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>Developer James Case led the charge on getting the next bit of sanctioning through the door for Pathfinder Society (second edition). We updated the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options#discuss"></a> with information from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide"><i>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</i></a> and a few other clarification bits.</p> 
                <p>We still have Pathfinder (first edition) sanctioning in the hopper but had a few setbacks that mean a bit longer delay, as we ensure scenarios move through the production line and look to our convention season deadlines. Thank you for your patience. </p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>We awarded no coins during the past month.</p> 
                <h2>Stars, Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>One GM reached their 5th star in December. We still have a few weeks in 2019 for those trying to earn their 5th star before the year’s end. Doing so indicates a commitment to organized play, as to achieve this milestone, GMs must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! </p> 
                <p>Congratulations to <b>Michael Owen Hill</b> and <b>Betty Osthoff</b> on achieving their 5th star!</p> 
                <p>We had no GMs reach their 5th Nova this month.</p> 
                <p>Glyphs exist in our system and they just need a bit of webcoding to get them to show up!</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>You can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes all submissions as of 3 March. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information! </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">It never failed to amaze Devi, coming out of Drift. The sensation, visual and mental, of time and space returning to their normal flow, of planets, stars, and the black expanding to their normal size. The tiny feeling of relief that he’d made it through.</p> 
                <p>Devi’s route through the Drift had taken just under three days. Even though it was quite rare for Drift voyages that short to encounter disaster, ships traveling in Near Space still occasionally disappeared. Triune’s miraculous space highway had done wonders for the Pact Worlds, opening new planets and cultures for all, but using it wasn’t without risk. During his trip, he’d seen swirling black holes, ancient debris from long-wrecked spaceships, and the far-off silhouettes of creatures with more eyes and tentacles than he could count, but nothing directly threatened his ship and making it safely still felt especially good.</p> 
                <p>He piloted a heavily modified Ringworks Wanderer he’d gotten for an amazing deal at an underground auction in an off-the-grid port in Akiton. Devi had asked no questions and the ysoki auction runner had named no names. Devi liked to think there was honor among the same species, but even so, he’d personally gone over the ship to make sure there were no problems and after installing a custom Drift engine and new pilot controls to fit his height, the <i>Winding Jaunt</i> was fit for interstellar travel. She could hold a crew of three—her ideal crew size—but Devi could never seem to hold onto crewmates. That’s probably why he hadn’t yet risen high in the Starfinder Society. After life in an overstuffed warren under the eyes of innumerable relatives, he liked traveling alone. It was better that way, out in the black with nothing but his thoughts and the far-off stars. </p> 
                <p>The <i>Winding Jaunt</i> drew closer to her destination, the orange and purple-tinged planet growing larger on the front display screen. An unexplored planet around a yellow sun, one of the few that could support organic life. One of countless worlds on the edges of Near Space, just outside the unknown edges of the Vast. Devi had listened to a crusty vesk spacer talking about its coordinates while he’d been in port buying supplies to send back to the warren weeks ago.</p> 
                <p>Devi was glad he’d followed up on the pirate’s drunken boasts. There the planet was, sure as daylight. And if the readings Devi was getting were any indication, this world was filled with all kinds of biodiverse lifeforms. Large bodies of water. Breathable atmosphere, too, at least with the right adjustments to his suit. Some heavy thaumic surges, but an overall stable reality field. This could be his ticket to promotion in the Starfinder Society, crew or not. </p> 
                <p>As the <i>Jaunt</i> entered atmo, Devi initiated the ship’s landing sequence and set the computer scanners to find a suitable landing zone—a clear field near a forest, but with enough sightlines that he’d see anything overtly dangerous approaching his ship and have enough time to respond. After reviewing scans of several possibilities, Devi chose an open clearing near a lightly wooded area, just a couple of clicks from one of the planet’s oceans. </p> 
                <p>The <i>Jaunt</i> descended, adjusting its pressure, wards, and shielding so the vessel wouldn’t burn up as it let gravity do some of the ship’s work. Devi used the next hour to review his own supplies. Enough food and water for a few weeks. His weapons and armor were primed and charged, his AI ocular implant set to record and catalog all new forms of life he came across. He even had some trinkets, coins, and other useful items should he come across any sapient species looking to trade. Though that seemed unlikely. So far, the ship’s scanners had detected no trace of technology or sentient-made shelters. With a final push from its thrusters, the ship landed in its chosen clearing and made a scan of the perimeter. </p> 
                <p>“So far, so good,” Devi murmured to himself and his AI. This was one of his favorite parts. The moment before stepping outside into the unknown. A chance to learn new things, discover key mysteries of the universe. It was like a fine wine or cheese, to be savored for as long as possible. </p>

                </div> 
                <p>Devi lowered himself from the ships platform and took a step out into a whole new world. It was more wonderous than he’d allowed himself to imagine. Purple and orange light filled a lush, open forest, covered with vegetation that—at least according to his AI—were not catalogued in the Society’s archives. He could hear far off grunts and screeches, reminding him of birdsong or mammalian apes. The ground felt solid. The atmosphere, with a few minor adjustments, tasted sweet.</p> 
                <p>The planet was beautiful. Pristine and untouched. He must do his best to keep it so during his exploration. He began to walk toward the trees. It wasn’t long before he encountered his first new species. His AI ran through its database and could find no matches. It bore some similarities to various types of gecko, but it carried its young in a pouch, an adaptation usually reserved for mammalian life.</p> 
                <p>He watched in fascination as the lizard-like creature pulled a bulbous-looking fruit from a nearby branch and fed it to the young one in its front pouch. Though Devi had taken care to stay upwind from the creature, it must have heard his quiet footfalls in the grass, for the creature quickly turned to face him. </p> 
                <p>Fleshy pink antennae extended from either side of the creature’s head behind its large eyes and pointed themselves at him. Devi felt a presence in his mind. Although he had never experienced it before, it seemed similar to what he had learned about how telepathy and psychic magic worked. The message in his mind was primal, instinctual.</p> 
                <p><i>Prey / notprey? <br> Hunger / nothunger? <br> I-not-food. No-food-me. Look-other-place.</i></p> 
                <p>The last bit was accompanied by a gentle push on his mind. Devi had not been thinking of the fascinating creature as food, but felt sure that if he had been considering eating it, the influence from the creature may have convinced him, or at least a creature of lesser intelligence, to leave it alone. </p> 
                <p>“Instinctual telepathy,” muttered Devi to himself. Perhaps his own mind, or his AI, had translated the mental push into words. “Remarkable.”</p> 
                <p>The creature grew alarmed at his continued presence. Both antennae expanded.</p> 
                <p><i>Stepback.<br> Stepback<br> Stepback.</i></p> 
                <p>Without meaning to, Devi almost took a step back, only stopping himself mid-gesture as he realized the creature had pushed him to do so. Now the creature and its brood looked terrified. Devi tried to calm the creature with his own thoughts, but it only shifted its face quizzically</p> 
                <p><i>No-sky-thinker</i>, Devi heard back in his mind. After pondering this a moment, he realized sky meant above, higher-up, that the creature couldn’t parse his… words? He’d need to use something other than words to reassure it. </p> 
                <p>Devi was no xenodruid, who drew power and magic from the cycles of the natural world, though he’d heard stories of them while still a youngling in the warren. Kasathas debating philosophy with the animals of the forest. Elves disappearing into living trees and emerging from different trees half a world away. Nature priests living for a thousand years or more in an ongoing cycle of rebirth. What would they do, in this moment? </p> 
                <p>Closing his eyes, Devi tried to think in pictures. He thought of himself eating plants, of gently petting the creature. He thought of his den mothers in the warren, of safety, comfort, and a warm thermal blanket. When he opened his eyes, he saw that the creature had drawn closer to him, the muscles in its body less tense, the ridges on its back no longer standing erect. </p> 
                <p><i>Not-prey-not-death</i>, the creature emoted to its child in what felt like a happy croon. <i>Safe-friend</i>.</p> 
                <p>Devi nodded. The creature’s antennae retracted into the sides of its head and it wandered off, though not before brushing against Devi’s leg in friendship.</p> 
                <p>Overhead, several winged creatures zipped through the air, moving almost too fast for Devi to see them. Luckily, his AI recorded them through his ocular implant, so he could review the footage later at his leisure. Right now, Devi was more interested in the giant megafauna he saw sipping water from a nearby stream.</p> 
                <p>Fascinated, he stealthily approached the herd, continuing to record footage through his ocular implant. Their thick hides were dark blue and green, with long tentacles slowly undulating out from their maws and necks. The large creatures took slow gentle sips from the lake they’d gathered around, some pausing to munch on the green grass at their feet. Slow, calm, not too bright. They seemed like peaceable herbivores, so Devi sent a command to his AI to scan them more thoroughly and record all the data. It was something of a surprise when the herd all raised their tentacles, the air about them rippled like water, and the creatures vanished before his eyes. </p> 
                <p>Devi studied the edges of the lake for some trace of the creatures. It wasn’t until he heard ground-shaking footsteps behind him that he looked over his shoulder. There the megafauna stood, regarding him with strange, solemn eyes. Devi backed away slowly, keeping his eyes on them, but his arms spread wide to show he was no threat. </p> 
                <p>Had they teleported? There was no sign of such magic. But… he checked his AI’s chronometer to find it was acting strangely. He looked at the ground where the creatures had stood. No foot prints. No recently eaten bare patches in the tall grass. </p> 
                <p>Had they… but that was… Devi almost thought <i>impossible</i>, but then he remembered all the wonders he’d heard about when joining the Starfinders. Nothing out near the Vast was impossible. Only undiscovered. </p> 
                <p>If these readings were right, then it hadn’t been his imagination. The creatures had apparently traveled back in time, just several seconds, in only their individual timelines, to the point before they’d reached the lake, just so they could see if he was a threat. Perhaps their tentacles were somehow able to unravel the quantum threads of localized time…</p> 
                <p>Instinctive, short-range time travel as a natural defense. The Society wouldn’t believe this. The possibilities were staggering. He wondered how far back their range went. Seconds? Minutes? If technomancers were able to synthesize how the creatures could achieve this affect…</p> 
                <p>The sun began to set beyond the far-off amber sea by the time he finished noting all he could about the creatures. Daylight passed quickly on this world, it seemed. Devi knew it was time to get back to the <i>Jaunt</i>. Two giant moons began to glow in the lavender twilight above. Devi would have to take notes and study just how they affected the sea’s tides, or if they pulled at the planet’s natural magical and life forces. </p> 
                <p>Back in his ship, Devi powered up the defensive shields and settled into his bunk. He thought about all he’d seen today. His findings would get him several accommodations. This planet was a wonder—and still in Near Space for all that! And its native life! These creatures had adapted to escape and survive in such astounding ways. Instinctual telepathy and short-range temporal travel. It just showed how amazing evolution was.</p> 
                <p>Only as he started to drowse off to the night-sounds outside the ship did the question occur. </p> 
                <p>Just what had they evolved to escape from?</p> 
                <p>For the first time since leaving the warren, Devi found himself wishing he had a crew. Wide awake now, he didn’t think he’d get much sleep tonight. Outside, the sun sank beneath the purple sea and darkness covered the planet. The wilderness grew quiet, as if waiting for something to emerge. </p>

                <h3>Badlands Ambush Moderate 3</h3> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>"Tasked with delivering vital supplies to an isolated outpost, you’ve been traveling through the rocky badlands of western Katapesh. Worried about attacks by bandits and other threats of the desert, your group has been traveling along a nearly dry riverbed to keep your profiles low."</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>The PCs aren’t alone on their trek. A lone gnoll hunter named Magorek has been out hunting with her trusted hyena for food to provide food for her band. Unfortunately for her, she picked up a couple of tag-alongs—a pair of mischievous pugwampis. Magorek isn’t pleased with the fawning gremlins following along, but she hadn’t run them off yet thinking that they might provide a useful edge in case she comes across any threats too big for her to handle. In her search for prey, Magorek stuck to the dry riverbed in hopes of finding game that came to the small stream to drink. </p> 
                <p><b>Creatures</b>: It’s here where Magorek hears the PCs footfalls echo down the rocky walls of the riverbed. She can’t yet see the PCs, but her keen survival skills let her know that there are more than just a couple people. Unsure if she can take the group, she quiets the bickering pugwampis and takes cover to hide. The PCs are unaware that they’re about to walk into an ambush.</p> 
                <p>Magorek stays hidden, waiting to see the PCs so she can size them up. Unafraid of the threat and certain she can take the PCs—and bring home meat to her fellow gnolls—Magorek attacks as soon as the PCs are within 40 feet. One of the pugwampis see her draw her bow and follow suit. When combat starts, the hyena rushes to the closest PC, savages them with its powerful jaws, and attempts to drag the character back to the gnoll. One of the pugwampis stays back with Magorek and fires at the PCs, while the other runs to the group sword drawn. If the hyena manages to successfully use its Drag action on a PC, Magorek drops her bow and engages the PCs in melee on her next turn. The toadying pugwampi, of course, follows. If Magorek is reduced to 10 Hit Points or fewer, she takes the time to drink one of her lesser healing potions (see Treasure below). If Magorek is reduced to 5 Hit Points or fewer, she shamefully attempts to flee, showing no concern for her companions.</p> <a href="http://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_GnollWarriorjpg.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_GnollWarriorjpg.jpg" alt="" width="50%/"></a>

                <p></p> 
                <p>Our series of blogs exploring the Extinction Curse Adventure Path includes <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh2k?Come-One-Come-All-to-the-Extinction-Curse">Come One, Come All, to the Extinction Curse Player’s Guide!</a>, the web flash fiction <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3l?Extinction-Curse-Waiting-in-the-Wings">Extinction Curse: Waiting in the Wing</a>s, and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3u?Extinction-Curse-Extravaganza">Extinction Curse Extravaganza!</a> Now, let’s start looking more deeply into what each volume adds to the Pathfinder Second Edition game. (I don’t see spoilers in this blog, but they are ahead, so proceed accordingly.) </p> 
                <p><i>The Show Must Go On</i> is a Pathfinder Second Edition adventure for four 1st-level characters. This adventure begins the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, a six-part, monthly campaign in which the heroes lead a traveling circus as they unravel a plot to eradicate all life from the Starstone Isles at the heart of the Inner Sea. The adventure also includes advice on how to run a traveling circus, new circus-themed rules, and a menagerie of monsters both wondrous and wicked.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_EC.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_EC.jpg" alt="" width="25%/"></a>

                <p>The free <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022ks?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Extinction-Curse-Players-Guide"><i>Extinction Curse Player’s Guide</i></a> by Ron Lundeen provided six new backgrounds—the aerialist, animal wrangler, barker, blow-in, butcher (not what you might think), circus-born, clown, mystic seer, and rigger. It also shared player-friendly lore on the isles of Erran and Kortos.</p> 
                <p>But a Pathfinder Adventure Path is more than just an exciting plot written by a collection of the best authors in the industry. It also includes new rules, stats, and support articles to give Game Masters additional material to expand their campaign. So let’s start to shine the spotlight on the backmatter from the Extinction Curse. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p>A circus can now be added to any Pathfinder game. You can start by using the <i>Life in the Circus</i> article by Patrick Renie. Here’s an excerpt:</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>“The smell of animals, incense, and burning pitch fills the air. Murmurs of excitement punctuate the dark, open space. From outside, silver light cast by a crescent moon slices through the tent’s entryway. Suddenly, music bursts in from all sides. The curtain rises, spotlights flood the ring in the middle of the tent, and a lone figure standing in the center spurs the crowd’s cacophonous applause. “Welcome, welcome!” the figure booms. “Welcome to the greatest show on Golarion!”</p> 
                 <p>At the start of this adventure, the PCs inherit the Circus of Wayward Wonders, and they’re thrust into the roles of showrunners in addition to their responsibilities as adventurers. Throughout the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, the PCs will travel all over the Isle of Erran and the Isle of Kortos, undertaking a grand adventure to save the land from an ancient evil. Thankfully, it’s not all dire omens and life-or-death circumstances—during their off time, the PCs can unwind by running a joyous circus where the worst case scenario is a comically clumsy show. To ensure their circus is a success, the PCs will need to promote, orchestrate, and execute fantastic shows in towns big and small.</p> 
                 <p>The rules in this article are designed to give the PCs agency over their circus and approximate the fun and responsibility of running a traveling troupe of entertainers. While intended for use throughout the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, the rules are flexible enough to be used in any campaign...”</p> 
                </blockquote>

                <p>Bring your circus to vivid life with a million dreams and the <i>Adventure Toolbox</i> by Andrew Mullen, Patrick Renie, David N. Ross, and Michael Sayre. This includes two new uncommon player archetypes—the juggler and staff acrobat, the juggle skill feat, five nature snares—like dust pods, seven circus weapons—like the scorpion whip, eight environment spells—like personal rain cloud, and new nine monsters. In fact, we can name a few of the monsters without spoilers—the bone croupier, flea, living graffiti, and luminous ooze—because they are not used in <i>The Show Must Go On</i>. There are also two unique foes that are fully detailed with two pages each. All of these new materials can be dropped into your Age of Lost Omens or homebrew games and are available in print or PDF.</p>

                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_Juggler.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_Juggler.jpg" alt="Illustration of a performer with the Juggler Archetype" width="35%/"></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_Acrobat.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_Acrobat.jpg" alt="Illustration of a performer with the Staff Acrobat Archetype" width="35%/"></a>
                 <p><b>Juggler Archetype</b> You’re a skilled performer, with impressive balance and coordination that help you greatly in battle. And the <b>Staff Acrobat Archetype</b> You can perform amazing acts in and out of combat when you have a spear, staff, or polearm.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>This is a good opportunity for a Pathfinder Second Edition vocabulary reminder from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>. Many of these new materials are uncommon—meaning available only to those who have special training, grew up in a certain culture, or come from a particular part of the world. As we just learned from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zq7?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide"><i>Gamemastery Guide</i></a>, “Uncommon elements are difficult to access, but a PC can usually find them eventually with enough effort, potentially by choosing a specific character option or spending substantial downtime tracking them down.”</p> 
                <p>We release Pathfinder Adventure Paths monthly in six-volume arcs, meaning each year sees the release of two complete Adventure Path campaigns. You can acquire them at your <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/locator">favorite local gaming store</a>. Or with your ongoing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy7xpn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Subscription">Pathfinder Adventure Path subscription</a>, we'll send you each new Pathfinder Adventure Path volume and charge your payment method automatically as we ship each product. You only need to sign up once, and never need to worry about renewal notice or missed products.</p> 
                <p>Next, we will look inside volume two, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zrd?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-152-Legacy-of-the-Lost-God"><i>Legacy of the Lost God</i></a>, with information about the catfolk of Golarion and the villainous xulgaths, as well as new monsters and circus-themed rules!</p>

                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
