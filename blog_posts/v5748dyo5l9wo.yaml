  date\">Tuesday, November 11, 2008</p> \n    <p>We have the best fans and readers\
  \ in the world.</p> \n    <p>Last year, our messageboard community, in their unique\
  \ and awesome way, declared November 8th to be Erik Mona Day to honor the hard work\
  \ the editorial staff (and the rest of Paizo) were putting into creating and producing\
  \ some of the best RPG projects in the industry (in my and their humble opinions).\
  \ To celebrate Erik Mona Day they pooled their money together and ordered us pizza.\
  \ We were, frankly, shocked and pleased at the audacity of our community as well\
  \ as their loyalty, frivolity, and downright friendly demeanor.</p> \n    <p>Not\
  \ to be outdone, the community celebrated Erik Mona Day last Friday and bought the\
  \ Paizo staff another delicious round of pizza. Seriously, guys and gals—thank you!\
  \ Everyone in the office appreciated the pizza and resoundingly destroyed it with\
  \ much chewing, digesting, and hilarity. We support Erik Mona Day being an annual\
  \ holiday and can only hope that we give back in some way for your thoughtful purchase\
  \ of yummy pizza pie.</p> \n    <p>Now the pictures!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n \

  \ year!</p> \n    <p>Also, as Paizo's resident veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces,\
  \ I'd like to thank, on behalf of everyone at Paizo, each and every member of our\
  \ community and fan base who currently serves or previously served in the military.\
  \ We know what you do can be hard and we know there are lots of you—stay safe, stay\
  \ sane, and thank you for your service.</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>Events\
