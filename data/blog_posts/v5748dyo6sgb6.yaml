  \     <p>For a Pathfinder Battles set called \"Kingmaker\", we certainly haven't\
  \ seen much in the way of kings, now have we? Well, this week's preview should address\
  \ that oversight.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">First, we have the Stag\
  \ Lord, a Medium uncommon figure, who is in charge of the Stolen Lands when the\
  \ PCs first arrive to settle the region. A sadistic and cruel bandit king, the Stag\
  \ Lord is the first major threat the Kingmakers must defeat before they can establish\
  \ their own barony in the River Kingdoms.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Humans aren't the only civilized creatures in the AP\
  \ who have hierarchies and rulers, however, and goblins, lizardfolk, kobolds, and\
  \ mites all have their own kings, queens, and chieftains the PCs must interact with.\
  \ Heck, even giants have their own rulers, such as the Frost Giant Jarl, a Large\
  \ rare figure perfect for recreating Amiri's <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5la16?Meet-the-Iconics-Amiri\"\
  >origin story</a>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-GiantJarl.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The players' only truly royal rival in the Kingmaker\
  \ Adventure Path is King Irovetti of the neighboring River Kingdom of Pitax, who\
  \ got his own figure in the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9iyh?Pathfinder-Battles-Rusty-Dragon-Inn-King-Irovetti\"\
  >Rusty Dragon Inn set a few years back</a>. Never one to fight his own battles if\
  \ he can avoid it, Irovetti has employed the services of the intimidating, heavily\
  \ armored Pitax Wardens to do his dirty work for him. The Pitax Warden is a Medium\
  \ common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-PitaxWarden.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>No ruler worth her salt leaves it up to chance to secure\
  \ her legacy, and no one is better suited for that task than Linzi, Halfling Bard,\
  \ this week's featured companion from the Pathfinder: Kingmaker CRPG, out now on\
  \ Steam and GOG! A Small uncommon figure, Linzi will be sure to offer her unique\
  \ take on the events in your kingdom, whether you like it or not.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20181009-Linzi.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But what good is a king without a throne? The barbarian\
  \ throne and raised dais, based on this iconic illustration from the Beyond Kingmaker\
  \ article back in Pathfinder AP #36, are packaged individually as bonus set dressing,\
  \ but were intended to work together. The throne fits most Medium figures (at least\
  \ standing on its seat, but who's going to tell the king he has to sit?) and the\
  \ dais can sport any number of set dressings at its apex, from the depicted throne\
  \ to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9puv?Pathfinder-Battles-Deadly-Foes-Book-of-the-Damned\"\
  ><em>Book of the Damned</em></a> or any number of pieces from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8l?Pathfinder-Battles-Crown-of-Fangs-Court-of-the-Crimson-Throne\"\
  ><em>Court of the Crimson Throne</em></a> premium set. The dais has a flat cobblestone\
  \ surface on the bottom as well, so even if you don't have something you want to\
  \ put on the red carpeted top side, you can flip it over and have a weird stone\
  \ table or platform for some ritual or elaborate trap or whatever other inventive\
  \ encounter you come up with.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
