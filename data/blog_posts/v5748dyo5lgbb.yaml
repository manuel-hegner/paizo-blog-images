  \ Class Guide Preview: Slayer</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 22, 2014</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Into every generation, a slayer is born. The slayer is a hunter, a stalker, and\
  \ a killer, with enough power to fight fairly and win, but the inclination to fight\
  \ unfairly and win by an even wider margin. The slayer combines the stalking and\
  \ combat styles of the rogue and the ranger with none of the ranger's nature focus.\
  \ Basically, the slayer is Ezio from the <i>Assassin's Creed</i> series, the quintessential\
  \ assassin and the last person you want to see leaping out at you from the shadows.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The slayer is a full BAB class with a slower sneak attack progression\
  \ than the rogue, talents at even levels, and its own prime feature, favored target\
  \ (which is now called studied target). Studied target is the slayer's spin on favored\
  \ enemy. Instead of hating a particular type of creature, the slayer studies any\
  \ target he wants (hey, no wonder it's called studied target!), gaining bonuses\
  \ against that target until he switches targets. Since this bonus also applies to\
  \ Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival (and later Disguise,\
  \ Intimidate, and Stealth), clever slayers can also gain a substantial boon from\
  \ this feature in a variety of non-combat situations as well by studying NPCs during\
  \ social encounters too. Favored target has unlimited daily uses, and who knows—\
  if the old lady suddenly starts attacking, then you're even ready to fight back\
  \ right away!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-SlayerPreview.jpg\"\

  \      <br>Illustration by Ramon Puasa Jr\n     </div> \n     <p>In the original\
  \ version, there were 16 choices for slayer talents with 8 additional advanced talents\
  \ available at level 10. Playtesters had trouble finding enough talents that they\
  \ wanted to take for their builds, so for the second playtest, this increased to\
  \ 24 talents and 10 advanced talents, including the powerful combat style talent\
  \ that could be taken three times, essentially granting the ranger's combat style\
  \ feats to the slayer, and allowing the slayer the potential to amass a small army\
  \ of feats at his disposal. Additionally, playtests had shown that the slayer's\
  \ 4+Int bonus skill points were insufficient to pick up all the sorts of skills\
  \ he needed to successfully slay, so he bumped up to 6+Int skill points.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The final version of the slayer as it appears in the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a> is quite similar to the second playtest version,\
  \ so pull up your playtest document (or download it now) for an excellent preview\
  \ of the class. The most exciting change is in the action economy of studied target—\
  at low levels (before 7th when you can study as a swift action), melee slayers were\
  \ finding the move action to study a target was really cramping their ambushes.\
  \ So now, starting from level 1, if you hit and deal sneak attack damage, you can\
  \ apply your studied target as an immediate action, and it even applies the favored\
  \ target bonus to damage for that same attack. That way, you can ambush all you\
  \ like and get right to the slaying!</p> \n     <p>The slayer screams out for archetypes\
  \ that capture all the different facets of the iconic image of the slayer. The slayer\
  \ archetypes in this book are really nice in that they give you what you're looking\
  \ for with a relatively light touch, generally switching out a few of your talents\
  \ for thematic abilities and losing very little else. The bounty hunter is your\
  \ Boba Fett, bringing back criminals and debtors alive with combat maneuvers and\
  \ an incapacitating death attack. The cleaner is the guy you send in to make sure\
  \ those darned investigators don't figure out what happened, with a special ability\
  \ to force any would-be detectives to beat the cleaner's Disguise or Stealth in\
  \ order to find clues. The cutthroat is even more like Ezio, losing outdoorsy skills\
  \ for city-based powers and skill bonuses that will help you leap off buildings\
  \ instead of out of the shadows. The grave warden goes back to my intro quote with\
  \ a kickass undead slayer, gaining an at-will self-only death ward at level 7 (it\
  \ does cost 4 holy waters) and the ability to death attack an undead. But I'm sure\
  \ you've been wondering \"Mark, when are you going to get to that glowy purply shadow\
  \ guy. He looks awesome!\" That, my friends, is the stygian slayer, a killer imbued\
  \ with the darkest shadows. He can cast invisibility, use wands and scrolls of a\
  \ few thematic spells without a Use Magic Device Check, and turn into an inky black\
  \ cloud that obscures vision. And that's just 5 of the 8 slayer archetypes in the\
  \ final book! But wait—people have been asking for a thrown weapon ranger combat\
  \ style for a while, right? Yeah, we have that too!</p> \n     <p>So you've got\
  \ the rogue. You've got the ranger. Why should you be excited about the slayer class?\
  \ Because those other classes serve a few masters when it comes to their design,\
  \ but the slayer unashamedly serves only one—he wants to be the best at slaying,\
  \ eliminating a chosen foe or foes. And he serves his master well. Even a fighter's\
  \ offense can't keep up with the slayer, so if you prefer a style that emphasizes\
  \ guile, stealth, and strong offense over defense, the slayer is the class for you.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As I'm typing this last paragraph, I've noticed that the slayer has\
  \ some kind of a curved dagger to my throat, and he's made a few demands, so I want\
  \ you to know, completely not under duress, that the slayer is my personal hero\
  \ and is the best at all things. In fact, we're going to put out an entire book\
  \ dedicated only to slayer options, and—aaaaaargh.</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br>\

  \ raptors away from the scene, we found this blog on a USB drive clutched in the\

  \ anyone mentions the slayer class. He defies anyone who claims that if he was dying,\
  \ he wouldn't have bothered to have typed \"Aaaaargh\", he'd just say it.</i></p>\
