  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Merisiel took a deep breath,\
  \ held it, then let it out slowly as she tried to relax, her arms balanced, palms\
  \ up, along the chair’s slender armrests. It wasn’t working. Her belly remained\
  \ tight and crawling with gutwasps—the nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach\
  \ that the church of Calistria called “the tingle you get ‘fore the trick is all\
  \ set.” But this was no complex prank or long-planned vengeance that had the wasps\
  \ doing their thing. It was something, Merisiel forced herself to remember, that\
  \ she’d brought entirely upon herself.</p> \n     <p>Not that bringing nerve-wracking\
  \ situations on herself was anything new either. </p> \n     <p>There was the time\
  \ she’d crawled head-first into that narrow crevice at the base of that giant anvil-altar\
  \ after Harsk had mentioned how worshipers of Droskar supposedly stashed treasures\
  \ under the immense shrines. </p> \n     <p>Or the time that Valeros had challenged\
  \ her to a drinking contest on that long trip to Absalom. And who could forget Lem’\
  s face when she took him on with that dare to climb to the top of a Hellknight castle’\
  s tower to swap out its flag for a set of ogre undergarments? </p> \n     <p>And\
  \ of course, there was that stunt she’d pulled when she’d first met that cute cleric\
  \ up in Sandpoint; when Merisiel had thrown herself into the thick of a fight against\
  \ a pack of ghouls in order to show off that there was more than one way to destroy\
  \ undead uprisings.</p> \n     <p>Thinking back on those antics did the trick, and\
  \ Merisiel sighed in relief as the gutwasps settled down. After all, the cache of\
  \ magic potions, scrolls, and talismans she’d recovered from the under-anvil stash\
  \ ended up saving the day not long thereafter when those smoke-bearded undead guardians\
  \ had risen up against them, hadn’t they? (Never mind the fact that it was the pilfering\
  \ of the temple treasury that likely got their attention in the first place.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And good, old Valeros sill thought she’d won the drinking contest fair\
  \ and square and bragged about her fortitude to anyone who’d listen. (As far as\
  \ Merisiel was concerned, some quick sleight of hand on the drinks was only playing\
  \ to her strength anyway—it was only cheating if you got caught!)</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ those insufferable Hellknights had the heraldry redecoration coming. (More to\
  \ the point, everyone she told the story to agreed that ogre garments looked better\
  \ on a Hellknight flagpole than any dull, old flag!)</p> \n     <p>And as for that\
  \ ghoul-slaying gambit, the fact that Merisiel knew those filthy, old ghouls wouldn’\
  t be able to paralyze her didn’t make the stunt any less risky. She’d managed to\
  \ avoid any serious bites, but after finishing off the last of them with a dagger\
  \ to the dome, she’d emerged completely covered with claw marks and a bit dizzy\
  \ from blood loss. Of course, the dizzy only got worse when the cute cleric swooped\
  \ in to catch her as she stumbled and began to heal up her wounds. Merisiel had\
  \ been tempted to kiss her there and then, but those pesky gutwasps had gotten in\
  \ the way. Still, she must have made an impression on Kyra, since that first kiss\
  \ came not so long after. Better than the dragon’s whole treasure horde, that moment!</p>\

  \ \n     <p>And just like that, all the work she’d done to banish her jitters went\
  \ out the window. Just thinking of Kyra had brought back the gutwasps. Merisiel\
  \ couldn’t help but wonder, was the woman she loved experiencing the same jitters\
  \ herself, one room over? She couldn’t imagine it. Kyra was always so calming, so\
  \ stable, so confident. And for that matter, the church of Sarenrae probably didn’\
  t call it gutwasps anyway. Maybe… sun-gut? Angel ache? Dawnflower jitters? The healy\
  \ heaves? The last notion brought a giggle to the elf’s lips, and the nervousness\
  \ in that titter startled her. She reached down to give her weal ribbon a rub, but\
  \ of course that didn’t help; she’d given the yellow and black Calistrian ribbon\
  \ over to the high priestess for use in the ritual.</p> \n     <p>Merisiel was out\
  \ of the chair then, pacing the length of the room as she ran over her part in the\
  \ ritual in her head. Here, surrounded on all sides by Sarenite art and iconography,\
  \ she couldn’t help but feel inadequate. What place did an elf with no family, a\
  \ thief and a smuggler, a part-time worshiper of the goddess of trickery, vengeance,\
  \ and pleasure, have in a place as beautiful as this? What place did she have at\
  \ the side of one of the most kind-hearted and understanding people she’d ever met?\
  \ Merisiel pushed those doubts aside, reminding herself that, while she’d spent\
  \ most of that night a week ago building up her courage to suggest she and Kyra\
  \ take part in a heartbond, Kyra had surprised her by making the suggestion herself.\
  \ This whole plan wasn’t technically Merisiel’s own, despite the months she’d taken\
  \ researching the ritual and preparing for it. Kyra had been the first to suggest\
  \ it, after all.</p> \n     <p>Merisiel’s nervous thoughts kept returning to the\
  \ what-ifs of the pending rite. She and Kyra, as the focus of the magic, would only\
  \ be secondary performers in the ritual, but that didn’t mean that their part in\
  \ activating the magic wouldn’t be important. She knew that Kyra would be performing\
  \ her part of the ritual using her knack at knowing the right thing to say, but\
  \ Merisiel had to rely upon her skill at knowing the ins and outs of society as\
  \ a whole. As with any ritual, there was a potential for backlash, but the descriptions\
  \ of the jitters and shakes and dulling of wits that struck those who failed to\
  \ perform a heartbond properly didn’t seem all that much worse than the gutwasps\
  \ she was already dealing with.</p> \n     <p>And of course, if all went according\
  \ to plan, they’d have more than a cherished memory of the declaration of their\
  \ love for each other—they would be connected on a level even deeper than before,\
  \ able to sense each other’s proximity, to share their thoughts and hopes, and would\
  \ never feel alone. Merisiel had assumed Kyra would want to seal the ritual with\
  \ traditional matched rings. In preparation, she had actually purchased jewelry\
  \ for the first time she could remember (plundered or stolen rings just seemed wrong\
  \ in this case), only for Kyra to suggest using Calistrian weal ribbons to symbolize\
  \ the bond. Kyra must have taken Merisiel’s shock for something other than speechless\
  \ love, since she’d hastened to add, “Since you’ve pushed to have the ritual performed\
  \ by my church, it just made sense for there to be an element of yours involved.”\
  \ Or at least, that’s how Merisiel assumed the sentence would have ended if she\
  \ hadn’t stopped it with an impulsive kiss.</p> \n     <p>A knock on the door brought\
  \ her pacing feet and her racing thoughts to a standstill. “The high priestess is\
  \ ready for you,” came the acolyte’s voice.</p> \n     <p>“Okay!” Merisiel answered,\
  \ blushing as she heard that nervous tremble in her own voice. She took a breath\
  \ and stepped toward the door. She could already hear the music swelling, could\
  \ even hear Seoni chiding Valeros to “Quiet down—here they come” from the far side\
  \ of the door. The gutwasps were back and worse than ever, and as Merisiel opened\
  \ the door, she marveled at how her hand, normally so steady, so precise, was shaking.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And then, as she stood at the edge of the room, only vaguely aware of\
  \ her friends gathered (mostly) silently along the walls, she saw Kyra framed in\
  \ the opposite doorway. And a moment later, as Kyra’s lips moved, Merisiel heard\
  \ her beloved’s voice whisper in her ear. If the ritual was truly successful, they’\
  d both be able to speak to each other with their thoughts, but for the moment, Merisiel\
  \ knew that Kyra had cast the cantrip herself.</p> \n     <p>“Here we go, Meri!\
  \ You look amazing! Hope I don’t mess this up—I’ve got a raging case of gutwasps!”\
  </p> \n     <p>With those words, Kyra effortlessly soothed Merisiel’s nerves, and\
  \ with her whispered reply, words meant for Kyra alone, they strode into the room\
  \ together.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
