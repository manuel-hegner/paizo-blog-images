  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we’re kicking off a new\
  \ batch of No-Prep Character blogs, which feature a ready-to-run NPC for busy Game\
  \ Masters. This time around, Eleanor and I worked together to showcase some of the\
  \ as-of-yet unrevealed ancestries appearing in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em></a>. Each of these NPCs uses one of the new\
  \ ancestries or versatile heritages featured in that book, but feature all of the\
  \ rules information you need to include them in your adventures right away! This\
  \ week we showcase a new versatile heritage: aphorite! I’ll talk a bit more about\
  \ aphorites after showing you the NPC, but for now, let’s look at our no-prep aphorite,\
  \ Urok..</p> \n     <h4>Urok, Kobold Infiltrator</h4> \n     <p>When the Yioxat\
  \ tribe of kobolds was subjugated by a local devil, its members feared that their\
  \ children might be corrupted by their parents' unwilling agreements with Hell.\
  \ Yet when Urok cracked open his shell, his caretakers were shocked to see the kobold\
  \ hatchling had unique gold and silver scales, unlike even the scales of a metallic\
  \ kobold. Though his soul was unclaimed by the forces of evil, Urok grew up arrogant\
  \ and overbearing, enforcing the strict order that the devil imposed on his tribe.\
  \ He was quick to realize that his fellows weren't carrying out their tasks as efficiently\
  \ as they could be, and his efforts to organize his tribe more effectively always\
  \ seemed to fail. It was only after investigating that he realized how much the\
  \ Yioxats were deliberately undermining his efforts, as they despised their devil\
  \ overlord, and despised Urok by association.</p> \n     <p>Though he was heavily\
  \ tempted to double down on his attempts to control, Urok instead fled, hiding in\
  \ the wilderness as he tried to make sense of his life until this point. It was\
  \ there that a Yioxat dragon sorcerer found him. The sorcerer explained that the\
  \ Yioxat tribe had warded Urok's egg against evil influence before he was born,\
  \ to protect him from the risk of Hell claiming his soul. Realizing that he had\
  \ repaid his people's kindness with oppression, Urok decided to serve the law by\
  \ returning sovereignty to his tribe. Though he doesn't want to approach his fellows\
  \ just yet, he keeps watch over them, looking for an opportunity to kill the devil\
  \ and free his family. However, this has also resulted in Urok clashing with well-meaning\
  \ adventurers who seek to destroy the Yioxat tribe without realizing the kobolds\
  \ are unwilling servants.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b3bdca0b-06e2-4e62-9c8c-b6449bf95acb/021221_urok.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><b>Preemptive Reconfiguration</b> [reaction] <b>Frequency</b> once per\
  \ day; <b>Trigger </b>Urok would take bludgeoning piercing, or slashing damage;\
  \ <b>Effect</b> Urok’s body anticipates the blow and the impact area briefly reorganizes\
  \ into a strengthened tissue lattice that blunts the attack. He gains resistance\
  \ 9 against the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Urok can expend his daily use of Crystalline Dust when using this reaction.\
  \ If he does, his daily use of Preemptive Reconfiguration isn’t expended and he\
  \ can use it a second time.</p> \n     <p><b>Speed</b> 25 feet</p> \n     <p><b>Melee</b>\
  \ [one-action] dagger +19 (agile, finesse, versatile S), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action] dagger +19 (agile, finesse, thrown 10 feet,\
  \ versatile S), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p> \n     <p><b>Crystalline Dust</b>\
  \ [two-actions] <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> Urok disperses the\
  \ crystalline motes coating his body as a haze. He becomes concealed, though he\
  \ can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. The motes stay within an inch of\
  \ his skin, move with you, and last for 4 rounds.</p> \n     <p><b>Draconic Exemplar</b>\
  \ green dragon</p> \n     <p><b>Kobold Breath</b> [two-actions] (arcane, evocation,\
  \ poison) Urok breathes a poisonous mist that deals 5d4 poison damage in a 15-foot\
  \ cone (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). He can’t use Kobold Breath again for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ </p> \n     <p><b>Mastermind</b> If Urok successfully identifies a creature using\
  \ Recall Knowledge, that creature is flat-footed against his attacks until the start\
  \ of his next turn; if he critically succeeds, it’s flat-footed against his attacks\
  \ for 1 minute.</p> \n     <p><b>Skirmish Strike</b> [one-action] <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ once per round; <b>Effect</b> Urok either Steps and then Strike, or Strikes and\
  \ then Steps.</p> \n     <p><b>Sneak Attack</b> Urok’s Strikes deal an additional\
  \ 2d6 precision damage to flat‑footed creatures.</p> \n     <h4>Plot Hooks</h4>\
  \ \n     <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating\
  \ Urok into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Urok\
  \ arrives in the same town as the heroes. He is met with unwelcoming glances and\
  \ even fear from the townsfolk. The pleading kobold asks anyone who will listen\
  \ that he is in need of cold iron weapons to slay the devil that terrorizes his\
  \ kin.</li> \n      <li>A local noble tasks the heroes with clearing the Yioxat\
  \ kobold tribe from the nearby wilderness. As they approach the tribe, Urok makes\
  \ himself known and attempts to force the heroes away.</li> \n      <li>A fleeing\
  \ Urok runs into the heroes as they are travelling. He is holding a large egg and\
  \ shoves it into the heroes’ hands. He explains the egg has been warded and needs\
  \ to be kept away from evil eyes before he runs away.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h4>About\
  \ Aphorites</h4> \n     <p>Aphorites were first forged by axiomites to serve as\
  \ liaisons between their lawful progenitors and frustratingly unpredictable mortal\
  \ allies. Over time, aphorites’ appearances and personalities grew to resemble their\
  \ mortal comrades as they were increasingly born among mortals. Aphorites still\
  \ exhibit Axis’s touch in their metallic skin coated in crystalline dust, aptitude\
  \ for logic, strength in artisanship, and propensity for order and cooperation.\
  \ Aphorite feats allow an aphorite to draw upon the power of their crystalline dust,\
  \ analyze a situation on the battlefield to maximize effectiveness, and even call\
  \ upon order to find success when catastrophic failure was all but absolute. Aphorite\
  \ is an uncommon versatile heritage and you can learn all about it when <a href=\"\
