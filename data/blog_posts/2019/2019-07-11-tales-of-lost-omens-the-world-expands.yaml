  \             <blockquote>\n              <p itemprop=\"description\">Hadizah stood\
  \ stiffly between two other students—one a degenerate lizardfolk and the other a\
  \ savage Ekujae elf—as their frail teacher Mawunyo gestured with a staff at the\
  \ vine-covered towers, graceful arches, and broad towers of the Magaambya, greatest\
  \ magical academy in all of the Mwangi Expanse, if not the world.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>\"You embark now on a life of study and service.\" Mawunyo's voice was\
  \ rich and resonant despite his slender frame and reminded Hadizah uncomfortably\
  \ of the ringing tones of the priests of the Deathless Child back home. \"You have\
  \ been chosen because we see great promise within you, passion and will, spirit\
  \ and intellect, strength and judgment... and perhaps a few seeds of wisdom that\
  \ might sprout and blossom if tended.\" The teacher's assistant Kweku chuckled,\
  \ and Hadizah risked a glance at her. She'd been with Mawunyo for years, apparently,\
  \ traveling with him to the far ends of the world (and even, some rumors said, beyond).\
  \ Her robe's hem was spattered with mud and her hair was a thousand messy braids\
  \ and an hour after meeting her Hadizah was more than halfway in love. Inconvenient.</p>\n\

  \ alt=\"Several terraced buildings in the late afternoon sun, the light filtering\
  \ down from the upper left. The buildings are surrounded by leafy trees and plants\
  \ grow on the sides of the buildings and terraces. On the right, the terrace in\
  \ front of a building is neatly manicured and has a small group of people in robes\
  \ gathered. One holds a staff with a glowing red end up to the sky as the others\
  \ look on. A cloaked, hooded person watches from the stairs leading up to the terrace.\"\

  \              </div>\n              <p>Mawunyo went on. \"You come from different\
  \ places, but you are all children of the Expanse, as am I. We are the successors\
  \ and inheritors of Old-Mage Jatembe, who taught that those who use great magic\
  \ bear great responsibility, and that we must use our knowledge to better the world.\
  \ I do this by teaching such as you.\"</p>\n              <p>\"And by beating demons\
  \ to death with sticks,\" Kweku said.</p>\n              <p>Mawunyo shrugged his\
  \ bony shoulders. \"When I am abroad. As needed. With sticks made especially for\
  \ the purpose.\" He thumped his staff, which hadn't previously struck Hadizah as\
  \ particularly threatening, but now did. \"We need no such weapons here. Nantambu\
  \ the Song-Wind City is the safest place I have ever lived.\"</p>\n            \
  \  <p>\"So safe we leave sometimes just to feel the thrill of danger,\" Kweku said.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Mawuonyo took no notice. \"Those who mean this city harm soon\
  \ discover the folly of attacking a place hundreds of mages call home. No invader\
  \ has needed to learn that lesson recently. This safety gives us the freedom to\
  \ learn in peace. I am here to help discover how your talents might best serve the\
  \ world.\" He leaned on his staff and gazed at each student in turn. The instructor's\
  \ eyes seemed to penetrate Hadizah's soul. Hadizah hoped they couldn't.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>The old man spoke. \"Tell me: once you have attained the power of\
  \ which you dream, what goals do you wish to achieve?\"</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ lizardfolk spoke slowly, with many words in a tongue Hadizah didn't know, but\
  \ the gist seemed to be something about improving prospects for the females of its\
  \ species. Perhaps it was female? Hadizah had no idea how to tell. Such creatures\
  \ were not common back in Mzali. Then the elf spoke, something abstract about combining\
  \ arcane and druidic arts to make an alloyed magic stronger and more flexible than\
  \ either alone. Mawunyo and Kweku nodded along thoughtfully during these speeches,\
  \ then turned their gazes to Hadizah.</p>\n              <p>He straightened his\
  \ spine and said, \"I come from Mzali, home of the Deathless Child, who rules my\
  \ people with fire and fear. Do you know the place?\"</p>\n              <p>\"I\
  \ have been there,\" Mawunyo said. \"When it was a place of fading glory, before\
  \ the child mummy Walkena woke and seized control. Not since.\"</p>\n          \
  \    <p>\"Citizens are... not encouraged to leave,\" Hadizah said. \"Walkena demands\
  \ obedience and sacrifice, and his rule is cruel if you do not have his favor. There\
  \ is a group, the Bright Lions, who seek to overthrow Walkena's rule and return\
  \ control of the city to the living. The Lions discovered my interest in the arcane\
  \ arts and offered to help me come here. They did this purely out of kindness...\
  \ but I wish to return that kindness, and to turn whatever power I gain toward their\
  \ cause. If left unchecked, Walkena will achieve his goal of uniting the whole of\
  \ the Expanse under his burning banner. He would put even this place to the flame.\
  \ I wish to prevent that.\"</p>\n              <p>Mawunyo and Kweku nodded at that,\
  \ just as they had at the ambitious proclamations of the other students, and deep\
  \ in his hidden heart Hadizah relaxed.</p>\n              <p>\"Take the afternoon\
  \ to familiarize yourself with your living quarters,\" Mawunyo said, \"and at least\
  \ the immediate areas of the academy nearby. I will ponder what I know of your goals\
  \ and resources, and tomorrow we will meet again to discuss the first steps of your\
  \ studies.\" He turned and walked away, using the staff more as a prop than an aid\
  \ to walking, it seemed to Hadizah. Perhaps he was less frail than he seemed.</p>\n\
  \              <p>The group broke up, and Hazidah headed for his dormitory, wondering\
  \ where he might find a place of privacy to record the day's events. Kweku fell\
  \ into step beside him. \"Mzali,\" she said. \"You still have people there?\"</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"I... not really, not anymore.\" He thought, briefly, of fire,\
  \ and ashes, and stains on stones, but pushed those images away. Actions had consequences.\
  \ He would make wiser choices than his parents and siblings had. \"In a way, all\
  \ the people in Mzali are my people, and deserve liberation.\" That sounded like\
  \ something a friend of the Lions would say.</p>\n              <p>\"I'm sorry to\
  \ hear that.\" She spun and started walking backwards so she could face him while\
  \ she talked, effortlessly going up a set of stairs in reverse. \"This place must\
  \ be quite a change. Not just the change in architectural style, but all the different\
  \ sorts of people, the music in the air, the absence of a pervasive atmosphere of\
  \ terror....\"</p>\n              <p>\"It is a... most refreshing change.\"</p>\n\
  \              <p>Kweku nodded and preceded him through a wide and empty plaza.\
  \ \"I wanted to mention, there's a small but dedicated group here studying the problem\
  \ of your Deathless Child Walkena. I know some people on it—there's even a Tempest-Sun\
  \ Mage among them. Maybe you'd like to be introduced?\"</p>\n              <p>Hazidah\
  \ hesitated. He didn't know if he'd been sent to this place on orders directly from\
  \ the child-god Walkena himself, as the priest who'd recruited him claimed, or if\
  \ he was part of that priest's own pet project, but either way, his mission was\
  \ both simple and dauntingly complex: find out the weaknesses of the academy, and\
  \ discover how the mages here would deal with an invasion from Mzali, so the Deathless\
  \ Child might better counter their plans. Being part of a group specifically addressing\
  \ the threat of Walkena would be perfect for gathering such information, but it\
  \ might also expose him to greater scrutiny, and his mission was meant to be slow,\
  \ cautious, and years-long. \"I am not sure I have much to offer to such a group.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"Oh, I don't know.\" Kweku grinned. \"Having a double agent\
  \ who's trusted by the Deathless Child's priests could be very advantageous for\
  \ us.\"</p>\n              <p>Hazidah froze. His hand crept toward the interior\
  \ of his robe, but Kweku snorted. \"You'd lose a fight with me anyway but look up\
  \ before you even try.\"</p>\n              <p>He quickly flicked his gaze upward,\
  \ and saw something in the air above him, like a flash of sunlight on bright metal.\
  \ The stories said the Tempest-Sun Mages flew high above the academy, watching for\
  \ approaching threats... and they were capable of dealing with more dangerous foes\
  \ than Hazidah. He lowered his hand and gazed levelly at Kweku. \"I suppose I should\
  \ have feigned confusion.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Many spies would have, but this\
  \ saves time. We've known about you since you first applied. The spellcraft hiding\
  \ your lies is good, but we did a deeper delve into your story and found some loose\
  \ threads that unraveled when we pulled on them.\" She stepped close to him, and\
  \ he tensed, expecting an attack, but instead she looped her arm through his. \"\
  Walk with me.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Are you taking me to be executed? Or to\
  \ break my mind and make me your servant?\"</p>\n              <p>\"Life under the\
  \ Deathless Child has not been good for you, Hazidah. You see enemies everywhere.\
  \ I'm not your enemy. I'm your teacher. And what I'm going to teach you is that\
  \ you're on the wrong side.\"</p>\n              <p>Hazidah shook his head. Loyalty\
  \ was all—the foundation of every temple, the ground beneath every step, and to\
  \ transgress against Walkena was to face the Punishment of Seven Angry Suns. The\
  \ priest who'd recruited him had made provisions to ensure Hazidah's loyalty even\
  \ if his faith faltered, though. \"Even if I were swayed by your lies, my obedience\
  \ is compelled by powers far beyond my will.\"</p>\n              <p>\"Oh, yes,\
  \ I know,\" Kweku said. \"Your bindings have bindings. Those will have to be removed\
  \ if we hope to make any progress.\" She patted him on the arm. He tried to remember\
  \ the last time he'd been touched in such a friendly way. \"It's a good thing we're\
  \ in the greatest magical academy the world has ever known, surrounded by experts\
  \ in magic, isn't it?\"</p>\n              <p>His heart stirred at her touch. He'd\
  \ never met anyone like her at home—she was intelligent and powerful, but she was\
  \ <em>messy</em>, and impulsive, and outspoken. Everything he should hate: a native\
  \ of the Expanse who'd been corrupted and weakened by the outside world, and who\
  \ sought to bring that poison back home. And it <em>was</em> poison. He could pretend\
  \ to play along, let them think they'd won him over to their cause while he gathered\
  \ intelligence to use against them... surely there were such things as <em>triple</em>\
  \ agents—</p>\n              <p>She stumbled on a loose stone and put her hand on\
  \ his arm to steady herself... then left her hand there as they walked.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>\"Will you be... working with me closely?\" He stared down at her\
  \ fingers, curled over his forearm.</p>\n              <p>\"That's the idea. I'll\
  \ be your handler, Haz. We'll do great things.\"</p>\n              <p><em>Haz.</em>\
  \ His heart stirred again, and he thought: what if she corrupts <em>me</em>? Would\
  \ it be better to fight back now, and die, still pure? Or had he pledged his allegiance\
  \ to the wrong flame—the flame of his master's power, rather than the flame inside\
  \ himself?</p>\n              <p>She stepped away to lead him through an archway\
  \ at the base of a dark tower, and when her back was turned, he reached out to her.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Even he didn't know, in that moment, if he was reaching out to\
  \ strangle or embrace.</p>\n              <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
