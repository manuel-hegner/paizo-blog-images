  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Amiri is the character that\
  \ got me thinking about these character strategy guides in the first place. I don’\
  t think I’ve ever played her in a tabletop game, but I played all of the Rise of\
  \ the Runelords characters a lot in Obsidian’s <i>Pathfinder Adventures</i> computer\
  \ game shortly after it was released, and I was really impressed by subtle uses\
  \ of Amiri’s power of movement. That cleverness is still there in the <i>Core Set</i>,\
  \ so I’m happy to finally present these strategies, over three years after I wrote\
  \ an earlier version of them down in rough notes.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Core Set\
  \ Amiri</h2> \n     <p><b>Best Skill</b>: Strength (d12)<br> <b>Character Type</b>:\
  \ Warrior, Melee</p> \n     <p><b>Skills</b>. As a character with a d12, Amiri gets\
  \ to roll the best die in the game. This makes her especially strong in combat (Melee:\
  \ Strength +2) and even more so if she’s blessed, since blessings add a d12 each.\
  \ That often makes Amiri a great choice for fighting the villain. Amiri’s other\
  \ skills are Fortitude and Survival, of which Survival is the only one that’s somewhat\
  \ rare—shared by only Harsk and Lini in the <i>Core Set</i>. Harsk in fact shares\
  \ <i>both</i> of these subsidiary skills with Amiri, so they’re not good fellows\
  \ in an adventuring party due to the overlap.</p> \n     <p><i>Weaknesses</i>. Amiri’\
  s d4 is in Charisma, which makes it harder to recruit allies. Generally, Amiri shouldn’\
  t explore ally-heavy locations, though some allies have a Survival acquisition roll,\
  \ so she still has a chance. Otherwise, Amiri’s biggest weakness is that her sub-skills\
  \ are all +1 or +2, balancing out her high Strength roll.</p> \n     <p><b>Cards</b>.\
  \ Barbarians hate magic(!), so it’s no surprise that Amiri has no spell card slots\
  \ (0), but remember that she can always cast spells as one-off “scrolls.” She may\
  \ have more weapon cards (4) and armor cards (2) than she needs, and this can clog\
  \ your hand if you’re not careful, so you should only increase these slots after\
  \ Amiri’s deck has gotten large enough that you can no longer reliably draw the\
  \ weapons and armor that you need.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Blessings</i>.\
  \ The favored deity for Amiri is probably Torag, who can boost her already robust\
  \ Strength and Constitution. Given Amiri’s role as a brutish fighter, Gorum and\
  \ Lamashtu aren’t bad either</p> \n     <p><i>Clarification: What is a non-Attack\
  \ combat check?</i> Attack is a trait that tends to be added by spells and Wand\
  \ items, so a non-Attack combat check tends to be a physical attack, like Melee\
  \ or Ranged. That’s why Gorum is the perfect deity for physical combatants.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Items</i>. Amiri will often discard weapons for extra damage and\
  \ will discard blessings and allies to explore again, but she has no way to recover\
  \ them on her own. Obviously, there should be a healer in your party like Kyra or\
  \ Lini, but Sarenrae also helps those who help themselves, so stock up on healing\
  \ items like Elixirs of Healing, Balmberries, and Staffs of Minor Healing.</p> \n\
  \     <p><i>Weapons</i>. Amiri prefers Melee strength weapons that can be recharged\
  \ or reloaded (instead of discarded) for extra damage. That tends to mean swords\
  \ (such as the Shortsword, Longsword, and Keen Rapier), which usually reload for\
  \ small bonuses.</p> \n     <h3>The Power of Rage</h3> \n     <p>Although it’s not\
  \ Amiri’s most interesting power, her “rage” may be the most useful: she can add\
  \ her Fortitude skill to Strength checks or checks against monsters.</p> \n    \
  \ <p><b>Take Rage from Discard as Your First <u>Power Feat</u>.</b> Thanks to her\
  \ Melee skill of d12 + 2, Amiri is already a combat monster, but the rage power\
  \ just improves that, because she can now add Fortitude skill of d8 + 1 to checks\
  \ against monsters, which brings it to d12 + d8 + 3, even before adding in a weapon.\
  \ (In fact, Amiri can get away without having a weapon in many fights, as she averages\
  \ 14 if she rages, and she certainly doesn’t need to discard a weapon in most cases\
  \ if she rages.) The catch is Amiri’s need to bury a card from her hand to rage,\
  \ which is quite costly except near the end of the game, as buried cards typically\
  \ can’t be recovered. This is why Amiri’s first power feat should go toward turning\
  \ her rage into an ability that draws from her discards: it’s still costly due to\
  \ the loss of a card, but at least it doesn’t thin her hand (and honestly, that’\
  s one less card that she needs to heal).</p> \n     <p><i>Clarification: What is\
  \ the Fortitude Skill?</i> The Fortitude skill is the die plus any modifiers that\
  \ you add together when rolling Fortitude (as described in page 11 of the Core Set\
  \ rules). For Amiri, that’s d8 + 1 at start. If the rage power had instead said\
  \ to add the Fortitude modifier, then it would be just the +1, and if it had said\
  \ the Fortitude die, then it would be just the d8, but a skill is both.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Rage, Rage against the Beginning of the Fight.</b> Note that Amiri’s\
  \ rage ability allows her to add Fortitude to any “check against a monster.” That’\
  s not just the main combat check! Amiri can also use her rage power on “before acting”\
  \ and “after acting” checks. These checks usually have lower target numbers that\
  \ become relatively easy when you get to add together two skills—both the listed\
  \ skill and Fortitude—so this may be even more useful than raging in the fight itself...\
  \ though you can of course do both.</p> \n     <p><b>Rage When You Talk Too.</b>\
  \ Similarly, if a monster has a non-combat check to defeat, like Charisma or Divine,\
  \ it might be easier to do that than actually fight, as non-combat checks to defeat\
  \ tend to have lower difficulties. Take a look at your comparative dice pools and\
  \ see which is better.</p> \n     <p><b>Collect Things to Break.</b> The cost of\
  \ Amiri’s rage is breaking stuff—which is to say burying cards. To prepare for this,\
  \ try to collect things early in the game. Send Amiri to a boon-heavy location,\
  \ and even if she picks up junk like Quarterstaffs and Leather Armors, she can still\
  \ use them to fuel her rage. And once she’s taken the power feat that lets her fuel\
  \ her rage with discards, she doesn’t even need to let the junk clutter her hand;\
  \ she can discard it at the earliest opportunity.</p> \n     <h3>The Power of Movement</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Though Amiri’s rage is extremely useful, it’s her power of movement\
  \ that is unique, and allows her to do something that no one else can (well, other\
  \ than roles and other characters that copy the power!).</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <p><b>Dance\
  \ Around Locations with Start-of-Turn Penalties.</b> Amiri should be your group’\
  s character to explore locations where something bad happens at the start of your\
  \ turn. (There were more of these locations in previous sets, and presumably will\
  \ be more in future sets.) She can move there after the start of her turn, explore\
  \ during her turn, then move away at the end. Rinse and repeat until the location\
  \ is closed.</p> \n     <p><b>Occasionally Hang Out with Your Friends.</b> Alternatively,\
  \ Amiri might have friends who are great to explore with like Kyra (who can heal\
  \ Amiri, resolving one of her major disadvantages), Lem (who can boost local checks),\
  \ or Seelah (who can boost local checks and invoke Magic). But, it’s not always\
  \ great to hang around with friends because monsters can attack you all and barriers\
  \ can force everyone to make checks. So Amiri might join her friends during her\
  \ explorations, then flee the possibility of bad effects on their turns. </p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Be Ready to Guard Out of Turn.</b> Finally, Amiri can also use her ability\
  \ to guard locations on other players’ turns. Maybe she’s teaming up with other\
  \ characters on her turn or maybe there’s some nasty location that no one wants\
  \ to explore because it’s full of monsters and barriers. In either case, Amiri can\
  \ go sit at an otherwise unguarded location after her turn is done, then return\
  \ to her normal explorations at the start of her next turn. </p> \n     <p><i>Clarification:\
  \ Can Amiri’s Movement Be Stopped?</i> Yes! Per the Golden Rules on page 3 of the\
  \ Core Set Rulebook, if a card says that you cannot do something (such as the location\
  \ Cell, which says “You cannot move unless…”) and something else says you can (like\
  \ Amiri’s power), comply with the one that tells you that you cannot. (The Golden\
  \ Rules also say that locations override support cards, support cards override characters,\
  \ and characters override other card types, so that would stop her too.) </p> \n\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p><b>Take Your Friends with You.</b> Remember that Amiri’\
  s power extends to other characters. This means that if someone is exploring a nasty\
  \ location with beginning-of-the-turn powers, Amiri can also whisk them away; other\
  \ characters might even go to Amiri’s location with the intent to be moved away\
  \ on her turn. This makes Amiri’s location a prime spot for powers like the spell\
  \ Revitalize, which heals everyone there. Characters can move to Amiri’s location\
  \ to get healed, then she can move some of them away to spread out the party.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>The Amiri Roles</h3> \n     <p><i>Both of Amiri’s roles make her even\
  \ more of a combat monster; Resistance Fighter can help her take damage, while Smashmouth\
  \ can help her cycle her deck and destroy traps.</i></p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/011020_CoreSetRoleResistanceFighter.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/011020_CoreSetRoleResistanceFighter.jpg\"\

  ><img style=\"max-width:50%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/011020_CoreSetRoleSmashmouth.jpg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p><b>Resistance Fighter.</b> This role mainly offers\
  \ incremental improvements to Amiri’s core powers: she can remove scourges and heal\
  \ while raging and closing, and she can examine while moving. Her combat power also\
  \ gets even better thanks to freely played blessings. But there’s one big addition,\
  \ focused on damage taking: a set of three powers allow her to (controllably) discard\
  \ damage from her deck instead of her hand. This can really improve Amiri’s combat\
  \ against dangerous henchmen and villains, who often do pre-combat damage that can\
  \ empty out a hand. In those circumstances, Amiri can instead take the damage from\
  \ her deck while peeking to ensure they’re cards she can lose.</p> \n     <p><b>Smashmouth.</b>\
  \ This role also adds incremental improvements to Amiri’s powers, though it focuses\
  \ a little more on combat than the other role. The ability to recharge combat blessings\
  \ helps Amiri’s issue with healing, while the ability to recharge weapons to stop\
  \ before or after you act damage offers a different answer to that problem, and\
  \ one that’s less costly in health. The Smashmouth role also allows Amiri to rage\
  \ against barriers, which is a nice addition if you don’t have a Disabler in your\
  \ party.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
