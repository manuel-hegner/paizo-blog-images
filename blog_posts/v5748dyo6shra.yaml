  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Marcus was miserable.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Sign up for border forces</em>, his father said. <em>See the world.\
  \ Lend your strength and inner fire to Cheliax. Your brother and sisters could use\
  \ a role model. Your mother could use any surplus income.</em></p> \n     <p>Clearly\
  \ dad had never served.</p> \n     <p>The journey past the Menador Mountains was\
  \ challenging; Marcus had never left the Chelaxian border before, and the transition\
  \ the landscape made as they neared the Uskwood was unsettling. The sun seemed to\
  \ shine brighter back home; the colors were brilliant, the daylight sparkled, and\
  \ even the nighttime was made merrier by the vivid oranges and reds of torchlight\
  \ and campfire.</p> \n     <p>Everything here was muted. Smothered. Silent. As though\
  \ even the crickets were afraid to call, the birds too cautious to sing. The trees\
  \ here were different, too; gnarled, angular things whose branches inexplicably\
  \ still bore fresh leaves. He’d never seen new foliage look so drab, like it was\
  \ painful to even grow.</p> \n     <p>This entire place was shadow and silence;\
  \ even the campfire they’d made struggled against the oncoming darkness, and the\
  \ crackle of burning wood shouted their presence. Marcus huddled closer and gave\
  \ his companion a long-suffering look over the flames. </p> \n     <p>If Calerio\
  \ was bothered by the strange solitude of Nidal’s environs, he didn’t show it. The\
  \ man’s face was calm, his hand steady as it stoked the fire to further life. He\
  \ took another look around the small campsite, his dark eyes studying every nearby\
  \ tree and bush before settling again on his companion. Only then did the man’s\
  \ eyes soften a little, and the wisp of a smile tug at his mouth.</p> \n     <p>“\
  We won’t be here long,” Calerio reassured him. In the silence, even his soft baritone\
  \ seemed to boom.</p> \n     <p>“Good,” Marcus grumbled. “I’d much prefer mountain-diving\
  \ to this.” </p> \n     <p>His companion chuckled, and all too soon, the uncomfortable\
  \ silence pressed in. It needed to be chased off; grasping for a topic, Marcus asked,\
  \ “So, uh, you been here before?”</p> \n     <p>Calerio chuckled softly. “A long\
  \ time ago. Years. And never this close to the Uskwood. Even back in my old caravan\
  \ days, we never went through the Uskwood. The locals don’t like to be disturbed.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Yet here we are,” Marcus sighed.</p> \n     <p>“Here we are,” Calerio\
  \ agreed. “But these are the orders.”</p> \n     <p>The younger of the two sighed\
  \ and returned his eyes to the fire. Behind him, the sun’s last rays finally sank\
  \ below the horizon line, and night settled in, as though it always belonged there.\
  \ Nighttime should not feel so heavy, and yet it threatened to smother the Chelish\
  \ soldier. Marcus’s hand kept close to his scimitar, his stomach tightening in anticipation.\
  \ By now, the small campfire bellowed in the deadened silence, angry and intrusive.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“Won’t be long now,” breathed Calerio.</p> \n     <p>And it wasn’\
  t.</p> \n     <p>“<b>Blasphemers!</b>” The voice boomed, setting both men instantly\
  \ to their feet. “You shall pay the price for your intrusion!”</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \  <p>The attack came from nowhere. The shadow of the closest tree grew longer for\
  \ but a heartbeat, and then two figures leapt from the dark canopy – one black as\
  \ night, the other shiningly pale in comparison. Marcus barely had time to raise\
  \ his shield before the dark creature was upon him; the sudden weight threatened\
  \ to take his feet out from under him. He braced himself against it, shoved and\
  \ was rewarded with the scrape of tooth on metal and wood. His sword arm burned,\
  \ though, from the swipe of a horrid claw.</p> \n     <p>“Wait!” he heard Calerio\
  \ call. “We mean no harm!” A quick glance to the side showed his companion facing\
  \ off with a slender elf dressed in leather armor. Wisps of shadow curled in stark\
  \ contrast to the elf’s albino skin as he clutched a horrible-looking effigy made\
  \ of bark, blood, and bone.</p> \n     <p>The call came too late; as Marcus watched,\
  \ the shadows stretched up and over the pale elf’s hand, convalescing at his fingers\
  \ and shooting forward. The darkness <em>screamed</em> as it barreled into them,\
  \ a horrible, high-pitched monstrosity of sound that ripped through both men. For\
  \ a moment, Marcus couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, and was barely aware of the hot,\
  \ fresh blood that gushed from his nose, tickled over his chin, and dripped from\
  \ his beard.</p> \n     <p>He shook his head to clear it, noting in his peripheral\
  \ vision that Calerio had been affected by the <em>Shadow Blast</em> as well, but\
  \ was already recovering and leveling his shield and trident at the elf. Marcus\
  \ refocused on his adversary, and a momentary panic gripped him as he realized he’\
  d lost sight of the beast. </p> \n     <p>Then, there it was again, glowing green\
  \ eyes across the fire, snarling at man and flame as though both were equal enemies.\
  \ The fire brought definition to the strange, smoky animal. It moved like a hound,\
  \ snarled like one, and had the bulk and weight of any trained dog, but its very\
  \ being seemed to waver and meld with the shadows around it.</p> \n     <p>If it\
  \ wasn’t about to lunge again, Marcus might have wanted to ask questions. As it\
  \ was, his arm was ready; he would meet this next lunge with a slice the creature\
  \ would not soon forget. </p> \n     <p>Fortunately, it never came. With a cry,\
  \ Calerio rammed into the elf, yelling “In the name of our Master Zon-Kuthon, I\
  \ bid you hold!”</p> \n     <p>Wait… “<em>our</em>?”</p> \n     <p>At the very least,\
  \ it gave Calerio the moment he’d wanted. The albino elf twitched a finger, and\
  \ the strange shadow-hound backed away from Marcus, though kept its otherworldly\
  \ eyes set on the man. Wide-eyed and keeping his shield raised, the younger human\
  \ kept alert, breathing rapidly and spitting away the coppery-tasting blood that\
  \ trailed over his mouth. He took a step toward his companion.</p> \n     <p>“You\
  \ cannot claim to venerate our Midnight Lord and still violate our earth with that\
  \ filth,” the elf spat, casting a revolted look towards the campfire. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>Calerio considered his words a moment before speaking quietly. “Marcus, extinguish\
  \ the fire.”</p> \n     <p>Marcus wanted nothing more than to question that order,\
  \ but knew better, especially here and now. He carefully set about the task – tricky,\
  \ when he wanted to keep his eyes on the adversaries. As he worked, he heard Calerio\
  \ continue. “It was the fastest way we knew to summon one of the Shadowed faith,\
  \ and our need is great.”</p> \n     <p>“Your needs are unimportant to us, little\
  \ shadeling,” sneered the elf. “There is a price to pay for calling on us.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“It is a price I agree to pay,” intoned Calerio, sheathing his sword.\
  \ “Cheliax and Nidal have been allies for years. Our flames rise and give you taller\
  \ shadows. And now, Cheliax needs the expertise of your sect.”</p> \n     <p>“Why\
  \ should the druids of Uskwood care about what is happening in the bright lands?”\
  \ scoffed the elf. Another twitch of his fingers, and the shadow-hound approached,\
  \ obediently sitting at the elf’s feet.</p> \n     <p>The last, bright wisp of fire\
  \ died, leaving only wood smoke and darkness behind. The green glow of the shadow\
  \ hound’s eyes seemed all the brighter without the intrusive campfire. Even now,\
  \ the pale skin of the elf was easily seen; he made no attempt to hide himself,\
  \ and why should he? </p> \n     <p>“Because there are mysteries there whose unraveling\
  \ might be of utmost interest to the Midnight Lord – and both of our courts,” Calerio\
  \ answered softly.</p> \n     <p>The elf sighed. “Continue.”</p> \n     <p>Marcus\
  \ breathed. Calerio’s orders had seemed crazy, but they worked.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Recently we discovered a hollowed-out section of rock in the Menador Mountains.\
  \ We thought it was just an unfortunate experiment gone wrong, or perhaps an old,\
  \ weakened series of tunnels finally giving in to time, but once the debris was\
  \ cleared, we discovered a strange item. A huge, porous stone, different from the\
  \ stone of the mountain, twisting up into a point, like a giant stalagmite. It should\
  \ have been crushed with all the other debris, but it looked…almost fresh. And it\
  \ seemed to be…weeping.”</p> \n     <p>The druid stayed silent, arching pale eyebrows\
  \ as he considered Calerio’s words.</p> \n     <p>“There was no place where the\
  \ stone would have allowed water flow, and there’s no water source nearby, but we\
  \ have seen it with our own eyes, and I swear it is weeping. Your sect specializes\
  \ in the shadows and understand the natural order of things far more than we could.\
  \ This thing seems to thrive in the shadows of what used to be sturdy rock. What’\
  s more, if this weeping is magical or spiritual in nature, then none know more about\
  \ suffering than the Uskwood druids.” Calerio paused, swallowed thickly, and then\
  \ finished, “This discovery could be a godsend to both your masters and mine. I\
  \ will pay any price you or your sect decree, in honor of our Midnight Lord. Will\
  \ you help us?”</p> \n     <p>Marcus watched as the albino’s head canted to one\
  \ side, as though listening to the shadows themselves. After a long stretch of silence,\
  \ he nodded once. Calerio seemed relieved and seemed to breathe a little easier.\
  \ “Thank you.”</p> \n     <p>“Do not thank me just yet,” came the elf’s scornful\
  \ voice. “We may be traveling companions for now, but Zon-Kuthon will get his due,\
  \ and you will be made to pay for each slight against him.” The elf’s long, white\
  \ hair shone, waterlike, as he nodded towards the extinguished fire. His pink eyes\
  \ lifted and rested on Marcus, then. “You both will.” The shadow-hound licked his\
  \ chops at <em>Marcus</em>.</p> \n     <p>Marcus felt his stomach sink. Suddenly,\
  \ he wasn’t so relieved for the mission’s success. He’d have many questions for\
  \ Calerio, once they were alone – if they ever would be, again.</p> \n     <p>They\
  \ wouldn’t.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
