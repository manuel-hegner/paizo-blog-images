  \     <p>Salutations.</p> \n     <p>My name is Brian Campbell, and I'm writing to\
  \ you as the new Lead Editor for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</a>. I am ancient. \"I have crossed oceans of time...\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Okay, so maybe I'm not so ancient, but I've been working in the game\
  \ industry as a writer and editor for the last twenty years. One of my first jobs\
  \ was editing trading card games for a company down in Renton, Washington, one that\
  \ shall remain nameless here, although it is known for being magical from time to\
  \ time. It has a lot of magic, and some of its cards are magic cards, but I won't\
  \ tell you which company it is.</p> \n     <p>I first started playing Pathfinder\
  \ around the same time I was working in a different department of that company,\
  \ one that made roleplaying games with dragons and dungeons. Since then, I indulged\
  \ in my obsession with massively multiplayer online games by writing for a few of\
  \ them, but I kept playing Pathfinder. I now spend my time sequestered in an arcane\
  \ realm scrutinizing the wording on cards, which is precisely where I should be.\
  \ In my spare time, I play different types of games, read books on my Kindle, and\
  \ contemplate the mysteries of the universe while drinking various microbrews. And\
  \ of course, you might see me playing cards.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p align=\"\
  Center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hello, Pathfinders!</p> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ Tanis O'Connor, the new adventure card game designer here at Paizo HQ. I work\
  \ with Paizo's incredible staff of designers, developers, and editors, and also\
  \ with the PACG design team at Lone Shark Games. Alongside Brian Campbell, introduced\
  \ above, and the estimable Vic Wertz, I'm doing my best to make the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game the best game possible. I'm also working on a few other goodies which\
  \ will be the subject of a near-future blog post.</p> \n     <p>A little bit about\
  \ me: prior to signing up with Team Paizo, I was a developer on the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game for Lone Shark Games, and worked on both the <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> set and the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\">Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</a> set. My involvement in the RPG community goes back over a decade,\
  \ including a stint as a developer and rules editor at Wizards of the Coast, and\
  \ several years as an author, developer, and organizer for the March of Bissel in\
  \ the RPGA's Living Greyhawk Organized Play campaign. I'm psyched to be working\
  \ with the amazing and creative team here at Paizo.</p> \n     <p>Enough about me;\
  \ let's talk about you! We have a bunch of good stuff in store for you with the\
  \ upcoming Skull &amp; Shackles set, beginning with an entirely new playable character\
  \ for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, to be released as a promotional card set\
  \ for <a href=\"http://www.freerpgday.com\">Free RPG Day</a> on Saturday, June 21.\
  \ Everyone, meet Ranzak:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ <p>Ranzak is a nasty little bugger who likes eating, stabbing, and stealing (not\
  \ necessarily in that order). Like any other character, he comes complete with character,\
  \ role, and token cards, and he can be used with any Pathfinder ACG set, so feel\
  \ free to let him pillage his way through Rise of the Runelords while you're waiting\
  \ for Skull &amp; Shackles to come out! There will be a few different ways you can\
  \ pick up Ranzak:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Go to a store that's participating\
  \ in Free RPG Day on June 21 and get yourself a free copy while supplies last. Find\
  \ your local store <a href=\"http://www.freerpgday.com/stores.htm\">here</a>.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Subscribe to the Adventure Card Game <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription\"\
  >here on paizo.com</a>, and you'll get a free copy of Ranzak (as well as a couple\
  \ other promo cards) along with your <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\">Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles Base Set</a> and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy92zk\">Character\
  \ Add-On Deck</a> in August.</li> \n      <li>After Skull &amp; Shackles is released\
  \ in August, buy Ranzak on paizo.com, while supplies last.</li> \n      <li>Buy\
  \ Ranzak from us at <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> or Gen Con,\
  \ while supplies last.</li>\n     </ul>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>Below you'll find\
  \ Ranzak's story, in his own words.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p align=\"Center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Ranzak not always pirate. Ranzak not always\
  \ Ranzak either. One time, Ranzak be Longlung diver named Squidbreath. Other Longlungs\
  \ eaten by biggest sea monster of all—Swirly Doom. Squidbreath fierce and Squidbreath\
  \ brave, so Squidbreath flee Swirly Doom and paddle mighty Longlung ship away. Years\
  \ pass. Squidbreath stab. Squidbreath steal. Squidbreath eat good Squidbreath meal!</p>\

  \ have to tell you?)\n     </div> \n     <p>Squidbreath make friends to do battles\
  \ on goblin ship. Friends eat many pirates, get many loots. Squidbreath see longshanks\
  \ chiefs all have magic bird that eat cracker and tell true secret. Squidbreath\
  \ and friends sneak sneak sneak to longshanks cave, wait for longshanks sleep, and\
  \ steal magic bird. Magic bird squawk, \"Ranzak! Ranzak! Ranzak! Ranzak! Ranzak!\"\
  \ Magic bird maybe talk too much.</p> \n     <p>Squidbreath know magic bird always\
  \ squawk true, so Squidbreath make name Ranzak. Ranzak now have great magic, and\
  \ friends jealous. Friends have bad luck on many ends of many knives. Now Ranzak\
  \ need new friends to help get more plunder!</p> \n     <p>You need friend?</p>\
