  \ counting until the start of Gen Con 2010 and the release of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>. If you have not already done so, you might\
  \ want to reserve it with your FLGS or order online now. To help encourage you to\
  \ pick up this hefty tome, I am giving you a guided tour of the goodies inside.\
  \ In the past weeks we have looked at some new race and class material. This week\
  \ we will be jumping around quite a bit, looking at feats, gear, spells, and magic\
  \ items. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's get going.</p> \n  </blockquote>\

  \ \n   <p>Starting out with Chapter 3, let's take a look at feats. This 26-page\
  \ chapter is loaded down with 163 new feats, from combat and metamagic feats, the\
  \ new teamwork feats that grant large bonuses when you and an ally use them together.\
  \ But that's not all, not by a long shot. There are a host of feats in this chapter\
  \ designed to let you add to your existing class features, like Extra Rage Power\
  \ and Extra Hex. There are also a host of feats based on your race, like this one.</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Ironguts</b><br> You have an especially strong stomach.<br>\
  \ <b>Prerequsitites</b>: Con 13; dwarf, half-orc, orc.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: You gain\
  \ a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against any effect causing the nauseated or\
  \ sickened conditions and against all ingested poisons (but not other poisons).\
  \ In addition, you receive a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks to find food for\
  \ yourself.</p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>As was mentioned at the preview banquet,\
  \ a number of the powers of the 3.5 archmage prestige class have found their way\
  \ into the Pathfinder RPG as feats that most spellcasters can take. Take a look\
  \ at Minor Spell Expertise.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Minor Spell\
  \ Expertise</b><br> You are able to cast a 1st-level spell as a spell-like ability<br>\
  \ <b>Prerequsite</b>: Ability to cast 4th-level spells.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: Chose\
  \ one 1st-level spell that you know. You may cast that spell twice per day as a\
  \ spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your\
  \ caster level in that class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like\
  \ ability's save DC is Charisma-based. You cannot apply metatmagic feats to this\
  \ spell.</p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Moving on from feats, the gear chapter is\
  \ short, but jam-packed with new tools and tricks to help properly equip your character.\
  \ From an Lucerne hammer to wooden armor, from an hourglass to rope made from spider\
  \ silk, there's plenty here for everyone. There are also a lot of tools for each\
  \ of the new classes, including the portable alchemist's lab and the witch's cauldron.\
  \ What has me most excited is the wealth of alchemical items in the book. Take a\
  \ look at this gem.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Weapon Blanch (adamantine,\
  \ cold iron, or silver)</b>: These alchemical powders have a gritty consistency.\
  \ When poured on a weapon and placed over a hot flame for a full round, they melt\
  \ and form a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the\
  \ ability to bypass one kind of material based damage reduction, depending on its\
  \ type. The blanching remains effective until the weapon makes a successful attack.\
  \ Each dose of blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only\
  \ one type of blanch can be used on a weapon at one time, although if the weapon\
  \ is made of a special material, that material still applies.</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\

  \ \n   <p>Next up is a rather large chapter on spells. Discounting the tables at\
  \ the beginning, there are 57 pages of spells here, containing spells for characters\
  \ of every class and every level. This chapter also includes the elemental spell\
  \ lists for those wizards who wish to focus on elemental schools of magic. Let's\
  \ take a look at a spell that I am particularly excited to use on my players. It\
  \ might not be incredibly powerful, but it is a lot of fun.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Enemy Hammer</b><br> <b>School</b> Transmutation; <b>Level</b> sorcerer/wizard\
  \ 6<br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Range</b> long (400 ft. + 40\
  \ ft./level)<br> <b>Target</b> one creature<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round/level (D)<br>\
  \ <b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude partial; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes<br> You grab\
  \ a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby opponents or objects.\
  \ You must target a specific creature when casting this spell, and once you select\
  \ that creature, you cannot switch to another. Each round, as a standard action,\
  \ you can attempt to hurl the target at any creature or object within 30 feet of\
  \ it. You must make an attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon. The\
  \ attack bonus for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence\
  \ or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target\
  \ with the creature, both it and the creature take damage based on the creature's\
  \ size (Fine 1d4, Diminutive 1d6, Tiny 1d8, Small 1d10, Medium 2d6, Large 2d8, Huge\
  \ 2d10, Gargantuan 3d6, Colossal 3d8). The target creature can make a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw each time you attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving\
  \ throw, it can act normally, but if it fails its save, it loses all action for\
  \ the round and ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack.</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Finally, this book contains a large chapter containing\
  \ all sorts of magic items, from inexpensive <i>soul soap</i> to the mighty <i>cloud\
  \ castle of the storm king</i>. Of course, it's not all wonderful. There are a host\
  \ of new cursed items to inflict upon your PCs, lurking in this book. Take a look\
  \ at <i>ring of truth</i>.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Ring of Truth</b><br>\
  \ <b>Aura</b> moderate enchantment; <b>CL</b> 9th<br> <b>Slot</b> ring; <b>Weight</b>\
  \ â€”<br> Deceptively pleasant looking, a <i>ring of truth</i> bears images of childlike\
  \ angels and broadly smiling divine creatures holding onto links of a heavy chain.\
  \ The wearer of this cursed ring is rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in\
  \ either speech or writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not to\
  \ communicate, but even then must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw to avoid\
  \ answering a direct question truthfully.</p>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>And there\
  \ you go. The <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>\
  \ is just two weeks away now. Next week's preview will be the last before release,\
  \ so we will wrap up our tour of the book by looking at the new prestige classes\
  \ and new rules systems hiding in this book.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead\
