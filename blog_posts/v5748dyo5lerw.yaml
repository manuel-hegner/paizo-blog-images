  >The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Adventure Path</a> features a lot of \"proper\" <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lepe\"\
  >devils from the Hells</a>, but it also features a LOT of SEA devils. While these\
  \ aquatic menaces are not lawful evil outsiders proper, their sharp teeth and evil\
  \ looks make the name fit quite well. WizKids did a great job translating these\
  \ creatures into prepainted plastic for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder Battles figures, and I'm thrilled to show\
  \ them all to you today.</span></p> \n     <p>As we continue to do these sets, it\
  \ becomes more and more clear to me that I should take the opportunity to do as\
  \ many of the same type of creature at the same time that I can. That way, similar\
  \ creatures look \"of a kind\" to one another because they're based on unified art,\
  \ and are often sculpted by the same sculptor. Likewise, all similar figures are\
  \ painted based on paint masters painted by the same artist (in this case the excellent\
  \ Chris Hart, who also did all the masters for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"\
  >Shattered Star</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ sets.</p> \n     <p>Here's an early look at three of those paint masters for the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ member of this hideous undersea race. Watch out for his trident. It's pokey. This\
  \ is a Medium common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ invasion force with this Sea Devil Champion, also Medium and also common.</p>\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Every invasion force needs a leader, and in this\
  \ case we've got The Matron, one of the greatest figures in the Pathfinder Battles\
  \ line according to yours truly and all the folks here at Paizo who have seen it.\
  \ Chris really did a great job on the painting for her, and you guys are going to\
  \ freak when you have her in hand. This Large figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That's it for this week. <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Set up an ongoing\
  \ Pathfinder Battles subscription</a> today to make sure you don't miss a single\
  \ figure! The full set is slated to release this summer!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
