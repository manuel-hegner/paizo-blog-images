  \ we celebrate the fathers and father figures in our community. As we pause to honor\
  \ and reflect on fathers of all kinds, we also recognize the many different feelings\
  \ and memories that arise from this day. Whatever Father’s Day means to you, and\
  \ wherever you are in the difficult journey of fatherhood, know that we’re grateful.\
  \ Whether you’re a father (or father figure), have a father, or have memories of\
  \ your father, and whatever those experiences may mean to you, fatherhood is one\
  \ of the things that binds most of us together—wherever, whenever, and whoever we\
  \ are.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/89b15be8-fc14-40b5-bddf-a4d6c189ab9c/CommunityBlogFullimage.jpg\"\

  s Day blog, I accepted right away, knowing it would be relatively straightforward\
  \ to come up with some clever gaming puns or some Father’s Day gifts in the form\
  \ of silly magic items. (What dad doesn’t want a pair of argyle socks that magically\
  \ clean and fold themselves?) Over the coming days, as I reflected on my five years\
  \ of fatherhood (and counting), and on my own father, trying to come up with more\
  \ ideas for a roleplaying game-related Father’s Day blog, I realized jokes were\
  \ my easy way out. Surely, I thought, I could write something deep and meaningful\
  \ about my first RPG session with my five-year-old son. So, this past weekend, I\
  \ sat down to plan a game for him. That also would not turn out exactly as I planned.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I felt intense pressure to get it right. I wanted something great to\
  \ write about for the blog, of course, but I also needed it to be right for my son.\
  \ After all, I thought, roleplaying games have deeply impacted my own life. My brother\
  \ and I remain close, even into adulthood, in no small part because of roleplaying\
  \ games. I met my spouse and my dearest friends through roleplaying games. Playing\
  \ and writing those games has gotten me through many difficult times. I’ve seen\
  \ tabletop games have a similar impact on countless others. I had to be a great\
  \ dad and get it right for my son.</p> \n     <p>I faltered. How could I ever meet\
  \ such expectations? Thinking of roleplaying games and fatherhood reminded me that\
  \ my brother and I started playing right around the time our own father began to\
  \ have less presence in our lives. This only increased the pressure I was putting\
  \ on myself. At a time in my life when I most needed a father, roleplaying games\
  \ filled the void in a way. Roleplaying games helped me learn collaboration, cooperation,\
  \ creativity, resilience, compassion—and even provided an outlet for pent up emotions.\
  \ (Speaking of things we can learn from our dads. Ha.)</p> \n     <p>The day before\
  \ I’d planned to run my son’s first session, I was tired, dinner was over, and it\
  \ was time to play before getting ready for bed. I wasn’t thinking about the blog,\
  \ and my complex emotions about fatherhood meant I had no plans for the game. When\
  \ my son and I went to play, one of the most surreal experiences of my life unfolded.\
  \ He asked if I wanted to build a maze with him using some magnetic tiles—one of\
  \ his favorite toys. Of course, I said, but you’ll need to show me how. He laid\
  \ out a basic floor plan. He put up some walls. I watched as he carefully considered\
  \ the placement of each tile, occasionally changing his mind about the direction\
  \ of a given corridor, or where the entrance would be. He blocked off one of the\
  \ paths and told me that’s where the bad guys hide. You had to sneak past, or they’\
  d come out and get you. He went to get his toy cars—they’d fit perfectly in the\
  \ maze. He put in a few bad guys. He put another in the deepest part of the maze\
  \ and told me I had to rescue it. He gave me another car, said it was me, and picked\
  \ up one for himself. He drove through the maze, arrived at an intersection, and\
  \ asked me which way we should go. Your turn, Papa. We went through the maze. We\
  \ laughed when I was too loud, and the bad guy popped out of the wall to get me.\
  \ I escaped and drove around until the bad guy got lost in his own maze. Good job,\
  \ Papa, but you should be more quiet next time. We went and rescued the car. We\
  \ made it out before the bad guy found us—but just barely!</p> \n     <p>Without\
  \ ever having learned himself, my son taught me to play an RPG on a whim, with a\
  \ map and secret doors and all. He had a story in mind—one he came up with on his\
  \ own—and we worked together to tell the story. He taught me to try again even when\
  \ I messed up. He taught me to take turns and look out for each other. When he suggested\
  \ I fight the bad guy car, and I asked if we could be gentle instead, he respected\
  \ the boundary I set. He told me that was a good idea and helped me find a creative\
  \ solution. </p> \n     <p>This was not so different from the way we usually play,\
  \ but with the uncanny similarities to sitting down for a game of Pathfinder or\
  \ Starfinder, I was stunned. Thinking on it, I didn’t know exactly how my son learned\
  \ all those things—collaboration, compassion, creativity—especially when his access\
  \ to other adults over the past year has been far more limited than usual. Surely,\
  \ he learned a bit from me, but also from his mother, friends, grandparents, teachers,\
  \ and from aunts and uncles. As I tucked him in and he told me, “Papa, I love you,\
  \ you’re my best friend,” I was somewhat confident he learned to spontaneously express\
  \ his feelings because I’d modeled it for him. I didn’t think I could take full\
  \ credit for all of the other things, but I was certain that roleplaying games helped\
  \ me become the sort of father who could raise a good man. Of course, I still didn’\
  t have good ideas for his first “real” session.</p> \n     <p>But I sure did know\
  \ what I was going to write about for the Father’s Day blog.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
