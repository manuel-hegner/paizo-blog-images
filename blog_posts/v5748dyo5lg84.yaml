  description\">One of my favorite things about the \"open\" theme of November's <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> set of prepainted plastic <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures is that\
  \ it allows me to do pretty much whatever I want. Unlike sets based on a specific\
  \ Adventure Path, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> does not require\
  \ a certain number of Russian soldiers, or very specific and unusual monsters key\
  \ to an important encounter in a campaign. The loose theme of \"wilderness area\
  \ in Varisia\" is enough to play home to high-utility figures based on amazing drawings,\
  \ with pretty much no other restrictions on what to include in the set.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>That said, setting the set loosely in Varisia means that it shares territory\
  \ with several of our popular Pathfinder Adventure Path campaigns, including <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords</a>.\
  \ The latter two campaigns have already received a dedicated <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set, and they include some of my favorite figures we've\
  \ produced to date.</p> \n     <p>They also, unfortunately, have some holes. Today's\
  \ preview focuses on three figures that fill specific holes from Rise of the Runelords,\
  \ and there are more coming (sadly, Shattered Star holes will have to be filled\
  \ with a different set some time in the future). While the theme of the set allows\
  \ for some revisiting old friends and foes, that isn't the primary point of the\
  \ set—I've got to be careful with my choices.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The elf cleric Justice Ironbriar is\
  \ a member of the ruling elite of the city of Magnimar, making him travel in some\
  \ of the same circles as last week's <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg74\">Lord\
  \ Mayor Grobaras</a>. He plays an important and spoiler-filled role in the finale\
  \ of Richard Pett's popular adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy8029\">The Skinsaw\
  \ Murders</a>, and it's always bothered me that we never made a miniature of him.\
  \ Quality art for the character came in while we were putting together the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8tc0\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</a> hardcover, making\
  \ it too late to make the cut for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</a> miniatures set. Now, with <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost\
  \ Coast</a>, I finally have a chance to rectify that omission. Justice Ironbriar\
  \ is suitable for any knife-wielding cultist, for a well-armed elf dignitary, or\
  \ even for a player character. Justice Ironbriar is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_GoblinMutant_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_GoblinMutant_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We've done a lot of goblins so far in <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>, but to date we've\
  \ never done a proper Goblin Mutant. Goblin Mutants play an important role in the\
  \ first arc of the <a href=\"/products/btpy921r\">Pathfinder Comic: Dark Waters\
  \ Rising</a>, and of course they also play a role in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>. In particular, this specific Goblin Mutant\
  \ is Koruvus. Koruvus's original illustration, to put it kindly, was nearly impossible\
  \ to translate into a little plastic figure, so I was really pleased when a much-easier-to-sculpt\
  \ drawing of the character came in for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\">Rise of\
  \ the Runelords Anniversary Edition</a> hardcover. Again, however, it arrived too\
  \ late to make it into that set, so the poor Goblin Mutant has had to (somewhat\
  \ impatiently) await its turn. The Goblin Mutant is a Medium (yes, Medium—he's a\
  \ mutant!), uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_MalugusKreeg_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_MalugusKreeg_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This here is Malugus Kreeg, one of the ugliest\
  \ members of the Kreeg clan (his brother, <a href=\"/products/btpy8sfc\">Jaagrath\
  \ Kreeg</a> also appears in the Rise of the Runelords set). Honestly paunchy old\
  \ Malugus is in this set simply because I love the looks of him. I hope you'll indulge\
  \ me one more ogre in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> line. The art was so awesome I couldn't resist. Malugus Kreeg is an\
  \ uncommon, Large figure.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of irresistible art, I unfortunately\
  \ was not able to get a good picture of the infamous Mammy Graul in time for this\
  \ set, so there's at least one more ogre in the offing before I close the book on\
  \ them. That will have to await a future set. Something to look forward to!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Speaking of looking forward... we've got three more <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a> figures to preview next week. I'll see you in this space in\
  \ seven days!</p> \n     <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br \\\
