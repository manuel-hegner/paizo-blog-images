  https://paizo.com/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/miniatures/pathfinderbattles/cityOfLostOmens\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles: City of Lost Omens</a> set of prepainted plastic miniatures\
  \ from our friends at WizKids. As each of our previews thus far have featured a\
  \ theme, I couldn’t resist finishing out the series with a look at some of the monstrous\
  \ inhabitants of the Isle of Kortos who can challenge parties venturing beyond Absalom’\
  s impenetrable walls.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \      </div> \n      <p>Three major groups of mythological creatures make their\
  \ homes on the planes and mountains of the Isle of Kortos, so it seemed only fitting\
  \ to ensure they were each represented in this set. First among them are the centaurs,\
  \ who are not as openly hostile as the other two but who nevertheless keep a wide\
  \ berth between themselves and the humanoids of Absalom. Taking advantage of our\
  \ final “weapon swap” slot in the set, the Centaur Outrider, comes in both sword-\
  \ and spear-wielding varieties, each taking up one of the Large uncommon rarity\
  \ spots in the set.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/060820_Centaur_Outrider_A.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"40%\" src=\"https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/060820_Centaur_Outrider_A.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n    \
  \  <p>Next are the minotaurs, brought to the Isle of Kortos by the legendary general,\
  \ Voradni Voon, in the 23 AR when he started the first siege on the newly founded\
  \ Absalom. While Voon doesn’t appear in this set (though now that I’ve mentioned\
  \ it, I’m sure Erik will mandate that he appear in a future release), we nevertheless\
  \ couldn’t do the Starstone Isle without at least one. This is far from the first\
  \ minotaur we’ve included in Pathfinder Battles sets, but is the first since the\
  \ release of Pathfinder Second Edition. The Minotaur is a Large uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/060820_Minotaur.jpg\"\
  ><img width=\"40%\" src=\"https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/060820_Minotaur.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n    \
  \  <p>Last among the creatures historically said to live among the Kortos Mounts\
  \ are the sinister harpies, whose songs mean death to any who venture too close\
  \ to their aeries. The Pathfinder Bestiary presented a male harpy as its featured\
  \ illustration, so we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to represent that for the\
  \ first time in glorious plastic. The Harpy is a Medium common figure. We also requested\
  \ WizKids make us a “tropical” version of the same figure, with darker skin and\
  \ more colorful plumage. To my knowledge, we’ve never explicitly said that harpies\
  \ living in the jungle or on the rocky shores of tropical islands don’t take after\
  \ the local humanoid and avian populations in their coloration, so why not? These\
  \ variant harpies will be released as a promotional figure at a future date that\
  \ is yet to be determined.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \  <p>Not all threats on the Isle of Kortos have their own societies like the centaurs,\
  \ minotaurs, and harpies do. Some are just mindless beasts created in ages past\
  \ from the corpses of soldiers felled in failed sieges upon the City at the Center\
  \ of the World. One such menace is the Zombie Brute, a Large uncommon figure. This\
  \ gross guy features perhaps my favorite take on zombies in any medium because it\
  \ has apparently ripped its arm out of its socket and now wields the appendage as\
  \ a club. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/060820_Zombie_Brute.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n    \
  \  <p>The next two figures are decidedly less person-shaped. One is a staple of\
  \ fantasy gaming since the turn of the millennia, and the other is a new creation\
  \ in Pathfinder Second Editon. Here is the Chu’ulothi, a Large uncommon figure,\
  \ perfect for challenging parties sailing the seas or exploring the coastline of\
  \ the Starstone Isle, and the Krooth, also a Large uncommon offering, also known\
  \ as a crocodile eater. Since none of the players at your table are playing crocodile\
  \ characters, they’ll be fine, I’m sure.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <p>Okay, I’ll admit it. I couldn’t quite find a fit in these themed blogs for\
  \ every figure in the set. Four figures and one piece of dungeon dressing just didn’\
  t make sense anywhere else. So here they are, to round out our previews of the set.\
  \ First is the Glimmerling, an urban fey creature that looks an awful lot like a\
  \ street urchin. He’s a Small common. Next is the Knight of the Aeon Star, a Medium\
  \ uncommon figure. Note her crystalline sword. That’s a replica of the sword Aroden\
  \ wielded. Maybe we’ll do <a href=\"“https://paizo.com/products/btq01zrc?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Dead-Gods-Hand\"\
  >an adventure</a> featuring that soon! If you look closely at the cover of said\
  \ adventure, you’ll note a statue of a famous (not to mention dead) founder of the\
  \ city. Now you can include this statue in your games, especially that forthcoming\
  \ adventure I mentioned before.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      \

  \  <p>Our last two figures are among the most impressive in the set, both Medium\
  \ rare offerings. Behold the Naiad Queen and Balisse Angel. While not likely enemies\
  \ to a band of good-intentioned adventurers, neither is a creature you particularly\
  \ want to cross.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/060820_Naiad_Queen.jpg\"\
