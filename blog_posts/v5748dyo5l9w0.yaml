  \ Fear the Reavers</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 17, 2008</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Well, folks, it's finally here. One year and three books later, we've\
  \ reached the last of Leigh Brackett's amazing <a href=\"/search?q=stark+brackett&amp;what=all&quot;\"\
  >Eric John Stark novels</a>, which began with our introduction to the wildman-turned-mercenary\
  \ in <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8f&quot;\"><i>The Secret of Sinharat</i></a>\
  \ and continued in her epic Skaith trilogy. In <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x7&quot;\"\
  ><i>The Reavers of Skaith</i></a>, her final installment on the world of the dying\
  \ ginger star, Brackett doesn't pull any punches. Not only do we get more strange\
  \ landscapes, more epic battles, and more alien cultures (such as the vicious Kings\
  \ of the White Islands, with their seal-towed iceberg ships containing the frozen\
  \ corpses of their ancestors), but Brackett gives us something that few authors\
  \ of her era were willing to: a sense of fear.</p> \n   <p>While I wouldn't dare\
  \ give out spoilers, I have to say that I respect an author who can, after multiple\
  \ novels with the same characters, allow some of them to fail in their quests or\
  \ die for the good of the story. All it takes is one quality death scene to break\
  \ through the reader's warm sense of security, and after that it's a nail-biting\
  \ page turner as you suddenly realize that the author could <i>kill off anybody\
  \ she wants to</i>. This is her world, and there are no rules. No one is safe. Complacency\
  \ is a terrible thing in a story, and it's fabulous to see a sword and planet author\
  \ that isn't afraid to toy with the reader's emotions a little.</p> \n   <p>Some\
  \ series lurch to a halt, others grind on long after the magic is gone. In <a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy83x7&quot;\"><i>The Reavers of Skaith</i></a>, Leigh Brackett\
  \ shows her chops by bringing more than a thousand pages of adventure to an elegant,\
  \ satisfying close. It's not saccharine—Brackett's too much of a realist for that.\
  \ As with our world, some people win and some people lose, and those results don't\
  \ always line up neatly along the axis of good versus evil. But there can be no\
  \ question that, as you turn that last page, you come away with a new world that\
  \ is all the more real for its grittiness—a living, breathing place. This is the\
  \ gift of Leigh Brackett, and a fitting end to the Eric John Stark books.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Enjoy.</p> \n   <p>James Sutter<br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p> \n \
