  http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con Indy</a> has become, it's not hard\
  \ to say that the show has something for everyone. If it's a game or style of gaming\
  \ you're looking for, you're more likely than not to find it there. The convention's\
  \ courting of younger fans, families, and even non-gamers has gone a long way in\
  \ making the show feel like an event for everyone. In the past several years, Gen\
  \ Con has grown into a fantastic meeting place for gamers of all shapes, genders,\
  \ sexual preferences, ethnicities, and ages. If you love gaming, there's sure to\
  \ be a community at Gen Con for you.</p> \n     <p>This year, though, Gen Con's\
  \ vociferous welcome to gamers of all stripes proved to be about more than just\
  \ marketing.</p> \n     <p>In March, when Indiana passed its controversial SB 101\
  \ bill—which, in part, protects businesses that wish to discriminate against same-sex\
  \ couples—Gen Con wasn't quiet about it. The company issued a letter to Indiana's\
  \ Governor Mike Pence, asking that he reconsider his support of the bill. They went\
  \ on to explain that \"Legislation that could allow for refusal of service or discrimination\
  \ against our attendees will have a direct negative impact on the state's economy,\
  \ and will factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state\
  \ of Indiana in future years.\" As the largest annual convention held at the Indianapolis\
  \ Convention Center—one that draws an estimated 50 million dollars to the city—\
  Gen Con has some weight to put behind its words. That said, the convention also\
  \ has a contract with the city of Indianapolis that lasts until 2020, so whatever\
  \ action Gen Con chooses to take in response to SB 101—which remains Indiana state\
  \ law—will take some time. Acknowledging such, Gen Con CEO and Owner Adrian Swartout\
  \ issued a letter to Gen Con attendees, restating the convention's commitment to\
  \ inclusivity and asking con-goers to contact Gen Con regarding both positive and\
  \ negative experiences they have with local hospitality (<a href=\"http://files.gencon.com/Letter_to_Attendees.pdf_\"\
  >you can see the complete letter here</a>).</p> \n     <p>As a young gamer, Gen\
  \ Con always felt like a place where I was accepted for who I was. Today, as a married\
  \ gay man, it still does. I've always had an especially warm welcome in Indianapolis,\
  \ and I don't see the passage of March's law changing that. At the same time, though,\
  \ I also can't overstate how much I appreciate Gen Con standing up for all its attendees.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150707-Photo.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150707-Photo_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>For the past several years it's been my honor to be\
  \ a panelist on the popular Queer as a Three-Sided Die seminar, as well as on Paizo's\
  \ own Diversity in Gaming panel. These discussions and events like them have been\
  \ forums for enthusiastic feedback and invaluable criticism. They've been eye-opening\
  \ and, at times, emotional experiences attended by folks who haven't always felt\
  \ welcomed by their own fandoms. They've helped calibrate my perspective as a writer,\
  \ game maker, and editor, and have had a direct, positive impact on the content\
  \ of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. And they've all happened with the help of\
  \ the supportive, earnest allies at Gen Con—both those who make the show happen\
  \ and those who come to the show year after year. These events have become highlights\
  \ of the show for me, not just because they're tremendously energetic, but because\
  \ they've been a way to prove that, no matter who you are, you're absolutely welcome\
  \ at the game table.</p> \n     <p>This year, I expect Gen Con to be the same as\
  \ it always is—filled with amazing people, awesome events, and a community that\
  \ knows what's really important: having great times with the people you care about.\
  \ But even though this year has been filled with fantastic changes for many, that\
  \ doesn't mean that your support or that of events like Gen Con is any less important.\
  \ So be sure to swing by any of the great diversity or LGBTQ events going on at\
  \ the show (a few can be found at <a href=\"http://www.tabletopgaymers.org/conventions/gencon/events-2015/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">TabletopGaymers.org</a>, but be sure to post others you know\
  \ of in the comments below). You can also nab your very own rainbow Gaymer ribbon\
  \ at the Rogue Judges HQ table in Hall C—I know I'll have mine.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ Gen Con is so dedicated to fostering one big welcoming gamer community—well, for\
  \ me, that's part of what really makes it the Best Four Days in Gaming.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Hope to see you all in Indy!</p> \n     <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\
