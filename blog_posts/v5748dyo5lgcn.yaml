  \ by Wayne Reynolds\n     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>It's a sorry lot\
  \ for a proud dwarven daughter to be raised a miserable dwarven son, but everyone\
  \ receives one lot in life, and Shardra Geltl never knew to expect better. Childhood\
  \ was kind, her sisters loved her, her brother protected her, and always she had\
  \ the whispers of tools and books to keep her company. Adolescence, though, came\
  \ bearing heavy burdens. Her siblings moved on with their own lives, replaced by\
  \ harsh teachers and taskmasters. She weathered a staggeringly awkward first kiss\
  \ as her childhood best friend grew into a handsome lad, followed by a painful arranged\
  \ engagement to a lovely girl from the neighboring Dechl clan. But the mines and\
  \ refinery of Xolgrit fed the war machine of Rolgrimmdur far above, and militant\
  \ efficiency demanded all citizen-soldiers accept and excel in their roles, no matter\
  \ how miserable.</p> \n      <p>But Shardra still had the whispers to keep her company\
  \ on lonely nights.</p> \n      <p>Books quipped bits and pieces of their tales,\
  \ bowls jabbered gossip shared over breakfast, and picks stammered the poems of\
  \ the rocks they clove. And while the odds and ends of Xolgrit kept her company,\
  \ the stones of the Old Road, carved long ago by dwarves still hunting for the sky,\
  \ sang legends. More and more often, the shy dwarf slipped away to wander the crumbling\
  \ paths, learning the deeds of her ancestors away from the clamor of duty and expectation.\
  \ She assumed the whispers were her friends, there to keep her safe and offer respite\
  \ from the dull ache of life. Then one \"trustworthy\" stone crumbled beneath her\
  \ feet, dropping her into darkness.</p> \n      <p>The fall was short. Her arm met\
  \ stone with a wet crunch, but the ache from the shattered bone faded away as the\
  \ whispers rose in deafening song. All around stretched an ancient cavern. Hot springs\
  \ bubbled across its floor, while mosaics and beaten gold masks decorated the walls.\
  \ Mundane beasts and fantastic creatures wandered past, unperturbed by her presence.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>A single tuatara waddled forward as she cradled her limb. It borrowed\
  \ a tongue from the whispers and spoke. \"What are you?\"</p> \n      <p>\"I—\"\
  \ She opened her mouth to speak, borrowing too from those old, quiet chants. And\
  \ although the whispers had a word for all things in creation, they had no words\
  \ for the expectations of others. \"I don't know.\"</p> \n      <p>From that day\
  \ on, the whispers poured themselves through Shardra's reptilian friend, speaking\
  \ louder and more clearly with a mouth to form the words. She soon named the creature\
  \ Kolo—an old dwarven word for the beauty in everyday things—and told Kolo of Xolgrit\
  \ and Rolgrimmdur, and of the beauty of the stars in the night sky, and how to tell\
  \ past and present and future apart. And Kolo taught her how to speak to spirits\
  \ and borrow their favor to mend her broken bones, and of dwarven faith from long\
  \ before they mingled their worship with the deities of the surface world. It taught\
  \ her how to glean deeper secrets from the artifacts of the dead, and how to greet\
  \ the Ladies of Crag and Ember—powerful elementals who laid claim to the hot springs\
  \ and the surrounding tunnels. Most precious of all, Kolo taught her of the rivethun—\
  dwarves who drew great power by embracing the disjunction between their bodies and\
  \ souls—and she learned to brew the alchemical tinctures her past sisters used to\
  \ quiet the rages of adolescence and bring their minds and bodies into harmony.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As Shardra's mystical skills and budding femininity began to show,\
  \ her parents lamented their loss of a son and the addition of yet another dowry.\
  \ Their irritation changed to joy as their daughter's dealings with the spirit world\
  \ guided Xolgrit's miners to rich new veins of ore and long-lost treasure troves.\
  \ The Geltl clan's fortunes reversed as Shardra's confidence, skills, and womanhood\
  \ blossomed, and eventually clans from Xolgrit and beyond offered handsome brideprices.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Shardra's gifts attracted more than suitors, however. Lonely spirits\
  \ and treasure hunters alike came to Xolgrit hoping to profit by the young shaman's\
  \ insight. Neither settled peacefully into the community's rigid order. The string\
  \ of lootings, possessions, drunken brawls, hauntings, and soured beer drew the\
  \ attention of Rolgrimmdur, and the city-state dispatched a squad of soldiers—under\
  \ the command of Captain Itcel Dechl—to put down the ragtag mercenary gangs squatting\
  \ in town. Shardra herself turned her magic on its source, driving the spirit invaders\
  \ back to the hot spring and demanding the Ladies of Crag and Ember keep their subjects\
  \ under control.</p> \n      <p>Unsatisfied by her easy victory over a band of drunken\
  \ thugs and grave robbers, Captain Dechl and her soldiers traced Shardra's path\
  \ through the Old Roads, and eventually claimed the sacred shrine (and the wealth\
  \ covering its walls) as a cultural treasure for Rolgrimmdur. The elemental Ladies\
  \ raged at the presumption, swearing in turn to reduce Xolgrit to rubble. Both sides\
  \ declared the dwarf maiden a traitor and cast her aside as they charged into battle.\
  \ Shardra lashed out, seizing control of an earth elemental and using its might\
  \ to collapse the ancient shrine.</p> \n      <p>With nothing left to fight over,\
  \ the opposing armies fled.</p> \n      <p>Lacking any evidence of Shardra's actions\
  \ but burning with frustration, Dechl used what remained of her authority to accuse\
  \ the spirit-talker of heresy. Although friends and family staunchly defended her\
  \ innocence, Shardra took the allegations as a chance to act on plans that had grown\
  \ increasingly tempting. She left Xolgrit and her tutors, childhood friends, and\
  \ family by paths only the stones remembered. Shardra reached the surface a guarded\
  \ but curious woman, more interested in stories of the long dead than the bickering\
  \ of the living. With Kolo the crag tuatara at her shoulder, Shardra now wanders\
  \ the world, uncovering lost treasure and listening to the tales it has to tell.\
  \ Permanent ties still chafe, even ones as shallow as a favor owed or an unpaid\
  \ tavern bill, but her heart softens toward any who wander. Despite her love of\
  \ the world's vast mysteries, a small part of the shaman yearns for the joy and\
  \ companionship she once felt with her sisters, and Shardra corresponds with her\
  \ family often, ever watchful for any discovery that might provide an excuse to\
  \ write or visit her distant, glittering home.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Crystal\
