  re less than a week away from the January 23rd official release date for the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ fantasy figures! But with all the crazy Kickstarter stuff going on over the last\
  \ month, we’ve still got a few figures left to reveal from the set.</span></p> \n\
  \     <p>So without further ado, let’s jump right into it!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Portioque.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Portioque_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have Portioque, a wily subterranean wizard\
  \ who likes to hang out with his buddy, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldqp\">Caedimus</a>.\
  \ Like that erstwhile companion, Portioque is a common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Clockwork.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Clockwork_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The ancient Runelords of Thassilon often employed\
  \ clockwork servants, and this Clockwork Soldier, culled straight from the pages\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Bestiary 3</a> makes a compelling member of\
  \ an ancient Thassilonian fighting force. He’s also at the common rarity, so you\
  \ can work up a whole party of them to menace your player characters.</p> \n   \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-TowerGirl.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-TowerGirl_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And here we have the Tower Girl, a cunning rogue\
  \ from an all-girl gang that plays an important role in the first adventure of the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmh\">Shards of Sin</a>. She’s common as well, and also\
  \ makes a nice double for a player character rogue.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Xulgath_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here’s another ancient underground dweller we like\
  \ to call a Xulgath. This guy is also common, which would be a problem if he smelled\
  \ as bad as his Pathfinder RPG counterpart, but which is awesome for building whole\
  \ hordes of anthropomorphic subterranean lizard people. Wait until you see the paint\
  \ detail on this guy’s scales. You won’t believe he’s a common, but he is!</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-ClericOfZonKuthon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-ClericOfZonKuthon_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have a Cleric of Zon-Kuthon,\
  \ who appears in the Adventure Path as a not-altogether-unfriendly evil cleric named\
  \ Gein Kafog. We knew we wanted to depict this cleric with a chain weapon, which\
  \ can be very difficult with plastic miniatures. Our compromise was to wrap much\
  \ of the chain around his body, which certainly fits in well with a follower of\
  \ a god dedicated to pain. The Cleric of Zon-Kuthon is at the uncommon rarity.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Shriezyx.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Shriezyx_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This slavering spiderlike critter is a Shriezyx,\
  \ a horrific aberration cooked up by the ancient Runelords. A bunch of them still\
  \ dwell in the city of Magnimar (and their stats appear in <a href=\"/products/btpy8slp\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments</a>). It’s probably difficult\
  \ to tell from this photo, but I assure you that the face on this little bugger\
  \ is GROSS. This Medium figure is at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Ardathanatus.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Ardathanatus_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Believe it or not, there’s an old elf under this\
  \ evil-looking armor. I’d tell you whether your Shattered Star players will consider\
  \ him a friend or foe, but that’s spoiler territory. Suffice it to say that Ardathanatus,\
  \ a rare figure, works great as any kind of black-armored figure you might need\
  \ in any campaign. And he’s got a huge axe, too!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130118-Sheila_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week we’ve got Sheila Heidmarch, the Venture-Captain\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society’s lodge in the city of Magnimar and a patron to the\
  \ player characters throughout the Shattered Star Adventure Path. With a design\
  \ based on a cover illustration by Wayne Reynolds and a history that goes deep into\
  \ the history of Pathfinder products, this is a fun figure I’m happy to include\
  \ in the set not only because it’s beautiful, but because it will work great for\
  \ just about any female spellcaster you might need. Sheila is a rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That’s it for this week. Next week the set will actually be out and\
  \ you’ll be able to view the figures yourselves. I’ll do one more Shattered Star\
  \ blog with high-quality images a few more figures that changed paint schemes late\
  \ in the set (and hence still need to be photographed here at Paizo HQ), as well\
  \ as quality images of a few figures from much earlier that had to make do with\
  \ my shoddy iPhone camera shots for one reason or another.</p> \n     <p>And then\
  \ it’s time to start talking about the NEXT set. And the one after that. And the\
  \ one after that, and the one after that, and the one…</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
