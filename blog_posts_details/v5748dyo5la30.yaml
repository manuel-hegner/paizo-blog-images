    \ that everyone is doomed. Patrissa: Despite her overindulgences, this former\
    \ adventurer is still quite attractive, wearing a fine dress and expensive jewels.\
    \ Once locked inside the courthouse, she is certain to turn to the heroes for\
    \ protection. Sir Rekkart: (above) This staunch, aging paladin of Iomedae was\
    \ a part of the jury ten years ago, and is certain that justice was served. Persuading\
    \ him otherwise might just be an impossible task without solid proof. Tablark:\
    \ This grizzled old dwarf has held just about every job one could have in the\
    \ city of Absalom. When things seem grim, the heroes can count on this dwarf to\
    \ remain steadfast and confident in victory. Is one of these jurors to blame?\
    \ Maybe it was one of the others. Next week, I'll be back to give you a few more\
    \ suspects to investigate. Jason Bulmahn GameMastery Brand Manager"
