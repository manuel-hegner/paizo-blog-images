  \ Merisiel</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 26, 2010</p> \n    <p>Although\
  \ I can't quite yet show off the actual rules you'll be using in the Kingmaker Adventure\
  \ Path quite yet, I can show you how they look in play. Presented below is an excerpt\
  \ from Merisiel's diary as she oversees the foundation of a brand-new kingdom in\
  \ the mysterious Stolen Lands. NOTE: Merisiel's probably not the best choice in\
  \ this group for a nation's ruler, but sometimes that's just how politics work.\
  \ As time permits, I'll post a few more diary entries to this blog's messageboard\
  \ thread so we can all learn from Merisiel's triumphs and failures. Certainly there'll\
  \ be more triumphs in her future, yes?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>1 Pharast</b>:\
  \ So it looks like I'm in charge. Queen Merisiel. I like the sound of that. Although,\
  \ as Seelah is so fond of pointing out, I'm technically a baroness until this new\
  \ nation of mine grows large enough. I'm still gonna be calling myself queen in\
  \ these pages. Seelah's gonna be the general of my armies (she volunteered!), and\
  \ I put Lem in charge of keeping an eye on the citizens to make sure they're loyal\
  \ as the spymaster. And of course Kyra's our high priest. All the other leadership\
  \ roles, for now, go to some of the other locals we've allied with during the past\
  \ several months of exploring the Greenbelt. We'll see how they work out, I supposeâ€”\
  none of them seem particularly talented, but hopefully they'll grow into their jobs?\
  \ And if they don't, I can fire them. I'm the queen, after all. Anyway, we've managed\
  \ to claim a pretty sizable area around this old ruined castle that bandit lord\
  \ was using as a hideout. The ruins should work pretty well as a new castle, once\
  \ it gets patched up. We've started clearing the area around the ruins to serve\
  \ as a good place to build up a town. I'm thinking of calling it Owlbearton, after\
  \ that bandit's pet owlbear that nearly bit off Lem's ear, but Seelah says that's\
  \ a stupid name. I told her that if she comes up with something better we'll call\
  \ it that, but so far all her ideas suck. Surprise, surprise. So for now, Owlbearton\
  \ it is! We've even built some roads around the place! It's gonna be a city in no\
  \ time! Especially now that I've got some deliciously heavy taxes coming into the\
  \ treasury! Who woulda guessed that taxes could be something to be happy about?\
  \ So far, those taxes more than paid for the roads and land clearing and stuff.\
  \ Not the rebuilding of the castle, though. That's expensive, as it works out. And\
  \ while Lem says that the locals are complaining that all I'm doing is lying around\
  \ and taking it easy while they pay for my little project, and while Kyra says she\
  \ only barely managed to talk a group of farmers out of marching up to the castle\
  \ to tear it down and (their words) \"git back what we done paid for from that spendthrift\
  \ pointy-eared harlot!\" I'm not worried. Once they see how excellent this castle\
  \ looks when it's all done, they'll all forgive me. I'm sure of it!</p> \n    </blockquote>\
