  artist: "a 20-foot-tall palisade of tree trunks, upended and carved to points. Beyond\
    \ this security there is nothing but wilderness. Tall trees and endless thickets\
    \ of wild rose bushes cover much of the surrounding terrain. There are no farms\
    \ or outlying buildings affiliated with the fortâ€”any who dwell outside its walls\
    \ are hermits, monsters, or worse. The Path: This trail is being cut through the\
    \ vale to establish a vital trade route with Varisia's neighbors. It is currently\
    \ under construction and time is running out to meet the king's deadline. The\
    \ Petal and Coldrun Rivers: These two slow-moving rivers provide fresh water to\
    \ those in the region, although the Petal (which runs past Fort Thorn) has a nasty\
    \ tendency to foul every few weeks, causing sickness in those who drink"
