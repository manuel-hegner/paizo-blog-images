  \ </p> \n      <br> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>Growing up in Wyoming in the\
  \ 70s and 80s, Pride was a distant thing to me; something I’d see on the news a\
  \ few times a year. When I joined TSR in 1994, I finally had the opportunity to\
  \ attend Pride events in Milwaukee and Chicago and slowly start to understand more\
  \ about who I was. Boystown in Chicago and Club 94 near Lake Geneva were glorious\
  \ and electrifying, and I was like a wide-eyed kid marveling at every sight and\
  \ sound.</p> \n       <p>I came out to friends and co-workers by chance after getting\
  \ beaten up by my first boyfriend. I arrived at work shaking and angry, not realizing\
  \ I had blood all over my face and arms. Lorraine Williams (TSR’s owner) and Carol\
  \ Hubbard (head of HR) grabbed a first aid kit and gently patched me up as I explained\
  \ how my roommate beat me up. My friends instantly knew something else. Sean Reynolds,\
  \ David Eckelberry, and Dori Hein helped me through a pretty terrifying time and\
  \ made coming out to the world easier through their acceptance and encouragement.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Weeks later TSR would be purchased by Wizards of the Coast and Peter\
  \ Adkison, Lisa Stevens, and others ushered in a wild new work environment. Peter\
  \ gathered the TSR crew together and explained the new working environment of WotC,\
  \ with LGBTQIA+, Goth, Satanists, and more all working in harmony. “What if my religion\
  \ doesn’t allow me to work with those people?” a TSR staffer asked. Without missing\
  \ a beat, Peter said “Then you should definitely not accept the job offer to relocate\
  \ to Seattle.” You could hear a pin drop…</p> \n       <p>Lisa Stevens has continued\
  \ that positive work environment through Paizo, and as Pride shines forth again\
  \ I look back on all that has happened in my life and see the steady march of progress.\
  \ Happy Pride!</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p> <span style=\"border-top: 1px\

  \ freelanced for several third party publishers for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game,\
  \ as well as with Paizo themselves. I am 37 years old, and I have been out as bisexual\
  \ since my senior year of high school. Even before I achieved my goal of becoming\
  \ a game designer, I had the honor of others in the gaming community not only welcome\
  \ me, but follow in the footsteps of my coming out experience with experiences of\
  \ their very own.</p> \n       <p>I have the Cape and Islands Gay Straight Youth\
  \ Alliance (or CIGSYA House) to thank for providing me with a safe space when I\
  \ didn't know I needed it. What I also didn't realize—until I was much older—was\
  \ how large of an overlap these two communities really had. They are very much my\
  \ people, and in more ways than one. I couldn't ask to be in a better crowd.\"</p>\

  \       <p>“I think it's safe to say that RPGs have cracked my shell several times\
  \ over. I've never played a male character, even before I really let myself know\
  \ I wasn't a man. Starfinder's solarians gave me the grounds to explore my personal\
  \ brand of nonbinary, and developing relationships bound beyond romance and rooted\
  \ in a shared narrative showed me how, while I still experience it, it's not all\
  \ there is.</p> \n       <p>I love my work and my community. I'm proud to throw\
  \ my voice to the sky when I need to be heard. And for anyone questioning if you\

  >Vanessa Hoskins</span> </p> \n      <br> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>“The\
  \ first Pride was a riot. It was a screaming and violent stand against the forces\
  \ of oppression that sought to impose conformity and silence. Those forces of oppression\
  \ continue to fight us, continue to silence us, and continue working to enforce\
  \ their will on us. But we will not be silent. We will not hide in the shadows.\
  \ We are out. We are proud. We are celebrating who we are. The very act of public\
  \ celebration is defiance against our oppressors. The very act of love we share\
  \ builds up our communities. Every example of self expression shows the world that\
  \ we will not fade away.</p> \n       <p>Pride is taking a stand for who we are,\
  \ who we love, and making no apologies for it. Through celebration we win. Through\
  \ self expression we win. Through love we win. The oppressed stand together against\
  \ our oppressors, expressing our differences and embracing each other for it. The\
  \ more we love ourselves, the more we support each other, and the more we remain\
  \ true to who we are, the harder it is for the forces of oppression to succeed.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>They lash out in violence against our peace. They scream slurs against\
  \ our celebrations. They react with hate against our love. But that just means they\
  \ will lose, for love conquers hate. But love doesn't mean we are meak. Love doesn't\
  \ mean we are helpless. We too, can be violent. It's not what we want, but it's\
  \ what we will do to survive. We will fight back. We will take a stand. We will\
  \ maintain our way of life. Pride comes from love: from loving ourselves, from loving\
  \ each other, from loving our communities. That does not mean we won't fight to\
  \ defend that love. The first Pride was a riot.”</p> \n      </blockquote> \n  \

  \ Director of Pathfinder, and last year I wrote about how playing RPGs over the\
  \ years helped me realize I was bisexual. I also wrote, “Our world is scary, and\
  \ that makes RPGs so important to me.” Here we are a year later, and the world has\
  \ changed so much that it feels naive to have written those words only a dozen months\
  \ ago. But that doesn’t change the fact that RPGs can remain an important way for\
  \ us all to get together and game, share our experiences, and support each other,\
  \ even if… ESPECIALLY if… we’re doing so virtually instead of in-person. Pride in\
  \ ourselves and who we are is more important than ever—which is, I suppose, a way\
  \ of saying it’s more important with each passing day. So give your friends hugs,\

  \  <br> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>“As an undergraduate cultural anthropology\
  \ student, I conducted the majority of my class research on issues of gender in\
  \ gaming subcultures. During a project that aimed to ethnographically explore the\
  \ experience of self-identified “girl gamers,” I was conducting an interview with\
  \ a research participant in which we discussed her origins in gaming. She explained\
  \ that she first started playing online pet-sites, in which she got so intensely\
  \ competitive that she was setting alarms to wake up in the middle of the night\
  \ to perform tasks in the game just for an extra edge. Part way though her explanation\
  \ she asked, “Wait, does this count?”</p> \n       <p>Perplexed, I asked her, “\
  Why wouldn’t that count?”</p> \n       <p>Her answer left a profound impact on me\
  \ as an anthropologist and gamer: “Because mostly girls play those.”</p> \n    \
  \   <p> I analyzed that statement a million ways, but I think it bothered me so\
  \ much because I realized that a lot of the identity questions I was exploring in\
  \ gender and gaming came down to that question: do we count? Getting to be a part\
  \ of the gaming industry myself now, I constantly think of my own identity and all\
  \ those individuals who talked to me about their experience in gaming subcultures.\

  \ an unorthodox journey to realizing both of those things. I didn't actually realize\
  \ I was bi until well after I was in a happily committed monogamous relationship,\

  \ community as a cis bi woman partnered with a cis man.</p> \n       <p>Part of\
  \ what helped was hearing from other bi people with similar experiences, which just\
  \ goes to show why greater representation and visibility is so important. It's a\

  \    <blockquote> \n       <p>“I came to roleplaying games largely after I’d figured\
  \ out my bisexuality, so for me gaming isn’t so much a story of discovery as it\
  \ is one of getting to live out my fantasies of a world where I can truly be my\
  \ best self. Literally no character I have ever created is both heterosexual and\
  \ cisgender. I consider part of my responsibility at Paizo, with whatever platform\
  \ this position gives me, to make sure our products aren’t just inclusive, but progressive.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>I’m very lucky that I have a family who has always accepted me for\
  \ who I am. I know many others don’t have that, and that we find our own families\
  \ through these spaces. It’s important that we as a community continue to use our\
  \ positions to affirm truths: that queer people are people, and they’re here, and\
  \ they’re not obligated to hide; that trans lives matter and trans rights are human\
  \ rights; and that coming out is neither the start nor end of someone’s journey.”\
