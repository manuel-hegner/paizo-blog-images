  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n     <p>“This <em>may</em>\
  \ be it,” Aliyama stated carefully, consulting her wayfinder.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ jungle was oppressively hot and humid, yet the elf showed no signs of it. She\
  \ wore a purple, quilted doublet over silk sleeves, her cerulean cloak held by a\
  \ golden pendant. Her hair, immaculately braided, was pulled back from her angular\
  \ face revealing pointed ears adorned with yet more gold. She looked as fresh as\
  \ if she were off to a meeting at the Grand Lodge.</p> \n     <p>“’May?’” Reynold\
  \ sputtered. In stark contrast, his brown hair was plastered with sweat, his Taldan\
  \ finery wrinkled and stained. “’May!?’ There is no ‘may’ about it! Fola said the\
  \ lost Pathfinder would be in a serpentfolk ruin in the middle of the bloody Mwangi\
  \ Expanse. Sigvard sent us here to find the ruin. What do you bloody think <em>this</em>\
  \ is?!”</p> \n     <p>Aliyama looked up, arching an eyebrow. Her human compatriot\
  \ was gesturing insistently with outstretched hands to the towering stone archway\
  \ in front of them. It was flanked by enormous statues of hooded cobras, and the\
  \ stonework was mas-terful, full of whirling, intertwined lines ornately framing\
  \ an entrance into the overgrown hillside. If doors had once stood in the archway,\
  \ they were long gone. Only a darkened rectangle of shadows stood between them and\
  \ the interior.</p> \n     <p>“Much as I hate to admit it, I agree wit’ Reynold\
  \ here. This has gotta be the place,” Thri said, planting fists on hips. The fresh-faced\
  \ dwarf’s topknot barely came to her companions’ ribs. “Let’s get in and find our\
  \ missin’ Pathfinder, yeah?”</p> \n     <p> “Quite right,” Reynold nodded. “In we\
  \ go! Then back to Sigvard and her endless chores. And then, blessedly, a ship back\
  \ to glorious, civilized Absalom.”</p> \n     <p>Aliyama held up a hand. “Abadar\
  \ says that the world is filled with two kinds of people: the impulsive and the\
  \ wealthy,” she said calmly. “We must examine the facts and think.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  I think,” Reynold pointed, rolling his eyes. “That the big overgrown temple with\
  \ snakes outside is a serpentfolk ruin.”</p> \n     <p>Thri snorted.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The elf sighed. “Perhaps. But consider: the serpentfolk were one of the oldest\
  \ civilizations in Golarion. They preceded even the Azlanti. Yet do these carvings\
  \ appear worn away by the ages? Do they look as if they survived Earthfall?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Reynold opened his mouth, then snapped it shut, frowning.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“Recall that I grew up in the Mwangi,” she continued. “Left unattended, the\
  \ jungle claims everything. Everything. Were this truly an ancient serpentfolk temple,\
  \ it would be nothing but vines. The Pathfinder agent that Sigvard originally sent\
  \ here was a serpentfolk scholar and would have known this. No, surely this is not\
  \ the place.”</p> \n     <p>“So what’re ya sayin’?” Thri asked, cheeks flushing\
  \ with anger. “What’s this, then?”</p> \n     <p>Aliyama turned to face her. “Most\
  \ likely the remnants of a misguided dragon cult of Dahak. Kobolds, charau-ka, boggards,\
  \ or somesuch. These cults are common here, spawning and dying off constantly. Nasty\
  \ business. But most certainly not some-thing actually created by the serpentfolk.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Thri exhaled, disappointment flooding her voice. “So we haven’t found\
  \ it yet. No chargin’ in to rescue a lost Pathfinder.”</p> \n     <p>Aliyama lay\
  \ a gloved hand on the dwarf’s broad shoulder. “Do not worry, young one. I know\
  \ this is your first excursion with the Pathfinder Society and you wish to make\
  \ your mark. Yet take heart! This is the life of an adventurer. We explore, thoughtfully\
  \ and with consideration. Abadar himself is a traveler, yes? Yet he is not hasty.\
  \ He is slow and relentless, as the gears of civilization are slow and relentless.\
  \ So too must we step carefully, always moving forward. We will find our missing\
  \ Pathfinder agent, Thri Redbarrel. With patience, and by Abadar’s hand.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Thri accepted the lecture with a short nod, then shrugged. “Let’s keep\
  \ lookin’. I hope we fight somethin’ soon, though. This heat is makin’ me cranky.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Aliyama smiled. “Battle too is an inevitable part of adventuring.\
  \ Though this structure is not our destination, we are close. Let me consult my\
  \ wayfinder again.” The elf flipped open the circular lid and began peering down\
  \ at its face.</p> \n     <p>A full minute passed, the elf consulting her wayfinder\
  \ and muttering. The dwarf watched her, then scanned the surround-ings. All around\
  \ them the jungle hooted and sang with life.</p> \n     <p>“Uh... Ali?”</p> \n \
  \    <p>“One more moment, please Thri.”</p> \n     <p>“It’s just—” </p> \n     <p>“\
  Thri, please. Patience.”</p> \n     <p>“Okay. It’s just that Reynold’s gone.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I see. Well... What!?” Aliyama looked up, startled. “Where is he?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“I, uh. I’m thinkin’ maybe he went in.”</p> \n     <p>They both stared\
  \ at the ten-foot, darkened doorway.</p> \n     <p>“Ridiculous, infuriating, impulsive,\
  \ sneaky, dandy of a human,” the elf muttered. “He is always—”</p> \n     <p>A cry\
  \ echoed from deep within the hillside.</p> \n     <p>“Yep, that’s him.” Thri pulled\
  \ the double-bladed battle axe from her back.</p> \n     <p>“Just hold a moment.\
  \ We must—”</p> \n     <p>Reynold burst from the shadows, wide-eyed. In one hand\
  \ he held his shortsword. In the other, a coiling, golden figurine of a snake.</p>\

  \ Bloody help!” he cried.</p> \n     <p>“What did you do?” Aliyama demanded.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“No time! Help!”</p> \n     <p>Three tall, scaled humanoid figures in\
  \ green robes spilled from the dark opening. At first Aliyama thought they might\
  \ be iruxi. But instead of lizard-like heads, these figures bore the heads of hooded\
  \ cobras. Long, whip-like tails thrashed as the figures moved sinuously into fighting\
  \ formation. One of the creatures hissed and drew a curved blade the length of its\
  \ forearm. </p> \n     <p>“Impossible,” Aliyama breathed.</p> \n     <p>As Reynold\
  \ scampered past one of the large, hooded statues, a sound of grinding stone filled\
  \ the clearing. The mossy, guardian cobra turned its head, following the fleeing\
  \ thief.</p> \n     <p>“Look out!”</p> \n     <p>Reynold dove to one side and rolled.\
  \ The cobra’s head snapped its jaws together with a sharp CRACK! where his head\
  \ had been. Reynold continued his roll smoothly and was back on his feet in an instant.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“There are no more serpentfolk in the Mwangi,” Aliyama stated numbly.\
  \ “They are in the Darklands, not on the surface. Kline’s report was thorough…”\
  </p> \n     <p>With an enthusiastic cry, Thri stepped forward and met the lead creature.\
  \ Battleaxe and curved dagger clashed.</p> \n     <p>“Our scholar is in there,”\
  \ Reynold said, panting. “Pinned to the wall in the entry like some sort of warning.\
  \ These figurines are in the nooks in the walls. I only snagged one before those\
  \ things noticed me.”</p> \n     <p>Aliyama glared at him. “Why are you grinning,\
  \ thief?”</p> \n     <p>“It just occurred to me that when this is over, you get\
  \ to tell me I was right and you were wrong,” he winked. With a whoop, he dashed\
  \ to flank the serpentfolk battling Thri.</p> \n     <p>Shaking her head, Aliyama\
  \ snapped her wayfinder shut and raised her arms, beginning a prayer to Abadar,\
  \ Master of the First Vault. </p> \n     <p>A single bead of sweat trickled down\
  \ her forehead.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
