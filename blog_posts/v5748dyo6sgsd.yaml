  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">A month ago, an unruly quartet\
  \ of goblin heroes was unleashed on an unsuspecting populace. Yes, I said heroes.\
  \ It turns out some goblins have learned the error of their ways—or, perhaps at\
  \ least learned what many adventurers learn: you can steal and murder as much as\
  \ you want, as long as it’s against “the bad guys.”</p> \n     <p>We managed to\
  \ fit 4 new characters in the Free RPG Day <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yju/discuss?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  >We Be Heroes? storybook</a>, but we just didn’t have enough space for role cards\
  \ (also, you couldn’t use them in that storybook anyway). Thankfully, there’s this\
  \ crazy thing called the internet and I hear you can post things to it. Let’s get\
  \ crazy with it.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_GoblinMarkersRules.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Rules: Goblin markers. One side of each of these role cards uses goblin\
  \ markers. Each character using goblin markers chooses one type of marker. (Since\
  \ there are only 7 markers of each type in the game, this means that unless you\
  \ have a power that allows you to steal markers, you cannot have more than 7 goblin\
  \ markers on your role.)\">\n      <br> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Speaking\
  \ of crazy, I give you goblin markers!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Disclaimer: Half\
  \ of the following roles use a new mechanic called goblin markers. A goblin does\
  \ something it should probably be doing already and is rewarded with a marker that\
  \ lets it do something else it wants to do. I’m sure nothing can go wrong here.</p>\

  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Crimsi is making a trebuchet. Will she load\
  \ it with fire, rocks, or other goblins?</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Let’s start\
  \ with our favorite Goblin ranger, Crimsi. She’s really into inventing things, as\
  \ long as “things” can fling destruction and fire about. She’ll cheerfully scout\
  \ for you, but she’s easily distracted by bits of junk and fire. </p> \n     <p>Arson\
  \ Archer Crimsi would like you to know that she likes burning, crossbows, fire,\
  \ catapults, and any other words for fire and siege weapons she hasn’t learned yet.\
  \ It’s a fairly straightforward role that wants you to care about Bow and Fire cards.\
  \ She can also launch goblins (including herself) to other locations with hardly\
  \ any chance of serious injury.</p> \n     <p>Kitbasher Crimsi likes gathering those\
  \ new goblin markers together so she can bash things together, whether the result\
  \ is helping, hurting, or both. Mostly both. She’s good at flinging things into\
  \ fights her friends are probably in, or flinging her friends at fights, and is\
  \ great at Crafting new things that will probably hurt someone.</p> \n     <div\

  \ He also has a habit of biting every monster he gets near. </p> \n     <p>Amnesiac\

  \ I don’t have any pizza!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Pizazz is good at helping\
  \ his friends, like any bard. The wrinkle he runs into is that he has a genuinely\
  \ fantastic singing voice... that sends goblins running away in pain. They really\
  \ like when he plays his “fancy” penny whistle, though.</p> \n     <p>Battlecrooner\
  \ Pizazz leans into using his mellifluous voice, despite any panic it may cause\
  \ nearby goblins. As a result, he makes lots of non-goblin allies that turn out\
  \ to be pretty darn useful, whether he’s getting to use them more often or they’\
  re appreciating his instrumentless crooning.</p> \n     <p>Whistleblower Pizazz\
  \ goes another way, embracing his goblin heritage (and markers) to whistle up bonuses\
  \ and spook any upcoming monsters into fighting his goblin friends. He’s maybe a\
  \ little bitter that said friends don’t appreciate his true talent, so from time\
  \ to time he might steal some of their markers. (The fools won’t miss them anyway.)</p>\

  \ \n     <p>Treemugger Siathorn easily gathers goblin markers by just playing with\

  \ after she steals a few of their Animal allies away from them.</p> \n     <p>Wolfmother\
  \ Siathorn focuses her efforts on Mitzi, as well she should. Under her care, Mitzi\

  >Character Sheet package</a> to include sheets for all four of these goblins, including\
  \ their roles. And in the near future, they’ll also be available as a print-on-demand\
  \ card set from our friends at DriveThru Cards. (After they go live, we’ll mention\
  \ it in a future blog.)</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
