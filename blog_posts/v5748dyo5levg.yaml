  \ John Compton, and I went to MisCon 27, in Missoula, Montana. Without a doubt,\
  \ it's one of the finest and most fun regional conventions I've been to. There were\
  \ around 1,200 attendees, but you wouldn't know itâ€”the way the con organizers use\
  \ the space makes it feel pretty intimate.</span></p> \n    <p>Venture Captain Kyle\
  \ Elliot was there, as a madman running Pathfinder constantly for longtime fans\
  \ and enthusiastic new players. Here's what he had to say about that\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Pathfinder Society is soon to be a growing trend in the great state of Montana.\
  \ <a href=\"http://musecomics.com/\" target=\"_BLANK\">Muse: Comics and Games </a>is\
  \ the newest hotspot for PFS in the city of Missoula, hosting games every Sunday.\
  \ MisCon 27 was a great starting point to meet fans of the game and get them involved\
  \ in a local community. I ran across several gaming clubs that connect gamers to\
  \ one another across this spread out state. From <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HamiltonGamersGuild\"\
  \ target=\"_BLANK\">Hamilton Gamers Guild</a> or the crew at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackShieldProductions\"\
  \ target=\"_BLANK\">Black Shield Productions</a> these folks were great examples\
  \ of what type of amazing community that is waiting for more to join. I've already\
  \ set my travel plans for MisCon next year, and I hope to see y'all there too.\"\

  ><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfm\"><i>Master of Devils</i></a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a>, joined our happy\
  \ quartet for the Paizo Ask Us Anything panel, where we talked about upcoming books,\
  \ rules questions, life cycle of products, things like that. It was a good crowd,\
  \ and because it was such a nice day, the convention staff held that panel outdoors.</p>\

  \ convention highlights. From Adam:<br> \"I had such a great time talking to people\
  \ during the weekend, especially all the people that came to my panels and stuck\
  \ around to talk when they were over. I think we all came up with some fun ideas\
  \ during the monster design panel, and though Monday was a bit slower as people\
  \ went back to their normal lives. We had some good talks with people about writing\
  \ for publication. I was most touched when Erik Evjen found me on Friday and presented\
  \ me with a sweet thank you card, on behalf of all Montana gamers, to bring back\
  \ to the office and share with my coworkers (along with a bottle of booze!).\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>From John:<br> \"MisCon 27 was my first opportunity to represent Paizo\
  \ while wearing the blue shirt, and I enjoyed the experience immensely. All of the\
  \ panels that I participated in were lively, informative, and well attended. Of\
  \ particular note were the monster design panel that I ran with Adam, a \"how to\
  \ make paladins fun\" panel, and the ever-infamous Deck of Many Situations exercise\
  \ that concluded an expanded series of GM 101 seminars. Missoula was an excellent\
  \ host, and I look forward to returning in the future.\"</p> \n    <p>And I personally\
  \ had a lot of fun during my two-hour Improvisational GMing seminar. That's always\
  \ a blast, but the crowd at MisCon was especially fun to work with, because they\
  \ jumped right in with the improv exercises. There were also a few people running\
  \ The Dresden Files RPG non-stop over the convention, so I stopped by at the end\
  \ of the show and high-fived them. Finally, I got to meet and talk with Jim Butcher,\
  \ which was a real treat after reading his books for years and working on the game\
  \ about his world.</p> \n    <p>And, of course, we all enjoyed the after-hours shindigs,\
  \ sitting around and chatting with fans and newfound friends.</p> \n    <p>If you\
  \ get a chance to go to MisCon, we cannot recommend it enough.</p> \n    <p>Ryan\
