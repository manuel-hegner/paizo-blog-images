  >This month's <a href=\"/products/btpy909j?Pathfinder-Battles-Legends-of-Golarion\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> set of prepainted plastic <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures is in stores now and on its way to subscribers\
  \ as I write this blog. I hope you're enjoying that collection of creatures and\
  \ NPCs inspired by the Pathfinder campaign setting. It was certainly great fun putting\
  \ it together.</span></p> \n     <p>Now that that set is upon us, it's time to focus\
  \ on the NEXT set, <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a>! Like\
  \ many of our previous sets, <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a>\
  \ is inspired by a <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path</a> campaign. In this case it's the current campaign that runs\
  \ through January, a heroic struggle against demons in the twisted chaos of the\
  \ Worldwound, at the edge of the Inner Sea's civilization. The set includes lots\
  \ of heroic warriors and even more hideous monsters and demons, including several\
  \ that have never before been produced in prepainted plastic.</p> \n     <p>Oh,\
  \ and one more thing, the set's formal release month has been moved from DECEMBER\
  \ to JANUARY. We've listened to what collectors and fans have been telling us about\
  \ the pace of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ releases, and we'll be slowing things down a bit in 2014 to make it easier for\
  \ folks to keep up with their collections. As usual, thanks for the great feedback\
  \ you guys have provided throughout this whole process. It really does help us a\
  \ lot as we plan sets and make decisions about what figures to include and how to\
  \ paint them.</p> \n     <p>This week, I want to show off several figures from <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a>. Several more will follow\
  \ in the weeks to come. In a few minutes from the moment I'm writing this, WizKids\
  \ will be bringing by paint masters for the two Huge figures in the upcoming <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy922b\">Reign of Winter Monsters</a> encounter pack, so we'll\
  \ also be showing off those behemoths some time in the relatively near future.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Until then, there are demons to discover!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Alain_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Our first character to reveal for this set is not a demon\
  \ at all, but another of the popular Pathfinder iconic characters. Here we have\
  \ Alain, Human Cavalier, who first appeared in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</a> a few years ago. Alain makes the perfect\
  \ knight to go up against demonic hordes, and it goes without saying that he also\
  \ makes a great proxy for any kind of heavily armored male warrior. Alain is a Medium\
  \ uncommon figure, a testament to how awesome this set's rares really are. The detail\
  \ and paint steps on this guy are pretty amazing, and I think you're going to love\
  \ him. I do.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-SchirDemon_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-SchirDemon_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have another of my favorites from the set,\
  \ the goat-headed Schir Demon. These badboys come from real world mythology, and\
  \ they make great shock troops in any Abyssal army. Standing about 7 feet tall,\
  \ they loom over even burly player character types, whom they also like to stab\
  \ with their intricate pole arms. Cool! The Schir Demon is a Medium, common figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-LowTemplar_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-LowTemplar_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This here Low Templar exemplifies the sort of questionable\
  \ characters attached to the various crusades designed to push back the demonic\
  \ threat. As such, he's a good example of why the player characters are necessary\
  \ to save the world. The rank and file can't exactly pull their own weight. Of course,\
  \ with chain mail armor and a cool axe, this guy works great for a player character,\
  \ henchman, cohort, follower, or just about any sort of armored soldier dude you\
  \ might need. He's human, he's Medium, and he's uncommon.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Irabeth_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Irabeth_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of course, the Worldwound crusades attract more\
  \ than a few actually righteous good guys (other than the player characters, of\
  \ course!). One of the best is Irabeth, a half-orc paladin with a golden breastplate,\
  \ a massive shield, and a cool sword. She is one of several recurring allies the\
  \ PCs will encounter throughout the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, and it goes without saying that she\
  \ makes a great proxy for female half-orc warrior player characters, too. She's\
  \ also the cover model for <a href=\"/products/btpy90q9\">Pathfinder #73: The Worldwound\
  \ Incursion</a>, where you can find her stats. Irabeth is a Medium, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Minotaur_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Minotaur_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But enough Medium-sized figures. <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> also contains lots of Large menaces, such as this amazing\
  \ Half-Fiend Minotaur. This miniature is one of those rare examples that actually\
  \ improves upon the art that inspired it (from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>). When WizKids brought in this figure for approvals,\
  \ everyone's jaws hit the floor. Simply put, this is a great figure I am confident\
  \ you will want to add to your collection. And since the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> focuses heavily on demons, minotaurs,\
  \ and the cult of Baphomet, I promise you'll have plenty of opportunity to kill\
  \ characters with this guy, too. The Half-Fiend Minotaur is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Chimera_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Chimera_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I have always believed in second chances. Way back\
  \ in our first set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, we\
  \ released a <a href=\"/products/btpy8qjl\">Chimera</a> that, while better than\
  \ the several attempts we made during development of that set, still lacked a certain\
  \ something, that something being \"awesomeness\". I've been looking for a chance\
  \ to revisit the creature ever since, and when I heard that the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> would feature the Mythic Chimera illustrated\
  \ by Eric Belisle in <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywe\">Mythic Adventures</a>, I leapt\
  \ at the chance to include the monster in this set. WizKids delivered with an amazing\
  \ sculpt. The Mythic Chimera is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n     <p>That's it for\
  \ this week. Come back next week for more <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> previews!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
