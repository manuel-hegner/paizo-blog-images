  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s time to celebrate the release of the incredible\
  \ <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>! This book gives so many awesome options to any and\
  \ every class in our game, and none of it would be possible without a squadron of\
  \ fantastic authors. I’m personally honored to have helped develop their work following\
  \ the legendary developers John Compton and Joe Pasini, who went above and beyond\
  \ bringing this incredible book to life. Without further ado, let’s give our amazing\
  \ authors the opportunity to show us all the awesome projects they have and help\
  \ celebrate the release of their wonderful work. If you liked a section, consider\
  \ letting them know in the comments and following them on social media!</p> \n \

  \ \n     <p>Hi all! I'm Ivis K. Flanagan, freelance writer and teacher. Working\
  \ on <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em> was an awesome highlight for me, as I got to work\
  \ on a variety of sections: Themes, the Mystic Class updates, and some new creature\
  \ companions. The creature companions were probably my favorite—and I cannot wait\
  \ for everyone to get a look at the new furry (and not so furry) friends that I,\
  \ among others, have gotten to bring to your table. </p> \n     <p>Outside of <em>Starfinder\
  \ Enhanced</em>, you can find my work in other Starfinder releases, as well as Pathfinder\
  \ and other companies. A full list of my current credits can be found <a href=\"\
  https://northerndreamer.carrd.com\">here</a>. As for me, when I'm not writing, you\
  \ can often find me GMing games for anyone who wants to play! If you want to reach\
  \ out about future projects, playing games, or just to chat, you can find me on\
  \ <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/northerndreamer.bsky.social\">Bluesky</a> or\
  \ email me at ikflanagan at gmail.com.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jason Keeley (he/him)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Hi folks, I'm Jason Keeley (he/him) and come with me... to the stars!\
  \ I contributed the narrative starship combat section to <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>\
  \ and it was an interesting challenge to streamline the normal starship combat rules\
  \ while retaining some of the use of currently printed starship stat blocks. Hopefully,\
  \ those who are looking for a more condensed experience will enjoy it! When I'm\
  \ not doing things for Paizo, I spend my time recording for the Know Direction network,\
  \ collaborating with Joe Pasini on puzzles, and generally working on other TTRPG\
  \ projects—like my cereal mascot game This Compleat Breakfast, available for free\
  \ at <a href=\"https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast\">https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast</a>!\
  \ You can usually find me under the name \"herzwesten\" on most social media platforms.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone! My name’s Jessica\
  \ Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily\
  \ writes for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. My past works as a freelance author\
  \ for Paizo include eight Organized Play scenarios, one adventure module, five Adventure\
  \ Path volumes, cover credit on two hardcover books, and a whole lot more! <em>Starfinder\
  \ Enhanced</em> is very much a love letter to Starfinder, and is packed to bursting\
  \ with new options for every aspect of the game, as well as new subsystems, alternate\
  \ ways to play, and enhanced versions of a few classes. Whatever kind of characters\
  \ you play, and whatever kind of games you run, there’s something in <em>Starfinder\
  \ Enhanced</em> for you. In addition to working on <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>\
  \ on the clock as a member of the Starfinder team, I worked on it as a freelance\
  \ author. In short: I wrote a LOT for this book. Picking a favorite contribution\
  \ is a challenge, but I’m most proud of creating novians and holograms (including\
  \ initial pitching of these species) and writing the new uses for Resolve Points,\
  \ which will provide players of all classes and builds a lot of fun new tricks.\
  \ I hope the love and enthusiasm that everyone put into this book resonates with\
  \ you and that you enjoy the huge amount of new options at your disposal. Now get\
  \ out there and make some novians! Until next time, Starfinders!</p> \n     <br\

  \ Enhanced</em> was my final project as a Starfinder developer. What a fitting finale,\
  \ too! <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em> gave me space to explore several big ideas that\
  \ I’d aways wanted to see in the game, particularly the custom and upgradeable weapons\
  \ and armor. You’ll also see my handiwork in the enhanced envoy, solarian, and witchwarper,\
  \ as well as the several sections I developed before blasting off to the Pathfinder\
  \ narrative team.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>John Curtin (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Hi,\
  \ my name is John Curtin (he/him) and I had a blast contributing some of the feats\
  \ and nanocyte options to <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>! My primary design driver\
  \ here was asking myself \"what, as a player, would make me really excited to see\
  \ as a potential option,\" and I my most fervent that at least one GM out there\
  \ finds out about one of my options from a player and goes \"...you can do what\
  \ now?? That's awesome!!\" Here at Paizo, I’ve got more Starfinder credits upcoming,\
  \ but in true freelancer fashion, the projects I’m most excited to tell everyone\
  \ about are still under NDA. To hear about my latest and greatest, you can follow\
  \ me on BlueSky @curtinwrites, on the remains of Twitter @Curtin_Writes, and explore\
  \ the currently inactive @StarfinderFacts.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>John Godek\
  \ III (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Hi! I’m John, a gamer, gamemaster, freelance author,\
  \ and podcaster in the Seattle area. I earned my 5th Nova for Starfinder Society\
  \ two years ago and have worked on a dozen freelance assignments for Evil Robot\
  \ Games, Legendary Games, and Paizo. My most recent work includes this summer’s\
  \ <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-04: Secrets Long Submerged</em> and next year’\
  s <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em> and <em>Character Guide</em>.\
  \ For <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>, I had the opportunity to create new class options\
  \ for the mechanic, technomancer, and vanguard, plus new augmentations, magic items,\
  \ and hybrid items. </p> \n     <p>When I’m not playing, GMing, or writing, I produce\
  \ three podcasts on the Know Direction Network: <em>Digital Divination</em>, a Starfinder\
  \ talk show with Paizo Senior Developer Jason Keeley; <em>Intrepid Heroes</em>,\
  \ a Starfinder actual play whose cast has included Eleanor Ferron, Rob Helm, Scott\
  \ Keim, Ron and Stephanie Lundeen, Jason Tondro, and Mark Woolcott; <em>Presenting\
  \ - Gamers Making Games</em>, an interview show where I chat with game designers,\
  \ developers, artists, and editors.</p> \n     <p>You can reach me on <em>X</em>\

  \ There is so much cool stuff coming your way in this book. I specifically worked\

  \ Items, and can't wait to see what you think of all of them. From the Major League\
  \ Coach (who draws on sci-fi sports from other books as well as ones influenced\
  \ by my SFS experiences) to the musical Audocyte (who emulates my constant need\
  \ for music almost everywhere I go), each of these archetypes <em>enhance</em> aspects\
  \ of the science fiction/fantasy genre in ways I hope each of you will love!</p>\
