  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Saturday, July 24, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the most interesting things about Pathfinder\
  \ Online is the fact that the items your character uses are crafted by players.\
  \ In so many other MMOs, the gear that players crave is the result of killing off\
  \ specific boss monsters. Sure, PFO's boss monsters drop nice spells and other maneuvers,\
  \ and killing NPCs is a great way to get the recipes folks need to make all the\
  \ stuff in the world... but those items still need to be <i>created</i>. Raw components\
  \ need to be gathered or bought from other players, and a crafter needs to have\
  \ a specific recipe and must dedicate time to crafting the item. </p> \n     <p>PFO\
  \ also has no NPC stores selling gear. The auction houses in the game are stocked\
  \ entirely by other players, who set their own prices for each item. This leads\
  \ to an interesting economy where items that are in demand command a much higher\
  \ price than items that are more niche.</p> \n     <p>Every week, I travel around\
  \ the map, checking out all the player-run auction houses. The quality of each auction\
  \ house depends a lot on the local groups and the players who are taking the time\
  \ to stock the auction houses. If the local population is sparse, then the auction\
  \ house tends to be fairly bare, with items listed either being insanely cheap or\
  \ outrageously expensive. On the other hand, in areas with a higher population,\
  \ the auction houses are vibrant, with goods changing hands all the time and prices\
  \ moving toward what the market will bear.</p> \n     <p>The exception to this rule\
  \ is settlements which are run with a \"commune\" philosophy, where everyone contributes\
  \ everything they have to their central bank, which in turn provides them with all\
  \ the gear they could want for free. It's a great way to play the game if you don't\
  \ want to worry about money and gear, but it tanks the local economy for folks who\
  \ have a more capitalistic bent. These settlements have some of the highest populations...\
  \ but some of the weakest auction houses.</p> \n     <p>I have been running a merchant\
  \ business out of Thornkeep for the past six weeks. My main goal has been to provide\
  \ new players with upgrades over the starter gear they get when they start the game.\
  \ It only takes around a week of play before a new player will be ready for better\
  \ gear, so keeping my supply pipeline full is a hard job. But it is also very profitable.\
  \ And the money I make has allowed me to start purchasing raw materials from gatherers\
  \ or refiners rather than having to gather it all myself. This has allowed me to\
  \ ramp up production of goods to keep up with the ever-increasing new player demand.</p>\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>The Bloodstone Swords' merchant Gilrin stands outside the Thornkeep\
  \ Auction House.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Another facet of the economy is that\
  \ creating finished goods usually involves a web of people. For instance, to make\
  \ a +2 Steel Longsword, a weaponsmith needs Steel Ingots +2, which are made by a\
  \ smelter using 22 iron ore, 22 coal, and an ordered essence. Iron ore and coal\
  \ are gathered by miners, while the ordered essence comes from a dowser. That longsword\
  \ also needs Basic Strips +2, which a tanner makes using 10 Beast Hides, gathered\
  \ by a scavenger, and 4 weak acidic items and 1 weak deadly item. Acidic items include\
  \ smoke peppers and foxfire, while deadly items include belladonna and blood nettle;\
  \ all of these are gathered by foresters. So it's hard—but not impossible—to make\
  \ things all by yourself. To make that sword without involving anyone else, you'd\
  \ need levels in Dowser, Forester, Miner, and Scavenger to gather the raw materials.\
  \ Then, to refine them, you'd need levels in Smelter and Tanner. And you'd need\
  \ levels in Weaponsmith to make the finished sword.</p> \n     <p>Also, some raw\
  \ materials are localized. For instance, coal is more common on the west side of\
  \ the map, which is pretty far away from the Thornkeep area. I've had to go out\
  \ there and gather some coal, augmenting what I find with purchases from local gatherers\
  \ in the auction houses, and then I haul it back to Thornkeep using the new mule\
  \ system. Soon, there will be a Buy Order system where I will be able to tell gatherers\
  \ that I am willing to pay a specific amount for each piece of coal ore they bring\
  \ me. This way, I won't have to worry about going places to get coal, and the gatherers\
  \ will know they have a ready source of cash for the stuff they find. This is going\
  \ to be a huge boost to the player-created economy because players will know there's\
  \ a particular amount of money being offered for a particular item, and it will\
  \ help set pricing norms.</p> \n     <p>So there are already a lot of interesting\
  \ facets to the economy in PFO. Once the enchanting system is added to the mix,\
  \ crafters will have a myriad of ways to differentiate their wares (other than price).\
  \ The economy in PFO has risen from its infancy and is now entering its awkward\
  \ teenage years. It will be exciting to see how it grows and develops!</p> \n  \
  \   <h2>Player Profile: Drake and Kachara, Gatherer and Armorer from Keeper's Pass</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>I first met the person who plays both Drake and Kachara when a large\
  \ contingent of folks from Keeper's Pass showed up at PaizoCon this year. Keeper's\
  \ Pass has focused their in-game efforts on gathering, refining and crafting, providing\
  \ gear for their compatriots in the large EBA alliance. Kachara created a special\
  \ set of Ornate Steel Plate +3 for my character Laurethoron to wear on special occasions.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Let's hear from Drake and Kachara about how this all came about:</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Drake \"the Mule\" heard the calling of Desna and\
  \ convinced his twin sister Kachara to follow him wandering the world in search\
  \ of new things. That led them to the River Kingdoms where they met other wanderers\
  \ and helped found the settlement of Keeper's Pass. While his sister settled down\
  \ quickly and found work as a master armorsmith, Drake preferred to get out and\
  \ explore the land. In his exploration he was always finding valuable gems and ores\
  \ which seemed to find their way into his pack, apparently not even slowing him\
  \ down. When he would return to town he would dump out his pack and people would\
  \ be astonished how much he was carrying. Unfazed, he would shove the haul into\
  \ the hands of the town crafters—all but the most choice bits of iron and other\
  \ metals, which he would smelt himself to present to his sister before leaving town\
  \ to see what else he could find.</p> \n      <p>Kachara, twin sister of Drake,\
  \ having no strong ties to anyone else in her home village and no available apprenticeships\
  \ to the local smithy, decided to follow her brother in his wanderings. Her decision\
  \ proved the right path for her as it led her to the River Kingdoms where she received\
  \ training in the crafting of the armors that are in high demand by the adventurers\
  \ flooding the area. She set herself up with a group of friendly individuals in\
  \ the mountains a fair ways south of Thornkeep where they founded the settlement\
  \ of Keeper's Pass. She always has work orders coming in, and the constant stream\
  \ of work only causes her to improve her craft further. Her brother always returned\
  \ from his wanderings bearing gifts of iron of the highest quality, which she uses\
  \ to forge armor for her friends and new family here in the River Kingdoms.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Player Profile: Stache, The Merchant Prince of\
  \ Kreuz Bernstein</h2> \n     <p>One of the more exciting things that has happened\
  \ in the game since the launch of Early Enrollment is the revitalization of the\
  \ settlement of Kreuz Bernstein by Stache. In the early days, Kreuz was practically\
  \ a ghost town, but Stache and his army of gatherers and crafters have turned it\
  \ into a thriving hub of commerce. It has the widest selection of Tier 2 gear, which\
  \ the more advanced players make use of, and the prices for most things are among\
  \ the most reasonable in the entire Echo Wood. From what I hear, Stache is about\
  \ to become the first millionaire merchant in the game.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150725-StacheCrew.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150725-StacheCrew_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br><i>Stache and his crew of refiners and crafters stand outside the\
  \ Kreuz Bernstein auction house.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Let's hear from Stache\
  \ himself about how this all came about:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Who\
  \ is Stache? The Merchant Prince, the man behind the Mustache, the guy who gets\
  \ it done. The Stache even talks in third person. Stache and his twin ZomoZ (brother\
  \ from another mother) do a stiff business in virtually everything craftable. Stache\
  \ has an army of dedicated refiners for every refining job, and tons of crafters\
  \ pumping out quality goods for the masses. ZomoZ is the strong arm of the law,\
  \ enforcing trades and defending the infrastructure that his twin has built.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Stache has worked his way up from being a citizen of the Empire of\
  \ Xeilias (EoX), to being one of the leaders. Yes, that's right, Stache is the mustache\
  \ behind the curtain, and while he runs his own company, it is almost a one-man\
  \ company.</p> \n      <p>Kreuz Bernstein, the home for Stache and many more, has\
  \ widely been recognized as the best auction house for Tier 2, with a steady supply\
  \ required for the Empire's war efforts. Stache is an equal opportunity merchant.\
  \ Large orders have been purchased from virtually every corner of the map, including\
  \ the monster hunters at Talonguard, the dwarves of Forgeholm, and the students\
  \ and staff of the one and only Pathfinder University. Shady intermediaries from\
  \ down south who would rather their names remain anonymous also buy my wares when\
  \ they are running low. Conservative rumor has it that Stache has crafted a third\
  \ of all goods consumed by the Empire, with other crafted goods going anywhere there\
  \ is coin.</p> \n      <p>The pleasure from profits gained is only exceeded by his\
  \ pride in his name, his brand, and his very fine Mustache. No person can doubt\
  \ a deal or trade made, as Stache's word is as good as gold. Stache's company, Stache's\
  \ Mustache, has also seen the limelight from reclaiming towers for the ability to\
  \ craft high-tier gear, and for the betterment of the market as a whole.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Are you interested in crafting with someone who has connections to every\
  \ type of refiner in game, so you do not have to wait for seven people to log in\
  \ over a week's time to get one thing crafted? Stache has logged in and crafted\
  \ every day for over half a year strong and there is no stopping this crafting machine!\
  \ Consider joining Stache's Mustache, Kreuz Bernstein's pride and joy. Search \"\
  Stache\" in game in the company finder—it's the one and only! There are profits\
  \ to be made, and war to be had when bored!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Lisa\
