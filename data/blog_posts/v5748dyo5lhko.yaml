  \    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 8, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Back in November 2014, you may recall the Pathfinder\
  \ Society team <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgqn\">held a marathon meeting</a>\
  \ to address a long list of feedback and devise numerous concrete objectives for\
  \ how to improve the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</a> campaign. In the spirit of the main announcement for today, let's take\
  \ a look at what Mike and I shared back then and see where things are now.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>Factions</h2> \n     <p>Factions were getting a bit unwieldy as promoting\
  \ faction goals relied on playing the right scenario with the right character. Updating\
  \ faction documentation on the website was also behind schedule. We proposed <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhc2\">getting new art</a> for each of the revised\
  \ factions, getting the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/factions\">website text updated</a>,\
  \ and producing the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhcl\"> faction journal cards</a>.\
  \ As you can see by the links, we've hit all of these goals, albeit a little later\
  \ than projected.</p> \n     <h2>Scenario Length</h2> \n     <p>As scenarios developed\
  \ deeper stories and greater complexity, the adventure gradually ran longer and\
  \ longer—even extending beyond the 5-hour soft limit. What's more, numerous locations\
  \ couldn't manage to complete some of the average-length scenarios because the venue\
  \ or weeknight schedule only allowed for 4 4.5-hour games.</p> \n     <p>Beginning\
  \ back in January, I began trimming the number of encounters in higher-level scenarios\
  \ while also watching for exceptionally time-consuming encounters in lower-level\
  \ adventures and adjusting as necessary. Based on the feedback I've read, the first\
  \ month or two after the change was a bit hit-or-miss in meeting this goal, but\
  \ what I've read since suggests that it's getting easier to run the new scenarios\
  \ in a 4-hour slot (not including set-up and paperwork).</p> \n     <h2>Scenario\
  \ [Preparation] Difficulty</h2> \n     <p>With the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd\"\
  >Pathfinder Reference Document</a> so easy to reference from home, scenario authors\
  \ and I felt more comfortable including increasingly complex and diverse options\
  \ from the Pathfinder RPG hardcover line. The trouble was that this made scenarios\
  \ harder to prepare and run—especially in the unenviable but occasionally necessary\
  \ circumstance of running an adventure cold.</p> \n     <p>Beginning in December\
  \ 2014, we began including full Bestiary pages in the back of scenarios, reducing\
  \ the books that a GM might need to juggle to the “character option” books such\
  \ as Advanced Player's Guide for a feat or a spell. We also returned to the practice\
  \ of including full stat blocks for creatures with simple templates that substantially\
  \ modify their statistics (e.g. the advanced simple template, but not the fiendish\
  \ one). It's a little harder to measure how well we've limited the number of subsystems\
  \ and complicated mechanics, but it's certainly been on my mind while writing outlines,\
  \ working with the author, and developing adventures.</p> \n     <h2>Season Plotline</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>By 2014, Pathfinder Society had developed a reputation for basing its\
  \ season-long plotlines off a recently released Adventure Path, and it was increasingly\
  \ apparent how much this tied our hands regarding what kinds of stories we could\
  \ tell and pushing the Society toward year-long goals that did not always support\
  \ its main agenda of exploration, documentation, and scholarship.</p> \n     <p>It's\
  \ a little hard to share a lot on this front without giving away too much, but as\
  \ you probably picked up from the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhjk\">recent blog\
  \ announcing the Year of the Serpent</a>, we're cooking up a fun new season that\
  \ tips its hat to the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  >Hell's Rebels</a> Adventure Path but focuses on its own story near and dear to\
  \ the Pathfinder Society's interests. All of that includes traveling to a large\
  \ number of destinations—many familiar and many new—in the name of exploring, reporting,\
  \ and cooperating.</p> \n     <h2>The Story So Far</h2> \n     <p>If you're following\
  \ along with that first blog I linked to back in November, you may notice one big\
  \ entry that I haven't talked about yet: the Story So Far project. As the organized\
  \ play campaign gets older, the accumulated wealth of stories, NPCs, and other developments\
  \ can make it tough to know what has happened already, how the current season might\
  \ tie in, and what the underlying assumptions are when playing an older adventure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The project really picked up steam when Linda Zaya-Palmer joined the\
  \ team, and I am happy to announce that the first wave of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ely\"\
  >Story So Far handouts is now complete and available for download</a>. These five\
  \ cover the first five unified season plot arcs in a very low-spoiler sort of way,\
  \ providing enough information to give a newer player helpful context without identifying\
  \ who a mysterious benefactor or a hidden traitor might be—all in a few hundred\
  \ words. Pass them out before an adventure tied to that season's metaplot, and let\
  \ us know how they work. Based on feedback, we're looking into addressing major\
  \ plot arcs and unifying threads (like the Blakros family and Grandmaster Torch)\
  \ in a similar fashion.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n \
