  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Later this\
  \ month, the beloved <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> makes its Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition debut with a slate of over a dozen products, both updating the fan-favorite\
  \ campaign to the new rules set (as well as updating the Pathfinder First Edition\
  \ rules and expanding into D&amp;D 5E) and incorporating content from the bestselling\
  \ <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> computer game from Owlcat Games.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ the computer adaptation of the campaign, a single-player experience, the protagonist\
  \ meets, befriends, and comes to rely upon a cast of NPC companions who help form\
  \ their adventuring party and rule their eventual kingdom. When we set out to bring\
  \ content from the computer game into the tabletop version, we knew we wanted to\
  \ include these characters, but weren’t quite sure how to do it. After all, a typical\
  \ play group already has multiple PCs who do what the companions in the CRPG did.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The result was the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide\"\
  ><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a>, a 128-page sourcebook to provide GMs running\
  \ Kingmaker (or any campaign, really) the tools they need to integrate more than\
  \ a dozen fully fleshed out NPCs into the campaign as optional expansions to the\
  \ already massive 640-page <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0d?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Kingmaker Adventure Path</em></a>. Additionally, the guide presents\
  \ rules for an optional camping system, complete with new downtime activities for\
  \ players to use while exploring the Stolen Lands, and expanded weather rules.</p>\

  \   <br> \n      <h3>Using Companions</h3> \n      <p>Seven primary companions—\
  the barbarian Amiri, the ranger Ekundayo, the alchemist Jubilost, the bard Linzi,\
  \ the rogue Nok-Nok, the cleric Tristian, and the fighter Valerie—are presented\
  \ in full detail. Each has two sets of statistics—one for use when the companion\
  \ first encounters the PCs, and one at a higher level for use during that companion’\
  s personal quest. These statistics were built using the rules for character creation,\
  \ not for NPCs. As such, if your group takes a shine to a companion, that NPC can\
  \ level up alongside the party as if they were a PC. In that case, the choices you\
  \ and your players make for that NPC take precedence over the higher level stats\
  \ given for a companion.</p> \n      <p>No statistics are presented for the five\
  \ secondary companions, as their roles in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>\
  \ are limited to downtime activities and kingdom management roles.</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h3>Befriending Companions</h3> \n      <p>Companions won’t necessarily\
  \ trust the PCs when they first meet. They never start their initial encounter hostile,\
  \ but they need to be influenced to friendly before they’ll be comfortable allying\
  \ with the PCs. Each companion is presented with a brief influence encounter, the\
  \ rules for which can be found on pages 151–153 of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em></a>.</p> \n      <p>Each companion includes\
  \ several character options that have the uncommon or rare trait; once the PCs have\
  \ befriended a companion, these options become available, and the PCs gain access\
  \ to them. </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Adventuring With Companions</h3> \n   \
  \   <p>Companions that have joined the PCs don’t need to accompany them on every\
  \ encounter. They can be held back in reserve to guard a campsite, left to perform\
  \ downtime activities, serve as leaders in the kingdom, and so on. But at times,\
  \ it may make sense for one or more companions to accompany the PCs on their adventures.\
  \ If you allow this, you’ll want to adjust encounters to account for the increased\
  \ number of characters in the party, as detailed on page 489 of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Personal Quests</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>The seven primary companions each have a personal quest as part of\
  \ their storyline. Though some companions provide foreshadowing to the PCs beforehand,\
  \ each quest formally begins with a specific event timed to coincide with particular\
  \ developments in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> and also to a specific character\
  \ level for the companion. (In order to avoid the party becoming distracted with\
  \ multiple personal quests at the same time, each quest triggers at a different\
  \ character level.) </p> \n      <p>Whether the PCs decide to accompany the companion\
  \ on their quest is left to the players to decide. However, this book assumes that\
  \ the PCs join the companion, who takes a full role in the PCs’ party through the\
  \ events and encounters of the short adventure. These companion quests are therefore\
  \ designed for a party of 5 characters rather than the standard 4, so encounters\
  \ in these quests are slightly more dangerous than comparable encounters in the\
  \ <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>.</p> \n      <p>If the PCs choose not to accompany\
  \ a companion on their personal quest, it’s up to you to determine the ramifications.\
  \ A companion might try to tackle their quest on their own (in which case, that\
  \ companion’s disappearance might serve as an additional hook to lure the PCs into\
  \ that quest), they might choose to let the quest slide and not pursue it, or they\
  \ might even abandon the PCs to seek help elsewhere—such as from potential rival\
  \ settlements like Drelev or Pitax. In such a case, a former companion could well\
  \ show up as an antagonist working against the PCs later in the campaign!</p> \n\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Camping</h3> \n      <p>In many campaigns, what happens\
  \ during a party’s 8 hours of rest between adventuring is hand-waved and handled\
  \ “off screen,” but the <em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em> provides fun new downtime\
  \ activities to bring this daily activity to life at your table. Whether you’re\
  \ using the time to learn a new feat, spell, or other rules element from one of\
  \ your befriended companions or cooking one of the 27 special meals presented in\
  \ the book (from level-0 jeweled rice to level-20 First World mince pie), what your\
  \ party does around the campfire will influence them upon waking.</p> \n      <br\
