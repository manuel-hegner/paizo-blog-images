  \ everyone! My name is Jen \"Iammars\" McTeague, and I like tinkering with board\
  \ games. It's very rare that I get heavily invested into a board game and don't\
  \ end up tinkering with it. You may have seen some of my work with Mansions of Madness\
  \ (<a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72193/completing-circle-fan-made-scenario\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">seen here</a> and <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/77864/chromatic-crackpot\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">here</a>, which led to a consulting gig with FFG on its <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v5y?Mansions-of-Madness-Call-of-the-Wild-Expansion\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Call of the Wild</a> expansion. Since I've recently become addicted to the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game, I've been looking at it with an eye toward writing material\
  \ and tinkering with it.</p> \n    <p>Everyone has a favorite monster or two—it's\
  \ hard to play this game (or any RPG) for too long before you settle on the monster\
  \ or two that you <i>really</i> like fighting. And for me, there's one monster that\
  \ stands out above the rest. It's pictured just below these words. Why don't you\
  \ go and click on it and bask in its great glory?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-PR-PigFromHell_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br> <i>Aw...\
  \ Look at the cute fire-breathing pig!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>BAM! Shadow Demon!\
  \ Bet you didn't see that one coming! And that's the beauty of a shadow demon. You\
  \ don't know he's there at first, but then suddenly people start disappearing, outsiders\
  \ know all of your battle plans, and friends start turning on each other. Once it's\
  \ obvious that the havoc is coming from inside the house, the scenario becomes a\
  \ witch hunt as you interrogate your allies, trying to get them to screw up. Those\
  \ who aren't as friendly with you may take your questioning as a challenge and come\
  \ to blows. In the end, you find the \"traitor\" only to have a black smoky form\
  \ come out as its flesh puppet falls unconscious, cackling at all the chaos it has\
  \ caused.</p> \n    <p>If you're only familiar with PACG Shadow Demons, you may\
  \ be wondering where this is coming from, since card-game shadow demons can't actually\
  \ do this. Well, that's the thing. In the PACG, they're vanilla incorporeal servitor\
  \ demons that do a bit of damage if you're in an Abyssal location, while in the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG, <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/demon.html#demon-shadow\"\
  >they're super cool</a>. I think these guys deserve to have their time in the sun—\
  let's put them center stage in their own scenario!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Maybe \"time in the sun\" wasn't the best choice of words...</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Now that I've gotten my impassioned rant in defense of shadow\
  \ demons out of the way, let's determine what we want the scenario to do, stripping\
  \ it down to the important points:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Chaos is being caused\
  \ inside friendly lines</li> \n     <li>We interrogate various allies to figure\
  \ out who is causing the problem</li> \n     <li>Once we find the possessed soldier,\
  \ exorcise and defeat the shadow demon.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>That first point\
  \ can be modeled by choosing locations that are mostly friendly, but have a decent\
  \ number of monsters. The final point can partially be covered by making the Shadow\
  \ Demon a villain, but we need it to not show up until we've beaten its host. To\
  \ solve the middle point, we'd really like a henchman that can defeated by either\
  \ Diplomacy or Combat, and we'd really like one of the henchmen to spawn our Shadow\
  \ Demon at some point.</p> \n    <p>Looking at those points, we can start to lock\
  \ down some parameters about the scenario. The Shadow Demon needs a Combat 20 to\
  \ defeat, which puts it on the higher end of the Adventure Deck 2 villains, which\
  \ means that this likely wants to be an AD2 scenario. (It's certainly much closer\
  \ to AD2 than AD3, and the only part of the demon's powers that make the check harder\
  \ is requiring the Magic trait. That's not trivial in AD2, but it's not hard either.)\
  \ At this point in the game's power curve, the only henchman that has both a Diplomacy\
  \ and a Combat check to defeat is the Corrupted Soldier. Since there's only one\
  \ of him in the box, we'll have to use a proxy, much like the <a href=\"/pfsacg\"\
  >Adventure Card Guild</a> scenarios. It's ugly, but it'll do. <i>[Tanis: Welcome\
  \ to my world.]</i></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-CorruptedSoldier.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It's like a shell game, but if you lose, hundreds of people\
  \ die.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Spawning the Shadow Demon is going to have to be\
  \ part of the scenario mechanics, since there's no other place to put it. What we\
  \ want is a way to randomly pick which one of the Corrupted Soldiers in the scenario\
  \ is actually a Shadow Demon. Whatever method we devise must not fail to produce\
  \ a Shadow Demon if all the Corrupted Soldiers are encountered and defeated, which\
  \ means we'd prefer a random event that was dependent on previous events (such drawing\
  \ cards from a pile without replacement) as opposed to an independent event (such\
  \ as a die roll). Stack of cards it is then!</p> \n    <p>If we place one Corrupted\
  \ Soldier in each location, we need a stack of cards with 1 Shadow Demon and (#\
  \ of locations - 1) other cards. When we defeat a Corrupted Soldier, we flip a card\
  \ from the stack. If it's a Shadow Demon, then we shuffle it into the deck of the\
  \ Corrupted Soldier we just defeated. If it's not, then maybe we banish the card\
  \ to the box and we can attempt to close the location as usual. While I was brainstorming\
  \ and writing the scenario, the extra cards were blessings. As I wrote up the scenario\
  \ for initial playtesting, they became allies that you automatically acquired for\
  \ a couple of reasons. First, having a second deck that mostly consisted of blessings\
  \ next to the scenario card sounded confusing. The second reason was thematic. Shadow\
  \ Demons are all about confusing you as to who your allies are. Gaining an ally\
  \ when you defeat a Corrupted Soldier reinforces the idea that you are eliminating\
  \ the ally as a suspect for the demonic possession. This does mean that it's possible\
  \ that your crusader ally was a Wolf all along, but that's funny and I stopped worrying\
  \ about being 100% thematic every time a bell fell on me in the Forest during Rise\
  \ of the Runelords.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-FallingBell.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-FallingBell_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>I assure you, it made a sound.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>At this\
  \ point, we have the meat of the scenario written down and we're just filling in\
  \ details. Locations are the biggest detail we haven't filled in yet. We want locations\
  \ that have positive or neutral benefits for the characters, but still have monsters\
  \ in their deck lists, and we want locations from Adventure Deck 2 or lower. That\
  \ leads us to Cathedral of St. Clydwell, Citadel, Dark Forest, Laboratory, Watchtower,\
  \ Defender's Heart, Tower of Estrod, Celestial Beacon, and Paradise Hill. Of these,\
  \ Defender's Heart and Citadel both play on the allies theme we've got going on\
  \ and will definitely see use in the scenario, whereas Cathedral of St. Clydwell\
  \ and Paradise Hill will definitely not see play, given how powerfully friendly\
  \ they are. Most location picking is more art than science, guided by the idea that\
  \ this is your base that's being assaulted.</p> \n    <p>Finally, our reward. As\
  \ an optional scenario for an Adventure Path, we can't have this give out a feat,\
  \ as that would throw power levels in later scenarios out of whack. (Well, not by\
  \ much in Wrath, but still.) Since we're borrowing a trick from the Adventure Card\
  \ Guild in scenario setup, we're going to do it again in the scenario reward. The\
  \ scenario has given you an ally for all but 1 of the Corrupted Soldiers you defeated,\
  \ which is already pretty strong. We could give another ally for completion, but\
  \ that's boring. Instead, let's grant a cohort for use in a later scenario. <i>[Tanis:\
  \ In published designs, we avoid asking you to remember something for a later scenario;\
  \ we call this \"the memory issue.\"]</i> Luckily we have the world's first and\
  \ foremost expert on shadow demons available to us: Sir Ilivan!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Confused? Play Adventure 2!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Well, that's\
  \ the basic design done. Now comes writing everything up so that other people can\
  \ read it. I try to word things as best I can before playtesting to give myself\
  \ an extra editing pass. I went through multiple iterations to make it clearer,\
  \ and I had to change the proxy card when I realized that I would need 8 Corrupted\
  \ Soldiers but only had 7 Cultists of Baphomet.</p> \n    <p>No scenario is complete\
  \ without playtesting. One thing that my playtesting showed was that when you put\
  \ that many ally-heavy locations in the scenario, the locations get closed really\
  \ quickly—perhaps a little quicker than I'd like. I don't really have any room on\
  \ the scenario card to adjust anything, so I needed to swap a few locations. The\
  \ Cemetery replaced the Laboratory, and the Gray Garrison replaced the Watchtower.\
  \ Fortunately, the core of the scenario worked fine. Which leaves us with this:</p>\
