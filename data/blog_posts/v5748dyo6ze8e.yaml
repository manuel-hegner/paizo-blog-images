  \      <p>Emerging suddenly from deep space, a vessel traveling at speeds that should\
  \ have cracked a planet in half slowed long enough to crash into the Sloughscar\
  \ Hills of Akiton. Curious explorers and opportunistic salvagers descended upon\
  \ the wreck, among which was a mercenary team in the employ of the Starfinder Society.\
  \ Within hours, the starship’s automated defenses activated, driving the explorers\
  \ out and unleashing dangerous monsters and magical effects into the region, including\
  \ the dreaded illumantula, a terrifying monster of magic, technology, and light.\
  \ This starship was soon dubbed the Wreck of the Returned.</p>\n      <p>Believing\
  \ the Wreck of the Returned has a connection to the mysterious First Ones and is\
  \ but the first step in a devastating invasion of the Pact Worlds, First Seeker\
  \ Sarmak works to establish a Starfinder lodge in the surrounding Sloughscar Hills.\
  \ Now, Sarmak has put out a call for brave Starfinders willing to help establish\
  \ and defend this fledgling lodge and explore the Wreck of the Returned.</p>\n \

  \ Society Second Edition launches at GenCon 2025 (July 31–August 3) with the release\
  \ of a special launch adventure and four Starfinder Society Scenarios.</p>\n   \
  \   <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</h2>\n      <p>Our story\
  \ begins with <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</em>, a special\
  \ double length scenario for 3rd-level pregenerated characters written by John Godek\
  \ III. This adventure is a prequel to Invasion’s Edge and casts you in the role\
  \ of a team of Akitonian mercenaries hired by the Starfinder Society to keep a wary\
  \ eye out for any strange occurrences or signs of alien invasion. When a strange\
  \ starship crashes into the nearby Sloughscar Hills, you’re among the very first\
  \ on the scene to investigate the wreck. So grab yourself a pregen, ready your laser\
  \ pistol, and take a peek at what lies within the Wreck of the Returned! We wish\
  \ you luck in escaping alive!</p>\n      <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-01:\
  \ Invasion’s Edge</h2>\n      <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-01: Invasion’\
  s Edge</em> is the first adventure in the Invasion’s Edge metaplot! A new Starfinder\
  \ lodge is being built in the Sloughscar Hills and you’re among the first Starfinders\
  \ on site. As rookie Starfinders, you’ll lend a hand in establishing the lodge then\
  \ head out into the wilderness to examine a piece of nearby debris. This intro adventure\
  \ is written by Michael Bramnik and is designed for 1st- and 2nd-level characters.</p>\n\
  \      <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-02: Mystery of the Frozen Moon</h2>\n\
  \      <p>Every year, the Starfinder Society learns of thousands of newly discovered\
  \ planets, planetoids, moons, and other stellar bodies, many of which sustain life.\
  \ Each location is closely catalogued, with the most promising marked for future\
  \ study. The frigid moon of Luvoth is one such location.</p>\n      <p>Known to\
  \ the Starfinders only as Vast-723-Arctic-Moon, or VAM-723 for short, Luvoth is\
  \ one of four small moons in orbit around an unexplored gas giant in the Vast. Initial\
  \ scans of the moon indicate there’s no sapient inhabitants, but there are some\
  \ artificial structures—an intriguing mystery! Believing VAM-723 could be the perfect\
  \ jumping off point to explore the local stellar bodies and surrounding system,\
  \ the Starfinder Society dispatches a team of agents to perform initial surveys\
  \ of the moon and investigate the structures.</p>\n      <p><em>Starfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #1-02: Mystery of the Frozen Moon</em> is a first contact adventure for\
  \ 1st- and 2nd-level characters written by Solomon St. John.</p>\n      <h2>Starfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #1-03: Disaster at Dreamlink Labs</h2>\n      <p>When a nascent\
  \ godling called the Newborn was birthed from the planet Aucturn in 324 AG, chunks\
  \ of its planetary womb and embryonic fluids were cast across the Pact Worlds. Most\
  \ of this debris—called aucturnite—collected at the outer rim of the system, in\
  \ a region known as the Gelid Edge. This forlorn field of ice and technomagical\
  \ debris is a realm of occult power, haunted starship wrecks, and unknown horrors.\
  \ Yet, for all its dangers, the Gelid Edge is a frontier of new discoveries and\
  \ forbidden knowledge, and many Newborn evangelists, anomaly hunters, and occult\
  \ researchers have flocked to the region to learn its secrets.</p>\n      <p>When\
  \ the Starfinder Society is contacted by scientists from Dreamlink Laboratories,\
  \ who claim to have made an important discovery in the Gelid Edge, Venture-Captain\
  \ Arvin dispatches a team of agents to investigate. Unfortunately, something has\
  \ invaded Dreamlink Labs… and time is running short for the lab’s survivors.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-03: Disaster at Dreamlink Labs is a horror\
  \ adventure for 1st- and 2nd-level characters written by Caryn DiMarco.</p>\n  \
  \    <h2>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-04: The Great Absalom Relay</h2>\n     \
  \ <p>The Starfinder Society is one of a dozen prominent organizations invited to\
  \ participate in the Great Absalom Relay, a live-streamed relay race across Absalom\
  \ Station and the most anticipated charity event of the year! Charm the audience\
  \ and upstage your competition as you overcome obstacles and compete in challenges\
  \ in this showcase of Absalom Station’s hotspots. Win or lose, the spotlight’s on\
  \ you!</p>\n      <p><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-04: The Great Absalom Relay</em>\
  \ is a social adventure for 1st- and 2nd-level characters written by Alex Speidel.</p>\n\
