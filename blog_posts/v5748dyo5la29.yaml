  \ Fiction's Original Badass</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 5, 2008</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'd edited the thing twice, so I really should have expected it. Still,\
  \ when Erik dropped our advance copy of <i>Northwest of Earth</i> down in front\
  \ of me, the resounding \"whump\" it made was immensely satisfying. You have to\
  \ understand that this thing is <i>thick</i>—a book measured less in pages than\
  \ in pounds. And at the same price as all our other Planet Stories installments\
  \ to date—$12.99—Northwest Smith is a steal for those of us who, like me as a kid\
  \ especially, strive to make each dollar buy as many words as possible.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Really, though, <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdo\">Northwest of Earth: The\
  \ Complete Northwest Smith</a></i> would be worth the price if it were half its\
  \ size. Decades before Han Solo shot Greedo, thirty years before Captain James Kirk\
  \ laid eyes on his first seductive alien, there was only Northwest Smith: a hard-bitten\
  \ spacefarer with a penchant for smuggling and mercenary work, quick with his heat\
  \ gun and even quicker with his shot glass, Accompanied by his shrewd Venusian sidekick,\
  \ Northwest paved the way for countless science fiction heroes who chose to operate\
  \ just outside the bounds of the law. With one broad stroke, C. L. Moore created\
  \ one of the most cherished archetypes of the genre.</p> \n    <p>But then, why\
  \ should we be surprised? After all, C. L. Moore was something of a trailblazer\
  \ herself. In a time when female authors were marginalized at best, and almost nonexistent\
  \ in genre fiction, Catherine Lucille Moore kicked down the doors and made the speculative\
  \ fiction audiences take notice. First published in <i>Weird Tales</i> in 1934,\
  \ she quickly rose through the ranks of the pulp authors, publishing alongside contemporaries\
  \ like Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft, continuing to excel even once her gender\
  \ became widely known. Another of her creations, Jirel of Joiry (whose complete\
  \ collected stories are available from Planet Stories as <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8d\"\
  >Black God's Kiss</a></i>), was the first female sword-and-sorcery protagonist,\
  \ a battle-thirsty, take-no-prisoners sort of warrior who showed the fantasy world\
  \ that some of those clichéd \"damsels in distress\" could take care of themselves\
  \ just fine, thank you very much.</p> \n    <p><i>Northwest of Earth</i> marks the\
  \ first-ever complete collection of Northwest Smith stories, including even the\
  \ rarely-seen \"Nymph of Darkness\" (a collaboration with Forrest J. Ackerman) and\
  \ \"Quest of the Starstone,\" a rollicking cross-genre romp in which Moore and husband\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8e\">Henry Kuttner</a> (a groundbreaking SF author\
  \ in his own right) pair Smith and Jirel together against an evil wizard capable\
  \ of moving between worlds. </p> \n    <p>I could talk all day about how important\
  \ to the genre these stories are, the manner in which they seamlessly blend ray-gun\
  \ science fiction and cosmic horror, but perhaps you'd rather hear about it from\
  \ someone more reputable... like, say, H. P. Lovecraft himself? In his personal\
  \ letters, Lovecraft has this to say about Moore's work:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>\"These tales have a peculiar quality of cosmic weirdness, hard to define\
  \ but easy to recognize, which marks them out as really unique... In these tales\
  \ there is an indefinable atmosphere of vague outsideness and cosmic dread which\
  \ marks weird work of the best sort. The distinctive thing about Miss Moore is her\
  \ ability to devise conditions and sights and phenomena of utter strangeness and\
  \ originality, and to describe them in a language conveying something of their outre,\
  \ phantasmagoric, and dread-filled quality.\"—H. P. Lovecraft</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>So there you have it. Even seventy years ago, the authors of the day\
  \ understood that this C. L. Moore person was a breed apart—someone of imagination\
  \ and prose far beyond the standard pulp author. We're putting out a lot of great\
  \ books this year, but it's with distinct and especial pride that we're releasing\
  \ <i>Northwest of Earth.</i> I hope you enjoy it.</p> \n    <p>And now, because\
  \ everyone loves free samples, a teaser:</p> \n    <blockquote> <i><p> For a minute—\
  for two minutes—nothing happened. Then, watching the wall, Smith thought he could\
  \ discern the shape of the symbol that had been traced. Somehow it was becoming\
  \ clear among the painted characters. Somehow a grayness was spreading within the\
  \ outlines he had watched his own hands trace, a fogginess that strengthened and\
  \ grew clearer and clearer, until he could no longer make out the traceries enclosed\
  \ within its boundaries, and a great, misty symbol stood out vividly across the\
  \ wall.</p> <p>He did not understand for a moment. He watched the grayness take\
  \ on density and grow stronger with each passing moment, but he did not understand\
  \ until a long curl of fog drifted lazily out into the room, and the grayness began\
  \ to spill over its own edges and eddy and billow as if that wall were afire. And\
  \ from very far away, over measureless voids, he caught the first faint impact of\
  \ a power so great that he knew in one flash the full horror of what he watched.</p>\
  \ </i>\n     <p><i>The name, traced upon that wall with its own metal counterpart,\
  \ had opened a doorway for the Thing which bore the name to enter. It was coming\
  \ back to the world it had left millions of years ago. It was oozing through the\
  \ opened door, and nothing he could do would stop it...</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
