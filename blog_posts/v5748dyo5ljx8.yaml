  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In the final months of the Year of the Stolen\
  \ Storm, the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a> has secured all\
  \ but one piece of what it needs to destroy an artifact and unleash a powerful force\
  \ of good. As we gear up for this finale, the organized play team is gearing up\
  \ for Gen Con—all three Pathfinder Society scenarios, three Starfinder Society scenarios,\
  \ a Pathfinder Society multi-table interactive special, a Starfinder Society pregenerated\
  \ character special, five new Starfinder Society quests, a huge portion of the Adventure\
  \ Card Guild's new season, and several dozen new boons for distribution at conventions\
  \ over the course of the year. Of course we have precious few weeks to go before\
  \ those start arriving in Gen Con GMs' downloads, and there are several exciting\
  \ scenarios coming out this week.</p> \n    <p>Season 8 has had its share of metaplot\
  \ adventures, and it's nice to take a break every now and then to get back to the\
  \ basics—and by basics I mean Varisia, goblins, and Shoanti. I think <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9tl5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-822-Wrath-of-the-Fleshwarped-Queen\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-22: Wrath of the Fleshwarped Queen</em></a>\
  \ ended up being Brian Duckwitz's dream Tier 1-5 scenario, and he met our outline\
  \ with open arms and added his own flair. Brace yourselves for ancient magic, goblinoid\
  \ ambitions, and a suite of new goblins songs that are all rather charming. We've\
  \ included art by Alim Kaliberda of one of the starring goblins who just can't stop\
  \ grinning, and I think you'll find the expression quite infectious during this\
  \ adventure.</p> \n    <p>From the development team's perspective, this scenario\
  \ also presented a few special opportunities. First, it's been an excellent opportunity\
  \ to revisit western Varisia and explore consequences of the Society's earlier adventures\
  \ in the region. After all, word has circulated for several years about what the\
  \ Pathfinder accomplished in Korvosa, Magnimar, and beyond during Seasons 3 and\
  \ 4. Second, when we first started sanctioning <a href=\"/products/btpy9oo9?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Paths-of-the-Righteous\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Paths of Prestige</em></a>, Linda and I wanted\
  \ to include several prestige classes as unlockable content grounded in the campaign\
  \ setting by upcoming stories. Wrath of the Fleshwarped Queen is the first of these.\
  \ Don't worry about playing it with the \"right\" character; the boon that accompanies\
  \ this adventure opens up the character option for all of a player's PCs.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Meanwhile, the Society's busily engaged in its namesake task: finding paths.\
  \ The final piece of its artifact-destroying puzzle is not an object so much as\
  \ a place, and in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tl7?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-823-Graves-of-Crystalmaw-Pass\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-23: Graves of Crystalmaw Pass</em></a> the PCs\
  \ are responsible for plotting a course through dangerous terrain on the Plane of\
  \ Earth and tracking down a long-lost contact believed to reside in the region (you\
  \ might enjoy experiencing <a href=\"/products/btpy9hh0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-13-Captive-in-Crystal\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-13: Captive in Crystal</em></a> first, though\
  \ the adventure stands well on its own). Kalervo Oikarinen's done some great things\
  \ with this Tier 3-7 scenario, including the depth he's brought to the native outsiders\
  \ who live, work, and survive in the elemental planes. We've also been delighted\
  \ to explore how matters like art and divine representation can manifest among non-anthropomorphic\
  \ species, and this adventure delivers many such curiosities along with its engaging\
  \ story.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0822E-Grib.jpg\"\
