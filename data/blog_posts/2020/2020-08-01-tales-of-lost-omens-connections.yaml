  \     <p>“And you say they’re all connected, Miss…”</p>\n              <p>“Ah, it’\
  s Mrs. Kavint. Roverrint may be gone, gods bless him, but he lives on in my heart\
  \ and in my mind and I remain a faithful woman.” Another grimace. “Yes, I’ve done\
  \ the work to prove everything that I can to show that—”</p>\n              <p>“\
  You understand that you’re accusing Queen Abrogail of high treason,” Toulon interrupted,\
  \ “and that such accusations don’t come lightly, right?”</p>\n              <p>“\
  Y-yes, very much sir, but it’s all there! The Queen sent her foolish cousin to incite\
  \ the rebellion in Kintargo while secretly supplying the rebels with weapons and\
  \ supplies. It was her idea to destroy the Menador Keep! Do you think the rebels\
  \ had the means to do that on their own? Of course not! And then I heard that one\
  \ of those other Hellknights used it as a cover to fake her death. Trust me. I’\
  ve found the connections and I can see…”</p>\n              <p>“Mrs. Kavint, that’\
  s quite enough. I believe you. This evidence isn’t airtight, but there’s a lot here\
  \ we can work with.” Toulon stood from his desk and walked to the door. “I greatly\
  \ appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and I promise to put our resources\
  \ toward investigating this further. I’ll have one of my knights escort you out.”\
  </p>\n              <p>Mrs. Kavint sprung to her feet with a speed in stark contrast\
  \ to her age but then immediately returned to the same hobbled walk she used to\
  \ enter the office. Toulon made sure to not let on that he noticed the irregularity.</p>\n\
  \              <br clear=\"all\">\n              <p>“Thank you so much, Lictor.\
  \ You won’t regret this. Cheliax will learn the truth and you’ll be a hero. The\
  \ people need to know.” She reached out for his hand. “Thank you, thank you!”</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Yes, of course, Mrs. Kavint.” He pulled his hand back from the\
  \ woman’s tight, sweaty grip. “You have a good day.”</p>\n              <p>Toulon\
  \ returned to his desk and opened the report once again. <em>There’s definitely\
  \ something here</em>, he thought to himself, attempting to shake the woman’s sweat\
  \ from his hand. His flicks of the wrist did nothing, and as he reached for a handkerchief\
  \ he noticed it wasn’t sweat at all, but some kind of thick mucus, probably due\
  \ to her illness. <em>Disgusting.</em></p>\n              <br>\n              <center>\n\

  \              <p>“Presenting, Lord Roverrint of Belde!” announced the guard.</p>\n\
  \              <p>An old man hobbled into the throne room. Abrogail watched as he\
  \ continued his pathetic entry and she soon grew tired of waiting. “Paraduke Thurivan\
  \ claims you have important information for me,” she yelled out as he continued\
  \ his approach. “Know that I bestow you a great honor in just allowing you entrance\
  \ in my palace. Now, what have you brought for me?”</p><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b2c52717-5bb7-4c6a-a434-10bea265b2dd/073020_abrogailthrune.jpg\"\

  >Art by Sarunas Macijauskas</p>\n              <p>Lord Roverrint removed his hat\
  \ and gave a slight bow to Abrogail. “My queen, I wish to thank you for your generosity.\
  \ My family and the people of Belde believe you to be a just queen and—”</p>\n \
  \             <p>“Out with it, Lord Roverrint,” spat Abrogail.</p>\n           \
  \   <p>“Yes, my queen. I believe that the Order of the Scourge is plotting against\
  \ you. I believe that they mean to depose you with claims that you’ve committed\
  \ treason against Cheliax.”</p>\n              <p>“Lord Roverrint, if I had to accept\
  \ audience for every rumor of action against my throne, I would never leave this\
  \ room,” Abrogail replied with contempt. “What evidence do you have of these claims?”\
  </p>\n              <p>“I have acquired a copy of the material that they plan to\
  \ use as evidence against you, my queen.” The old man produced a folio from within\
  \ his robes, brimming with papers and scrolls.</p>\n              <p>“Bring it here,\
  \ Lord Roverrint.”</p>\n              <p>“Of course, my queen.” Just as he began\
  \ to step forward, he entered a coughing fit that echoed throughout the throne room.\
  \ Abrogial watched on in disgust for a moment before sending Gorthoklek to fetch\
  \ the folio. The pit fiend’s steps reverberated like massive boulders colliding\
  \ against the ground, each step wreathed in the crackle of flames. He plucked the\
  \ folio from Roverrint’s trembling hands and returned to his place beside the throne.\
  \ Gorthoklek leafed through the pages in an instant and then produced an audible\
  \ huff before closing the folio.</p>\n              <br clear=\"all\">\n       \
  \       <p>“Gorthoklek tells me that some of this evidence is flimsy. In fact,”\
  \ she smiled, “he believes that attempting to use some of this will actively hurt\
  \ their case and put them in an incriminating position. Well done, Lord Roverrint.”\
  </p>\n              <p>Recovering from his fit, Roverrint replied in a strained\
  \ voice. “Thank you, my queen. I wish only what is best for you and Cheliax. Now,\
  \ is there a possibility of a reward?”</p>\n              <p>“Yes, of course.” Abrogail\
  \ waved over a guard. “See to it that Lord Reverrint receives a handsome reward\
  \ for his loyalty to Cheliax and his queen. That will be all.”</p>\n           \
  \   <p>Abrogail stared off in the distance as the guards escorted Roverrint out\
  \ of the throne room. <em>Damned Touloc. He definitely has something here</em>,\
  \ she thought to herself as the throne-room doors closed.</p>\n              <br>\n\

  \              <br>\n              <p>A wild cackling echoed through the abandoned\
  \ home. “Yes, it is all done, Chemurr.” Mrs. Kavint threw herself to the ground\
  \ beside Lord Reverrint. “The Great Master’s will is done.”</p>\n              <p>Chemurr\
  \ gave a pleased smile. “Very well. Kavint, Roverrint, you have earned a few minutes\
  \ to speak with the master.” Chemurr extended her hand and several thick, slimy\
  \ phlegm worms crawled out from her sleeve. The worms crawled forward, up toward\
  \ Kavint’s and Roverrint’s ears. The two let out a terrible wail, one part agony\
  \ and one part pleasure, as they collapsed in a writhing pile, calling out for the\
  \ Great Master.</p>\n              <p>“The knights and her queen shall begin to\
  \ play, and soon will we see who has the will to stay.” A phlegm worm writhed about\
  \ between Chemurr’s fingers. “All while the Great Master watches and laughs.”</p>\n\
