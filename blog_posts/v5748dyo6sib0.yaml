  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The boy was in bed as soon\
  \ as supper was gone and his face was clean. It was Baranthet’s last night at Grandmother’\
  s house. He always loved harvest week, the time of year when he came to stay with\
  \ Grandmother while his parents went to check on things up north. Lin jumped into\
  \ bed too, and the two of them listened as Grandmother’s footsteps approached, waiting\
  \ for their story.</p> \n     <p>Grandmother closed the door most unceremoniously\
  \ and went to wash the dishes.</p> \n     <p>“But Grandmaaaaaaaaaaaa...”</p> \n\
  \     <p>She opened it again, laughing. “Very well, Baranthet. Where were we? Ah,\
  \ yes.</p> \n     <p>“Once, epochs and days ago, there was a worm who tended a garden\
  \ high on a mountain. The worm was very kind, always watering the trees, tilling\
  \ the soil, and making sure that creeping ivies stayed pruned so that the thousand\
  \ birds who played overhead would have a branch to sleep on if they needed a place\
  \ to rest.”</p> \n     <p>“He didn’t get eaten?”</p> \n     <p>“No, for while worms\
  \ are tasty, this worm’s garden grew flowers with the most delicious nectar, and\
  \ all the birds would rather have a lifetime of tasty treats than just one tasty\
  \ worm. The kind worm took care of the garden, and all the birds in it, even though\
  \ the flowers were so high up in the clouds that he would never be able to reach\
  \ them to enjoy them for himself.</p> \n     <p>“One day, the kind worm noticed\
  \ that his trees were withering. Distraught, he looked up to see that the rain had\
  \ gotten stuck in the sky (things get stuck there sometimes). He tried calling for\
  \ one of the birds to poke a hole in it, but they were so busy singing that they\
  \ didn’t hear him. He tried climbing one of the trees to reach it, but the tree\
  \ was so tall that he couldn’t make it even halfway up. He tried throwing a stick\
  \ to see if he could knock the rain down, but unfortunately, worms don’t have arms,\
  \ so they’re not the best at throwing.”</p> \n     <p>“Did he go to the warden?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“No, he didn’t, for he was a bit <em>too</em> polite, and he didn’\
  t want to bother the warden with such a trivial matter. And besides, he was in the\
  \ realm of the Warden of Peaks and Skies, and no matter how you look at it, that’\
  s not where a worm belongs. He thought about going to one of the other wardens,\
  \ but they were off in the other chapters of the story, so he wasn’t sure what to\
  \ do. He cried himself to sleep.”</p> \n     <p>Baranthet’s eyes were watering too,\
  \ though it was because he had forgotten to blink.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n     <p>“The Warden of Peaks and Skies saw the little worm struggling on the\
  \ ground to restore the garden, for it is the duty of a warden to care for not just\
  \ the creatures of their realm, but all creatures, and the land itself. She considered\
  \ knocking the rain down herself, but she had a better idea.</p> \n     <p>“When\
  \ the kind worm awoke, he found next to him a pair of wings, spun from a rainbow,\
  \ sitting there as if to say, ‘If you need these, they’re yours to wear.’ The kind\
  \ worm was delighted at the wings, which were exactly his size, and he put them\
  \ on, fluttering up to the rain and knocking it down. The trees drank up the rain\
  \ and sprouted a whole feast of flowers, and this time, it was not just the birds\
  \ who enjoyed them, but the kind butterfly too.</p> \n     <p>“And ever since that\
  \ day, after every Migration, the Warden of Peaks and Skies has always been one\
  \ who takes care of their home, who looks out for others, and who isn’t afraid of\
  \ change. Remember, Baranthet, that the animals of nature are part of their realms,\
  \ and they take care of their environment as much as it takes care of them. If the\
  \ realm changes, they can too… though it may take some time.”</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ boy thought of how he was so slow and clumsy that he never got picked first to\
  \ play thlipit. “Must be nice to wake up and be better at stuff.”</p> Grandmother\
  \ saw a chance for some wisdom. “Do you know why I keep dragonflies in the garden\
  \ outside?”\n     <p></p> \n     <p>“...because they don’t sting?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  True! Though they are fierce hunters, and they keep the mosquitos away. But no,\
  \ I like them because many think of change as something that happens in a grand\
  \ single moment of transformation. The worm goes to sleep and wakes up the next\
  \ morning as a butterfly. But dragonflies are different. They’re—”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Hemimebatolous!” The boy remembered reading this in his ecology book.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“Indeed!” Baranthet was mostly right, so Grandmother let it slide. “They change\
  \ little by little, until one day they can fly over the water they once swam through.\
  \ Not everyone has one moment of transformation, Baranthet—some people more gradually\
  \ become what they’re supposed to be.”</p> \n     <p>The boy seemed to think it\
  \ over, his eyes growing heavy. Lin yawned beside him.</p> \n     <p>Grandmother\
  \ stood. “There’s only one more part left in this story! My, but it feels like the\
  \ week has gone in a blink! I wish I got a bit more time with you each year, but\
  \ your parents will be back tomorrow, right after supper.”</p> \n     <p>“You’ll\
  \ tell me how the story ends though, right? Maybe after breakfast?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Of course I will.” Grandmother drew the covers up. “But that, my little explorer,\
  \ is a story for another day.” </p> \n     <p>As Grandmother closed the door, she\
  \ could hear the boy mumbling to Lin as he drifted to sleep. “I don’t know why she\
  \ always calls me that, Lin. I’ve barely left Droon, and I’m no good at swimming\
  \ or hiking or fighting or anything like that.”</p> \n     <p>Grandmother smiled,\
  \ for the stars, you see, are incorrigible gossips, though they are very far away\
  \ and we usually can’t hear what they’re saying about us, which honestly is probably\
  \ best for all involved. But some iruxis, on nights when the sky is clear and the\
  \ wind is just right, can just barely catch their whispers, and Grandmother’s ears\
  \ were keener than most. </p> \n     <p>She said to herself, too low for the boy\
  \ to hear, “You may not have explored much other than books, Baranthet, not yet.\
  \ But I hear one day, you’ll fly far from here, on just the grandest adventure.”\
