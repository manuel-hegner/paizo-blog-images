  \ target=\"_blank\">our friends at Game Informer</a> released a sneak preview of\
  \ all seven iconic characters for Starfinder. We wanted to share that image with\
  \ you as well, but first—what do we mean by \"iconic character,\" anyway?</p> \n\
  \    <p>As many of you probably already know, in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game,\
  \ as in Pathfinder, every class is represented by an iconic character: a single\
  \ individual who illustrates and embodies the concept behind that class. Originally,\
  \ way back when Paizo was still publishing the magazines Dungeon and Dragon, this\
  \ was just a convenient shorthand for us—rather than explaining to each new artist\
  \ what made a ranger a ranger, we could just show them a single piece of art and\
  \ say, \"Draw this ranger.\" But to our surprise, as these reference characters\
  \ appeared in more and more illustrations, fans began to grow attached to them and\
  \ wonder about their stories. So when we launched Pathfinder, we went ahead and\
  \ gave these characters names and backstories, and they quickly became some of our\
  \ most popular characters, going on to star in comics, audio dramas, and more. (I\
  \ know that I personally have a heck of a lot of fun writing Valeros, Merisiel,\
  \ and all the rest in the Pathfinder comics!)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n    <p>Now, with Starfinder, we're excited to unveil a whole new lineup of iconic\
  \ characters to showcase their respective classes and races! In the coming months,\
  \ we'll be giving you each character's backstory in blog posts here at paizo.com,\
  \ but for now here's a sneak preview of their art, plus their names, races, and\
  \ classes. Going clockwise and starting with the leftmost character, we've got:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Raia (lashunta technomancer)</b>: Lashuntas are\
  \ a race of telepaths, and technomancers are the magical version of computer programmers,\
  \ hacking the laws of physics.</p> \n     <p><b>Iseph (android operative)</b>: Androids\
  \ are artificial people, and operatives use stealth and skill to get in and out\
  \ of dangerous situations.</p> \n     <p><b>Obozaya (vesk soldier)</b>: Vesk are\
  \ powerful reptilian aliens, and soldiers specialize in heavy weapons and armor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Keskodai (shirren mystic)</b>: Shirrens are insectile people who\
  \ recently broke free from a predatory hive mind, and mystics channel the universe's\
  \ mysterious energies, often through faith in a god.</p> \n     <p><b>Altronus (kasatha\
  \ solarian)</b>: Kasathas are four-armed aliens from a desert world, and solarians\
  \ shape the energy of stars and black holes into armor and weapons for themselves.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Navasi (human envoy)</b>: Humans are... well, humans, and envoys\
  \ use wit and charm to bolster their allies and demoralize or befuddle enemies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Quig (ysoki mechanic)</b>: Often called \"ratfolk,\" ysoki are a\
  \ plucky and hotheaded race, and mechanics build their own custom drones or rely\
  \ on an implanted AI to aid them in combat.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Which\
  \ of course leads to the question—which of these is your favorite? Let us know in\
  \ the comments below, and stay tuned for more Starfinder previews and design blogs!</p>\
