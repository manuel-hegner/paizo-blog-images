  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Last month,\
  \ we offered a blog post that was the foundation of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldzu\"\
  >building your community</a>. I wanted to build on that theme and have a series\
  \ of blog posts that discuss how to contibute to and grow your local Pathfinder\
  \ Society community.</span> </p>\n     <p>The first bullet point in that post suggested\
  \ that you should offer to GM. However, you may feel you aren't experienced enough\
  \ or don't know the rules well enough to be a \"good GM.\" One thing I have learned\
  \ in my years of gaming is that often people who want to GM, but who feel too shy\
  \ or uncomfortable running a table, actually turn out to be some of the best GMs.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Over the past year, our Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants have\
  \ often said that there is a lack of GMs. This is why I worked with a group of the\
  \ best GMs in the Georgia area (people I had personal experience playing with and\
  \ GMing for) to develop a GM 101 course. This course debuted at PaizoCon and was\
  \ also offered at Gen Con. The feedback from attendees was incredibly positive and\
  \ it is now time to share the course with everyone. The <a href=\"/products/btpy8vq7\"\
  >GM 101 instructional PDF</a> will support the running of GM 101 courses in your\
  \ area. Even if someone just reads the GM 101 course, there is a ton of great information\
  \ to be shared.</p> \n     <p>The course is divided into four lessons, each lasting\
  \ approximately one hour. These include \"Roleplaying: Bringing Scenarios to Life,\"\
  \ \"Rules: Enabling Awesomeness, Restricting Abuse,\" \"Running the Game: The Science\
  \ Behind the Art,\" and \"Advanced Topics: When the Unexpected Strikes.\" These\
  \ four basic topics will allow new GMs to ease into the role and also feel more\
  \ comfortable overseeing the enjoyment of a table for a group of four to six players.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>One thing the GM 101 PDF refers to in the second half of the course,\
  \ but that it does not include, is the Deck of Many Situations. This deck allows\
  \ new GMs who have been through the four building-block lessons above to take those\
  \ instructions and adjudicate real situations that have occurred at Pathfinder Society\
  \ tables at local game days and regional and national conventions. I will refer\
  \ you to several of our Venture-Captains for access to the deck. They have developed\
  \ different decks, which include situations encountered in their local regions.\
  \ If you would like to obtain a Deck of Many Situations, please refer to the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\">Pathfinder Society Regional\
  \ Coordinators page</a>. If your Regional Coordinator does not have a copy of the\
  \ Deck of Many Situations, he or she will be able to obtain one from another Venture-Captain\
  \ and provide it to you. Some of the more memorable situations I was able to be\
  \ a part of at Paizo Con were \"warring spouses\" and \"a child pitching a temper\
  \ tantrum\" (yes, I was playacting the child). It was interesting to see how GMs\
  \ handled both of those very tricky situations.</p> \n     <p>The other PDF I wanted\
  \ to provide for download today was the <a href=\"/products/btpy8vq8\">Kid's Track\
  \ lesson plans</a>. The lifeblood of our hobby is the next generation. A decade\
  \ ago, I took my son to his first Gen Con when he was eight years old. There was\
  \ very little for him to actually participate in or be involved with at that age.\
  \ Over the years, I had toyed with the idea of creating some kid's games so that\
  \ young children would have something to do. When I was hired by Paizo, it jumped\
  \ to the top of my priority list since I had resources available that I had never\
  \ had before. I reached out to Ontario Venture-Lieutenant Jeff Mahood to help me\
  \ develop a lesson plan. He has experience with early childhood education and I\
  \ wanted to gear these lesson plans for kids that were six to twelve years old.\
  \ What he put together and provided blew me away and I can't thank him enough for\
  \ his work on it. </p> \n     <p>With this awesome document in hand, I was unsure\
  \ how it would go over at Gen Con. I reached out to several store owners and forum\
  \ members, and received overwhelmingly positive feedback, so I put it on the official\
  \ Gen Con schedule. We sold out every slot at Gen Con and ran eight unscheduled\
  \ overfill tables. With the reponse we had at Gen Con 2012, I have my sights on\
  \ expanding the program even more at Gen Con 2013.</p> \n     <p>What the Kid's\
  \ Track lesson plan offers is four lessons on the basics of roleplaying games, broken\
  \ down by the total minutes spent on each subject, using the Pathfinder RPG Beginner\
  \ Box to teach those fundamentals. Each lesson builds on the previous lesson and\
  \ helps a GM teach children as young as six what roleplaying games are and how to\
  \ play roleplaying games, specifically using the <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Beginner Box</i></a> rules. Each lesson plan is followed by the four children\
  \ playing one of the four <a href=\"/products/btpy8q4o\">Beginner Box Bash Demo\
  \ adventures</a>.</p> \n     <p>I hope you find both of these PDFs useful for building\
  \ Pathfinder Society, and roleplaying in general, in your community. I would love\
  \ to hear your feedback on how we can make these programs better and look forward\
  \ to reading your comments.</p> \n     <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign\
  \ Coordinator</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Society\
