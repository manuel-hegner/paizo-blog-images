  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Saturday, August 8, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We just got back from a great Gen Con where\
  \ we met thousands of people interested in <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Pathfinder Online</a>, and we gave out around 1,700 postcards inviting\
  \ people to check out the game. We were running the Elemental Rift escalation all\
  \ weekend with a giant screen showing the action to everyone while veteran players\
  \ took turns fighting pesky elementals for the crowds. Overall, it was a really\
  \ fun weekendâ€”I especially loved putting real-life faces to many in-game avatars.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One question came up over and over at the con: Can you play Pathfinder\
  \ Online solo? In a game billed as massively multiplayer, with territory control\
  \ and settlement building as main features, is solo play even viable?</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The answer is that while you really need to join a settlement for training\
  \ purposes, there are many activities that you can pursue on your own that don't\
  \ force you to interact with others.</p> \n    <p>Gathering raw materials is usually\
  \ a solitary endeavour. Heading out into the wilderness to find some rare ingredient\
  \ can be very zen-like as you move from resource node to resource node discovering\
  \ what bounties the wild has to offer. Sure, harvesting in a group can provide safety\
  \ from NPCs and other players, but there is something very satisfying about exploring\
  \ the world and its resources without having to communicate with other gatherers.</p>\

  \     <br><i>Tenbar checks out a forest node near Pathfinder University.</i>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Crafting is also a solitary pursuit. You can train your character\
  \ in all the skills you might need to make certain items such as weapons or armor,\
  \ from gathering to refining to crafting. You will want almost certainly want to\
  \ buy or sell raw materials, refined goods, or finished products, but you can do\
  \ that via the auction house, interacting only indirectly with buyers and sellers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>On the PVE side, it is rather easy to go out hunting solo as long as\
  \ you're careful about which groups you initiate combat with. You'll eventually\
  \ learn which groups you can take down with ease, which are a bit of a challenge,\
  \ which you can defeat with some help and a little luck, and which will almost surely\
  \ result in your demise. Part of the fun of solo combat is that you can constantly\
  \ challenge yourself, testing the limits of your abilities. When you are in a group,\
  \ it is never certain what part you played in the success or defeat of your group,\
  \ but when you are solo, the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat is solely\
  \ in your hands. But no one will be there to heal you back to health if you bite\
  \ off more than you can chew, or to help you take down a particularly difficult\
  \ foe.</p> \n    <p>Obviously, the territorial aspect of PFO isn't for the solo\
  \ player. Running a settlement and generating the influence needed to make it viable\
  \ is something that dozens of players need to do together. Even holdings and outposts\
  \ need a handful of players to put up and run. But there are many other ways a solo\
  \ player can contribute to a game which focuses on the interactions of many players.</p>\
