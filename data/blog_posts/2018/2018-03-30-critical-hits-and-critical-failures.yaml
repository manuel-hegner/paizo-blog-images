  ></a>\n             </div>\n             <p itemprop=\"description\">In the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em>, when you roll your d20, there's more than just success\
  \ and failure on the line. You can also critically succeed or critically fail at\
  \ a variety of checks, from attack rolls, to saving throws, to skill checks and\
  \ beyond. Rules like these have always been a part of Pathfinder—for example, if\
  \ you fail a Climb check by 5 or more you fall, and if you fail a Disable Device\
  \ check by 5 or more you set off the trap—but they are uncommon and not universally\
  \ applied. In the playtest, we have a unified mechanic.</p>\n             <h2>The\
  \ Four Degrees of Success</h2>\n             <p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, every\
  \ check is rolled against a particular DC. Your roll on the d20 + your proficiency\
  \ modifier + your ability modifier + all your relevant modifiers, bonuses, and penalties\
  \ make up your check result. If your check result meets or exceeds the target DC,\
  \ congratulations! You succeeded, and you might have critically succeeded. Otherwise,\
  \ you failed. If you exceeded the target DC by 10 or more, or if you rolled a natural\
  \ 20 and met or exceeded the target DC, then you critically succeeded. If your result\
  \ was 10 or more lower than the target DC, or if you rolled a natural 1 and didn't\
  \ meet the target DC, then you critically failed. Collectively, success, critical\
  \ success, failure, and critical failure are called the four degrees of success.\
  \ You can gain special abilities that increase or decrease your degree of success,\
  \ often due to having a high proficiency rank. For instance, if your class grants\
  \ you evasion, you get master proficiency in Reflex saves and treat any success\
  \ on a Reflex save as a critical success!</p>\n             <h2>Examples</h2>\n\
  \             <p>Let's start with a <em>fireball</em> spell. In Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition, if you succeed the Reflex save, you take only half damage, and evasion\
  \ allows you to take no damage on a successful save. In Pathfinder Second Edition,\
  \ here are the degrees of success for fireball (and many of its old friends like\
  \ <em>lightning bolt</em> and <em>cone of cold</em>) in the playtest.</p>\n    \
  \         <ul style=\"list-style: none;\">\n              <b>Success</b> Half damage\
  \ \n              <li><b>Critical Success</b> No damage</li>\n              <li><b>Failure</b>\
  \ Full damage</li>\n              <li><b>Critical Failure</b> Double damage</li>\n\
  \             </ul>\n             <div class=\"blurb360\">\n              <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180330-Weapons.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180330-Weapons_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <p><em>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</em></p>\n          \
  \   </div>\n             <p>Any character who critically succeeds takes no damage,\
  \ and characters with evasion count their successes as critical successes. What\
  \ about someone legendary at Reflex saves with improved evasion? They count critical\
  \ failures as failures and thus can never suffer the deadliest effects of a Reflex\
  \ save, even on a natural 1!</p>\n             <p>Not all effects list all four\
  \ degrees of success. If an effect doesn't list a critical success entry, that means\
  \ there is normally no special effect for critically succeeding, so you just use\
  \ the result for a success. Similarly, if an effect doesn't list a critical failure\
  \ entry, there is normally no special effect for critically failing, so you just\
  \ use the result for a failure. If a success entry is missing, that means nothing\
  \ happens on a success, and if a failure entry is missing, that means nothing happens\
  \ on a failure. Let's take a look at an example that combines two of these rules:\
  \ the results of a basic attack called a strike.</p>\n             <blockquote>\n\
  \              <p><b>Success</b> You deal damage, which equals the weapon's or unarmed\
  \ attack's damage dice plus your Strength modifier if it's a melee attack, plus\
  \ any bonuses.</p>\n              <p><b>Critical Success</b> You deal double damage—\
  you roll twice as many damage dice and add double the ability modifier and double\
  \ any other bonuses to damage.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n             <p>Let's\
  \ unpack what this means. You deal damage on a success and double damage on a critical\
  \ success. Since there is no failure entry, that means normally nothing happens\
  \ on a failure, and since there is no critical failure entry, that means a critical\
  \ failure has the same effect as a failure, so nothing happens. But the fighter\
  \ might have something to say about that! The fighter can use the special certain\
  \ strike action, which lets him strike with the following failure effect.</p>\n\
  \             <blockquote>\n              <p><b>Failure</b> Your attack deals the\
  \ minimum damage. (Treat this as though you had rolled a 1 on every die.)</p>\n\
  \             </blockquote>\n             <p>So with certain strike, a failed attack\
  \ roll isn't actually a miss—your fighter is so skilled that you still get a glancing\
  \ blow on a failure and miss entirely only on a critical failure! Meanwhile, a fighter\
  \ with the twin riposte reaction can use one weapon to parry and attack with the\
  \ other weapon whenever an enemy critical fails an attack roll.</p>\n          \
  \   <h2>Save or Lose</h2>\n             <p>One of the effects of the four degrees\
  \ of success that adds the most fun to the game is what this means for save or lose\
  \ effects—effects where if you fail your save, you're unable to continue the fight.\
  \ These sorts of effects are tricky in almost every roleplaying game, and Pathfinder\
  \ is no exception. In Pathfinder First Edition, even if your character has a 75%\
  \ chance of succeeding at your Will save against a mummy's paralysis, chances are\
  \ pretty high that four mummies are going to paralyze you. (Thanks a lot for that\
  \ encounter in your Pathfinder Society Scenario, Jason!)</p>\n             <p>It's\
  \ tempting to just decide the solution is not to have save or lose effects, but\
  \ that really cuts off a wide variety of classic feats, monster abilities, and spells\
  \ from the game. The flip side of those abilities is that if they don't just win,\
  \ chances are that many of these effects are just wasting a turn. So you either\
  \ cast the save or lose spell and win, or you cast it and waste the turn. Having\
  \ those as the only two outcomes is not a great proposition, and of course, players\
  \ and GMs often maximize their DCs and saving throw bonuses in order to tilt the\
  \ outcome to their side as much as possible.</p>\n             <p>But with four\
  \ degrees of success, suddenly the design space broadens significantly. You can\
  \ still suffer an effect that takes you out of the action entirely on a critical\
  \ failure, and you can completely ignore the effect on a critical success. But on\
  \ a failure, you suffer a powerful effect but not one that takes you entirely out\
  \ of the fight in one go, and even on a success, you suffer a milder effect that\
  \ is still useful for the spell's caster. For example, if you critically fail your\
  \ save against <em>dominate</em>, you are completely under the spellcaster's control,\
  \ but if you only fail, you can try to break out of the effect each round. On a\
  \ successful save, you aren't controlled, but you still lose an action on your next\
  \ turn as you struggle to fight off the mental commands, which could be a serious\
  \ problem—you might not be able to step away before casting a spell, or have time\
  \ to raise a shield.</p>\n             <h2>Some Mysterious Critical Effects</h2>\n\
  \             <p>I'm closing out with some cool critical effects that result from\
  \ critical successes on your attack rolls or skill checks or from critical failures\
  \ on your enemy's saving throws. See if you can figure out where they come from!</p>\n\
  \             <ul>\n              <li>The creature is banished and can't return\
  \ to your home plane by any means for 1 week.</li>\n              <li>The creature\
  \ takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.</li>\n              <li>The\
  \ target believes the fact for an unlimited duration.</li>\n              <li>The\
  \ target's intellect is permanently reduced below that of an animal, and it treats\
  \ its Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom modifiers as –5. It loses all class abilities\
  \ that require mental faculties, including all spellcasting. If the target is a\
  \ PC, she becomes an NPC under the GM's control.</li>\n              <li>The creature\
  \ is pushed 30 feet in the direction of the wind, is knocked prone, and takes 2d6\
  \ bludgeoning damage.</li>\n              <li>You grant a +4 circumstance bonus.</li>\n\
  \              <li>Per a failure, except the target believes that everyone it sees\
  \ is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions and free actions against these enemies\
  \ regardless of whether they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM.\
  \ It otherwise acts as rationally as normal and will likely prefer to attack enemies\
  \ that are actively attacking or hindering it.</li>\n              <li>The target\
  \ must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. Even on a successful save, the target\
  \ is frightened 2 and must flee for 1 round.</li>\n              <li>Your target\
  \ regains Hit Points equal to 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier.</li>\n              <li>Per\
  \ a success, but even afterward, the target is too scared of you to retaliate against\
  \ you.</li>\n             </ul>\n             <p>Mark Seifter<br><em>Designer</em></p>\n\
