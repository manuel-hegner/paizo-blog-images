  \ itemprop=\"description\">Happy spring, everybody! The sun is shining, the birds\
  \ are singing, or at least I assume they are. I live in Seattle. That’s not how\
  \ it works here.</p> \n      <p>We’ve got a busy few months coming up for Organized\
  \ Play! I’m going on my honeymoon at the end of April, PaizoCon is in less than\
  \ 60 days, and after that–well, you’ll see. We’re hard at working churning out the\
  \ next few months of scenarios. I think you’re really going to like what we’ve got\
  \ planned for you!</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <h2>Digital Adventure\
  \ Releases</h2> \n      <p>These adventures will be available on April 26, 2023.</p>\

  \ \n      <p>One of the consistent problems we’ve had in Organized Play is that\
  \ there’s no one-stop overview of how our programs work to give to new players.\
  \ Well…not anymore! Thanks to some help from Josh Foster, our Organized Play Developer,\
  \ as well as Maryssa Lagervall and Andrew White on the tech team, I present our\
  \ brand new Getting Started pages for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/getstarted\"\
  >Pathfinder</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderSociety/getstarted\">Starfinder\
  \ Society</a>! These pages are intended to give new players everything they need\
  \ to get started and find their gaming group. We hope you find them useful and informative!\
  \ If you see any errors or have suggestions for improvement, don’t hesitate to let\
  \ us know.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> \n      <p>This\
  \ was a big month for Organized Play sanctioning!</p> \n      <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>For Pathfinder Society, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/gatewalkers\"\
  >Gatewalkers Adventure Path</a> recently released its final volume. <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Gatewalkers+Sanctioning.pdf\"\
  >Chronicle Sheets and sanctioning documents</a> are now available on the store pages.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The big news, of course, is the sanctioning of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy5\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Firebrands</em></a>. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43snc?Lost-Omens-Firebrands-Sanctioning-Update\"\
  >As I announced on the forums last week</a>, we’re trying something new by listing\
  \ the reasons why certain options aren’t permitted in the campaign. This is an experiment\
  \ to see if the community can handle this feedback without using it as an invitation\
  \ for debate, or as ammunition against our designers, editors and writers.</p> \n\
  \      <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n      <p>This month saw the release of the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy2?Starfinder-Adventure-Drift-Crisis-Case-Files\"\
  ><em>Drift Crisis Case Files</em></a>! We broke from tradition slightly on this\
  \ book as well by sanctioning each case file as a double-length scenario. Our hope\
  \ is that doing so provides organizers with some additional content to be run at\
  \ events with longer slots or over multiple weeks at a retail location. Let us know\
  \ how it works for you!</p> \n      <h3>Upcoming</h3> \n      <p>Looking ahead,\
  \ the next books on our radar are the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftHackers\"\
  >Drift Hackers Adventure Path</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e4y/discuss?Starfinder-Ports-of-Call\"\
  ><em>Ports of Call</em></a> for Starfinder. It’s likely that, due to internal issues,\
  \ the Drift Hackers AP will see a slight delay from street date, but we should have\
  \ it (and <em>Ports of Call</em>) ready by PaizoCon Online. On the Pathfinder side,\
  \ the next adventure release is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e50\"\
  ><em>The Enmity Cycle</em></a>in May, and we won’t have another hardcover until\
  \ June with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e6p/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Highhelm\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Highhelm</em></a>, but right now we’re on track for both of those.\
  \ We’ll also be working to ensure the documents for the Free RPG Day adventures\
  \ for both systems are available in time for the June 24 event!</p> \n      <h3>Updates</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>We’ve also just pushed a couple of minor changes to the Treasure Vault\
  \ items on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Pathfinder Character Options page</a>. We added a missing access condition to the\
  \ polytool to bring it in line with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Gods and Magic</em></a>, permitted the black tendril shot thanks\
  \ to errata, and removed the cassisian helmet from legality. Any character who purchased\
  \ the helmet can sell it back for full price.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> \n      <p>While at GenghisCon at the\
  \ end of February, I was able to award a Campagin Coin. We award these coins to\
  \ members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional\
  \ program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations;\
  \ if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or\
  \ not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com with\
  \ their name and reasons. </p> \n      <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Zach Armstrong</b>,\
  \ who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#883</b></p> \n      <h3>GM\
  \ Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in\
  \ any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone,\
  \ a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10\
  \ special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n      <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th\
  \ Star for Pathfinder Society (first edition) and two earn their 5th Glyph for Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition).</p> \n      <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Jerry Wayne<br>\
  \ <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Doug Hahn, Michelle Moniz</p> \n      <p>Congratulations\
  \ to our outstanding GMs and volunteers!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Convention\
  \ News</h2> \n      <p></p>\n      <p>Convention season is in full swing! Our <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">Convention Calendar</a> is chock-full of\
  \ events from around the world, and we encourage everyone to go out and support\
  \ their local shows.</p> \n      <h3>PaizoCon</h3> \n      <p>On the PaizoCon front,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si9u\">tickets for the show\
  \ went on sale yesterday</a>, and we're excited to see you all! Game signups will\
  \ begin on <strong>April 10</strong> for our GMs and <strong>April 17</strong> for\
  \ all attendees. Make sure to register <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-2023\"\
  >on our Warhorn</a> beforehand so we can get you set up to sign up!</p> \n     \
  \ <p>We’re also excited to be partnering with KublaCon in California for <strong>PaizoCon\
  \ @ KublaCon</strong>! If you’re interested in playing in physical space with the\
  \ community, they’re our exclusive partner for a physical event this year. You’\
  ll be able to play all the new PaizoCon releases, including the Starfinder Special\
  \ on Saturday morning, and watch the panels from their viewing space. Tickets and\
  \ hotel rooms are available now <a href=\"https://kublacon.com/\">on their website</a>,\
  \ and signups for games are already open <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-kublacon-2023\"\
  >on their Warhorn</a>.</p> \n      <h3>Gen Con</h3> \n      <p>This week we began\
  \ signups for GMs at Gen Con Online 2023! All the information is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si9p?Call-to-Volunteer-Gen-Con-Online-2023\"\
  >available in our blog</a>, but GMs will be able to run the new scenarios and be\
  \ rewarded as if they were attending the event in Indianapolis, all from the comfort\
  \ of their home! We look forward to seeing you all virtually, we expect a great\
  \ turnout for our events this year.</p> \n      <p>For Gen Con Indy, while GM applications\
  \ are still open, at this stage we may not be able to offer new volunteers badges\
  \ or hotel rooms. We welcome all GM volunteers, we can always use more people interested\
  \ in running tables or filling in for last-minute drops!</p> \n      <h3>UK Games\
  \ Expo</h3> \n      <p>Finally, I’m pleased to announce that I’ll be attending UK\
  \ Games Expo this year! I’ll be running a few games in our Organized Play space\
  \ and otherwise just visiting the show to make connections. If you’ll be at the\
  \ show as well, feel free to reach out, I’d love to say hi to our UK community!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! and show your flair <a\
