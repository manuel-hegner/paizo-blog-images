  \    </tbody>\n    </table> \n    <p>Cave raptors are sated; it's time to blog!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In our never-ending quest for complete fan transparency (or \"fansparency\"\
  ), we here in the Paizo dungeon like to know that our readers understand our diabolical\
  \ machinations and vile lieutenants so that they may truly tremble in terror before\
  \ our slavering horde. And while it's easy to quake in terror before those bold\
  \ names printed on the front of our books, there are just as many wicked creatures\
  \ slaving away behind the scenes, without whom our ink and pulp empire would come\
  \ crumbling down.</p> \n    <p>Enter customer service: the key to Paizo's unstoppable\
  \ march to the sea. Cosmo and Sara Marie tag-team problems with orders, website\
  \ issues, and general customer complaints, applying their terrifying cheerfulness\
  \ and resiliency to wearing down even the most dissatisfied of clientele. Longtime\
  \ fans will recall that Cosmo first joined Paizo's ranks after claiming the fey\
  \ crown by slaying Lord Oberon in ritual combat. Sara Marie came to Paizo through\
  \ PaizoCon '09, where her mastery of the hat entranced our leadership and secured\
  \ her future position in the company (as you well know, hats have been an important\
  \ aspect of goblin culture since the Outerwear Wars of 3505).</p>\n    <p> </p>\n\
  \    <p>To gain some insight into their jet-setting lifestyle of glamour and danger,\
  \ I followed the daring duo for several hours. After they parachuted from an exploding\
  \ mail plane (saving customer orders from crashing in the Andes), they stopped for\
  \ a moment to grant some insight into their role in Paizo's success.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  One hundred percent of Paizo's success is all me,\" says Cosmo (exp 2, rog 4), who\
  \ has been with the company since its magazine days. \"And the secret to my success\
  \ is emulating Sebastian in every encounter.\" He refused to expand on the subject\
  \ of \"Sebastian,\" but went on to confirm that he was, in fact, not an octopus.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"The less people have to deal with us, the better.\" Sara Marie (ari\
  \ 4, brd 2) dodged all my octopus-related probing to continue on customer service's\
  \ role in Paizo's success. \"You've never heard of me? That's good! It means you've\
  \ never needed to contact us.\" Obviously, customer service, much like assassins\
  \ and trapdoor spiders, do their best work when no one needs them.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  We are part of the community,\" Cosmo added while repacking his parachute and radioing\
  \ for pickup. \"We're here to interface with the fans. Customers and customer service\
  \ are what Paizo is all about.\" He pointed out that the website, the messageboards,\
  \ the blogsâ€”all are there to give customers better insight into Paizo, and Paizo\
  \ better insight into the customers. PFS Open Calls and RPG Superstar were created\
  \ to help turn the Paizo fanbase into the next generation of Paizo writers, and\
  \ customer service is there to make sure Paizo customers become the next Paizo fanbase.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"There are constantly new challenges,\" concludes Cosmo.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Dealing with Cosmo is a challenge.\" With Sara Marie's final comment, the interview\
  \ evolved into more of a blood feud, with each stealing the other's earpiece and\
  \ hurling literary invectives.</p> \n    <p>Without the customer service team, Paizo\
  \ would have little insight into the minds of our victims, nor would we be able\
  \ to best tailor our psychological assaults where we know it will hurt most. Sans\
  \ Cosmo and Sara Marie, we would be forced to rely once again on the phone-answering\
  \ monkey, whose courtesy is notoriously lacking, whose typing speed in unacceptable,\
  \ and whose coffee is substandard at best. They are the glue that binds Paizo to\
  \ it's customers and ensures that any dissent is stamped out, lest it foment uprisings\
  \ and attract adventurers.</p> \n    <p>So, join me in celebrating Paizo's customer\
  \ service department! Plant a customer service specialist in your back yard today!</p>\
