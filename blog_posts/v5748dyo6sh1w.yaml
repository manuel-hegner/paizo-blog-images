  \ a cold, still night in Arl, and from the thasteron-stained alleys of the Old Quarter\
  \ to the shimmering stadiums of the Vitaritech Coliseum, the people cried out for\
  \ blood. </p> \n      <p>Except for Vaereji.</p> \n      <p>The damaya lashunta\
  \ stood among the screaming throng of the Crimson Forum, oldest arena on the desert\
  \ planet of Akiton, and for a professional lounge singer, he was strangely silent.\
  \ With his pale skin and long antennae slicked down against his dark blue hair,\
  \ he ought to have stood out among the towering, four-armed shobhads and furtive,\
  \ rat-like ysoki natives, a handsome figure in his tailored black tuxedo. But tonight,\
  \ all eyes were fixed on the blood sport.</p> \n      <p>It might as well have been\
  \ an execution. </p> \n      <p>The rabble watched, enraptured, as a reptilian vesk\
  \ lifted his opponent—a grizzled, white-furred ysoki with a mechanical arm—into\
  \ the air, ripped off the prosthetic appendage, and, with a mighty hiss, tossed\
  \ the dying mammal onto the reddened ground.</p> \n      <p>Yells of violent delight\
  \ erupted at the totality of the kill, but Vaereji’s gasp was one of horror…not\
  \ merely because the ysoki was his friend—a friend he’d bet most of his credits\
  \ on—but because the fight was supposed to be a sure thing.</p> \n      <p>The barrel\
  \ of the arc pistol pressed against his back certainly didn’t help.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>“Better come with me, snazzy,” growled a voice at his ear. “You’ve got <i>singing</i>\
  \ to do.”</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121819_Atikon.jpg\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>They’d called him an adept back on Castrovel, and it\
  \ was true, but Vaereji had only used his phrenic abilities to help with his music.\
  \ To push his telepathic abilities beyond those of other lashuntas. To feel the\
  \ emotional swell of the audience between songs, hear the anticipatory desires in\
  \ their thoughts—even send them telepathic messages, if they lined up with his lyrics.\
  \ His abilities helped him put on a better show, and that was all Vaereji really\
  \ wanted to use them for.</p> \n      <p>It had been the ysoki’s idea to use them\
  \ to cheat.</p> \n      <p>The grizzled little fighter—who went by “Rusty” in the\
  \ arenas—was a regular at the Forum district clubs where Vaereji liked to perform.\
  \ One night the two had wound up sharing a drink, and then another, and just like\
  \ that, a friendship was born. Nothing more to it, until…</p> \n      <p>“Why do\
  \ they stick up sometimes?” Rusty had asked, pointing a worn metal finger at the\
  \ lashunta’s antennae.</p> \n      <p>Vaereji, then drunk, had embarrassedly slicked\
  \ them back down and mumbled, “They do that sometimes, when I use my abilities.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Abilities?”</p> \n      <p>The lounge singer didn’t get halfway\
  \ through his explanation before noticing a conspiratorial glint in Rusty’s eye,\
  \ but he’d been too drunk to care. He even bragged a little, about how sometimes\
  \ he could manage clairvoyance, or a true mind probe—not that he bothered with that\
  \ stuff most of the time. He just wanted to put on a good show!</p> \n      <p>With\
  \ a grin, Rusty assured him that he could indeed put on a good show and make a few\
  \ credits on the side, if he wanted. With the right moves, he could even make enough\
  \ to open up his own club! Maybe even get out of Arl—or off Akiton altogether—and\
  \ set up shop somewhere <i>classy</i>.</p> \n      <p>“What do you have in mind?”\
  \ Vaereji asked cautiously.</p> \n      <p>“Nothing dangerous…”</p> \n      <p>All\
  \ he had to do was perform at clubs where Rusty’s opponents (or their managers)\
  \ were drinking. Sing the right leading songs—combat anthems, usually—mixed with\
  \ the right leading set banter—“who in here’s got a fight this week?”—and even the\
  \ fighters’ surface thoughts and feelings were full of intel. Occasionally, the\
  \ ysoki convinced him to probe someone deeper, or use a mix of song and telepathic\
  \ messages to demoralize them. With the right tips and drunken secret thoughts from\
  \ his opponents, veteran fighter Rusty was able to take on all comers. He started\
  \ to climb the ranks, and Vaereji started to bet on him a little more freely. They\
  \ picked a mark, planned the fight, and, without fail, Rusty emerged from the bout\
  \ victorious.</p> \n      <p>Until tonight.</p> \n      <p>Their intel on the vesk\
  \ hadn’t been enough, it seemed, and now Rusty was dead, leaving Vaereji friendless,\
  \ in debt, with a pistol at his back. Did they expect him to pay out everything\
  \ tonight?</p> \n      <p>His assailant—a hulking android in dark estex—urged him\
  \ on. They moved past the clinking credit tables of the bookies, beyond the red-tiled\
  \ smoking rooms filled with celebrating shobhad gamblers, their eyes wide from transdimensional\
  \ pesh and the thrill of the fight.</p> \n      <p>After another few minutes, the\
  \ hall ended in a reinforced security door; the door slid open, and the android\
  \ shoved Vaereji inside.</p> \n      <p>It was a luxury box, with vidfeeds on every\
  \ wall showing looped scenes from past and current bouts. Plush chairs and low tables\
  \ sat around the chamber, while recessed yellow lights made a pleasant diversion\
  \ from the rusty red of the rest of the Forum. There were several androids in the\
  \ room, dressed in cheap suits or hoods like the one behind him, and all of them\
  \ were armed with arc pistols and nasty blades.</p> \n      <p>Except, that is,\
  \ for the woman behind the large wooden desk at the back of the room.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>“Hello, Mr. Vaereji,” she said. Her tone was polite, but it made the singer’\
  s breath catch nonetheless. She had more mechanics visible than most androids, the\
  \ joints of her synthetic skin lined with soft red light. Her eyes glowed the same\
  \ red, and when she smiled, they shimmered. “Sorry for your loss this evening.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Who…who are you?” Vaereji asked. He’d been expecting to be threatened\
  \ by debt collectors, not a gang of well-armed androids. He was starting to think\
  \ this wasn’t just about the credits he now owed the Forum. But if not that…</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“I’m the person who decides who fights who,” she said. “And until very\
  \ recently, I was very good at predicting the winners.”</p> \n      <p><i>Who fights\
  \ who?</i> Vaereji stepped backward, eyes widening with realization.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>“Stars above,” he cursed quietly. “You’re Kell-3.”</p> \n      <p>The android’\
  s silence was confirmation enough.</p> \n      <p>“Kell-3. A crimelord working the\
  \ Forum…I thought you were an urban legend.”</p> \n      <p>Kell-3 smiled, flashing\
  \ more of that red glimmer.</p> \n      <p>“So did your friend, Rusty,” she said,\
  \ and the lounge singer gulped.</p> \n      <p>“He <i>thought</i> the syndicates\
  \ didn’t care about this arena. He <i>thought</i> that Kell-3, the most feared android\
  \ on Akiton, didn’t bother with Arl anymore. He <i>thought</i> he knew this city\
  \ better than one of its own legends.”</p> \n      <p>The secret gangster of the\
  \ Crimson Forum was real, Vaereji had been ripping her off, and she <i>knew</i>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“He thought wrong,” Kell-3 said. </p> \n      <p>She let the words\
  \ hang in the air, until the lashunta choked out the inevitable question.</p> \n\
  \      <p>“Are you going to kill me?”</p> \n      <p>Even shaky with fear, the singer’\
  s voice was melodious, soothing. His words hung in the air, and the room grew quiet\
  \ for a moment, only the dim sounds of the final spectators above leaving the Crimson\
  \ Forum in satisfaction. </p> \n      <p>Then, Kell-3’s smile returned.</p> \n \
  \     <p>“Of course not,” she said. “You misunderstand. I’m a <i>fan</i>.”</p> \n\
  \      <p>Vaereji was at loss for words as she stepped toward him.</p> \n      <p>“\
  People have used their psychic abilities to fix arena matches before, of course,”\
  \ the android said. “But they’re usually thinking too big—mindbreakers trying to\
  \ sow doubt, powerful technomancers shorting out the implants of combatants they\
  \ bet against, that sort of thing. They always got caught. But you…”</p> \n    \
  \  <p>His antennae popped up again, their position beyond his ability to control,\
  \ especially when under pressure. Only just now, as he resisted the nervous compulsion\
  \ to smooth them back against his hair lest movement be mistaken as a threat by\
  \ the room full of armed toughs, did he realize that Kell-3 was wearing a glittering\
  \ green evening gown. Tight-fitting and studded with gems, it looked almost as absurd\
  \ and out of place here as his tuxedo did.</p> \n      <p>“You have a very subtle\
  \ approach, and I’d like to see more of it.”</p> \n      <p>Kell-3 stood, inches\
  \ from him, eyes like the bright red sands of Akiton itself. He understood now why\
  \ he wasn’t getting his legs broken by goons, why he wasn’t dead like Rusty. She\
  \ wanted him to work for her. He had never wanted anything like this.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>“I just wanted to put on a good show,” he choked out.</p> \n      <p>But\
  \ it was clear enough that she’d get her way. The singer was hers now. Defeated,\
  \ Vaereji met the android’s gaze, and she laughed, a high static titter.</p> \n\
  \      <p>“You heard that crowd—could you ask for a better audience? Poor Rusty\
  \ was sure he’d win, thanks to you, and that confidence led to the best bout I’\
  ve seen in months. If every match was that brutal—that dramatic—this would be the\
  \ busiest arena on the planet. With your help, it will be.”</p> \n      <p>She ran\
  \ her hand up Vaereji’s face, and he flinched, but her fingers only rose to press\
  \ up against his antennae. He blinked as Kell-3 slicked them back with surprising\
  \ gentleness. </p> \n      <p>“I just wanted to sing.” His voice was low, almost\
  \ a whisper.</p> \n      <p>When she spoke, her voice, too, was soft—but full of\
  \ the same violence as the screaming crowd. “And as long as you can learn to take\
  \ requests, you still will. With all of Arl as your audience. This city sings for\
  \ blood, Vaereji...”</p> \n      <p>Now, the arenas were empty and silent. From\
  \ the thasteron-stained alleys of the Old Quarter to the shimmering stadiums of\
  \ the Vitaritech Coliseum, the city was sated, but in a dark room beneath the bloodied\
  \ sands of the Crimson Forum, Vaereji’s latest performance was just beginning.</p>\
