  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> is just a\
  \ few days away, and that means some great adventures are already in GMs' hands.\
  \ Sure, Gen Con is important for releasing piles of new scenarios and kicking off\
  \ a new season, but PaizoCon's where we love debuting adventures that really appeal\
  \ to the engaged fans who attend that convention. The organized play team's been\
  \ saving three scenarios for just this opportunity, and that's not to mention the\
  \ delightful pair of adventures published for <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder\
  \ Society</a> this month. With our expanding cast of developers, you'll get to hear\
  \ from each of the Pathfinder Society developers about their respective projects.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>This year at PaizoCon we're debuting <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899C-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99C: The Solstice Scar</em></a>, the penultimate\
  \ version of the evolving storyline that began one year ago. We've brought on Kalervo\
  \ Oikarinen to write the last two parts of the adventure, including both this fifth\
  \ chapter as well as the final piece that debuts early in 2019. If you're new to\
  \ the whole Solstice Scar phenomenon, I encourage you to check out the <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5lkhx?Solstice-Scar-Update\">blog that details this experimental\
  \ format and its schedule</a>.</p> \n     <p>As a low-spoiler overview, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society has been helping a Kellid following recover a potent relic—a morally upstanding\
  \ favor made all the more urgent because that relic keeps a powerful supernatural\
  \ evil at bay every winter solstice. Thanks to the relic's recent theft, the Society\
  \ and Kellid following have been working overtime not just to recover it, but also\
  \ to track down the tools necessary to end the slumbering evil forever. In Version\
  \ C, the PCs are fending off an invasion, seeking out a long-lost Shining Crusade\
  \ paladin in the frozen Tusk Mountains, and finally vanquishing a powerful curse\
  \ in the Northern Fangwood in Lastwall.</p> \n     <p>The adventure is exclusive\
  \ to a handful of conventions until Gen Con 2018, after which anyone can play it\
  \ at events with three or more tables.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Next up,\
  \ Linda's got some news about our higher-level scenario this month. As she warns,\
  \ there are some spoilers about an earlier Season 9 scenario in the second paragraph.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>I'm excited to see what everyone thinks of this month's\
  \ Tier 7-11 offering, <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-20-Fury-of-the-Final-Blade\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-20: Fury of the Final Blade</em></a>. Author\
  \ Lyz Liddell has edited quite a few Pathfinder Society scenarios, and it's awesome\
  \ to have her writing for us too. Lyz's writing is immersive, creative, and beautiful,\
  \ and this scenario was truly a joy to work on. If you haven't yet played <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a>, I recommend checking\
  \ that out first, because there are spoilers ahead. So without further ado, here's\
  \ a preview of what's coming up next in the Liberty's Edge story—with a little more\
  \ context for people who were baffled by the product page.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180523-ColsonMaldris.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180523-ColsonMaldris_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Marko Horvatin</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Liberty's\
  \ Edge faction leader Colson Maldris is no stranger to crossing lines of propriety\
  \ in what he believes to be the service of the greater good, and he's learned that\
  \ his agents are willing to bury his indiscretions. This time, he's taken more drastic\
  \ action than ever before. After a wealthy man was cleared of treason charges under\
  \ dubious circumstances and several troubling measures for punishing debtors received\
  \ serious debate on the floor of Andoran's senate, Maldris became convinced that\
  \ Andoran's elite had become an untouchable class destined to destroy democracy\
  \ and bring de-facto slavery to the nation. The only way forward in his mind was\
  \ bring those treacherous \"nobles\" before a jury of people who he believed could\
  \ give them a more just trial for their crimes than Andoran's courts—the citizens\
  \ of Galt. In exchange for several concessions from the Galtans, such as a promise\
  \ that Galt would not to use their infamous soul-trapping guillotines to carry out\
  \ a sentence, Maldris arranged for the people he believed to be most guilty of corruption\
  \ to be kidnapped and transported to Galt. Yet with the captives in their hands,\
  \ Galtan authorities were quick to discard the promises they made to Maldris, forcing\
  \ Maldris to take action against them. If the PCs don't act quickly and carefully,\
  \ Maldris's rash actions could spark an international incident and possibly end\
  \ in a gruesome fate for both the captives and Maldris himself. For a peek at what\
  \ may happen to Maldris, check out this portrait by Marko Horvatin.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>But hey, when we're thinking of NPCs with controversial reputations,\
  \ we can't ignore Grandmaster Torch. Michael gives us some insights into the lower\
  \ level May adventure.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9zk5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-21-In-the-Grandmaster-s-Name\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-21: In the Grandmaster's Name</em></a> takes\
  \ place in Druma, where the PCs have been sent to intercept an agent of the enigmatic\
  \ Grandmaster Torch. Similar to a certain <a href=\"/products/btpy93m0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-12-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-1-A-Bitter-Bargain\"\
  >low level adventure from Season 5</a>, this adventure is an opportunity for players\
  \ to insert themselves into one of Torch's cryptic plots. In addition to continuing\
  \ one of the longest and most polarizing storylines of the Pathfinder Society campaign,\
  \ author Jenny Jarzabski brings some very unique challenges and story elements to\
  \ this scenario, weaving her background as a sommelier into an adventure that climbs\
  \ into the luxurious estates of Kalistocratic high society.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>In addition to the excellent opportunities to undermine Torch and several\
  \ other longstanding villains in the Pathfinder Society campaign, <i>In the Grandmaster's\
  \ Name</i> has also been a fun opportunity to present elements of Druman society,\
  \ from hardworking, handsome half-orc bartenders to confident and capable tieflings.\
  \ These illustrations by Sebastian Gomez really highlight the possibilities as well\
  \ as the colorful characters you'll certainly meet during this adventure.</p> \n\
