  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Krunzle the Quick</h1> \n   <p>by Hugh Matthews</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Axe? Noose? Garrote?</h2> \n   <p>Turn and run they did,\
  \ the leader of the three knife men just missing having his collar caught by the\
  \ guard captain. With admirable agility, they sped toward the caravanserai gate,\
  \ dodging around—or under—mules and camels, leaping over bales and chests, weaving\
  \ between startled drivers and merchants.</p> \n   <p>\"Stop them!\" Idrix bellowed,\
  \ and his guards leaped to obey. But horse-archers were at their best in the saddle\
  \ and with their weapons strung. On foot, their recurved bows still in their cases,\
  \ they were no more agile than anybody else in the crowded compound, and certainly\
  \ less direly motivated than the three now become fugitives.</p> \n   <p>Still,\
  \ the guards at the gate were quick enough to swing the portals closed. Their quarry\
  \ immediately veered toward the nearest wall, which had an elevated walkway behind\
  \ its crenellations, reached by sets of wooden steps. Two of them chose separate\
  \ stairs, took them three at a time and vaulted over the top, without pausing to\
  \ ascertain what they might land on.</p> \n   <p>The third, he of the low brow and\
  \ unsettled gaze, had found no steps within easy reach and had instead opted for\
  \ several heaped bales of velvet, from which he hoped to spring across a narrow\
  \ distance to the walkway. But the bales were too loosely stacked to offer firm\
  \ footing, and he missed his leap, tumbling back to the hard-packed earth at the\
  \ feet of a hurrying archer. The guard used one of those feet to kick the smaller\
  \ man sprawling, then used it again to hold him fast to the ground until one of\
  \ his fellows, with practiced skill, arrived to truss the captive's wrists and ankles\
  \ securely with bowstrings.</p> \n   <p>They hauled the prisoner before Idrix and\
  \ the caravan's headmen, who ordered him taken to where the three dysenteric guards\
  \ lay in the hospice. Fingers were angrily pointed and curses bitterly flung, then\
  \ the captive was taken to the city gate and handed over to the provost, whose bailiffs\
  \ hauled him off to the Gyve.</p> \n   <p>In a dank, foul-smelling chamber deep\
  \ below ground, the prisoner declared himself an innocent pearlmonger from Merab,\
  \ a victim of conspirators and mistaken identity. But the steward's torturers knew\
  \ their craft well, and soon it was established that the man's true name was Krunzle,\
  \ sometimes known as Krunzle the Quick, a self-proclaimed master thief. He named\
  \ his confederates, a pair of locals he had hired on in Elidir.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ plan had been to join the caravan as replacements for the guards they had dosed\
  \ with loose-leaf, a powerful diarrhetic. Then, while ostensibly standing night\
  \ guard, they would appropriate as much as they could carry in the way of light\
  \ but valuable goods, and disappear into the landscape until the caravan had moved\
  \ on.</p> \n   <p>\"Have you anything more to add?\" the interrogator said.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Krunzle could think of several things he wanted to say to the hulking,\
  \ wart-nosed torturer, but none of them would have served him well. He shook his\
  \ bruised head, spraying a few last drops of blood.</p> \n   <p>They manacled and\
  \ fettered him, then took him to a lightless cell and left him there, groaning on\
  \ damp straw that stank of black mold and worse. The night passed, and then the\
  \ morning, though the semi-conscious prisoner had lost his inner sense of time's\
  \ passage, and neither breakfast nor lunch arrived to mark the hinges of the day.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>At some point, a bailiff came and collected him. As Krunzle limped, clanking,\
  \ up the stone stairs, he said, \"Am I being taken before the magistrates?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>His escort laughed gently. \"We are an impoverished land, grimly overtaxed\
  \ by our Chelish overlords. We cannot afford to waste the court's time.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"But I wish to plead my case!\"</p> \n   <p>The bailiff spoke as if to a\
  \ not-very-bright child. \"Your 'case' evaporated when you confessed.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"But the confession was extracted by torture!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Most are. We\
  \ are, as I say, efficient.\"</p> \n   <p>They had arrived at the top of the stairs.\
  \ The bailiff unlocked a sturdy door and led the shackled thief, blinking in the\
  \ noonday glare, out into a courtyard. At one side was a wooden hustings, with a\
  \ set of stairs leading up. At the top of the steps were gathered some bored, official-looking\
  \ personages, while at the bottom stood a line of about a dozen wan-faced men and\
  \ women who all wore the same heavy wrist-and-ankle jewelry as Krunzle's.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"What is it to be?\" the thief said. \"Axe? Noose? Garrote?\" He shuddered.\
  \ \"Not the half-strangle followed by disemboweling?\"</p> \n   <p>The escort chuckled\
  \ indulgently. \"I have said, we are a poor country. We don't waste good flesh and\
  \ sinew.\" He delivered Krunzle to the rear of the line. \"Now stand there until\
  \ it's your turn to go up.\"</p> \n   <p>A horn blew and the courtyard's outer gate\
  \ opened. In came a motley crowd of Elidiran citizens who bustled over to the line\
  \ of prisoners and began to poke and prod their persons. Krunzle noted that great\
  \ attention was being paid to the thickness of arm and leg muscles, and struggled\
  \ to recall if cannibalism featured in the city's reputation. </p> \n   <p>Few of\
  \ the newcomers gave the thief more than a passing glance. A plump Elidiran in a\
  \ merchant's robe and a floppy hat squeezed his lean bicep. The man's mouth twisted\
  \ in a disparaging moue, and he made a backhanded gesture as if Krunzle was a fly\
  \ to be shooed away.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Baalariot.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"Baalariot gets straight to the point.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>The\
  \ inspection of the goods completed, the first prisoner in line was called up and\
  \ bidding began. Krunzle was no expert in slave-market economics, but it seemed\
  \ to him that the bidding was neither enthusiastic nor competitive: most of the\
  \ items went for a few pieces of silver.</p> \n   <p>Then it was his turn. He laboriously\
  \ mounted the hustings and looked out over the diminishing throng. Purchasers were\
  \ leading their new acquisitions away, and only two faces looked up at him. One,\
  \ the merchant who had prodded him, gave his head a shake, turned and walked off.\
  \ The other was the gaunt, blade-nosed man from the tavern and the caravanserai.\
  \ He regarded Krunzle with a dispassionate aspect and said, \"One copper.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>There being no other bidders, the official in charge of the auction banged\
  \ the butt of his staff of authority on the boards and said, \"Sold.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Krunzle was hustled down the steps and into the care of the man in the figured\
  \ robe, who scarcely cast a glance in his direction as he paid over the single coin\
  \ and signed a document held out to him on a scribe's copy board. Then he signaled\
  \ to the bailiff that the manacles and fetters should be struck off.</p> \n   <p>A\
  \ few moments later, lighter by several pounds of iron, Krunzle regarded his purchaser\
  \ from the corner of his eye as he assessed his own condition. Being unfed for a\
  \ whole day had sapped some of his vigor, and the torture had taken even more out\
  \ of him, but once out the gate and into the warren of streets and alleys around\
  \ the Gyve, he thought, there might come an opportunity or two...</p> \n   <p>His\
  \ thoughts were interrupted by the tall man's action. He placed a round metal object\
  \ against Krunzle's forehead and voiced an obscure word. The thief felt a coldness\
  \ that penetrated through to the inner reaches of his skull, and for a moment his\
  \ eyes bulged of their own accord. Then the medallion was withdrawn and the sensations\
  \ ebbed.</p> \n   <p>\"Strike yourself smartly,\" said the man who had bought him,\
  \ \"in the groin.\"</p> \n   <p>Krunzle was framing a derisory reply when a bolt\
  \ of agony shot from his crotch to every other part of his torso, and the breath\
  \ left his body. He found himself in an involuntary, knock-kneed crouch, a posture\
  \ which gave him a good view of his own fist still wedged into the softness at the\
  \ apex of his legs. The strangled sound he made was as much from surprise as pain.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Good,\" said the man who had bought him. \"Now come with me.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>\"You have inadvertently\
  \ done me a service,\" said Krunzle's purchaser when they were settled in the sumptuous\
  \ room to which the thief had been led. They had reached it by traversing half the\
  \ city, climbing to the elevated district where large public buildings and major\
  \ temples predominated. Then they had ducked down an alley—by then Krunzle was walking\
  \ almost normally—and through an unobtrusive gate in a blank wall, across a small\
  \ courtyard and through a heavy ironbound door that opened when the robed man said\
  \ a quiet word.</p> \n   <p>\"I am Baalariot,\" he said, seating himself on a backless\
  \ chair made of polished wood and curved aurochs horns. \"My profession should be\
  \ obvious to a discerning thief. You are now in my service.\"</p> \n   <p>From the\
  \ man's portentous tone, Krunzle deduced that he was expected to express a respectful\
  \ gratitude. Somehow the sentiment eluded him, but he judged that the circumstances—\
  especially the residual ache between his legs—called for a measure of dissembling.\
  \ \"I look forward to—\" he began, and was interrupted.</p> \n   <p>\"Spare me the\
  \ soft-soaping,\" Baalariot said. \"I would rather trust to my skills than to your\
  \ feigned goodwill.\"</p> \n   <p>Krunzle was not pleased at having been bought\
  \ for small change and introduced to a novel form of self-abuse, but he smiled and\
  \ agreed that his owner was a gentleman of rare insight.</p> \n   <p>Baalariot raised\
  \ an eyebrow. \"You are a canny one,\" he said. \"I believe you will not only succeed\
  \ in your mission, you may even survive.\"</p> \n   <p>The implied possibility that\
  \ he might not survive whatever the wizard contemplated immediately focused the\
  \ thief's attention. \"What mission?\" he said.</p> \n   <p>The other man preened\
  \ the lay of his robe and said, off-handedly, \"One that requires an able member\
  \ of the thieving profession.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ah,\" said Krunzle, \"I see where\
  \ the error lies. I am but a traveling pearlmonger from—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Shh,\"\
  \ said Baalariot, and Krunzle found that his lips and tongue would no longer obey\
  \ his brain. \"I've seen your transcript from the Gyve,\" he said. \"More to the\
  \ point, I know how you inveigled your way into the caravan's guards troop. You\
  \ even fixed it so poor Idrix had to talk you into taking the job.\"</p> \n   <p>Speechless,\
  \ Krunzle replied with a confessional lift and settle of eyebrows and shoulders.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"You showed intelligence and resource,\" said the man in the chair, \"\
  and, as I say, you've done me a service. I was on my way to Kerse to purchase someone\
  \ like you from the Kalistocracy's prisons—they catch some of the cunningest specimens\
  \ there, you know—but now you've saved me many days travel, there and back. Plus,\
  \ you were a bargain.\"</p> \n   <p>Krunzle's face and hands now expressed a desire\
  \ to communicate. \"You may speak,\" said his owner, \"so long as you do not waste\
  \ my time. And,\"—he glanced around at the walls of the chamber—\"so long as you\
  \ do not use... blunt language.\"</p> \n   <p>The slave found that his vocal apparatus\
  \ was his own again. He thought he understood the admonition against blunt speech,\
  \ and said, \"You have bought me to 'acquire' something for you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Technically, to 'acquire' something back from the one who 'acquired' it from me.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"And my reward?\"</p> \n   <p>Baalariot moved a finger in a circular\
  \ gesture. Krunzle felt a sudden intrusion, like a whirlwind of red-hot sand, in\
  \ an intimate orifice. After a moment, it ceased, and so did his hopping about.\
  \ \"I see,\" he said.</p> \n   <p>\"Good,\" said the wizard. \"Best not to labor\
  \ under any misapprehensions.\"</p> \n   <p>Krunzle gave over fanning the seat of\
  \ his breeches. \"So what is this object?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I cannot say.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"You don't know?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I know,\" said the wizard. \"But I cannot\
  \ say.\" He gestured toward the walls of the chamber. \"Some of the spiders and\
  \ cockroaches are in thrall to the... opposition. If I speak the name of the...\
  \ object, it will be reported.\"</p> \n   <p>Krunzle wrinkled his brow. \"And I'll\
  \ wager you can't tell me who the opposition is, either.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I said\
  \ you were canny. The small eavesdroppers do not understand much,\" he tilted his\
  \ head toward one wall, \"but they are empowered to notice certain key words and\
  \ report their utterance to the one who commands them. Then that person listens\
  \ in. Sometimes, also, the listener tunes in at random intervals.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Why don't you just kill the vermin?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Because they would be replaced\
  \ by something else, and that something might be more difficult to circumvent.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"So how do I–\"</p> \n   <p>\"I will instruct you in your duties,\"\
  \ Baalariot said, loudly, with a meaningful flick of his eyes toward the walls.\
  \ \"The floors must be swept morning and evening, the censers and braziers continually\
  \ refilled...\" He went on listing domestic requirements, but meanwhile, his hand\
  \ slipped inside his robe and emerged with a small scroll, tightly rolled and tied\
  \ with a horsehair. This he proffered to Krunzle, who took it and secreted it within\
  \ his own upper garment.</p> \n   <p>\"Your quarters are in the lower basement,\"\
  \ the spellcaster finished. \"You will remain there when not on duty. You will take\
  \ your meals—two a day—in the servants' refectory, and—\"</p> \n   <p>The wizard\
  \ broke off, and Krunzle presumed that whatever force informed him of the surveillance\
  \ had also signaled its end. He pointed at Krunzle and made a few incomprehensible\
  \ sounds, then said, \"There. I have placed you under the influence of Cardimion's\
  \ Discriminating Geas. You will go to your quarters and study the scroll. When a\
  \ chime sounds, you will set off on the mission detailed there.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  But,\" said the thief, \"I don't know what I'm—\" There was no point finishing the\
  \ complaint because he found that he was suddenly possessed by an overwhelming desire\
  \ to find the lower basement and read the scroll. He exited the room and found a\
  \ corridor. For a moment he did not know which way to go, but then a small globe\
  \ of light appeared in the air some distance away. When he turned toward it, it\
  \ moved off at a walking pace. He followed it.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
