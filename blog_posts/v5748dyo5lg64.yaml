  \ of law is only as strong as the people who uphold it, and few know this fact better\
  \ than Quinn.</p> \n     <p>The child of a former noble family of Galt, Quinn was\
  \ raised to despise the chaos that had robbed his parents of their proper name and\
  \ station, forcing them to hide as middle-class apothecaries. Yet for Quinn himself,\
  \ trained as a legal clerk and never having personally known the aristocratic comforts\
  \ his parents mourned, this was no true inconvenience. What frustrated him about\
  \ his nation was not that power resided with the people, but rather that it was\
  \ wielded in such a capricious fashion. His fellow citizens' constant false accusations\
  \ and refusal to abide by court rulings—not to mention the Gray Gardeners' tendency\
  \ to pronounce sentences completely outside the system—drove young Quinn to distraction.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When Quinn was 37, having recently lost both parents to an outbreak\
  \ of plague, his simmering rage finally came to a head. After the ruling faction\
  \ sentenced a man to death with flagrant disregard for due process, Quinn overstepped\
  \ his usual role by investigating the matter himself, turning up irrefutable proof\
  \ of the man's innocence. When his attempts to reopen the case were stymied, he\
  \ returned the night before the scheduled execution and set the man free—only to\
  \ run straight into a Gray Gardener patrol. The prisoner escaped in the ensuing\
  \ fracas, and even as Quinn ran, he heard the Gardeners shouting his name.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Quinn fled for the Taldan border, knowing that there was now a price on\
  \ his head. Yet despite all he'd lost, he found himself laughing—for here, in this\
  \ tragic debacle, he had finally discovered a sense of satisfaction he'd been missing\
  \ his whole life. He had upheld the law and defended the innocent in spite of government\
  \ negligence and corruption. By working outside the legal system, he'd helped guide\
  \ it back toward a righteous path. And he wanted more.</p> \n     <p>Thus began\
  \ a new chapter in Quinn's life. Roaming the nations of the Inner Sea, he constantly\
  \ keeps an ear out for allegations of unjust accusations or abuses of power. When\
  \ he finds one, he investigates the case himself, using a lifetime of association\
  \ with law enforcement agents and detective agencies like The Sleepless to help\
  \ him ferret out the truth. If the legal system seems fair, he often shows up unexpectedly\
  \ at the court proceedings, presenting sworn evidence and acting as defending counsel\
  \ for the accused. If he finds a court to be corrupt, he takes a more direct hand\
  \ in protecting the innocent. While he respects the law, he also knows that people\
  \ are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to\
  \ uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the\
  \ opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done\
  \ and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit\
  \ easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable\
  \ of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still\
  \ further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal\
  \ studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly\
  \ tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one\
  \ your foe never sees coming. He's loyal to his friends, and sometimes seems to\
  \ have a connection in every town, yet is also wary of associating too long or too\
  \ openly with his allies, knowing that his fight for justice has made him unpopular\
  \ with various powerful factions.</p> \n     <p>Though now well into middle age,\
  \ Quinn has no intentions of slowing down. As he's fond of telling companions, \"\
  a man needs only three things to change the world: a quick wit, a righteous heart,\
  \ and a stylish coat.\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Managing\
