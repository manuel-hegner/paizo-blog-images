  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Players who joined\
  \ us <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj06\">last week at Gen Con</a> had an early\
  \ opportunity to play the Gunslinger, but for those who missed the mayhem, I'm here\
  \ to deliver everything you need to know about the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipq\"\
  ><em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>One of the first steps I took\
  \ when preparing to work on the Gunslinger deck was to get my research on. I pored\
  \ through historical documents (internet wiki) as well as the Pathfinder RPG rules\
  \ with a singular quest: identify all of the guns we could possibly have, then stuff\
  \ them all in the class deck. You'll have a full array of lower-technology options\
  \ such as the Matchlock Hackbut, Wheellock Pistol, and Hand Cannon, as well as examples\
  \ of the higher end of gunsmithing that Alkenstar might have to offer, by way of\
  \ the Revolver, Shotgun, and Rifle.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-HeadCannon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>One shot, many kills.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Some of you might\
  \ be wondering about that Alkenstar reference. Alkenstar is a city-state on the\
  \ border of the Mana Wastes. Having to survive in that harsh magic-dead region,\
  \ the alchemists and engineers of Alkenstar invented firearms. In fact, the kingdom\
  \ still controls the supply of firearms to the rest of Golarion, with 90% of the\
  \ firearms in the world remaining within its borders. All three of the characters\
  \ in the <em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em> are from Alkenstar.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-BlessingOfAlkenstar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Look, ma: no Divine.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Some of you might\
  \ think of our iconic gunslinger Lirianne as a buccaneer, due to her presence in\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>.\
  \ The Class Deck version of Lirianne focuses more on her <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcfb\"\
  >history</a> as a shield marshal from Alkenstar that has been flung far from home.\
  \ Mechanically, she specializes in always having the right gun in hand and making\
  \ the most of its powers, as well as self-sufficiency to make her a more appealing\
  \ solo option.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneFront_360.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneMysteriousStranger_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>There's a reason she has marshal stars on her holsters.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Each of the three gunslingers in the deck takes inspiration\
  \ from one of the Gunslinger archetypes in the RPG. Far from home, Lirianne is now\
  \ a <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/classArchetypes/gunslinger.html#mysterious-stranger-(archetype)\"\
  >mysterious stranger</a> who roams from adventure to adventure righting wrongs.\
  \ That inspired me to write a short bit of doggerel (preferably read in your best\
  \ Sam Elliott impression), which didn't quite fit into the flavor text box for the\
  \ Mysterious Stranger role card:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><em>When the bad\
  \ times come, your life's in danger<br> Then appears the mysterious stranger<br>\
  \ Tip of her hat and six shots of her gun<br> On to her next stop, 'cause your problem's\
  \ done.</em></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Bring it.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our next gunslinger was inspired\
  \ by the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/classArchetypes/gunslinger.html#gun-tank-(archetype)\"\
  >Gun Tank archetype</a>. Angban is a dwarf from Dongun Hold, the dwarven fortress\
  \ in Alkenstar that invented firearms. He is a master of long guns and armor both,\
  \ making steady progress against the toughest of foes.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Oh, it's already been brought'n.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ third gunslinger is a ratfolk <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces/ratfolk.html#gulch-gunner-(gunslinger)\"\
  >Gulch Gunner</a> whose story is intertwined with Angban's. Both participated gloriously\
  \ in the Battle of the Warrens, but Skizza's glory has a very different flavor indeed.\
  \ Skizza is known for his use of bombs and fire, and other alchemical toys. He is\
  \ tremendously effective, but not the safest of companions.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Not safe for children. Or Veterans.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ class deck includes plenty of new cards, including a new <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liqh\"\
  >cycle</a>: Ammunition. Like gunslingers in the RPG, card game gunslingers now have\
  \ the ability to sift through an array of possible options to maximize their shots-to-kill\
  \ ratios.</p> \n    <p>Pathfinder really has the most amazing artists, and Gunslinger\
  \ was the first set in which I personally composed the art order. It was a true\
  \ high note of my time as a game designer to see the results, so I want to end with\
  \ callouts to some of my favorite pieces. You can see Ekaterina Burmak's fantastic\
  \ treatment of Angban above, which delivered on absolutely every detail of my concept\
  \ and then some. Two other awesome pieces were ally cards done by Suzanne Helmigh:</p>\
