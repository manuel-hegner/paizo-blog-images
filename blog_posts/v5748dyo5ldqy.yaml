  \ \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">With Gen Con just 10 days away, I wanted\
  \ to release the new and improved <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><i>Guide to Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play</i></a>, Version 4.2 today so everyone has an opportunity\
  \ to review it and discuss it before Gen Con. With the help of the Venture-Captains\
  \ and Venture-Lieutenants, and specifically the tireless efforts of Boston Venture-Captain\
  \ Don Walker to help me with wordsmithing, we have added several much-needed changes\
  \ that we think will improve your experiences in Pathfinder Society play.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Most notably, the following changes will go into effect on August 16\
  \ when Season 4 kicks off at Gen Con: </p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>We added three\
  \ new races to character creation for all players to choose from: aasimar, tengu,\
  \ and tiefling.</li> \n      <li>Scenarios and sanctioned module now have one unified\
  \ set of rules for applying Chronicle sheets to pregenerated characters.</li> \n\
  \      <li>Added all hardcover rulebooks to the Core Assumption for GMs and advised\
  \ that GMs can refer to the <a href=\"/prd\">Pathfinder Reference Document</a> for\
  \ rules from any books they don’t own.</li> \n      <li>Updated text so GMs are\
  \ now allowed to take boons when they are offered on a Chronicle sheet.</li>\n \
  \    </ul> \n     <p>There are quite a few more changes not mentioned above, so\
  \ keep an eye on the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/general\"\
  >Pathfinder Society General Discussion messageboard</a>, where we’ll be posting\
  \ a complete list of changes from version 4.1 to 4.2.</p> \n     <p>As for other\
  \ changes to Pathfinder Society play, over the past 6 months, I have taken a keen\
  \ interest in various things that don’t fit Golarion thematically or that cause\
  \ confusion with power imbalance in the context of the Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play campaign. I have talked with players that frequent the messageboards, as\
  \ well players at the various conventions I have attended. I have discussed the\
  \ topics below with Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants, as well as with members\
  \ of Paizo’s design and development teams. While some of these might work well in\
  \ a home game (and I have some players that use them in my home game), they simply\
  \ are not a good fit for organized play.</p> \n     <p><b>With that said, the following\
  \ archetypes and equipment are being removed from Pathfinder Society Organized Play\
  \ as legal options effective August 16, 2012:</b></p> \n     <h2>Archetypes</h2>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Gravewalker Witch (<i>Ultimate Magic</i> 84)<br>\
  \ Master Summoner (<i>Ultimate Magic</i> 80)<br> Synthesist Summoner (<i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i> 80)<br> Undead Lord Cleric (<i>Ultimate Magic</i> 32)<br> Vivisectionist\
  \ Alchemist (<i>Ultimate Magic</i> 20)</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Equipment</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Arcane bonded items must be listed as Always Available (thus, no firearms)</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Added to the Additional Resources on June 20:</i></p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>No Large or larger firearms available for purchase at any point.<br>\
  \ Double hackbut (<i>Ultimate Combat</i> 138)<br> Culverin (<i>Ultimate Combat</i>\
  \ 138)</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Obviously, these changes do not reflect\
  \ every problem, or cover every potential problem, in the Pathfinder Society, and\
  \ we will continue to monitor, discuss, and evaluate material as it affects the\
  \ format and as new material is released. We do not intend actions like this to\
  \ be a regular occurrence. We did not make these changes lightly and recognize that\
  \ many of you will feel like this is either too much or too little or somewhere\
  \ in between. But I feel that these changes are necessary for the health and well-being\
  \ of the campaign.</p> \n     <p>With that said, I understand the time investment\
  \ and care put into a character’s background and the planning that goes along with\
  \ making sure the character fits exactly how you envision him. If you have a character\
  \ affected by the changes above, I am offering a rebuild along the following guidelines:\
  \ </p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>You may rebuild any class levels affected, to levels\
  \ of other classes as necessary. (For example, if you have a 10th-level character\
  \ with one level of rogue and nine levels of the synthesist summoner archetype,\
  \ you may rebuild the nine summoner levels into any other class or another summoner\
  \ archetype).</li> \n      <li>You may retrain any feats that directly apply to\
  \ the changes above as necessary.</li> \n      <li>You may sell affected equipment\
  \ for the full price paid when you purchased them (as listed on past Chronicle sheets).</li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <p>However you feel about these changes, I ask that you remain\
  \ respectful of the feelings of others when commenting below. We are a community\
  \ and we all know players who probably have a beloved character affected by the\
  \ changes above. Please keep discourse civil and appropriate.</p> \n     <p>I look\
  \ forward to seeing folks at the show and am looking toward a bright future for\
  \ the campaign. I sincerely appreciate everyone who provided feedback, whether it\
  \ was for the changes to the Guide or the options being removed above, in working\
  \ together to make our organized play the best it can be for the player base and\
  \ GMs. Feel free to pull me aside at Gen Con to chat about any or all of the above\
  \ changes.</p> \n     <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p>\
