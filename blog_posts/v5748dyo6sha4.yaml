  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Feiya followed her fox familiar’\
  s nine white tails over the rocks and up the flank of a rocky butte. The night’\
  s cold still clung to the hollows of the land, but she didn’t mind it. After years\
  \ in Irrisen’s snowy woods, the chill comforted her. Cold, she understood. These\
  \ too bright plains with too few trees, however, were pure mystery to her.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Daji looked over his shoulder, cocking his head a little. She had to laugh.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Yes, my friend, I’m complaining to myself. Numeria, fascinating as\
  \ it is, is a hard place.” </p> \n     <p>He almost seemed to bob his head, then\
  \ went back to bounding along over the rocks and lichens that formed the skin of\
  \ this gray land. Feiya found his mood infectious. After all, Numeria had already\
  \ been good to her. Her contact with a Kellid tribe had given her a lead on the\
  \ most promising shrine to Desna yet. A shrine built by hermits… in a cave near\
  \ the top of this butte, far from any caravan routes or villages, shrouded in mystery…\
  \ It all reminded her so much of the place where she believed the goddess had first\
  \ called her to a life of magic</p> \n     <p>No, she was glad she had come here.\
  \ She was ready to learn more about the deity who had transformed her from a scared\
  \ girl to a powerful witch.</p> \n     <p>The butte grew steeper as she and the\
  \ fox walked, a few dead trees clawing out between the rocks as if straining for\
  \ moisture. Feiya felt herself walking more carefully, listening harder. Someone\
  \ up on the summit might hear her approaching, and the trail’s hairpin turns meant\
  \ blind curve after blind curve. She found herself moving her staff to the ready\
  \ position, even though she heard nothing besides the wind and a distant hawk.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Daji,” she whispered, trusting her gut. She slipped between two large\
  \ boulders and felt glad for their protection. “The shrine is set in the cliffs\
  \ near the butte’s summit. It’s not far now. You up to scouting it out?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>He sat down at her feet and fixed his golden eyes on her face. The hairs\
  \ on Feiya’s arms tingled. Sometimes it was easy to think of Daji as a simple animal—\
  a very special, nine-tailed animal, but an animal nonetheless. But at this moment,\
  \ she could feel a wisdom emanating from his vulpine form, a wisdom older and deeper\
  \ than any being, human or animal. </p> \n     <p>The world flashed white, and then\
  \ her eyes adjusted, viewing the landscape in a new register of colors—the shadows\
  \ more purple, the rocks more yellow. The world widened, too, her new eyes set farther\
  \ apart than the ones in her own face. Daji’s eyes. The fox glanced up at Feiya’\
  s body, quiet and senseless for the duration of the spell. She didn’t want to share\
  \ Daji’s senses for more than a minute; these boulders were only a temporary shelter\
  \ while she looked through her familiar’s eyes.</p> \n     <p>The fox spun around\
  \ and leaped over a cluster of rocks. The lightness of his body made jumping pure\
  \ joy. Feiya wished she could urge him to run even faster, just to feel his paws\
  \ in motion.</p> \n     <p>He skidded to a stop, an acrid stench so powerful it\
  \ was like a hand shoving his muzzle backward. His eyes watered a little at the\
  \ biting stink of it. Some kind of craft sat blocking the trail, its metal flanks\
  \ nearly blinding in the morning sun. The burning smell came off it in waves.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A sound whipped Daji’s head around—a sound so slight, Feiya would have\
  \ never heard it with her own ears. The fox shrank beneath the nearest boulder,\
  \ his heart pounding. The stinking craft had so overwhelmed him he hadn’t even noticed\
  \ the horrifying creature emerging from the cliff wall above him.</p> \n     <div\

  \ \n     <p>Feiya snapped her senses back into her own body. What in all Golarion\
  \ had Daji just seen? She closed her eyes, drawing up her memory and trying to reacclimate\
  \ to her human perspective. It was huge, she knew that. As big or probably bigger\
  \ than a bear. The memory of Daji’s fear made her shiver, and she pushed it away,\
  \ trying to force the jumbled images, scents, and sounds into some semblance of\
  \ understanding.</p> \n     <p>But it was nothing she had ever seen or even heard\
  \ of—some kind a giant insect or land lobster. She frowned, thinking harder. There’\
  d been something strange about its legs, those spiky, lumpy, terrifying legs. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>She wished she dared risk sharing Daji’s senses again, but it was too\
  \ big a risk. </p> \n     <p>Which reminded her. Daji hadn’t come back yet.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Feiya lowered herself into a crouch and crept through the field of fallen\
  \ boulders. Here on the north flank of the butte, she could see the strange craft,\
  \ its sides a jumble of angles and colors she couldn’t begin to describe. It emanated\
  \ a sense of alien power that reminded her of the few bits of skymetal she’d been\
  \ lucky enough to inspect in her travels. Ancient, otherworldly stuff, it had made\
  \ her skin tingle and her stomach prickle. Her eyes watered, looking at this new\
  \ thing. She didn’t know what it was, but she felt certain it came from somewhere\
  \ beyond her own sky.</p> \n     <p>Rocks clattered, and she pressed herself into\
  \ the dirt. Boulders blocked her view, but she could hear rocks rattle, shift, and\
  \ grind as something massive made its way down the cliff face.</p> \n     <p>A flick\
  \ of white in the corner of her eye made her turn her head. Daji stared out at her\
  \ from beneath a rock, curled as small as he could. She had never seen him look\
  \ so worried.</p> \n     <p>Then one of the creature’s forelegs moved into view,\
  \ and Feiya had to clamp her hand over her mouth to stifle her startled inhalation.\
  \ The thing was bigger than she’d been able to see from Daji’s one quick glimpse.\
  \ Its pointed foreleg drove into the ground mere feet from her head, shaking the\
  \ rocks around her.</p> \n     <p>She followed the greenish armor of the leg up\
  \ to a joint segment, up again, the leg widening, thicker than she was now, and—\
  </p> \n     <p>An eye.</p> \n     <p>An enormous round orange eye, staring down\
  \ at her.</p> \n     <p>The leg lifted and then slammed into the ground again. The\
  \ boulders around Feiya shifted under the impact and she rolled into the trail,\
  \ away from their crushing weight. Daji raced to her side.</p> \n     <p>She was\
  \ exposed now, but she could see the beast in its entirety. Twice as big as a bear,\
  \ its shell like an evil green mockery of a lobster’s. Giant, clacking pincers.\
  \ And on its back, pink, swollen blisters, each one pulsing, beating, throbbing\
  \ around a human brain.</p> \n     <p>Throbbing like a heart still pumping life\
  \ into someone’s suffering soul.</p> \n     <p>She didn’t think twice. One of her\
  \ oldest spells sprang into her mind, and she launched it with her full strength\
  \ of will and concentration, energy pouring out of her palm and slamming into one\
  \ of the pustules on the creature’s back. The power stirred a surge of dark glee\
  \ in her heart, and she laughed, the laughter spurring her ray’s power longer and\
  \ harder. The pustule exploded. A shriek filled Feiya’s mind, its words unfathomable\
  \ but its rage palpable. Her mind faltered at the strength of the creature’s horrible\
  \ anger.</p> \n     <p>The creature twitched a pincer and Feiya felt herself fly\
  \ through the air, gripped by an invisible claw. For a second, she hovered above\
  \ the ground, staring down at the alien monster whose magic held her tight.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then she soared sideways into the trunk of a dead tree and slid down\
  \ it, her head spinning, the air knocked out of her. Someplace in the distance,\
  \ Daji growled. Feiya could only stare up at the horrible creature walking toward\
  \ her, its shell nearly blotting out the sky, its remaining brains pulsing harder\
  \ than ever.</p> \n     <p>There was only one way that her brain wouldn’t soon occupy\
  \ another grotesque pustule on the creature’s back.</p> \n     <p>Feiya glanced\
  \ toward her familiar, who now stood just behind the approaching horror, his tails\
  \ splayed wide, ears back and teeth bared. “Yes, Daji,” she whispered as her fingers\
  \ twitched, the magical force of a terrible curse forming around them. “I was thinking\
  \ the same thing.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
