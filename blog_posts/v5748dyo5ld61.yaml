  date\">Friday, February 24, 2012</p> \n    <p>There's just no two ways about it.\
  \ If you read through this Pathfinder Battles Rise of the Runelords preview, you're\
  \ putting yourself at risk of some plot spoilers. If you plan to play through the\
  \ campaign, I highly recommend that you do not look super-closely at the miniatures\
  \ I'm revealing today, as they could spoil a couple of fun surprises in the Adventure\
  \ Path. </p> \n    <p>Our new <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a> hardcover is set to release this summer\
  \ around the same time as the Rise of the Runelords miniatures set (still no specifics\
  \ on release date or price for the miniatures, alas). The hardcover collects the\
  \ entire classic first Pathfinder Adventure Path in a newly revised edition, with\
  \ plenty of fun bells and whistles we'll be revealing over the next few months.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So a lot of people who have not yet had a chance to play the campaign\
  \ will soon get that chance. If you think you'll be one of them, and you want to\
  \ maintain your sense of surprise as long as possible, I suggest that you stop reading\
  \ immediately.</p> \n    <p>Don't say I didn't warn you.</p> \n    <div style=\"\

  /image/content/Blog/120224-AldernFoxglove.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n      </div> \n \
  \     <p>First up this week we have Aldern Foxglove, a local lord encountered by\
  \ the player characters in the opening encounters of the campaign. Foxglove serves\
  \ as an ally and patron to the heroes, and stars in some additional expanded encounters\
  \ in the hardcover, written by James Jacobs, who introduced Aldern the first time\
  \ way back in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7zkq\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #1</a>. </p> \n      <p>Aldern is one of many NPCs to\
  \ receive a new illustration in the Anniversary Edition. In many cases, we ordered\
  \ these new pieces of art specifically because we knew the character needed a miniature.\
  \ In the original, we only ever saw an image of Aldern's face, so this time we wanted\
  \ to make sure that we captured his entire body. I think this figure, a rare, also\
  \ doubles nicely for any male noble, city dandy, or even a well-dressed bard player\
  \ character.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120224-SkinsawMan.jpg\"\
  \ border=\"0\">\n      </div> \n      <p>And here we have the rare The Skinsaw Man,\
  \ who for whatever reason seems to have gotten a hold of a familiar jacket. I won't\
  \ say much more here, other than to mention that this figure has a long purple tongue\
  \ you can't quite make out in the photo, and that the splattered blood effects bring\
  \ me much personal joy and satisfaction. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n       <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120224-Lucrecia.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n \
  \     </div> \n      <p>A noble figure like Aldern Foxglove could really use a well-dressed\
  \ woman at his side, and for these purposes we've included the cunning Lucrecia,\
  \ also a rare figure. Lucrecia makes a great figure for any female noble, and she\
  \ plays an important role in the middle part of the Rise of the Runelords campaign.\
  \ Generally speaking, we try to limit specific characters to the rare rarity. While\
  \ everyone can use a nice figure of a noblewoman holding a glass of wine, you don't\
  \ really need a ton of them. Placing these specific figures at the higher rarity\
  \ also gives our partners at WizKids the opportunity to layer on some really great\
  \ detail, like the brocade work on Lucrecia's dress and the detail on her corset.\
  \ Given how many folks liked the unarmed <a href=\"/products/btpy8qj8\">Human Druid</a>\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> as a townsfolk figure,\
  \ I think a lot of people are going to get a kick out of Aldern Foxglove and Lucrecia!</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120224-LamiaMatriarch.jpg\"\
  \ border=\"0\">\n      </div> \n      <p>And because every preview blog needs a\
  \ good monster, here's the uncommon Lamia Matriarch. This Large snake-woman has\
  \ multiple uses throughout the campaign, covering two major enemies in the first\
  \ half of the Adventure Path. I don't include her in this blog for any other reason.\
  \ None at all. Humm dee dummm dee dooo.</p> \n     </div>\n    </div>\n    <br>\
  \ \n    <p>So! I hope you guys dig this latest batch of releases. They look great\
  \ in hand, and I'm thrilled to have them in the set. By the time you read this,\
  \ an agent of WizKids is already at the Paizo office, having delivered the very\
  \ final miniatures for us to approve and photograph for future preview blogs. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>That means the final details on the Rise of the Runelords set, such as\
  \ price and official release date, must be just over the horizon!</p> \n    <p>Erik\
