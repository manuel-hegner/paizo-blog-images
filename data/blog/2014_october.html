            <p itemprop="description">The happiest of Halloweens to all of you out there in Previewland! We're a little under three weeks from the November 19 release of <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>, the newest 45-figure <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set. We've recently simplified our <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>, so if you want to make sure you don't miss a single figure setting up a subscription in the next week or so before we start shipping them is your best bet. I brought home a case of my own this week, and I'm really happy with how the set turned out. The giant <a href="/products/btpy96k7">Shemhazian Demon Case Incentive</a> figure is fantastic, and the set includes lots of other favorites like Lamashtu cultists, Lamashtu herself, and the stupidest (and I mean that in a GREAT way) Hill Giant Chieftain ever created in prepainted plastic. I think you guys are really going to enjoy this one.</p>

               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-HillGiant.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-HillGiant_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>But we're not here today to talk about <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>! Instead, let's cast our minds forward to March 2015 to take a look at the second half of figures included in <a href="/products/btpy99z3"><i>Iconic Heroes Set #3</i></a>. <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgn6">Last week's preview</a> revealed the first three iconic heroes in the set, Alhazra the oracle, Damiel the alchemist, and Alain the cavalier.</p> 
               <p>This week, we've got three more figures from the set.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Imrijka.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Imrijka_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Let's start off this week's preview with Imrijka, Half-Orc Inquisitor! Imrijka has proven to be one of the most popular iconic characters introduced in the <a href="/products/btpy8fo1"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>. Outside of the iconics from the <a href="/products/btpy88yj"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a> and the amazingly popular witch, I tend to notice community-produced images of Imrijka more than almost any of our other iconics. As a lot of these images are of a decidedly adult nature, I assume we somehow tapped into the world's need for a decent-looking orc. (How's <i>THAT</i> for a Halloween shudder?) Whatever the reason, she's here to stay, and her new miniature looks fantastic.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Balazar.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Balazar_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>And here's Balazar, Gnome Summoner. Balazar is a fun little guy who always has a trick up his sleeve. I wrote Balazar's <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfnj">Meet the Iconics backstory</a>, and I've had a soft spot for him ever since. Our design team is currently at work revising Balazar's class, the summoner, for spring's <a href="/products/btpy97vo"><i>Pathfinder Unchained</i></a> hardcover, so expect to see a bit more of him in the near future.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Padrig.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141031-Padrig_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Balazar is just a weird little gnome without his best buddy, the eidolon Padrig. Padrig can change his shape according to Balazar's will, and the two have been inseparable ever since they met many decades ago. As a representative of a creature type with no particular permanent shape, Padrig also works great for just about any weird monster you might want to throw at your players. Note the clear effect at his base. Cool!</p> 
               <p>All six figures in <a href="/products/btpy99z3"><i>Iconic Heroes Set #3</i></a> come with a unique card for use with the <a href="/pfacg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> that will be available ONLY in these special sets.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week. Enjoy the spooky holiday, and we'll see you back next week for a look at something REALLY SCARY!</p> 
               <p>Until then,</p>

In the near future subscribers to the Pathfinder Pawns line will find in their mailboxes not only a box, but a box inside a box—the <a href="/products/btpy99sc"><em>Inner Sea Pawn Box</em></a>!</p> 
               <p>This large pawn collection features over 200 unique figures and 439 total pawns, assembled from such seminal Pathfinder Campaign Setting sources as <a href="/products/btpy8ief"><em>The Inner Sea World Guide</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy94wj"><em>Inner Sea Gods</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy92lj"><em>Inner Sea NPC Codex</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy8thj"><em>Paths of Prestige</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy95b1"><em>Inner Sea Combat</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy8mfs"><em>Inner Sea Magic</em></a>. But even with so many incredibly illustrated sources to draw character images from, we still wanted more. So we ordered new pieces to fill in the gaps.</p> 
               <p>Among the pawns I'm most excited to get out into the wild are a priest and priestess of each of the setting's core twenty gods, and mounted versions of a Hellknight, a Knight of Ozem, iconic cavalier Alain, and a Sable Company marine.</p>

              <p class="date">by Dylan Birtolo</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Four: A Secret Exposed</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Everything was black. Awareness crept back into Marra, and with that awareness came pain. Even before she dared to open her eyes, she felt it in her ribs every time she sucked in air. It took her a few moments before she realized that she could in fact breathe, that the pain was not so unbearable that it would kill her. She eased her eyes open, trying to make sense of the hazy blobs of color around her. It was green and brown with flecks of blue. As her vision cleared, she realized she was looking up at the tree cover and the clear sky beyond.</p> 
               <p>Suppressing a groan, Marra turned her head to the side, trying to take in her surroundings. Her neck twinged at the motion and she winced to keep from crying out. A gasp escaped her lips, which only served to remind her of the pain in her ribs. She heard a voice as if from far away.</p> 
               <p>"She's alive. Bring the healer."</p> 
               <p>Marra wasn't able to keep track of what happened next. Everything was a blur of activity and noise around her. At one point she heard someone murmuring a prayer, but she couldn't make out any of the words. Two hands applied pressure to her ribs, making her hiss. Heat spread out from those hands, a warming and soothing radiance that nudged the pain away. After a few seconds, it no longer hurt to take a breath. Marra breathed in deeply, relishing in the simple fact that she could to do so. She opened her eyes just as the healer walked away to tend to others.</p> 
               <p>Once she was able to prop herself up and slide against a tree for support, Marra took stock of the situation. Their small band looked to be bruised and beaten, but relatively unscathed. One of the wagons had lost a wheel, and a few horses had been killed in the battle, but all of the knights and their retinue survived. A few were injured, but Marra seemed to have suffered the worst of the injuries. She saw her armor lying in the dirt beside her, the breastplate cracked from the impact of the blow. She still wore her chainmail, but her arm armor and pauldrons had been stripped from her and now rested in a careless heap.</p> 
               <p>As the group finished recovering from the attack, Adarrius walked over and stood at Marra's feet, looking down at her. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end and she wanted to squirm, but she managed to raise her chin to look him in the eyes. She needed to play the part and be strong.</p> 
               <p>"Sir?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"Where did you learn to fight?"</p> 
               <p>"From my father." </p> 
               <p>At least that statement was true. She hoped that it would match with her story. Did the knights of Lastwall have an academy? For once she wished she had paid more attention to international politics and other forms of government.</p> 
               <p>"Sir Tarl thought that was sufficient to have you knighted and serve under him?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
               <p>"He presented you with armor and sword based on your prowess with a blade and courage in battle?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
               <p>Where were these questions coming from? Marra pushed herself up off the ground and stood before her superior officer. Her ribs no longer hurt and she felt recovered from the injury—fit enough to charge into battle right then if need be.</p> 
               <p>"Then can you explain to me why you're wearing his armor?"</p> 
               <p>Adarrius kicked at the breastplate so that it rolled over. The only thing that seemed out of place was the crack, running across from the left side before it splintered into two branches, one going toward the head and the other dropping toward the waist. She didn't know what he meant to indicate, so she tried to keep calm and not respond to the accusation.</p> 
               <p>When she didn't speak, he continued. "I thought it was suspicious when you had the same etchings on your leather, but didn't think too much of it since you're from the same house. But now this. Did you know that Sir Tarl was gravely injured fighting orcs about a week ago, and it dented his armor in this exact same pattern? We repaired it of course, but the steel was weaker where it bent. Don't you find it suspicious that your armor just happened to break in the same way?"</p> 
               <p>The color left Marra's cheeks and she felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature in the air. It felt like winter had grasped her heart and spread snow through her veins. She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out.</p> 
               <p>"Enough. We'll deal with your treachery when we reach Tamran."</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-BanditLeader.jpg"><img src="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-BanditLeader_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> The leader of the outlaws fights with a skill beyond that of a simple bandit.
               </div> 
               <p>Adarrius grabbed her by the wrist and jerked her forward so hard she stumbled to keep from falling on her face. She didn't even bother to resist. What would be the point and what could she possibly say? This was the risk she had known she was taking and her ruse had been called out. Adarrius shoved her into the back of the rear wagon, then bound her wrists together and tied them to the bench. Her discarded armor and sword were put into the wagon across from her, laid down with much more care than she had been given.</p> 
               <p>With a lurch, the wagon started moving again. Marra's mind whirled as they journeyed along and the wagon lurched over every bump in the road. What could she do? Perhaps she could appeal to Palrion and see if he'd be willing to help her escape, but that seemed unlikely. Their alliance had been one of convenience. Now that she was a criminal destined for the gallows, why should he side with her? It would be simple enough for him to distance himself and she wasn't about to try to threaten him. Besides, who would believe a criminal over a trusted squire?</p> 
               <p>Marra lost track of time as they journeyed along. Every creak of the wagon or clop of the horse sounded like one step closer to her death. So it was that when the wagon pulled to a sudden stop, it barely registered. It took the shouts and wordless screams of an enraged charge to pull her back to the present and jerk her head up.</p> 
               <p>A whistling sound filled the air followed by several arrows striking into wood, tearing through fabric, and slamming into bodies both horse and human. She heard Adarrius trying to shout commands over the chaos, but the general noise of pitched battle overpowered everything else. Marra stood up and twisted around to peer through one of the tears in the wagon covering.</p> 
               <p>Molthuni! It was the Molthuni masquerading as bandits! They probably thought a caravan this protected would be carrying something worthwhile. Rage filled Marra as she recognized one of the same men who rode into her village months ago. She jerked at the rope holding her wrists, but it was bound too tight and bit into her skin. She jerked again, planting her foot against the bench and trying to pull free with sheer force. The bonds continued to hold.</p> 
               <p>Movement at the back of the wagon caught her eye. Several of the squires rounded the corner and ducked down near the opening, using the wagon as cover. She recognized Palrion in the group and caught his attention.</p> 
               <p>"Palrion, cut me free. I have to fight the Molthuni!"</p> 
               <p>"Don't do it! She's an imposter!"</p> 
               <p>"She wants to run off with the bandits."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe she's a bandit! A spy!"</p> 
               <p>Marra ignored the comments of the other squires and kept her gaze locked on Palrion's, imploring him with every fiber of her being to trust her in this. She needed to help. The Molthuni could not be allowed to escape. He had to believe her.</p> 
               <p>With a sigh, Palrion shoved the other squires away long enough to draw the knife from his belt and slide it between her wrists. The rope snapped as soon as he was halfway through the first strand. She thanked him with a nod, grabbing the sword from the wagon bed and jumping out the back over the stunned squires. As soon as her feet hit the ground she turned to her left, looking at the battle in front of her.</p> 
               <p>It was pitched and the knights appeared to be losing. They were well trained and better armored, but the Molthuni had the advantage of numbers and were fighting in formations that showed they were far from simple bandits. So far, no one had noticed her at the back of the wagon.</p> 
               <p>As she was debating the best course of action, Marra caught another flash of the man who had attacked her village. He was at the rear of one of the formations, his back facing her. She only caught a glimpse of his face in profile, but it was a face burned into memory. Marra charged, gripping the blade in both hands.</p> 
               <p>When she was a few strides away, she let loose a battle cry and raised the sword high over her shoulder. The man turned around just in time to see the blade drop in a deadly arc before it cut through the side of his neck. He collapsed, surprise still on his face.</p> 
               <p>The man's death caused the two warriors in front of him to turn, opening them up to attacks from the knights they were facing. They didn't last long against the combined force of the knights' assault and Marra's fury. Soon she found herself standing next to the knights in the middle of three corpses.</p> 
               <p>But there was no time for questions or commendations. Marra turned away from the knights to face her next opponent. A Molthuni woman chopped at her with an axe, aiming for her skull. Marra sidestepped out of harm's way. Before the Molthuni could lift her weapon, Marra grabbed the woman's arm. Marra used the momentum of her spin to drive the pommel of her sword into the woman's mouth. The force of the blow lifted the Molthuni off the ground. She fell hard on her back, and lay still. Marra moved on without giving her victim a second glance.</p> 
               <p>Just under the tree line, past the fighting, Marra saw a man dressed in leather and thick animal hides watching the battle. His hand rested on the handle of a large axe with the tip embedded in the dirt next to him. He watched the scene unfolding before him with a critical eye. As his gaze swept around to Marra, his lip curled in a snarl and he barked out a command that she couldn't hear. Several of the Molthuni in the back responded by turning from their adversaries and circling around to face her.</p> 
               <p>Three of them advanced on her, and Marra hesitated, the odds bringing a bit of reason back to her senses. She stumbled aside as someone shoved her out of the way. It was Adarrius. She didn't realize he was one of the knights she had helped.</p> 
               <p>"Get to the leader! We'll handle these bandits."</p> 
               <p>Marra rushed forward, dodging around the Molthuni. They tried to intercept her, but Adarrius and his companion fell on them and forced them to engage. Marra found herself alone, cut off from her allies as she charged toward the Molthuni commander. He widened his stance and hefted the axe into both hands, setting himself for her charge.</p> 
               <p>As she got within range, he stepped forward, sweeping the axe before him in a large arc. Marra stepped back, managing to get out of the way before the axe head cut into her midsection. There was no way her chainmail would protect her from such a blow. She tried to advance behind the back of the axe when the leader was exposed, but he swung the weapon around his head and brought it down almost on top of her before she managed to attack him. She sprang to the side, lifting her sword above her in both hands to try to ward the blow to her right.</p> 
               <p>The axe struck the sword with a clash she felt in her arms even more than heard. It took all her strength not to let go of the weapon as it vibrated. The axe struck the ground with a shower of dirt. With a grunt, the leader flexed his shoulder and tore the axe free, swinging it up at Marra's face. She threw her shoulders back, toppling to the ground as the weapon cut through the air inches from her cheek. </p> 
               <p>The leader wasted no time, stepping forward as he tried to stomp on Marra's sword arm. She rolled away, flicking the blade up and slicing it across his thigh. She felt the weapon cut through his leggings and was rewarded with a howl as he staggered forward, giving her time to rise to her feet.</p> 
               <p>When she turned to face him, he was already sweeping the axe down at her shoulder. She ducked under it, instinct forcing her to bring up the sword to deflect the axe even a slight degree. This time when the weapons struck, there was a high-pitched snap and the tip of her sword flew through the air. She glanced at the piece left in her hand, shocked that the steel betrayed her. The leader pressed his advantage, driving the butt of his weapon into her midsection.</p> 
               <p>She bent over from the force of the blow and reached out to steady herself, her hand falling on his shoulder. He snarled and shrugged her off. He slammed the butt into her gut again, this time with more force. Marra brought her right hand up, driving the broken sword deep into his side, sliding it through the armor and between his ribs. His eyes went wide and he looked down at her as the axe fell from his fingers. He pushed her away, and she stumbled back, letting go of the hilt. The Molthuni leader looked at the weapon in his side, clutched it with both hands, and then collapsed to the ground.</p> 
               <p>For several seconds, Marra stood over the body, her lungs heaving for air. Exhausted, she collapsed to her knees, the thrill of battle unable to carry her any further. She heard the fighting die down behind her, but didn't have the energy to see which side had been victorious. Slow footsteps came up behind her and a light hand rested on her shoulder. Twisting back, she saw Adarrius.</p> 
               <p>"Well done. You fought with valor and honor. I don't know if we would have survived without your aid. But there is still the matter of impersonating a knight. That is a crime that I'm not able to pardon."</p> 
               <p>Marra nodded, unable to speak. She was not ready to be bound again in the wagon, but had no energy to resist. She felt the pressure of his sword resting against her shoulder. It was an odd sensation. The blade rested close enough to her bare neck that she could feel both the cold of the steel and the heat of the fresh blood. Her skin prickled.</p> 
               <p>"Rise, Dame Marra."</p> 
               <p>There were no words to express what she was feeling. She tried to think of something to say, but nothing seemed good enough. Instead, she chose to rise to her feet, her face reddening when she realized her knees were shaking. Adarrius reached out a hand to help steady her.</p> 
               <p>"Now, let us see to our wounded and then you can tell me what would inspire someone to take the risk of impersonating a knight."</p>

               <p>Welcome to the playtest of <a href="/products/btpy9a0h"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>, a book filled with mysteries and secrets due out in summer 2015. This hardcover Pathfinder RPG rulebook will contain a mountain of new material for your game, from mysterious orders to strange powers, not to mention new archetypes, feats, spells, and magic items. As with our previous playtests, we want to make sure this book is the best it can be, and that's where you come in. <em>Occult Adventures</em> includes 6 new base classes to add to your game, each one focusing on one aspect of psychic magic. Similar in some ways to arcane and divine magic, psychic magic ventures into new territory, utilizing the power of the mind, body, and soul. Each of the classes in this playtest uses psychic magic in different ways, from the raw power of the kineticist to the subtle manipulations of the mesmerist.</p> 
               <p>You can download the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest"><em>Occult Adventures Playtest</em></a> document now! The PDF contains a brief discussion on the nature of the occult in Pathfinder, all 6 of the new classes, and a selection of psychic spells. Give these classes a read, build a character, and most importantly, use them in your games. Once you've had a chance to give them a try, go to our messageboards and post up your thoughts and feedback. We are eager to hear what you think works with these new rules and what still needs work. This playtest will remain open until <b>November 25th</b> (although we will keep it open for an additional round of playtesting if feedback warrants any significant revisions).</p> 
               <p>In addition, starting next week, there will be a survey for each one of the classes, allowing us to gain some basic insight on your opinions about these classes. These will be available on Tuesday, <b>November 4th</b>, and remain open until the end of the playtest. Please share your input before then!</p> 
               <p>You can even play these classes in <a href="/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society</a>. For this playtest, we have added <a href="/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest">a special boon</a> for those who make a character and play them during the playtest. We're excited to see how these classes work in PFS!</p> 
               <p>Finally, I want to take a moment to talk about the playtest process itself. Although we find all feedback useful, thoughts and comments based on actual play experience is by far the most valuable. Please try to fit these classes into your game, or even just run a few mock encounters. When posting to <a href="/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest">the playtest forums</a>, look for existing threads on your topic before starting a new one—this will help us to better absorb and respond to feedback. While discussions can become heated, remember that every game is different and every poster is trying to make the game better for everyone. Be polite and respectful of the ideas others' posts.</p> 
               <p>Well, that about wraps it up for now. <a href="/pathfinderRPG/occultAdventuresPlaytest">Grab the PDF</a> and uncover the occult secrets that lie within. We will be waiting for you on the boards, looking for your feedback and ideas. Thank you for participating and helping us playtest <em>Occult Adventures</em>.</p>

               <p>P.S.: Our regularly scheduled <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Adventure Card Game</a> blog will return next week!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">In the United States and many other countries throughout Europe and the Americas (and likely beyond), the transition between October and November is a time for Halloween, Dia de los Muertos, and other festivals that mix spiritual significance and macabre imagery. Having grown up loving Halloween—no surprise, I suppose, given my love of playing other characters in RPGs—I like to include a spooky scenario on the schedule in October whenever possible. This year, Tom Phillips returns with his third scenario: <a href="/products/btpy9986"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Hall of the Flesh Eaters</i></a>, a Tier 1-5 scenario that takes place on one of the Gloomspires, an array of ancient towers rising from the ocean west of the Eye of Abendego. This is a new feature of Tom's invention picked up from his <a href="/threads/rzs2noiz">2012 Top 8 RPG Superstar submission</a> (careful—there are some light spoilers in the link), and we at Paizo agreed it would be a great fit for Golarion. It's been fun giving Tom a lot of creative freedom to flesh out (har har) this location, and I know you're going to enjoy the creepy atmosphere and encounters.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">In the United States and many other countries throughout Europe and the Americas (and likely beyond), the transition between October and November is a time for Halloween, Dia de los Muertos, and other festivals that mix spiritual significance and macabre imagery.

It's been fun giving Tom a lot of creative freedom to flesh out (har har) this location, and I know you're going to enjoy the creepy atmosphere and encounters.</p> 
               <p>The other scenario for the month is <a href="/products/btpy9987"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-07: Valley of Veiled Flame</i></a> by returning author Nathan King. I really enjoy picking up old plot threads, and for years players and GMs alike have asked when they might see a use for one particular unique item that appeared on a Chronicle sheet many years ago. In this Tier 5-9 adventure, the PCs travel deep into the Zho mountains on the trail of a lost team of Pathfinders only to find an extraordinary treasure hidden among the peaks. I'd rather not spoil the plot for you, so I'll just leave you with this piece of art.</p> 
               <p>Also, you may have heard about the upcoming Occult Adventures hardcover book and seen <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgmt&amp;page=last?Signs-and-Portents">signs about an upcoming playtest</a>. In the past, <a href="/pathfinderSociety">the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign</a> has participated in the playtest phase of other hardcover books, and we intend to continue that tradition with Occult Adventures—with a bit of a twist: We will provide a Chronicle sheet available as a free download that incentivizes testing one of the new classes and providing feedback during the playtest window based on how many times you played.</p> 
               <p>Finally, I've begun experimenting with a new type of boon. I'll say no more on the subject, but I'm interested to hear what people think when they start seeing it on Chronicle sheets. When that time comes, I strongly encourage you to discuss it with spoiler tags or noting the spoiler nature in the thread's subject line, for I would appreciate players having a chance to discover it through play and come to their own conclusions first.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Hard to believe it's Friday already, and time for another look at upcoming <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures!</p> 
               <p>This week we're taking a peek at three figures from March's <a href="/products/btpy99z3"><i>Iconic Heroes Set #3</i></a>, a stand-alone release featuring six figures. Unlike many of our <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> releases, Iconic Heroes sets do not come randomly packed. The same six figures are in every box, with a visible window to let you see what you're buying.</p> 
               <p>WizKids has really outdone themselves with premium sculpting and paint masters for the Iconic Heroes sets. The new digital sculpting process allows us to nitpick all of the little details that make our iconic characters iconic, and WizKids is planning to make the Iconic Heroes as beautiful as any figure we've ever done for the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line so far.</p> 
               <p>Another difference is that each Iconic Heroes set will include six exclusive cards for the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, one for each character in the box. These cards can be used with any PACG campaign.</p> 
               <p>Let's take a look at some digital sculpts!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140923-Alahazra.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140923-Alahazra_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first this week is a familiar face, as we previewed her a couple of weeks ago in another blog. But in case you missed her, here's Alhazra, Human Oracle, from the <a href="/products/btpy8fo1"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>. The amount of detailing on Alhazra's stole will push the factory to the limit, but I'm confident the final figure will look absolutely amazing!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Damiel.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Damiel_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next up is the conniving Damiel, Elf Alchemist. We're excited about the level of detail that will go into Damiel's equipment, complete with clear potion bottles and a fully stocked alchemist kit/backpack. We see Damiel winding up to throw an alchemical bomb. Watch out!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Alain.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141024-Alain_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>My favorite for this week is Alain, Human Cavalier. His banner ripples in the wind at the end of his lance as his cloak billows behind him in dramatic fashion. Check out that banner and his tabard to see some of the coolest and most detailed tampo stamps we've ever done for Pathfinder Battles. Alain comes fully geared up and ready to kick ass, and I couldn't be happier with how he turned out.</p> 
               <p>We're only a couple of weeks from the November 19 release of the full <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> 45-figure blind-boxed set. Now is a good time to make sure that you've preordered or set up a <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Pathfinder Battles Ongoing Case Subscription</a> to make sure you don't miss a single figure. The Lost Coast is one of my favorite sets in a while, and its loose theme means it's packed with a ton of figures usable in just about any campaign. We've also introduced new subscriber benefits with this release (30% off Pathfinder Battles purchases across the board, 75% off the limited-edition case incentive figure) that you'll definitely want to check out.</p> 
               <p>See you next week for three more iconics!</p>

              <p class="date">by Dylan Birtolo</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Three: A Dangerous Path</h2> 
              <p itemprop="description">Marra sat back in the saddle and pulled on the reins, bringing her horse to a stop. She slid her hand forward to rest on the saddle in what she hoped looked like a natural movement. The truth was she wanted to get her hand closer to the sword.</p> 
              <p>She looked up and saw two men stepping out from under the tree line, both holding loaded crossbows. They were dressed in leather, distinguishable as high quality even from this distance, and each wore an emblem of the knights of Lastwall over the left breast. Marra swallowed, trying to slow her pounding heart and hoping her voice wouldn't tremor and give away her nervousness.</p> 
              <p>"Who are you and what's your business?"</p> 
              <p>Marra shifted in the saddle and saw both men tense at the motion. She didn't dare to lift her hand from the saddle for fear that it might start to shake.</p> 
              <p>"Marra Silvermoon, knight of Lastwall."</p> 
              <p>And that was it. The lie was told and she wouldn't be able to take it back. Her fingers dug into the front of her saddle as the words passed her lips and the silence afterward seemed to stretch on to eternity.</p> 
              <p>"And your business?"</p> 
              <p>"I was sent to catch up with the caravan and support them."</p> 
              <p>Another few seconds passed that felt like minutes to Marra. She heard her blood pounding in her ears and waited, reminding herself to breathe.</p> 
              <p>"Carry on." The man waved her forward.</p> 
              <p>The two scouts went back under the trees, disappearing as Marra watched. One moment, they were both there, and when she blinked, it was as if they had turned invisible. Not wanting to stay and push her luck, Marra nudged her horse and continued on the path. She resisted the urge to spur him to a gallop and tried to sit straight in the saddle while looking relaxed.</p> 
              <p>When she turned around a bend in the road, she let out a deep sigh and lifted her hand from the saddle. Wiping the sweat back from her brow, she reminded herself that she was committed to this course of action. The scouts knew her name—why hadn't she used a fake one?—and retreating now would be fatal. Of course, continuing on might prove fatal as well.</p> 
              <p>No, she couldn't think like that. She needed to be true to her convictions. The two scouts believed her without a second thought, so why wouldn't anyone else? Besides, it would get easier each time she had to tell the lie. Soon her heart would stop pounding. At least, she hoped so.</p> 
              <p>The sun was almost kissing the horizon when she saw the knights' encampment on the trail. Two wagons rested next to each other and took up most of the road. The knights had tethered their horses to the wagons and sat around a fire talking as they cooked some food. Their armor was piled up between the two wagons, away from the horses. From this distance, Marra couldn't make out the words, but she could smell the meat sizzling and cooking over the flames. Her stomach rumbled.</p> 
              <p>No one else stopped her as she made her way up to the camp, but all the knights stopped and looked up at her as she entered the circle of light thrown by their campfire. She didn't hesitate as she swung out of the saddle and walked her horse to an open spot against one of the wagons. She kept her back to the light, biting her lip and half-expecting someone to yell at her to stop. Before she even started tying the knot for her horse's lead, the voices started up again. She grinned. Apparently, it was as she had hoped—not all of the knights knew each other. She just might be able to pull this off.</p> 
              <p>As she went to go join the campfire and get some food, one of the young men came up to her. He wore a plain blue tunic with no markings or insignias. Marra noticed that almost half of the men and women around the fire were dressed like him. It occurred to her that this was the style of dress for the younger members of the group. </p> 
              <p>"This way. I'll help you shuck your armor."</p> 
              <div class="blurb180">
               <a href="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Palrion.jpg"><img src="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Palrion_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               <br> For Palrion, being a squire means having the courage to take risks.
              </div> 
              <p>Marra didn't know what to say so she followed the boy as he led her around the back of the wagon. He turned around and stood, waiting for her to step close. He gestured out with his arms and Marra did as instructed, giving him access to the straps underneath. As he took her out of his armor he whispered so that she had to strain to hear him over the noise of the others at the fire.</p> 
              <p>"I know my lord's armor and you're not my lord. Did you really think adding a few birds to the leather would fool someone? What happened to him?"</p> 
              <p>Marra felt herself break into a sweat and she resisted the urge to squirm or run. She would never be able to escape at this point. She settled for shifting her weight from one foot to the other. Her arms trembled a little as she held them out, but if it was from nervousness or fatigue, even she couldn't say.</p> 
              <p>"I found him in the woods, dead from a wound in his side. Looked like he'd gotten lost. I buried him."</p> 
              <p>"Why are you here? You wanna be a knight?"</p> 
              <p>Marra shook her head. "No, I needed a way to talk to the knights so that they'd listen to me. I'm from here. We need help against the Molthuni, but Lastwall won't listen. I thought maybe..."</p> 
              <p>The squire shushed her with a quick hiss. One of the knights walked past the back of the wagons, nodding to the two standing there as she went to the far side and disappeared from their view. Marra waited for the squire to speak.</p> 
              <p>"You know how rough it'll be for you if they find out."</p> 
              <p>Marra nodded.</p> 
              <p>"All right, then. Well, you're gonna help me, and I'm gonna help you, nice and easy. You need a squire. Every knight has a squire. And since I don't have a knight, it's back to scrubbing and horse duty for me. And if what you said is true, I won't have a knight when we get back.</p> 
              <p>"So you'll be my knight and I'll be your squire. You need me, or else they're gonna figure you out. And once we get back to Lastwall, before you go away, you'll tell the commander how helpful I was so I can get a new assignment. Do we have a deal?"</p> 
              <p>Marra nodded without thinking about the terms of this arrangement. She had not even been here for five minutes before someone had detected her ruse. Luckily, it was someone who offered to help, and she would need help if she was going to survive. </p> 
              <p>"What's your name?"</p> 
              <p>"Marra Silvermoon."</p> 
              <p>"Right, Dame Marra. I'm Palrion, your new squire."</p> 
              <p>He finished taking off the breastplate and laid it in a pile with the rest of the armor. He gestured for her to bend over, so she did and he pulled off her suit of chainmail. When she stood back up, he reached out and grabbed both of her shoulders with his hands.</p> 
              <p>"Now listen to me, Dame Marra. You're a lesser knight serving under Sir Tarl. That was my knight, the one you found in the woods. That'll explain why you've got his symbols etched on your armor, but with your own personal touch. It'll also explain why I know you and can squire for you. Got it?"</p> 
              <p>She nodded, feeling an immediate sense of relief that eased the tension from her body. After making sure they had the story straight, the two of them walked back to join the campfire. Palrion walked behind her but stepped in front once they got to the circle of light. He waited for a lull in the conversation before speaking.</p> 
              <p>"This is Dame Marra, one of Sir Tarl's knights. I told you Sir Tarl didn't abandon us."</p> 
              <p>Marra nodded to the other men and women at the campfire and they returned the gesture. One of the other squires spat into the flames.</p> 
              <p>"Guess you got lucky, barely missing out on scrub duty."</p> 
              <p>Laughter infected the group and Marra took a seat next to one of the other knights. She took some food that was offered to her: a plate of meat still sizzling in its own juices and heavy with spice. As she dug into it she listened to the conversation, not wanting to miss any details.</p> 
              <p>"Why do we even need to be here? Can't the locals train themselves or something?"</p> 
              <p>"I heard we're here to fight orcs."</p> 
              <p>"No one said orcs. Bandits."</p> 
              <p>"We're not here to fight anyone. We're supposed to train some people in Tamran so they can train their people to defend themselves. Gesture of good faith and all."</p> 
              <p>So they weren't here to deal with the bandits. Marra's heart sank and she began to tune out the conversation. As she thought about it though, she realized that changed her plan very little. She still would need to convince the knights that the bandits were a threat, and they were Molthuni, not random vagrants. Once she did that, Lastwall would send support.</p> 
              <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
              <p>The next two days were slow and uneventful as the knights neared the southern tip of the Fangwood. Their commander, Sir Adarrius, had them turn east into the forest along a seldom-used trail. Marra knew of the trail, but she kept that information to herself. It would save them several days' travel so that they didn't need to go all the way around the forest, but it would also expose them to some of the dangers of the Fangwood.</p> 
              <p>As they journeyed on, the forest became eerily quiet. Birds no longer burst from the trees above them. Marra's skin crawled at the base of her neck and she strained to look around her, but she saw nothing besides the trees. The sound of their party moving through the forest blocked out any other noise she might have heard. She reached out and grabbed the sword, drumming her fingers along the hilt as she tried to discover what put her on edge. Palrion lifted an eyebrow when he saw the motion.</p> 
              <p>A horse screamed from the front of their party followed by a stream of curses from one of the knights. Marra drew her sword, lifting it high and trying to maneuver around the wagons to see what had happened. As she drew close to the edge of the path, one of the large green mounds of undergrowth surged to life, rising up and towering over her and her horse. The animal panicked and reared, dumping Marra out of the saddle.</p> 
              <p>She hit the ground and the sword bounced from her grip, coming to rest in the dirt just out of reach. The hulking mound took a step forward on rootlike legs, reaching out with a cluster of vines and batting the panicking horse to the side. Marra heard a crunch over the clamor of the ambush and her horse made no more noise.</p> 
              <p>Recovering from the fall, Marra scrambled over and curled her hands around the hilt of the blade. She staggered to her feet and held the sword out in front of her in both hands, pointed at the creature advancing toward her. It was even bigger than legends said it was. The mound raised one large arm high above a headlike mass of vegetation and brought it down, trying to squash her into the dirt.</p> 
              <p>Marra dove to the side to get out of the way, but the armor slowed her movements. The blow clipped her shoulder and slammed her into the ground. This time, she managed to hold on to her weapon, but all the breath was knocked out of her. She rolled over and hacked with the sword, trying to hit the creature's leg. The weapon bounced off of its thick skin. It brought its arm down in a second strike, slamming Marra in the center of the chest.</p> 
              <p>There was a brief flash as she felt like her chest exploded, and then forgiving darkness closed in around her.</p>

We're zipping through these adventures faster than a flying fish on uppers. As usual, I'll be sharing some of my favorite cards and giving you the inside scoop on one of our scenarios. But first, I must apologize. If I seem a little distracted to you, it's because I am. Somehow, a gigantic fly has gotten into my house and is buzzing around me. Every time I get focused, this fly dive bombs me and I flail around trying to bat it out of the air like some sort of drunk cat. And sometimes I drop my laptop. Le sigh. But this is what I go through to get you some insider info on Skull &amp; Shackles. You may be thinking that it would just be better for me to head to a coffee shop down the street but that would be LETTING THAT BUZZY LITTLE JERK WIN. And that, I simply can't stand.</p>

But, seeing as how he's a reptile, he's a little sensitive to the cold, and adding that trait to your check will help you a bit. Unless somebody gets him some mittens and a hat. He'd look pretty great with those though, right?</p>

              <p>This scenario also features a new type of card. We call it a Curse but you'll likely give it a different name. Probably a curse word. Aahahaha. But seriously.

              <p>Up until now, Structural damage has sort of been a thing but it's been pretty manageable, right? The days of manageable Structural damage are over. This adventure has a lot of particularly nasty barriers that are all about the Structural damage. Take for instance, the Cannonade.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

               <br> <i>KABOOM!</i>
              </div> 
              <p>Yes, dear readers, you read that correctly. The Cannonade is a Veteran barrier and you're not getting away without taking at least 2 Structural damage. That's not all, though! There are several more barriers just as nasty as this one. And a couple are even henchmen so you know you'll get to see them a bunch! Huzzah!</p> 
              <p>I admit, rubbing your face in those barriers was a little mean. So, here. Take a look at this loot blessing.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>There's something funny about those traits... what is it though? Oh right, it's our first blessing without the Divine trait. That's pretty crazy! And you might be able to play a second blessing on the check you use this on! And just look at all those ways to recharge this thing! This blessing should rock your socks. And if you're not wearing socks, put some on so you can have your socks rocked. For reals.</p> 
              <h2>Bizarre Love Triangle</h2> 
              <p>It's a story as old as time. Boy goes to grocery store. Girl goes to grocery store. They do their shopping, almost bumping into each other multiple times, but always just missing until they both reach for the same sea cucumber. Meet cute. Boy and Girl fall in love. Boy and Girl get in a fight. Boy and Girl take a break. Boy meets Gal. Boy and Girl upgrade break to break up. Boy gets house. Boy and Gal are happy. Boy ditches Gal to pursue other interests. Girl hates Boy. Gal loves Boy. Boy is busy pursuing other interests.</p> 
              <p>I know, I know. Right now you're thinking, "You silly goose in the rigging, that doesn't really seem bizarre at all." You know what? You're right. Aside from the fact that Boy, Girl, and Gal are all water nagas and "pursuing other interests" actually means "killing any people that cross his path," that story is not bizarre in any way. </p>

               <br> <i>Sorry, Shonda Rimes, this crazy drama is already taken.</i>
              </div> 
              <p>So. Let's get down to business. What actually happens in this scenario? Well, if you'll note on the scenario card, there aren't real henchmen in this scenario. We just have you shuffle some random monsters (even more chances for Stripeypants to be encountered!) so closing locations will be a bit more challenging than normal. Plus, you have to get these three crazy kids in the same place so they can sort out their issues. That's right, this scenario is an intervention.</p> 
              <p>I can hear you scoffing through the internet, "So what if we have to burn through all the cards in a location deck and there are three villains? We're rockstars at this game!" Scoff no more, dear readers. Did you catch the part on the scenario about how if the villain can't escape to an open location you shuffle it into a random location and open it? I mean, obviously there's a strategy on how to do that properly but that's up to you to figure out. There's also the part where if all three villains aren't in the same location deck, you haven't defeated the villain...no matter how good your roll was. Toodle-loo blessings deck! It was nice knowing you!</p> 
              <p>We’ve sort of been ignoring our three villains thus far and if there’s one thing I know about water nagas, it’s that they hate to be ignored. Let’s start with Boy, or as you will come to know him, Munarei. Munarei is probably smarter than you. He’s gonna deal you some Mental damage before you even act and after that you’ll have to try and outsmart him. I don’t know about you but I would rather punch Munarei rather than try to make an Intelligence or Knowledge 10 check. But wait, there’s more! If your check isn't at least a 7, the top card of your deck, you know, the one you’re just itching to draw, well, that gets buried. Oof. Maybe Girl and Gal will be nicer.</p> 
              <p>Girl, AKA Sarlis, is a little peeved with Munarei. The good news is, this means she’s sort of willing to accept your help to get back her lair. All it takes is a Charisma or Diplomacy 10 check! I mean, she’s still going to deal you some damage before you act (Force damage, to be accurate) and if you fail by 3 or more you’re going to be burying that tasty top card of your deck. Hell hath no fury like a water naga scorned.</p> 
              <p>And last, but not least, there’s Selissa, who we’ve called Gal up until now. She’s still completely enamored with Munarei for some reason. And you trying to fight her and herd her over to the same location as the others is only distracting her from mooning over Munarei. So yeah, she’s a little mad at you too. She’ll be slapping you with some Poison damage, and of course, the top card of your deck is still quite vulnerable. But, after a Wisdom or Survival 10 check, you’ll be sitting pretty (but not as pretty as Munarei!).</p> 
              <p>So, we've now given you a murdery, monster-filled soap opera to play through. At the end you'll get a card feat, though. And we all know how deliciousssss card featsss are. Umm, sorry. Been spending a little too much time trying to think like a water naga. At any rate, I think you've got a pretty decent look at what's heading your way in <a href="/products/btpy965x">Adventure 3</a> and I only dropped my laptop twice! As always, thanks for reading and here's hoping to a mutiny-free month for you! </p>

              <p itemprop="description">As I noted <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgk7">earlier this month</a>, about three weeks ago I began really diving into the <a href="/pathfindersociety/getinvolved">Open Call</a> submissions and getting back to authors with feedback about their work. I'm more than halfway through the pile now, and so far it's been really productive. It looks like we might see Open Call authors showing up on the front covers of scenarios in a matter of months! I gather many of you are working on submissions now, and I'd like to share a few recommendations and tips that have come up frequently.</p> 
              <p><b>Scope</b>: A Quest is a quick, self-contained adventure that is restricted to 2,000 words or less. Keep this in mind when outlining and writing a Quest, for it can be really tempting to try to squeeze a full scenario- or module-worth of ideas into this short format. The most successful Quests typically have a combat encounter and a brief non-combat encounter, and some are able to manage two combat encounters with style. I find that when a Quest tries to fit in three combats, it often comes at the expense of the background, area descriptions, or some other important section.</p> 
              <p>It's certainly nice to have a definitive end to a Quest, not a "to be continued." Sometimes longer adventures have that type of cliffhanger, but I'd rather your submission leave the players high-fiving and knowing they won rather than looking worried and feeling like they barely scratched the surface of the story.</p> 
              <p><b>Organization</b>: Be sure you're modeling the overall organization of your submission after other Paizo adventures. <a href="/products/btpy8ttq"><i>Ambush in Absalom</i></a> is an excellent reference for making sure you have all of the important pieces in the right place, including the Summary, Getting Started, and Conclusion sections. Where does the "Creatures" header appear in an encounter? What types of information appear in the "Development" section rather than in the room description? The more of this that an author can internalize and demonstrate, the easier it is to develop and use that person's work.</p> 
              <p><b>Subtiers</b>: Pathfinder Society scenarios use a system of tiers that enable play at two different level ranges (e.g. Subtiers 1-2 and 4-5). With the exception of several early scenarios, every such adventure's subtiers are three levels apart, so it's important that you design your encounters so that the difference in the two subtiers' challenge ratings is three as well. That means if the lower subtier is facing a CR 3 encounter, the higher subtier should be a CR 6 encounter (not a CR 5 or CR 7).</p> 
              <p>Remember the Players: Keep your audience and the game format in mind when creating your stories and encounters. A Pathfinder Quest should be approachable enough that a group of somewhat experienced players are likely to succeed, so I would avoid including really powerful combats that are likely to devastate the PCs in a round or two. This is especially true for Subtier 1-2, where it is possible to leverage the challenge rating system to make a very effective yet low-CR creature that deals an average of [an average PC's hit points] per swing. Table 1-1 on page 291 of the <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><i>Bestiary</i></a> is a great resource for judging whether your NPCs are a reasonable challenge. </p> 
              <p>On a related note, also remember that the players are agents in the story limited only by their creativity. Unlike in a video game that presents an uninterruptable cut scene, the PCs have the potential to interrupt monologues and intervene when the villain tries to do something dastardly. Writing cut scenes into an adventure rarely goes over well, and it shouldn't appear in your Quest.</p> 
              <p><b>Stylistic Notes and Trends</b>: Paizo's adventures tend to avoid future tense, passive voice, and second person references. Exceptions show up in dialogue and in a few other circumstances. If you find yourself using "you" or realize you've written "will" without referring to inheritance documentation or a type of saving throw, it's probably better for you to revise it.</p> 
              <p><b>Review Your Submission</b>: Remember that your submission is a reflection of your writing and adventure design abilities. Reading your work out loud or giving it to a friend to read can help pick out a lot of errors, making it easier to wow your reader with your creativity rather than distracting him with grammatical concerns.</p> 
              <p>Once again, I'm excited to see so many submissions, and I hope that the recommendations above can help many of you create even more engaging adventures. Keep them coming.</p>

             <h1 itemprop="headline">A Knightly Mission</h1> 
             <p class="date">by Dylan Birtolo</p> 
             <h2>Chapter Two: A Knight with a Cause</h2> 
             <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
              <p>"Let me see if I understand you right."</p> 
              <p itemprop="description">Marra paused the work she was doing: attaching a new leather strap to the inside of the pauldron that wasn't frayed and was small enough to fit her arm. She looked at Eron through strands of dark hair that had managed to work free from the leather thong she used to tie it back. Sweat coated her face from the effort of working on the armor, but even though her muscles ached for relief, she couldn't keep the grin from her face.</p> 
              <p>"You find a dead body in the woods," Eron went on, "and discover that it's a knight of Lastwall, probably a few hours from the main road. So rather than do the sensible thing and bring the body back, or even ignore it completely, you decide to bring the armor back and steal it for yourself? Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is?"</p> 
              <p>"I buried the body." It was true. Marra felt like it was the least she could do considering the situation. It may not have been the best of graves, but at least the body wouldn't be picked at by scavengers. It seemed a waste to bury the man's equipment with him. Especially since it could be put to much better use.</p> 
              <p>"Oh, because that makes it all right? As long as you buried the body and said a simple blessing over the gravesite, you can steal his weapons and armor? If anyone finds out, there'll be hell to pay."</p> 
              <p>"Well then, I guess we'll have to make sure no one finds out." </p> 
              <p>Marra flashed him a smile and then bent back to the work of attaching the strap. She had never designed or used armor before, but the process was simple when she had a model to go on. And the armor did mostly fit her. She just needed to replace a few straps and a few pieces where the armor had been torn. After that, it would be a simple matter to change some etchings on the leather to alter the look.</p> 
              <p>Once she was satisfied that the rivet was sufficiently flattened, she lifted up the pauldron and put it on her shoulder. Eron came over with a sigh and checked the strap for her while she held it in place. He knew the drill by now. He took the strap and marked where it touched the buckle. After he finished that, Marra took the pauldron off and punched holes in the strap for the buckle, adding a few to each side of the marking just in case.</p> 
              <p>"What are you hoping to do with this, anyway?"</p> 
              <p>"I'm going to use it to deal with the Molthuni bandits."</p> 
              <p>Eron's mouth hung open as he stood in silence. It was entertaining to see the shock on his face. Even after all the years growing up together, Marra never got sick of causing that look. He shook his head from side to side before he managed to form words again.</p> 
              <p>"You can't be serious. You're going to ride out and try to track them down? Do you know how crazy you sound right now?"</p> 
              <div class="blurb180">
               <a href="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-MarraTheKnight.jpg"><img src="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-MarraTheKnight_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               <br> Marra will do what it takes to help her people.
              </div> 
              <p>"You're the crazy one. I'm not stupid and I'm not going to try and chase down an entire bandit camp. That's even if they're here to begin with. They might be crossing over from Molthune every day and then running back home when they've finished harassing us."</p> 
              <p>"Then how is this going to help? It isn't like you'll be able to wear a suit of armor around town in case of another attack. Even if you could, too many people will ask questions."</p> 
              <p>Marra hesitated, trying to look like she was too focused on her work to respond immediately, even if it was just measuring and cutting a second strap for the other pauldron. The truth was that she didn't know how Eron would react to the details of her plan. She knew he would call her crazy again, and with good reason. Her idea might be more insane than attempting to find the bandits on her own. But, it was also something she knew she needed to try. If she was successful, she might just be able to convince Lastwall how much her people needed its support and military aid. It was a chance she had to take.</p> 
              <p>"Remember how I told you that the trail was covered with signs of a large group passing through? It looked like at least twenty horses, and a couple of wagons, too. The trail wasn't that old, so the knight had to have come from that party. Probably got injured, ran into the woods, and got lost. People get lost in Fangwood all the time. So there's probably a whole group of knights heading south. If I can join up with them, I can convince them that the Molthuni are to blame and it isn't just random bandits. And then once they know that, they'll have to report it back home, and Lastwall will have to support us."</p> 
              <p>"How are you going to get them to listen to you? You're just a tanner."</p> 
              <p>"Not if I come to them dressed as a knight of Lastwall."</p> 
              <p>Eron's eyes widened and he whipped his head around as if to make sure no one else was in the room. </p> 
              <p>"You can't be serious. Please tell me you aren't serious. You know what they'd do to you?"</p> 
              <p>Marra drew her lips into a tight line. Of course she knew the risk she was taking. But the potential reward of help from Lastwall more than outweighed the dangers of her plan.</p> 
              <p>"You know damn well that we can't survive if we have to keep dealing with the Molthuni raiding our homes. And who's to say how long until they decide to launch an all-out invasion and take our lands? If Lastwall won't help us, we're dead anyway."</p> 
              <p>"You're crazy. I can't help you with this. You're going to get killed and I won't be part of it. I can't have you riding off to your own funeral."</p> 
              <p>Eron pushed away from the table he was leaning against and walked to the door, shaking his head. He reached out and put his hand on the doorknob, but didn't turn it. Marra just watched him, confident that she knew the arguments running through his head. He had to know how important this was and that it might be their best chance to get Lastwall to do something other than make an empty statement of support. Eron's arm tensed, but the door didn't move. With a slight turn to his head he spoke over his shoulder.</p> 
              <p>"You're really going to do this, aren't you?"</p> 
              <p>Marra put down her tools and let the pauldron rest on her work bench. She crossed her arms in front of her but kept her voice gentle.</p> 
              <p>"I need to do this. I need to do something. I can't just sit here and pretend like nothing is wrong and keep burying myself in my work. And like you said, I can't just ride off and go fight the bandits. I'm not stupid. This seems like the best thing I can do to help. And if it means risking my life, I'm not doing any more than anyone else."</p> 
              <p>"I still say it's stupid and it's going to get you killed. But, I also know how stubborn you can be once you get an idea in your head. You'd make rocks back down."</p> 
              <p>Eron let his hand slide off the doorknob and turned back to face her. One side of his mouth turned up in a semblance of a grin. It was another look that Marra knew well. He would help her, even if he didn't agree with what she was doing. And she knew she could count on him to keep their secret from the rest of the village. The fewer who knew about her charade, the better.</p> 
              <p>It took them a few more hours of work, but by the time they were finished, Marra had a suit of armor that would fit her. Her first impression after putting it on was how heavy it felt and how much it slowed her movements. She didn't know if she would be able to wear it for an extended period, but she was committed to her course now. There was no turning back.</p> 
              <p>After wearing the suit for several minutes and seeing how it affected her movement, Marra took it off and packed it up in her saddlebags. When she brought it out to her horse, she discovered the armor was even harder to carry than it was to wear. She was only able to sling the cumbersome bag up behind her saddle with Eron's help. The sword was too large to fit in the bag, so Marra wrapped it in a cloak and attached it to the side of the saddle. Satisfied that her gear was properly stowed, she filled a smaller bag with some basic trail supplies that should last her for a few days.</p> 
              <p>Marra and Eron rode out of the village, following the trail that led to the main path skirting the Fangwood's western edge. Once they were out of sight, they pulled to a stop and dismounted. Eron helped her into her armor, attaching the pieces she couldn't reach. Again, once she was fully suited up, she moved around a bit, amazed at how much the metal and leather restricted her. She had expected that, but experiencing it was another matter.</p> 
              <p>"You sure you want to do this?"</p> 
              <p>Marra nodded, gripping her saddle as she put her foot in the stirrup. With a grunt and a heave, she pulled herself into the seat. The horse puffed as Marra dropped her heavier weight against his back. She untied the sword, fumbling with the weapon as she tried to slide it into her belt. When it rested there, it pressed up against the horse's back leg and he danced around, trying to move away from the pressure until she removed it.</p> 
              <p>"Try hanging it on your saddle. That's how I've seen other knights do it."</p> 
              <p>Marra took his advice, hanging the weapon off the front of her saddle on the left side. It was still within easy reach there, but didn't press up against the horse.</p> 
              <p>"Told you I need you."</p> 
              <p>"And I told you that I still think you're crazy for trying this. But please, come back to us. If you change your mind, no one needs to know."</p> 
              <p>"I'll be fine. I'll show them what's going on."</p> 
              <p>"And I'll watch the tannery while you're gone and tell anyone who asks that you took a trip to Tamran to work out some deal."</p> 
              <p>Marra gave him one final smile before turning to the south. She knew she could count on him. In fact, she didn't know what she would have been able to do without him. Especially considering how impossible it was to put the armor on by herself.</p> 
              <p>She squeezed her horse's sides and he jumped to a light canter. The sudden motion made her lurch before she could compensate for the additional weight. Even riding in armor was different. It took her several strides before she was able to find the rhythm. She was just glad that she hadn't fallen off in front of Eron. Otherwise, he might have physically dragged her back to the village and locked her in her own tannery.</p> 
              <p>Once she felt like she was able to ride without thinking about it too much, Marra tried to bring her attention to her surroundings. It was difficult, more than she realized. She wasn't prepared for how much noise the armor made when she rode. As she tried to listen for animals or other riders, all she could hear was the jingle of her chainmail. Between that and the pounding of her horse's hooves on the packed dirt, it was impossible to hear anything else. So she focused on keeping to the center of the path.</p> 
              <p>She brought her horse to a gentle trot and was just beginning to feel a little more comfortable riding in her new gear when a voice rang out from the woods.</p> 
              <p>"Halt or die!"</p>

Rather than create a Chronicle sheet for each new book, we introduced the "Pathfinder Tales, Volume IV Chronicle sheet," so named because it represented the fourth distinct set of four Pathfinder Tales novels. This means a player only needs to print the Chronicle sheet once to enjoy the benefits of reading four books. As has always been the case, a player must bring a printed or digital (legally obtained and including a watermark indicating such) book to a sanctioned Pathfinder Society event to unlock a novel's Chronicle sheet boon.</p> 
              <p>It's my pleasure to announce that "Pathfinder Tales, Volume V" is now available for download. This Chronicle sheet sanctions <a href="/products/btpy92f3">Stalking the Beast</a>, <a href="/products/btpy93qy">The Dagger of Trust</a>, <a href="/products/btpy94r1">Skinwalkers</a>, and, <a href="/products/btpy94r3">The Redemption Engine</a> for the organized play campaign. As was the case for Volume IV, this most recent installment also grants one of your characters a permanent boon if you have all four novels. You can download it from the <a href="/pathfindersociety/additionalResources">Additional Resources</a> page or any of the product pages.</p>

              <p>Of course, with <a href="/products/btpy99k6">Nightblade</a> just about to hit shelves, we're only a few months away from needing "Pathfinder Tales, Volume VI." Best get reading!</p> 
              <p>Last week we also released <a href="/pathfinderSociety/gmResources">the pregenerated characters</a> for all 10 of the new <a href="/products/btpy978v">Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</a> iconic characters. Having first debuted at Gen Con Indy 2014, these characters are now available for use by everyone in the organized play campaign.</p> 
              <p>As always, let us know what you think about this newer format for the Pathfinder Tales Chronicle sheets and the new two-sided versions of these latest pregenerated characters.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">I'm writing today's blog from Times Square in New York City, where I'm staying while taking in New York Comic Con. NYCC is one of my favorite events of the year. For starters, the convention is the second largest event of its kind, bringing in more than 100,000 fans from all over the world.

              <p>It's also among my favorites because it's the final convention of the year. For 2014 that makes it sixteen conventions or trade shows for me, and I have to admit I am exhausted. I always try to jam all of my business meetings into the first couple of days of the show, so I can enjoy wandering the floor as a fan myself. After focusing all of my convention attention on business from January until the end of October, it's important for me to spend a little while checking out all of the stuff that I geek out over. It's fun to get in touch with my own fannish soul, and at the very end of the convention season, just when I should be running out of gas, I find that New York Comic Con invigorates me, recharging my batteries for the year ahead.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-NYCC.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-NYCC_360.jpeg"></a>
               <br> 
               <p><i>NECA, the parent company of WizKids, have an awesome Pathfinder Battles display in their NYCC booth,<br>complete with some <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><i>Lost Coast</i></a> figures including the case incentive <a href="/products/btpy96k7">Shemhazian Demon</a>!</i></p>
              </div> 
              <p>Among the things that most tickle my nerdy fancy? Miniatures, of course! So let us turn our giggling, geeky hearts to three more paint masters for the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy98sw"><i>Iconic Heroes Set #1</i></a>!</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Seelah.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Seelah_360.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>Here we have Seelah, Human Paladin, our favorite champion of law and good. Seelah received one of the earliest representation of an iconic character in our regular <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line, appearing in the very first set, <a href="/products/btpy8mq6"><i>Heroes &amp; Monsters</i></a>. That figure was fine—even impressive—for that early stage in the product line, but I never felt that it quite lived up to the early high standards set by the <a href="/products/btpy8l52"><i>Beginner Box Heroes</i></a> set, which predated <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> itself by a few months. It also had a bit of a scaling issue relative to other human figures, and came across as a bit small, not quite the imposing, powerful warrior we were hoping for.</p> 
              <p>I'm pleased to report that this new version of Seelah more than fits the bill. This version is considerably different from her original presentation, most notably in that the paladin wears her helm in this incarnation. That helm plays an important part in <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la39">Seelah's origin story</a>, so we thought it fitting to send the warrior into battle in her full regalia.</p> 
              <p>The shield appears white for now, but will soon get a tampo stamp with a crisp image of the holy symbol of Iomedae, Seelah's honorable goddess.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Sajan.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Sajan_360.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>Sajan, Human Monk is another example, in my opinion, of improving a figure on the second attempt. The original <a href="/products/btpy92jw">Sajan figure</a> looked pretty cool and didn't have any major flaws like scaling issues, but this new pose is so much better it automatically gives the newer model the edge. I love his battle-ready pose, and even his expression impresses.</p> 
              <p>While quality control at the production facility—something both WizKids and Paizo have repeatedly stressed for the Iconic Heroes line—will tell the tale when the final paint is applied, the new digital sculpting process allows for much finer and more interesting facial details than practical sculpts. From Valeros's smirk to Seelah's combat expression to Sajan's glare, these guys have real expression in their faces. It feels like a step forward for the line.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Droogami.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Droogami_360.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>We last met Lini the druid's snow leopard, Droogami, in the <a href="/products/btpy909j"><i>Legends of Golarion</i></a> set, where it was called simply <a href="/products/btpy92je">Snow Leopard</a>. Since then, we've given Lini's feline friend a sweet set of armor. We've also given it a somewhat realistic face—a first for the many great cats produced so far in the line, most of which seemed to end up with slightly comedic faces, like scary animals mixed with breakfast cereal mascots. I think this is a step up.</p> 
              <p>So there you have it. Three new figures, three improvements on their original appearances. I call that a win, and look forward to showing off the next set!</p> 
              <p>But before we can do THAT, we've got one matter of outstanding business for November's <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set! I forgot to preview one last figure for the set. I'd held off because I didn't think the picture did the figure justice. Then I saw the replacement picture, which was blurry and even worse. Then I went back to the original picture.</p> 
              <p>Here she is:</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-ElfArcher.jpg"> <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-ElfArcher_360.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>This is the Elf Archer, who looks better in person than she does in our photo. She's based on one of my favorite pieces of art from the <a href="/products/btpy8v3a"><i>NPC Codex</i></a>. She's a nice addition to our fairly limited ranks of elves in <a href="/pathfinder/battles">Pathfinder Battles</a> so far. And if you're going to have an elf, it seems natural to make it an archer. The Elf Archer is a Medium, common figure.</p> 
              <p>And with that, I'm heading back to the convention! Enjoy your weekend, wherever you are, and we'll see you back here in a week for more exciting reveals!</p>

             <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
              <p itemprop="description">One book I've wanted to put out for as long as I've worked at Paizo has been a gazetteer of different ships one could find in the Inner Sea region. Because ships are mobile, a ship of any type can be found in just about any port, opening up nearly endless options for Game Masters.</p> 
              <p>When <a href="/products/btpy991v"><i>Ships of the Inner Sea</i></a> finally made it onto the production schedule instead of my wish list, I wanted to make sure that the book could serve GMs in a number of ways. The included ships, of which there are seven, range in challenge rating from foes appropriate for parties of levels ranging from 4 to 15, and are thus useful additions to all sorts of adventures. For those running the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a> or otherwise using the ship-to-ship combat system presented in the <a href="/products/btpy8rwc"><i>Skull &amp; Shackles Player's Guide</i></a>, each ship includes statistics compatible with the system, allowing all seven vessels to be potential prey for pirate PCs prowling the Fever Sea. Each ship is fully mapped (and gorgeously so, by Jared Blando) for tactical combat and can be used as a potential PC or enemy vessel. While the crew compliment of each vessel is enough to fill a book by itself, each ship's chapter includes full statistics for its captain, one prominent crewmember, and a generic sailor or passenger stat block.</p> 
              <p>To provide more useful and general tools for GMs running nautical campaigns, we also included a chapter on sailing the Inner Sea. This includes a glossary of nautical terms, definitions of several different ship classes, and details on the region's most traveled trade routes and the hazards that make them full of adventure potential.</p> 
              <p>Three of the authors who worked on the book live or have lived on functioning boats, including naval vessels. Their knowledge of nautical terms, ship layouts and life at sea really shows in their writing, and I was very lucky to be able to get them all together for the project. It's the same reason we had Sutter write about space aliens and Wes write about Infernal contracts; you're best at writing what you know.</p>

              <p>What I'm most excited about in this book, however, is the art. This is one beautiful book. It was really tough to pick a few pieces to show off and whet everyone's appetites, so I decided to share one piece per type: a half-page introduction, a ship portrait, and a full-body illustration. And another half-pager simply because, holy cow, is it amazing!</p>

             <p class="date">by Dylan Birtolo</p> 
             <h2>Chapter One: The Man in the Woods</h2> 
             <p itemprop="description">Marra crept forward, easing her weight from her heel onto the flat of her foot, making sure that no branches snapped underneath her weight and betrayed her presence. She held her bow at her side, an arrow nocked in place and locked under her forefinger. It was too early to bring the weapon to bear; the distance was too great. She needed to be closer to make an accurate shot. In front of her, an elk reached down to rip up some grass with his teeth, blissfully unaware of her presence. The animal snorted and jerked its head up.</p> 
             <p>Marra froze. If she stood still, he might not notice her. The elk looked around and sniffed at the air, its large nostrils flaring. Marra held her breath.</p> 
             <p>After a few seconds, the animal lowered its muzzle back to the ground and continued to graze. The tension in Marra's shoulders eased as she saw the elk go back to its routine. This was as close as she dared to get. Any closer and she would risk spooking the beast. It had been a long time since she had some fresh hide to tan and she couldn't afford to let this specimen get away. She was already deeper in the Fangwood than she had ever been, and these woods were far from safe, even before the bandits.</p> 
             <p>Marra pushed the thought from her mind. She didn't have time to worry about that now. She raised her bow and pointed the arrow at her target. In her mind's eye, she pictured the path the arrow would take and where it would sink deep into the elk's flesh. She breathed in deeply and eased the air out. Once she finished exhaling, she drew back to her cheek and loosed the arrow in one smooth motion.</p> 
             <p>The arrow whistled as it cut through the air and landed with a solid thunk deep in the elk's side just behind his left foreleg. The elk bolted, sprinting forward and crashing through the underbrush without even bothering to look for its attacker. Marra snatched another arrow from the quiver on her hip, but by the time the shaft was nocked, the elk was too deep in the brush for her to have a shot. She kept the arrow in place, but lowered the bow to her side as she walked forward.</p> 
             <p>Her steps were slow and measured as she followed the elk's obvious trail. There was no need to rush. The wound was deep and she was confident she had pierced the animal's lung. If so, the elk's run would be short and she'd soon be back on her way to her tannery. If not, there was no way she would catch a fleeing elk. Up ahead, the sounds of the animal's mad dash continued, spooking birds out of the trees with the sudden noise. </p> 
             <p>As she walked, Marra's thoughts fled back to the bandits. They'd been more active recently, even north of the Marideth River. She knew they were Molthuni. Everyone knew it was the Molthuni. But their strong and honorable allies to the north in Lastwall claimed that it was just a simple bandit problem internal to Nimrathas and did not require any intervention on their part. At least that was the story Marra heard the last time she had taken her leather to Tamran. The politics of the situation sickened her. She wished there was something that she could do to chase the Molthuni off, but she wasn't a politician or a noble, and there was little more a tanner could do than help to keep her own home and neighbors safe.</p> 
             <p>Marra grabbed a fallen piece of wood in her right hand and used it to hack at the branches around her as she walked. With each stroke she remembered the last time the bandits raided her village. She was working in the shop and heard the screams, rushing out still carrying her tongs and carving knife. Four men rode into the village with torches and swords, too well made to be the spoils of scavenging. They trampled anyone too slow to get out of their way. They didn't attempt to make demands; they attacked, threw their torches into whatever flammable roof or crop they could find, and fled. The villagers were lucky and managed to keep the fire from spreading and causing too much damage.</p> 
             <div class="blurb180">
              <a href="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Marra.jpg"><img src="http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Marra_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
              <br> At heart, Marra Silvermoon is no simple tanner.
             </div> 
             <p>Up ahead, a loud crash followed by silence signaled the fall of the elk and jerked Marra back to the present. She dropped her stick and picked up her pace. It wasn't long before she came upon the animal collapsed in the dirt. The beast's chest rose and fell as it struggled to breathe, legs twitching across the ground. The arrow had broken off, but Marra could see the wound, the small hole still pouring out blood that bubbled as the elk exhaled. Marra took her knife from her belt and ended the elk's suffering.</p> 
             <p>She unslung her pack and took out the leather and cord inside. With practiced motions, she created a simple travois and laid it next to the elk corpse. Putting her bow aside, she knelt down next to the corpse and began cleaning it, cutting off large strips of skin to treat back at her workshop and large strips of meat for food. She wrapped the meat inside the skin to protect it before she laid it on the sled in pieces. There was no way she could drag the entire corpse. A lot of it would go to waste, but she would take back as much as she could drag.</p> 
             <p>Cleaning the animal was difficult work and it wasn't long before sweat beaded on her brow. She reached up and brushed the back of one arm across it, careful to make sure none of the blood dripped into her eyes. As she lowered her arm, she heard a low rumbling growl off to her left. Marra flicked her eyes in that direction, not wanting to make any sudden motions.</p> 
             <p>Between a few of the trunks she saw a group of three wolves stalking forward, the one in front growling as it peeled back its lips. Marra glanced back at her bow, useless on the ground a few feet away. Her fingers flexed on her carving knife. It wasn't much, but it was all she had. The wolves took a few more steps and then froze, the one in front looking bigger as its fur stood up. Yet it did not advance, and the others didn't circle around.</p> 
             <p>Wolves were something she knew, having watched them and dealt with them all her life. Marra's legs tensed in anticipation as she slowed her breathing, paying attention to the sounds around her while she unfocused her eyes from the wolves in front of her. They were not the real threat. They were the distraction, there to keep her from running away.</p> 
             <p>A snap from behind burst her into motion. She pivoted on her right foot, moving out of the way and leading with her knife in a vicious spin. The wolf that charged her from behind tried to spring back when she moved, but it wasn't fast enough. Her blade cut deep into the animal's shoulder, tearing through the flesh and making it yelp as it retreated from her attack.</p> 
             <p>Now that she was moving, Marra looked around and saw five wolves surrounding her, including the one she had just injured. It was the largest and she guessed it would be the leader. Despite its injury, it stalked back and forth in front of her, just out of her reach. Every few steps it would lunge forward and snap, but spring back before she had a chance to attack. The other wolves moved around to circle her and the fresh elk carcass.</p> 
             <p>Marra knew she needed to end this quickly. There was no way she'd stand for long against a pack of wolves. Her only hope was to deal with the alpha and hope the others fled. She took a step back, then another, turning to make sure she never left her back to one wolf for too long. Every time she turned away, one of them would snap forward, never close enough to connect but getting closer and bolder with each lunge. Out of the corner of her eye, Marra saw her bow resting on the ground next to her foot. She dug her boot into the soft ground, getting it underneath the bow.</p> 
             <p>Marra spun again, this time turning to face the alpha. She threw her knife at the beast, but it jumped to the side before the weapon came close. She hadn't expected to hit. Even before the wolf's feet touched the ground again, she kicked the bow up, catching it in her left hand. She whipped an arrow out of her quiver and nocked it, pulling back and letting fly in the space of a breath. The arrow slammed into the wolf's chest and the beast let out a sound that was both a howl of pain and yip of surprise. Marra spun, getting a second arrow ready and launching it at one of the wolves behind her. The missile streaked past the wolf, but was close enough to graze its skin as it passed. Marra didn't wait to see animal's reaction, spinning with a third arrow ready to face the next closest attacker.</p> 
             <p>The wolves turned and fled as Marra loosed her third arrow, striking a wolf in the backside. It ran faster, trying to catch up to its pack mates. Marra watched them run, ready to attack again if they turned, but having no interest in pursuing them. She already had her prize and it was more meat and pelt than she could carry back.</p> 
             <p>Once the wolves were gone, Marra reclaimed her dagger and rushed to finish the job of collecting as much as she could drag. She kept her bow close to her body and tried to stay alert to the forest around her. It wasn't long before she had the travois loaded as much as she dared. She cleaned off her blade before tucking it back into her belt and used the dirt and fallen leaves to clean her hands as best she could. Satisfied with her prize, Marra grunted as she picked up the front end of the travois and started the long trek back home.</p> 
             <p>It was slow going, bringing the meat and hide back through the woods. Marra took a different path, one that would bring her straight back rather than following the game trails like she did on her way in. Her path was not subtle or quiet, but she wasn't concerned about other predators. Most of them resided deeper in the woods and each step brought her close to safe territory.</p> 
             <p>So it shocked her into stillness when she heard a loud crash in front of her. Marra rushed to unhitch herself from the travois, trying to make sure she could fight or flee depending on the situation. She had just gotten out of the harness when a group of three elk cut across her path and then bounded away. That didn't make sense. They would have been able to smell the elk carcass and would never have run toward her, unless something scared them enough to override their innate precautions. Marra crept forward, curious to know what could have spooked them.</p> 
             <p>As she peered around a tree, she saw what had made the animals panic. A man in armor rested against the trunk of a tree, sprawled out as if he had fallen there. His chainmail shirt was torn in a few pieces, but the solid breastplate was still intact. He had engraved leather pauldrons and leather armor on his arms as well. A sword lay in the dirt near him, just a few inches from his hand. He did not appear to be breathing.</p> 
             <p>Marra walked up to him, looking around for any signs of what might have killed him, but the only thing she saw was the trail he carved getting to this place before collapsing. When she got next to his body, she reached down and held her hand in front of his face. He wasn't breathing.</p> 
             <p>When she rolled the man onto his back, she saw why—he had a large hole in his chainmail on his side just below his breastplate. The wound smelled of rotted flesh and Marra had to hold her breath to calm her churning stomach.</p> 
             <p>For several moments she knelt there, looking over the corpse. When her gaze fell upon his belt buckle, she gasped in surprise. It was engraved with the symbol of the knights of Lastwall.</p>

             <p>Forumite <a href="/people/zerothHour">zeroth_hour</a> and I sat down to play the first Card Guild scenario, Ghosts of the Deep. He brought a well-built Agna, and I, being an idiot, decided that the Mental-focused sorcerer Qualzar would be an excellent choice for a scenario full of undead.</p> 
             <p>Despite my opting us into hardcore mode, zeroth_hour defeated our former captain Arron Ivy a full turn before Qualzar would've bitten the dust. Victory!</p> 
             <p>Mike's Zarlova and <del>Gary</del>Gaby's Lem also survived despite Mike's legendary die-rolling prowess. Chad's table of new players, who opted to try the organized play scenario because they are awesome, convinced the fine folks at Uncle's to stay open a bit later so they too could emerge triumphant.</p> 
             <p>I'd like to thank Morgan from Uncle's and Big Kyle and Tony from our incredible volunteer army for making this event happen. Share your Adventure Card Guild launch stories in the comments!</p>

          <p itemprop="description">With the recent release of <a href="/products/btpy98nh"><i>The Silverhex Chronicles</i></a>, I've been really excited about <a href="/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/quests">Quests</a>.

Several writers from the last batch of Quests came from the <a href="/pathfindersociety/getinvolved">Open Call</a>, and since I'm already excited about Quests, the last several days have been a great opportunity to read through more submissions. I've gone through a large swath of the Open Call's inbox, reviewed those submissions, and nearly finished sending out responses—including feedback—to those authors. I'll be reading through more in the coming weeks.</p>

             <p itemprop="description">With the recent release of <a href="/products/btpy98nh"><i>The Silverhex Chronicles</i></a>, I've been really excited about <a href="/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/quests">Quests</a>.

             <p>As noted back when the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldp6">"Write for Pathfinder Society"</a> adventure pitch turned into the Open Call, reviewing a Quest gives the developer a much better sense of how a prospective author can assemble encounters, execute stories, and wield the English language. As the medium for publishing these adventures has transitioned from individual entries in independent publications to larger compilations roughly the size of a full scenario, it's a little trickier to pick up and publish a submission, yet I've already seen a few that might find their way into a future product.</p> 
             <p>Even if your first submission didn't meet Paizo's standards, learn from the feedback, practice those skills, and try again. My best authors are the ones who have handled criticism well and incorporated it into the next project. If you haven't submitted an adventure to the Open Call yet, what are you waiting for? This could be your first step toward writing for Paizo!</p>

            <h1 itemprop="headline">Friday Publisher Preview: Iconic Heroes Paint Masters</h1> 
            <p class="date">Friday, October 3, 2014</p> 
            <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
             <p itemprop="description">I've already spoken at length about our plans for the monthly series of Iconic Heroes Boxed Sets that begin in January. I've mentioned that WizKids intends to produce these figures at the highest possible standards, with premium sculpts and paint jobs.</p> 
             <p>I've even shown digital sculpts of some of the new figures. I've mentioned how digital sculpts give us as Paizo a lot more opportunity to ensure that details are exactly right (we just sent 17 sculpt comments for a single figure yesterday). But until now, all you've had beyond digital renders is my word that they're going to be awesome.</p> 
             <p>That changes today, as I reveal the paint masters for three figures from <a href="/products/btpy98sw"><i>Iconic Heroes</i> Set #1</a>, the very first set that will hit in January 2015. WizKids factory painters will do everything they can to replicate these paint jobs exactly, so these figures should be an excellent preview of what you can expect from the final production run.</p> 
             <p>They are, however, missing some finishing details. Super-detailed work like complex patterns on clothing and pupils are applied via a stamping process called a tampo during the production run, so these elements often do not appear on paint masters. Try to imagine Seoni's tattoos and some of the dress detail work and you'll have a better idea of how the final figures will look.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Valeros.jpg"><img src="http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Valeros_360.jpeg"></a>
             </div> 
             <p>Here we have the Valeros, Human Fighter like you've never seen him before. I think the face says everything you need to know about the power of digital sculpting over traditional practical methods, and the quality of all of his little pieces of adventuring gear really pushes it over the edge. Check out that tankard! Look at the bedroll on his back! I can't wait to get this figure for my own collection.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Lini.jpg"><img src="http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Lini_360.jpeg"></a>
             </div> 
             <p>Valeros has a gnome buddy, and her name is Lini, Gnome Druid. Frankly, I really like the original Lini figure from <a href="/products/btpy96kb"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>, but this one comes with a slightly more action-oriented pose and puts a little more focus on her sickle. We'll show off Lini's riding cat animal companion, Droogami, in next week's preview.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Seoni.jpg"><img src="http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141003-Seoni_360.jpeg"></a>
             </div> 
             <p>Seoni has always been one of our most popular iconic characters, and was one of the originals to appear on the covers of our <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>, the very first appearance of the Pathfinder brand. Along with Valeros and several others, she stars in the <a href="/pathfinder/comics">Pathfinder Comics</a> produced by Dynamite Entertainment, where she is coming into her own as the leader of the iconic adventurers. Like Lini, Seoni got a fantastic figure in an earlier set. The speed with which that figure sold out was one of the things that convinced us that we needed a better option for iconic character minis, and I think the pose on this new version is significantly more interesting than her original sculpt (which I also really liked). Of the six figures included in <a href="/products/btpy98sw"><i>Iconic Heroes</i> Set #1</a>, Seoni has by far the most tampos still to come, but I think she's off to a great start.</p> 
             <p><a href="/products/btpy98sw"><i>Iconic Heroes</i></a> also includes Sajan, Iconic Monk; Seelah, Iconic Paladin; and Droogami, Lini's snow leopard animal companion. Each of the sets also includes six unique <a href="/pacg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> cards specific to the included adventurers and animals. These cards are available exclusively in Pathfinder Battles Iconic Heroes sets, and are not part of existing Pathfinder Adventure Card Game subscriptions.</p> 
             <p>Swing by next week for a look at the paint masters of the other three figures in this set. In the meantime, check out the WizKids Pathfinder Battles items we've added to our annual <a href="/store/sale/theGreatGolemSale2014/miniatures/wizKidsNECA">Great Golem Sale</a>, including <a href="/products/btpy8v0a"><i>Shattered Star</i> boosters for $11.99</a>, <a href="/products/btpy8yj4">$10.00 off <i>White Dragon Evolution</i></a>, and more!</p>

            <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
             <p>Hello. My name is Mark, and I'm a recovering Paizo Blog addict.</p> 
             <p><span itemprop="description">When the Paizo Blog first started back in spring 2007, I was new to the Pathfinder fan community, and to be honest, Pathfinder wasn't even a thing. I rarely read it, because I wasn't quite sure what the people who made my favorite magazines thought they were doing making D&amp;D content that wasn't officially approved and licensed as canon and therefore allowable in my game (yeah, I was one of <i>those</i> gamers). I read the blog occasionally, but that was it.</span></p> 
             <p>Then I started working (rather obsessively, I might add) on <a href="http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Wiki" target="_blank">Pathfinder Wiki</a>, and suddenly the blog was really useful, super exciting, and checking it daily became a big priority. Big isn't even the right word. I used to check religiously every day at blog time for the latest update so that I could add any newly revealed hints or secrets to the wiki, whether that was a spoiler about the monsters that were going to appear in a new <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a> volume or an image of Aroden creating Absalom.</p> 
             <p>Now, it should be noted that at this time, blogs were scheduled to go live at midnight. I was then living in New York City, so that was 3 AM where I was. And like the dedicated fan-boy I was, I stayed up until 3 to be the first to comment on each one, then I'd go promptly to bed. When there wasn't a blog or it wasn't on time, I got upset that I'd waited all night and forgone sleep for nothing. So entitled was I that I created an alias called <a href="/people/BlogPolice">Blog Police</a> to remind the fine folks at Paizo that they'd "forgotten" a blog or neglected to include art in it that I could use under the <a href="/paizo/about/communityuse">Community Use Policy</a>.</p> 
             <p>Oh how things change!</p> 
             <p>All this is to say that today's blog is being written after it was supposed to go live at noon. I'm sorry if anyone in Sydney has been waiting for a 3 AM blog. Here it is! And it's got art! And it's a preview of an upcoming book, <a href="/products/btpy991p"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #87: The Choking Tower</i></a> by Ron Lundeen!

             <p>When I was ten years old, cat-sitting for a neighbor while they were out of town, I noticed some D&amp;D Monster Manuals on their shelf. I'd never played an RPG at that point, so the lists of stats and sizes and powers and hit points didn't mean anything to me, but the artwork seized my imagination and didn't let go. I still remember the drawings of beholders, umber hulks, green dragons, gelatinous cubes, mind flayers, rust monsters—and seeing them brought to life in ink lines and paint made my synapses sizzle. </p>
             <p>As I got older, I discovered that some of the best fantasy artwork was appearing in RPG manuals and source material, and on fantasy trading cards. When I became a professional author, I experienced the thrill of seeing my work brought to life by various artists time and time again—and it's a thrill that never gets old.</p>

             <p>But now, in addition to the pleasure of seeing a character I created depicted so vividly by Miguel Regodon Harkness and Tatiana Vetrova, I've got an extra special thrill, something that would have delighted my ten-year-old-self (and delights me equally all these years later): a character I created is going to be part of a *game*. My manipulative white witch cyborg Zernbeth is going to make life interesting and/or miserable for Pathfinder players lucky enough to pick up the Iron Gods Adventure Path. She's making the leap from my brain to your gaming tables.</p> 
             <p>Sometimes I really love my life.</p>
