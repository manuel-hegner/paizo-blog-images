  \ Society Organized Play is well underway, and Mike and I have received considerable\
  \ feedback both in person and through email about what works well (lots apparently)\
  \ and what could stand improvement. In just a moment I will provide a few updates,\
  \ clarifications, and reminders about the nuances, rules, and expectations of this\
  \ new season. For the moment, though, I would like to share a bit of our progress\
  \ on the online play frontier.</span></p> \n    <h2>Online Play</h2> \n    <p>Whether\
  \ it's by play-by-post or real-time, virtual tabletop, our online games are going\
  \ strong. Paizo recently added an <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/grandLodgeOnlinePlay\"\
  >online play subforum</a> to the Pathfinder Society page, and Mike recognized the\
  \ many requests for online leadership by appointing a <a href=\"/people/JosephCaubo\"\
  >Venture-Captain of Online Play, Joseph Caubo</a>—who has in turn appointed several\
  \ venture-lieutenants.</p> \n    <p>Several of my first Pathfinder Society scenarios\
  \ were played online, but it's been nearly three years since that last game. I know\
  \ I'm not the most knowledgeable about the nuances of online play and the needs\
  \ of the VTT-using community. As a result, Joe has been an invaluable contact and\
  \ liaison for understanding what the community needs, communicating how a new development\
  \ might adversely impact the online play experience, and providing—both by his own\
  \ hand and with the help of several others—helpful graphics that I use when making\
  \ proposals to other departments to make scenarios easier to use.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ are plenty such developments in the works, and I would like to highlight two:\
  \ map tags and paperwork. I remember playing <i>The Eternal Obelisk</i>, a now retired\
  \ Season 0 scenario, and the GM had to instruct us to ignore the big red square\
  \ with a capital T on the extracted map. No matter one's ability to avoid metagaming,\
  \ that's a hard piece of player knowledge to ignore. Our GM could not remove the\
  \ trap marker because the map tags were directly incorporated into the map and not\
  \ included as a separate layer. Savvy GMs can sometimes paint over these markers\
  \ or extract them in backdoor ways, but I'd rather we make that process easier by\
  \ layering things in the main product. Starting with <i>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #5–04: The Stolen Heir</i>, all scenario maps should benefit from this treatment.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Inventory Tracking Sheets</h2> \n    <p>Mike and I also hear many requests\
  \ for form-fillable documents, particularly Chronicle sheets and the Inventory Tracking\
  \ Sheet (ITS) included in the back of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Guide-to-Pathfinder-Society-Organized-Play\"\
  ><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i></a>. The ITS has been included\
  \ in a form-fillable format and has received three important clarifications:</p>\
  \ \n    <ul> \n     <li>Players may produce their own versions of the ITS to meet\
  \ their own design preferences and character inventory needs. Any alternate ITS\
  \ must contain the same types of information found on the official ITS (e.g. item,\
  \ cost, Chronicle acquired, Chronicle sold, charges, etc.)</li> \n     <li>Although\
  \ a player must record purchases on the ITS, a player need not also record an itemized\
  \ list of purchases on the Chronicle sheet. A simple note of \"Adventuring gear\
  \ purchased—see ITS\" or \"bucket of wands—see ITS\" will suffice.</li> \n     <li>A\
  \ player is not required to record individual purchases totaling 25 gp or less on\
  \ his or her ITS. This is largely to avoid having to fill an entire sheet with small,\
  \ mundane purchases like chalk or torches. We politely recommend that those purchasing\
  \ lots of an inexpensive item (e.g. 10 flasks of acid for 100 gp) still record that\
  \ on the ITS.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h2>Season 5 Reminders</h2> \n    <p>Remember\
  \ that the new scenario reporting sheet included in the back of Season 5 scenarios\
  \ has four checkboxes labeled A through D. In the Conclusion section of a scenario,\
  \ there will often be one or more checkbox conditions that help me to track players'\
  \ decisions throughout the season and use that information to help the campaign,\
  \ society, and factions to evolve over time. Not every scenario will have these\
  \ cues, but most will. For example, the scenario might prompt the GM to check A\
  \ if the PCs used the <i>scroll of awaken</i> on the giant frog, B if the PCs used\
  \ the <i>scroll of awaken</i> on the blueberry bush, C if the PCs successfully befriended\
  \ the resulting creature, and/or D if members of the Cheliax faction sealed a dark\
  \ bargain with the awakened blueberry bush to create a <i>pie of ineffable evil</i>.\
  \ As a developer I could then decide which creature to include in a future scenario\
  \ and whether said creature would start out as friendly or indifferent. Furthermore,\
  \ the fate of Cheliax might develop an appreciation for single-use, edible, evil\
  \ artifacts.</p> \n    <p>Finally, please point participants to the faction head\
  \ letters. These are clearly linked in a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf4z?The-Year-of-the-Demon-Begins\"\
  >recent blog</a> as well as in stickied posts in the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/factionTalk\"\
  >Faction Talk subform</a>. I've read many appeals for more clarity regarding which\
  \ scenarios deal directly with which faction, and I have a few respectable ideas\
  \ regarding how to publicize that scenario information without spoiling the somewhat\
  \ serendipitous sense of discovery for others.</p> \n    <p>Lots more in the works,</p>\
