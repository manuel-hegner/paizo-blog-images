  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, June 9, 2017</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a>,\
  \ every player character has a theme, which represents a focus for the character\
  \ beyond those determined by race, class, and skill and feat selections. In many\
  \ ways a theme is a description of the character's place in society based on what\
  \ interests them and what kinds of tasks they undertake. While a theme may represent\
  \ a job or role within a broader culture, it can also be a result of a character's\
  \ background, upbringing, training, or mystical destiny.</p> \n     <p>Each theme\
  \ has a set of benefits when first selected, including a +1 bonus to one specific\
  \ ability score and a skill-based benefit. Each theme grants additional special\
  \ benefits that reflect major aspects of that theme at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.\
  \ None of the abilities are limited to any specific character class, race, or type\
  \ of character. Conceptually, themes are designed to give the same kind of specialization\
  \ that traits and favored class bonuses do in Pathfinder, but are faster and easier\
  \ to select (no theme has any kind of prerequisite or limitation on who can take\
  \ it) and rather than many tiny character adjustments, each theme focuses on 4 noteworthy\
  \ adjustments over a character's career. Think of it as one extra dial you can turn\
  \ to customize your character, giving the same class and race a dramatically different\
  \ feel—a vesk soldier with the icon theme might be a celebrity gladiator, while\
  \ one with the priest theme might be a chaplain of Damoritosh the Conqueror.</p>\

  \ <p><i>Illustration by Pixoloid Studios</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>There are\
  \ nine themes in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, with a tenth option—\"themeless\"—for characters\
  \ with a specific concept that they don't feel is a good match for any of the currently\
  \ extant themes. The themes are intentionally kept fairly broad, with the names\
  \ functioning as descriptive titles rather than hard limitations on what kind of\
  \ character might take each theme. You can see a little of how themes can help you\
  \ hone in on a particular character concept in the character build examples presented\
  \ at the end of each class. Take the outlaw theme, for example: in just those few\
  \ class build examples, we show you how the same outlaw theme can make an envoy\
  \ into a fast-talking scoundrel, a mechanic into a saboteur, an operative into either\
  \ a hacker or a thief, a solarian into a disgraced outcast, a soldier into a freelance\
  \ sniper, and so on.</p> \n     <p>The nine themes (and the themeless option) are\
  \ described briefly below.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Ace Pilot</b>:\
  \ Thanks to steady hands and nerves of steel, you are skilled at operating starships\
  \ and other vehicles.</p> \n      <p><b>Bounty Hunter</b>: Almost nothing will stop\
  \ you from tracking down your quarries and returning them dead or alive.</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Icon</b>: You are a popular and respected celebrity within the bounds\
  \ of colonized space.</p> \n      <p><b>Mercenary</b>: You are a well-trained soldier\
  \ of fortune who works well with your companions in battle.</p> \n      <p><b>Outlaw</b>:\
  \ Whether you're guilty or not, somebody wants to see you behind bars—or worse.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Priest</b>: Your unshakable devotion to a philosophy or religion\
  \ forms the core of your personality.</p> \n      <p><b>Scholar</b>: As an academic,\
  \ you have a broad knowledge base and a thirst to expand it.</p> \n      <p><b>Spacefarer</b>:\
  \ You live your life among the stars, seeking new worlds to explore and yearning\
  \ for the next adventure.</p> \n      <p><b>Xenoseeker</b>: As you travel outside\
  \ of Pact Worlds space, you strive to make first contact with alien life forms.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Themeless</b>: You don't fit neatly into any of the above categories,\
  \ or you see yourself as a blank slate.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The abilities\
  \ gained by each theme at 1st, 6th, 12th, and 18th level are useful and appropriate\
  \ to the theme, but not so overpowering as to be a mandatory part of any effective\
  \ character build. Below are examples of a few theme abilities—the 1st level ability\
  \ gained by themeless characters (general knowledge), and the 6th level ability\
  \ gained by the xenoseeker (quick pidgin).</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>General\
  \ Knowledge (Themeless, 1st)</b>: You gain a class skill of your choice when you\
  \ create a themeless character. You also gain an ability adjustment of +1 to any\
  \ ability score you choose.</p> \n      <p><b>Quick Pidgin (Xenoseeker, 6th)</b>:\
  \ If you don't share a language with creatures you encounter, you and the creatures\
  \ can spend 10 minutes attempting to converse (if they are willing), after which\
  \ you attempt a DC 25 Culture check. If you succeed, you formulate a simple pidgin\
  \ language that allows basic communication. You can use the pidgin language with\
  \ those specific creatures only, but you gain a +2 bonus to Culture checks to create\
  \ a pidgin language with similar creatures that speak the same language.</p> \n\
