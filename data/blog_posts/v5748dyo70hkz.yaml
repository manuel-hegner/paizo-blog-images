  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The fifth time\
  \ he saw the same grey-furred ysoki hawking her basket of cosmic cratannes (laser-fried\
  \ dough, hot off the therm, dipped in some kind of sugared orange), Zemir had to\
  \ admit he was hopelessly lost. No matter the path he decided to walk, all roads\
  \ in the Spike seemed to bring him back here – the same makeshift food stand in\
  \ a nook off an alley, the same would-be chef touting freshness and flavor, the\
  \ same bits of dough stacked tight in a basket that smelled like his kind of delicious.\
  \ Maybe he’d buy some to bring back upside. Once he figured out where he was in\
  \ the station. In this version of it, anyway.</p>\n      <p>Most realities had their\
  \ own Absalom Station, and there had to be one he could draw on for help, ideally\
  \ where the resident Zemir had some sense of where he was going. Maybe one where\
  \ the Spike led back up to the Freemarkets, connected by a daisy chain of hatches,\
  \ vents, and ladders. Or one where part of the Spike was the hub of the station,\
  \ with signs and vendors everywhere, and if you paid attention you could find a\
  \ quick way through. He could almost see himself there – confident stride, cloak\
  \ trailing behind him, trading nods with passersby who respected his age-whitened\
  \ hair. All he had to do was glance a bit past the here and now, pull from something\
  \ beyond the world he currently stood in, and—</p>\n      <p><em>stomach lurching,\
  \ nerves on fire</em></p>\n      <p>A station just like this one, the hallways bitter\
  \ cold,</p>\n      <p>filled only with the echoed sound of dying</p>\n      <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">A station where the ground beneath his feet</p>\n      <p\
  \ style=\"text-align: center;\">was devoured by the emptiness of space.</p>\n  \
  \    <p style=\"margin-right: 30px; text-align: right;\">A station where a little\
  \ girl reached for a snack</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">before something\
  \ splintered and ripped her apart,</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">turning\
  \ everything to debris.</p>\n      <p>Zemir blinked the other realities away—once,\
  \ twice, three times—and did his best to ignore a tiny bit of moisture threatening\
  \ the corner of his eye. He couldn’t help that girl, he knew he couldn’t, no matter\
  \ how much he wanted to. He’d learned that lesson years ago, the night he lost his\
  \ team—his <em>friends—</em>to some trap of reality he would never reach again.\
  \ Maybe not so different than whatever stalked him now.</p>\n      <p>A feeling\
  \ of something wrong had been hanging in the air for weeks, sloshing deep inside\
  \ his guts, making his skin feel too tight<em>—</em> It was what had brought him\
  \ down here, walking through the maze that was underneath the station, hoping he\
  \ would figure out where it came from and why. But that flash of realities? That\
  \ spinning, dizzy whirl of worlds? That was something stronger than the creeping\
  \ sense of ill at ease. <em>That</em> sent a wave of sick and spin crashing into\
  \ his body that only his long years of discipline in times of chaos kept him from\
  \ spilling back out in bits of bile onto the metal ground.</p>\n      <p>Zemir tapped\
  \ at his chest, felt for his anchor. A small piece of obsidian, singed but unbroken.\
  \ All that remained from a former life. <em>Touch something real, </em>he thought\
  \ as it danced beneath his fingers. <em>Shake off the fear and steel yourself. You\
  \ know that you can do it.</em></p>\n      <p>It was time to go home.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Zemir bore right at the next set of hallways, ignoring the ones that slipped\
  \ out of his vision, filled with the voices from some other dimension, thick and\
  \ indistinct and always a touch out of tune. Left, then right, then right again,\
  \ feet firmly beneath him, until the last hallway ended in an unexpected alcove,\
  \ sparse but still in use, with a cot on the floor and a chair at the wall and clothes\
  \ hanging from a spigot. The light was dimmer here, somehow, and the air hung stale\
  \ and heavy, as if it had been folded up and shoved into a corner, waiting for someone\
  \ to stumble into its maw.</p>\n      <p><em>skin crawling, hard to breathe</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>The air thick with a poisonous haze</p>\n      <p>curled around a family’\
  s remains</p>\n      <p>their hands reaching for relief</p>\n      <p>that isn’\
  t going to come</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">The air bitter cold,\
  \ stealing the breath</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">from huddled bodies\
  \ grasping tight</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Leaving nothing but\
  \ frozen arms</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">And frost-drenched tear-stained\
  \ faces</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">The air, smells of burning</p>\n\
  \      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">and then, something else.</p>\n      <p style=\"\
  text-align: right;\">Something delicious.</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\"\
  >Something warm and hearty and fried.</p>\n      <p>“You really should have tried\
  \ the cratanne.”</p>\n      <p>The ysoki was there again, behind him. She smiled\
  \ wide as she offered the basket of fried dough. “They’re best when they’re fresh,\
  \ you know. Everyone says so. Might have kept you out of some trouble.” Her voice\
  \ sounded odd. Minor key, a touch out of tune.</p>\n      <p>Zemir grabbed for power\
  \ before thinking to do it, a gesture as natural as taking a breath, bringing his\
  \ quantum field to life with the ease of years of practice. Other Zemirs were with\
  \ him now, flickering in and out of the alcove, in and out of this reality. Some\
  \ close enough in look to be his twins, at least at a cursory flash of a glance;\
  \ others, dressed up like they owned the place, and still others looking bruised\
  \ and beaten by a life of struggle he’d never known. But they were all there, facing\
  \ down the ysoki chef who still stood in the doorway her teeth bared half between\
  \ snarl and smile.</p>\n      <p>“Who are you?” Zemir let the voices of all the\
  \ other Zemirs echo like thunder. No two of them sounded quite the same. Some voices\
  \ spoke sharp with harsh demands, some were soft and curious, but all were a little\
  \ out of tune and hollow as struck bells. Just the way the ysoki’s voice sounded.\
  \ He cleared his throat and began again. “Who are you and what are you doing here?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“The real question is, who are you?” asked the ysoki. “A guard patrolling?\
  \ A rival shopkeeper snooping?” She backed away as she spoke, trying to get past\
  \ the reach of his spells.</p>\n      <p>He did not understand, but Zemir knew that\
  \ he had to take some expanded precautions. Zemir let his quantum field slowly expand\
  \ as he spoke, putting the ysoki back in its reach. If she noticed, she didn’t let\
  \ on.</p>\n      <p>“You’ve been <em>following </em>me,” the ysoki said. “Every\
  \ time I pick some new alcove down here, try to sell my goods in peace, there you\
  \ are. I’m just trying to find a place to sell my cratannes. I don’t have anywhere\
  \ else to go. Please just leave me alone!”</p>\n      <p>The more the chef spoke,\
  \ the more Zemir was sure. She <em>was</em> from Absalom Station, not from this\
  \ reality. He’d heard of witchwarpers who fully displaced their bodies, or who anchored\
  \ themselves in someone else’s reality, but usually there was deep magic involved,\
  \ and it was always dangerous. Sometimes it wasn’t voluntary.</p>\n      <p>Zemir\
  \ kept his voice calm to mask himself reaching out for more power, casting <em>detect\
  \ magic </em>to see what it told him. He followed the potentials in his mind—<em>haste</em>\
  \ and <em>fly</em> would get him out of here if she was dangerous, or <em>lightning\
  \ bolt</em> if all else failed. But all he detected was a pulse of something warm\
  \ inside the basket filled with food that she still held. There was more in those\
  \ cosmic cratannes than fat and fry and flavor.</p>\n      <p>“I wasn’t following\
  \ you,” he said, though it didn’t seem to matter now. “I just kept running into\
  \ you. It felt like something drew me toward you. Perhaps those snacks you’re so\
  \ insistent I enjoy.” Zemir could feel his voice grow tense. He clenched fingers\
  \ to unleash a bolt in case she moved against him, but something flashed across\
  \ her face and before he could decide to cast, he saw her in some other place. Some\
  \ same but different version of this station.</p>\n      <p><em>swallowed laughter,\
  \ sudden pain</em></p>\n      <p>She is in a kitchen laughing</p>\n      <p>Smells\
  \ of food and talk of flavors</p>\n      <p>Promises and joking threats</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Recipes passed down</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">She is in\
  \ a closet hiding</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Lights are flashing,\
  \ klaxons blaring</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Smoke chokes out the\
  \ sound of screaming</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Hands that held\
  \ her, forced to stillness</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\">She is all\
  \ alone</p>\n      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">She is trapped but won’t go easy</p>\n\
  \      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Reaching out for some new power</p>\n   \
  \   <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Pulled to somewhere safe but different</p>\n\
  \      <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Recipe scrap in her pocket</p>\n      <p\
  \ style=\"text-align: right;\">Nothing left of home</p>\n      <p>Zemir inhaled\
  \ sharply as the images—her memories—left his mind, a truth within them that erased\
  \ whatever he was planning. The quantum field faded. The other Zemirs disappeared.\
  \ He wondered if one of them was from wherever she came from, and if that version\
  \ still survived.</p>\n      <p>“Why show me this?” he asked. “Why draw me to your\
  \ food stand?” Perhaps this was the only way she knew to ask for help.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>“I didn’t,” said the chef, in a small voice, clear but shaky. “I only tried\
  \ to put some of the place I’m from into my food. The orange sugar is confectionary\
  \ from my home. It’s just a bit of magic to connect you to the ones who you break\
  \ and share your bread with. I can’t go home now so… it’s the next best thing.”\
  </p>\n      <p>“And the visions? The smoke?” He had a feeling she had caused them.\
  \ She must have some kind of hidden talent. Some reason she’d survived.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>“I didn’t mean to. I just wanted to show you what happened. That’s it’s\
  \ all gone.” It wasn’t an apology. It wasn’t a challenge. It was the plain and simple\
  \ truth of things.</p>\n      <p>Zemir thought back to the feeling of loss, the\
  \ spinning lack of center, the sickness roiling around in his stomach for weeks.\
  \ Whatever she had done had hit him harder than intended, but something told him\
  \ he’d have to search somewhere else to find any way to help her. Or himself.</p>\n\
  \      <p>There were questions to be answered, but not in the here and now. He forced\
  \ his face into a smile, tried to inhale the scent of the treats that she was carrying.\
  \ They did still smell like his kind of delicious.</p>\n      <p>“I understand,”\
  \ he said. “About those cratannes… I can introduce you to some people who will buy\
  \ the whole lot off you right now if you come to breakfast. How do you feel about\
  \ coffee?”</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
