  \  <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n     <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here. I’\
  m excited to announce a new Kickstarter from Roll For Combat, which is live at <a\
  \ href=\"http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/\">http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com</a>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We’re working on a big setting book, <em>World of Battlezoo: Indigo\
  \ Isles</em>. We expect it to clock in at over 280 pages with eight lengthy and\
  \ expansive new ancestries, two extensive heritages for wildfire leshies and galtzagorri\
  \ sprites (all of which can be imported into Pathbuilder 2e), new familiars, pirate\
  \ archetype feats, and more. And, of course, the highlight of the book—extensive\
  \ information about an island chain called the Indigo Isles.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>While the Indigo Isles are easy to fit into your favorite\
  \ setting, including Golarion, with a few adjustments, it’s also a window into the\
  \ world of Alacar, a setting we’re excited to build and explore along with you…\
  \ and I do mean that part, literally. We want this to be a world where you can contribute\
  \ ideas and see them reflected in the setting, and to that end, every tier will\
  \ allow you to submit an idea for a small island, and we’ll choose the best of these,\
  \ which I’ll give a full write-up in the book! So, this is your chance to pitch\
  \ the island idea of your dreams and maybe see it in a published setting.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In addition to myself—and potentially you!—this book is packed with amazing\
  \ ideas from industry veterans and Paizo staffers past and present, including Paizo\
  \ Development Manager of Narrative <strong>Linda Zayas-Palmer</strong>, Paizo Starfinder\
  \ Society Developer <strong>Jessica Catalan</strong>, Paizo Adventure Path Developer\
  \ <strong>Vanessa Hoskins</strong>, former Paizo Development Manager of Adventure\
  \ Paths <strong>Ron Lundeen</strong>, former Paizo Senior Developer of Adventure\
  \ Paths <strong>Patrick Renie</strong>, Paizo freelancer and <em>Pathfinder </em><em>Dark\
  \ Archive</em> cover author <strong>Mikhail Rekun</strong>, Paizo freelancer and\
  \ <em>Queerfinder </em>mastermind <strong>Grady Wang</strong>, Level Up co-creator\
  \ <strong>Paul Hughes</strong>, as well as a few other surprise authors.</p> \n\

  \ and detailed town gazetteers for any setting or world!]</p> \n     </div> \n \
  \    <p>And if a book filled with dozens of story hooks and interesting NPCs that\
  \ can be easily inserted into any campaign, new faith systems, nearly a dozen detailed\
  \ town gazetteers, and maps of the islands and towns isn’t exciting enough for you…\
  \ did I mention the dragons? <strong>We have over 20 pages dedicated to 15 new dragons</strong>,\
  \ featuring the entire family of wild dragons from <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</em>.\
  \ These include the amber, cerulean, harlequin, indigo, and vermilion dragons as\
  \ young, adult, and ancient foes that you can now pit against your players, or just\
  \ use them as helpful NPCs as wild dragons love to party!</p> \n     <p>One of the\
  \ great things about this Kickstarter is that we have been working hard on this\
  \ book all year, and it’s nearly complete. Right after the Kickstarter ends, all\
  \ the PDFs and Foundry VTT modules will be released, and the print book will follow\
  \ shortly after! Of course, I’ll be working on those new islands and adding them\
  \ to the book, but we’ve planned on having all new islands complete and ready to\
  \ go during the time Kickstarter takes to finish up the various paperwork (around\
  \ two weeks). </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rollforcombat/world-of-battlezoo-indigo-isles-for-pathfinder-2e-and-5e\"\
