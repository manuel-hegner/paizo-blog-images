  \ post, including previewed cards, features substantial spoilers of the plot and\
  \ events in the second installment of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</em></a>. Please tread carefully if you\
  \ plan to play through the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG version of the story</a>, or if you like to be surprised by events\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>When we left our intrepid heroes, they had just fled a collapsing city\
  \ (and the Storm King), fought through the underground, and reclaimed their city\
  \ from hordes of undead. Now all they have to do is travel through the heart of\
  \ the Worldwound and conquer another city filled with demons in <a href=\"/products/btpy9b9r\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck 2: Sword of Valor</em></a>. Piece of\
  \ cake!</p> \n    <p>Your adventure begins with the scenario \"The Gibbering Swarm.\"\
  \ If you're anything like me, you're always having trouble finding the monsters\
  \ in a location deck. You keep running into the constant frustration of finding\
  \ allies and weapons. Well, this scenario takes that frustration away! For each\
  \ of the locations you'll face here, take all of the monsters and put them right\
  \ on top of the deck. You'll never have to search for them again!</p> \n    <div\

  \ are aided by the annoying little Vescavor Swarms we last saw in Elven Entanglement.\
  \ I'm sure you remember them. (You certainly would if you had to banish your weapon\
  \ when fighting them before.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Game over, man! Game over!</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>And of\
  \ course, we have their queen. You do not want to get close to her! At least, not\
  \ if you only want to have to beat a 20 on your combat check. But if you're happy\
  \ to add another 1d6 to that, by all means, wade right into melee.</p> \n    <h2>How\
  \ Many Demons in a Cadre?</h2> \n    <p><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is not afraid\
  \ to try new things, and in this adventure, we're introducing armies. The players\
  \ and the banes both have armies of a sort. Let's look at the player's version first.\
  \ In certain scenarios, the players get a new support card type: the troop card.\
  \ In adventure deck 2, your troops are the Knights of Kenabres, the loyal army you're\
  \ marching to Drezen.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-KnightsOfKenabres.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-KnightsOfKenabres_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>We are the knights who say \"Kenabres!\"</i> \n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>While you're traveling with your troop, after you complete each scenario\
  \ in this adventure, you'll check one of the six boxes on this card; each one corresponds\
  \ to a skill such as Strength or Intelligence. Whenever you encounter a barrier\
  \ that has the Army trait (because an army is much too big to just be a \"monster\"\
  ), each character adds 1d6 to his checks against the army when using the skills\
  \ you checked on your troop. Also, at the end of the adventure, when the town of\
  \ Drezen is cleared of all its baddies, everyone gets an amazing reward based on\
  \ the skills you checked, so choose carefully!</p> \n    <p>Of course, your enemies\
  \ have their own armies, and they are no joke. When you encounter an enemy Army,\
  \ all characters must face them, no matter where they are. (After all, armies are\
  \ really big.) Characters must each attempt a <i>different</i> check from among\
  \ those listed on the card. If <i>any</i> of the checks fail, the army is undefeated.\
  \ Not only that, but the enemy army immediately pillages the location deck for any\
  \ remaining boons before heading off to maraud another open location. You're definitely\
  \ going to need those bonuses from the Knights of Kenabres.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>What forces all these chaotic creatures to march together?</i>\
  \ \n    </div> \n    <h2>Moar Demons</h2> \n    <p>There are, of course, several\
  \ new demons for you to face. The Incubus, as you might imagine, has a \"close friend\"\
  \ in the form of the adventure's servitor demon. And if you lose the fight, he'll\
  \ just have to take one of your allies with him when he goes. Nobody parties quite\
  \ like the Incubus.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-Incubus.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Often seen drinking together.</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ Betrayal Demon doesn't really have any friends, so he wants to make sure that\
  \ you don't have any either: no allies for you, and other players can't pitch in\
  \ to help. On his way out, he'll somehow convince you to stab one of your friends.\
  \ That's sure to increase your popularity.</p> \n    <h2>Lead Me Not into Temptation</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>There's another mechanic that is new to Wrath of the Righteous that I\
  \ haven't really talked about yet: Temptation. These banes are a new kind of barrier.\
  \ Unlike other banes, you don't have to defeat them. When you encounter them, they\
  \ present a choice to the playersâ€”sometimes immediately, and sometimes they lie\
  \ in wait. Each of them provides a valuable new ability to the players, but there's\
  \ always a cost.</p> \n    <p>Adventure 2 introduces the Blood of Eustoyriax. I'm\
  \ sure your mother warned you never to drink the blood of a demon, but she's not\
  \ here right now, so maybe you should consider it. After all, drawing a bunch of\
  \ cards at the start of your turn seems like a pretty big advantage, and you might\
  \ not even have to bury any cards (if you get lucky).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Tastes like burning!</i> \n    </div> \n    <h2>The Good Guys</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Not everything is made of flames and death. This expansion includes some\
  \ new cohorts. Queen Galfrey lets you either gain a bunch of boons or raise the\
  \ dead, and Nurah Dendiwhar lets you add to any check. Of course, it turns out one\
  \ of these women might have a different agenda than the other one, so there could\
  \ be some consequences to her help, but I wouldn't worry about it too much...</p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>At least one of these women will help you.</i> \n    </div>\
  \ \n    <h2>One More Cool Thing</h2> \n    <p>You know all of those irritating Corrupted\
  \ cards you've been carrying around and wondering what to do with? Behold the Corruption\
  \ Forge!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6022-CorruptionForge.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Redeem boons for valuable prizes!</i> \n    </div> \n    <p>This\
  \ set gives you your first opportunity to redeem a Corrupted item. All you have\
  \ to do is banish a non-Corrupted blessing when you close the location. Then you\
  \ can redeem any card in any character's hand. Which one will you pick?</p> \n \
  \   <p>Well, that about wraps it up for Adventure Deck 2. Come back soon for a peek\
  \ at Adventure Deck 3. Wait... Adventure Deck 3? OH MY GOODNESS! Wait until you\
