               <p itemprop="description">Back in July we introduced a new character to the Pathfinder Society campaign. More accurately, we asked for your help in the form of <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty">a contest to write the character's backstory</a> in 250-300 words. After Tonya copied the entries into a form we could review without seeing any author names, the team set to reading through the 53 narratives and picking out our favorites.</p>
               <p>We've included our top four picks below, and it's now the community's turn to decide. Vote for your favorite by <b>September 29 at 5:00 PM Pacific time</b> and we'll announce the winner soon afterward in a later blog. Remember that those who participate in the contest—including in the voting process—contribute to the Liberty's Edge faction's goals for the recent Season 9 <a href="/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards">Faction Journal Cards</a> update.</p>
               <p>When we launched this contest, we were still several weeks away from the release of <a href="/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a>. That adventure has a significant Liberty's Edge faction connection, and I encourage everyone to play it. It also provides a little more context for this contest—not necessary to vote on your favorite background, but potentially helpful. I've included that information in a spoiler below, so investigate at your own peril.</p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02 Spoiler</b> <input type="button" value="Show" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
               <div class="spoiler-text">
                Major Colson Maldris has gone missing, and it seems he's enlisted some very questionable allies. Without an appointed leader, the Liberty's Edge faction needs a temporary leader to keep the operation running smoothly and coordinate the hunt for Maldris. Might this individual take on the challenge?

               <blockquote>
                <h3>Daarit Kwelu</h3>
                <p>Daarit Kwelu was born in the abolitionist city-state of Senghor. Her father, Tadesse, was a scrupulous investor in the long haul sea trade who used his fortune to ensure that his two daughters would be free to pursue their own paths in life. While her younger sister, Rensaret, decided to put her talents into the Senghorian navy, Daarit chose to go to the Magaambya and put her mind to work.</p>
                <p>Her education in Nantambu focused on the modern and ancient languages of the Inner Sea, and she quickly began serving as a junior translator for visiting scholars. Daarit proved her lexical mastery when she assisted Neiford Sharrowsmith in deciphering a recovered codex from a fallen Shory sky city. Her ability to interpret subtle nuances in the Shory language helped render ancient metaphors into functional formulae, unlocking new and deeper understandings of the lost aeromantic arts.</p>
                <p>That Shory text awakened in her a sense of awe and pride in the history of the Expanse and its people. Fueled by these stories of ancestors who conquered earth and sky, she became even more attuned to the liberator's cause; seeing in each Mwangi slave a sky master chained to the ground.</p>
                <p>Upon completing her studies, Daarit returned home with a dream of restoring the ancient power and glory of the Expanse. Her vision of a great nation for a free and united Mwangi people was well received by council elder Helise Solu who saw in her a voice for his own expansionist politics. Daarit now serves as a translator and diplomat for Senghor, brokering alliances between the Mwangi free cities, advocating for the abolition of slavery throughout Garund, and hoping, one day, to see her people return to the sky.</p>
                <h3>Folami Kanye</h3>
                <p>Folami Kanye was born on the waves to a family of Ombo pirates and slavers, and from birth she was trained to be a savvy negotiator and capable fighter. However, her relatives' actions never sat well with her, especially in Sargava. She felt as though the Ijo they frequently abducted were her own people and wished that the two groups could unite against their Chelish oppressors.</p>
                <p>When Folami was 19, her family captured an elderly Ijo woman named Abena, who reminded Folami of her deceased grandmother. After a storm destroyed their provisions, Folami's sister Ife, the vessel's captain, ordered the deaths of Abena and two other slaves to save resources. In a daring rescue, which even Folami admitted worked only because Ife never suspected her sister's betrayal, Folami fought off her sister's guards and hustled the slaves to a life boat. Unwilling to harm her sister, Ife did not pursue, and an Ijo fishing vessel picked up Folami, Abena, and the others.</p>
                <p>Over the next few years, Folami set up a small but thriving operation to rescue slaves from Ombo pirates like her family. Her friend Abena manages Folami's headquarters, all the while chiding her to find a more peaceful solution to Ijo problems. Folami realizes that her endeavors are adding to the Bonuwat vs. Bonuwat fighting that she found counterproductive in her youth, but at least now she fights for justice.</p>
                <p>When the Pathfinder Society won the Sargava Chalice in 4717 and even extracted concessions from the Chelish nobles regarding the cup's ownership, Folami recognized that an alliance with the organization might help her realize the goals of freedom on a larger scale. After doing some research, she contacted Colson Maldris and offered her team's services in exchange for a broadening of Liberty's Edge's endeavors in Western Garund.</p>
                <h3>Helakai Ironsi</h3>
                <p>Helakai Ironsi is a traveling manifestation of the ethics of her Caldaru heritage. Born and raised in Senghor, as most Caldaru are, Helakai has grown into a dual role in life. She travels openly as a merchant, yet in private she is a steadfast vessel of the Bonuwat diety known as Shimye-Magalla.</p>
                <p>Her travels take her from Senghor to Bloodcove and then up the Vanji River to Nantambu and Lake Ocota. Not specializing in any one product, she selects from the variety of goods that arrive in Senghor to make up her cargo for the upriver journey. It is in the return trip downriver that she serves Shimye-Magalla and her ancestors' spirits.</p>
                <p>Helakai runs escaped slaves, hidden among her crew or concealed by her magic. Outwardly her vessel is filled with trade goods from the interior, but this simply defrays the cost of bringing those unfortunates to Senghor and the freedom of that doorway to the open sea. Some will challenge her story, but she is resourceful and has always won free.</p>
                <p>She sees as her greatest danger the possibility of a double-agent posing as an escaped slave. This would be serious trouble if she was ratted out to the Aspis Consortium in Bloodcove. Fighting through the Aspis base is not an option, subterfuge is the only tactic that works. Helakai has become quite skilled at that.</p>
                <p>Her current and recent trading partners include Aya Allahe and Sharrowsmith's Exports, through which she has become aware of the Pathfinder Society and their links in the wider world. Lately that connection has become more active.</p>
                <h3>Karisa Starsight</h3>
                <p>The pirate slaver Kolm Redarax of the <em>Besmara's Lash</em> came upon an adrift Bonuwat ship. Redarax found the crew entirely missing with no sign of violence. Just as he set to leave the apparently cursed vessel, an infant's cry was heard. Redarax found a swaddled Bonuwat girl-child. When the infant opened her eyes, Redarax noticed their striking blue color that seemed radiant in the sun. Redarax named her Karisa Starsight—his daughter.</p>
                <p>Being the daughter of the captain did not exempt Karisa from duty. She tended to the needs of the slaves Redarax traded in various Garundi ports. She came to realize the slaves were people with the same worth as any other. As she grew into a young adult, she was torn between the plight of the slaves and her love for her father.</p>
                <p>One day the <em>Besmara's Lash</em> was attacked by a Gray Corsairs vessel, captained by a friend of Major Colson Madris. The Corsairs were victorious. When the Andoren captain was about to put Redarax to the sword, Karisa intervened. She pledged her service to Andoran and freedom in exchange for Redarax's life. The captain agreed, but reasoned that putting her into simple servitude would be an act little better than those of Redarax. He decided to send her to be mentored by his friend Madris in Absalom, while Redarax was taken to an Andoren prison.</p>
                <p>Karisa quickly excelled as an aide to Madris. Life at sea has given her a disciplined work ethic, enhanced by interpersonal skills learned from many cultures. Madris has made her his steward, having her assign Pathfinders and other agents to various tasks in the cause of freedom. Karisa is proud of her role, but she can't forget that her father—no matter how much she despises his morals—is himself bound in chains.</p>
                <h3>Orisa Ombo</h3>
                <p>Traders know Orisa Ombo as the powerful scion of the nine-feathers trading house. She travels throughout Garund and Avistan, sternly trading the wares of her family: rare hardwoods, magical items, seafood and most heartlessly, slaves. The cold-hearted Lady Ombo cuts hard bargains and doesn't flinch from questionable tactics. She has brought profit and renown to her house, but she is not the woman she used to be.</p>
                <p>Several years ago, Orisa collected a group of Bonuwat slaves to trade in Katapesh. Among them was a Janni priest of Shimye-Magalla known as Ardrashir. Ancient tradition among the Bonuwat forbid harming servants of this nature god, but Orisa sold him to depraved cultists of Lamashtu for great profit. The night the priest was sacrificed, Orisa tossed and turned in her fine bed, and she was visited by a vision of Shimye-Magalla. The angry spirit fused the soul of Ardashir into Orisa Ombo and cursed her for breaking the ancient laws of her people.</p>
                <p>Ardashir struggled within Orisa and forced her to face his suffering. Now, Orisa pretends to be same heartless merchant queen, but by night, word has spread throughout the inner sea region of an avenging angel, who seems to know all the secrets of the slavers he targets. The Shadow Angel is Orisa's body possessed by Ardashir's soul. He strikes slaving rings where they are most vulnerable and disappears into the night.</p>
                <p>Lady Orisa works with Liberty's Edge, offering them information and secret financial support. In return, she asks for Pathfinder strike teams to attack slavers and those that protect them. She is a master of disguise who is careful to protect her cover identity and can even be found posing as a slave, following the trade routes to gather information.</p>
