  \    </div> \n    <p>Cave raptors are sated; It's time to blog! </p> \n    <p>As\
  \ it stands, <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i></a> is now written and assembled\
  \ by its loving developer. Though awkward and gangly, we can see what it will finally\
  \ grow up into. But at this point, this happy child is nothing more than a text\
  \ document in the daycare that is a documents folder, happy rolling in the mud and\
  \ receiving bowl cuts from mom. But there's an ugly truth for gaming products that\
  \ this little production goblin's learned at her junior prom: you can be creative\
  \ and brilliant, but if you don't look good, nobody'll pick you up.</p> \n    <p>Enter\
  \ the art order, the good grooming of game design.</p> \n    <p>The majestic octopus\
  \ mates for life, and hopes to find a sensitive and intellectually compatible lover\
  \ that shares its appreciation of American Gothic poetry, but it will make its initial\
  \ judgments based on appearance and health. Similarly, good art can make a product\
  \ seem interesting and romantic before the first words are even read. It can make\
  \ the difference between a product you don't tell your friends about, and one you\
  \ take home to mom. But like an attractive octopus, a quality illustration must\
  \ be carefully cared for if it is to be worthwhile.</p> \n    <p>The art order begins\
  \ once the text for a product has begun development. By now, the developer knows\
  \ how everything will shake down, even if the specifics remain a mystery. The developer\
  \ will sit down with the decorator crab that is the art director, and with careful\
  \ attention to the budget, they decide how much art the book can stand and what\
  \ compelling elements to call out in pictorial form. With that list completed, the\
  \ task is kicked back to the developer and his editorial cronies, who write up brief\
  \ descriptions of all the illustrations they'll need to get their product a seat\
  \ at the popular table during lunch.</p> \n    <p>By now, the art director is already\
  \ comfortable in its den, combing through the preferred artists list and thinking\
  \ about what to assign to whom. Just like writers and tutors, different artists'\
  \ styles lend themselves better to different moods and fit different products*.\
  \ A happy, bubbly, or wacky artist would be a terrible fit for <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"\
  > <i>Dwarves of Golarion</i></a>'s \"quiet and cool\" attitude, and would be better\
  \ suited for its goofy sidekick, <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88wj\"\
  ><i>Gnomes of Golarion</i></a>. Once the art orders are written, the art director\
  \ mails them along to the illustrators of choice, together with the promise of great\
  \ riches. </p>\n    <p>The first thing received from the artists are those embarrassing\
  \ family photos we like to call 'sketches.' These are passed out among the editorial\
  \ and art staff, who make crippling judgments about cowlicks, large ears, and crooked\
  \ teeth that will haunt the product well into adulthood. They also make note of\
  \ any changes the artist needs to make.</p> \n    <p>Finally, the finished images\
  \ are received from the artists who, like the octopus, die shortly afterwards. This\
  \ cruel cycle of nature provides the few glimpse of a grown-up, mature product that\
  \ needs to be home by ten because tonight is a school night.</p> \n    <div align=\"\

  \     </table>\n    </div> \n    <p>The art order is vital in a product's life cycle\
  \ because it prevents the normally docile artists from breaking free of their enclosures\
  \ and wandering the streets, mauling and tagging innocent civilians at random. It\
  \ also serves as the cranial implant that prevents the art directors from seizing\
  \ the reigns of power and assuming their rightful places as god-kings, directing\
  \ the entirety of a company's funding into a single, penultimate illustration that\
  \ makes children weep and grown men fall to their knees in prayer. Very important\
  \ if you are a company looking to put out more than one product.</p> \n    <p>By\
  \ now in the life cycle, our game product has begun to grow up and go through some\
  \ awkward changes. Suitors have come calling, and its started wearing makeup. Tune\
  \ in next week when we'll examine how to cope with your precious first draft's frustrating\
  \ period of editing!</p> \n    <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production Assistant</p> \n\
  \    <p class=\"tiny\">*Except for Wayne Reynolds, whose art is universal and can\
  \ bring peace to warring nations.</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Crystal Frasier,\
