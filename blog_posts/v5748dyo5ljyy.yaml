  description\"><i>Where the First Seeker leads, the Second Seekers follow. Exemplifying\
  \ dutiful service, the Second Seekers follow-through on the Society's pledge to\
  \ support the First Seeker, the elected head of the Starfinder Society. Unlike other\
  \ factions, the goals of the Second Seekers vary over time, adapting to each new\
  \ leader's mission.</i></p> \n    <p>Even before the Organized Play team started\
  \ work on the factions for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, we had the\
  \ opportunity to work with the Starfinder team to create the in-game Starfinder\
  \ Society organization. One thing the Organized Play team agreed on from the beginning\
  \ was changing up some of the leadership structure for the new Society. We'll be\
  \ going into further detail on differences between the Pathfinder Society and Starfinder\
  \ Society in a future blog post, but for purposes of today's blog, I wanted to briefly\
  \ talk about one new role: the First Seeker.</p> \n    <p>The First Seeker is an\
  \ elected Starfinder who takes on a senior leadership role within the Starfinder\
  \ Society, directing the organization for a brief period. Each First Seeker is elected\
  \ based on a platform: a defined goal for the Starfinder Society to pursue. As an\
  \ example, the Society's previous First Seeker, a kasathan solarian named Jadnura,\
  \ petitioned to explore a corner of the galaxy known as the Scoured Stars. That\
  \ particular mission didn't go so well for the Society...</p> \n    <p>The Second\
  \ Seekers are a faction dedicated to furthering the agenda of the current First\
  \ Seeker. Their dedication extends only to a specific First Seeker, not necessarily\
  \ to any First Seekers who came before or after. When characters gain Reputation\
  \ with the Second Seekers, they only gain Reputation with the specific First Seeker\
  \ who they champion. This means that the Second Seekers will evolve as we continue\
  \ telling stories through the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild campaign, with\
  \ each newly elected First Seeker acting as an entirely new faction. Once a First\
  \ Seeker's term ends—such as at the end of a season storyline—that doesn't mean\
  \ your characters stop championing that First Seeker. In fact, any character with\
  \ an appropriate faction boon for that specific First Seeker can continue to champion\
  \ that individual for the rest of her career—just don't expect a lot of new scenarios\
  \ involving that First Seeker!</p> \n    <p>Because of the First Seeker's importance\
  \ to the Second Seekers faction, you'll see the Second Seekers presented in text\
  \ with the associated First Seeker listed in parenthesis. The first iteration of\
  \ the Second Seekers faction shows up as \"Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo).\"</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurb180\" style=\"background-color: #fff;\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Starfinder/PZO7201-Luwazi.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7201-Luwazi_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Miroslav Petrov</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>This\
  \ brings us to our first faction leader for the Second Seekers: <b>Luwazi Elsebo</b>\
  \ (NG female human envoy). Luwazi was responsible for keeping the Starfinder Society\
  \ together in the aftermath of the previous First Seeker's expedition to the Scoured\
  \ Stars. Her goals include rebuilding the damaged Society while investigating what\
  \ happened in the Scoured Stars. If any of the Starfinders lost in the Scoured Stars\
  \ can be saved, Luwazi intends to find a way to make that happen.</p> \n    <p>Players\
  \ get their first chance to interact with Luwazi Elsebo in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a>,\
  \ the pregenerated character special debuting at Gen Con 2017, written by Pathfinder\
  \ Society and Adventure Path veteran, Larry Wilhelm. This scenario acts as a prequel\
  \ to the start of the Year of Scoured Stars, and showcases some of Luwazi's more\
  \ unorthodox methods for keeping the Starfinder Society intact, along with the first\
  \ seeds of a faction we'll be spotlighting in a future blog.</p> \n    <p>Now, I\
  \ don't want the Exo-Guardians to get away with having more information than our\
  \ recently spotlighted faction, so I figure I can share one more thing. Characters\
  \ gaining Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) Reputation can access some pretty exceptional\
  \ boons, many of them themed around the idea of preserving and rebuilding the wounded\
  \ Starfinder Society. Here's one boon I think a lot of Second Seekers are going\
  \ to pick up.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Team Spirit\
  \ (Untyped Boon)</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">You are an expert at using your\
  \ resources to help other Stafinders.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo): Tier 2</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b>:\
  \ 1 Fame</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: When you or another\
  \ character is killed during an adventure in which your participated, reduce the\
  \ Fame cost of the raise dead spellcasting service by 2. This boon is not expended\
  \ when used.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b>: A character can\
  \ only benefit from one copy of this book at a time, to a maximum discount of 2\
  \ Fame.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>As you can see, a character purchasing\
  \ this boon reduces the cost of raise dead by a noticeable amount of Fame. Even\
  \ if just one character in a group has this boon, every character at the table benefits\
  \ from the discount. I suspect we'll see a lot of characters gaining Second Seekers\
  \ (Luwazi Elsebo) Reputation picking this boon up. I also suspect we'll see groups\
  \ looking to muster for higher difficulty content going out of their way to make\
  \ sure a Second Seeker is on the team!</p> \n    <p>Ok, that's it for today's post;\
  \ I need to get back to finishing up the last Gen Con scenarios. Stay tuned for\
  \ our next blog, when we talk about Wayfinders—and I don't mean the magical compasses!</p>\
