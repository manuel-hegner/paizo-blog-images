  artist: "the good folks at Impressions Marketing, Free RPG Day works with hobby\
    \ game retailers and RPG publishers to create in-store events that give away new\
    \ RPG quick start rules and adventure modules. This year, the event is worldwide,\
    \ meaning gamers in Canada, England, Germany, Scotland, Spain, Costa Rica, Chile,\
    \ and the United States will be able to get their hands on a copy of Paizo's Free\
    \ RPG Day module, D1.5: Revenge of the Kobold King. It should have been the end.\
    \ When the bloodthirsty adventurers burst into his throne room and mercilessly\
    \ cut him down, the tale of Merlokrep, last king of the ill-fated Truescale Tribe,\
    \ should have ended. But the fates weren't yet finished with the Kobold King,\
    \ and now a dark power has brought him back"
