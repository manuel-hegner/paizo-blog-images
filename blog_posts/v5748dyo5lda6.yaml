  \    <br> The paizo.com homepage in late 2003 showing off our ability to take subscriptions!\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>As January 2003 rolled in, the rose-colored glasses that accompany\
  \ any new venture had faded, and it had become obvious to me that relying on the\
  \ expertise of others wasn't working out—I needed to gain a full understanding of\
  \ the complex magazine business myself. So I spent many a long hour in the offices\
  \ of Paizo's resident magazine gurus, Publisher Johnny Wilson and Circulation Manager\
  \ Pierce Watters, asking questions and challenging common practices. I also took\
  \ the month of February to lock myself in my home office and pore over all the financial\
  \ data we had, looking for better ways to make a profit in the magazine business.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>One thing that made my analysis difficult is that we didn't yet have final\
  \ sales figures on a single Paizo issue. While the publishing part of the magazine\
  \ business happens at a breakneck pace, the distribution end of things operates\
  \ at near-glacial speeds. Newsstands and bookstores have the ability to return unsold\
  \ magazines for up to ten months after they're no longer available for sale, so\
  \ the distributor holds back part of the publisher's revenue from sales as a reserve\
  \ against these late returns. So, even though we had sent out first issues to the\
  \ printer in July 2002, we wouldn't have final sales figures for those issues until\
  \ late summer. And those were issues that had begun life under Wizards of the Coast;\
  \ we wouldn't see final figures for the first magazines that Paizo was entirely\
  \ responsible for until late 2003, nearly a year and a half after we started.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This also means that it took us ages to see the results of changes we\
  \ made. If we came up with an idea for a particular issue, it would take a couple\
  \ of months for that idea to reach the newsstand, and by the time we had final sales\
  \ figures on that issue, a full year had passed. We liked to imagine that making\
  \ running changes to a magazine must be a lot like trying to turn an oil tanker\
  \ in the dark with no instruments.</p> \n   <p>One of the first things we figured\
  \ out was that we were paying too much to have an outside firm handle our subscriptions.\
  \ I did an in-depth analysis of where the money from a subscription goes, and determined\
  \ that there was very little margin for error. If we needed to send out a single\
  \ replacement for a lost issue, it pretty much destroyed any profit we might have\
  \ had on that subscription. If we needed to send more than one renewal notice, same\
  \ thing. And the fees that our subscription service charged made things even worse.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But bringing subscriptions in-house was a big task. Our staff was set\
  \ up to create magazines; we didn't have the customer service or data management\
  \ people we'd need to handle subscriptions ourselves. We figured out quickly that\
  \ we needed to take advantage of the internet to cut down on the costs for data\
  \ entry and sending renewal notices. If we could get subscribers to move away from\
  \ sending in checks in response to mailed renewal notices, shifting them to renewing\
  \ online with notices delivered by email, we could actually begin to make some profit\
  \ on subscriptions. But that meant we'd need a website that could process credit\
  \ cards and a robust database to keep track of customers and issues sent. At the\
  \ time, nobody in the world provided e-commerce solutions for managing magazine\
  \ subscriptions over the web. </p> \n   <p>Enter Rob Head, one of Vic's friends\
  \ from high school who had been working at Amazon. We hired him to create our very\
  \ own subscription fulfillment system from scratch—a system that has successfully\
  \ evolved to support all of the business we do today. (Rob also provided Paizo with\
  \ our first unofficial motto: \"We suck less every day.\")</p> \n   <p>We also needed\
  \ to make changes to the magazines themselves. At the time, <i>Dungeon</i> magazine\
  \ was bimonthly, but with each issue having a higher page count than the monthly\
  \ <i>Dragon</i>. I quickly figured out that we would need to charge close to $12.99\
  \ per issue to bring in the same profit as the smaller <i>Dragon</i> issues, and\
  \ that just wasn't feasible on the newsstand. So, in May, <i>Dungeon</i>/<i>Polyhedron</i>\
  \ went monthly with a smaller page count and a lower cover price. </p> \n   <div\

  ><i>Dungeon</i> #100, and <i>Polyhedron</i> #159</a>.\n   </div> \n   <p>But the\
  \ most important development for <i>Dungeon</i> in 2003 was a bit more subtle: the\
  \ debut of our first ever Adventure Path, <a href=\"/dungeon/products/issues/shackledCity\"\
  >The Shackled City</a>, in the March/April issue. The idea for running a full-length\
  \ campaign in <i>Dungeon</i>, one adventure at a time, predates the start of Paizo,\
  \ but the process of turning that idea into reality took long enough that the concept\
  \ only saw fruition in our hands. <a href=\"/products/btpy7z7d\"><i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ #97</a> included Chris Perkins's \"Life's Bazaar\" adventure, set in the town\
  \ of Cauldron. The reaction to The Shackled City was nothing short of fantastic,\
  \ yet little did we realize that the Adventure Path would eventually become our\
  \ flagship brand, and our salvation in our most difficult time. </p> \n   <p><i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ #97 also marked the debut of our first PDF product, a free <a href=\"/dungeon/news/v5748eaic9jsa\"\
  >web enhancement</a> containing extra content that we couldn't fit into the issue.\
  \ In the future, PDFs would become a huge part of Paizo's success, but at the time,\
  \ it was just a way to keep Chris Perkins's overwriting from ending up on the cutting\
  \ room floor! </p> \n   <p>Later in the year, Chris once again wrote too much, leading\
  \ to our first for-sale PDF, the <a href=\"/products/btpy72tw\">Tu'narath City Guide</a>\
  \ supplement for <a href=\"/products/btpy7z77\"><i>Dungeon</i> #100</a>. This PDF\
  \ provided an entire githyanki city to go with our Incursion super-event, a huge\
  \ crossover that ran in <a href=\"/products/btpy7zvj\"><i>Dragon</i> #309</a>, <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ #100, and <i>Polyhedron</i> #159, each cover featuring one part of a three-piece\
  \ mega-cover by Wayne Reynolds. (Wayne's original triptych hangs in my office today.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The following issue of <a href=\"/products/btpy7e8w\"><i>Dragon</i>, #310</a>,\
  \ had the first-ever <a href=\"/products/btpy72v8\">3.5 DM Screen</a> polybagged\
  \ with it. The screen was a huge success, driving record sell-through in stores\
  \ and increasing our subscription numbers quite a bit. </p> \n   <p>I had also realized\
  \ that Paizo had a bunch of resources that weren't being used to their fullest.\
  \ While the editorial staffs of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> rarely had a spare\
  \ moment, the editors of <a href=\"/store/magazines/starWarsInsider\"><i>Star Wars\
  \ Insider</i></a> (which Lucasfilm limited to eight issues per year) and the people\
  \ who handled advertising, circulation and print brokering could easily shoulder\
  \ the burden of adding a new magazine to the fold. So Johnny came up with <a href=\"\
  /undefeated/products/issues\"><i>Undefeated</i></a>, a magazine about competitive\
  \ games such as card games, board games, and miniatures games. When Johnny was at\
  \ Wizards of the Coast, he had helmed a magazine called <i>Top Deck</i>, which had\
  \ pretty good sales. <i>Top Deck</i> was linked to Magic: The Gathering, an advantage\
  \ we didn't have, but we figured that if we could capture even a small amount of\
  \ the <i>Top Deck</i> crowd with <i>Undefeated</i>, that would be good enough for\
  \ Paizo. We did the math, and worked out that if we could just get each hobby store\
  \ in the country to order two copies of each issue, we'd be set. We also knew that\
  \ companies that published CCGs, board games and miniatures games had more money\
  \ to spend on advertising than RPG companies, and since there were no magazines\
  \ dedicated to covering them, we figured we'd be able to bring in decent advertising\
  \ revenue. In addition, the fact that Paizo was built entirely on licensed magazines\
  \ we didn't own—and that could someday go away—wasn't lost on me. <i>Undefeated</i>\
  \ was our first shot at building equity in something we owned. </p> \n   <p>We announced\
  \ the magazine on April 9 with the tagline \"Covering Games You Can Win... Because\
  \ Nobody Likes a Loser!\" A stealth mission of <i>Undefeated</i> was to serve as\
  \ a test bed for taking subscriptions in-house. On June 6, we announced that you\
  \ could subscribe to <i>Undefeated</i> on paizo.com. We used the next few months\
  \ to tweak our system, hire a full-time customer service staff, and figure out how\
  \ to port all of the legacy data from our third-party fulfillment service before\
  \ we moved the other three magazines' subscriptions to our website later in the\
  \ year. </p> \n   <p><i>Undefeated</i> was a huge part of our Gen Con push that\
  \ year, as the first issue was released at the con, introducing thousands of gamers\
  \ to our new baby.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120329-Lisa.jpg\"\

  \ <br> Lisa Stevens and Mary Franklin address the crowd at the Brown Derby during\
  \ the first Official Star Wars Fan Club breakfast.\n   </div> \n   <p>On the Star\
  \ Wars front, our primary efforts revolved around making <i>Star Wars Insider</i>\
  \ more than just a magazine—we wanted it to be the voice of a revived Star Wars\
  \ Fan Club, which had been reduced to little more than a magazine subscription over\
  \ the years. The original Star Wars Fan Club offered exclusive merchandise to its\
  \ members, so in that vein, we worked out a deal with Hasbro to be the exclusive\
  \ seller of a special silver Boba Fett action figure. Again, there was a stealth\
  \ objective here—we wanted to test our ability to take orders for and ship a product\
  \ through paizo.com. The silver Fett was a huge sales success, with the barrage\
  \ of people making a run on paizo.com bringing the site down for a short while and\
  \ lines of folks stretching out of the Paizo booth at Origins, San Diego Comic-Con,\
  \ and Gen Con. </p> \n   <p>The summer of Fett also saw us launch a series of Star\
  \ Wars Fan Club Breakfasts. The first was held at the Brown Derby restaurant at\
  \ Disney/MGM Studios in Orlando, coinciding with their annual Star Wars Weekends\
  \ event. Hundreds of ardent Star Wars fans got up very early to get one of the coveted\
  \ silver Fetts, and to meet Jeremy Bulloch and Peter Mayhew, who played Boba Fett\
  \ and Chewbacca respectively. We then took the whole group into the park for an\
  \ early morning Star Tours ride before the day's regular festivities kicked in.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>At our other three conventions that year, we had Jeremy Bulloch and\
  \ Daniel Logan (young Boba Fett in Episode II) at our booth signing silver Fetts.\
  \ They were also guests at our Fan Club breakfasts at Gen Con and Comic-Con, with\
  \ Star Wars author Mike Stackpole filling that role at Origins. </p> \n   <p>We\
  \ also adjusted the content of <i>Star Wars Insider</i> to appeal more to the ranks\
  \ of Star Wars collectors. In addition to including more articles on collectibles,\
  \ we arranged to reveal upcoming Hasbro toys for the very first time in each installment\
  \ of a new regular column called \"Toybox.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n\

  \ at San Diego Comic-Con 2003.\n   </div> \n   <p>Later in the year, Paizo spearheaded\
  \ a partnership with Hasbro, Del Rey, and Scholastic to offer an exclusive Clone\
  \ Wars short story collection (get the free 1 MB PDF <a href=\"/download/starwars/shortstorycollection.pdf\"\
  >here</a>!) that bundled original Star Wars fiction with select Hasbro toys for\
  \ the first time. And at the end of the year, we celebrated the holidays with our\
  \ second exclusive Star Wars action figure, the lovable Holiday Yoda, inspired by\
  \ the Christmas card artwork of Ralph McQuarrie.</p> \n   <p>The end of the year\
  \ also saw a big change in the management of Paizo with the departure of Johnny\
  \ Wilson. As I mentioned earlier in this blog, I spent a lot of 2003 analyzing the\
  \ magazine business and coming up with ideas about how to make it work better for\
  \ Paizo. This led me to clash quite a bit with Johnny as I questioned decades of\
  \ common industry practices that he considered sacrosanct. Eventually, it became\
  \ apparent that our differences were too vast to reconcile, so on December 8th,\
  \ we announced his departure from Paizo. While this move relieved some of the pressure\
  \ in the office, it also put me in a position I didn't intend to be in when we started\
  \ Paizo: I was now fully in charge of a business that I had all of 18 months experience\
  \ with. It was daunting, but I had a great staff. Nevertheless, I needed some additional\
  \ help running the company, so I brought in Keith Strohm, whom I had worked with\
  \ as part of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Third Edition team at Wizards of the Coast.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>The final big event of 2003 happened at the very end. As Vic and\
  \ I were about to leave the office to join the rest of the staff for a holiday screening\
  \ of <i>Return of the King</i>, I received a phone call from Lucasfilm. They were\
  \ invoking a clause in our contract that would allow them to end our license should\
  \ Johnny Wilson ever leave Paizo. They had put this clause in at the beginning of\
  \ our relationship because of my lack of experience with magazines—they wanted to\
  \ be protected if Johnny, the guy who knew the business, left. I had also spent\
  \ a lot of the year convincing Lucasfilm of the potential I thought the Fan Club\
  \ held, and it turns out I'd done that perhaps too well—they now wanted to manage\
  \ it themselves. They gave us a few months to tie things up before <i>Star Wars\
  \ Insider</i> went away, which takes us into 2004, so I'll talk more about the implications\
  \ to Paizo in the next anniversary blog. (Needless to say, after receiving that\
  \ news, Vic and I weren't much in the mood for watching <i>Return of the King</i>,\
  \ so we went home and only shared the news with the company the next work day.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>As 2003 ended, there were a lot of big questions for Paizo. Could I run\
  \ the company without the years of magazine experience that Johnny had brought to\
  \ the table? Could Paizo survive the loss of its biggest magazine, <i>Star Wars\
  \ Insider</i>? Could we continue to make the hard decisions we needed to become\
  \ more profitable? </p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Employees who started in 2003\

  \ Star Wars Fan's Dream Comes True</b></p> \n   <p>One of the benefits of being\
  \ the president of the Official Star Wars Fan Club and publishing <i>Star Wars Insider</i>\
  \ was being invited to Australia to see the filming of the final Star Wars movie.\
  \ Vic Wertz, Dave Gross, Mary Franklin, and I got to spend three glorious days on\
  \ the set of <i>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i> watching the filming, including\
  \ much of the final lightsaber duel between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\
  \ We also interviewed many of Lucasfilm's department heads, including props, stunts,\
  \ wardrobe, makeup, special effects, set design, production, and editing. This culminated\
  \ in a lunch with the maker himself, George Lucas. Here I was, watching the last\
  \ days of filming of the last Star Wars movie—an event that I will cherish for the\
  \ rest of my life!</p> \n   <p><b>Maximum Play</b></p> \n   <p>One little-known\
  \ 2003 project was, like <i>Undefeated</i>, an attempt to leverage our expertise—\
  and extra bandwidth—in prepress and printing. From the beginning, Paizo did our\
  \ own prepress work, something many companies outsourced at the time due to its\
  \ specific expertise and relatively high equipment costs. But Wizards of the Coast\
  \ had been doing all of its prepress in-house, so we inherited the necessary skills\
  \ and equipment. Our Production Manager, John Dunn, felt that we could make some\
  \ money selling our prepress services to other companies, and he spent much of 2003\
  \ pitching our services to no avail before he left to do print management for Microsoft.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>We did have one bite, though: one of Johnny's friends was starting\
  \ a company called Play Interactive in order to publish a videogame magazine to\
  \ be sold through GameStop stores, so Johnny offered up our services as prepress\
  \ and print coordinators. Paizo would receive the finished magazine files and Play\
  \ Interactive would pay us to handle things from there. Vic and I had insisted that\
  \ Play Interactive put money into an escrow account to cover their costs before\
  \ we began work, but Johnny decided to proceed without waiting for payment. Of course,\
  \ by the time <i>Maximum Play</i> #1 hit our warehouse, things had already started\
  \ to break down. Play Interactive's deal with GameStop had gone south, and they\
  \ couldn't pay us. Play Interactive quickly disbanded, leaving us holding the bill,\
  \ and with no place to sell the already printed magazine to recover our costs. We\
  \ eventually won a lawsuit against Play Interactive, but, as they say, you can't\
  \ get blood from a stone, so we never recouped a dime, and the cost of the lawsuit\
  \ just increased the amount of money we lost on this little venture. You can still\
  \ buy a copy of the first—and only—issue of <i>Maximum Play</i> <a href=\"/products/btpy7rvo?Maximum-Play-1\"\
  >here on paizo.com</a>: it's a lasting memory of a deal gone bad.</p> \n   <p>Lisa\
  \ Stevens<br> <i>CEO</i></p> \n   <br>\n   <br> \n   <h2>\"That's Not A Desk\":\
  \ The Wes Schneider Story</h2> \n   <p>Today, I would think, \"That's not a desk.\
  \ Desks are about 2-1/2 feet tall. This is over 3 feet tall and attached to the\
  \ wall—making it a mailing counter.\" At the time, though, still less than 96 hours\
  \ off the plane from my former home in Maryland, all I could think was: \"I'm here.\
  \ I have a desk. I work on <i>Dragon</i>.\" Then I smirked, because my face was\
  \ cracking trying to hold back another bout of maniacally delighted laughter.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Less than a week earlier, when <i>Dragon</i> magazine Editor-in-Chief\
  \ Matt Sernett asked if I could start Monday, I told him of course! It's only a\
  \ 3,000-mile move to a place I've never been—it's an adventure! I'd known since\
  \ 10th grade that I wanted to be the editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon</i> magazine,\
  \ so it's not like I was going to say no.</p> \n   <p>The Paizo offices were not\
  \ glamorous in 2003, but it'd be years before I realized that. All I knew was that\
  \ this was how the world of professional gaming and magazine publishing looked:\
  \ four magazines' worth of staff in one room broken up by cube walls, stacks of\
  \ Wizards of the Coast-branded boxes stacked in corners and squirreled away under\
  \ desks, leaking black beanbag chairs, enough RPG manuals to fill three games stores,\
  \ a galaxy worth of Star Wars tchotchkes, and desks crammed with incoming and outgoing\
  \ manuscripts, sketches, letters, interviews, previews, and articles all created\
  \ by the best-of-the-best in the gaming world, each aimed at its own sickeningly\
  \ imminent deadline. It would take days to take it all in, but there wasn't any\
  \ time for that—<i>Dragon</i> #314 had to get out the door. (Pro Tip: The first\
  \ thing you do at your new magazine job should NOT be to criticize the cover of\
  \ the issue hours away from shipping—even if that's not how Strahd looks, and even\
  \ if you're still right a decade later.)</p> \n   <p>The next few months were professionally\
  \ about learning the ropes the Paizo way, coming to live with deadlines, sitting\
  \ and editing on top of my misproportioned desk, getting the inside story on the\
  \ gaming industry, and undergoing the quintessential new guy rite of passage: shoveling\
  \ through the mountain of unsolicited article proposals in the slush pile (sorry\
  \ P. L., the crawling head has some dues to pay before it gets an ecology). My education\
  \ in the history of <i>Dungeon</i>s &amp; <i>Dragon</i>s beyond my second edition\
  \ roots also started about this time. With freshly minted <i>Dungeon</i> Editor-in-Chief\
  \ Erik Mona laying the foundations for elaborate schemes like Maure Castle (and\
  \ eventually the Age of Worms Adventure Path), the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ editorial pit was awash in inspiration from gaming's oldest and fondest-remembered\
  \ adventures. Only a few years later, many would start considering revitalized stories\
  \ and characters from these early adventures among Paizo's and the magazines' signature\
  \ talents—a knack we still indulge as often as possible today.</p> \n   <p>Unprofessionally,\
  \ those first days were for figuring out what I'd gotten myself into. Mike McArtor\
  \ and I had been hired as <i>Dragon</i>'s new assistant editors at the same time,\
  \ and as we both sported similar hairstyles and facial hair at the time, many staff\
  \ members either couldn't initially tell us apart or didn't realized there were\
  \ two of us—a matter that was urgently addressed and led to the destruction of all\
  \ evidence of my goatee-wearing days. Happenstance and insane odds also had it that\
  \ I'd moved all the way across the country and into the apartment directly next\
  \ door to James Jacobs, which began a long (and still ongoing) tradition of movie\
  \ marathons, commute-based collaborations, and thoroughly blurred professional/personal\
  \ boundaries. Dave Gross, editor of <i>Star Wars Insider</i> at the time and man\
  \ of a dozen congenial but often mysterious agendas, also made it a point to introduce\
  \ the company's freshest fish to Seattle's vibrant art and film culture—ensuring\
  \ that I'll live in this city for as long as it runs a film festival. In the office's\
  \ cramped quarters, any moment without a headset blaring meant listening to coworkers,\
  \ typically Sean Glenn, Kyle Hunter, and Erik Mona's mile-a-minute, in-joke riddled\
  \ banter on the bleeding edge of nerdery (key pieces of which I started transcribing\
  \ into a still-living document that gets printed out for every other Paizo Christmas\
  \ party, and that—for reasons of legality and good taste—will never be publicly\
  \ shared). </p> \n   <p>It's been a while since I was the newest and youngest guy\
  \ at Paizo, and since I've done every editorial job there is at a company where\
  \ \"editor\" means \"guy who does everything.\" We've come a long way from being\
  \ a bunch of distinct operations with a communal living space. There have been plenty\
  \ of laughs and raised cups, but also a fair share of yelling and even a few tears—\
  that's what you get when you have a group of the world's most passionate gamers\
  \ devoted to putting out projects they're excited to use in their games. But after\
  \ nearly a decade and almost a third of my life, one thing about Paizo has remained\
  \ the same since my first day: it's definitely still an adventure.</p> \n   <p>F.\

  \ Jacobs: Fifth Time's the Charm</h2> \n   <p>It took me five tries to get hired\
  \ to work on RPG stuff. </p>\n   <p><b>Attempt 1:</b> I was told that I interviewed\
  \ well, but that I hadn't done enough design work for D&amp;D—as such, the magazine\
  \ department at Wizards of the Coast (where I was working at the time in the Sales\
  \ department processing mountains of Pokémon orders) didn't have a good idea of\
  \ my skills and strengths as a designer/developer/editor (AKA \"as a writer\").\
  \ Owen K. C. Stephens ended up getting the job I was interviewing for.</p> \n  \
  \ <p><b>Attempt 2:</b> A few years later, with several more adventures and articles\
  \ and even a few hardcover book credits under my belt, I interviewed again, this\
  \ time for an assistant editor position on <i>Dragon</i>. They ended up hiring one\
  \ of my closest friends, Eric Haddock, instead, because he had more experience editing.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Attempt 3:</b> Not long after, I interviewed again... but they hired\
  \ Matt Sernett instead because he came into the interview with actual \"had worked\
  \ on a magazine before\" experience.</p> \n   <p><b>Attempt 4:</b> By this point,\
  \ the magazine business had been spun off and Paizo Publishing was up and running.\
  \ A new design position opened in Wizards of the Coast's R&amp;D department, and\
  \ I interviewed for that position and felt VERY good about my chances. By that point\
  \ I'd helped write quite a few D&amp;D hardcovers and who knows how many adventures\
  \ and articles for the magazines (including a few that had become relatively notorious—\
  thanks, <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>!) A few days later, on the day I knew that\
  \ R&amp;D would be making their decision, I was walking down the hall at lunch to\
  \ go get a soda from the machine. I happened to look out the window and saw Chris\
  \ Perkins shaking Jesse Decker's hand. Both were smiling.</p> \n   <p><b>Attempt\
  \ 5:</b> My phone rang at work a week or so later (it was still a few weeks before\
  \ Jesse Decker would be leaving Paizo to come work at WotC)—it was Johnny Wilson.\
  \ His words, more or less: \"They took one of my guys, so I'm gonna take one of\
  \ theirs—do you want to come work at Paizo as an Associate Editor on <i>Dungeon</i>?\"\
  \ Since that had more or less been my dream job since the mid '80s when I'd had\
  \ my first published work appear in <i>Dungeon</i> #12... I said yes.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ started work in the middle of the year, and from the very beginning I knew that\
  \ I'd indeed found the proverbial dream job. Here are a few memorable highlights\
  \ from my first half-year working at Paizo that convinced me I'd finally landed\
  \ the job I wanted to stay at as long as they'd let me keep hanging around...</p>\
  \ \n   <ul>\n    <li>Playing in a D&amp;D game where the CEO of the company was\
  \ playing as well. Lisa played an ogre-mage, if I remember correctly. May have been\
  \ a gold dragon, though. Being the boss lets you play the best monsters, apparently.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Sitting across from Sean Glenn's desk, I got to see all the incredible\
  \ art as it came in, and also got to watch how he built each issue of <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ into a work of art from nothing more than an art order and a big bucket of words.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>One of my first tasks that first week: Erik dropped a document on my\
  \ desk and said, \"Here's stats for Rary. He's 23rd level. Make sure he's a badass.\"\
  \ No pressure!</li> \n    <li>Kyle Hunter getting worked up enough to grab the plastic\
  \ rim off the top of a cubicle and wield it like a katana. I still don't remember\
  \ what I said to get him that freaked out. I should have written it down.</li> \n\
  \    <li>Watching a snake fight a hawk in the Paizo parking lot.</li> \n    <li>Finding\
  \ out about Erik's fear of bears.</li> \n    <li>Watching Wes adjust to the rinky-dink\
  \ desk they had to build for him in the hall because we'd run out of desks. Ha.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Reading adventures by new authors like Richard Pett, Greg A. Vaughan,\
  \ and Nicolas Logue, and getting to decide that they'd be put into print. And getting\
  \ a picture of Warduke on the cover of the magazine.</li> \n    <li>The day Erik\
  \ accidentally clicked on a particularly \"festive\" Christmas-themed link that,\
  \ while he managed to close the browser before the picture loaded completely, still\
  \ scarred many of us for years to come.</li> \n    <li>Finding out that one of Wes's\
  \ superpowers was an uncanny ability to bowl REALLY WELL.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>All\
  \ in all... good times! And I still had the one and only performance of Operation\
  \ Banjo Thug, a (false, alas) pterodactyl sighting, the chance to work with Rob\
  \ Kuntz on Maure Castle, the excitement of ordering my first magazine cover (<a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy7y0c\"><i>Dungeon</i></a> #119), seeing an adventure I wrote\
  \ get turned into a stage production, and more to look forward to in the years to\
  \ come!</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> \n   <table>\n\
