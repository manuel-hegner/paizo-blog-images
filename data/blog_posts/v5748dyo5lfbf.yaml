  \ \n      <p><b>Hex-Prone (Su)</b> An almiraj takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws\
  \ against harmful witch hexes. The duration of any beneficial hexes longer than\
  \ 1 round that affect an almiraj is increased by 50%.</p> \n      <p><b>Magic Horn\
  \ (Su)</b> While on the creature's head, an almiraj's horn is treated as a +1 weapon.\
  \ Any living creature slain by an almiraj's gore attack immediately turns to stone\
  \ (as if by the flesh to stone spell, with no saving throw, and the creature is\
  \ still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its former magic, and counts\
  \ as a masterwork weapon if used to create a magical dagger or similar small piercing\
  \ weapon.</p> \n      <p>The almiraj is a surprisingly dangerous predator. Almirajes'\
  \ strong affinity with witches, magical gore attacks, and susceptibility to hexes\
  \ suggest they have arcane origins, perhaps the result of experiments by witches\
  \ seeking to deliberately create a new kind of familiar.</p> \n      <p>Reminiscent\
  \ of a unicorn horn, an almiraj's most prominent feature serves as both a deterrent\
  \ and deadly weapon. The almiraj uses its horn to hunt, stalking and spearing prey\
  \ on the brutal appendage. The horn's unique magical properties have the gruesome\
  \ side effect of forcing the almiraj to consume its prey while it still lives, before\
  \ it turns to stone—when hunting smaller creatures, the almiraj strikes to slow\
  \ its prey through blood loss and to disable it by maiming its limbs. Occasionally,\
  \ an enterprising individual will hunt an almiraj for its horn, but success is limited\
  \ since almirajes are exceptionally vicious, stealthy, and athletic targets—their\
  \ acrobatic leaps bring their horns within reach of the vital organs of much larger\
  \ creatures.</p> \n      <p>Almirajes are fiercely territorial, although they flee\
  \ if unable to fight on their terms, only to return later to defend their territory.\
  \ They demonstrate their territorial claims to others of their kind with acrobatic\
  \ displays and mock horn battles rather than fighting in earnest. Other intruders\
  \ are met with aggressive posturing and warning calls, though almirajes prefer not\
  \ to fight. If an interloper refuses to withdraw, however, the almiraj will fight\
  \ to the death to defend its claim.</p> \n      <p>It's unclear how almirajes reproduce,\
  \ since females are rare and the creatures are always encountered alone. Records\
  \ indicate that they live for 40 to 60 years and some communities are able to build\
  \ respectful, if wary, relationships with them.</p> \n      <p>Almirajes are particularly\
  \ popular with witches as familiars. Spellcasters of any alignment with the Improved\
  \ Familiar feat can gain an almiraj as a familiar at 5th level.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>\"But, Emperor Aslan,\" some might say, \"I don't remember you having\
  \ a horn... or bloodstained fur.\" To these people, I say: just wait to see what\
  \ happens if my carrot supply ever dries up. In the meantime, I encourage you all\
  \ to take an almiraj as your familiar and see what bunnies can really do.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Until next time, my minions.</p> \n     <p>Aslan\L<br> <i>Emperor of Livingroom\L\
  </i><br> <i>Nibbler of Dragons</i>\L<br> <i>Lord and Master of all He Surveys</i></p>\
