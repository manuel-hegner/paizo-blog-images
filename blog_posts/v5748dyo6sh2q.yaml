  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Seelah took a moment to\
  \ run a mental checklist before leaving the last place of cover. The sun was high,\
  \ brightly keeping shadows at bay and ensuring she had clear lines of sight. It\
  \ also ensured that as soon as she stepped into the courtyard, she would be spotted.\
  \ Stealth was not her area of expertise in any case. She would need different tactics\
  \ to overcome her foes, and she hoped she had planned well enough. If she had not,\
  \ the consequences would be dire.</p> \n     <p>There were two of them pacing in\
  \ the rubble, hulking things of fur, horn, and claw. Their mere appearance was not\
  \ so much different from beasts or giants, but even if she had not recognized them\
  \ from her studies—ceustodaemons, extraplanar guardians set to keep any from reclaiming\
  \ this place—the malevolent sensation that churned her stomach would have told her\
  \ they were not of the material world.</p> \n     <p>Her eyes scanned the broken\
  \ courtyard one last time. This had been a training ground once, before icons of\
  \ death and despair had been carved into the rocks and the walls had been painted\
  \ with obscenities. Once, nearby common folk would have come here for basic instruction\
  \ in defense and young warriors of Iomedae would have tested themselves to see if\
  \ they were ready to carry her ideals into a dangerous world.</p> \n     <p>Now,\
  \ Seelah would face a very different kind of test.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic!</a></p> \n     </div> \n     <p>After a quick prayer\
  \ for guidance, she strode toward the two monstrosities, shield up, sword drawn.\
  \ They saw her immediately, of course. She had not planned to strike from surprise,\
  \ nor to attack without giving them an opportunity to avoid conflict. She couldn’\
  t imagine a circumstance that would make these creatures anything but her implacable\
  \ enemies, but she still could not simply slay them without confirming they posed\
  \ a threat.</p> \n     <p>“You are on once consecrated ground.” Her voice was firm,\
  \ even. “And I shall see it consecrated again!”</p> \n     <p>The twin daemons turned\
  \ and focused cruel attention upon her. She felt supernatural malice hammer her\
  \ mind like invisible sling stones, trying to turn her limbs leaden, but she focused\
  \ her thoughts through the immobilizing magic. Seeing her still moving and uncowed,\
  \ the daemons responded with angry roars and headlong rushes toward her. She was\
  \ hard pressed for a long second as they raged, clawed, and bit. Her armor weathered\
  \ their blows, her shield taking some of the impact as well. Seelah had prepared\
  \ for this and sensed no hint of the unexpected. She could bring her full force\
  \ against them. Literal avatars of violent death, there was no chance they would\
  \ ask for quarter.</p> \n     <p>Seelah moved to keep them from flanking her, flicking\
  \ her eyes quickly from her targets to her environment. It pained her to see what\
  \ had been done to the once beautiful columns and walls of the ruined temple, but\
  \ she did not turn her face from any corner where another foe might hide. The sacrilege\
  \ that had been carried out here was methodical, total, and nauseatingly creative.\
  \ She did not believe these daemons to be any more than guardians left behind to\
  \ ensure the vile vandalism was not undone. Some other intelligence had brought\
  \ the temple low.</p> \n     <p>Suddenly a well-placed blow dropped one daemon sooner\
  \ than she had expected, and the other leaped back from Seelah. She moved toward\
  \ it cautiously but at a quick stride.</p> \n     <p>“Perhaps we should negotiate.”\
  \ The creature’s voice was deep and gruff, as though mortal words hurt its throat,\
  \ and its tone betrayed any intention of diplomacy. The false overture was scarcely\
  \ out of its mouth when a gout of fire followed it. As the flames danced off her\
  \ magically warded armor, Seelah surged forward and drove her blade deep into the\
  \ daemon’s chest. The steel cut, the holy forces coursing through it cutting deeper\
  \ still. With a gurgling cry, the remaining daemon staggered back and fell, ichor\
  \ dripping from the wound.</p> \n     <p>“This wins you nothing!” The fiend’s growl\
  \ was more petulant than defiant. “You cannot hold this place. That which bound\
  \ us here shall see you begin to rebuild. Your dreamed-of monument to your lackluster\
  \ mortal of a godling will fall again before you finish gilding it. No accolades\
  \ will this win you from your light-thrall masters, no wealth or power will you\
  \ collect!” </p>\n     <p>Seeleh paused a moment, her enemy’s tar-like blood boiling\
  \ off her glowing blade. She disliked striking a fallen foe but there was, of course,\
  \ no chance of turning this thing from its path of evil. </p>\n     <p>“This place,”\
  \ Seelah indicated the open court with a jab of her chin, keeping eyes, sword, and\
  \ shield carefully oriented against any desperate last strike the monstrosity might\
  \ make, “is just a place. When my order lost it, we grieved, but more for the loss\
  \ of those within than for toppled stone. We rebuilt elsewhere. We still train the\
  \ willing, temper the faithful, and sharpen the keenest of Iomedae’s blades. If\
  \ we can rebuild this place after it is cleansed, we will. But that is not why I\
  \ am here.” </p>\n     <p>The daemon laughed once, a hard, humorless noise. </p>\n\
  \     <p>“Then you risk your life and rouse my anger of that which bound me for\
  \ even less than I thought. It has done this to a hundred places and will do it\
  \ to a hundred more. Vanquish us, and it shall return to do the same to you!” </p>\n\
  \     <p>At the last word the daemon lunged, claws slashing for Seelah’s armored\
  \ belly. Unsurprised, she caught the blow on her shield, felt the impact crack its\
  \ boards and bruise her arm. She smoothly thrust her longsword down and forward,\
  \ channeling the divine power her patron granted her through the blessed metal,\
  \ and felt it cut her foe’s fiendish malevolence as much as its hide and flesh.\
  \ It collapsed, stretched out on the ground, it’s black blood seeping into the stone.\
  \ </p>\n     <p>Seelah crouched, peering into its eyes. Was there some dim light\
  \ still there? Some glimmer of its daemonic spirit still clinging to its useless\
  \ physical form? If so, perhaps it could still hear her for a few moments more.\
  \ </p>\n     <p>“I did not come here because that which conjured you did this to\
  \ us. I came because, as you say, it may yet do the same to others. And when it\
  \ comes here to seek vengeance upon me?” The spark was definitely gone from the\
  \ daemon’s lifeless eyes. Seelah stood and looked at the hours of toil that would\
  \ be needed to make this an even vaguely defensible place once again. </p>\n   \
  \  <p>She smiled. </p>\n     <p>“When it comes? I will be ready.”</p> \n     <hr>\
