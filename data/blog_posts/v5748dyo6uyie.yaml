  \ was a traveling priest of Pharasma who wielded mystic powers. Keskodai carried\
  \ baby Chk Chk in a fortified cradle-jar when he left his home on Verces to visit\
  \ as many incredible worlds as possible—and experience even more incredible adventures.\
  \ One such adventure got a little too incredible, smashing open Chk Chk’s container\
  \ during an emergency landing. Fortunately, Chk Chk was safe, but Keskodai felt\
  \ the existential dread of losing his child and realized it was time to return home\
  \ and be with their loving throuple.</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table\

  \      <br>\n      <p>Keskodai’s adventures and beliefs had a profound impact on\
  \ the larval Chk Chk. As a child, the aesthetics and rituals of Pharasma’s faith\
  \ awed him. As he grew older, he practiced his father’s faith but felt a restless\
  \ yearning for something different (ironically, Chk Chk’s questioning mirrored his\
  \ father’s adolescent rebellion many years ago). As Chk Chk stood on the cusp of\
  \ self-discovery, the universe provided a brutal catalyst that would change his\
  \ life forever.</p>\n      <p>When Aucturn exploded, every telepath under the Fullbright**\
  \ sun suddenly lost control of their psychic projections. Every intrusive thought,\
  \ destructive impulse, and damning secret became public as a mysterious psychic\
  \ contagion spread. Chk Chk was sipping a cappuccino and shopping at the local market\
  \ when he heard the screams. People all around him–some of them friends and neighbors–\
  were screaming and venting their psychic stress or fighting each other with fists\
  \ and makeshift weapons.</p>\n      <p>Panicked, Chk Chk began a prayer to the Lady\
  \ of Graves but couldn’t recall the sacred words. Keskodai burst into the shop and\
  \ Chk Chk felt the psychic whiplash of doubt and fear pouring from his father’s\
  \ spirit. He felt Keskodai remember the pain of believing he’d lost his only child\
  \ in the crash-landing long ago mixed with his current dread at seeing their neighbors\
  \ wracked by fear and pain. Instead of resisting the intense feelings, Chk Chk embraced\
  \ the emotional hemorrhage. As the pain washed over him, he mentally composed a\
  \ poem. When someone tore the shop’s roof off, the harsh sun brought Chk Chk’s shadow\
  \ into harsh relief. His shadow changed and spread, growing into tendrils that protected\
  \ him and his father from the glaring sun. Chk Chk spoke another stanza, and soothing\
  \ shadowy arms wrapped around his panicking neighbors. Thanks to Chk Chk’s unconventional\
  \ prayer, the chaos calmed as quickly as it began.</p>\n      <p>That’s when Chk\
  \ Chk realized there’s more to the soul’s journey than life and death. Destruction\
  \ and creation, pain and healing, light and shadow–these dichotomies exist in every\
  \ spirit. Chk Chk stayed up night after night studying philosophy, listening to\
  \ music, and writing poetry in his sacred journal, driven to compose a pure expression\
  \ of the beauty of contradicting unity.</p>\n      <p>Chk Chk broke his social isolation\
  \ to join a group of artists he met at a nonstop café in Takoris. At first, Chk\
  \ Chk got a job as a barista so he could attend the meetings without attracting\
  \ attention. As he improved his skills at writing dark poetry and brewing dark roast\
  \ (both topped with colorful sprinkles), Chk Chk gradually became the spiritual\
  \ glue holding the group of misfit artists together. One night during a midnight\
  \ jam, the group had a religious experience, feeling a surge of bliss as Zon-Shelyn\
  \ Embraced them and their work. Zon-Shelyn called on Chk Chk to become their minister\
  \ by nurturing creativity and creating a safe space for artists to gather. The tiny\
  \ cafe was consecrated as one of Zon-Shelyn’s first temples (they still serve coffee),\
  \ but Chk Chk was inspired by the idea of ministering in a new place, feeling the\
  \ same wanderlust as his father before him.</p>\n      <p>With his father’s letter\
  \ of recommendation in one hand and his poetry journal in the other, Chk Chk got\
  \ an internship with the Starfinder Society at the busy Lorespire Complex. Being\
  \ on Absalom Station expanded his social horizons, too. He found a new coffee shop\
  \ to sling beans at, quickly meeting others who felt the Embrace of Zon-Shelyn.\
  \ He learned how to use a painglaive from a sculptor who creates impressive wood\
  \ carvings with the weapon.</p>\n      <p>Chk Chk met his best friend Dae at a pop-up\
  \ dance party in the Vesk Quarter. The pair bonded the first time they met. Dae’\
  s performance inspired Chk Chk to write a poem***. The poem didn’t do the dance\
  \ justice, so Chk Chk tore the page from his notebook and threw it away, but Dae\
  \ found the discarded poem, read it, and confronted its moody author. Now Chk Chk\
  \ always wears the friendship bracelet Dae gave him. Since meeting Dae, Chk Chk’\
  s opened up about sharing his art with others—you can read part of one of his poems\
  \ below!</p>\n      <p><br>\n       *Chk Chk only lets members of his mystic bond\
  \ call him Chkoresk, and usually prefers Chk Chk. After all, Chkoresk is the full\
  \ name his family used when discussing serious or unpleasant matters.<br><br>\n\
  \       **Fullbright is the scorching, rural desert region of the tidally locked\
  \ planet Verces. Chk Chk’s family lives in a shaded encampment in Fullbright.</p>\n\
  \      <p>***The following is a part of the poem Chk Chk wrote after dancing with\
  \ Dae.</p>\n      <p><em>A prismatic kaleidoscope burns the shadow patchwork wrapped\
  \ around my heart.</em></p>\n      <p><em>We are dancing lights that shine within\
  \ a cold and empty void, eternal.</em></p>\n      <p><em>Will your searing brilliance\
  \ chase away my shadows?</em></p>\n      <p><em>Or will your light be eclipsed by\
  \ my spirit’s umbral shroud?</em></p>\n      <p><em>Your warm silhouette reaches\
  \ for my neck,</em></p>\n      <p><em>Only to wipe away my bloody tears.</em></p>\n\
