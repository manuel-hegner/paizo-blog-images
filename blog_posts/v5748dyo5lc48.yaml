  \ An Interview with Ed Greenwood</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 22, 2011</p>\
  \ \n   <p>As we get closer to PaizoCon we'll be showcasing some interviews with\
  \ the various guests we'll have at the show. We kick off this series with an interview\
  \ with Ed Greenwood, one of the most influential people in the RPG industry.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We're incredibly honored to have Ed as our Guest of Honor at PaizoCon\
  \ 2011. I've been reading Ed's work since I was in Jr. High and reading about, and\
  \ playing in, the Realms since the grey box debuted in 1987 for 1st Edition. I can't\
  \ wait to hang out with Ed at PaizoCon this year and a lucky few PaizoCon guests\
  \ will get the chance to play in a game run by the \"Sage of Shadowdale\" himself,\
  \ so keep an eye out for the PaizoCon lottery coming soon.</p> \n   <p>And without\
  \ further ado, here's the interview with Ed!</p> \n   <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/EdGreenwood_180.jpeg\"\
  \ align=\"right\"> \n   <p><b>1. Could you tell us a little about yourself and how\
  \ you started in the industry?</b></p> \n   <p>I'm Canadian, was born and raised\
  \ in what is now Toronto. I have a degree in journalism but have always worked in\
  \ public libraries, from age 14 onwards (still working in a public library, and\
  \ I'm 51 now). I have always written fantasy, sf, and other fiction, and started\
  \ creating the Realms when I was 6 years old (8 years before D&amp;D was created,\
  \ and 9 years before the wider world saw it). I started reading <i>The Dragon</i>\
  \ (as it was then called) around issue #8, started writing for it in 1979 (an article\
  \ on the Divine Right game was my first submission, but wasn't published until issue\
  \ #34, after two of my D&amp;D monster creations had seen print: the Curst in #30,\
  \ and the Crawling Claw in #32). I happily buried the editors under submission after\
  \ submission, and as a result they soon named me a Contributing Editor; some years\
  \ later, when TSR was looking for a new campaign \"world\" for the game, they contacted\
  \ me and purchased the Realms. I have never been on staff at any game company, but\
  \ have written literally hundreds of novels and short stories, adventures, articles,\
  \ sourcebooks, and other game products over the years, for all sorts of game systems.\
  \ I still love creating stuff, and try to do something every day.</p> \n   <p><b>2.\
  \ When did you discover your creative talents?</b></p> \n   <p>I've written poetry\
  \ and lyrics for as long as I can remember (making up new words to songs I heard\
  \ sung around me when I was a toddler, apparently). As a kid of 3 years old and\
  \ for the next 6 years—apparently I was one of those \"child prodigies\"—I apparently\
  \ often pestered my father by excitedly bringing him various books I'd read in his\
  \ den and demanding to know \"what happened next.\" He often gravely told me that\
  \ the author was long dead, and if I wanted sequels I'd have to write them myself.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So I did. They were mostly dreadful, but I kept at it, and have written\
  \ or co-written around 140 books, thus far. I'm not sure how talented I am, but\
  \ I <i>am</i> persistent.</p> \n   <p><b>3. What inspires you?</b></p> \n   <p>Everything.\
  \ Everything at all. \"Life\" would be the flippant answer. Pretty sunsets and animals,\
  \ flirtatious repartee, real-life pratfalls and moments of cleverness, improbable\
  \ coincidences, rumors, smiles from strangers... you name it.</p> \n   <p><b>4.\
  \ How would you describe your style?</b></p> \n   <p>Chameleon 101. Though I like\
  \ humor and have a weakness for smart-mouthed first person narrators, I try to tailor\
  \ my style to the project at hand. I've written torrid romances and instruction\
  \ manuals, pastiches of many different writers, and adopted all sorts of styles.\
  \ In my game writing, I do try to build nuance, color, and \"tone\" into my writing\
  \ that constantly hints at things I don't have sufficient word count to come right\
  \ out and say. (Which no doubt drives some editors nuts.) So I don't have a distinctive\
  \ style (though I <i>do</i> have a fairly consistent \"voice\" for most of my Realms\
  \ fiction; contrast it with my <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial/v5748dyo5lbpf\"\
  >\"Guns of Alkenstar\" Pathfinder Tales story</a>).</p> \n   <p><b>5. Do you have\
  \ a favorite story or character?</b></p> \n   <p>No. I have literally dozens of\
  \ favorite stories and characters, which I'm afraid means I don't have lone, specific\
  \ \"favorites\" of either. Really.</p> \n   <p><b>6. Who are your favorite writers\
  \ and influences?</b></p> \n   <p>Hooboy! Here we go, knowing I'll inevitably miss\
  \ some...</p> \n   <p><b>Living</b>: Guy Gavriel Kay, Terry Pratchett, Spider Robinson,\
  \ Patricia McKillip, Robin McKinley, Jack Vance, Julian May, Ursula LeGuin, Dana\
  \ Stabenow, J. V. Jones</p> \n   <p><b>Dead</b>: Lord Dunsany, Rudyard Kipling,\
  \ P. G. Wodehouse, Roger Zelazny, Fritz Leiber, Leslie Charteris, E. E. \"Doc\"\
  \ Smith, John Dickson Carr, Ellis Peters, Clark Ashton Smith, J. R. R. Tolkien,\
  \ H. P. Lovecraft</p> \n   <p><b>7. How do you juggle freelance work and life?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>They're two separate things?</p> \n   <p>Seriously, writing/designing\
  \ <i>is</i> my life. It's why I breathe. I value friendship and camaraderie, books,\
  \ and creating (both alone and with friends). I live to do these things and enjoy\
  \ these things, and share them with those I love. (Which is, I suppose, a grand\
  \ way of saying I dream and make up lies for a living.)</p> \n   <p><b>8. Describe\
  \ yourself in 5 words.</b></p> \n   <p>Whimsical, jovial, kind, widely-interested.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>9. What's the best thing to happen to you recently?</b></p> \n   <p>I've\
  \ been able to help (in small ways) launch or better the careers of some friends\
  \ who are going to be <i>great</i> writers. We'll all get to read the results, in\
  \ years to come. No, I'm not going to name names. My reward will be the reading,\
  \ the hugs, and laughter together.</p> \n   <p><b>10. Any advice for aspiring writers?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Nothing strikingly original.</p> \n   <p>These, above all: Read, read,\
  \ read (widely, not just in your chosen field) and write, write, write (you can\
  \ and will improve your craft, the more you keep at it).</p> \n   <p>Take all writing\
  \ advice with a grain of salt, because everyone's slightly different, and what worked\
  \ for me or for Stephen King might not work for you. However, <i>pay attention</i>\
  \ to editors and guidelines and formats and the nitty-gritty of daily work, because\
  \ those who don't are often not heard from again.</p> \n   <p>And keep at it. Most\
  \ \"overnight successes\" have been years in the making. Don't tell me or anyone\
  \ about the book you're going to write—instead, save your time and breath and <i>sit\
  \ down and write it</i>. I'm a greedy reader; I want the fruits of your labors,\
  \ not the signal of your intent to one day undertake them.</p> \n   <p>Oh, and one\
  \ more thing: Don't tell me you don't have time to write your great novel or design\
  \ your new game. I have been writing professionally for 45 years (yes, I got <i>paid</i>\
  \ for some of the stuff I did when I was six), and during that time went through\
  \ school and university, held down a full-time job for more than twenty years (including\
  \ a dozen years of commuting 120 miles to work and 120 miles home, six days a week),\
  \ have worked part time for more than a decade when I wasn't full time... and \"\
  on the side\" have managed to write or co-write (and co-writing takes longer) about\
  \ 140 books (not to mention contributing to dozens more, and turning out hundreds\
  \ of articles and columns and newspaper stories, poems and a play and script or\
  \ three). So the \"I don't have time\" argument cuts little ice with me. I don't\
  \ expect you to produce 140 books—just impress me with one. To begin with. ;}</p>\
