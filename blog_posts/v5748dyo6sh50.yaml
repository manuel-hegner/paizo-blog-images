  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Rock rained near New Valor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>With a twist of the wheel, Zurkrishu maneuvered the hover tank out of\
  \ the largest boulder’s path before drifting back onto their collision course with\
  \ the colossal kyokor as Renz kept firing the main autocannon. “Stay with me, Renz,”\
  \ Zurkrishu admonished over her shoulder as Renz’s tracer rounds veered off target.\
  \ “We only got this one chance, yeah? Let’s do it for Daimalko!” Still hundreds\
  \ of feet off, the kyokor lunged toward another vehicle, snatching and crumpling\
  \ it in a single motion as its occupants rained haplessly back to the ground. As\
  \ Renz’s explosive shells hit home, the kyokor hurled the wreckage at their hover\
  \ tank, striking it straight on and flipping it end over end. </p> \n     <p>Time\
  \ slowed. Zurkrishu went flying, her hand outstretched toward Renz as she cried\
  \ out “Captain!”</p> \n     <p>Captain? In that frozen moment, Renz looked down\
  \ at their sleeve. No, they were a sergeant, weren’t they?</p> \n     <p>“Captain!”\
  </p> \n     <p>Something wasn’t right. The kyokor’s roar was fading into dull static\
  \ as Renz tumbled through the air.</p> \n     <p>“Captain?”</p> \n     <p>Renz blinked\
  \ awake. Their sheets were tangled like so much wreckage, and the only light came\
  \ from an unblinking featureless face projected on their wall monitor.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“Captain, there’s an incident,” Stilchee announced patiently. The embri’\
  s mask hid her emotions admirably, yet Renz could detect a hint of silent judgment.\
  \ “You’re needed on the bridge.”</p> \n     <p>“An incident?” Renz quipped while\
  \ rolling off their bed in a vain search for trousers. “If they’re fighting again,\
  \ just break ’em up.”</p> \n     <p>“I assure you, Flowers and Esh are on their\
  \ best behavior. I respect your non-Pact Standard sleep cycle enough not to disturb\
  \ you unless it’s important.” Stilchee paused before adding, “We have unexpected\
  \ company.”</p> \n     <p>Renz swore quietly all the way to the bridge, idly rubbing\
  \ the Daimalkan military insignia on their jacket. For decades, the Veskarium had\
  \ subjugated the planet Landahl and its peaceful illyr inhabitants, provoking a\
  \ guerrilla war that the illyrs were slowly losing. Not wanting to provoke another\
  \ Silent War, the Pact Worlds had stayed out of the unjust annexation, but sympathizers\
  \ with deep pockets still supplied the illyrs where they could. It was just such\
  \ a smuggling run that Renz had accepted, sneaking ordnance to the rebels.</p> \n\
  \     <p>As Renz arrived, Esh reflexively stood and saluted, the hobgoblin’s military\
  \ upbringing taking over before he sheepishly returned to his seat. The ghoran behind\
  \ him smirked before Esh chidingly swatted them, ruffling the ghoran’s fern-top\
  \ undercut. “All right, business time. What’s happening?” Renz demanded.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Stilchee maintained eye contact as she turned on the main viewscreen, displaying\
  \ a fleet of Veskarium warships.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  \ Toledo</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>“What the Hell’s with this welcoming party?”\
  \ Renz demanded. “All reports described light patrols, not a blockade!”</p> \n \
  \    <p>“Kinda wish we were being paid more for the run, huh Renz?” quipped Flowers,\
  \ their sarcasm belied by their nervously gripping the starship’s controls.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Hey, it’s a good cause, alright?” Renz shot back before looking to\
  \ his embri science officer. “Stilchee, our cover’s still in order, right?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Aye, captain.” The alien mollusk bobbed her mask as her claws tapped\
  \ away. “Our hold remains shielded, and our documentation still insists we’re shipping\
  \ scientific instruments and other supplies to the Obedurn Associates research colony,\
  \ a neutral entity. I worry more that their flagship has begun scanning us aggressively.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Your countermeasures holding up, though? Good.” Renz shook out their\
  \ shoulders, checked their mutton chops, and ran a hand through their hair. “Patch\
  \ me through to our new friends, and I’ll clear up this misunderstanding before\
  \ they dig too deep.”</p> \n     <p>Stilchee tapped away diligently as Flowers mockingly\
  \ mouthed “nu-nu-friends” and pantomimed a dancing skittermander to Esh in an attempt\
  \ at levity. The ghoran snapped back to the controls when the screen suddenly displayed\
  \ a massive Veskarian starship’s bridge filled with dozens of vesk officers. Before\
  \ them loomed their leader, a vesk in overplate armor, her fuchsia-and-green scales\
  \ bristling with confidence. “Attend, and identify yourself,” she boomed, her vesk\
  \ second-in-command stepping into view at her side.</p> \n     <p>“Glory to you.”\
  \ Renz inclined their head slightly in respect. “I am Renz, captain of the <i>Zurkrishin</i>.\
  \ We’re bound for Landahl carrying food, clothing, and scientific instruments for\
  \ Obedurn Associates. What earns us this welcome?”</p> \n     <p>“You stand before\
  \ Wing Commander Tolskamash of the Army of the Veskarium, Thrice-Tested Conqueror\
  \ of Persam-6 and commanding officer of the <i>Scorchrazor</i>. I trust you understand\
  \ commerce to Landahl is tightly restricted?” </p>\n     <p>“Absolutely, wing commander.”\
  \ Renz briefly glanced to Stilchee, who pointed insistently to her station’s display,\
  \ indicating multiple ships were now scanning the <i>Zurkrishin</i>.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Yet even so, you traffic in the name of rebel sympathizers?”</p> \n     <p>Renz\
  \ stared back in disbelief. “Sympathizers, wing commander?”</p> \n     <p>The vesk’\
  s first officer responded. “Sympathizers,” he intoned grimly. “They recently declared\
  \ their support for the illyr resistance. Those who serve them are in violation\
  \ of Veskarium law. Violators are to be eliminated with prejudice,” he added with\
  \ a hungry grin.</p> \n     <p>“The Veskarium’s justice is not so cruel, sub-commander,”\
  \ Tolskamash remarked calmly to her second without breaking her predatory menace.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Then no doubt the captain would welcome a boarding party to search\
  \ his starship,” amended the first officer.</p> \n     <p>“They/them, thank you!”\
  \ snapped Flowers from the pilot’s chair, interrupting the vesk’s interrogation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“They/Th—?” Wing Commander Tolskamash blinked, quirked her head, and\
  \ studied Renz before straightening and raking three claws over her breastplate\
  \ in display of the god Damoritosh’s doshko blade, nudging her second to do the\
  \ same. “My subordinate and I were mistaken and meant no disrespect,” she apologized\
  \ while struggling to regain her earlier momentum. “The captain, ah, they would\
  \ certainly—\"</p> \n     <p>“It’s an honest mistake, please,” Renz interrupted\
  \ with a casual wave before adding, “But I believe it’s not the only honest mistake\
  \ at hand—we’re simple teamsters given bad information. My crew will send you our\
  \ manifest imminently, and we can forget about these misunderstandings. Hold, please.”\
  \ Stilchee cut the transmission as the off-balance vesk struggled to respond.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Renz furiously scratched their mutton chops before Flowers began another\
  \ round of gallows humor. “Hey, hey!” Renz snapped. “News doesn’t travel any faster\
  \ through the Drift than we do, okay? It’s just bad timing. We can talk our way\
  \ out.”</p> \n     <p>“We don’t have long to talk, captain,” Stilchee reported,\
  \ pointing to her screens. Alerts silently popped up every few seconds, signaling\
  \ that each of the vesk ships was scanning them. Their cover was slipping as surely\
  \ as Stilchee’s masked emotions, and Renz could hear the restrained fear building\
  \ in her voice as she more quietly counseled: “Just because you named the ship after\
  \ a colossus hunter doesn’t mean it can take on that many goliaths.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“That, ah, might not be true,” countered Esh, pantomiming finger-guns to emphasize\
  \ his point. “At this rate, they won’t just find our illyr shipments.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Renz scowled. “And why would our starship’s basic armaments upset the vesk?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“What are a few lasers between friends?” The hobgoblin flicked at\
  \ his own screens and added, “But when we were doing maintenance last, I gave our\
  \ systems a little, ah, upgrade that might spook their sensors.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Like what?”</p> \n     <p>Esh’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Little something we\
  \ called ‘Gideron Gold’ back in the home system.”</p> \n     <p>“Gider—\" Flowers\
  \ visibly wilted. “We’re packing nukes?!?”</p> \n     <p>“Hey, you de-stress with\
  \ spa days, I de-stress by knowing we’re packing real heat!”</p> \n     <p>“Damn,\
  \ you Authority types don’t mess around.” Flowers cracked their knuckles. “That\
  \ changes the odds just a little.”</p> \n     <p>Esh gave the ghoran a playful shove,\
  \ “Well look who bloomed and grew some stamens!”</p> \n     <p>“Irrelevant!” Stilchee\
  \ chided while furiously reconfiguring their starship’s signatures to foil the vesk\
  \ scanners. “Captain, we have perhaps a few minutes before they see through our\
  \ cover. We need a plan.”</p> \n     <p>Renz quickly reviewed the armament specs\
  \ before responding. “Typically vesk. This isn’t a patrol fleet, but one designed\
  \ to make an example, just like they’re doing to the illyrs. Whether we let them\
  \ on board or just wait long enough for them to scan us, they’re going to learn\
  \ just how much ordnance we’re packing.” They glowered out the window while idly\
  \ rubbing their jacket’s insignia. “But when it comes to dealing with colossi, I\
  \ like to think there’s an Option 3.”</p> \n     <p>The embri deflated slightly.\
  \ “By your tone, captain, I’m sensing that last option is not ‘retreat?’”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“You can bet your best mask it ain’t,” Renz declared dangerously. “Didn’\
  t you hear me earlier? I promised the good wing commander a full inventory—and that\
  \ means declaring every rocket, bullet, and beam we’re packing.”</p> \n     <p>Esh\
  \ cackled and rubbed his hands in anticipation before turning to the starship’s\
  \ targeting computers. “Permission to send those scaleys the first line item?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Renz nodded. “Shields up, Stilchee. Flowers, take the first opening\
  \ through this blockade. Esh, light ’em up with whatever you’ve been bragging about.\
  \ We’ve only got this one shot, yeah?” they encouraged, tapping the Daimalkan insignia\
  \ once more, their face briefly lit by the saffron glow of Esh’s torpedoes silently\
  \ screaming toward their targets. “This time, we do it for Landahl.”</p> \n    </blockquote>\
