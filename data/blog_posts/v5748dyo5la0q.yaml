  \ Yetisburg Address</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 22, 2008</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>A few appropriate remarks, spoken by President Abraham Lincoln, November\
  \ 19, 1863, after a two-hour fusillade of yowling by the Right Abominable Statesman,\
  \ Senator Everett OrYARRadoogOOch'ook!ook!:</i></p> \n    <p>Four score and seven\
  \ yetis ago, our fathers discovered on the northern fringes of this continent <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x6\">a new breed of soldier</a>, conceived in the Belly\
  \ of Hell, and dedicated to the proposition that not only men are created equal.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now we are engaged in a rarely civil war, testing whether those yetis,\
  \ or any yetis, so ill-conceived and so odiferous, can long be endured. We are met\
  \ on a great charnel house of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that\
  \ field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that those\
  \ yetis might be once again returned to Canada. It is altogether fitting and proper\
  \ that we should do this, for they do us no good at all here.</p> \n    <p>But,\
  \ in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not even find—\
  this ground. The brave yetis, living and dead, who struggled here, have pretty much\
  \ torn it to ribbons, far above our poor power to reconstruct. The yetis will little\
  \ note, nor long remember what we say here, as they have the attention span of a\
  \ chamberpot. It is for us the humans, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished\
  \ collection of random soldiers' body parts, which they who fought here have gnawed\
  \ down to the bone. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining\
  \ before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause\
  \ for which they ran screaming from the field, those that could walk, anyway—that\
  \ we here highly resolve that these dead should not have died in pain, oh such horrible\
  \ pain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new resolve to solve its own damn\
  \ problems—and that government of the people, by the people, and specifically <i>only</i>\
  \ for the people, shall not rest until every last man-ape is driven from its shores.\
  \ Really, what in thunderation were we thinking?</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
