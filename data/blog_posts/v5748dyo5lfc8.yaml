  >As Vencarlo Orisini led Orkatto's men on a noisy chase, I strolled out the front\
  \ doors with my \"bodyguard.\" In the darkened museum, and without his mask and\
  \ cloak, which I carried folded under my arm, Master Raneiro did somewhat resemble\
  \ the younger man who had accompanied me into the museum. I placed my hope in the\
  \ bravo's topknot and the noisy diversion behind us.</span></p> \n     <p>The guards\
  \ at the doors bowed the moment they saw me, sparing the man at my side not so much\
  \ as a glance.</p> \n     <p>Raneiro faltered, drawing the guards' attention as\
  \ his foot dragged across the gravel. I took him by the arm and stage whispered,\
  \ \"You need only taste my wine, you fool, not guzzle it!\"</p> \n     <p>A chuckle\
  \ from the guards assured me of the ploy's success. </p> \n     <p>My footman held\
  \ the door open, and to his credit he did not so much as raise an eyebrow as I helped\
  \ my \"bodyguard\" into the carriage before joining him. I rapped upon the roof,\
  \ and the driver slapped the reins.</p> \n     <p>\"If they seize Vencarlo...\"\
  \ Raneiro wheezed. The paralysis was taking hold. I knew its effects all too well.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And I knew there was no cure.</p> \n     <p>\"I will intercede on his\
  \ behalf,\" I said, knowing it was an empty promise. His pursuers had no intention\
  \ of taking Blackjack or any imposter alive. </p> \n     <p>I opened the rear portal\
  \ and peered back at the museum entrance. His exhausted men at his side, an exasperated\
  \ Orkatto questioned the door guards, who pointed in our direction. The cowled figure\
  \ who had poisoned Raneiro emerged to stand by his side. </p> \n     <p>\"Turn here,\"\
  \ I told the driver.</p> \n     <p>\"Let me out,\" said Raneiro.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  No, my men will take you somewhere quiet.\" I drew his cloak around my shoulders\
  \ and unfolded his black mask. Looking down at its limp form in my hands, I felt\
  \ as though I were looking at the face of a corpse. I pulled it across my face and\
  \ raised the cloak's hood up to conceal my half-human ears. \"I will draw them off.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>I stepped out of the carriage door to stand upon the running board.\
  \ After I gave my servants their instructions, Raneiro called my name. With the\
  \ last of his strength, he lifted his rapier toward me. </p> \n     <p>I still had\
  \ Vencarlo Orsini's blade at my side. \"No, Master Raneiro. I am not worthy of such\
  \ an—\"</p> \n     <p>\"Of course you aren't,\" he rasped. \"Give it to the boy.\"\
  </p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Blackjack.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n      <br>Blackjack is more than a single man. He’s an idea.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Our gazes locked for a long instant. I took the blade and leaped from\
  \ the carriage.</p> \n     <p>With a quick calculation of where our pursuers would\
  \ appear, I dashed toward a lighted intersection. Knowing precisely where the Korvosan\
  \ Guard was stationed throughout the city, I plotted an escape route while waiting\
  \ for Orkatto's men to arrive. They found me moments later, standing in silhouette\
  \ before a street lamp.</p> \n     <p>Mimicking Vencarlo's disguised voice as best\
  \ I could, I cried out, \"Did you fools truly think you could capture Blackjack,\
  \ the people's hero?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Kill him!\" screeched Orkatto. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>His hired guards ran toward me, but his assassin lingered at his side, staring\
  \ at me. I spared only an instant before fleeing, but I noticed that cowled figure\
  \ running to the side, in the direction I'd chosen for my true escape.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>My diversion was proving more difficult to execute than to plan.</p> \n \
  \    <p>I fled as fleetly as I could, revealing myself only when I had extended\
  \ my lead by another ten or twenty yards. Twice I failed to put myself in front\
  \ of a revealing streetlight and resorted to Vencarlo's bombastic taunts. \"Over\
  \ here, you fools!\"</p> \n     <p>The expression on their faces delighted me, even\
  \ as the fear of discovery sent a cold thrill through my veins.</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ hippogriff's scream alerted me to the threat I had forgotten. Captain Ornelos\
  \ and his Sable Company still patrolled the skies, and one of them must have heard\
  \ the alarum from Orkatto's men. A winged shadow crossed the street before me. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Standing on the other side was the cowled assassin who had slain Raneiro.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The killer moved toward me with uncanny grace, the chain-dart swinging\
  \ in an accelerating circle.</p> \n     <p>Debating between defense and flight,\
  \ I hesitated only long enough to catch a distinctive perfume.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You jump at shadows, buffoons!\" Vencarlo's adopted Blackjack voice—already becoming\
  \ more natural with practice—boomed down from a rooftop. \"Look for me in the clouds!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>With a laugh, he ran across the roof and vaulted over the peak. Moments\
  \ later, a hippogriff wheeled above us and flew after him.</p> \n     <p>The assassin\
  \ hesitated, glancing between me and the other Blackjack. Turning, the killer abandoned\
  \ me to chase Vencarlo.</p> \n     <p>Undeterred, Orkatto's guards ran after me.\
  \ They were, as Blackjack named them, fools and buffoons. It was child's play to\
  \ mislead them into dead-end alleys and taunt them from two streets away.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I worried more for Vencarlo, whose pursuers were far cleverer and more\
  \ deadly. A few times I dared reveal myself in hopes of drawing them off, but they\
  \ knew me for an imposter. They chased the true Blackjack, while I slunk back to\
  \ my lodgings to prepare my lies for the morrow.</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Two days later, we buried Master Raneiro beneath one of the\
  \ Arcadian oaks I had delivered to Queen Domina. By quiet agreement, his students\
  \ spread word across the city that the celebrated fencing master had finally succumbed\
  \ to his affection for the grape. Over six dozen of his former pupils came to pay\
  \ their respects. Vencarlo stood among the youngest, while I stood beside my aged\
  \ cohorts.</p> \n     <p> My former bodyguard and I did not speak at the funeral,\
  \ but our eyes arranged a meeting. After the final words were uttered, my agent\
  \ announced that Raneiro had bequeathed the last of his wine to his students on\
  \ the condition that they drink it all in his favorite wine houses before the following\
  \ dawn. </p> \n     <p>By previous arrangement, Vencarlo and I met at a little wine\
  \ house in Old Korvosa, the one not mentioned to the other students.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>We drained the first goblet and filled the second before speaking.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Captain Ornelos questioned me at length yesterday,\" I said. \"I told\
  \ him you stood guard at my lodgings all night after we withdrew from the museum.\
  \ Eventually, he believed me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I hear he looks quite dashing with\
  \ his new eyepatch.\"</p> \n     <p>\"He will not forgive you that injury.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Vencarlo lifted his hands and shrugged. \"It was difficult enough eluding\
  \ the Korvosan Guard. I could be only so gentle when your friend joined me on the\
  \ rooftops. You'll note that I left him the other eye when I could have taken both.\
  \ I could have as easily slain him.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It is better that you did\
  \ not.\" For the most part, I believed that to be true, but I feared one day the\
  \ captain would have his revenge, and the legend of Blackjack would come to an end.\
  \ \"Have you done what you promised?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I've made peace with my father.\
  \ I'll return to study at the Orisini Academy.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Have you done\
  \ as you promised?\"</p> \n     <p>\"In gratitude for my recent gifts, Her Majesty\
  \ cleared the way for me to purchase the remaining properties Gaspare Orkatto sought.\
  \ The residents of South Shore will not be driven from their homes.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p> \"Good.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I am more concerned about your keeping your other\
  \ promise. I am informed the Lady Seraphina was the victim of another burglary last\
  \ night.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo frowned. \"Not ‘another.' She had never been robbed\
  \ before. She only pretended so to draw suspicion from herself, while all along\
  \ she conspired with Orkatto to murder Blackjack and remove the last protection\
  \ of the people of South Shore.\"</p> \n     <p>\"The rumors say there was a fire\
  \ in her father's estate. Was that truly necessary?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I found the\
  \ flowers you described, and the poisonous weeds that grew upon them. Yes, I think\
  \ the fire was necessary.\"</p> \n     <p>I could not fault his action, no matter\
  \ how much it rankled me to know a commoner had committed burglary and arson in\
  \ the home of a peer. Considering the circumstances, I remained more inclined to\
  \ caution than to chastise him. \"She saw through my disguise, and doubtless through\
  \ yours as well. You have a dangerous enemy in that one.\"</p> \n     <p>\"More\
  \ dangerous than lord Orkatto or Captain Ornelos?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Far more, I\
  \ suspect. She cannot inform Ornelos or the Korvosan Guard of your robbery without\
  \ exposing her own dual nature, but she will not hesitate to use them against you.\
  \ What was it you said? ‘A beautiful woman commands all men.'\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Not this one,\" he said with bitterness. \"Not anymore. Anyway, did you know that\
  \ just one of her rubies will feed ten families for a year?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I\
  \ will pretend I did not hear that.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo smiled and drank and\
  \ stared through the wall, savoring his first act as the local hero.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>I placed Raneiro's sword upon the table. \"He wanted you to have this, along\
  \ with the rest.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo restrained his proud smile, but only barely.\
  \ \"It took two of us to imitate him,\" he said. \"Perhaps we could—\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"No. I am a lord of Cheliax. It is my duty to uphold the law.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Even when the law is unjust?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It is my duty,\" I said.\
  \ \"Not always my preference.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo leaned across the table.\
  \ \"After what we did, you are as much an outlaw as Blackjack. We both are. Let's\
  \ both take up his mask, you from the tower, I from the street. We could—\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"No,\" I said. \"Tomorrow I return to Egorian. I will keep your secret.\
  \ I can do no more than that. When next you run afoul of Captain Ornelos, Lord Orkatto,\
  \ or—Desna spare you—Lady Seraphina, you cannot turn to me for help.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>A sneer flickered across Vencarlo's fierce smile, and then both faded into\
  \ a grim line. \"You high-born lords can never understand what it is for the common\
  \ folk to live under your cruel caprice.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You are correct,\" I\
  \ said, knowing he was utterly wrong but unwilling to explain why. Just as the common\
  \ are subject to the noble, so are the noble subject to the royal, and the royal\
  \ to the infernal. \"But as you have seen, one man can avert that caprice. If only\
  \ for a while, and only for a few.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo refilled our goblets\
  \ and raised his in a toast. \"To Master Raneiro.\"</p> \n     <p>I held my cup\
  \ to his. \"To Blackjack.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A sample chapter\
