  \ <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 10, 2009</p> \n   <p>At <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\"\
  >Planet Stories</a>, we're all about recovering cherished pieces of SF's past; treasures\
  \ that have fallen between the cracks and been forgotten by modern readers, despite\
  \ their merit and importance to the genre. But one of the problems with history\
  \ is that it happened in the past... and the past is rarely clean. In order to unearth\
  \ the gems, you have to dig up some serious dirt. So let's get messy.</p> \n   <p>Let's\
  \ talk about racism.</p> \n   <p>One of the issues we've run up against time and\
  \ again with <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\">Planet Stories</a>, especially\
  \ with stories from back in the 1930s, is the use of racist language and ideas.\
  \ Even beyond the standard prejudicial themes and cliches of the day—the fact that\
  \ the \"advanced\" races were <i>always</i> white, and all the dark-skinned characters\
  \ were described by their bright white teeth (seriously, try finding one where that\
  \ isn't mentioned)—pulp writers were fascinated by the issue of race. Remember,\
  \ this is decades before the Civil Rights Movement, a time when the oldest readers\
  \ might still remember legalized slavery.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/search?q=otis+adelbert+kline&amp;what=all\"\
  >Otis Adelbert Kline</a> was no different. Both of his novels published by Planet\
  \ Stories, <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\">The Swordsman of Mars</a></i>\
  \ and the newly available <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x8\"> Outlaws of\
  \ Mars</a></i>, deal extensively with the issue of race, and for <i>Outlaws</i>,\
  \ the entire plot depends on it: a planetary race riot between the white-skinned\
  \ rulers, their dark servitors, and the menacing yellow men from another world.\
  \ The patois of Dr. Morgan's faithful African-American servant, Plato, is also likely\
  \ to make the unsuspecting modern reader cringe—for in this blatant (if sympathetic)\
  \ caricature, Kline paints a picture of a past most Americans would like to forget.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yet, as Joe Lansdale points out in his introduction, you can't hold these\
  \ stories to modern standards of political correctness—and in fact to do so would\
  \ be a disservice to the author. In his words: </p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Kline's\
  \ work is of its time. Non-white races suffer under his hand, though Plato, the\
  \ black servant of Dr. Morgan, is treated kindly enough, if in an unintentionally\
  \ condescending way. Still, Kline, like Burroughs, would have probably been considered\
  \ liberal in their times. They could at least appreciate the fact that someone of\
  \ a different color could be brave and loyal and worthy of the mantle of humanity.\
  \ Even Jack London had problems with that, and no doubt he is a more celebrated\
  \ author.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>\"Worthy of the mantle of humanity.\" A\
  \ phrase so obvious to most of us today that it seems offensive, yet Joe is absolutely\
  \ right. At the time, belief in racial equality was a bold position in the States.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Which is why at <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\">Planet Stories</a>,\
  \ we feel that it's important to give you the <i>whole</i> manuscripts, unabridged\
  \ and unabashed. In the past, publishers uncomfortable with content sometimes cut\
  \ drastically from older books (especially Kline) in order to sanitize for their\
  \ new era. We say: let the works stand on their own and speak for themselves. H.\
  \ P. Lovecraft used the N-word. Robert E. Howard had some (today) scandalously negative\
  \ portrayals of non-white races. Yet this is history, and to redact history is to\
  \ lose a vital part of how we got to where we are.</p> \n   <p>In 2009, with the\
  \ United States' first black president in office, I can read these books and separate\
  \ the prejudices of the time from the stories themselves, and I have faith that\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\">Planet Stories</a> readers will do the\
  \ same. If anything, I think these books are all the more significant for their\
  \ transgressions—a glimpse, not just of science fiction's history, but America's\
  \ past as a whole.</p> \n   <p> James Sutter<br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
