  >As we move into the last two months of 2012, the editorial staff is hard at work\
  \ on the playtest for next year’s <i>Mythic Adventures</i>, the warehouse staff\
  \ is eagerly awaiting the arrival of our big winter hardcover, the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"\
  ><i>NPC Codex</i></a>, and the web team is cranking away at the exciting new <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldzj\">Paizo Game Space</a> virtual tabletop. Everyone\
  \ has smiles on their face as they complete major tasks for 2012 and as they begin\
  \ to think about what’s coming in 2013.</span></p> \n    <p>The management and finance\
  \ teams, in the meantime, are hard at work finalizing 2013’s budget. This multi-month\
  \ process involves solidifying the editorial schedule for the year, making go or\
  \ no-go decisions on marketing programs, new employee hires, and everything else\
  \ with a cost associated with it. While we always remain open to new opportunities\
  \ on short deadlines, when the budget for a year closes, you end up with a good\
  \ snapshot of every product, employee, convention, or other initiative we plan to\
  \ do in the year. It’s a time when things get locked in, and when decisions can\
  \ no longer be put off into the future.</p> \n    <p>As a result, it’s the best\
  \ time to make important changes to Paizo’s product lines and general strategy.\
  \ Since we’re about to put the lid on the 2012 budget, I wanted to take some time\
  \ here in the Paizo Blog to speak with my “publisher voice” and let you in on a\
  \ few important developments that are scheduled to hit in 2013.</p> \n    <h2>Branding\
  \ Changes for GameMastery</h2> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121102-FlipMat.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20121102-FlipMat_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121102-MapPack.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20121102-MapPack_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Paizo’s line of GameMastery accessories\
  \ dates back to the time before Pathfinder, when we were a magazine publisher just\
  \ dipping our toes into the RPG game publishing field for the first time. The maps\
  \ and card products released under the GameMastery line were designed to work with\
  \ any fantasy RPG, and we wanted a name for the line that suggested the widest appeal\
  \ to the widest number of customers, regardless of what system they played. Since\
  \ its launch, we’ve released more than 100 Map Packs and Flip-Mats, and dozens of\
  \ Item Cards, Face Cards, and other card-based accessories to help you run your\
  \ campaigns.</p> \n    <p>Card and map subscriptions are at an all-time high, and\
  \ the design department keeps finding ways to make each release improve upon those\
  \ that came before it. We have plenty of terrain types, dungeon maps, and other\
  \ settings yet to go, and if anything the rate of card sets will increase in the\
  \ future. We now plan to produce a set of Item Cards and Face Cards for every Adventure\
  \ Path we publish, with additional rules-oriented releases similar to Chase Cards,\
  \ Condition Cards, and the Critical Hit deck in development as I write this.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As time has gone on, and as the Pathfinder RPG has become not just a\
  \ dominant brand here at the Paizo offices but also in the game industry in general,\
  \ more and more of our GameMastery accessory releases have started to tie into Pathfinder\
  \ adventures or the Pathfinder rules themselves. As a result, we’ve decided to retire\
  \ the GameMastery brand, and beginning in February of next year, GameMastery Map\
  \ Packs, Flip-Mats, and Card releases will come out under the Pathfinder brand.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This change allows us to reexamine how we package our maps, and gives\
  \ us the chance to improve them to make using the products easier. For Flip-Mats\
  \ this means packaging the maps with a wrap-around cover similar to the one used\
  \ for our Pathfinder GM Screen, which gives us more space to preview what the maps\
  \ look like, highlight key features, and (really importantly) to allow customers\
  \ (and retailers) to shelve their maps “spine out” for easier sorting. Map Packs\
  \ will feature a similar packaging metamorphosis, and will now come in a small box\
  \ for easier storage and display.</p> \n    <p>Many (even most) of Pathfinder Map\
  \ Pack, Flip-Mat, and Card releases will still be “rules agnostic” and suitable\
  \ for use with a variety of systems, but the truth is that the Pathfinder brand\
  \ has a cachet with buyers, distributors, and customers that GameMastery does not,\
  \ and this change will allow us to get our products into a wider network of stores.\
  \ When they make it into those stores, they’ll also be shelved with other Pathfinder\
  \ products, making it easier than ever for Paizo fans to find what they’re looking\
  \ for.</p> \n    <h2>Pricing Changes</h2> \n    <p>A close look at our budgets has\
  \ convinced us that we need to make some price changes on some of our product lines\
  \ to keep up with rising production costs. Starting in February 2013, Pathfinder\
  \ Map Packs and Pathfinder Flip-Mats will rise in price from $12.99 to $13.99.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Also starting in February, the monthly Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes,\
  \ which have held steady in price for 66 consecutive volumes, will increase to $22.99\
  \ (subscribers will pay the new discounted price of $15.99, plus their other subscription\
  \ benefits like the <a href=\"/products/btpy7xpn\">Pathfinder Advantage</a> discount\
  \ and free PDFs). Additionally, the monthly Pathfinder Player Companion line will\
  \ shift from $10.99 to $12.99.</p> \n    <p>This is the first time we have ever\
  \ raised prices on the Adventure Path, and we agonized over the decision. In truth,\
  \ we probably should have raised the price a few years back when the cost of paper\
  \ and printing increased with inflation and increased global demand at the end of\
  \ 2008, but we wanted to hold the line as long as possible. We must do it now to\
  \ keep the high standard of quality we publish each month, and we hope that you’\
  ll find the few extra bucks well worth the investment.</p> \n    <p>Keep your eyes\
  \ on the Paizo Blog for more updates about upcoming products and exciting new releases\
  \ for 2013. It promises to be a huge year for Paizo and the Pathfinder RPG, and\
  \ we can’t wait to share some of our exciting plans with you.</p> \n    <p>Your\
  \ support has been integral to the Paizo story these last 10 years, and we look\
  \ forward to sharing the next 10 years with you!</p> \n    <p>Sincerely,</p> \n\
