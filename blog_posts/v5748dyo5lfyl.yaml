  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">When it comes to creating characters,\
  \ I think we all have at least one stereotype, habit, or guilty pleasure that we\
  \ fall back on. Perhaps you love playing two-handed melee bruisers, or maybe you\
  \ can't stop designing oracles. I've known my share of folks who would repeatedly\
  \ build idealized versions of themselves as well as those who are hard-pressed to\
  \ leave the house with an Armor Class below 20 at 1st-level.</span></p> \n    <p>Me?\
  \ I can't stop creating characters that masquerade as a member of another class.\
  \ Whether its a druid nearly indistinguishable from a bard, a witch who tries to\
  \ be a cleric, or an inquisitor that claims to be a ninja, something about characters\
  \ that pretend to be something else scratches an essential design itch of mine.\
  \ A recent messageboard post reminded me of one of my favorite classes to emulate:\
  \ the paladin. The player in question had a \"paladin\" of Yaezhing—in truth an\
  \ oracle of the brutally evil deity—which gave me considerable amusement.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I've run across several such non-paladins. One was a \"paladin\" of Cayden\
  \ Cailean, complete with a scimitar he ignorantly referred to as a rapier, as well\
  \ as a \"smite sobriety\" class feature. While under its effects, the \"paladin\"\
  \ would undergo a major change in accent and personality, after which he remembered\
  \ nothing. Of course, on his character sheet he is a bard with the archaeologist\
  \ archetype (and \"smite sobriety\" is simply archaeologist's luck renamed), who\
  \ chose spells like remove fear and cure light wounds to further his character concept.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The other \"paladin\" is one I had a hand in creating, for my Razmiri\
  \ priest is always on the lookout for converts. Having convinced another player's\
  \ samurai that Razmir is a god of healing, prosperity, love, and just retribution,\
  \ she swore the oaths of a paladin and claimed Razmir as her patron. Sure, her \"\
  divine grace\" may actually involve daily uses of resolve, her \"smite evil\" works\
  \ on any target due to its being the samurai's challenge, and her mount has never\
  \ imagined a good-aligned plane much less been summoned from one. Nonetheless, she's\
  \ one of the most altruistic paladins I've ever come across.</p> \n    <p>I find\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play is a great way to try out this type of character.\
  \ Do you know any particularly weird \"paladins?\" If so, how did that character\
  \ emulate the class features or otherwise accomplish the deception?</p> \n    <p>Happy\
