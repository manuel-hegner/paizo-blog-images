  \ as fickle. They prefer the unpredictable and uncharted, far from prying eyes and\
  \ folks what ask too many questions. Never tied to one place, these vagabonds stay\
  \ strange and savvy, doing what they can to keep alive. When the galaxy needs a\
  \ job done, they call for the rough and tumble Space Cowboy.</p>\n      <br>\n \
