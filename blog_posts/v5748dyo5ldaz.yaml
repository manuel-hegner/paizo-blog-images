  \ \n     <p class=\"tiny\">â€”The Goblin Song, <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #1</i></a></p>\n    </center> \n    <p>For my money, that three-verse\
  \ song from the opening encounter of \"Burnt Offerings,\" the very first Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path adventure, is as responsible as anything for the huge success of\
  \ the Pathfinder Adventure Path line. Over the years (and really more or less immediately),\
  \ gamers began to equate Pathfinder with goblins, and the creepy little critters\
  \ (as envisioned by artist Wayne Reynolds and Paizo creative director James Jacobs,\
  \ the song's author) soon became a sort of unofficial mascot for the Pathfinder\
  \ brand.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ Pathfinder Battles fantasy miniature set gave us a great opportunity to revisit\
  \ the first Pathfinder adventures, and we knew we needed to include as many goblins\
  \ in the set that we could. </p> \n    <p>This week, I thought I'd show off most\
  \ of the goblin miniatures from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ set to celebrate the fact that at long last, we're ready to reveal the set's product\
  \ descriptions, prices, and case configurations!</p> \n    <p>I'll get to that a\
  \ bit later. First, let's talk about goblins!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120406-GoblinCommando.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120406-GoblinCommando_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>First up we have the common Goblin Commando, an elite goblin troop to\
  \ supplement the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qiq\">Goblin Warrior</a> or <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8qir\">Goblin Hero</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</a>. As you'll note in the Goblin Song above, goblins are no fans\
  \ of horses, which is why this trooper's makeshift pole-arm is called a horsechopper.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Mounts beware!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120406-GoblinDog.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120406-GoblinDog_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of Goblin Commandos and mounts,\
  \ here we have the vicious Goblin Commando on Goblin Dog, an uncommon figure that\
  \ plays prominently in several encounters of \"Burnt Offerings,\" especially in\
  \ the raid on the town of Sandpoint that kicks off the entire campaign. August's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</a> expands\
  \ this encounter, working <a href=\"/products/btpy8mop\">Flip-Mat: Town Square</a>\
  \ to set the scene. All you need to make it perfect is to add miniatures, and this\
  \ guy is designed specifically for that purpose.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120406-Ripnugget.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120406-Ripnugget_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the leader of the goblins\
  \ harrying Sandpoint, Warchief Ripnugget on Stickfoot. This teensie tyrant barks\
  \ orders at his tribe from the back of a giant gecko, making the PCs' encounter\
  \ with him (and with this rare miniature) one they won't soon forget.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>There are at least two more goblin-related miniatures coming in later previews,\
  \ so if you can hear one of the twisted verses of James Jacobs's Goblin Song echoing\
  \ over the horizon, it's because we're not quite done with goblins yet! </p>\n \
  \   <p><b>The Nitty Gritty</b></p> \n    <p>We've been teasing product details for\
  \ months, and I'm pleased to report that everything has finally fallen into place\
  \ so that we can reveal all of the little details about the size of the set, when\
  \ it will come out, and how the cases will be packaged. Click through to the various\
  \ product pages for price and additional details.</p> \n    <h3 style=\"font-size:\
  \ 1.1em;\"><b>Pathfinder Battles: Rise of the Runelords Set Details</b></h3> \n\
  \    <p><b>Release Date:</b> August 2012<br> <b>Set Size:</b> 65 prepainted plastic\
  \ miniatures</p> \n    <p><b>The Standard Booster</b></p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Standard Boosters</a> contain four collectible miniatures.\
  \ Each blind box contains a random selection of miniatures from the set, including\
  \ one Large figure and three Medium or Small figures. Many figures feature colored\
  \ clear plastic spell effects, crystals, and the like, and these figures range from\
  \ monsters to important NPCs to Pathfinder iconic characters like Seoni and Harsk.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Standard Boosters come in the following configurations:<br> Single\
  \ Standard Booster<br> 8-ct. Standard Booster Brick<br> 32-ct. Standard Booster\
  \ Case (4 bricks)</p> \n    <p><b>The Huge Booster</b></p> \n    <p>The Rise of\
  \ the Runelords set contains four Huge figures, from the Treachery Demon to the\
  \ Lamia Harridan (shown below) to two figures we haven't revealed yet. The large\
  \ size and relatively small number of these figures makes it impractical to include\
  \ them in the Standard Booster, so WizKids created a new product configuration:\
  \ The <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqt\">Rise of the Runelords Huge Booster</a>. Each\
  \ blind-boxed Huge Booster contains a single Huge figure from the Rise of the Runelords\
  \ set.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120406-Ceoptra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120406-Ceoptra_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Huge Boosters come in the following configurations:<br> Single\
  \ Huge Booster<br> 6-ct. Huge Booster Case</p> \n    <p><b>The Rune Giant</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>As we revealed <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ld9i\">last week</a>, the\
  \ biggest miniature in the set is the towering Rune Giant, our first Gargantuan\
  \ miniature! The Rune Giant has been produced in extremely limited quantities, and\
  \ is available for purchase only to retailers (from their distributor), paizo.com\
  \ Pathfinder Battles case subscribers, and customers who pre-order a Standard case\
  \ (while supplies last). For more details, visit the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqo\"\
  >Rune Giant</a> product page.</p> \n    <p><b>Subscribers</b></p> \n    <p>Customers\
  \ with an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>\
  \ receive the right to purchase the Rune Giant at 75% off the listed retail price,\
  \ and are guaranteed access to this extremely rare figure at a rate of one per case\
  \ ordered. They'll also receive a coupon code good for 20% off the purchase price\
  \ of one Encounter Pack (such as <a href=\"/products/btpy8qsa\">Champions of Evil</a>)\
  \ and the standard 20% case subscriber discount on all Pathfinder Battles singles\
  \ purchases made on paizo.com.</p> \n    <p><b>Completing the Set</b></p> \n   \
  \ <p>We've worked hard with WizKids to pack the cases in such a way that customers\
  \ who purchase a case of Standard Boosters, a case of Huge Boosters, and the Rune\
  \ Giant can reasonably expect to complete the entire 65-figure set. While we cannot\
  \ guarantee that this will happen due to the unlikely potential of packing errors\
  \ at the factory, the intention is that a full line of cases will get a nearly complete\
  \ set.</p> \n    <p>So that's it! The long-awaited full details on the long-awaited\
  \ \n     <link>Rise of the Runelords Pathfinder Battles set!</p> \n    <p>Next week\
  \ we'll be mack with more previews and more exciting miniatures reveals!</p> \n\
  \    <p>See you then!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </blockquote>\
