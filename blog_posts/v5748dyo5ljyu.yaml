  > \n     <p>Few appendices have made as big a splash in gaming history as Gary Gygax's\
  \ Appendix N. (<i>I thought Cosmo's appendix bursting at Gen Con that one year might\
  \ have it beat, but he reminded me that was technically a gallbladder removal, so\
  \ it's OUT OF THE RUNNING!</i>) That formative list of novels hit in 1979, in the\
  \ <em>AD&amp;D Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. In it, Gygax laid out some of the works\
  \ that had made the largest impact on him in the creation of Dungeons &amp; Dragons,\
  \ from Leigh Brackett and Robert E. Howard to Jack Vance and Andre Norton. In doing\
  \ so, he created a reading list for an entire generation of gamers and fantasy fans,\
  \ and had a tremendous impact on the genre as a whole.</p> \n     <p>When we created\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook</em></a> in 2009, we gleefully took the opportunity to publish\
  \ our own version of Appendix N, keen to introduce fans to our new favorites like\
  \ Clive Barker and China Miéville, along with grand masters like C. L. Moore. Yet\
  \ it was ultimately still a fairly small list—just a single column of text—and cribbed\
  \ heavily from Gygax, focusing solely on novels.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >When I first sat down to paginate the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, I knew that space was going to be at a premium.\
  \ I had, by some estimates, 800+ pages of content to cram into something even smaller\
  \ than Pathfinder's 576 pages. Yet I also knew that just one page of inspirational\
  \ media wasn't going to be enough. In order to make a game like Starfinder, we had\
  \ to stand on the shoulders of innumerable giants, both childhood heroes and our\
  \ friends and peers. We couldn't in good faith restrict ourselves to just literature,\
  \ either. How could you have Starfinder without <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Alien</em>?\
  \ Without Shadowrun and Warhammer 40,000? Without Starcraft and Mass Effect? It\
  \ just wouldn't be the same.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-InspirationalMedia.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-InspirationalMedia_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>So here, in its entirety, is the Inspirational Media\
  \ list from the back of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>. These are just a\
  \ few of the science fiction and science fantasy works that most influenced us in\
  \ our creation of Starfinder's rules and setting. Staff members from many different\
  \ departments contributed their nominations, and believe me, cutting the list down\
  \ to just two pages was brutal. I also want to give a particular shout-out to the\
  \ folks in the Tabletop RPG section. It was really important to us to include not\
  \ just the games we grew up playing, but also our favorite modern games like Numenera\
  \ and Eclipse Phase. There's no question that there are some brilliant SF games\
  \ out there at the moment, and we're excited to be joining their party.</p> \n \
  \    <p>So what are you waiting for? From <em>Illuminae</em> to <em>Hyperion</em>,\
  \ <em>Saga</em> to <em>Serenity</em>, there's a world of amazing speculative fiction\
  \ waiting for you—and hey, you've still got a month to kill until Starfinder launches!</p>\
