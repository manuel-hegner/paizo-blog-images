  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When putting together a\
  \ book, the lead designer or developer gives the text its framework and structure,\
  \ with the authors breathing life into the shell, then returning it to the designer\
  \ for molding into its final form. In the case of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\"\
  ><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, Pathfinder Lead Designer Logan Bonner set the stage\
  \ for the many authors who contributed to the book. While each author receives credit\
  \ in the book itself, space is limited. By shining the blog spotlight on them, we\
  \ can share more information, including what parts they worked on or other projects\
  \ they’re involved with.</p> \n     <p>We reached out to the authors and so many\
  \ responded that we’re splitting the blog into two parts. The first is below, and\
  \ the second will be posted later today. Authors are listed in no particular order.\
  \ Check back this afternoon for more creator goodness! If you're a fan of a particular\
  \ author, consider visiting their social media (if provided) or giving a shout out\

  \ \n     <h3>Ruvaid Virk (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Hello there! I’m Ruvaid, a Pakistani-American\
  \ writer who’s been playing Pathfinder Second Edition since release. I’m super stoked\
  \ to have been a part of this great book alongside so many amazing people. I wrote\
  \ a bunch of magic items that made it into both the consumable and permanent item\
  \ sections. I’m excited to see what you all think, and to see those items used in\
  \ action. You can find more of my work for Paizo in Bestiary 3, as well as books\
  \ 2 and 3 of the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path, and hopefully in more\
  \ future books! If you’d like to try out any of the awesome new options from this\
  \ book with me, I run a discord channel that hosts Pathfinder Society games every\
  \ Saturday morning at 9am EST, and I would love to have you in it! You can also\
  \ find me playing a Pathfinder Second Edition homebrew campaign, The Longstriders,\
  \ on Wednesday nights at 9pm EST with a group of awesome people on Twitch at <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/codygarettwells\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.twitch.tv/codygarettwells</a>.\
  \ I’m also on Twitter @Darth_Ruvaider, where I talk about my work, Pathfinder as\
  \ a whole, FFXIV, and whatever else comes to mind. I’m always looking for interesting\
  \ projects or even just people to talk games with, so feel free to send me a message!\
  \ I hope you all enjoy this book, and I will perhaps catch you on another blog some\
  \ time again, someday – cheers! Find me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@Darth_Ruvaider</a>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jessica Catalan\
  \ (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a full-time freelance\
  \ author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo since I started freelancing\
  \ two years ago, including seven organized play scenarios, Pathfinder’s <em>Advanced\
  \ Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Bestiary 3</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, and <em>Lost\
  \ Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, and Starfinder’s <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, <em>Starship\
  \ Operations Manual</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, and <em>The Gilded\
  \ Cage</em> (book 6 of the <em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Path). Some of my\
  \ upcoming releases include Guns &amp; Gears, Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, Tech Revolution,\
  \ and <em>Galactic Magic</em>! For <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I wrote Elementalism\
  \ and a bunch of new spells. </p> \n     <p><em>Secrets of Magic</em> is a really\
  \ unique book, and I desperately look forward to cracking open a copy. I hope you\
  \ enjoy <em>Secrets of Magic</em> as much as I do! You can find me on Twitter <a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/d20diaries\" target=\"_blank\">@d20diaries</a>.<br>\
  \ Until next time, <br> Jessica</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Andrew White (He/Him)\
  \ – Paizo Front End Engineering Lead</h3> \n     <p>Hello! I'm Andrew White, Paizo's\
  \ front-end engineering lead and occasional contributor to various Pathfinder and\
  \ Starfinder projects, including <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, <em>Bestiary\
  \ 3</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>,\
  \ and a handful of super secret, as-yet unannounced things. <em>Secrets of Magic</em>\
  \ was a blast to work on; I wrote a bunch of luck-focused and miscellaneous utility\
  \ spells and a couple of rituals, and I am unreasonably happy that my weird spell\
  \ that makes inanimate objects sentient without giving them the ability to move\
  \ or communicate made it into the final product. Hope you have fun with it!</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Minty Belmont of the Belmont System (She/her and Dae/Daem)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>I’m Minty! I’m a plural polyamorous trans woman. You may know me from\
  \ my work on a little series called “Hot or Not”, a series I run on @rpgegirl on\
  \ twitter where we rate TTRPG monsters (and aliens) as to whether they are hot or\
  \ not! We dive into the lore, the way monsters are built, and the general artwork\
  \ for it! I’m also something of a Twitch streamer at <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/shineychariot\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">twitch.tv/shineychariot</a> on Monday–Thursday nights, and I\
  \ do moderation work for Twitch streamers in my free time. I’ve been playing Tabletop\
  \ RPGs for over half my life now. Currently, I’m just obsessed with the Paizo family\
  \ of products, but previously I’ve played D&amp;D 3.5, a little bit of 4e, D20 modern,\
  \ D&amp;D 5e, Numenera, Zombie Survivalist second edition, Interstitial, and a little\
  \ bit of Pathfinder first edition. In the past I’ve made an entire TTRPG myself\
  \ that’s on hiatus for development and have written a few homebrew classes for 5e\
  \ and mini homebrew adventures for Pathfinder 2e! My favorite monster for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition is the Cacodaemon, and for Starfinder it’s the Calecor and literally\
  \ any undead creature. If you had a gun to my head asking what my favorite ice cream\
  \ was, first I’d ask you to put the gun down and then tell you it’s birthday cake\
  \ and you could have just asked. </p> \n     <p>Lastly, if you have a group that\
  \ wants to play Extinction Curse and you are missing one person, contact me. I’\

  \ \n     <p>In <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I wrote a variety of different sections,\
  \ including a few items and spells like <em>scorching ray</em> and the flexible\
  \ preparation section of the Book of Unlimited Magic. But my favorite contribution\
  \ was the treatise on magical essences. I’ve been excited to expand on the philosophical\
  \ underpinnings of those essences with all of you for a while, and I hope you enjoy\

  \ I’m Shay and I wrote the sympathetic rituals for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>! I’\
  ve been freelance writing and editing for Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder lines\
  \ for over a year now, and they’ve definitely kept me busy with work. My next available\
  \ piece of work is the Starfinder Society Scenario 4-06, which I wrote on my own\
  \ and I’m both excited and nervous to have it out there for everyone! You can also\
  \ keep an eye out for my contributions in the upcoming <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>!\
  \ When I’m not writing at 5am (because I haven’t gone to bed yet) you can find me\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar\" target=\"_blank\">@spellsinsugar</a>\
  \ on Twitter!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Д\
  орогие читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you might remember me\
  \ from <em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em>, and <em>PFS #1-15: Blooming Catastrophe</em> and <em>PFS\
  \ #2-08: A Frosty Mug</em>. Yes, I am the winter wolf hockey person!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>For <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, I did a passel of spells and rites, including\
  \ our very own Elizabeth Báthory-themed immortality rite (bring a towel) and <em>mystic\
  \ panoply</em>, for when your wizard simply must look <em>fabulous</em>. But I’\
  m most proud of the Arcane Treatise. I’ve always wondered, what exactly does magic\
  \ feel like, how do you actually learn it, how do all of these highly intelligent\
  \ wizards understand their own spellcasting? Getting a chance to try and answer\
  \ those questions was an absolute treat.</p> \n     <p>But let’s talk about my other\
  \ big project for a moment. <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> is an\
  \ upcoming PF2 Campaign Setting, a swashbuckling city of intrigue and weirdness\
  \ built atop the ruins of a very different world. How does magic work when compared\
  \ to the grandeur of the Preboreal Age, or to the alien omnipotence of the Angels?\
  \ You’ll need to wait for a bit to find out, but in the meantime you can check out\
  \ our twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuminantA\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>,\
  \ and keep an eye out for our second Kickstarter, coming soon (<em>Armaments of\
  \ the Luminant Age</em>)!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Liane Merciel</h3> \n     <p>Liane\
  \ Merciel has written for numerous fantasy and gaming shared worlds, including Pathfinder,\
  \ Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Bioware's Dragon Age universe, and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar.\
  \ She lives in Philadelphia with her family, which recently expanded to include\
  \ Catherine the Great, aka \"the Grub,\" who at two months old has already expressed\
  \ an appreciation for Norwegian gothic metal and skull-festooned demons. Truly,\
  \ a fine family tradition carries on.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Michael Sayre (He/Him)\
  \ – Paizo Designer</h3> \n     <p>Yo! I'm Michael Sayre and I worked on the shadow\
  \ magic section of Secrets of Magic. I've also worked on quite a few other products\
  \ for Paizo, including acting as design lead for the upcoming <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>\
  \ book, as well as working with a number of third-party publishers supporting Pathfinder\
  \ first and second editions, D&amp;D 5E, and more. <em>Secrets of Magic</em> was\
  \ an exciting book to work on as it represents the first book looking at new and\
  \ interesting ways we can advance the game and introduce new options in innovative\
  \ and unique formats. As the game continues to grow beyond the core foundation of\
  \ the game represented by the CRB, APG, GMG, and Bestiaries, I'm really looking\
  \ forward to more books like <em>Secrets of Magic</em> that can make both the world\
  \ of Golarion and the rules of the game evolve in exciting ways! You can find some\
  \ of my third-party work on DriveThruRPG at <a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?author=Michael%20Sayre\"\

  \ (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I've been\
  \ freelancing for about five years, doing both Pathfinder and Starfinder. For Secrets\
  \ of Magic, I did some spells, including the incarnate spells previewed in an earlier\
  \ blog. Coming up with super-powerful entities you can summon—but only keep hold\
  \ of briefly—was a lot of fun, and I look forward to seeing what new incarnate spells\
  \ might pop up in the future!</p> \n     <p>As for my most recent Paizo projects,\
  \ I'm an author on the upcoming <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> and the recently released\
  \ <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> for Starfinder. I've got some other cool things\
  \ in the works, but nothing I can talk about yet! When I'm not freelancing game\
  \ stuff, I can usually be found writing fiction, reading, playing various video\
  \ games, or baking in my very tiny Boston kitchen. I've just started up an ongoing\
  \ blog series on my website where I make a new, fully statted NPC every couple weeks,\
  \ alternating between Pathfinder and Starfinder. If you're looking for some NPCs\
  \ to pop into your games, you can check that out at <a href=\"https://klspeedling.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">klspeedling.com</a>. You can also find me on Twitter <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/KendraLS\">@KendraLS</a>, where I'm making a valiant attempt\
  \ to be slightly more active. (Fun side note: this blog is scheduled to come out\
  \ on my birthday!)</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jason Tondro (he/him) – Paizo Developer</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>ason is a developer on the Starfinder RPG, where he helps to create\
  \ Adventure Path volumes and stand-alone modules; when there’s three Jasons in the\
  \ same Paizo meeting and it gets confusing, you can call him Jake. Jake was a college\
  \ professor for many years, teaching writing, film, and world literature—especially\
  \ from the medieval and Renaissance periods. He earned his PhD at the University\
  \ of California Riverside—focusing on superhero stories across comics, film, and\
  \ television—and that’s where he was given the nickname “Doctor Comics.” These days,\
  \ however, he works with tabletop RPGs much more than with comics. Jake joined Paizo\
  \ over three years ago as part of the editorial team, just as Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition was announced, and learned much from his colleagues over a year and a\
  \ half. His first big project as a Starfinder developer was Fly Free or Die, a 6-volume\
  \ adventure path about working class heroes trying to make ends meet in a cruel\
  \ and greedy universe; the final volume to that AP came out in April, and while\
  \ he assists Jason (see!) Keeley on Horizons of the Vast, he’s working on unannounced\
  \ future projects. He lives in Seattle with Miss Tessmacher and Otis, his rescue\
  \ dogs. He’s on social media—<a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctorcomics\">@doctorcomics</a>\
  \ (Twitter); Jason’s “Starfinder Developer Diary” videos walking through every aspect\
  \ of AP development can be found on YouTube at the BAMF Podcast channel.</p> \n\
  \     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>That’s it for Part 1 of our author blog. Don't\
  \ forget to check back this afternoon for Part 2. In the meantime, be sure to preorder\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\"><em>Secrets\
  \ of Magic</em></a> here on paizo.com or reserve a copy from your local game store,\
