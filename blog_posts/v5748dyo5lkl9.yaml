  \ \n    <p>Welcome to the next evolution of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game!</p>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Just shy of 10 years ago, on March 18th, 2008,\
  \ we asked you to take a bold step with us and download the Alpha Playtest PDF for\
  \ Pathfinder First Edition. Over the past decade, we've learned a lot about the\
  \ game and the people who play it. We've talked with you on forums, we've gamed\
  \ with you at conventions, and we've watched you play online and in person at countless\
  \ venues. We went from updating mechanics to inventing new ones, adding a breadth\
  \ of options to the game and making the system truly our own. We've made mistakes,\
  \ and we've had huge triumphs. Now it is time to take all of that knowledge and\
  \ make the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game even better.</p> \n    <p>By now, you've\
  \ probably read all about the upcoming launch of the Playtest version of the game\
  \ set to release on August 2nd, 2018 (but just in case you haven't, <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\"\
  >click here</a>). In the weeks and months leading up to that release, we are going\
  \ give you an in-depth look at this game, previewing all 12 of the classes and examining\
  \ many of the most fundamental changes to the game. Of course, that is a long time\
  \ to wait to get a complete picture, so I wanted to take this opportunity to give\
  \ you insight into the game, how it works, and why we made the changes that we made.\
  \ We will be covering these in much more detail later, but we thought it might be\
  \ useful to give a general overview right now.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>New,\
  \ but the Same</h2> \n    <p>Our first goal was to make Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ feel just like the game you know and love. That means that as a player, you need\
  \ to be able to make the choices that allow you to build the character you want\
  \ to play. Similarly, as a Game Master, you need to have the tools and the support\
  \ to tell the story you want to tell. The rules that make up the game have to fundamentally\
  \ still fill the same role they did before, even if some of the mechanics behind\
  \ them are different.</p> \n    <h2>Building a Character</h2> \n    <p>It's worth\
  \ taking a moment to talk about how characters are built, because we spent a lot\
  \ of time making this process smoother and more intuitive. You start by selecting\
  \ your ancestry (which used to be called race), figuring out where you came from\
  \ and what sorts of basic statistics you have. Next you decide on your background,\
  \ representing how you were raised and what you did before taking up the life of\
  \ an adventurer. Finally, you select your class, the profession you have dedicated\
  \ yourself to as an intrepid explorer. Each one of these choices is very important,\
  \ modifying your starting ability scores, giving you starting proficiencies and\
  \ class skills, and opening up entire feat chains tailored to your character.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After making the big choices that define your character, you have a variety\
  \ of smaller choices to make, including assigning skill proficiencies, picking an\
  \ ancestry feat, buying gear, and deciding on the options presented by your class.\
  \ Finally, after deciding on all of your choices, the only thing left to do is figure\
  \ out all of your bonuses, which are now determined by one unified system of proficiency,\
  \ based on your character's level.</p> \n    <p>As you go on grand adventures with\
  \ your character, you will gain experience and eventually level up. Pathfinder characters\
  \ have exciting and important choices to make every time they gain a level, from\
  \ selecting new class feats to adding new spells to their repertoires.</p> \n  \
  \  <h2>Playing the Game</h2> \n    <p>We've made a number of changes to the way\
  \ the game is played, to clean up the overall flow of play and to add some interesting\
  \ choices in every part of the story. First up, we have broken play up into three\
  \ distinct components. Encounter mode is what happens when you are in a fight, measuring\
  \ time in seconds, each one of which can mean life or death. Exploration mode is\
  \ measured in minutes and hours, representing travel and investigation, finding\
  \ traps, decoding ancient runes, or even mingling at the queen's coronation ball.\
  \ Of all the modes of play, exploration is the most flexible, allowing for easy\
  \ storytelling and a quick moving narrative. Finally, the downtime mode happens\
  \ when your characters are back in town, or relative safety, allowing them to retrain\
  \ abilities, practice a trade, lead an organization, craft items, or recuperate\
  \ from wounds. Downtime is measured in days, generally allowing time to flow by\
  \ in an instant.</p> \n    <p>Most of the game happens in exploration or encounter\
  \ mode, with the two types of play flowing easily from one to the other. In fact,\
  \ exploration mode can have a big impact on how combat begins, determining what\
  \ you roll for your initiative. In a group of four exploring a dungeon, two characters\
  \ might have their weapons ready, keeping an eye out for danger. Another might be\
  \ skulking ahead, keeping to the shadows, while the fourth is looking for magic.\
  \ If combat begins, the first two begin with their weapons drawn, ready for a fight,\
  \ and they roll Perception for their initiative. The skulking character rolls Stealth\
  \ for initiative, giving them a chance to hide before the fight even begins. The\
  \ final adventurer rolls Perception for initiative, but also gains some insight\
  \ as to whether or not there is magic in the room.</p> \n    <p>After initiative\
  \ is sorted out and it's your turn to act, you get to take three actions on your\
  \ turn, in any combination. Gone are different types of actions, which can slow\
  \ down play and add confusion at the table. Instead, most things, like moving, attacking,\
  \ or drawing a weapon, take just one action, meaning that you can attack more than\
  \ once in a single turn! Each attack after the first takes a penalty, but you still\
  \ have a chance to score a hit. In Pathfinder Second Edition, most spells take two\
  \ actions to cast, but there are some that take only one. <i>Magic missile</i>,\
  \ for example, can be cast using from one to three actions, giving you an additional\
  \ missile for each action you spend on casting it!</p> \n    <p>Between turns, each\
  \ character also has one reaction they can take to interrupt other actions. The\
  \ fighter, for example, has the ability to take an attack of opportunity if a foe\
  \ tries to move past or its defenses are down. Many classes and monsters have different\
  \ things they can do with their reactions, making each combat a little bit less\
  \ predictable and a lot more exciting. Cast a fire spell near a red dragon, for\
  \ example, and you might just find it takes control of your magic, roasting you\
  \ and your friends instead of the intended target!</p> \n    <h2>Monsters and Treasure</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The changes to the game are happening on both sides of the GM screen.\
  \ Monsters, traps, and magic items have all gotten significant revisions.</p> \n\
  \    <p>First off, monsters are a lot easier to design. We've moved away from strict\
  \ monster construction formulas based off type and Hit Dice. Instead, we start by\
  \ deciding on the creature's rough level and role in the game, then select statistics\
  \ that make it a balanced and appropriate part of the game. Two 7th-level creatures\
  \ might have different statistics, allowing them to play differently at the table,\
  \ despite both being appropriate challenges for characters of that level.</p> \n\
  \    <p>This also makes it easier for us to present monsters, giving us more space\
  \ to include special abilities and actions that really make a monster unique. Take\
  \ the fearsome tyrannosaurus, for example; if this terrifying dinosaur gets you\
  \ in its jaws, it can take an action to fling you up to 20 feet through the air,\
  \ dealing tremendous damage to you in the process!</p> \n    <p>Hazards are now\
  \ a more important part of the game, from rangers creating snares to traps that\
  \ you have to actively fight against if you want to survive. Poisons, curses, and\
  \ diseases are a far more serious problem to deal with, having varied effects that\
  \ can cause serious penalties, or even death.</p> \n    <p>Of all of the systems\
  \ that Game Masters interact with, magic items are one of the most important, so\
  \ we spent extra time ensuring that they are interesting and fun. First and foremost,\
  \ we have taken significant steps to allow characters to carry the items they want,\
  \ instead of the items that they feel they must have to succeed. Good armor and\
  \ a powerful weapon are still critical to the game, but you no longer have to carry\
  \ a host of other smaller trinkets to boost up your saving throws or ability scores.\
  \ Instead, you find and make the magic items that grant you cool new things to do\
  \ during play, giving you the edge against all of the monsters intent on making\
  \ you into their next meal.</p> \n    <p>We can't wait until you find your first\
  \ +1 longsword to see what it can do!</p> \n    <h2>What's Next?</h2> \n    <p>There\
  \ are a lot of things we are excited to show off, so many in fact that we have to\
  \ pace ourselves. First off, if you want to hear the game in action right now, we've\
  \ recorded a special podcast with the folks from the <a href=\"https://glasscannonpodcast.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Glass Cannon Network</a>, converting the original Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition Module, <em>Crypt of the Everflame</em>, to the new edition. Head\
  \ on over to their site and listen to the first part of this adventure now!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Stop by tomorrow for the first blog taking an in-depth look at Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition, starting off with the new system for taking actions, then visit\
  \ us again on Friday for an exploration of the Glass Cannon game, exploring some\
  \ of its spoilers in detail!</p> \n    <h2>We Need You!</h2> \n    <p>All of us\
  \ at Paizo want to take a moment to thank you, the fans, players, and game masters\
  \ that have made this exciting journey a possibility. It's been a wild ride for\
  \ the past decade, and speaking personally, I could not be more excited for where\
  \ we are heading. But, as I am sure you've heard a number of times already, we cannot\
  \ make this game without you, without your feedback and passion for the game. Thank\
  \ you for coming with us on this adventure, thank you for contributing to our community,\
  \ and thank you for playing Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director\
