  \ Masked goes by many names.\n    </div> \n    <p>The only man still alive in the\
  \ room smiled behind his dark mask.</p> \n    <p>The warning was encrypted, but\
  \ Molthuni codes had never risen above simple. Always the same pattern, always strict\
  \ adherence to unimaginative authority, leaving many holes for a clever rat to slip\
  \ through.</p> \n    <p>And although more than a few things had slipped away from\
  \ him recently, he was still a clever rat.</p> \n    <p>He read the Molthuni intelligence\
  \ report again. Bluntly flattering. No wonder Tarlmond had laid a trap for him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>The man Tarram Armistrade always wears masks, and so is most widely\
  \ known as \"The Masked</i><i>.\"</i><i> Nethran gives his name as \"Armistrode,\"\
  \ but this is now considered a misreading of a handwritten ledger entry. Has gone\
  \ by several other names, including Bellowbar, Jalosker, and Markant.</i></p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Makes his living as a thief; successful, is wanted for many crimes in\
  \ Cheliax. Many small thefts within our borders probable, but none proven. Suspected\
  \ of involvement in the Five Dragons thefts.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Is swift to violence\
  \ and must be considered dangerous.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Tall. Agile. Speaks courteously\
  \ and in cultured sentences; can and has impersonated nobility, law-officers, priests,\
  \ and officials. Observant, and remembers what he sees.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Some\
  \ recent accounts report that his face has been damaged or altered in some manner.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Recently seen in Canorate and Braganza. Apprehend on sight for interrogation,\
  \ but slay without hesitation if difficulties arise.</i></p> \n    <p>Ah, yes, those\
  \ oft-arising difficulties. Annoying things.</p> \n    <p>It had been a nasty little\
  \ trap. A needle tipped in soporific poison, thrusting up under the seat-cushion.\
  \ If his long-ago preparations for getting past the defenses of the Five Dragons\
  \ hadn't left him immune to that particular poison forever, he might be slumped\
  \ helpless in that chair right now, lost in dreams, waiting to be awakened by the\
  \ ungentle handling of cold-faced men in blood-red Molthuni tabards, eager to take\
  \ out their frustrations on the dangerous fugitive known as The Masked.</p> \n \
  \   <p>If Tarlmond had been a better actor, if the man had been better able to leash\
  \ his own anger and keep it off his face ...but he hadn't.</p> \n    <p>The Halidon\
  \ merchant's fury at discovering just how badly he'd been hoodwinked had fairly\
  \ bellowed across his cozy office at his arriving guest. The Masked would have had\
  \ to be blind and deaf not to notice the blazing glare, the tight-lipped smile,\
  \ the greetings curt even for Molthune.</p> \n    <p>Luckily, he wasn't either of\
  \ those things. Yet.</p> \n    <p>His good mood turned bitter.</p> \n    <p>As if\
  \ he needed to be punished. If he could have undone that theft—years ago, now—he\
  \ might still have a face. He might be able to live a comfortable life without the\
  \ constant threat of pursuit—and by those far more dangerous than any Molthuni investigator.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Who would have thought such danger lurked in masks? <i>Masks!</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Bejeweled, darkly elegant, one even sporting feathers. He should have\
  \ known a wizard's mask would harbor magic.</p> \n    <p>He should have done so\
  \ many things differently.</p> \n    <p>And if so, what then? He might have died\
  \ years ago, drowned in boredom behind a desk in some ledger-cluttered shop cellar\
  \ room, in one of the more crowded and noisome cities, keeping track of \"chamber\
  \ pots, black\" or \"false noses, flesh-hued.\"</p> \n    <p>False noses like those\
  \ he no longer bothered to use, because there was nothing left to keep them from\
  \ sliding down to plummet from the chin he no longer had.</p> \n    <p>It had been\
  \ the easiest of mistakes. He'd needed to see in the dark in order to make his escape,\
  \ and so had put on the one mask of his newfound loot whose magic was supposed to\
  \ help with that.</p> \n    <p>He'd taken it off again soon enough, but \"soon enough\"\
  \ had been too late.</p> \n    <p>The curse had begun. Slowly wiping away his face.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Someday, a dying sage had warned him, it would leave only eyes staring\
  \ out of a blank, smooth sheet of flesh. Noseless, mouthless, and chinless. He'd\
  \ go mute, reduced to breathing through his skin, with an endless, droning whistling.\
  \ He'd be something people would recoil from, or else draw sword and hack at in\
  \ terror and revulsion. A walking worm that would quickly starve to death.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He wasn't that far gone yet. He could still fare well enough far and wide\
  \ across Golarion, in increasing desperation to find magic to halt and reverse his\
  \ curse. Nothing he'd yet found even slowed what was happening to him.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Yet I remain Tarram Armistrade,\" he told the dead man on the floor gently.\
  \ \"For now.\"</p> \n    <p>His once-handsome face was a ruin, nose gone and mouth\
  \ a mere slit in a chinless slide of flesh. He covered it with masks that had no\
  \ magic, because leaving <i>the</i> mask on hastened its foul work.</p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ he dared not leave the cursed mask hidden, for any harm done to it happened to\
  \ his face, too. Usually he wore it like some sort of hidden codpiece, under his\
  \ clothes, where it was least noticeable. Where he was wearing it right now.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Though more truly,\" he added to the sprawled and forever silent Tarlmond,\
  \ \"I am now The Masked.\"</p> \n    <p>It was a matter of necessity. If he went\
  \ around unmasked, he'd no doubt be mistaken for a monster and slain by the first\
  \ warrior he passed. The laws of Molthune allowed citizens who perceived danger\
  \ to slay \"horrible monsters.\" Molthuni law was so clear-cut and brutally simple.\
  \ Pity for everyone that most people weren't.</p> \n    <p>The Masked looked around\
  \ the room and smiled, though he took little pleasure in it. Cozy rooms like this\
  \ one, chambers of wealth that stank of power and ill-gotten gains, were where he\
  \ flourished these days. While his victims fell.</p> \n    <p>Enough self-pity.\
  \ He took up the poker and stirred the small fire in the grate to spitting, popping\
  \ vigor. He dropped the intelligence report onto its flaring flames, pinned it there\
  \ with the point of the poker, and watched it curl and blacken into ash.</p> \n\
  \    <p>When nothing recognizable was left, the tall masked man turned to survey\
  \ the shelves behind the desk again, peering at the lowest-down tomes.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Ah. There.</p> \n    <p>Escolarr Tarlmond was as predictable as he was greedy.\
  \ That particular fat volume. Sigh.</p> \n    <p>When purchasing a false book as\
  \ a treasure-coffer, even a <i>dolt</i> should be aware that to buy one out of a\
  \ shop window in Canorate, from a shop that made scores of identical volumes, meant\
  \ that many would recognize your hiding place for what it was at a glance.</p> \n\
  \    <p>There'd be a removable floorboard somewhere in this room, too, and a rather\
  \ better coffer beneath it. With another poisoned needle, no doubt. Best toyed with\
  \ at leisure, elsewhere, so take the second and leave the first. Between the book\
  \ coffer, Tarlmond's purse, and the gems that undoubtedly rode in a hollow boot\
  \ heel, no one would notice the missing floorboard stash.</p> \n    <p>But first,\
  \ there was still business to attend to.</p> \n    <p>Molthuni sword-tutors taught\
  \ too many showy flourishes. Tarlmond had taken so much time singing his blade free\
  \ of its scabbard, and needed so much room to do so, that it had been simplicity\
  \ itself to step inside the man's reach, thrust the elbow of his sword arm away\
  \ with one hand, and throttle the merchant with the other. A quiet and bloodless\
  \ death, but it left The Masked needing to account for—or conceal—the congested\
  \ purple of the dead man's face.</p> \n    <p>He caught up the decanter that held\
  \ Tarlmond's best wine, splashed it generously over the corpse's face, front, and\
  \ hands, then arranged the remains with that purple face in the fire, a goblet in\
  \ one dead hand and a stool overturned where it would look as if the drunken merchant\
  \ had tripped over it and ended up in the fire.</p> \n    <p>Finding the right floorboard,\
  \ and its spring-dart trap—my, but Tarlmond had been a nasty, suspicious man, and\
  \ Halidon was better off without him—took but a moment. The coffer thus gained was\
  \ smaller and lighter than most, which was even better. Into the padded underarm\
  \ sack it went.</p> \n    <p>The Masked shot a last, careful look around the room,\
  \ and found nothing that could be linked to a tall masked visitor. Closing the door\
  \ softly behind him, he strolled out and down the stairs, not hurrying.</p> \n \
  \   <p>The first faint wafts of burning flesh preceded him. It smelled like boar,\
  \ reminding The Masked he was hungry—but the reek of Tarlmond's perfumed hair oil,\
  \ rising to overtake it, was just horrible.</p> \n    <p>Yes, Halidon was much better\
  \ off without him.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra Loroeva\
  \ Klazra had run out of curses days ago. The abominable creaking of the ill-maintained\
  \ wagon had long since half-deafened her and brought on a ringing headache that\
  \ felt as if someone had put a metal bowl over her head and started tapping it with\
  \ a hammer.</p> \n    <p>She could tell by the color of the road-mud passing slowly\
  \ and lurchingly beneath her that the caravan was far west of Canorate now, up out\
  \ of the low river-vale farms and close to the Backar Forest. The roadside was littered\
  \ with twigs and withered leaves fallen from carts that would soon have been snatched\
  \ up for hearth-kindling, back where she'd come from.</p> \n    <p>Come from? Hah!\
  \ <i>Escaped</i> from.</p> \n    <p>She'd come from Nirmathas, too long ago. Canorate\
  \ had only been where she'd lived—existed—as a slave.</p> \n    <p>A small, puny,\
  \ but useful slave.</p> \n    <p>If she hadn't been short and gaunt, even for a\
  \ halfling, she could never have fit between the rotten wagon floorboards and the\
  \ ramp-boards slung under the decaying conveyance on open frames—recently repaired\
  \ frames that were probably the stoutest, best-built part of this damnable, never-to-be-sufficiently-cursed\
  \ wagon.</p> \n    <p>A turnip wagon, no less, its old sides and bottom too full\
  \ of cracks to haul grain any more. Which at least made it unlikely anyone would\
  \ soon be needing to haul forth the ramp-boards that were serving Tantaerra as a\
  \ floor. Turnips got forked out of wagons, or clawed into sacks and the sacks tossed\
  \ down.</p> \n    <p>She <i>hated</i> turnips.</p> \n    <p>Still, being wedged\
  \ here like an opportunistic rat won out over being a Molthuni slave. Just about\
  \ any situation would—and Tantaerra had been one of the luckier slaves. Her master,\
  \ back in Canorate, had been a maker and seller of knives, specializing in throwing\
  \ knives. She'd been his sharpener, errand-runner, and demonstrator of the art of\
  \ hurling and catching razor-sharp knives. Which had made some Molthuni wary of\
  \ kicking or throwing handy objects at a scuttling, skinny, two-and-a-half-foot-tall\
  \ halfling.</p> \n    <p>Not that she'd spent most days doing much more than running\
  \ the grinding wheel or scampering along the highest shelves, fetching down blades\
  \ to save Hroalund the puffing work of moving his stockroom ladder. And happily\
  \ eating the apples and wedges of cheese he literally tossed her way.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>That had all ended, very suddenly and not long ago, the day someone had killed\
  \ old Hroalund in a dispute over prices.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra had taken his smallest,\
  \ most exquisite throwing knives—the little adorned ones he sold to women of wealth,\
  \ to wear hidden under their garments as sharp little surprises for those who offered\
  \ unwanted attentions—strapped them all over herself, and gotten out, far and fast,\
  \ seeking the caravan yards. Slaves were blamed for murders all too often, and she'd\
  \ no desire for <i>that</i> painful a death.</p> \n    <p>So she'd left the grandest\
  \ city in Molthune the way most vermin did, hiding under a turnip wagon and living\
  \ like a rat, foraging by night when the wagon stopped. Whatever she could find—\
  ground-grubs one night, and handfuls of grass too often. Sometimes she stole from\
  \ the caravan as well—anything but turnips. Halfling slaves were always hungry,\
  \ but she wanted food, not <i>turnips</i>.</p> \n    <p>Well, the sun was lowering;\
  \ it would soon be foraging time again. The puddles passing under her were starting\
  \ to stink of more than ox-dung and horse heaps, too, and her wagon was starting\
  \ to rattle over larger rocks, the broken and half-buried remnants of flagstones.\
  \ They were coming to some sort of settlement.</p> \n    <p>That meant more danger\
  \ for her than the open road, yet it might be a good thing in the longer run. The\
  \ wagon's groans were deepening, which meant she might soon have to find a different\
  \ home—if something right beside her didn't break with sudden violence and maim\
  \ her in an instant.</p> \n    <p>Oh, life was <i>such</i> an endless parade of\
  \ amusements...</p> \n    <p>\"Ho, Yarlin! Get that banner up! Halidon's garrisoned,\
  \ and I'd rather not be wearing half a dozen bolts before nightfall!\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>That gruff shout came from almost beside Tantaerra, as the head of the caravan\
  \ guards rode past.</p> \n    <p>Halidon. She'd heard it mentioned once or twice\
  \ during her years in Canorate. A small place—logging village, most likely, as it\
  \ stood at the edge of the Backar Forest. A usual waystop because it was near mid-journey,\
  \ when taking the most direct roads between Braganza and Canorate.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ they were that close to Halidon. Good. This gods-cursed wagon just <i>might</i>\
  \ make it.</p> \n    <p><i>KeeEEERAKKh</i>.</p> \n    <p>Or not.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ wheel that was thankfully farthest from Tantaerra rode up over a particularly\
  \ sharp stone and then thumped down its far side—and the axle that had been spitting\
  \ grease all over her for days shivered and split, from the hub of the wheel halfway\
  \ to where a certain small and uncomfortably cramped halfling was grimly watching\
  \ it from.</p> \n    <p>The wagon—and the caravan it was part of—lurched right on.\
  \ No one had heard, of course. No surprise there. This lot saw and heard nothing\
  \ that didn't jump up and dance for coin under their very noses.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ constant groaning of the wagon was different now, as the dying axle added its\
  \ own protest to the general din. A sort of rising, wobbling, wandering shriek that—\
  oh, how could they <i>not</i> hear it?</p> \n    <p>When someone stuck his head\
  \ in and under for a look, a certain non-paying passenger would be discovered. Though\
  \ there were halflings in Molthune who weren't slaves, Tantaerra had never known\
  \ any personally—and stowaways of any height were rarely greeted with much kindness.\
  \ Moreover, to a certain breed of merchant, a female slave—even a two-and-a-half-foot-tall\
  \ halfling, well out of girlhood and approaching middle age—would be something to\
  \ cage and make use of.</p> \n    <p>Neither the wagon in front of this one nor\
  \ the one behind had ramp boards or anything else slung underneath. The wagon three\
  \ back trailed a broken-off length of rusty chain and the dangling remains of a\
  \ ramp-board frame, but she doubted they'd carry much more than the weight of a\
  \ few spiders or flies before tearing free and falling to the road.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ light was failing, the sun sinking low, and by the rattling of slowing iron-shod\
  \ wagon wheels and the clip-clop of hooves rising ahead of her now, there was less\
  \ mud and more stone underfoot. Voices, too, and some excited shouts. Children.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The caravan had entered Halidon proper. Which meant, the gods being the\
  \ gods, that it was just about time for this axle to—</p> \n    <p>SheeEEE<i>EEREEAKH!\
  \ </i></p> \n    <p>Tantaerra dropped and rolled even before the far wheel came\
  \ off the separating axle and the wagon lurched and then sank down into a nightmare\
  \ of splinters, amid a chorus of surprised and angry shouts.</p> \n    <p>She had\
  \ a glimpse of the wheel wobbling away on its own, bouncing and swaying like a drunkard\
  \ leaving a tavern late. Then her own hasty escape snatched her view of it away.\
  \ Out and back, to scuttle like a crab under the next wagon and hope its oxen weren't\
  \ fast enough when stamping at her to—</p> \n    <p>\"Hoy! <i>You!</i> Crannor,\
  \ what's that? It just went under your wagon! Like a halfling, but smaller!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Like a halfling, but smaller</i>.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra growled silently\
  \ at that and kept scuttling, running on hands and knees just as fast as she knew\
  \ how, trying to—</p> \n    <p>\"<i>There!</i> I saw it! Over there, under Derethrai's\
  \ wagon, now!\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's all this?\" Sharper voices, and unfamiliar,\
  \ not from the caravan. She risked a look.</p> \n    <p>Molthuni soldiers. Big,\
  \ clomping hobnailed boots, dark breeches, blood-red tunics, helmets too big to\
  \ stay on without chinstraps, and spears. Led by an officer without a spear, who\
  \ was instead carrying some sort of short battle-hammer with a wicked-looking spike\
  \ where its pommel should be.</p> \n    <p>\"Stowaway, or a thief, under the wagons.\
  \ It broke yon turnip cart, somehow.\"</p> \n    <p><i>Oh, aye. Blame </i>me<i>\
  \ for your born-of-neglect breakdowns, now!</i></p> \n    <p>\"'It'?\" the Molthuni\
  \ officer snapped. \"Some sort of beast?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't rightly know, yet.\
  \ Small, and fast—and <i>some</i>thing's been stealing food from us, all the way\
  \ from Canorate! If you'll look under <i>that</i> wagon!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Trail\
  \ thefts are your problem, citizen, not the duty of the soldiers of Molthune to\
  \ ...\"</p> \n    <p>Boots, tramping closer, the sharp points of spear-heads dipping\
  \ down into view, and Tantaerra had run out of wagons.</p> \n    <p>Cursing silently,\
  \ she doubled back. The one place they'd not be so enthusiastic when thrusting spears\
  \ would be in among the mud-spattered legs of the oxen at the front of each wagon.\
  \ Oxen cost coin, good coin, and so did harness, and—</p> \n    <p>\"Hah!\" One\
  \ of the soldiers, too dim-witted not to thrust his spear right into the snorting,\
  \ stamping midst of the oxen. \"I see it—a boy, a really <i>small</i> boy, a—no,\
  \ a girl! Barefoot—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Croel, haven't you ever seen a <i>halfling</i>\
  \ before? Slave Pits of Absalom, boy, but they're—<i>mind!</i> You'll have—\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Whatever else the older soldier might have been going to say was lost\
  \ in a dozen shouts of alarm. An ox had felt the burning bite of a careless spear-slice,\
  \ and tried to rear back and kick out at where the pain had come from. The wagon\
  \ it and three fellow beasts were yoked to shuddered under its buffeting, and frightened\
  \ and angry muffled shouts arose from within it.</p> \n    <p>Shouts that grew suddenly\
  \ louder as doors banged, and the ox kicked again and soldiers leveled spears at\
  \ the beast as if it were some sort of battlefield foe.</p> \n    <p>\"<i>What</i>\
  \ by the ponderous teats of Lamashtu are all you idiots doing? We just about got\
  \ a dozen jars of Mereth's best honey-wine sauce in our <i>laps</i>! D'you have\
  \ <i>any</i> idea how much that goes for in Braganza? Nearly lost a handful of Crysta's\
  \ map-painted plattercloths, too! Stand <i>back</i> from my oxen, you spear-waving\
  \ idiots, or I'll have your guts for my next batch of sausages, I will!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Citizen, have a care for how you speak to soldiers of Mol—\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I <i>am</i> having a care, helm-for-brains! If I were treating these louts\
  \ of yours like mere brigands, they'd be choking around my fists run far down their\
  \ gullets right now! You in charge of this untrained, murderous rabble, then? Well,\
  \ let me tell you a thing or two about how officers conducted themselves when <i>I</i>\
  \ was wearing a uniform as ugly as yours, and going up against real foes of Molthune\
  \ rather than handy <i>oxen</i>! Why, back in those days, we—\"</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra\
  \ grinned. Good old Bryhraun, and his Finest Sausages, too! He could keep this up\
  \ right through the night, and would, if someone didn't put a spear through him\
  \ to shut him up. </p> \n    <p>Bryhraun! Yes! His wagon was crammed with edibles,\
  \ and it had those little light-windows up by the front that opened from within.\
  \ If she scampered just right, she could snatch and be gone onto its roof before\
  \ anyone could grab her.</p> \n    <p>Bryhraun was still spewing oaths and belligerence\
  \ at the Molthuni officer, who was busy putting one of those sneeringly weary \"\
  I'm only going to put up with this for <i>so</i> long, old windbag, and my patience\
  \ has <i>just</i> about run out\" expressions on his face.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra\
  \ stuck out her tongue at him as she raced into view, caught hold of the trail-step\
  \ of Bryhraun's wagon, and swung herself into a backflip and roll up and into the\
  \ wagon—right between the merchant's legs, where she hoped they'd not be foolish\
  \ enough to thrust spears at her, given the old merchant's temper.</p> \n    <p>Ah,\
  \ but they were. She found her feet only to see Bryhraun's stout and hog-ugly wife\
  \ and daughter converging on her, shrieking.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra plucked up a\
  \ fat \"dragonsmoke\" sausage as long as her arm, sprang to the high shelves beside\
  \ the little window on her left, hauled on its dog-lever as hard as she knew how,\
  \ and was out into the breeze and the gathering dusk before Bryhraun's wife could\
  \ draw breath for her next scream.</p> \n    <p>And up onto the wagon roof, thanks\
  \ to a hard swing on the frame of the window itself. Only long enough for a deep\
  \ breath and a wild peer all around, before she took a firm grip on the sausage—\
  sinking her fingers into it, that was the trick—then sprang into a wild leap for\
  \ the roof of the next wagon. Dingy blue, which meant it housed Maraskho's Fine\
  \ Garments.</p> \n    <p>She only <i>just</i> made it, landing hard and bruisingly,\
  \ skidding along most of its dirty, warp-boarded length.</p> \n    <p>Behind her,\
  \ Bryhraun's wagon rocked. Its oxen grunted and shrieked and tried to snarl as their\
  \ hooves sliced into each other, and general mayhem erupted. She could hear falling\
  \ goods crashing around in the merchant's wagon and his family's screams rising\
  \ into wild and frightened incoherence, but was more intent on all the villagers\
  \ converging to see what was happening.</p> \n    <p>No more soldiers yet, which\
  \ was good, and some of the patrol that had gathered around Bryhraun's wagon were\
  \ being jostled by arriving locals, spears waving wildly as they tried to follow\
  \ her yet not gut someone. Even better.</p> \n    <p>It would be dark soon, but\
  \ not soon enough. Everyone who cared to could see her, and it seemed Halidon bred\
  \ or reared hardened folk. If any of them got a grip on her, she'd have to be fast\
  \ and vicious with a knife to get free.</p> \n    <p>And her left hip was aching\
  \ from that landing. Time to get gone. On her left, not much more than two streets\
  \ away, the forest loomed up like a great dark wall. That's where she'd have to\
  \ hide—and climb, because a village next to a forest meant skulking beasts with\
  \ sharp teeth prowling by night.</p> \n    <p>Tantaerra dropped onto Maraskho's\
  \ oxen, her landing and swift run along them setting them to snorting, bucking,\
  \ and twisting, too. Perhaps she could get work as an ox-tamer, if—</p> \n    <p>Blast!\
  \ More soldiers were coming, hurrying down those streets she had to get through\
  \ to get to the woods, and they were alert and hard-eyed—and had spotted her already.\
  \ Keeping in formation, carrying the same long spears, and led by an officer whose\
  \ swift hand-signals were being heeded. No slouches, these soldiers. She'd not get\
  \ past them alive, unless they wanted her taken for questioning.</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ when they discovered the slave brand under her chin ...</p> \n    <p>Her escape\
  \ must be the other way, using the halted wagons of the caravan as a barrier to\
  \ these Molthuni reinforcements, and it must be <i>now</i>.</p> \n    <p>She sprang\
  \ off an ox that seemed heartily glad to be rid of her, landed with a wince, and\
  \ ran, ran as she'd never run before, keeping close to the line of wagons as she\
  \ darted along it, a racing arrow more than a thing of stealth. She could tell by\
  \ the thunder of boots and the waving spears that soldiers were running, too, on\
  \ the other side of the wagons, which meant she'd have to time this <i>just</i>\
  \ right ...</p> \n    <p>Here, and now! Where this knot of village women were standing\
  \ hands on hips gossiping, obviously sourly amused at seeing soldiers having to\
  \ run. She dug at the slits in her belt as she ran, her thumb finding the sharpened\
  \ edges of the coins she kept as handy slicers and moving on to—yes, the gold piece\
  \ that wasn't sharpened. Absalom minting. She could clearly recall the disbelieving\
  \ face of the merchant she'd plucked it from, and she was going to miss it, but—\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Blessed coin,\" she called, pitching her voice as low and loud as\
  \ she could, \"lend me some of your luck now!\"</p> \n    <p>Still running hard,\
  \ she flung it past the heads of the staring women. It rang off the side of a wagon\
  \ just beyond them, at about the time the meaning of her words sank home. Then in\
  \ almost perfect unison they turned, in a swirling of skirts, and went after the\
  \ coin.</p> \n    <p>In their wake, Tantaerra swerved out, straight away from the\
  \ line of wagons, and sprinted down a handy street ahead. Past a few hanging signs\
  \ and their shops, away from the caravan, away from the great forest. If she couldn't\
  \ reach the trees now, she'd have to wait for deep night to try for them, and in\
  \ the meantime she needed somewhere high enough that she could climb out of the\
  \ reach of spears, somewhere that was hopefully also large enough for her to hope\
  \ to hide in, on, or atop.</p> \n    <p>Which meant the watchtower she could see\
  \ ahead, standing like a stubby lance against the setting sun, and the Molthuni\
  \ military barracks attached to it.</p> \n    <p>As the old Nirmathi saying put\
  \ it: <i>When hunted by wolves, the best place to hide is among them.</i></p> \n\
  \    <p>Come to think of it, the \"wolves\" those words referred to were Molthuni\
  \ soldiers like these. Fair enough. Like a wolf, then, she would be.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ street was full of older villagers strolling to see what was going on at the caravan.\
  \ She got more than a few curious looks, but no hindrance or pursuit. And thankfully\
  \ no dogs.</p> \n    <p>Which might well mean there was something in the forest\
  \ that prowled Halidon by night, hunting such barking beasts.</p> \n    <p>Something\
  \ to mull over later, when there weren't Molthuni soldiers pelting along after her,\
  \ still far behind but waving their spears and yelling at her to stop.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Did that <i>ever</i> work? Did they really think someone running from them\
  \ would be foolish enough to stop and give up? Or that common folk who increasingly\
  \ resented the ever-increasing laws and little rules, and the heavy-booted zeal\
  \ of the crimson-coated soldiers who enforced them, would leap to catch or hinder\
  \ a fleeing fugitive?</p> \n    <p>No one was leaping in Halidon, that was for sure.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She ran past staring villager after staring villager, her hip really\
  \ starting to ache, now. Ahead, the street ended in a muddy open space in front\
  \ of a long row of empty paddocks, with the barracks looming up on her left. No\
  \ palisade or gatehouse, and no door guards, just a tall, ugly stone building with\
  \ a shake-shingled roof, various sections of it having different pitches, as the\
  \ building had been expanded over the years by builders with their own ideas of\
  \ what a barracks roof should look like. No gables, nor anything as fancy as a spire\
  \ or a turret, except the lone, square watchtower, which was wrapped around with\
  \ rotting wooden gutters sloping down from the surrounding roofs and jutting well\
  \ out into the street. Evidently it rained hard in Halidon.</p> \n    <p>Good. If\
  \ those gutters weren't too rotten, they'd be her climbing aids and help to hide\
  \ her, once she was up and—</p> \n    <p>Light flared, at the far end of the barracks.\
  \ Panting for breath, Tantaerra slowed to peer. A soldier on a ladder, his back\
  \ to her, was swinging shut the shutter of a massive, rusty hanging metal lantern\
  \ ...and starting back down to the ground.</p> \n    <p>He'd be heading this way\
  \ to light the next one, and the next. Stout bars jutted out up there beside each\
  \ lantern, the ladder hooking over them for stability. She had to get up onto the\
  \ roof, and hide in the angle where it descended to meet the watchtower, before\
  \ he—</p> \n    <p>No. Impossible.</p> \n    <p>She'd have to do this the other\
  \ way.</p> \n    <p>She raced to the streetside wall of the barracks and flattened\
  \ herself against it, just before he reached the base of the ladder.</p> \n    <p>Then\
  \ she waited, shuddering to catch her breath and trying to ignore the pursuing soldiers\
  \ getting nearer. It was dark enough now for not every idle glance to notice her,\
  \ if she kept still.</p> \n    <p>This should have been about long enough ...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She went to the ground, crawled to the corner, and peered around it,\
  \ chin almost in the dirt. The lamplighter was just settling the ladder into position\
  \ by the next lantern. She waited, in case he was one of those sightseers who liked\
  \ to take a look around every so often, but his attention was entirely on the tinderbox\
  \ slung on a loose baldric at his hip, and positioning it to avoid banging it against\
  \ himself as he climbed. He started up.</p> \n    <p>Like a small and silent wind,\
  \ Tantaerra raced to the ladder and went up it behind him, moving only when he did,\
  \ stretching with great care for silence, and keeping over on the left side, because\
  \ the tinderbox was hanging down the soldier's right side.</p> \n    <p>She waited\
  \ until he was right at the top and had swung the lantern-shutter open before climbing\
  \ up on its far side, to hang right beside his head. He was intent on striking a\
  \ striker, inside the box on a short-chain, against the box's row of flints so as\
  \ to catch sparks on a taper—a fiddly task that really needed more hands than he\
  \ had, and was consuming all of his attention save enough to mutter tunelessly,\
  \ \"She was only a shopgirl from Canorate, but she was a jewel to me ...\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Wrapping her legs around the bar that the ladder was hooked over, Tantaerra\
  \ let herself dangle head-down beside his left shoulder and pushed against the lantern\
  \ until she could murmur a provocative purr right into his ear.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  All the way from Canorate I've come, dreaming of your manly strength, and now at\
  \ <i>last</i>, lover—\"</p> \n    <p>The lamplighter stopped humming and stiffened.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tantaerra licked her lips, then planted a wet kiss on his earlobe.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The resulting startled shriek and fumbling clatter were gratifying. The\
  \ soldier's head snapped around to look, and slammed into the open lantern-shutter,\
  \ setting the lantern to swinging and the startled man to falling back—</p> \n \
  \   <p>With a sudden, arm-flailing shout, the lamplighter was gone, and the abandoned\
  \ ladder was swaying ...</p> \n    <p>The crash, below, was impressive.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Delicately, Tantaerra gave the top of the ladder the little push necessary\
  \ to send it toppling slowly over and down, then swarmed along the bar onto the\
  \ roof and clawed her way up it as hastily as she could, ending on the roof side\
  \ of the watchtower. The gutter there was in deep gloom, and sturdily wedged between\
  \ the wall just under the roof and the rising side of the watchtower. She made herself\
  \ as small and slender as she could, and snuggled down into it, prepared to become\
  \ a motionless part of the building until full night came.</p> \n    <p>The sausage\
  \ was more than a little battered, but tasted delicious.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"\
