  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June 18, 2008</p> \n    <p>So now that we sent\
  \ all our Gen Con releases off to the printer (thanks to some pretty crazy hours\
  \ worked last week), things seem weirdly calm and relaxed here at Paizo. Which is\
  \ dangerous! We don’t want to fall behind again so soon after we just got caught\
  \ up!</p> \n    <p>For my part, much of the last month has been spent buried in\
  \ Pathfinder’s Adventure Paths, so it was pretty exciting over the last week to\
  \ finally come up for air (even if that was merely to jump into another deep pool\
  \ of deadlines) to help prepare other projects for press. Like the Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ Campaign Setting hardcover.</p> \n    <p>Sweet Desna does this book look incredible!\
  \ There’s all sorts of tidbits packed into its 256 pages, from writeups for dozens\
  \ and dozens of nations and regions, to short essays on obscure facets of the world\
  \ like psionics and technology (yes, including guns!), to all sorts of new deities\
  \ ranging from minor gods like Besmara (the Pirate Queen) and Zyphus (a sort of\
  \ grim-reaper type deity) to a nice healthy selection of demon lords, archdevils,\
  \ the four horsemen, and even the angelic empyreal lords.</p> \n    <p>And while\
  \ a lot of the book is pure flavor, usable for any game system, fans of the crunch\
  \ won’t be disappointed either. Each region comes with at least one new feat, for\
  \ example, and there’s a pretty extensive section on campaign-specific weapons,\
  \ armor, and gear. There’s also five prestige classes—one of them isn’t new to readers\
  \ of Pathfinder (the Red Mantis assassin appears in this book, complete with some\
  \ errata that properly keys her spells to Charisma rather than Intelligence). The\
  \ other four prestige classes are all new, and drip with Golarion flavor. Pictured\
  \ here is the harrower, a spellcaster prestige class that draws power from the mystical\
  \ Varisian deck of cards known as the Harrow. Among other powers, a harrower gains\
  \ the ability to draw cards from her deck to power up her spells with metamagic-type\
  \ effects, and as she gains levels, she gains a bit more control over how these\
  \ effects are applied. As for what the other three prestige classes are in the book?\
  \ Well... let’s just say fans of crusaders, chroniclers, and pirates won’t be disappointed!</p>\
