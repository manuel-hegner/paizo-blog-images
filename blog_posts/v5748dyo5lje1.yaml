  \ work continues to churn around these parts, and with that, more information about\
  \ the upcoming roleplaying game has made it's way to the masses! In <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ho6eer\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">an interview with Matt Miller over at Game Informer</a>, our\
  \ own James L. Sutter divulged more details about the process behind Starfinder\
  \ (and creating this all-new core rulebook full of gameplay and setting material).\
  \ I've snagged some of the new artwork and other information (including captions\
  \ from James) to show off here, but you should check out the whole interview for\
  \ <i>all</i> of the new juicy bits.</p> \n    <p>First up is our next iconic character,\
  \ Iseph, the iconic operative!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"margin:\
  \ 15px auto;\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/IsephOperative.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/IsephOperative_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration\
  \ by Remko Troost\n     <br> <i>This is Iseph, our iconic operative. The operative\
  \ class is all about stealth, speed, and agility—whether you want to be a smuggler,\
  \ a scout, an intrusion agent, or a black-ops assassin, this is the class for you.\
  \ You'll also notice that Iseph is an android. Androids in Starfinder were originally\
  \ created by humans as servitors, but in recent centuries fought for and won independence\
  \ and recognition as full citizens of the Pact Worlds. While they have some interesting\
  \ physical properties—they don't age, they handle vacuum much better than humans,\
  \ and they have internal circuitry that glows when they're stressed—they also strive\
  \ to distinguish themselves culturally from their former oppressors. One way in\
  \ which some androids—like Iseph—do so is through the rejection of gender, which\
  \ they see as an unnecessary mark of their former bondage.</i>\n    </div> \n  \
  \  <p>Next, travelling to new worlds is a given in Starfinder—perhaps your future\
  \ galaxy-hopping group may find themselves on a journey to either Liavara or Verces\
  \ starting next summer?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"margin: 15px\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/Liavara_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> Illustration by Leon Tukker\n     <br> <i>Liavara is a gas giant, with\
  \ no solid surface at all, and those terrestrial races who come to mine its gasses\
  \ or trade with the native creatures are forced to live on massive floating arcology\
  \ platforms like this one. Much of the planet is held as a nature preserve by the\
  \ Brethedans—gelatinous dirigible-like creatures who can alter their own DNA to\
  \ produce whatever tools they need, from simple chemical compounds to tailored viruses.\
  \ What's more, the Brethedans can actively merge together to create linked consciousnesses\
  \ more intelligent and powerful than the sum of their parts, and some Brethedan\
  \ biotech corporations are actually single massive entities consisting of millions\
  \ of merged Brethedans.</i>\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/Verces_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> Illustration by Sebastien Hue\n     <br> <i>Verces is a tidally locked\
  \ world, with one side always facing the sun, the other always facing away. Civilization\
  \ exists primarily in the narrow band of habitable terrain along the terminator\
  \ line, where day meets night, and the massive cities that have grown there ring\
  \ the globe in a single massive urban sprawl. In addition to being at the forefront\
  \ of Pact World technology and industry, Verces is also the birthplace of the Stewards,\
  \ a police-like organization of warrior-diplomats sworn to maintain the Pact, who\
  \ hunt down interplanetary criminals and preserve peace between the sometimes fractious\
  \ worlds of the solar system.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>As always, keep your eye\
