  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Mavaro's\
  \ earliest childhood memories are of the silent seclusion of a Pharasmin convent\
  \ deep in the Mindspin Mountains. The boy never learned what brought his mother\
  \ to the strange cloister built among ancient standing stones, but there she had\
  \ sought refuge. The sisters' strict tutelage was the only life he knew; his only\
  \ friends the esoteric books and scrolls of the convent's great library. He spent\
  \ years in the library, devouring countless tomes to learn more of the world denied\
  \ him. </p> \n     <p>Tales of horrors stalking the cloister's corridors held Mavaro's\
  \ wanderlust in check. As he grew older, Mavaro dismissed the stories and learned\
  \ to secretly navigate the forbidden halls of the convent, where he regularly bore\
  \ witness to the nuns' strange ceremonies. One was a ritual of severe fasting and\
  \ meditation that gradually wasted the sisters' bodies. After a period of fasting,\
  \ novices would unveil a yellowed, sigil-scripted skull of the order's founding\
  \ abbess, Mother Wren. The acolytes then listened in turn for a ghostly whisper\
  \ from the skull to indicate a worthy candidate. Soon afterward, the selected nun's\
  \ sisters would rise to adorn the candidate's body, withered in self-starvation,\
  \ with strange sigils and specially cast silver talismans. They'd wrap her in fresh\
  \ linens and carry her down into a hidden, spiraling catacomb to carefully place\
  \ her among generations of similarly mummified worshipers spanning thousands of\
  \ years.</p> \n     <p>In Mavaro's twenty-second year, Varisian traders arrived\
  \ at the abbey. While the nuns took the opportunity to restock their food stores\
  \ and other essentials, Mavaro felt entranced by a wagonload of riches reclaimed\
  \ from the ruins of a stone giant temple. Tribal totems, esoteric steles, and ruined\
  \ relics of forgotten cultures all called to him—representations of a world and\
  \ cultures he'd only ever read about. When one of the traders pulled forth a strange\
  \ sword of ancient design, bearing a carved, glowering face with gleaming red gems\
  \ inset as eyes, Mavaro knew he had to obtain the treasures at whatever cost. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>But as only a lonely scribe, Mavaro had no way to pay for the items.\
  \ So he quietly stole into the forbidden catacombs where he knew the silver talismans\
  \ of the abbey's mummies lay for the taking. Little did he know, though, that the\
  \ sisters' starved bodies actually served as unwavering guardians, and with the\
  \ desecration of their remains, an evil long held in check by their sacrifice slipped\
  \ free. As the caravan trundled away from the holy ground, taking the convent's\
  \ traded relics with it, the binding magic that held the entity in check cracked\
  \ imperceptibly, and its spiritual corruption leaked forth. </p> \n     <p>The deaths\
  \ began slowly. At first they just seemed like bad luck: a broken neck from a short\
  \ fall; a drowning in the convent's well; three nuns killed in the collapse of an\
  \ old stone wall in the kitchens. But soon the malevolent presence grew more bold,\
  \ and the sisters realized something was hunting them in the quiet corridors. By\
  \ the time the prioress realized that Mavaro's pilfering had jeopardized divine\
  \ defenses centuries in the making, it was too late. One by one, the nuns were slaughtered\
  \ by the dark thing of rust and chains slipping through their midst. The quiet butcher\
  \ saved the prioress for last, possessing her body in anticipation of a long, self-inflicted\
  \ torment. But wrenching back control of her body for the briefest moment, the prioress\
  \ knocked a lantern aside and set fire to the convent in an attempt to destroy the\
  \ entity—and herself—in cleansing flame. </p> \n     <p>Though injured, the vicious\
  \ entity was not destroyed in the blaze, and only it and Mavaro survived. Desperate\
  \ to protect himself, Mavaro shifted through the smoldering ruins of the haunted\
  \ abbey, desperately collecting any holy relics he could find in hope of warding\
  \ off the lingering evil. Vestments of razor wire still glowing red, the spirit\
  \ soon found Mavaro. The young scholar would surely have faced his death, had not\
  \ the skull of Mother Wren whispered to him from the ashes. The ancient holy woman\
  \ commanded Mavaro to close his eyes and open his soul to the power of the items\
  \ he had collected. Its long fingers flicking like the lashes of a scourge, the\
  \ wicked shadow closed on the desperate youth, cooing promises of endless, barb-licked\
  \ torment. Mavaro felt the power of the relics well up inside him, and shakily reached\
  \ for the ruby-eyed blade he had purchased. Trembling, but full with strange power,\
  \ Mavaro blindly struck. </p> \n     <p>A red gem shattered in the sword's hilt\
  \ and the dark thing shrieked, flailing jangling fetters as it retreated through\
  \ the ruins. Mavaro fled the holy site as quick as he could, never looking back\
  \ at the only place he'd ever called home.</p> \n     <p>In the twenty years since,\
  \ Mavaro's life has been a strange paradox. He's now a man of many indulgences,\
  \ making up for his modest childhood with good food and raucous company. He deflects\
  \ inquiries about his youth with inconsistent but highly entertaining tales tied\
  \ in with his mysterious collection of relics and strange objects. Quietly, though,\
  \ he regularly casts one eye over his shoulder, ever watchful for the shadow he's\
  \ come to call the Thorn Priest, which stalks him still. Mavaro regularly consults\
  \ the yellowed skull of Mother Wren, heeding her ghostly whispers as he pursues\
  \ the relics he traded away long ago. His travels have taken him to markets across\
  \ Varisia, the strangest of private collections, and many dangerous, distant locales.\
  \ Still he seeks to reclaim their power, determined to undo the folly of his youth\
  \ and face the Thorn Priest once more.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Brandon\
