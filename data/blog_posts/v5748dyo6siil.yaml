  \     <blockquote>\n      <p>Continuing our series of encounters to challenge your\
  \ players, featuring creatures debuting in the forthcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ex5?Pathfinder-Monster-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em></a>, Bill Fischer takes us to the dank grotto\
  \ lair of a remastered sea hag, as depicted in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ex4?Pathfinder-FlipMat-Temples-MultiPack\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Temples Multi-Pack</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n      <h2>Eye\
  \ for an Eye — Moderate 1</h2>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Captain Blazo\
  \ Orane’s career as a notorious pirate captain was cut short when a freak storm\
  \ capsized his ship not far from the city of Riddleport. As stubborn as he was cutthroat,\
  \ Blazo went down with the ship but awakened several hours later to find himself\
  \ in the cave of a sea hag named Cyclona. The hag had spared Blazo’s life, but in\
  \ return, she demanded the captain’s eye. Blazo balked, of course—like any good\
  \ pirate, he only had one eye left to spare. Unfortunately, his captor was in no\
  \ mood for mercy. Cyclona plucked Blazo’s remaining eye from its socket, leaving\
  \ the now-blind man to bleed out while she transformed her grisly reward into a\
  \ <em>hag eye</em>.</p>\n      <p>Miraculously, Captain Blazo managed to free himself\
  \ from his shackles—striking Cyclona with his cold-iron scimitar in the struggle—\
  and stumbled his way back to Riddleport. Now, still weakened from his ordeal, Blazo\
  \ hires the PCs to retrieve his stolen eye. If the PCs express doubts Blazo will\
  \ regain his sight even if his eye is recovered, the pirate seems unconcerned. “\
  If I can’t have my eye,” he grumbles, “I’ll settle for revenge.” Blazo lends the\
  \ PCs the only thing of value he has left, his cold-iron scimitar, with the promise\
  \ they can keep the weapon if they return with his eye or proof that Cyclona is\
  \ dead.</p>\n      <p><strong>Map:</strong> This map showcases one of the maps included\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Temples Multi-Pack</em>, out this month on Paizo.com\
  \ or at your local hobby store!</p>\n      <p><strong>Approaching the Cave:</strong>\
  \ Cyclona’s cave is a half-day’s walk from Riddleport. If Blazo’s understandably\
  \ vague directions aren’t enough for the PCs, most anyone in the city can direct\
  \ them to the place.</p>\n      <p>The remnants of an ancient sea wall stretch to\
  \ Cyclona’s cave like a trail of stepping stones. Slick with algae, the wall is\
  \ uneven ground. Once during the crossing, each PC must make a successful DC 13\
  \ Acrobatics check to Balance or fall into the surf. Any PC who fails this check\
  \ alerts Cyclona to the party’s arrival, granting her a +2 circumstance bonus to\
  \ initiative. Alternatively, the PCs can approach the hag’s cave along the weed-choked\
  \ shore to the south. This approach doesn’t require skill checks, but the ground\
  \ is difficult terrain, and the party’s noisy arrival automatically alerts Cyclona.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> When the PCs arrive, Cyclona lurks in the\
  \ northern alcove, admiring an amulet set with a blue gemstone: Captain Blazo’s\
  \ eye transformed into a <em>hag eye</em>. Loath to surrender her new treasure,\
  \ Cyclona lunges at intruders, opening with her Dread Gaze before slashing with\
  \ her claws. The hag remembers all too well the bite of Blazo’s scimitar, granting\
  \ the PC holding the weapon a +1 circumstance bonus to Demoralize the hag. If reduced\
  \ to 15 Hit Points or fewer, Cyclona dives into the sea, dropping the <em>hag eye\
  \ </em>in her panic.</p>\n      <p><strong>Treasure: </strong>The PCs might not\
  \ recognize Captain Blazo’s eye in its current state, but anyone who interacts with\
  \ the amulet feels its wet, sticky surface, allowing the character to attempt to\
  \ disbelieve the illusion (DC 19). Like all <em>hag eyes</em>, the amulet produces\
  \ no direct benefit for the wearer (and doesn’t restore Blazo’s sight if given to\
  \ him), but it allows Cyclona to peer through the eye using the Seek action. Any\
  \ damage dealt to the eye destroys it. If this happens while Cyclona is looking\
  \ through it, the hag is blinded for 1 hour.</p>\n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"\

  \      <p><strong>Dread Gaze</strong> [two-actions] (curse, emotion, fear, mental,\
  \ occult) The hag gazes upon a creature, afflicting it with a gnawing sense of impending\
  \ doom, with a result depending on its Will save (DC 20). The target doesn’t need\
  \ to be able to see the sea hag.</p>\n      <p><strong>Critical Success </strong>The\
  \ creature is unaffected.<br><strong>Success </strong>The creature is frightened\
  \ 1.<br><strong>Failure </strong>The creature is frightened 1 and is slowed 1 for\
  \ 1 round. If the target was dying, it remains unconscious for 1 day. At the end\
  \ of the day, it must attempt a Fortitude save against the same DC; if it fails,\
  \ it dies.<br><strong>Critical Failure </strong>As failure, but the creature is\
  \ frightened 2 and slowed 1 for 1 minute.</p>\n      <p><strong>Sea Hag’s Bargain</strong>\
  \ (concentrate, exploration, occult, polymorph) The sea hag can make a bargain with\
  \ a willing creature who must be of sound mind. The creature gives away a special\
  \ or cherished quality—such as its courage, its beauty, or its voice. In exchange,\
  \ the sea hag spends 1 minute polymorphing the creature into a form the target desires.</p>\n\
  \      <p>This functions as Change Shape. It might be a total transformation or\
  \ just changing one or more aspects of the target’s body, and it can’t make the\
  \ creature more than one size smaller or larger. The creature changes its Speeds\
  \ as appropriate for the new form. It doesn’t change the attack and damage bonuses\
  \ with its Strikes, but it might change the damage type the Strikes deal. This has\
  \ an unlimited duration, and as long as it’s transformed, the creature is sickened\
  \ 2 and can’t reduce its sickened condition below 2. The creature can slowly and\
  \ carefully eat and drink despite being sickened. The only way to restore the lost\
  \ quality used as payment is to defeat the sea hag or make another bargain for its\
  \ return. Ending the bargain in this way also removes the transformation.</p>\n\
