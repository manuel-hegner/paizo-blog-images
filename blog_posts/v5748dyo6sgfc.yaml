  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're approaching the end of a glorious <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/starfindersociety\">Starfinder Society</a> year, and we wanted\
  \ to make sure we ended December with a narrative bang. It's amazing to look back\
  \ at everything we've accomplished. Not only did 2018 kick off with our <a href=\"\

  >introduction to morlamaws</a> (yes, it's really only been a year), but it's also\
  \ featured <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  >reality television events</a>, much-<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-114-Star-Sugar-Heartlove\"\

  >wildlife benefit fundraisers</a>. We also saw <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01va9?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-127-King-Xeros-of-Star-Azlant\"\
  >the return of an ancient starship from Pathfinder Society</a>, debuted Starfinder\
  \ Society's <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  >first multi-table interactive special</a>, and scaled up to two scenarios a month.\
  \ Needless to say, it's been a busy year, and that calls for some more fun adventures.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Hailing from the Tier 1-4 corner of the galaxy is <i><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vps?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-128-It-Rests-Beneath\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #1-28: It Rests Beneath</a></i> by Paizo editor Jason\
  \ Tondro. When Thursty and I brainstorm scenario concepts, we often look at what\
  \ themes we've featured recently to include lots of variety, and we've had a fair\
  \ number of \"Meet aliens, study aliens' culture, potentially fight aliens\" scenarios.\
  \ These are good fun, yet we realized we hadn't really let the Starfinders escape\
  \ into the unexplored wilds to study geographic features and planetary anomalies—\
  in this case a strange mesa that occupies around 85,000 square miles! You'll be\
  \ teaming up with the solitary research outpost (including Dr. Mora Motressi, illustrated\
  \ here by William Martin) and roving the rocky surface in exploration buggies in\
  \ order to perform some honest-to-goodness science—it makes my archaeologist heart\
  \ so proud. This scenario has the Faction (Wayfinders) and Vehicle tag.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Just don't expect this trip to be without its dangers! As a hint of what's\
  \ to come, I'll point out that this scenario has a cheat sheet detailing the basics\
  \ of vehicle combat for those who like that sort of thing, including how to adjudicate\
  \ landing your truck on top of an enemy creature. Also, inspired by a conversation\
  \ I had with a player at Origins, this scenario doesn't just let you play around\
  \ in borrowed exploration buggies; if you want to bring your own Large vehicle to\
  \ test out its engine on a distant world, you're welcome to do so! Get out there\
  \ and explore!</p> \n    <p>Speaking of exploring new territory, Thurston Hillman's\
  \ here to tell us about the campaign's first ever Tier 7-10 scenario.</p> \n   \
  \ <blockquote> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vpt?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-129-Honorbound-Emissaries\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #1-29: Honorbound Emissaries</i></a> is something of an all-star\
  \ special event, which is perfect for our first Tier 7-10 scenario. Beginning with\
  \ a meeting of several prominent NPCs, including two vesks from very different backgrounds\
  \ and an android we're still not quite sure of the whole story about, this scenario\
  \ brings the PCs into the aftermath of recent events in the Scoured Stars. This\
  \ confluence of major story and major NPCs was a perfect mix of content to pass\
  \ on to veteran author Jenny Jarzabski. Jenny is known in Starfinder Society circles\
  \ for the introduction of a particular NPC that players love to hate or hate to\
  \ love from<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie\"\
  > Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</a>, and that talent of making memorable\
  \ NPCs really shone through in her turnover. Luckily, I managed to beg some of Jenny's\
  \ freelance time shortly after her work on her most recent release, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya17d?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Penumbra-Protocol\"\
  >the second adventure</a> in the (soon to be sanctioned) Signal of Screams adventure\
  \ path!</p> \n     <p>While I don't want to spoil too much about this scenario,\
  \ let's just say that it sets the stage for our remaining Season 1 scenarios and\
  \ sets us on a path for a climactic event in our eventual closing interactive special\
  \ for Starfinder Society's inaugural season. OK, maybe I'll share one more thing:\
  \ a piece of artwork that I think GMs looking to run or re-run <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9wes?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-104-Cries-From-the-Drift\"\
  >a certain early season scenario</a> might find very useful! For players out there,\
  \ you may want to play this scenario if you haven't got the chance yet… it might\
  \ be useful!</p> \n     <p>This scenario has the Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi\
  \ Elsebo]) tag.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play\
