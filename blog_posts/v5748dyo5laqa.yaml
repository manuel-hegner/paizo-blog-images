  \ Stories</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, January 11, 2010</p> \n   <p>It takes\
  \ a delicate hand to do certain things in writing, especially in the realms of science\
  \ fiction and fantasy. Aside from character development, plotting, dialogue, description,\
  \ pacing, and theme, science fiction and fantasy must overcome the additional hurtle\
  \ which is world building. As an aspiring writer, I can tell you that world building\
  \ is tough. Never mind how easy the other guys here make it look. Never mind all\
  \ the wonderful freelancers we work with, or the submissions for <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\"\
  >RPG Superstar</a> or <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/submissions\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Open Call</a>—these people are all conspiring to get you to believe the lie that\
  \ world building happens at the drop of a hat.</p> \n   <p>It just doesn't work\
  \ that way.</p> \n   <p>Not to say that good world building isn't rewarding, both\
  \ for the creator and the consumer. Who can say they don't enjoy a fantastical world?\
  \ And yet, as difficult as it is to write good science fiction or fantasy, some\
  \ authors choose to take on an additional challenge; to marry the two together in\
  \ an attempt to weave a seamless narrative of swords and spaceships.</p>\n  </blockquote>\

  \   </tbody>\n  </table> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Piers Anthony's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jy\"\
  ><i>Steppe</i></a> takes on this challenge with bravado (though more sword than\
  \ spaceship), using a future simulation of the past to explore both history and\
  \ imagination. In his imagined year 2332, society revolves around the \"Game\" of\
  \ history, where players have to reenact genuinely historical battles without having\
  \ access to knowledge of that history. Literal twenty to thirty year chunks of time\
  \ are periodically erased from the society's history in order to facilitate fair\
  \ play. Enter, Alp: our Ender-Wigginesque (though created before Card was milling\
  \ about) middle-aged battle-trained warrior from a 9th century mid-Asia steppe (hence,\
  \ the title) with a really cool horse. How's that for hybridization?</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ began reading <a ref=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jy\"><i>Steppe</i></a> for a\
  \ few reasons (not least of all, the fact that a free copy of the book was among\
  \ my compensations as an unpaid intern). Additionally, having read little other\
  \ than academic theory for the past three years (graduation, you elusive tunnel\
  \ light you!), I was thrilled both by the newness of this 1976 gem, and by the fact\
  \ that all the research into <i>finding</i> the text had been done for me already;\
  \ by the wonderfully conceived <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories line</a>.\
  \ This is cultural archaeology at its finest, folks. It brings light to the shadowy\
  \ places that academic canon does not reach into. And if nothing else, it opens\
  \ us up to traditions we didn't know existed (to say nothing bad of Asimov or Clarke,\
  \ it's nice to mix things up a bit).</p> \n   <p>Therefore, I can say with certainty\
  \ that when my time here ends (and I stop getting free stuff), I'll be picking up\
  \ a <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\">Planet Stories subscription</a> for\
  \ these exact reasons.</p> \n   <p>Matthew Lund <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote>\
