  date\">Tuesday, April 12, 2011</p> \n   <p>For the next month or so, every Tuesday\
  \ we are going to be digging into some of the new rules and options you will find\
  \ in <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8g7s\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>, which is\
  \ due to release in May. This week, we'll take a look at some of the new archetypes\
  \ that take up a full 32 pages of this 256 page tome.</p> \n   <p>One of the first\
  \ things you will notice about this book is that the new classes from the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> receive archetypes\
  \ in this book (except the cavalier, who does not use magic). Here is an example\
  \ of a new alchemist archetype, the vivisectionist.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p><b>Vivisectionist (Archetype)</b><br> A vivisectionist studies bodies to better\
  \ understand their function. Unlike a chirurgeon, a vivisectionist's goals are not\
  \ related to healing, but rather to experimentation and knowledge that most people\
  \ would consider evil. A vivisectionist has the following class features.<br> <b>Sneak\
  \ Attack</b>: At 1st level, a vivisectionist gains the sneak attack ability as a\
  \ rogue of the same level. If a character already has sneak attack from another\
  \ class, the levels from the classes that grant sneak attack stack to determine\
  \ the effective rogue level for the sneak attack's extra damage dice (so an alchemist\
  \ 1/rogue 1 has a +1d6 sneak attack like a 2nd-level rogue, an alchemist 2/rogue\
  \ 1 has a +2d6 sneak attack like a 3rd-level rogue, and so on). This ability replaces\
  \ bomb.<br> <b>Torturer's Eye</b>: At 2nd level, a vivisectionist adds <i>deathwatch</i>\
  \ to his formula book as a 1st-level extract.<br> <b>Cruel Anatomist</b>: At 3rd\
  \ level, a vivisectionist may use his Knowledge (nature) skill bonus in place of\
  \ his Heal skill bonus.<br> <b>Torturous Transformation</b>: At 7th level, a vivisectionist\
  \ adds <i>anthropomorphic animal</i> to his formula book as a 2nd-level extract.\
  \ When he uses this extract, he injects it into an animal as part of a 2-hour surgical\
  \ procedure. By using multiple doses of this extract as part of the surgery, he\
  \ multiplies the duration by the number of extracts used.<br> At 9th level, a vivisectionist\
  \ adds <i>awaken</i> and <i>baleful polymorph</i> to his formula book as 3rd-level\
  \ extracts. When he uses the <i>awaken</i> and <i>baleful polymorph</i> extract,\
  \ he injects it into the target (not a plant) as part of a 24-hour surgical procedure.\
  \ He can make <i>anthropomorphic animal</i> permanent on a creature by spending\
  \ 7,500 gp.<br> At 15th level, a vivisectionist adds <i>regenerate</i> to his formula\
  \ book as a 5th-level extract.<br> <b>Bleeding Attack</b>: A vivisectionist may\
  \ select the bleeding attack rogue talent in place of a discovery.<br> <b>Crippling\
  \ Strike</b>: At 10th level or later, a vivisectionist may select the crippling\
  \ strike rogue talent in place of a discovery.<br> <b>Discoveries</b>: The following\
  \ discoveries complement the vivisectionist archetype: alchemical simulacrum*, concentrate\
  \ poison, doppelganger simulacrum*, feral mutagen, parasitic twin*, plague bomb*,\
  \ poison bomb, preserve organs*, sticky bomb, tentacle*, tumor familiar*, vestigial\
  \ arm*, and wings*.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Of course, the classes from the\
  \ <i>Core Rulebook</i> receive a number of new archetypes as well. Take a look at\
  \ the Undead Lord archetype for the cleric.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <table align=\"\

  \ height=\"9\"></td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table> \n    <p><b>Undead\
  \ Lord (Archetype)</b><br> An undead lord is a cleric focused on using necromancy\
  \ to control undead. Her flock is the walking dead and her choir the keening spirits\
  \ of the damned. This unliving congregation is the manifestation of her unceasing\
  \ love affair with death.<br> A cleric cannot take the undead lord archetype unless\
  \ her deity's portfolio includes the Death domain or a similar domain that promotes\
  \ undeath. An undead lord has the following class features.<br> <b>Death Magic</b>:\
  \ An undead lord must select the Death domain (and the Undead subdomain from the\
  \ <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>, if available in the campaign). She does not gain\
  \ a second domain. In all other respects, this works like and replaces the standard\
  \ cleric's domain ability.<br> <b>Corpse Companion (Su)</b>: With a ritual requiring\
  \ 8 hours, an undead lord can animate a single skeleton or zombie whose Hit Dice\
  \ do not exceed her cleric level. This corpse companion automatically follows her\
  \ commands and does not need to be controlled by her. She cannot have more than\
  \ one corpse companion at a time. It does not count against the number of Hit Dice\
  \ of undead controlled by other methods. She can use this ability to create a variant\
  \ skeleton such as a bloody or burning skeleton, but its Hit Dice cannot exceed\
  \ half her cleric level. She can dismiss her companion as a standard action, which\
  \ destroys it.<br> <b>Bonus Feats</b>: All undead lords gain Command Undead as a\
  \ bonus feat. In addition, at 10th level, she may select one of the following as\
  \ a bonus feat: Channel Smite, Extra Channel, Improved Channel, Quick Channel, Skeleton\
  \ Summoner*, Undead Master*.<br> <b>Unlife Healer (Su)</b>: At 8th level, the undead\
  \ lord's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used to heal undead\
  \ heal an extra 50% damage. At 16th level, these effects automatically heal the\
  \ maximum possible damage for the effect + the extra 50%. This does not stack with\
  \ abilities or feats such as Empower Spell or Maximize Spell.</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p style=\"clear:both;\">Well, that about wraps up this week. Next week,\
  \ we will take a look at the magus. Before I go, here is one last bit to get you\
  \ excited for this book. A complete list of all the archtypes found in <i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i> (except for those sneaky magus archetypes, I'll save those for next\
  \ week). Each one of these classes has other rules bits associated with them as\
  \ well, but we will talk about those in a future blog. Enjoy.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
