  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to \"The Worldwound Incursion\", the first\
  \ adventure of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>. (I think I just about used up my allotment\
  \ of capital letters there, but I'll try to soldier on.)</p> \n    <p><i><b>Note:</b>\
  \ This blog post, including previewed cards, features substantial spoilers of the\
  \ plot and events in the first installment of the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ Path. Please tread carefully if you plan to play through the Pathfinder RPG version\
  \ of the story, or if you like to be surprised by turns of event in the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game.</i></p> \n    <p>When you get your Wrath box, you'll get\
  \ the first adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\">along with the shiny new rulebook\
  \ you can grab from the product page</a>. It includes all the knowledge you'll need\
  \ to defeat the scenarios in the base set and begin your journey through the Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous adventure path. Those of you who are interested in <a href=\"\
  /pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> will also want to grab your\
  \ copy of the new <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild Guide</em></a> so you can start playing the first scenario of the Season\
  \ of the Righteous when it's released to stores next Wednesday.</p> \n    <p>If\
  \ you're one of the lucky subscribers who has already received your <em>Wrath</em>\
  \ box, you've hopefully sharpened your skills on the introductory base set scenarios.\
  \ Once you've done that, you're ready to begin the journey set forth in the Adventure\
  \ Path. This is where the story truly starts: the Fall of Kenabres.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-FallOfKenabres.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-FallOfKenabres_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>Have a nice trip!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Remember Khorramzadeh\
  \ from my <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhc3\">previous blog post</a>? He's a demon\
  \ lord that destroys the city of Kenabres, decapitating the silver dragon Terendelev\
  \ in the process. You get to use him here by shuffling him into the blessings deck\
  \ as he rampages through the dying city.</p> \n    <p>Did you think we would make\
  \ you encounter him in Adventure 1? We aren't that cruel, but does show up again\
  \ in <i>[Mike: NOPE!]</i> though. Each time he pops out of the blessings deck, he\
  \ shakes things up and throws some fire around before popping right back into the\
  \ deck, only to show up more and more as the deck dwindles away. You better hurry!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Want to know what happens next? The rest of the adventure involves falling\
  \ into the underground, fighting your way back to the surface, rallying the survivors\
  \ in the town, assaulting the demons in their base, and finally stealing back the\
  \ wardstone they shattered to breach the Worldwound in the first place. Fortunately\
  \ for you, the wardstone still has some juice left.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-WardstoneFragment.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-WardstoneFragment_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>All we need is some Krazy Glue and some time.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <h2>Running Themes</h2> \n    <p>You'll notice a couple of new features\
  \ as you play through this adventure. The first is the set of cohorts you'll have\
  \ available. One of the themes in <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> is the importance\
  \ of NPCs, both good and bad. You'll see these faces again and again, and you'll\
  \ come to depend on them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Anevia.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Anevia_180.jpeg\"></a> <a\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Horgus_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>We get by with a little help from our friends.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>There's one other thing to notice about some of these cohorts. Take a\
  \ closer look at the phrases on them, such as \"if you have a role card.\" This\
  \ is our tricky way of making them more powerful as the game progresses.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Another thing you'll note are the Scales. When the Storm King slew the silver\
  \ dragon Terendelev, her dying gift to the characters was her scales. The party\
  \ can choose one of them as loot at the end of each of these scenarios. However,\
  \ there's only one of each type, so players must decide who will wield them. I suggest\
  \ single combat!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ScaleOfCloudwalking.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br><i>Not to scale. BOOM.</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Bring on the Demons!</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>As promised, the demons start ramping up a bit, and a few new ones are\
  \ introduced here.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Faxon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Faxon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-DemonicFly.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-DemonicFly_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-WreckerDemon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-WreckerDemon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>All demons chosen based on their good looks and excellent senses\
  \ of humor.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Faxon is the villain for the fourth scenario,\
  \ and he's nasty. Everyone has to recharge all of their healing when he pops up,\
  \ and it costs you cards to play cards against him. Even when you win, you'll have\
  \ to pay a high price.</p> \n    <p>Don't get me started on the Demonic Fly. I hate\
  \ that thing. It's tough to beat, and if you don't, it goes and messes up someone\
  \ else's plans. And the Wrecker Demon is even tougher, and he takes out your items,\
  \ and he's ugly, too.</p> \n    <h2>Everyone Loves a Mutt</h2> \n    <p>The mongrels\
  \ are a group of patchwork mutants living under the city. They also make a strong\
  \ showing here, both as monsters and allies.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MongrelTraitor.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MongrelTraitor_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MongrelArcher.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-MongrelArcher_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>Whose side are you on?!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Their defining\
  \ characteristic is their random nature. You'll have to pull a card from the box\
  \ to see how difficult they are to defeat or acquire. I love this variation on the\
  \ Veteran trait. As you add more powerful cards to the box in later adventures,\
  \ encountering the mongrels is going to get tougher as well.</p> \n    <h2>One Last\
  \ Cool Thing</h2> \n    <p>There's a sword you'll find in this set called Radiance.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Radiance.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Radiance_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>Well, it isn't glowing blue, so at least there aren't any orcs\
  \ around.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>In the adventure path, Radiance is just a simple\
  \ sword that you find early on, but as you perform brave deeds, more of its abilities\
  \ unlock, and it grows along with the characters. You'll see more about how we are\
  \ doing this in a really cool way in adventure...</p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\"><i>Mike:\
  \ And I think that about does it for this blog! Paul will be released from his dungeon\
  \ in a month to preview adventure 2, if he can prove he can keep his mouth shut.</i></p>\
