  > \n    <p>Hello, Pathfinders. Today's blog is a grab bag of PFSACG updates from\
  \ me and designer Keith Richmond about Season of the Righteous, Season of the Runelords,\
  \ and more!</p> \n    <h2>Season of the Righteous Story Update</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">It was a long ride over heaps and hordes of demons (and probably more\
  \ than a few brave crusaders), but Season of the Righteous is finally coming to\
  \ its glorious end. Let's recap the story so far with a <i>whole lot of spoilers</i>:</p>\
  \ \n    <h3><a href=\"/products/btpy9ewl\">Adventure 1-1: Herald's Chosen</a></h3>\
  \ \n    <p>The Herald of Iomedae, also known as the Hand of the Inheritor, has divined\
  \ that demons are up to no good. (When are they not?) The Herald chose the best\
  \ and brightest crusaders available (plus maybe a Darago or two who snuck in). You\
  \ cleared the fortress city of Kenabres of a gathering horde (herd? stampede?) of\
  \ fiendish minotaurs, as well as a gaggle of demon-summoning, polymorphing witches.\
  \ You then cut your way past the Fiendish Tree ruler of Storasta to save Fort Clearwater\
  \ from demonic invasion—and from itself. By the end of the adventure, you were not\
  \ only granted mythic power for your deeds, but you were hot on the trail of an\
  \ obvious trap, and the Herald <i>totally</i> knew how to safely spring it.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0101A-Herald.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0101A-Herald_180.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \    <br> <i>Iomedae chose her Herald for his wisdom and good judgment.</i> \n \
  \   </div> \n    <h3><a href=\"/products/btpy9fkd\">Adventure 1-2: War for the Worldwound</a></h3>\
  \ \n    <p>Sound the horns, beat the drums, and let sing the tenors of war! With\
  \ a Rallying Cry, and over the bodies of a few (or more than a few) demonic mongrels,\
  \ you gathered a powerful army to your side. You led them fearlessly against armies\
  \ of cultists, undead, and demons in order to reach Raliscrad. But the Herald's\
  \ confidence proved to be hubris: he sprung the demons' trap and was somehow spirited\
  \ away. Even as you did all you could to keep your army alive, the wardstone in\
  \ Kenabres shattered. You laid waste to armies of evil, but the demonic hordes are\
  \ seemingly endless. With the loss of Kenabres, the line of wardstones, and the\
  \ Herald, have you already lost the war?</p> \n    <h3><a href=\"/products/btpy9g8v\"\
  >Adventure 1-3: Lexicon of Paradox</a></h3> \n    <p>You got together with the hero-studded\
  \ cast from Dave Gross's <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"><em>King of Chaos</em></a>\
  \ to try and track down the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i>, an artifact rumored to hold\
  \ the secret to closing the Worldwound. Dispatching a trio of hags and the sangudaemon\
  \ Ommors, you made your way to Undarin, stronghold of the Worldwound's creator.\
  \ Kasiya, a powerful vampire, thwarted your plans to stealthily retrieve the Lexicon,\
  \ but at Greengrove Keep you thwarted him quite permanently. The succubus Yavalliska\
  \ used the moment of chaos to seize the power of the Lexicon to become a god, but\
  \ she was also vanquished, though at horrible cost...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ </div> \n    <h3><a href=\"/products/btpy9h4s\">Adventure 1-4: The Mighty and\
  \ the Righteous</a></h3> \n    <p>Though your comrades thought you dead, you know\
  \ that no righteous hero would be kept down by merely being hurled into the Abyss.\
  \ After a rocky descent, you acclimated to the chaos and horror of the place. It\
  \ wasn't a pretty picture, but you learned of a way back through the Worldwound.\
  \ It took a mighty show of force, and you had to play some of the demons off against\
  \ each other, but you returned to Mendev.</p> \n    <h3><a href=\"/products/btpy9h4t\"\
  >Adventure 1-5: Herald's Vengeance</a></h3> \n    <p>It was finally time to get\
  \ some payback for the kidnapped Herald of Iomedae. You cut a wide swath through\
  \ the Worldwound and defeated horrors that have plagued the area for centuries,\
  \ including the Herald's 12-armed kidnapper. You then rushed off to rescue both\
  \ the Queen and the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i> from a plague of shadow demons and\
  \ from Khorramzadeh himself.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Didn't think we'd make you wait until adventure 6 to fight him,\
  \ did you?</i> \n    </div> \n    <h3><a href=\"/products/btpy9hw5\">Adventure 1-6:\
  \ The Last Crusade</a></h3> \n    <p>At long last, your quest comes to an end. At\
  \ the head of an army of crusaders, you smashed your way through to Undarin. Along\
  \ the way, you completed a number of quests, including joining the Pathfinder Society\
  \ to free Jormurdun. Areelu Vorlesh was busy performing a ritual to hurl all of\
  \ Golarion into the Rasping Rifts, so you kicked her out of Undarin. True heroes\
  \ are rarely content to rest on their laurels, so you went down and punched Deskari\
  \ in the nose a few times to get his attention.</p> \n    <p>With Deskari defeated\
  \ and the Worldwound closed, now it's time for a long break. Right?</p> \n    <h3><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9ikn\">Scenario 1-P: Dread Lord Rising</a></h3> \n    <p>Surprise!\
  \ It ain't over yet—we've snuck in a special bonus scenario that can only be played\
  \ by characters that have gained the reward from the Season of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ Path. This time it's all about you (and whether you get eaten).</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ you defeated Deskari, he cashed in a favor with his father Pazuzu and set the\
  \ more powerful demon prince of the air on your trail. After all, Pazuzu is hungry\
  \ for power and you're positively dripping with the stuff.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ proof of your mythic might, your reward is the everlasting favor of Iomedae: access\

  \ for you. We just can't stop coming up with delicious ways to take the game we've\
