  /paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> is just a few days away, and Pathfinder Society will be\
  \ there in full force! Let's take a look at what's debuting that the convention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The first is <a href=\"/products/btpy9rev?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-820-Torrents-Last-Will\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-20: Torrent's Last Will</em></a>, a Tier 7-11\
  \ adventure that continues the our ongoing Plane of Water storyline that began with\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9reu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-819-Treacherous-Waves\"\
  ><em>Treacherous Waves</em></a>. A sahuagin warlord has captured a powerful artifact\
  \ that threatens the Society and its allies. In this adventure by Cole Kronewitter,\
  \ the PCs embark on an expedition into the dangerous depths of the Plane of Water,\
  \ in the process teaming up with undine soldiers and a haughty brine dragon. Whereas\
  \ some of Season 8's adventures have kept to the safer corners of their respective\
  \ elemental planes, \"Torrent's Last Will\" makes the most of its aquatic setting\
  \ in terms of hazards, encounters, and locations. Pack your swim trunks!</p> \n\
  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">The Pathfinder Society recently won the Sargava\
  \ Chalice in the eponymous footrace, but few know that the trophy cup is actually\
  \ a cyclops relic dating back to Ghol-Gan. In <a href=\"/products/btpy9s14?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-821-Champions-Chalice-Part-2-Agents-of-the-Eye\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-21: Champion's Chalice, Part 2: Agents of the\
  \ Eye</em></a>, the PCs carry the chalice deep into the Kaava Lands, where the relic\
  \ can grant them a unique window into the past and a fallen empire. Author Nicholas\
  \ Herold takes us to a long-forgotten corner of Golarion's history in this Tier\
  \ 1-5 scenario, and it's up to the PCs to avert an imminent crisis with the help\
  \ of desperate allies.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \     <p>PaizoCon is also one of our most popular times to release special events,\
  \ and this year we're doing something a little different with some very familiar\
  \ aspects. On its surface, <a href=\"/products/btpy9s15/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99: The Solstice Scar</em></a> is a multi-table\
  \ interactive special like many that have come before, including ways in which individual\
  \ tables can contribute to the entire event's goals and affect neighboring groups.\
  \ In terms of structure, though, it's a very different beast. Whereas past interactive\
  \ specials have been central to a season's storyline and never changed, \"The Solstice\
  \ Scar\" is what I've referred to as a modular specialâ€”a special event whose pieces\
  \ we can swap out. What you'll have a chance to play at PaizoCon, Gen Con, and later\
  \ conventions is Version A, which consists of three 90-minute parts of the ongoing\
  \ story (Parts 1, 2, and 3). Around the beginning of 2018 (we're still nailing down\
  \ an exact date), we're going to swap out one of the parts, introduce Part 4, and\
  \ re-release the adventure as Version B. Not only does Version B advance the story,\
  \ but it's also playable for credit again as though it were a completely new adventure!\
  \ We'll be releasing several version over the coming seasons, providing events worldwide\
  \ a regularly updated special event that they can offer mid-season.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ a strange new format, we needed a tested author who's handled strange assignments\
  \ before. Andrew Hoskins took the challenge and has written the first four parts\
  \ of the adventure, beginning with an incident in the Blakros Museum and spiraling\
  \ into an epic journey across Avistan to study an ancient Kellid ritual, uncover\
  \ a forgotten chapter of the Shining Crusade, and do battle with a truly reprehensible\
  \ evil. I look forward to joining you in its debut on Sunday night at PaizoCon!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Speaking of PaizoCon, the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild represent only a fraction of what's going on this\
  \ weekend. We'll be announcing Season 9's name and theme at the PaizoCon Preview\
  \ Banquet on Saturday night. Immediately afterward, I'm hosting the much-beloved\
  \ post-banquet trivia contest, whose prizes include gift certificates, the acclaim\
  \ of your peers, and ample opportunities to troll me by writing weird answers to\
  \ questions (an equally beloved tradition). If you'd rather ask questions than answer\
  \ them, you should also attend the Organized Play Q&amp;A panel from 5-6 pm on Sunday.\
  \ The whole team will be there to answer your burning questions about Season 9,\
  \ Starfinder Society, and much more!</p> \n     <p>Beyond that, watch for us in\
  \ the halls. We're happy to chat about our work, your experiences, freelance work\
  \ opportunities, and what could happen in future adventures. After all, the modular\
  \ special concept came out of a conversation Linda and I had while hanging out in\
  \ the Sagamore Ballroom, and Thurston and I figured out a major portion of Season\
  \ 8's plotline while having a chat at the Paizo booth at Gen Con. Who knows what\
  \ great things we could brainstorm this weekend.</p> \n     <p>See you there!</p>\
