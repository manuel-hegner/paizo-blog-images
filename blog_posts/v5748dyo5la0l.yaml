  \ Favorites</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 29, 2008</p> \n   <p>For\
  \ me, trying to pick a favorite author in the <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet\
  \ Stories</a> line is like trying to pick my favorite child: impolite, but still\
  \ totally doable. (At least, I presume that's what the expression means—I don't\
  \ have kids.) And while each of my literary children is a unique and beautiful snowflake,\
  \ for me, the favorite is Leigh Brackett. </p> \n   <p>It's not just because she\
  \ was a master of many genres, writing everything from westerns to sword and planet\
  \ to hard-boiled detective stories like the screenplay for the noir classic <i>The\
  \ Big Sleep</i>, which she co-wrote with William Faulkner. Nor is it because she\
  \ was a woman writing during the pulp era, a time when females in the SF world were\
  \ darn-near unheard of. (Even though I'm probably wrong, I still imagine her and\
  \ C. L. Moore with sleeves rolled up, <a href=\"http://archive.ccm.edu/rosie/images/WeCanDoItPoster%5B1%5D.jpg\"\
  >Rosie-the-Riveter</a>-style, banging away at their typewriters as they ushered\
  \ in a horde of young female authors-to-be.) Nor is it even because she wrote the\
  \ original script to <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, possibly the finest space opera\
  \ ever filmed, and easily the most satisfying installment of a groundbreaking trilogy.\
  \ (Being too young to remember it first-hand, I can only imagine the shock those\
  \ first audiences must have felt when the film ended with Han trapped in carbonite\
  \ and Luke minus a hand. Coming on the heels of a traditional fairy-tale plot like\
  \ A New Hope, think of what guts it must have taken to write that kind of dark,\
  \ brooding cliff-hanger ending!) </p> \n   <p>No, the reason Leigh Brackett is my\
  \ favorite <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a> author to date is simple:\
  \ her words. While Catherine Moore may have beat her to the punch by a few years,\
  \ and has a definite florid charm of her own, Brackett stands out with just how\
  \ <i>modern</i> her work feels. In reading <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdr\"><i>The\
  \ Ginger Star</i></a>, the first of Brackett's Eric John Stark books set on the\
  \ planet Skaith, I'm constantly struck by the smooth flow of her prose, the way\
  \ it slips cleanly through your mind and leaves nothing behind but an image. There's\
  \ a school of thought that says the best sort of writing is invisible, work in which\
  \ the author herself disappears and you're left with only the story. Brackett obviously\
  \ understood that. And what ideas she presents! The intentionally mutated Children\
  \ of the Sea and Children of Skaith-Our-Mother, humans who sought to avoid their\
  \ planet's apocalypse by returning to the embrace of the sea and the subterranean\
  \ realms. The Corn King and his masked men of the northern towers, who worship only\
  \ hunger and cold. Even the psychic wolves that guard the citadel of the Lords Protector,\
  \ who kill by projecting paralyzing fear into the minds of their prey. Ideas like\
  \ these flow fast and furious in her books, and it was these flights of fancy that\
  \ ultimately inspired so many. </p> \n   <p>And if my own reasons aren't enough\
  \ to convince you that <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdr\"><i>The Ginger Star</i></a>\
  \ is worth checking out, consider this: Many years ago, at the height of her career,\
  \ Ms. Brackett was sought out by a young author named Ray Bradbury in search of\
  \ a mentor, and was taken on as her protégé. He's said himself that he learned much\
  \ about the craft of writing at the feet of her and her husband, Edmond Hamilton.\
  \ Which leads me to ask: who are we to argue with Ray's taste?</p> \n   <p> James\
