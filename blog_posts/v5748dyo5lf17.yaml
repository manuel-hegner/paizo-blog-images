  \ Side of Golarion</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 20, 2013</p> \n\
  \    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>In the forthcoming\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/campaignSetting\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting</a>\
  \ volume, <a href=\"/products/btpy90q7\"><i>Mythic Realms</i></a>, we present a\
  \ lot of setting-specific options for campaigns using the mythic rules found in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywe\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures</i></a>. Whether\
  \ you're characters with mythic tiers or simply high-level, non-mythic adventurers,\
  \ there's something here to add a touch of the mythic to your journeys through Golarion.</p></span>\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Fabio Gorla\n     </div> \n     <p>In\
  \ the first section of the book, we present a number of founts of mythic power.\
  \ These are locations within the setting that are imbued with mythic power and from\
  \ which characters can gain access to specific path abilities. Among these mythic\
  \ founts are the Mordant Spire, the Cenotaph, the Doorway to the Red Star, and even\
  \ the <i>Starstone</i>. While the book doesn't detail the challenges a hopeful must\
  \ overcome to reach the <i>Starstone</i>, it does explain how this mysterious meteorite\
  \ became the apotheosis catalyst it has become, and gives GMs and players unique\
  \ powers to use as their characters ascend to the ranks of the gods.</p> \n    \

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Fabio Gorla\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ second chapter of the book presents a variety of mythic adventuring locations,\
  \ including the Pit of Gormuz, Mechitar, and the Valashmai Jungle. Each location\
  \ receives four pages of gazetteer as well as a regional map, with enough information\
  \ to give GMs running campaigns in the area plenty of adventure hooks and challenging\
  \ foes to run entire campaigns. We also provide suggested mythic trials GMs can\
  \ seed into campaigns in each location to allow characters adventuring within to\
  \ gain mythic tiers as they face the seemingly insurmountable challenges presented\
  \ in each spot.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9262OldMageJatembe.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Yuriy Georgiev\n     </div> \n  \
  \   <p>Finally, the book concludes with a whole chapter on some of the setting's\
  \ most iconic mythic characters. Inside, you'll find statistics for such NPCs and\
  \ monsters as the Whispering Tyrant (CR 26), Old-Mage Jatembe (CR 24), Raskineya,\
  \ the Dark Comet (CR 16), and the Oliphaunt of Jandelay (CR 30). These characters\
  \ and the rest presented in the book play large roles in the setting and many within\
  \ the specific locations presented elsewhere in the book.</p> \n     <p>All combined,\
  \ GMs wishing to run mythic adventures set in the world of Golarion beyond the Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous Adventure Path should find this book among the most helpful aids\
  \ in putting together such a campaign. And those interested in the secrets and lore\
  \ of Golarion would be hard-pressed to find another single 64-page volume we've\
  \ published that contained more long-awaited big reveals of some of Golarion's most\
  \ talked-about features than <a href=\"/products/btpy90q7\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: Mythic Realms</i></a>.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
