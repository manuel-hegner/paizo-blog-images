  >Meet the Iconics: Seelah</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, December 17, 2007</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Although still viewed by many theologians\
  \ and traditionalists as a newcomer to the world's faiths, Iomedae the Inheritor\
  \ seems poised for greatness among the divine. Certainly her numerous orders of\
  \ paladins have risen swiftly to take on the vaunted role of paragon in many societies.\
  \ Evangelical in their exuberance to spread word of her wisdom, Iomedae's missionaries\
  \ were pivotal in the defense during the fabled Siege of Solku. They sacrificed\
  \ their lives saving the town from gnoll slavers, and although none of them survived\
  \ the siege, their presence lived on. Particularly in the eyes of young Seelah.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Seelah's family came to the walled town of Solku as pilgrims fleeing\
  \ the atrocities of distant Geb to the distant south. Unfortunately, they traded\
  \ one peril for another, and within months of their settling in Solku, the gnolls\
  \ of White Canyon began their infamous pillaging. Seelah's parents were slain in\
  \ the first of these raids, leaving her orphaned at the age of 14 in a strange town.\
  \ She did what she must to survive on the city streets, pickpocketing and bullying\
  \ and even hiring herself out as a mercenary. When a group of Iomedae's knights\
  \ arrived to defend Solku, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining\
  \ armor, and within an hour she had stolen a particularly fine mithral helm with\
  \ a golden bird upon its brow. Yet then, something strange happened—Seelah became\
  \ overwhelmed with guilt at her theft. For days, she agonized over the act, trying\
  \ (and failing) several times to pawn the helm. During the Battle of Red Hail, Seelah\
  \ realized that one of the bravest knights, a woman named Acemi with hair in long\
  \ braids, fought the battle without her helm. This was the woman's undoing—in holding\
  \ Solku's gates, she took a mortal wound to the skull from a gnoll's flail. The\
  \ woman's heroism carried the day, but that evening she died of her wound.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Wracked with guilt, Seelah approached Acemi's body as her companions prepared\
  \ for her pyre. They watched silently as Seelah placed the stolen helm over the\
  \ dead woman's head, and then climbed onto the pyre aside her to join her in death.\
  \ The paladins were moved beyond words—they had known from the start that Seelah\
  \ had stolen the helm, but Acemi had forbidden her brothers and sisters from collecting\
  \ it, hoping that the helm would bring the desperate orphan enough money to survive\
  \ for another few months. The knights of Iomedae took Seelah in that night. Although\
  \ she has come to terms with Acemi's death, Seelah still regrets the theft that\
  \ ironically brought her into Iomedae's arms. She originally came to Iomedae out\
  \ of guilt, but in the past several years, that guilt has transformed into a powerful\
  \ love and faith in the Inheritor.</p> \n    <p>The young paladin wears her hair\
  \ in Acemi's style and is trained in the use of the longsword. In so doing, she\
  \ hopes to carry on the good work that Acemi might have done had she not fallen\
  \ at the Battle of Red Hail. It's the least she feels she can do to make up for\
  \ a death that she allowed to happen.</p> \n    <p>Seelah debuts as a pregenerated\
  \ character in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7zdb\">volume 7 of <i>Pathfinder</i></a>\
  \ and in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdk\"><i>GameMastery Module W2: River Into Darkness</i></a>.</p>\
