  alt: "Hellknight Plate, Item 2. Uncommon, Bulwark. Price 35 gp; Usage worn armor;\
    \ Bulk 4; AC Bonus +6; Dex Cap +0; Check Penalty –3; Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength\
    \ 18; Type Heavy; Group Plate. Few armors in the entire Inner Sea region are as\
    \ memorable as the iconic Hellknight plate. While each order has their own flourishes,\
    \ Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights.\
    \ Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands\
    \ on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, as the armor\
    \ is functionally similar to full plate."

    \ Necromancy, Positive. Frequency once per day. You call out to the Godclaw to\
    \ heal your allies. You cast the three-action version of heal, heightened to a\
    \ level 1 lower than half your level rounded up. You can select up to four creatures\
    \ in the area to remain unaffected by the spell. You can instead use this ability\
    \ to bring a creature within 30 feet that has died within the last round back\
    \ from the dead. If you do, the creature is restored to 1 hit point and is doomed\
    \ 1 for 24 hours."

    \ spellcasting class feature, Hellknight Armiger Dedication, lawful alignment,\
    \ member of a Hellknight order, passed the Hellknight Test. You have bolstered\
    \ your force of will with the power of the Measure and the Chain. Upon initiation,\
    \ you receive a signifier mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other decorative features.\
    \ The mask doesn’t obscure your vision, though it makes it impossible for others\
    \ to see your eyes. While wearing your signifer’s mask, you gain +1 circumstance\
    \ bonus to Deception checks to Lie, Intimidation checks, and Deception DCs against\
    \ Sense Motive. You gain expert proficiency in Intimidation (or in another skill\
    \ in which you’re trained of your choice if you were already an expert in Intimidation)\
    \ as well as in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. Special:\
    \ You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats\
    \ from the Hellknight signifer or Hellknight armiger archetypes."
