  date\">Sunday, August 19, 2007</p> \n   <p>The end is upon us!</p> \n   <p>Gen Con\
  \ has come to a close and we're a bizarre blend of happy and sad to see it stop.\
  \ We're happy to finally be off our feet and sipping cold drinks by the pool and\
  \ sad to leave behind a throng of interesting and fun readers, fans, and gamers\
  \ as we make our way back home tomorrow.</p> \n   <p>Sunday is the day of last resort\
  \ as attendees cram the show floor to buy everything that piqued their curiosity\
  \ the days before. Our booth has seen steady business all day and the early indicators\
  \ are that this will be the best Gen Con Paizo has ever had.</p> \n   <p>Paizo Publishing\
  \ had the distinct honor to sponsor Nick Logue's Iron DM event last night. Yesterday's\
  \ blog was written before the Iron DM finale and we were excited to present awards\
  \ to the runners up as well as the grand prize to Iron Dungeon Master \"Ancient\
  \ Sensei,\" an amazing DM who came in second place last year (by two-tenths of a\
  \ point on their grading scale) and just edged out the winner of the past two Iron\
  \ DM events, Iron Dungeon Master \"Dreads.\" This year's ingredients were river\
  \ rapids, Rakshasas, and redemption; \"Ancient Sensei\" did not disappoint with\
  \ his first-hour TPK followed by a trip to hell where his players had to redeem\
  \ themselves to return to life. Paizo was proud to give the top three Iron DMs a\
  \ pile of GameMastery goodness, including autographed copies of GameMastery Modules\
  \ D1 and W1. Ancient Sensei also received Paizo's \"secret\" prizes which included\
  \ a copy of D2: Seven Swords of Sin autographed by nearly every Paizo employee who\
  \ wrote a room for the module, and a huge sword donated by <a href=\"http://kingofswords.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">KingofSwords.com</a>. You can learn more about Nick Logue's\
  \ Iron DM by visiting <a href=\"http://www.irondm.com\" target=\"_blank\">irondm.com</a>.\
  \ We can't wait to sponsor this event again next year!</p> \n   <p>I can hear the\
  \ angelic sounds of gaming through my hotel room door so I must heed the call and\
  \ hastily beat a path to dice rolling. I hope you've enjoyed my four-day look into\
  \ the Gen Con experience from the eyes of Paizo Publishingâ€”it was fun to put together,\
  \ so I hope it was fun to read.</p> \n   <p>Until next year! </p>\n   <p>Joshua\
