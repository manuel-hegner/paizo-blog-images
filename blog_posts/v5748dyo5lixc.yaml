  >Everyone knows that the surest way to improve the quality of any tabletop game\
  \ is to invite the wholesome goodness* of goblins into your home, and your heart**.\
  \ For this year's Free RPG Day, Paizo did just that, by delivering the whimsical\
  \ prequel to our <em>We Be Goblins</em> series of adventures: <a href=\"/products/btpy9j4r\"\
  ><em>We B4 Goblins</em></a>. This lighthearted coming-of-age tale takes your players\
  \ back in time to adolescence of our iconic goblin heroes***, where they can help\
  \ these young adventurers reach adulthood by claiming their toads and joining in\
  \ on their very first raid in a scenario ideal for introducing new players!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And now, <a href=\"/products/btpy9j4r\"><em>We B4 Goblins</em></a> is\
  \ available to YOU free of charge on your paizo.com account!</p> \n    <p>As happens\
  \ alarmingly often with these adorable*** little tykes, we have more goblins than\
  \ can reasonably fit in the space provided! So for those of you who plan to run\
  \ a table with five or six players, we have two brand new goblin characters for\
  \ your PCs to test drive: the warchanter-in-training Bisbee, and the ever-lovable\
  \ Smuz, who so obviously a goblin that you shouldn't even consider the possibility\
  \ that he might not be. Because, I mean, come on.</p> \n    <p>These two little\
  \ champions are ready to join Reta, Mogmurch, Chuffy, and Poog as they brave the\
  \ world for the very first time! Visit your friendly local game store today, and\
  \ print out these handy companions to join your own game today!</p> \n    <p style=\"\
