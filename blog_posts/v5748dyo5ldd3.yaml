  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Hell or High Water</h1> \n   <p>by Ari Marmell</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter One: Death, Debt, Doubt</h2> \n   <p>The first of the charau-ka\
  \ died before he knew he was in danger.</p> \n   <p>The huntress had tracked the\
  \ apes and the traitor from the kraal of the Imjaka, through towering boles and\
  \ curtains of hanging vines; across mattresses of leaves and fungi-infested soils\
  \ that greedily retained the prints of passersby. Those who had hunted alongside\
  \ her had long since turned back, unwilling to press so far from home.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>But she would not turn back. The traitor Okamsi had been her friend; that made\
  \ the tribe's vengeance her responsibility.</p> \n   <p>When she caught up to the\
  \ baboon-faced, musk-and-feces-perfumed ape-things, they had halted beneath a thick\
  \ canopy of branches, apparently arguing in their hooting, grunting language. They\
  \ numbered three, which worried the huntress—not because she feared such odds, but\
  \ because they had numbered <i>five</i>, plus Okamsi, when they'd first set out.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So where had the others gone?</p> \n   <p>She watched, wary of some snare\
  \ or deception, but eventually the argument came to an end. The trio of charau-ka\
  \ prepared to set out once more, and still no sign of the missing.</p> \n   <p>Time,\
  \ then, to put her doubts aside.</p> \n   <p>Spears hissed through the canopy, shredding\
  \ clusters of leaves. The first, a light and springy thing with a broad head of\
  \ iron, sank into the back of the first ape-man, followed almost instantly by the\
  \ second. Spears three and four were in the air, seeking fresh targets, before the\
  \ perforated charau-ka had crumpled to the loam.</p> \n   <p>Hooting and screeching,\
  \ the remaining simian warriors leapt aside, allowing the missiles to sink harmlessly\
  \ into the earth. Hauling thick, knotted cudgels from the leather harnesses that\
  \ were their only garb, they spun to face their unseen attacker. One slammed his\
  \ club to the earth, shrieking in challenge. The other leapt for the branches, dangling\
  \ by one hand and one prehensile foot, sniffing at the air.</p> \n   <p>Fleet as\
  \ the jaguar, agile as the gibbon, the huntress leapt from the cover of the trees.\
  \ She was a lithe, wiry figure, her skin darker and richer than the fertile soils\
  \ on which she stood, marred only by the faded scars of an old burn spread unevenly\
  \ across her left shoulder and her neck. Other than the white of her eyes and teeth,\
  \ the only brighter hue in either her garb or her complexion came from a lion-skin\
  \ kilt, partially slit so as not to impede her steps. From a belt of cowhide hung\
  \ her quiver of throwing spears, and a pair of empty sheaths.</p> \n   <p>In each\
  \ hand she held the former occupants of those sheaths: her faithful mambeles, wicked\
  \ crescents of iron, almost like sickles with extra blades protruding at all angles.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She was taller than the charau-ka, but she had seen the strength and ferocity\
  \ of the foul creatures before and knew better than to be fooled by their size.\
  \ For an endless instant, human and charau-ka locked burning, unblinking eyes. Then\
  \ they were coming at her. Their shrieks grew higher until they were a fire in the\
  \ ears, and they crossed the intervening distance—whether afoot or swinging from\
  \ the heavy branches—with a speed that astonished even the experienced Imjaka huntress.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Astonished—but not dismayed.</p> \n   <p>The huntress let fly, sending\
  \ a mambele whistling through the air as she dove. Leaves and mushrooms crunched,\
  \ the latter emitting a pungent and unhealthy smell as she rolled on one shoulder,\
  \ passing just beneath the reach of the tree-borne charau-ka's bludgeon.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Her second enemy, though still roaring his fury, had jerked to a halt at\
  \ the impact of the many-pointed weapon. It protruded from his chest—not deep enough\
  \ to reach anything vital, but agonizing enough.</p> \n   <p>The forward tumble\
  \ brought her back to her feet—or rather, to her knees, ending in a crouch before\
  \ her diminutive foe. She yanked the mambele from his chest, twisting to widen the\
  \ wound. That second jolt of pain, in turn, bought her enough time to bring her\
  \ arms—and her blades—together across his throat.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ameyanda.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ameyanda_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   <br> \"Ameyanda fears no man or beast, but only a fool ventures into the Sodden\
  \ Lands.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>Both mambeles, one already blooded, the other pristine,\
  \ dug through simian fur and flesh. First a gout of the charau-ka's blood spattered\
  \ across the earth, followed by his weapon—and then the charau-ka itself.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Hanging now by his feet, the surviving simian hurled a pair of stones, produced\
  \ from spirits-knew-where. The huntress knocked the first aside with a desperate\
  \ backhand, iron blade sparking on the jagged rock, but she'd no way to avoid the\
  \ second. All she could do was rise from her crouch so that she took the stone against\
  \ leather-warded chest rather than unprotected head.</p> \n   <p>Dyed the crimson-brown\
  \ of drying blood, the jerkin was boiled and hardened to turn aside spears and arrows,\
  \ yet she felt her flesh bruise, her rib shuddering but thankfully not cracking\
  \ with the impact.</p> \n   <p>She needed to close, fast. Fortunately, the damn\
  \ monkey's acrobatics and elevation didn't give him nearly the advantage he anticipated.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Again the mambele flew, followed swiftly by the second. The charau-ka\
  \ swung aside on one foot, allowing both blades to sink harmlessly into the wood;\
  \ but then, she'd known full well that he would.</p> \n   <p>In the brief seconds\
  \ of his dodge, the huntress broke into a run and leapt. Hands calloused by a life\
  \ in the wilds of the Mwangi Expanse closed around the rough bark. Even as the charau-ka\
  \ spun back her way, she swung forward, wrapping her calves around the creature's\
  \ torso just below his arms. A sharp twist of the waist was enough to shake the\
  \ bough and, more significantly, yank the ape-man from his perch to land headfirst\
  \ on the jungle floor.</p> \n   <p>It wasn't much of a fall, not nearly enough to\
  \ kill. No, it was the woman landing on him even as he bounded upright, both mambeles\
  \ once more in her hands and angled sharply downward, that did the trick.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Silence, then, save for the huntress's sharp breaths. Still alert for the\
  \ missing charau-ka, she carefully cleaned her blades on the creature's hairy hide\
  \ before sheathing them. She then made her way to the spears, jutting from soil\
  \ or flesh, retrieving those that might be reused, salvaging the iron tips from\
  \ those that could not.</p> \n   <p>\"If you seek the human, you will not find him.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>She spun to face the thick screen of foliage from which the voice had\
  \ come. It had an odd sound to it: raspy, slightly mangled, as though spoken by\
  \ someone unaccustomed to the regional dialect.</p> \n   <p>Or, she realized when\
  \ the figure stepped into the open, by a mouth that was never meant to pronounce\
  \ the words.</p> \n   <p>He stood perhaps a head taller than she. Scales the murky\
  \ green of stagnant swamp water faded gradually into a sallow tan across his throat\
  \ and chest. A crest of similarly colored spines ran from atop his head to the base\
  \ of his tail. He wore only an open vest and loincloth of some mammalian hide, but\
  \ his eyes gleamed with cunning and the black talons of one hand were wrapped around\
  \ a feather-and-bone-bedecked spear.</p> \n   <p>It was only as she completed her\
  \ fleeting inspection that she realized she had no way of knowing if \"he\" was\
  \ in fact male. She'd just assumed, perhaps due to the voice.</p> \n   <p>Her own\
  \ hands lingered near the mambeles, but if the newcomer was hostile, he could have\
  \ struck from concealment. Warily, she straightened and ran a hand over the prickly\
  \ stubble that was the only hair atop her scalp. \"What do you mean?\" she asked.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I have watched these charau-ka since before midday. They met earlier\
  \ with one of the great speaking gorillas of Usaro. A wizard, surely, for it disappeared\
  \ soon after, taking two of the charau-ka and a human with it. They may be anywhere\
  \ now, perhaps even Usaro itself. As you clearly track them, I assume it is the\
  \ human you seek?\"</p> \n   <p>She growled something she hoped, afterward, the\
  \ reptile wouldn't be able to translate. \"Yes, damn it. It is.\"</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ lizardman nodded, though whether the gesture meant the same thing coming from\
  \ him as it would from her, she was unsure.</p> \n   <p>\"I am Ameyanda,\" she said,\
  \ remembering at least a sliver of etiquette while the bulk of her attention was\
  \ focused on figuring out what she was supposed to do now. \"Of the Imjaka.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Seyusth, of Haa-Ok. And I know you already, Ameyanda of Imjaka.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Grandmother Sun's blessings on—what? You know me?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I\
  \ know you, yes. I am, in fact, seeking you, not those.\" He gestured with an empty\
  \ hand toward the apish corpses.</p> \n   <p>\"Why?\" Her own hand edged again toward\
  \ her weapons.</p> \n   <p>\"I seek one of my clan, my...\" He paused, blinking\
  \ languidly, perhaps trying to recall the proper word, or to explain a concept that\
  \ didn't translate. \"‘Cousin,' is the nearest term in your language. You will help\
  \ me retrieve him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Is that so? Seyusth, not only have I my own hunt\
  \ to—\"</p> \n   <p>\"You cannot find your missing human any time soon. You have\
  \ no means of tracking him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Not only have I my own hunt,\" she repeated\
  \ through a cage of clenched teeth, \"but why, by all the gods, would I involve\
  \ myself in <i>yours</i>?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Because, Ameyanda of the Imjaka, you owe\
  \ me your life.\"</p> \n   <p>A pause; a blink; a breath.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh. You're\
  \ that lizardman.\"</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ameyanda had no difficulty remembering. She still dreamed about it.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She felt the crunch of twigs and fungi beneath her feet, saw the trees\
  \ and fronds whipping by to either side, heard her own desperate gasps echoed in\
  \ the panting of Mbamsi and Entandwi. She gagged as the ominous musk—not quite reptile\
  \ and not quite avian, but distilled from the worst of both—seeped malevolently\
  \ into those breaths, as if taunting. And she heard the cracking and snapping, hissing\
  \ and spitting, as the pack closed far, far too rapidly from behind. They were smaller\
  \ than most of the predatory thunder-lizards of the Mwangi, those raptors, but they\
  \ were large enough, fierce enough, and horrifyingly cunning enough to take down\
  \ prey far stronger than the three Imjaka youths. They'd already lost Xabadzi to\
  \ the raptors' initial ambush.</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda and her friends would follow\
  \ him soon enough.</p> \n   <p>Or they would have, had the grasses themselves not\
  \ come to the rescue. Wiggling like serpents, they intertwined with the pounding\
  \ talons of the raptors. Yanked to a halt, some so swiftly that they toppled, the\
  \ thunder-lizards began to slash and chew at the suddenly hostile flora.</p> \n\
  \   <p>They might, perhaps, have gnawed themselves free soon enough, but the trio's\
  \ fortune had not yet run out. From a sky largely bereft of clouds, the lightning\
  \ cracked. When the first of the raptors was seared, shrieking in pain, the others\
  \ redoubled their efforts. By the time the third had suffered the same agonizing\
  \ fate, the rest wanted nothing more than to be elsewhere. Finally ripping themselves\
  \ free, the surviving members of pack scattered, their prey forgotten.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>For a moment, as Ameyanda had turned, wide-eyed, toward Mbamsi and Entandwi,\
  \ she caught a glimpse of one of the mysterious lizardfolk, deep in the jungle's\
  \ shadows. Ameyanda knew little about magic, then, but she knew that what she'd\
  \ witnessed had in no way been natural. Tentatively, she raised a hand in greeting.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Her reptilian savior had solemnly returned the gesture before vanishing\
  \ into the trees.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ameyanda dragged her mind across the intervening half-decade and back\
  \ to the figure she'd never thought to see again.</p> \n   <p>\"I owe you,\" she\
  \ admitted, her voice low. \"And the Imjaka repay our debts.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Good,\"\
  \ was all Seyusth offered in reply.</p> \n   <p>Stifling a sigh, the huntress went\
  \ to retrieve the woven satchel of supplies that she'd left in the hollow of a winding\
  \ tree root before engaging the charau-ka. \"You could explain yourself, at least,\"\
  \ she suggested sourly. \"Why come to <i>me</i>? Could the other Haa-Ok not—?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"My people have no desire to assist me. Our journey may take us into\
  \ the territories of the Terwa Lords.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And those are who?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"The...\" Again, Seyusth seemed briefly at a loss. \"What is your term for\
  \ my kind?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your...? Oh. Ah, ‘lizardfolk.'\"</p> \n   <p>His snout\
  \ twitched as though he'd just swallowed something that had decided to bite back.\
  \ \"Yes. The ‘lizardfolk' of the western swamps are not like Haa-Ok, or our neighboring\
  \ tribes. They are fiercer. More bloodthirsty.\"</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda hefted the\
  \ satchel over her shoulder. \"We've had trouble with lizardfolk raids now and then.\
  \ Them?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Most probably. The Terwa Lords—those who rule the swamp\
  \ tribes—seek expansion and conquest. They have attempted, at times, to annex even\
  \ tribes far into the Mwangi, either through promise or threat. The former emptier\
  \ than the latter, I think.\"</p> \n   <p>\"They're your enemies,\" she said. \"\
  And your tribesmen—uh, tribeslizards?—will not risk invading their lands over one\
  \ missing person.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You understand precisely. I attempted to locate\
  \ Issisk—the missing one—myself, but my knowledge of the region proved insufficient.\
  \ It cost me an entire moon of wasted effort.\"</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda was frowning,\
  \ tapping a hand idly against her quiver. \"I'm a skilled warrior,\" she said without\
  \ braggadocio, \"and I've seen your power... shaman?\"</p> \n   <p>\"As accurate\
  \ a term as any.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But I don't believe the two of us can fight an\
  \ entire nation, Seyusth.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You misunderstand. While we may pass through\
  \ their territories, the Terwa do not have Issisk. If he lives, he is in the hands\
  \ of the swamp's savage <i>humans</i>.\"</p> \n   <p>The satchel fell back to the\
  \ soil with a dull thump. \"You mean the scavenger gangs,\" she hissed, a fair imitation\
  \ of a reptile herself. \"When you say ‘the western swamps'... You mean to take\
  \ us into the Sodden Lands.\"</p> \n   <p>\"If that is what you call the storm-drowned\
  \ territories beyond the jungle's edge,\" the lizardman told her, \"then yes.\"\
