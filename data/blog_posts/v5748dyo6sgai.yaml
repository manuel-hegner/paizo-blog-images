  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">We're reaching the two-month mark, and playtest results\
  \ for our <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios/pathfinderPlaytest\"\
  >first three Pathfinder Playtest scenarios</a> are rolling in. By far, we're seeing\
  \ that the largest amount of feedback came in over the first two weeks of the playtest,\
  \ with the two 5th-level scenarios steadily receiving survey results each week.\
  \ This feedback's been really valuable in analyzing what does and doesn't work in\
  \ these adventures, so please do continue to playtest and encourage everyone to\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">let us know what they think</a>. The surveys have\
  \ been averaging about 3-5 minutes for player surveys and about 5-7 minutes for\
  \ GM surveys.</p> \n     <p>We're not just here to talk about surveys, though. I'd\
  \ also like to highlight a few special topics: an updated appendix format in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpzgd7o?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-4-The-Frozen-Oath\"\
  >Pathfinder Playtest #4: The Frozen Oath</a> and our imminent re-release of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak\"\
  >Pathfinder Playtest #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak</a> to test out the updated resonance\
  \ rules.</p> \n     <h2>The Frozen Oath</h2> \n     <p>As a quick reminder, this\
  \ 10th-level scenario is available for download now. However, unlike the other playtest\
  \ scenarios so far, this adventure does not include any pregenerated characters.\
  \ It's important to either schedule time during the event for your players to create\
  \ their own, or have everyone create a character before the game.</p> \n     <p>We'll\
  \ have the player, GM, and open response surveys up on the site shortly.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>A New Appendix</h2> \n     <p>I've been going back and forth on different\
  \ ideas to make the creature appendices more useful. Right now, scenarios print\
  \ and custom creatures directly in the encounter, and any reprinted creatures (such\
  \ as from a hardcover Bestiary) are reprinted in an appendix at the back of the\
  \ adventure. On one hand, that's nice because it should cut down on the number of\
  \ resources a GM needs to have on hand while running the adventure. That said, there's\
  \ room for improvement, especially because this can lead to a fair amount of page\
  \ flipping between the encounter description and the appendix during play.</p> \n\
  \     <p>That means experimenting with new creature stat block organization. Because\
  \ scenarios are digital-only products with somewhat flexible page counts, we have\
  \ a few options.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Include all of the creature stat blocks—\
  custom and reprinted—directly into the encounter description.</li> \n      <li>Include\
  \ none of the creature stat blocks in the encounter description. Instead place everything\
  \ into the appendices.</li> \n      <li>Include the custom stat blocks in the encounter\
  \ description, and expand the appendices to include all of the stat blocks that\
  \ are necessary to run the adventure.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>The first option\
  \ is certainly tempting because it places all of the information where a GM needs\
  \ it, but in some cases that can be numerous pages of stat blocks across several\
  \ subtiers. Based on some past scenarios with 3 subtiers, it's easy to start losing\
  \ track of the adventure amid the many stat blocks—especially once they're interspersed\
  \ with sidebars and creature illustrations. That also complicates one of the strong\
  \ requests I've seen in the GM surveys: a desire to have stat blocks start and end\
  \ on one page. The more those stat blocks are competing with other material, the\
  \ harder it is to make them fit cleanly.</p> \n     <p>Well, the playtest is a time\
  \ for experimentation! While developing \"The Frozen Oath,\" I tried to fit in as\
  \ much as I could. You'll find that the essential stat blocks for running a 4-player\
  \ table appear directly in the encounters. Given this scenario doesn't have multiple\
  \ subtiers, I could manage that; however, each of these stat block sections would\
  \ be roughly double the length were this to be, say, a Tier 9-12 adventure. In practice,\
  \ that might be too much to jam into a typical scenario's text.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ also changed how the stat block appendix looks. Rather than including all of the\
  \ stat blocks in the same section and alphabetizing them, I broke down the appendix\
  \ by encounter area, starting each one on a different page. Each encounter area's\
  \ appendix now prints all of the stat blocks—both the ones already appearing in\
  \ the adventure as well as every stat block necessary for scaling the encounter\
  \ for larger groups. That way you can find all of the creature statistics all in\
  \ one place, flipping pages less often or just printing off the pages you need.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Take a look, and let us know what you think.</p> \n     <h2>Raiders\
  \ of Resonance Peak</h2> \n     <p>As the design team reviews playtest feedback,\
  \ they've been busily revising systems and exploring new solutions. One of the major\
  \ topics is resonance, which influences how often a PC can attune to and activate\
  \ magic items. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9r?Sending-Your-Heroes-to-the-Mirrored-Moon\"\
  >They've developed a new approach that's launching in the coming weeks</a>, and\
  \ to provide more avenues for playtesting it, the design team has created an updated\
  \ version of \"Pathfinder Playtest #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak\" that includes\
  \ revised rules for all of the treasure you could find. In addition, they're updated\
  \ the 5th-level pregenerated characters to reflect this new resonance approach and\
  \ the recent playtest errata to characters' starting skills (plus some minor corrections\
  \ here and there). Once this new version comes out, you'll still be able to run\
  \ either version for credit, and you'll report them both in the same way. Expect\
  \ to see a special survey for this new version of the adventure.</p> \n     <p>John\
