  \ 2012\n     </div> <span itemprop=\"description\">With Gen Con a few short weeks\
  \ away everyone here at Paizo is ramping up for our yearly exodus to Indiana. Most\
  \ of Paizo will be able to make it to the convention with suitcase full of items\
  \ airport security wouldn't take a second glance at. No armor, no <i>wayfinders</i>,\
  \ no holy symbol to our favorite god that also happens to double as a mug. But for\
  \ some con-goers, these are absolute essentials.<p></p></span> \n     <p>Anyone\
  \ following our Gen Con blogs may recall our previous costume competitions, and\
  \ I am pleased to announce their continuation with our <b>6th Annual Gen Con Costume\
  \ Competition</b>. Cosplaying is one of my favorite parts of every convention, and\
  \ I know I'm not the only one at Paizo who enjoys seeing the worlds of fiction and\
  \ fact brought to life in this manner. If you're planning on cosplaying anything\
  \ from Pathfinder, make sure to swing by our booth and say hello. Chances are you've\
  \ spent a lot of time on your costume learning a new medium or technique, or figuring\
  \ out how to best apply makeup to look like a half-orc, and we'd like to show everyone\
  \ your hard work!</p> \n     <p><b>Here's the deal</b>: At some point during Gen\
  \ Con stop by the Paizo booth while you're in your costume. Show off your handiwork\
  \ to one of the Paizo staff members and make sure one of us is able to get a picture\
  \ of your costume! Once Gen Con is over, we'll post the pictures to the Paizo website\
  \ so you can vote for which cosplay is your favorite. <b>The winner will receive\
  \ $50.00 in Paizo store credit</b> as well as the knowledge that he or she has won\
  \ the admiration of the Paizo staff and fan base, although I suspect everyone who\
  \ enters will receive the latter.</p> \n     <p>Please note that in order to be\
  \ eligible for the contest your costume must be identifiably from Golarion or the\
  \ Pathfinder setting. If you're looking for inspiration, we have some of the previous\
  \ years contestants <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldug\">here</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcjt\"\
  >here</a>, and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbde\">here</a>.</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ look forward to seeing you at Gen Con!</p> \n     <p>Erik Keith<br> <i>Customer\
  \ Service Representative</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Community,\
