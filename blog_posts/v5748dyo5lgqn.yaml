  description\">Over the past several months, there have been some growing concerns\
  \ with <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>. As\
  \ we would like to take action to correct the concerns instead of let them grow\
  \ and fester, we reached out to all 395 Venture-Officers a month ago to receive\
  \ their feedback on what was wrong with the campaign, what was good about the campaign,\
  \ and what we could do to improve or correct things to make Pathfinder Society even\
  \ more awesome. Even though there were some difficult opinions expressed, most were\
  \ true and it caused us to take a hard look at the organized play program.</p> \n\
  \     <p>After receiving feedback from the Venture-Officers, we formed a team of\
  \ Paizo employees to work on solutions for the concerns that were expressed. This\
  \ team included Lisa Stevens and Erik Mona, Mark Seifter and Mark Moreland, John\
  \ Compton, and me. There were 327 responses from our VOs regarding thoughts and\
  \ feedback on the current state of PFS. I went through each and every post and listed\
  \ every one of the concerns expressed on a large white board in our conference room.\
  \ The meeting took upwards of six hours, and through debate, discussion, and some\
  \ give and take, we came up with some solutions to most of the concerns that were\
  \ expressed.</p> \n     <p>The Venture-Officers are aware of many of the initatives\
  \ we have set forth to accomplish the goals. There are still other topics we are\
  \ continuing to discuss on the Venture-Officer message board to make sure they are\
  \ the best we can make them for the campaign at large. I wanted to write this blog\
  \ to bring the player base up-to-date on some of the initiatives we have set into\
  \ motion with the awesome collaboration that took place between the VOs and the\
  \ Paizo team.</p> \n     <h2>Factions</h2> \n     <p>First, let's talk about factions\
  \ and their roles. After much discussion here at Paizo, specifically on some problems\
  \ that were brought up in the long discussion with all of the Venture-Officers,\
  \ we agree that factions currently don't play as important a role as we would like\
  \ them to. We want factions to have meaning and substance. We think our factions\
  \ help to set PFS apart from other organized play campaigns. We have strategized\
  \ a four-pronged plan of attack which we think will help return factions to a more\
  \ important role in the campaign.</p> \n     <div class=\"product\"> \n      <ul>\n\
  \       <li>The five new factions are receiving a professional makeover for their\
  \ faction symbols. Grand Lodge and Silver Crusade faction symbols will remain unchanged.\
  \ If you have suggestions on what they should look like, please start a different\
  \ thread. The target goal for this to be implemented is by the end of 2014.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>There will be revised and improved write-ups of each faction for\
  \ both the PFS landing page at paizo.com and the Guide to Organized Play. We plan\
  \ to implement these write-ups by the end of 2014.</li> \n       <li>We will be\
  \ adding \"The Story So Far\" type of pages to the PFS landing page at paizo.com.\
  \ John is assembling a team of writers to help him accomplish this goal for all\
  \ past seasons. These will be spoiler-lite and help to sum up each season for new\
  \ and old players alike. The target goal for this is end of February 2015.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>We will be producing Faction Journal cards, similar to the PAXPort\
  \ or the quests cards we provide at Gen Con. There will be one Faction Journal card\
  \ for each of the seven factions.</li> \n       <li style=\"list-style: none;\"\
  > \n        <ul>\n         <li>The front of the card will list a series of goals\
  \ (likely 10) to complete for the current season. These goals will be generic enough\
  \ that they can be accomplished from playing not just the current season, but past\
  \ season scenarios as well. For example, the Dark Archive Faction Journal may have\
  \ one of their 10 goals be to find and recover five named manuals to bring back\
  \ to the archives in Absalom. These could include the <i>Inward-Facing Circle</i>\
  \ book from <a href=\"/products/btpy84k0\"><em>Silent Tide</em></a>, the dozen black\
  \ vellum scrolls in <a href=\"/products/btpy8arc\"><em>Voice in the Void</em></a>,\
  \ and any other documents or manuals that are found in sanctioned adventures. Each\
  \ time you accomplish a goal, the GM will check off or initial a box on that particular\
  \ goal.</li> \n         <li>The back of the card will include three award thresholds\
  \ for accomplishing a set number of these goals. For example, if a PC completes\
  \ three of the 10 goals, they will receive a small favor from their faction or a\
  \ unique, faction-specific item. If they complete six of the ten goals, they could\
  \ possibly receive a unique title that provides certain benefits or a better unique\
  \ faction item. If they complete all 10 of the faction goals, their clout with their\
  \ faction is sufficent to extend benefits to other PCs at tables where the character\
  \ is present, while making their presence (and that of their faction) important\
  \ to every character at the table. As a working example, a Silver Crusade PC who\
  \ has completed all 10 of her faction's goals on her card might be able to use the\
  \ her renown to call in a favor and reduce the prestige point cost of <i>any</i>\
  \ PC's <i>raise dead</i> by 4 so long as she's there to flex her faction's muscles.\
  \ Although this might not be the reward that appears on the Silver Crusade faction\
  \ card when we finish this project, it gives a good example of the type of reward\
  \ we're aiming for.</li> \n         <li>To reward GMs, we are considering adding\
  \ an 11th optional goal that would be applied to the three different thresholds\
  \ of rewards. For example, we may list 10 check boxes and for each scenario GMed\
  \ in the current season, one check box could be completed. Once all ten are filled,\
  \ one goal toward the a reward threshold would be met, leaving only two more to\
  \ complete through playing the character.</li> \n         <li>The back of the card\
  \ will also feature a form of the revised write-up of the faction described in bullet\
  \ number two above, as well as a summation of season-long goals in descriptive text.\
  \ This descriptive text will explain why the PC is trying to achieve the 10 goals\
  \ for the faction and how it will aid the faction in the future—likely in the form\
  \ of the faction head letters.</li> \n         <li>We realize that we are introducing\
  \ this half way through the current season so everyone may not be able to complete\
  \ the card for this season. On day one of Gen Con 2015, no more faction goals may\
  \ be checked off from the Season 6 card. On the same day, a new Season 7 card will\
  \ become available that may include a bonus reward depending on if the character\
  \ completed five or more goals from the previous season. We hope this fresh approach\
  \ will help to build the excitement in factions for future seasons as we plan to\
  \ introduce updated faction goal cards every season at Gen Con.</li> \n        \
  \ <li>These Faction Journal Cards will be provided as a free download on paizo.com,\
  \ so anyone can print one off for a new or existing character at any time.</li>\
  \ \n         <li>Every character may have one card assigned to him. If the PC changes\
  \ factions any time in the future, he would lose all benefits from the card.</li>\
  \ \n         <li>The Faction Journal card would not override the primary and secondary\
  \ success conditions set forth in the scenario. Those are still in place to continue\
  \ enforcing the importance of being a Pathfinder. The Faction Journal card will\
  \ allow for more depth by adding greater meaning to the factions.</li> \n      \
  \   <li>Use of the Faction Journal card is optional. A PC never has to take one,\
  \ use one, or try to complete one.</li> \n         <li>The Faction Journal cards\
  \ should be available by the end of January.</li>\n        </ul> </li>\n      </ul>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <h2>Scenario Length</h2> \n     <p>Over time, scenarios have\
  \ become longer, both in terms of word count dedicated to the adventure (rather\
  \ than to faction missions, for example) and in terms of run-time. To an extent,\
  \ it's also tied to the increased number of lengthy role-playing scenes and tougher\
  \ combats intended to match the six-player assumption (i.e. more PCs means more\
  \ enemies means more time spent in combat). In most circumstances, the longer scenarios\
  \ are, the harder they are to schedule and run.</p> \n     <p>We are taking the\
  \ following steps to address this issue and bring the expected run time (time from\
  \ mission briefing to the resolution of the final encounter, not including set-up\
  \ and paperwork) to four hours:</p> \n     <div class=\"product\"> \n      <ul>\n\
  \       <li>Cut one encounter from Tier 5-9 and Tier 7-11 scenarios. These higher-level\
  \ scenarios run over most often, and it's mostly a matter of high-level combat taking\
  \ longer.</li> \n       <li>Revise encounter expectations for Tier 3-7 to minimize\
  \ long, drawn-out encounters resulting from especially high challenge ratings. If\
  \ necessary, we will cut an encounter from Tier 3-7 scenarios, but preferably these\
  \ can still work under approximately the same model.</li> \n       <li>There are\
  \ no changes expected on this front for Tier 1-5 scenarios, which generally fit\
  \ the four-hour model without much trouble.</li> \n       <li>You should start seeing\
  \ these changes implemented in scenarios in December 2014 or January 2015.</li>\n\
  \      </ul> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Scenario Difficulty</h2> \n     <p>We have\
  \ heard your feedback that scenarios have become harder to just pick up and run.\
  \ In part this is due to a large number of scenario-specific subsystems that require\
  \ the GM—and sometimes the players—to learn a new set of rules during the scenario.\
  \ In part, it's also a result of the reliance on the <a href=\"/prd\">Pathfinder\
  \ Reference Document</a> when providing only short stat blocks for encounters. There's\
  \ also the matter of the increasingly involved stories that scenarios are telling.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We are taking the following steps to mitigate these issues:</p> \n \
  \    <div class=\"product\"> \n      <ul>\n       <li>Provide an appendix that includes\
  \ the full <em>Bestiary</em> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>\
  \ pages referenced in the adventure as well as an un-tagged copy of any custom maps\
  \ that appear in the scenario.</li> \n       <li>Cap the number of required GM resources\
  \ at four books per scenario (including the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em></a>). This should be relatively easy if the Bestiary pages are already\
  \ included in the back of the adventure, as in most cases approximately half of\
  \ the books referenced are <em>Bestiaries</em>.</li> \n       <li>Include full stat\
  \ blocks for creatures modified by the advanced, giant, or young simple templates.\
  \ The exception to this would be modifications that appear in the \"Scaling Encounter\
  \ XYZ\" sidebars. For example, if the adventure says that there should be an advanced\
  \ otyugh, the full stats for an advanced otyugh will be there and ready to go. If\
  \ the scaling notes say that a four-person group should instead face a young otyugh,\
  \ those stats would not appear. This should at least cover the essential modifications\
  \ and reduce the amount of on-the-fly adjustment that a GM needs to do.</li> \n\
  \       <li>Limit the number of rules subsystems in scenarios. Subsystems aren't\
  \ going away entirely, but we need to avoid relying on subsystems and simply save\
  \ them for the times that they'll have the greatest impact. Should an especially\
  \ large subsystem such as mass combat appear in a scenario again for whatever reason,\
  \ it would be advertised on the product page. Simple point-tracking mechanics that\
  \ only the GM sees (for example, keeping track of how many clues the PCs uncover)\
  \ are likely to show up a little less often but are still a useful tool.</li> \n\
  \       <li>You should start seeing these changes implemented in scenarios in December\
  \ 2014 or January 2015.</li>\n      </ul> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Season Plotline</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Over the past four seasons, the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign\
  \ has based its season-long plotline on the most recent <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\"\
  >Adventure Path</a> products. In some ways this has worked well due to the new campaign\
  \ setting content available to players, GMs, and authors, but nearly as often, this\
  \ decision has caused problems—either by binding the story of the campaign to that\
  \ of a different product (and the continuity difficulties that can arise), driving\
  \ the Society to do things that don't necessarily fit its mandate, or subjecting\
  \ the community to a long storyline when many participants begin losing interest\
  \ after the first several months. As the list of scenarios grows longer, the list\
  \ of metaplots grows as well, providing a barrier to newer players getting involved.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To combat these trends, we are taking the following steps:</p> \n  \
  \   <div class=\"product\"> \n      <ul>\n       <li>Stop tying the campaign's story\
  \ to those of the Adventure Paths. Player responses suggest that the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy93m0\"><em>Destiny of the Sands</em></a> model of using a current\
  \ Adventure Path as inspiration for a three-part series is about right, and even\
  \ then it's not mandatory that every Adventure Path receives this treatment.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Provide Pathfinder Society its own storyline using its own existing\
  \ plot threads and creating new ones.</li> \n       <li>Expand the number of stand-alone\
  \ scenarios that explore a wide variety of locations rather than get tied down in\
  \ one location with an ongoing story that is tough to follow if one misses a few\
  \ pieces.</li> \n       <li>Provide a \"The Story Thus Far\" handout that provides\
  \ a low-spoiler summary of each season's storyline so that a player can quickly\
  \ catch up on the critical plot concepts when sitting down to an adventure that\
  \ deals with ongoing metaplot elements. The working length for each handout is about\
  \ four paragraphs or 300-400 words. There would be one such document for each season\
  \ and perhaps one for a few of the most complex ongoing metaplots (Grandmaster Torch,\
  \ for example).</li> \n       <li>You should start seeing these changes implemented\
  \ at the beginning of Season 7, though some like \"The Story Thus Far\" handouts\
  \ are likely to appear sooner.</li>\n      </ul> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Quests</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>From our feedback about the success of the <a href=\"/products/btpy98nh\"\
  ><em>Silverhex Chronicles</em></a> quest line, we are aware we need more Quests\
  \ and Quest-like events. Since we already have nine different <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"\
  ><em>Beginner Box</em></a> quests broken up into parts one and two, this was topic\
  \ was a no brainer.</p> \n     <p>We have added two Chronicle sheets to the development\
  \ schedule for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8q4o\"><em>Beginner Box Demos</em></a>.\
  \ One will be for the four demos in part one and the other will be for the five\
  \ demos in part two. These should allow for you to draw more interest from players\
  \ wanting to try the system out, as well as give you another two sets of quest-style\
  \ adventures to run, bringing the immediate total of quests to three sets with the\
  \ inclusion of the <em>Silverhex Chronicles</em> quests. Look for these two Chronicle\
  \ sheets by the end of 2014.</p> \n     <p>We have quite a few more changes and\
  \ additions in the works, and I can't wait to tell you about them. However, some\
  \ are more ideas than polished action plans, so we need a bit more time to make\
  \ sure we get the other exciting changes to PFS in order before we release the rest\
  \ of this information publicly.</p> \n     <p>As always, we look forward to trying\
  \ to create the best Organized Play experience we can for all of you. Please read\
  \ our collected thoughts above and let us know what you think, how we might improve\
  \ upon the ideas, and what we could change to make them better. Thanks again for\
  \ being the best fanbase any game company out there has. Without your input, as\
  \ well as that of the awesome Venture-Officer corp, we certainly could not make\
  \ PFS the best organized play campaign available anywhere in the world.</p> \n \
