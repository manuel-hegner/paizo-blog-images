  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Hi, I'm Joe\
  \ Homes, the newest Paizo editor! I joined the editing crew quietly about 9 months\
  \ ago as a contractor, but I'm really happy to be officially joining the team!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>I graduated in 2010 from Western Washington University with a degree\
  \ in acting and playwriting, and I have been writing, producing, and performing\
  \ in webseries and YouTube shows ever since. My \"let's play\" gaming channel, Team\
  \ Hypercube, just turned 2 years old, and my post-apocalyptic comedy webseries Job\
  \ Hunters has nearly finished releasing its second season. I also have a <a href=\"\
  http://youtube.com/plus2joe\" target=\"_blank\">personal vlog on YouTube</a> and\
  \ you can find me on Twitter as @plus2joe.</p> \n    <p>I'm a lifetime PC, console,\
  \ and board gamer who discovered Pathfinder about 3 years ago. My style as both\
  \ player and GM is pretty casual; my house rules would likely give the design team\
  \ heart attacks. My gaming philosophy is that fun should come first, and if the\
  \ rules get in the way of that, then it's time to bend them. </p> \n    <p>But the\
  \ rules need to work on their own before they can be bent! As a longtime reader\
  \ of the SRD, I know the frustration of encountering contradictory or ambiguous\
  \ language and thinking \"Well, that doesn't make sense.\" My favorite part of this\
  \ job, therefore, has been encountering those issues <i>before</i> they get published,\
  \ then bugging the designers and developers about them directly. Editors are the\
  \ last people to see a product before it heads out to you, so we're the final line\
  \ of defense against mistakes and inconsistencies. </p> \n    <p>I'll be trying\
  \ every day to be on the reader's side, get rid of issues that make you say \"huh?\"\
  , and make the Pathfinder experience as smooth and awesome as possible. If I do\
  \ my job well, you'll never notice!</p> \n    <p>Thanks, everyone! I can't wait\
  \ for you to see the cool stuff we're working on!</p> \n    <p>Joe Homes<br> <i>Editor</i></p>\
