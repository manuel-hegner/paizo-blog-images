  \ Here are a few excerpts:</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <h3>Introduction</h3>\
  \ \n       <p>Founded by a loose fellowship of like-minded adventurers, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society began as a social club for showing off treasures and captivating peers\
  \ with daring tales. The organization’s grown considerably since then, evolving\
  \ into a global operation of explorers, historians, and thrill-seekers that number\
  \ in the thousands, with thousands more support staff in the Society’s employ. In\
  \ the course of more than four centuries, the Society’s power has grown to the point\
  \ that its field agents don’t just preserve the past—in many cases they influence\
  \ the course of history through their deeds and discoveries.</p> \n       <p>Of\
  \ course, any misguided adventurer can ransack a temple and claim they’re an archaeologist.\
  \ But the Pathfinders hold themselves to a much higher standard, ensuring that they\
  \ document their discoveries, hide partially explored sites to discourage looting,\
  \ and extract finds in a way that minimizes both damage to the sites and disrespect\
  \ to the people who lived there. Attaining the skills necessary for this is difficult,\
  \ with most Pathfinders undergoing three or more years of training at the Grand\
  \ Lodge, the Society’s headquarters in the metropolis of Absalom. Only after demonstrating\
  \ their mastery do these initiates achieve full field agent status, joining the\
  \ Society’s rank-and-file. Unaffiliated yet accomplished explorers who have already\
  \ surpassed an initiate’s coursework can skip this training, qualifying for membership\
  \ through their past deeds alone and earning a field commission. No matter their\
  \ path, a true Pathfinder carries a <em>wayfinder</em>—a magical compass that acts\
  \ as a badge of office—that guides them to great discoveries.</p> \n       <p>Field\
  \ agents travel far and wide, surveying uncharted regions, cataloging languages,\
  \ recording stories, unraveling eldritch mysteries, discovering points of interest,\
  \ and recovering the treasures and texts that can preserve the past. Between expeditions,\
  \ field agents convene at the Society’s official bases of operation, known as Pathfinder\
  \ lodges. Typically operated by leaders called venture-captains, these lodges provide\
  \ secure lodging, maps, library access, basic supplies, and a meeting place for\
  \ other adventurers seeking assistance with their own projects. Most valuable of\
  \ all, the lodges are invaluable stores of local knowledge, often including detailed\
  \ reports of unexplored sites and unresolved mysteries just waiting for a skilled\
  \ and interested agent to</p> investigate further. \n       <p>Yet this exchange\
  \ goes both ways. For all the support and operational intelligence a field agent\
  \ enjoys, they’re expected to aid the Society in times of need, help nearby lodges\
  \ as necessary, and report back to the Grand Lodge periodically to share their discoveries—\
  both their written reports and their material treasures. In turn, the Grand Lodge\
  \ periodically publishes its agents’ greatest findings in the Pathfinder Chronicles,\
  \ a centuries-old journal of formal travelogues, dashing adventure, and anthropological\
  \ excellence. This is all the motivation that some Pathfinders need, driving them\
  \ to seek out bigger and bolder discoveries in the hope of being featured.</p> \n\
  \       <p>Overseeing the entire Society is the Decemvirate, a body of 10 leaders\
  \ who have maintained anonymity for centuries—at least until recent years, when\
  \ reforms led one to shed her mask to introduce more openness and help restore organizational\
  \ trust in these directors. Known as “The Ten,” these figures rarely intervene in\
  \ the Society’s day-to-day operations, instead serving as judges of errant agents,\
  \ visionaries who guide the Grand Lodge’s overarching goals, and overseers of the\
  \ Society’s health and activities. Given the Decemvirate’s distant leadership style,\
  \ the Pathfinder Society maintains a number of semiofficial factions and fellowships\
  \ within the organization. Each faction represents a particular passion shared by\
  \ many field agents, advocates for specific changes in Society policy, or just provides\
  \ a greater and more intimate sense of community in such a world-spanning operation.</p>\
  \ \n       <br> \n       <h3>Pathfinder Society Organized Play</h3> \n       <p>Just\
  \ as the Pathfinder Society travels all over Golarion, so too can you participate\
  \ in Pathfinder Society adventures anywhere in the world! As part of an organized\
  \ play campaign, you explore a shared campaign setting with tens of thousands of\
  \ others, and your actions contribute to the setting’s ongoing stories and events.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Participate in organized play at home, at game stores, in libraries,\
  \ at conventions, or online. Adventures come in a variety of lengths to accommodate\
  \ different playing environments. Each adventure grants your characters experience\
  \ points, treasure, and more. Take your characters and rewards between games and\
  \ venues freely, continuing the campaign with players from across the world!</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Organized play emphasizes community and flexibility, allowing you\
  \ to meet new friends and play at whatever pace suits you. The format includes a\
  \ few additional rules that help facilitate a shared world and experience, and there\
  \ are hundreds of friendly venture-officers ready to help you find games. Find out\
  \ more at <b>pathfindersociety.club</b>!</p> \n       <br> \n       <h3>Pathfinder\
  \ Society In Golarion</h3> \n       <p>As the Pathfinder Society is one of the largest\
  \ adventuring organizations in the Inner Sea, many player characters either know\
  \ of it or are among its members. For more information on playing a Pathfinder in\
  \ a campaign, see the organization’s full write-up in Lost Omens Character Guide\
  \ 106–115.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>New backgrounds include archaeologist,\
  \ pathfinder recruiter, spell seeker, trailblazer, and translator. You will find\
  \ a wide range of options any adventurer can use, including more gear, feats, spells,\
  \ locations, magic items, and of course NPCs, timelines, lore, and more lore! And\
  \ you will also discover inspiring art on nearly every page.</p> \n      <p>We know\
  \ people play Pathfinder with our published adventures, in Golarian with their own\
  \ adventures, and in worlds of their own creation—and that these groups overlap\
  \ and evolve over time. So this hardcover holds inspiration and crunchy options\
  \ for us all. It is sure to be an evergreen favorite, bringing together both veteran\
  \ and new players in the Society for years to come. And it is a great addition to\
  \ every homebrew player’s collection in creating a richly detailed world-spanning\
  \ organization! </p> \n      <p>Adventures Ahead!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
