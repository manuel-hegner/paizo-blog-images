  \ Attack!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 21, 2012</p> \n    <p>It’\
  s back, and it wants revenge!</p> \n    <p><b>Inappropriately Sized Firearms (<a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>, page 136): Does this allow\
  \ a Medium or smaller creature to use larger firearms of any size?</b></p> \n  \
  \  <p>The text of the rule is, \"<i>The size of a firearm never affects how many\
  \ hands you need to use to shoot it</i>.\" The intent of that rule was to prevent\
  \ a Medium character from using a Small rifle as a one-handed pistol; it wasn’t\
  \ intended to let a Medium character use a Large, Huge, Gargantuan, or Colossal\
  \ two-handed firearm as a two-handed weapon. Just like with non-firearms, a creature\
  \ cannot wield a weapon that’s far too big or small for it. Specifically in the\
  \ case of firearms, a Medium character can’t use a two-handed firearm sized for\
  \ a Large or larger creature, and a Small character can’t use a two-handed firearm\
  \ sized for a Medium or larger creature.</p> \n    <p><b>Pounce (<a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  ><i>Bestiary</i></a>, page 302): If have this ability, can I make iterative attacks\
  \ with weapons as part of my full attack?</b></p> \n    <p>Any attack sequence you\
  \ can perform as a full attack is allowed as part of the charge-pounce-full attack.\
  \ For example, a barbarian with the greater beast totem rage power gains pounce\
  \ universal monster ability and could make iterative attacks with manufactured weapons\
  \ as part of her charge-pounce-full attack.</p> \n    <p><b>Spell Combat (<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>, page 10): Can a magus use this ability\
  \ with cantrips?</b></p> \n    <p>Yes. It is not limited to spells of level 1 or\
  \ higher.</p> \n    <p><b>Rage Mutagen (<i>Ultimate Combat</i>, page 25): Is the\
  \ Strength bonus for this archetype ability in addition to the normal bonus for\
  \ a Strength mutagen?</b></p> \n    <p>No, the +6 replaces the normal +4 Strength\
  \ bonus of the alchemist’s Strength mutagen. This will be clarified in a future\
  \ printing of <i>Ultimate Combat</i>.</p> \n    <p>Page 25—In the Ragechemist archetype,\
  \ in the Rage Mutagen class feature, change the first sentence to read as follows:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote>\n     <p><i>\"At 2nd level, whenever a ragechemist creates\
  \ a mutagen that improves his Strength, that mutagen’s bonus to Strength increases\
  \ by +2 and penalizes the alchemist’s Intelligence score.\"</i></p>\n    </blockquote>\
