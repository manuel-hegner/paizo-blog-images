  \ on a Theme: Volunteerism</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, May 19, 2016</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In my\
  \ position as Organized Play Coordinator, I work with many of Paizo's volunteers.\
  \ A large number of them are in the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>,\
  \ serving as venture officers and event organizers. They spend hours of their free\
  \ time planning games, teaching new players, and finding GMs. Others aren't in Pathfinder\
  \ Society, but help out in other ways—attending shows and demoing Paizo's products\
  \ to business partners and fans alike, spending hours compiling prep tools for games\
  \ and sharing with other GMs, being a beacon of support on our messageboards. All\
  \ of these volunteers strengthen our community, and without them our jobs would\
  \ be much harder.</p> \n     <p>In acknowledgement of volunteer efforts, Paizo developed\
  \ two different methods of recognition. As a thank you for exceptional volunteerism\
  \ within the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>, we previously\
  \ established the Campaign Service Coin. In addition, Paizo takes the opportunity\
  \ at PaizoCon to name one or more people as Volunteers of the Year.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-front.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-front_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-back.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSCSC-back_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Campaign Service Coin</h2> \n     <p>Tradition held\
  \ that a Venture-Officer received a coin near their three-year anniversary, as this\
  \ represented more than 1,000 days of service. A few volunteers that were not Venture-Officers\
  \ earned coins, usually for outstanding service at Gen Con and PaizoCon. Fifty-four\
  \ Pathfinder Society Volunteers have received coins since the program's inception.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One question I've had over the past few months is \"When will I get\
  \ my coin?\" This question led me to examine my interpretation of the Coin's meaning.\
  \ I don't feel it is a check box achievement. It should not be a reward you receive\
  \ automatically when you hit a date. Nor should you not get one because you haven't\
  \ reached the date yet. I think putting a number to the award lessens the impact\
  \ of receiving it. Instead, I see three years as a flag. In most situations, a volunteer\
  \ working three years is well known in their community and anyone asked provides\
  \ me with numerous examples of the volunteers' commitment to the campaign. But some\
  \ of our most deserving volunteers are not members of the Venture-Officer team and\
  \ thus their efforts fall under the radar for recognition.</p> \n     <p>So I turn\
  \ to members of the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a> for help.\
  \ I request that you send me your recipient recommendations for the Campaign Service\
  \ Coin award. Nominate the local GM who is dedicated to the game, running every\
  \ week for years. Tell me about the event organizer that is on site before the room\
  \ opens, leaves after it is closed, and fields issues like a pro. I want to hear\
  \ about the player who constantly takes time to introduce new players to the game.\
  \ These people may be part of the Venture-Officer team, but they may be individuals\
  \ that are helping out just to make our Society better.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  /image/content/Blog/20160519-VotY_500.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Volunteer\
  \ of the Year</h2> \n     <p>While many recipients of the Volunteer of the Year\
  \ award are members of the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ organized play campaign, it is neither a requirement nor an expectation that they\
  \ should be. The largest difference is that the Campaign Service Coin acknowledges\
  \ service to the Society while the Volunteer of the Year looks to the community\
  \ as a whole. Past recipients include:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>2008: Tim Nightengale</li>\
  \ \n      <li>2009: Liz Courts</li> \n      <li>2010: Mark Moreland</li> \n    \
  \  <li>2011: Doug Miles</li> \n      <li>2012: Kyle Elliott</li> \n      <li>2013:\
  \ Dave Harrison &amp; Rob Silk</li> \n      <li>2014: Ryan Costello &amp; Jefferson\
  \ Jay Thacker</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>Names often don't convey the weight of\
  \ the contributions to Paizo as a whole. Tim Nightengale has been a long-time member\
  \ of the community, organizing the first unofficial PaizoCon and continuing to be\
  \ an ambassador to newcomers to the convention. Liz Courts established <a href=\"\
  /companies/paizoFansUnited\"><em>Wayfinder</em></a>, the fan-run Pathfinder fanzine\
  \ that continues publication today under the editorial direction of Tim Nightengale.\
  \ Mark Moreland established <a href=\"http://pathfinderwiki.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >PathfinderWiki</a>, the repository of knowledge for all things Pathfinder. Doug\
  \ Miles is one of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society's</a> super\
  \ GMs, having reported over 500 sessions, and was the first five-star GM. Kyle Elliott\
  \ was a driving force behind <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ and helped out at many conventions. Dave Harrison and Rob Silk established <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a> in England and co-organized\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizocon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">PaizoCon UK</a>, one of two\
  \ Paizo sanctioned conventions outside the US. Ryan Costello and Jefferson Jay Thacker\
  \ operate <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">Know Direction</a>,\
  \ the podcast for all things Pathfinder.</p> \n     <p>Each of these recipients\
  \ has contributed significantly to Paizo's community, spreading the word of Pathfinder\
  \ far and wide and embodying the best that our community has to offer. Without their\
  \ efforts and support, our group would be less rich, less vibrant, less a community.\
  \ To them, I raise a toast and a cheer, for demonstrating what we can do when we\
  \ give of ourselves.</p> \n     <p>In just over a week, we will migrate from the\
  \ Paizo offices and head to the Doubletree for PaizoCon: the perfect venue to meet\
  \ our players and spend time with members of the community. At Saturday's banquet,\
  \ we get the opportunity to announce the newest Volunteer of the Year. I, for one,\
  \ can't wait to see who is added to this distinguished list. If you are unable to\
  \ join us at the banquet, follow our social media on <a href=\"http://facebook.com/paizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/paizo\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Twitter</a> as we bring you highlights from the show!</p> \n     <p>To\
  \ all those members of our community that help out—from carrying things at events\
  \ to maintaining player databases to organizing conventions to teaching new players\
  \ and GMs—thank you. From the bottom of my heart, my teammates and I thank you for\
  \ your hours spent furthering our hobby.</p> \n     <p>See you at PaizoCon!</p>\
