  \ class=\"date\">Monday, February 12, 2018</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're now a full month into our journey through\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"><em>Jungle\
  \ of Despair</em></a>, the next set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures from WizKids,\
  \ and this week I get to show off some of my favorite figures in the set. So without\
  \ further ado, let's begin!</p> \n    <p>As long as humanity has stood on the edge\
  \ of the jungle and peered into the darkness beneath the impenetrable canopy, the\
  \ imagination has created as many phantasmal dangers as actually exist in the unforgiving\
  \ environment. But not all of these dangers are primeval, unthinking beasts that\
  \ see explorers as little more than a potential meal. Many, in nearly every culture\
  \ and mythology, exist to protect the untamed, untainted regions of the world from\
  \ humanity's encroaching influence.</p> \n    <p>The first such creature in <em>Jungle\
  \ of Despair</em> is the couatl, a lawful good staple of fantasy roleplaying games\
  \ that takes its inspiration from the Aztec god, Quetzlcoatl, who is often referred\
  \ to as \"The Plumed Serpent.\" As such, the couatl is a mighty, mystical flying\
  \ serpent with wings the color of a jungle bird's plumage. Couatls make for great\
  \ protectors of jungle ruins or sacred sites for their ability to aid the adventurers,\
  \ but only if the interlopers can convince the winged serpent of their true intentions\
  \ and veneration for the purity of the unaltered wilderness. The couatl is a Large\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Couatl.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Couatl_360.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Similarly, nature spirits from the First World, the capricious\
  \ realm of the fey, often serve as protectors of portions of the Material Plane.\
  \ Comprised in large part of dense undergrowth and ancient trees, jungles make for\
  \ the perfect habitat for dryads, each of whom is linked to a specific tree and\
  \ given dominion over a particular copse or grove. The dryad in <em>Jungle of Despair</em>\
  \ is a re-posed version of the reclining dryad illustration from the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary</em>, and thus can be used in nearly any wooded environment, from\
  \ a palm tree in a desert oasis to a lone evergreen high atop a mountain vista.\
  \ The dryad is a common Medium figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \    <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Dryad.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Dryad_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Often filling a niche similar to that of a dryad but\
  \ found in other environments beyond the woods is the enigmatic nymph, a paragon\
  \ of natural beauty who uses her charms to bend would-be defilers of the wild to\
  \ her will. Also based on the primary creature illustration from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>,\
  \ the nymph has been given some clothes in her miniature iteration, in the form\
  \ of a seaweed skirt. With a pair of starfish stuck to her legs, she makes a great\
  \ protector of seaside grottoes or isolated beaches but can still easily fit in\
  \ anywhere that nature needs a steward. The nymph is a Medium common figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Nymph.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180212-Nymph_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Mortal protectors of the natural world are no less powerful\
  \ and intrinsically tied to the land, as in the case of the elf druid, a Medium\
  \ common figure perfect for either a player character or in a cabal of Green Faith\
  \ worshipers. In fact, the illustration used as reference for this figure was the\
  \ Green Faith druid in <a href=\"/products/btpy8lvb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Faiths-of-Balance\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths of Balance</em></a>; now where could his\
  \ hawk animal companion have gotten off to?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ElfDruid.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ElfDruid_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, we have a guardian not born or spawned by the\
  \ raw power of nature itself, but rather created with arcane magic and set to a\
  \ specific, ceaseless task by its master: the clay golem. As a construct, this Large\
  \ uncommon figure has no natural habitat, and thus can serve campaigns set in ancient\
  \ jungle ruins, high-magic metropolises, and everything in between. While a clay\
  \ golem can take any shape its creator molds it into, the iconic Pathfinder clay\
  \ golem (and thus the miniature) has a hulking humanoid form and the head of a jackal,\
  \ giving it a decidedly Egyptian feel, making it equally appropriate for use in\
  \ the moldering pharaonic tombs of the Osirian desert.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180218-ClayGolem_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's it for this exciting installment of <a href=\"\

  \ Be sure to tune in next week for a look at some of the player character-appropriate\
  \ figures in the set. Until then, roll high, Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
