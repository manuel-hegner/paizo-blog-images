  artist: "bringing more than a thousand pages of adventure to an elegant, satisfying\
    \ close. It's not saccharine—Brackett's too much of a realist for that. As with\
    \ our world, some people win and some people lose, and those results don't always\
    \ line up neatly along the axis of good versus evil. But there can be no question\
    \ that, as you turn that last page, you come away with a new world that is all\
    \ the more real for its grittiness—a living, breathing place. This is the gift\
    \ of Leigh Brackett, and a fitting end to the Eric John Stark books. Enjoy. James\
    \ Sutter Planet Stories Editor"
