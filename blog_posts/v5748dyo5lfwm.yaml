  >Skinwalkers</a>, Wendy N. Wagner returns to chronicle the further adventures of\
  \ Jendara, who was first introduced in the web fiction story \"Mother Bears.\" As\
  \ a young woman, Jendara left the cold northern isles of the Ironbound Archipelago\
  \ for fame and fortune on a pirate ship, only to return home to find her family\
  \ slain by raiders. Now, many years later, she's forsaken her buccaneer ways and\
  \ sails the islands in search of a simpler life, hoping to raise her young son in\
  \ peace. When a strange clan of shapeshifters begins pillaging the islands, however,\
  \ the past comes crashing back, and there's no choice for Jendara but to take up\
  \ her axe and help the islanders defend all that they hold dear...</i></span></p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2 align=\"center\">Chapter Two<br> The Quarry</h2>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"body-drop-cap\">The thwack of wood against wood jolted Jendara\
  \ awake. She squeezed her eyes shut, but the sound reverberated throughout her whole\
  \ head.</p> \n     <p>\"I shouldn't have had so much of that lingonberry wine,\"\
  \ she grumbled.</p> \n     <p>Wood cracked outside again. Jendara pushed back the\
  \ furs and swung her feet over the side of her bed. She padded out into the hallway.\
  \ Kran's door was open and his bed stood empty, his clothes missing from their hooks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She sighed. He'd avoided her all day yesterday, and skipped the going-away\
  \ feast. She shrugged on her sheepskin coat and trudged into the main room of the\
  \ cottage.</p> \n     <p>\"Kran?\"</p> \n     <p>But he wasn't to be seen. His latest\
  \ woodworking project sat on the plank table, the tools neatly in their case. A\
  \ half-eaten slice of bread sat beside it. Jendara reached for her sword belt, hanging\
  \ by the door, and buckled it on.</p> \n     <p>\"Kran?\" She opened the door. A\
  \ swath of mist swallowed up the rest of the village. It cast a wintry pall over\
  \ the summer morning, and Morul's house, just a few hundred feet away, was so shrouded\
  \ in fog that it may well have been on the other side of the world. Fog was common\
  \ here in the islands, but she never enjoyed the otherworldly cast it spread across\
  \ the landscape, or the clamminess it left on everything.</p> \n     <p>With a sigh,\
  \ she stepped out into the damp morning. Her toe squished on something wet and ropy\
  \ on the doorstep, and she whipped her bare foot back.</p> \n     <p>It was the\
  \ neck cord for Kran's slate. If the boy had taken it off, it was a sure sign he\
  \ didn't want to talk.</p> \n     <p>Jendara's lips compressed. She didn't have\
  \ the luxury of waiting around to settle this. In a few hours, the tide would change\
  \ and she and the crew of the <i>Milady</i> would take their last trip to the mainland\
  \ before winter's snow and ice hit. The thud resounded again, and she followed the\
  \ sound to the back of the house.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  0\"></a>\n      <br>No one messes with Jendara's islands.\n     </div> \n     <p>She\
  \ rounded the corner of the little cottage and saw Kran's shape, the woad-blue sweater\
  \ and shaggy black hair. He stood just past the wood-chopping block, his attention\
  \ on a stick of firewood balanced on top of a fence post. His pants, she realized,\
  \ cleared the top of his boots by a good half an inch. He was going to be tall,\
  \ like his father. Like her father. The boy was made up of the best of both sides\
  \ of his family.</p> \n     <p>She didn't know where the muteness came from. When\
  \ he'd been littler, she thought it was something she'd done wrong before he'd been\
  \ born. Maybe she should have made offerings to other gods beside Besmara, dark\
  \ l0ady of pirates. Maybe she should have stayed on land instead of climbing so\
  \ much rigging. But she'd never found a real reason for Kran's inability to speak,\
  \ and she had to admit that as he'd gotten older, it didn't seem to matter much\
  \ to the boy.</p> \n     <p>Kran wound up his sling and lobbed a shot at the firewood.\
  \ It hit dead center and launched the wood far out into the mist.</p> \n     <p>Jendara\
  \ clapped.</p> \n     <p>Kran spun around. His face, for one instant bright with\
  \ his own success, went dark. He spiked two fingers toward his eyes, then pointed\
  \ out over the fence line. The gesture spoke for itself: <i>See?</i></p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"I saw. You've got a nice release.\" She held out her hand. \"Can I take a\
  \ look at your shot?\"</p> \n     <p>He reached in his coat pocket and held out\
  \ a handful of wooden marbles. She rolled one between her fingers. It was smooth\
  \ and heavier than it looked.</p> \n     <p>\"You carved these?\"</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ nodded.</p> \n     <p>\"Makes a world of difference, using shot that all weighs\
  \ the same. Can really improve your aim.\" She tossed the marble in the air. \"\
  May I keep this? I need a good shooter if we play marbles on the ship.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>He tapped his full belt pouch, suggesting he had plenty more.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"You still practice with rocks at all?\"</p> \n     <p>He shrugged a shoulder.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You should. What if you run out of shot while you're out hunting?\
  \ Be sad to miss out on a really good snowshoe hare just because you forgot how\
  \ to adjust for the weight of an off-balance stone.\"</p> \n     <p>At the word\
  \ \"hunting,\" his face crunched into a scowl. He reached for his chalk and board\
  \ and made an exasperated sound when he realized he'd left it behind.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Jendara took a seat on an old driftwood log and patted the spot beside her.\
  \ Kran didn't sit. \"Look, I'm sorry I didn't take you hunting yesterday. I was\
  \ afraid. Boars are trouble. I've heard of too many things going wrong on a boar\
  \ hunt.\"</p> \n     <p>Kran was quick to tap his ear, then raise his eyebrow and\
  \ point at his eye. He didn't know much of the sign language other mutes used, but\
  \ he was good at finding his own ways to communicate.</p> \n     <p>\"That's true:\
  \ I've only ever heard stories, I haven't seen anything. But I know a man whose\
  \ uncle—\" She broke off, suddenly reminded of Yul's ridiculous story about the\
  \ skinwalker. \"Look, Morul's dog was almost killed yesterday. Hunting is dangerous.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Kran shook his pointer finger at her and then crossed his arms. He\
  \ must have picked the gesture up from Yul over the last few summers spent ashore.\
  \ She wondered, not for the first time, if perhaps she should have insisted the\
  \ boy accompany her on trading journeys. He was the son of two sailors. He should\
  \ practice his seamanship.</p> \n     <p>She reminded herself to focus on the problem\
  \ at hand. Her son was angry. She had only a few hours before the tide turned and\
  \ she set out on a two-month-long journey. She rubbed her head and wished it would\
  \ stop aching.</p> \n     <p>She switched tactics. \"You're going to be eleven in\
  \ spring. That's pretty grown up.\" Really grown up. At age eleven, she'd gone with\
  \ her father on her first raid, sailing to the mainland and stealing five sheep\
  \ and a gallon of Chelish brandy. He'd let her drink it, too.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ boy kept his eyes on her face, his own expression guardedly neutral.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"If you can show me that you're ready for hunting big game, then I'll take\
  \ you hunting with me. Maybe moose, down on Flintyreach. They're dangerous, but\
  \ you haven't lived until you've made your own moose jerky.\"</p> \n     <p>He tapped\
  \ his belt, beside his belt knife. She knew just what he meant.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Yes, you'll get to take your own weapons. I'll even make you your own hunting spear.\
  \ A good ash one, like my father made me.\"</p> \n     <p>Kran frowned and made\
  \ a gesture with his hand like a half-closed fist, the thumb lifted. Jendara cocked\
  \ her head, mimicking him. He repeated the gesture, raising the fist to eye level\
  \ and giving it a little snap. She stopped in the middle of raising her own.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"No.\" She shook her head, even though it hurt. \"My father didn't\
  \ give me my belt axe. I took his when he died. To remember him.\"</p> \n     <p>Kran\
  \ stepped over the scraps of wood and put his arms around her. She leaned her head\
  \ against his. He normally considered himself too mature for babyish hugging.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He released her and beckoned toward the house. She got up off the log\
  \ and paused a moment to brush wood chips off herself. Beyond her own small garden\
  \ space, kept tended by Kran and Leyla, the fog was lifting. She could see all the\
  \ way out to the harbor now, although the view was hazy. The <i>Milady</i>'s yellow-and-blue\
  \ pennant already waved. She smiled a little. She'd bet a gold coin Glayn had raised\
  \ it before the sun had even reached the horizon. The oldest member of the crew,\
  \ the gnome loved the <i>Milady</i> as much as she did.</p> \n     <p>She scanned\
  \ the path leading up to the village. A familiar figure was approaching, the ridiculous\
  \ peacock feather in his felt cap bobbing along. Vorrin, of course. That must mean\
  \ the <i>Milady</i> was ready to set sail.</p> \n     <p>Jendara waved at Vorrin.\
  \ She was happy to see him, even if she wasn't ready to leave Kran just yet. But\
  \ she knew a good way to buy a few more minutes with her boy. \"Kran!\" she called.\
  \ \"How would you like pancakes for breakfast?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Pancakes?\" Vorrin\
  \ asked. \"You know I can't resist pancakes.\" He gave Kran a friendly punch in\
  \ the shoulder.</p> \n     <p>The boy punched him back with a grin. Vorrin slung\
  \ his arm around Kran's shoulder. \"You sure you don't want to go with us? We're\
  \ going to swing south a bit to meet Boruc—he's Morul and Yul's brother, and some\
  \ kind of hermit-artist-genius. He lives in a mine.\"</p> \n     <p>\"A quarry,\"\
  \ Jendara corrected. She stooped to gather up Kran's slate and pass it to him. \"\
  I guess he lives in Averaka most of the year, but in the summer, the quarry reopens\
  \ and he goes out to get first dibs on the best stone. Yul says all Boruc does is\
  \ carve rock, drink mead, and chase wo—\" She eyed her son. \"Chase parties,\" she\
  \ corrected herself. \"He likes to have a lot of fun.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe we're\
  \ glad you're not going,\" Vorrin said. \"Boruc doesn't sound like a very good influence.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Kran rolled his eyes. <i>Boats are boring, and so are statues</i>,\
  \ he wrote.</p> \n     <p>Jendara ruffled his hair. \"I love you, Kran.\"<i></i></p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>You, too,</i> he wrote. <i>Pancakes???</i></p> \n     <p>Vorrin laughed.\
  \ \"It's good to know the lad's mind is in the right place.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"\
  Center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Flintyreach, one of the largest islands in the Ironbound\
  \ Archipelago, lived up to its name. Off the <i>Milady</i>'s bow, the gray rock\
  \ of the island's bones stretched down to the water, no softness of soil or grass\
  \ to invite a sailor off her boat. A few stunted shrubs sprang up out of the cracks\
  \ in the rock. But although these plants were small, Jendara felt certain she'd\
  \ never seen any such a happy green. The people of the islands were like that: a\
  \ hardscrabble lot, quick to fight, but quicker to reach for the mead. Every day\
  \ was a celebration when you worked so hard to survive.</p> \n     <p>\"I can't\
  \ see why Yul's brother wants to live in a place like this,\" Vorrin said, leaning\
  \ his elbows on the deck railing beside her.</p> \n     <p>She reached into her\
  \ pouch for a bundle of leftover pancakes and passed him one. \"Boruc's a stoneworker.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"He could go anywhere to find stone.\" Vorrin waved at the gray\
  \ expanse. \"There aren't even trees here.\"</p> \n     <p>Jendara pointed to the\
  \ south, where greenery climbed up the steep flanks of Flintyreach's inner hills.\
  \ \"The beaches look harsh, but most of Flintyreach is forested. Unfortunately,\
  \ the interior is also infested with trolls, giants, and ettins. The folk down in\
  \ the villages organize hunting parties, but it's still dangerous. People stay close\
  \ to the sea here. It's safer.\"</p> \n     <p>The<i> Milady</i> began to swing\
  \ around, preparing for its approach to the docks. In a few minutes, the ship was\
  \ tied up and the twelve-man crew ready to explore the little fishing village of\
  \ Alstone—or at least, its tavern. Vorrin consulted with Tam, the big blond first\
  \ mate who'd grown up on Flintyreach, and then met Jendara at the edge of town,\
  \ where a little cart road ran off toward Alstone Quarry.</p> \n     <p>\"Tam says\
  \ he and the crew will pick up our other trade goods, so there's no rush to get\
  \ back to town.\" He eyed the sun, about three fingers above the horizon. \"But\
  \ let's try to be back by nightfall.\"</p> \n     <p>Jendara nodded. Morul claimed\
  \ there hadn't been any major problems with giants or trolls in this part of Flintyreach\
  \ lately, but she didn't want to risk a run-in. Wild animals were bad enough, but\
  \ giants...Jendara could definitely live without running into any of them.</p> \n\
  \     <p>As the cart road snaked away from the shoreline, the scrubby trees grew\
  \ taller and the undergrowth thicker. Still, the place didn't feel anything like\
  \ Sorind, the island she'd just left behind. The trees here had grayer bark and\
  \ twisted limbs. They did little to soften the wind coming off the ocean.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Jendara glanced over at Vorrin. He had gone quiet, his teeth working the\
  \ edge of his mustache like he did when he was worried. She watched him a minute\
  \ longer.</p> \n     <p>\"All right, what's bothering you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing.\
  \ It's just getting awfully late in the season.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It'll be fine,\"\
  \ she said. \"Sure, we've had a busy summer and it's kept us moving more than usual.\
  \ Maybe we're a few weeks behind, but it's no big deal. And you've been wanting\
  \ more variety in our trade goods. Boruc's carvings might be just the moneymaker\
  \ you've been looking for.\"</p> \n     <p>He sighed. \"I understand the logic,\
  \ but that doesn't make me any more comfortable. We playing it close this trip,\
  \ Dara. You and I both know summer fades fast out here.\"</p> \n     <p>She gave\
  \ him a particularly winsome smile, one that rarely failed to soften him. \"This\
  \ is our last stop before we leave for Varisia. We'll be fine.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  It's going to make for a hard trip back to Sorind, and you know it. That's why you've\
  \ been so awkward with Kran. Because you're worried.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm not worried,\
  \ and I haven't been awkward.\" She paused, her eyes scanning the brush. \"Did you\
  \ hear something?\"</p> \n     <p>Vorrin shook his head. \"No. It's perfectly quiet.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Now it is. But just now, I thought...\" Jendara trailed off. She\
  \ sniffed at the air, but smelled only smoke and the faint scent of roasted meat.\
  \ \"We must be getting close to the quarry.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I hope Boruc's work\
  \ is as good as Yul claims it is. Our shipment this fall is too ordinary. Too many\
  \ furs and wines, not enough ivory. If we could get some walrus—\"</p> \n     <p>Jendara\
  \ cut him off with a wave of her hand. \"Hush.\" She listened for a long moment,\
  \ head cocked. \"Don't you think it's too quiet?\"</p> \n     <p>He didn't answer.\
  \ There were no birds calling, no squirrels rustling the branches. Jendara broke\
  \ into a run. Vorrin hurried after her.</p> \n     <p>The road tilted downhill.\
  \ A few ruts showed where carts loaded with rock must have dug into the surface,\
  \ and Jendara avoided them, glad it hadn't rained lately. The smell of smoke intensified,\
  \ as did the heavy smell of roasted meat.</p> \n     <p>Vorrin grabbed her shoulder.\
  \ \"Wait.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's a long time till dinner.\
  \ Why would anyone be cooking right now?\" He shook his head. \"Something feels\
  \ wrong.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We should be careful.\" Jendara moved closer to the edge\
  \ of the road, ready to dive into cover at any moment. She crept forward.</p> \n\
  \     <p>A crow exploded from the bush in front of her, its scream launching her\
  \ backward. She fell onto her backside and pushed herself away. The crow rose up,\
  \ cawing once, twice as it cleared the treetops.</p> \n     <p>Vorrin helped her\
  \ to her feet. \"You okay?\"</p> \n     <p>She nodded.</p> \n     <p>They moved\
  \ forward again. The cart road turned a sharp corner. Jendara and Vorrin stopped,\
  \ staring down at the encampment at the edge of the quarry. Nothing moved.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"It's too quiet,\" Jendara murmured.</p> \n     <p>\"Jendara,\" Vorrin\
  \ whispered. He pointed.</p> \n     <p>Beside a cart, a man stood awkwardly, head\
  \ hung low, arms behind him, legs too straight. It took her a minute to make sense\
  \ of the strangeness of his pose, to see the stake running through him, lifting\
  \ his feet inches off the ground. To see the black puddle beneath, clotted with\
  \ flies.</p> \n     <p>A crow settled on his shoulder and nipped at his cheek.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"No!\"</p> \n     <p>Even as she ran, she knew it was stupid, knew\
  \ it couldn't change anything. But she couldn't just watch the bird eat his face.\
  \ Her sword jumped into her hand.</p> \n     <p>\"Jendara!\"</p> \n     <p>The bird\
  \ fluttered aloft, but the sword was already swinging, already biting into its neck.\
  \ For a second, the crow hung in the air, eyes fixed on her face. Then its head\
  \ soared out over the brink of the quarry. Its body fell to her feet.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Damn it, Jenny!\" Vorrin spun her around by the elbow.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Don't call me <i>Jenny</i>.\" She shook him off and began pacing, too upset to hold\
  \ still. \"I've seen this before.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We need to scout out the camp,\"\
  \ Vorrin said, keeping his voice low. \"We need to know if there are any survivors.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Or worse, any attackers.\" She took a deep breath, regaining a\
  \ little control. \"You're right, we need to go through the whole place.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Do a quick perimeter check. I'll head west, you go east. And don't take\
  \ any chances.\" He reached out for her, brushed his fingers against her cheek.\
  \ \"I don't like this.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Me neither,\" she whispered, but she was\
  \ already turning away from him. She still couldn't hear any sounds save for her\
  \ own footsteps crunching the gravel underfoot. That was bad.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ sank into her hunter's crouch and approached the nearest building, the largest\
  \ around. The presence of a tin stovepipe suggested it might be the kitchen and\
  \ mess hall for the quarry workers. Jendara pressed her ear to the wall and listened\
  \ hard. Still quiet, save for a faint drip-drip-dripping. She wished she could look\
  \ through the window, but the shutters were closed.</p> \n     <p>Jendara's fingers\
  \ trembled as she reached for the doorknob.</p> \n     <p>She snapped open the door\
  \ and almost staggered backward at the overpowering stench of blood and offal. The\
  \ kitchen looked like a scene from a nightmare. Bloody handprints covered the counters.\
  \ Flies buzzed over raw-looking heaps that she didn't want to name, and blood slicked\
  \ the floor. Jendara swallowed hard and took a step inside.</p> \n     <p>\"Is there\
  \ anyone here?\"</p> \n     <p>She didn't know why she called out, except in the\
  \ faint hope that someone hiding might hear her and come out to explain that this\
  \ was all a joke, this was all animal blood, those weren't human intestines curled\
  \ around that sack of onions, there was nothing horrible in the big pot sitting\
  \ on the stove. She kept her grip on her sword, but her knees wobbled a little as\
  \ she picked her way across the room. She had to look. Had to know. She peered over\
  \ the lip of the pot.</p> \n     <p>It was empty.</p> \n     <p>Jendara sagged.\
  \ She had expected...she shook her head. Silly perhaps. Whatever happened here,\
  \ it must have happened fast, and whoever did it hadn't stopped to cook. They weren't\
  \ that civilized. She knew they weren't that civilized.</p> \n     <p>After all,\
  \ she'd seen this before.</p> \n     <p>She shook her head and pushed forward.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A door opened up into the dining hall, and she stepped out into the\
  \ space. The dripping was louder here. With only a few windows, the big room was\
  \ almost too dark to see into, but she saw enough. Something squelched under her\
  \ boot as she crossed to the nearest table and righted a bottle of milk. The puddle\
  \ on the table kept dripping, a soft slow pattering onto the tin mug lying on its\
  \ side on the floor.</p> \n     <p>The door burst open. Sunlight poured in, lighting\
  \ up a long sweep of blood leading outside. Vorrin stopped in the doorframe. He\
  \ took in the empty room. \"I see you forgot we were just circling the perimeter.\
  \ Any survivors in here?\"</p> \n     <p>Any survivors. Such a flat way to say the\
  \ worst. She shook her head. \"It's empty. Just blood and parts.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ dripping stopped.</p> \n     <p>\"This must have just happened,\" she realized.\
  \ \"A lot of this blood is still wet. And the milk bottle couldn't have been knocked\
  \ over more than a few minutes ago.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We must have scared someone\
  \ away. A looter, maybe. From what I saw, I think most of this was done longer ago.\
  \ Maybe this morning.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Most of what?\" Her voice sounded faint\
  \ even to her own ears. An attack at dawn. That was what happened on Crow's Nest,\
  \ her father's island. Her sister's island. She thought of the man tied to the stake\
  \ and felt sure it was no coincidence. She stiffened her shoulders. \"Show me.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>They stayed silent as Vorrin led her around the side of the nearest\
  \ building, passing by a clothesline with a few limp garments hanging in the still\
  \ air. An open door showed a basket of dirty shirts and a washtub. Ordinary items\
  \ in an ordinary washhouse.</p> \n     <p>They rounded the corner. A heap of bodies\
  \ lay ahead, a raw mound of broken and bloody dead.</p> \n     <p>\"Gods,\" she\
  \ breathed. \"That has to be eighteen or twenty men.\"</p> \n     <p>Vorrin circled\
  \ around the pile. \"Some of these bodies don't look...whole.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  What?\"</p> \n     <p>He waved her over. Jendara knelt to look at a body on the\
  \ bottom of the stack. She was glad she couldn't see his face; only his feet and\
  \ legs stuck out—or more aptly, his mutilated legs and <i>foot</i>. Jendara's stomach\
  \ twisted. \"Is it just me, or do his legs look like the meat's been cut off in\
  \ strips?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't want to think about it.\" He pointed to the\
  \ remains of a small campfire. \"Someone definitely built a fire here, like they\
  \ stayed a few hours.\"</p> \n     <p>Jendara stooped to hold her hand above the\
  \ ashes. She nudged a flat rock in the center. \"Still warm, and if I had to guess,\
  \ I'd say those were grease stains on this stone.\"</p> \n     <p>Vorrin blanched.\
  \ \"I don't want to think about it,\" he repeated. He pressed his fist to his mouth,\
  \ skin pale.</p> \n     <p>Jendara felt her own gorge rise, but swallowed hard.\
  \ \"We should check out the rest of the camp.\"</p> \n     <p>She moved to the next\
  \ building, a woodshed. Jendara freed her sword to circle it. Behind her, Vorrin\
  \ moved quietly, only the occasional crunch of gravel giving away his movement.\
  \ There was no blood in the woodshed.</p> \n     <p>Jendara steeled herself to walk\
  \ past the mound of dead again, but Vorrin caught her eye. He tapped his ear and\
  \ nodded toward the gaping pit of the quarry.</p> \n     <p>She listened. She heard\
  \ nothing at first, but then caught a small sound: a scrape of leather against stone.\
  \ \"Do you think it's our milk spiller?\" she whispered.</p> \n     <p>He nodded.\
  \ They crept toward the cart road. As they passed behind the washhouse, Jendara\
  \ felt a momentary gratitude that its bulk hid the grisly mound, a feeling which\
  \ passed all too quickly was the tiny sound of a foot crushing gravel caught her\
  \ ear. There really was someone down there. She wondered how deep the quarry went\
  \ and tightened her grip on her sword.</p> \n     <p>The cart road led to the rim\
  \ of the quarry—a deep stony bowl cut out of the hillside. It stretched a good quarter\
  \ of a mile across. Jendara peered over the edge. The narrow track continued down\
  \ into the rocks, following the curve of the walls. For the first hundred yards\
  \ or so, mounds of yellow sandstone lay piled up on the shoulders of the road. Trees\
  \ and brush obscured the turn beyond. Jendara leaned out farther. The bottom of\
  \ the quarry looked empty, the flat expanse of sea-green stone like a placid lake.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jendara turned back to Vorrin. \"Whoever went down there, they haven't\
  \ reached the bottom yet.\"</p> \n     <p>He glanced over the edge. \"I don't like\
  \ that descent. It's too easy to rig an ambush on a road like this.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Jendara laid her hand on his arm. \"<i>If</i> the person we're chasing is\
  \ dangerous. This could be a survivor, scared out of their mind after what they\
  \ saw back there. Or it could be a witness, some woodsman who just walked into a\
  \ nightmare. No matter who they are, I want to talk to them.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Let me go down.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No. I'm a local, they're more likely to trust\
  \ me.\" Jendara pointed to the far side of the quarry. \"I think you'd better follow\
  \ the top of this cliff around to the far side. The ground's rough, but I think\
  \ that looks like a footpath leading out of the quarry, don't you?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Vorrin squinted a moment. \"I see it. Good plan.\" He gave her a sharp look.\
  \ \"You'll be careful, right? You're not running down there with your sword half-out\
  \ just because of what you saw back there?\"</p> \n     <p>Jendara began walking\
  \ down the steep path without sparing him a backward look. \"I know I'm doing, Vorrin.\
  \ Just watch the trail.\"</p> \n     <p>As she went, she studied the path ahead\
  \ for clues. There was no way to make out tracks on gravel this heavily traveled,\
  \ but blood would stand out. No way to kill that many people without getting bloody.\
  \ And it was hard not to leave tiny signs of passage that a good set of eyes might\
  \ pick up: with every step, a person shed spoor like hairs and threads and fragments\
  \ of the foods they ate.</p> \n     <p>She paused to listen for other footsteps.\
  \ The quarry was silent. Jendara took a few steps forward, focusing on the sound\
  \ of the gravel beneath her boots. She knew how to step lightly, but the tiny stones\
  \ made a certain amount of noise no matter what. She paused again. <i>There</i>.\
  \ That might have been the rustle of a foot passing over pea gravel.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>She resisted the urge to run toward the sound. It would be all too easy to\
  \ think of those bodies piled up by the wash house and let hot rage whip her into\
  \ a run, but she pushed the anger aside. If she ran toward a survivor, it would\
  \ only further terrify the poor man or woman. And if it was a killer, well, it would\
  \ still be just as easy to die by falling to the bottom of this pit as it would\
  \ be to get jumped by a slavering cannibal.</p> \n     <p>Cannibalism. Just the\
  \ thought of it sickened her. The only cannibals she'd ever heard of were the Kalvamen,\
  \ those reclusive island dwellers far to the north. Few risked the trip to Kalva\
  \ to see the massive barbarians with their milk-white eyes and sickening eating\
  \ habits, and no Kalvamen had raided the islands in generations. Morul and Yul weren't\
  \ the only ones who thought the Kalvamen were nothing to fear. If asked, most islanders\
  \ would agree that the people of Kalva were too deranged and inbred to manage a\
  \ sea crossing.<i></i></p> \n     <p><i>Maybe they should be more afraid</i>, Jendara\
  \ thought. After she'd returned home that day to find her father dead and her sister\
  \ missing, she had taken to her ship and scouted the island of Kalva from the sea.\
  \ It was true she had seen no sign of ships large enough to travel the ferocious\
  \ seas between Kalva and the Ironbound Archipelago, but it was also true that plenty\
  \ of islanders had sailed remarkable distances in small raiding vessels. She had\
  \ never discounted the Kalvamen just for lack of seafaring ability.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ tripped on a stone jutting out of the worn path, and at the last second caught\
  \ herself on a massive boulder. She clung to it a moment, trying to catch her breath.\
  \ She needed to pay better attention if she didn't want to kill herself.</p> \n\
  \     <p>A few feet beyond her, someone had cleared away the piles of fallen rock\
  \ and brush, and she could clearly see the bottom of the quarry. The current work\
  \ zone stood out from the rest of the rock floor, with racks of gear and tools stacked\
  \ around a square perimeter. Piles of rock sat waiting to be loaded onto carts.\
  \ Jendara knew little about stones or masonry, but thought the green stuff might\
  \ be soapstone. It was always in high demand, being easy to work.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ hairs on the back of her neck prickled. All those piles provided easy cover for\
  \ an ambush.</p> \n     <p>She picked her way forward and kept low to the ground\
  \ as she came out into the flat stone-working area. A massive chunk of green rock\
  \ sat beside the edge of the path. There was no way to see behind it.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Jendara brought out her handaxe. She pressed her back to the stone and reminded\
  \ herself that whoever was down here might not be a white-eyed cannibal killer.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I don't want to hurt you,\" she called out. \"I just want to talk.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>No reply.</p> \n     <p>She threw herself around the side of the\
  \ stone with her axe ready. She saw no one.</p> \n     <p>The jolt of unused adrenaline\
  \ made her legs go to jelly. She ignored it, kept her axe at the ready, and began\
  \ to walk the perimeter of the quarry. She'd expected the worst. It felt strange\
  \ not to face a monster when she was ready for one.</p> \n     <p>She stopped. She'd\
  \ reached the side of the quarry bottom almost directly below its entrance, and\
  \ a dark blot lay on the ground. The crow's head she'd lopped off at the top of\
  \ the quarry. An ant crawled over the still-glossy bead of its yellow eye.</p> \n\
  \     <p>She had to avert her gaze. Beheading the crow had been a bad idea. She'd\
  \ been raised to uphold the old clan traditions, and the crow had been her clan's\
  \ totem. Life at sea had been one way to escape the bird's constant presence on\
  \ dry land—the only time she had to look at them was when the ship docked, or when\
  \ she saw someone wearing one of those crow-shaped traveler's pendants. She tried\
  \ not to look at those necklaces for too long. She'd bought one once for Kalira,\
  \ her sister. The younger girl had adored it.</p> \n     <p>Jendara had circled\
  \ most of the way around now, and still hadn't seen anyone. Where was the person\
  \ who'd gone down into the quarry?</p> \n     <p>Above her, something scraped. Jendara\
  \ looked up and swore. She'd missed the entrance to the little footpath, and now\
  \ her prey was escaping up it.</p> \n     <p>\"Vorrin!\" She had to warn him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But a roar answered her shout: the rumble of something huge rolling\
  \ down the hill. Vorrin might not be in danger, but she was.</p> \n     <p>She somersaulted\
  \ over the soapstone block, pressing her face against its rough surface. Dust filled\
  \ the air. She couldn't see. Or breathe. The soapstone shuddered as something massive\
  \ hit it and stone shards rained down on her. Jendara hissed as one pierced her\
  \ sleeve and drove into her forearm.</p> \n     <p>Coughing, she managed to get\
  \ to her feet. Chunks of rock lay all around the soapstone block. If she hadn't\
  \ moved behind it, she would have been crushed.</p> \n     <p>She scanned the trail\
  \ above. Dust obscured all details. She was going to have to climb it blind.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jamming her axe back into her belt, she scrambled forward. The ground\
  \ was steep, the yellow sandstone of the main cliff walls unstable. She kept sliding\
  \ backward in the stuff. Jendara grabbed for a handhold and dug her fingers into\
  \ a gnarled root. The dust was clearing.</p> \n     <p>Something dark moved up ahead.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jendara reached for the next handhold. Until she got her feet under\
  \ her, she didn't dare try to attack the thing. She had a good arm, but on a nearly\
  \ vertical path, the odds of her hitting him with her handaxe were small. She pulled\
  \ herself up over a knoll of solid stone and caught her breath.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ he was. A man—a tall man in a long, shaggy cloak—hurried up the trail. He pulled\
  \ himself up the steep hillside, snatching at the branches of the overhanging trees\
  \ like rungs on a ladder.</p> \n     <p>\"Hey!\" she shouted, and reached for her\
  \ belt axe. She'd never really believed she was chasing was an innocent bystander,\
  \ but the man's grace and mass made his guilt a near certainty in her mind. No islander\
  \ would have just stood by to watch his friends be ripped apart and eaten, not unless\
  \ he was sick or crippled.</p> \n     <p>He leaped forward and disappeared between\
  \ a pair of bushes. A rock as big as Jendara's head rolled out of the brush, bouncing\
  \ and tumbling straight toward her.</p> \n     <p>\"Damn it!\" She threw herself\
  \ aside and skidded on the path. She caught herself on a tree and raced up the hill.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Up above, Vorrin gave a sudden shout of surprise. Jendara hurried, but\
  \ by the time she reached the top, Vorrin was just picking himself up, pinching\
  \ a bloody nose and swearing.</p> \n     <p>\"It got away,\" he growled. \"I turned\
  \ away for a second—I thought I heard something behind me—and it jumped me. Looked\
  \ like a bear.\"</p> \n     <p>Jendara shook her head. \"A bear? I was following\
  \ a man. A big man, but a man.\"</p> \n     <p>Vorrin shrugged. \"It happened fast,\
  \ and there was a lot of dust in the air. Could have been a man, I guess. But it\
  \ looked furry. And it had claws.\" He held out his hand. A gash ran down the back\
  \ of it.</p> \n     <p>Jendara looked out into the forest. Some kind of trail continued\
  \ into the forest, but here the trees were thick and the bracken dense. If anything\
  \ wanted to disappear out here, it would. And back at Alstone Village, the crew\
  \ of the <i>Milady</i> were waiting.</p> \n     <p>\"Let's get out of here,\" she\
  \ said. \"Someone should know about this.\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><a\
