  \ Fabled Appendix!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 12, 2009</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For my inaugural blog post, I thought I'd try to hark back to some of\
  \ the old-school roots that Paizo has blended together to create the world of Golarion.\
  \ As many members of the Paizo staff have been playing the game since first edition,\
  \ they've made it a design goal to create a setting that is true to the roots of\
  \ the hobby while remaining fresh and exciting. </p> \n    <p>At the time of the\
  \ publication of the first edition <i>Dungeon Masters Guide</i> in 1979, the book's\
  \ Appendix N was fairly revolutionary. This appendix consisted of a list of pulp\
  \ fantasy authors that E. Gary Gygax considered to have had the largest role in\
  \ shaping Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This list included such famous authors as Edgar\
  \ Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, and <a href=\"/search?q=michael+moorcock+kane&amp;what=all\"\
  >Michael Moorcock</a>. What made Appendix N so remarkable was that, at the time,\
  \ most these authors were relatively unknown, with only a handful of older authors\
  \ enjoying a resurgence of popularity thanks to the efforts of contemporary fantasists\
  \ such as L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter. </p> \n    <p>Since the publication\
  \ of that first DMG, Appendix N has played a role in the development of the hobby\
  \ that is hard to overemphasize. The authors and works listed in the appendix influenced\
  \ the earliest editions of the game and continue to steer game designers 30 years\
  \ later. The first two printings of the first edition <i>Deities &amp; Demigods,</i>\
  \ for instance, contained the Melnibon√©an pantheon from Michael Moorcock's Elric\
  \ series, as well as the Great Old Ones of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. And\
  \ today in the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, Edgar Rice Burroughs's tales\
  \ of Mars and Venus have helped to inspire Golarion's own red and green sister planets.\
  \ Indeed, the whole <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a> line was launched\
  \ with the intent of reintroducing pulp fantasy authors to modern gamers. The roots\
  \ of Appendix N are deep and far-reaching indeed.</p> \n    <p>With this in mind,\
  \ I plan to explore which books, movies, comics, and roleplaying products members\
  \ of the Paizo staff have found most influential in both their style of design and\
  \ the development of Golarion. And our first interviewee will be Paizo's own publisher,\
  \ Erik Mona. Look for it next time!</p> \n    <p> David Eitelbach <br> <i>Editorial\
  \ Intern</i></p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Appendix N, interns, interview -->\
