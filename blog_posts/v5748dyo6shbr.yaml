  \ <a href=\"“paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shbe”\">Paizo blog on July 24</a>,\
  \ though they can also be run independently of one another.</p> \n     <h3>ESCAPING\
  \ GRAVITY — CR 7</h3> \n     <p>Singulos is a kasathan solarian dedicated to the\
  \ negative aspects of the Cycle; convinced that black holes and singularities will\
  \ inevitably triumph over the birth of new stars, he has forsaken many solarian\
  \ beliefs and trained a generation of followers. Traditional solarians—covertly\
  \ backed by the Idari—have sought Singulos for years, but it was the Stewards who\
  \ finally caught him hiding on a remote planet in the Vast. Now he’s aboard a Steward\
  \ prison ship called the <em>Harrowstone</em>.</p> \n     <p>But Singulos has many\
  \ followers, and they’re determined to break him free. They’ve attacked the <em>Harrowstone</em>\
  \ and killed most of the crew; the remainder, led by Third Officer <b>Daneel Ris</b>\
  \ (LG female human), are holed up in the passenger section of the ship. </p> \n\
  \     <p><b>A Singular Notion</b>: If you have played through A Singular Notion,\
  \ “Escaping Gravity” follows when solarians from the Aphelion board the <em>Harrowstone’\
  s</em> passenger section. If you have not used that encounter, the player characters\
  \ are the nearest ship when the <em>Harrowstone</em> is attacked. Officer Ris begs\
  \ them for assistance. “We have a very important prisoner on board here, and I think\
  \ these creeps are trying to break him out. There’s only a few of us left... please\
  \ help us!”</p> \n     <p>The player characters arrive through an airlock (area\
  \ <b>A</b>). Singulos is kept prisoner in a large room on the middle of the western\
  \ edge (area <b>B</b>), and his followers arrived through the hole in the ship in\
  \ the southeast and have spread to the southwest. Officer Ris and the remaining\
  \ Stewards are trapped behind a large door (area <b>C</b>), safe but unable to assist\
  \ the PCs. Other rooms in the emergency section—lit by red lights—contain prisoners.\
  \ They are unarmed and not a threat, and largely unfriendly to anyone they meet,\
  \ but one room with 8 prisoners is on fire (area <b>D</b>); see Hazard, below.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Hazard</b>: Fires have broken out throughout this section of the\
  \ ship. Characters entering a square that is on fire take 4d6 fire damage (DC 17\
  \ half) and are at risk of catching fire (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 403). One of the\
  \ rooms containing prisoners is on fire (area <b>D</b>); their pleas for help can\
  \ be heard by anyone in the red-lit areas of the map. There are 8 prisoners in this\
  \ room; if not rescued, 2 of them fall unconscious from smoke and flame every turn.\
  \ Once all of them have gone unconscious in this way, the cries for help cease.\
  \ If they remain trapped within the burning room, two of these prisoners die every\
  \ round.</p> \n     <p><b>Creatures</b>: Four solarians have reached the critical\
  \ section of the <em>Harrowstone</em>. Unlike other solarians, they have forsaken\
  \ photon revelations and cannot supernova. The stat block provided below is for\
  \ human solarians; for enemies of other species, replace their Stealth skill and\
  \ Close Combat feat with new racial abilities.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c3d61873-2720-4350-8a85-491e1306814b/072920_SolarianDarkWeapon.jpg\"\

  \ Singulos’s followers take move actions to use Improved Demoralize before attacking\
  \ with their solar spears; their t-quark crystals give them a bonus +1d3 damage\
  \ twice per day, which they use as quickly as possible. They attempt to use black\
  \ hole and gravity hold to drag enemies into fire, which they are immune to. The\
  \ solarians carry breaching guns to break down doors; they are not proficient with\
  \ these weapons and use them against PCs only as a last resort.<br> <b>Morale</b>\
  \ Isolated from their starship and with no path of retreat, Singulos’s followers\
  \ fight to the death.</p> \n     <p><b>STATISTICS</b><br> <b>Str</b> +2; <b>Dex</b>\

  s followers can sense his presence; they move to the door of his cell and try to\
  \ use their breaching guns to liberate him; a follower of Singulos can take a full\
  \ action to try to break down the door, and has a 50% chance of success on each\
  \ attempt. Only one person can try to break down the door each turn.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>If Singulos’s followers succeed in breaking down his door, he emerges, a kasatha\
  \ dressed in dark blue, purple, and black and surrounded by an aura of crackling\
  \ power. He praises his followers, saying, “Well done, my faithful servants,” before\
  \ abandoning them and flying out the hole in the southeast corner of the map, escaping\
  \ custody.</p> \n     <p><b>XP</b>: If the PCs prevent Singulos’s escape, award\
  \ them 1,600 XP. In addition, for each of the 8 prisoners trapped in the burning\
  \ room the PCs rescue, award them 200 XP. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
