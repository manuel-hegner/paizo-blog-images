<h1>Delve of Doom Results!</h1>
<p class=date>Friday, August 31, 2007</p>
<p>Gen Con was a great show for Paizo, as usual, but this year had a new addition to our booth presence. It all started with a little contest around the office to determine who could design the most deadly dungeon chamber. While this idea was all well and good, we would need some "test" subjects to run through our gauntlet of pain, and thus the idea of running a delve at Gen Con was born.</p>

<p>Using the fabulous Master Maze 3D dungeon terrain pieces produced by Dwarven Forge, along with our <i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7wv9">Critical Hit Deck</a></i>, <i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7uvm">Combat Pad</a></i>, and <a href="/gameMastery/itemPacks">item cards</a>, we set out to murder as many unsuspecting visitors to our corner of the booth, and murder we did. Of course, we also gave out some great prizes to those who managed to succeed, including free production, discounts at the booth, and even some real swords. </p>

<p>Every unfortunate soul who met his end in the depths of Tirana's death trap became a red dot on our oversized delve maps, as a warning to others. Of course, that didn't seem to help much, as by the end of the show there were 255 red dots on the maps. Considering that we ran roughly 1000 players through the delve, a 1-in-4 death rate is pretty respectable (mental note: make next year deadlier). Of course, part of the fun was figuring out whose rooms caused the most deaths. Phil Lacefield's rooms certainly had the most kills as a whole, but no individual room had more kills than Publisher Erik Mona's doom-filled Vrock chamber. Congrats to Erik for having the least compassion toward poor player characters.</p>

<p>If you missed out on the delve, never fear. Many of its chambers were used as inspiration for <i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7zke">GameMastery Module D2: Seven Swords of Sin</a></i>, which should be hitting your store shelves any day now.</p>

  Pathfinder #4 Cover... and Desktop! Thursday, August 30, 2007In the past, each time we've shown off the cover to a new volume of Pathfinder, we've been immediately deluged with requests for it as a downloadable desktop background, which we inevitably put up a few days later.

<h1><i>Pathfinder</i> #4 Cover... and Desktop!</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, August 30, 2007</p>
<p>In the past, each time we've shown off the cover to a new volume of <i>Pathfinder</i>, we've been immediately deluged with requests for it as a downloadable desktop background, which we inevitably put up a few days later. This time we figured: why wait? After all, there's a long weekend coming up, and we wouldn't want your monitor to have to go without new Wayne Reynolds art for all that time. So here it is: the cover to <a href="/store/v5748btpy7xpu"><i>Pathfinder</i> #4</a>, featuring everyone's favorite butt-kicking cleric of Sarenrae, Kyra. Looking at the stone giants Wayne's dreamed up for us, it's kind of amazing the heroes ever win, isn't it?</p>

<p>Click <a href="/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/PathfinderDesktop-4.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> to download the image at desktop size.</p>

<h1>Science in the Dungeon</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, August 28, 2007</p>
<p>If there's anything that the other editors and I butt heads about around here, it's the amount of science that should be present in our fantasy&mdash;or rather, the amount of science fiction. I make no bones about the fact that I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and if given my druthers I'll almost always err on the side of too much rather than too little. Which means that, given the overall traditional RPG fantasy feel of our campaign setting, it usually falls to Jacobs, Wes, or someone similar to rein me back. (For instance, no matter how much I lobbied, neither of them would budge and allow me to put a magical particle accelerator or space elevator in the Varisia backdrop... which is perhaps for the best.) </p>

<p>In <i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7zke">D2: Seven Swords of Sin</a></i>, the setting of a research facility abandoned by the mysterious Council of Truth allowed me ample opportunity to blend fantasy and science to my own peculiar tastes. The generator room (magic-powered and water-cooled!), the recycling unit (where corpses turn into valuable potions!), the incinerator (get rid of those undesirables!), and the turbines that supply the dungeon with air all scratched an itch that rarely gets addressed in a lot of fantasy settings. By far the most sci-fi element, however, was one of the new monsters: nanites (which were promptly renamed the construct swarm by the Powers That Be).</p>

<p>Few current trends in science capture my imagination more than nanotechnology. Just reading about all the advances in medicine and manufacturing that are coming about as we speak due to tiny, autonomous robots makes me giggle and start expounding loudly on how We Live In The Future (which, as Jacobs will tell you, happens on a regular basis). And while writing D2 I got to thinking: most of the reason we've taken so long to get where we are with nanotech is due to manufacturing limitations. But with magic, construct technology is already in place, and size is changeable at a whim. It seemed to me like a natural choice. And if it allowed me to put in a hermetically sealed "clean room" and a man transformed by a horrible, intelligent swarm that prefers to fight its battles in your bloodstream... well, more's the better. So, fully prepared to have to rewrite that room, I threw it in.</p>

<p>And, to my great surprise, it stayed. For that, I give many thanks to the GameMastery team. May they not regret their decision.</p>

<p>Now just wait until we start talking about Golarion's moon.... </p>

<h1>4th Edition</h1>
<p class=date>Friday, August 24, 2007</p>
<p>We're all back from Gen Con, and aside from the launch of <i><a href="/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></i> and our new <a href="/store/fiction/planetStories">Planet Stories</a> novel line, the hot news at the show was the announcement of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, from Wizards of the Coast. Messageboards across the internet, from paizo.com to EN World and Wizards of the Coast's own site, are abuzz with discussion of what was revealed at the show, what changes are in store for our favorite game, and what the future may hold. </p>
<p>Naturally, lots of folks want to know what the announcement means for <i>Pathfinder</i> and for our line of monthly <a href="/gameMastery/modules">GameMastery Modules</a>. </p>
<p>Right now, the answer is this: It's too soon to tell. </p>
<p>No one at Paizo has seen a copy of the new rules yet, nor have we seen a draft of the Open Game License for it (yes, there will be one). We have plenty of reasons to believe that the new game will include lots of improvements over the current system, and that the new OGL will, if anything, be even more permissive than the one for 3.0 and 3.5. </p>
<p>Ever since the announcement of the end of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines, we've been careful to say that Wizards of the Coast and Paizo are still on good terms, that we're still communicating with one another, and that we hope to work together in the future. This is not just so much blown smoke. The guys at Wizards have been very forthcoming with information on the new edition, and we look forward to learning even more in the weeks and months to come. I am personally optimistic that this will, for the most part, be a welcome change at my gaming table. </p>
<p>But it's way too early to say what Paizo will be doing about 4th edition. Please give us some time to take a look at the new rules, to take a look at the new OGL, and make an informed decision. We promise we'll let you know what we're planning just as soon as we figure it out ourselves. </p>
<p>For the time being, both the <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> and <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne</i> Adventure Paths will be released as announced for the 3.5 rules set, as will all GameMastery Modules at least up until May of 2008, which is when Wizards will release the 4th edition <i>Player's Handbook</i>.</p>
<p>All of our announced products for the first quarter of 2008 are "rules-light" and should not be adversely affected by the change in edition whether we convert or not. We will be making no significant changes to the announced product schedule. </p>
<p>I'm aware that many Paizo customers will not be converting to 4e. Honestly, before I heard some of the things I heard at Gen Con, I wasn't sure I wanted to convert either. So I sympathize. </p>
<p><i>Pathfinder</i> currently plans to support officially sanctioned conversions for Castles & Crusades and True20, so assuming we <i>do</i> convert, I suspect it is very likely that we (or some affiliated partner) will provide 3.5 conversion guidelines. </p>
<p>Or we might stick with 3.5. We haven't seen the rules yet, and can't make the decision until we do. </p>
<p>One thing I can say for sure: As a gamer I would be a lot happier with a game that doesn't require two hours of prep-time for four hours of play. I have heard that the new system addresses this problem, and that strikes me as excellent. </p>
<p>If Wizards of the Coast can streamline the rules without robbing the game of its variety and complexity, I will be very impressed. </p>
<p>So far, I am optimistic. </p>

<p><b>Mystery of Water Solution:</b> Congratulations to Andrew Garrett, who figured out the correct answer that a 12 HD water naga would need to start making checks to avoid nonlethal damage from thirst after 1 day and 22 hours. Of course, as an aquatic creature, it would suffocate outside of water long before that. </p>

<p>Well, that is all for the <i>Elements of Power</i> set. We will begin previews for our next card set, <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>, in a few months. What's that? You want a taste right now? Okay, take a look at this sketch... hopefully it'll tide you over for a month or two...</p>

<h1>Kaer Maga</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, August 22, 2007</p>
<p>Now that <a href="/store/v5748btpy7zke"><i>D2: Seven Swords of Sin</i></a> is starting to make it out into people's hands, I'd like to talk a little bit about my favorite part of writing it: designing the city of Kaer Maga.</p>

<p>Going into the project, there were two different ideas for where the adventure should be set. For me, it seemed to call for an urban setting, a crazy city where anything went and the law was sketchy at best. Publisher Erik Mona, however, was eager for Varisia to have an iconic castle, a massive dungeon complex that we could return to again and again as we saw fit. The solution? Push the two together and build a city <i>inside</i> a castle—an enormous Thassilonian ruin of unknown function, to be exact. At this point Erik and the rest of the GameMastery team gave me the go-ahead and, armed with the working title "Dark Market," I sat down to write. </p>

<p>As anyone who's played in one of my adventures can probably tell you, I like to play with morality. To me, the interesting thing about evil is that it's so rarely self-identified as such. One of my biggest peeves in adventures, fiction, or film is what we around the office refer to as "moustache-twirling"—villains that are evil simply because they enjoy being evil. (Shortly after that comes my disdain for boring ol' "insanity" as a villain's motive.) In real life, things are usually much more gray and fuzzy—no evil deed exists in a vacuum, and even the most "evil" people I can think of tend to have reasons why their actions make sense in their own minds. </p>

<p>This aesthetic was at the front of my mind when writing about Kaer Maga. To me, all big cities are by definition neutral—get enough people together, they'll balance each other out. In Kaer Maga's case, this neutrality is the result of a free market taken to the extreme, an anarchist, libertarian utopia where people are left to sink or swim entirely through their own machinations. While many would look at the gritty streets, where every shameful vice is yours for the purchasing, and call it evil, I'd point out that Kaer Maga is also the freest of the free cities of Varisia. In rooting the city's "evil" in an ideal many of us share, I hoped to make the scene feel a little more familiar and organic. </p>

<p>Along with the questionable morality, it was important to me that Kaer Maga be a monstrous city, a place where we could get a taste of the alien delights that Golarion has to offer and remind the folks who inhabit Varisia that there's far more beyond the mountains than they might imagine. For those purposes, a city of refugees and squatters seemed perfectly poised to capture the sort of cultural mish-mash that I love in places like <i>Star Wars</i>' Mos Eisley or China Miéville's New Crobuzon. Knowing that I wouldn't have space in a 32-page adventure to truly detail many of the residents, I took a page from some of my favorite sci-fi and fantasy authors and tossed in a bunch of allusions and off-hand references with only the barest explanations. Wormfolk? Bloated Ones? Sweettalkers? When I first wrote those names, at 3:00am in a darkened room, my bleary brain didn't know any more than their names. As soon as I went back and read them, however, my imagination went into overdrive trying to think up what they could be... which is exactly what I hope happens to everyone else. While I couldn't resist from detailing some of them in the Pathfinder Journal for <i>The Hook Mountain Massacre</i>, I promise I'll try to leave at least a few of them alone. </p>

<p>For now. </p>

Assistant Editor, <i>Pathfinder</i><br></p>

<h1>Gen Con Field Report Day 4</h1>
<p class=date>Sunday, August 19, 2007</p>
<p>The end is upon us!</p>

<p>Gen Con has come to a close and we're a bizarre blend of happy and sad to see it stop. We're happy to finally be off our feet and sipping cold drinks by the pool and sad to leave behind a throng of interesting and fun readers, fans, and gamers as we make our way back home tomorrow.</p>

<p>Sunday is the day of last resort as attendees cram the show floor to buy everything that piqued their curiosity the days before. Our booth has seen steady business all day and the early indicators are that this will be the best Gen Con Paizo has ever had.</p>

<p>Paizo Publishing had the distinct honor to sponsor Nick Logue's Iron DM event last night. Yesterday's blog was written before the Iron DM finale and we were excited to present awards to the runners up as well as the grand prize to Iron Dungeon Master "Ancient Sensei," an amazing DM who came in second place last year (by two-tenths of a point on their grading scale) and just edged out the winner of the past two Iron DM events, Iron Dungeon Master "Dreads." This year's ingredients were river rapids, Rakshasas, and redemption; "Ancient Sensei" did not disappoint with his first-hour TPK followed by a trip to hell where his players had to redeem themselves to return to life. Paizo was proud to give the top three Iron DMs a pile of GameMastery goodness, including autographed copies of GameMastery Modules D1 and W1. Ancient Sensei also received Paizo's "secret" prizes which included a copy of D2: Seven Swords of Sin autographed by nearly every Paizo employee who wrote a room for the module, and a huge sword donated by <a href="http://kingofswords.com" target="_blank">KingofSwords.com</a>. You can learn more about Nick Logue's Iron DM by visiting <a href="http://www.irondm.com" target="_blank">irondm.com</a>. We can't wait to sponsor this event again next year!</p>

<p>I can hear the angelic sounds of gaming through my hotel room door so I must heed the call and hastily beat a path to dice rolling. I hope you've enjoyed my four-day look into the Gen Con experience from the eyes of Paizo Publishing&mdash;it was fun to put together, so I hope it was fun to read.</p>

<p>Until next year!

<h1>Gen Con Field Report Day 3</h1>
<p class=date>Saturday, August 18, 2007</p>
<p>Today was another hectic day in the booth! Saturday has the reputation as the busiest day of the con and today was no exception. Paizo's booth was buzzing with the news of our awards last night at the ENnies&mdash;we took home two gold medals for GameMastery Flip-Mat: Tavern (the second year in a row a Flip-Mat has won a gold ENnie) and the Savage Tide Player's Guide free download and our partner company, Open Mind Games, took home a much-deserved silver ENnie for the awesome GameMastery Combat Pad.</p>

<p>We also had Gary Gygax back on hand with us signing The Anubis Murders, as well as Larry Elmore signing the final print issue of Dragon, and our own Paizo editors signing their works as well. James, Wes, Jason, and Jeremy signed a good deal of autographs and it was nice to see the readers and fans patting these guys on the back for their amazing work on Dragon, Dungeon, and Paizo's GameMastery and Pathfinder lines.</p>

<p>Today was also Nicolas Logue's Iron DM. Nick runs this event every year and its reputation as one awesome gaming experience has increased its attendance year-over-year. Iron DM saw 15 Dungeon Masters and over 130 players this year. If you're not familiar with the event, Iron DM is modeled after the Iron Chef television series: DMs get one hour to write an entire adventure using three "ingredients" that Nick reveals at the last second. Once the adventure is written, the DMs find their randomly assigned table of players and begin. The event is often interrupted by mini-games called Player Olympics, wherein the players must compete table-against-table to win prizes and fame. At the end of the day, the Iron DM who receives the best review scores from his or her players wins the crown. Paizo Publishing was proud to sponsor this event, and we gave away buckets of GameMastery items as prizes. I have a video of Nick introducing one of the Iron DMs that I'll upload to YouTube when I return to the office. Nick is most definitely a character and his Iron DM event was a blast.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is our final day at Gen Con and, though my tired feet wish its end, it would be great if the gaming and fun could continue on for another four days.</p>

<p>And now, pictures!</p>

<h1>Gen Con Field Report Day Two</h1>
<p class=date>Friday, August 17, 2007</p>

<p>The second day of any four-day convention is typically referred to as the "slow day."  Retailers and manufacturers complain that nearly every year their business is down, the crowds are down, and Friday is generally a light day. Eager four-day attendees are typically seen swarming the Dealer Hall on Thursday to get the awesome Gen Con exclusives (such as Paizo's alternate Pathfinder #1 cover) and those folks are more inclined to game and rest on Friday. Then the two-day crowd hits with the four-day crowd on Saturday and the show floor turns into a zoo.</p>

<p>Today was slow for us, but we're only able to say so because yesterday was such a huge hit. Pathfinder and GameMastery Modules continue to do very well and I'm pleased to report that our first three Planet Stories novels (<i>The Anubis Murders</i>, <i>City of the Beast</i>, and <i>Black God's Kiss</i>) are selling very well and their positive reception has been exciting to see.</p>

<p>Speaking of <i>The Anubis Murders</i>, Gary Gygax was on hand this afternoon for 90 minutes signing copies of his book and generally anything people asked him to sign. "Keep on the Borderlands" got several Gygax-o-graphs as did the original hardcover Monster Manual, current editions of the core system, badges, convention on-site books&mdash;you name it. Someone jokingly asked Gary to sign their baby and he would've done so, graciously, had they not told him it was a joke. He was a nice guy and it was a real honor to meet him. One quick story about his session in the booth today: a guy walked up, looked at his book and said, "Hmm, Anubis Murders, I'm not familiar with your work. I'll have to go look it up." Gary gave him a stern, reproachful look and said, "Try Dungeons &amp; Dragons." Needless to say, the guy looked very sheepish as he fled the scene.</p>

<p>We also had the pleasure of Wayne Reynolds' presence in our booth today, signing copies of the poster included with Dragon #359. He modeled Pathfinder #1 for us, as you'll see below.</p>

<p>The number one question on everyone's mind, of course, was "What does Paizo think of 4th Edition?" We heard this often and our response was the same each time: we're excited to see it, but we know just as much about it as you do. I can report that WotC intends to have an OGL with 4th Edition and that Paizo's eager to learn more, but that does not put us closer to a decision&mdash;it only puts us in need of more research and discussion. Rest assured, the moment we make a decision we'll scream it to the four corners of the multiverse.</p>

<p>And now, pictures!</p>

  Gen Con Field Report Day One Thursday, August 16, 2007Hello from Gen Con! ...

<h1>Gen Con Field Report Day One</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, August 16, 2007</p>
<p>Hello from Gen Con!</p>

<p>It's broiler hot, the humidity makes you feel like you're walking through a warm pond, and the bodies are stacked so close in the hall when someone trips in aisle 14 the domino effects doesn't stop until aisle 37.</p>

<p>And that's awesome!</p>

<p>We're having one of our best first days at a con ever and it's in no small part due to the crush of Paizo readers and fans that have mobbed our booth to look at and purchase <i>Pathfinder</i>, to play in our Seven Swords of Sin Dungeon Delve, or to watch the latest Dead Gentlemen video. Our booth is busy busy busy and we love it!</p>

<p>Of course, the con is buzzing about the Wizards announcement to take place at 6:30 P.M. Eastern tonight. We're all aware by now that they're announcing 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons tonight and the Paizo staff plans to be in full attendance to usher in the news. Many of you have asked us, "Will Pathfinder/Modules/Paizo/etc switch to 4th edition?" Our response is this: We haven't seen 4th Edition, but we feel that we have a good gauge of our fan base and if we think it's something they will like and support then it's something we will like and support. We always take our readers' and fans' feedback seriously and we'll take feedback on this potential transition doubly so. We hope to have more information soon and we'll let everyone know the moment we've come to a decision.</p>

<p>Now, pictures!</p>

<p>We're currently in the middle of working on <i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7xpt">The Hook Mountain Massacre</a></i>, the third volume of <i>Pathfinder</i>, but we just couldn't wait to show off the new cover, courtesy of fantasy art superstar Wayne Reynolds. We've already introduced Merisiel, our iconic elven rogue, in a previous blog post, but just take a look at those ogres! With those flat teeth and crazy jaws, something about them just screams "Muppet gone wrong." As for how wrong... well, some of that is still up in the air, but let's just say that readers will no doubt conclude that author Nick Logue should probably be in a straightjacket somewhere. Fortunately for us, however, he was still at large and writing as of this posting....</p>

<h1>From Delve to Dungeon</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, August 14, 2007</p>
<p>If you're a regular reader of this blog, you likely already know about Paizo's delve event at this year's GenCon, in which convention attendees will have the chance to run through part of a deadly, trap-filled dungeon, potentially winning fabulous prizes. You also probably know that the delve is closely related to the new GameMastery Module we'll be releasing, <i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7wiz">D2: Seven Swords of Sin</a></i>. But what most people don't know is exactly how one became the other...</p>

<p>The Paizo delve was written as part of an informal internal contest to see who could write the deadliest, most creative dungeon rooms for a set map within a certain EL range. Each of the interested staff members (after deciding the pecking order by rolling initiative, of course) took turns choosing until all of the chambers were parceled out, then took their best shots. The resulting mishmash of horror was then edited, judged highly entertaining, and pronounced ready to be Paizo's first GenCon delve. </p>

<p>But somewhere in the early stages of the project, an idea began to form. Suppose someone had a really good time with the delve, and wanted to take it home to their own party? What if we could have an adventure module there at the show that incorporated most of the delve, plus a bunch of extra material? The decision was made, and I was tapped to give form and structure to our cruel meat grinder of a dungeon.</p>

<p>It wasn't always easy. A delve, for instance, needs only the barest plot&mdash;when each party's only playing for a few minutes, it's hard to get much roleplaying in. For a writer like me who is, admittedly, more of a story fan than an out-and-out brawler, it was an interesting challenge. Where in our world, for instance, could adventurers reasonably expect to find such a varied an eclectic collection of rooms? The answer, as it turns out, is the anarchic squatter's paradise of Kaer Maga, a cliff-top city housed inside the walls of an enormous Thassilonian artifact. Possibly the freest of Varisia's fiercely independent cities (if the most morally questionable), the background material on Kaer Maga remains my favorite part of this module&mdash;so much so that we return to it in the third installment of the Pathfinder's Journal. But more on that next week. </p>

<p>Even with a location, however, we still needed a story capable of tying fiendish dinosaur-riding goblins to eladrin warriors and vampire bladepriests. Once we figured out that Tirana was trying to combine the weapons of the Runelords' ancient champions for her own personal gain, it seemed to me that the natural setting for such a bold experiment would be in a secret, abandoned research facility. Armed with that knowledge, the next step was to trim off the rooms that just didn't fit and retool the ones to make them work together as a unit. Following that came the writing of the new rooms&mdash;because you didn't think we'd just repackage the delve, did you? No, if you get a chance to go to GenCon and see the massive tables covered with three-dimensional dungeon terrain, be sure to keep in mind that all of those rooms amount to about half of the actual adventure. For many of the extra chambers, I enjoyed playing up the research facility aspect, complete with incinerators, recycling units, turbines for proper air circulation, and laboratories with strange new monsters run amuck. And, of course, no module set in a city is complete without at least one gang turf war.</p>

<p>All told, writing D2 was a unique experience, and I hope that those of you who read through it have as much fun as I did. Next week I'll be back with a bit more information about Kaer Maga.</p>

<p>Many of you have asked to be able to combine shipments of <i>Pathfinder</i> subscriptions and GameMastery Modules subscriptions to save on shipping.  Well, we've just made that possible, and with <i>Pathfinder</i> #1 and GameMastery Module D2 shipping next week, now is the perfect time to get a subscription to both <a href="/store/v5748btpy7xpn"><i>Pathfinder</i></a> and <a href="/store/v5748btpy7ym4">GameMastery Modules</a>.</p>

<p>If you're adding a new subscription, you'll be prompted during order checkout to set up your combined shipping. If you've already got subscriptions to both products (and bravo for you!), go to your <a href="https://secure.paizo.com/paizo/account/subscriptions">My Subscriptions</a> page. </p>

<h1>Time on Golarion</h1>
<p class=date>Friday, August 10, 2007</p>
<p>As our messageboards have recently been packed with folks wanting to know more about the day-to-day business of Golarion, the following is a brief introduction to the dating and timing conventions of our world. Rest assured that you'll be able to find out much more&mdash;such as timelines, country overviews, histories, and the rest&mdash;in the forthcoming <a href="/store/v5748btpy7zda"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</i></a>.
<p>Time travels on Golarion much as it does here on our own Earth. Sixty seconds form a minute, sixty minutes create an hour, and twenty-four hours make a day. The people of Golarion measure time much like we do as well, with seven days to a week and twelve 30-day months to a year. Years are marked since the founding of the last great empire, that of Aroden, the Last Man. Although the empire has collapsed, its calendar remains in use to this day. At the start of the campaign, the date is 4707 AR (Absalom Reckoning).</p>

<h2>Days of the Week</h2>
<p>The days of the week are as follows. Each day has a general purpose that most people in the Inner Sea region follow.</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=6>
<tr><td><b>Day</b></td><td><b>General Purpose</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Moonday</td><td>Work, religion [night]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toilday</td><td>Work</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wealday</td><td>Work</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oathday</td><td>Work, pacts signed, oaths sworn</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fireday</td><td>Work</td></tr>
<tr><td>Starday</td><td>Work</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sunday</td><td>Rest, religion</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Months</h2>
<p>The months in Golarion correspond to our own, with each new year starting shortly after the solstice. You'll notice that the name of each month is etymologically tied to a specific god&mdash;residents of Golarion see the gods reflected in the changing of the seasons, and their names for the months reflect this. (Gozreh's month, for instance, is a time of budding and new life, while Zon-Kuthon's is seen as the death of the old year.) Holidays in a given month are generally tied to their patron deity. In order, the months are:</p>

<p>Abadius (January)
<br>Calistril (February)
<br>Pharast (March)
<br>Gozran (April)
<br>Desnus (May)
<br>Sarenith (June)
<br>Erastus (July)
<br>Arodus (August)
<br>Rova (September)
<br>Lamashan (October)
<br>Neth (November)
<br>Kuthona (December)</p>

<h1>Elemental Mysteries, Part 4</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, August 9, 2007</p>
<p>The four elements&mdash;air, earth, fire and water&mdash;have fascinated man for thousands of years. All of the mysteries have now been solved, save one: Water. <a href="/store/v5748btpy7yi6"><i>Elements of Power</i></a>&mdash;the next set in the <a href="/gameMastery/itemPacks">GameMastery Item Card</a> line&mdash;is due to show up in game stores any day now, and if you can solve some of the mysteries of the elements, you might just score a free deck. </p>

<p>One elemental mystery has been presented each week. Answer this week's correctly and get entered into a drawing to win a free deck of <a href="/store/v5748btpy7yi6"><i>Elements of Power</i></a> Item Cards, shipped to you when the set releases. Just send an email with your answer, your name, and your <b>paizo.com</b> screen name to <a href="mailto:contest@paizo.com?subject=Mystery%20of%20Water">contest@paizo.com</a>. Make sure to put the phrase "Mystery of Water" in the subject line of the email.</p>

This week we take a look at the element of water. Often referred to as the giver of life, no other element is more revered and valued than water. There are a number of items in this set with a water or cold theme to them, including armor, weapons, potions, and a wondrous item or two. Look for these and other items like them in the upcoming set. Next week, we'll reveal the final answer and a complete set list.</p>

<p><b>Mystery of Water:</b> How long would it take before a 12 HD water naga would need to start making checks to avoid taking nonlethal damage from thirst? </p>

<p>All answers for the Mystery of Water are due by 12:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, August 16th. Good Luck!</p>

<p><b>Mystery of Fire Solution:</b> Congratulations to Thomas Oakland who figured out the correct answer that a goblin wearing chainmail would need to roll a natural 20 to avoid taking the heat damage (because a 20 always succeeds).

<h1>Desna Detailed</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, August 8, 2007</p>
<p>With work on <a href="/store/v5748btpy7xps"><i>The Skinsaw Murders</i></a> wrapping up, we thought we'd give you a brief taste of Sean K Reynolds' insightful exploration into Desna, Golarion's goddess of luck, travel, and more. Presented here is one of several key myths tied to her faith and frequently repeated by members of her flock, as well as a fabulous rendering of her holy symbol by Savage Tide alumnus Ben Wootten.</p>

<p><b>Lamashtu's Trap:</b> In her earliest days as a goddess, Desna's mentor was Curchanus, a mostly forgotten god of beasts, travel, and endurance, and she spent many nights listening to stories of his travels. Curchanus's enemy was Lamashtu, an equally ancient goddess of monsters, madness, and nightmares who longed for his control over beasts. Lamashtu set a trap for Curchanus, leading him on a strange wandering path into her realm, where she swarmed him with horrible monsters, finally attacking in the guise of a great deformed jackal, tearing his beast-dominion from him. This wound was too great for the elder deity, and as his last act he willed his power over travel to Desna. Since this theft, wild animals have treated mankind as an outsider and an enemy rather than a part of nature, and Desna has searched far and wide to find a way to force Lamashtu to surrender Curchanus's stolen power. The faithful use this story to remind them of Lamashtu's treachery, to honor Curchanus's gift to Desna, and to remind them that failure is just a setback, not an end.</p>

<h1>The Fey Are Coming</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, August 7, 2007</p>
<p><i><a href="/store/v5748btpy7zd8">GameMastery Module W1: Conquest of Bloodsworn Vale</a></i> has arrived in our warehouse and is about to ship to subscribers (although if you sign up now, you can still get the module and a free PDF). Although I've chatted about fey before, now is as good time to look at the fey in this module with some detail. If you plan on playing this module be forewarned&mdash;spoilers lurk below.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about the Roseblood Sprites, presented as a Knowledge (nature) skill check.</p>

<table align=center border=0 cellspacing=12 width="75%">
<tr><th>DC</th><th align=left>Information</th></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>13</td><td>Roseblood Sprites are evil fey that live in an area known as Bloodsworn Vale. They are a menace to travelers and workmen alike, and even to adventurers if encountered in a large group (known as a bushel).</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>18</td><td>These fey have the ability to transform into ordinary rose bushes, and have a penchant for using the beautifully thorny plants in their armor and weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>23</td><td>Roseblood Sprites have a number of magical abilities involving trickery, and can pass through wooded areas with ease.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>28</td><td>Roseblood Sprites who congregate in large groups are often led by a king who is far more powerful than his kin, with the ability to awaken rosebushes and turn them into sprites.</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<img src="/image/content/GameMasteryModules/roseking_180.jpeg" align=right>
<blockquote>
	<p>Beyond this basic information, the fey living in Bloodsworn Vale have another nasty habit. As of late, their victims have been found mutilated, missing one or both of their ears. Rumors hold that this is some sort of trophy gathering by the malicious sprites, but some say that something far more sinister is afoot.</p>
	
	<p>Well, that's all for <i>Conquest of Bloodsworn Vale</i>. If you've not checked out this module, stop by your local game store, visit our booth at GenCon, or take a look through some of the other posts on this blog. Next week, we'll start "delving" into <a href="/store/v5748btpy7wiz"><i>D2: Seven Swords of Sin</i></a>.</p>

What are you waiting for? It's <i>free!</i>

<p>Ahem. We now return you to the topic at hand: module letter designations.

<p>So <a href="/store/v5748btpy7xpy">D0: Hollow's Last Hope</a> is a prequel of sorts to <a href="/store/v5748btpy7yqz"><i>D1: Crown of the Kobold King</i></a>. It follows, then, that <a href="/store/magazines/v5748btpy7wiz">D2</a> is a sequel to D1. Right?</p>

<p>Well, no, actually. D2 is completely unrelated to D0 and D1. On the other hand, <a href="/store/v5748btpy7x86">E1</a> is set in Falcon's Hollow, the settlement that serves as the starting point of D0 and D1. Confused yet? Let us help sort out things a bit.</p>

</blockquote>
<a href="/store/v5748btpy7x6k"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9504_180.jpeg" border=0 align=right hspace=12></a>
<blockquote>
<p>These alphanumeric designators hearken back to the old way of numbering modules from the earliest days of RPGs. With a few exceptions (the A, D, G, and Q series, for example) the older module lines used their alphanumeric designators to denote adventures of a similar nature that aren't related. Don't think of any series designator we've announced so far as being a set of sequels you can run one after another. Consider each adventure separately unless it specifically calls itself a sequel to an earlier adventure. The designator is just there to tell you what kind of adventure to expect, with the number telling you the order in which we published it.</p>

<p>What, then, do the designators mean?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>D is for Dungeon.</b> These adventures take place primarily in a dungeon, whether that means an underground complex or some other kind of self-contained area for PCs to explore.</p>

<p><b>E is for Event.</b> These adventures focus on some kind of event you can place anywhere you want, such a jousting tournament, a royal wedding, or (as in the example of <a href="/store/v5748btpy7x86">E1</a>) a carnival. Although all E adventures will be set somewhere in our campaign setting, they are the easiest to place anywhere you want or need them. </p>

<p><b>J is for Journey.</b> These adventures either focus on a journey to some exotic locale or else deal with what you find once you get to such an interesting place. (<a href="/store/v5748btpy7x6l">J1</a> takes place in Osirion, the Egypt analog of Golarion.)</p>

<p><b>U is for Urban.</b> These adventures take place in cities and focus on the kinds of adventures you can only have when surrounded by thousands of other people. (<a href="/store/v5748btpy7x6k">U1</a> occurs in a wealthy district of Absalom, one of the largest cities on Golarion.)</p>

</blockquote></blockquote>
<a href="/store/v5748btpy7wiz"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9503_180.jpeg" border=0 align=left hspace=12></a>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>W is for Wilderness.</b> These adventures occur in the wild places of the world. You might have a hint of civilization in a W adventure, but the main focus is on the untamed areas. (PCs in <a href="/store/v5748btpy7zd8">W1</a> attempt to civilize Bloodsworn Vale.)</p>

<p><b>C is for Cookie.</b> That's good enough for me.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>At some point in the future we will undoubtedly release modules that belong together in a series, at which point we'll likely give them their own designators. There have been whispers of an M series, for example, wherein Erik Mona creates several linked adventures set on our southern continent. And, of course, sequels to previous adventures in a series might occasionally crop up. We'll make sure to make that very clear when it happens.</p>

<h1>Elemental Mysteries, Part 3</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, August 2, 2007</p>
<p>The four elements&mdash;air, earth, fire and water&mdash;have fascinated man for thousands of years. Yet, there are still many mysteries that have yet to be solved. <a href="/store/v5748btpy7yi6"><i>Elements of Power</i></a>&mdash;the next set in the <a href="/gameMastery/itemPacks">GameMastery Item Card</a> line&mdash;is due to release next month, and if you can solve some of the mysteries of the elements, you might just score a free deck. </p>

<p>One elemental mystery will be presented each week. Answer it correctly and get entered into a drawing to win a free deck of <a href="/store/v5748btpy7yi6"><i>Elements of Power</i></a> Item Cards, shipped to you when the set releases. Just send an email with your answer, your name, and your <b>paizo.com</b> screen name to <a href="mailto:contest@paizo.com?subject=Mystery%20of%20Fire">contest@paizo.com</a>.
Make sure to put the phrase "Mystery of Fire" in the subject line of this week's email.</p>

<p>This week we take a look at the element of fire. Perhaps no other element has fascinated man more than fire, and for good reason. Whereas fire can destroy, its cleansing can also lead to new life. There are a number of items in this set with a fire theme, including weapons, potions, staffs, and a wondrous item or two, each one looking like it might just burn you to a crisp. Look for these and other items like them in the upcoming set. Next week, we'll take a look at the final element.</p>

<p><b>Mystery of Fire:</b> What would an ordinary goblin wearing chainmail need to roll on its Fortitude save to successfully avoid taking damage during his second hour spent in 114 degree heat? </p>

<p>All answers for the Mystery of Fire are due by 12:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, August 9th. Good Luck!</p>

<p><b>Mystery of Earth Solution:</b> Congratulations to Joshua Blazej, who figured out the correct answer that a stone giant could only throw a Small earth elemental (as it weighs 80 pounds, the maximum allotted weight for a rock thrown by a Huge giant).</p>

This massive two-story structure is home to Sir Gyrad Tolgrith (NG male human fighter 4/ranger 2) and all of his men. The first floor of the structure contains the meeting hall, armory, mess hall, kitchen, and storage rooms. The second floor contains a smaller, private meeting hall, the barracks, the planning room, and Sir Tolgrith's private quarters.</p>

<p>Fort Thorn's current staff includes 40 soldiers (LG male human warrior 2), 4 scouts (NG male human ranger 2), 2 sergeants (LG male human fighter 4), and Sir Tolgrith.</p>

<h2>A6. The Boar's Bones</h2>
<p>Shortly after settling the fort, the soldiers faced their first crisis when the food caravan was late and their supplies ran low. Sir Tolgrith sent out his scouts to forage and hunt, but after three days they had not found much. On the fourth day they scored big, dragging the carcass of an enormous dire boar back into camp at the same time the supply caravan finally arrived. During the evening's festivities, the boar was picked clean and the fort's cook, Orrend, kept the bones.</p>

<p>A month later, Orrend (CG male halfling expert 3) opened up the Boar's Bones, a small inn and tavern, to serve the off-duty soldiers, workers, and visitors who happened to stop by. The bones were carefully reconstructed with wire and wood, and the now-intact dire boar skeleton sits in the middle of the tavern with a pouch hanging from its tusks. Orrend insists that any tips given to the boar are sent to its grieving kin.</p>

<p>The food at the Boar's Bones is of good quality (4 sp per meal), combining local ingredients with caravan supplies. Orrend has yet to perfect his rose petal ale, so whenever he has a new batch ready, all tankards of it are half price (2 cp). Rooms at the Boar's Bones are simple, with only a single cot, washbasin, and cupboard apiece, but clean and free of vermin (1 gp per night).
<h2>A8. Shrine to Erastil</h2>
<p>Every morning, the lone bell of this stone shrine tolls twice to start the prayer service. The shrine is dedicated to Erastil (LG god of hunting, trade, farming, and family), also known as "Old Deadeye." The shrine's lone cleric, Father Apar (LG male human cleric 5), tends to the spiritual needs of the community, including healing and other minor spellcasting. Father Apar offers these services for free to the soldiers, but all others must pay the usual price. Father Apar also has a number of divine potions and scrolls for sale, but none worth more than 300 gp.</p>

<p>Father Apar's morning sermons are usually quite calm affairs, with the elderly cleric reading from holy scriptures and addressing current concerns. Sir Tolgrith makes sure to attend twice per week, but never on a regular schedule. After the morning prayers, Father Apar walks around town, talking to the locals about their problems or tending to the sick. Once per week, after the day's labor is over, Father Apar invites all to an archery challenge in front of the fort. To the winner he gifts a potion of his own creation (usually cure light wounds).</p>

<p>There are, of course, many more places to visit in Fort Thorn, but I'll leave those secrets for you to discover.</p>
