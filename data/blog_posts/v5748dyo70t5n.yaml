  \    </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello, Paizo community!\
  \ With the launch of Starfinder Society Second Edition, I figure it’s the perfect\
  \ time to issue a call for new volunteers interested in serving as venture officers\
  \ for Paizo Organized Play. Whether you’re excited about the new science-fantasy\
  \ future of Starfinder, dedicated to the classic fantasy of Pathfinder, or ready\
  \ to mix the two together, we’ve got an incredible worldwide community of more than\
  \ 700 volunteers ready to welcome their nufriends!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>What\
  \ Venture Officers Do</h2>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  \ by Marko Horvatin</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Our volunteer venture\
  \ officers (VOs for short) serve a variety of functions for the program. Most are\
  \ involved with organizing games at their local stores and supporting their communities.\
  \ While this call is geared towards in-person play, we also follow the same structure\
  \ for our online region and have venture officers focused on virtual tabletop or\
  \ asynchronous play as well.</p>\n      <p><strong>Venture Agents (VAs)</strong>\
  \ are the store-level coordinators and often oversee scheduling games at one or\
  \ two stores. They work with the store owner and employees to share information\
  \ and speak with their communities to find out what adventures they’d like to play.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Venture Lieutenants</strong><strong>(VLs)</strong> supervise Venture\
  \ Agents, often overseeing a city or town. They also typically take up lead positions\
  \ for local conventions, helping to schedule games and organize GMs for these events.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Venture Captains (VCs)</strong> and <strong>Regional Venture Coordinators</strong>\
  \ (RVCs) are our top-level organizers. They supervise large cities, states, or multi-state\
  \ or country regions and help to advise the OP staff on how things are going in\
  \ their assigned areas.</p>\n      <p>We also have a rich community of online play,\
  \ both in the independent online region as well as online offerings from many of\
  \ our primarily in-person lodges. Whether you’re running online or in-person, there’\
  s a role for you in our organization.</p>\n      <p>Venture officers can also join\
  \ task forces focused on specific objectives, such as the Onboarding Task Force,\
  \ which creates new player resources, or the Guide Team, which maintains the Guide\
  \ to Organized Play. Joining one of these groups isn’t required but is another way\
  \ to support our program if you have the skills and interest.</p>\n      <br>\n\

  >Illustration by Rodrigo Gallo</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>On top of\
  \ being part of our incredible community, venture officers receive perks depending\
  \ on their rank.</p>\n      <p>All venture officers, regardless of rank, receive\
  \ <strong>free PDFs</strong> of every Pathfinder and Starfinder Society scenario\
  \ we’ve ever published. No matter what your community wants to play, you’ll have\
  \ access to that adventure! Venture Captains and Regional Venture Coordinators also\
  \ receive PDFs of all Paizo products as a thanks for their hard work and time spent\
  \ with the program.</p>\n      <p>Venture officers also qualify for the <strong>convention\
  \ reimbursement program</strong>, where they can receive a limited number of Paizo\
  \ vouchers for organizing conventions in their areas. These events often take more\
  \ time and effort than simple in-store play, and so we want to be sure volunteers\
  \ are properly rewarded.</p>\n      <p>At certain major conventions, such as PaizoCon\
  \ and Gen Con, venture officers also qualify for <strong>increased rewards</strong>based\
  \ on their rank. Typically, this takes the form of additional vouchers or earlier\
  \ qualification for rewards like GM badges, but this varies by show.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>All venture officers are invited to our special <strong>Discord server</strong>!\
  \ This is used to disseminate information to all volunteers, as well as provide\
  \ them access to certain resources like images for signs and advance knowledge of\
  \ scenarios for planning purposes.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>How to Become a Venture\
  \ Officer</h2>\n      <p>If you’re interested in volunteering your services, reach\
  \ out to us! You can find your local Regional Venture Coordinator’s email <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/organizedplay/regions\">on this page</a>; contact them with your\
  \ information and where you’re located, and they can connect you with any local\
  \ networks in the area.</p>\n      <p>You can also start organizing on your own\
  \ at your local game store! Work with them to find a time that works, post signups,\
  \ and recruit new players! Anybody can be a store coordinator as long as you’re\
  \ following the <a href=\"https://lorespire.paizo.com/\">Guide to Organized Play</a>\
  \ and reporting your games back to us.</p>\n      <p>Finally, if you don’t have\
  \ any game stores or volunteers near you, reach out to me! Email me at organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com,\
  \ and I’ll get you in touch with whoever’s closest to start building out your local\
  \ network.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Organized Play Foundation</h2>\n      <br>\n\
