  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">One of my earliest goals when I took over\
  \ as developer of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign in fall 2010 was\
  \ to increase the internal continuity within the campaign. In the 2-1/2 years since,\
  \ we've upped the metaplot elements of the campaign and have featured a number of\
  \ recurring villains, locations, and subplots (with more to come!). It took a few\
  \ years to build up the momentum I'd hoped for with the campaign's many interacting\
  \ pieces, but I think we're finally there! It's fitting, then, that we hired John\
  \ to take the torch from me (albeit after several more months of mentorship on my\
  \ part) just as I feel we've attained the loftiest goal I set for myself all those\
  \ years ago.</span></p> \n    <p>I'm particularly proud of our recently released\
  \ Season 4 exclusive scenario, <i>Day of the Demon</i>, written by fan-favorite\
  \ author Larry Wilhelm. This scenario serves as thematic link between last year\
  \ and the concluding scenarios of the Year of the Ruby Phoenix, the current season—\
  the Year of the Risen Rune—and next season, which we're calling the Year of the\
  \ Demon. (Notice the similarity in titles between the season and the scenario? That\
  \ wasn't an accident). Larry did a bang-up job on this scenario, and I'm glad it\
  \ will be run exclusively for the next year by the campaign's most dedicated volunteers,\
  \ including our growing army of regional coordinators (both Venture-Captains and\
  \ Venture-Lieutenants) and 4- and 5-star Game Masters.</p> \n    <p><i>Day of the\
  \ Demon</i> is a scenario that no Pathfinder Society player should miss out on,\
  \ so encourage your regional coordinator or local celebrity GM to run this one for\
  \ you. This poor character (a young girl named Tilly Anders) is counting on your\
  \ heroic PC to save her from a terrible, terrible fate. How can you say no to a\
  \ face like that?</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div>\
