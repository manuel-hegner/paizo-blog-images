  \ \n     <p>Time flies when you're on a deadline every single month.</p> \n    \
  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">It surely doesn't feel like 100 months have passed\
  \ since <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\">\"Burnt Offerings,\"</a> the first volume\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>, showed\
  \ up on my desk. A lot has changed for me in those 100 months—I've moved my place\
  \ of residence, my job's moved ITS place of residence, I've lost more than 150 pounds,\
  \ I've gained countless new friends and industry contacts, and more. It hasn't all\
  \ been good—some friends are gone, some doors have closed, and as THEY are fond\
  \ of saying, \"mistakes were made.\" But sitting here now, looking at the 100th\
  \ volume of Pathfinder, I can categorically state that overall, things have gone\
  \ really quite well over those past 100 months. I couldn't be prouder of how this\
  \ volume turned out... or more nervous, frankly. I hope folks like the adventure!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was as early as <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> that Erik Mona started\
  \ putting the 100 Bug in my head, of course. At that time, it was still years in\
  \ the future, but it was pretty obvious that, barring cataclysmic apocalypse-related\
  \ events, we WERE going to make it to that stage. \"What should we do for volume\
  \ 100?\" became an increasingly pressing question. The answer was more complicated\
  \ than one might initially think, since the way math works meant that volume 100\
  \ of Pathfinder Adventure Path wouldn't coincide nicely with any other significant\
  \ event—it wasn't going to be the first or last volume of an Adventure Path, nor\
  \ would it sync up with any other notable Paizo-related anniversaries. It was, in\
  \ fact, smack in the middle of an Adventure Path, and that raised some challenges.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The end result, of course, is now out for folks to see. <a href=\"/products/btpy9grm\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #100</a> is 32 pages longer than any other volume of\
  \ the Adventure Path. It's the first one to contain a foldout poster (presenting\
  \ an awesome depiction of the first 102 volumes of the Adventure Path along with\
  \ a minis-scale map of an encounter area that plays a key role three times in the\
  \ campaign—twice in this adventure!). It's the first one where we've spent more\
  \ than half a page discussing one of the setting's most talked-about and mysterious\
  \ characters—the dead god Aroden. (And no, we still don't tell you HOW he died.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And of course, I fully admit to certain self-indulgences I made along\
  \ the way. What's the point of being Creative Director if you can't claim volume\
  \ 100's adventure as one you write? Or if you can't put one of your favorite characters\
  \ in the adventure? Of course, I went even beyond that—I wrote the adventure, one\
  \ of the commemorative NPCs, and two of the monsters (Adam will be around later\
  \ to talk more about that half of the book and more). And I didn't just put one\
  \ of my favorite characters in the adventure—I put her on the cover.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Anyway, enough about that! There's a lot more going on in <a href=\"/products/btpy9grm\"\
  >\"A Song of Silver\"</a> than my pet NPCs—so go grab your copy and check it out!\
  \ Or if you don't have a copy handy yet... then check out some of the incredible\
  \ art from volume 100 below!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
