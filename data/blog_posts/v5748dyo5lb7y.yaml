  articleBody\"> \n     <p>Over the last few years, we've made a habit of writing\
  \ up introductions to our iconic characters, offering insight into who they are,\
  \ where they come from, and their motives for adventuring. Just last week we presented\
  \ our oracle, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/meetTheIconics/v5748dyo5lb5m\">Alahazra</a>,\
  \ as the first of the new iconics from the base classes in the <i><a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</a></i>. Yet as we did so, we realized that\
  \ we'd forgotten someone very important: our iconic fighter, Valeros! Whereas the\
  \ other characters all got elaborate write-ups, poor Valeros was first into the\
  \ fray (as always) and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/valeros/v5748dyo5la78\">got barely\
  \ a paragraph</a> before we went on to ramble <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/valeros/v5748dyo5labc\"\
  >about the new RPG</a>. And if there's anything Valeros hates, it's being ignored.\
  \ So now, at long last, Pathfinder's first fighting man gets his due.</p> \n   \

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Valeros was born\
  \ on a quiet farm in Andoran, where he grew up listening to the tales of traveling\
  \ merchants soldiers and dreaming of adventure and exploration. Though this longing\
  \ only increased as he grew older, so too did the demands of helping his aging parents\
  \ run the farm, and slowly but surely the mounting responsibilities of agricultural\
  \ life quashed any possibility of travel or seeing the world. Finally, just a month\
  \ before a marriage of convenience to a local farmer's daughter could lock him into\
  \ place (but not before he'd sampled a few of the joys of married life), Valeros\
  \ came to the realization that the door to a storybook life of adventure was at\
  \ last closing for good. Seized by a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than\
  \ cattle and corn, Valeros packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with\
  \ no more than a change of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to\
  \ discourage any ruffians who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become\
  \ a theme that would follow him for the rest of his life. </p> \n    <p>In the years\
  \ since, Valeros has come a long way from the wide-eyed young man who sought only\
  \ the joy of exploration (and maybe a pretty, worldly girl or three to regale with\
  \ his stories). Life on the road, it seems, is much harder than the bards' tales,\
  \ and adult Valeros has the scars to prove it. Discovering himself to be a deft\
  \ hand with a sword, Valeros quickly fell in with the rough-and-tumble mercenary\
  \ crowd, there learning the dirtier, grittier facts of warfare. Though none could\
  \ deny his prowess with a blade (or better yet, two), Valeros's association with\
  \ various mercenary groups never seemed to last for long. There was his time as\
  \ a guard for the Aspis Consortium, which ended when certain shipments kept coming\
  \ in light under Valeros's watch (never mind that the exploited locals were dying\
  \ for lack of grain, and only needed a little to make it through the winter). Then\
  \ there was the stint as a freelance bounty hunter, during which Valeros discovered\
  \ that it's a lot easier to hunt down escaped murderers than it is to haul in a\
  \ young woman on the run from a loveless marriage. And of course, there was the\
  \ infamous incident with the Band of the Mauler, to which Valeros will only say\
  \ that he was <i>positive</i> their leader had been crushed under that cave-in,\
  \ or else he never would have touched the man's wife.</p> \n    <p>In the end, after\
  \ acting as hired muscle for dozens of different employers, Valeros finally realized\
  \ that the only way to keep from getting blamed for things which weren't his fault—\
  not really—was to go into business for himself as an adventurer, traveling with\
  \ those who properly appreciated him and letting those who didn't fall by the wayside.\
  \ And if some of those companions happen to be pretty women, such as a certain <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/seoni\">Varisian sorcerer</a> or <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/merisiel\"\
  >elven rogue</a>, all the better. </p> \n    <p>While admittedly not the best at\
  \ following orders, Valeros is an extremely talented two-blade fighter, easily earning\
  \ his keep in any group through the tenacity and absolute fearlessness—some might\
  \ say thoughtlessness—with which he flings himself into combat. Despite his reputation\
  \ as a bruiser and scofflaw, Valeros has picked up a fair bit of education here\
  \ and there during his travels, and can even read (something his \"respectable\"\
  \ parents never learned to do). A worshiper of Cayden Cailean—the only god who properly\
  \ understands the need for freedom in the common man's existence—Valeros takes an\
  \ easy-come, easy-go approach to life, wealth, and relationships. Though a fan of\
  \ fine weapons and creature comforts, the only object he's never without is the\
  \ tankard on his belt (for you never know when someone might offer you a drink).\
  \ Noble at heart, and fiercely loyal to those few who manage the considerable feat\
  \ of establishing themselves in his affections, Valeros nevertheless hides such\
  \ sentiments under a jaded and crass demeanor, frequently observing that there's\
  \ nothing better than \"an evening of hard drinking and soft company.\"</p> \n \
