  \ inside ourselves, and it’s time to let her roar.”</em></p> \n     <p>That’s an\
  \ excerpt from the foreword Viola Davis wrote in the <em>NIOBE: She is Life</em>\
  \ hardcover. This was just before Niobe and her entire world of ASUNDA was optioned\
  \ by HBO a couple of years ago, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/03/asunda-drama-series-based-epic-fantasy-comics-hbo-sebastian-a-jones-1202581186/\"\
  >where we are in development</a>.</p> \n     <p>Now, after several graphic novels\
  \ in Niobe’s world, we are launching her next comic series titled <em>NIOBE &amp;\
  \ DURA: Wrath of the Ancient</em>, which I cowrote with Prentice Penny. I had the\
  \ honor of working with Prentice at HBO. The comic drops August 28th on Kickstarter\
  \ at 10 a.m., where you can also get the incredible <em>Pathfinder: Niobe</em> Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition module, plus a model mini (by Mythic) and LARP swords (by Calimacil),\
  \ and beautiful art by David Mack (Daredevil), Jae Lee (The Dark Tower), and Hyoung\
  \ Taek Nam (The Last of Us). <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sebastianajones/niobe-and-dura-wrath-of-the-ancient-1?ref=7r1ufe&amp;token=a3066303\"\

  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>The stories themselves are rooted\
  \ in themes that reflect our own truths, and the lies we tell ourselves. Our struggles,\
  \ our fears and hopes, our love… and second chances. The first tale, <em>THE UNTAMED</em>,\
  \ is about a sinner who makes a deal with the devil to return from hell to avenge\
  \ his family—seven days for seven souls. But even he can find redemption, and that’\
  s when he meets Niobe. As for Niobe herself, she is always battling her own doubts\
  \ about who she is, and who we want her to be—something we can all relate to. She\
  \ is not only Half-Elven but also half-angel and half-demon to reflect the duality\
  \ of spirit we all share and battle with.</p> \n     <p>With several books in Niobe’\
  s world of Asunda out, our new NIOBE &amp; DURA tale threads much of her story together,\
  \ and it starts to reveal how the world was created by the great shaman DURA and\
  \ her (now evil and undead brother) VASTAR, first child of the Devil. I couldn’\
  t be more excited to share this with folks who love that stuff—worldbuilding—to\
  \ you guys, the gaming community. Especially as the character class OMDAR/OMDURA\
  \ in the Pathfinder module is literally derived from the character Dura, who trains\
  \ Niobe for a period in her life. </p> \n     <p>So, if you are into fantasy tales\
  \ and games, which I can only guess you are if you’re reading this, I hope you get\
  \ a chance to check out our campaign. There are opportunities to get the new stuff\
  \ but also every other book in our world, plus the amazing module created in partnership\
  \ with Paizo. </p> \n     <p>Thanks and much love!<br> <b>Seb</b></p> \n     <br\

  \ \n      <p><em>A young Niobe is in the care of the great shaman Dura. They are\
  \ fleeing the first undead, Vastar, Dura’s own brother returned from hell as the\
  \ Devil’s horseman. He has just decimated the tribe that has raised Niobe, and now\
  \ Dura must teach Niobe who she can be all the while knowing WHAT she could become\
  \ if she falls into Vastar's hands. If Vastar can get to Niobe, Dura will have to\
  \ make the ultimate choice. </em></p> \n      <p><em>Niobe is half-human, half-elven\
  \ and direct heir to the thrones of both realms who are at war. But Niobe is also\
  \ half-angel and half-demon. For within her lies the spirit of the Goddess and the\
  \ Devil, and both will move heaven and hell to make her their champion.</em></p>\
