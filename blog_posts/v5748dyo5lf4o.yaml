  \    <p></p> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>Let me tell you about my character.\
  \ In James Jacobs's \"Sands of the Scorpion God\" campaign, I play a catfolk ranger/rogue\
  \ who dual-wields sickles. His name is Pr'ral. He helped his fellow adventurers\
  \ infiltrate a subterranean city run by evil cultists of Rovagug, but we got captured\
  \ when a badass umbral dragon left us all blind and weakened and pretty much helpless.\
  \ We were placed in a gladiatorial arena and forced to fight giant-riding morlocks\
  \ and other terrible foes. In the final round of the arena fight, we were pitted\
  \ against a powerful glabrezu demon named Bezilak. And he mopped the floor with\
  \ us.</p></span> \n     <p>With my allies unconscious and bleeding out or fleeing,\
  \ Pr'ral was the only one who could save them. So I made a deal with the demon.\
  \ Communicating telepathically, we came to an agreement, and in so doing, I saved\
  \ my companions from certain death before a cheering crowd. But the cost was high.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My alignment shifted from chaotic neutral to chaotic evil, and Bezilak\
  \ and I now have a much more intimate relationship. The specific details of the\
  \ arrangement haven't been revealed to anyone but James and I, so I won't go into\
  \ them here, but needless to say, Pr'ral is a very different character now that\
  \ he saved his friends. He now cares only for himself, and will (and has) abandoned\
  \ his fellows in their times of need if it serves him. He's also started taking\
  \ levels in assassin. And when he needs things that he can't find (like a <i>ring\
  \ of invisibility</i> that would have otherwise been unavailable in Sothis at the\
  \ time) Bezilak has come to his aid.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     \

  ></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Fabio Gorla\n     </div>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>While\
  \ Pr'ral isn't quite intelligent enough to recognize the error of his ways, I do\
  \ not lack such insight into the machinations of demonkind, and every session has\
  \ been stressful, as I await Bezilak's next appearance and the inevitable calling\
  \ in of what Pr'ral owes him. So imagine my surprise and—I'll be honest—horror,\
  \ when I was editing <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvo\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Demons Revisited</i></a>, and I came across a familiar character as the sample\
  \ glabrezu. Yeah, it was Bezilak. I was then forced to read (in the process of editing)\
  \ the deep, dark truth of how vile a creature and sinister a manipulator he truly\
  \ was. I think it was James's own demonic means of torturing me. He certainly got\
  \ a good laugh out of it when he found out that I was doing an editing pass on the\
  \ book.</p> \n     <p>Game Masters looking to add that same sort of terror to their\
  \ demon-filled games will find plenty of additional inspiration in <i>Demons Revisited</i>,\
  \ including a number of influential members of each demonic race that NPCs can summon\
  \ or who can be archvillains themselves in myriad campaigns. Further, each of the\
  \ 10 demons presented in the book also features a variant of the half-demon template\
  \ specifically designed to reflect the abilities and flavor of the specific demonic\
  \ races. Demons are unpredictable, wholly evil, and unfathomably twisted creatures,\
  \ and <i>Pathfinder Camapaign Setting: Demons Revisited</i> captures the raw madness\
  \ like no book before it.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland <br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
