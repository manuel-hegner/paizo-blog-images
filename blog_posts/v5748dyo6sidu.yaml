  ><em>Starfinder Society Intro: Year of Redemption’s Rise</em></a></h3> \n      <p>Hi\
  \ again, long time no see! I had the distinct honor of writing the Intro to the\
  \ Year of Redemption’s Rise. As a first Starfinder scenario (indeed, a first, full-length\
  \ adventure), this was a daunting task, but I’ve never been one to shy away from\
  \ a challenge.</p> \n      <p>My goal was not only to introduce the three new factions\
  \ in fun and unique ways, but to give a “day in the life” of a Starfinder at the\
  \ Lorespire Complex. I’m very pleased with how it turned out! I took inspiration\
  \ from my time as a camp counselor and tour guide to write Charla’s tour, which\
  \ was great fun (and apparently accidentally established an author trademark? Stay\
  \ tuned for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em></a> to learn what\
  \ that means). My favorite thing to do when I run this scenario is to pepper in\
  \ some of my favorite NPCs; players will often encounter Olive and Violet leading\
  \ Fitch’s children on a heist through the kitchen or see Barsala working away in\
  \ the research labs. I also got to give Ehu what I referred to as his “Kennedy moment”\
  \ in the conclusion (we must repair the Society in this decade and do the other\
  \ things, not because they are easy but because they are hard…).</p> \n      <p>You\
  \ can follow me on Bluesky (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alexspeidel.bsky.social\"\
  >@alexspeidel.bsky.social</a>) or Mastodon (alexspeidel@dice.camp), and as mentioned\
  \ above, my next scenario is another tentpole: <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06:\
  \ Tomorrow’s Seekers</em>, wherein you’ll meet the new First Seeker candidates.\

  \ \n      <p>Hi there friends, I’m Alison Cybe. Pronouns are they/them or she/her.\
  \ I’m the author of the Starfinder Scenario <em>Fugue of the Traitor</em>.</p> \n\
  \      <p>In it, I wanted to mix a classic Agatha Christie style murder-mystery\
  \ with an exploration into grassroots liberation movements; why groups of people\
  \ rise to fight for themselves against oppressive cultures. Not a common mix of\
  \ themes, but I’m a firm believer that the games we play can be about subjects and\
  \ that entertainment media should always have something to say.</p> \n      <p>I\
  \ penned the adventure over a year ago now, and I’ve had time to look back on what\
  \ sections I enjoy the most and what I would change. I think the mystery section\
  \ is the element that comes across the best, allows the players to get stuck in;\
  \ but I would have loved it more if I’d have had more time to frame the NPCs and\
  \ let the characters know them. I sometimes worry that I went overboard on the descriptions\
  \ of imperialist atrocities, as that is what content warnings are for.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>This year is my foray into creating adventures for Pathfinder Society, and\
  \ you can find my adventure, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ejh?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-502-The-Blackwood-Lost\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-02: </em><em>The Blackwood Lost</em></a>, on\
  \ sale this month. Inspirations for it include the covers of many prog rock albums.\
  \ How is that an inspiration? Play it and see! I was also allowed to work in a subplot\
  \ that’s very important to me...</p> \n      <p>You can find me on twitter <a href=\"\

  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-04: Fragment of the 4th</em></a></h3> \n   \
  \   <p>Hey everyone, my name is Isis Wozniakowska (she/her), and I wrote <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society Scenario </em><em>#5-04: Fragment of the 4<sup>th</sup></em>, one of season\
  \ 5’s the Drift Crisis themed scenarios for levels 9-12. It was my first major foray\
  \ into writing something that high of level, though I’ve played through several\
  \ Starfinder Adventure Paths and tons of scenarios of those levels and love seeing\
  \ what the game can do up there and what kinds of crazy abilities players can have.\
  \ My main priority was making sure the scenario really felt like a continuation\
  \ of so many things the Starfinders have done across the past seasons and make sure\
  \ that even in times like the Drift Crisis, they have made a good impact on the\
  \ universe and can keep doing so if they stick to it. I won’t spoil anything that\
  \ happens, but I’m super proud of the NPCs in it and how they remind us that Starfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play is a living campaign with continuity. Aside from that I’\
  m also just happy because it’s high level content and truly we all get that great\
  \ endorphin rush when the numbers go up. Big number go BrrrRRRrrrr!</p> \n     \

  \ \n      <p>Hello! I'm Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm) a Minneapolis librarian and\
  \ writer. I am here today to talk about my favorite <em>Starfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #5-06: Tarnished Legacy: Historia's Holdout</em>. I loved writing this scenario\
  \ because it is part mystery, part wacky dungeon delve, and all heart. If you haven't\
  \ played it yet, I hope that it surprises you in the best possible way.</p> \n \
  \     <p>One of the challenges that I faced with this scenario is that Historia\
  \ Prime was a past villain who had so much awful history. Was there anything new\
  \ that I could reveal about his nefarious deeds, and still keep a light-hearted\
  \ tone to this adventure? It was an interesting balancing act.</p> \n      <p>(Historia's\
  \ Holdout is followed by the delightful <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dvn?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-508-Tarnished-Legacy-Star-Sugar-Superstar\"\

  \ scenario was one of the most detailed I've received, with multiple set pieces,\
  \ plot developments, and requests for fully-fleshed NPCs with distinct personalities\
  \ and motivations. I leaned on some ideas from my very first scenario—<a href=\"\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-18: Faithless and Forgotten, Part 3: The Infernal\
  \ Inheritance</em></a>—to realize the scenario's central setting, creating a dynamic\
  \ playground for PCs to explore. I particularly enjoyed writing the more antagonistic\
  \ \"Starfinders,\" figuring out their tics and how PCs could understand and manipulate\
  \ them without open conflict. I'm excited for some more of my work to emerge in\
  \ the upcoming <em>Mechageddon!</em> adventure, as well as to see some of my favorite\
