  \  <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 19, 2010</p> <a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenCon2010-LoraWitchCosplay.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img hspace=\"9\" src=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenCon2010-LoraWitchCosplay_180.jpeg\"\
  \ align=\"right\" border=\"0\"></a> \n    <p>Let me start this off by saying that\
  \ our fans and friends are freakin' amazing. Seriously, folks—when Tiffany started\
  \ this whole costume contest thing two years ago by showing up at the Gen Con booth\
  \ dressed as a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/costume/v5748dyo5lafh\">cleric of Desna</a>,\
  \ we were flat-out flabbergasted. The fact that Pathfinder cosplay has grown by\
  \ leaps and bounds since then—enough to justify a full-fledged <i>costume contest</i>—\
  is one of the greatest compliments our game could receive. If you've never seen\
  \ what goes on in our hotel rooms after a long day of working the Gen Con booth\
  \ (and I sincerely hope you haven't, as we were told those door locks were secure),\
  \ there's a whole lot of summer-camp-style giggling that goes on late into the night\
  \ as we marvel at all the folks we've met that day. The costume contest only compounds\
  \ that.</p> \n    <p>This year we had a number of strong contenders. In fourth place,\
  \ Kelly's amazing <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/costume/v5748dyo5lbbp\">Harsk outfit</a>\
  \ (complete with badger and authentic handmade crossbow!) tied with Blake's fabulous\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/costume/v5748dyo5lbcq\">depiction of Nethys</a>, the\
  \ two-faced god of magic. In third, Tiffany's <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/costume/v5748dyo5lbde\"\
  >Harrower costume</a> was a spot-on recreation of the art from the campaign setting\
  \ hardcover, while Jason's <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/costume/v5748dyo5lbbq\">potion-covered\
  \ homage</a> to the iconic alchemist exploded into second place.</p> \n    <p>Yet\
  \ there can be only one winner of the Third Annual Gen Con Pathfinder Cosplay Contest,\
  \ and this year the landslide victory went to <b>Lora as the iconic witch</b>. The\
  \ level of detail on this costume was simply stunning. As art director Sarah Robinson\
  \ pointed out, given the number of illustrators who complain about having to draw\
  \ all the little pouches, fetishes, and other bits and pieces Wayne Reynolds likes\
  \ to load up the iconics with, seeing someone actually <i>make</i> them to this\
  \ level of detail is amazing. For her dedication, Lora receives the grand prize\
  \ of <b>$50 in Paizo store credit</b>, as well as bragging rights until next year,\
  \ when she'll have to defend her title.</p> \n    <p>When the time comes, will you\
  \ be the one to take it from her?</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p>James Sutter\
