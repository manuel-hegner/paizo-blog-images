  \ <blockquote> \n   <h1>The Nex Step</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, April\
  \ 27th, 2011</p> \n   <p>Way back in the editorial of <i>Dragon</i> #353, in March,\
  \ 2007, I gave the first hint about a major gaming project I'd already been working\
  \ on for months. While recounting a fun convention appearance at North Carolina's\
  \ Mid-Atlantic Convention Expo (M.A.C.E.) I mentioned that I ran two marathon sessions\
  \ of my Age of Worms kick-off adventure, \"The Whispering Cairn,\" as well as another\
  \ super-secret event, \"The Refuge of Nex,\" which I called \"a cunning dungeon\
  \ you might be seeing more of soon.\"</p> \n   <p>Although the public did not yet\
  \ know about the end of the print version of the magazine, I had received the terminal\
  \ diagnosis months earlier. While my hectic days at that time were focused on giving\
  \ the magazines the best possible send-offs I could, my nights were filled with\
  \ scheming about what Paizo would do next. We'd already launched the GameMastery\
  \ Modules, but that line was still in its infancy in 2007. Most of the plans for\
  \ it were scribbled in my notebooks, and had not yet been published.</p> \n   <p>You\
  \ may recall that the early GameMastery adventures featured an alphanumeric code\
  \ to hearken back to the classics of the 80s and to help us keep track of which\
  \ adventures focused on which topics. The \"U\" series, for example, featured urban\
  \ adventures, while modules that started with a \"J\" usually involved a journey\
  \ to some exotic locale. It's one of those ideas that work better in theory than\
  \ in practice, which is why we eventually abandoned it, but in 2007 we were all\
  \ still pretty excited bout it.</p> \n   <p>I was most excited about a specific\
  \ alpha-numeric designation found in the planning pages of my notebook: The \"M\"\
  \ series. </p> \n   <p>In a fit of hubris only a publisher could love, I decided\
  \ that the \"M\" series stood for \"Mona,\" and that it would provide an outlet\
  \ for my personal adventure designs. \"The Refuge of Nex,\" which I playtested at\
  \ M.A.C.E., was to be the first installment in the \"M\" series, the beginning of\
  \ a multi-adventure exploration of an extraplanar dungeon composed of several \"\
  stacked\" demiplanes created by a long-missing archmage. It would be a huge multi-year,\
  \ multi-product mega-dungeon in the tradition of Greyhawk or Undermountain, with\
  \ plenty of intrigue and weird-world exploration mixed in with killer traps and\
  \ insidious combats. </p> \n   <p>It was also WAY too much work for a publisher.\
  \ Back then, I had enough capacity to balance editor-in-chief duties along with\
  \ those of the publisher, but once the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> (and later\
  \ the RPG) started rolling, all dreams that I would have the free time to polish\
  \ off even \"The Refuge of Nex\" evaporated, to say nothing of my unrealistic hope\
  \ of helming an entire ongoing module series while managing the most important business\
  \ transition the company has ever endured. To make matters even more complicated,\
  \ it was at about this time that I took on the challenge of weaving material from\
  \ myself, James Jacobs, Jason Bulmahn, and other members of the Paizo staff into\
  \ the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/v5748btpy82t7\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ Gazetteer</i></a>, the first real look at the wider world of Golarion.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"The Refuge of Nex,\" at this point, entered a long period of stillbirth\
  \ from which it has not yet emerged. But I never forgot about it. Indeed, in the\
  \ time between M.A.C.E. and the <i>Gazetteer</i>, I'd built up a whole story around\
  \ the elusive archmage Nex, giving him his own nation to rule on the southern continent\
  \ of the Inner Sea region and tying his background into other exotic places such\
  \ as Jalmeray and Absalom. </p> \n   <p>At this point I decided that Nex had been\
  \ among the would-be tyrants who tried unsuccessfully to conquer Absalom, leaving\
  \ behind an infamous Siege Castle known as the Spire of Nex. The Spire of Nex was,\
  \ essentially, the old Refuge idea transplanted to a more robust location closer\
  \ to the City at the Center of the World. I still wanted to keep the old Refuge\
  \ under the palace in Nex's capital city, though, so I decided that both the Spire\
  \ and the Refuge were different entrances to the same otherworldly place. The fact\
  \ that I had Nex himself withdraw there after a treacherous attack from his archenemy,\
  \ Geb, made the whole thing even more interesting to me. </p> \n   <p>So I started\
  \ work on the Spire of Nex, writing about 10 hours of adventure material to use\
  \ at my various convention appearances. That version of the dungeon has appeared\
  \ at PaizoCon (twice), Neoncon in Las Vegas, Dragonmeet, and probably a few others\
  \ I'm forgetting. Dozens of players have ventured into the Spire, and given that\
  \ it's more difficult to get out than it is to get in (just ask Nex himself), most\
  \ of them are still marooned there.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <table align=\"right\"\

  \ to enjoy the opening levels of the Spire of Nex, and I quite enjoyed thinking\
  \ about the place and detailing its many marvels. Over time I'd written so much\
  \ material about it that I began to imagine my own adventures in the place. I realized\
  \ I'd created a great setting for original fiction.</p> \n   <p>Fiction writing\
  \ and editing defined my college experience, but since joining the workforce I'd\
  \ hardly had time to write a poem, let alone a genuine piece of narrative fiction.\
  \ I'd written dozens of game books, adventures, and editorials, of course, but I\
  \ knew my fiction talents had atrophied, and the Spire of Nex seemed like a fun\
  \ way to get back into it. Eventually, I hoped Paizo might even publish a line of\
  \ novels to go with the increasingly popular Pathfinder gaming products, so I thought\
  \ there might be a chance that, one day, I could even get it publishedâ€”if I could\
  \ convince the editor it was any good, of course.</p> \n   <p>So I wrote a 20,000-word\
  \ outline for my Spire of Nex novel, and even wrote the first few chapters in draft\
  \ form. Sure, I didn't really have the third act figured out, and once the heroes\
  \ got into the weird worlds within the Spire the story sort of ballooned out of\
  \ control, but that was ok, because I was having fun.</p> \n   <p>Then we launched\
  \ our Pathfinder Tales novel line, and I read finished manuscripts from professional\
  \ authors like Dave Gross and Elaine Cunningham. And I realized that my Spire of\
  \ Nex outline was way too complex. Like, stupidly complex. I came to appreciate\
  \ that I'd spent all my time working on a story that might work as the end of a\
  \ much longer saga, but that all of the characters in the story had <i>earlier</i>\
  \ stories that were much more accessible, and much less burdened by being tied down\
  \ to a bunch of background I'd created for RPG sessions.</p> \n   <p>Fiction and\
  \ RPGs are different things, of course, and I needed to write a story that worked\
  \ on its own without all of the complicated background I'd invented to challenge\
  \ my players. So I set the Spire of Nex aside and began working on that simpler\
  \ story, which I called \"Two Pieces of Tarnished Silver.\" The story introduces\
  \ my old Spire of Nex protagonists, the cunning swordsman Korm Calladan and his\
  \ cyclops companion, Aebos. It also ties in other bits of continuity minutia I slipped\
  \ into my Pathfinder work as early as <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #1. And,\
  \ of course, Nex himself is also involved, just to bring everything full circle.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>This week, we're posting the second of five chapters of \"Two Pieces\
  \ of Tarnished Silver,\" and the first to involve hints of the grand Nex plan I\
  \ hope to explore through future Pathfinder fiction and gaming writing. </p> \n\
  \   <p>Eventually, I hope that grand plan will involve a full novel called <i>The\
  \ Spire of Nex</i> and perhaps even that original \"Refuge of Nex\" adventure I\
  \ created way back in 2007.</p> \n   <p>I hope you enjoy reading the exploits of\
  \ Korm and Aebos as much as I've enjoyed writing them.</p> \n   <p>For there are\
  \ many more to come!</p> \n   <p style=\"clear:both;\">Erik Mona <br>Publisher</p>\
