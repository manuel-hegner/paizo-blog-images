  \ of a year, we've had to keep much about the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game under\
  \ wraps. After a while, all I wanted was to show the game to someone—anyone—outside\
  \ the walls.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In the last couple weeks,\
  \ I got my wish. First at the GTS Distribution Come and Play Day, then at PaizoCon,\
  \ we took the shrinkwrap off our new creation. The first reaction from everyone\
  \ was, \"Wow, that's a big box.\" As I showed the game with all of its expansions\
  \ nestled in the tray, everyone started to appreciate the intricacy of the planning\
  \ on this game. Over 1,150 cards and all of their containers fit nicely in the box.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Which is all very well and good. But the real test would be people's\
  \ reactions to how it played. At PaizoCon, my developers Chad, Gaby, Tanis, and\
  \ Paul ran the game alongside a group of Pathfinder Society volunteers, and the\
  \ tables were always hopping. Folks came away from our demos with a desire to play\
  \ the real game, one we happily indulged. Reports from the field were highly positive.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But if you weren't at those demos, you're probably wondering how you\
  \ can find out how the game works. Well, here, at long last, is <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >the rulebook</a>. Now you can flip through it and see what awaits you next month\
  \ when the game debuts for sale at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>There's a lot in this rulebook.\
  \ We weren't content to just give a sequence and examples of how to play. We loaded\
  \ it up with strategy sidebars, prebuilt characters, and tips on making your own\
  \ cards. (More on that last bit in a month or two.) There's also a fairly long list\
  \ of playtesters, without whom this game would not have half the awesome that it\
  \ does.</p> \n    <p>But maybe you don't want to read about it. Maybe you want someone\
  \ to demo the game for you, just as if you were at PaizoCon. OK, we can handle that.\
  \ From the GTS event, here are Chad and myself joining Watch It Played's Rodney\
  \ Smith for a full demo of the game.</p> \n    <center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"\

  \ \n    </center> \n    <p>It's a pretty stellar video, if I do say so myself. And\
  \ I hope to run into you at Gen Con and PAX Prime next month, where my team and\
  \ I can show you the game ourselves. Because, y'know, we finally get to do so.</p>\
