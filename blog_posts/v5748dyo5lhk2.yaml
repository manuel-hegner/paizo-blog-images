  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Beastly Dealings</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The goblin's\
  \ head morphed into a humanoid skull with a piggish nose and enormous, bat-like\
  \ ears. Milky eyes fixed on Akina as fangs filled a slavering maw. The beast's body\
  \ expanded and hunched over, bristling with fur until it resembled an enormous wolf\
  \ with clawed hands instead of forepaws. </p> \n    <p>Akina recognized the creature\
  \ for what it truly was. There'd been enough of them fighting alongside the goblinoid\
  \ hordes, devouring corpses, acting as scouts or battlebeasts.</p> \n    <p>\"Barghest!\"\
  \ she called to the monk, for whatever good it did with him being trapped.</p> \n\
  \    <p>If he replied, she didn't catch it, for the barghest's yowl resounded through\
  \ the chamber. It lunged. Akina stepped in to meet it head-on, but the beast vanished\
  \ in midair.</p> \n    <p>\"Behind you!\"</p> \n    <p>At the monk's shout, Akina\
  \ spun just in time for a claw to smash across her helmet. Vision blurred, and she\
  \ went to one knee. The barghest gnashed at her, but she lowered her head and surged\
  \ up, her iron ram horns slamming into its face. She rose, following through with\
  \ a hammer blow that caught it under the chin and flipped it backward. She planted\
  \ a hand and shook off the rattling impact. </p> \n    <p>\"I have it!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She raised her head. Ondorum had reached through the cage bars and caught\
  \ the barghest around the chest. It scrabbled at him, but the same bars kept it\
  \ from doing anything more than snagging his robe. Its attempts to tear his grip\
  \ away with its claws proved equally futile. Ribs crunched and the beast's cries\
  \ pitched higher.</p> \n    <p>It vanished again. Ondorum's bear hug collapsed around\
  \ empty air. Akina turned a circle, expecting another ambush from behind. But the\
  \ barghest failed to reappear, and the immediate stink of it faded. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Stones and bones, where'd it go?\" She turned her maulaxe to poise the sharp edge.\
  \ \"Cowardly beast.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A sorcerous creature?\" Ondorum turned in the\
  \ cage to eye the chamber.</p> \n    <p>\"These things are nasty tricksters,\" she\
  \ said. \"Some think they're a kind of goblin demon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'd not doubt\
  \ it.\" He knelt and pressed palms to the cracked floor. </p> \n    <p>\"What're\
  \ you doing?\"</p> \n    <p>He closed his eyes, face set in concentration. \"Listening\
  \ for the creature.\" One eye cracked open to peer up at her. \"Haven't you ever\
  \ tracked enemies through the vibrations of their steps on stone?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Of course I have! I'm a gods-damned dwarf, aren't I?\" Embarrassed that she hadn't\
  \ thought of it first, Akina stripped off a gauntlet and knelt to put her hand to\
  \ the floor, keeping her maulaxe ready.</p> \n    <p>\"You needn't bother.\" Ondorum\
  \ stood. \"I sense nothing. However, I believe I have a solution to my imprisonment.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Oh?\" Akina pointedly kept her hand on the stone, though in truth\
  \ she didn't feel anything either.</p> \n    <p>\"I shall attempt to rejoin you\
  \ as quickly as I can. If you encounter any of the hobgoblins before then, please\
  \ try to remember our bargain.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Rejoin me?\"</p> \n    <p>Ondorum\
  \ raised a hand, palm open, then pounded it down onto the floor, dropping smoothly\
  \ to put all his weight behind it. The cracks in the stones spread. Then he did\
  \ it again. And again. </p> \n    <p>All at once, the floor beneath him crumbled.\
  \ He caught her eye just as the floor fell away, dropping him into darkness.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Akina gaped for half a second before a scraping echoed up from one of\
  \ the passages leading deeper into the ruins. A choked snarl made her grin.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Weapon ready, she stalked down the passage, brushing aside draping moss\
  \ and thick spider webs. The barghest's smell strengthened as she went, reinforced\
  \ by the click of claws on stone and occasional angry rumblings. </p> \n    <p>She\
  \ paced through multiple rooms coated thick with dust, with dark niches and ceilings\
  \ stretching out of sight. Who had the temple's original builders worshiped? Impossible\
  \ to tell with so many of the original decorations and icons worn away or defaced.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As she crept into a wider room, a fresh wave of stink made her nose hairs\
  \ bristle. Close. Very close. In fact, with its disappearing trick, the beast could\
  \ be right on top ofâ€”</p> \n    <p>A weight slammed into her back. Akina hit the\
  \ ground as the barghest screeched in her ear. Foul breath gusted over her and claws\
  \ raked armor. Gripping her maulaxe tightly, she rolled as hard as she could, flinging\
  \ the creature away. </p> \n    <p>The barghest gave a vile smile as it recovered\
  \ and leapt at her. She cocked the maulaxe, but it reached out with foreclaws and\
  \ grabbed the handle to stall the blow. It tried to wrench the weapon away even\
  \ as it snapped fangs at her face. Akina wrestled the beast back a few steps, its\
  \ fiendish strength nearly a match for hers.</p> \n    <p>Nearly.</p> \n    <div\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Barghests may be worshipped by goblins, but they're far from\
  \ benevolent masters.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Keeping one hand on the haft, she\
  \ punched out with the other. Her fist connected with the barghest's barrel chest,\
  \ right where Ondorum had crushed it earlier. Yet where the oread's fists had bruised\
  \ and battered, the iron edge of her gauntlet just thumped against the creature's\
  \ flesh and stopped, as ineffective as if she'd punched packed earth.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The barghest snarled and tried to yank the maulaxe away again. </p> \n    <p>Akina\
  \ bared teeth in return. \"Mine.\"</p> \n    <p>She let herself be pulled closer,\
  \ then grabbed the shaft with both hands, jumped, and planted her feet on the barghest's\
  \ chest. She kicked off, shoving the barghest away while keeping the maulaxe tight\
  \ against her chest. Her back struck the stones, and she rolled upright just as\
  \ the beast lunged in. She dodged and whipped the maulaxe out so the hammer side\
  \ slammed into the barghest's ribs with a satisfying crackle. </p> \n    <p>Howling,\
  \ the barghest fell. Akina leapt over its kicking paws and brought the axe edge\
  \ down. The beast's writhing threw off her aim, and its unnaturally tough hide turned\
  \ the blow so that instead of severing an arm, the blade simply gouged a shoulder.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Black blood spurted from the wound. The barghest arched hard enough\
  \ to throw her off and scrambled free. One moment it stood just within reach. The\
  \ next, it disappeared and popped back into being across the room, glaring at her\
  \ from near a dark doorway.</p> \n    <p>\"You are an annoying snack.\" Baring its\
  \ teeth, the barghest floated off the floor a few inches, favoring its wounded side.\
  \ Akina considered this new trick. Must've been how the creature ambushed her from\
  \ above. </p> \n    <p>It started to move toward the passage. She hurried after,\
  \ but knew she wouldn't reach it before it did its vanishing trick again. </p> \n\
  \    <p>The instant it crossed the threshold, however, a pair of clasped fists smashed\
  \ down atop its skull.</p> \n    <p>Ondorum stepped into view, dustier than before\
  \ but little worse for wear. The barghest yowled and scrabbled up at him. The monk\
  \ evaded the snapping maw with a shift of his weight. A kick swept the beast's leg\
  \ out from under it, and as it stumbled, Ondorum came down with an elbow that struck\
  \ its spine with cracking force. </p> \n    <p>The barghest collapsed. Akina halted\
  \ her charge to watch as Ondorum laid into the creature. He responded to its wild\
  \ gnashing and slashes with precise palm strikes and kicks, until the beast's attacks\
  \ began to slow.</p> \n    <p>At last, the barghest's twitching paws stilled. Ondorum\
  \ watched it, fists cocked at odd angles, waiting to ensure it remained down. Then\
  \ he glanced Akina's way and straightened, tucking arms into opposing sleeves.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Akina scowled. \"Damn you to Hell. That was mine.\"</p> \n    <p>He eyed\
  \ the mangled corpse. \"If it's any consolation, I left the ears on so you could\
  \ yank them off.\"</p> \n    <p>She stared at him until he smiled.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That was a joke.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And a piss-poor one! Don't you know better than\
  \ to snitch another's kill?\"</p> \n    <p>He appeared puzzled. \"The beast won't\
  \ hurt anyone again. Does it truly matter which one of us ended its life?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"When you're a mercenary, it does. With Durgan, the more you kill, the\
  \ bigger your share. Doesn't matter if you wound a creature. If you don't drop it,\
  \ it isn't yours to claim.\"</p> \n    <p>\"An interesting approach. I can see how\
  \ it might motivate greater effort in battle.\"</p> \n    <p>Akina plodded over\
  \ to study the barghest closer, but couldn't see anything worth carving off as a\
  \ trophy. \"Figure this at least makes you think twice about showing the hobgoblins\
  \ any mercy.\"</p> \n    <p>Ondorum tilted his head. \"Should it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  They obviously sent this beast ahead to take us out. Bet they didn't even let you\
  \ know it was skulking around, hm?\"</p> \n    <p>He frowned. \"They failed to mention\
  \ its presence, true.\"</p> \n    <p>His expression troubled, he headed deeper into\
  \ the ruins without further argument. Akina followed, hoping she might finally be\
  \ getting through to him. They worked through decrepit chambers, edged past pits,\
  \ and left nothing in their wake but darkness. </p> \n    <p>Finally, as they moved\
  \ down a long hall, Ondorum paused and pointed ahead. Beyond a spacious archway,\
  \ shadows flickered from unseen flames and guttural voices reverberated in the distance.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Right,\" she said. \"We go in quiet, see what their layout is\
  \ andâ€”\" </p> \n    <p>Ondorum tucked his shoulders back. \"Hail, Skurl! We come\
  \ to meet your leader. Will you honor our agreement?\"</p> \n    <p>Akina closed\
  \ her eyes briefly, biting her tongue to keep from unleashing a few choice curses.\
  \ Hobgoblin voices rose in an argumentative flurry before another slashed through\
  \ the air and quieted the rest. After a long minute, several hobgoblins strode into\
  \ view. They wore ragged furs, leather scraps, and bits of battered armor. Each\
  \ held axes or swords, and one with longer-than-average tusks had filed them to\
  \ deadly points. </p> \n    <p>They stopped just out of reach. The foremost, a male\
  \ with scarred splotches across his skin, squinted at Ondorum before his scrutiny\
  \ shifted to Akina.</p> \n    <p>\"So you're one of the mercs they sent to kill\
  \ us?\" he rasped. \"I've fought tree stumps that were more dangerous.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Akina tensed, but Ondorum stepped between them. </p> \n    <p>\"Hold.\"\
  \ He nodded to the speaker. \"Skurl.\"</p> \n    <p>The hobgoblin's lips peeled\
  \ back. \"Monk. Why bring another with you? This wasn't what we agreed.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"She indeed represents the mercenaries hired to eliminate your band. However,\"\
  \ he raised his voice over the hobgoblins' growls, \"she has agreed to meet with\
  \ your leader to see if a peaceable resolution can be reached, as we discussed.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>It took most of Akina's self-control to not attack then and there.\
  \ She reminded herself that if she killed these right off, it'd give their leader\
  \ a chance to flee. </p> \n    <p>At last, Skurl gestured with a blade. \"Come.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The hobgoblins retreated into their lair. Akina turned to Ondorum,\
  \ unable to believe that the creatures expected them to just blindly follow. Yet\
  \ the monk strode forward through the arch, head erect, shoulders square.</p> \n\
  \    <p>She stared at his back, tempted to let him reap the consequences of his\
  \ naivetÃ©. Yet a part of her grudgingly admired his fearlessness and confidence.\
  \ After a moment, she sighed. Let no one claim she ever left another to face enemies\
  \ alone.</p> \n    <p>\"Crack and shatter me for a fool,\" she muttered, hustling\
  \ after.</p> \n    <p>In the room beyond, the hobgoblin camp looked like an underground\
  \ chapel with arched ceilings, rows of broken stone benches, and a dais at the end\
  \ of the main row. The place was littered with refuse piles, guttering fire pits,\
  \ and bundles of gear tucked into the cornersâ€”stolen, Akina assumed. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>Five more hobgoblins waited beyond the first three. As Akina and Ondorum entered,\
  \ she checked to ensure the beasts remained off to the sides, not blocking the exit.\
  \ All had the glowering look of warriors sullen from a lack of violence, and their\
  \ armor appeared cobbled together from random salvage. One particular hobgoblin,\
  \ a female, stood in the center of the room. Taller than most, she held the bearing\
  \ of one used to command.</p> \n    <p> Once the pair stopped, the leader shuffled\
  \ forward, bowlegged and wary. Clad in black armor and swathed in sable bear fur,\
  \ she carried a long dagger in one hand and a barbed whip in the other. Her tusks\
  \ had been capped in silver, and copper rings pierced her ears, nose, eyebrows,\
  \ and forehead.</p> \n    <p>\"I am Nigarl,\" she said, voice somehow grinding and\
  \ gurgling at the same time. \"From the noise you caused above, I'm guessing you\
  \ finally put down the barghest. Thank you.\"</p> \n    <p>Akina's eyebrows rose.\
  \ \"You're thanking me?\"</p> \n    <p>\"That troublesome beast has hounded us for\
  \ months, demanding we provide meals and tormenting us when we refuse. We thought\
  \ we'd shaken it when we came north, but then caught it snuffling around here, thieving,\
  \ pouncing on us from the dark. I lost two good fighters to its claws, and another\
  \ to the traps it sets. I've heard it's also been attacking settlements in the area\
  \ and leaving us to take the blame.\" She eyed Akina meaningfully. \"I hope this\
  \ monk has made it clear we just want to be left alone.\"</p> \n    <p>Akina gnawed\
  \ a lip. \"You really want to do this peacefully?\"</p> \n    <p>Nigarl crouched\
  \ and laid her dagger and whip on the floor between them. Straightening as much\
  \ as her round-shouldered figure allowed, she showed empty palms.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Will you give us that chance? Will you let this be settled without more death?\"\
