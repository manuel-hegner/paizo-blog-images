  description\">Though the night air was still, Korakai’s feathers still rustled as\
  \ if in a light breeze as he leaned on his staff and finally arrived at the mountain’\
  s summit. The climb probably would’ve been easier if he hadn’t eaten so many skewers,\
  \ but what was he to do? He’d reached the mountain trail after a long day’s travel,\
  \ and he very well couldn't ignore the delicious smells and clinking glasses from\
  \ the homey tavern tucked to the side of the road.</p>\n              <p>Korakai\
  \ had to respect the location. He clearly wasn’t the only one who’d found the good\
  \ food and drink more appetizing than an arduous hike, and like his family’s own\
  \ restaurant, this tavern had been abuzz with the easy energy of a community that\
  \ knew each other. One thing had led to another, and Korakai had ended up trading\
  \ recipes with one of the regulars, an elderly spice merchant.</p>\n           \
  \   <p>The night had devolved into an impromptu cook-off, and it would have been\
  \ impolite for Korakai to not sample every combination of skewer and dipping sauce\
  \ that had filled the table—as a professional courtesy to a fellow cook, of course.\
  \ Korakai couldn’t believe the merchant had never heard of yuzu, though. He’d managed\
  \ to whip up a substitute from lemon and orange, and though he knew his father would\
  \ roll his eyes when he found out his only son had butchered a family recipe, Korakai\
  \ thought the mix had actually turned out rather well.</p>\n              <p>Sighing\
  \ contentedly, Korakai pulled a worn map out from his pack, shaking it out as his\
  \ ever-present static clung the parchment to his feathers. He reflexively moved\
  \ his talons, tracing symbols to conjure a light, but stopped as he realized he\
  \ could make out the map just fine in the red glow of… Korakai turned around and\
  \ his heart froze. In the valley below, he could see the tavern to his right, and\
  \ creeping towards it, the glow of burning trees to his left.</p>\n            \
  \  <p>No matter how quickly he ran down the trail, there was no way he’d make it\
  \ around the steep switchbacks before the fires reached the tavern. Which meant…\
  \ Korakai paced back and forth on the mountaintop for a few precious seconds, fidgeting\
  \ and clicking his talons together. He wasn’t going to like this next part</p>\n\
  \              <p>Korakai recalled the words his grandfather had told him when he\
  \ was younger. “A tengu belongs to the sky. A tengu does not fear the earth. A tengu\
  \ belongs to the sky. A tengu does not fear the earth. A tengu belongs to the sky.\
  \ A tengu does not fear—” Korakai clenched his eyes tight and leapt from the edge\
  \ of the cliff, opening them again only when he felt the four winds catch him and\
  \ carry him gently from the mountaintop.</p>\n              <p>Smoke stung Korakai’\
  s eyes as he looked around a forest bathed in orange and red. Something felt wrong\
  \ about this blaze, but he couldn’t quite place it. Soon enough, though, he found\
  \ its source in a clearing before him: a pack of fiendish beasts slavering infernal\
  \ fire that dripped to the group, setting the brush alight: hell hounds, four in\
  \ all. Korakai’s legs locked. Had someone summoned the foul creatures here?</p>\n\
  \              <p>Before the fiends could notice Korakai, he tried to weave magic\
  \ to shield himself, but fear had reduced his voice to a stammer too feeble to sustain\
  \ the incantation, and the spell collapsed. As one of the hounds sniffed the air—\
  how could it smell anything, when it reeked of brimstone?—Korakai wheeled around\
  \ a tree and made himself as small as he could. He held his khakkhara staff close\
  \ to him for comfort, for once happy that the heirloom was broken, as his trembling\
  \ would surely have made the staff’s jingling rings give him away, were they still\
  \ intact.</p>\n              <p>Maybe he could make a break for the tavern and warn\
  \ them to evacuate? No, that wouldn’t do. Right now, the hounds were traveling in\
  \ a pack, but if they split up, they’d set the forest on fire even faster. Even\
  \ if everyone could get to safety—questionable, given the state some had been in\
  \ when Korakai had left the tavern—it would take the owners forever to scrounge\
  \ together the coin to rebuild it, and there’d be no replacing the memories it held.</p>\n\
  \              <p>No, he had to stop this here. Korakai breathed deep, trying to\
  \ steady his trembling hands, and sank deep within himself. In his mind’s eye, he\
  \ saw it standing there, unchanged since the day he’d swallowed the sea: a massive\
  \ floodgate of salt-encrusted stone and metal. Even with the gate closed, Korakai\
  \ could feel the ceaseless surging of water—six swelling waves, then a crashing\
  \ seventh—the storm of creation just beyond. The hounds were powerful, yes, emissaries\
  \ of the gods and rulers of the lower planes. But Korakai too was connected to gods,\
  \ spirits, and myriad other sources of divine power—eight million or more—as numerous\
  \ as grains in the sea. He had nothing to fear. Korakai stepped out from behind\
  \ the tree and opened the floodgates but a crack.</p>\n              <div class=\"\

  \             </div>\n              <p>Power welled forth, coursing through his\
  \ veins and churning in his lungs. The hounds noticed him, snarling. As the first\
  \ of the pack leapt forward, Korakai swung his khakkhara in an arc, feeling the\
  \ deities of wind and sky—good and evil alike—guide him. A gale surged, catching\
  \ the hound in midair and sending it careening into a tree, where it exploded into\
  \ embers.</p>\n              <p>As his beak opened in a grin, Korakai felt the unleashed\
  \ energies swirl, their opposing currents clashing in a turbulent whirlpool. Winds\
  \ howled as a sacred storm spiraled forth, and Korakai winced as electricity danced\
  \ across his feathers. He had known it would happen; this was the price of drawing\
  \ on the tempest, of opening a door that led somewhere unknowable.</p>\n       \
  \       <p>The second of the hounds took advantage of Korakai’s distraction to circle\
  \ behind him. In response, the tengu willed the floodgates to open even further,\
  \ and this time, the spirits of rain and waves passed through. Water collected in\
  \ Korakai’s balled fist, and with no more effort than it took to splash in a tidepool,\
  \ he blasted it at the hound, where the torrent met its pelt with a hiss of steam.\
  \ For a moment, it seemed like the fiend would withstand the deluge, but less than\
  \ a heartbeat later, the lightning that wreathed Korakai’s body found its way through\
  \ the waters, extinguishing the hell hound in a spray of saltwater. The backlash\
  \ was immediate and fierce. Rain fell despite the cloudless sky as the winds around\
  \ Korakai accelerated into a fierce hurricane.</p>\n              <p>Enraged, the\
  \ two remaining hounds inhaled, chests distending as they stoked internal hellfire\
  \ before breathing out twin gouts of flame that met in a burning wave. Korakai laughed,\
  \ feeling for a moment oddly at home—he knew how to meet a wave. Recalling childhood\
  \ lessons learned from his mother in the island surf, he dove forward, tucking his\
  \ head under his arms, and the deluge of his storm protected him from the worst\
  \ of the heat. Emerging in front of the shocked fiends, Korakai gave himself fully\
  \ over to the tempest and brought his hands together in a thunderous clap. A deafening\
  \ peal dispersed smoke and steam alike, shaking leaves from the trees, and when\
  \ the sound cleared, the hell hounds were no more.</p>\n              <p>Audible\
  \ in his mind, even amid the echoes, Korakai heard the floodgates slam shut. Though\
  \ the energies he’d already drawn forth continued to rage around him, he found himself\
  \ cut off from the primordial storm, unable to gather any more from the other side.\
  \ It was a humbling reminder that he was a conduit for its power, not its owner.\
  \ Once again, he was just Korakai, nothing more.</p>\n              <p>As he stood\
  \ at peace within the hurricane, Korakai leaned on his staff again and let out a\
  \ breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. With a bit of meditation, he’d be able\
  \ to quell the storm somewhat, but as he looked at the flames, he realized he might\
  \ have use for it for a little while longer. He’d let the revelers in the tavern\
  \ keep enjoying their night while he searched for who, or what, had summoned the\
  \ fiends here in the first place. Rains and wind quenching the flames with each\
  \ step, Korakai walked into the burning forest, trembling no longer.</p>\n     \
