  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the start\
  \ of our newest blog series! Nearly every Monday, we’ll focus on a different wonderful\
  \ industry creator, as an individual, including Paizo staff, freelancers, contractors,\
  \ podcast players, streamers, YouTubers, licensed partners, and more. The format\
  \ is a list of standardized questions from which interviewees can choose. Let’s\
  \ get started!</p> \n     <p><b>Name:</b> Patrick Renie<br> <b>Pronouns:</b> he/him<br>\
  \ <b>Title (if staff):</b> Senior Developer<br> <b>Department (if staff):</b> Editorial</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>What are your goals or dreams as a creator?</h3> \n   \
  \  <p>I was a very shy, quiet kid. When my nose wasn’t buried in a book or my eyes\
  \ glued to a video game, my head was often simply lost in the clouds. I invented\
  \ all sorts of make-believe games and had multiple imaginary friends. One of my\
  \ favorite books was an illustrated children’s dictionary. My teachers wrote things\
  \ like “daydreamer” and “easily distracted” on my report cards.</p> \n     <p>Though\
  \ I was a gifted writer, I struggled to compose anything longer than one or two\
  \ pages. I didn’t like sports or group activities, but I knew how to give engaging\
  \ presentations and I reveled in making the other kids laugh. I liked to doodle\
  \ symbols and draw treasure maps in the margins of my homework. I loved to read\
  \ books about sword-swinging knights and fireball-flinging wizards. Arithmetic and\
  \ algebra came to me easily, but somewhere around geometry I hit a wall and basically\
  \ gave up on math.</p> \n     <p>When I discovered tabletop RPGs, it was like opening\
  \ a secret door to the clockwork of my mind. These games were full of all the things\
  \ I liked: stories of fantasy adventure, sketches of crazy monsters, weird dice\
  \ to fiddle with. The idea of creating my own adventures—something these books not\
  \ only encouraged but gave me the tools to do—felt insane and electrifying. It was\
  \ like for my whole life my brain had been this strange, almost alien machine that\
  \ came without any instructions, and with roleplaying games I’d finally found the\
  \ missing user manual.</p> \n     <p>Making adventures felt like a natural way to\
  \ express myself. I could write stories with interesting scenery and cool villains\
  \ without having to worry about protagonists’ specific motivations or settling on\
  \ one ending. When I got bored with one idea, I could write about something else\
  \ and come back to the first thing later. Eventually, to my astonishment, this mishmash\
  \ of thoughts coalesced into something amazing—an entire world, a cohesive <em>thing</em>.\
  \ It was like alchemy, or witchcraft. Once I got going, I couldn’t stop. I never\
  \ stopped.</p> \n     <p>Today, I write Pathfinder adventures for young people who\
  \ don’t fit the mold: oddballs who have weird, terrific ideas and great senses of\
  \ humor. I want to inspire kids who love books but maybe struggle to focus—youngsters\
  \ who might not have a lot of friends but love to make people smile, or those who\
  \ burst with creative energy but whose talents don’t necessarily align with one\
  \ particular discipline or trade.</p> \n     <p>If this sounds like you, then I\
  \ at least hope you know you’re not alone. I know how it feels to live in a world\
  \ that wasn’t designed for folks like you and me. It’s okay. We can make up our\
  \ own little world instead. And in our world, everybody’s invited, no matter how\
  \ much they fidget or how good they are at math or whatever it says on their report\
  \ card. Anyone who wants to play is welcome.</p> \n     <p>In our world we can say,\
  \ Come on in, everybody. We’ve got sword-swinging knights and fireball-flinging\
  \ wizards and all sorts of other stuff too, like clockwork brains and goblin alchemists\
  \ and winter witches. We’ve got all kinds of things, so come on in, everyone. Come\
  \ on in and get ready, because we’re going on an adventure.</p> \n     <br> \n \
  \    <h3>What’s the best creative advice you’ve ever gotten?</h3> \n     <p>Write\
  \ fearlessly. Whatever your burning idea, whatever it is you want to put into this\
  \ world, it <em>will</em> resonate with someone else—that’s a statistical fact.\
  \ Have you seen the stuff that’s out there? However silly you fear your idea might\
  \ be, I guarantee there’s something far sillier already out there which is resonating\
  \ with millions of people. There’s a guy on YouTube who makes sausages out of bubble\
  \ gum, water, dirt, etc, then tastes and ranks them. It’s utterly ridiculous. I\
  \ love it!</p> \n     <p>The best thing to do as a creator, whether you’re a writer,\
  \ photographer, or sausage maker, is to work on the things that excite <em>you</em>.\
  \ But what is that, exactly? How do you separate what you’ve been <em>taught</em>\
  \ you should want from what you <em>really</em> want? You have to find that \"flow\
  \ state,\" your personal Nirvana. Here’s how: throw your phone in a lake, bury your\
  \ computer in the desert, and lock yourself in a room with just a pencil and some\
  \ paper. Only when you’ve totally lost your mind in your work can you catch a glimpse\
  \ of the thing at the core of it all—that dynamo hidden under your flesh and bone,\
  \ the self-experiencing universe inside you, transcendence, enlightenment, the Cosmic\
  \ Sausage.</p> \n     <p>What I’m saying is: Get in the zone! Don’t think about\
  \ recognition or what comes next, and definitely don’t listen to self-help gurus\
  \ or motivational podcasts or wild-eyed windbags like me! It’s just you and the\
  \ craft, buddy!</p> \n     <p>If there’s any actual wisdom at all buried in my mound\
  \ of prolix drivel, then here’s the <b>tl;dr</b>: when you have fun writing it,\
  \ readers will have fun reading it.</p> \n     <p>Make what you want. Forget the\
  \ rest. That’s the only advice I can offer.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Please tell\
  \ us about your pet!</h3> \n     <p>My wife and I have two cats. We call them Coco\
  \ and Patches. They’re the best.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
