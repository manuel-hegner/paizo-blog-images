  \ L. Sutter</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: Down at the Clever Endeavor</h2> \n    <p>The\
  \ Clever Endeavor wasn't the best bar on Axis. Nor was it the cleanest, or the cheapest—\
  and definitely not the friendliest. It was a bar you went to when you didn't want\
  \ to be seen.</p> \n    <p>Not that there weren't always customers. The place had\
  \ a pretty decent crowd of regulars, and new folks stumbled in from time to time\
  \ as situations warranted. But everyone there knew the first rule of the Clever\
  \ Endeavor: even if you saw someone you recognized—you didn't see them.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Which is why it was so immediately obvious that Salim was being followed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The bar was roughly half full, which meant that it was as full as it\
  \ ever got. Wrought-iron lanterns filled not with flickering flame but with smooth\
  \ phosphorescence glowed softly between tables, casting enough light to see by but\
  \ not so much as to make anyone feel exposed. The bar's shape was different than\
  \ most, with a wide-open center and tables positioned around the twisting outer\
  \ wall, each set in its own scalloped hollow. It was hardly the best use of space,\
  \ but the sort of folk that frequented the Clever Endeavor appreciated the fact\
  \ that the odd layout gave every table a wall to put one's back to, plus a clear\
  \ view of the entrance and the stairs leading up to the street. Directly across\
  \ from the doorway stood a long wooden bar without any stools, and behind it lurked\
  \ a rack of hundreds of bottles of all shapes and sizes—some clear, some opaque,\
  \ and some jumping and jittering of their own accord.</p> \n    <p>The bar's unusual\
  \ shape, however, was nothing compared to its clientele. As far as Salim could tell—\
  and such things weren't always obvious—he was the only human present. To his right,\
  \ a cluster of hive people—this particular group composed almost entirely of the\
  \ flying variety, which resembled seven-foot-tall, black-shelled wasps—used deft\
  \ proboscises to scrape thick red fluid from long, fluted glasses. Thanks to their\
  \ telepathy, the only sound from their alcove was the steady brush of feathery appendages\
  \ on crystal, yet the way they occasionally whirred their wings or crooked their\
  \ limbs suggested an argument. Or as close to an argument as creatures with a hive\
  \ mind ever got.</p> \n    <p>To Salim's left, several of the plane's native axiomites\
  \ were going over documents with a winged, green-skinned man that Salim had pegged\
  \ as an angel, hammering out some sort of agreement. Each time one of the elflike\
  \ axiomites moved to point out a particular clause, the illusion of its flesh broke\
  \ and scattered, revealing the cloud of glowing symbols that was its true form.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Across the room, another axiomite pulled her companion, one of the fox-headed\
  \ vulpinals, as deep into the shadows of her alcove as she could. Salim couldn't\
  \ say whether the gesture was one of modesty or fear of judgment by her fellows,\
  \ but it had little effect either way. Each time the fox-man touched the flawless\
  \ skin of her thigh, a blaze of runes drifted up from the caress like golden dust,\
  \ broadcasting her excitement to the room. The axiomites were living mathematical\
  \ abstractions, but apparently even abstractions had needs.</p> \n    <p>And those\
  \ were just the groups. Far more common in the Clever Endeavor were the singletons—\
  folks who didn't care to bring companions, and were even less interested in making\
  \ new ones. These solitary drinkers were scattered around the place, each lost in\
  \ his or her own thoughts. A flame-haired ifrit, the half-breed offspring of some\
  \ genie and a mortal, sat nursing a brass goblet at one of the flame-retardant tables.\
  \ Beyond him, a contract devil with a pointed beard and wire-rimmed spectacles which\
  \ were almost certainly just for show sorted through a pile of scrolls. Closest\
  \ to the bar was a blurry, vaguely humanoid distortion in the air which Salim took\
  \ to be one of the shae, the aristocratic residents of the Shadow Plane. The shadow\
  \ people had long ago traded physical forms for regions of coherent probability,\
  \ and had been insufferably smug about it ever since. </p> \n    <p>In other words,\
  \ nothing out of the ordinary.</p> \n    <p>Salim shifted so that his back was to\
  \ his uninvited guest. He leaned over the table, propping his head on his hand and\
  \ looking down as if staring into his drink. In reality, it was the glass that concerned\
  \ him. In its warped reflection, the rest of the room behind him was clearly visible.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The solitary axiomite two tables down was staring at him. Not the careful,\
  \ peripheral-vision study of someone used to the Clever Endeavor's rules. The eyes\
  \ fixed on Salim's back were blatant in their gaze. Though the man's nondescript\
  \ robes, pointed ears, and inhumanly perfect features were no different from any\
  \ of a thousand other axiomites, a large rune that glimmered with its own light\
  \ sat between his eyebrows. </p> \n    <p>A glowing forehead tattoo was an interesting\
  \ choice for someone trying to pass unnoticed. But then, this was Axis. As it was,\
  \ the rune told Salim nothing except that he'd never seen the man before.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Salim set down his glass and looked to the bartender. Lahan was standing\
  \ in his usual place behind the counter, a rag over one narrow shoulder and a vacant\
  \ expression on his face as he stared off into the distance. As Salim's hand twitched\
  \ up in the three-fingered signal, however, the barman's eyes snapped into focus.\
  \ He met Salim's gaze and nodded slightly.</p> \n    <p>Good. Placing one hand on\
  \ the battered surface of the table, Salim shoved himself to his feet. He stood\
  \ there for a moment, wobbling slightly as if from too much drink, then began weaving\
  \ his way toward the back of the establishment. Past the bar, he turned left and\
  \ staggered into the hallway leading to the jakes.</p> \n    <p>As soon as he was\
  \ around the corner and out of sight of the rest of the bar, Salim flattened himself\
  \ against the near wall, willing his black robes to blend into the shadows. His\
  \ right hand crept to the twisted hilt of his sword, then moved away. Lahan wouldn't\
  \ want any blood if he could help it. Salim waited.</p> \n    <p>The axiomite came\
  \ around the corner. Salim sprang. One hand wrapping around the man's neck, the\
  \ other forearm hitting sideways across his chest, Salim slammed into his follower,\
  \ jamming him up against the far wall of the hallway.</p> \n    <p>Instead of flying\
  \ apart into a cloud of symbols, the man hit the bricks with a meaty slap. Not a\
  \ true axiomite, then—a disguise. The fake axiomite's mouth opened, and Salim squeezed\
  \ his windpipe shut before he could make a sound. </p> \n    <p>A hand came up,\
  \ crabbing toward the man's chest, and Salim batted it away easily. Searching within\
  \ his opponent's tunic, he found the hard knot of the pendant the man had been reaching\
  \ for. Salim closed his hand around it and pulled, snapping the thong easily.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The man shifted. Where one moment Salim had been holding an axiomite,\
  \ now he was holding something else entirely. Gone were the axiomite's lithe limbs,\
  \ replaced by green scales and clawed, three-fingered hands. A pair of stumpy wings,\
  \ ludicrously small for such a large creature, fluttered ineffectually from slits\
  \ in the shirt's shoulders. The biggest difference, however, was the head: a cross\
  \ between a dinosaur and the long, toothy grin of a dolphin. The creature's new\
  \ face rose on a serpentine neck that was suddenly several feet longer than it had\
  \ been. The glowing rune that had emblazoned the man's forehead was still there,\
  \ but now it sat between two eyebrow ridges of thick horn.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> \"Whoever made this particular eidolon had a weird sense of\
  \ humor.\"\n    </div> \n    <p>A nice trick, but it made little difference. Salim\
  \ choked up on the ludicrous neck until his fist rested just beneath the overlong\
  \ snout, then pulled the head back down to eye level.</p> \n    <p>\"What are you?\"\
  \ he asked, loosening his hold on the creature's windpipe.</p> \n    <p>The creature\
  \ coughed and sputtered. \"I...I don—\"</p> \n    <p>Salim squeezed a warning. \"\
  You don't know? I find that unlikely.\"</p> \n    <p>The creature shook its head,\
  \ gasping, and tried again. This time it managed to rasp out a single word. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Eidolon.\"</p> \n    <p>An eidolon. Interesting. That explained the\
  \ glowing tattoo—eidolons were created creatures, and the rune would undoubtedly\
  \ be a sign of its master. The thought of a third party made Salim suddenly aware\
  \ that his back was exposed, and he dragged the creature farther down the hall toward\
  \ the privies. He trusted Lahan to give him a signal if someone else came their\
  \ direction, but there was no guarantee that the eidolon's summoner couldn't turn\
  \ invisible.</p> \n    <p>\"Who do you work for?\" Salim demanded. \"And why is\
  \ he looking for me?\"</p> \n    <p>The creature shook its head again. Though Salim\
  \ still had it pressed up against the wall, he could feel its body relax.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"He's not. I came on my own.\"</p> \n    <p>That didn't make sense—eidolons\
  \ didn't do anything without their masters' consent—but Salim left it alone for\
  \ the time being. He was starting to get irritated. Before he could ask another\
  \ question, the eidolon answered it.</p> \n    <p>\"Ceyanan told me you could help\
  \ me.\"</p> \n    <p>Ceyanan. The name was like magic—as soon as Salim heard it,\
  \ everything became clear. He sighed and released the creature, stepping back as\
  \ it stretched out its serpentine neck, curling and corkscrewing it to work out\
  \ kinks.</p> \n    <p>\"So the angel sent you.\"</p> \n    <p>The creature nodded,\
  \ a more expressive move than any human could hope to make. \"He told me how to\
  \ find you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course he did.\" Salim's black-winged chaperone\
  \ was fond of jokes. Never mind that the angel's sense of humor had nearly gotten\
  \ this particular emissary killed. What did a single life matter to a herald of\
  \ the death goddess?</p> \n    <p>Salim turned back toward the bar, motioning for\
  \ the snake-man to follow. \"Come on.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So you'll help me?\" the\
  \ eidolon asked. Its muzzle was still frozen in the idiot smile that seemed more\
  \ appropriate now than when it was a just a breath away from being choked to death.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I didn't say that,\" Salim said. \"First we'll talk. But not here.\"\
  \ He glanced back over his shoulder.</p> \n    <p>\"Now are you coming, or aren't\
  \ you?\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The lamentations of a servant betrayed\
