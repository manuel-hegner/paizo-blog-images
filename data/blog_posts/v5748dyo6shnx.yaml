  font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <p>Anyone that has played Pathfinder loves goblins.\
  \ You may not admit it. But you do. Deep down, you want to be a goblin too. That’\
  s why I am looking forward to the new Pathfinder Fumbus comic book that’s currently\
  \ on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dynamiteent/pathfinder-fumbus\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a>. We need more goblins and this special book\
  \ thrusts Fumbus to the forefront and gives us new playable goblin and alchemist\
  \ material for our Pathfinder campaigns. We be greedy… we want that comic! Sorry…\
  \ I’m sounding a little Smeagol-like there. </p> \n      <p>If my name looks familiar\
  \ it may be that you’ve read some of my comics. I’ve written for all kinds of books\
  \ over the years: <em>Army of Darkness</em>, <em>The Six Million Dollar Man</em>,\
  \ <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, <em>Hatchet</em>, and <em>Freddy vs Jason vs Ash</em>\
  \ (an <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, <em>Friday the 13th</em>\
  \ mash-up). Horror and sci-fi are my jam, but I do love a good fantasy tale. I have\
  \ collected all the Pathfinder and D&amp;D comics that have been published and really\
  \ enjoyed seeing the adventures that normally playout in my head illustrated by\
  \ incredible artists. There’s just something really special about seeing other peoples’\
  \ visions for these iconic characters come to life in comics.</p> \n      <p>I’\
  ve played RPGs for decades, and yet in all that time there have only been two characters\
  \ that really made an impact and have lasted with me all the years. One was a human\
  \ orphan raised by dwarves. The character started out as a PC in what was supposed\
  \ to be just a one-off Pathfinder game; really just a throw-away adventure for us\
  \ to have some fun with. But he stuck. Yes, the character was created with comedic\
  \ intent; I wrote him as a 6’ 6” beast of a human that thought he was a dwarf. He\
  \ talked like a dwarf, dressed like a dwarf, and even served as a cleric of a dwarven\
  \ deity. And there were some fun moments playing off other dwarf PCs and NPCs that\
  \ remained incredulous to his behavior. But he became something far more than just\
  \ an easy comedic setup for the group to play off of. That character had the heart\
  \ of a dwarf and went on to do incredible things. That’s why we game after all,\
  \ isn’t it? To have the chance to rise up from obscurity, become a hero we see inside,\
  \ and embrace the path of glory. Well, that and bust some monster heads. But what\
  \ can I say? I told you he was a dwarf at heart.</p> \n      <p>So, if you want\
  \ to see the rise of Fumbus, head on over to the Kickstarter page and check it out.\
  \ And thanks for letting an old comics-nerd share his love of gaming, comics, and\
  \ horror movies with you. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/944869a4-9646-4bc3-a155-ee9032429ca5/051121_BrecciaKraglund.jpg\"\
