  \ promises to be bigger than ever. Here on the organized play team, we've been pulling\
  \ out all the stops.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">John and Thurston talked\
  \ last week about our big specials and quests for Pathfinder Society and Starfinder\
  \ Society, so if you haven't had a chance to check that out, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk13?Thats-No-Boon\"\
  >take a look</a>! I'm here to talk about this year's other brand-new Pathfinder\
  \ Society RPG offerings to kick of the Year of Faction's Favor, starting with our\
  \ August scenario lineup.</p> \n     <p>First up, by Katherine Cross, we have the\
  \ Tier 1-5 adventure <a href=\"/products/btpy9tla?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-901-The-Cost-of-Enlightenment\"\
  ><em>#9-01: The Cost of Enlightenment</em></a>. Katherine has a knack for painting\
  \ vivid settings and memorable characters to draw your characters right in to an\
  \ idyllic scene in a cosmopolitan city in Qadira. Of course, the Pathfinder Society\
  \ wouldn't just send its agents to relax and enjoy a festival. Members of a formerly\
  \ peaceful cult have become criers of great discovery that has left them preaching\
  \ nihilism and ruin. If the PCs can earn the favor of some influential locals in\
  \ the bustling trade hub, they can journey to the source of the revelation, face\
  \ those who curse the appearance of outsiders in a sacred space, and discover their\
  \ own perspectives on a complicated truth.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ next new scenario, <a href=\"/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons\"\
  ><em>#9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a>, by Alex Greenshields, begins on\
  \ the threshold of an international incident. Masked mercenaries have abducted two\
  \ members of Andoran's top government body, the People's Council, and taken them\
  \ to the revolutionary and bloody nation of Galt. Worse, these assailants are affiliated\
  \ with Galt's force of secret police and executioners. When magical means to locate\
  \ these prisoners fail, it falls to a group of enterprising Pathfinder agents to\
  \ uncover a dark conspiracy, rescue a powerful Pathfinder Society ally, and reveal\
  \ the mastermind's true identity. Can your Tier 3-7 PCs get to the bottom of this\
  \ situation before the trail goes cold? My favorite part of this scenario is probably\
  \ the creative encounter that Alex put together for when the PCs set off to rescue\
  \ the Society ally, but I'll leave the details for you to experience for yourselves.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Last but certainly not least, we have the Tier 5-9 scenario <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9tlc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-903-On-the-Border-of-War\"><em>#9-03:\
  \ On The Border of War</em></a>, by Crystal Malarsky. In Brevoy, the specter of\
  \ civil war always lurks on the horizon, as scheming noble factions jostle for power.\
  \ Two of these factions both have strong claims for the copper mining town of Zmeyka,\
  \ and conflict seems almost inevitable. If war breaks out, an ancient keep on the\
  \ outskirts of town that holds yet-undiscovered secrets of Brevoy's past could be\
  \ lost forever. It falls to the PCs to quickly uncover the keep's secrets. They\
  \ must also decide if they wish to throw the Pathfinder Society's weight behind\
  \ one of the conflict's sides, stay out of the struggle entirely, or undertake the\
  \ daunting task of attempting to negotiate for peace. Crystal did an excellent job\
  \ presenting the participants in the rising conflict and the wealth of historical\
  \ information that lurks in the ancient keep.</p> \n     <p>On top of these three\
  \ scenarios, Paizo has teamed up with Games &amp; Gears and Gen Con to produce a\
  \ new module, <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7e?Pathfinder-Module-Heroes-for-Highdelve\"\
  ><em>Heroes for Highdelve</em></a>, which will be premiering as a special event\
  \ at Gen Con and available for sale at both the Games and Gears booth and the Paizo\
  \ Booth at Gen Con. It will be available for download on paizo.com in the near future.\
  \ This adventure, written by Paizo developer Amanda Hamon Kunz, charges 1st-level\
  \ adventurers with the task of recovering a precious amulet and preventing mayhem\
  \ from descending upon their home.</p> \n     <p>For those of you who have signed\
  \ up to play in this event at Gen Con, we are pleased to announce that you can receive\
  \ credit for one of your Pathfinder Society characters. You can now download the\
  \ sanctioning document from <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7e?Pathfinder-Module-Heroes-for-Highdelve\"\
  >the product page</a> and soon the Additional Resources page.</p> \n     <p>If you're\
  \ be attending Gen Con, I look forward to seeing you there!</p> \n     <p>Linda\
