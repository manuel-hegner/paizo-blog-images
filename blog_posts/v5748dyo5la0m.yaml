  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, April 28, 2008</p> \n   <p>In Golarion, the gods\
  \ are immortal. They can die, but the methods of their deaths must be divine as\
  \ well. A mortal cannot kill a god. However—the same cannot be said of demigods!\
  \ None of the core 20 deities of Golarion are demigods, but we've introduced several\
  \ along the way who could be called such. A demigod can be killed by mortals—they\
  \ possess stat blocks, in other words.</p> \n   <p>Last Monday, I introduced you\
  \ to one of Golarion's most infamous organizations, the assassins known as the Red\
  \ Mantis. Today, let me introduce you to their God, Achaekek, the Mantis God, He\
  \ Who Walks In Blood. The Mantis God serves as an assassin, a tool used by the gods\
  \ to smite those who deserve smiting. Yet the Mantis God is not a true god—he is\
  \ a demigod, and as I mentioned above, that means he also gets a stat block. A stat\
  \ block you'll get to see in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy82t5\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #9</a>. </p> \n   <p> The Mantis God is easily the toughest monster to grace our\
  \ Bestiary yet. I don't want to spoil all of the surprises here, but check out these\
  \ fun Mantis God facts! </p>\n   <ul> \n    <li>It is CR 30.</li> \n    <li>Its\
  \ Tumble check is +50.</li> \n    <li>It can create gates by tearing open reality\
  \ once per minute as a move action.</li> \n    <li>It is so poisonous that even\
  \ things that are immune to poison can be poisoned by him.</li> \n    <li>Assuming\
  \ he gets in a rend attack, the Mantis God's average damage on a full round attack\
  \ is about 181. That's assuming no critical hits. And since he threatens a crit\
  \ on a 15 or above, 180 points of damage is a pretty low estimate.</li> \n   </ul>\n\
  \   <p></p> \n   <p>Needless to say, the Mantis God won't be making a direct appearance\
  \ in Curse of the Crimson Throne. Unless, of course, your PCs are complaining that\
  \ nothing they encounter is challenging enough for them!</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs\
