  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Spring is in full swing in Seattle, causing\
  \ the mercury to rise, dousing Redmond with pollen, and sending many of us into\
  \ allergic conniptions. I hadn't planned it this way, but this is perfect timing\
  \ to talk about what Paizo's backyard and this month's scenarios have in common:\
  \ heat and flowers. That is to say we're traveling to Thuvia! This year the shipment\
  \ of the legendary sun orchid elixir—a tonic capable of restoring one's youth—travels\
  \ to Pashow for the first time in five years, and the city desperately needs the\
  \ proceeds of their sale. Of course, the shipment needs to arrive safely to avert\
  \ financial ruin and civil unrest, and the city needs outside help to ensure nothing\
  \ befalls this lifeline.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0721E-LadyZiralia.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Sebastian Rodriguez</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>I\
  \ really enjoy incorporating all levels of play into these storylines, and this\
  \ month level 1-5 PCs experience a major piece of the action in <a href=\"/products/btpy9k94\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-21: The Sun Orchid Scheme</em></a> by the winner\
  \ of <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar Season 9</a>, Nicholas Wasko. Pashow\
  \ is ready to perform a test run of their operation, and knowing the Society's reputation\
  \ for troubleshooting tough problems, the city-state's emir and the visiting dignitary\
  \ Princess Ziralia (pictured here) has contracted a team of Pathfinders to perform\
  \ a non-lethal raid on one of the convoys. Hopefully the PCs can uncover any weaknesses\
  \ in the convoy's defenses before the real deal. Then again, when has anything gone\
  \ according to plan? Nick has written a thrilling adventure with some great twists,\
  \ and I'm now all the more excited for the module he'll be writing in the future.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally adventuring in Thuvia is exciting. Finally releasing true seeker-level\
  \ content is exciting. Combining the two was almost more than I could handle, so\
  \ I called in Thurston Hillman as reinforcements. He's crafted a rousing and challenging\
  \ adventure befitting Tier 12-15 with <a href=\"/products/btpy9k93\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>.\
  \ The convoys carrying the sun orchid elixir have left the Citadel of the Alchemist,\
  \ and Pashow's enemies are closing in. Fortunately, the PCs are on hand to help\
  \ where the fighting's hottest, but they're due to uncover—and resolve—an even greater\
  \ threat in the process. This adventure has one of my favorite depictions of a new\
  \ villain, but I'm loath to post it here because it would spoil the surprise. I'll\
  \ just let Thurston's writing and Sebastian Rodriguez's art speak for themselves\
  \ when you get a chance to play this first of three adventures.</p> \n    <p>John\
