| summary  = This is an urban scene of a high-tech city built by machines, for machines. There are towering structures and a wide variety of robots, from huge to tiny, flying or walking around. The sky overhead is just space and stars (no atmosphere). The city is very clean and orderly, but in a way that caters specifically to robots.
