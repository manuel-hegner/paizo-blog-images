  description\">I'm writing today's blog from the Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio.\
  \ Origins is one of the longest-running gaming conventions in the country, and this\
  \ year a small contingent from Paizo is at the show running demos of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92zj\"><i>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</i></a> for the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, playing some\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> games, and\
  \ hob-nobbing with other game industry folks. Last night, I had a chance to introduce\
  \ some friends from Wizards of the Coast's D&amp;D team to the glorious wonders\
  \ of White Castle hamburgers, and just a few minutes ago I finished up a fun PFS\
  \ table at which our own Jason Bulmahn played an obnoxious priest of Razmir, the\
  \ fak—er, \"Living\" god. Good times.</span></p> \n     <p>But the second biggest\
  \ tabletop gaming convention in the country is no excuse to skip a Friday Preview\
  \ Blog, so here I am in my hotel room bringing you the latest glimpse at November's\
  \ upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures!</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a> set contains a wealth of cool creatures drawn from Pathfinder\
  \ monster books, adventures, campaign settings, and comic books, presenting a straight-up\
  \ serving of fantasy goodness that should appeal to all Pathfinder players and GMs.\
  \ I think the set contains some of our finest sculpts yet, and I can't wait to get\
  \ them on my own gaming table!</p> \n     <p>Here's a sneak peek at three of the\
  \ set's 45 figures.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_BrodertQuink_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have wily old Brodert Quink, the resident\
  \ sage of the town of Sandpoint—the opening locale in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a> and numerous other Pathfinder adventures,\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\">comics</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy91vs\">audio dramas</a>. Quink comes complete with\
  \ reading glasses and a large book, making him a perfect option for elderly wizards\
  \ or a sage in just about any locale. He's got a great expression and adds nicely\
  \ to the growing range of \"townsfolk\" available in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> line. Brodert Quink is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_Leucrotta_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Now here's a creature I've been dying to get in\
  \ prepainted plastic for years and years. One of my favorite aspects of deciding\
  \ the figures in each set is that I get to supplement my own collection with creatures\
  \ I've long wanted, and this scruffy critter is a perfect example of my own wish\
  \ fulfillment working for you. I give you the Leucrotta. This wolf-hyena-deer hybrid\
  \ dates back to AD 77, when it appeared in Pliny the Elder's <i>Natural History</i>,\
  \ one of the world's earliest RPG bestiaries. Even the \"historical\" Leucrotta\
  \ had cool powers like the ability to mimic human speech, and I've been fascinated\
  \ by these evil creatures since they first appeared in RPGs back in the 70s and\
  \ 80s. There have been a few metal versions available, but so far as I know <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> marks the creature's first appearance in\
  \ prepainted plastic. The Leucrotta is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LordMayor_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_LordMayor_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is a man full of pomp and circumstance,\
  \ or at least pomp and lots of fatty foods. I'm speaking of course of Lord Mayor\
  \ Grobaras, the arrogant ruler of Varisia's city of Magnimar. I have a real soft\
  \ spot for noble figures tricked out in finery AND for grossly fat figures, so this\
  \ guy is like a dream come true for me. He's ideal for any kind of overbearing politician,\
  \ though if you ask me I think he's perfect for an obnoxious singing bard. The figure\
  \ is based on one of my favorite illustrations from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8slp\"\
  >Magnimar, City of Monuments</a> sourcebook, and I hope you love him as much as\
  \ I do. There's certainly a lot of him to go around. Lord Mayor Grobaras is a Medium,\
  \ rare figure.</p> \n     <p>And that's it for this week's preview. I'm off to play\
  \ some more <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a> adventures!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Until next week,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br \\> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
