  \ <blockquote> \n      <h2>Archmage, 3rd Tier:</h2> \n      <p><b>Many Forms (Su)</b>:\
  \ You can alter your appearance at will as if using <i>alter self</i>. You can expend\
  \ one use of mythic power to change shape as if using <i>polymorph</i>, with a duration\
  \ of 1 minute per tier. Your caster level for this ability is a number equal to\
  \ 10 + your tier. At 6th tier, the duration of the polymorph ability increases to\
  \ 10 minutes per tier.</p> \n      <h2>Champion, 3rd Tier:</h2> \n      <p><b>Titan's\
  \ Rage (Su)</b>: You can cause yourself to grow in size, becoming a terrifying sight\
  \ to behold. As a standard action (or a free action if you have the rage class feature),\
  \ you can expend one use of mythic power to increase your size to one size category\
  \ larger. This grants you a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, imposes\
  \ a –2 penalty to Dexterity, grants you a +2 natural armor bonus, increases your\
  \ natural reach by 5 feet, and increases your weapon damage based on the new size\
  \ of your weapons. This size increase lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier,\
  \ and doesn't stack with any other spell or ability that alters your size.</p> \n\
  \      <h2>Guardian, 6th Tier:</h2> \n      <p><b>Invincible Stand (Su)</b>: You\
  \ can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to make yourself nearly invincible\
  \ for a short period of time. You gain DR 20/— for a number of rounds equal to your\
  \ tier. If you choose to move or are moved by another creature during this time,\
  \ this protection immediately ends.</p> \n      <h2>Hierophant, 3rd Tier:</h2> \n\
  \      <p><b>Abundant Healing (Su)</b>: When you use a spell or class ability to\
  \ heal a creature's hit point damage, you can apply excess healing (over the target's\
  \ full hit points) to one ally adjacent to you. You can continue to apply excess\
  \ healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run\
  \ out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with\
  \ your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage,\
  \ you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that\
  \ second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5\
  \ points of healing to another adjacent ally.</p> \n      <h2>Marshal, 6th Tier:</h2>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Words of Valor (Su)</b>: With a mere speech, you empower your allies\
  \ to take on any foe. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power\
  \ to inspire all of your allies within a 30-foot radius, granting them the effects\
  \ of the spell <i>heroism</i> and making them immune to fear for 1 round per tier.\
  \ Each mythic creature that is affected by this ability can use its surge ability\
  \ once during this duration without having to expend one use of mythic power.</p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Trickster, 6th Tier:</h2> \n      <p><b>Class Mimic (Su)</b>: The\
  \ abilities of your allies are available to you with a touch. As a standard action,\
  \ you can expend one use of mythic power and touch a willing creature to copy one\
  \ of that creature's class features. You gain the use of this class feature for\
  \ 10 minutes per tier, using the level of the creature touched as your level for\
  \ any effects based on level. You can't copy an ability that has a limited number\
  \ of uses per day (such as rage, smite evil, or spellcasting) or an ability that\
  \ involves a companion (such as eidolon, hunter's bond, or nature bond). You can\
  \ have only one use of this ability in effect at one time. If you use this ability\
  \ again, any previous use immediately ends. You can't copy the same ability more\
  \ than once per day.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Sean K Reynolds<br> <i>Designer,\
