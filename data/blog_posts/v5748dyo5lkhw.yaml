  \ \n     <p><i>This is the fourteenth installment of our strategy blog written by\
  \ game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\"\
  >here</a>.</i></p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Building a party is only half\
  \ the story; you also want to improve those characters over time. This article talks\
  \ about how to do so in a general way, then next month's article focuses on thinking\
  \ about precise cards (and traits). Most of this general advice is strategic, affecting\
  \ overall play.</p> \n     <h2>Start with the pregen decks</h2>\L \n     <p>It might\
  \ seem like strange advice, but it's often best to begin inefficiently. If you start\
  \ with the pregenerated deck for your character, listed in the rulebook, then you\
  \ have great ground to build from: you can spend the \"Basic\" adventures, which\
  \ don't give out many feats, adapting your deck to your own liking.</p> \n     <p>(This\
  \ also has the benefit of making it really easy to start your first game.)</p> \n\
  \     <p><i>Corollary #1: If cards aren't fun, dump them.</i> But don't go too far.\
  \ If it looks like a card is never going to get used and doesn't add to your fun,\
  \ dump it. The goal of this starting advice is to make the early parts of your PACG\
  \ campaign more fun, so make sure that's what happens.</p> \n     <h2>Assess what\
  \ characters need before each game</h2>\L \n     <p>At the start of each scenario,\
  \ review your characters' weaknesses and what categories of cards might help them.\
  \ These might be group-wide inadequacies, such as insufficient healing or inability\
  \ to deal with traps. More likely, they're weaknesses in your own character, such\
  \ as not having leveled up your combat cards or having items that just aren't that\
  \ useful. Use these needs as a guide for play throughout the session.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><i>Corollary #1: Make card needs a priority in location choice.</i> Once you've\
  \ determined what sorts of cards your characters could benefit from, consider positioning\
  \ them at locations that are full of those cards—though do so as part of a total\
  \ strategy for choosing locations, as outlined in \"<a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljdt?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy\"\
  >Choosing Location Decks</a>.\"</p> \n     <h2>Tag-team your deckbuilding</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Remember that this is a cooperative game. You should help other characters\
  \ get what they need. When you discover a gap among your skills, or a character\
  \ that needs a specific sort of card, your next step should be to determine who\
  \ can best acquire those cards. Then send them in! You can always trade cards at\
  \ the end of the game.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Toss cards that are useless\
  \ to you into your discard pile.</i> You should never be afraid to toss cards that\
  \ are clogging your hand into your discard pile. This is particularly true when\
  \ you acquire a card for someone else, and it's not that useful to you.</p> \n \
  \    <h2>Make deckbuilding a priority in play</h2> \n     <p>In order to constantly\
  \ improve your characters, you need to make sure that deckbuilding is a priority\
  \ in your play. Send characters to locations where they can get stuff that your\
  \ party needs, then consider spending blessings or playing other good cards to make\
  \ sure they get that good stuff. It shouldn't be your first priority; that should\
  \ be winning. But it should probably be your second priority, and something that\
  \ you're always considering.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Make deckbuilding the\
  \ first priority if you're losing.</i> If you're already losing, why not making\
  \ deckbuilding the first priority? Talk with your group, and if you decide your\
  \ current mission is hopeless, refocus on getting as many boons as you can before\
  \ the timer runs out.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2: Perhaps making deckbuilding\
  \ the first priority if you're running behind.</i> This could be controversial,\
  \ but sometimes you may want to go into a game with a losing attitude. If you feel\
  \ like your characters are behind the curve and haven't picked up enough of the\
  \ more recent cards, then you're likely to be losing some games in your near future\
  \ anyway. So, why not cut to the chase and start going after boons now? If you get\
  \ lucky and close some locations, then you can reassess.</p> \n     <p>You can also\
  \ play a few tactical tricks to improve your overall deckbuilding.</p> \n     <h2>Purposefully\
  \ void a category during play</h2> \n     <p>You can improve your group's decks\
  \ by purposefully creating a void in a category of cards. It works like this: one\
  \ or more characters have bad cards in the category; you don't collect anything\
  \ new for the category during the adventure; and you banish some of the bad cards\
  \ through play. For example, you can void items by using up potions, you can void\
  \ armor by using their banish effects, and you can void spells by casting them without\
  \ the right skill. Some locations also require card banishment. At the end of the\
  \ game, you will then be able to choose specific cards from the box to fill that\
  \ void.</p> \n     <p>This is probably only worthwhile if you realize midgame or\
  \ later that you're not acquiring a card type. But, if that's the case, consider\
  \ taking advantage of it.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Use card feats to create\
  \ voids.</i> It's even easier to create voids during adventures where victory gives\
  \ you a card feat. You can take card feats in categories where you're short on cards\
  \ or have just enough, and that will instantly allow you to draw from the box!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Corollary #2: Push on this tactic starting in adventure #3.</i> This\
  \ advice isn't that strong while you're working on the first two adventures, because\
  \ you can only replace voids with Basic cards. But, starting in adventure #3, you\
  \ can retrieve any card from two boxes earlier. That's the deckbuilding jackpot\
  \ for this tactic.</p> \n     <h2>Be careful what you take</h2> \n     <p>If you're\
  \ purposefully voiding a card category, be careful what you take. You don't want\
  \ to fill that carefully constructed void with some card that you don't care about.\
  \ Remember that when you encounter a boon, <i>you do not have to try and acquire\
  \ it</i>. Just reject it if it would fill a void (unless you really need the hit\
  \ point).</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Also reject Basic and Elite cards late\
  \ in the game.</i> Rejecting cards is also good advice late in an adventure path\
  \ when Basic and Elite cards are removed from the game when you banish them. Reject\
  \ them and they'll be gone instantly; this will also improve your long-term deckbuilding,\
  \ because it will improve your pool of cards.</p> \n     <h2>Don't give characters\
  \ cards that will get stuck</h2> \n     <p>Here's another way to be careful about\
  \ what you take. When you're rebuilding decks, don't give characters cards that\
  \ will get stuck in their hand, clogging it for a whole game. What this means is\
  \ different for different characters. If a character can recharge (like Lem) or\
  \ bury (like Amiri) or discard (like Lirianne), they can get anything out of their\
  \ hand. But, if a character instead has to depend on the actual cards for deck cycling,\
  \ then be sure to give them lots more recharging cards, particularly allies, armors,\
  \ and (if it's possible) items.</p> \n     <p>I've got one more article for this\
  \ series, which is going to talk about specific types of cards to acquire. I hope\
  \ to see you back in a month to bid my strategy discussion bon voyage.</p> \n  \
