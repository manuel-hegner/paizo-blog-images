  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Attendees\
  \ at this year's GAMA Trade Show and PAX East conventions got a sneak peak at some\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game goodness that Paizo's got planned for later this\
  \ year. Though the final details are still being worked out, I want to share the\
  \ basic concepts with our loyal blog readers.</span></p> \n    <h2>Class Decks</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>In August, we're debuting a new type of PACG accessory: <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game Class Decks</i>. The initial offerings will include seven\
  \ 109-card decks that each contain all the cards one character needs to play an\
  \ entire PACG Adventure Path from start to finish. Each deck contains four playable\
  \ characters of the same character class, and each character will have two unique\
  \ roles to choose from. Meet Olenjack, a new character from the <i>Rogue Class Deck</i>:</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1124_Olenjack_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1124_Olenjack_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br>Illustration by Maichol Quinto\n    </div> \n    <p>Olenjack is\
  \ the master of a guild of... merchants. He rarely feels the need to use the pair\
  \ of long-handled daggers in his belt, but when he does, the wounds they leave behind\
  \ are invariably fatal. Olenjack's ties to a variety of less savory communities\
  \ hint at complex schemes and delicate manipulations. (Pathfinder RPG fans may recognize\
  \ Olenjack—and many of his Class Deck compatriots—from the <a href=\"”\" http: paizo.com\
  \ products btpy8v3a?pathfinder-roleplaying-game-npc-codex>NPC Codex</a>.)</p> \n\
  \    <p>The seven Class Decks premiering in August will showcase the bard, the cleric,\
  \ the fighter, the ranger, the rogue, the sorcerer, and the wizard. Each deck will\
  \ feature a mix of familiar and new cards, and can be used in your home games or\
  \ in our new organized play program!</p> \n    <h2>Organizing Your Play</h2> \n\
  \    <p>With an amazing segue like that, who wouldn't want to find out more about\
  \ the organized play program we'll be debuting at <a href=\"http://www.gencon.com\"\
  >Gen Con </a>? <b>Details are still being worked out,</b> but here are the basics.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Season 0, as we're calling it internally, will consist of around 30 weekly\
  \ scenarios that will be made available in PDF form. Scenarios will initially be\
  \ offered exclusively to major conventions and retailers participating in the organized\
  \ play program. Each month, the previous month's scenarios will then be bundled\
  \ together and offered for sale to all paizo.com customers.</p> \n    <p>Season\
  \ 0 will feature themes and stories inspired by the Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set.\
  \ To play, each participant will need to have a Class Deck and a Pathfinder Society\
  \ number, and each table will need a copy of the Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set plus\
  \ all of the Skull &amp; Shackles adventure decks released to that point. Play will\
  \ be similar to the game you've already come to love, but when the time comes to\
  \ improve your character deck, you'll do it with cards from your Class Deck. After\
  \ the game, participants can report the results online to keep track of what you've\
  \ played and how you've done.</p> \n    <p>If you're interested in helping coordinate\
  \ or run the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i> at a store or convention near\
  \ you, please contact your <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >local Pathfinder Society Venture Officer</a>. We'd love to have you aboard. We're\
  \ not quite ready for retailers to sign up for the program yet, but we'll have an\
  \ announcement about that very soon.</p> \n    <p>There will be a variety of other\
  \ fun things to share with you as we firm up details and dream up new concepts,\
  \ but I can't get into specifics now. I can say that players who already participate\
  \ in the <a href=\"http://www.paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society organized\
  \ play program</a> might find the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game OP program worth\
  \ checking out.</p> \n    <p>We'll be back with more information on both the Class\
  \ Decks and the organized play program as a whole as August draws nearer.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Until then, go play some games!</p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure\
