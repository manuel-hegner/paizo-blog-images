  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi, my name is\
  \ Fred Van Lente, writer of comics and prose (my latest novel,&nbsp;<em>Never Sleep</em>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>debuted\
  \ a few weeks ago:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blackstonepublishing.com/never-sleep-ezvm.html#541=2053692\"\
  >check it out if you like historical thrillers about America's first female private\
  \ detectives</a>). The fine folks at Paizo asked me to drop by to tell you a little\
  \ bit about my new Pathfinder comics series,&nbsp;<em>Wake the Dead</em>,&nbsp;premiering\
  \ from Dynamite in May. This is volume&nbsp;<em>eight</em>&nbsp;of the long-running\
  \ Pathfinder series, and we're doing something a little different this time out.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While I've enjoyed chronicling the adventures of everyone's favorite\
  \ Iconic PCs, i.e. Seoni and friends, both in the Fumbus comics one-shot and in\
  \ the <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> flash fiction on this very blog, <em>Wake the Dead</em>\
  \ takes up with a new party of Iconics of different classes. All these characters\
  \ have appeared in the comics before in supporting roles, but this is the first\
  \ time they’ve met each other, and certainly the first time they've gone adventuring\
  \ together as a group. </p> \n     <p><b>Harsk</b> is the one returning “main” character\
  \ in the group. The dwarf ranger was delayed in rejoining his usual adventuring\
  \ party, Seoni’s team, in Absalom in the <b>Fumbus</b> book. Those of you who read\
  \ the <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> fiction know the Pathfinder Society sent them off\
  \ on an adventure to the Arcadian coast; while he awaits their return, Harsk has\
  \ agreed to do a separate mission for the Society to the arcane state of Nex, where\
  \ he's to meet with a defector from the undead nation of Geb with valuable intel.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>But Harsk isn't the only person braving the Awful district of Ecanus\
  \ and the Mana Wastes to meet with the defector. The Firebrands have sent two of\
  \ their newer members. Lem is the bard in the group, an eternal optimist, and a\
  \ bit of a diva, and probably my favorite to write of the bunch.</p> \n     <p><b>Sajan</b>\
  \ is his mismatched partner, a stoic and humorless monk still on a quest to find\
  \ his missing sister. The Firebrands have agreed to help him pick up that cold trail\
  \ if he brings back the information this defector allegedly has. </p> \n     <p>However,\
  \ in addition to the Pathfinders and Firebrands wanting to get their hands on the\
  \ turncoat, she has information that could prove vital to the Knights of Lastwall\
  \ too. They’ve sent the paladin <b>Seelah</b> into Ecanus to investigate. As a child,\
  \ her family fled Geb and its horrors, so she has no love for that nation or the\
  \ undead in general. Will her personal stake in this mission be a help, a hindrance,\
  \ or a bit of both? </p> \n     <p>For <b>Quinn</b> the investigator, grabbing the\
  \ defector is just another job in one sense, but in another, it's a tantalizing\
  \ mystery: he does not know the identity of the client who hired him and is paying\
  \ his daily fee (plus expenses). He'll only find out when he delivers the turncoat\
  \ to Alkenstar. </p> \n     <p>Then, when the Gebbite necromancer <b>Nyctessa</b>\
  \ shows up with her own inscrutable agenda and her rather, well, morbid sense of\
  \ humor, Quinn's curiosity deepens further: okay, maybe it's not just a job to him\
  \ after all. </p> \n     <p>So all of these Iconics with competing missions converge\
  \ on the same spot in Ecanus's viscera-splattered Awful district to rendezvous with\
  \ this defector—but only one can take the contact away with them. What happens next?\
  \ Will they be at each other's throats, or will they work together to survive the\
  \ night? </p> \n     <p>Needless to say, I can't wait for you to read the first\
  \ issue of <em>Pathfinder: Wake the Dead</em> and find out. </p> \n     <div class=\"\
