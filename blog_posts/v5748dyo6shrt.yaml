  \ we recently announced, we will be producing fewer Pathfinder and Starfinder Society\
  \ Scenarios in 2022, and we’ll be using sanctioned content such as the Digital One\
  \ Shots to help fill some of the gaps in the schedule. To help ease this change\
  \ and fix some long-outstanding issues, we’ve also updated the rewards for some\
  \ of our older sanctioned content to match our plans moving forward. The changes\
  \ are detailed below; in particular, we hope you all enjoy the boost in spending\
  \ money and Reputation!</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <h3>Pathfinder Society\
  \ (second edition)</h3> \n      <p>The following Adventures now award 24 days of\

  \ Curse Adventure Path</em></a></li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>The following Adventures\
  \ now award 8 days of Downtime:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>Each level of the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023dx?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box\"><em>Pathfinder\

  \ \n      <p>Players who have already played these adventures may treat the Downtime\

  >Earn Income activity</a> appropriate to the level at which they applied the Chronicle\
  \ Sheet (so a 3rd-level character would earn 5 sp per day of Downtime). Mark the\
  \ gold earned on your most recent Chronicle Sheet with a note about its source.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The following Adventures now award 4 Reputation with your chosen Faction:</p>\

  \ Trouble in Big Absalom</em> (initially awarded 1)</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Make\
  \ a note on your most recent Chronicle Sheet to reflect the increased Reputation.\
  \ We’ve already updated these Reputation values in the reporting system and applied\
  \ them to your character’s default faction. If you see any errors, please email\
  \ <a href=\"mailto:orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com\">orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com</a>\
  \ to have them corrected.</p> \n      <p><b>A note on Little Trouble in Big Absalom:</b>\
  \ This adventure, despite taking 3-4 hours to run, currently awards credit as though\
  \ it were about half that length. <b>This was an error on our part, and we apologize\
  \ for it.</b> We can’t retroactively fix the XP now, because that would have cascading\
  \ effects upon your characters, but we want you to know that we regret the error\
  \ and our failure to fix it quickly, and that it’s not our intent going forward.\
  \ If an adventure takes 4 hours to play, it will award credit as if it were a scenario.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n      <p>The following Adventures\
  \ now grant Day Job rolls:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot\"\

  ><em>Dead Suns</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> \n       <li>Each volume\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/againsttheaeonthrone\"><em>Against the Aeon\
  \ Throne</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> \n       <li>Each volume of\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/signalofscreams\"><em>Signal of Screams</em> Adventure\
  \ Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> \n       <li>Each volume of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/dawnofflame\"\
  ><em>Dawn of Flame</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> \n       <li>Each\
  \ volume of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm\"\
  ><em>Attack of the Swarm!</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> \n       <li>Each\
  \ volume of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy\"\
  ><em>The Threefold Conspiracy</em> Adventure Path</a> grants 3 rolls</li> \n   \
  \   </ul> \n      <p>Players who have already played these adventures may treat\
  \ the Day Job rolls as if they earned credits equal to 10x the level at which the\
  \ chronicle was applied (so a 4th-level character would earn 40 credits per Day\
  \ Job roll). This applies only if the character had at least one rank in the Profession\
  \ skill at the time; characters who wouldn’t have made a Day Job roll don’t earn\
  \ these credits. Make a note of these credits on your most recent Chronicle Sheet\
  \ along with a note explaining their source.</p> \n      <p>The following Adventure\
  \ now awards 2 Reputation with your chosen Faction:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><a\

  \  <p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029vf?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Adventure: Junker’s Delight</em></a> is now sanctioned for play!\
  \ The sanctioning documents for Junker’s Delight follow our new format and model\
  \ for rewards, so you shouldn’t have any issues applying credit to your characters.\
  \ If you see any errors, do let us know so we can correct them and the template\
  \ moving forward.</p> \n      <p>We are working to update the sanctioning documents\
  \ for all sanctioned adventures; we hoped to have them for this blog, but doing\
  \ so turned into a larger series of tasks than we expected. We’re aiming to have\
  \ them all updated in the next two weeks and will let you know with a comment on\
  \ this blog once they are completed. You don’t need to wait for the updated documents\
  \ to get the corrected rewards. We just want to make sure the information isn’t\
  \ buried in a blog post, making it difficult to find easily. </p> \n      <p>Going\
  \ forward, our intention is that all sanctioned Adventures will award XP, Reputation\
  \ and Downtime or Day Job rolls, as well as a level-appropriate amount of gold or\
  \ credits. We’re updating our internal templates now to avoid variations in the\
  \ future. If we missed an adventure that isn’t giving out rewards properly, please\
  \ let us know!</p> \n      <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And\
  \ keep good records!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
