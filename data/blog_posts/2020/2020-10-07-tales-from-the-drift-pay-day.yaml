  description\">Shifts change every eight hours in Lim City. During the hour or two\
  \ linking shifts, the cavern city’s lights seemingly flare even brighter as thousands\
  \ of workers simultaneously emerge from their places of work, recreation, and rest.\
  \ Technically no day or night exists here. When I first arrived, I learned to get\
  \ used to the concept that my existence in this city, much like other places in\
  \ Apostae, boils down to working and not working. Anyone not at the top of one of\
  \ the dark elves’ noble houses spends most of their time making credits, and the\
  \ rest of their time losing what they earn.</p>\n              <p>I wordlessly join\
  \ a flock of commuters, mainly dark elves with the smattering of orc-kin and off-worlders,\
  \ packing into a hover shuttle. The cacophony of thrusters, constant foot traffic,\
  \ and tired chatter building up and then coming down during these commutes brings\
  \ a loud peace with it. I adjust my visor and tighten the scarf around my face,\
  \ concealing the cyan glowing streaks marking my face. I keep my arms wrapped around\
  \ a large, rectangular case as I park beside a window.</p>\n              <p>Thanks\
  \ to a gracious subsidy from the Betterment Council, most inhabitants travel through\
  \ Lim City using some sort of shuttle service or by taking the covered ramps and\
  \ paths linking district hubs. Using either is cheap or free, depending on employer\
  \ agreements with the Council—which most companies have, even the illegal ones—\
  and no one complains about spending less to get around.</p>\n              <p>I\
  \ scan the space outside the window as more vehicles fall in line to avoid collisions\
  \ amid the bustle. We zoom past skyscraper after skyscraper, separated by smaller\
  \ clusters of buildings demarcated with metallic fences and pseudo-crystalline towers.\
  \ Our surroundings grow dim as we pass under the shadow of House Zeizerer’s spire.\
  \ This tower, as well as the other houses’, dwarfs even the most ambitious of the\
  \ nearby high-rise buildings and spans to the utmost height of the cavern, though\
  \ tinted glass panes and slate-colored plates block any view into the interior.</p>\n\

  \ Tukker.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>Approaching a commercial district,\
  \ a sleek hover car catches my attention. Colorful decals—most especially the pattern\
  \ of rippling red and purple flames—primp the black-painted body of the vehicle,\
  \ an imported model from a few years back. Many workers strive for this display\
  \ of wealth, though more importantly, the design matches my contractor’s provided\
  \ info.</p>\n              <p>As if on cue, a text from said contractor appears\
  \ on my burner comm unit: “IS IT DONE?”</p>\n              <p>I read the message\
  \ but return my attention to the hover car instead of responding. The shuttle keeps\
  \ pace with it until the smaller vehicle veers into a parking facility near Meseria\
  \ Market.</p>\n              <p>At the next stop, the passengers almost completely\
  \ abandon the shuttle, and I join them as they scatter into the shopping center.\
  \ Time frame in mind, I restrain myself from ogling at the Arabani Arms outlet store,\
  \ where a pair of dark elf guards flaunt the most recent Karkaken models while keeping\
  \ watch over the premises. Most market establishments host at least a hired muscle\
  \ or two; would-be customers, who simply come to unwind after a day of painstaking\
  \ and likely dangerous work, typically pay them little mind.</p>\n             \
  \ <p>Compared to other settlements, Lim City has a “generous” token system to pay\
  \ for utilities—like power and water. Air too, though I never needed it. Everyone\
  \ in the city can earn a pool of tokens to spend exclusively on those utilities\
  \ at special rates, accumulated based on hours they work for participating companies.\
  \ The system gives the average citizen some breathing room, both literal and metaphorical,\
  \ which often leaves them extra credits to spend each pay day, even after deductions\
  \ mandated by the Council.</p>\n              <p>Holo-boards line the walls between\
  \ stores, giving contrast to the otherwise gray plating. Some advertise new commodities—\
  a pocket decoupler eventually pays for itself. Other boards share favorable news\
  \ from around the Pact Worlds. One, however, features my current employer, Almieera\
  \ Zeizerer; this instance, she lends her face to an advert lauding the Betterment\
  \ Council for recently adding gravity modulation to the token system. How considerate.</p>\n\
  \              <p>After all, we still live on Apostae. Lim City belongs to the dark\
  \ elves as much as Nightarch does, though arguably with more even stakes as the\
  \ houses divided the Council. What matters is that they give the drones—their workers—\
  alternate ways to financially trap themselves here. There’s a Meseria Market in\
  \ every corner of this city, just with different names. The semblance of comfort\
  \ with their basic living expenses tempts people into spending credits for something\
  \ nice, rather than something needed. Like some social experiment, the houses create\
  \ new ways to keep their workers content enough to stay in Lim City and, more importantly,\
  \ to stay profitable.</p>\n              <p>At first, I tried playing by these rules,\
  \ but two shifts each “day” with nothing to actually show for the effort frustrated\
  \ me to no end. Maybe another life could’ve taken that grind. I refused, especially\
  \ when looking closely at the numbers. I knew I’d rather get the pay elsewhere than\
  \ have my “legit” credits go to a pseudo-public subsidiary.</p>\n              <p>I\
  \ elbow past a group gawking at the boards, ignoring the flustered swears from behind\
  \ me. Then, I round the corner into the food court and head straight into a half-empty\
  \ establishment called Deeplight Eats—an unassuming deli that doubles as one of\
  \ the Zeizerer’s many fronts in Lim City.</p>\n              <p>The manager, a half-orc\
  \ woman called Hevra, greets me. “Hey, Reverb. You here for a…?” Her gaze lingers\
  \ on my case.</p>\n              <p>I wave at her. “Yeah. Be back in about an hour.\
  \ Prep the usual.” I proceed to the backroom. Like digital clockwork, I take the\
  \ stairs to the rooftop and then climb beyond, outside the frames of the open-air\
  \ market’s bubble—I’d argue against an artificial bubble being “open air.” I dip\
  \ into vacuum territory for a few minutes, where I cross multiple buildings before\
  \ slipping back into the enclosed space at the parking facility’s rooftop.</p>\n\
  \              <p>After double checking my spot, I ensure that the cameras are dead\
  \ like my contractor promised. Satisfied, I assemble my rifle from the parts case,\
  \ giving the scope a quick polish before securing it. Then, I survey the area.</p>\n\
  \              <p>After a few minutes, I spot the target: Raxikz Veresvi, recently\
  \ appointed by Zeizerer Munitions to oversee a chain of outlet stores. Silver hair\
  \ sleeked back and dressed in a burgundy suit that perfectly wraps around his slender\
  \ figure, he matches my employer’s description, down to the oversized purple-tinted\
  \ cufflinks. Supposedly, Veresvi elevated himself by charming a certain company\
  \ official. The human woman beside him, however, is definitely not Almieera Zeizerer,\
  \ his supposed flame. With that, I piece together the motive for this contract,\
  \ though dark elves having fickle—and vengeful—hearts seems hardly surprising.</p>\n\
  \              <p>I line up my sight.</p>\n              <p>The pair shows no indication\
  \ of a relation, not even a greedy touch of the hand or an unwarranted smile. Half\
  \ an hour into surveillance, the lights begin to dim, the rush from the shift change\
  \ ebbing. Veresvi takes his company to a nearby restaurant. I lose vision for a\
  \ few minutes, but they reappear at the rooftop. A waiter seats them, hands them\
  \ their menus, and provides them each a drink. I watch him pull the chair out for\
  \ her, smiling as he speaks. When he settles in his seat, I aim my crosshairs at\
  \ his head. A contract is a contract.</p>\n              <p>I pull the trigger.</p>\n\
  \              <p>His body launches off the seat, but I’m already on the move before\
  \ it hits the ground. Picking up my rifle and my case, I retrace my way to Deeplight\
  \ Eats. I head down the staircase but stop midway to disassemble my rifle, returning\
  \ it to its case.</p>\n              <p>A communication request pings on my burner.\
  \ As soon as I accept, a curt, feminine voice states, “Is it done, Reverb?”</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Yes. The target has been eliminated.”</p>\n              <p>“\
  Your payment has been arranged.” The line cuts off.</p>\n              <p>I stare\
  \ at the comm unit before smashing it on a step. I seal my case, dispose of the\
  \ comm’s remnants, and finally sit down at the deli for my first meal in 24 hours.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Most people come to Lim City for the prospect of stability in\
  \ survival, even if it means committing to a cycle that traps them on Apostae. All\
  \ the while they believe the next shift might just lead to prosperity. Then, there\
  \ are those like me. I stay because I make credits gambling outside the system,\
  \ so long as politics or pettiness demand someone gets offed—which will be always.\
  \ I settle for a toasted sandwich now, but unlike the drones, I can look forward\
  \ to a new hover car after only a few more contracts.</p>\n              <p>Eventually,\
  \ I step out of the building, case slung over my back.</p>\n              <p>It\
  \ takes me less than a second to notice the glint of the scope from a rooftop.</p>\n\
