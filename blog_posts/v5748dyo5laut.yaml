  \ class=\"date\">Thursday, March 4, 2010 </p> \n   <p>One of my first duties at\
  \ Paizo was to create some random encounter tables for the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88rc\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a>. It took more than three workdays, and by the end\
  \ of the process I was seeing tables in my sleep. It was a little bit like the first\
  \ time you play Guitar Hero, and you look away from the screen and think the world\
  \ is scrolling up for a couple seconds. Except with tables. But, I'm done with that,\
  \ so that's kind of neat. Now I can dream about normal things, like giant robot\
  \ rock operas and going to Chipotle with my ex-boss of three years. Rest assured,\
  \ GMs, there will be no shortage of random encounter tables for when your PCs randomly\
  \ wander off into the woods, or cave, or different plane of existence. I've even\
  \ snuck out a piece of art from the book by artist Kieran Yanner.</p> \n   <p>On\
  \ a completely different note, I GMed a Pathfinder game yesterday, and it totally\
  \ rocked. I'm always the GM, so it's not like it was a new experience or anything,\
  \ and I've been running Pathfinder since it came out, but I finally figured out\
  \ a core component to any tabletop roleplaying game: <b>roleplaying</b>.</p> \n\
  \   <p>You see, for quite some time, I was having trouble encouraging my players\
  \ to roleplay. I'm the type of person who writes out the five-page character background\
  \ when I'm a player, and I will totally handicap myself and give myself silly stats\
  \ and gear if it matches my character concept. I don't expect every player to do\
  \ this, but it would be kind of cool if my group got into character every now and\
  \ then. Being a fairly chill GM, I wasn't going to force them to roleplay against\
  \ their will or anything, since that would kind of defeat the purpose of playing\
  \ a game. No, what I wanted was for them to <i>want</i> to roleplay.</p> \n   <p>So,\
  \ I've been thinking of ways to do this, and I stumbled upon a rather valuable,\
  \ yet seemingly obvious, idea. The notion was simple, and I presented it to my group\
  \ before the game. \"Alright, guys, I'm thinking of trying this new thing; everything\
  \ you say at the table is in-character, unless you preface with 'Out of character,'\
  \ and it can only be game-related at that.\" They were all kind of like, \"Hmm,\
  \ I dunno about this, Patrick, but we'll give it a shot for an hour and see how\
  \ it goes.\"</p> \n   <p><b>One hour later</b>: awesomeness. Few distractions, if\
  \ any; everybody's talking with epic accents and saying ridiculously metal (aka\
  \ really, really cool) things; and we're all getting really immersed in the game.\
  \ The dark and brooding wizard was dark and brooding; the charming bard was courting\
  \ the maiden he had saved from a coven of hags; the druid was giving the totally\
  \ rad armor of a fallen cleric to the church instead of selling it for mad gold;\
  \ and the summoner was poring over books in the library and hypothesizing the origins\
  \ of the mysterious crystals they had found in the abandoned temple. This group\
  \ of hack-and-slashers actually began to care about the adventure and NPCs I had\
  \ crafted for them. <i>Success.</i></p> \n   <p>I guess my point is that even if\
  \ you think you know your group (mine consists of close friends), they can still\
  \ pleasantly surprise you, given the opportunity.</p> \n   <p>Patrick Renie <br>Editorial\
