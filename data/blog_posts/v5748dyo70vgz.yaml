  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">\"What did I\
  \ tell you about these cheap knockoff sonic plugs?” Quig takes the charred scrap\
  \ in his paw, turning it in front of Iseph so they can see. “They tear like paper\
  \ under a little arcanospheric turbulence!”</p>\n      <p>Iseph’s expression is\
  \ always rigid, courtesy of its metallic composition, but now it’s utterly blank,\
  \ like they didn’t even hear.</p>\n      <p>Quig tries again. “What? That rough\
  \ landing get to you? You? Hunter of adamantine? Just breathe—wait, no—circulate\
  \ your arc coolant and loosen up those radial connector bolts.”</p>\n      <p>“\
  You’re rambling,” Iseph observes, “so you’re fine.”</p>\n      <p>Their metallic\
  \ voice almost sounds annoyed with Quig. Weird. They must really be shaken up, Quig\
  \ figures. Iseph trudges past the landing pod, shrugging off the orbital dive gear\
  \ to make their customary initial survey for hostiles.</p>\n      <p>The mysterious\
  \ Gate of Altyris consumes the horizon with its diameter, framing Quig’s android\
  \ companion and the rest of the empty landscape. They don’t really know why it exists\
  \ or where it leads, only that the whole system is counting on them to activate\
  \ it before the incursion.</p>\n      <p>“Still no idea what this old tech is made\
  \ of,” Quig says as he scampers after Iseph, his rig clanking away. “But whoever\
  \ built that big ring sure did carve out all the good alloys from the planet, didn’\
  t they? This ground’s got more holes in it than I’ve drilled into the ship over\
  \ the years, and that’s saying something.”</p>\n      <p>“Probably unstable,” Iseph\
  \ mutters. “Watch your step. Not flying down for you again.”</p>\n      <p>“Please.\
  \ Who do you think you’re talking to, buddy? This magnetic hover field is so good\
  \ it’ll send <em>you</em> flying if you get too close!”</p>\n      <p>Quig flips\
  \ a switch on his boots. His jump jets make a soft humming sound, buffeting him\
  \ a few scant inches off the ground.</p>\n      <p>“Well—maybe not <em>flying,</em>”\
  \ Quig admits. “But you’ll feel it—oooohhhhh! Look at <em>this!</em>”</p>\n    \
  \  <p>He skates over the broken earth and stops his momentum only by grabbing hold\
  \ of a fantastic console webbed with circuitry and control runes, only some of which\
  \ he recognizes. Sure, there are also beautifully crafted ancient statues standing\
  \ around it, but those are just decoration. Not his thing.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;Iseph\
  \ asks, “Is that the on button?”</p>\n      <p>“Well, it’s made of the same alloy.\
  \ Scan can’t identify it.” Quig has already made the attempt and stashed his hand-scanner\
  \ back in his rig. As fast as he can run his mouth, his brain always runs faster.\
  \ “Similar design. Lemme just pry this panel off—oh, good! That didn’t break anything!\
  \ Yup, I can see the connector here. Then down that channel, and—yup. Binocs confirm\
  \ it, straight to the ring. Kinda reminds me of your sub-neural network. You ever\
  \ mess with the settings on that?”</p>\n      <p>When Quig looks up, he’s surrounded\
  \ by spare parts and loose hardware strewn across the ancient alien platform where\
  \ the console sits. Iseph eyes him the way Quig might eye a passing astral leviathan—\
  with increasing concern the longer it lingers.</p>\n      <p>“Well, have you?”</p>\n\
  \      <p>Iseph blinks. “Have—what? No? Why—”</p>\n      <p>“Ohhh. That might explain\
  \ why your joints erode so fast, ‘Seph. I’m not kidding about loosening up those\
  \ radial connector bolts.”</p>\n      <p>Iseph shook their head. “Makes my combat\
  \ form imprecise.”</p>\n      <p>“Yeah, yeah, obviously not for combat! But you\
  \ can swap between modes, you know! Had to learn that myself.” Quig returns to the\
  \ console, crawling inside to clear out the grime and replace the rusted parts.\
  \ “When I said goodbye to Scout—boy, I hope he’s okay—I’m sure he is, he’s a clever\
  \ bot ever since I figured out how to get him sentient—he’ll do great out there,\
  \ he will, but I think about him sometimes, you know—hand me that spark rotator,\
  \ will you? No, the spark—oh right. You wouldn’t know what that is—I invented it.\
  \ That spiky one with the whoosh doohickey over there—no, the—yeah, that one—so,\
  \ as I was saying, when I designed Munchkin, I realized she’s gotta be adaptable,\
  \ modular, ready to switch things up at—”</p>\n      <p>An alarm beeps in his helmet.\
  \ Munchkin springs from Quig’s rig. The turret unfolds behind him and deploys a\
  \ quickly-heating barrel in seamless parallel.</p>\n      <p>“—a moment’s notice!”\
  </p>\n      <p>Quig rolls into Munchkin’s shadow before an arc ray can blast his\
  \ tail off. The next shot traces him but strikes Munchkin’s armor plating instead.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“See? Zero-latency combat mode initiation!”</p>\n      <p>Only then does\
  \ Quig poke his nose out from behind Munchkin.</p>\n      <p>The statues surrounding\
  \ the console step off their platforms, shedding dust from their joints. Under the\
  \ grime, Quig now sees they’re made of the same alloy as the console.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Iseph unloads their guns on one of those mechanical guardians, precise as\
  \ always, though its chassis absorbs most of the damage impressively.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Quig licks his tall front teeth. “Oh, I want some of that scrap when we’re\
  \ done here!”</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;Iseph shouts, “Can you activate the gate or not?!”\
  </p>\n      <p>Quig tries to finish his repairs, but in his haste, his paw slips,\
  \ slamming his rotator into a panel. A puff of sparks and ozone-flavored smoke blooms\
  \ into his helmet.</p>\n      <p>“Oops.”</p>\n      <p>Iseph rounds on him, so Quig\
  \ clarifies quickly.</p>\n      <p>“Uh, the control panel is in better shape than\
  \ I expected, but the power core is fuzzed!”</p>\n      <p>Iseph’s opticals snap\
  \ to the gate the size of a space station. “We have to power <em>that?!</em>”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Oh, not the gate! <em>That’s</em> fine! It’s just the controls—Oi! Could\
  \ you big hunks of scrap <em>sit still</em> for a sec? I’m working here!”</p>\n\
  \      <p>Quig draws his arc pistol to fire at a guardian with a glowing arc blade\
  \ marching too close for comfort. Nigh simultaneously, Munchkin returns fire at\
  \ a guardian with a zero cannon, firing frosty energy rounds without prompting.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The guardian with the blade shakes off Quig’s shots and advances. That’\
  s when it trips Munchkin’s motion sensor. She swivels a secondary reaction cannon,\
  \ stopping it in its tracks with an opportunistic blast.</p>\n      <p>“Ha! See?\
  \ I <em>told you</em> to sit still!” Quig fires again, but this time, he observes\
  \ how the armoring alloy reacts. His brain races through possible methods to pierce\
  \ it even as he generates ideas for powering the console. “Maybe with repairs, the\
  \ landing pod engine could power the console—what do you think, ‘Seph—”</p>\n  \
  \    <p>The blade guardian closes the distance and swings down at Quig’s head. He\
  \ blocks with his arc pistol, but the guardian is over twice his weight. Quig topples\
  \ onto his back. The blade burns, searing his eyeshield hotter and hotter the closer\
  \ it bears down.</p>\n      <p>One of Munchkin’s frost rounds strikes the cannon\
  \ guardian in a leg joint, and it wobbles and trips into the chasm. Quig’s round\
  \ ears perk up at the receding sound of the alloy hitting stone—down—down—down…\
  </p>\n      <p>“Nice lucky shot, Munchkin,” Quig grunts, “but I think you’ve got\
  \ a better tool for the rest of this job!”</p>\n      <p>Munchkin activates her\
  \ array shift in response to the neural command from Quig’s exocortex. The blazing\
  \ barrel recedes, replaced by a barrel with self-protective vibrational dampeners.\
  \ When her next round strikes the blade guardian, the tip of the ammunition shell\
  \ clicks and a thunderclap detonates.</p>\n      <p>Sonic ripples vibrate through\
  \ the guardian’s chassis and crack it at the weakest joints. Then Quig hears a hundred\
  \ tiny internal mechanisms shattering under sonic shock.</p>\n      <p>It wheels\
  \ back from Quig and slumps over the console, powering down.</p>\n      <p>Quig\
  \ springs back up to his hindpaws. “Sonic damage! Great! I can <em>always</em> be\
  \ <em>louder!</em>” He reaches into his rig for an electromag grenade. “Let’s just\
  \ make a few adjustments here…! How you doing over there, ‘Seph?”</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ only response Quig gets is a flurry of gunshots.</p>\n      <p>“You know, you’\
  re not a great conversation partner, ‘Seph.” Quig sticks a thin tool into the grenade’\
  s casing. “I feel like we never talk. I mean, I’d usually chat like this with Navasi\
  \ or Dae, but this arcanosphere’s sent the comms to the cats—that’s why I didn’\
  t tell you I had it all under control, see, when the pod went down—could’ve saved\
  \ you a trip—”</p>\n      <p>“We!” Iseph takes another shot. “Are in combat!”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Yeah! What about it?”</p>\n      <p>Iseph doesn’t answer and instead\
  \ swings around to fend off a guardian approaching from behind.</p>\n      <p>“\
  Must have lost their train of thought,” Quig mutters. “Happens to me all the time!\
  \ Anyway, I’m glad you <em>did</em>come, ‘Seph, in these circumstances.”</p>\n \
  \     <p>Iseph’s gunshot shatters one of the statues’ headplates. They lift their\
  \ head, heartened...</p>\n      <p>Quig pulls the pin on the grenade. “Who would\
  \ I talk to if you weren’t here? Sure, there’s always you, Munchkin, I like talking\
  \ to you, but it’s nice when someone quips back. You know?”</p>\n      <p>Iseph’\
  s face snaps back into a grimace.</p>\n      <p>“Yeah! See? Munchkin says she wants\
  \ to get to know you better too, ‘Seph. You can talk to us anytime.”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>“Chuck it!” Iseph shouts at him.</p>\n      <p>“Cheese Louise! You could just\
  \ say <em>no—</em>oh. Chuck the <em>grenade</em>.” He tosses it over his shoulder\
  \ just as it starts beeping rapidly. “I was getting there! We were in the middle\
  \ of—”</p>\n      <p>The words “a heartfelt conversation” vanish beneath an explosion\
  \ of sound.</p>\n      <p>An earsplitting cacophony buries the following sentence\
  \ as the vibration of the sonic grenade shudders through the unstable terrain. Cracks\
  \ lace the ground, each setting off a chain reaction in the rock. Everything apart\
  \ from the ten-foot-square around the console crumbles, slabs of earth careening\
  \ into the abyss like dominoes.</p>\n      <p>The guardians still standing plummet\
  \ into the maw of the planet. Iseph leaps to the console just in time to avoid the\
  \ same fate, and Quig hits Munchkin’s emergency recall switch, prompting her to\
  \ fold back into his rig.</p>\n      <p>For the first time since they arrived, they\
  \ stand in utter silence.</p>\n      <p>That lasts until Quig opens his mouth again.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Phew! That was close!” Quig pats Iseph on the shoulder, now that they’\
  re within reach. “That turned into a bit of a clusterfuzz, didn’t it?”</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Iseph gives him a withering look and wipes dirt from their opticals.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Quig himself frowns, turning toward the open console. “Now, how am I gonna\
  \ run big enough power cables across that chasm from the pod…?”</p>\n      <p>His\
  \ eyes rise to the guardian slumped over the console.</p>\n      <p>“Hold on. <em>You</em>\
  \ must have an independent power source…”</p>\n      <p>Quig yanks the console’\
  s power cables out of its case and pries open the glowing casing over the guardian’\
  s power core. With a few adjustments and an adapter, he plugs it straight into the\
  \ body.</p>\n      <p>The console lights up, and Quig begins the activation sequence\
  \ for the gate.</p>\n      <p>“Just like that! Easy cheesy!” Quig smiles at Iseph.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Iseph, however, stares at the corpse of the constructed guardian that\
  \ their companion has fashioned into a battery. “That’s horrifying.”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Quig glances between them.</p>\n      <p>“Oh! Sorry! I guess it is, kinda!\
  \ I didn’t…” Quig points a thumb at the body. “You want me to disconnect and…?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“No. It’s practical,” Iseph says. “So are most of your suggestions.\
  \ Practical <em>and</em> disturbing.”</p>\n      <p>“Oh.” Quig nods. “Just let me\
  \ know if I ever, you know, bother you.”</p>\n      <p>Iseph shakes their head.\
  \ “You just talk too much.”</p>\n      <p>“Probably.” Quig can’t argue with that.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Iseph’s internal servos spin.</p>\n      <p>Quig asks, “Seriously, if\
  \ you’re not comfortable, you can just tell me to shut up—”</p>\n      <p>“I,” Iseph\
  \ interrupts him. Quig lets them talk. “I… would like your help… with my radial\
  \ connector bolts. The zero-latency mode shift is impressive. I’d like that edge.\
  \ But I don’t know how to…”</p>\n      <p>Quig’s whiskered face stretches into a\
  \ toothy grin. “I’ll show you! Every sentient should get to know their own hardware!\
  \ Even us meaty ones! I tell you, even my <em>knees</em> have been telling me a\
  \ lot lately. <em>Everything’s</em> got something to say! If you know how to talk\
  \ to it, the whole universe opens up to you!”</p>\n      <p>The gate blooms to life\
  \ on the horizon beyond.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
