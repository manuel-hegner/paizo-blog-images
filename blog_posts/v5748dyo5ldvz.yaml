  \ \n    <p>by F. Wesley Schneider</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: Holding an Edge</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Night's the only time I risk the streets. Dingy streetlamps are far easier\
  \ to avoid than the sun—not that the ways I frequent ever have streetlamps. </p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">My face isn't a welcome one here. Too\
  \ many have seen it too recently and too often. Everyone has their bad memories,\
  \ their reasonable hatreds, and many of those injustices look like me. I'd started\
  \ out hoping that maybe I could change that, but a year of stinking alleys, tear-soaked\
  \ streets, and steel rusted by blood made me doubt.</span></p> \n    <p>Those with\
  \ coin have ways to solve their problems; in the light of day, with the new law,\
  \ with a few words in the right ears. Those without… they've got the real problems,\
  \ the messy ones no one cares enough to handle. The ones there's never a law for.\
  \ Copper and bruised flesh buys a far less reliable brand of justice, and everything\
  \ gets muddy down on the old city's streets. Those who live there know it so well\
  \ it's not worth explaining. Those who don't will never understand.</p> \n    <p>I'm\
  \ no expert. I wasn't born to those flophouses, sweaty basements, and alley shanties.\
  \ I didn't ask to come, either—but I guess no one does. The difference between me\
  \ and most of the players in that rehearsal for Hell was that when I arrived, whoever\
  \ threw me there thought they finished me. They might have scarred my body, stolen\
  \ my respect, and broken everything I was going to be, but I came through. I wasn't\
  \ some sword straight from the fire, but sometimes even dross holds an edge.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Someone like the Varisian girl couldn't afford a sword. That's why she\
  \ followed the rumors no guardsman would ever gamble on and found me. She said her\
  \ brothers had been murdered. She knew by who but not why. That seemed convenient,\
  \ but her people lied as easily as they spoke. The city watch would have dismissed\
  \ her for that reason alone. For a moment I was tempted to do the same, but tears\
  \ had dug twin graves in that soft face—a face that would never be as pretty as\
  \ it was before. So I named my price. </p> \n    <p>She tried to bargain. I stopped\
  \ her before she embarrassed us both. She went ahead anyway, and I was the only\
  \ one embarrassed. She took my silence for disgust—an easy mistake; it's difficult\
  \ to read expressions through steel—and forked over some bauble of hemp and cracked\
  \ beads that wouldn't buy me a meal. I stayed quiet, and her desperation urged her\
  \ further, but she had nothing left but words, the promise of future promises. It\
  \ would have to do—favors seemed in short supply these days anyway.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ waited until well after midnight, until an hour when anyone with honest business\
  \ was long since abed, before heading into the street. Even then I kept to the alleys.\
  \ I didn't care if the drunks and alley rats saw me—their kind only survived because\
  \ they'd learned to keep their mouths shut. No one would believe them anyway. Most\
  \ didn't even believe their own senses, dismissing my steps as too soundless on\
  \ the crumbling cobbles, doubting the metal glimpsed beneath my close-drawn cloak,\
  \ disbelieving my face as a nightmare conjured by booze more poison than liquor.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>It didn't take long for the streets to give way to boards, and then\
  \ from boards to muck. I hated the docks, not just because of rust and my obvious\
  \ wariness of water, but for the constant noise. It compounded a disadvantage. Much\
  \ of the world was muffled thanks to my helm, and the constant rasp of water over\
  \ trash beaches and the clunking of moored boats didn't help. But her directions\
  \ had been specific.</p> \n    <p>If the <i>Caterwaul</i> had seen better days,\
  \ no one ever visited to reminisce. I'd never spent a day of my life on a boat,\
  \ so I couldn't say why such a capable-looking fishing trawler had been abandoned\
  \ in the first place, but it surely wasn't leaving port again. Mold draped what\
  \ rigging had survived, moss collected upon much of the wood, and though the masts\
  \ still stood, the sails had disappeared as surely as the ship's crew. What remained\
  \ of a vandalized figurehead, ruggedly carved as a mangy cat, stared inland, yowling\
  \ for its absentee captain's return.</p> \n    <p>Light flickered through the ship's\
  \ bowed timbers, and a burst of nasty guffaws preceded a long string of repetitive\
  \ curses, verifying rumors that the <i>Caterwaul</i> had a new crew.</p> \n    <p>Supposedly\
  \ a gambler called Quil ran a nightly game of cheaters' dice in the wreck's hold.\
  \ This particular game was widely known in Old Dock's shadier watering holes as\
  \ having relatively square dice and life-changing stakes. But those who sat and\
  \ listened to the stories long enough eventually heard them repeated, and always\
  \ from the same loudmouths—publicizers doubtlessly on Quil's payroll. No doubt a\
  \ game played out here nightly, but it wasn't just this Mr. Quil gambling. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>With the tide low, the <i>Caterwaul</i> leaned against the dilapidated\
  \ dock, its hull sunk deep into the rancid muck. The noise and light drifted up\
  \ from below the pier, as though the game were taking place right in the surf. Good.\
  \ I wasn't eager to try and creep across the ship's deck, guessing at which rotted\
  \ timber might give me away. Slipping across the muddy boardwalk, I dropped onto\
  \ the dark of the beach below.</p> \n    <p>The forgotten temple of some imaginary\
  \ goddess of sea-junk sprang up around me. Pilings marched in almost even rows parallel\
  \ to the shore, their crusty coverings of muck and barnacles suggesting elaborate\
  \ religious reliefs. Piles of discarded crates, small wrecked boats, and other unidentifiable\
  \ heaps became the inhuman artistry of this weird sanctuary, while the heavy scents\
  \ of wood rot and sewage made do as incense. Fortunately, the local congregation\
  \ didn't seem to be terribly devout.</p> \n    <p>Ahead, the hold of the <i>Caterwaul</i>\
  \ gaped open, the terminal gash explaining the end of its days at sea. Within, five\
  \ figures surrounded a crate making do as a table, dice and the coins of fresh bets\
  \ scattered beneath a lantern wobbling overhead. None looked like sailors.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Despite the unlikelihood that anyone within could see me, I stuck to the\
  \ deepest recesses of the under-docks. It wouldn't look like it to most, but this\
  \ was a classic Sczarni trap. In this trick, you make yourself the bait, setting\
  \ up in the open so the guards, or thieves, or whoever you've pissed off this week\
  \ think they've got the drop on you. That way most don't even bother to look for\
  \ the cutthroat hidden away in the dark. I'd fallen for it once before and almost\
  \ got knifed. Lesson learned, I waited now, letting my eyes adjust, searching through\
  \ the motion of the flickering shadows and lazy roll of the shallow surf.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I counted time in the rolls of dice. Two complete games passed as I stared\
  \ into the dark, until finally a lean, excitable fellow won a significant pot. A\
  \ wave of shouts, curses, and banged bottles rose and ebbed, rattling the lantern\
  \ above and upsetting the shadows leaning away from the broken ship. One shadow\
  \ craned its neck from behind an algae-draped stanchion, light flickering for an\
  \ instant across the quarrel set in its crossbow.</p> \n    <p>Just one guard. Mr.\
  \ Quil shouldn't be so frugal with his security.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Quil should have brought more than a crossbow.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>My response came faster than thought, and my armor immediately rebelled\
  \ at the twitch of that old reflex. Three escapee syllables whispered within my\
  \ helm, turning harsh inside my metal mask. Intonations that once came as easily\
  \ as a child's prayer tripped over my lips, becoming jumbled upon hearing themselves\
  \ spoken by an unfamiliar voice. They sounded like lost faith. </p> \n    <p>I choked\
  \ back the rest of what I would have once called magic, but it was only for the\
  \ sake of stealth. If there had still been power in those noises, I would have felt\
  \ some twinge, some hint of it building like steam in a kettle. Instead, all I felt\
  \ was rust, biting leather, and my own tired muscles. The words—or the memory of\
  \ what they should have been—made me feel weak, and I shoved them back into the\
  \ scabbed over recesses of my mind, down with all the other wounds of what I used\
  \ to be. I hadn't chosen them, but I had other, more direct solutions now.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Suddenly eager to move, I slipped between the pilings, darkness masking\
  \ my steel and the waves drowning the sound of my steps. His attention more on the\
  \ game than his watch, the guard's first hint of my presence came as I snapped upon\
  \ him like the jaws of a hunter's trap. My free arm locked around his chest and\
  \ arms as my mailed hand dug into his face, slamming his head back against my pauldron.\
  \ Hair muffled the clang of his skull striking metal, his body tensing for an instant\
  \ before going limp. I let him drop into the muck. If he woke up, he'd have a nasty\
  \ knot to nurse. If.</p> \n    <p>Gliding up to the hull, I slunk close to the hole\
  \ that served as the entrance to the makeshift gambling den. Again I waited for\
  \ a distraction, and this time it didn't take long. Cheating was actually part of\
  \ cheaters' dice, so you couldn't really call an opponent a cheater and have it\
  \ mean anything. But at a game usually played with bare knives upon the table, part\
  \ of the challenge was knowing how far you could push your opponents' tolerance.\
  \ Someone had just gone too far.</p> \n    <p>The dice clattered. Shouts rose without\
  \ the accompanying laughter. A fist pounded the table, and a stool skidded across\
  \ the floor. More shouts and thuds. </p> \n    <p>I drew my sword and stepped into\
  \ the light.</p> \n    <p>My entrance was the flood that stopped the house fire.\
  \ Suddenly no one was seated. A beast of a man was already grabbing for a whip-thin\
  \ braggart wearing the melting traces of a gloating smile—I don't think either of\
  \ them even saw me as brutal intention drove them toward the hold's shadowed stern.\
  \ But others did. Doing a double-take as he looked past the brawlers, a formerly\
  \ bored man with hair the greasy gray of pigeon feathers jolted to his feet, cursing\
  \ and sweeping dice and coins into the pockets of a once-fine violet vest. A pair\
  \ of less swift players—wet old stevedores, their leathery faces incapable of showing\
  \ surprise—rose slowly amid the confusion. Over the clatter of silver, the coin\
  \ collector pointed at me and shouted to the brawlers. Had a twenty-foot-long sea\
  \ snake just washed into the room, he couldn't have looked more startled. I singled\
  \ him out as Mr. Quil.</p> \n    <p>I went directly for him. As I strode in, the\
  \ coinless dockworkers clambered out, the hurried slaps of their steps soon receding\
  \ in the muddy surf. Pointing my blade at Quil's throat, only a stride away, I made\
  \ my intention clear. </p> \n    <p>To his credit, he didn't flinch, instead yanking\
  \ up a crossbow from behind the crate-table. Although loaded, it was little more\
  \ than a toy. Still, he fired, and the miniature bolt struck me solidly in the chest.\
  \ Had I been some thug in scavenged rags, I'd be retching up my lifeblood. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>I wasn't. The bolt ricocheted away harmlessly, and a kick shattered the\
  \ crate between us. The crossbow in Quil's hands followed suit a half-moment later,\
  \ my blade swiping it from his hands and crushing it against the ship's sweating\
  \ timbers. Quil pressed himself against those same moist boards, unsuccessfully\
  \ trying to find some crevice wide enough to squeeze through and escape.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Something struck the small of my back. It shattered, and a man's high-pitched\
  \ scream rang out. I twisted away from the impact. Harsh words came to my lips,\
  \ both curses and something more. I bit them back. </p> \n    <p>The smaller of\
  \ the two thugs, his face already blossoming where it had caught three or four of\
  \ the larger man's punches, was stumbling back away from me. In one shaking hand\
  \ he barely balanced the handle of a rusty chef's knife, the shattered slivers of\
  \ blade running deep between his fingers and into the meat of a lacerated palm.\
  \ He tripped backward, whimpering, and bolted out through the broken hull. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Unfortunately, he had been the big fellow's only distraction. Shuffling\
  \ from the rear of the ship, the apelike goon had to duck to keep his head from\
  \ scraping the deck above. He paused as he reentered the ring of lantern light,\
  \ obviously not sure what to make of me. Quil shrieked at the brute. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"She's one of the mad queen's guards, you dolt! A Gray Maiden!\" </p> \n \
  \   <p>I winced at the old name. Something in my head, something I still couldn't\
  \ banish, swelled with pride even as my teeth clenched and a spark of rage flared\
  \ deep in my guts. </p> \n    <p>\"Take her down!\" Quil continued. \"When you're\
  \ done with her, we'll turn what's left over to the guard for a prize!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The bewilderment on the brute's thick features peeled back in a lecherous\
  \ smile, his eyes tracing the curves of my armor. A lewd chuckle croaked from over-plump\
  \ lips.</p> \n    <p>There's little I wouldn't do for another day back in the life\
  \ I had before my abduction. Before my armor. Before the queen. But occasionally\
  \ a situation arises where I loathe my condition perhaps less than I should. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>If the brute could see the smirk locked behind my visor, he might have\
  \ rethought his intentions. But he couldn't, and didn't.</p> \n    <p>He rushed\
  \ in, his hairy, broad-knuckled hands outstretched. My sword wheeled, a ribbon of\
  \ silver, and a hand slapped a curved wall far from where anyone stood. </p> \n\
  \    <p>The breathy bellow that followed filled the hold. The big man's face flushed,\
  \ and the stump of his hand shoved across his chest into the cloth of his armpit,\
  \ the yellow stains there swiftly overwhelmed by another shade. Too enraged to realize\
  \ how lucky he'd been, the giant channeled his wrath into a howl and charged, his\
  \ remaining hand reaching as if he hoped to crush my neck in a singlehanded grip.\
  \ By the time his momentum carried him to the spot where I'd been standing, the\
  \ light was already fading from his eyes, his prodigious belly split like a wet\
  \ sack. What followed sounded like a fisherman slopping his haul onto the planks,\
  \ but I had already turned. With a jerk, I again leveled my sword at Quil, blood\
  \ whipping from the blade to spray the wall and his face with a line of sharp crimson.\
  \ He flinched, and I grabbed him by his neck, pulling him close to the featureless\
  \ plane of steel that was my face. </p> \n    <p>He gazed into the hollows of my\
  \ helm. Whether he could see my eyes locked away beneath the mask or just the stifling\
  \ darkness, he didn't find what he was desperately hoping for—some sign of mercy.\
  \ Of humanity.</p> \n    <p>All he could do was whimper.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
