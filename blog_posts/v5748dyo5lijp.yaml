  \ Best Character Ever—Alahazra</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 1, 2016</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p>Hello all! I've been reading the\
  \ \"Best Character Ever\" blogs for a while. Watching. Waiting. Biding my time until\
  \ I got the perfect chance to explain why every one of them has been completely\
  \ and utterly wrong (except Tanis's: goblins are pretty cool, after all.) <i>[I\
  \ did not add that aside, but I applaud the author's good sense. -Tanis]</i> But\
  \ even goblins do not compare to the awesome might that is Alahazra.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>If those white and red robes remind you of a certain classic\
  \ video game character... trust me, she's not quite so forgiving.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Alahazra, the iconic oracle, made her first\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Adventure Card Game</a> appearance in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</em></a>.\
  \ She may look weak at first, with her paltry d4s for Strength and Dexterity, but\
  \ she sees things that others can't, and uses that information to beat down on enemies,\
  \ acquire cards, and close locations like a <i>boss</i>. You see, S&amp;S Alahazra\
  \ has a d12 for her Charisma, and she also uses that for her Divine checks. This\
  \ means that when it's time to cast an offensive spell, she's often going to deal\
  \ a ton of damage, especially with her final power giving her an extra +2 on all\
  \ spells that have the Attack trait. She also has a great chance of recharging her\
  \ spells with that high Divine check... but even when she fails a recharge check,\
  \ she gets to trade any discarded card with the Divine trait for any other one (so\
  \ a blessing for a spell, perhaps?) at the end of her turn.</p> \n    <p>Alahazra's\
  \ other main power is the ability to recharge a card with the Divine trait to examine\
  \ the top card of any location. This means that Alahazra can scout for everyone\
  \ as long as she has a few blessings or spells in her hand that she doesn't mind\
  \ recharging. (And she starts with 2/3 of her deck being spells and blessings!)\
  \ In my playthrough of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, I found that a perfect turn for Alahazra entailed\
  \ recharging enough cards to look at the top card of every location deck, leaving\
  \ just a spell in her hand, and then exploring and hopefully killing a monster with\
  \ that spell.</p> \n    <p>Now, I'm not going to try to act like Alahazra has no\
  \ weaknesses. If she's dealt damage, since she starts with no armor, she'll usually\
  \ be taking all of that damage from her large hand size. With her ability to fish\
  \ Cure spells back out of her discard pile, though, this generally doesn't end up\
  \ being a huge problem. Our S&amp;S Damiel was at risk of dying way more often than\
  \ my Alahazra was. (Though our Damiel player was a fan of living dangerously...\
  \ this might be an Alchemist trait.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>If Alahazra isn't gazing into the stars, she might as well be\
  \ destroying them.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>For roles, I'm going to start with the\
  \ Tempest. This role is all about damaging enemies with her spells. In fact, she\
  \ likes spells that have the Attack trait so much, she can even cast Arcane spells\
  \ as long as they have that trait! She also adds up to 4 to each of her combat checks\
  \ when using the Attack trait, so she can dole out some serious punishment.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But while Alahazra's Tempest role is great, her Stargazer role is absolutely\
  \ <i>amazing</i>! This role gives her several powers that build upon her examine\
  \ ability, allowing her to recharge cards for other characters or—and this is the\
  \ important one—<i>encounter</i> boons that she examines at any location! This means\
  \ that, for the price of recharging a blessing or a Divine spell, Alahazra can examine\
  \ a card at another location, and if it's a boon, she can attempt to acquire it.\
  \ If she makes the check, awesome, new boon for her! But even if she fails the check,\
  \ she has just removed a card from the top of another location deck without risking\
  \ fighting a monster. By the end of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>, my Alahazra was spending her whole turn recharging\
  \ blessings to rip boons off the top of every deck, leaving all the monsters for\
  \ other combatants to face.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> version of Alahazra was amazing, the best character\
  \ I've ever played... and now in the <a href=\"\"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>,\
  \ we're getting a NEW version of her! This Alahazra is tougher and more combat-oriented\
  \ than the S&amp;S version, so I imagine she'll appeal to a different group of players.\
  \ Don't worry, though, she still has the ability to examine cards and scout ahead.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Just as beautiful, and even more deadly.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>This new version of Alahazra still has paltry d4s for her Strength and Dexterity,\
  \ but her Constitution is a respectable d8, as is her Intelligence. She still has\
  \ a bonus to Knowledge, which will be very helpful if you play her through Season\
  \ of the Righteous, and her awesome d12 Charisma with +2 Divine bonus is still there\
  \ in all its glory. However, this time Alahazra can shirk other Attack spells to\
  \ use her own holy fire on enemies, getting a respectable 1d12 + 2d4+2 right off\
  \ the bat by discarding the top card of her deck. This means you can feel free to\
  \ load her deck up with Cure spells to get all those discarded cards back without\
  \ worrying about whether you have the resources to fight.</p> \n    <p>Oracle Deck\
  \ Alahazra still has a power that involves examining cards, and in this case it\
  \ lets her examine an extra card whenever she examines. This pairs incredibly nicely\
  \ with the promo card that came with the Alahazra mini in <a href=\"/products/btpy99z3\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes Set 3</em></a>, allowing her to examine yet\
  \ another extra card. Make sure to pick up an Augury spell!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Promo-SeersHeaddress_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It may not be comfortable, but at least it's lighter than <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgcn\">Shardra's</a>!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ last power listed on Alahazra's card uses a new term you might not have seen before:\
  \ \"invokes\". The term will be familiar to those playtesting the upcoming Mummy's\
  \ Mask Base Set, but this is the first time a card bearing the word is seeing the\
  \ light of day. A check invokes a trait if it has or is against a card that has\
  \ that trait, so if either your check or the card you're encountering has the trait,\
  \ you're good. A bane invokes a trait if it has that trait or if it deals only damage\
  \ of the type that matches that trait.</p> \n    <p>As you can see, this \"invokes\"\
  \ power applies to Alahazra's first power, letting her burn evil away with her holy\
  \ fire and then move away afterward. Perhaps you examined the top three cards of\
  \ your current location, saw a monster that you could easily destroy, but then found\
  \ an important boon that Alahazra just doesn't have the correct skill to acquire?\
  \ Just kill off that pesky monster and move away to another location to explore\
  \ some more, leaving that sweet magic pistol for Lirianne to pick up on her turn\
  \ instead.</p> \n    <p>Before I leave you, let's examine one of Class Deck Alahazra's\
  \ roles. This happens to be my favorite of her two new roles: the Wandering Prophet.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraWanderingProphet.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-AlahazraWanderingProphet_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>When Alahazra shows up in your village, you should probably\
  \ ask her about your future. It might just save your life.</i>\n    </div> \n  \
  \  <p>Why do I like this role? Well, mostly because it brings back some of that\
  \ seer-y goodness that I loved so much about her in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"\
  ><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>. First off, you don't always have to discard\
  \ a card to use your holy fire anymore—if it's a spell or a blessing, you get to\
  \ recharge it instead (and let's face it, most of her deck is going to be made up\
  \ of spells and blessings). She also gets to move other characters when she invokes\
  \ the Fire trait, which is useful. But it's those new powers at the bottom that\
  \ I'm most excited about. First, you get to evade barriers, which are in all honesty\
  \ a challenge for both incarnations of Alahazra. You can even let other characters\
  \ evade barriers eventually.</p> \n    <p>My favorite new power, though, is that\
  \ examine power. You get to examine the top card of your location deck, at the end\
  \ and eventually <i>also</i> the start of your turn, at no cost. Combine this with\
  \ her earlier power (and her headdress!), and you're examining most of the deck\
  \ in just a few turns. You can plan out every step of your turn before encountering\
  \ a single card!</p> \n    <p>Now I know you can agree that Alahazra is the best\
  \ character ever. She doesn't need brute strength, fancy weapons, or armor. She\
  \ knows what's coming before it arrives, and can prepare herself accordingly. She\
  \ can look into the future and see the answer to a question before it is asked...\
  \ and when necessary, she can rain down some serious divine wrath on an enemy or\
  \ two. As much as I love <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li9y\">Lini</a>, and as\
  \ much as I'm looking forward to seeing <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lid6\">Ramexes</a>\
  \ in action, the best character ever released (so far) for the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game is, without question, Alahazra.</p> \n    <p>Tyler Beck<br> <i>Freelance\
