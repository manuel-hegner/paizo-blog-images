  ><em>Lost Omens World Guide</em></a> hardcover sourcebook. We've spent a lot of\

  \ Path—the northern stretch of Avistan now known as the Saga Lands! </p> \n    \

  \ Pathfinder's history, no region has been as thoroughly explored in the pages of\
  \ our adventures as the frontier land of Varisia. For millennia, the untamed land\
  \ was defined by its ancient past, as Varisians, Shoanti, and explorers and colonists\
  \ from distant lands all eked out a living in the shadow of cyclopean Thassilonian\
  \ ruins. But in the past decade, the long-dormant runelords awakened and attempted\
  \ to reclaim their former empire. Alaznist, Karzoug, Krune, Xanderghul, and Zutha\
  \ have all been defeated, and the powerful heroes who foiled their plans now watch\
  \ over the land, leading many to hope for a safer future for inhabitants of cities\
  \ like Korvosa and Magnimar. As the latter grows in prominence to become the largest\
  \ and most influential Varisian settlement, Korvosa continues to decline, even under\
  \ the new leadership of Cressida Kroft, who took over in the wake of the tyrannical,\
  \ plague-tainted rule of Queen Ileosa. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \      <p>But Magnimar is far from the only kingdom in resurgence. In the northern\
  \ reaches of Varisia—the hilly plains of the Nolands and the impossibly high Kodar\
  \ Mountains—the two surviving runelords have claimed a new kingdom of their own:\
  \ New Thassilon! Under the conflicting rules of envious Runelord Belimarius and\
  \ the less expansionist Runelord Sorshen, New Thassilon is already on the brink\
  \ of civil war as the two powerful wizards vie for contril of the new kingdom. From\
  \ her capital of Xin-Edasseril off Varisia's western coast, Belimarius already sets\
  \ her sights on the elven forest of Celwynvian and the southern Lands of the Linnorm\
  \ Kings, but these long-established lands are not so quick to roll over and bow\
  \ before the upstart runelord. Sorshen has set her capital in Xin-Shalast, high\
  \ in the Kodar Mountains, where no one has claimed the land since before Earthfall.\
  \ With no feuds for territory (other than from Belimarius, who has no desire to\
  \ share power), Sorshen has opened the isolated city up to outcasts and exiles from\
  \ across the world, promising them a safe place to live their lives free from the\
  \ oppression of their enemies.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \     </div> \n      <p>To the north, the balance of power in the Lands of the Linnorm\
  \ Kings has shifted, and three new linnorm crowns sit upon new brows. King Thira\
  \ Ash-Eyes earned her right to rule Kalsgard after her father, King Svienn Blood-Eagle\
  \ departed for Valenhall across the sea, leaving the throne vacant for her should\
  \ she slay a linnorm (she did). In Icemark, the Varki ranger Nankou surprised many\
  \ by being the first non-Ulfen to earn the title. In the southern city of Jol, the\
  \ famed adventurer Ostog the Unslain puts his moniker to the test as the Linnorm\
  \ King closest to Runelord Belimarius's lands. What great sagas of these new Linnorm\
  \ Kings and the mighty heroes who vie for future vacant thrones will be told in\
  \ the near future? Perhaps some wise skald will regale us with tales of heroism\
  \ in another decade's time.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190723-thira.jpg\"\

  \ Ulfen of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and the Jadwiga of its eastern neighbor,\
  \ Irissen, have cooled in recent years (pun intended), thanks to the rise of Queen\
  \ Anastasia, who hails from a distant world where magic is less prevalent. While\
  \ not a daughter of Baba Yaga like the ice queens who preceded her, the legendary\
  \ witch's blood nevertheless flows through her veins. A much more benevolent ruler\
  \ than past queens, Anastasia gives the people of Irrisen and its neighbors hope\
  \ for a better future. Nevertheless, the constant winter of the enchanted land continues,\
  \ and rumors of Baba Yaga's presence in the land out of season persist. Could the\
  \ mother of witches have plans to reassert control over the land by placing a new\
  \ daughter on the throne in Anastasia's place?</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords to Irrisen's east seems on the precipice\
  \ of peace for the first time in over a century, as the threats of winter witches\
  \ to the west, the demons of the Worldwound to the east, and the orcs of Belkzen\
  \ to the south have all subsided. This has allowed the nomadic Kellids of the harsh\
  \ taiga to travel farther into all three neighboring lands in their seasonal hunts\
  \ of the region's megafauna than ever before. Despite the lack of open antagonists\
  \ on their borders, potential conflicts with repatriating Sarkorians, xenophobic\
  \ Irrisens, and those orcs not focused on the Whispering Tyrant's forces on their\
  \ southern border could all prove problematic for the migratory Mammoth Lord holdings.\
  \ After all, honor is everything and tempers can flare, and it just takes one spark\
  \ to start a fire that could set the entire plain ablaze.</p> \n      <div class=\"\
