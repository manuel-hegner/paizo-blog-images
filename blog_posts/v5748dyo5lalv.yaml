  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 4, 2009</p> \n   <p>One day, not so\
  \ long ago, a bright-eyed young expat freelancer was shaken from the idylls of his\
  \ honeymoon with the news that Paizo Publishing, in the far-off, fey-haunted Evergreen\
  \ State, had decided to add another lost soul to the depths of its editorial pit.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Knowing that such a summons could not go ignored for long, I immediately\
  \ made arrangements to return to my homeland, kissed my new wife goodbye, and boarded\
  \ a roc bound for Seattle. After a trying ordeal of canceled flights and missed\
  \ connections, a harrowing attack by a crag linnorm, and an unexpected stay in Vancouver,\
  \ I finally arrived on the cobbled streets of Redmond, ready for my first day in\
  \ the hallowed halls of Paizo Publishing.</p> \n   <p>Having previously dealt with\
  \ the famous Golem of Prague, I easily avoided the guardian golems at the gates,\
  \ and working my way past booby traps, false doors, and nightingale floors, successfully\
  \ infiltrated the sanctum sanctorum of editorial privilege. Rather than allow myself\
  \ to be ignominiously thrown in shackles into the editorial pit, I rappelled down\
  \ using braided ferret-fur rope (world-renowned for its flexibility and tensile\
  \ strength) and staked my claim in an unoccupied and strangely cube-like side cavern.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Sadly, all my precautions were in vain, as I soon discovered that most\
  \ of Paizo’s minions had apparently decided to make “Rob’s First Day on the Job”\
  \ a workshop holiday. No doubt they’re imposing some sort of quarantine on me to\
  \ avoid whatever virulent European plagues I brought with me. It’s been pretty quiet\
  \ so far… maybe <i>too</i> quiet. I can sense the grammar ghouls and style sphinxes\
  \ lurking in the darkness beyond my cave’s walls, waiting to vex me with riddles\
  \ of usage and voice when I least expect it. </p> \n   <p>But as the ghosts of forgotten\
  \ manuscripts and spectres of excess verbiage slain on the altar of editorial fiat\
  \ howl about me, I remain firm, resolute, and even optimistic. How many stat blocks\
  \ might I save from disgrace? How many guarded secrets can I pry from the clutching\
  \ fingers of jealous writers? How many fabulous treasures might I recover from the\
  \ depths of development hell?</p> \n   <p>Stay tuned, loyal readers, and I’ll do\
  \ my best to bring you all the wonders of Golarion and beyond that Paizo has to\
  \ offer. And not even the blue pencil-wielding troglodytes of punctuation will stop\
  \ me!</p> \n   <p>Rob McCreary <br>Assistant Editor</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
