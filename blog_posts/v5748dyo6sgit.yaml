  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I spent much of February traveling to different\
  \ conventions and leave again this weekend for a week of GAMA trade show fun! In\
  \ my absence, organized play lead developer John Compton took to the Paizo twitch\
  \ channel with Marketing Manager Dan Tharp for a discussion of upcoming bits and\
  \ bobs about the Paizo organized play programs, with the predominate focus on the\
  \ remaining storylines of Pathfinder Society Season Ten, the launch of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Year One, Starfinder Society Season One, and the Adventure Card Guild.\
  \ Without further ado, John's recap:</p> \n     <div style=\"margin: 12px 0;\">\n\
  \      <b>Twitch Stream Recap</b>\n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"\
  spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\"> \n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"\
  > \n       <p>\"I joined the <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/388799836?filter=archives&amp;sort=time\"\
  >Pathfinder Friday Twitch stream on March 1st</a> to discuss a range of organized\
  \ play topics. Here's a quick summary of some highlights from my notes. The surest\
  \ way to catch everything, though, is to check out the video through that link—\
  as well as upcoming streams on the channel, including Starfinder Wednesday, Pathfinder\
  \ Friday, Pathfinder version 2 live-play preview Oblivion Oath, and Pungeon Crawl\
  \ (a Starfinder live play GMed by Starfinder Society developer Thurston Hillman).</p>\
  \ \n       <h2>Adventure Card Guild</h2> \n       <p>There's a new core set coming\
  \ out in May, which streamlines the design of the original and adds updated rules\
  \ and art. Customizing the core set campaign specific add-on decks. The organized\
  \ play program is continuing through the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/acg\">Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</a>, with Linda Zayas-Palmer having taking the lead on Season 6 storyline\
  \ (set to launch at Gen Con). Between PaizoCon and Gen Con, we're releasing a handful\
  \ of scenarios to help show off this new set.</p> \n       <h2>Starfinder Society</h2>\
  \ \n       <p>There's a lot of great stuff coming up for <a href=\"/starfindersociety\"\
  >Starfinder Society</a>. We didn't get into Season 2, but we did discuss some of\
  \ the upcoming fun for the next several months, including ways in which several\
  \ of the Scoured Stars adventures interconnect. That includes <em>#1-34: Heart of\
  \ the Foe</em> and <em>#1-39: The Herald's War</em>, but especially the now announced\
  \ <em>Starfinder Society Special #2-00: Fate of the Scoured God</em> (Tier 1-12)\
  \ by Christopher Wasko.</p> \n       <p>Also, we noted that we're interested in\
  \ seeing more of those Second Seekers capstone boon emails! Y'know…for reasons.</p>\
  \ \n       <h2>Pathfinder Society—Season 10</h2> \n       <p>The focus for <a href=\"\
  /pathfindersociety/rpg\">Pathfinder Society</a> Season 10 discussions involved three\
  \ main adventures: the two-part seeker arc and the multi-table interactive special.\
  \ Collectively these are finales for the First Edition campaign.</p> \n       <p><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Special #10-98: Siege of Gallowspire</em> (Tier 5-16, by Brian Duckwitz)\
  \ covered a few big topics:</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li><b>Reduced Lethality:</b>\
  \ Early in its planning, this special was going to be pretty dang lethal, with players\
  \ bringing as many as five PCs each so that there would be replacements when a few\
  \ of them perished in the pursuit of Grand Heroism (earning it the joking name \"\
  The Grinder\"). Following a lot of concerned feedback, we revised the outline to\
  \ be on the challenging side without being highly lethal, stopped using the \"Grinder\"\
  \ term altogether, and are happy with how it's looking (still in the writing process).\
  \ You'll have a choice toward the end to choose a much tougher challenge or continue\
  \ at the current level of difficulty.</li> \n        <li><b>Spare PCs:</b> We've\
  \ also refined the way in which additional PCs contribute to the adventure. Each\
  \ player gets to bring one Reserve PC of the table's subtier or lower (so your reserve\
  \ could be level 8 or lower for a Subtier 7-8 group). If your main PC needs to tag\
  \ out between encounters, the Reserve PC can step in, but that's your only spare\
  \ adventurer; I neglected to note in the stream that if someone doesn't have a second\
  \ character to use as a Reserve, they can use an appropriate pregenerated character.\
  \ You'll also be able to bring up to three Aid PCs of level 5+, who are there to\
  \ perform background tasks that help the table—think of their impact being similar\
  \ to previous specials' aid tokens, plus some other narrative impacts.</li> \n \
  \      </ul> \n       <p><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-22: Passing the Torch,\
  \ Part 1: Who Wears the Mask</em> (by Cole Kronewitter) and <em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #10-23: Passing the Torch, Part 2: Who Speaks for the Ten</em> (by John\
  \ Compton) are the last two scenarios for the campaign, which we're publishing in\
  \ June and July. After working out the details with Cole, we decided that it would\
  \ be great for event higher-level PCs to have a last hurrah, and we're making these\
  \ three-subtier scenarios at Tier 12-18 (Subtiers 12-13, 14-15, and 17-18). Expect\
  \ to see some great Decemvirate themes, and if you enjoyed the Eyes of the Ten story,\
  \ you'll no doubt enjoy Passing the Torch.</p> \n       <h2>Pathfinder Society—\
  Second Edition</h2> \n       <p>We're finalizing more details every week, with our\
  \ most recent work having been on factions. During the stream we discussed scenario\
  \ tiers (expect tiers like those in Starfinder Society), Gen Con adventures, and\
  \ quests. At Gen Con, expect to see the following:</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li>One\
  \ 5th-level pregenerated character special, much in the spirit of <em><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Special-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  >Claim to Salvation</a></em></li> \n        <li>Three Tier 1-4 scenarios, the first\
  \ of which will be replayable</li> \n        <li>One Tier 1-4 quest that serves\
  \ as a great demo for Pathfinder Society play</li> \n       </ul> \n       <p>On\
  \ the quests front, we're also really excited to see these added to the monthly\
  \ publication schedule. One of our big goals for the Second Edition campaign remains\
  \ ensuring that stand-alone quests are not only published regularly, but also that\
  \ they grant standard rewards like XP, gold, Fame, and the like. We're excited to\
  \ be publishing two scenarios per month plus a quest per month, and we're very interested\
  \ in hearing about these quests once they're out in the wild. In addition to their\
  \ representing more playable content and greater versatility sitting down to play,\
  \ these are also really nice in terms of testing out new authors and bringing more\
  \ voices into adventure writing.</p> \n       <p>Anyway, I have no doubt I've missed\
  \ something, so I again encourage you to listen to the stream and let us know if\
  \ you'd like to see more organized play content on Paizo's Twitch stream.\"</p>\
  \ \n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n     <p>We distributed\
  \ no campaign coins in February, partly due to lack of recommendations. The organized\
  \ play team cannot be everywhere, and we rely on recommendations from community\
  \ members regarding who receives coins. Anyone can make a recommendation, not just\
  \ the venture-officer or GM teams. Please take a moment and email me at <u><a href=\"\
  mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a></u> with their name,\
  \ location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized for their service.\
  \ It doesn't need to be a long, involved email, just a synopsis of what the volunteer\
  \ does to make your community go. If you are able, please include what events they\
  \ may attend in 2019 so that we can either make awards in person (preferred) or\
  \ make arrangements for remote presentation.</p> \n     <h2>Stars</h2> \n     <p>As\
  \ we start 2019 convention season in earnest, please join me in three cheers for\
  \ the GMs who utilized the winter months to qualify for their 5th star. To achieve\
  \ this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative\
  \ estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below,\
  \ thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society\
  \ games! Huge congratulations on your achievement!</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Walter\
  \ Wooten</li> \n      <li>James Kight</li> \n      <li>Guy Caley</li> \n     </ul>\

  \ a convention. At a minimum, the convention should supply room(s) and badges. The\
  \ more costs a convention can cover, the easier it is to get a convention on the\
  \ schedule. Please note - staff do not attend conventions the last weekend in May\
