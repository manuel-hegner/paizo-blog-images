  \   <h1>Pathfinder Society Overview for Gen Con</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday,\
  \ July 9, 2012</p> \n    <p>This year's <a href=\"http://gencon.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Gen Con</a> will be the most ambitious for <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> yet. With Gen Con being the largest gaming convention in\
  \ North America, I thought of how I could make Pathfinder Society bigger and better\
  \ than it has ever been, while improving the quality for our players. So, I wanted\
  \ to give an overview of what to expect from Pathfinder Society if you are attending\
  \ Gen Con this year.</p> \n    <p>Last year, we ran 50 tables of Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenarios per slot. We sold out almost all tickets within the first week of ticket\
  \ sales going live, so I knew I wanted to expand our play opportunities. In 2011,\
  \ we had four rooms attached with the walls open to create one large Pathfinder\
  \ Society gaming hall. It was fairly crowded with so many tables in that one area,\
  \ so we requested and received seven rooms this year. Having almost doubled the\
  \ size of the gaming hall, I wanted to expand the number of tables but also increase\
  \ the amount of room between tables, as I know this was a suggestion from last year\
  \ made by numerous players and GMs. So, I only added 50 percent more tables this\
  \ year, expanding the Pathfinder Society gaming hall to 75 tables per slot.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Another piece of good feedback we received was that with the Pathfinder\
  \ Society HQ set up against one wall, the people on the other end of the gaming\
  \ hall had a difficult time interacting with HQ. With this year's hall having almost\
  \ double the size, I wanted to change things up a bit to make it easier for both\
  \ GMs and players to interact with HQ. Therefore, we are making a larger Pathfinder\
  \ Society HQ and placing it in the center of the gaming hall. In addition, I have\
  \ assigned 8â€“10 volunteers per gaming slot to work solely in Pathfinder Society\
  \ HQ to help facilitate administrative tasks more quickly, including getting data\
  \ entry of tracking sheets completed while at the con. This will also help us to\
  \ correct any errors that come up on site as opposed to weeks later after the show.\
  \ The volunteers will also serve to muster GMs and players to tables, facilitate\
  \ the prize table, and various other tasks.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n\

  \ </div> \n    <p>We will also be introducing <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/scenarios/season4\"\
  >Season 4</a> of the Pathfinder Society to all of you. The new <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Guide to Organized Play</a> (which will be the focus of a blog\
  \ post in a few weeks) will go live, and I think many of you will appreciate the\
  \ new rules changes and tweaks. We will still have some favorite scenarios from\
  \ Season 3, as well as the final four <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/scenarios/season3\"\
  >Season 3</a> scenarios that were launched at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>.\
  \ But we will also be debuting the Year of the Risen Rune with four brand-new scenarios\
  \ to help kick off Season 4. In total, we will have 18 different scenarios for players\
  \ to choose from. </p> \n    <p>In addition, we will have the largest Gen Con Special\
  \ to date, seating 450 players to complete the adventure as a group, similar to\
  \ the Year of the Shadow Lodge and Blood Under Absalom from the last two Gen Cons.\
  \ This year, we have added to the Special and created a competitive, exclusive second\
  \ round of play that will only be available at Gen Con 2012. The top three tables\
  \ from each tier will advance to the second round by utilizing a secret scoring\
  \ system. I have hand selected only four- and five-star GMs to judge these tables,\
  \ with many of them being current or former Venture-Captains. We may also have a\
  \ celebrity GM or two to add to the mix. Every table that advances to the second\
  \ round will receive a better Chronicle sheet than that which was received in the\
  \ first round and awarded to all players. The top table from each tier in the second\
  \ round will receive a unique Chronicle sheet awarding a very special, one-of-a-kind\
  \ prize that will only be available at Gen Con. </p> \n    <p>Don't worry if you\
  \ miss out on those two Chronicles. We will also have 18 new Pathfinder Society\
  \ convention Chronicles available to win. This year, for every two events you play\
  \ in, you will win something, whether it be a special Pathfinder Society boon or\
  \ a Pathfinder product.</p> \n    <p>In addition to all of the above, we are launching\
  \ three new events this year for Gen Con 2012. We are adding the Kid's Track, the\
  \ <a href=\"/beginnerbox\">Beginner Box</a> Introductions, and the GM 101 workshops.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For the Kid's Track, we have set aside two tables for the morning and\
  \ afternoon slots that are for children attending Gen Con, offering them a chance\
  \ to play the Beginner Box Intro adventures with other children their age. These\
  \ slots are 2 hours each and will be run four times each day at each of the two\
  \ tables. A different adventure will be run each day of Gen Con, and any child who\
  \ completes all four will receive a special certificate denoting his or her achievements.\
  \ In addition, we will be providing pregenerated characters, as well as the corresponding\
  \ miniature from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52\">Beginner Box Heroes</a> miniature\
  \ pack, for the child to keep. If the child plays all four adventures with a different\
  \ pregen, she can walk away with the full set. We will also be providing parents\
  \ a coupon for 10% off the purchase of the <a href=\"/beginnerbox\">Beginner Box</a>\
  \ while at the show. Finally, we will be providing each child a set of dice to keep.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For the Beginner Box Introductions, I decided to make this a 5-hour,\
  \ paid slot this year. The first hour will have the GM explaining the basic rules\
  \ of the game, reviewing the pregenerated characters, and answering any questions.\
  \ The final 4 hours of the slot will allow the players to play through all four\
  \ of the Beginner Box Intro adventures that were used for the Beginner Box Bash\
  \ last October.</p> \n    <p>The GM 101 workshops were launched at PaizoCon for\
  \ their final test run and will be making their official debut at Gen Con. The workshops\
  \ were developed by the Georgia regional coordinators, and then over the past 6\
  \ months, with the help of several awesome Venture-Captains across North America,\
  \ we tested various ideas for GM 101 classes in their regions. We took those ideas,\
  \ formulated the best ones into a grouping, and drafted up solid guidelines for\
  \ what we are calling the GM 101 workshops. As they are 5 hours long, and knowing\
  \ your time is valuable at Gen Con, we broke the program into two parts. The first\
  \ part, which will run for 2 hours, is titled Pathfinder GM Basics. This introductory\
  \ program focuses on improving GMing skills, handling challenges, and giving a great\
  \ table experience. Part 1 includes four breakout sessions covering Roleplaying\
  \ and Lore, Combat and Rules, Running the Game, and Advanced Topics. Part 2 is titled\
  \ Practice Makes Perfect. Part 2 of this program introduces the Deck of Many Situations,\
  \ a tool to help GMs focus on improving their improvisational technique while applying\
  \ the lessons learned in Part 1. Participants draw cards that detail difficult GMing\
  \ situations, and have a brief period to resolve their respective situations before\
  \ time is called. Our experienced GMs offer advice and techniques based on observation\
  \ of your GMing style tailored to help you sharpen your skills and improve your\
  \ expertise.</p> \n    <p>Finally, for those not familiar with Pathfinder Society,\
  \ we will be hosting two Pathfinder Society Q&amp;A sessions on Thursday and Saturday\
  \ morning. We hope that any player who has wanted to try out Pathfinder Society\
  \ but hasn't for whatever reason, will come to one of these seminars, ask any questions\
  \ he or she might have, and then try out Pathfinder Society sometime during the\
  \ course of the convention.</p> \n    <p>With just over a month away, I am excited\
  \ about my first Gen Con as Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator. I have tried\
  \ to put together the best possible programming for all of you and hope to make\
  \ this your best Pathfinder Society experience to date. There are still tickets\
  \ available for most scenarios, but those numbers will continue to rapidly decrease\
  \ the closer we get to the show. If you haven't purchased your event tickets yet,\
  \ head over to the Gen Con event registration site to do so. You don't want to miss\
  \ out on all the new and exciting things we have planned for Pathfinder Society\
  \ at Gen Con 2012.</p> \n    <p>See you in August!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Campaign Coordinator</i> </p>\n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Gen Con, Pathfinder\
