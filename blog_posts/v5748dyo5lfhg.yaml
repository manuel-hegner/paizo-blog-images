  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>My adolescent comic book dollar was not\
  \ well spent. </p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Growing up, we were terminally\
  \ out of milk, meaning the circuit for any errand inevitably included a trip to\
  \ the local convenience store. As much as my brother and I enjoyed the opportunities\
  \ any store presented for squirming and line standing, my mother usually preferred\
  \ to let her hellions run flailing to the nearby comic shop.</span></p> \n    <p>The\
  \ baleful Comic Keeper had little patience for tweens in his store, and certainly\
  \ not among the titles kept in mushy white-brown boxes on and under the store's\
  \ mismatched folding tables. Rather, I was directed to a metal rack crammed in a\
  \ back corner, one that displayed titles united by the Archie Comics logo: <i>Archie\
  \ &amp; Friends</i>, <i>Jughead's Time Police</i>, <i>Koosh Kins</i>, <i>The Wild\
  \ West Cowboys of Moo Mesa</i>, and the like. I can't say I was terribly discerning\
  \ at the time, but I certainly didn't scoff at what direction I received—the two\
  \ dollar price stickers also went a long way to pique my interest (I was trying\
  \ to make ends meet with a five dollar a week allowance after all). So I got in\
  \ the habit of picking up the best from this collection, something I was familiar\
  \ with both from television and mangled piles of action figures: <i>Teenage Mutant\
  \ Ninja Turtles Adventures</i>.</p> \n    <p>To clarify, these were not the Mirage\
  \ Studios, 1980s, Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Rather, these\
  \ were the the gritless and never grim, pizza loving, cowabunga crowing interpretations\
  \ of Saturday morning cartoons, Nintendo classics, and KB Toys. I checked for the\
  \ new monthly issue probably twice a week, and poured tens of dollars into that\
  \ store over months and months, not resting until my 10 volume back issue collection\
  \ was complete.</p> \n    <p>Eventually, though, the system failed. One day, unsuspectingly,\
  \ I went into the comic shop planning to leave with something garishly colored,\
  \ but instead got into the back of my Mom's van with pages of black and white. I\
  \ don't remember why I picked up one of the Eastman and Laird volumes—maybe I just\
  \ had fresh allowance burning a hole in my pocket, maybe I was more curious than\
  \ I remember. Regardless, in this volume Raphael was dead (I think it was him, I\
  \ was thoroughly confused on how to tell the turtles apart in black and white),\
  \ being tormented through some horrible spire-filled afterlife by a foul-mouthed\
  \ bone faced vulture.</p> \n    <p>This was not my comic. It also certainly wasn't\
  \ from the cartoon. I was even fairly sure it wasn't the plot of the recently released\
  \ TMNT movie. This couldn't have been from anywhere else, so what the devil was\
  \ this?</p> \n    <p>That answer was something of a revelation. It was it's own\
  \ thing—something that would never fly in any other format. These comics could tell\
  \ stories other mediums couldn't. They could be visually bold and expressive beyond\
  \ novels, but also mature and experimental in ways film and animation (that I was\
  \ aware of at the time) couldn't be. Comics were different, and had unique tricks\
  \ and potential. It wasn't a realization I expected for my $1.99, but it's stuck\
  \ with me in the few years since 1990.</p> \n    <p>When the opportunity came around\
  \ for Erik, Sutter, and I to contribute stories to <i>Pathfinder: Goblins</i>, I\
  \ knew I wanted to tell a story I couldn't with a Pathfinder adventure or in a piece\
  \ of fiction. It had to be a goblin story, but it couldn't just be goblins being\
  \ quirky and fail-ready, it had to use the medium. That's where my story's main\
  \ character got the personality trait that would land him in so much trouble, because\
  \ Xoff—that's my gob—is a total liar. </p> \n    <p>In <a href=\"/products/btpy915e?Pathfinder-Goblins-4\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder: Goblins! #4</i></a>, along with Jeremy Holt's awesome tale \"The\
  \ Gobbling Goblin,\" you'll find \"Horsechopper,\" a dual account of Xoff's encounter\
  \ with the Lost Coast's most infamous inhabitant, none other than the Sandpoint\
  \ Devil. I say \"dual account\" because Xoff's narration recounts his grand battle,\
  \ while Jainai Jeffries's brilliant illustrations depict a somewhat less flattering\
  \ reality. It's a creepy encounter about a goblin, a dashing hat, and—of course—\
  one trusty horsechopper. I won't give away the ending, but things get messy and\
  \ along the way a frog almost gets gobbled. Writing this, now I really wish I'd\
  \ made that frog a turtle.</p> \n    <p><i>Pathfinder: Goblins! #4</i> is on sale\
  \ now, a creepy pair of tales to share along with your other Autumn ghost stories,\
  \ and one that backs up your Pathfinder game with an appendix including stats for\
  \ our \"hero\" Xoff and details on a distinctly goblin haunted house. Order it here,\
  \ or hunt it down at your local comic shop now! </p> \n    <p>Just remember, it's\
  \ the one with the hairless green ruffians who <i>aren't</i> ninjas.</p> \n    <p>F.\
