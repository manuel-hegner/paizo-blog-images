  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>The Seventh Execution</h1> \n   <p>by Amber\
  \ E. Scott</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: The Faithful False</h2> \n   <p>We retreated\
  \ into a network of side streets where we could escape if necessary and where we'd\
  \ easily hear anyone approaching. The night was cool enough to frost our breath.\
  \ The smell of refuse lingered beneath the familiar city smells of dirt, sweat,\
  \ horse dung, and boiled potatoes.</p> \n   <p>When I thought us safe, I turned\
  \ and held up a hand. “Speak quickly.”</p> \n   <p>“First let's make certain I have\
  \ the right person. You are Tibeth, servant at Mirford Manor?”</p> \n   <p>I nodded,\
  \ never taking my eyes from the man's face. A muscle in my calf twitched, as if\
  \ reminding me that flight was still an option.</p> \n   <p>“My name is Bradach,”\
  \ he said. “I have traveled many miles and followed convoluted divinations to find\
  \ Mirford Manor, and you.” He lowered his voice further. “I am on a mission, a dangerous\
  \ one, involving the house at which you work. I had hoped—”</p> \n   <p>I held up\
  \ my hand again. “Before you speak further, you should know that whatever this mission\
  \ is and however far you've come, you have the wrong person if you think I would\
  \ do anything to betray my master. He is a good and patriotic man. I would sooner\
  \ go straight to him with all you've said and risk punishment than be involved in\
  \ a plot against him.”</p> \n   <p> Bradach raised an eyebrow. “Your devotion is\
  \ admirable, and unexpected. Are you not a slave?”</p> \n   <p>My shoulders lifted\
  \ and brow furrowed as I took a deep breath. “Servant, if you please. My family\
  \ has willingly served the Mirford family for three generations. My master appreciates\
  \ the qualities we bring to his household. In my youth, I was educated and trained\
  \ in many skills beyond a simple kitchen slave's abilities. So you see, I have no\
  \ wish to betray the man who has been so kind to me.”</p> \n   <p>“I do see.” Bradach\
  \ rubbed his chin. “Yet I must ask, do you know what role your master serves in\
  \ the city?”</p> \n   <p>“He is a member of the Revolutionary Council,” I said.\
  \ “Everyone knows as much. He assists the city in protecting itself and works to\
  \ uncover those who would harm us.”</p> \n   <p>“Those who would harm you.” There\
  \ was no question or malice in Bradach's voice, but I took offense nonetheless.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“Traitors. Sympathizers. Rats that gnaw at the foundation of Galt. My\
  \ master finds them and has them executed.”</p> \n   <p>“And every executed person\
  \ is guilty?”</p> \n   <p>“Y-yes. Of course, yes.”</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \  <br> \"Bradach would undermine the very heart of the Revolution.\"\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>“Not a convincing reply.” Bradach's voice was smooth and even, almost\
  \ gentle. “You're certain only the guilty lie with Razor Jenni?”</p> \n   <p>“What\
  \ do you want with me?” I spoke too loudly and cupped my hand over my mouth, hushing\
  \ myself.</p> \n   <p>Bradach glanced over his shoulder to ensure we were still\
  \ alone. “I come from the River Kingdoms. I had expected to find a slave, ill-treated,\
  \ who would sympathize with my cause. My case may now be harder to make.”</p> \n\
  \   <p>“What,” I repeated, “do you want with me?”</p> \n   <p>“The River Kingdoms\
  \ are free, and I wish to spread their message across the land.” Bradach spoke as\
  \ if he hadn't heard me. “I have my own reasons for wanting to start here. I have\
  \ researched a spell—it's untested, but I believe it will help release many innocent\
  \ souls.”</p> \n   <p>“What is this spell?”</p> \n   <p>“If you're not willing to\
  \ help, I'm not sure I should tell you.”</p> \n   <p>“If you won't tell me, I don't\
  \ know if I'm willing to help.”</p> \n   <p>Bradach studied me. I flushed. My quick\
  \ retort had shown my hand. I was entertaining the idea of helping him, or at least\
  \ not hindering him. If only he hadn't asked are you certain...</p> \n   <p>It was\
  \ her or me!</p> \n   <p>“The spell,” he finally said, “should release the spirits\
  \ trapped in Razor Jenni. Though those executed will remain dead, their souls will\
  \ be freed to travel on to whatever reward or punishment they merit.”</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ drew in a sharp breath. The great terror of a final blade is not that it is an\
  \ instrument of death. As the condemned marches up the wooden steps to where the\
  \ weighty frame holds its razor edge aloft, his fear comes from the knowledge that\
  \ there is nothing for him after death. His soul will remain trapped in that bloody\
  \ blade. It is this fear, my master says, that deters so many from considering or\
  \ attempting treason.</p> \n   <p>Then why do so many die? I wanted to ask. If it\
  \ deters them, then why do so many die? But I dared not ask. Those who ask make\
  \ that grim march themselves.</p> \n   <p>“Free their souls...” I whispered.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“Yes.” Bradach's voice grew eager, almost desperate. “To remain trapped\
  \ forever in that horrible device—I cannot even find words to describe it. Some\
  \ of those spirits may be guilty, yes, but they were people, people with families,\
  \ friends... lovers...” He struggled to maintain his composure. “I am here to test\
  \ the spell. If it works, I will use it to free all such imprisoned. Will you help?”\
  </p> \n   <p>“What do you need me to do?” I asked. </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗ ∗ ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>He needed me to betray my master.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Chores always filled my days, and I worked as hard as I could to distract\
  \ myself from Bradach's proposal. That afternoon I stood in the manor's kitchen,\
  \ trying to find comfort in the crackling fire. I had not committed myself to Bradach's\
  \ mission yet, but had asked for time to think about it. Now I wished I had given\
  \ him either a firm yes or no; the internal debate that kept surfacing in my mind\
  \ wore me out more quickly than washing windows.</p> \n   <p>It seemed simple to\
  \ say no, easy to say no, right to say no. The moment I fixed it in my mind that\
  \ I would say no, though, Bradach's question resurfaced: Are you certain they were\
  \ all guilty?</p> \n   <p>Then I would think of her, and my thoughts would fly apart\
  \ again.</p> \n   <p>More than two seasons had passed with no arrests or investigations\
  \ led by my master. Panic had grown within me. “Those without use to the nation\
  \ are the first fingered as traitors,” my father always said, and my master had\
  \ many enemies.</p> \n   <p>She had arrived in the city the previous week, a human\
  \ woman traveling alone. I found no relatives of hers in Edme. I followed her. She\
  \ visited unsavory elements in town, asking questions about noble families executed\
  \ during the start of the Revolution. One night I observed her prowling around the\
  \ ruins of an old manor house. She uncovered a book, one of the family ledgers in\
  \ which the nobles recorded births, weddings, and deaths. </p> \n   <p>Eager to\
  \ present my master with someone, I turned her in without further investigation.\
  \ She was obviously looking for a tie to her family, seeking to prove her noble\
  \ lineage. The decadent nobility had condemned Galt to years of oppression under\
  \ imperial rule. To willingly seek out a connection to them was indefensible.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She tried to defend herself. She claimed to be the child not of the noble\
  \ family, but of the servants who had worked in the manor and had helped overthrow\
  \ their masters. Her parents, she claimed, were commoners lost in the Revolution,\
  \ and she was searching for relatives who might have survived. Others had tried\
  \ such stories before, but she spoke so clearly, so simply, that I believed her.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Or did I? I gasped as I sliced the kitchen knife slid off the carrots\
  \ and over my finger. Blood pooled on the chopping block. I had no proof of her\
  \ innocence, but her calmness and certainty in the face of her accusers had caught\
  \ in my memory.</p> \n   <p>When she mounted the steps for her final meeting with\
  \ Razor Jenni, I told myself it was her or me.</p> \n   <p>“Are you all right?”\
  </p> \n   <p>I squeaked and spun around. The master stood there, looking at me with\
  \ concern. He had changed out of his work clothes and into a simple navy robe and\
  \ slippers. A wooden medallion displaying the flag of Galt hung from his neck. Though\
  \ I remained young even after my many years of service, he showed signs of age.\
  \ His face displayed new lines every year, and gray streaked his hair.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>“It's nothing, sir,” I said. I wrapped my finger in a handkerchief. “A bit\
  \ of carelessness on my part.”</p> \n   <p>“Be careful with yourself. I can't afford\
  \ to lose my best servant.” He smiled down on me and I nodded. “I'll be leaving\
  \ in the morning for Isarn. Can you have my things packed and brought down before\
  \ I retire?”</p> \n   <p>“Yes, sir.” I swallowed. “That's earlier than usual. Is\
  \ anything wrong?”</p> \n   <p>He raised an eyebrow. “A simple schedule accommodation.\
  \ Should I be concerned about something?”</p> \n   <p>My mouth was dry. I had to\
  \ swallow again. “The execution last month... I hope my evidence was sound enough.\
  \ Those who seek your position might try to discredit you by casting doubt on my\
  \ findings.”</p> \n   <p>We had never talked so openly about my work before. Always\
  \ I reported my investigations to him, clearly and concisely, but said nothing about\
  \ my motivations, or his. The master crouched down and put a hand on my shoulder.\
  \ It covered my arm halfway to my elbow.</p> \n   <p>“Tibeth, there is nothing for\
  \ you to worry about. Your findings were sound, and had they not been, I would have\
  \ found ways to compensate.” He squeezed my shoulder lightly. “You continue to find\
  \ suitable targets and I will ensure there's suitable evidence. I rely on you, you\
  \ know. You keep both my position and Galt safe.”</p> \n   <p>My head spun. I thought\
  \ for a moment I might faint. I forced myself to relax and smoothed the expression\
  \ from my face. “Yes, sir. I understand.”</p> \n   <p>He left me standing next to\
  \ the bloody carrots. I slumped against the counter until the dizziness passed.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>For his spell, Bradach needed a bit of heartwood from the tree that\
  \ died to make Razor Jenni's frame. My master wore a bit of that wood around his\
  \ neck. I never saw him without it.</p> \n   <p>I went upstairs to my attic room\
  \ and laid a handkerchief over the sill as if to dry it, a sign Bradach and I had\
  \ arranged last night. The wizard would see it and know to meet me in the university\
  \ quadrangle at midnight. There I would give him the medallion and help set the\
  \ souls in Razor Jenni free. </p>\n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗ ∗ ∗\n   </center>\n\
  \   <p></p> \n   <p>I stood at the foot of the stairs leading up to my master's\
  \ room, summoning the courage to take the first step.</p> \n   <p>In my service\
  \ to my master, and to Galt, I had followed traitors and seditionists through dark\
  \ and abandoned streets. I had unlocked windows and searched people's houses for\
  \ evidence. Once, I had even been forced to fight for my life when I encountered\
  \ a looter in the building I'd come to search. Still, I had never felt the nervous\
  \ dread I felt now as I looked up that shadowed staircase.</p> \n   <p>When I could\
  \ bear the tension no longer I took the first tentative step. It was easy to make\
  \ my way silently up the stairs; I knew the creaky boards by heart.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ reached my master's door and stopped. My pulse thrummed in my ears. The door latch\
  \ stood at shoulder height to me, and I could peer easily through the keyhole. I\
  \ saw only darkness and heard the even breaths of my master as he slept. When I\
  \ lifted my hands to the lock, the muscles in my fingers twitched as if rebelling\
  \ against the act. </p> \n   <p>I knew of a trap on the door, a simple spring-loaded\
  \ needle coated in a toxic substance. My master left the trap unset during the day,\
  \ when I might need to enter his room, and set it every night before sleep. I lit\
  \ a candle and worked carefully by its meager light. I had seen traps like this\
  \ before and cautiously traced my way down to the triggering wire. I snipped the\
  \ wire in half with a tiny blade. I carried the rest of my tools as well as a small\
  \ dagger, though I could never attack my master. The tumblers in the lock gave me\
  \ more trouble than the trap did, and it was several minutes before I finally turned\
  \ the last one over. I blew out the candle and eased the door open.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ familiar objects of the room seemed sinister in the moonlight. The bed, with my\
  \ master slumbering quietly beneath the quilts, sat in one corner of the room. Four\
  \ wooden posts, each one twice as tall as I, held up the bedframe. I saw the medallion\
  \ hanging from its leather strap on the post flush in the corner.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ padded to the side of the bed. My master did not stir. Chill sweat covered my\
  \ body and made me shiver. I rested my hands on the quilt and, with precise movements,\
  \ pressed down until I had the leverage to pull myself onto the bed.</p> \n   <p>My\
  \ weight was so little that I barely made a dent in the mattress. Still, I waited\
  \ until I was certain that my master slept soundly before I rose. My shoeless feet\
  \ found it easy to keep purchase on the lumpy surface. I took slow and shallow breaths\
  \ between each step, straining to hear any whisper or rustle to signal my master's\
  \ wakening. I stopped next to the pillows. My master's head rested inches away.\
  \ He lay on his back, looking untroubled in sleep. Guilt stabbed through me. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Before I could change my mind, I placed one hand on the wall to steady\
  \ myself and reached with the other. I stretched to my limit until I could grab\
  \ the medallion with one swift clutch.</p> \n   <p>It seemed as though a thousand\
  \ bees stung my palm at once. I howled and fell backward onto the bed. The amulet\
  \ flew from my grasp. My master woke instantly, bellowing and thrashing in the bedclothes.\
  \ I rolled off the bed and hit the floor with a gasp, the wind knocked out of me.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I felt a peculiar pang of betrayal. My master had not told me he kept\
  \ his medallion warded.</p> \n   <p>A foot crashed down next to my head. I rolled\
  \ away, sucking in breath as my lungs began to work again. I scrabbled madly on\
  \ the floor for the medallion. There wasn't much light but I remembered the sound\
  \ of the medallion landing and followed my instincts.</p> \n   <p>“Tibeth!” my master\
  \ shouted. “Tibeth!” It wasn't until afterward that I realized he was probably shouting\
  \ for me to come, not yet recognizing the thief on the ground before him. I heard\
  \ him draw a blade from a scabbard. My hand closed over the smooth wood of the medallion.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>There was no shock this time. I scrambled to my feet. A sword blade came\
  \ slicing down. I threw myself to the side. The sword bit into the wooden floor\
  \ and spat splinters at me. I spun around, disoriented, trying to find the door.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>My master raised the sword again and paused, holding the blade aloft.\
  \ “Tibeth?”</p> \n   <p>I ran out the door and down the stairs, into the night,\
  \ holding the medallion before me like a shield.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
