  description\">Despite waking from the nightmare of what sounded like a tough but\
  \ exciting marathon session, the Order of the Amber Die folks bring up a report\
  \ from their experience with the third adventure in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9pmo\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #111: Dreams of the Yellow King</em></a>. This adventure promised\
  \ to bring the weird and surreal into the campaign, and from what I've heard from\
  \ the Order of the Amber Die, it succeeded.</p> \n     <p>What follows is their\
  \ brief report. As always, proceed with caution, as spoilers abound.</p> \n    \
  \ <blockquote> \n      <p>So far in The Strange Aeons Experiment we've been stumbling\
  \ through the horror with the naivety you'd expect from four players who are Lovecraft-ignorant.\
  \ <em>Dreams of the Yellow King</em> would be no different, and we were determined\
  \ to fully immerse ourselves for our rookie excursion into the dimension of dreams.\
  \ We blacked out our walls with floor-to-ceiling panels, dialed up a soundtrack\
  \ that included plenty of psychedelic trance, and even passed around a miniature\
  \ staircase just as our characters did for each Dreamlands occult ritual. For the\
  \ real-world ride on the Sellen River, we created 3-D boats from Rob Lazarretti's\
  \ maps, with one member managing to create a fully functional sail for the <em>Sellen\
  \ Starling</em>. Lastly, for the massive amount of research that we'd be performing\
  \ in this adventure, we borrowed a collection of antique books and piled it around\
  \ our play area.</p> \n      <p>This marathon was unique, because joining us at\
  \ the table for the three-month voyage to Cassomir was a special guest: Paizo former\
  \ intern, author, and editor <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldj9\">Savannah Broadway</a>\
  \ flew from Seattle to New Jersey to take on the role of NPC Winter Klaczka. Savannah\
  \ bunked in the command center of the Order, a room we call \"The Lair,\" and it\
  \ was an honor to game alongside her. We clocked 60 session hours, and even had\
  \ Savannah with us for the longest day of the AP: a nearly 20-hour run. Her <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/purplegnomling\" target=\"_blank\">live tweets</a> kept us laughing\
  \ throughout the marathon and helped present the experience for our fans. Not only\
  \ will we miss Savannah's perfect accent for Winter, but she did something unprecedented\
  \ by naming our first party after an NPC: Winter's Wolves! We were also very grateful\
  \ to add the talents of an Order member (a Boston NBA and NHL cameraman) to help\
  \ us best capture the occasion.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <h2>Highlights from Dreams of the Yellow King</h2>\
  \ \n      <ul>\n       <li>We tried nearly everything we could to cure Quinn of\
  \ the ghoul corruption he picked up during <em>In Search of Sanity</em>. Horrible\
  \ as it may seem, isolating a manacled Quinn in a barn for a week actually worked.\
  \ You can imagine his face during this adventure when we discovered a race of ghouls\
  \ even more powerful and intelligent than any we knew existed: Leng ghouls.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Powerful treasure was as abundant as danger in the Dreamlands. We\
  \ came across our first <i>vorpal</i> blade since 6th grade in '89. And yes, we\
  \ took off some heads.</li> \n       <li>Dying in the Dreamlands had its price:\
  \ madness. While we managed to cure some of them along the way, by the end of our\
  \ trip we had acquired nearly every lesser and greater madness listed in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a>. Trying to roleplay these over\
  \ the course of a weekend spent in the same room was a challenge that certainly\
  \ pushed the envelope of immersion.</li> \n       <li>We attended a grand ball in\
  \ a city called Celephais, where guests were routinely murdered every few minutes.\
  \ Only Feiya stayed for \"The Sunset Waltz,\" where the viscount danced with a Leng\
  \ spider to Shostakovich's \"Waltz No. 2.\" Creepy on so many levels.</li> \n  \
  \     <li>While in the Dreamlands, we were surprised to face a dragon—a nightmare\
  \ dragon. Our GM slammed the mini down on the table like we were back in Stranger\
  \ Things, then woke us with a TPK.</li>\n      </ul> \n      <h2>The Experiment</h2>\
  \ \n      <ul>\n       <li>This AP doesn't feel like our other Pathfinder campaigns.\
  \ Others have had highs and lows, but this one just has us run down, freaked out,\
  \ and anxious. We can't help but wonder if this is what Call of Cthulhu is like.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>The monsters just keep getting scarier. An indescribable creature,\
  \ known only as a formless spawn, massacred us in our dreams with what our GM called\
  \ \"a masterpiece of a stat block.\" At least we got to use our <a href=\"/products/btpy8oxq\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Map Pack: Swallowed Whole</em></a> as it sucked us down one by one.</li>\n\

  \ we botched the Dreamlands occult ritual and allowed an animate dream to follow\
  \ us out into the real world. It took down Alahazra with a phantasmal killer, and\
  \ the fight spilled out onto the deck of the <em>Sellen Starling</em>. Skywin Freeling,\
  \ the ship's captain, came to our aid, but was put to sleep forever with a crit\
  \ from the Amber Die. The room was silent when it was over.</p> \n      <h2>Best\
  \ Quote from Marathon 3</h2> \n      <p><i>Quinn</i>: \"Let's assess, it's been\
  \ a few minutes: Two of us are blind, one can't speak, and Feiya was already ripped\
  \ out of this dream.\"<br> <i>Winter</i>: \"Can we leave zis place? I do not like\
  \ zis place!\"</p> \n      <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>We reached Cassomir,\
  \ but with the <em>Sellen Starling</em> whittled down to a skeleton crew and our\
  \ party riddled with madnesses, we'll be spending a couple of months to recover.\
  \ After that, we're headed off again in pursuit of Count Lowls!</p> \n      <h2>More\

  \ well-known Sihedron medallion.</i> \n      </div> \n      <h2>A Tough Goodbye</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>We wanted to take a moment to say some words about a recent event that\
  \ has deeply touched all of us here at Order of the Amber Die. This past weekend,\
  \ the Order lost one of its most respected and admired members to a hard battle\
  \ against cancer. Mike Dappolone had been with us since 7th grade in 1990, and was\
  \ one of the earliest members of the group. As kids, Mike showed us how to secretly\
  \ pack our D&amp;D books and dice in our backpacks during Boy Scout trips so we\
  \ could play in the tent at night. In college, Mike was pivotal in helping to launch\
  \ our organized \"marathon\" method of gaming, so that when we were all together\
  \ twice a year we could put away an entire module in a sitting. In our adult years,\
  \ Mike created many of the intricate set pieces that can be seen in our playthroughs\
  \ (including the fully functional sails on the boats here), and his painted miniatures\
  \ have always been featured heavily in our game. Throughout his recent struggle,\
  \ Mike loved the days that he could escape into long Pathfinder sessions, starring\
  \ as Seltyiel in our Runelords campaign—even brazenly wearing a Sihedron medallion.\
  \ This fall he spent some peaceful time introducing his young son to the joys of\
  \ the game. Mike's seat cannot be filled, but the Order and \"Seltyiel's Seven\"\
  \ will continue on in his name.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>I want to give\
  \ my heartfelt sympathies to the crew of the Order of the Amber Die and to Mike's\
  \ friends and family. It's never easy to lose someone.</p> \n     <p>The crew of\
  \ adventurers in this Strange Aeons campaign have made it down the river and through\
  \ the Dreamlands, now they look forward to more research and mystery before they\
  \ can catch up to their former associate. Keep your eyes on this blog for more reports\
  \ from the Order of the Amber Die.</p> \n     <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
