  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Nearly 20 years after the\
  \ Goblinblood Wars devastated the nation of Isger, an army of hobgoblins marched\
  \ toward conquest once more. Led by the formidable commander General Azaersi—who\
  \ had lost everything in the Goblinblood Wars, as so many others had—the so-called\
  \ Ironfang Invasion swept across the lands of Nirmathas and northern Molthune with\
  \ what seemed like an unstoppable momentum. Yet the residents of Nirmathas managed\
  \ to unite in their hour of need, rallied by a group of militia commanders that\
  \ proved a match for the Ironfang Legion’s legendary general. In a move that surprised\
  \ nearly everyone, the heroes of Nirmathas chose to show mercy to the merciless,\
  \ sparing the general and suing for peace. Azaersi agreed and pulled her armies\
  \ back to her mysterious base of operations, the <i>Vault of the Onyx Citadel</i>,\
  \ before officially founding the nation of Oprak in the mountains.</p> \n     <p>Which\
  \ is a fancy story, but what does that have to do with playable hobgoblins? General\
  \ Azaersi might have signed temporary non-aggression treaties with Nirmathas (and\
  \ somewhat ominously, with Nidal), but that’s a far cry from welcoming the hated\
  \ Ironfang Legion into human cities. In this case, it’s Tar-Baphon’s fault—the rise\
  \ of the Whispering Tyrant suddenly has the flesh and blood, living and breathing\
  \ hobgoblins looking like much more pleasant neighbors in comparison. Some highly\
  \ optimistic diplomats even hope to convince the Ironfang Legion to help fight Tar-Baphon’\
  s forces. After all, what are hobgoblins without a war?</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ by Klaher Baklaher</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>That’s the question we’re asking\
  \ Pathfinder 2E players to help answer while they play in the Age of Lost Omens.\
  \ Whether Azaersi is simply rebuilding her forces in order to invade again or has\
  \ instead turned her ambitions toward economic conquest instead of martial, Oprak\
  \ is currently a nation at peace. For a society comprised mostly of Goblinblood\
  \ orphans and veterans, who have only known combat and preparation for combat since\
  \ childhood, this sudden shift has led to a great deal of restlessness, soul-searching,\
  \ aimless depression… and in some, curious exploration. Where previously the most\
  \ brutal and efficient hobgoblins were the ones that excelled, less vicious hobgoblins\
  \ are now carving a place for themselves as explorers and envoys to non-hobgoblin\
  \ peoples.</p> \n     <p>Hobgoblins are an Uncommon ancestry. This might seem confusing,\
  \ as Uncommon usually suggests that something must be found through effort in-game,\
  \ and PCs can hardly switch ancestries mid-character! In this case, Uncommon is\
  \ what we use to indicate that a particular ancestry is not necessarily found (or\
  \ appropriate as PCs) in all areas of the Inner Sea region. A hobgoblin soldier\
  \ PC would not fit well into the War for the Crown Adventure Path, for example—\
  but that same PC could easily be found in the Eye of Dread meta-region, or even\
  \ touring the lands of Nidal or Varisia. With that said, Azaersi’s control over\
  \ the <i>Vault of the Onyx Citadel</i> means a hobgoblin can theoretically be found\
  \ anywhere, as the general has managed to create magical pathways to regions as\
  \ far-flung as the hobgoblin nation of Kaoling in Tian Xia!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Hobgoblins get 8 Hit Points from their ancestry, are Medium,\
  \ and have a speed of 25 feet. A hobgoblin speaks Common and Goblin, plus any additional\
  \ languages they might pick up. Hobgoblins have incredible endurance and are trained\
  \ for physical discipline, giving them an ability boost to Constitution, and they\
  \ possess keen minds, getting another ability boost in Intelligence. Like most ancestries,\
  \ they also get one free ability boost to put in any score. Hobgoblins were originally\
  \ created from goblins, however, meaning the two ancestries share an ability flaw\
  \ to Wisdom. With these traits, hobgoblins seem like they’d be perfectly suited\
  \ to be wizards… if not for the absolute, bone-deep loathing they hold toward almost\
  \ all magic. Oops!</p> \n     <p>In fact, hobgoblins hate magic so much that they\
  \ can choose the Elfbane Hobgoblin ancestry, which can help them resist spells:</p>\

  \ alt=\"Elfbane Hobgoblin. Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable\
  \ and fecund goblins, to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves\
  \ ultimately freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral\
  \ resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist Elf\
  \ Magic reaction. RESIST ELF MAGIC (reaction). Trigger: You attempt a saving throw\
  \ against a magical effect but haven’t rolled yet. Your ancestral resistance to\
  \ magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving\
  \ throw. If the triggering effect is arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.\"\
