  \ I wanted to take some time to talk about the scenarios that just had a pre-release\
  \ at that event and will be coming out this month. Unlike most releases, this month\
  \ consists of three new Starfinder Society products, although one of them is a unique\
  \ event and isn't available for open play just yet.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-16: Dreaming of the Future</em></a> is comes to us from\
  \ four distinct and skilled new authors. This quest pack contains a set of four\
  \ quests taking place throughout the Pact Worlds. The PCs travel to Aballon, the\
  \ Diaspora, Verces, and even the moons of Liavara in search of a hidden repository\
  \ of lost knowledge. Each quest runs about an hour and can provide shorter gaming\
  \ experiences for local groups looking for ways to introduce new players to Starfinder.\
  \ As mentioned, we have some new authors involved in these projects and I'd like\
  \ to be the first to welcome Natalie Kertzner, Nate Wright, Sasha Lindley Hall,\
  \ and Tineke Bolleman into our growing family of Starfinder Society freelancers!\
  \ We're also pleased to feature excellent art by Donald Crank and Nicolas Espinoza,\
  \ the latter who depicted this enterprising ikeshti to the right.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ scenario has the Quest, Repeatable, and Starship tags.</p> \n     <p>Our next\
  \ release is something special for players who've been following the ongoing Scoured\
  \ Stars season storyline. Veteran freelancer Larry Wilhelm brings us another epic\
  \ entry into the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild with <a href=\"/products/btpya08x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-17-Reclaiming-the-TimeLost-Tear\"\
  >Starfinder Society #1-17: Reclaiming the Time-Lost Tear</a>. As our first Tier\
  \ 5-8 scenario, you can expect a lot of challenging encounters and exploration of\
  \ heightened threats—including those illustrated by Graey Erb. I suspect many a\
  \ player will be uttering the dreaded line, \"it could be worse.\"</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ scenario has the Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]) tag.</p> \n     <div\

  >Starfinder Society #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</a>, by well-known Paizo freelancer\
  \ Mikko Kallio, saw its worldwide debut at Origins. This event is big, as in we're\
  \ talking trinary star system big. While describing much of this scenario would\
  \ be a spoiler-ridden minefield, I am pleased to say that it's an event that helps\
  \ shape the future of the campaign and begins to pivot the Starfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild's (extended) first season. As a fan of modern television, I'd refer to this\
  \ event as a strong \"mid-season finale\" that pays off many of our ongoing story\
  \ threads, while also seeding some serious new plotlines into the campaign. For\
  \ those interested in playing it soon, don't fret! There will be additional exclusive\
  \ runs of this this event at PaizoCon UK and Gen Con 2018. Following Gen Con, this\
  \ event becomes open for wider release at all qualifying events. If you're concerned\
  \ about future scenarios spoiling the events of this interactive, we've got you\
  \ covered—don't expect any major follow-ups to this event until the September releases!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This scenario has the Exclusive, Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]),\
  \ and Starship tags.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0199E-System.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Well that's it from the Starfinder Organized Play team!\
  \ We'd like to take an opportunity to thank the hard working staff, volunteers,\
  \ and everyone who played Starfinder (or Pathfinder) game at Origins 2018 (and the\
  \ fans who voted at the Origins Awards, naming Starfinder RPG the Fan Favorite RPG).\
  \ While convention season is hectic and filled with long-nights, going to a convention\
  \ always reminds me about what I really enjoy in our industry: the fans. Getting\
  \ to talk to people all throughout the convention about Starfinder has re-energized\
  \ me to get more done. I and the rest of the team renew our dedication in making\
  \ the Starfinder Roleplaying Guild the best living science-fantasy campaign around.</p>\
