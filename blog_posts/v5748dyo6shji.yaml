  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hello friends far and wide!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">We are very excited to be given the opportunity to partner with Paizo,\
  \ and knew we had to try something new with it, though at that stage we were unsure\
  \ what that would be. After we had met with the Paizo team for the first time, and\
  \ the creative juices were flowing, the idea of doing something big for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition kicked in. We had an interesting thought: <em>what if you could\
  \ truly, completely customize your dice to your character?</em> Not only by selecting\
  \ dice colors that match the color palette of your character but also unique glyphs\
  \ to represent their class, their abilities, their weapons, and their choice of\
  \ spells. </p> \n     <p>Introducing <em>Adventurer’s Curated Dice Collection</em>\
  \ by Level Up Dice - a customizable dice set that fits all of your character needs.\
  \ A way to not only purchase the specific dice you need to make the most out of\
  \ your hard earned gold, but also a way to curate a set for your wizard with force\
  \ damage d4’s and fire damage d6’s, or your ranger with their sword d12 and bow\
  \ d8 (including the deadly d10!) </p> \n     <p>The first step in fleshing out this\
  \ idea was taking in the sheer scale of this project. Level Up Dice decided: if\
  \ we’re going to create something completely new, we have to do this the right way.\
  \ Now, to do this and to limit risk we need to use a material we’re familiar with\
  \ and is highly customizable, which is where we decided on aluminum. It allows us\
  \ to make the 200+ highly detailed glyphic designs we need to implement this new\
  \ system properly. This also contributes to working toward the goal of doing this\
  \ across multiple materials... (hint hint)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ blue\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Alex’s rogue set</p> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>To show you exactly what we mean, we’ve taken Alex, the CEO and mastermind\
  \ behind LUD, and made a set specifically for his rogue he’s playing: two rogue\
  \ d20’s, three precision damage d6’s to cover the sneak attack, and two knife d4’\
  s for their dual weilding daggers. It's all he needs, no fluff, no dice sitting\
  \ in the corner of the tray unused!</p> \n     <p>Once this process was extended\
  \ to the whole team the excitement was palpable, and we will be sharing our teams\
  \ sets with you all very soon! For now, the one thing we found incredible and something\
  \ we thought would get you excited is that we have a potential of over 8,000 dice\
  \ to choose from in this initial launch alone! Below, we’ve displayed a small selection\
  \ of these dice for you to see!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
