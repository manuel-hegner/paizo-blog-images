  \ is James Beck (any/all) and I’m a Paizo freelancer, infinite master on Pathfinder\
  \ Infinite, co-founder of Eldritch Osiris Games, and all-around a geeky person!\
  \ I know times are particularly tough around the world, especially for those who\
  \ identify as LGBTQ+, but queer people have always existed and will always exist.\
  \ I truly believe in a future where everyone can be who they wish to be. Something\
  \ that I love about Pathfinder and Starfinder is how diverse the people of the setting\
  \ are. I can always find someone whom I can identify with, which always fills me\
  \ with joy. As Jews, we are taught about the value of Tikun Olam, to repair the\
  \ world. While I might not be able to cast a spell and make everything right in\
  \ the world, I believe we must all strive for a better tomorrow, where everyone\
  \ is safe to be who they are. With much love - James Beck</p>\n      <br>\n    \
  \  <h2>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h2>\n      <p>Hey, you. Yeah, you in the corner\
  \ thinking about what it means to be queer in 2025. You, thinking about if it's\
  \ worthwhile to come out. I'm here to say: yes, it is. Living my life openly and\
  \ unabashedly as a trans person makes it vibrant, joyful, and worth living. I spent\
  \ too much time in the closet and too long detransitioned to say otherwise. It's\
  \ beautiful, even if I find myself having to carefully manage my exposure to the\
  \ news to handle my stress.</p>\n      <p>For those of you who are allies, especially\
  \ cis allies of trans people: I'm not going to chide you or berate you. I've seen\
  \ too many people want to be lectured for failing to live up to their values. That's\
  \ for you to manage. Instead, I want you to celebrate with trans people. Give the\
  \ flowers to the trans people in your life now. Understand that being part of our\
  \ joy is part of helping us survive. I don't want anyone to look at my work and\
  \ think that reading it is like taking a gross medicine to help counter transphobia.\
  \ It's supposed to be fun!</p>\n      <p>When I sit down and design games for you\
  \ (yes, you, the person reading this!), I think of it as a gift. I'm trying to make\
  \ the game work as smoothly as possible for you, with as many delightful surprises\
  \ as I can fit onto the page, and open up an experience that we share across time\
  \ and space. I can only tell the stories that I can tell. I hope that it's an invitation\
  \ to understand a bit more about the world, or to explore something you haven't\
  \ explored before. Even if you don't know me (especially if you don't know me!),\
  \ my work is an attempt to say \"Hello, let's play a game together.\" I hope that\
  \ you have fun.</p>\n      <p><em>Rigby Bendele is a trans writer and tabletop game\

  \ (they/she)</h2>\n      <p>This Pride, I’m proud of a variety of things, but I’\
  ll narrow down to just two. Firstly, I recently celebrated my peoples’ (Indigenous\
  \ Okinawan &amp; Yaeyaman) cultures by getting hajichi, traditional hand tattoos.\
  \ They are traditionally women’s tattoos, usually done in stages to mark important\
  \ milestones toward adulthood. They were also legally banned when Japan colonized\
  \ our islands. But, as a trans femme and nonbinary person, me getting hajichi isn’\
  t just a celebration of my Indigenous heritages or a rejection of Imperial Japan’\
  s colonizer anti-tattoo laws; it’s also a celebration of my femininity and a visible\
  \ assertion of my status as a femme Uchinaanchu &amp; Yaimapitu.</p>\n      <p>Secondly,\
  \ I’m so happy that I’ve been performing in shows as a femme performer. I’m an actor-combatant\
  \ who regularly acts and fights in large shows at Renaissance Faires. And, a year\
  \ ago, I switched from playing masculine characters to femme ones. It has been thrilling\
  \ to show large, cheering crowds who I am.</p>\n      <p>Happy Pride!</p>\n    \
  \  <br>\n      <h2>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h2>\n      <p>Pride holds more meaning\
  \ for me this year than it has in years prior, given the circumstances in the US\
  \ and beyond. As systems work to erase hundreds of years of trans history and queer\
  \ culture, it falls to us to hold those memories and stories within us. By sharing\
  \ our stories, playing games, building worlds, and imagining futures where trans\
  \ joy is a staple, not an exception, we lay the foundation for a better world—not\
  \ only for those of us here now, but for the queer and trans people who follow after.</p>\n\
  \      <p>My great joy on a yearly basis now is running TTRPGs for Trans Rights,\
  \ an itch.io-based fundraiser that benefits trans-focused charities in hard-hit\
  \ states (Texas, Florida, West Virginia, and Ohio have all been recipients). As\
  \ one trans person, there’s only so much financial help I can provide, but with\
  \ the power of community organizing, we can make huge strides! This year’s fundraiser\
  \ pulled in over $80,000 for TransOhio and Kaleidoscope Youth Center, putting our\
  \ organization’s total over the $1 million mark, and giving those organizations\
  \ a much-needed funding boost to continue their important work. Organizations we’\
  ve supported in the past like Latina Trans Texas and Transinclusive Group (Florida)\
  \ still make use of the funds raised via our program, or programs and infrastructure\
  \ built using those funds. From an idea in my living room, we built a grassroots\
  \ fundraising initiative that is making life-changing amounts of money for queer\
  \ organizations.</p>\n      <p>Beyond the fundraising, it’s also important for me\
  \ to show queer and trans people in those hard-hit states that they do have community.\
  \ People care about you and want to see you thrive, even if you don’t get that kind\
  \ of support locally. And knowing that there is a world out there that loves you\
  \ as you are is life-saving.</p>\n      <p><em>Rue Dickey is Paizo’s Marketing &amp;\
  \ Media Specialist, as well as a freelance tabletop game designer, author, editor,\

  \ queer joy, rage, and power on the world stage.</em></p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>James\
  \ Jacobs (he/him)</h2>\n      <p>I’ve never been a big fan of parties or conventions\
  \ or parades or other big social gatherings, and that includes things like organized\
  \ protests and the like—I just get really awkward and uncomfortable when I’m around\
  \ a lot of people. I know I’m not the only one with this little quirk, but for those\
  \ out there who are leading the charge in more obvious and wide-reaching forms of\
  \ resistance by spreading love and acceptance, thank you. That said, there’s still\
  \ lots of ways to use stories of queer love, joy, and celebration to protest against\
  \ oppression, even if in the grand scheme they’re pretty subtle. LBGTQ+ representation\
  \ in Paizo’s Adventure Paths is one of the ways I’ve been working to share this\
  \ joy—it was a very deliberate choice in the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ I wrote, “Burnt Offerings,” to include Jasper Korvaski as a local paladin who\
  \ also happens to be gay, to put into print in the first volume proof that alignment\
  \ is irrelevant to the discussion. Since then, we’ve included SO many more stories\
  \ of queer joy and I’m proud of them all. A lot of them are much higher profile\
  \ than one relatively minor paladin in a small town on the Lost Coast, but even\
  \ these small stories are important ways to spread love and acceptance. So… thank\
  \ you to all the amazing writers and developers and designers and editors and artists\
  \ and more who’ve helped keep Paizo’s games filled with characters and stories that\
  \ I’m immensely proud to have been a part of all this time!</p>\n      <br clear=\"\

  \      <p>Lin Codega’s article “Playing Games Amidst the Revolution” echoes in the\
  \ back of my mind a lot these days. I’m a fifty-something queer, chronically ill,\
  \ invisibly disabled, autistic femme; everything is just so much, the weight of\
  \ the world so heavy, that some days, simply getting out of bed is a victory. Joy\
  \ does not come easily.</p>\n      <p>But queer joy <em>matters</em>. It’s how we\
  \ survive. So I seek joy, do my best to cultivate it, and try to help spread it\
  \ wherever I can. Games are part of how I do that. My most recent game (which I\
  \ proudly included in the recent TTRPGs for Trans Rights bundle on itch.io) takes\
  \ its inspiration from queer history—the tea dance, a non-alcoholic, queer event\
  \ when same-gender dancing was illegal at venues selling alcohol. The tea dance\
  \ was defiance wrapped in community and joy.</p>\n      <p>Dan Savage, reflecting\
  \ on the worst days of the AIDS crisis, talked about going from burying friends\
  \ in the morning, to protesting in the afternoon, and then out dancing at night.\
  \ “The dance kept us in the fight because it was the dance we were fighting for,”\
  \ he explained. “It didn’t look like we were going to win then and we did. It doesn’\
  t feel like we’re going to win now but we could. Keep fighting, keep dancing.”</p>\n\
  \      <p>I would add: <em>keep playing</em>. Tell your stories, imagine better\
  \ worlds, laugh with your friends around the gaming table—and know that you’re not\
  \ alone.</p>\n      <p>Come say hi on Bluesky (@lynnemeyer.bsky.social).</p>\n \

  \ archetype from Starfinder Second Edition’s first published book, <em>Starfinder\
  \ Galaxy Guide</em>!</p>\n      <p>Over the years, RPGs have helped me explore my\
  \ own identity, and being a part of the queer Paizo community has been a big part\
  \ of that. With every casual reference to a queer relationship in an adventure,\
  \ every trans NPC, and every post of the “make it gayer” meme in a Paizo project\
  \ server, I’m reminded that there a lot of us out there, and we’re not going anywhere.\
  \ If someone picks up a book with a queer character I made and feels that sense\

  \ is not a hypothetical story.</p>\n      <p>There is a game store. It’s on the\
  \ outskirts of a midsize city. It’s the passion project of its owner, and it’s probably\
  \ just barely staying afloat, but that’s not what we’re focused on right now.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The game store is small, cluttered, does a roaring trade in trading cards,\
  \ but one night a week, it hosts roleplaying games. Like most game stores, its clientele\
  \ skews toward cis white dudes. But gaming is for everybody, and the player base\
  \ has expanded.</p>\n      <p>The thing is, this game store, this midsize city?\
  \ Politically, they are not in a great place for people who are not cis white dudes.\
  \ Conservative, in whatever flavor fits the locale. And so you’d think there wouldn’\
  t be any queer people there, because why would there be?</p>\n      <p>But you’\
  d be wrong. Because we’re everywhere. We’re in that town. We’re in that store. And\
  \ most of the time, you wouldn’t even know we’re there.</p>\n      <p>But every\
  \ once in a while, you would. Because a Pathfinder scenario asks you to help an\
  \ NPC get their hands on a <em>serum of sex shift</em>. Or a Starfinder scenario\
  \ casually has no binary NPCs and a whole host of agender and nonbinary characters\
  \ using neopronouns. And that queer person? That kid, that teen, that adult who’\
  s just figuring themselves out? They light up. They feel seen, they feel understood,\
  \ they feel <em>joy</em>, for just a few minutes.</p>\n      <p>This is a story\
  \ I’ve heard dozens of times. Every time I do, it stokes the flame in my heart just\
  \ a little bit, and reminds me why I do this.</p>\n      <p>Because I know, every\
  \ time I hear this story, that the worst people in the world are absolutely frothing\
  \ mad about it. They are so incensed at the idea of queer joy that they will whip\
  \ themselves into a frenzy, destroy their lives and livelihoods in a futile effort\
  \ to snuff out that joy, go roaring into the dustbin of history with nothing to\
  \ show for it.</p>\n      <p>And we’ll just laugh and keep on. Because if the worst\
  \ people in the world are mad at you, I think you’re doing just fine.</p>\n    \
