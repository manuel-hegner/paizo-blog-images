  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>Hi everybody!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">The end of 2020 sees a bit of reorganization going on right now in\
  \ the editorial department, with some new opportunities and challenges for our staff.\
  \ This allows for exciting changes for our team, which officially went into place\
  \ last week.</p> \n     <p> First up, James Case moved to a different position at\
  \ Paizo. As this is an organized play focused blog, we aren’t spoilering his role\
  \ here. You’ll need to keep an eye out for a future Paizo staff blog for an update\
  \ on his new role, but you shouldn’t have too long to wait!</p> <!-- <br clear=\"\
  all\"/> --> \n     <p>James’ departure left a vacancy in the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Developer position. Thurston Hillman moved over from Starfinder Society to take\
  \ the lead on Pathfinder Society. Thursty joined the Organized Play team at the\
  \ outset of the Starfinder Society program almost four years ago to help build it\
  \ and to shape the direction of its stories. While people nowadays may associate\
  \ him more with Starfinder, he also has a long history with Pathfinder Society.\
  \ Over the past decade, Thursty wrote over a dozen Pathfinder Society adventures\
  \ of all shapes and sizes, everything from September’s Bounty, <em>Blood of the\
  \ Beautiful</em>, to the interactive special <em>Siege of the Diamond City</em>\
  \ and the wacky kobold hijinks of <em>True Dragons of Absalom</em>. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>Jenny Jarzabski, meanwhile, stepped up to become the Starfinder Society Developer\
  \ and will pick up the threads Thursty laid to take the program in new, Datch-inspired\
  \ directions. Jenny hit the ground running when she joined the Organized Play team;\
  \ it’s hard to believe sometimes she’s been here for months rather than years. Jenny\
  \ also came to development through her work as a freelance author. Some of her contributions\
  \ to the organized play scenario vault include this year’s Starfinder interactive,\
  \ <em>The Last Bite</em>, as well as <em>Honorbound Emissaries</em> and <em>Pact\
  \ World Warriors</em>.</p> \n     <p>Thursty and Jenny are both excited for their\
  \ new roles, and filled with ideas for exciting adventures for your PCs. They’re\
  \ already hard at work cooking up the metaplots for SFS Year 4 and PFS Year 3, as\
  \ well as finishing off the current seasons with a bang. We can’t wait to share\
  \ some spoilers with you and will do so over the next few months. Watch this space\
  \ for news!</p> \n     <p>These changes do leave us a bit short-staffed for a brief\
  \ time. In the near future, we’ll be bringing someone else on board. The hiring\
  \ process for this position is already in full swing. To fill the spot faster than\
  \ an open call, we invited a group of our highly qualified authors and volunteers\
  \ to apply, and we’ve begun interviewing candidates. We hope to wrap the entire\
  \ process before the holidays and will introduce our new team member to you soon\
  \ after.</p> \n     <p>If you didn’t see it earlier, check out our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shhr\"\
  >Monthly Update blog</a>. If you’re caught up, be sure to come back next week for\
  \ Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenario previews! </p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ then - Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
