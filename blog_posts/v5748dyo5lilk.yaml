  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 18, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, everyone! I'm writing to you today\
  \ from the floor of the GAMA Trade Show, the game industry's annual convocation\
  \ of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers in lovely Las Vegas, Nevada. GAMA\
  \ is not only a great chance to meet up with industry friends and business partners,\
  \ but it's also a great place to pick up exciting news from the attending publishers.\
  \ This year, Paizo and Pathfinder are no different! You've probably also seen the\
  \ news about our new paperback Pathfinder RPG Pocket Editions of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy88yj\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  ><em>Bestiary</em></a>, as well as the exciting announcement of September's <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9kg6\"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> hardcover Adventure\
  \ Path. You may not have seen the great news about Pathfinder miniatures, however,\
  \ so I wanted to carve out some time from my busy convention schedule to bring you\
  \ up to speed.</p> \n    <p>Our partners at WizKids, who have already produced nearly\
  \ a dozen sets of prepainted plastic <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> releases, announced on Tuesday that they are launching a brand-new\
  \ line of <i>unpainted</i> plastic miniatures based on their two popular fantasy\
  \ miniatures licenses—Pathfinder and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, along with some original\
  \ unbranded dungeon scenery!</p> \n    <p>In all the new unpainted figure line will\
  \ launch with more than 150 unique sculpts, and is scheduled for a fourth-quarter\
  \ 2016 release. All of the figures will come fully assembled, and will be pre-primed\
  \ with Acrylios Vallejo primer, some of the finest-quality hobby paint available.\
  \ The figures will come in a few different configurations:</p> \n    <ul>\n    \
  \ <li><b>Hero Packs</b> will contain both a low-level and a high-level sculpt of\
  \ the same character, such as the Pathfinder iconic hero Valeros, pictured below.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>Monster Packs</b> will contain 1–3 miniatures with different versions\
  \ of the same type of monster (for example, goblins, orcs, etc.).</li> \n     <li><b>Item\
  \ Packs</b> will contain scenery and items (treasure chests, traps, furniture and\
  \ the like) for detailing adventures.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Each pack will be\
  \ priced from $2.99-$3.99, depending on the size and number of figures included.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I had a chance to review early versions of these figures in hand at the\
  \ show, and I think you will all be blown away by the enhanced sculpting process\
  \ WizKids will be using, which highlights minute elements and includes deep cut\
  \ surface details and scaled features for easier hand painting.</p> \n    <p>Take\
  \ a look at the quick photos I took of Valeros on my iPhone to get a sense of how\
  \ cool these will look. Much more detailed photos will appear here in the weeks\
  \ to come.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160318-Valeros1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160318-Valeros1_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The launch of WizKids new unpainted figure line will\
  \ not impact either of Paizo's two existing miniatures lines, <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> from WizKids and <a href=\"/pathfinder/miniatures/reaper\"\
  >Pathfinder Miniatures</a> from Reaper. As the new figures will use completely new\
  \ sculpts and poses, there should be very little overlap with existing figures,\
  \ though it's safe to assume that some familiar faces are certain to appear in the\
  \ new line.</p> \n    <p>Also at the show, I revealed two more digital sculpts from\
  \ the forthcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> set <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, scheduled for an October\
  \ release.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Cockatrice.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Cockatrice_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Look out! It's a Cockatrice! He nips you with that nasty beak\
  \ of his and you're sure to be turned to stone. The Cockatrice is a Small, uncommon\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Doppelganger.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72378-Doppelganger_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Look out! That friendly NPC you picked up a few dungeon\
  \ rooms back isn't friendly at all—it's a Doppelganger! The Doppelganger is a Medium,\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>Lots more to reveal in the weeks to come. Keep your\
  \ eyes on this space for more exciting Pathfinder miniatures developments!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Until the stars are right, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
