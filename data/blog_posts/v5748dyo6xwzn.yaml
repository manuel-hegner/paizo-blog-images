  \ Convocation approaches with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq09ho9?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Rival-Academies\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Rival Academies</em></a>! Before the book releases on\
  \ March 5th, it’s time to let everyone in on a few school secrets.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ Convocation is ultimately an exhibition of what these six sponsor schools have\
  \ to offer and a place to exchange knowledge so it outlives its discoverers. But\
  \ far be it for any academic to accept that their exhibit wasn’t the most groundbreaking\
  \ or that their plan for eradicating demons fell behind their rival’s!</p>\n   \
  \   <p>So, the Convocation’s six schools have come together in a spirit of learning\
  \ and competition, alongside their invited guests. But who are these schools, where\
  \ do they learn the rest of the year, and what secrets have they brought with them?</p>\n\

  \ Paganessi.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The Academy of the Reclamation\
  \ may seem a strange host for this gathering of scholars. Located on the edge of\
  \ the demon-haunted lands of Sarkoris, it’s so new that it’s just now celebrating\
  \ its first graduating class. Its position in the fortress-city of Nerosyan does\
  \ provide some surprising benefits, however, with old crusader barracks becoming\
  \ temporary lodging for guests and the weapon racks of armories being replaced with\
  \ bookshelves.</p>\n      <p>Still, the academy’s existence can’t be separated from\
  \ the nation’s history. The people of Sarkoris were scattered for a hundred years,\
  \ their lands overrun by endless swarms of demons from the Worldwound. Only once\
  \ that portal to the Outer Rifts was closed could the process of healing the lands\
  \ and people truly begin.</p>\n      <p>The Academy of the Reclamation seeks to\
  \ gather the knowledge that dispersed along with the Sarkorian peoples. The magic—\
  and even the names—of the land’s old gods must be reclaimed alongside all the stories,\
  \ crafts, and traditions that defined the clans of Sarkoris. Somewhat controversially,\
  \ the academy also embraces what the descendants of old Sarkoris learned during\
  \ their long flight, even going so far as to establish a new school of wizardry.</p>\n\

  \ and Diarra Romagne by Anselmi Hyytinen.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>It’\
  s an easy mistake to see the Academy of the Reclamation as mired in sadness and\
  \ loss. Although the work ahead for returning Sarkorians and their allies is vast,\
  \ only a few years ago the demonic ranks and foul energy of the Outer Rifts were\
  \ truly endless. Every day is now a step forward, with each demon killed or plot\
  \ of land purified marking real progress toward the nation’s healing.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Spreading this hopeful message has mostly fallen to <strong>Diarra Romagne</strong>,\
  \ who is making a rare appearance at the Convocation, spending most of her time\
  \ traveling wherever the descendants of Sarkorian refugees can be found. Although\
  \ not everyone is at a place in their life where they can join the academy, few\
  \ can resist sharing their family’s story when presented with a smiling face and\
  \ a plate of cookies.</p>\n      <p>Perhaps the academy’s proudest step thus far\
  \ is rediscovering the rites of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting\
  \ travelers in exchange for their stories. The <strong>campfire chroniclers</strong>\
  \ who practice these rites have become an unofficial group of representatives, accepting\
  \ the visiting students as their charges in Isthralei’s place.</p>\n      <br>\n\

  \ gathers as much attention on the grounds of the Convocation as Cobyslarni. A massive\
  \ elephantine creature simply arrived one day, the school atop his back, and settled\
  \ into a convenient part of the Convocation grounds. This ancient creature, also\
  \ named Cobyslarni, is the rarely heard headmaster of the school along with being\
  \ its literal foundation.</p>\n      <p>The school spends most of its time in the\
  \ fey realm of the First World, with excursions to other planes as suits the headmaster’\
  s unexplained plans. Cobyslarni’s students are likewise gathered from the across\
  \ the planes, but largely represent the fey. Its curriculum focuses on the magic\
  \ of the fey, particularly the power of oaths and agreements. The most basic of\
  \ these agreements, between students and their mentors, form the basis for Cobyslarni’\
  s structure, as loose and chaotic as it may seem to outsiders.</p>\n      <p>With\
  \ so many students visiting the mortal Universe for the first time, the culture\
  \ shock is quite extreme. Time and terrain can seem suffocatingly rigid while death\
  \ looms as an actual threat to fey students. Meanwhile, other attendees are left\
  \ wondering whether the bird critiquing their exhibit is a professor offering honest\
  \ feedback or someone’s familiar babbling random insults.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ an extradimensional archive filled with things plucked from forgotten dreams.\
  \ Although the smiling librarians are quick to offer cryptic guidance, even the\
  \ students of Cobyslarni often find gremlins and mist-shrouded nightmares before\
  \ they locate forgotten rites or stories lost to time.</p>\n      <p>That is not\
  \ the only source for information that Cobyslarni brings, of course. The school\
  \ travels through distant realms, its students learning strange secrets and gathering\
  \ pacts with mysterious beings. Many students become witches by finding a single\
  \ powerful being willing to enter a pact, with a chosen few even managing to catch\
  \ the headmaster’s direct attention.</p>\n      <p>Students who dig deeper into\
  \ the magic of pacts generally become pactbinders, tying themselves magically to\
  \ many beings or even abstract concepts. The pactbinders of Cobyslarni have gathered\

  \   <br>\n      <p>The empire of Taldor has been a force to reckon with for thousands\
  \ of years, and Kitharodian Academy is dedicated to retelling that history through\

  \ in the Inner Sea, Kitharodian is a cultural power.</p>\n      <p>However, the\
  \ academy and its patron are tied together through thick and thin. Taldor has declined\
  \ over the centuries, becoming more insular and more focused on its past glory,\
  \ and Kitharodian has followed suit. A handful of tales are told and retold, polished\
  \ until they shine like gold. Meanwhile, students are compared to the centuries\
  \ of artists who came before them.</p>\n      <p>While publicly staging grand productions\
  \ of past emperors’ stories, it’s an open secret that many Kitharodian students\
  \ turn their acting to serve the present empress, Eutropia. Although the school\
  \ will carefully deny it, particularly at international events like the Convocation,\
  \ many of its students go on to work as spies among the Lion Blades after graduation.</p>\n\

  \ The finest of Kitharodian’s students can truly inhabit those roles, like living\
