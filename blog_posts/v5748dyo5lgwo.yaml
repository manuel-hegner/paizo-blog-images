  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's time to offer you a blog from\
  \ two of our Pathfinder Society lodges in different parts the world. With the soon-to-be-released\
  \ Hebrew and Spanish versions of the Pathfinder rulebooks, organized play should\
  \ see growing activity in both regions. With that impending growth, I asked our\
  \ venture-captains to write a short summary of Pathfinder Society play in their\
  \ region.</p> \n    <p>First, I present Yehuda Halfon's report on Pathfinder Israel.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hello all! My name's Yehuda Halfon, and I am the\
  \ VC of Israel. This is the story of our local Pathfinder Society lodge.</p> \n\
  \     <p>About a year ago, I listened to Happy Jacks RPG Podcast, a podcast that\
  \ talked about PFS. That's how I first learned that Pathfinder Society scenarios\
  \ can also be played in stores and online, not just at a convention. I started looking\
  \ for PFS games around my area, but I couldn't find any. After a short conversation\
  \ with a friend, Eran Aviram (now the venture-lieutenant of London for the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild), I decided to start a local lodge myself.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>In April 2014, we participated in our big convention,\
  \ Giborim (\"Heroes\" in Hebrew). We had 2 tables, where we ran <em>Destiny of the\
  \ Sands</em>, parts 1 and 2. The feedback was amazing, everyone liked it, and asked\
  \ for more. We did just that.</p> \n     <p>Since then we have had a presence in\
  \ every convention in Israel, big or small. We started with two tables and have\
  \ expanded to 18 tables at the most recent convention this past October at Icon,\
  \ Israel's largest sci-fi and fantasy gathering. We also started forming regular\
  \ groups in several stores around the country, such as the successful comic book\
  \ store Comikaza 2.0. Thanks to my amazing VL and walking Pathfinder encyclopedia,\
  \ Yotam \"Defiler\" Avni, we've expanded our reach beyond the center of the country,\
  \ and we're running PFS games in the north as well.</p> \n     <p>In order to make\
  \ PFS more approachable to the Hebrew-speaking crowd, Eran, Yotam and I are working\
  \ as the translators of the Hebrew edition of Pathfinder for the local publisher,\
  \ Monkey Time. We're using the new translated materials when updating our growing\
  \ site, <a href=\"http://pathfinder.org.il\" target=\"_blank\">pathfinder.org.il</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We're working to gather all of the Israeli Pathfinder players and GMs\
  \ together to form a big community for all Pathfinder games, including the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play. You can also check us out at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/PFSisrael/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">our Facebook group</a>!</p> \n     <p>What's next for us? Well,\
  \ this April we're planning a huge launch event for the Hebrew edition of Pathfinder\
  \ as part of Bigor, one of Israel's largest conventions. With the help of Monkey\
  \ Time, we're going to celebrate the new RPG, along with our one-year anniversary\
  \ of PFS in Israel!</p> \n     <p>Yehuda Halfon<br> <em>Venture-Captain, Israel</em></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Next, I present Miguel Rosales's report on Pathfinder\
  \ Mexico.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Hi! I am Venture Captain Miguel Rosales from Tijuana,\
  \ Mexico. Let me tell you all the awesomeness of the Pathfinder Society in Mexico,\
  \ including the Tijuana RPG scene!</p> \n     <p>In Tijuana, we have a large community\
  \ of really cool people called Tijuana RPG. We gather in a store, which also serves\
  \ as the headquarters of all geeky stuff happening in town. With the help of my\
  \ good friend and venture-lieutenant, Antonio Argueta, and with the help of many\
  \ other friends, we have founded an excellent Pathfinder community.</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ are still growing and currently have 60 players. We also have our own annual RPG\
  \ convention, where Pathfinder is the highlighted event, on the border of the U.S.\
  \ and Mexico. I invite everyone to join us and experience Pathfinder Society with\
  \ the Mexican people. We are very excited of all the new things planned for our\
  \ lodge in 2015.</p> \n     <p>This year will be our third convention in a row and\
  \ we hope to reach 300 attendees this year. It is also completely free. Any player,\
  \ gamemaster, venture-captain, or venture-lieutenant is welcome to play or run a\
  \ table at our conventions. We would be honored to have visitors from the other\
  \ side of the border join as both players and GMs.</p> \n     <p>Tabletop RPG's\
  \ are not popular in this part of the world and that's where we come in. We are\
  \ working hard to promote this game because we love it, have a lot of fun, and make\
  \ new friends. With the new Spanish language rulebooks, we hope to see continued\
  \ growth. This is our favorite sport, and we will make it grow. We also have plans\
  \ to kickoff for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game OP. We are looking for some\
  \ volunteers to help run that, and if interested, please contact me.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>I know there are people playing in others parts of Mexico. Unfortunately, I\
  \ am not aware of any committed organized play happening in any other region. If\
  \ anyone is interested in starting up Pathfinder Society where you live in Mexico,\
  \ please contact me.</p> \n     <p>See ya around adventurers, and don't hesitate\
  \ to come and visit us on this side of the border.</p> \n     <p>Miguel Rosales<br>\
  \ <em>Venture-Captain, Mexico</em></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Thank you to\
  \ all of the VCs and VLs for kickstartng awesome PFS Lodges in Isreal and Mexico.\
  \ I look forward to the additions of new venture-captains and venture-lieutenants\
  \ in other regions in both of these countries and watching their continued growth\
  \ with Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Keep up the awesome work!</p> \n    <p>Mike\
