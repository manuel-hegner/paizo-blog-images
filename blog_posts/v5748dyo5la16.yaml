  \ Iconics: Amiri</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 31, 2008 </p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>There are a million ways to die in the Realm\
  \ of the Mammoth Lords. The natives of this brutal land are the nomadic Kellids,\
  \ and they have made the best of this primal world. Amiri is one of these barbarians.\
  \ Although she was blessed with a combination of independence and brawn, Amiri's\
  \ childhood remained one of constant challenge. To the people of her tribe, the\
  \ Six Bears, brawn and bravery were not ideal characteristics for a woman to have.\
  \ To the Six Bears, a woman's role was simple—raise children, tend to the sick,\
  \ and forge bonds with other tribes. Women were resources. When a tribe wished to\
  \ form an alliance, they would send gifts of meat, furs, treasure, and daughters.\
  \ Amiri didn't see herself as livestock, and every chance she got, she tried to\
  \ one-up her brothers and cousins. When a hunter went out and caught a caribou for\
  \ the tribe, she would go out and catch two. When a party of orc raiders stumbled\
  \ into their hunting grounds and a tribal hero killed four, she took it upon herself\
  \ to kill six. Her constant sense of competition made her few friends—her brothers\
  \ were both intimidated by her ferocity and enthralled by her beauty, while her\
  \ sisters knew that each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When Amiri finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the\
  \ Six Bears. The other tribes took to calling her the \"Soft Chieftain\" of the\
  \ Six Bears, a name that humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring\
  \ that they were weak for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and\
  \ strong. None of the other tribes wanted any part of her—her continued presence\
  \ among the Six Bears caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the\
  \ elders determined that there was but one choice—Amiri had to die. The only problem\
  \ was the commonly held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and\
  \ the surest path to Hell.</p> \n    <p>The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome\
  \ sister rose soon enough, when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been\
  \ sighted in the nearby mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains\
  \ and to drive back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the\
  \ band. Shocked but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the\
  \ elders smiled at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's\
  \ sense of competition would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked\
  \ the rest of the hunters to goad her into just such a situation.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ warband headed up into the Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found\
  \ evidence of giants. One morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving\
  \ a dagger the size of a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly\
  \ slain a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated\
  \ him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would\
  \ return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing\
  \ that the dagger was part of the deception—that the warband had brought it with\
  \ them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan.</p> \n    <p>What the warband\
  \ themselves didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering\
  \ the mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff—the giant had\
  \ fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword.\
  \ Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all\
  \ she needed was his sword as proof—certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute\
  \ her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had\
  \ left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen\
  \ victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband\
  \ halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized\
  \ something was amiss—they were talking of her, and they were laughing.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Creeping unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped.\
  \ She heard her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and\
  \ how even now she was likely cooking in a giant's stewpot. That they seemed grateful\
  \ and so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that\
  \ her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped\
  \ into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had bested\
  \ them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back to laughter,\
  \ pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon. Her fury growing,\
  \ Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose, but the weapon's size\
  \ threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the other barbarian's growing\
  \ amusement.</p> \n    <p>It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt back to her feet.\
  \ Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her soul. Two of the\
  \ barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before they realized that\
  \ death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri not noticing the blows\
  \ that landed on her, simply stepping from one traitor to the next and cutting them\
  \ down.</p> \n    <p>When her rage finally subsided, Amiri realized what she had\
  \ done. She knew that the hunters had certainly deserved their fates, but they were\
  \ still kin. That her reasons for murdering them were, to her, valid didn't change\
  \ the ties of blood. She knew that she had cut those ties, and so she turned her\
  \ back on the remains, trusting that they would be discovered by another hunting\
  \ party soon enough. As she headed west into the lands of Irrisen and the unknown\
  \ reaches beyond, her heart was for the first time free—no longer was her future\
  \ tied to traditions that would constrain her. She has come to value her oversized\
  \ sword, and even though she can only truly wield it properly when her blood rage\
  \ takes her, it has become as much a part of her as her fierce independence or her\
  \ fiery heart. She no longer sees herself as a member of the Six Bears, but never\
  \ speaks of the circumstances that forced her to flee her homeland. Some things\
  \ are better left unsaid.</p> \n    <p>Amiri debuts as a pregenerated character\
