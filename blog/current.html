                   <h3>Jason Bulmahn</h3> 
                   <p>Hello everyone, I am Jason Bulmahn and I am the Director of Game Design at Paizo, in charge of the entire Rules and Lore team. I first got my start with Paizo back in 2004 as the Managing Editor of Dragon magazine but then served as the Lead Designer for the first edition of the Pathfinder RPG. Today, I work on setting the goals and design objectives of our games, envision major projects that won’t even be announced for several years, coordinate game ideas with our partners, and work to ensure that the team has everything they need to succeed.</p> 
                   <p>At night, I leave behind my guise as a mild-mannered game designer and turn into… yet another game designer, working on my own Pathfinder 2E setting called Eventide. I also tinker with other games under the name Minotaur Games, creating a zombie apocalypse hack of Pathfinder 2E called Hopefinder. You can find me streaming Wrath of the Righteous most Tuesday nights on Twitch and playing other games on Saturday afternoons (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/JasonBulmahn"><b>twitch.tv/JasonBulmahn</b></a>). I can be found on almost every social media platform (just search for Jason Bulmahn), but I am most active on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonBulmahn">@JasonBulmahn</a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Michael Sayre</h3> 
                   <p>We meet again! I’m Michael Sayre, the Design Manager for the Rules &amp; Lore team. My direct reports include Creative Director Luis Loza, Senior Designer James Case, Senior Developer Eleanor Ferron, and Developer Landon Winkler. I coordinate between them, our Lead Designer Logan Bonner, and the other teams in and beyond the creative department to plan and facilitate the creation of hardcover rulebooks, Lost Omens books, and a variety of other product types. I also do design and development work, leading and writing for those same books. You can follow me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJSayre1"><b>@MichaelJSayre1</b></a>. <br> </p>
                   <h3>Logan Bonner (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, out there! I’m Logan Bonner, the Pathfinder Lead Designer. That means I’m on overwatch for the game rules as a whole, looking for opportunities to introduce new systems and options and to make sure they come out at a pace that’s neither too slow to be exciting nor so fast it overwhelms folks and makes it too hard to keep up. Also, to make sure all the pieces fit together well. Rules sustainability and consistency, basically. One of our big goals with Second Edition was to give the books in our Rulebook line a better grounding in the lore of the world, and people have been really enjoying all we’ve added to make their characters and games feel more immersive. I’m looking forward to this new team structure, which will let us blend the story, world, and rules in more fun ways.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me on Twitter, where I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/loganbonner"><b>@loganbonner</b></a>, or occasionally on Mastodon as <a href="https://dice.camp/@loganbonner"><b>@loganbonner@dice.camp</b></a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Luis Loza</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, everyone! I'm Luis Loza, Creative Director for the Rules &amp; Lore team. You might now my work from helping create the Lost Omens line of settings book, and I'm going to continue helping shepherd the setting as Creative Director. I look forward to some of the exciting events we have planned in the future of the Lost Omens setting and I hope you'll enjoy the ride! I live on a variety of places online, but the easiest spots to find me are on my twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/donatoclassic">@donatoclassic</a>) and my personal <a href="https://www.luisloza.com/">website</a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>James Case</h3> 
                   <p>I’m James Case, Senior Designer here at Paizo. My responsibilities include proposing, leading, and developing new rulebooks; designing new classes, subsystems, and supporting products; and training freelancers and new members of the team. You can follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/toriariaria">@toriariaria</a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Eleanor Ferron (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I'm Eleanor Ferron, a Senior Developer on the Rules &amp; Lore team. I work on the Lost Omens line with Luis Loza to bring the world and setting of Golarion to life!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Landon Winkler (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Landon Winkler, a Developer on the Rules &amp; Lore team. I’m new to the team, so still very much learning the ropes. Mostly, I just want to create fun creatures and other bits of stories for everyone to use. I love playing support, so getting these things polished up for your table is a great way to do that behind the scenes. On the off chance you need to get in touch with me, I can be reached at <a href="https://twitter.com/landonwinkler"><b>@landonwinkler</b></a> as long as Twitter lasts. Cheers!</p>

                   <p>If you’re interested in joining this team, we’ve actually opened up two new positions! We’re looking to hire one new designer and one new developer for the team, whose responsibilities will be in helping us plan and create the new content produced by the Rules &amp; Lore team. While industry experience is strongly preferred for people interested in these positions, these are not intended to be senior positions, and we do have room for talented and interested parties who are earlier in their TTRPG careers and might have great ideas but need a little more training and experience. You can see the specific requirements of these positions <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/careers">here on our Careers page</a>.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>While we can’t get into absolutely everything in this book, one piece that I think a lot of people will enjoy is the “enhanced” versions of four existing base classes. The Envoy, Solarian, Technomancer and Witchwarper all receive a fresh coat of paint with some revised mechanics. This generally means a few key tweaks to core abilities or filling in some levels that didn’t provide interesting class options. In some cases, it’s also about opening up the classes to feel like they’re contributing more during combat and not always falling into the tactics all the time. We’re very excited to see how these turn out when they release late this year.</p> 
                   <p>Not much else to say, as this book is a decent way’s out… but…</p> 
                   <p>This is Destructicus. He’s a Novian, which is a Tiny-sized species who emerge from dying suns. Yes, you can play this species.</p>

                   <p>Here are just a few delightful things players might experience:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Many different RPG systems, including (but by no means limited to) Paizo's own Pathfinder and Starfinder.</li> 
                    <li>A vast assortment of published adventures and homebrewed content. </li> 
                    <li>All manner of genres, degrees of seriousness, and maturity levels. </li> 
                    <li>Shorter or longer games or games that start at times that are more convenient to you.</li> 
                    <li>Playtests or premieres of upcoming third-party adventures by the next big author or company, or by some of your familiar favorites!</li>

                   </ul> 
                   <p>We're thrilled to offer such experiences once again!</p> 
                   <h2>Event Host Information</h2> 
                   <p>But of course, these wonderful events require people to envision, plan, and run them. That's where you come in. Now is your chance to run the game you've been planning for years, and to give your players an experience they'll be talking about until next PaizoCon! </p> 
                   <p>This year's event application process is designed to make it easy for you to describe what you want to host, so that we can help attendees find exactly what they're looking for. PaizoCon attendees who wish to run one or more events for PaizoCon 2023 should review the following information, then fill out the application linked below.</p> 
                   <br>

                    <li>Applications will be accepted for about 3 weeks and will be processed on an ongoing basis.</li> 
                    <li>Events need not be tabletop RPGs—if you want to run your own panels, workshops, mini-painting corners, board games, party games, or something completely different, let us know and we’ll see what we can do for you!</li>

Any other necessary arrangements—virtual tabletops, alternate voice chat applications, etc.—must be made by the applicant and included in the application.</li> 
                    <li>By default, the content for all events is expected to adhere to the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=488">Pathfinder Baseline</a>. Deviations from the Baseline are to be disclosed in the application, and such deviations will be published in the schedule so attendees are aware of what to expect.

                    <li>Applicants who are approved to run events for 12 hours or more will receive a free attendance badge for PaizoCon 2023, and our gratitude. Applicants who do not qualify for a free badge will still need to purchase one.</li>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“This stretch of coastline is straight as Abadar’s hair part. We’ll just have to go in full sail and fuse-ready, and hope the conjured fog gets us close enough.” Shimali Manux drummed her fingers on her cabin’s fold-out desk, glowering at a map of Chelaxian waters like it had spat in her tankard. Esidries, her first mate, ran a hand through her long, shaggy hair, then adjusted her eyepatch. She seemed to have her own grievances with cartography.</p> 
                   <p>Well… Shimali’s face spread its wings into a smile. She was admiral of the Vidric navy, a hero of the Cart Fire Uprising that had sparked the revolution. One of only a handful of Firebrands with their fourth mark. <em>This is the exact kind of trouble you go looking for, isn’t it?</em></p> 
                   <p>It was the night before their planned attack on the Chelaxian port of Laekastel. A little raven had brought word that the Bellflower Network was ferrying a number of recently liberated families into the port from Westcrown, then on to freedom in Andoran.</p> 
                   <p>The dottari were apparently less than thrilled. The Salt Breakers, among them Shimali and Esidries’s host ship, the <em>Sunburst Shackle</em>, had been called in to head off any Thrunic naval efforts. But the diabolists had moved faster than expected—Laekastel was now under blockade.</p> 
                   <p>Hence the last-minute tactical discussions between Shimali, Esidries, and an irksomely frank and accurate map. There was more than enough to consider. By the time they settled on details, the sun was filling the sea with fire and molten gold. They’d crafted a sound plan. The rest was up to the crews, captains, and Desna herself.</p> 
                   <p>“And if it doesn’t work…” Shimali said through a lopsided grin.</p> 
                   <p>Esidries was smiling now, too. She recognized Shimali’s expression—the one that meant her sharp-fanged intellect could smell prey.</p> 
                   <p>“...the best tales tackle tall odds,” Esidries finished, lifting an imaginary tankard. Shimali laughed, tapping her own mock vessel against her first mate’s, and the two knocked back their airy beverages.</p> 
                   <p>“What’ve you brought this time, Admiral?” Esidries cocked her chin at a small box holding down one corner of the map. Shimali’s mementos. There was a much larger collection back in Anthusis, but she always brought a few with her on these three-day ‘I’m just a crewmate like anyone else’ tours.</p> 
                   <p>She rolled her eyes. “Mention rank again and I’m pushing you through that window. I get enough <em>Admiral</em> above deck.” She undid the little wooden chest’s simple latch and lifted the lid.</p> 
                   <p>Her expression softened. “You remember these?” She pulled a crumpled metal spike from the box, followed by a quilted square in a flower pattern. “One of our first Bellflower undertakings. Much more helpful coastline than this blighted stretch”</p> 
                   <p>Esidries chuckled. “I remember that armiger’s face when you sidestepped his flail and he caved in the lictor’s pauldron, yes.” She hid a smile in her drink. “How is the Order of the Chain these days? I’m sure they keep in touch—you made quite the first impression.”</p> 
                   <p>She was waiting for a quick-witted retort, but none came. The admiral had lifted a necklace from the chest, a blue and red cord threaded with rounds of broken bone. Her eyes had gone far away and long ago.</p> 
                   <p>Esidries nodded. She knew the expression. Had worn it herself, on plenty of occasions. Sadness, solemnity. And hope, a brilliant flag waving in a clear sky.</p>

                   <p>Eleder was chaos. Embers, smoke, and screams choked the air above the Sargavan colonial capital, while the clamor of fighting and the smell of brimstone filled its alleys. The revolutionaries had almost pushed through to the baron’s palace. They’d charged into New Haliad with a fury stoked by centuries of oppression. But the dottari kept coming, and now they were getting surrounded.</p> 
                   <p>Shimali, Esidries, and some two dozen of their Salt Breakers were high above the plaza surrounding the plaza, crouched behind a red-shingled roofline. This was the tipping point. The fulcrum of her people’s future. She could feel it in the air, read it on her comrades’ faces.</p> 
                   <p><em>This would be the perfect time for a rousing speech</em>, she thought. But she was too tired, too sore. She simply looked back at her Salt Breakers and nodded. They vaulted the roofline.</p> 
                   <p>Coats and hair flapping behind them, they careened down the shingles and into the plaza. Righteous anger thundered from them as a wordless roar. Shimali felt the crunch of a soldier’s neck beneath her boot. Before she could register the symbolism, they were in the thick of it.</p> 
                   <p>The Salt Breakers pushed into the rear of the Thrunite formation, the beleaguered revolutionaries’ cheers driving them on. Esidries laid into the Chelaxians with a miner’s pick she’d acquired somewhere along the way. Each blow punched through steel and flesh and sent tremors up her arm. Shimali’s cutlass penned its own red-inked story.</p> 
                   <p>“Shimali!”</p> 
                   <p>She barely heard Esidries’s cry in time. She whirled around, her blade only just turning aside the longsword meant for her guts. The dottari staggered into her. His breath was hot on her face, heavy with the smell of the whisperleaf caked to his gums. His eyes held surprise and hatred in equal measure.</p> 
                   <p>She drove her forehead into his nose, shoved him aside. Her sword shrieked across the breastplate of another charging soldier. The sound almost masked the crash of armored boots approaching from behind. Without looking, she drew her pistol and fired. Her desperation was rewarded with the sound of two hundred pounds of bootlicker clattering to the ground. She shared a wide-eyed <em>I can’t believe that worked</em> grin with Esidries, offering a silent prayer to Desna and Lubaiko both.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Then fresh Hell arrived. The air above the plaza split and screamed. A fiery gash shrieked open, becoming a burning eye with a bone-white pupil.</p> 
                   <p>Shimali’s blood ran cold. She could <em>taste</em> the wrongness of the extraplanar intrusion, something caustic at the back of her throat.</p> 
                   <p>“Bone devil! Gods-damned bone devil!” Her fear was galvanizing. “Rally! Rally for loved ones, for home. For throwing off the yoke of Hell!”</p> 
                   <p>The fiend pulled itself free of the rift, landing hard enough to crack paving stones. It stood its full height, almost level with the rooftops. It threw its head back and let loose an ear-splitting challenge that shattered nearby windows and sent shivers down Shimali’s spine.</p> 
                   <p>She surveyed the beleaguered revolutionaries picking their way over colonialist corpses. They were already taking up position, surrounding the infernal monstrosity. Esidries was beside her—<em>just like always</em>—weaving sigils in the air, a Magaambyan winter-song chiming its way off her tongue.</p> 
                   <p>She charged.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="75%">
                   </center> 
                   <p>“You know, I tell people that story and they don’t believe me. ‘You can’t take down a bone devil with pitchforks and adrenaline,’ they tell me. ‘Tall as a house and made of hate, there’s no way!’” Esidries snorted in mock exasperation. “But if <em>Shimali Manux</em>, hero of the revolution, tells it, well. You’d think my record would—”</p> 
                   <p>The <em>Sunburst Shackle</em> lurched to one side so hard that it took them a few moments to realize they were sprawled on the floor. Shimali swatted the map off her face, cursing the pen, the ink, and the person responsible for the miserable thing. She hauled herself to her feet then helped Esidries to hers. The cabin was a wreck, but at least her sword and gun were still hanging on the wall. They exchanged a knowing look, grabbed their weapons, and rushed abovedecks.</p> 
                   <p><em>We’re still leagues from Laekastel—how did they find us? Worse, how did they get the drop on us?</em></p> 
                   <p>The answer came as soon as she surfaced beneath the night sky. Panic crackled across the deck. A sailor, clothes completely dry, coughed a staggering amount of murky seawater at her feet.</p> 
                   <p><em>Sarglagons</em>.</p> 
                   <p>And there they were. The sea between the ships churned with piscine horrors. Iridescent magenta fins, writhing hands, and the razored maws of Hell’s darkest depths—drowning devils. A handful were attempting to capsize the <em>Sunburst Shackle</em>. Shimali could hear the chattering of others attacking the rest of the fleet.</p> 
                   <p>It had been years since Vidrian’s birth in fire, and Shimali had grown into her role as commander. She straightened, spread her arms wide, and strode resolutely toward the deck.</p> 
                   <p>“Salt Breakers! House Thrune wants to strangle the cry for freedom, bind the world in iron and fear! Drown us in blood!” The power in her voice cut through the din of battle. She clapped the retching sailor on the shoulder, stopped long enough to acknowledge the determination in their eyes. “But there’s Gozreh’s gift in our veins! Iron in our spines! Phoenix flames in our hearts!”</p> 
                   <p>She could feel the energy shifting as the crew rallied. She just needed to get to the wind-singer, start fighting fire with magical fire. <em>If Shattering Howl starts the song, we—</em></p> 
                   <p>The air above the deck split and screamed. Bone-white claws gouged a hole between worlds, and she could see flashes of black wings and a scorpion’s fleshless tail.</p> 
                   <p>Then a second rift opened. Followed by another, and another. Shimali’s skin crawled as the heat and stench of Hell poured over the deck.</p> 
                   <p>“The best tales…” Esidries stepped up beside her, hands already crafting a spell.</p> 
                   <p>“...tackle tall odds,” Shimali finished. She grinned at her first mate. “And what self-respecting Firebrand settles for less than the best?”</p>

                   <p>First, the narrative team will kick things off with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02efy">Season of Ghosts Adventure Path</a> in October of 2023! This horror-themed campaign is set in the haunted land of Shenmen and begins just after the small town of Willowshore celebrates the Season of Ghosts—a local festival to appease Shenmen’s many evil ghosts and spirits and ensure safety for the coming year. Yet this year, something’s gone wrong, and the PCs wake to find their hometown of Willowshore has fallen under a sinister curse and been invaded by monsters. In the months to come, the heroes must help the people of Willowshore prepare for winter while working to discover the cause of the curse that’s cut them all off from the rest of the world. Is it the work of a fiend? The machinations of vengeful spirits? Or is it something much, much worse?</p>

                   <ul> 
                    <li><em><b>The Summer that Never Was</b></em>, by Sen H.H.S.</li>

                   </ul> 
                   <p> You might notice that this is our first four-part adventure path, for a very good reason! Each of this Adventure Path’s volumes take place over the course of a different season, starting with the rainy summer and ending in the spring. With each season’s passing, the stakes the heroes face escalate, and the revelations in store will shock the townsfolk of Willowshore to the core! Will your group of adventures be able to save their hometown from a mysterious supernatural horror, or will your hometown simply become the next of Shenmen’s haunted ruins?</p>

                   <p>The <em><b>Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</b></em> covers the many diverse nations and cultures that inhabit Tian Xia. Snippets of Tian Xia’s lore and history have come to Avistan via merchants and immigrants, but this book will present a look at the whole picture, from the elemental hegemony and yaoguai wars that shaped the landscape in ancient times to the return of Hao Jin in the modern era. Learn the secrets behind the undying emperor of Yixing, whose return is still awaited in Po Li. Offer a small prayer to the local kami, anito, or kaiju. See if you find satisfaction in the service of the Empress of Heaven, Shizuru, or in the explosive rivalry between the dancing gods Mugura and Nrithu.</p> 
                   <p>In an age ruled by heroes unfettered by prophecy, change is sweeping across the continent. Some of you might have helped Ameiko Kaijitsu depose the Jade Regent and ascend to the throne of Minkai—now witness the new Ondori era under her rule. Step into the nation of Bachuan, now that a Po Li oracle has convinced it to ease its restrictions and open its borders; Hao Jin’s tapestry people now live here too, descendants of a past once thought lost for good. Amanandar, a nation now as Tian in heritage as it is Taldan, has declared its independence with the blessings of Queen Eutropia and renamed itself as Linvarre—visitors from Avistan may delight in its Grogrisant lion dances or pick up a few words of its national language of Taltien. Journey the perilous Valashmai Jungle and find your way upon the Valash Raj, flourishing among the ruins shattered by giant beasts and monsters. The World Guide will lead you through these nations and more before giving GMs a bestiary containing the continent’s monsters, from the ferocious, four-horned aoyin to the aristocrat-eating yeongno.</p>

                   <p>After finding a nation or city that sparks your interest in the <em>World Guide</em>, it’s only natural to want to make a character from there! The <em><b>The Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</b></em> will introduce new rules options to bring your characters to life! The book will contain six brand-new ancestries and numerous backgrounds to provide the seeds for new PCs. You’ll also find expanded heritages and feats for existing ancestries that might be more common in Tian Xia than in other areas, like the peachchild leshy heritage, which might have come from a fruit that floated down a river, or the bakuwa lizardfolk heritage, possibly responsible for eclipses over Minata when they eat the moon! The book also contains numerous character options to flesh out Tian adventurers, whether that’s skill feats to prepare elemental Tian medicine or a new magus hybrid study that lets you leap weightlessly through the air with your cultivated magic, before your sword strikes home. </p> 
                   <p>We thought we’d give a tiny sneak peek into three of the new ancestries coming in the <em>Character Guide</em>, shall we:</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f09aeaa8-68d8-4805-bb05-c3c56a2a73fb/Samsaran_2000.png?fm=jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f09aeaa8-68d8-4805-bb05-c3c56a2a73fb/Samsaran_2000.png?fm=jpg" width="350px" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="A blue skinned, white haired humanoid figure wearing a dark blue dress with beaded jewelry and vail"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Samsaran art by Paulo Magalhães</p>
                   </div> 
                   <p><b>Samsarans</b> have reincarnated many times, and they will do so many times more. This ancestry dwells in enclaves, though often a samsaran will journey to learn more about the world in pursuit of their goal of enlightenment. Samsarans can call upon the memories of their past selves to aid them in skill checks—perhaps recalling a life as a painter as they observe a piece of art—and they can even share some of their powerful life essence with an ally to heal them! Samsarans are great for characters with deep knowledge and experience but who always seek to learn new things.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   </div> 
                   <p>Next we have <b>wayangs</b>, a diasporic people who have sailed from the Shadow Plane to the oceans and forests of Tian Xia. Wayangs value freedom and knowledge, often organizing their societies in overlapping circles around wise teachers or artisans. Unsurprisingly, wayangs have abilities that let them harness their shadows, often through specific dances, and more magically inclined wayangs might gain a unique dreaming heirloom with occult powers. Wayangs are great for artistic or expressive characters, or ones who want to use their magical powers to liberate others.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/cb915775-4df9-46b1-9aa4-1ccd117d7a14/Tanuki_2000.png?fm=jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/cb915775-4df9-46b1-9aa4-1ccd117d7a14/Tanuki_2000.png?fm=jpg" width="400px" style="padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;" alt="Tanuki, a bipedal racoon-like being dressed in tan shorts and a white cape"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Tanuki art by Sammy Khalid</p>
                   </div> 
                   <p>The last ancestry we’ll be previewing today is a new one! Scurrying underfoot, <b>tanuki</b> are a fun-loving people who are determined to get the most out of life before their luck runs out! Tanuki can shapeshift into a variety of forms, whether that’s turning into a teapot to hide in a room or turning into a priest to get a bit of extra respect. Tanuki also use illusions to play tricks on others or get a laugh, and they enjoy drumming on their bellies under the full moon. Tanuki are a great ancestry for players who want to play underdogs or just have fun!</p> 
                   <p>Lastly, we couldn’t have put these books together without an amazing team of writers! The Lost Omens Tian Xia books are brought to you by Eren Ahn, Jeremy Blum, Alyx Bui, James Case, Banana Chan, Connie Chang, Rick Chia, Hiromi Cota, Hans Chun, Theta Chun, Dana Ebert, Basheer Ghouse, John Godek III, Joan Hong, Sen H.H.S., Michelle Jones, Joshua Kim, Daniel Kwan, Dash Kwiatkowski, Jacky Leung, Jesse J.

                   <h2>Starfinder Society Year 6</h2> 
                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si8h?Starfinder-Society-Year-6-Announcement">Year of Fortune’s Fall</a> is upon us, Starfinders! This month, Jessica announced the theme for Starfinder Society Year 6, launching at PaizoCon Online at the end of May. When a mysterious and powerful criminal syndicate, dubbed the Organization, enacts a bloody attack within the Pact Worlds, First Seeker Ehu Hadif vows to bring an end to their predations. Yet, this attack is only the opening salvo in a plot destined to doom millions.</p> 
                   <p>It’s up to you to unravel the plans of the Organization and bring the group’s leaders to justice! This Organization has been waiting in the wings for years, but now they must be stopped before it’s too late!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Replays</h2> 
                   <p>One of the most-requested features in my time here has been the ability to replay scenarios. Whether it’s because you have another character who would fit perfectly into an adventure or just because you want to help make a table fire, this has been something players and GMs have asked for constantly. I’m delighted to tell you that, thanks to the tireless work of our tech team, this is now possible!</p> 
                   <p>If you check your Organized Play account, you will see that you now have Replays available for Pathfinder Society (both first and second edition) as well as Starfinder Society. Here are the rules governing these Replays, which will be added to the Guide to Organized Play during the next update:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>All players (current and future) start with 2 replays. Current players may have obtained additional replays as a thanks for your patience while we got the system up and running. [1]</li> 
                    <li>GMs will earn one replay for each GM rank they achieve. Additionally, on January 1st of each year we will run a report to grant GMs one replay per GM rank for each active system. [2]</li> 
                    <li>Additional replays for PFS2 and SFS can be purchased at a rate of <b>40 Achievement Points per replay</b>. This cost does not increase over time. Players must purchase a replay prior to completion and reporting of the scenario they are replaying.</li> 
                    <li>Players must indicate to their GM when they are using a replay. When reporting a replayed scenario, the GM should check the “Consume Replay” box next to the character’s information so they earn full credit for the scenario.</li> 
                    <li>Players who replay a scenario earn full rewards as a result of their playthrough. They get access to any boons and items on their Chronicle Sheet, as well as gold, XP and Reputation, all subject to the outcome of the scenario. </li> 
                    <li>Replays are not used when GMing a scenario; GMs will continue to earn table credit and AcP for GMing a non-repeatable scenario.</li> 
                    <li>Replays can be used on sanctioned content that is scenario-length or shorter, such as One-Shots, non-repeatable Quests and Free RPG Day adventures. Replays cannot be used on long-form content such as standalone modules or Adventure Path volumes.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>[1] The formula for additional replays is 2 replays for every 50 games played or GMed in the program prior to February 18, 2023.<br> [2] This functionality does not exist yet, tech is currently assessing the feasibility of doing so, but I'm confident in our/their abilities. If it is infeasible to do so automatically in a short timeframe I will investigate manual solutions.</p>
                   </blockquote> 
                   <p>As a reminder, per the rules in the Guide to Organized Play, players <em>mus</em>t inform their GMs when they are replaying a scenario, whether it’s because they are using a Replay or because it is a Repeatable scenario they have played before. Players replaying a scenario should not use metagame knowledge to ruin the experience for first-time players.</p> 
                   <p>GMs are explicitly permitted to limit signups to their tables based on non-discriminatory criteria, such as limiting a run of a scenario to first-time players if they prefer.</p> 
                   <p>We’re also aware of some minor issues with reduced Achievement Points or table credit that occurred as a result of this code update. We’re digging into the exact causes but hope to have fixes rolled out very soon. In the meantime, if you have any questions about incorrect counts of any points, including Replays, don’t hesitate to email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com. Thank you for your patience as we made these technical updates, and enjoy the new Replays!</p>

                   <h2>Starfinder Errata Updates</h2> 
                   <p>Last month, the Starfinder team announced <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si8j?Starfinder-FAQ-and-Errata-Update">a host of new errata and updates</a> to the core Starfinder rules. Any rule changes like this are always considered to apply immediately to Starfinder Society play, so these changes are now in effect at our tables.</p> 
                   <p>Additionally, some of these changes address the initial reasons we did not allow certain character options for play in Starfinder Society. We’re pleased to announce that the following options are now legal in Starfinder Society play:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><em>Starfinder Armory</em>: all garottes and vibrogarottes</li> 
                    <li><em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em>: mature xenolash</li> 
                    <li><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em>: thasphalt blaster</li> 
                    <li><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>: Devastating Throw, Draconic Shot, Hurl Ally, ink gland augmentation, linnormling creature companion</li> 
                    <li><em>Horizons of the Vast</em> Adventure Path: Zeitgeist mystic connection</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society Character Options page</a> has been updated to reflect these changes, as well as to remove some additional clarifications that are now part of the core rules.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>Last week, with the release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault"><em>Treasure Vault</em></a>, we sanctioned the options for Pathfinder Society play!

                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Star for Pathfinder Society (first edition).</p>

In <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I wrote a variety of topics, but the parts I'm most excited about are the crafting variant rules and nature crafting sections, including the magic gardens!

                   <p>Hello, all! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I'm one of the cover authors on <em>Treasure Vault</em>! My sections were: alchemical foods, artifacts, cursed/intelligent items, grimoires, missives (with Jessica Catalan), relics, spellhearts, staves, and wondrous consumables. I love cool loot, so this book was awesome to work on! I can't pick a favorite item, but the cooperative waffles have apparently been making a splash, so I'll tell you I gave them that form to celebrate the return of the mithral waffle iron in PF2. I played a PF1 sorcerer who not only bought one, but liked it so much that he put one of his scant two skill ranks every level into Craft (waffle). And he always made the party breakfast.</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone! My name's Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily writes for Pathfinder and Starfinder. For <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I contributed to the wands and missives sections. <em>Treasure Vault</em> was a delightful, collaborative book to work on, and I look forward to seeing all the new tricks, treats, and treasures it contains unleashed on gaming tables! Enjoy!</p>

                   <h3>Andrew Geels</h3> 
                   <p>Hi there! I wrote for Treasure Vault’s specific magic shields, alchemical bombs, and elixirs sections. This is the fourth Paizo book I’ve written for, and probably the one I’m most excited to see get used! Magic shields were a blast to write, especially with new shield types. The starfall shield in particular is one of my favorites (turning into a meteor is cool), but I also love entries like the warding escutcheon, and the door-themed stone tower shield that becomes a door or a stone tower. Making new bombs and elixirs with weird niches was a fun challenge. I can’t wait to hear stories of trueshape bombs turning the tide against werewolves, or numbing and soothing tonics pulling parties through deadly fights.</p>

You can find the first set of fulus I wrote back in <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. After you've showered <em>Treasure Vault</em> with love, don't forget to check on recent and upcoming publications to which I have also contributed, such as <em>Lost Omens: Firebrands</em>, <em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em>, and last but not least, <em>Rage of Elements</em>!

                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! Since writing weapon runes for <em>Treasure Vault</em>, I've become the Developer for Starfinder. And while my focus has shifted to the other side of the Gap, I'm so happy to keep busy as a freelancer and Pathfinder Infinite contributor during what free time I can scrape together. Feel free to hit me up on twitter, where I can't wait to hear about all the shenanigans caused by the nifty items in this book (especially the authorized rune).</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, I'm Jacob W. Michaels, and I'm hoping the potions I created for <em>Treasure Vault</em> won't lead you to your doom, like the witches did Macbeth. It was a lot of fun adding some potions to the mix, and playing with options outside the traditional spells-in-a-jar formula.

                   <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including Everybody Games and Rogue Genius Games. I was excited to trade some magic weapons to the mighty Valashinaz! (I'm still waiting for the kobolds she promised would clean out my garage, though.) I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to contact me if you are looking for a reliable writer! When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

                   <h3>Jessica Redekop (she/they/he): </h3> 
                   <p>Hi! I'm Jess, and I wrote some fun new catalysts for <em>Treasure Vault</em>. I hope you have fun with them! My favorite is the Euphoric Loop, which lets you get a little more out of charm during combat encounters where you know the spell can't last. If you'd like to see more of my work, I also wrote the items in the Material Changes shop of <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, and perhaps later this year you will even see my name in, on, or generally just around <em>Rage of Elements</em>...?</p>

                   <p>Hi! My name is Mari Tokuda, and I worked on the mystical, magical oils of the <em>Treasure Vault</em>. Uhhh, so who am I, anyway? I love dogs and have an irrational fear of anthropomorphic food. What? It's creepy!</p> 
                   <p>Professionally, I'm an ENNIE Award-winning writer (I was one small part of the team that won 2022's Best Writing category). Mostly, I'm a big, old nerd who specializes in creating games and fiction. Do you like tabletop games? You must if you're here. Well, I've worked on a bunch of them! Do I love them? So. Much. Let's be friends! You can find me on-</p>

                   <p>After they walked through that glowing gateway, nothing was ever the same. A band of characters become paranormal investigators in order to figure out the cause of a global amnesic episode. Their quest takes them to lands near, far, and outside reality altogether. Along the way, the characters meet fellow "gatewalkers," defeat alien monsters, and explore strange realms also touched by the so-called Missing Moment. And when it comes time to learn the grim truth of what happened to them on that fated summer night, what then?</p>

You’re all veterans of adventure to some degree—not yet legendary heroes of myth whose names are whispered throughout the galaxy, but far from novices taking their first few steps into a wider world. However, like the rest of the galaxy, none of you has dealt with such a wide-reaching catastrophe as the Drift Crisis. Several months have passed since the Drift Crash began the upheaval, and speculation has run rampant on infospheres throughout the Pact Worlds and Veskarium about its causes and remedies. Will answers ever emerge? Can the Drift be restored to what it once was? Or are these throttled Drift travel times and constant interruptions in communications and shipping the new normal for every sapient being that relies on this form of faster-than-light travel?</p>

                   <p>Out in Razmiran, Pathfinder agents have begun to vanish, leaving Venture-Captain Narsen anxious about his position not only within the country, but also within the Pathfinder Society. These murders have been happening at the hands of a mysterious vampire, leading investigators deep into the Exalted Wood. It’s up to a group of Pathfinders to travel into the woods, find the killer, and solve the murders—all while Razmiri politics play in the background. A strange possible ally awaits you, along with all of the answers you may or may not want!</p>

Some of Alyreha’s old enemies infiltrated her home and set off all the defenses, so now it’s up to the Pathfinder Society to help her clear them out while she refortifies her home and magic. However, it looks like someone very familiar to the Pathfinders may be waiting up in the tower…</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>It's a new creative team, a new party of Iconics, new lands of Golarion to explore, and unforgettable moments galore in the brand-new adventure. Paizo and Dynamite are teaming up once more to offer not only a thrilling tale, but also extra features that players can bring right to their next game nights! It's been nearly five years since the last major <em>Pathfinder</em> saga in comics, the critically acclaimed Spiral of Bones from writer Crystal Frasier. Since then, the world of Pathfinder in-game and in real world popularity has exploded even more. With recent record-smashing sales of sourcebooks and more, it's the perfect time for fans of the game to experience this classic alternate avenue of adventure!</p> 
                   <p>"I'm thrilled to be back writing <em>Pathfinder</em> comics, and even more exciting to be writing a whole new party of Iconics meeting and adventuring together for the very first time," said writer Fred Van Lente.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p> In <em>Wake the Dead</em>, the tantalizing prospect of a rendezvous with a Gebbite defector in possession of priceless secrets from that undead nation draws together a diverse group of adventurers in the Nexian metropolis of Ecanus. Van Lente has assembled an all-new party, spotlighting Iconics who, before now, have only graced the four-colored pages as guest stars. Readers will get to hang out with Quinn the investigator, Sajan the monk, Lem the bard, and Seelah the champion, while readers of the original hit series by writer Jim Zub and others get reacquainted with Harsk the dwarf ranger! When they all find themselves cornered by the city's remorseless Deathsealers, can the Iconics band together for survival and escape a city full of hostile wizards alive? </p> 
                   <p>Fred Van Lente has been playing tabletop RPGs for years, going back to the classic "red box" basic sets, which he received as a kid like many his age. Eventually, he was introduced to the world of <em>Pathfinder</em> and played regularly for years. Recently, he wrote the epic comic spotlighting Fumbus the alchemist, available initially on Kickstarter. He's been contributing prose stories to the mythos on the Paizo site for a while too. Beyond the world of roleplaying, Van Lente is beloved for his work on hallmark comics titles like <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>, <em>Incredible Hercules</em>, <em>Marvel Zombies</em>, <em>Archer &amp; Armstrong</em>, <em>The Comic Book History of Comics</em>, and more.</p>

                   <p>For this new series, Van Lente is joined by artist Eman Casallos, who will bring his dungeon master-esque storytelling to the page. Artists Steve Ellis and Biago d'Alessandro also contribute covers to issues, in addition to Casallos. d'Allesandro's covers for each issue of the series will also connect to form a larger image when collected together.</p> 
                   <p>Each issue of <em>Pathfinder: Wake the Dead</em> features premium cardstock covers, making a top tier product for collectors and something durable that will survive the rigors of the gaming table. Issues also come with bonus material useful for players of the game. These will include playable character stats for the iconic paladin Seelah, new character options for inhabitants of the magical military city of Ecanus, and more. And all of these extra features are officially sanctioned by the <a href="">Pathfinder Society</a>!</p> 
                   <p>Paizo and tabletop fans can stay tuned too, as the first ever <em>Starfinder</em> comic series is right around the corner too! More information about that series will be revealed soon!</p>

                   <p>I got into this whole TTRPG writing thing by answering an open call for writers of color, which is not the kind of thing I can advise when a lot of people I know ask me how to get into this. It's something I think about a lot, how I sometimes feel like I've gotten more chances as a writer lately because I can answer these specialized calls for people who come from specific backgrounds. It's taken me months to come to terms with that possibility of having my own privileges recently as the creative world tries to diversify its talents. And it's been especially complicated for me as someone who spent her formative years living with a white European father in a nicer city than people with my skin color often do. </p> 
                   <p>But I think these days I've finally learned that these opportunities are important because they're the kinds of opportunities that my mother's family couldn't have had years ago, and that my dad as an immigrant never had the luxury of being offered either. So I'm here, I'm creating fantasies and cultures in a world as diverse as our own. And I'm proud to call myself a Black writer or a Mixed writer or whatever other adjectives need to be thrown in front of there to remind myself that I'm here building a name for myself and my family going forward. And I can be proud of the fact that I get to have opportunities that people like myself would have never had in generations before me.</p> 
                   <p>If you want to find more of me, my Twitter is a <a href="">@wozenstein</a>, and you can always keep an eye out for more Paizo work from me in the future.</p>

                   <h3>Shan Wolf (he/they)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone, I am a freelance game designer and contributing author on both the Pathfinder and Starfinder lines. My credits include <em>Starfinder Bounty #4: Poacher’s Prize</em>, the Adventure Toolbox for book 1 of the Starfinder Drift Hackers Adventure Path, the <em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em> hardcover, the Adventure Toolbox for book 2 of the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, and the upcoming <em>Lost Omens Highhelm</em> sourcebook. My primary focus as a writer is in Black and Indigenous liberation narratives, monster creation, archetype creation, history and lore, and writing revolutionary and inherently anti-colonialist themes.</p> 
                   <p>Besides all that, I am a huge Pathfinder and Starfinder booster. I love these games as they help bring to life amazing fantasies about being heroes and saving the world, or universe, and that is always something I’m interested in doing, or just talking about in general.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested in my work, or hearing my views, feel free to take a look at my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Fenrirs_Chosen">@Fenrirs_Chosen</a> and you will see an outspoken and passionate advocate for Black liberation, and making the tabletop space more open, safe, and inclusive. <br> </p>

                   <h3>Erin Roberts (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Happy Black History Month, y'all! I'm Erin and in addition to being a prose writer and a creative writing teacher, I've been a freelancer for Paizo for a couple of years—how time flies! I've written for a few Lost Omens books, bringing things like Impossible Cake (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>), the Tunwalkers (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>), reflections on time from the Ladies of Shadow tea and assassination guild (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Travel Guide</em>), and a look at the artists and buildings of Golarion (<em>Travel Guide</em>) to their pages. I've also had fun in space, writing a bounty (<em>Starfinder Bounty #3: A Green Place</em>) and adding to vlaka lore (<em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>).</p> 
                   <p>Outside of the Paizoverse, I’ve written for D&amp;D (<em>Journeys Through The Radiant Citadel</em>), World of Darkness (<em>Hunter: The Reckoning Fifth Edition</em>) and several awesome 3PP and indie projects (including <em>Anansi’s Tapestry of Lives</em> and <em>Moonlight on Roseville Beach</em>). What’s next? I’m a game writer for a future Foundry VTT project and you can catch my freelance work in projects like <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Firebrands</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Highhelm</em>, and other fun places not yet revealed by the mythical powers that be. I also chat with a bunch of writing folks every week as one of the hosts of the <em>Writing Excuses</em> podcast, new every Sunday. I usually share whatever shenanigans I'm up to next on Twitter at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/nirele">@nirele</a>, so feel free to follow me there!</p>

                   <h3>Infinite, the OGL, and You</h3> 
                   <p>Both Paizo and DriveThruRPG have received a lot of questions in the last month, mostly about how potential changes to the Open Game License might affect the Infinite marketplaces. I wanted to take this opportunity to address these both for creators and consumers. </p> 
                   <p>There have been no changes to the Open Game License, and creators can continue to publish material on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite under OGL version 1.0a, as has always been the case.</p> 
                   <p>At some point in the future, Paizo will transition to publishing under the forthcoming Open RPG Creative license (ORC) being developed by Azora Law. At that time, we may require publishers on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite to do the same but will provide notice and guidance to the community when we have more information.</p> 
                   <p>In the meantime, it’s business as usual.</p> 
                   <p>As the Pathfinder and Starfinder player bases grow in the light of renewed interests in the brands, community content programs like Infinite are going to be that much more important. We can’t wait to see what amazing content you all come up with.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">We recently updated our <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/faq">Starfinder FAQ and Errata</a> with a slew of new entries! You can see all these errata entries by expanding their dropdown, and they’re also fully searchable using the search bar at the top of the page.</p> 
                   <p>These updates include some necessary errata for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w"><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em></a>, including updated rules for Devastating Throw and Draconic Shot. Game Masters will want to read the new rules on the crush special ability from <em>Alien Archive</em>. And a bunch of gear has been changed to bring it in line with our other options, including thasphalt firearms, xenolash whips being a bit less oppressive in play, and a clarification that caustoject weapons can inject biohacks!</p> 
                   <p>There’s also a major change to how weapon fusions work, changing the previous 24-hour cycle time on swapping these out to only 10 minutes. The team discussed it, and we realized that these were inhibiting the use of fusion seals in most games and especially in Organized Play, so we’ve adjusted these rules to be far more accommodating.</p> 
                   <p>There are other changes and, as always, we welcome more questions, comments, and feedback on our Rules Questions <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/rules">forums</a>. Also, feel free to discuss all these errata entries right here on the blog!</p> 
                   <p>Special thanks to our Organized Play Program for highlighting many of these ongoing issues, and stay tuned to our blog for updates concerning the legality of these new options.</p>

                   <p>There are seven Starfinder Society Scenarios that directly influence the Year of Fortune’s Fall metaplot. Like last year, each will be marked with a special metaplot icon on the cover.</p> 
                   <p>The Year of Fortune’s Fall metaplot kicks off with <em>Starfinder Society Intro: Year of Fortune’s Fall</em>, an adventure for 1st- to 4th-level characters written by Mahpiya. This exciting scenario is centered on a gala celebration hosted by the Grand Museum of Qabarat on Castrovel. This scenario debuts at PaizoCon 2023, alongside one other Starfinder Society Scenario.</p> 
                   <p>With the launch of Year 6, the following species will become “always available” for Organized Play: gnoll, hanakan, kiirinta, quorlu, raxilite, and shimreen. Four other species will become purchasable with Achievement Points: kobold, psyacnoid, scyphozoan, and uplifted bear. Additionally, many species that were showcased in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e2c?Starfinder-Interstellar-Species"><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em></a>, such as contemplative and urog, will have their AcP cost reduced.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, I'm pleased to announce that candidates for the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si69?Ehu-Hadif-s-Mandate-Fulfilled-First-Seeker">First Seeker election</a> have been selected. We’re excited to reveal these candidates and their ambitious goals in the near future. Stay tuned!</p> 
                   <p>Take care, Starfinders! May fortune favor you.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <h2>The Replacement of Ehu Hadif</h2> 
                   <p>Two weeks ago, the deadline for First Seeker Candidates officially passed! Our submissions for this event are now closed.</p> 
                   <p>We had a total of 95 candidates submitted to be the new First Seeker, which is incredible! The most represented species were androids, vesk, humans, halflings and skittermanders. At press time, we’re still selecting the final candidates for the election. Once we’ve made our choices and contacted the winners, we’ll be sure to email everybody who submitted to inform them. I can’t wait to announce the candidates!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Rules Updates</h2> 
                   <h3>Orcs in Organized Play</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7z">As we announced two weeks ago</a>, in honor of the upcoming ORC License, orcs are now a freely available player ancestry in Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! For Pathfinder (second edition), the boon has been retired, and a free resurrection has been added to previously-purchased boons. We did the same thing when we made leshys freely available in 2021, so we’re delighted to provide this benefit now. In Starfinder Society, previously-created orcs may use the boon to take a +2 bonus to any one stat, as described in the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq#admittance-boon-always-available">Starfinder Society FAQ</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Any players who purchased these boons in January of 2023, prior to this change, may request a refund of their Achievement Points by emailing orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com. Boons purchased before January 1 will not be refunded.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, despite the ambiguity in the initial announcement, orcs will <b>not</b> be a playable race in Pathfinder Society (first edition). While we appreciate the community’s enthusiasm, the depiction of orcs in first edition content does not reflect our current values. Our portrayal of this ancestry has evolved over the years, and their initial presentation as aggressive, callous, and domineering isn’t something we want to encourage in our Organized Play programs. I offer my personal apologies for the lack of clarity in the first announcement; I wrote it very quickly during a very busy time without fully considering the implications, and I won’t make that mistake again.</p> 
                   <h3>Dragonkin in Starfinder Society</h3> 
                   <p>Recently, we were made aware that while most dragonkin choose to form a partner bond, canonically it’s not required. Additionally, asking players to choose their dragonkin’s partner from character creation presents a burden to newer players, or those who want to tell the story of forming that bond with a fellow adventurer.</p> 
                   <p>As a result, we’re updating the SFS rules on dragonkin to read as follows, effective immediately:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>When you create a dragonkin character, you may select another player’s character to form your partner bond with. Mark down that character’s Organized Play number on your character sheet. If that character is permanently slain, then you can select a new partner bond by marking a new Organized Play number on your character sheet between sessions.</p> 
                    <p>A dragonkin adventurer may choose not to form a partner bond, or they may choose to form one later in their adventuring career. Once a partner is selected, they may not be replaced unless they are permanently slain.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <h3>Starfinder Society 1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</h3> 
                   <p>One last treat for the Starfinder community! Our multi-table interactive specials are some of the most sought-after scenarios, and they often serve as a draw for conventions around the world. Recently we’ve been allowing the special to be replayed a limited number of times, but when our first Starfinder interactive was released, this was not the case. Based on community feedback, we’re happy to correct this.</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion">Starfinder Society Special 1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</a></em> may now be played or GMed <b>twice</b>, one in each level range (1-4 and 5-8). This means you can earn a total of four Chronicle Sheets if you play and GM the special twice at different tiers. As always, a character may not have multiple chronicle sheets from the same adventure. This text will be added to the product page immediately; due to production timelines, it is unlikely to be added to the PDF anytime soon, but it is on our list to update.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested in taking advantage of this immediately, the play-by-post community will be offering the special at their upcoming convention, <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43qhj?ANNOUNCING-PlaybyPostDiscord-Outpost-VI">Outpost VI</a>!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> 
                   <h3>New Content</h3> 
                   <p>This month saw the release of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dsn"><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em></a> Adventure Path compilation, and with it, the sanctioning for the adventure! Much like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Abomination-Vaults"><em>Abomination Vaults</em></a>, the chronicle sheets and boons are nearly identical to those published with the first printings. Otherwise, it’s been a quiet month for new content! Work is underway on sanctioning <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault"><em>Treasure Vault</em></a>, which should be ready for street date next month. After that we’re hoping to get starting on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Firebrands"><em>Lost Omens: Firebrands</em></a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy2?Starfinder-Adventure-Drift-Crisis-Case-Files"><em>Drift Crisis Case Files</em></a> for Starfinder, and are starting to eye up the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftHackers"><em>Drift Hackers</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/gatewalkers"><em>Gatewalkers</em></a> Adventure Paths.</p> 
                   <h3>Age of Ashes</h3> 
                   <p>Three years ago, we posted our sanctioning documents for the first Adventure Path for Pathfinder second edition: <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes">Age of Ashes</a>. Completing this document was actually one of my first tasks as a brand-new Paizo employee! As a reward for completing the various volumes of this adventure, players were granted new boons which unlocked various character options.</p> 
                   <p>As it’s been three years, we thought it was time to open these up a little further. Players may now spend their Achievement Points on brand-new boons to unlock certain options from the Age of Ashes Adventure Path! These boons unlock the uncommon character options that haven’t already been printed in other rulebooks. The full text of the boons is available on the Pathfinder FAQ page. Enjoy the new content!</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder Beginner Box</h3> 
                   <p>When the <a href="">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> was released, our hope was that it would be used as-is to introduce players to both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Pathfinder Society. As such, we sanctioned it with specific rules regarding character creation, and we provided an extra Achievement Point incentive to run it.</p> 
                   <p>Now that it’s out of its initial release, it’s clear that while it’s great for introducing players to Pathfinder, the players who come to us for Pathfinder Society are more interested in exploring other options. As such, we’re updating the sanctioning rules. The Beginner Box is now sanctioned <b>fully in campaign mode</b>, meaning that players may bring any characters the GM permits to play the adventure. These can be characters built using the Beginner Box rules, but do not have to be. Additionally, while it will remain repeatable, we’ll be reducing the Achievement Point reward to the normal value: 4 for players and 8 for GMs. We hope this better serves the community’s needs!</p> 
                   <p>To anticipate the question, we won’t be making the same change for the Starfinder Beginner Box. Due to the significantly altered ruleset in this product, it wouldn’t be feasible to expect a standard Starfinder character to be any easier to use in the Beginner Box.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Nova for SFS.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Marcel de Groot</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>This month we began recruiting volunteers for major conventions! Applications are now open for <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7u?Call-to-Volunteer-PaizoCon-Online-2023">PaizoCon Online</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7x?Call-to-Volunteer-Gen-Con-Indy-2023">Gen Con Indianapolis</a>. If you’re interested in GMing at either of these shows, we’d love to have you!</p> 
                   <p>We’ve also got a calendar full of <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">local conventions</a> around the world, which you should check out to see what’s happening in your area! This month I’m excited to attend <a href="https://www.dundracon.com/"><b>DunDraCon</b></a> in Santa Clara, California and <a href="https://gamergirlgames.com/"><b>GenghisCon</b></a> in Denver, Colorado. Getting to meet the local communities is one of the best parts of my job, so if you’re near either of those shows, come out and say hi!</p> 
                   <p>Okay, that’s quite enough from me. Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! and go play some orcs!</p>

                   <blockquote> 
                    <p itemprop="description">“Whoa, you’re here already? Are you the Magaambya delegation or the group from the Pathfinder Society? Either way, one moment.”</p> 
                    <p>The white-scaled kobold snatches a bandolier off a nearby hook and hurriedly fills its pouches with a variety of rune-covered daggers from a nearby weapons rack. </p> 
                    <p>“This is the weapons vault, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. Normally I’d have greeted you before you got this far, but Ziik’s having a little bit of a rat problem and the boss says if the ratcatcher can’t deal with the rats himself, then he should probably just let the rats eat him so she can find a better ratcatcher.”</p> 
                    <p>With the bandolier filled with weapons slung over her shoulder, the little kobold quickly tucks a variety of other items into her kilt pockets before thrusting one tiny hand into the air seeking a handshake.</p> 
                    <p>“Name’s Purepurin. I’m the steward of the vaults, and it’s my job to keep the items clean, the inventory logs up to date, and the ratcatchers uneaten. Please follow me for the time being and, uh, stay about ten feet back and try really hard not to step in front of me if it looks like I’m pointing at something.”</p> 
                    <p>Instructions complete, Purepurin quickly leads the way through a twisting series of tunnels. The farther the little kobold gets from the weapons vault, the louder and angrier a constant, chittering squeal becomes, a rising crescendo of rodent clicks and cries. Purepurin holds up a hand as she reaches a sharp corner, the dancing light of distant torches indicating a much larger room just around it.</p> 
                    <p>“Ziik really is a good ratcatcher, you know.” Purepurin calmly runs her fingers across the hilts of the daggers sheathed in her bandolier until her grip settles on a ghastly blade, its hilt wrapped in what appears to be the dead gray skin of some humanoid creature. She draws it carefully. “The problem is that sometimes one of the really smart rats nibbles through the protective fulus and gets ahold of an item in the special vaults that turns it into something that’s just a little bit too much for your average kobold. Case in point…”</p> 
                    <p>Purepurin’s gesture to peek around the corner leads to a truly horrific sight: hundreds of black-furred, white-tailed, red-eyed rats swarm around a large stone well with a wooden steeple. Perched atop the steeple is a lone elderly kobold, desperately fending off the occasional encroaching rodent with a gnarled walking stick. Seething through the furry hordes, a slick wet mass displaces rats like a leviathan shedding water as a rodent of unprecedented size emerges. Still-smoking scars and other remnants of recent battles indicate that the monstrous creature has mounted several unsuccessful attempts to devour the stranded ratcatcher, whose panicked expression seems to indicate that he has no more tricks sufficient to stall the beast.</p> 
                    <p>With a quick wink, Purepurin hurls her dagger into the middle of the roiling mass of rats, skewering one with a single flick of her wrist. The other rats around the skewered target begin to squeal and scatter as a foul stench emanates from the slain rodent. As the smaller rats choke and disperse, Purepurin calmly walks into the relatively clear space, drawing an item from her pocket. The oversized rat turns toward the new challenger, placing its back to the old kobold and the well upon which he perches. With a wicked grin, Purepurin levels what looks to be an elaborate seashell at the rat.</p> 
                    <p>“Bang.”</p> 
                    <p>A geyser of twisting water suddenly erupts from the “seashell,” slamming into the rat monster with enough force to send the creature up and over the edge of the well and down into its murky depths. Wasting no time, Purepurin gestures furiously for assistance, chasing rats away from a heavy, steel-shod wooden cover clearly intended for the well. With some assistance from Ziik and the visitors, Purepurin seals the well, the rat monster apparently unable to climb up quickly enough to secure its escape. The old ratcatcher, Ziik, grumbles about needing to march all the way to vault 47 for clean water. As he places protective paper talismans around the edge of the well, Purepurin recovers her thrown dagger and smiles widely.</p> 
                    <p>“Too much for the <em>average</em> kobold, but not for yours truly!” Purepurin calmly waves a beckoning claw as she exits the room through a different doorway than the one she used to enter. “If you think that was scary, wait’ll you meet the boss!”</p>

                   <h3>Thrower’s Bandolier — Item 3</h3> 
                   <p><b>Conjuration, Invested, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 60 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> worn; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>This bandolier is covered in straps and pouches capable of holding up to 2 Bulk of one-handed thrown weapons. A <em>thrower's bandolier</em> has a <em>+1 weapon potency rune</em> etched into it, and it can be etched with runes as though it were a one-handed thrown weapon. When you invest the <em>thrower’s bandolier</em>, you can attune it to all the weapons sheathed in it (this ends any previous attunements made with the bandolier). Whenever you draw a weapon from the bandolier, the bandolier's runes are replicated onto that weapon. Any runes already on the weapon are suppressed, and any runes previously replicated to a different weapon in this way are removed, returning it to normal.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] envision, Interact; <b>Effect</b> All weapons attuned to the bandolier, not including any weapons you're currently wielding, return to the bandolier.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Ghast Stiletto — Item 3</h3> 
                   <p><b>Magical, Necromancy</b><br> <b>Price</b> 60 gp <br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>A ghast stiletto is a <em>+1 dagger</em> wrapped in the still-undead skin of a ghast. While you wield the dagger, you gain a +1 status bonus to all saves against paralysis.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] command, Interact (divine, necromancy, olfactory); <b>Frequency</b> once per hour; <b>Effect</b> The <em>ghast stiletto</em> afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. For the next minute, the target creature, as well as any creatures within a 10-foot emanation, must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the emanation, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p> 
                   <p><b>Craft Requirements</b> The initial raw materials must include skin from a ghast.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Torrent Spellgun (Lesser) — Item 3</h3> 
                   <p><b>Attack, Consumable, Evocation, Magical, Spellgun, Water</b><br> <b>Price</b> 12 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activate</b> [two-actions] Interact, Strike</p> 
                   <p>Carved of seashell, a <em>torrent spellgun</em> is damp to the touch, and seaweed wraps around its grip. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target’s AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun blasts a powerful jet of water that deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, then disintegrates into sand.</p> 
                   <p><b>Critical Success</b> The target takes double damage and is knocked back 10 feet.</p> 
                   <p><b>Success</b> The target takes full damage and is knocked back 5 feet.</p>

                   <p>When Gatewalkers architect Patrick Renie hit me up to write for this AP, I didn’t think I had time. Then I heard the pitch, and I made time. As the author of the Pathfinder First Edition Campaign Settings <em>The First World</em> and <em> Distant Worlds</em>, as well as a former Starfinder Creative Director, I've always been a sucker for Pathfinder’s fey realm and other planets, and the chance to write an adventure that visits both was simply irresistible. As soon as I finished writing, I immediately turned around and launched my own Gatewalkers campaign, and I hope your group does as much laughing and screaming as ours!</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested in checking out more of my TTRPG work, you can find it at <a href="http://jameslsutter.com">jameslsutter.com</a> —but my big release this year is actually a young adult romance novel! <em>Darkhearts</em> is a queer rom-com all about falling in love with the boy who stole your chance at rock stardom, and you can <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59828970-darkhearts">preorder it now</a>!</p>

                   <p>Hi, folks! I'm Jason Keeley, game developer person and author of the second volume of the Gatewalkers Adventure Path. I'm a big fan of "weird stuff" in adventures, so I was happy to contribute to an Adventure Path that is thematically linked to the "weird stuff" book, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive"><em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></a>. Moreso than any other adventure I've written for Paizo, “They Watched the Stars” is a bit of a road trip, so I got to include a bunch of strange vignettes the players can encounter on their way from point A to point B.</p> 
                   <p>I would love to tell you more, but I don't want to spoil the surprises in store. I will say that one of my favorite bits is the initial encounter with a halfling ghost pirate captain and the new construct I designed that protects their derelict ship. How's that for a tease? If you want to talk about more weird stuff with me, you can find me on Twitter @herzwesten. And maybe check out my free game about cereal mascots, <a href="https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast"><em>This Compleat Breakfast</em></a>, available on itch.io here!</p>

                   <p>Hi there! I’m James Jacobs, one of Paizo’s creative directors and the author of the Gatewalkers finale! I came to this project pretty late in the process but was delighted to join forces with “TEAM J.” The plot of Gatewalkers—with its ties to elves, aliens, and conspiracies—was really up my alley, but particularly the last adventure that heads into the frozen north. Horror and cold go together perfectly, and being able to dive into inspirations like Lovecraft’s <em>At the Mountains of Madness</em>, John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em>, and the quest for the Northwest Passage in Dan Simmons’s <em>The Terror</em> was a blast to say the least, as well as drawing inspiration from real-world explorations like Shackleton’s search for the south pole. And finally, extra thanks to Michael Sayre for help and for getting things started with the heart of this particular story; I hope I did it justice!</p>

                    <p>“It’s not even a real garden,” she complained to no one in particular. “Why do they even call it that?” She took a seat on a decorative boulder, nursing her hangover from the night before, one she had yet to even sleep off. It made every merry tweet and call from the countless birds grate on her ears like sharp wire. “Oh, we <em>have</em> to sneak out for Longnight, they said. It’s <em>completely different</em> in the Foreign Quarter, they said. Master Shaine will <em>never know</em>, they said. Cowards. Didn’t even show up, and now I’m the one with extra chores.” </p>

                    <p>She gave a brief snort. She’d been so sure that she’d been utterly silent when returning from the revelry of Longnight, but even as she surreptitiously crawled back into the initiate barracks, there Kreighton Shaine had been, sitting right on the other side of the open window. As initiates were not allowed off the grounds of the Grand Lodge except with permission, she had expected a scolding. What she got instead was a series of impromptu haiku, about <em>birds</em> of all things. And just when she thought the eccentric Dean of the Scrolls was going to let her off without even a warning, she was assigned to tend to… this. Alone. </p> 
                    <p>Nixret sighed again as she looked at the countless birds before her. Usually, it took half a dozen initiates to tend to a <em>garden of wonder</em>. All alone, the exhausted kobold dragged herself off her rock and began to collect feathers from the ground. </p> 
                    <p>The Scrollmaster, strange as he could be at times, was always very clear that the materials gathered from the gardens were to be carefully collected and sorted, as Pathfinder agents being sent out on missions would often receive them as gifts to help keep them safe. As she methodically picked up feather after molted feather, her thoughts turned to two and a half years ago, when Nixret, starry-eyed, had dreamed of being one of those adventurers. She’d left the Sewer Dragons to join the Society, practically shouting to the other kobolds that she’d become a legend by the time they saw her again. </p> 
                    <p>She chuckled to herself, picking a golden feather from the floor. “I expected danger and discovery, not lectures and chores. Yet here I am, cleaning up after a flock of enchanted birds.” She shook her head, though immediately regretted the act thanks to her headache. “Hardly the work of a hero-to-be.” </p> 
                    <p>Still. She knew that the agents really did depend on these materials, and even though the task was tedious, she did not want to let them down. After all, within the coming year she would have her own initiation, and then, finally, she would be the one on heroic adventures, her name read across the lands in one of the Chronicles.</p> 
                    <p>Perhaps, though, until then she’d think twice about sneaking out. Master Shaine might be permissive, but he also has an infuriating tendency to be exactly where you least expect to find him. And tending to squawking birds while hungover was worse than any angry lecture she could have imagined.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Heya!</p> 
                   <p>So, people have asked me “Will Pathfinder Society players get to use the Gardens of Wonder from Pathfinder Treasure Vault? The answer is “You already have been the entire time!” In PFS, every character gets some free consumables for each adventure, usually from the Pathfinder school they’re associated with (Scrolls, Spells, or Swords). These consumables don’t carry over between adventures and are provided so that adventuring Pathfinders always have a little something extra beyond their standard kit, essentially drawing from Gardens built and funded by the Pathfinder Society. The expiration date and non-transferrable nature of the consumables help encourage PCs to use them rather than selling them into the “weapon upgrade slush fund” or holding onto them so long that they pass the level range in which the items would be most useful.</p> 
                   <p>What this all means is that Pathfinder Society players got Gardens of Wonder way before everyone else! “But Mike,” you say, “School consumables in PFS last the whole session and Garden of Wonder consumables last a day, how could these be the same thing?” The answer is that the limitations on how long the consumables last is something that every GM can, and should, feel free to adjust for their players based on the type of game they run. PFS consumables essentially last for “one 4-hour gaming session”, a unit of measurement that’s standardized for organized play, but which doesn’t necessarily work with the playstyles or gaming sensibilities of every home group. If the way PFS handles things fits the adventures you run better than the default presented, use it! They’re the same concept with the same goals, just tailored for different purposes. Don’t be afraid to make the game your own! </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Happy New Releases Day! Many of you may have a new or renewed interest in Pathfinder and Starfinder, so I’d like to tell you about all our new open gaming products, including subscriptions and special offers, and point you toward what’s coming next!</p> 
                   <p>You will find our <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/releases">Release Schedule</a> here, with products listed month-by-month, along with associated subscriptions. It’s a great way to plan the future of your games.</p> 
                   <p>Also, you can explore our 14 <a href="https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions">Paizo Subscriptions</a> and see what we’re releasing up to 9 months out. Like crowdfunding campaigns, by committing in advance, subscriptions help us estimate print runs, so we incentivize you to subscribe with a complimentary PDF. Ownership of a digital product lets you sync with our digital partners, who can then also offer a discount on their products and services. If you’re interested in multiple subscriptions, you can save more with our Paizo Advantage offering.</p> 
                   <p>Subscriptions are important us, but so are game and bookstores, and we know they’re important to you, too. We already have a great list of retailers who’ve opted into our <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/locator">Where to Buy page</a>, but now is a great time to help the list grow! Feel free to ask your favorite local game or bookstore about their programs and see if they’re interested in joining our list.</p> 
                   <p>So, what’s new? You can find the list of <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43qf9?New-Physical-Product-Releases-in-January">New Physical Product Releases</a> in January in our Forum Announcements channel. These announcements happen monthly and let you know when your card will be charged and when shipping starts. By the way, we now take American Express and are exploring non-credit card options.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hi everyone, Roll for Combat Director of Game Design Mark Seifter here! 2023 has already been a wild year for Roll for Combat and the entire RPG industry, but it’s also the start of something exciting: the <a href="https://battlezoo.com/products/year-of-monsters-pdf?variant=40610707341412"><em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Year of Monsters</em></a>! With <em>Year of Monsters</em>, you can play a creative monster ancestry each month of 2023, plus receive a final compilation book as a capstone with additional content! </p> 
                   <p>The ancestries are demons, gremlins, intelligent weapons, dungeons expanded (you can get the original dungeon ancestry for free at <a href="https://battlezoo.com/products/free-item-battlezoo-ancestries-dungeons?variant=40493131694180">https://battlezoo.com/</a>), oni, nymphs, doppelgangers, minotaurs, slimes, sthenos, mimics, and sidhe. Each ancestry will receive at least twice as much content as a standard-size ancestry, such as those presented in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> or <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, and some of them have been expanded to add versatile heritages, double-length content, and more surprises! </p> 
                   <p>The <em>Year of Monsters</em> subscription comes with:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Thirteen ancestry PDFs—one for each ancestry, and then the expanded <em>Year of Monsters Compilation</em> book at the end of the year.</li> 
                    <li>The Foundry VTT module, which will automatically update itself 13 times with the latest ancestries throughout the year.</li> 
                    <li>Thirteen ancestry files for import into Pathbuilder 2e.</li> 
                    <li>No less than 21 digital assets for each ancestry.</li> 
                    <li>A private invitation to join our design team for special design streams, one per month for each ancestry, and have your ideas heard as we incorporate them into an expanded compilation at the end of the year. </li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>In addition to everything listed above, you can get the final compilation book in hardcover at <a href="https://battlezoo.com/products/battlezoo-ancestries-year-of-monsters-hardcover-pdf-vtt?variant=40610748465252">https://battlezoo.com/</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, while we still recommend the full experience with Foundry VTT integration and special design streams where you can join the design team for the ancestries and have us add your ideas, we also want to make <em>Year of Monsters</em> available and affordable to as many people as we can. To that end, we’ve worked with one of the Pathfinder 2e discord moderators, ink, to put out a special club aimed at new players and old who would like just the PDFs and digital assets of <em>Year of Monsters</em> for a lower price: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/10dxmgq/rpathfinder2e_group_event_battlezoo_digital/">the Battlezoo Digital Monsters Pledge</a>. The more people who pledge, the less expensive the Digital Monsters Pledge will be. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-QCE0F3Dk8R2n8SfPUS6GzrICa_qdJO5YJM-V-vdZDASwfw/viewform">Simply fill out the form here to commit to the pledge</a>!</p>

                   <p>First off, happy new year! We hope you enjoyed your holidays!</p> 
                   <p>This month we’re getting back to the Thuvian desert! A group of people have gathered around Star’s dig site, hoping to gain information from them or have Star ally with their organization. However, Aslynn has her eyes (and her spy!) set on taking Star as a new weapon and ally for her nefarious plans. It’s up to the Pathfinders to not only convince Star of their good intentions, but also to protect them when attacked by multiple villains!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Over the course of the last week, more than 1,500 tabletop RPG publishers, from household names going back to the dawn of the hobby to single proprietors just starting out with their first digital release, have joined together to pledge their support for the development of a universal system-neutral open license that provides a legal “safe harbor” for sharing rules mechanics and encourages innovation and collaboration in the tabletop gaming space. </p> 
                   <p>The alliance is gathered. Work has begun. </p> 
                   <p>It would take too long to list all the companies behind the ORC license effort, but we thought you might be interested to see a few of the organizations already pledged toward this common goal. We are honored to be allied with them, as well as with the equally important participating publishers too numerous to list here. Each is crucial to the effort’s success. The list below is but a representative sample of participating publishers from a huge variety of market segments with a huge variety of perspectives. But we all agree on one thing.</p>

                   <h2>Gen Con Indy 2023</h2> 
                   <p>Gen Con Indianapolis will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana from August 3-6, 2023. While we intend to participate in Gen Con Online, this application is <b>only</b> for the in-person show. New content at this show includes the launch of Pathfinder Society Year 5, the new Pathfinder Society Special and the second American run of the Starfinder Society interactive special, and new Starfinder Society scenarios (including your first chance to meet the new First Seeker Candidates). </p> 
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>Game Master</b>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties and Quests</li> 
                    <li><b>Headquarters (HQ)</b>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion</li> 
                    <li><b>Demo GM</b>: Run quick demos for new players, giving them a short Pathfinder/Starfinder experience before quickly turning the table over for the next group. Our Demo GMs may receive an Exhibitor badge in compensation for the fast and furious nature of the position, subject to availability.</li> 
                    <li><b>Academy GM</b>: Run games for young children (under 18) and their families and provide a safe, welcoming environment for our youngest gamers. This position requires proof of a completed background check.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the Gen Con Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <b>does not guarantee acceptance</b>; you will receive an email with further information from the Gen Con committee.</li> 
                    <li>Gen Con Indy schedules will be <b>assigned</b> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. The committee’s intention is to assign people to run the same scenario multiple times during the weekend. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li> 
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who don’t qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li> 
                    <li>Volunteers will be accepted on a rolling basis and schedules should be assigned within two weeks of your application. Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered to be committed to attending the event.</li> 
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out the volunteer form and then follow up by emailing genconleads@gmail.com. Please note we have a limited number of tables and the schedule is fairly locked-in at this stage, but we’ll do our best to get you slotted into your scenario if it’s on the schedule.</li> 
                    <li>Gen Con has indicated that they do not plan to have any mask or vaccination requirements for the event. They have also prevented us from enforcing a mask mandate within our spaces. We will work to ensure the safety of all our attendees as best we can under this policy. At this time we are still evaluating our options such as obtaining air purifiers, reducing player count to ensure safe distancing, and increasing the distance between tables. We will be sure to provide hand sanitizer and masks on-site for any who want them.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at genconleads@gmail.com.</li>

                   <h2>PaizoCon Online 2023</h2> 
                   <p>PaizoCon Online 2023 will take place online from May 26-30, 2023. We are not planning a physical component to the show at this time. New content at this show will include the launch of Starfinder Society Year 6, the new Starfinder Society interactive special, and new Pathfinder Society scenarios. </p> 
                   <p>We’re currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>Game Master</b>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties and Quests</li> 
                    <li><b>Headquarters (HQ)</b>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PaizoCon Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <b>does not guarantee acceptance</b>; you will receive an email with further information from the PaizoCon committee.</li> 
                    <li>Unlike previous PaizoCon Onlines, we will be assigning GMs to games based on their indicated preferences in the application form. There will not be a later signup date for GMs to select their games.</li> 
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li> 
                    <li>Applications will be processed on a rolling basis, beginning no later than <b>March 1</b>. The earlier you get your application in, the more likely it is you’ll get the scenarios you want. Please be patient as we put the final details on the convention internally before we send out GM emails!</li> 
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out this form and then follow up by emailing paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. Anybody interested in running games outside of the Organized Play offerings (such as Infinite content, homebrew content, or games from other publishers) should email paizocon@paizo.com for more information about scheduling your offerings.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com.</li> 
                   </ul>

                   <br> 
                   <p itemprop="description">For the last several weeks, as rumors of Wizards of the Coast’s new version of the Open Game License began circulating among publishers and on social media, gamers across the world have been asking what Paizo plans to do in light of concerns regarding Wizards of the Coast’s rumored plan to de-authorize the existing OGL 1.0(a). We have been awaiting further information, hoping that Wizards would realize that, for more than 20 years, the OGL has been a mutually beneficial license which should not–and cannot–be revoked. While we continue to await an answer from Wizards, we strongly feel that Paizo can no longer delay making our own feelings about the importance of Open Gaming a part of the public discussion. </p> 
                   <p>We believe that any interpretation that the OGL 1.0 or 1.0(a) were intended to be revocable or able to be deauthorized is incorrect, and with good reason.</p> 
                   <p>We were there.</p> 
                   <p>Paizo owner Lisa Stevens and Paizo president Jim Butler were leaders on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons team at Wizards at the time. Brian Lewis, co-founder of Azora Law, the intellectual property law firm that Paizo uses, was the attorney at Wizards who came up with the legal framework for the OGL itself. Paizo has also worked very closely on OGL-related issues with Ryan Dancey, the visionary who conceived the OGL in the first place. </p> 
                   <p>Paizo does not believe that the OGL 1.0a can be “deauthorized,” ever. While we are prepared to argue that point in a court of law if need be, we don’t want to have to do that, and we know that many of our fellow publishers are not in a position to do so. </p> 
                   <p>We have no interest whatsoever in Wizards’ new OGL. Instead, we have a plan that we believe will irrevocably and unquestionably keep alive the spirit of the Open Game License.</p> 
                   <p>As Paizo has evolved, the parts of the OGL that we ourselves value have changed. When we needed to quickly bring out Pathfinder First Edition to continue publishing our popular monthly adventures back in 2008, using Wizards’ language was important and expeditious. But in our non-RPG products, including our Pathfinder Tales novels, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and others, we shifted our focus away from D&amp;D tropes to lean harder into ideas from our own writers. By the time we went to work on Pathfinder Second Edition, Wizards of the Coast’s Open Game Content was significantly less important to us, and so our designers and developers wrote the new edition without using Wizards’ copyrighted expressions of any game mechanics. While we still published it under the OGL, the reason was no longer to allow Paizo to use Wizards’ expressions, but to allow other companies to use our expressions.</p> 
                   <p>We believe, as we always have, that open gaming makes games better, improves profitability for all involved, and enriches the community of gamers who participate in this amazing hobby. And so we invite gamers from around the world to join us as we begin the next great chapter of open gaming with the release of a new open, perpetual, and <em>irrevocable</em> <b>Open RPG Creative License (ORC)</b>.</p> 
                   <p>The new Open RPG Creative License will be built system agnostic for independent game publishers under the legal guidance of <a href="mailto:OpenRPG@azoralaw.com">Azora Law</a>, an intellectual property law firm that represents Paizo and several other game publishers. Paizo will pay for this legal work. We invite game publishers worldwide to join us in support of this system-agnostic license that allows all games to provide their own unique open rules reference documents that open up their individual game systems to the world. To join the effort and provide feedback on the drafts of this license, <a href="https://email.paizo.com/p/4XTJ-7AU/thank-you">please sign up by using this form</a>.</p> 
                   <p>In addition to Paizo, Kobold Press, Chaosium, Green Ronin, Legendary Games, Rogue Genius Games, and a growing list of publishers have already agreed to participate in the Open RPG Creative License, and in the coming days we hope and expect to add substantially to this group.</p> 
                   <p>The ORC will not be owned by Paizo, nor will it be owned by any company who makes money publishing RPGs. Azora Law’s ownership of the process and stewardship should provide a safe harbor against any company being bought, sold, or changing management in the future and attempting to rescind rights or nullify sections of the license. Ultimately, we plan to find a nonprofit with a history of open source values to own this license (such as the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>). </p> 
                   <p>Of course, Paizo plans to continue publishing Pathfinder and Starfinder, even as we move away from the Open Gaming License. Since months’ worth of products are still at the printer, you’ll see the familiar OGL 1.0(a) in the back of our products for a while yet. While the Open RPG Creative License is being finalized, we’ll be printing Pathfinder and Starfinder products without any license, and we’ll add the finished license to those products when the new license is complete. </p> 
                   <p>We hope that you will continue to support Paizo and other game publishers in this difficult time for the entire hobby. You can do your part by supporting the many companies that have provided content under the OGL. Support Pathfinder and Starfinder by visiting your local game store, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions">subscribing to Pathfinder and Starfinder</a>, or taking advantage of discount code <b>OpenGaming</b> during checkout for 25% off your purchase of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook">Core Rulebook</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026de?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook-Pocket-Edition">Core Rulebook Pocket Edition</a>, or <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a>.

                   <p>By Pete Zupan, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/">r/Pathfinder2e</a> mod and host of <em><a href="https://anchor.fm/rulelord2e/">Rise of the Rulelords</a></em><a href="https://anchor.fm/rulelord2e/"> podcast</a>.</p> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Paizo publishes more adventures, character options, and monsters for Pathfinder and Starfinder than many could play in a lifetime… </p> 
                   <p>But is it enough? </p> 
                   <p>There are more ideas about ways to experience Pathfinder than even Paizo can keep up with, and the PaizoVerse community has stepped up to fulfill those needs. Authors, including a growing number of Infinite Masters, are creating new classes, monsters, and adventures every day on Pathfinder Infinite. Plus, they’re empowered to expand on the Lost Omens setting in “what if-style,” non-canon ways. <a href="https://www.pf2events.com/about">Third Party Kon</a> wants to celebrate that.</p> 
                   <br>

                   <br> 
                   <p>With the success of events like Beginner Box Day, we saw the power of the community to rally around a game we love. Over 300 people and 60 GMs participated in the inaugural event, and since then, the r/Pathfinder2e subreddit has surpassed 55k members. The event couldn’t have succeeded without help from the community, nor could it prosper just on player zeal. Rather, the efforts of a dedicated group of content creators and publishers have helped bring the game to a wider audience, showing people how many other options are out there. As the PaizoVerse grows, so does the love of the game. More and more often, publishers are adding Pathfinder Second Edition as an option for their rulebooks and adventures, and platforms like Foundry VTT are joining in adding exclusive Pathfinder products like the deluxe Beginner Box module and Bestiary Tokens!</p> 
                   <p>Third Party Kon is a celebration of the PaizoVerse in all its forms. What is the ‘PaizoVerse’? It’s the growing collection of actual plays, bloggers, youtubers, podcasters, artists, and publishers who have made the hobby of playing Paizo-made games into a community. </p> 
                   <p>During the President's Day weekend:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>We’ll be airing a 24-hour stream of interviews from the best creators in the PaizoVerse and live plays of third party adventures from shows you know and love.</li>
                    <br> 
                    <li>Of course, no gaming convention would be complete without free game demos! During TPK, players and Game Masters will get to experience the breadth of community-created ancestries, classes, spells, weapons, monsters, settings, and adventures of third party content at no extra charge.</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p>Of course, we can’t do this without the participation of the PaizoVerse! TPK is accepting pitches to join our stream until <b>January 14th. The first round of demo materials will also be added starting January 21st</b>, so make sure your product is among the first that players see! Send your stuff to <a href="https://www.pf2events.com/creators">pf2events.com/creators</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Be part of the first PaizoVerse-run celebration! Make sure to join us for TPK, February 17 to 20, 2023 at <a href="https://www.pf2events.com/home">pf2events.com</a>, and join the largest group of Pathfinders at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/">reddit.com/r/pathfinder2e</a>.</p>

                   <p>In this Adventure Path, the player characters are gatewalkers—a term coined by a paranormal researcher named Dr. Ritalson studying this event. Your characters were touched by the event and exhibit strange new powers they didn’t possess before the Missing Moment. The campaign begins with the PCs accompanying the eccentric Dr. Ritalson to Sevenarches to investigate a potentially related event, but their actions and examinations soon set them on a far-flung path to get to the bottom of their forgotten months and its implications on the world.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hi folks! I'm Alex Speidel, Paizo's Organized Play Coordinator and now, apparently, a professional streaming GM. Today, I'm thrilled to announce our newest Starfinder actual play! <b>Starfinder Drift Crisis</b> is an eight-episode adventure in which four brave souls aboard the <em>Void Empress</em> experience the Drift Crash up close and personal. These heroes must work together to survive the first moments of the Drift Crisis and make it home alive. Along the way, they'll encounter mysterious creatures, haunting obstacles, and end up facing off against an influential foe</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>I was so excited to put this adventure together for you all, and I can't wait for you to see it. To whet your appetites, I wanted to share a couple of my goals with this liveplay.</p> 
                   <p>First of all, I wanted to make sure this series was approachable to as many people as possible. There are some TTRPG fans who aren't fully immersed in the world of Starfinder, so I tried my hardest to ensure that you don't need to know anything about the Pact Worlds to enjoy the story. Also, the episodes are about an hour each, so you don't have to devote hours of your time or worry about falling too far behind. My hope is that everyone from my parents to diehard Starfinder fans will be able to watch the series and have an awesome time.</p> 
                   <p>Second, I wanted to show off the tools GMs have available to them already. As a Paizo employee, I have access to some of the best artists and cartographers in the business, but I started as a Starfinder Society GM, frantically drawing maps with wet-erase markers on blank grids. As a result, aside from character artwork for our PCs, all the art you'll see is art you can use right now. Every map is a Paizo Flip-Mat, every NPC or enemy is pulled straight from an adventure or rulebook, and even the adventure pitch comes straight from the pages of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a>. My goal here is to show GMs that you don't need a fancy setup or hours and hours of free time to create your own campaign. We've provided everything you need to tell a story with your friends already!</p> 
                   <p>Before I go, I want to introduce you to our wonderful players! I'll let them introduce their characters in episode 1, so this is just a taste.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>ChelseaBytes</b> (she/her | <a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaBytes">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ChelseaBytes">Twitch</a>) brought such a fantastic energy to the group from the very start of session 0. I could immediately tell that she was going to be a leader for the group, and she quickly took charge in and out of character. I loved her character concept from the start, and anybody who has worked customer service will immediately relate to her.</li> 
                    <li><b>James Rodehaver</b> (he/him | <a href="https://twitter.com/EvilJimjam">Twitter</a>) will be a familiar face to fans of Dragons &amp; Things from the GM chair. As a player though, he brought something I never expected. If you're not absolutely ready to throw down for his character by the end of this adventure, I don't know what more I can do.</li> 
                    <li><b>London Carlisle</b> (he/him | <a href="https://twitter.com/LondonCarlisle">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.londoncarlisle.com/">Website</a>) was the first person to send me his character concept, and I knew we had a winner already. I think every group needs an anchor to keep things centered, and his smooth-talking, fast-thinking character is just the mix this group needed.</li> 
                    <li><b>Michelle Nguyen Bradley</b> (she/her | <a href="https://twitter.com/iamchubbybunny">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.michellenguyenbradley.com/">Website</a>) was the person I was most excited to play with, as I was most familiar with her work, and she knocked it out of the park. She took on the challenge of playing a brand-new class, and the absolute nonsense she got up to is unparalleled. I can't wait to be able to talk about the end of this campaign.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>I hope you'll join us for this wild ride on a nightmare cruise ship! I'll be posting insights from the GM chair after the episodes, so be sure to follow me on the social media platform of your choice for behind-the-scenes gossip. See you in the stars!</p>

                   <h2>Pathfinder Core Rulebook Errata</h2> 
                   <p>Earlier this week, the Rules &amp; Lore team announced a new errata policy, as well as posting some new changes to the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. Obviously these changes are going to affect Pathfinder Society play, so here’s how to handle them:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>All new rule changes in the 4th printing of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are in effect immediately. </li>
                    <li><em>Dust of disappearance</em> has been made uncommon. Any character who previously purchased the item may keep it. It will be added to the Avid Collector - Core Rulebook boon for future purchases and characters.</li> 
                    <li>The horse animal companion rules have been updated, and apply immediately. Any character who no longer wants a horse animal companion may freely change their animal companion to a new animal. Retraining out of an animal companion entirely follows the normal rules for retraining.</li> 
                    <li>The alchemist class updates provide a number of changes and upgrades. Any alchemists built under the old rules can freely retrain their research field and any feats except those that specifically prohibit doing so (such as lineage feats). Any items purchased with gold can be sold back for the full purchase price. Retraining out of the alchemist class entirely can only be done with the normal retraining rules.</li> 
                    <li>The <em>Core Rulebook</em> now allows all characters to take two free ability boosts instead of the printed options for their ancestry. Newly created characters in Pathfinder Society may use this rule; previously built characters may not unless they rebuild the character from scratch with a boon. </li> 
                    <li>However, to retain the legality of numerous existing characters, the Pathfinder Society campaign will continue to offer the Voluntary Flaws optional ruleset and retain the text within the Guide to Organized Play.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Once again, these changes go into effect immediately. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we missed any updates that you’re not sure how to handle!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>The Replacement of Ehu Hadif</h2> 
                   <p>This is your final reminder that if your character is <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si69?Ehu-Hadif-s-Mandate-Fulfilled-First-Seeker">interested in becoming the new First Seeker</a>, time is running out! The deadline to purchase the First Seeker Candidate boon and send in your information is <b>January 16, 2023</b>. This is a hard deadline; after this date, submissions will be closed and we’ll begin to review the candidates and make decisions.</p>

                   <h2>Toys of Boundless Wonder</h2> 
                   <p>Last month, multiple regions and local game stores came together for our Toys of Boundless Wonder event to play games and boost donations for Toys for Tots. The event was a smash success, with over 60 tables during the two-week event and 18 simultaneous tables playing this year’s Pathfinder Society Special! There’s a full writeup <a href="https://leagueofaroden.com/2022/12/18/toys-of-boundless-wonder-2022-grand-report/">on the League of Aroden site</a>, which I encourage you all to check out, but I wanted to include some photos here.

                   <p>Last month, we posted boons to unlock various character options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/bloodLords">Blood Lords Adventure Path</a>! Your characters can now take the Ashes mystery, cast new and horrifying spells, and more! We also updated the text of the Undead Companions boon from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0j?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead"><em>Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></a> to incorporate some undead companions from this Adventure Path. The full text of these boons is, as always, available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">Pathfinder Society FAQ page</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Looking ahead, the next two projects on our radar are the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dsn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path</a> compilation, as well as <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault">Pathfinder Treasure Vault</a></em>. Right now we’re on track to have sanctioning for both books available on their release!</p>

                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2. Congratulations!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Glyph (PFS2):</b> Bill Tobin</p>

                   <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>With a new year comes new conventions! Our <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">convention calendar</a> is already looking rather full in January, and February and March are starting to fill out as well. Check it out and see if there are any conventions in your area to play Pathfinder and Starfinder Society!</p> 
                   <p>I’m also pleased to announce two more conventions where I’ll be making an appearance!</p> 
                   <p>First, I’ll be attending <a href="https://www.dundracon.com/">DunDraCon</a> in Los Angeles, California, from February 17¬–20. It’s my first official trip to California and my first time in Los Angeles, so I’m excited to spend Presidents Day with our LA lodge!</p> 
                   <p>After that, I’ll immediately be heading to Denver for <a href="https://gamergirlgames.com/">GenghisCon</a> the next weekend, February 23–26! The Mile High City is host to one of the Great Plains’ premiere conventions, and both Tonya Woldridge and I will be attending.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re in the area of either of these shows, I encourage you to come out and say hi! Visiting local shows is one of my favorite parts of my job, and it’s wonderful to see the various communities come together.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, for those of you eager to volunteer at Gen Con or PaizoCon this year, come back to the blog next week for some more news…</p> 
                   <p>I’ll see you next week for more! Until then—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And have fun in the desert!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Welcome to 2023 everyone! With the Second Edition of Pathfinder now in its third year, the folks on the rules team are really thrilled to see how all of you are engaging with the game and telling thrilling stories of adventure with friends and family. Behind the scenes, we’re continuing to make the game as good as it possibly can be by creating brand new content and going back to make sure that our existing books are working the way we intended.</p> 
                   <p>That means errata, and today we’re happy to announce several exciting changes to the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> that make the game a little easier to play and bring certain aspects of it more in line with our current thoughts and sensibilities. But before I toss the blog over to Lead Designer Logan Bonner to walk you through some of the highlights, I want to take a moment to talk about some upcoming changes to the errata process itself!</p> 
                   <p>In the past, our errata process has been tied to when we reprint books, so that you could make sure your print edition matched what was currently on store shelves. While this had its advantages, it often meant that changes were made quite infrequently. In addition, if a book didn’t see a reprint, it might mean that we never went in to apply a patch. The result was a process that just was not living up to our needs and desire to make sure you have a great game experience. So, we are changing the process.</p> 
                   <p>Starting this year, we will release errata twice per year, once in the spring and once in the fall. Since errata will no longer be tied to reprints, it frees us up to cover errata issues from a wide range of products as well. We hope this will allow us to be a bit more responsive to your questions and any issues you might have spotted with the game, so keep posting your questions to Paizo.com. Your passion helps us make a better Pathfinder!</p> 
                   <p>Alright, that’s enough process talk from me. I’m going to toss it over to Logan to take a look at some of the changes made to the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>!</p> 
                   <br>

                   <h3>Core Rulebook Errata</h3> 
                   <p>Thanks, Jason! You might notice that Jason said spring and fall, and it’s not... either of those. This batch of errata is coming to coincide with the new fourth printing of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. While typically any such errata will have already been covered under the new process, this one is playing catch-up. You’ll find all the errata on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq">FAQ page</a>, but I want to give context and explanations for a few of the major changes.</p> 
                   <p>First comes the most expansive change: <b>alternate ancestry boosts</b>. We’re implementing the option for you to choose two free ability boosts for a character of <em>any</em> ancestry. There have been many ongoing conversations in the gaming community and within Paizo about biological essentialism in RPGs. We think it’s time to address this issue and have added this universal option. This makes it clearer that ancestries aren’t a monolith, and adds more nuance to the world and a wider breadth of characters. To be clear: this is an alternative for all characters and campaigns, not a variant rule, since it’s expected to be in line with the power level of other options. If you have made or want to make a character using an ancestry’s printed options (such as a dwarf with a Con boost, Wisdom boost, free boost, and Charisma flaw), those options remain, and those characters still follow the updated rules. We started heading toward this adjustment in July and are very pleased to have this chance to implement it and bring it to the community!</p> 
                   <p>The <b>alchemist</b> gets major changes to add more flexibility. This dovetails with new alchemy options coming in <em>Treasure Vault</em>, allowing more flexibility in choosing items for a research field instead of a narrow list. The largest number of changes are with the chirurgeon. An alchemist with this field can choose elixirs with the healing trait and can fully substitute Crafting for Medicine checks and proficiency prerequisites. Now that they can choose items that heal HP, we needed to add a limit for perpetual healing items to keep out-of-combat healing from careening out of control. As with alternate boosts, any alchemist you already made remains a valid character!</p> 
                   <p>Most of the remaining changes are smaller improvements, like fixing an oversight on Simple Weapon Proficiency for clerics, making the horse animal companion work as intended, and having the <em>soothe</em> spell target “1 willing creature,” as suggested by <em>Book of the Dead</em> and the Blood Lords AP. We do, however, have one significant downgrade to talk about. The gnome flickmace was a bit overpowered. A one-handed reach weapon was stronger than we expected it to be, and it’s having more of an outsized reputation than a single weapon should usually have in the game. We’ve reduced its damage and added the sweep trait to bring it more in line with other flails. Its new stat line is <b>Price</b> 3 gp; <b>Damage</b> 1d6 B; <b>Bulk</b> 1; <b>Hands</b> 1; <b>Group</b> Flail; <b>Weapon Traits</b> Gnome, reach, sweep.</p> 
                   <p>We look forward to seeing what new characters you make with these changes to the <em>Core Rulebook</em>! </p>

                   <p>When you sign up for an OAD marathon, you agree to live in a house with us for a few days, playing about twelve to fourteen session hours a day. We take our time, roleplay as much as we can, and take advantage of almost every side quest and NPC errand that comes along. Throughout the marathon, other members of the Order might show up to cameo as NPCs or fellow gunslingers. Rack up enough session hours with us, and you’ll become the newest member of OAD. With that, we want to wish a warm welcome to <a href="https://twitter.com/theamberdie/status/1561885697274953729">Karee Vogrin</a>, who reached 100 session hours and membership during this marathon! </p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><b>Adventure</b>: <em>Ruins of Gauntlight</em></li> 
                    <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 60 hours, 45min</li>

                   </ul> 
                   <p>Our GM started the story on the path to the Gauntlight ruins, as we were already well prepped with a session zero and the material we had in our campaign’s Google Classroom. We found the top level of the ruins occupied, but the Black Powder Cadre was in need of cash, so the room-clearing began—right after we picked two of our characters up out of the mud. Yup, the Amber Die itself was hot from the start, and Adam opened this campaign with three crits from a slurk in the first encounter!</p>

                   <h3>Highlights from <em>Ruins of Gauntlight:</em></h3> 
                   <p>□ The Black Powder Cadre isn’t a group known for tact, and we managed to get kicked out of two of Otari’s prominent taverns: The Rowdy Rockfish and the Crook’s Nook. At the Rockfish we botched (a light term) an attempt to empathize with the proprietor whose son disappeared a year ago. At the Crook’s Nook, we ran up a sizeable tab with the local thieves’ guild. Solving this issue isn’t as simple as merely avoiding the tavern, so we’ll keep you updated as our debt looms. At least they know we’re heavily armed!</p> 
                   <p>□ When you have a party consisting entirely of gunslingers, adventuring tactics can change a bit. We approached almost every room in the ruins through its collapsed ceiling. If we saw opposition on the floor below, we rained down lead as they scampered for the doors. Let the gods sort ’em out!</p> 
                   <p>□ Hands-down one of the best battles of the adventure took place in the Otari graveyard. We raced past the cemetery gates as the Gauntlight shone down its eerie beam, bringing the deceased back to life! Things got loud real quick, and not since our years of playing <em>Call of Duty: Zombies</em> have we unloaded that much firepower into the walking dead. Worse yet, the Gauntlight brought to life our former companion, Rome, whose body was wrapped and prepared for a funeral the next morning. His massive frame lumbered toward us—and went down like the rest.</p> 
                   <p>□ Just because we are the only ones with guns does not mean there aren’t some close shootouts. What, you thought you would automatically win a ranged battle because you’re packing heat? A morlock with a junk launcher might just have better aim.</p> 
                   <p>□ Over the years, our GM has been known for rendering maps from Pathfinder adventures in his <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lj2f?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Strange-Aeons">signature style</a>. This time he drew with one eye—not by choice. It’s a long story, but Adam even GMed this project launch in sunglasses the whole time. Many thanks to the docs at Wills Eye in Philly for helping us pull off this marathon!</p>

                   <h3>The Arsenal</h3> 
                   <p>As expected, with a party consisting completely of gunslingers, we saw quite a few extremes play out during the first marathon. Foremost, there is little that compares to round one of most combats: fire, reload, fire. Round two is rough though, when we all usually reload, fire, and reload. Another concern is money, as guns and ammo are expensive for an entire adventuring party. That fancy gem we found in the back of the soulbound doll? Sold—pass me a cartridge. Additionally, healing is an issue for us. Battle Medicine is a key reason we’re still here, and we’re thinking that eventually all characters will have to take it. Since we are all playing the same class, we’ve been overpowered in some encounters, and barely equipped to handle others; most importantly, this campaign is unlike any other, and that’s what we were striving for. Like all OAD projects, we’re also tracking data on how the characters interact with the Adventure Path, and we’ll present it at the end. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Character Deaths:</h3> 
                   <p>□ Anyone who is familiar with the Abomination Vaults has probably heard of Mister Beak, the soulbound doll responsible for so many TPKs that it earned a nerf in the hardcover version of the Adventure Path. Rome, a gunslinger following the Way of the Drifter, failed his save vs. the doll’s <em>phantom pain</em>. We shot Mister Beak up easier than a clay pigeon, but the persistent damage demanded some flat checks for Rome to survive. While he did manage to get rid of the persistent damage, he was still dying and needed to make recovery checks to stabilize. Our party’s inability to heal our fellow gunslinger left us watching in frozen fear: Rome had fallen. Yes, we used the nerfed version of the doll. Sorry for putting you out there, Erick!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Best Quote From Marathon 1:</h3>

                   <p>Breen: "Clear?"<br> Vlai: (kicks a dead gremlin) "Clear!" <br> Rome: “They shouldn’t have brought darts to a gunfight.”<br> <br> </p>

                   <h3>Current Situation:</h3> 
                   <p>Gotta be honest, we loved the town of Otari as much as we did the first two levels of the Abomination Vaults. We had dinner with the mayor, read suggested selections at the Dawnflower Library, and even acquired the deed for the ruins of The Thirsty Alpaca. As of now, a crooked sign stands in front of the old alpaca that reads “Coming soon: Maloika’s Mercantile.” We’ve mourned our single character death, and Rome has been replaced by a rookie gunslinger from Arcadia practicing the Way of the Spellshot. We also explored level one and part of level two of the megadungeon, found Otari’s ghost, and followed it as best we could to level three. We’re currently in a hallway that presents a bit of option-anxiety: two stairways headed up, an open room with mist to the left, and a door at the other end of the corridor. Lock and load!</p>

                   <h3>Nath (Anathema)</h3> 
                   <p>For those who don't know me, I'm Anathema or Nath—or Shane if we want to use real names—the Project Coordinator for Foundry VTT and one of the people responsible for helping to bring premium content for Pathfinder to the Foundry VTT community. I'm often joined in matters like this by Viviane, who works in content production, most notably on our Pathfinder releases. A little later in this article we’ll also hear from Ian, who subcontracted with us to actually do the work of converting more than a thousand pieces of artwork into the tokens so many of you have purchased and are enjoying.</p> 
                   <p>I'd like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the Pathfinder community for all the support for the Foundry VTT premium content projects. Without the awesome community surrounding Pathfinder Second Edition for Foundry VTT, I’m not sure we would be nearly as successful as we have been at bringing this content to you! </p> 
                   <p>It probably won't be a surprise for you to read that the "token pack project" came about as a result of feedback from the community. For months—perhaps even years—people had been asking for a token pack for use in their Pathfinder games. When we were deciding early on which Paizo projects to offer first, it came up then, but for several reasons we didn't want it to be the very first product we brought to the community. Tackling the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eap?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box-Bundle">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dso">Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a> made a much bigger splash and, I feel strongly, got exactly the right kind of attention. Once we had those successes under our belt, producing a token pack was an obvious next step, but with such a rich setting as Golarion there are a lot of questions about where to start:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>What does the community most want to see in a token pack?</li> 
                    <li>Where are the logical boundaries for the creatures and characters the token packs should contain?</li> 
                    <li>What would provide the best experience for users without an unnecessary maintenance burden?</li> 
                    <li>Is there a way we can provide some benefit to Pathfinder First Edition players and GMs?</li> 
                    <li>Is there any way to offer token packs that better support Pathfinder Society?</li> 
                    <li>Should make a token pack per book?</li> 
                    <li>Should we try to group them based on theme instead?</li> 
                    <li>Is there a way we can make this beneficial for a wider audience outside of the mainstream Pathfinder Second Edition players?</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>…and so many more.</p> 
                   <p>When it came down to it, the bestiaries were the obvious choice. The community has been very vocal about wanting tokens for all the creatures in the bestiaries, and it solved a lot of questions about whether we should group by book or not. It also provided the best opportunity to provide some support to players and GMs who still lean on Pathfinder First Edition, or those participating in Organized Play events, as both groups have a lot of overlapping demand for bestiary creatures.</p> 
                   <p>However, those of you who have been following the content Foundry VTT produces will know by now: we don't do things small. As we see it, if we're going to tackle creating tokens for the bestiaries, we aren't going to only do one book at a time. The project is already going to require a lot of time for organization, and if we're going to organize art for 400 creatures, why not make it 1,200? Besides, there aren't many cases out there where you can buy more than a thousand tokens and portraits to use in your game at a single price point. </p> 
                   <p>One thing we all agreed on very early was the importance of including a blank copy of the token ring, so that players and GMs would be able to have their own tokens match the style of the token pack. While Ian will give some tips and tricks on getting your tokens to look consistent, for those who really want to understand the exact techniques we used: <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&amp;teamID=60699">The Pathfinder Second Edition Volunteer Development Team has been raising money for Extra Life</a>. If they raise $10,000 or more (at the time of writing, they have already raised a staggering $9,683), I have previously offered to record and release a detailed instructional video that will cover every aspect of our token production process.</p> 
                   <p>Once we knew what the scope of the project was going to be (approximately 1,200 creatures’ worth of art, <em><b>twice</b></em>) and it was approved by Paizo, Cora began to tackle the monumental effort of organizing all the different parts of the project into a sensible and usable state. </p>

                   <h3>Viviane (Cora)</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Viviane, and I’m a content developer at Foundry VTT as well as a project manager for the Pathfinder Token Pack: Bestiaries. I worked extensively on our Abomination Vaults and Beginner Box releases, and you might also know me as the community manager of the all-volunteer team that develops the Pathfinder Second Edition system on Foundry VTT. I’m currently running the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path for my own group, who’re just into book 3 of the adventure.</p> 
                   <p>One of the main things that we committed to very early on was that, in one form or another, every single creature should have artwork. At times, that can be trickier than it sounds; only a fraction of Paizo’s excellent creature artwork is inside the bestiaries themselves. So, when we decided to tackle this project, my first job was to create a definitive list of what we had, what we needed, and how we were going to fill the gaps.</p> 
                   <p>I started by creating a list of every single creature that appears in these three publications—not just names, but also their ID in the system database, their size, and any other relevant data about them that might be needed later down the line. </p> 
                   <p>Once I had my shopping list in hand, I dug through the bestiaries, the pawn boxes, and the battlecards before looking a little further afield. For instance, we found a portrait for the kapoacinth (a swimming variant of the gargoyle) in the Blood Lords Adventure Path, and our eagle is from the Strange Aeons Adventure Path in Pathfinder First Edition. I was very lucky to have Ian’s help here—he has a truly uncanny ability to spout off the source book and page number for just about any artwork you can think of, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.</p> 
                   <p>In a couple of places, we filled our gaps by making minor edits to existing artwork, like carefully recoloring the chimera and dracolisk so there would be options for individuals of every draconic exemplar. When that wasn’t enough, I ceded the stage to Anathema, whose compositing work is what gave us a complete set of petitioners, the living graffiti, and plenty of other incredible pieces.</p> 
                   <p>The help we got from Paizo in this process was, of course, invaluable, and we couldn’t have done it without support from them, especially Andrew White and Luis Loza, who helped to ensure we had every piece of artwork we needed, and offered advice and input when needed to make sure our composites fit with the lore of the Pathfinder universe.</p> 
                   <p>Once we had all of the artwork formatted, renamed, and entered into the spreadsheet (and we’d ensured nothing was left out), I passed over my collection to Ian for the token creation process and started packaging the module for release. That included deciding on a folder structure for our assets, so that it’d be easy for people to find the artwork they were looking for. It also meant setting up the image mapping functionality, so that all of the artwork would seamlessly be inserted into your Foundry compendiums as soon as you enabled the module. As we got closer to release, I also took some demo screenshots for the store page, created banner images, joined my colleagues on a livestream to talk about the impending release, and just generally continued to try to make everything go as smoothly as possible. </p>

                   <h3>Ian (SpartanCPA)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello everyone! I’m Ian, better known among the Foundry VTT community as SpartanCPA. I am one of the two lead data coordinators for the volunteer development team for the Pathfinder Second Edition game system, and generally speaking, I’m the one “in charge” of the NPC stat blocks. I joined the team on a whim a few years ago and decided that a good use of my free time was auditing the NPC stat blocks for <em>Bestiary 2</em>, and around a month later, the format I had worked out became our go-to format for all of the monsters. As far as games I’m currently a part of, I run a homebrew story centered around Alkenstar, a conversion of Rise of the Runelords, and I’m playing in a <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dsn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</a> campaign. It’s hard to find any free time I <em>don’t</em> devote to Pathfinder these days.</p>
                   <p> </p>
                   <p>I'm very particular when it comes to the art that I show my players during a game, which is one of the reasons I gravitated to Paizo games in the first place. The first time I opened the system on Foundry VTT, I was initially amazed that every single stat block is just there to be used—just drag and drop and you are good to go. (Provided you had your own art…) My second thought, after seeing the “Mystery Man” picture on all of the compendiums was, "I'm going to have to fix this."</p> 
                   <p>I meticulously sorted artwork from all Paizo sourcebooks I own, for both editions of Pathfinder, and tagged each piece with my own naming scheme to easily find and create my own tokens to get as much coverage in the compendium as I possibly could. Viviane said above that I have an uncanny track of the Paizo art—I can definitely say I've put in the time to get there.</p> 
                   <p>When I started on this project, I was given the raw art files from Nath and Cora, as well as a template token ring file chosen by Foundry VTT, and was essentially set free to complete the tokens as I saw fit. I was asked to take special advantage of some of the features available on Foundry, such as the extended pop-outs where possible, and I think they came out extremely well. Some of the tokens I’m especially proud of are the elder wyrmwraith, the mist stalker, and the storm giant. These tokens show a number of little enhancements we were able to make, such as the transparent wing membranes on the wyrmwraith, and the glowing eye in the center of the fog of the mist stalker. These little effects aren’t available anywhere else besides this token pack, and I believe they really make it stand out. That said, while I think I was able to make the tokens pop, I would also like to say that the underlying artwork itself was stellar, and I give first kudos to the artists who made the originals.</p> 
                   <p>The token-making process itself was purposely made to be flexible, so that the ring chosen could work with any orientation of art or creature body type. (Which is more important than you’d expect—we did have 1,200+ tokens to make, after all.) We included the token rings in the module as well, so you can make tokens for your player characters, or other monsters, in the same style! Quick tip: If there is smoke approaching the edges of the token frame, such as with the adamantine golem, or especially the mist stalker from before, be very careful to not have a hard line at the token edge. It’s generally a good idea to make that token a bit bigger to allow the smoke to billow out naturally. There are more tips I could give to <em>really</em> make your tokens pop, but if you want all the secrets, you’ll have to take Nath up on his offer and push the Extra Life donations past $10,000 raised. It’s a good cause, and we are almost there! </p> 
                   <p>I’m immensely happy to have had a part in this project with Foundry and Paizo. Each company was extremely flexible with any requests I had, and I was able to put some of my own touches on some of the iconic monsters that many people get to use in their own games going forward. </p> 
                   <h3>What’s Next?</h3> 
                   <p>With the release of <em>Pathfinder Token Pack: Bestiaries</em>, we can turn our thoughts to planning the next release in this product line. We've been happy to see such a positive outpouring of support from the community, and we feel confident we can continue this trend for quite some time. Thankfully, we’re at no risk of running out of material to work with! Paizo has several decades’ worth of top-quality artwork in their vaults, and we’ve already got some ideas about what to tackle next, as well as plenty of great suggestions from the community. Working with Paizo has helped us create a product that we’re immensely proud of, and I hope everyone continues to enjoy it the way we do.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, players! I’m pleased to let you know that the wheels have already begun to spin up for 2023’s convention season.</p> 
                   <p>For our major shows (such as PaizoCon and Gen Con), we have a volunteer organizing committee that runs our organized play space. This group works closely with me, as the Organized Play Coordinator, to determine the schedule, recruit GMs, and get them everything they need to make the show a success!</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/d960ad1b-9967-00f9-1158-72274b18312d/e0f195d6-af17-4e8c-950e-914a22e92559/NivisGameTable_OrgPlay_1200x675.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/d960ad1b-9967-00f9-1158-72274b18312d/e0f195d6-af17-4e8c-950e-914a22e92559/NivisGameTable_OrgPlay_1200x675.png" hspace="5" width="90%" alt="Society members gathered around a game table"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <p>While we’re still finalizing what our presence looks like for Gen Con, we know we’re going to need a few new members of our leadership team. Applications for these positions are open until <b>January 1, 2023</b>. After that, I’ll anonymize the submissions and discuss them with our existing Gen Con Committee.</p> 
                   <p>Please note that joining a leadership team is a significant commitment, as there is a lot of preparation work to do to get ready for a show. More information about the leadership team’s responsibilities and rewards are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QF-do1YTta8NAYxDqrgs3QEjYGP14oxZGIKjuCTsvs/edit?usp=sharing">in this document</a>. If you’re not already a Venture Officer, we’ll be asking you to sign a volunteer agreement stating that you agree to these commitments. Note that anybody is free to apply for a committee; we welcome those who are not already Venture Officers!</p> 
                   <p>Gen Con 2023 is seeking applicants for the following positions:</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Online Committee Member</h3> 
                   <p>We’re looking to add one member whose sole responsibility will be to focus on Gen Con Online. This position is not required to attend the show in Indianapolis (and in fact, it will be much easier if they <em>don’t</em>). We’re asking them to oversee operations via our Discord during the show: coordinating with HQ, ensuring GMs have what they need, and taking responsibility for the Organized Play-related activities. It’s a tall order, so we’re looking for someone experienced with online conventions.</p> 
                   <h3>Academy Assistant</h3> 
                   <p>The Pathfinder and Starfinder Academies are our programs designed to teach young players (under the age of 18) about our games in a safe, family-friendly environment. We’re looking for someone who wants to learn about this program this year, with the goal of training them to take over next year. As a result, we’re looking for applicants willing to take on a multi-year commitment for this position. The ideal candidate enjoys working with children and families and can mentor GMs on playing with young children. A background check is required for this position at the applicant’s expense; this is only required once the position is offered and accepted, and previous checks (such as from a teaching or youth group) will be accepted.</p> 
                   <h3>Headquarters Department Head</h3> 
                   <p>At major conventions, we have a team of HQ volunteers whose task is to support GMs, answer questions from players, and muster players to tables. The HQ staff is the backbone of our conventions, and we can’t run a show without them. We’re looking for someone to serve as our Department Head for this team. They’ll work to train our in-person HQ staff on best practices, serve as backup for the team in the event of issues, and document methods for future conventions. The ideal candidate has experience with running HQ at larger conventions and is able to train new staffers quickly.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested in any of these positions, please fill out the form below! If necessary, we’ll contact applicants with follow-up questions and notify all applicants of their status before the end of January. We’re looking forward to working with you at the Best Four Days in Gaming!</p>

                   <p>A Starfinder Bounty designed for 1st-level characters written by Nicole Heits. Art by Alecksander Ribeiro.</p> 
                   <p>Among the hand-built altars to forgotten and dead deities that cover the surface of the airless moon of Yashu-Indiri, a servant of a murderous god turns shrines into deathtraps and harnesses fell magic to drag down passing starships. When these engineered accidents cause a priestess of Shelyn—vanished goddess of art, love, and beauty—to go missing on a trip to Yashu-Indiri, a team of heroes is sent to locate and rescue her. If these heroes aren’t careful, they’ll be the next lives claimed in this grim harvest.</p>

                   <p>With the restructure of the editorial department, you’ve already heard about changes to the Narrative Team under Linda Zayas-Palmer and will be hearing more about the Rules and Lore Team under Michael Sayre in the coming weeks. Today is your chance to learn about the Starfinder Team and some of the exciting changes we’ve got coming down our futuristic pipeline.</p> 
                   <p>The Starfinder Team is responsible for everything Starfinder. That includes Starfinder Adventure Paths, Starfinder modules, Starfinder hardcovers, Starfinder the flamethrower… oh wait, ignore that last one! The team handles all aspects of Starfinder except for Starfinder Society, which remains under the Narrative Team due to its close connections to Pathfinder Society through Paizo’s Organized Play programs—though we keep in regular contact with our SFS developer for scheming purposes.</p> 
                   <p>All right, let’s introduce the team!</p>

                   <p>Greetings Starfinders! I’m Dustin Knight, the newest developer for Starfinder! I’m taking the lead on the development of future Starfinder hardcover books. Working at Paizo is a dream come true, and I’m so excited to bring smiles to our fans around the world. I’m also elated to be able to work with the most creative and skilled artists, designers, developers, editors, and writers in the industry; my only regret is not contacting Paizo years sooner to ask for work (hint, hint). Being able to develop player-facing options is especially exciting for me given my experiences both writing new content and evaluating existing content for Organized Play—where I hope my additions to our awesome game will facilitate memorable stories for years to come.</p> 
                   <p>You may have already met me lurking around various Starfinder &amp; Pathfinder Discords, hanging with the crew on Know Direction: Beyond, and releasing my own line of Pathfinder Infinite products. When I’m not developing or writing new RPG books, I’m still finding time to play TCGs, experience the culinary cross-roads of the Seattle area, and enjoy every minute of my precious boyfriend’s incredible Starfinder campaign!</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested in working with us, please feel free to contact me at dustin.knight@paizo.com. Don’t be shy about including your availability, interests, and experiences, whether RPG related or otherwise, as it can greatly help us assign exciting content that plays to your strengths as an author! Feel free to chat me up on the Infinite Possibilities Discord.</p>

                   <h3>Jenny Jarzabski</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Jenny Jarzabski, and I’m super hyped to keep bringing that extra sparkle to Starfinder’s Adventure Path line. I’ll be outlining and assigning Adventure Paths and modules, plus working with the rest of the team to dig deeper into Starfinder’s lore and shape the future of Starfinder as a game and brand!</p> 
                   <p>My Paizo career began in Organized Play. There, I helmed the Starfinder Society’s Year of the Data Scourge before joining the Adventure Path team. Recently, I’ve stepped into my new role as Queen of Adventures—note that my actual title is Senior Developer—a role that encompasses my old job responsibilities with an added layer of creative influence and mentorship.</p> 
                   <p>Besides my on-the-clock work, I’m a longtime Paizo freelancer, but adventures are my specialty. My latest published work is recently released <em>Drift Crashers 2: Nightmare Scenario</em>, but I have so many ‘Finder credits at this point that it’s hard to keep track. Before I became a freelance writer I worked as a teacher, bartender and certified sommelier, and event planner. I still enjoy talking about wine and, of course, tasting it! I love the outdoors, playing video games (<em>Drakengard/NieR</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> are my favorites), watching anime, cosplay, performing, and music. I love mechs, magical girls, and tragic androids; you can expect more of this holy trinity (and many more fun surprises) in future Starfinder releases. I’m not into social media these days, but I’m active on Discord and my digital mailbox at jenny.jarzabski@paizo.com is always open! Forgive me for the Drift delay in responding. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Thurston Hillman</h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Thurston Hillman, the managing creative director for the Starfinder Team. This is a bit of a unique title in our company as it combines the elements of manager and creative director to balance out the fact that Starfinder is a smaller team. My role comprises the usual logistical scheduling tasks as well as the oversight and guidance provided by a creative director. I work side-by-side with my co-workers and other departments to make sure that Starfinder is the best brand it can be, and to bring all the content that our fans want.</p> 
                   <p>I’ve been GMing Starfinder campaigns off and on since the game came out, including some hosted on Paizo’s Twitch Channel. (Check for Pungeon Crawl!) Along with my obvious love of Starfinder, I’m a huge fan of Pathfinder, and I even GM a show as part of the Narrative Declaration team (<a href="https://www.narrativedeclaration.com/">https://www.narrativedeclaration.com</a>) in our custom Rotgrind setting. I also run a home PF2 campaign set in the nation of Druma, for which I co-wrote the actual book back at the end of Pathfinder 1st Edition, and we’re now entering the fourth adventure in my homebrew Adventure Path that has the PCs battling against corrupt Prophets of Kalistrade and the forces of Abaddon. Yeah, that’s right, I’m using this space to TELL YOU ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN!! *insidious laughter follows*</p> 
                   <p>I’ve been working with Paizo since Starfinder’s launch, where I was the Starfinder Society developer. I later helped the Pathfinder Society for a brief stint before moving into digital adventures and then back onto Starfinder in my current title. In all those roles, I’ve worked on too many products to name, and most recently I’m wrapping up work on the Scoured Stars Adventure Path, which is a dream-come-true project. Also, I tossed a never-before-seen Scoured Stars art piece into this blog, because I am ABUSING MY NEW AUTHORITY *more insidious laughter ensues*</p> 
                   <p>On official channels, you can contact me at thurston.hillman@paizo.com. For the foreseeable future, I’m hands-on when it comes to outlining and assigning our current slate of projects, so while Dustin and Jenny are using their stable of freelancers and contacts, I’ll still be involved in the process for a bit. I’ll be primarily focused on supporting Adventure Paths and charting the vision for our hardback lines, but don’t be surprised if I have a special project or two that you one day hear about.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me on pretty much all the socials as @OnCallGM, and I tend to answer when summoned on several Discord channels. Outside of TTRPGs, I have a stack of miniatures I need to get back to painting… so many miniatures…</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hi! Those of you who have been watching the credits of recent products or the discourse on social media may have noticed some shake-ups in Paizo’s staff recently. </p> 
                   <p>Over the past couple of months, we’ve done some restructuring on the editorial team, and we’ve also welcomed many new faces. This restructuring includes reorganizing the designers, developers, and creative directors into three broad teams: the Narrative Team, led by me (Linda); the Rules and Lore team, led by Michael Sayre; and the Starfinder Team, led by Thurston Hillman. </p> 
                   <p>Today, I’d like to introduce you to the narrative team. The narrative team is responsible for all Pathfinder adventures, including Adventure Paths, standalone Pathfinder Adventures, and Pathfinder Society. The team also includes Starfinder Society due to its close connections to Pathfinder Society through our Organized Play programs.</p> 
                   <p>And without further ado, here’s who’s who in their own words, as well as how to contact each of us.</p>

                   <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone! I’m Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer! I’m thrilled to be in charge of planning, outlining, assigning, and developing our Starfinder Society Scenarios, Starfinder Bounties, and our upcoming Starfinder Society Specials. In addition to working at Paizo full-time, I’m a frequent freelance author for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. Outside of writing, I love reading and playing board games. I live in wonderful Winnipeg, Canada with my husband, two kids, and pet rabbit. You can follow me on twitter @d20diaries. If you’re interested in writing a Starfinder Bounty or Starfinder Society Scenario, reach out to me at jessica.catalan@paizo.com.<br> </p> Take care, folks! 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>John Compton</h3> 
                   <p>I’m John Compton, a senior developer currently working on Pathfinder’s Adventure Paths. Previously, I’ve overseen various organized play programs’ creative content and most recently co-led Starfinder’s hardcover book production, and it’s great to be revisiting adventure design on the narrative team (starting with the recently announced <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eao/discuss&amp;page=2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-193-Mantle-of-Gold">Sky King’s Tomb</a> adventures). I love a good intrigue, heist, investigation, or adventure sandbox, and I’m excited about the to-be-announced stories we have in the works. While my assignments are few and far between, I’m always interested in meeting and training up our game’s next authors. You can contact me at john.compton@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>When I’m not playing or creating RPG content in the Seattle area, I’m usually gardening, spoiling my friends’ various pets, socializing on Discord (I’m in the Pathfinder RPG and Starfinder RPG servers), dissecting whatever narrative media I consume, or learning eclectic trivia that then seeps into my professional writing.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Josh Foster</h3> Greetings Pathfinders and Starfinders! I’m Josh Foster, a Pathfinder Society Developer. I’m full of ideas for short adventures and can’t wait to get them on the page. I’ll be the one outlining, assigning, and developing new Pathfinder Quests—and I’m extremely excited that Quests are coming back. I’ll also be working on non-metaplot scenarios for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Societies (though mainly Pathfinder), as well as helping the narrative team with the metaplot whenever they need my overly-caffeinated input.
                   <p></p> 
                   <p>I’ve been a mainstay of Pathfinder Society play since way back toward the launch of the campaign. I’m a five-star GM, have helped run the Pathfinder Society programs at several stores, and served as a Venture-Lieutenant in Georgia. When not playing tabletop RPGs, I spend way too much time playing Final Fantasy XIV. I’m now living in downtown Seattle with my amazing wife and our adorable dog.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested in writing a quest or scenario, you can contact me at joshua.foster@paizo.com.<br> Good gaming everyone!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Vanessa Hoskins</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Vanessa Hoskins, a Developer on the Narrative Team, and I get to assign talented freelancers to help shape the stories we tell on Golarion (and beyond?). I’ll be outlining, assigning, and developing long-form adventures and their backmatter. This includes Adventure Paths and standalone adventures.</p> In addition to serving on the board of directors at the Know Direction Network, I’m a cast member on the Adventurous! actual play. I also co-author Vellum &amp; Lace, the first piece of serialized Pathfinder fiction on Pathfinder Infinite, with Helen Savore. Finally, I recently started Ninja Cat Games, an indie video game studio. I do all of this while living in Indiana with my brilliant wife and our adorable dog.

                   <h3>James Jacobs</h3> 
                   <p>Ahoy! I’m James Jacobs, Creative Director for the Pathfinder narrative team. I’ve been with Paizo for about a year less than Paizo’s been a thing, and over the past 19 and a half years have worn enough hats in the editorial department to make a whole family of ettins with chimera pets proud! Going forward, my focus will be on guiding the stories for all of the Pathfinder adventures Paizo will be producing, along with actually developing adventures for both the standalone line and the Adventure Path line. I’m hoping to be able to chat soon about some fun things we’ve got planned as the Adventure Path nears its 200th volume, and some new and exciting stuff we’ll be doing on the standalone adventure side. I’m also involved in other narrative-based things you’ll see coming from Paizo or our partners when it comes to stories beyond adventures.</p> 
                   <p>As for myself? I’m from a small town, Point Arena, on the remote coast of northern California, but for the past half of my life I’ve been living up north in the Seattle hinterlands. (And yes, there’s a fair amount about the town of Sandpoint that’s inspired from my hometown… although we do have fewer goblins living there, especially since I moved up north!) I’m sort of a social media recluse, but I’m pretty active here on our message boards, and have started to de-lurk over on Reddit’s 2nd Edition Pathfinder page as well. Feel free to drop me a message anytime in either place, or shoot me an email at james.jacobs@paizo.com. I try to answer quickly, because who knows if I’ll get distracted chasing a bigfoot or chupacabra or mothman ten minutes from now and… wait… WHAT’S THAT NOISE! <em>THAT HAND AT THE WINDOW</em>……</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Shay Snow</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, friends! I’m Shay Snow, one of the new developers for Pathfinder Society! You’ve probably seen my writing floating around, as I’ve been freelancing with Paizo since 2020 and was previously a member of Paizo’s fantastic editing team since October 2021!</p> 
                   <p>While I’ve written two Starfinder Society scenarios, I’m quite new to Organized Play. However, the Emerald City Lodge has been extremely welcoming and willing to show me the ropes! I’ve enjoyed running and attending games, and I love the chance to interact with Paizo fans on the ground and get their opinions on the game and the Society. (Yes, you can tell me about your level 12 champion of Shelyn! But in exchange you must listen to me talk about my level 4 rogue!)</p> 
                   <p>I’m from Watauga, Texas, a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth, and I moved to Washington in February of 2022. I’m Native American, mixed Caddo and Swampy Cree. When not centered on tabletop games, I’m usually consuming horror content and spending time with my spouse and two cats, Beans and Sweet Corn. The best place to find me outside of my home office is on Twitter @spellsinsugar, or you can email me at shay.snow@paizo.com!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Linda Zayas-Palmer</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Linda Zayas-Palmer, the manager of the narrative team. My job mostly involves logistical tasks like scheduling, training, and reviewing text from developers.</p> 
                   <p>I’ve been a fan of Paizo’s adventures since Pathfinder First Edition came out. The story of Rise of the Runelords inspired my home group to make the jump to Golarion, and Council of Thieves was my first-ever campaign as a GM. As for Organized Play, after positive experiences with the community at my first GenCon, I wound up joining the Boston Lodge as a player, GM, and eventually Venture-Lieutenant. Paizo’s adventures and the community around them have brought so much joy and togetherness to my life, and it’s a privilege to be part of the team that brings those kinds of experiences to the world. </p> 
                   <p>In addition to my day job, I also do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder. Some of my recent projects include the raxilite section of <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em> and the final part of Roll for Combat’s Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path. Every Tuesday at 7pm Pacific and Saturday at 10am Pacific, I stream on Twitch together with former Paizo design manager Mark Seifter, under Arcane Mark (twitch.tv/arcanemark). Outside of Paizo and its products, I enjoy reading, math, teaching, solving puzzles, playing video games, watching anime, and singing.</p> 
                   <p>I don’t engage much with social media, but if you’d like to reach out to me, you can email me at linda.zayas-palmer@paizo.com, or join Arcane Mark’s discord server at tiny.cc/arcanemark.</p>

                   <p>Our <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/bounties">Pathfinder Bounties</a> have served the purpose of short, standalone adventures since 2020. With 2023 on the horizon, however, we’ve decided that a product with a bit more length would give you all more of what you want. What that means for all of you is that, rather than new Pathfinder Bounties, you’ll soon be getting new Quests, each designed to take around two hours. (Intrepid Starfinders, you’ll still get new <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/standaloneAdventures/starfinderBounties">Starfinder Bounties</a>, though). This will allow us to give the adventures more in-depth stories while still giving you something that can be played under strict time constraints.</p> 
                   <p>The biggest difference is that Quests will be tied more deeply into Pathfinder Society than Bounties, and much like Pathfinder Society Scenarios will assume your PCs are all Pathfinders. They will reward half as much credit as a scenario—2 XP, 5 treasure bundles, and 2 reputation. Quests will have level ranges similar to scenarios. For example, the first one we’re working on is for levels 1–4. It’s set to come out in April (and might involve an Aldori swordlord). In addition to that quest, we’re aiming to have two others out by the end of 2023.</p> 
                   <p>I can’t wait to show you some of the ideas we’ve got in the works for these, and I hope you enjoy playing them as much as we enjoy working on them!</p> 
                   <p>Wishing you all a great holiday season!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">...I and Wes Schneider took over the big conference room at Paizo and began to work out what Pathfinder Adventure Path was going to do to follow up its first official campaign for the Pathfinder Roleplaying game.

                   <p><em>Kingmaker</em> would go on to become one of our most successful Adventure Paths, inspiring not only a novel, but two different video games and eventually the core of an entire rulebook, <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>. Going back to revise it all was a huge lift, but at the same time, there was a sense of comfort and nostalgia as I returned to the original adventures. Memories of the scramble to get the first volume, Stolen Lands, done in time to get it to the printer returned as well—I had the help of author Tim Hitchcock to create the central encounters for this adventure on a VERY tight schedule but wrote a fair-sized chunk of the framing and “connective tissue” to bring together the Stag Lord’s Fort, the Sootscale Kobolds, and more into one sandbox to explore. Beyond this, though, the task of finishing off the remaining five adventures fell to other amazing authors.</p> 
                   <p>So, without further ado, let me share some of the memories several of the original Kingmaker Adventure Path’s authors had when they looked back on their time helping to create one of Paizo’s most beloved campaigns!</p>

                   <h3>Rob McCreary</h3> 
                   <p><b>Rivers Run Red</b><br> Working on <em>Kingmaker</em> happened at a time of some major changes in my life, so I have some strong memories associated with it. <em>Rivers Run Red</em> was the second Adventure Path volume I wrote for Paizo, and I loved having the opportunity to put in homages to some classic wilderness adventures I had played when I was younger. I was also writing the adventure just before my wedding, and to top everything off, I was on my honeymoon when Paizo offered me a job!</p> 
                   <p>A few months later, following a move from Europe back to the USA that was longer than a trek through the Stolen Lands, I found myself working on <em>Kingmaker</em> as an editor. I felt privileged to contribute to the AP not only as an adventure author, but also as an editor, helping to craft and polish what I still believe is one of the best sandbox wilderness adventure campaigns out there. I’m super pleased to see it updated to Pathfinder Second Edition, giving gamers a whole new chance to chart their destinies and build kingdoms of their own! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Jason Nelson</h3> 
                   <p><b>War of the River Kings</b><br> Kingmaker was a ton of fun to work on, blending PC-level adventure with kingdom-level threats and high-level skullduggery. I started with the tournament, building out not just standard medieval events but also adding some wahoo flair suited to high-level characters in a magical world. The villain was different, too, with Irovetti as a bombastic foil for the PCs, a braggart and pretender but treacherous and dangerous, putting himself forward as this gracious neighbor and really showing them a good time while working to stab them in the back. I never even really saw him as evil, just a rival who had his own ambitions and saw the PCs were in the way. The warfare was a challenge because while we had all the basics of the kingdom rules, we really didn't have the specifics of mass combat done yet, so the original version was more event-based, I think with the villains using fey magic to flood the heroes' capital city. My lasting memory of writing my adventure, though, was somewhat bittersweet, as my brother Brian passed away shortly before I finished it. He and I had picked up the hobby together as kids, and even in his final months, we got together with my kids and played a few more times. I appreciated Paizo including a dedication to him in the original adventure.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Richard Pett</h3> 
                   <p><b>Sound of a Thousand Screams</b> I’m beyond excited about seeing <em>Kingmaker</em> released as another fabulous Paizo super-tome and updated to fit Pathfinder Second Edition. What a fantastic adventure path to work on with such talented folks.</p> 
                   <p>One of the things I particularly recall about those days was the Adventure Path segment outlines were much more raw, just over a paragraph of backstory for my section with, “A great menace coming over the PCs’ realm and the nymph’s followers harassing the PCs. With First World blooms heralding the arrival of the nymph.”</p> 
                   <p>My first draft synopsis was a long way from the finished article. I did like that title though.</p> 
                   <p>The line that really strikes me as joyful in looking over the old emails from the wonderful Wes was, “You’ve got a TON of flexibility here, so make it cool.”</p> 
                   <p>Well, I hope the <em>Sound of a Thousand Screams</em> is cool, the sparking ideas back and forth—throwing in the jabberwock for example—was such great fun, and whilst this adventure sticks out as one of the hardest to complete (writing <em>Wormwood Mutiny</em> was slightly trickier with so many untouchable NPCs in a low-level adventure), it was certainly the most rewarding.</p> 
                   <p>The really wonderful thing about working with such talented folks was seeing how the adventure developed and how James performed his incredible magic on my final draft—soaking the adventure with <em>Bestiary 2</em> monsters and dragons to name but two things.</p> 
                   <p>It was such a great honor to be a part of this wonderful AP and the Paizo family. Thank you, James, and thank you, Wes.</p> 
                   <p>Huzzah!</p>

                   <h3>Neil Spicer</h3> 
                   <p><b>Blood for Blood</b><br> Writing for <em>Kingmaker</em> felt like the culmination of a long-held dream and a trial by fire. It was a banner year for me in 2009. I’d won RPG Superstar. I’d finished my turnover for <em>Realm of the Fellnight Queen</em>. And, like every other freelancer, I hoped to someday write for the flagship product line, but fully expected I’d have to work my way up to it over many months or years. Then, out of the blue, Wes Schneider asked if I could take on 30,000 words in two months because <em>Kingmaker</em>had fallen behind. My exact words to him were: “HOLY CRAP!!! Are you freakin’ serious!?!?!? Yes! YES! A thousand times YES!” I know, because I kept the email. That’s how much it meant to me. I gave everything I could to it, thundering into my word count like a raging barbarian, knowing I couldn’t let Paizo down. It was my first BIG assignment. It tested me in all the right ways. I learned so much from it, and I’ll always be grateful for that opportunity.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Greg A. Vaughan</h3> 
                   <p><b>The Varnhold Vanishing</b><br> What to say about designing <em>The Varnhold Vanishing</em>? It came at a perfect time when I was wanting to explore several very different ideas in an adventure or adventures: I was interested in doing something Roanoke-ish... check. And I really liked the idea of a settlement/fortress less well-established than the usual stone keep that had become sort of the adventure standard, something with more of a colonial America feel to it like the blockhouse and stockade at Varnhold... check, check. I had recently read Pressfield’s <em>Last of the Amazons</em>, and the chance to do something with steppes horsefolk really appealed to me as well, not to mention his description of the “Gate to Hell” giving the perfect entry to Vordakai’s tomb... check, check, check! The growing setting that was Golarion and its first foray into a sandbox-style world exploration with <em>Kingmaker</em> gave me the opportunity to do it all at once, and with a powerful undead cyclops to boot. What more could you ask for?</p>

Whether you celebrate Winter Week, First Choices, Crystalhue, Renewal or any other holiday, this time of year is one to gather with friends and family (safely) and enjoy the holidays. I hope you’re all looking forward to your favorite holiday traditions!</p> 
                   <p>This month’s update may be a quiet one, but I assure you that we’re anything but quiet behind the scenes. We’ve started planning for 2023 conventions and over the past couple of weeks, I’ve also heard the pitches for the new seasons of Pathfinder and Starfinder Society. I think you’re all really going to like what we have planned for next year!</p> 
                   <p>I don’t think I have another blog where I get to talk to you all directly before the holiday break, so before I go, let me just say: thank you all so much for your support of our games. We love what we do, each and every one of us, and I’m so lucky that my job puts me in such close contact with our community. I get to hear stories from your tables and experience firsthand the joy that gaming brings. I hope you all have wonderful gaming plans for the holidays, and that your cup runneth over in the new year.</p>

                   <h2>PaizoCon Online 2023</h2> 
                   <p>Prior to Thanksgiving, we announced that PaizoCon 2023 will be an online-only event. We’re already hard at work planning the show, but we’re looking for attendee feedback on what you’d like to see next year! Please <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si6n?PaizoCon-Online-2023-Invitation#discuss"></a> and drop your thoughts in the comments.</p> 
                   <p>I can already tell you that we’ll be premiering our new Starfinder Society season and interactive special, as well as launching some new Pathfinder Society content as well. We’re looking forward to Memorial Day weekend!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> 
                   <p>November was a very busy month for us, with major releases across both our product lines.</p> 
                   <p>For Pathfinder Society, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dxx"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em></a> is now sanctioned for play! The new ancestries are available in the boon store and the options are listed on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions#pfs-lo-impossible-lands">Character Options page</a>. Next on our radar is reviewing the character options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/bloodLords">Blood Lords Adventure Path</a>, which we hope to add via boons in the boon store. We’re also starting the process of sanctioning <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dvy?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault"><em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault</em></a>, which has set a record for “most individual character options in a single book” for this edition.</p> 
                   <p>One note on the Impossible Lands sanctioning: we initially listed the kashrishi’s Community Knowledge feat as Restricted. However, the community pointed out that it’s identical to the android’s Nanite Surge feat, which is legal, so we’re changing Community Knowledge to be legal as well.</p> 
                   <p>Over in the Pact Worlds, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w"><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em></a> is now sanctioned for use in Starfinder Society play! Enjoy the new evolutionist class as well as new options themed around 25 fan-favorite species with the sanctioning on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4x"><em>Starfinder Adventure To Defy the Dragon</em></a> is now sanctioned for credit! Players and GMs <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/To+Defy+the+Dragon+Sanctioning.pdf">earn one level of credit</a> for playing this adventure.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Glyph (PFS2):</b> Emese Kollár</p> 
                   <p> <br> </p>
                   <p>Until next time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stay warm out there!</p>

Like the backgrounds, these tie-ins provide unique perks for your parties to reward their prior accomplishments.</p>

It introduces 30 new general feats, including the outrageous hybrid skill feats: a new type of feat that requires and combines the functionality of two or more skills.

Do you want to play a swashbuckling, targe-wielding duelist whose shield can exude darkness on command when you get in a pinch?

                   <p itemprop="description">Of course it happened while Kyyduh was alone and on their security shift. <em>Of course</em>.</p> 
                   <p>While others were likely to gripe and moan, Kyyduh truly enjoyed their security shifts during cryosleep. Long trip through the Drift? Perfect time to read up on all sorts of interesting stuff around the galaxy. They were usually bored and twitchy for about two days of their shift, but after that they’d fall into an information hole on their datapad and bury themself into some new subject. Security shifts were dull and slow, so everyone found their own methods of entertainment, and Kyyduh’s was falling into research on a new, random topic each time. They were supposed to be more vigilant, given the Drift Crash and everything. Supposed to be keeping a close eye on the Drift monitors and the cameras that showed the engine rooms and storage. <em>Supposed to</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Instead, Kyyduh had fallen into an information hole about the history of Eoxian bone lace. They’d found a whole article and several online video examinations theorizing on the history and origin of the craft and examining different techniques, and by the time they realized an alarm was blaring, they couldn’t have told anyone what day it was or what ship they were on. They swatted the button to reset the alarm, eyes flicking between the various monitors as they absentmindedly tucked their current weaving project (a tapestry of Meyel mid-battle dance) to the side of the console. Engines, fine. Storage, a little messy. Looks like some boxes were knocked over. Cryosleep—</p> 
                   <p>Someone was in the cryosleep chamber. Kyyduh stood immediately, temper flaring at the thought of someone, something, some <em>creature</em>, interrupting their travels and preying on their buddies. And while they were sleeping no less!</p> 
                   <p>As the doors slid open, a wave of nausea hit Kyyduh and they stumbled, grabbing onto a nearby container for support. They shook their head, feeling the plants that made up part of their body start to shift within their lungs and throat, allowing them to breathe more easily and fight off this sickness. They glanced up and spotted the intruder who, strangely surrounded by floating lights, was moving toward the life support systems.</p> 
                   <p>“Hey! Not quite!” Kyyduh’s temper returned tenfold, and they jerked their arm, reforming it into a threatening cannon. “Turn around and hold still!” Their body vibrated softly as it readied an explosive shot, taking aim to hit the intruder and not any of the delicate support systems.</p> 
                   <p>The intruder whipped around and Kyyduh caught a surprise burst of energy in the chest, knocking the air from their lungs, though the vines around their torso whipped together to form a bond that shielded them from most of the damage. With a roar they fired off a wild shot, missing the intruder but illuminating them enough to provide some more information. Strange hair, strange symbols— Oh by Meyel’s whiskers, a <em>hesper</em>? Here?</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>They grit their teeth as the fey snarled at them, gathering energy around his body. Kyyduh took a few breaths, unable to fully calm down before another energy shot hit them in the chest, knocking them back against Raia’s chamber. The safety glass cracked beneath them, and Kyyduh saw red. They lunged for the hesper, shifting their arm into a claw just before they body-slammed into him, kicking him out of his float and onto the ground. The hesper struggled against Kyyduh’s weight, the denseness of his body working against him to keep him down. Kyyduh moved to hit him with their claw, but stopped when the reflection of their symbol of Meyel in the metal of a nearby chamber drew their eye to the expression on the hesper’s face. He wore a look of struggle and desperation, his cheeks thinner than they should be. Kyyduh forced themself to breathe, then gave the hesper a good shake.</p> 
                   <p>“Calm down and tell me what you’re doing!” they demanded, dodging the hesper’s weak attempt to strike them once more. “Alright, enough with the hitting, come on!” They gave him another shake, slightly swatting at his face with their free hand. The swat seemed to startle the fey, at least enough that their radiation field dropped, letting Kyyduh breathe comfortably and sit up, dragging him with them. “Let’s start with the basics. What’s your name, bud?”</p> 
                   <p>“Thakvine.” The hesper finally got out, calming down despite his repeated glances back at the life support systems. “Please, the Drift guided me here and I’m so <em>hungry</em>... Just a little bit of the power. <em>Please</em>. I need some. It’s been so long...”</p> 
                   <p>Kyyduh gave him an inquisitive look, then a nod. “Don’t drain it dry. And you owe me.” They eased off, letting Thakvine stand and following him to the systems. Thakvine nodded in eager agreement, taking a moment as he pressed close to the machinery, absorbing the excess energy. After a moment, he looked back at Kyyduh, reaching out his hand and shifting it, making an exact copy of Kyyduh’s claw.</p> 
                   <p>“You also change?” The fey asked, watching them.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah. Couple of years now. Not mutations, but plants and stuff. Doctors say I’m a natural at adaptation.” Kyyduh puffed their chest out, looking proud.</p> 
                   <p>“Can you show me more? Like the gun, the cannon?” Thakvine, no longer gaunt looking, now wore a fascinated expression, moving closer to examine the moving plant life on Kyyduh’s body and armor.</p> 
                   <p>The chitin on Kyyduh’s chest shifted, retracting, and they gave their claw a shake, reforming into its usual conical shape. “Sure.” They shrugged, giving Thakvine a smile. “<em>But</em> you’re a crew member now. Welcome to <em>Sunrise Maiden</em>. Your job is to help keep us focused during security shifts. Deal?” They held out their hand for a shake, laughing as Thakvine shook a single finger.</p> 
                   <p>“Deal.” He agreed, before mimicking Kyyduh’s claw again.</p> 
                   <p>Kyyduh laughed, wrapping an arm around Thakvine’s shoulders and glancing back as Raia’s chamber hissed open. “Hey! New crewmate!”</p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                   <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I wrote a number of pieces throughout the book, though most notably the Ghoran ancestry and the History section, as well as the Introduction, the very first words you see in the book.</p> 
                   <p>History in fantasy is always an interesting challenge, because it doesn't really resemble “real” history very much. People on Earth are crazy, chaotic, and unruly, with societies changing, merging, and falling apart in a matter of generations. Fantasy however adores its grand sweeps and imagined antiquity, and few places in Golarion showcase that as strongly as the Impossible Lands, where Geb and Nex continue a war that in our world would predate the invention of written language. On the other hand, we don't have any immortal wizards roaming around, so one wonders what life would be like if Sargon or Menes still had a say in things.</p> 
                   <p>If strange histories are your thing, I’m also the creative director of the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler setting in which history has a tendency to be bitey and aggressive, and Survivors of the earlier age are one of the great boogeymen of the world. If that interests you at all (you know it does), please follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a> or check out our published products at <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io">https://luminant-age.itch.io</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Michael Sayre</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I'm Michael Sayre, a design manager here at Paizo and a contributor to <em>Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em>! I wrote the Bhopan section and most of the accompanying mechanics, the kashrishi ancestry, and a few other things, as well as some additional design and development on the project. <em>Impossible Lands</em> is such an amazing book, I was thrilled at the opportunity to be a part of it and to have my work placed alongside that of so many other talented and creative people. I'm really looking forward to using more of the Impossible Lands in my own future adventures. You can follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJSayre1">@MichaelJSayre1</a> for random design insights, video game thoughts, and whatever I happen to think is worth sharing. </p>

                   <h3>Shao Han</h3> 
                   <p>I'm Shao Han (绍涵), an academic-turned–game designer from Singapore. This marks the first time I've contributed so much for a Pathfinder Second Edition project. I hope long-time fans and new players alike will find something to enjoy in this book!</p> 
                   <p>I'm especially grateful for the tremendous opportunity to update Alkenstar and Dongun Hold! As a 40-something citizen of a small nation focused on diplomacy and technocracy, I brought in my formative experiences growing up during the Cold War to evoke the tensions of buffer polities caught in the Impossible Lands' uncertain détente and escalating saber-rattling. I've also imagined large-scale, lasting effects of magical war and technological development on the region's societies and politics.</p> 
                   <p>I also enjoyed designing new mechanics for the Impossible Lands: gunslinging options, fleshwarp ancestries and feats, as well as fleshforged creatures!</p> 
                   <p>My personal favorite creation in this book? The existential struggles of the fleshforged skinskitter. OK, wait, no, it's the cats of Dongun Hold. If you've seen social media posts about cats in this book... well... Mewbe you have a feline of what we are kittying in store for you!</p>

                   <p>Heyo! I’m Ruvaid Virk and I’ve been a freelancer with Paizo for a little over two years now. For <em>Impossible Lands</em>, I got to revisit vishkanyas, which were part of my very first assignment in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>, and turn them into a full-fledged ancestry! I also wrote the deity entries for Chamidu and Ragdya, and the bestiary entry for ratajin. </p> 
                   <p>My biggest contribution however was in the Jalmeray section. I split the city of Niswan with fellow author Saif Ansari, and wrote the Introduction, A Day in Niswan, a Year in Niswan, the People of Niswan, Culture, and Locations sections. In the Adventuring in Jalmeray section, I wrote the ceru familiar, new weapons, and the new updates to the Student of Perfection archetype! Being Pakistani, Jalmeray is rather important to me, and being able to see my heritage reflected in these pages means more than I can put into words. </p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to follow me or read more about my work, I’m on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider">@Darth_Ruvaider</a>, where I mostly retweet things, and occasionally say something of my own.

I have also previously contributed an article concerning Ravithra in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026dt?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-161-Belly-of-the-Black-Whale"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #161: Belly of the Black Whale</em></a>, and am known elsewhere in the industry for world-building work on Best Left Buried’s <em>Deeper </em>, <em>Throne of Avarice</em>, and <em>Spoils of the Gorgon Coast</em>; <em>Rakehell</em>; <em>Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants</em>; <em>Dolmenwood</em>; and <em>Academies of the Arcane</em>, as well as editing on <em>Putrescent Regnant</em> and <em>CY_Borg</em>. I am fascinated by random generation tables and the emergent narrative design born from such mechanisms. My independent works can be found at <a href="http://goatmansgoblet.itch.io/">goatmansgoblet.itch.io</a>.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!</p> 
                   <p>For this month’s adventure, we’re heading to Ustalav to investigate a mysterious crystal key that seems to be causing strange psychic phenomena to whoever touches it. Similarly, the people surrounding a decrepit manor in Ardis are being struck by strong, psychic shockwaves leading them to see and hear things that aren’t there! What’s even stranger is that the signals seem to not originate from Golarion…</p>

This adventure is the first part in the two-part Crystal Key metaplot arc in the Year of Boundless Wonder!</p> 
                   <p>I’d have more information for you, but I seem to be receiving a strange message…</p>

                   <p><b>Bright Lights, Big City </b><br> Nothing beats the hustle and bustle of a high-tech metropolis: citizens rushing to their destinations, hover vehicles locked in traffic jams, and vehicles of mass transit rumbling high above or far below the streets. Not to mention the undercurrent of adventure lurking in every alley, shopfront, or rooftop. This double-sided Starfinder Flip-Mat features the streets and skyscrapers of a cutting-edge city center on one side, and a wide-open traffic circle around a modern sculpture garden— perfect for a vehicle or mech combat—on the other. Starfinder Flip-Mats present ready-to-use science fantasy set pieces for the busy Game Master. With <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Metropolis</em>, you’ll be ready the next time your players hit the town! </p>

                   <p><b>Embrace the Unnatural</b><br> A war between two undying wizards once raged here for over a thousand years. Though peace has since reigned for millennia, the ghosts of wartime atrocities still haunt every corner of the lands they touched. People go about their day-to-day lives in a land that defies logic, praying the specters of history won’t rise again to plunge them back into chaos and carnage. Explore a world where cities are built on foundations of genies and wishes, where undead legions clash against titanic war engines forged from flesh. Travel a region where magic still writhes and roils from the wounds inflicted upon it—from the cavern depths where all spells lie dead to the scarred desert where the slightest arcane spark can erupt into a maelstrom. Can your heroes make their mark on a land ruled by the cruel egos of so many others, in the heart of the Impossible Lands?</p>

                   <p>For some of you, that’s all we need say and you can <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e08?Starfinder-Adventure-To-Defy-the-Dragon">order now</a> or ask for it at your local retailer with happy giggles.</p> 
                   <p>If you need to know more, here’s the back cover text.</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>Long ago, four tyrants conquered Genrovis with their starmetal mechs, until the adamantine dragon Ayleth freed the world. But she wasn’t the savior the planet needed. Centuries later, her rule is rife with corruption and cruelty. After a group of rebels runs afoul of Ayleth, they must unearth the legendary mechs of old— along with other secrets of the past— and use the ancient tech to defy the dragon! </p> 
                    <p>‘To Defy the Dragon’ makes a perfect stand-alone adventure, or an ideal next step for players and GMs who’ve completed other Starfinder adventures. It includes: </p> 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>“To Defy the Dragon,” a complete adventure for 10th-level characters, leading them to 13th-level. </li> 
                     <li>All the details on Genrovis, a planet powered by magical wellsprings and concealing a secret history of battle and betrayal. </li> 
                     <li>An Adventure Toolbox featuring new mechs based on ancient Genrovian technology and the dangerous creatures born of the world’s wellsprings. </li>

                    <p><b>Legend of the Four Steel Tyrants</b></p> 
                    <p>Friends and fellows, gather forth,<br> I tell of tyrants, sat on thrones of old.<br> Peace there was upon our world,<br> Blessed by wealth and wellspring.<br> Lit by beacons and crowned by city spires.<br> In generations long passed, the wellspring children of Genrovis prospered,<br> Bright futures borne by silicon and silver,<br> Weaving our new world with thought‐machines.</p> 
                    <p>Then, four tyrants swept from the sky,<br> Jealous eyes fixed on jeweled Genrovis.<br> They tormented peaceful cities, toppled spires,<br> Brought annhilation through fierce<br> and fanged beasts.<br> The first Tyrant cracked a whip of wild fire,<br> Setting hallowed halls ablaze.<br> The second smothered wellspring songs,<br> Reigned silence, sealed the springs in soil.<br> The third Tyrant charmed the clock,<br> To pry the precious seconds from their rightful rounds.<br> And the fourth Tyrant, shadowshrouded,<br> Commanded creatures, crazed, to slaughter.<br> Four foul tyrants gulped greedily at wellsprings,<br> Razed and ruled o’er all our lands.<br> Wounded and woeful, the wellspring children wept.<br> Ayleth heard the wellspring children’s weeping.<br> Swiftly she of adamantine soared,<br> Starwinged, she surveyed sights below,<br> Saw claws and fangs swarm cities,<br> Saw spires shatter and wellsprings wither.<br> The people pleaded for compassion,<br> Asked Ayleth for her aid.<br> Ayleth vowed vengeance, vast<br> Armies fell before her might,<br> With wellspring children shielded by adamantine wings.<br> The starwinged one battled bravely,<br> Bore down on gearspun frames, Unleashed fury for our forlorn people.<br> Four tyrants fell. Favored Ayleth triumphed,<br> Freed wellspring children, rebuilt wonders,<br> Protected peace, woke wellsprings,<br> Then sealed four tyrant‐shells in soil and steel,<br> Never to unearth again.</p> 
                    <p>Praise Ayleth, proud protector!<br> Keeper of the wellsprings,<br> Queen of Clouds,<br> Lady of the Adamantine Heart.<br> Her eternal eyes see all,<br> Her wings embrace us warmly,<br> Genrovis clasped in careful claws.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Last year, after several years of online-only PaizoCons, we produced a hybrid convention with both in-person and online events. We learned a lot, and we’ve decided the time isn’t right to produce a physical show. Why? We’ve learned the best way to make the PaizoCon experience accessible and affordable for the most people is to keep it virtual. And yes, COVID and its variants continue, which makes in-person commitments unpredictable for us all. So, we’re planning now to help PaizoCon 2023 level-up!</p> 
                   <p>Please tell us the pros and cons of the PaizoCons of the past—indeed, of all the online cons you’ve attended. Organized Play regularly plans games both online and at local retailers. Would you like to see Pop-up PaizoCon events at stores alongside PaizoCon Online?

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Pathfinders and Starfinders! In the spirit of the holiday season, I want to take a moment to highlight a charity event in our community. I think it’s a wonderful cause, and it’s one you can get involved with at your local game store!</p> 
                   <p>Venture Captains Nicholas Ruchlewicz (Northern Virginia) and Jimmy Dick (Missouri) have put together an event called <b>Toys of Boundless Wonder</b>! From November 25 to December 10, they’ll be scheduling Organized Play games in their local stores. These stores have been selected as Toys for Tots dropoff locations, so players will be able to play games and bring or purchase toys and games to donate to the charity.</p> 
                   <p>Games during this event will award players <b>bonus Achievement Points</b>, which can be used in our online boon store to unlock new character options and ancestries. Additionally, on Saturday, December 10 they’ll be running the <b>new Pathfinder Society interactive special event</b>, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-98: Expedition into Pallid Peak</em>! The tables will all work together to delve into the dungeon and explore its treasures.</p> 
                   <p>Best of all, you can join in on this event! Organizers who are interested can contact Nicholas at novaorganizedplay@gmail.com to information on how to sign up. Any participating store can earn the same rewards, and participate in the interactive special, no matter where you are in the country!</p> 
                   <p>Toys for Tots is a charity toy drive run by the United States Marine Corps (USMC). For 75 years, they’ve collected new toys to send to families in need, to ensure that their children have a happy holiday season. Retailers who register as a Toys for Tots dropoff location can see increased foot traffic from community members looking to donate to a worthy cause.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Flexibility is a must on Pulonis.</p> 
                   <p>The first thing a kit learns after taking their first steps is to make sure to stretch and limber up before running and climbing. Pahtra households often start their mornings with family stretches before breakfast.</p> 
                   <p>Kyyduh may have taken this tenet too far. Sometimes. Most of the time. When they’re not taking advantage of just how flexible their body can be. When they’re not embracing the plant life that is as much a part of them as their heart and their eyes.</p> 
                   <p>They grew up surrounded by machines. Surrounded by military, by guns, by ships, by technology, all of it fueling a clash that Kyyduh hadn’t so much been born into as they’d inherited. Starlance was a good place for a pahtra family to live, and with no obvious rebel connections, Kyyduh and their siblings were fast-tracked into the Veskarium’s military academy. Their siblings took the trainings and positions offered to them, succeeding and achieving and making names for themselves. Kyyduh found that their mind couldn’t seem to keep up with the words being yelled at them, the words being scribbled and erased too quickly on the chalkboards, the words appearing in the too-thick books they were expected to read too fast. They could run and climb and lift, but they couldn’t focus long enough on their commanding officer to learn when to run and climb and lift. </p> 
                   <p>Kyyduh left the academy at the end of their twentieth summer. With what little money they had left from their parents, they booked passage on a ship for as far as their credits would take them, and wound up on the outskirts of the Holy Lands. They did a lot of manual labor there, listening to other, smarter pahtras and vesk discussing things like the biology of the plants growing, the geologic implications of magnetism on flora, the effects of radiation on fauna. The scientists were genuinely nice, even the vesk ones (maybe <em>especially</em> the vesk ones), and they explained what they were talking about to Kyyduh in a way they could understand. </p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>The camp was studying the restoration of the Holy Lands. It was funded by the Veskarium—but what isn’t, on Pulonis? Only about half their discoveries made it to Command 6, while the rest seemed to go to Hafrerren or just to random places around the Shriek. Kyyduh learned about plants, animals, rocks, and most importantly, they learned about Pulonis and other planets. They learned about storms and the Shriek, and they fell in love with the sound of winds screaming and rain pounding. </p> 
                   <p>So when the camp needed someone to fly out in a terrible storm to retrieve some valuable equipment, Kyyduh was already on the ravine crawler, ready to go. One of the scientists, an older pahtra woman named Nayawsa who often fussed over them and made sure they remembered to eat, gave them a concerned look before placing a charm of Meyel around their neck and telling them to be safe. Kyyduh gave their famous confident grin and tore off into the rain. </p> 
                   <p>The ride was longer than they expected. Despite their weatherproof gear, the rain got in between the layers and made everything cling to them. There weren’t any animals out in such a wild storm, but there were plenty of trees that couldn’t be seen until they were nearly nose-to-nose with them. Kyyduh found it easy to focus when they required all their attention to keep the craft balanced and not slam into something. They located the equipment, loaded it up, and headed back. The scientists burst into applause when they came crashing through the surrounding brush. Everyone celebrated later that evening and Kyyduh was surrounded by warmth, good drinks, and friends. </p> 
                   <p>This became their new norm. During storms they collected equipment, checked on animal spots, gathered samples, and made sure that everything in the camp kept running. They found it easy to stay focused, and their mind finally stopped moving a million miles an hour long enough for them to make sense of things when they were riding through the forests in the rain. Kyyduh developed a knack for being able to tell how bad a storm was going to be as it was forming, picking up on cloud movement and wind speed. They could sense the humidity in the air before the instruments started going off, and they were included in morning meetings about setup and missions. </p> 
                   <p>Things changed when Kyyduh took a trip through a bad lightning storm to the edge of the Shriek. Their attention flitted away when they sensed a hymothoa nearby and they jerked the controls, slamming into a huge tree they’d passed a thousand times. The world went dark. They awoke a few times to the feeling of plants surrounding them, of vines along their fur, of their friends examining them with concerned looks. </p> 
                   <p>When they finally came to, Kyyduh was <em>different.</em> They could feel it. They opened more eyes than they remembered; they looked in the mirror and saw a clash of plant-like features across their body. Their leg was different now, but that was the least startling change. A motion of their hand and their whole arm shifted into a giant claw and then back again. They spent time with their friends learning about their forms, finding that they could adapt their new changes by interacting with new plants, changing their body and their new biotech augmentations on a whim to better fit all kinds of scenarios. </p> 
                   <p>Flexibility. Adaptability. Change. Evolution. </p> 
                   <p>They found that they could change their friends, too, and when the military showed up to shut down the illegal camp, well, Kyyduh used their abilities to help everyone get away before taking off into the forest to escape off-world. They kept the charm of Meyel, though, as a reminder of a time before the Veskarium colonized their world. Nayawsa insisted. </p> 
                   <p>Kyyduh found new friends and companions. Today, they maintain their laidback attitude, their tendency to joke when things get tense. They still struggle to focus in situations where they’re not fully entranced by the subject, and their impulsivity is made worse when they evolve too much, too quickly. Their lack of a filter can cause them to tumble headfirst into tough situations, but their genuine good nature and willingness to protect others save them just as often as the thick, bark-like armor that appears on their body when they’re threatened. At day’s end, they know they’re surrounded by friends and they know they have a home world that will always be a part of them, body and soul. </p>

                   <h3>Tendril, wing, and scale</h3> 
                   <p>Starfinder isn’t just a game about hackers, telepathy, and laser pistols—it’s an intersection of the many delightfully unique aliens that you can play! <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em> presents an eclectic array of strange creatures, from extradimensional kobolds and tiny raxilite plant people to mighty dragonkin and crystalline, silicon-based urogs. Be prepared not only to uncover all-new cultures, histories, and character options, but also to learn that you don’t need a spine to pilot a starship! In this book, you’ll find: </p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The new evolutionist character class, able to transform their body to overcome any challenge!</li> 
                    <li>An in-depth look at 25 fan-favorite playable species, all with exciting character options including feats, spells, and innovative gear.</li> 
                    <li>Tools for creating your own playable species, including their appearance, culture, and abilities!</li>

                   <p>First, did you miss the <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em> overview our favorite Tomb Juice™ merchant shared in July? Don’t worry, the "<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si36?A-Midsummner-Night-s-Market-Meeting">A Midsummner Night’s Market Meeting</a>" blog has you covered if you want a refresher!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>New Class Options</h3> 
                   <p><em> an excerpt from the chapter’s introduction</em></p> 
                   <p>The <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> presents a wide range of class abilities designed to fulfill classic roles, objectives, and tropes. And while subsequent books present an even broader array of exciting character options, these often draw on broad themes from technology and magic to exploration and adventure.</p> 
                   <p><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em> changes that approach by focusing on the diverse societies of the Pact Worlds and beyond, exploring how they’ve adapted familiar character classes to best fit their cultural, environmental, and physiological needs. Along with seven species’ innovative approaches to classic classes, the classes chapter also provides a new character class—the <b>evolutionist</b>—that allows your characters to adapt swiftly to any biome or social setting. </p> 
                   <p>But you get to design, too. While creating your character, consider how your species and class concepts intersect. What cultural values shape the types of spellcasting favored by members of the species? Do cultural legends inspire adventurers to emulate ancient heroes or warn them against following in the footsteps of vilified predecessors? Is there a martial tradition that incorporates one of your species’ abilities? Does your species’ culture deemphasize a specific class’s core concepts, adapting them in unexpected ways? </p> 
                   <p>In Chapter 2, you’ll have the opportunity to create your own playable species—perhaps as the GM, or even as a player (with your GM’s approval). As you do, consider how your species’ culture(s), values, surroundings, and resources might inspire you to create new character options that showcase a people’s heritage and history. As inspiration for your own creative process, consider how the class features presented in this chapter do the same. </p>

                   <h3>Meet the Evolutionist</h3> 
                   <p>Conflict drives innovation, and in a strange and dangerous galaxy you’ve unlocked unparalleled means to adapt. By embracing mystic tradition, extensive augmentation, deliberate genetic mutation, or relying on other extraordinary means, you transform yourself into a powerful being better suited to achieving your goals. You might adopt characteristics of a ferocious chimera, an undead scion, a cybernetic paragon, or anything in between. Yet your evolution boasts a will of its own. Your abilities fight you for control in stressful situations, even while providing lethal instincts, an innate weapon, and spontaneous adaptations that help you outmaneuver, outwit, and outmatch your foes. No matter your niche, you are an adaptable combatant who forges your destiny in flesh, bone, or steel.</p>

                   <h3>Species of Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p>This chapter delves into 25 of Starfinder’s most popular species—chosen in part by our fans in a public survey in 2021. Each article explores the physiology, home world, society, and innovations in unprecedented detail. This chapter also presents the long-awaited system for creating your own playable species in Starfinder, including guidelines for design, sample abilities, and questions to ask yourself throughout the creative process to inspire a fun, engaging, and believable new species. </p> 
                   <p><b>Playable Species of Starfinder</b><br> The Starfinder Roleplaying Game has a staggering number of alien species for you to pick from when creating a character. This [five-page!] section provides a snippet of physical and cultural information for those that exist at the time of printing, to help you choose!</p> 
                   <p><b>Custom Species Builder</b><br> The Starfinder Roleplaying Game provides more than 100 playable species to choose from, but it’s missing a particularly fascinating species: the one you’ve yet to create! This article gives you tools and tips for making your own contribution to the galaxy’s panoply of species (while ensuring it’s of an appropriate power level for most games). Of course, you’ll still want to collaborate with your GM and other players to make sure it’s a good fit for your game.</p>

                   <h3>NPC Gallery</h3> 
                   <p>Nonplayer characters are an essential part of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, and having a wide suite of pre-built NPCs to choose from can be a boon to any gamemaster. This chapter presents 72 NPCs of varying themes and CR, complete with stat blocks and suggestions for incorporating them into your game. Populate cities and space stations with a variety of compelling NPCs, or flesh out a story for one and have them serve as the PCs’ primary antagonist—employ them as you wish! </p> 
                   <p>Have fun exploring the galaxy, and thanks for playing Starfinder! </p>

The Lorespire Complex is already abuzz with discussion about who will replace him and how that might change the Society.</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> 
                   <p>In October, we released <b>27</b> new products. That’s a lot of content! Let’s take a look at what’s newly sanctioned and what’s coming up.</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> 
                   <p>Obviously, the big headline is the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/kingmakerap"><em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em></a>. This giant is now sanctioned for play; unlike previous adventures, instead of chronicle sheets for distinct parts, <em>Kingmaker</em> has one generic chronicle sheet. GMs should give out a chronicle for every 3 levels their players earn while establishing their kingdom.</p> 
                   <p>Additionally, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide"><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a> is now sanctioned! This book contains seven shorter adventures featuring some of the companions, and there are chronicle sheets available for each of them. Completing these adventures will grant players access to specific character options provided by those companions.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, King Merlokrep rides again in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e4g?Pathfinder-Adventure-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King"><em>Crown of the Kobold King</em></a> adventure! This module takes some classic first edition adventures and updates them for second edition play. The module is sanctioned for play in two halves; each half grants one level’s worth of XP and commensurate rewards.</p> 
                   <p>This month, our major release is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dxx"><em>Lost Omens: Impossible Lands</em></a>. Our sanctioning for this book is complete and it should be ready to post on street date. After that, we’ll start work on creating boons for the character options in the Blood Lords Adventure Path, as well as clearing some time on our schedules for the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dvy"><em>Treasure Vault</em></a> release.</p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> 
                   <p>Over in Starfinder, the Drift Crisis is ongoing, and now you can experience it with the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers"><em>Drift Crashers</em> Adventure Path</a>! This adventure is now sanctioned for play; chronicle sheets are available on the product pages, and the character options are listed on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>.</p> 
                   <p>This month also brings the release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w"><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em></a>, a very exciting book that dives into some of Starfinder’s most popular species and brings the new evolutionist class to life! We’re still working on our internal review of this book, but it’s looking good for a street date sanctioning on this as well. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4x"><em>To Defy the Dragon</em></a>, the standalone adventure, will also be released in November, along with its sanctioning documents. After those two, it’s pretty quiet on the Starfinder front until the release of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy2"><em>Drift Crisis Case Files</em></a> in early 2023.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>FAQ Answers and Boons</h2> 
                   <p>We’ve got some answers to some new FAQs over on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">Pathfinder Society page</a>! While the big headline is the questions to “how do undead PCs even work in PFS,” there are a couple of others regarding animal companions that have been outstanding for a while now. Go ahead and check them out!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> 
                   <p>We award Campaign Service Coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p> 
                   <p>This month, we were able to award Campaign Coins at CinCityCon, Scarefest, and Gobloween. Congratulations to:</p> 
                   <p>Erika Emrick, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #<b>875</b><br> Jess Miller-Camp, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #<b>878</b><br> and Landon Hatfield, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #<b>879</b></p> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Nova for SFS, and one GM earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Joseph Blomquist<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Aerine Caerwyn</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And build your kingdoms!</p>

                   <p>Yet will any of this prevent one of the grandest cities in Golarion from having the finest cuisine possible? Never!</p> 
                   <p>A good meal is its own magic, and the art of sauces and spices its own alchemy. Though the more esoteric flavors of Nexian cuisine are fictional, this heady marinade, provided by the <a href="https://honey.com/">National Honey Board</a>, might capture the experience of Nex's thick and sophisticated cuisine. Those with access to beef can marinate the meat for a lovely addition to this dish, but we've instead mixed it with couscous for a luxurious vegetarian soiree.</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <h3>Honey Spice Marinade</h3> 
                    <p>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons garlic salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1⁄2 cup honey<br> 1⁄2 cup olive oil</p> 
                    <p>Combine vinegar and seasonings, stir well. Add honey and oil, stirring until blended.</p> 
                    <h3>Honey Spice Couscous</h3> 
                    <p>2 cups water<br> 1⁄3 cup marinade<br> 8 3⁄4 ounces garbanzo beans<br> 10 -12 ounces couscous</p> 
                    <p>Prepare the couscous as directed, stirring in the marinade alongside the water.</p>

And we have a lot of ideas for your future adventures. Thus, we will continue making new content in the form of DLC for our game.”</p>

                   <p><b>Season Pass 2</b><br> New friends and enemies, dangers and rewards await you—both as extensions of the main <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> campaign and as standalone experiences.</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>DLC #4</b><br> Here comes a new companion for the Knight Commander’s party and a new playable class: the ever-changing shifter! Bolster your party with a reliable brawler capable of taking on the aspects of various wild beasts. Delve into the lost secrets of Old Sarkoris. And who knows? Maybe you will even find new love, one transcending time itself.</p> 
                    <p><b>DLC #5</b><br> This new standalone campaign picks up where the “Through the Ashes” DLC story left off. A new demon lord with hordes of frozen minions is emerging from the depths of the Abyss. With the Knight Commander busy elsewhere, what can a group of regular adventurers with no mythic powers do to save the day? This expansion offers a 6-7 hour story, which you can play independently or with the hero from your “Through the Ashes” saved game. And when you’re done, a new dungeon in the main campaign will be open for the Knight Commander to explore.</p> 
                    <p><b>DLC #6</b><br> During your first visit to Kenabres, things didn’t go well. Now that the demonic assault has been thwarted and the crusaders are preparing their final counterattack, why not take a little break? Kenabres, burned and rebuilt, is holding a new festival, and the Knight Commander will be the guest of honor. This is your chance to spend some quality time away from the battlefields together with your companions—and, perhaps, go on a special date with your loved one. Be careful, though: the war isn’t over yet, and even the new, peaceful Kenabres might be hiding its share of secrets...</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Do YOU have what it takes to become the next First Seeker of the Starfinder Society?</p> 
                   <p>Three years ago, First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo fulfilled her mandate as head of the Starfinder Society and announced her retirement. Four prominent Starfinders stepped forward to vie for the mantle of First Seeker. Each candidate was based on the character of real-world players who had purchased the “Rising Star” boon. These candidates were featured in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-07: Four for the First</em></a>. Starfinder Society players from around the world cast their votes and elected Ehu Hadif Ko’ra Amares of Clan Tolar as our First Seeker.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/63d2e38f-87aa-42b0-9390-4e86a46ccbcd/PZOSFS0300EXTRA_EhuHadif_2000.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/63d2e38f-87aa-42b0-9390-4e86a46ccbcd/PZOSFS0300EXTRA_EhuHadif_2000.png" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Artist Beatrice Pellagatti: First Seeker Ehu Hadif, a male kasatha in red armor, examines a datapad."></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>In many ways, Ehu is the quintessential Starfinder. He recentered the Starfinder Society around themes of exploration and research, and broadened our horizons in Near Space and the Vast. When faced with trials and tragedies, Ehu has held the Starfinder Society together, ushering us through the Data Scourge digital attacks, the devastating Drift Crisis, and inner turmoil. The future has more excitement in store for Ehu Hadif but, much like Luwazi Elsebo, Ehu has fulfilled his mandate as First Seeker. With the culmination of the (currently unannounced) Season Six of the Starfinder Society, Ehu will be stepping down as First Seeker and a new crop of Starfinder Society agents will step forward as candidates to take his place.</p> 
                   <p>It is therefore my honor to announce the release of a new boon: <b>First Seeker Candidate</b>. This boon is available for purchase to Starfinder Society characters with at least 45 Reputation with any faction. When you purchase this boon, you’ll be directed to send us an email with specific information about your character. This boon is only available for a limited time, during the lead up to Ehu Hadif’s retirement. Your last day to submit your entry for consideration is January 16th, 2023.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re one of the players who qualified and submitted your character for consideration after Ehu’s election using the “Rising Star” or “Starfinder of Note” boons, rest assured that we still have your character’s application, and they’ll be entered into consideration alongside all our new candidates! If you would like to update any previous submissions, please email us at organizedplay@paizo.com with any new information, including your character’s goal as First Seeker.</p> 
                   <p>The Starfinder Society is a living campaign influenced and shaped by players all over the world. This is a tradition I’m proud to uphold. To all of our fans, players, volunteers, and GMs: thank you for your continued support and engagement. I look forward to embarking on this exciting journey with all of you!</p> 
                   <p>And to all of our First Seeker candidates: I wish you the best of luck!</p>

                   <h2>The Pathfinder Kingmaker Suite</h2> 
                   <p>Back in 2019, mere months after the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition, we also ran a <a href="https://www.gameontabletop.com/cf194/kingmaker-10th-anniversary.html">crowdfunding campaign</a> to update and expand the Kingmaker Adventure Path. Today, we’re thrilled to announce the Stolen Lands are once again yours to explore, with 13 different products using the Pathfinder First Edition, Second Edition, or the 5E rules systems.</p> 
                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/kingmakerap">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a> presents a full-length campaign that chronicles the rise of a new nation—a kingdom built and ruled by your player characters! Face off against bands of bloodthirsty bandits, deadly and dangerous monsters, and mysterious menaces from other realities as you fight to claim the Stolen Lands as your own. Will you rule with justice and mercy, or will you become the very monsters you fought to oppose? In the Kingmaker Adventure Path, the destiny of the world’s newest nation is yours to decide!</p>

                   <p>A Starfinder Bounty designed for 1st-level characters.</p> 
                   <p>A century ago, tragedy claimed the lives of the patients and staff at a rural Castrovelian hospital. Now, thanks to a profitable land deal, investors from the nearby city of Qabarat have given the town a means to demolish the dilapidated building and build a brand new laboratory in its place. All that remains is to enter the hospital and clear it for demolition. There’s just one catch: the hospital is haunted, and no one in town dares enter… It’s up to a team of outside troubleshooters to brave the hospital’s haunted halls and clear the site for demolition! Will our heroes survive their brush with the past? Or will they be the hospital’s latest victims?</p>

                   <p>A skull with glowing eyes was among the many objects which recently turned up in the Pathfinder Society’s vaults, and none of the other objects are quite so talkative as this one! In fact, the skull isn’t an object at all, but a person. The Society isn’t sure who, or what, they are, and the skull seems to have lost their memories. Nonetheless, the skull requests—no, insists—that the Society return them to their former glory at once!</p> 
                   <p>Grand Archivist Zarta Dralneen has determined that the skull is from Quantium, the magic-filled capital of Nex. She dispatches a group of Pathfinders to conduct a simple research mission and guide the skull around the city, hoping to jar the skull’s memories and learn the truth.</p>

Paizo invited me to write a guest blog to announce the newest project from Campaign Coins. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/campaigncoins/pathfinder-coins-of-absalom">Coins of Absalom</a> is now live on Kickstarter!

                   <p>Andre started our company because he thought it would be much cooler to have actual treasure on the table rather than just recording your wealth on a character sheet. He was so right! It makes finding loot far more rewarding, and a player can estimate what equipment and magic items they can afford easily by counting their gold by hand! At Campaign Coins, we love party shopping sessions.</p> 
                   <p>For our first Pathfinder coin range the obvious place to start was <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens">Absalom, City of Lost Omens</a>. All adventurers come here to make their fortunes or disappear into the nearby Abomination Vaults. We suggested that the gold coins could represent the key landmarks of the city, and it was marvelous working with Mark Moreland, Paizo’s Director of Brand Strategy, who suggested the best architecture for us to use.</p>

                   <p>Our coin designer, Brian Patterson, took inspiration from the coin illustrations by Anthony Pratt in the sourcebook and expanded them into to work for a larger set. Each coin has a unique shape so that you can tell them apart, and as they rise in value, they get bigger. All coins except the ones that represent 1 gp have a clear denomination on the back. It’s probably true that in Golarion the coins wouldn’t have numbers (they don’t have ATMs, after all), but the inclusion of this detail makes it easier for players to track wealth at the table. </p> 
                   <p>We’ve curated a number of coin sets to assist at different levels of play, and each set has a mix of coins designed to make it easy to make change at the table. The <b>Inns of Absalom set</b> has a range of copper and silver coins in 1 and 5 denominations. Once you have 10 coppers, change up to 1 silver, and the same with silver to gold. The coins in this set are perfect for food and lodging. The <b>Markets of Absalom set</b> has low-gold denominations in 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s and 20s, which can serve as ideal loot for early adventures and help characters purchase more equipment and starting magic items. The <b>Trademaster of Absalom set</b> represents the highest values of treasure with 50s, 100s, 500s and 1,000s, for when the adventurers start bringing in bigger hauls.</p> 
                   <p>We honestly can’t wait to see these in action in Pathfinder games and have a range of stretch goals planned as we explore Absalom together. (No surprise that our favorite district is The Coins!) <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/campaigncoins/pathfinder-coins-of-absalom">Coins of Absalom</a> will be on Kickstarter until November 23, 2022.</p>

                   <p>These books are ideal companion volumes for the <b><em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> Anniversary Edition</b>, whether you choose to play the new Pathfinder Second Edition version, the classic original for Pathfinder First Edition with the expanded material from the new project, or with the <em>Kingmaker Bestiary (5E)</em>. This is doubly true if you include the incredible <em><b>Ultimate Kingdoms</b></em> add-on, which features a metric ton of terrific new content for kingdom-building, mass combat, strongholds, intrigue, and so much more—created by the same authors that wrote the official kingdom rules for Pathfinder First Edition in <em>Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign</em> and the new rules for Pathfinder Second Edition in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>! </p> 
                   <p>Best of all, these books are not just done being written; they're already nearly ready! <b><em>Ultimate Kingdoms</em></b> and the <em><b>Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium</b></em> are 100% complete. Layout is done on the 5E and Pathfinder Second Edition versions of the <b><em>Faerie Bestiary</em></b>, though we may add some special magnificent monsters with stretch goals! Meanwhile, both versions of <em><b>Faerie Campaigns</b></em> are in layout now. We should have PDFs ready to go in December and will be ordering books and minis before the end of the year, like this fuzzy feline friend!</p>

                   <p>Explore a world where cities are built on foundations of genies and wishes, where undead legions clash against titanic war engines forged from flesh. Travel a region where magic still writhes and roils from the wounds inflicted upon it—from the cavern depths where all spells lie dead to the scarred desert where the slightest arcane spark can erupt into a maelstrom. Can your heroes make their mark on a land ruled by the cruel egos of so many others, in the heart of the Impossible Lands?</p>

                   <p>To better imagine the Impossible, discover the following excerpt from the Introduction.</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>There’s a land where the dead toil in the fields, where a mortal can walk alongside bleached-bone skeletons and pale and hungry ghouls, where the quick and the dead live under one roof. It’s a land where a goddess once ruled, a ghost now reigns, and blood is currency. It’s a land where forever has a different meaning entirely, and eternity is a matter of law and not luck. Impossible? Not in Geb.</p> 
                    <p>There’s a land where wizards build things of steel and sinew and spell, where great colossi of otherworldly metals guard the gates to a city of wonder, where monsters walk and talk and trade on the streets. It’s a land of piercing spires and spiraling stairways, skewering the heavens and shattering reality. It’s a land where things live that shouldn’t live, lakes and weapons and stranger things besides. Impossible? Not in Nex.</p> 
                    <p>There’s a land where one can learn to speak with the moon and the stars; where flame and iron, wind and wave are courses of study for the devout and the dedicated. It’s a place where genies dwell and wishes become wonders; where the elements are matters of heritage and experience, not merely philosophy. It’s a land of curses and cycles, where all things come round once more. Impossible? Not in Jalmeray.</p> 
                    <p>There’s a broken land where magic runs wild and rampant, or else dead and stagnant. It’s a land where the souls of armies still shamble in misery, and where storms of broken glass and poisonous fog arise without warning. It’s a land where there’s life without wizards, and also a land where wizards broke the world in their wars. It’s a land where, on a clear night, you can see through the great spell-storms and look across a hundred worlds. Impossible? Not in the Mana Wastes.</p> 
                    <p>There’s a city where artisans make weapons that can kill gods and demons. It’s a city in the shadow of an ancient fortress, but it’s a place of new things and new ideas, where new people make new wonders and new horrors. It’s a city of guns and cannons, from little pistols to great, belching bombards, as powerful as any archmage. Impossible? Not in Alkenstar.</p> 
                    <p>The Impossible Lands aren’t. But they might seem so to outsiders.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <h3>New People of the Impossible Lands </h3> 
                   <p>“Residents sometimes boast that the Impossible Lands have more strange and diverse peoples living there than anywhere else in the world, and there’s certainly a grain of truth to this claim.”</p>

                   <h3>Possible Adventures</h3> 
                   <p>Find your path to 20 levels of adventure in the Impossible Lands in the <a href="">Blood Lords Adventure Path</a>. The undead nation of Geb gains most of its trade from the export of food grown on zombie-worked farms, but one farm has been the site of a series of strange occurrences. The Blood Lords Adventure Path is a six-part, monthly campaign in which the characters rise from skilled troubleshooters to join the Blood Lords who rule a land of the dead.</p> 
                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/outlawsOfAlkenstar">Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path</a> offers Western, steampunk-inspired Pathfinder play. A ragtag band of gunslinging outlaws get their hands dirty in the greasy alleyways and whisky-soaked saloons of Alkenstar, the City of Smog. To get revenge on the mogul who destroyed them, the renegades will have to stick up an illicit bank, foil a crooked shieldmarshal, and escort a reclusive inventor to safety.</p>

                   <p>Of these top performers, three (<em>NPC Index: Spellcasters</em>, <em>NPC Index: Warriors</em>, and <em>Smoke and Sail</em>) also include a separate FoundryVTT module download to import the new rules into a campaign on the platform, which helped boost them into both the top earners and most popular categories for titles on Infinite.

Another Starfinder team, led by the dashing ryphorian Merin, is already on site and reports that the residents of Vault-23A have successfully fought off the forces of the mysterious Vault Lord—a tyrant who seeks to seize <em>Salvation’s End</em> as their kingdom. Buoyed by their victory, the vault residents have no desire to evacuate their home. You’ve been called in to back up these junior Starfinder agents, convince the residents of Vault-23A it’s time to leave, and learn about the Vault Lord’s forces. Better get a move on! You never know when the Vault Lord will launch their next attack.</p>

                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!</p> 
                   <p>The Year of Boundless Wonders just continues to give and grow as we move forward! This month we’ll be traveling to the incredible city of Quantium, the capital of Nex in order to investigate one of the mysterious magical artifacts discovered in our introduction!</p>

The talking (and talkative!) skull, Zykyryz, knows the secret to her past lies within this city. It’s up to the Pathfinder Society agents with her to find the clues that will piece together her mysterious history. However, as with all wondrous delights, there’s someone lurking behind the curtain, waiting to snatch Zykyryz from the Society’s hands and steal her power for their own nefarious purposes!</p> 
                   <p>That’s all for now, Pathfinders!<br> Remember: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">All hail King Merlokrep, First of His Name, All-Mighty King of the Truescale Kobolds, and Bearer of the Crown of the Kobold King!</p> 
                   <p>Originally envisioned to compliment the longer-form campaign play offered in the Pathfinder Adventure Path, our standalone adventure line has visited a staggering number of locations and featured an equally staggering number of villains and plots. This month we’re returning to where it all started, with a compilation, revision, and expansion of a series of adventures tied together by one very infamous kobold, King Merlokrep!</p> 
                   <p>The original adventure began with <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em> (written by Jason Bulmahn and F. Wesley Schneider), which had the distinction of being the first published adventure module set in Golarion. It was soon followed up by <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> (written by Nicolas Logue). A sequel further expanding this adventure’s location, <em>Hungry are the Dead</em> (written by Tim Hitchcock) came out several months later—all before we published the first edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game!</p> 
                   <p>I hope you enjoy this latest incarnation of <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> (which features a brand-new level of the dungeon created by Nicolas Logue)! It was a blast going through these old adventures and marveling at not just how much has changed over nearly two decades, but also how those early adventures set the foundation for the world of Golarion. Let us know if you enjoyed this adventure, and in particular, enjoyed the format of reprinting, revising, and expanding classic adventures in hardcover format. There are quite a few other standalone adventures in the Paizo library I’m eager to update in a similar manner, but at the same time, rest assured we’ll continue to create new mysteries, locales, and foes in the standalone adventure line as well!</p> 
                   <p>While compiling the revised <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> into a single book and updating it with Pathfinder Second Edition rules, as well as a very changed world (both in game and out), we reached out to a couple of the original authors for their memories of working on these foundational Pathfinder adventures. And for a further dive into the making of this edition of <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> (including some words from Jason Bulmahn on the creation of <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em>), don’t forget to check out our “<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si3d?Happy-Anniversary-Kobold-King">Happy Anniversary, Kobold King!</a>” blog post!</p>

                   <h3>Nicolas Logue</h3> 
                   <p>The year was 2007. The print era of <em>Dragon and Dungeon Magazine</em> had come to an end... magazines I’d loved since learning to read, both of which I’d become a prolific freelance contributor for in the years prior. My grief turned to jubilation on a dime when I was approached to write the first ever module set in Golarion: the iconic <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>.</p> 
                   <p>I wrote the entire module and appendices in one night in a Guayaki Yerba Mate-fueled bender of pure joyful creation. From my perch on a second-hand futon, I banged away maniacally at my laptop, with an empty cardboard box serving as my table, as it was the only other piece of furniture I owned at that time. That night, Droskar grew in power, and the hardy frontier town of Falcon’s Hollow was hewn from the misty eaves at the edge of Darkmoon Vale.</p> 
                   <p>Keeping with tradition, about a year later, I wrote the entirety of <em>Revenge of the Kobold King</em> on an Amtrak ride from Penn Station to Niagara Falls.</p> 
                   <p>Years later in 2012, the mad genius himself, James Jacobs, reached out and offered me the chance to create a secret hidden level in the dungeon for a future special edition. I drove to the store, picked up several more cans of Guayaki Yerba Mate, and 8 hours later as dawn rose, I finished the manuscript.</p> 
                   <p>To my memory, no other modules in my sprawling body of work were written in crucibles as smolderingly taut as those collected in this exciting hardcover anniversary edition.</p> 
                   <p>What will I do with my copy when it arrives? Who knows? Maybe I'll finally playtest it!</p> 
                   <p>May all your hits be crits, kobold-lovers!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>F. Wesley Schneider</h3> 
                   <p><em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em> was all about firsts. As the premiere adventure in a new series in a new world, every choice had weight. Who would be Golarion’s first non-player character? What sort of creature would be its first monster? What kinds of adventures would characters find? From those earliest decisions, we glimpsed a world that would develop far beyond Darkmoon Vale. While certain choices would fade, the underlying foundations of inclusivity, legendary inspiration, and reinvention would color so much of what followed.</p>

                   <p>When a fragment of an ancient alien superweapon surfaces from the depths of hyperspace, its discovery sets off a race to find the extraterrestrial doomsday device. Hopping from planet to planet in the Pact Worlds and beyond, the heroes must contend with the undead Corpse Fleet and the nihilistic Cult of the Devourer, each of which seeks to acquire the alien artifact for its own purposes. Can the heroes find and destroy the superweapon before their enemies seize control of it, or will the Pact Worlds’ sun go dark and cold, a harbinger of dead suns across the galaxy? The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/deadSuns">Dead Suns Adventure Path</a> is a complete campaign that takes starfaring heroes from 1st to 13th level.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Later this month, the beloved <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> makes its Pathfinder Second Edition debut with a slate of over a dozen products, both updating the fan-favorite campaign to the new rules set (as well as updating the Pathfinder First Edition rules and expanding into D&amp;D 5E) and incorporating content from the bestselling <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> computer game from Owlcat Games.</p> 
                   <p>In the computer adaptation of the campaign, a single-player experience, the protagonist meets, befriends, and comes to rely upon a cast of NPC companions who help form their adventuring party and rule their eventual kingdom. When we set out to bring content from the computer game into the tabletop version, we knew we wanted to include these characters, but weren’t quite sure how to do it. After all, a typical play group already has multiple PCs who do what the companions in the CRPG did.</p> 
                   <p>The result was the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide"><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a>, a 128-page sourcebook to provide GMs running Kingmaker (or any campaign, really) the tools they need to integrate more than a dozen fully fleshed out NPCs into the campaign as optional expansions to the already massive 640-page <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0d?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Adventure-Path"><em>Pathfinder Kingmaker Adventure Path</em></a>. Additionally, the guide presents rules for an optional camping system, complete with new downtime activities for players to use while exploring the Stolen Lands, and expanded weather rules.</p>

                   <h3>Using Companions</h3> 
                   <p>Seven primary companions—the barbarian Amiri, the ranger Ekundayo, the alchemist Jubilost, the bard Linzi, the rogue Nok-Nok, the cleric Tristian, and the fighter Valerie—are presented in full detail. Each has two sets of statistics—one for use when the companion first encounters the PCs, and one at a higher level for use during that companion’s personal quest. These statistics were built using the rules for character creation, not for NPCs. As such, if your group takes a shine to a companion, that NPC can level up alongside the party as if they were a PC. In that case, the choices you and your players make for that NPC take precedence over the higher level stats given for a companion.</p> 
                   <p>No statistics are presented for the five secondary companions, as their roles in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> are limited to downtime activities and kingdom management roles.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Befriending Companions</h3> 
                   <p>Companions won’t necessarily trust the PCs when they first meet. They never start their initial encounter hostile, but they need to be influenced to friendly before they’ll be comfortable allying with the PCs. Each companion is presented with a brief influence encounter, the rules for which can be found on pages 151–153 of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em></a>.</p> 
                   <p>Each companion includes several character options that have the uncommon or rare trait; once the PCs have befriended a companion, these options become available, and the PCs gain access to them. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Adventuring With Companions</h3> 
                   <p>Companions that have joined the PCs don’t need to accompany them on every encounter. They can be held back in reserve to guard a campsite, left to perform downtime activities, serve as leaders in the kingdom, and so on. But at times, it may make sense for one or more companions to accompany the PCs on their adventures. If you allow this, you’ll want to adjust encounters to account for the increased number of characters in the party, as detailed on page 489 of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Personal Quests</h3> 
                   <p>The seven primary companions each have a personal quest as part of their storyline. Though some companions provide foreshadowing to the PCs beforehand, each quest formally begins with a specific event timed to coincide with particular developments in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> and also to a specific character level for the companion. (In order to avoid the party becoming distracted with multiple personal quests at the same time, each quest triggers at a different character level.) </p> 
                   <p>Whether the PCs decide to accompany the companion on their quest is left to the players to decide. However, this book assumes that the PCs join the companion, who takes a full role in the PCs’ party through the events and encounters of the short adventure. These companion quests are therefore designed for a party of 5 characters rather than the standard 4, so encounters in these quests are slightly more dangerous than comparable encounters in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>.</p> 
                   <p>If the PCs choose not to accompany a companion on their personal quest, it’s up to you to determine the ramifications. A companion might try to tackle their quest on their own (in which case, that companion’s disappearance might serve as an additional hook to lure the PCs into that quest), they might choose to let the quest slide and not pursue it, or they might even abandon the PCs to seek help elsewhere—such as from potential rival settlements like Drelev or Pitax. In such a case, a former companion could well show up as an antagonist working against the PCs later in the campaign!</p>

                   <h3>Camping</h3> 
                   <p>In many campaigns, what happens during a party’s 8 hours of rest between adventuring is hand-waved and handled “off screen,” but the <em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em> provides fun new downtime activities to bring this daily activity to life at your table. Whether you’re using the time to learn a new feat, spell, or other rules element from one of your befriended companions or cooking one of the 27 special meals presented in the book (from level-0 jeweled rice to level-20 First World mince pie), what your party does around the campfire will influence them upon waking.</p>

                   <p>As far as I know, there’s never been a book quite like this for any tabletop RPG, and if players and GMs like it, I could see us doing similar books in the future, both as companions to other Adventure Paths or simply presenting new casts of exciting characters to enrich any campaign. </p>

                   <h2>OPC Musings</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Happy October! It’s fall, and the winds of change are blowing. When this blog is posted, I’ll be on a plane to Cincinnati for CinCityCon, and then in just a couple of weeks I’ll be headed to Asheville for Scarefest. I can’t wait to see you all! Getting to visit conventions is one of the best parts of my job; it really helps remind me why what I’m doing is important. If you’re in the area of either of these conventions, come on out and join us!</p> 
                   <p>Plenty to talk about this month so I won’t pontificate too much, let’s get right into it!</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <h2>New Boons</h2> 
                   <h3>Spooky Scary Skeletons (Send Shivers Down the Boon Store)</h3> 
                   <p>Back when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a> was sanctioned, we let you know that we had plans for allowing the skeleton ancestry in a limited capacity. Here, in the spookiest month, I’m delighted to announce that the time has come!</p> 
                   <p>Those of you who have already played <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02du4"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-02: Return to the Grave</em></a> know that, thanks to a recent expedition into the Gravelands, several skeletal adventurers were returned to Absalom. Those adventurers have elected to join us in the Pathfinder Society as they cope with their new existence!</p> 
                   <p>There is now a boon in the Achievement Point store called “Steadfast Refugee.” This boon costs 206 Achievement Points* and can only be purchased once per player. It allows you to build and play a skeleton adventurer who was traveling through Lastwall before meeting their untimely demise and rebirth</p> 
                   <p>Make no bones about it: while your character may be a skeleton, they are still expected to adhere to the ideals of the Pathfinder Society. They cannot be evil, and you as a player are expected to remember that other players have various tolerance for horror themes (not to mention that “playing the xylophone with your ribs” is funny a maximum of twice per session). Playing a skeletal character is naturally more perilous; other characters built for healing may not be able to heal you, so you may have to be more self-sufficient than normal.</p> 
                   <p>Other characters can also be assured that traveling with a skeletal Pathfinder does not violate their anathema in any way. Pharasma has been consulted on this one and while she’s not thrilled, she understands that these Pathfinders didn’t willingly become undead, so you are under no obligation to smite them on sight. PVP is still prohibited, even if your party member is using their own skull as a basilisk ball.</p> 
                   <p>*(get it, because that’s how many bones most humans have)</p> 
                   <h3>Condition Removal</h3> 
                   <p>We’ve also added a couple of new boons for condition removal in Pathfinder Society, based on requests from the community.</p> 
                   <p>First up, the Pathfinder Condition Removal boon is available for 20 AcP. It can heal a number of conditions that could also be removed by purchasing healing services with gold; however, it provides another avenue should your character find their coin purse a bit light as they slowly turn to stone. The full text is available on the FAQ page.</p> 
                   <p>Second is the Penitent Pathfinder boon! Since the beginning of the campaign, we’ve said that all characters have access to the <em>atone</em> ritual, should they violate their anathemas enough to require it. However, it’s been unclear how one learns the ritual or casts it, so we’ve simplified it. This 20 AcP boon provides the benefits of a successful <em>atone</em> ritual, provided your character still spends the 30 days of downtime in penance as required by the ritual.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2> 
                   <h3>Kingmaker Adventure Path</h3> 
                   <p>At long last, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/kingmakerap">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a> arrives later this month! We’re all excited to bring you this update of one of our most beloved adventures, and I’m even more delighted to announce how sanctioning will work!</p> 
                   <p>This adventure is unlike any other. As a sandbox adventure in one volume, it’s nigh impossible for us to determine the exact points where Chronicle Sheets should be awarded to players… so we’re not going to. The sanctioning documents will include one generic Chronicle, which GMs are instructed to award to their players for every three levels your characters achieve. This means that once characters reach levels 4, 7, 10 and so on, a Chronicle Sheet will be awarded, up to a maximum of six. You can apply these to one character or spread them across multiple as usual.</p> 
                   <p>As a bonus, we’ll also be sanctioning the adventures in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide"><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a>! Sanctioning the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive">Dark Archive Case Files</a> has gone over well, and these small personal quests with your companions are complete enough to function as standalone adventures as well. You may also find that completing these adventures unlocks new options from your companions as well…</p> 
                   <p>All these sanctioning documents will be posted on the product pages prior to street date later this month. We hope you all enjoy this new iteration of the adventure!</p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder Adventures</h3> 
                   <p>In addition to Kingmaker, we’ve got two Starfinder adventures ready for sanctioning this month! Both the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0y?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Dead-Suns"><em>Dead Suns Adventure Path</em></a> compilation and the final volume of the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers">Drift Crashers Adventure Path</a> release this month. Sanctioning documents and Chronicle Sheets for both will be posted by the end of the month as well!</p> 
                   <p>The <em>Dead Suns Adventure Path</em> will be very similar to the previous sanctioning for the six-volume iteration, and you’ll see many of the same boons as well. There’s no new rules content in this book, so you won’t see a new entry on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>, though ownership of this compilation gives you access to any character options published in it. The Drift Crashers Adventure Path will be added to the Character Options page at the end of the month as normal.</p> 
                   <h3>Sanctioning Rule Updates</h3> 
                   <p>Finally in sanctioning news, we have two rule updates to announce. First, we’ve updated the text on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a> to be clearer about how one gains access to an option printed in a Pathfinder Adventure or Adventure Path. Previously, the rule could be read incorrectly to mean that all characters had access to anything printed in an Adventure. The new text has been added to the Character Options page and is quoted below, which should hopefully be clearer to all!</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Using Options from Pathfinder Adventures or Adventure Paths</b><br> Typically, characters cannot select options from a Pathfinder Adventure. However, Chronicle Sheets from sanctioned Adventures or boons from the Achievement Points store often grant characters access to options from these Adventures.</p> 
                    <p>Ownership of Adventures or Adventure Paths is not required for Character Option use in the Pathfinder Society campaign, as long as rules are referenced from the <a href="http://paizo.com/prd">official Pathfinder Reference Document (prd)</a>.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <p>Second, with the release of the Kingmaker Adventure Path comes our first foray into producing content in-house for “the world’s oldest RPG!” We wanted to give our dedicated players a way to earn Pathfinder Society credit for running this content, even if their gaming group might be a little reluctant to switch systems. As such, the following text has been added to the Guide to Organized Play:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>If Paizo has released an official conversion of a sanctioned adventure to another game system (such as the ''Pathfinder Kingmaker Bestiary (5e)'' or ''Pathfinder Adventure Path: Abomination Vaults (5e)''), GMs and players may play these adventures using those rules and earn credit as if they had played it using Pathfinder rules. Adventures that have not been converted by Paizo in this way must be played using standard Adventure Mode rules.</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> 
                   <p>We award Campaign Service Coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p> 
                   <p>This month, several RVCs were able to award Campaign Coins on my behalf at Hurricon, SkålCon, and SydCon. Congratulations to:</p> 
                   <p><b>Shane Murphy</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#864</b><br> <b>Greg Ferguson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#865</b><br> <b>Sandra Wilkinson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#867</b><br> <b>Ryan Blomquist</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#871</b></p> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Star for PFS1, two GMs earn their 5th Nova for SFS, and three GMs earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Kyle Ashcraft<br> <b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Milan Badzic, Jim Crase<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Brad Fiske, Ivis Flanagan, Shannon Steward</p> 
                   <p>I want to recognize Milan Badzic in particular. He is, to the best of my knowledge, the first person to complete the Triple Crown, having earned the 5th rank in Pathfinder Society (first edition), Pathfinder Society (second edition), and Starfinder Society. That’s no easy feat, and I truly don’t know if we’ll see it matched anytime soon. Congratulations, Milan, and please enjoy some time off, you’ve earned it!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>As I mentioned at the top, I’ll be attending CinCityCon and Scarefest this October, and I’ll also be joining the Minnesota crew at <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/skalconline-2022">SkålCOnline</a> in November for some Dark Archive weirdness. But as the year closes out, we’ve got plenty of events, both online and in-person, for you to finish strong! Check out our <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">convention calendar</a> for all the latest listings. </p>
                   <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And have a spooktacular month!</p>

                   <p>I want to hit the main changes we’re planning to make. These aren’t necessarily the final changes, as our internal testing and number-crunching might nix some of them. Also, there are many other small changes I won’t be covering here to keep things brief(ish)—some of you dropped fun little ideas that we’ll just implement, but aren’t massively important to the bigger picture of the class.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> Overall, the class had good ratings, but not top tier. If it went in the book as-is, it would be pretty effective and fun, but we think there’s clear room for improvement to make it a standout. Respondents vastly preferred the impulses of the playtest over expressing elemental powers as spellcasting of any kind. One common refrain though, was that damage was too low, especially on many of the overflow abilities. We were pretty conservative on the playtest, and we’ll be carefully turning some of the damage up. We’re also planning to reduce the overall number of overflow impulses while dialing up their effects, keeping the trait just for those impulses that have a major effect on the battle and feel worth spending a lot of actions to do.</p> 
                   <p>Though the class is intended to be pretty focused on combat, we do have some concerns about the lack of options for kineticists during exploration, downtime, and the like. We’ll be seeing what we can do to make feel less narrow in those situations. It’s yet to be determined whether that comes in the form of more skills, some specific abilities, or a mix.</p> 
                   <p><b>Complexity vs. Simplicity:</b> The big challenge of this class is making it simple enough that it’s accessible and fun for a new player or a player who wants to play a character with a more straightforward playstyle. Many of the classes after the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em> have needed to be more complex to convey their concept. With the kineticist, we wanted to pull this back! Attaining the variety the class needs while not adding even more rules to remember is tricky, but rest assured we want the final class to make sense for its target audience. We did have a small number of respondents who wanted many different mechanics in the class at once (like having impulses, focus spells, cantrips, AND burn), but we’re not looking to go in that direction so that we can keep things streamlined. </p> 
                   <p>Our ultimate goal is to have a class that feels extremely adept with their elements or elements. They will resemble a non-spellcaster in that they have a small set of tools they’ve very strong with, but also will resemble a spellcaster in their ability to create magical effects and straightforward focus on their impulses. It’s worth noting that, because kineticists have fewer tools, some impulses will just be stronger than comparable spells. Wings of Air from the playtest was often noted as being stronger than <em>fly</em>, but it’s intentional that the kineticist who is fully dedicated to mastering air is better at flying than a wizard who knows many spells and simply prepares one spell slot with a <em>fly</em> spell.</p> 
                   <p><b>Lack of Clarity:</b> One of the major problems we saw frequently was confusion over the intended role of certain parts of the class. What was meant to be important? What’s more of a side benefit? We saw this in attack rolls vs. class DC, the specialty of each element, the difference between overflow impulses and other impulses, and so on. We’re looking to streamline these for the final, to introduce bigger differences and clearer paths. For one example, multiple elements having healing abilities made it a bit muddy about what “belonged” to each element. So, for the final, expect each element to have a clearer identity while still allowing enough variety to not feel too stale. </p> 
                   <p><b>Elemental Blast:</b> The contrast between Elemental Blasts and other impulses touches on the lack of clarity too. After seeing feedback, we’re looking at switching it to function similarly to other impulses and act more like an attack cantrip. This will likely require something similar to a spell attack roll, letting you use your Constitution for it. This has several benefits: it should let us simplify how it works, make Con clearly the best choice for your top ability score, free up kineticist characters’ ability boosts for a wider variety of characters, and still allow upgrades to the blast. This does leave some challenges, especially around a kineticist’s item loadout. </p> 
                   <p>We intend to move any “use your element as a weapon” options into the Elemental Weapon feat so that still remains as an option—especially for melee kineticists. The final form of the Elemental Blast is still to be decided, since it relies on a lot of other moving parts, but we intend to keep it as a versatile option with some variety between the elements.</p> 
                   <p>There was plenty of disagreement among playtesters about whether the class should be primarily a single-target damage dealer or be built around more varied effects. Much of this had to do with whether the player believed the Elemental Blast or the other impulses were the core mechanic of the class. Going all-in on single-target blasts can lead to extremely stagnant, repetitive play, so we aren’t planning to make that the sole focus. However, we will be exploring what room we have for boosting single-target damage as an option for those who want it, without making that the only role the class can fill.</p> 
                   <p><b>Constitution?:</b> The survey asked whether people preferred Constitution or a mental score for class DC. Though the responses wanting a mental score were quite low, there were a significant number of write-in responses that liked Con but also wanted it to be more important to the class. Looking at the issue and the target audience of the class, we’re planning to make Constitution matter a bit more so it’s the <em>clear</em> choice for your top ability score. This should allow more flexibility in other scores and open up a broader array of character concepts.</p> 
                   <p>The change to Elemental Blast noted above is linked to this. We might also use Constitution for damage on some impulses or in certain circumstances.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gates:</b> We had a mixed bag of feedback about the gate options (dedicated gate, dual gate, and universal gate). Taking it as a whole, we’re currently leaning toward having a dedicated gate or dual gate option at 1st level, with class feature later on that let a kineticist either further specialize in an element they can channel or to expand to a new element. Universal gate had issues at low levels because it felt like the best option in some ways, but was also limited too severely by a small number of impulses. We think the new version will enable a story of a kineticist developing their elemental breadth over time in a more organic way, rather than locking them in tightly at level 1 with nowhere to grow.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gathering your Element:</b> Many playtesters noted that Gathering an Element felt like an action tax. Lots of folks equated it with drawing a weapon, which was the intended equivalent, but many people really wanted it to be more exciting, like the actions a swashbuckler can use to gain panache. There were also some mentions that it could be too much bookkeeping to track multiple elements for dual gate and universal gate—easy to forget which one you currently have gathered. The current plan for this part of kineticist play is to replace gathering an element with a process that serves a similar rules function, but has a theme that’s a bit more fun and fits the kineticist’s presentation a bit better.</p> 
                   <p>Our current thinking is to have the kineticist surrounded with their kinetic aura at all times, letting their elements swirl around them. The aura doesn’t have any effect on its own—it’s just for show—though dedicated gate kineticists might get a minor benefit. To use an impulse, the kineticist directs the flowing elements with a free hand. Overflow impulses exhaust the aura, similar to expending a gathered element in the playtest. It would then take a single action to cause a resurgence from your inner gate, also granting an added benefit. This might be using a kinetic aura impulse to alter the effect of the aura, making an Elemental Blast, or a specific benefit related to an element. The final form will depend on the complexity of the other options in the class. We think this will be easier to understand, link better to other abilities within the class, and better tell the class’s story.</p> 
                   <p><b>Manipulate Trait:</b> There was a lot of conversation about the manipulate trait triggering Attacks of Opportunity and putting the melee kineticist in danger. This isn’t a factor in most combats, but in combats against many monsters with Attack of Opportunity, it’ll get you dead in a hurry! The discussions about this reinforced that the inclusion of concentrate and manipulate on all impulses was carried forward from how spells work... and these aren’t supposed to be just like spells! So, it’s likely the final impulses will still include concentrate, but manipulate will only appear on impulses where it’s essential to the action taking place in the story.</p> 
                   <p><b>Burn:</b> Burn was a hot topic, as expected! Survey feedback found that using impulses and gathering elements came out ahead, even when we combined burn and the “other” survey choice. There were plenty of votes for burn and for “other,” though, so it was far from a blowout. Fundamentally, we’re aiming at the “nonstop magic” fantasy for this class—the kineticist isn’t meant to be about long-term resource management. That means burn has to clear a pretty high bar to be included, since it pulls the class into relying more on resource management and limited-use abilities. Most suggestions we’ve seen so far for including a burn-type mechanic lead to the class feeling either too heavy on long-term planning, or too repetitive or exploitable. We’ll continue looking at possibilities as we work on the final version. It’s possible there might be a niche for implementing burn as an option for those interested, provided we find a way to make it dynamic.</p> 
                   <p><b>More Stuff... and Less Stuff:</b> The kineticist is a very big class, as we want each element to feel fun and distinct, and keeping it within the book’s page count is pretty difficult. As we add more elements to the class for the final version, there’s a high likelihood we’ll have to condense and trim back some other options. We’re aiming to condense down some of the overly complex bits rather than chopping whole impulses, but we might end up between a rock and a hard place, so be forewarned!</p>

                   <h3>Initial Playtest and Design</h3> 
                   <p>We did a bit of a different process for the kineticist class design, as mentioned when I talked about James Case’s prototype kineticist character. That was part of an early playtest with the design team, Solomon St. John, and Shay Snow. Each designer made a single kineticist character. Not a list of feats, proficiencies, and all that—just the most basic playable character possible. Jason Bulmahn GMed a short adventure, and we tried out many different takes on the class! This hearkens back to the very first days of 2nd edition design, when we did something similar with a cleric, fighter, rogue, and wizard based on some basic benchmarks.</p> 
                   <p>How about another peek behind the curtain? Here are the elemental webs showing the strengths of the various elements. This was for the playtest version, so you’ll see some big alterations for the final as we differentiate the elements more, as mentioned above. Metal and wood were purely speculative! We didn’t write any impulses for those before the playtest.</p>

The name of a zuhra damaj is etched in Talican on the only part of the item that is unchanging. You gain a +3 item bonus to your Reflex DC against attempts to Disarm an item you’re holding in your hands.</p> 
                    <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] command, Interact; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Requirements</b> You’re wielding a weapon made primarily of metal; <b>Effect</b> You extend the weapon and call out the zuhra’s name. It channels its magic through the gloves to assist you with its choice of offense or defense (as determined by the GM). The zuhra makes any choices for the spell, and any save DC is 30.</p> 
                    <p> <b>Offense</b> The metal of the gloves wraps around your weapon and channels the zuhra’s magic to cast a 6th-level <em>weapon storm</em> spell, replicating the metal weapon.</p> <b>Defense</b> The metal flows off your arms, creating a <em>blade barrier</em>. The blades have the appearance of your weapon. You lose the <em>damaj’s gloves’</em> item bonus until the barrier ends, at which point the metal returns to your hands and forearms. You can Dismiss the activation.

                   <p>So warns a popular nursery rhyme among the parents in the town of Otari, as they often sing the melodious but unsettling poem to their children at night to encourage good behavior. As a result, everyone who grows up in Otari has a healthy mix of fear, respect, and curiosity for the old ruins out in Fogfen and the strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp’s heart.</p> 
                   <p>As they grow older, townsfolk learn what’s more often accepted as truth: that the heroic founders of Otari had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago. For a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around the lighthouse called <em>Gauntlight</em>, but today, common knowledge holds that the place has become a haven for pests—no longer a source of active danger or significant treasure after being completely picked over. Nearly 500 years have passed since Belcorra’s defeat after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace to Otari through sinister rhymes.</p> 
                   <p>Or so the citizens of Otari believe.</p>

                   <p>Spiteful evil stirs beneath the mysterious lighthouse called <em>Gauntlight</em>. When the lighthouse emits an eerie glow, locals suspect that something sinister threatens the countryside. Brave heroes must explore the ruins around the lighthouse and delve into the dungeon levels beneath it. Hideous monsters, deadly traps, unexpected allies, vengeful ghosts, and more await the heroes who dare to enter the sprawling megadungeon called the Abomination Vaults! The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path is a complete campaign taking heroes from 1st to 11th level.</p>

                   <h3>Joseph Blomquist</h3> 
                   <p>As a Nuyorican, my relationship to Puerto Rico was challenging at first. Whenever I went to PR, I was the only cousin that barely spoke any Spanish. A real connection came with food—especially once my grandmother introduced me to a tiny local fruit, the quenepa. Each island has a different name for quenepas, and it was extremely difficult to get back home in NY. It was a great start to a lifelong love of Puerto Rico and a reminder of an amazing woman that never knew how much her grandson cherished every moment we shared.</p>

                   <h4>Glowberry — Level 1</h4> 
                   <p><b>Magic Item</b><br> <b>Price</b> 5 per bunch<br> <b>Bulk</b> L per bunch<br> <b>Capacity</b> 10; <b>Usage</b> 1/hour<br> A <em>glowberry</em> is a bioluminescent fruit that grows in tropical regions throughout Castrovel. The bright-orange fruit begins to glow immediately when the thin, green-brown peel is broken and the fruit is exposed. The flesh continues to glow even if cut into pieces or pulverized into a liquid. Glowberries grow in bunches on trees that can grow as tall as 100 feet, often bearing thousands of bunches every season. While the colloquial name <em>glowberry</em> is common for the popular fruit throughout the Pact Worlds, each individual Castrovellian culture has a different name for the fruit. When the fruit is exposed, a <em>glowberry</em> increases the light level by one step in a 10-foot radius for 1 hour.</p>

                   <h3>Carlos Cabrera</h3> 
                   <p>Art in one form or another has always run in my father's side of the family. I have a younger sister who paints, my late father and one of my older brothers draw (cartoon art and comic book art, respectively), and I've been known to draw, write, and design games. I also have an uncle who can play Santana by ear, the musician by which I acquired my name. My father was a huge fan of Santana's music, and on my mother's side my grandfather's name was Charles, so they agreed. Over the years I've dabbled in music here and there, be it ukulele or electric bass, and most recently classic guitar.</p> 
                   <p>I thought it would be a special idea to create a magical guitar: an instrument that not only played the piece of culture being performed but also granted a memory. This instrument can most often be found within the hands of a calaca, which I designed for the first edition of Pathfinder and Luis Loza brought into second edition <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2019/11/monstrous-physique-calaca-and-catrina-psychopomps-2e/">here</a>.</p>

From the correct angle, the guitar’s scratches and marks seem to form a simple picture, such as an environmental scene or a crude face.</p>

When sharing with an audience, you share a memory of yours with anyone within 30 feet. This has the effects of <em>mindlink</em> for anyone that can hear the music. </p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [three-actions] Interact; <b>Frequency</b> once per month; <b>Effect</b> You play the guitar and the instrument attempts to help you recover a lost memory. You can either have a specific memory in mind, such as trying to remember a childhood event, or let the guitar find a memory for you. You recall the moment with perfect clarity and reestablish it permanently in your mind with the failure effects of <em>modify memory</em>. </p>

                   <h3>Luigi Lizza González</h3> 
                   <p>When I was a kid, I joined my school's music club and discovered the cajón drum: a wooden, box-shaped percussion instrument primarily used in Criolla and Afro-Peruvian music. You play it by slapping the sides and corners to mark the beat and guide the dancers. At first glance, it doesn't look like it could generate a great variety of sounds, but you would be surprised. Also, that instrument helped me realize how much I enjoy working in tandem with others to create something beautiful (in this case, music).</p> 
                   <p>As a person born and raised in Perú, the dream of entering the gaming industry seemed so distant and unattainable that, for a long time, I didn't even think of trying to accomplish it. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Pathfinder community is one of the most welcoming spaces to be part of. So, now, as a published author and a co-owner of Eldritch Osiris Games (<a href="https://twitter.com/EldritchOsiris">@EldritchOsiris</a> on Twitter), I can explore my most quirky sides and put my love for arts, philosophy, and storytelling to good use. If you want to see my silly face and know more about my work, you can find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiLizza">@LuigiLizza</a>.</p> 
                   <h4>Guiding Cajon Drum — Item 5</h4> 
                   <p><b>Enchantment, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 160 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> held in 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> 2<br> This wooden, box-shaped percussion instrument resonates with great power when struck. The drum is large enough that you can’t play it while holding it. Instead, you sit on the drum and play it with both hands. Sitting on or standing up from the drum requires an action, which has the move trait. You’re flat-footed while sitting on the drum, but you gain a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the drum. The drum is loud and creatures within 100 feet of the drum can hear its music, regardless of the ambient noise, though it can’t penetrate silence and similar magical effects.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental); <b>Frequency</b> once per round; <b>Effect</b> You play the drum, unleashing a rhythm that gets other moving. Up to 2 allies that can hear the drum can use a reaction to Stride 5 feet.</p> 
                   <br>

                   <h3>Luis Loza</h3> 
                   <p>When I was little, I would see people playing with trompos—wooden tops that were spun by pulling on a string. People could perform cool tricks with them including scooping them up into their hands or guiding along the string in intricate manners. Trompo tricks are similar to yoyo tricks in how much coordination they require and how impressive they can be to watch. It was only much later in life that I learned that trompos weren’t exclusively a Mexican toy and were actually common throughout Latin America and even in other parts of the world. Even knowing that, trompos still feel like a Mexican thing to me, so I wanted to make a cool item that made use of one!</p> 
                   <h4>Tornado Trompo — Item 18</h4> 
                   <p><b>Air, Evocation, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 19,000 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> Various runes are carved along the entirety of this wooden top. Spinning the top requires wrapping a thick string around its base and pulling the string in a vigorous motion. Wrapping a string and pulling the string each require an Interact action. The top’s magic is connected to the power of the wind, which becomes evident when placed on a surface as it hovers in place.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] envision, Interact; <b>Requirements</b> A string is wrapped around the top and you have a hand free; <b>Effect</b> You lightly pull on the string and catch the top in your free hand. It spins in place, hovering over your open palm, sharing its power over the winds with you. You gain the effects of <em>fly</em> as long as you keep the top in your hand. You can Release the top at any time to end the effect. </p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [two-actions] command, Interact; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Requirements</b> A string is wrapped around the top; Effect You call upon the top’s power and give the string a powerful pull. The top travels across the ground in a 120-foot line. As it does, it unleashes a powerful vortex of winds, becoming a tornado temporarily. This tornado has the effects of <em>whirlwind</em> (<em>Secrets of Magic</em> 141) except that it’s not limited by being used outside or in a cramped space and can’t be sustained. Creatures in the tornado’s path must attempt a DC 38 Reflex save to determine the effects of the tornado. The tornado ends after traveling its full distance, causing any creatures that rose in the air due to a failed save to begin falling immediately.</p>

                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>My contributions to this book consisted of the "What People Know" (page 70) and "Nature and Animals" (page 96) sections. Much of my writing comes from my life, and when I wrote the nature section, I went back to my days as a nature camp counselor and how my relationship with the world around me changed when I was truly immersed in it. While I think that it's easy to get away from the mundane reality of survival in a fantasy game, I hope that this section inspires players and GMs to think about how their characters would interact with the physical world (and that many, many people will enjoy buying pet possums for their characters!).</p>

                   <p>I'm Dana Ebert, and I'm always delighted to be back with my Pathfinder family! I wrote the Cuisine chapter (page 38) (including its recipes!) for <em>Travel Guide</em>, and I had so much fun writing it that it may just be my favorite contribution to date. I had the idea early on to make the author somewhat monstrous—simultaneously reveling in the reader's attention while smugly gloating or antagonizing them. The result was Maharajah Lakadbaghasura, a rakshasa of sophistication and renown, and I hope he wins over some fans! Special thanks to everyone in the Pathfinder community who has tried out the recipes. I've been watching your reviews and they're so much fun!</p> 
                   <p>That brings me to some exciting news—I'm in the process of opening Portland's first tabletop roleplaying brewpub with some very talented people! TPK Brewing Co. is a majority queer, women-of-color-owned craft brewery coming to Portland, Oregon, in 2023. Waiting for you there will be an ale for every tale and a staff of full-time professional Game Masters ready to run your favorite games.

                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! Dustin Knight here, host of <a href="http://www.infiknight.net/">Infiknight Reviews</a>! I'm still thrilled to have been assigned the trade section of Travel Guide (page 32). Pre-industrial fantasy armchair economics is my jam, and being able to spend a week completely obsessing over the price of wool in 13th century Europe helped me pin down realistic price points that take into account everything from taxes to spoilage while still accurately reflecting the prices of equipment in Pathfinder Second Edition. I loved being able to scatter a bunch of Easter eggs throughout my section, especially in the art orders, and I can't wait to see if our readers catch them all! If you want a hint for one of the more obscure references you can check out my <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zl"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-06: The Crashing Wave</em></a>!

                   <p>I'm Aaron Lascano, a Latino writer, designer, and editor from NYC. I worked on the holiday section in the <em>Travel Guide</em> (page 24), which was a fascinating exercise in thinking about community-building and cultural practices. I really enjoy working on sections like that (you might recognize my name from <em>Monsters of Myth</em> or <em>Grand Bazaar</em>). I'm currently contributing to an indie TTRPG project, and I'm also pushing my own TTRPG system to playtest! If you want to follow my progress on a narrative-forward system that offers dynamic systems for combat, exploration, and social interactions, and that explicitly draws upon Latin American history and culture, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/devlascano">@devlascano</a> on Twitter.</p>

                   <p>Hi, I'm Stephanie Lundeen, Ph.D., and I've been a freelance writer and editor for years. The <em>Travel Guide</em> is my favorite Lost Omens book yet. I love world-building—it's my favorite part of writing for Pathfinder. And I love traveling in real life and reading travel guides, so this was a perfect project for me. It turns out that an imaginary travel guide is even better! Plus, to write the Folklore, Mythology, and Religion sections (page 80), I got to do lots of research (no joke here, I love to research) as well as be creative. I'm so excited to have been a part of this great addition to Golarion, truly one of the richest fantasy worlds around.</p> 
                   <p>In addition to writing for—and playing a lot of—Pathfinder, I play Starfinder! I'm part of an actual-play Starfinder podcast, Intrepid Heroes (<a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/">http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/</a>). I also co-write a blog devoted to another passion of mine, open adoption, at <a href="http://www.ouramazingforeverfamily.com">http://www.ouramazingforeverfamily.com</a>.</p>

                   <p>Hello! I'm Nathan Reinecke, purveyor of fine guides and obsessive studier of fictitious magic systems. I wrote about magic in the Inner Sea (page 74), a topic that's been covered a lot but always from the perspectives of ghost kings and runelords and high magical scholars. Writing from the perspective of a dabbling wizard discussing magic as seen by the normal person is probably my favorite freelancing project I've ever done.

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                   <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-American historian, educator, and author—you might recognize me from the <em>Dark Archive</em>, where my humble name graces the cover.</p> 
                   <p>In the <em>Travel Guide</em>, I wrote the Crime &amp; Law section (page 64), in which our humble hostess, tiefling black marketeer and con woman Kharmione Nyx (“Golarion’s own Saul Goodman”, as one reviewer called her) describes all the ways in which you can get in and out of trouble with the law. Come for the detailed table of legal punishments, stay for the chicken jokes.</p> 
                   <p>If you find my writing appealing, I’m also the creative director for the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler set in a world of state inquisitions, profane mechanisms, and a court system where you have to wear giant bird masks. Follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/LuminantA or check out our published products at https://luminant-age.itch.io!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Erin Roberts</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, y’all! I’m Erin Roberts, a TTRPG freelancer (and fiction writer) with recent &amp; upcoming work in <em>Lost Omens: Firebrands</em>, <em>Starfinder: Interstellar Species</em>, D&amp;D’s <em>Journeys through the Radiant Citadel</em>, and <em>Hunter: The Reckoning Fifth Edition</em>, among others. For <em>Travel Guide</em>, I had the absolute pleasure of writing two sections – retired assassin Alvinia Lodge’s entry on Time &amp; The Calendar (page 6) and tiefling art reviewer Deraaka’s section on Art &amp; Architecture (page 50).</p> 
                   <p>While there was so much to love about this project, including my browser tabs full of dance styles, water clocks and blackout poetry, my favorite part was thinking about the ways that living in Golarion makes everything from the daily ticking of the clock to the most elaborate expressions of creativity different and special. I also deeply enjoyed exploring the ways that culture and place impact the way different folks in Golarion tell time, create art, and build the structure of their worlds, all through the voices of two people who live there. Truly a dream come true. To see what I’m dreaming up next (and/or yell at me about time &amp; art), you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/nirele">@nirele</a>. </p>

                   <p><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> is an indirect sequel to <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> and takes place five years after the events of the first game in a nation of Mendev, which, led by the ever-young Queen Galfrey, has been fending off a demonic invasion for almost a century. Now, it’s your turn to take on the role of the Knight-Commander of the new crusade and make a difference in the stalemate against the demonic hordes.</p> 
                   <p><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> offers the same vast and versatile class system, familiar to the players of both the table-top version and the video game <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, but you can choose from even more classes and archetypes than the previous game.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8663fc0b-c5d9-4092-b946-098734738a39/20220929_PFWotR_ED_02.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8663fc0b-c5d9-4092-b946-098734738a39/20220929_PFWotR_ED_02.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A screenshot of turn-based battle between the Knight-Commander and her party and ash giants in the lands of the Worldwound"></a>

                   <p>New classes, feats, and abilities are not the only addition to the game’s mechanics, however. In <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em>, you will receive incredible mythic powers that will eventually allow you to rival the Demon Lords themselves and uncover their schemes. Not only will these mythic powers give you access to unique spells and abilities, they can also turn you into a totally different being. A righteous angel, a fierce demon, a freedom-loving azata, or a lich, who commands the undead. You can also become an aeon, who maintains the cosmic order; a gold dragon, who melts the hardest hearts with its kindness and compassion; or an insatiable swarm-that-walks, that will know no rest until it consumes the entire world! And if none of these paths suit you, you can choose the path of a legend, a hero who doesn’t need mythic powers and draws strengths from their own heart.</p>

                   <p>You won’t go on this adventure alone—you will be accompanied by a cast of diverse characters who will help you along the way. Some of them will offer friendship, others will be difficult to win over, and there are even a few who will fall in love with you: for example, a former succubus who dreams of redemption, Arueshalae, or a cleric of Shelyn named Sosiel, familiar to those who played the tabletop version of the Adventure Path.</p>

                   <p>The crusade system adds another strategic layer to the game and will truly put you into the shoes of a Knight-Commander. You will recruit loyal generals and troops to fight the demonic hordes, win valuable trophies, and claim the treasures of the Worldwound. You can also build fortifications on the lands you have conquered and make important decisions: establishing supply lines, recruiting political powers of Mendev to your side, and deciding how the soldiers in your army should be trained.</p>

                   <p><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition</em> will send you on a journey of 80 hours or more to the faraway land of Mendev, the desolated Worldwound region, and even the chaotic realm of the Abyss. Inspire, love, hate, or betray, then lead your followers to victory—or a fate worse than death. To arms!</p>

                   <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! We hope you’ve all enjoyed the beginning of our Year of Boundless Wonder. Our introductory scenario introduced you all to the hoard of treasures the Society is currently cataloging, and this month’s scenario will be the first dedicated to one of those artifacts!</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dvm"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-04: To Seek the Heart of Calamity</em></a> is a scenario for 3rd- through 6th-level characters. It takes place in the heart of the Thuvian desert, and it centers around the Calamitous Dagger. This mysterious dagger seems to date back to the Jitskan Imperium, and studies indicate that it—along with its twin—is pointing to a location somewhere in the desert.</p> 
                   <p>Oh, did we not mention it has a twin? And that it’s very likely in the hands of nefarious forces, which are currently working to find whatever it points to? I guess we should’ve led with that. Let me try again: Pathfinders, there’s something valuable in the desert, and someone else wants it! We can’t have that, so off you go!</p> 
                   <p>Until next time—explore! report! cooperate! and don’t forget to wear sunscreen!</p>

                   <p><b>TEST YOUR CONVICTIONS</b><br> In a land without fate and a world too often void of justice, it falls to the gods to make or break the people who call upon them for salvation—or draw their ire. Swear yourself to the might of the gods and the power of their causes, or reject their offerings to live a life that’s yours and yours alone!</p> 
                   <p><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> offers details on major gods found in the Inner Sea region, including what forms their pleasure or wrath might take. It also presents rules for over a hundred other deities and philosophies so you can find the cause that best fits your convictions and take up weapons and magic in its service!</p>

                   <p><b>TAKE A STROLL </b><br> After days or weeks cooped up in a starship on a long journey, heroes deserve some time to stretch their legs (or other ambulating appendages) and interact with their fellow citizens of the galaxy. And there’s often no better place to do so than a wide-open thoroughfare on the nearest space station! This double-sided Starfinder Flip-Mat features a luxurious plaza in an ultra-modern space station—with all the amenities it can offer—on one side. On the other, the map features a bustling, crowded marketplace perfect for finding almost any type of equipment, legal or otherwise. Starfinder Flip-Mats present ready-to-use science-fantasy set pieces for the busy Game Master.

                    <h3> The Arsenal</h3>
                   </center> 
                   <p>In our previous projects for Paizo, we’ve always played iconic characters, and we’ve always put our own spin on things. For The Giantslayer Endeavor, we tried to play the most amount of material in the shortest amount of real time ever recorded. We succeeded, with an entire Adventure Path played in six marathons across six months—fully documented, too. With The Strange Aeons Experiment, we assembled a team of gamers who knew nothing about Lovecraft or the Elder Mythos and sent them through the Strange Aeons AP to see what would happen. The list goes on, but we’ll let you check out each project as you may. </p> 
                   <p>Instead of playing iconic characters again, this project will be different: we’re playing our own characters, and going extreme with the party. Early brainstorming around the release of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> had us thinking that it would be cool to see a couple guns interact with a dungeon, which is sometimes considered the “standard unit” of an adventure. As we kept the ideas going, they shifted to this: Why have two gunslingers, when you can have four? Why put them in a dungeon, when you can put them in a megadungeon? Bring on the Abomination Vaults and pass the ammo! That’s right, no bows and spells in this campaign—just guns. You want to play a cameo for a day with us? Gotta be a gunslinger. You’re a friendly NPC offering free healing on our way back to town? Nope, don’t mess with our chemistry. You’re one of the core four players and Adam killed your character in volume two? Gotta be a gunslinger—a 1st level one, now. </p> 
                   <p>Sure, we could have played gunslingers in a firearm-themed setting. This is OAD, though, and we like to be unorthodox. We wanted to see what we could learn about the game and go where others fear to tread. Is party balance really necessary, and how is a party of gunslingers going to overcome the vast array of challenges inside a megadungeon? We have no idea, and that’s usually where our Player Captain comes in. Matt’s been playing iterations of this game since the early 90s and has seen a healthy share of high-level treasure hoards in his time. He’ll get the party in shape for the first marathon and the launch of The Abomination Arsenal. We do know one thing right now: we’re going into this megadungeon fully strapped, always packed.</p>

                    <h3>Meet the Black Powder Cadre</h3>
                   </center> 
                   <p>So many gunslingers in one place needs some explanation, so we’ll give you the key points. Vlai Cafellyn, Alkenstar outlaw and founder of the Black Powder Cadre, pulled off an infamous heist at the Alkenstar Gunworks. While everyone might have intended to go their separate way afterward, the authorities’ fierce pursuit ensured that the group stuck together for protection. Over time, a bond developed, and the Black Powder Cadre took shape. Their symbol is the harmona, a fey bird famous for sounding like the biggest gun in the game. The Cadre’s color is blue—like the harmona—and everyone wears a different shade. Vlai’s only rule for membership is that you have to be handy with the steel. Lying low in Otari for a few months has depleted their funds, and it’s time to explore the old ruins nearby in search of some profit…</p> 
                   <p>The core four members of the Black Powder Cadre can be found below. Also listed are the names of each player and the year each became a member of OAD (when a player has reached 100 session hours at our table).</p>

                    <h3>Highlights from Preparing Abomination Vaults:</h3>
                   </center> 
                   <p>□ We still love being around the table together and the setups that go with it. For our launch marathon, we’ve got one of the sickest builds of any project so far: the Gauntlight ruins, completely according to scale and fully 3D. Two photos on this blog only scratch the surface of what our friend Morgan at Black Bard Studios can produce, so there are more to come.</p> 
                   <p>□ Another thing we love about being around the table is our props. One of our members built an old-style ammo crate to hold extra copies of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and maybe some of that tasty Otari coffee! During one of our “you know what would be cool?” discussions, someone suggested a couple of Nerf guns being custom-painted to look like the ones our characters use. Got those now, too.</p> 
                   <p>□ PCs show up with their own look for their character, so Sean’s rocking a goblin mask for Maloika, and Karee’s wearing a set of half-elf ears for Breen. In future blogs we’ll also see a cameo from our spellshot gunslinger in a ghillie suit. Yup, he’ll be wearing the whole getup!</p> 
                   <p>□ Since we’re playing our own characters instead of iconics this time, we wanted some portraits. That’s where our artist and prospective OAD member, Doug Handlon, comes in. Our GM and Doug had classrooms down the hall from each other for years, though you can probably guess which was history and which was art. Even as a cameo, Doug has to play a gunslinger, so he’ll show up as the unexpected sharpshooter.</p> 
                   <p>□ We have a couple more cameos lined up: Theodora and Auralee from our work with <em>The Slithering</em>. Theodora is in the ICU most of the time and can start an IV faster than a 46 initiative roll—extremely useful in a marathon if you’ve heard our stories. Auralee is studying psychology at Rutgers and won’t leave us alone about getting into any Lovecraftian adventure we come across. Both will play gunslingers, of course.</p> 
                   <p>□ Our GM put together a custom soundtrack, including a theme song for each level of the megadungeon, much like he did for The Emerald Spire Project. Characters choose songs too, and we couldn’t leave out certain NPCs and standout locations. </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">This blog post goes over the lost pages of <em>Dark Archive</em> that some of you may have received or seen circulating in the past few weeks, as well as what lies at the end of them. If you’d prefer to work out the lost pages yourself, or give them to your players to solve together, you can now find them on the product page for <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j/">Pathfinder Dark Archive</a></em>.</p> 
                   <p>Otherwise, open the spoiler box below for a bit more information!</p> 
                   <details> <summary>Congratulations, Archivists!</summary> 
                    <p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen many of you receive and share lost pages, pool your knowledge to figure out the clues, and help each other discover the last mystery of the Dark Archive. With a lot of people finding the hidden ninth casefile, <em>In Darkness</em>, we thought it was time to add both the lost pages and the last casefile to the <em>Dark Archive</em> product page as web supplements!</p> 
                    <p>As soon as we locked in on a paranormal book full of rumors and conspiracies, we knew we wanted to hide some secrets in the pages and slightly tangle up the full story of the book for readers to unravel themselves. We hoped by sending out the lost pages, each in a different place or to a different group of people, fans might come together in the spirit of the Dark Archive’s collaboration to find the last chapter revealing the truth of the Archive, its archivist and narrator, Killia Huon-Wynn, and its hidden villain… and I have to say, you all certainly did! It was wonderful to see everyone pitching together to solve pages (and wildly speculate), whether that was on our forums, social media, Reddit, Discord, or anywhere else—I know I wasn’t the only Paizo staffer checking in on these spaces from time to time!</p>

                    <p>The lost pages, as well as the final casefile, have been added to the <em>Dark Archive</em> product page as web supplements, so feel free to talk about it as you would any other adventure (including being considerate about spoilers if you know someone’s going to play through the casefile mini-adventures!). Otherwise, let me just take this last chance to thank everyone who helped put this together and congratulate all of you for being splendid Dark Archivists!</p>

                   <h3>Kim Frandsen (he/him)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">Pathfinder Bounty #12: Somewhere Below</em></h3> 
                   <p>The inspiration came from the prompt provided by Mike Kimmel who was the Organized Play Developer back then. Along with a few too many ghost stories that I’d been reading at the time, and Indiana Jones (for the NPC), Somewhere Below was born.</p> 
                   <p>Favorite Part: it has to be the haunt at the end. Ghosts reaching out from beyond the veil to drag you across will always be a great visual, and it’s not often you get to combine that with a bunch of crawling claws or deal negative damage at 1st level. A particular challenge for the adventure though was to make one of the other encounters variable so the adventure could be run multiple times.</p> 
                   <p>Plugs: I’m currently working on a Starship heist adventure for Starfinder, that I hope to put out on Starfinder Infinite in the not-too-distant future. It’ll work as both a 0-level adventure and a hook or lead-in to both Dead Suns and Drift Crashers. The heroes perform an “Ocean’s 11” style theft of a starship on behalf of a crime boss that they know. They get to keep the ship afterward instead of rolling it up during character creation—and it comes with something special.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re ever interested in what I’m up to, regardless of whether that’s for Pathfinder, Starfinder, or something else, I have a small publishing outfit over at <a href="https://www.beyond-the-horizon-games.com/">https://www.beyond-the-horizon-games.com/</a></p>

                   <p>Hello, hello!<br> My name is Letterio Mammoliti (he/him) and I wrote <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Foundations-Price"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation's Price</em></a> for the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. For my inspiration, I like to dive deep into the lore of a region, time period, or monster to get ideas and connect things together, so when they appear together in the story, the connections feel natural. Besides that, I tend to dust off anything and everything that even tangentially relates to the focus of the adventure, like old books or music that could help me capture its feel. My favorite part of Foundation’s Price is without a doubt the marketplace section. In my home games (as a forever DM) I love giving players a chance to interact with the world and get to know the people in it, so writing this section and coming up with different ideas was a lot of fun.</p> 
                   <p>My twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/Letterio_DM">@Letterio_DM</a>, where I should probably be more active. I have worked on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-509-Counterfeit-History"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-09: Counterfeit History</em></a> and I am working on something yet to be announced (I wish I could say more about it!).</p> 
                   <p>Working on these projects was fantastic, especially considering the incredible work from the other writers, the artists that made the characters come to life, and the amazing editors at Paizo.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you Paizo for these wonderful opportunities!</p>

                   <p>Hello all! My author contribution to the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries was <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02api?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-309-The-Secluded-Siege"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></a>. When I first received the project outline for The Secluded Siege, I was thrilled to learn I had been assigned to “shatter” the Sandswept Hall, a Pathfinder Lodge with a long, less than wholesome, history. Researching a wealth of past adventures, I poured as much of them into The Secluded Siege as word count would allow. Within its pages, veteran Pathfinders must not only overcome hordes of undead, but also face deadly defenses, gnawing rumors, and perilous locations drawn from the Lodge’s storied past, each of which dates all the way back to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy87os">Season 0 of Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, before the first edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game had even seen print!</p> 
                   <p>After turning in my draft of The Secluded Siege, I soon became thrilled once again. I received a new project outline where I had been assigned to “shatter” another notable sanctuary, one with a long, less than wholesome, history. You will have to pour into the pages of last month’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6k?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-505-BoomBlock-Gambit"><em>Starfinder Society #5-05: Boom-Block Gambit</em></a> to find out what threats from the past veteran Starfinder agents must face within the Adamantine Bastille. I had so much fun researching the Adamantine Bastille that the prison setting became the subject of <a href="https://www.starfinderinfinite.com/product/405803/The-Adamantine-Bastille-The-Once-Unbreakable-Prison-of-the-Starfinder-Society?affiliate_id=378893">my very first offering</a> for Starfinder Infinite! </p>

                   <h3>Jacob W. Michaels (he/him)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">PFS #3-14: The Tomb Between Worlds</em></h3> 
                   <p>Greetings Pathfinder Society agents, I’m Jacob W. Michaels (he/him), the author of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0o?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-314-The-Tomb-Between-Worlds"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-14: The Tomb Between Worlds</em></a>. Knowing I was going to be working in an undead-filled pyramid and playing with the Shadow Plane, I wanted to try to make as sandbox-y a dungeon as possible, with lots of opportunities for PCs to jump back and forth between planes, because who doesn’t love a little plane hopping, especially at lower levels? The Shadow Plane has so many great options, and adding a velstrac felt like a perfect, unexpected challenge amid all the undead. The fact that he just wants to be friends (or does he just maybe have an ulterior motive?) made him even more delicious, and I hope I gave players some moral quandaries to figure out (and fun for the GM to roleplay). I was also thrilled to include the cu sith–which I created in my first second edition assignment (for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022kx?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-153-Life-s-Long-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #153: Life’s Long Shadows</em></a>), but which I don’t think had been part of any Paizo encounter until now. (Lastly, I recognize the final fight’s been polarizing. I’m sorry for those whose characters died, since I know how frustrating that is, and appreciate those who really enjoyed being pushed to the limits before triumphing in the end.)</p>

                   <p>Hi all! I’m Kate Baker (she/her), and I was delighted to write both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ne?Starfinder-Society-Intro-2-For-the-Factions"><em>Starfinder Society Intro #2: For the Factions</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3m?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Cavern-of-the-Sundered-Song"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-15: Cavern of the Sundered Song</em></a>. These represent the extreme ends of the level range for Society products, with For the Factions serving as an introductory scenario for first and second level PCs and Cavern of the Sundered Song releasing as the first 9-12 scenario for Pathfinder Society! Both were lots of fun to write, in very different ways. With Intro 2, I wanted to make sure that even a brand-new group of players would be successful, while I knew only very experienced players would take on Cavern of the Sundered Song and they would expect a challenge! My favorite part of For the Factions is the interview and getting to hear the neat backstories and talents of all the PCs. My favorite part of Cavern of the Sundered Song is the NPC who shows off his crystal collection (strike a pose!).</p>

                   <h3>Brent Bowser<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">PFS 3-16: Escape from Oppara</em></h3> 
                   <p>I love Taldor, so when I got the chance to write <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-316-Escape-from-Oppara"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-16: Escape From Oppara</em></a>, I immediately dove back into the deep history of the country. Reading that the First through Eighth Armies were recognized for their conquests, I had a pretty solid idea of who The Ninth Army was. Writing them was cathartic. Narratively, I enjoyed writing the spy games between Lady Gloriana and The Peddler and exploring Taldor in the aftermath of War for the Crown. Mechanically, it’s very important to me that I wrote a scenario where everyone who gets dispatched into the completely random, unorthodox, and oftentimes illogical party composition for a Pathfinder Society mission had a chance to contribute to the skill tests. I also wanted to push some boundaries of monster design, so I hope everyone enjoyed the final encounter.</p>

                   <h3>Matt Morris<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">PFS #3-18: Dacilane Academy’s Delightful Disaster</em></h3> 
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris (he/him), and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href="http://everybodygames.net/">Everybody Games</a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/6101/Rogue-Genius-Games">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Getting to write my first scenario for Pathfinder Society was a real treat—particularly since I was able to draw on years of teaching experience as inspiration for the events of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-318-Dacilane-Academys-Delightful-Disaster"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-18: Dacilane Academy’s Delightful Disaster</em></a>. While none of my field trips have gone quite this awry, it was fun to imagine how students would react to a truly strange enrichment trip. Luckily, I knew Pathfinders would be the perfect chaperones for the Academy’s pupils, whose quirks and personality traits were influenced by some of my most memorable students.</p> 
                   <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to <a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a> if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

                   <p>Hi! My name is Amber Stewart (she/her) and I wrote <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-319-Mean-Streets-of-Shadow-Absalom"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-19: Mean Streets of Shadow Absalom</em></a>. This was a real treat for me since it marks my first opportunity to expand upon Shadow Absalom since I created it way back in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy87uz?Pathfinder-Chronicles-The-Great-Beyond-A-Guide-to-the-Multiverse"><em>Pathfinder Chronicles: The Great Beyond—A Guide to the Multiverse</em></a>. In my scenario, I got to touch upon and use people and places from my original work way back when and also use new content by other awesome folks that have since expanded and developed Absalom’s dark mirror in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Realms, Planar Adventures</em></a>, and elsewhere. My favorite things in the adventure I think have to be various in-game city scenes and vignettes to set the stage for the planar city’s tone and atmosphere. I also so very much enjoyed the NPCs I created for the PCs to encounter and banter with for information, chief among them the d’ziriak lightweaver K’kaviim, the fetchling lich Viriseth and his mortal fetchling apprentice Rensivir, and most of all the night hag Gremala the Dream-Monger. For the moment I don’t have any further announced projects, but I’m working on a few things of my own and getting to run my first home campaign in a few years (set on Golarion but with a ton of planar content, as is absolutely on-brand for me).</p>

                   <p>Adventures are where I shine. Part of my background is in poetry and fiction-writing, and adventures are the closest to those forms out of all tabletop game design. I truly love to dig into the emotional world of villains, consider the full context of the players, PCs, and NPCs, and find ways to delight those at the table. You almost assuredly haven’t seen the last of me—though I will admit, since adventure design is such a solitary act, I’m not sure how many people are actually playing the adventures I’ve written. If you’ve played one of mine, could you mention it in the comments below?</p>

                    <h3>Pathfinder Heroic Endeavors: Series Premiere!</h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>We’ve already produced four episodes and you can find them archived on the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOHNx3GvTFbEPrFiaQTXOwd0yohZyueD2">Heroic Endeavors Playlist on YouTube</a>. We are working on uploading all the episodes to podcast too! </p> 
                   <p>Heroic Endeavors also uses some technical production features you might enjoy! The liveplay features four Blackmagic Studio cameras, one PTZ Overhead “Dice Cam,” and complete lighting control. Viewers can experience interactive elements like Cinematic Mode, which removes all on-screen graphics and immerses the viewer in a more dramatic point of view by changing the lighting, color correction, and aspect ratio.</p> 
                   <p>You can Toss a Coin and give 1 gp to a player of your choice or grant 1 Hero Point to the group pool. The cast members read comments live and have select "Comment Breaks" to help make sure the game and the break from immersion happen at only key intervals to avoid any undue interruptions to the storytelling.</p> 
                   <p>Even better, all interactive elements can be activated by chat for free using channel points. Some have the ability to be purchased via donations that support TheDaTNetwork, an independent fan-supported endeavor. (We are producing the show financially, but ‘tis fun to show your gratitude to the players, yes?) All donate options offer the ability to use channel points as a free alternative. The cast members are always happy to receive financial support from fans but believe strongly that donations should not prohibit anyone from engaging with the liveplay’s content.</p> 
                   <p>Heroic Endeavors plans to add even more interactive elements as the story unfolds. The cast members seek to balance gameplay and interaction to create an experience unlike any other that Paizo has offered to date on Twitch!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><b>About The DaTNetwork</b> Starting with their flagship show, <em>Dragons and Things</em>, the DaTNetwork has been a premium source of live-streamed TTRPG content with a focus on building a community of people who like to tell stories and play games.

                   <p>There are so many people to thank for my amazing career that it would be impossible to list them all, but there are certain pivotal people who made a huge impact, and I would like to shine the spotlight on them for a little bit. First, to Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein•Hagen, who not only allowed a young Lisa to edit <em>Ars Magica</em>, but also let me get involved with the design of their first game. They allowed me to wear a lot of hats at Lion Rampant, which formed the seed that blossomed into my career. To Stewart Wieck and Mark Rein•Hagen, who listened to my crazy plan to merge Lion Rampant with <em>White Wolf</em> magazine and actually agreed to do it! This led to my involvement from the ground up on <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>. To Peter Adkison, for giving me the hard sell and convincing me to pick up my life in Atlanta and move to Seattle to become employee number one at a fledgling Wizards of the Coast. Being involved with the creation of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, the acquisition of TSR, and making some Star Wars games were a few of the highlights from my career there. Thanks to Johnny Wilson for being the only person to “take the bait” when I left Wizards and formed Paizo with him and Vic. And to Erik Mona and Jeff Alvarez, for being with me for the last 20 years and helping me grow Paizo into the company it is today. From the magazines to Pathfinder and Starfinder, it has been an incredible journey! And finally, to Vic Wertz, for being my partner both in business and in life. Your guidance, support, tough love, and off-the-charts intelligence have been a constant at my side since 1993. I am so happy we were able to share our careers together!</p>

                   <p>Vic and I still own Paizo, so I won’t be entirely gone. However, I have turned over all the operations to Paizo’s amazing Leadership Team, helmed by Jim Butler with Erik Mona, Mike Webb, Rai Kong, and Maggie Gallagher. If there is anything you would have previously talked to me about regarding Paizo’s operations, please address it to my team there instead. If you want to talk to me as the owner of Paizo, I can still be reached at <b>lisa@paizo.com</b>.</p>

                   <p>Following the desolation of Lastwall at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant, untold horrors wander the woods and roads of the region now known as the Gravelands. Many small refugee settlements are scattered throughout the area, their citizens either helplessly trapped behind enemy lines, or stubbornly hoping they won’t be noticed by Tar-Baphon’s undead armies.<br> One such settlement became a new home for a Pathfinder agent—a dedicated member of the Radiant Oath faction—who had been traveling in Lastwall when the nation fell. The agent decided to help those in need rather than flee the Gravelands, and they’ve managed to keep the settlement protected... so far.</p> 
                   <p>Now with the settlement burgeoning with refugees and the Whispering Tyrant’s forces drawing near, the agent has made a desperate attempt to reach a Pathfinder lodge in Ustalav. They barely made it out alive—and now they’re asking for agents to return to the Gravelands and aid their stranded friends!</p>

                   <p>King Estrid of the Ironbound Islands has put out a call for Pathfinders to explore the Island of the Ancestors, but first the Society must earn her approval. Gorm Greathammer, a prince, warrior, and leader of the Grand Archive faction, has traveled to Halgrim to meet with King Estrid—and her crag linnorm companion, Boiltongue—and forge a new alliance for the Society. Talks have been going well, but the arrival of Boiltongue’s children in the city has thrown everything into chaos! Gorm senses the negotiations are about to collapse and sends for a team of Pathfinders to help keep an eye on Boiltongue’s children while he wraps up talks with King Estrid. Babysitting five rambunctious linnorm siblings is about as easy as it sounds (which is to say, not at all), and the Pathfinders are about to have their hands full!</p>

                   <p>Unstable planar matter ejected from the Drift has collided with Akiton’s wastes, causing regional destruction and rapid biological mutations. Yet from this collision sprouts opportunity, as the planar collision terraforms Great Gwaz into a lush, jungle paradise. At the request of famed Akitonian Starfinder Avor Stelek, a team of Starfinders is dispatched to investigate the so called “planar bloom.” Can the Starfinders stop the planar bloom’s spread? More importantly: should they?</p> 
                   <p>This scenario is one of four stand-alone Starfinder Society Scenarios directly tied to the Drift Crisis a galaxy-wide catastrophe detailed in <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em>. While basic knowledge of the Drift Crisis enriches the experience of this adventure, it isn’t required.

                   <p>Greetings, dear reader of Golarion’s Finest guides and articles! I’ve just returned from another adventure and as always, after visiting new locales throughout Golarion I return to share my experiences with my favorite readers: you! (My, aren’t you looking particularly fine today?) Before I get into the details, I wish to remind you, dear reader, that this trip was sponsored by Golarion’s Finest. They paid for my fare, room and board, and other amenities on this trip, and I’m eternally grateful to the fine folks at this fine publication. Make sure to check out their latest release, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dv8?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Travel-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Travel Guide</em></a>, available wherever you might find other fine guides!</p> 
                   <p>My latest travels brought me back home to the Inner Sea. While my time in Segada was fun, I was excited to be coming back to something familiar. Little did I know that my assignment wouldn’t see me back in Avistan like I imagined, but would in fact take me to Garund! Specifically, I was sent to visit the desert lands of Thuvia, home of the famous sun orchid elixir.</p> 
                   <p>My trip started when I left the boat in Merab. I had traveled along the South Tack before, but this was my first stop at this vivacious city. The sights and sounds were invigorating! The calls of merchants selling their potions and elixirs within the Flowing Market greeted me as I walked past to the Temple of the Redeeming Sun to watch the Sarenites perform their dances for the Sunwrought Festival. Lucky me, to have arrived during the solstice!</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8a46eb0e-de04-474a-83b1-084ec982e42a/ThuvianMeatPastries_2000.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8a46eb0e-de04-474a-83b1-084ec982e42a/ThuvianMeatPastries_2000.png" hspace="5" width="500px" alt="Illustration by Gislaine Avila: A basket holding multiple triangular pastries.

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Whether you try Tareq’s or visit a street vendor, these pastries are worth a stop!<br> Art by Gislaine Avila</p>
                   </div> 
                   <p>While the festivities were thrilling, I found that I was famished from my journey, so I decided to slip into a nearby restaurant. A kind halfling by the name of Tareq sat me down at a table and after a bit of conversation, I decided on the spiced meat pastries. While I had walked past many food vendors selling the same pastries earlier, he insisted that he made them better than any street cart. How could I pass up the best meat pastries in Merab? Reader, let me tell you, I don’t think Tareq was lying. These were absolutely delicious. I highly recommend giving them a try while in Thuvia!</p> 
                   <p>I resumed my explorations of the city, wandering until one particular building sporting a number of strange glass additions caught my attention. Confounded, I asked around and was told to make my way to a higher point in the city so I could look down on the building from above. My new vantage point revealed the building’s true artistry—the glass additions resemble the petals of a sun orchid! After further inquiries, I learned that this particular design is in the Sunswept style, an architectural style that originated in Osirion but had spread throughout the other nations of the Golden Road.</p>

                   <p>As I took some notes, I heard the familiar sound of a cheering crowd nearby. I followed the jubilant cries expecting to find more festival celebrants, but my investigation soon discovered that the cheering was coming from a local stadium. Rather than buy a ticket inside, I followed some local youths up to the top of a nearby armory (more climbing!) to look down into the Merab Stadium. A game of basilisk was underway!</p> 
                   <p>Basilisk, for my less sports-inclined readers, is a sport where two teams attempt to score with a ball across a small field. The catch is that there’s a second ball in play—the titular basilisk—that forces any player it hits to freeze in place. Luckily, just like when dealing with a real basilisk, you can avert your gaze. In fact, that’s required in this game! Anyone holding the scoring ball lowers a visor on their helm to “protect” them from the basilisk. This prevents the basilisk’s “freeze” but has the unfortunate side effect of making it really hard to see! The player holding the ball needs help reaching the goal, so all the players have to work together to guide the scoring ball while also avoiding becoming frozen. It’s an exhilarating watch!</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>The game at hand was an important one (hence the particularly raucous cheering). The Merab Vultures were playing against the Riddleport Rollers, but this was no ordinary match—a newly developing rivalry between the two teams heightened the stakes! The Vultures’ former guide, a gnome by the name of Yima “No Eyes” Vitton, had recently been transferred to Riddleport. Now the remaining Vultures, and Merab as a whole, had it out for the “traitorous” Rollers. It was all in good spirits, but it was a fun game to watch! Local authorities unfortunately shooed us from the armory before I could catch the end of the game, so I found my way to a local tea parlor. There, I traded stories with the locals and learned a fair amount of local legends. One of my favorite stories was the tale of the camelop and the drake.</p> 
                   <p>With the day winding down, I retreated to my room to rest in preparation for another full day. And indeed, the rest of my trip was just as exciting and eventful! The people, culture, and of course food of Merab are all fantastic and I highly recommend every dear reader makes the journey if they can. I’d love to tell you more, but Golarion’s Finest only paid for one thousand words and I’d like to see if I can convince them to pay for the rest of the story. For now, I’ll say as I always do, see the sights you can and read about those you can’t. Safe travels, readers!</p> 
                   <p>Now making his way home to Highhelm,</p>

                   <h3>Get to know the newest Infinite Masters: </h3> 
                   <p><b>Sasha Laranoa Harving</b><br> Sasha Laranoa Harving (nov/nov), known to novs friends as Solatra, has been writing for tabletop roleplaying games since nov first rolled a d20, and has been doing novs best to take the RPG industry by storm.</p> 
                   <p><b>Ceri Rowland</b><br> Ceri Rowland has been writing Pathfinder homebrew content since he first discovered 1e. His first campaign was written almost entirely from scratch, which seemed like a good idea at the time. Sometime later, he discovered 2e and fell in love with it, and later decided to take the plunge and start writing content for publication. His specialties are creature stat blocks and adventure modules, but he dabbles in a little bit of everything. </p> 
                   <p><b>James Beck</b><br> Jewish LGBT writer and co-owner of Eldritch Osiris Games, James has worked with Deadly D8, written for Sinclair's Library, and has worked on several big projects. </p> 
                   <p><b>Simon Hunter</b><br> A lifetime interest in TTRPG has become a reality for Simon as he creates and publishes adventures through Paizo and WotC IP. He couples this interest with a manic obsession for 3D printing and miniature painting, a love of coffee (both roasting and drinking), and a passion for astronomy. He really enjoys taking created worlds and adding in small additions that provide fun for players and game masters alike. </p> 
                   <p><b>Jacky Leung</b><br> Jacky is an ENNIE Award-winning Chinese American TTRPG writer, editor, and designer. He is also the Creative Manager for Unbreakable Publishers, seeking to uplift Asian creators to tell their stories in their own voices. He has worked for Evil Hat Productions, MCDM, Baldman Games, and others. He is a big-time foodie, sampling cuisine whenever time permits or being lost in a food blogger's TikTok. </p> 
                   <p><b>Adrian Kennelly</b><br> Adrian is a designer of supplements for a variety of systems at Azukail Games (http://azukailgames.com) and Community Content Programmes and collaborator with other publishers. </p> 
                   <p><b>Jamie Trollope</b><br> Jamie has been running and playing in TTRPGs for 30 years. They've been an integral part of his life—a creative outlet, a way of learning about good, bad, storytelling, character development, teamwork and how to relate to each other. Jamie creates utilities for Pathfinder 2e that he hopes will save people time, like the <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/402698&amp;affiliate_id=2871372">NPC Index</a> or <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/396152?affiliate_id=2871372">Smoke &amp; Sail: Naval Warfare</a>. He values creativity, collaboration, inclusivity and this amazing game of make-believe we all love so much. Keep rolling 20's everyone! </p> 
                   <p><b>Gremlin Brothers</b><br> The Gremlin Brothers—Darkwayne, Batfoot and Froghorn—aim to create top-notch adventure content to deepen the experience of playing online or in person.

                   <p>Speaking of which, I had an absolute blast at my first-ever Gen Con! It was fantastic getting to see so many community members coming out and enjoying our return to the Sagamore ballroom. Watching more than 50 tables run through <em>Enter the Pallid Peak</em> during the special was a real treat, and I returned from the weekend emotionally recharged (and physically exhausted). I’m already putting some plans into motion to improve the program and make it the best version of itself thanks to some conversations I had that weekend.</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p><b>Newly Sanctioned</b>: Last month we sanctioned <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive"><em>Dark Archive</em></a> for Pathfinder Society and <a href=""><em>Redshift Rally</em></a> for Starfinder Society! For <em>Dark Archive</em>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> are available for use, and the 8 Case File adventures have <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Dark+Archive+Case+Files+Sanctioning.pdf">sanctioning documents</a> on the product page. They all grant 2 XP and commensurate rewards. <em>Redshift Rally</em> is sanctioned for play, and its <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> are available for use as well.</p> 
                   <p><b>Upcoming</b>: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c20"><em>Lost Omens: Travel Guide</em></a> sanctioning is finished and ready for a street date next week, so look for those Character Options next Wednesday! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ase/discuss?Pathfinder-Adventure-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King"><em>Crown of the Kobold King</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0y/discuss?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Dead-Suns"><em>Dead Suns</em></a> hardcover have both had their release dates shifted to October, but we should be on track to have them both ready on release. The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers">Drift Crashers Adventure Path</a> should also be sanctioned around the release of the third volume in October.</p> 
                   <p>We do intend to sanction the Kingmaker Adventure Path and associated content for Pathfinder Society! However, it’s a lot of content that we have not yet started reviewing, so we can’t guarantee that sanctioning will be ready for its release at the end of October. We’ll be sure to keep you posted as we make progress.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Guide Updates</h2> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</h3> 
                   <p>That’s right, there’s a PACS update! Been a while since we had one of those. We’ve long said that we intended to release one final version of the PACS Guide to cover any lingering issues and close out the program. Well, that day is today! The Guide has been updated to its final form at this time.</p> 
                   <p>Major updates include the addition of Adventurer’s Packs, the sanctioning of content published on Infinite for play, and various other changes. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy98no?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-Guide">The Guide is available for download now</a>!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> 
                   <p>While at Gen Con, I was able to award a number of additional Campaign Coins. We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons. </p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Chris Johnson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#858</b><br> <b>Doug Edwards</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#859</b><br> <b>Kristin Bollerman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#860</b><br> <b>Jim Crase</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#861</b><br> <b>Rebecca Fehn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#862</b><br> and <b>Tim Munsie (TMun)</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#863</b></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Order of the Wayfinder</h2> 
                   <p>In addition to the Campaign Service Coin, we also have one other award: the Order of the Wayfinder. This award is given out only once per year, and recognizes a member of the community who has provided exceptional service. Typically, we give this award to individuals who have taken on a particular project and knocked it out of the park. Previously, this award has been awarded to the head of our Additional Resources review team and our Regional Venture-Coordinator for the Online region, among others.</p> 
                   <p>I am pleased to finally announce that the 2021 recipient of the Order of the Wayfinder is <b>Barb Wilkins</b>. Since 2018, Barb has been the one-woman show behind sending out volunteer agreements to our Venture Officers. Every year, this involves sending out literally hundreds of agreements to volunteers, ensuring that they’ve been signed and returned, and maintaining the master list of every Venture Officer worldwide. It’s a monumental task, and one that she has done for nearly four years now. Her work is undeniably vital to Organized Play, and I am delighted to have presented this award to her at Gen Con this year.</p> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the fifth milestone, a GM must run 150 games, which must include at least 50 unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for Venture-Captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had four GMs earn their 5th Star for PFS1 and two GMs earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Zackery Kuehn, Ben Tash, Christopher Waterfield, and Denis Wishnevsky<br> <b>5th Glyph</b>: Milan Badzic and Robert Bollerman</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>I'm pleased to announce that I'll be attending two regional shows this October! First up, I'll be at <b>CinCityCon</b> in Cincinnati, Ohio from October 7–9 (that’s over Indigenous Peoples’ Day so it’s a long weekend). Tickets are on sale now at <a href="https://cincitycon.com/">https://cincitycon.com/</a>; the tables I'm running will be charity tickets.</p> 
                   <p>I'll also be attending <b>Scarefest</b> in Asheville, North Carolina from October 21–23, which is just a perfect convention for a big scaredy-cat like me! Tickets are available on their website at <a href="https://avlscarefest.com/">https://avlscarefest.com/</a> and game signups are on their Warhorn at <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/asheville-scarefest">https://warhorn.net/events/asheville-scarefest</a>.</p> 
                   <p>I'm looking forward to getting out to see you all this fall! I've got some fun tables planned and I can't wait.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re not in the neighborhood of these shows, or you’re looking for more fun closer to home or online, check out our <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">conventions calendar</a>! We’ve got tons of shows coming up in the home stretch of 2023 for you to check out and support.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the new Year of Boundless Wonder!</p>

                   <p><b>Dylan Wokeck</b><br> Dylan loves helping others as a children's librarian, but when he’s not at work, he tries to spend as much time as possible with his wife, whether that’s going for walks or playing games together. She loves to take Dylan on real-life adventures to different states and countries. Outside of that, Dylan has been playing Pathfinder since about 2015, and he still can't decide if monk or bard is his favorite class. Dylan thanks his wife for helping with the layout template for Google Docs and Dustin Knight for doing his review show to keep Dylan motivated enough to write more Pathfinder content.</p>

After being introduced to D&amp;D 3e by some new friends, he took up the mantle of GM and never looked back. Almost 20 years later, he works with Hal Greenberg, Doug Herring, and Ken Shannon of Samurai Sheepdog (<a href="http://www.samuraisheepdog.com">www.samuraisheepdog.com</a>) as Lead RPG Designer with over 80 published credits to his name and over 120 overall in which he's had some significant part.

Tom is a theatrical director and acting teacher and works with the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Utah Shakespeare Festival. He is a proud member of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society. He is "staff" to a precocious and adorable smooth fox terrier named Abigail Pippington.</p>

                   <p><b>W. Brian Lane</b><br> W. Brian Lane is a physics educator by day and a Pathfinder GM and content creator by night.

                   <p><b>Arkon</b><br> Arkon is a college student with just enough time to run and create for Pathfinder. When he finds some extra between the couch cushions, Arkon explores different interests, editions, and media to pull from for inspiration. Most of what he makes are player options, such as classes, archetypes, spells, subclasses, etc. But as a Forever GM, Arkon also finds himself making things he finds missing.

                   <p itemprop="description">Roll for Combat is a partner who is publishing their own line of Pathfinder Second Edition rulebooks and adventures under the Battlezoo brand. Check out this update of the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si3x?New-Battlezoo-Kickstarter-Campaign#27">New Battlezoo Kickstarter Campaign</a> from Roll for Combat’s Director of Game Design, Mark Seifter!</p>

                   <p><b><em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Year of Monsters</em></b> lets you play the monster, with a creative monster ancestry each month of 2023, plus a final compilation book as a capstone with additional content! The ancestries are demons, gremlins, intelligent weapons, dungeons expanded (you can get the original dungeon ancestry for free at <a href="http://battlezoo.com/">http://battlezoo.com/</a>), oni, nymphs, doppelgangers, minotaurs, slimes, sthenos, mimics, and sidhe. Each ancestry will receive roughly twice as much content as a standard size ancestry, such as those presented in the <em>Core Rulebook or Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. Thanks to stretch goals, we’ve already expanded demons to double that size, doppelgangers to add a doppelborn versatile heritage, and more! Plus, pledging now will guarantee the Foundry VTT module is included with your order for free!</p> 
                   <p>The Kickstarter also introduces <b><em>Battlezoo Eldamon</em></b>, which allows you to befriend, train, battle, and evolve ancient and playful monsters based on 10+ elemental types, such as fire, ice, and death in your Pathfinder game! Included are the eldamon trainer class that focuses on befriending eldamon and the elemental avatar class that attunes with the eldamon within them. There’s also an <b>Eldamon Battles Card Game</b>, allowing you to battle in fast-paced strategic duels. </p> 
                   <p>Last but not least, <b><em>Battlezoo Bestiary: Strange &amp; Unusual</em></b> features 150 award-winning monsters from the 2021 RPG Superstar contest, which is licensed from Paizo. In addition to the monsters, inside you’ll find an expansion of the monster parts system from Battlezoo Bestiary with new imbued properties for elements and more, plus the aberrant soul archetype, which allows you to slowly transform into an aberration.</p>

                   <p>Hi all! I’m Alison Cybe (they/them), and I’m pleased to say that Paizo has asked me to create a few adventures for them. By now, you’ll have had a chance to play my most recent Paizo project, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c6t?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-503-Combatants-Concerto-Fugue-of-the-Traitor"><em>Starfinder Scenario 5-03: Combatant’s Concerto: Fugue of the Traitor</em></a>, which is a murder mystery adventure in which you’re trying to root out an enemy agent while also exploring themes of the crimes of imperialism and radical social change conflicting with terrorism. But today I’ve been asked to discuss an earlier work: <a herf="https://paizo.com/products/btq027p5?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-402-Settling-Accounts"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-02: Settling Accounts</em></a>.</p> 
                   <p>On one level, I’m super glad, because I had the chance to introduce a new species into the Starfinder setting for this adventure. I wanted to write rabbitfolk because they’re awesome, but I also wanted to make them feel genuinely different, new, and unique to the setting. So I gave them their own unique culture, nature, and physiology. But that isn’t all I wanted to do with the adventure. I’m not ashamed to say that my adventures are political in nature. All art is political, and the games we play are as much an artform as they are hobby. <em>Settling Accounts</em> is an exploration into cultural contamination. It follows a Pact World celebrity whose first contact with an indigenous species, while not aggressive or of ill-intent, inadvertently causes significant and irreparable harm to the native culture. This type of story isn’t restricted to fiction; it does and has happened countless times across the world. We need look no further than studies into so-called cargo cults or the “invasion via media” in countries such as Bhutan to see it occur. Every year, we hear of more actions taken by nations to subsume and eradicate indigenous cultures such as unmarked graves in Canada’s Indian residential schools or the abuse of Australia’s Stolen Generation. We’re used to thinking of these abuses as things of the past, but they happen today. They happen now. And they do not require the point of a gun.

                   <h3>Dennis Muldoon (he/him)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">SFS #4-10: The Way In</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I'm Dennis Muldoon (he/him), and in Season 4 of Starfinder Society I was delighted to write both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aks?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-410-The-Way-In"><em>SFS #4-10: The Way In</em></a> and the new interactive special, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c83?Starfinder-Society-Special-499-A-Time-of-Crisis"><em>SFS #4-99: A Time of Crisis</em></a>. These presented very different challenges to write, and I enjoyed both quite a bit. For <em>The Way In</em>, I was inspired to create an adventure that felt like an action movie, complete with a villain monologue. My favorite part is the dramatic scene in the conclusion. For <em>A Time of Crisis</em>, I really enjoyed the process of thinking through the challenges PCs would face given the premise of the adventure, and then making sure they were represented in the adventure. My favorite part was coming up with opportunities for PCs to dictate how they solve problems and improve their situation.</p>

                   <h3>Matt Duval<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">SFS #4-11: A World’s Ambition;<br> PFS #3-17: Dreams of a Dustbound Isle</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Matt Duval and author for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d5f?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-317-Dreams-of-a-Dustbound-Isle"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-17: Dreams of a Dustbound Isle</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-411-A-Worlds-Ambition"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-11: A World's Ambition</em></a>. I also got to write the return to Salvation’s End for this October, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-510-Shadow-of-the-Vault-Lord"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-10: Shadow of the Vault Lord</em></a> as well as some other adventures from prior years. Grateful to get asked back!</p> 
                   <p>I went down a lengthy wiki-hole learning about gray goo scenarios for <em>A World’s Ambition</em> and imagining the culture and environment that might arise, but I also did a deep dive on robot dragons. I’d put dragons in everything if they’d let me, and Jenny Jarzabski’s initial email already mentioned them. Yes!! I also included some fun, subtle references that might clue in the observant about the true nature of the adventure’s omnipresent antagonist.</p> 
                   <p><em>The Dustbound Isle</em> is packed with my other favorite things: surreal extraplanar events, mysteries and puzzles for the players to solve, and so many tie-ins to prior adventures. I pulled ideas for nightmares from <em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em>, my most-used PFS1 sourcebook.</p> 
                   <p>And as for <em>Shadow of the Vault Lord</em>… patience. Your doom comes soon enough, feeble heroes!</p>

                   <p>Heylo! I’m Ivis K. Flanagan, and I wrote <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</em></a>. This scenario takes the holidays celebrated through the month of Kuthona that Jenny first shared with us and lets the players actually experience them. To me, holidays are about families—the ones you’re given, the ones you’re making, and, most importantly, the ones you choose to love. My goal with this “Starfinder Holiday Special” was to help others feel that love and hopefully bring a smile as well. The reunion at the end has to be my favorite part because it opens a surprise and brings together family who chose to be.</p> 
                   <p>Looking forward, I’m a contributing author to a few announced and unannounced upcoming Paizo projects, including some cool stuff coming in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w"><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em></a> this October. Outside of writing projects, I can be found running Organized Play games, brewing plans for another year of Extra Life fundraising shenanigans, and chilling with my cat. You can find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NorseButterfly">@NorseButterfly</a> where I am working to post my current antics!</p>

                   <p>I'm Scott D. Young (he/him), and I wrote <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024zh?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Live-Adventure-Extreme"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #3-10: Live Adventure Extreme!</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02asa?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-415-Feuding-Faiths"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-15: Feuding Faiths</em></a>. Previously, I've written other scenarios for both Starfinder and Pathfinder 1E/2E Organized Play campaigns, and I'm currently the GM for the <em>Young and Adventurous</em> podcast on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">Know Direction network</a>.</p> 
                   <p>For <em>Live Adventure Extreme!</em>, I had the great fortune to work with Thurston Hillman as my developer. Getting to add a chapter to the Society’s relationship with Zo! was a treat, and I really enjoyed the chance to take some of the established NPCs and add to their stories. As part of my research for the project I contacted Starfinder Developer Jenny Jarzabski, who had created the wonderful announcer duo of Lethea and Quill, to make sure I got the tone of her creations down accurately—I hope it worked!</p> 
                   <p>In <em>Feuding Faiths</em>, developer Jessica Catalan and I got to explore how religion works without a monopoly on divine magic as such—very different than in pre-Gap Golarion! We also tried to broaden the view of worshippers of each of the key religions, so that the “bad guys” don’t always wear their guilt on their sleeve. (Or DO they? Hmm...) I hope people enjoy them!</p> 
                   <p>You can find me hopefully running a table at a con sometime soon and as “Scott D. Young, Author” on the holosphere. (The “D.” is important—ordinary Scott Young's are everywhere, and there are even a couple of “Scott Young, Author” usernames out there!)</p>

                   <p>Hello world! I'm Michael Bramnik (he/him), and while more of you might know me as a GM or Venture Captain over the last decade, I’ve been fortunate to have recently seen <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02asb?Starfinder-Bounty-2-Test-Flight"><em>Starfinder Bounty #2: Test Flight</em></a> released! Crafting <em>Test Flight</em> was an extremely fun process—it allowed me to tap into my background in science and engineering from when I was working towards a PhD in geophysics and as a researcher for the U.S. Army, while also giving several nods to classic spaceborne science fiction encounters at the same time. I’m most happy that the adventure allows players to have so much agency in deciding how to tackle each challenge, allowing it to be re-playable without feeling repetitive.</p> 
                   <p>I'm also very excited for the upcoming release of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw7"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-05: The Arclord Who Never Was</em></a>. I don’t want to get ahead of myself and give away any spoilers, but I will say this: make sure you don’t lose your head when you play it!</p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">SF One-Shot #3: System Takedown</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, a freelancer for both Pathfinder and Starfinder. This past year, I wrote <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c33?Starfinder-OneShot-3-System-Takedown"><em>Starfinder One-Shot #3: System Takedown</em></a>, where a disparate group of rebels must infiltrate a Veskarium military communications facility to broadcast proof of the misdeeds of a corrupt Veskarium consul on Pulonis, the pahtra home world. <em>System Takedown</em> has a unique twist: the rebels are livestreaming the infiltration (with their location scrambled, of course) on the channel of one of the PC pregens! So if you’re running the game on a stream yourself, your players can respond to its chat as if it were the in-game one. I provided scripted chat responses for games without an actual live chat, and I had fun coming up with things viewers of a Starfinder vid channel might say. I also enjoyed the chance to have the PCs strike back at the Veskarium’s colonization, and while the adventure doesn’t free Pulonis, it does—hopefully!—make a part of it a nicer place to live.</p> 
                   <p>Other than <em>System Takedown</em>, my most recent work has appeared in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive"><em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></a>. I also got to keep up the tyranny-fighting theme with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4x"><em>To Defy the Dragon</em></a>, a standalone Starfinder adventure coming out in October, in which the PCs get to find ancient mechs and fight a dragon in them! If you like, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a> for more project updates and the occasional cat picture.</p>

The oldest and most prestigious magic academy in the world is the Magaambya, an ancient institution founded by the greatest wizard the world has ever known.

Over their long academic career, the heroes rise from humble students to become teachers, ultimately holding the fate of the Magaambya magic academy in their hands. Graduates of the Magaambya are among the greatest wardens of the world, but if the heroes can’t marshal the strength of thousands who have come before them, the venerable Magaambya might fall!</p>

                   <h3>4000 Years in the Making</h3> 
                   <p>The city of Absalom is one of the oldest and most diverse cities in Golarion. Known as "The City at the Center of the World," it’s renowned for its enormous size and influence throughout the world.</p> 
                   <p><em>Absalom boasts some of the finest—and oldest—buildings and monuments on the Inner Sea. Over the nearly 5 millennia since Aroden founded the city, Absalom has been built, rebuilt, and rebuilt again, resulting in a tapestry of architectural styles as diverse as the countless citizens and visitors who throng its streets and markets. Immigrants from every corner of Golarion can be found within the city’s walls, alongside their architecture, artwork, and customs.</em></p> 
                   <h3>Bringing With It Iconic City Life </h3> 
                   <p>Absalom is also known as the "Patchwork City" due to its many architectural styles mashed together over the years. It was a challenge for our art director, Tomasz Badalski, to find a compromise between all the clashing art styles.</p> 
                   <p><em>I have spent a while looking for the most appropriate art style for Absalom and came up with way too many widely differing ideas. I have decided to find something mostly "townish" but add a little detail that will clearly tell it apart from other cities, which is why you will find Aroden’s emblem on every door and pin. For the architectural style, I went with Tudor as a base. I think it all came together really well.</em></p>

                   <h3>What’s in the Box</h3> 
                   <p>The city of Absalom comes with plenty of walls, floors, and, of course, fully functioning doors. It’s more than enough to build two large rooms, for example. To make it easier to personalize your structures, over 40 props are included in the set. You will find metal chests, books, scrolls, barrels, candles, and lamps. If you need to take cover, columns are also included in the set. </p>

His favorite character of all time is a dwarven, the one who brought him into RPGs, but he didn't get REALLY into it until his wife pushed him into taking part in RPG Superstar for Paizo in their final season. Finishing in Top 32 gave Kim the impetus to keep going. Since then, more than 100 different books and game materials have had Kim’s name in them, ranging from books to maps and to board games.</p>

                   <p>But in-person conventions are not without challenges right now, and there have been several reports of COVID-19 infections among attendees. GenCon staff have asked anyone who attended the show and tested positive to send an email to <a href="mailto:customerservice@gencon.com">customerservice@gencon.com</a> for contact tracing. We’d also like to take this opportunity to remind you of our <a href="https://discord.com/channels/697962502650069073/996416858444017737">#contact-tracing</a> channel in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/697962502650069073/975806523869626408">Paizo Events Discord server</a> for more up-to-date contact tracing information. It’s been a few days since GenCon has ended, but we encourage everyone to test and take care of themselves. Washington state residents can get free kits by mail <a href="https://sayyescovidhometest.org/">at this site</a>, all US residents can get tests <a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">at this site</a>, and further guidance is available <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/index.html">at the CDC’s website</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Banana C.</h3> 
                   <p>Hi! I’m Banana and I had the privilege of working on a few of the deities, specifically Iomedae, Pharasma, Ragathiel, and Sarenrae. I had such a great time writing up the rituals involved for each deity, especially Pharasma’s. I’m a sucker for any god of death and goth stuff. Aside from this book, my latest work has been on <em>Suburban Consumption of the Monstrous</em>, <em>Exquisite Crime, Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall</em>, <em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em> and <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill 3rd Edition</em>. You can also find me on Twitter and TikTok @bananachangames and on YouTube under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BananaCGames">https://www.youtube.com/c/BananaCGames</a>.</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone! My name’s Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author. For <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>, I contributed Avalorex, the Knightly Training and Lastwall Sentry feats, the spells, details on the Eye of Dread region, and—my personal favorite—entries on the gods Arqueros, Kols, and Vildeis, and all the <em>avatar</em> stats. This book was a really fun project to work on and I’m grateful to have been a part of it. Dig in and enjoy!</p>

                   <h3>Ryan Costello</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, I’m Ryan Costello, contributor to <em>Knights of Lastwall</em> and Director of Operations at the Know Direction Network. Until recently, I was always up to my eyeballs in Pathfinder. Now that I’ve stepped away from the Know Direction podcast, it’s more meaningful to me when I get to participate in a Pathfinder project. And what a project! <em>Knights of Lastwall</em> takes the classic imagery of chivalry and combines it with the sensibilities, forward thinking, and creativity that makes the Lost Omens line some of my favorite Pathfinder content ever.</p> 
                   <p>I especially liked working on the “Other Groups” article and exploring the Charcoal Battalion from Oprak’s Ironfang Legion, the Final Epitaph philosophy of Pharasmin knights, the orcs of the Rampart Warband, and my favorite¬¬: the undead hunting Eagle Knight splinter group known as the Vulture Knights. By eating carrion, vultures play an important role in disease containment in our ecosystem. Tying vultures to hunting undead wrote itself, and I got to cast these vilified creatures as the noblest of heroes. The section I worked on that will probably see the most play is the “Knights of Lastwall Backgrounds” article. As my wonderful developer Luis put it, you can tell I wrote this section by the wordplay. </p>

                   <h3>Alastor Guzman</h3> 
                   <p>Hey, I am Alastor Guzman, your local Mexican game designer. I’m a freelance designer and writer and have worked on several indie games and some bigger projects like <em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em>. I was honored to be able to write some of the factions in the “Other Groups” article as well as some magic items for <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>. It was lots of fun designing new magic items for a Pathfinder book, looking for the mix of utility, purpose, and awe in the items that will see your table. I also enjoyed developing the groups and their interrelationships in a way you can use in your games. </p> 
                   <p>Besides my work as a freelancer, I have also worked on smaller Mexican projects such as the ENNIE-nominated <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/320918/The-Maze"><em>The Maze</em></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/390489/Tezca-Sentai"><em>Tezca Sentai</em></a>. I am currently working on new projects like a legendary fight system for fantasy RPGs, and fantasy settings based on Mesoamerican mythology.

                   <h3>Erin Roberts</h3> 
                   <p>Hi! I’m Erin Roberts, and I loved bringing a little bit of love to this book by writing the married knights Buttons and Fenn Tunwalker, along with the intro to the “Factions” article, a few of the minor factions, and Milani, the Everbloom. While I had a wonderful time writing all of it, creating a couple whose love for each other and the knights they watch over is a source of strength during tumultuous times was particularly meaningful for me, given *gestures at the world*.</p> 
                   <p>I’ve appeared around these parts in the past as part of <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> (everything is cake!) and in <em>Starfinder Bounty #3: A Green Place</em>, and I have work coming up in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Travel Guide</em> and <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nirele">@nirele</a> for more about those projects and other fun things I’m working on!</p>

                   <h3>Ashton Sperry (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Howdy! It’s me, your nonbinary freelancer friend on the internet! I wrote the entries on Khagrig Daybreak and Gendowyn in Chapter 2, and the “Broken Lands” and “Other Campaigns” sections in Chapter 4 of <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>. Every project I’ve been on has been a distinct honor and pleasure, working hand-in-hand with my fellow authors as well as our developers to bring this fine material to y’all. With my sections, I got to explore some of the more unusual characters tied to the Knights, which I had a lot of fun doing; “How does a Chaotic Neutral fey queen tie into the faiths of the knighthood?” and “How would my knight character fit into a campaign set in Vudra?” were just some of the questions I got to explore in my submissions for this fine tome. As always, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/WhoTweetedThis">@WhoTweetedThis</a> where I talk about gaming stuff and post the occasional piece of art. Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>!</p>

                   <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3> 
                   <p>Hallo everyone! I’m Isabelle Thorne, trans girl and long-time Paizo contributor. I had a big hand in this one, as you might guess from the cover! The Knights of Lastwall really are my baby; I first developed them in the Pathfinder <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> and followed through in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Legends</em> with the Iomedars, all leading up to this. And they’re the first piece of Pathfinder I really got to shape from the start. So, this is kind of a big moment for me!</p> 
                   <p>And there’s so much. In addition to most of the section intros and other bridges, I contributed the in-depth looks at the Crimson Reclaimers and Shining Sentinels, and the insight in “Life as a Knight of Lastwall.” I also got to show off some of my NPCs from earlier books, like Beirivelle and Ileana (and Clarethe again!). Additionally, I had the opportunity to explore deities through a knight’s eyes; Kazutal, Falayna, Shelyn (finally!! I’m so happy), and our first look at the Vudrani deity Suyuddha. Finally, I expanded on my knight vigilant and knight reclaimant, plus feats for other archetypes.</p> 
                   <p>Beyond this momentous occasion, I’m expanding into freelance editing and fiction; you’ll get to see some of that in <em>Queerfinder</em> on Pathfinder Infinite and the recently crowdfunded <em>Sinclair’s Library</em>. Hopefully I’ll have so much more yet to show you. ^_^</p>

                   <h3>Befriend, Train, Battle, and Evolve!</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here. I’m excited to announce a new Kickstarter from Roll for Combat, which went live today at <a href="http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com">http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com</a>! The Kickstarter features three exciting sourcebooks described below!</p> 
                   <p><b><em>Battlezoo Eldamon</em></b> lets you befriend, train, battle, and evolve ancient and playful monsters based on 10–20 elemental types, such as fire, ice, death, and possibly even music and time! Eldamon are slightly out of phase with reality and like to meld into items, creatures, and locations. You can add them seamlessly into any setting, allowing characters to interact with and collect them without disrupting the established adventure or requiring the GM to rebuild or change encounters. Anyone can befriend eldamon and have them fight playful mock duels with each other, but only the eldamon trainer class can phase them into our world to use them in combat against deadly threats. Meanwhile, as an elemental avatar, you have a powerful but quiescent eldamon melded into you, allowing you to harness the power of their strange abilities! <em>Battlezoo Eldamon</em> is perfect for monster-training lovers of all ages. The rules are simple enough to offer a great way to introduce children to the game but deep enough to provide a variety of combinations for strategic players. In addition to the rulebook for Pathfinder, you can also get your hands on a card game called <em>Eldamon Battles</em> (offering players the chance to experience duels between eldamon quickly and strategically), plushies of six of the most common eldamon, battle minis, dice sets, leather notebooks, and more!</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84f81e7a-b813-4d6d-930a-7b61f863b4b4/RfC_MiguelRegodonHarkness_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84f81e7a-b813-4d6d-930a-7b61f863b4b4/RfC_MiguelRegodonHarkness_2.jpg" hspace="5" width="80%" alt="An eldamon trainer and elemental avatar enjoy a campfire with several eldamon friends."></a>

                   </div> 
                   <p><b><em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Year of Monsters</em></b> sends a monstrous new ancestry to your inbox every month, plus a final compilation book at the end that collects all the ancestries and offers more additional content! Such ancestries include demons, gremlins, intelligent weapons, dungeons expanded (you can get the original dungeon ancestry for free, despite the stated price of 1 cent, at http://battlezoo.com), oni, nymphs, doppelgangers, minotaurs, slimes, sthenos, mimics, and sidhe. Each ancestry will receive roughly twice as much content as a standard size ancestry, such as those presented in the <em>Core Rulebook or Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. Thanks to stretch goals, some of the ancestry options might expand even more!</p> 
                   <p>Lastly, <em><b>Battlezoo Bestiary Strange &amp; Unusual</b></em> is the result of the 2021 RPG Superstar contest, licensed from Paizo. It features 150 award-winning monsters, an expansion of the monster parts system from <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, the aberrant soul archetype (an option for characters who are slowly transforming into aberrations), and more. </p> 
                   <p>I’m very excited about these new projects, and I hope you’ll check out the Kickstarter at <a href="http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com">http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com</a>.

                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>I’m incredibly proud of my work on <em>Dark Archive</em>, including the Rumored Cryptid adjustment (page 61), "The Beast of Birchfrost" cryptid adventure (pages 66–71; turn to page 69 to see pictures of my son), “Tempting Curses” (page 162) and “Bargained Contracts” (page 164). During the design process, I spent a good amount of time at my local library flipping through folktales. One difficulty with writing concepts based in folklore is avoiding appropriation, as there are a number of tales and creatures that get presented as universal but actually have specific cultural origins. I worked hard to make my pieces feel like they could've come from real world folklore without appropriating.</p> 
                   <p>This work challenged me in ways that made me grow as a designer. It was my first time working on a Pathfinder hardcover book and focusing on mechanical options instead of adventures. I'm excited to see it in everyone's hands at this point. I'm particularly eager to see how people use this work in the future, as I love the collaborative nature of tabletop games.</p>

                   <p>Hi, I’m Jessica Catalan! I’m the current Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who writes a whole lot of words for Pathfinder and Starfinder! For <em>Dark Archive</em>, I wrote the Experimental Cryptid adjustment on page 60, “Time (Oracle Mystery)” on page 188, and “Hazards of Perception” on pages 122–125. <em>Dark Archive</em> is a weird, wild, and wonderful book and I’m beyond proud to be a part of it!</p>

                   <p>Hi! I'm Banana and I'm a game designer and screenwriter. When I was asked to write for <em>Dark Archive</em>, I was ecstatic (but I tried very hard to stay cool so I wouldn't embarrass myself). I wrote the rituals and the adventure “The Verdure of Iblydos” on page 148. Please note, I'm not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, I've just done a lot of research for this adventure (this is for any other fans of the podcast <em>Cults</em>). The big inspiration points for me (other than the <em>Cults</em> podcast), were folk horror movies, such as <em>The Empty Man</em>, <em>The Invitation</em>, <em>The Wicker Man</em>, <em>The Blood on Satan's Claw</em> and (of course) <em>Midsommar</em> and how new age beliefs currently operate. The cult leader, Mother Mitera, is specifically inspired by Nine Perfect Strangers, Goop, and Teal Swan.</p>

                   <p>Hi all, Sen.H.H.S. here. I'm a TTRPG freelancer who started my debut with <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em> and has since contributed to several other books including <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em>, <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>, “Ready? Fight!” from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path, and <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em>. For the <em>Dark Archive</em>, I had the privilege of working on the first half of “The Last Dream” mindscape adventure on page 208. Yes, “that” map was my doing, you're welcome. :D Currently, I am working on a Pathfinder Infinite project featuring a team of Taiwanese writers. We hope we'll be presenting something about a traveling salesperson with interesting items sometime in the future. Please follow me on Twitter @SenHHS to discover when that will become available.</p>

                   <p>Hey everyone! I’m Soup (they/them), a terminally hermit-inclined person that they keep letting write weird stuff. It was incredibly fun to write about the paranormal in a world where “normal” means magic, ghosts, and dragons. I wrote some of the case file lore sections and made sure to include lots of fun prompts that I hope will get your brain juices going. I think I was pretty successful at writing some spooky stuff and I hope you find it as neat as I did! I’m actually about to start running a Pathfinder Second Edition game for my weekly group and the <em>Dark Archive</em> will definitely be a cool book to draw from. I’m super excited to take a look at what the other authors have contributed!

You might know me as the co-host of the 2x Gold ENnie Award winning <em>Asians Represent!</em> podcast or from my game design work (<em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em>, <em>Avatar Legends</em>, <em>Wicked Congregation</em>, <em>Ross Rifles</em>, &amp; <em>Motherlands RPG</em>). I am also one of the co-founders of Level Up Gaming, a Toronto-based organization that provides the autism community with opportunities to develop social skills through tabletop gaming experiences. I wrote the “Sounds of Violence” incident report on page 115 of <em>Dark Archive</em>. The story prompt revolves around the aoyin, a creature from a classical Chinese text called the <em>Shanhaijing</em> (the <em>Classic of Mountains &amp; Seas</em>)!</p>

                   <p>Hi there, I’m Michael W. Jacobs—the so-called “evil” twin of Jacob W. Michaels, or so “they” would have you believe. But I ask, is it evil to expose you to the Echoing Pale? Would it not be worse to leave you in the dark, ignorant to all the lurking dangers blending in with the rest of us on Golarion? What if you didn’t know? What if you didn’t have to always be looking over your shoulder, wondering why the merchant you’ve worked with for years now scowls when you enter her shop? That casual greeting—just a friendly passer-by, or someone who thinks they know you, for some reason you can’t figure out? What if? (Evil twin aside, I’m actually Jacob W. Michaels, regular Paizo freelancer. I got to do the intro to Mirrors and Imposters section on page 116 of <em>Dark Archive</em>. It was a blast, and I hope it gives you something to reflect on.)</p>

                   <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, Andrew Mullen here! My contribution to this book is the Mutant Cryptid template on page 59. Want to spice up a monster by making it weak to the memory of the taste of borscht, or some even more bizarre phenomena? I've got you covered! I've always enjoyed monster design, so I was very glad to offer ways GMs can make stranger adversaries.</p> 
                   <p>Beyond this, I'm involved in two other projects of note. Alongside Mikhail Rekun (who you may recognize from the <em>Dark Archive</em> cover!) and Isabelle Thorne (who you may recognize from the <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em> cover!), I'm a key member of the Luminant Age team. Luminant Age is a third-party campaign setting for Pathfinder Second Edition, a post-apocalyptic world of strange faiths, strange magics, and stranger creatures. You can find us at <a href="http://luminant-age.itch.io">http://luminant-age.itch.io</a>. I'm also a judge for the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/vu3kje/brewmasters_compendium_competition_round_3/">Brewmaster’s Compendium round</a> 3] over on the Pathfinder Second Edition subreddit!

                   <br> 
                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I’m one of the cover authors for <em>Dark Archive</em>.</p> 
                   <p>I’ve always been interested in what one might call “Weird History.” As a historian, I mostly deal with formal, scholarly research and education—I even have a book, <em>How Russia Lost Bulgaria, 1878-1886: Empire Unguided</em> (Lexington Books, 2018). After hours though, I’d go down Fortean rabbit-holes like the Eilean Mor disappearances or the Philadelphia Experiment. So, when James Case asked if I wanted my name on the cover of the <em>Dark Archive</em>, well, I could hardly turn him down now, could I?</p> 
                   <p>I wrote the lore sections for the Secret Societies (page 74), Deviant Abilities (page 94), and Curses and Pacts (page 156) sections, as well as “The Sacral King” incident report (combining Emperor Norton I of America with the Fisher King concept, for you Weird History fans) and the “Wishes in Krasnoprudny” adventure, along with several mechanical tidbits here and there.</p> 
                   <p>If you like what you see here, I’m also the creative director of the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler setting currently working on fulfilling our second Kickstarter. If you're fond of chimeric vampires and razor-wire whips, please follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">@LuminantA</a> or check out our published products at <a href="https://luminant-age.itch.io/">https://luminant-age.itch.io</a>!</p>

                   <p>Greetings internet. I go by Sol, and I put my teenage special interest in cults and other esoteric faiths to use writing the lore of the Cults section (page 136) along with the “Occult Skill Feats” (page 78) that I hope you’ll enjoy. Atypical understandings of the divine are some of my favorite things to explore, so it was a real treat to take a broad look at some of the unexpected ways people in Golarion connect with the sacred and profane.</p> 
                   <p>My first year and change at Paizo has been delightfully busy; in addition to working full-time as an in-house editor, I also wrote my first OP adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02as9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-312-Furys-Toll"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-12: Fury’s Toll</em></a>, along with the “Spectra, Corrupted” adventure hook for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a> and the undead companions &amp; familiars from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0j?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead"><em>Pathfinder: Book of the Dead</em></a> which, yes, includes the one that made everybody cry. I’m not sorry. :)</p>

                   <p>I'm Mark Seifter, Roll for Combat director of game design, and Paizo's former design manager as well as one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> 
                   <p>In <em>Dark Archive</em>, I wrote an assortment of different pieces, the foremost among them being the thaumaturge class on page 30. Thaumaturges use magical implements and exploit weaknesses and sympathetic connections in order to create magical effects without spellcasting and support various playstyles. I hope the class intrigues you and inspires you to create new characters, but most of all I hope it's fun to play!</p>

                   <p>Hi, all! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I wrote the reflection versatile heritage (page 119), apocryphal domain spells (page 142), and the sleepwalker archetype (page 206). The question of what's considered "weird" or "mysterious" in a setting with established magic and supernatural abilities has always been one that's interested me (what exists on the margins of a fantastical world?), and <em>Dark Archive</em> was a great opportunity to explore that. Getting these sections was really cool to work on, since at one point or another, I've written stories about both mirror people and dream magic. The apocryphal domain spells were also a fun challenge, as I tried to come up with more metaphorical or abstract associations with the usual domains. I hope people enjoy these new character options! You can find me (and cat pictures) at Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a>, and my full credits are on my website at <a href="http://klspeedling.com/">klspeedling.com</a>.</p>

                   <p>Hey all, I’m Isis Woz, one of Paizo’s freelancers. I’ve written for <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, wrote two Starfinder scenarios (Starfinder Society Scenario #3-21: Frozen Ambitions: Renewal’s Blight and Starfinder Society Scenario #5-04: Fragment of the 4th), and I also did work on the upcoming <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>. But for <em>Dark Archive</em> I wrote the mind smith archetype (page 204) and I’m so happy with how it came out! I hope people enjoy having a sword made of pure mental energy to play around with.</p> 
                   <p>For me, <em>Dark Archive</em> was such a treat to work on since it covers so many interests that I’ve had in fantasy. As a longtime fan of paranormal and psychic detective stories—and a comparative literature major with an emphasis in mythology and spiritualism—this book is one that I’ve been excited for since I was given the chance to write for it. Hopefully you all will enjoy it too.</p>

                   <p>“<em>Revolution!</em> is an outlier in our catalog, the game closest to the ‘Euro’ wave titles of the mid-2000s we’ve ever released. It’s a game where your ability to read the table and your skills at guile and diplomacy can be stronger than any other abilities you bring to the session. Rather than relying on the luck of the draw or the roll of the dice to achieve victory, your social skills and long-term plans have the most decisive impact on your position at the game’s end. With <em>Pathfinder Revolution!</em> we’ve finally managed to bring the game back in a new edition that incorporates the best mechanics and concepts from the earlier edition of the game and its expansions.” says Phil Reed, CEO of Steve Jackson Games.</p> 
                   <p>Steve Jackson Games, based in Austin, Texas, has been publishing games, game books, and magazines since 1980. Steve Jackson Games released <em>Car Wars Sixth Edition</em>, a new take on its best-selling classic. Other top sellers are <em>The Fantasy Trip</em>, <em>Zombie Dice</em>, and <em>Illuminati</em>. Past hits have included the <em>Dungeon Fantasy</em> and GURPS roleplaying game systems. Steve’s very first game, <em>Ogre</em>, was originally published in 1977.</p>

                   <p>This month we’ve got two delightful releases, so let’s dive right in!</p> 
                   <p>For months, the Starfinder Society has sifted through the wreckage of Histora-Prime's life, working to put an end to any of his remaining schemes and to make reparations for his many crimes. When the Starfinders uncover the existence of a hidden complex in Absalom Station’s Spike owned by Historia-Prime, a team of agents is dispatched to investigate! Explore the complex, uncover its purpose, and escape alive—if you can! Feast your eyes on one of the terrifying foes awaiting you within the—wait, why is it so… fluffy?</p>

                   <p>Meanwhile, the Drift Crisis continues to wreak havoc on the galaxy! On Akiton, unstable planar matter ejected from the Drift has collided with the old mining town of Grat Gwaz, causing regional destruction and rapid biological mutations. From the wreckage sprouts colorful flora which quickly overtakes the region, terraforming Great Gwaz into a lush jungle paradise—a bountiful resource ripe for exploitation. At the request of famed Akitonian Starfinder Avor Stelek, a team of Starfinders is dispatched to investigate the so-called "planar bloom." Rub elbows with opportunistic gangs, hopeful citizens, and scientific investigators on your quest to determine what should be done with the planar bloom! Does the site’s bounty outweigh the danger? Or should the planar bloom be destroyed? The fate of Great Gwaz is in your hands! </p>

                   <p>Last month we previewed the final scenarios for Pathfinder Society Year 3, which can mean only one thing: this month we get previews for the beginning of Year 4, the Year of Boundless Wonder!</p> 
                   <p>The first Pathfinder Society scenario for August, and for Year 4, is naturally the introduction to this year’s metaplot! The Pathfinder Society has been entrusted with a vast trove of magic items and other treasures, but an old nemesis wants to get her hands on the objects as well. The head archivist, Zarta Dralneen, has tasked a group of agents with sorting through the items in the Grand Lodge’s vaults, but the Society’s enemy has a surprise or two in store for them! When the PCs come face-to-face with unexpected enemies, they must keep their wits about them to survive—and if they do, they may gain some new allies, and valuable insight into their new enemy’s schemes! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02du3?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Boundless-Wonder"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Boundless Wonder</em></a> (Scenario #4-01) is an adventure for 1st- through 4th- level characters by yours truly. It’s a “Repeatable” adventure, so you can earn Organized Play credit for multiple characters by playing or GMing the adventure multiple times.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Our next adventure takes us to the Gravelands, a haunted land brimming with undead horrors. The Pathfinder Society has learned of a settlement of refugees trapped within the mist-shrouded borders of the Gravelands. They need help, and they’re running out of time before the Whispering Tyrant’s forces discover them and add their corpses to his armies! The Pathfinder Society seizes on an opportunity to send a small group of agents behind enemy lines, chart a safe path, and get the refugees—including some unlikely new friends—to safety. <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02du4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-402-Return-to-the-Grave">Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-02: Return to the Grave</a></em> is an adventure for 1st- through 4th-level characters by Joseph Blomquist.

In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Pathfinder Society is in talks with Linnorm King White Estrid of the Ironbound Isles to secure the rights to explore the Isle of the Ancestors, where she famously bested the crag linnorm Boiltongue in combat. However, the talks have been disrupted by the arrival of Boiltongue’s children—five rambunctious linnorm siblings—in the city of Halgrim. Gorm Greathammer of the Pathfinder Society believes that the ensuing chaos is a test of the Pathfinder Society’s capabilities, and has sent for a group of agents to look after the linnorms and keep them from causing too much trouble while he wraps up negotiations. It’s all fun and games until… never mind, it’s pretty much a disaster from the start!</p>

                   <h3>More Resources Coming Soon</h3> 
                   <p>As the Infinite programs continue to grow, we’ve heard a lot of feedback from creators looking for more resources, and we’re happy to oblige. In the coming weeks, we plan to release more art packs to help community publishers make content to support our major new releases, including <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em> and the Blood Lords Adventure Path. We’re also looking into adding AP-specific filters to the site so that GMs running a given campaign can quickly find community content geared specifically for them. It’s an exciting time to publish or shop on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite, and the future is going to be even more so.</p>

                   <p><b>Name: John Vanegas<br> Pronouns: he/him<br> Role (if not staff): current player, occasional DM<br> Social Media Handles: @JohnaldV (Twitter/Instagram) and @SciStarMedia (Infinite Adventures Podcast on Twitter/Instagram)</b></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Tell us about yourself. What is your bio? What's your story behind the bio? Why do you do what you do? </h3> 
                   <p>I grew up and have lived in the DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) area. I am a second-generation immigrant who has some mixed feelings about his place in the world: but more positive ones than negative. I was raised under the presumption that I was a gifted kid and rode that in stride until I was knocked down a peg when I got to high school. Consequently, I straddle the line between grandiosity and self-forced humility. I love creating art because as cheesy as it is, it’s the easiest and most digestible form of self-expression. If you just say what you feel, people either write you off or call you pretentious. But if you present a fictional fantasy that conveys something important, the message can be taken with a bit of sugar. I think that art is a way of connecting and building bridges between other people. Everyone's a stranger after all. Observing and taking in art is a way to connect with the part of you that exists within other people.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Tell us about a project you are particularly proud of? </h3> 
                   <p>Of all the projects I’ve been a part of, I can say with absolute certainty that I am most proud of the Infinite Adventures Podcast! We have published almost 180 episodes, and I can’t be prouder of how far we’ve come. It is single-handedly the largest/longest project I have worked on, and I have enjoyed every minute of it (except when I am required to edit but that’s neither here nor there). </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>How have you seen immersive fantasy worlds and cooperative strategic play bring people together and create lifelong friendships?</h3> 
                   <p>One thing I can say about the TTRPG experience that I absolutely love is that it’s like a masquerade ball. You invite a bunch of your closest friends and hope that they get along with each other. And it becomes an easier experience in my opinion (for more socially anxious, nerdy types) when you allow them to interact with other people through the lens of fantasy characters. Doing so allows them to embrace self-confidence they otherwise might not have. After a while, most gaming sessions transform from focusing on going straight into the action to giving everyone a place to hang out in a safe space.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Please tell us about your pet!</h3> 
                   <p>Ok! I don’t live with them anymore—they live with my folks—but I have two adorable dobies and they are just the sweetest noblest boys in the entire world. Tyler is a black dobie with a passive curiosity about everything. He’s always looking around and watching what everyone is doing, and you can just see the spark of an intellectual buried in his canine soul. Austin is a gray dobie. He is incredibly playful, often exhibiting bursts of energy out of the blue. You absolutely do not need a mind reader for him; he telegraphs every minute emotion and feeling he has. If he could speak, this boy’s stream of consciousness could be heard out loud.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What character would you like to play next and why?</h3> 
                   <p>I have not played a dromite before and we need to fix that one day. I have always liked insectile species in fiction. I think that they’re not as common because many people feel scared of bugs, but there’s something fascinating about them to me. They’re like living machines, one of the closest things to aliens we have on our planet. We know they have societies and systems as complex as humans and yet they live alongside us doing their own thing. But being able to pretend what it’s like to be a large sapient ant person in a fantasy game sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">At least this isn’t in Ustalav, Mios thought, smiling wryly to themself as they approached the Lily Lounge. It hadn’t taken much investigating into the recent mysterious disappearances in Augustana to find all signs pointing to this new luxury lounge, famous almost overnight. <em>If this were Ustalav</em>, Mios figured, <em>the lodge would be full of vampires. Or werewolves. Or some kind of vampiric werewolves like those vukodlaks from last winter</em>.</p> 
                   <p>The Lily Lounge’s clientele, at least the ones who hadn’t been disappearing, tended towards the wealthy; after all, it advertised itself as a luxurious resting place for valiant hunters returning from their hunts. Though Andoran claimed to not have any nobles (<em>technically true</em>), many of these clients were just that in all but name. The real trouble is that the lounge was reported to also let in the less well to do… who would then go missing. Not at the lounge, though, and not right away. Whoever was responsible, likely the owners, weren’t that sloppy. No, these poorer clients were always seen afterwards for some time but mysteriously disappeared within a fortnight, often alongside reports of erratic behavior. <em>Even odds it’s enchantment magic forcing the victim to kidnap themselves</em>, Mios thought, <em>or maybe this is the one time it actually IS a doppelganger replacing them at the lounge</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Regardless, the place was highly suspicious. Though Mios could tell that the lounge’s secrets were rather well-hidden by anyone else’s standards, little things gave it away to their trained eye. <em>Heliotrope planted at the four corners of the lot, to divert close attention. Structure offset slightly from cardinal directions, subtly separating building from external expectations to decrease guard</em>. It even extended to the proprietors—thought of highly, but only ever in the vaguest of terms—even Mios couldn’t discover much about one Gilbert Zoon (the lounge’s founder) or his business partner Sabricia (last name unknown). They’d been seen out during the day, though, so at least they weren’t vampires. And nothing was timed around the full moon…. Mios reflexively reached out and touched the old wound on their leg, another reminder of the past, and what it meant to let down one’s guard. Memories like these were why Mios never regretted leaving Ustalav behind. Here in Andoran, what was the worst it could be? <em>No</em>, Mios thought as they reflexively formed a turning-away sign, <em>better not to jinx it</em>. Some of the old superstitions died hard.</p> 
                   <p>Their reminiscence was broken by an incoming party of young hunters—just the chance Mios had been waiting for. They waited until the hunters had just entered, then adjusted their wolf pelt, held their back straight, and walked forward like they owned the lodge. They’d seen enough nobles in their life that it was easy to put on airs. At the door, Mios made some small talk with the staff before being invited in. <em>Pupil dilation normal, good recall of earlier events, able to respond to abstract questions</em>. The staff didn’t seem to be under any form of direct mind control, though they did seem a bit tense.</p> 
                   <p>After a day or two casing the Lily Lounge, Mios had decided the front door would be better than sneaking in a window or cellar, which would almost certainly be trapped or magically defended against break-ins. <em>Threshold magic—versatile, but dependent on intent</em>. If the owner’s intent was toward privacy, the magic could help reinforce a boundary between the outside and inside. It was the same principle when creating a circle of salt to ward off a ghost—create a boundary, then give it authority. <em>But you can’t bar a door that you’ve opened yourself, like the front door. Let alone put greeters at</em>. Even vampires can freely enter a public building. The staff smiled at Mios, and they walked in.</p> 
                   <p>As Mios entered, two beads on their wrist pulsed once with subtle light, and a tarnished coin on their waist spun slightly. The building <em>had</em> been highly warded, then—but Mios had made it through easily. They absconded down a hallway, away from guests and staff, and reached out an empty hand. <em>Ownership is never broken by mere distance, only a change in relationship</em>. As Mios concentrated on the truism, they felt a familiar weight through their glove. When they looked down at their hand again, their lantern shone in it, and in its light, once-invisible defenses crisscrossed the walls and doors. Mios peered at an especially warded door. <em>Sarkorian abjuration, but corrupted. Strange to see that so far south</em>. It suggested demonic influence, or someone familiar with the Worldwound and its closing. Mios shifted their usual silver blade to a back sheath, replacing it with one of cold-forged iron, just in case. With a bit of effort—more than it usually took—Mios dismantled the wards, opened the door, and crept down the hallway beyond.</p> 
                   <p>Passing nondescript private suites, Mios’s lantern light eventual fell upon a door covered up entirely by an illusion. Curious, since there was no sign of this wing from the outside. <em>Extradimensional, or just a massive illusion</em>? Mios slipped into the room to find out. <em>Ah, the classic trapdoor leading down</em>. That explained it. Maybe just mundane architectural tricks then. The chamber below was furnished in fine silk, imported wood, and elegant paintings, easily the most grandiose and opulent part of the lounge… but in the lantern’s light, the facade melted away. The entire place was a dismal cavern with clear demonic magic coursing through it. Well, clear to Mios. Surely the victims had been fooled. The thaumaturge drew their iron blade.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>As Mios turned the corner, their light shone on two figures who must have been the owners, though no sooner did the light reach them than their true forms were revealed. The man, now a hideous creature with claws and a carapace, shrieked in pain and flinched backwards from the light. Weak to light… no, not to light. <em>Treachery demon. Harmed by truth</em>. An incredibly dangerous threat for the unsuspecting citizenry of Augustana, but Mios began to grin; they were just about the worst possible match-up the demon could face. The thaumaturge reached into one of their many pouches, riffling for a bit before settling on a dried chrysanthemum. They passed the flower through the flame of their lantern and smeared the ash on their pick. They felt the concepts align, felt the tension of forces coming to oppose each other: against an unnatural creature of treachery cloaked in falsehoods, present an object of the natural world, symbolizing honesty, tempered in the light of truth. Three properties from the demon, three from Mios. </p> 
                   <p>Their pick thrummed with power as the creatures howled. Time to get to work.</p>

                   <p>Okay, Pathfinder Society Year 3 is coming to an end. I’ve got one more chance to shatter some sanctuaries… here goes!</p> 
                   <p>We’ve got two July scenarios for the Pathfinder Society. In our first offering, a group of Pathfinder Society agents has been tasked with chaperoning a class of Dacilane Academy students on a field trip! Located in Absalom, Dacilane Academy provides a stable educational environment for children of active Pathfinders. Well, “stable” might be a strong word. Those familiar with previous incidents might recall that Dacilane Academy has seen its fair share of supernatural shenanigans. And it hasn’t seen the last of them, either! When someone says, “What could possibly go wrong on a Dacilane Academy field trip to Woodsedge Lodge?” the only thing you know to expect… is the unexpected! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-318-Dacilane-Academys-Delightful-Disaster">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-18: Dacilane Academy’s Delightful Disaster</a> is the debut Pathfinder Society adventure of freelance author Matt Morris. It’s a non-metaplot scenario for 1st- through 4th-level characters.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Our second adventure for the month is the conclusion of the four-part “Absalom” metaplot arc in Year 3, and the overall conclusion of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot! After learning the true culprit responsible for the Pathfinder Society’s recent troubles, and discovering an imminent threat, the Society has dispatched its toughest agents to Shadow Absalom, the twisted “dark reflection” of Absalom on the Shadow Plane. There, they must prevent a terrible foe from acquiring great power—and perhaps gain some unlikely allies in the process! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-319-Mean-Streets-of-Shadow-Absalom">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-19: Mean Streets of Shadow Absalom</a> is authored by Amber Stewart, one of the original creative minds behind Shadow Absalom and many other notable elements of the Age of Lost Omens. It is a metaplot scenario for 7th- through 10th-level characters and includes an Envoy’s Alliance faction mission.</p>

Wesley Schneider established the foundations for what would grow into the Lost Omens setting we continue to explore and expand today. </p> 
                   <p>Paizo’s Director of Game Design, Jason Bulmahn, recounts:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>Losing the magazines was a scary time at Paizo. Exciting, but scary. None of us really knew how things were going to shake out long-term, but we had a plan to carry on making Adventure Paths, something we were known for from the pages of <em>Dungeon</em> magazine. The only problem was that we only needed three people to make the Adventure Paths happen, and we had six folks on the editorial staff.</p> 
                    <p>My job back then was to create everything else, from maps and cards to standalone adventures. And that is where <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> came in. While the Rise of the Runelords was fleshing out Varisia, Mike McArtor, Jeremy Walker, and I worked to create Darkmoon Vale, a small wilderness area in which to set a couple of standalone adventures to get us started. Although <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em> was technically first, it was a smaller adventure for Free RPG Day, and Crown was set to be our true premier.</p> 
                    <p>We were lucky to get Nicolas Logue as our author. We were still putting together our styles, but Nick’s bombastic encounters made for a fun, exciting dungeon romp. This adventure would also serve as the very first step into a much bigger story. Around this time, we were picking up the pieces of some of our older products, looking for ideas to add to Golarion. One place we searched was the “Compleat Encounter” line of products. One of these was the <em>Vault of the Whispering Tyrant</em>, which introduced an important character to our world. In these very early days, although we knew little else about him, we decided that he was sealed away, kept at bay by three seal stones. One such stone was already broken, and its remains were under the dungeon of this adventure (you can see a hint for it in area 28, the Forsaken Tunnel). </p> 
                    <p>Honestly, looking back at this adventure brings back memories of a Paizo long past, where we were all just scrappy kids making the stories that would come to define a world. I am excited to see this story polished up for a new generation of gamers!</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <p>To celebrate Paizo’s anniversary and 15 years of the setting we all love, Paizo is releasing a hardcover compilation of the Crown of the Kobold King saga, updated from its original 3.5e rules (this predates even Pathfinder first edition, after all) to Pathfinder Second Edition, and including a whole new chapter by original Kobold King scribe Nicolas Logue. The book’s lead developer, Creative Director James Jacobs, has the following to say about the process.</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>It took over half a decade to do it, but we got there eventually. Originally, we planned on doing a compilation of the Kobold King adventures in a big adventure to support first-edition Pathfinder at about halfway through that edition’s life cycle—that’s when I hired Nick Logue to write the “missing level” after all. But then, for various reasons, we didn’t move forward with the project and the final level just sat in limbo on my hard drive. Fast forward to 2021, when we were facing a lot of challenges with the standalone adventure line’s schedule and availability for folks to work on it. With the renewed look and interest on kobolds, it seemed like a good time to go back!</p> 
                    <p>Combining the adventures together into one single adventure presented a few unusual challenges as well, beyond the known challenge of converting from 3.5 rules to Pathfinder Second Edition. Most significantly, the individual plots for the previously published adventures, which were meant to be stand-alone themselves, kind of clashed and didn’t work well together. It was sort of like having three different openings to the story. And so those plots got minimized, turned into background elements, or got written out/replaced entirely, and I focused more on what was itself a “background element” of the original adventures—the presence of one of the seals that helped keep the Whispering Tyrant imprisoned. At the time of the original publication, that plot was very much in the category of “teasing future potential stories” but didn’t have much to do with the main adventures. Today, that plotline is the most important one, and so I focused the revision on those events. In doing so, and in bringing in the final “lost level” that Nick wrote years ago, a brand new plot came into being—one that, for the first time, reveals where the Crown of the Kobold King came from, what it was for, and what might happen if King Merlokrep’s plans come to fruition!</p> 
                   </blockquote> 
                   <p>A lot has changed in 15 years, but at its core, the same exciting adventures that launched Pathfinder are still as dangerous and engaging as ever. With fully updated art to reflect our reimagined Second Edition kobolds and the brand’s evolving visual style, the 128-page hardcover is sure to launch a new generation into an adventure-filled exploration of Golarion, or take old veterans back where they first began. Pick your copy up at your local game store or bookseller this fall, or preorder on paizo.com today. </p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Gazing past his easel at the bustling Commerce District of Niswan, Thaleon’s thoughts wandered once again. They rarely stayed put, but life would hardly be any fun if they did. There were so many delicious new sensations to take in, from the kites dancing overhead to the tempting sizzle of vegetable wraps from a nearby food stall. He observed the colors of the market, his eye lingering on a small shrine where a priest was drawing the rose of Shelyn in colored powders. The Rahadoumi elf didn’t worship to any gods himself, of course, but he had nothing but respect for the old priest’s lifelong devotion and mastery as his fingers effortlessly scattered a vibrant green around the rose’s exterior.

He blended the vibrant gold of a cunning merchant’s intellect with the frustrated red of the customer she had just outwitted in a battle of bargains. Now for some green as well, the color of growth, flexibility, potential... </p> 
                   <p>Thaleon frowned. He sensed a green, but it was of an altogether unpleasant, oily variety, coming from a woman in pristine robes, her ravenous eyes scouring the market. Wanting to get closer, Thaleon steadied his mind and searched his feelings until he found the one he needed. Calmness, boredom… no, listlessness. The drabbest of grays, utterly unremarkable. Without so much as an incantation, Thaleon cloaked himself in the emotion and vanished from sight. Quick and quiet as a shadow, he slipped through the marketplace. Most would struggle to navigate a crowd, even invisibly, without bumping into a customer or jostling a cart, but Thaleon had decades of practice slipping by unnoticed and had long ago learned the consequences of getting caught.</p> 
                   <p>The woman’s eyes found their target, and a predatory grin spread across her face. The crowd before her instinctively parted, and within moments, she held her prey in her grasp, her nails digging deep into the priest’s shoulders. As blood pooled in their wake, the woman whispered a single word, “Watch.” Her eyes flashed that oily green, the unmistakable swirl of magic about them. Thaleon saw nothing, but he felt the man’s terror, pure white and primal as the priest gazed with horror at a nightmare no one else could see. He fell to his knees and pushed the nearby offering basket, filled with flowers and a few coins. “Please, not them. Take what you want from me, just don’t….” His words were cut short as he vomited onto the cobblestones. The woman scowled with disgust. “This is your final warning.” With a regal nod, she strode away, splitting the crowd in her wake. </p> 
                   <p>Thaleon’s hands trembled. He wanted to soothe the priest’s terror and pain, but he knew the man couldn’t find peace while the monster’s threat loomed over him. He reached for compassion—blue, tranquil as a cloudless sky—and sent it flowing into the priest, calming the man and closing his wounds. The priest glanced about, seeking the source of the swirling colors. </p> 
                   <p>“Don’t worry, Father,” Thaleon whispered from the empty air, “you’re not alone.”</p> 
                   <p>He quickened his pace and strode after the woman. From that display, it was clear what manner of monster she was. All Thaleon needed was a chance, away from the market stalls where so many innocents walked, to show the fiend exactly what he felt about her threats. As fortune would have it, it didn’t take long before she chose to turn down a secluded alleyway.</p> 
                   <p>Thaleon didn’t need to search for his fury, it was right at his fingertips, and he used it to paint a simple blade in the air, the shape of the blade he’d been given when he left home. As the blade shot towards the woman, red fury burned away the tranquil gray that had kept Thaleon invisible, but he wasn’t afraid to let the monster see his face. With a feline growl, she rolled out of the blade’s path, scuffing her robes, before spinning toward Thaleon. Her hands spun too, twisting backward, and weaving shadowy threads of magic. </p> 
                   <p>An agonizing scream echoed within Thaleon’s mind, reverberating and tearing. He steeled his will against the oncoming tide, instinctively countering each wave of psychic sound until silence prevailed once again. Definitely a rakshasa, then. And one who underestimated him too, having chosen to attack him on the battlefield of the mind. Thaleon felt a surge of pride; if she wished to play with occult magic, she’d picked the wrong opponent.</p> 
                   <p>As the rakshasa leapt forward, Thaleon transmuted his pride into certainty and fortitude, summoning a disc of force in the air. Claws met the barrier and cracked it like glass, but Thaleon’s brow furrowed as he poured more will, more certainty, into the spell. More translucent shields sprung into being, and though the rakshasa’s claws shattered two of the discs, they could do no more than carve a groove into the third. She rebounded back, and Thaleon released a stream of chaotic emotion that collected around the rakshasa’s feet, dragging her to the ground, but not before she wove shadows into a bolt of flame that clipped Thaleon’s side.</p> 
                   <p>Arm throbbing, Thaleon’s fury blotted out all thought, bursting forth as the air shook with color. While the rakshasa was getting to her feet, he painted again, pouring out his heart to form not just one rage-blade, but an entire storm of them hovering above the alleyway. </p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>With an oily green flash of the rakshasa’s eyes, a sickening vision filled Thaleon’s mind—a group of rakshasas savoring a platter of roast meat unmistakably elven in origin. For an instant, the artist’s stomach churned before he recognized the intrusion and broke the enchantment. This twisted scene was the rakshasa’s dream, not his. Still, if she expected him to be sick... he retched loudly, hoping the monster’s pride would dull her suspicions. Right on cue, she charged, claws extended, running at full speed until she was just below the hanging blades. Thaleon rose from the ground, and with a last exertion, let the blades fall, each sharper and more jagged than the last.</p> 
                   <p>The rain lasted for only a moment, but when it was finished, Thaleon’s fury subsided, replaced by relief and sorrow for the fiend’s past victims. No more rakshasas threatened Niswan that day.</p>

                   <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 4 Rule Changes</h2> 
                   <p>Last week we posted a blog discussing our rule changes for Pathfinder Society Year 4. In short, there aren’t many! We’ve added some new boons to the store and are reducing some prices on others but overall, we don’t have major changes planned. Check out the blog for more details.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>Gen Con Indy and Gen Con Online are just under a month away! We’re excited to see you all in the Sagamore Ballroom once again and we hope you’re looking forward to it. Tickets for our physical events are almost completely sold out, but more turn up occasionally, so be sure to keep a close eye on events you’re interested in! Tickets for Gen Con Online can be purchased starting this Sunday July 10, so be sure to be online to grab your seats!</p> 
                   <p>After that, PaizoCon Europe will be running their events just two weeks later, from August 18-21. They’ll have the new August scenarios just as Gen Con did, so if you can’t visit us at Gen Con, PaizoCon Europe Online might be your best bet! You can find more information <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-europe-online-2022">on their Warhorn page</a>. Player signups open on July 15 at 12 noon BST.</p> 
                   <p>My hope is very soon, I’ll be able to start announcing other convention travel for later this year. I’ve been working on a plan for how I can see as many of you as possible this fall, so stay tuned!/p&gt; </p>
                   <p>As always, you can see upcoming conventions on our <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">Conventions Calendar</a>. Find your local community and support your local shows!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>We are delighted to announce today the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Outlaws+of+Alkenstar+Sanctioning.pdf">is now sanctioned </a>for Pathfinder Society play! Delve into the seedy underbelly of the clockwork city and thwart a deadly plan, all while earning experience for your Society characters! The sanctioning documents are available on the product pages and should be added to the landing page shortly.</p> 
                   <p>This month, we should be able to post sanctioning for <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em> (both the character options and the adventures within) as well as <em>Redshift Rally</em> for Starfinder. It’s convention season so our schedules are pretty busy, but we’re aiming for street date on both! Looking ahead, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Travel Guide</em> is next on our list, followed by <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> and the <em>Dead Suns</em> compilation.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>Campaign Coins</h3> 
                   <p>I intend to award some Campaign Coins at Gen Con/Gen Con Online, as well as potentially at PaizoCon Online Europe. If you would like to nominate one or more individuals for these coins, please email the nomination to organizedplay@paizo.com no later than <b>July 15</b>, so I have time to consider them.</p> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th Star for PFS1, and one GM earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Derek Larsen (Tyranius), Nathan Goodrich<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Olivier Brochet aka Zog</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! I’ll see you at Gen Con!</p>

You’ll find a piece of art and a bit of introductory text to get a feel for what’s coming soon. They are not complete introductions, mind you, because I obtained these under less than legal, er, less than ideal conditions. Still, I think you’ll be pleased and intrigued, dearie.

                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>“Welcome to the Dark Archive</p> 
                    <p>My future and fellow Archivists,<br> The Dark Archive is no more, except for me. When the Pathfinder Society announced that our faction was to be dissolved, absorbed into its other departments, I grabbed the files I could and left before they could stop me. These pages are all that remain of our faction’s records, and I am all that remains of our membership.</p> 
                    <p>This world of ours is strange, isn’t it? I muse on this idea more often than I care to admit, vital though it may be to our work. The most common description of the Dark Archive is that we “investigate the paranormal” and that’s... true, but it’s a description by negation. If we are to turn our gaze to the “paranormal”, first we must ask: what is normal? </p> 
                    <p>We know a staggering number of things about our world. We know of its general size and diversity of terrain, as well as a vast majority of the peoples and creatures that inhabit it. We know of the void that hangs above it, and that other worlds, some with peoples and creatures of their own, lie across that void, or even on other planes of existence. Beyond even this, consider all the endeavors that have expanded the normal even further. Consider the fields of alchemy and the burgeoning craft of clockwork engineering. Consider the magic that we have split into schools, the meticulous cataloging of its sources that we have uncovered and explored. This is all within the boundaries of the normal. </p> 
                    <p>I apologize for being long-winded; I wanted to provide enough description to, hopefully, plant in you the same question that drives each of us, that defines our work, that first brought me, far too many years ago, to the Dark Archive’s doorstep: what could there possibly be left to find? </p> 
                    <p>This is what we mean by “paranormal.” Though some might recoil in fear from such unknowns, my hope is that they excite you. In these casefiles, I’ve done my best to compile every lead we collected in the course of our efforts to part the strands of the unknown that keep us from uncovering the truth as we gaze into the darkness.”</p>

                     <p>“Only the Desperate and the Brave.” So reads the proud motto of the town of Falcon’s Hollow, for here on the fringes of Andoran, in the shadow of the looming volcano known as Droskar’s Crag, the dim, mist-laden forests are prowled by feral beasts, ravenous monsters, and the restless souls of the dead. Once, a great dwarven kingdom brought safety and stability to the region, but that all ended with the wakening of Droskar’s Crag during the apocalypse known today as the Rending. For too long did sibilant whispers ride the vale winds after nightfall in the aftermath of this disaster, and during those desperate years, evil took root in the hidden places deep below. Today, the land has recovered from the volcanic eruption, and as is humanity’s wont, settlers have returned to the region. “Only the Desperate and the Brave” came to build Falcon’s Hollow, and time has appeared to reward that desperation and bravery, for now their home feels relatively safe and secure.</p> 
                     <p>This is all a lie, for what awaits the people of Falcon’s Hollow deep below might well be doom adorned with a bloodstained crown.”</p>

                    <blockquote> 
                     <p>“The undead-populated nation of Geb is the principal food exporter to many nations throughout the Inner Sea. Few foreigners hold the undead nation or its melancholic ghost king with anything other than distaste, but they’ve come to rely on Geb’s cheap, zombie-raised food. That reliance puts these nations at a significant risk when the ghost king’s scheming right-hand vampire looks to sacrifice thousands for his personal power. </p> 
                     <p>Geb, the infamous necromancer, founded the nation millennia ago. After his earth-scorching war with the archmage Nex ground to a halt, Geb found no passion for ruling and no meaning without his rivalry, so he ended his life, but arose as a ghost. No more interested in rulership as a ghost than he had as a living man, Geb mostly retreated from public view and entrusted control of the country to his 60 apprentices, the Blood Lords. </p> 
                     <p>The Blood Lords swiftly secured an iron grip on the nation. They leveraged Geb’s rival economic factions to cement this control, playing the factions off each other and maneuvering Geb’s people and assets like pawns in a great game. Fearing old age and refusing to share power, many Blood Lords transformed themselves into undead. Some of today’s Blood Lords are the same scheming necromancers who originally served Geb while he lived.”</p>

                    <blockquote> 
                     <p>Starfinder has more than 100 unique species available for you to choose from when creating a player character. These species have appeared across hardcovers, Adventure Paths, Starfinder Society scenarios, and even the <em>Alien Character Deck</em>. With such a wide breadth of options already, this book provides more depth on 25 of those playable species—many of which were selected to appear in this book thanks to a public poll of Starfinder fans asking what species they’d like to learn more about. </p> 
                     <p><b>A NOTE ON TERMS</b><br> This book uses the word “species” in place of “race” and “racial” for the purposes of building a character, playable species traits, bonus types, and similar rules elements—this change doesn’t otherwise affect the mechanics of these elements, and it applies across all Starfinder products.</p> 
                     <p><b>CLASSES </b><br> The classes chapter kicks things off with a new class: the evolutionist, a class all about transformation and augmentation, starting on page 10. The chapter continues with a bevy of new class options for the biohacker, envoy, mechanic, nanocyte, operative, precog, and soldier.</p> 
                     <p><b>SPECIES</b><br> The second chapter begins with a table of the 100+ playable species in Starfinder, complete with headshot, short description, and reference. Whether you’re making a new player character, throwing together an NPC on the spot, or just curious about what Starfinder has to offer, this reference will inspire.</p> 
                     <p><b>Species Builder</b><br> If you’ve scoured the stars for the perfect species but nothing is quite the right fit for your ideal Starfinder character, why not make your own? Using a series of simple, nonlinear steps, you can create your own playable species for Starfinder, complete with mechanics, physiology, and backstory. Whether you want to recreate a species from your favorite fiction or invent something entirely new, this system has you covered!</p> 
                     <p><b>Species Profiles</b><br> Along with the rules needed to play them, each of the 25 species profiles in this book contains new art, a physical description, details about that species’ home world and society, and a deep dive on something that makes them unique. You’ll even learn naming conventions and sample names for that species! Each species profile also offers a selection of player options—everything from feats to spells to equipment—that are thematically tied to that species, but generally not mechanically tied, so they’re available to a wide array of characters.</p> 
                     <p><b>NPC GALLERY</b><br> One hundred NPCs of expansive variety await you in chapter 3, ranging from CR 1/2 to CR 20, and each with its own niche. You can drop these into your games from whole cloth or make a few simple adjustments to better fit your campaign; advice is included for how to do just that in the chapter introduction on page 150.</p> 
                     <p><b>INDEX</b><br> If you want to jump straight to the player options for your character, check out the index on page 188, which includes categories of the various player character options that appear throughout this book. </p> 
                     <p><b>EVOLUTIONIST INFORMATION</b><br> The following two sections of this introduction provide information for applying an archetype to an evolutionist player character or applying an evolutionist class graft to an NPC.“</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, Pathfinders! As the beginning of the Year of Boundless Wonder approaches in August, we wanted to let you know about the changes coming to the Pathfinder Society program. Aside from the updates in this blog, we don’t have any other rule changes or alterations to the program planned; this year should be quieter on that front, rather than the radical changes we’ve had in previous years.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6ef4bd9f-ec0c-42f7-9512-dd0b9a9f5047/PFS_ChaliceOnly_Final_NicholasPhillips.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/6ef4bd9f-ec0c-42f7-9512-dd0b9a9f5047/PFS_ChaliceOnly_Final_NicholasPhillips.png" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A silvery chalice decorated with filigree and blue gems.

                   <br> 
                   <h2>Achievement Points</h2> 
                   <p>We’re aware that achievement points and GM credits are still not being awarded correctly (or at all, in most cases). Tech is aware of the problem and is currently reviewing the code to fix this issue. Once it’s fixed, you won’t have to do anything but refresh your points to fix the errors. Achievement Points can still be spent currently. We hope to have good news on this front very soon!</p> 
                   <p>At the end of May, we also announced that we would be awarding every player a starting player grant of <b>80 Achievement Points</b> for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society. You may use these points to unlock an uncommon ancestry, other fun uncommon options, or just as a cushion for a couple of resurrections should your low-level character meet with an untimely critical hit. The aforementioned issues with Achievement Points are also blocking this grant for a small number of users, but that should be fixed shortly as well.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Ancestry Boon Changes</h2> 
                   <p>With the start of Year 4 comes new adventurers! We’re pleased to announce some updates to the price of ancestry boons based on the Society’s adventurers.</p> 
                   <p>As a result of the Society’s efforts on the Shadow Plane this season, the <b>Fetchling Ancestry</b> boon price will be reduced to <b>40 Achievement Points</b>. Additionally, additional recruitment in Oprak means that the <b>Hobgoblin Ancestry</b> boon price will be reduced to <b>80 Achievement Points</b>. Finally, the price of the <b>Catfolk Ancestry</b> boon will also be reduced to <b>80 Achievement Points</b>. We don’t have a great in-story reason for this last adjustment, but we wanted to bring this boon in line with similar uncommon ancestries from the Mwangi Expanse.</p> 
                   <p>All of these changes will take effect on <b>July 29, 2022</b>, in preparation for the launch of Pathfinder Society Year 4 at Gen Con the following week.</p> 
                   <p>With that, I’ll turn it over to Mike to talk about some new boons coming to the boon store!</p> 
                   <hr style="margin: 15px auto;"> 
                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders! Thinking of making a new character? Want to tie your character to recent events in Pathfinder Society adventures? We’ve got seven new backgrounds, each of which reflects some sort of connection to recent and ongoing Pathfinder Society plots. You don’t need to play a specific adventure to earn the backgrounds—they’re open to everyone, for the price of 4 Achievement Points each. Maybe you’ll want to pick up one of these backgrounds because you enjoyed a Year 3 plot and want to have a character tied to that plot, or because you’re about to play some Year 3 content and want to give your character an even stronger connection to that content before playing it. Or maybe you just think it sounds cool!</p> 
                   <p>You’ll find the text of these boons behind the spoiler tags below. (They don’t contain heavy spoilers for the events of any adventures.) Enjoy!</p>

                   <p>Pathfinders stationed at the Grand Lodge have been experiencing strange shared dreams. The dreams reveal a mysterious island surrounded by dust and shadows. In the dreams, someone is trapped. They’re calling for help. And someone—or something—doesn’t want them to leave.</p> 
                   <p><em>Dreams of a Dustbound Isle</em> is part of the ongoing Absalom metaplot arc in the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It is the third of four scenarios in the arc, which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</em></a>. The arc will conclude with <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-19: Mean Streets of Shadow Absalom</em> (Levels 7–10; July 2022). While playing the scenarios in order enhances the narrative of this four-part story arc, it is not required. <br> </p>

                   <p>In the aftermath of the Drift Crash, the Starfinder Society dispatches their flagship, <em>Master of Stars</em>, to trawl the distant corners of Pact Worlds space for signs of stranded people, derelict starships, and dangerous planar matter ejected from the Drift. When a starship familiar to the Society, the Triunite vessel the <em>Chronicler</em>, is discovered immobile and powerless, Fitch sends a team of Starfinders to investigate. But this routine rescue mission will lead them far beyond the corridors of the <em>Chronicler</em>, to an annexed Drift beacon and the metaphorical doorstep of the mysterious "4th."</p> 
                   <p>This scenario is one of four stand-alone Starfinder Society Scenarios directly tied to the <a href="http://driftcrisis.com/">Drift Crisis</a>, a galaxy-wide catastrophe detailed in <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em>. While basic knowledge of the Drift Crisis enriches the experience of this adventure, it is not required. The Starfinder Society Drift Crisis Scenarios include: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c83"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario Special #4-99: A Time of Crisis</em></a>, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-04: Fragment of the 4th</em>, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-07: Planar Bloom</em>, and <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-14</em>.</p>

                   <p>Hi Starfinders! My name is Dennis Muldoon. In addition to being a freelance author, I'm also an avid Starfinder player, GM, and organized play Venture-Captain in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was very excited to contribute to this book, writing the Blazing Speeds adventure seed, as well as the ChiwaTech faction and volocoth devils. For more Drift Crisis-related content from me, check out the new Starfinder Society interactive special, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c83?Starfinder-Society-Special-499-A-Time-of-Crisis">SFS #4-99 A Time of Crisis</a>.</p>

                   <h3>Sen.H.H.S.</h3> 
                   <p>Hi all, Sen.H.H.S. here! You may have seen my name around some Pathfinder products such as Bestiary 3 and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>. I was also in Starfinder's <em>Galactic Magic</em>, and am delighted to be back to join the chaos that is Drift Crisis, where I wrote about the Drift before everything went sideways. You can follow me on Twitter @SenHHS to keep track of what I'm up to, though I think the disruption to the Drift has disrupted my tweets somewhat. So! You can look forward to more of my work in the upcoming <em>[static]</em> and <em>[white noise]</em> which is going to be released in <em>[more static]</em> hello is this thing on <em>[all static and endless white noise]</em></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                   <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I wrote the Pahtran Independence section as well as the Hymothoa.</p> 
                   <p>In my day job, I’m a history teacher and historian, and as part of that I’ve spent a lot of years teaching decolonization and the end of the European imperial system to students. So when I wrote up the Pahtran bid for independence, the examples of decolonization were very much on my mind—especially the multi-cornered disaster that was the Congo Crisis, but to a lesser extent also Algeria and Vietnam. Decolonization is a big, messy, complicated subject—too big to treat seriously in either this post or the 2-page Pahtran Independence section, but I do hope that I’ve managed to capture at least a little of that messiness in a gameable format.</p> 
                   <p>If you enjoyed reading about the Pahtran political crisis, I’m also the creative director of the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler setting currently working on fulfilling our second Kickstarter. If you like the idea of your PC becoming a senator while fighting thousand-year-old glasswrought engines, please follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a> or check out our published products at h<a href="ttps://luminant-age.itch.io">ttps://luminant-age.itch.io</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Alison Cybe</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Alison Cybe, and I created the themes for Drift Crisis! It was a blast; themes are super fun elements which can do a lot to enhance your character. I know that when a player is starting out, they choose their theme based on which stat benefit they gain, but they also come with extra abilities as you level up. I like to surprise players with those; make each one quite unique to that theme! Each time I make one, I try to combine a selection of upgrades which are both fun and create a character unlike anything else!</p> 
                   <p>Drift Crisis is a lore event. There’s a school of thinking in game development which teaches that heavy lore is something to be avoided; that it gatekeeps casual players from the game. I don’t believe that. Players love lore. A good, deep sense of history to the cosmos, with a large number of groups pursuing their own goals and agendas, it all creates the sense of a living and breathing world. Drift Crisis contains so much for players, outside of the options; it provides a means to look at the cosmos anew.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>James Rodehaver</h3> 
                   <p>Hey everyone, I’m Jim, James, Evil Jimjam—it all means me. I had the honor of contributing to <em>The Drift Crisis</em> with the Trifold Legionnaire adventure seed. I was inspired to explore a conflict where the antagonist was so focused on a goal that they became a force of destruction. I wanted to highlight the theme that the impact of someone’s decisions, even without malicious intent, can put them on the wrong side of conflict. I also added Sovereign Trinity to the NPC rolodex. The story of some power-hungry figure with a messiah complex attempting to elevate themselves to godhood is a classic and the Drift Crisis felt like the perfect opportunity for someone to try that with Triune.</p> 
                   <p>In addition to contributing to the <em>Drift Crisis</em> book, I am going to appear in the Drift Crisis actual play stream on Paizo’s official twitch channel. More details are coming soon, but I’m excited to play alongside some amazing pro streamers and one of Paizo’s own is going to be in the GM seat!</p>

                   <h3>John Curtin</h3> 
                   <p>Hi Paizo, I’m John Curtin! You may know me from such internettings as Starfinder Facts on Twitter or Bearly Factual Productions on Patreon. While I’m normally full of the absurd and wacky on social media, in Drift Crisis I tackled the very serious topics of Near Space’s troubles in the Crisis, and maybe the most solemn subject of all: loot. While you’re enjoying the Treasure Tables in the back, be careful near the artifacts; some of them can get pretty nasty. Fun fact: The Leng Luminary was inspired by a lantern from my wedding to my partner! Hope you enjoy Drift Crisis as much as I plan to, and can't wait to talk more about what I have coming up in Interstellar Species!</p>

                   <p>Hi, everyone! I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I did the Cracks in the Cosmos adventure seeds/spells, the riftstalker (which got some extremely cool Princess-Mononoke-vibes art), Shaizera of Radiant, and everyone's favorite unethical highly acclaimed media mogul, Zo! I think the Drift Crisis provides a good opportunity for some cool, unusual adventures, and I had a lot of fun being a part of it (and throwing in First World shenanigans). If you end up playing Cracks in the Cosmos as a full campaign, I'd love to hear how it goes!

                   <p>Hi, I’m Jessica Catalan! I’m the current Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily writes for Pathfinder and Starfinder. I contributed a lot to Starfinder Drift Crisis, including the 'Drift in Crisis’ article, The Vast, factions (Eyeswide Agency, Hellknights, Tetrad), class options (mystic, technomancer, vanguard), stat blocks (gravity, vorclash, Drift Architects), and the Alluvion Fractures adventure seed. The Drift Crisis is an exciting event to be a part of and I look forward to seeing the adventures and content our community creates as a part of it!</p>

                   <h3>Rigby Bendele</h3> 
                   <p>I contributed the Moored faction, the Chaos on Absalom Station adventure seed, the drift saboteur, and Aleksana Guryari's NPC write-up for this book. When writing the Moored, I spent a lot of time looking at the way we make meaning during a crisis. I pulled on time that I spent in activist communities when thinking about the Moored. When big moments of crisis happened, these groups would often get overwhelmed by well-meaning people finally motivated to join their local orgs. However, this also meant that orgs suddenly had to go supporting 20 people to hundreds. These moments of crisis seemed like they would be a good thing, but weathering the sudden change in resources truly taxed them.</p>

Prior to academia, I founded tech startups, and served on icebreakers and law enforcement cutters in the US Coast Guard. I was a federal law enforcement officer, and one of only 200 people in the world qualified to pilot polar class icebreakers. I visited both the Arctic, and Antarctica, transited the Northwest Passage, and circumnavigated North America. For Drift Crisis, my experience in federal law enforcement and as a sailor inspired my sections on the Stewards and Free Captains factions, as well as the starship infiltrating Azlanti Stellar Scout. My current work in academia aided me in drafting the Stabilization Protocol adventure seed where you track down Drift experts from across the galaxy.</p> 
                   <p>I have three podcasts on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">Know Direction Network</a>: <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/">Intrepid Heroes</a> – a Starfinder actual play with GM Ron Lundeen and Eleanor Ferron among the players, <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/presenting/">Presenting</a> – interviews with game creators, and <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/digital-divination/">Digital Divination</a> – a show with Starfinder Development Manager Jason Keeley. Recently I started a Youtube channel for the Presenting and Digital Divination podcasts: <a href="http://gamingdivination.com/">http://gamingdivination.com</a>. </p>

                   <h3>Andrew White</h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I'm Andrew White, Paizo's front-end engineering lead and a freelance author who has written for a whole mess of Pathfinder and Starfinder projects going back to the Advanced Player's Guide. Lately, I’ve also been working closely with the folks at Foundry VTT to convert Paizo’s adventure content for virtual tabletops. My contributions to Drift Crisis were a bunch of new class options for precogs, solarians, and witchwarpers, my favorite of which is the ability to deliberately enrage eldritch beings from beyond space and time in the hopes that they’ll eat your enemies before they eat you. Have fun with that one!</p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to see more of my work, I also recently released the Danger Dossier on Starfinder Infinite, which addresses Starfinder’s only major flaw by adding froghemoths to it; I’m a contributing author to a bunch of exciting announced and unannounced upcoming Paizo projects, including one of the Drift Crisis Case Files, and I can occasionally be found retweeting stuff written by better writers at <a href="https://twitter.com/plaguecontrol">@plaguecontrol</a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Kate Baker</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Kate Baker, frequent contributor to Starfinder and Pathfinder products, and I was delighted to get to work on Drift Crisis. This book is such a fun shakeup of the setting, and I know everyone who plays the game will find some great ideas for implementing this storyline. I particularly enjoyed getting to write the Swarm adventure seed. </p> 
                   <p>You can follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/KateBakerGM">@KateBakerGM</a> on Twitter to find out more about what I’m up to!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Thaleon was born in the deserts of Rahadoum, in a time before the sands had come to claim Manaket.</p> 
                   <p>A member of the nomadic vourinoi, the elves of the desert, Thaleon was born from two worlds: one parent a woman from the forested elven homeland of Kyonin, the other a kala-shei elf who had always called the dunes their home. As a child, Thaleon traveled from oasis to oasis, learning to appreciate the beauty of the passing landscapes. He was taught to navigate by the stars and find safe water, when to travel, and when to hide from the sun, but most of all, he was taught of an ideal almost too abstract for his young mind to grasp—the quest for a moment of clarity his people called the Brightness. Each described it differently—the windsinger spoke of it as a pure note before dawn, the cook said it felt like the first taste of a family meal—but their anecdotes had one thing in common: to find his Brightness, Thaleon would need to wander the world and make his own path.</p> 
                   <p>While Thaleon was still a child, the vourinoi ventured to the coastal city of Manaket, known for its lush gardens and academic learning, to relay a warning. Through their wanderings, they had studied the subtler patterns of climate and weather playing out over decades and centuries, more noticeable over their elven lifespans. In these patterns, they’d seen a rapid spread of desertification in Rahadoum, with long-verdant shelters now exposed to the desert’s wrath. Working together over several years, the vourinoi and various Manaketi scholars predicted a great storm of dust and sand would envelop the city, choking the sky and devastating crops. Yet government officials wouldn’t take their warnings seriously; they were too focused on shorter-term priorities to risk their popularity by proposing expensive measures to prevent some potential future disaster.</p> 
                   <p>While his parents researched, Thaleon was thrilled to explore a new place filled with wildly different peoples, though he chafed under Manaket’s rigid structure. Why should such a trifling thing as a property line tell him he couldn't perch on a roof to enjoy the starlight? Why would one leave an object in a common area if they didn't mean for anyone to pick it up? Why would one hold an interesting conversation in a public place if they wanted it to remain private? The boy was ever inquisitive and prone to getting swept up in the moods of those around him, taking part in their enthusiasm and wonder, as well as their frustration and pain.</p>

                   </table> 
                   <p>Thaleon’s teachers were quick to label him a problem child due to his tendency to break rules and encourage classmates to do the same, as well as for the strange incidents that regularly happened around him. Confiscated toys hovered back to his fingers as soon as a teacher’s back was turned. Distracting sounds would fill the room during boring lessons. While unfamiliar to Thaleon’s vourinoi family, his Rahadoumi teachers were well acquainted with psychic power, given the country’s tradition of magic that sprung from mortal will. Though his instructors thought it best to place Thaleon in a strict, isolated program to discipline his mind and powers, Thaleon’s parents realized the boy was too free-spirited to flourish in a regimented Rahadoumi classroom. Instead, they set challenges for their son to channel his energy. Find the fastest way from the city gate to the fountain. Detail the journey of a fish from egg to stewpot. Lure a scorpion into a trap without getting stung. Capture a mirage in bluest ink. This last challenge sung the most to Thaleon’s heart, and the boy quickly took up painting, his portraits filled with vibrant colors and complex expressions that always managed to capture a subject’s deeper feelings, even ones they had only hinted at aloud.</p> 
                   <p>One sunset, while Thaleon was putting the finishing touches on a portrait of a fruit seller, he felt oddly tense, his brush quavering in his hand. As tension deepened into apprehension, then fear, he realized the emotion wasn’t his own. The people in the marketplace turned eastward, staring at an unfamiliar cloud on the horizon, one that rushed toward them with unnerving speed. Street dogs howled and birds fell silent. Thaleon knew instantly what it was. The long-predicted storm, come at last.</p> 
                   <p>Drawing a scarf over his mouth, he tried to direct the crowd to safety, but his voice couldn’t rise above the panic, a thousand scrawls of stark white closing in from every direction. The desire to protect the crowd grew in Thaleon’s mind until it finally spilled forth, unleashing itself in a flash of color. For the first time, Thaleon painted with his mind instead of his brush, and soothing lights flickered into existence, drawing attention away from the storm for a few critical moments. In the momentary calm, Thaleon’s voice had a chance to carry as he directed the market indoors and underground.</p> 
                   <p>To Thaleon’s relief, the crowd took shelter, yet the merchant he’d been painting remained frozen in place as the storm approached. The canopy of his stall snapped, sending a heavy beam of wood straight for his head. In that moment, Thaleon felt only one emotion: the desire to protect his friend. As he dashed to the merchant’s side, colors wove together into a dome of telekinetic force, covering them both. The debris crashed against it just as the storm descended. Sand and wind raged, but the barrier held, and in the swirling reds, blues, and yellows, for the briefest second, Thaleon glimpsed a color he’d never seen before, one he couldn’t describe… but he knew it was bright.</p> 
                   <p>On that day, Thaleon’s power became more than a source of entertainment and whimsy. It became a way for him to make the world a better place. A century has passed since the day Manaket’s gardens withered in the sandstorm, but the spark of Thaleon’s curiosity and his desire to help others hasn’t diminished. Like his parents before him, Thaleon left home to wander the world in search of his Brightness, determined to make his own path.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders! We have two Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenarios for you this month! Let’s dive in.</p> 
                   <p>Time to wrap up the “Oppara” metaplot arc, which began with <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason</em> and concludes this month with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-316-Escape-from-Oppara"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-16: Escape from Oppara</em></a>. After asking for the Society’s help to investigate the suspicious actions of Venture-Captain Muesello, Gloriana Morilla has once again called upon a group of agents to confront the Society’s hidden enemies in Oppara. For the plan to work, the agents must infiltrate the hideout of an insidious group of insurgents who have been plotting against the crown. Can the agents set things right? What else might they discover as they peel back the layers of the conspiracy? This metaplot adventure by Brent Bowser is for 3rd through 6th level characters.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Meanwhile, Pathfinders at the Grand Lodge have had troubling dreams of late. Stranger still, while each Pathfinder’s dream is slightly different, they share many elements, as if they contain some sort of hidden message. The Society’s leaders believe the dreams to be a cry for help from someone trapped in a dangerous, otherworldly dream realm, and it’s up to a group of capable agents to enter the dream and learn the truth! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d5f?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-317-Dreams-of-a-Dustbound-Isle"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-17: Dreams of a Dustbound Isle</em></a> is an adventure for 7th through 10th level characters written by Matt Duval. It includes faction missions for the Radiant Oath and Verdant Wheel factions. As part of the four-part “Absalom” metaplot arc for Year 3, this adventure follows on the events of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Shattered-Sanctuaries"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</em></a>. The arc concludes with the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-319-Mean-Streets-of-Shadow-Absalom"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-19: Mean Streets of Shadow Absalom</em></a>.</p>

Last year we attended all four of our planned conventions and started off this year being able to join everyone at PaizoCon.

We loved seeing everyone proudly wearing their gaymer and ally badge ribbons and appreciated everyone visiting our table.</p> 
                   <p>We're proud of a lot of other things too! In the past few months... We've gone from a team of 4 overwhelmed directors to a booming team of 16 officers! Having all the fresh souls on board has revitalized the organization and we've already started on some great new things:</p> 
                   <p>We are revved for Origins next week to have our own booth in the exhibit hall. We are going to have our own "Gayme Room" at Gen Con this year with nearly 100 events already planned. We launched and debuted our "Pride Flag Badge Ribbons" at PaizoCon. We have got some sweet new enamel pins and other pride swag coming out in the next few months. Our Discord server finally hit the 500-user threshold. Our new Twitch channel is picking up rapidly. And we're on the verge of launching a safe-space program for friendly local game stores.</p> 
                   <p>Last but certainly not least, we are not proud but grateful and humbled to have Paizo select Tabletop Gaymers as one of the beneficiaries of their "Pathfinder Second Edition Beginners Bundle" alongside <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org">The Trevor Project</a>.</p> 
                   <p>If you want to know more about Tabletop Gaymers, possibly get involved and join the team, visit our website at TabletopGaymers.org or get in touch at contact@TabletopGaymers.org. We would love to hear from you.</p> 
                   <p>Happy Pride Month!</p>

                   <h3>First Time at PaizoCon 2022</h3> 
                   <p>This Memorial Day weekend, I had the opportunity to volunteer at <b>PaizoCon 2022</b> for <b>Tabletop Gaymers</b>. I joined as an officer in the beginning of the year because I believed in the non-profit’s goal of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion by championing the visibility and recognition of the LGBTQIA+ community through tabletop gaming. Paizo has been an active supporter of Tabletop Gaymers and asked us if we’d like to come and run a table in the vendor area of the convention in Seattle. </p> 
                   <p>I had never been to an RPG convention before and honestly felt somewhat lost in many conversations involving Pathfinder and Starfinder. As a board game designer, I sadly have only dipped my toes into the water of RPGs. Due to most RPGs needing a larger time commitment and a group being available to consistently meet up, this just hasn’t been an area of the gaming world I’ve had a chance to explore. But after coming to this Con and seeing the excitement the attendees felt, I am remotivated to try and play! </p> 
                   <p>According to Carrie, an amazing volunteer we had, this year's convention was significantly smaller than previous years thanks to covid. There were times when we just hung out at the table and chatted or talked to the Paizo employees. Other times we had people coming up to the booth to ask for our rainbow “gaymer” and “ally” ribbons as well as our neon green pronoun ribbons. The amount of “thank you’s” I heard from attendees filled my heart. It was amazing to see how many people donated and shared their stories of realizing they were a gaymer or of having a friend that was. </p> 
                   <p>Over the past few years, I’ve become aware of how important RPGs are in helping people explore their traumas, sexualities, and sexual orientations. Roleplaying in a safe space allows players to create characters that are as similar or different as they please. You can try on a new pronoun as your character. Using Roll20 and other online sites players can add their character names and pronouns to their signature. This helps remind players during the game, similar to how our pronoun ribbons at conventions can help attendees appropriately identify themselves. </p> 
                   <p>While talking to attendees, I heard stories about men creating female characters to allow them to help express their more feminine side. Their characters charged into battle in a new outfit every time, screaming things like “if I can wear this, you can too!”—promoting the body positivity of the cow people. But also, I learned about the darker side of the online RPG space with people propositioning players to go into different chat rooms to do questionable things in exchange for valuables used in their games. One man I met told me that people assumed he was a girl like the character he had created, but because his voice function wasn’t working on his computer, he was unable to prove that he was a male behind the mic. He experienced harassment and propositions until he finally was able to get his audio working on his computer to prove his gender. The experience was eye opening to him and made him feel for all the females that want to enter the RPG space. </p> 
                   <p>As a girl, I have felt uncomfortable at times in new spaces, but I can say that this convention was incredibly welcoming to gaymers and newbies to RPGs. Attendees were more than delighted to answer my questions about how they create their characters, choose their campaigns, and build their groups. One other vendor explained to me that RPGs are on the rise and they are experiencing a shortage of Dungeon and Game Masters to the point of it becoming a paid gig at some of his local game stores. One Paizo employee said the first game of Pathfinder he ever played he GMed. He started too ambitious with a group of 12 then broke them off into two smaller groups, and by the end of the year, when both campaigns ended, he felt like he could conquer any challenge! I am doing something similar by jumping into my first D&amp;D campaign in celebration of Pride month with a three-episode live-stream hosted by WIGI (Women in Games International) Tuesday nights starting June 14th.</p> 
                   <p>It was amazing to have such detailed conversations with strangers. Most were self-proclaimed introverts, but when they were with their people, they blossomed into conversations about all things Paizo and beyond. It was also really cool to see people’s excitement in Tabletop Gaymer’s new Pride Flag ribbons. Attendees donated to collect ribbons that they felt described them. The ribbons also caused interesting conversations of which ribbons were collected the most. The answer was asexual, nonbinary, trans, and bi were a 4-way tie, with others closely behind. I also had many people proclaim they were still figuring it out. Which I get. I wear the “lesbian” ribbon but I don’t think anyone is 100% anything. So sometimes I still struggle with choosing the appropriate label for myself. In person I typically stick to the term “gay” until further pressed. Then I use “lesbian”. But at gaming conventions, thanks to organizations like Tabletop Gaymers, I feel more comfortable wearing these fun, colorful ribbons. </p> 
                   <p>I did have someone come up to the booth and ask about the ribbons. After recognizing he wasn’t a gaymer, I offered him an ally ribbon. In response, I was given a speech on how he didn’t feel comfortable labeling himself an ally. That it felt fake in a way. I’ve heard this argument before and do understand that “ally” is a term that should be given. But as a gay girl I can say that seeing those ally ribbons on people makes me feel safe, supported and more comfortable in a space with people I don’t know. I’m an extrovert but I still feel intimidated at times wanting to sit down at a table of men. Seeing that rainbow ribbon really does ease the tension, similar to when I see pride flags outside of different shops. It makes me know that it is a safe and welcoming space. We all need a safe space, and that’s what our organization works to do at conventions. I am so thankful for Paizo promoting us and allowing us a chance to share our message with the attendees of PaizoCon! </p> 
                   <p>Also, I did get a chance to play one game while I was here, and that was the Steve Jackson and Pazio crossover game “Pathfinder Revolution,” the board game. I got to play the first game outside of development and it was great! It’s officially added to my must-buy list. We played the 4-player game but the game scales higher. I’m not sure how that goes, since the rules change, but for the game I played, I really enjoyed the refresh on an old Steve Jackson game. Apparently, this game was a surprise even for many of the Paizo employees that saw the game appear in the glass case.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re a fan of Pathfinder and Starfinder I highly recommend checking out this very friendly small convention hosted by Paizo in Seattle. This may not have been as large as GenCon, but the stories attendees shared about how these games helped them learn about themselves was amazing. I especially liked that Paizo updated their starter characters to include lesbian characters; that honestly motivated me more to learn more about the system and world. I would 100% attend again. So, thank you Paizo for having us! And for anyone looking to find our ribbons, you can find us at Origins, GenCon, DragonCon, and PAX Unplugged this year! Plus, our online store stocks up on all things rainbow, so check it out and donate to a great cause that helps gaymers like me feel safe and excited to be in this amazing community!</p> 
                   <p>I look forward to meeting more amazing people at future conventions!</p> 
                   <p>Happy Pride Month!</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/DriftCrashers_PlayersGuide.pdf">Let’s get ready by exploring the <em>Starfinder Drift Crashers Players Guide</em>!</a></h3>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aos?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-46-The-Perfect-Storm"><em>The Perfect Storm</em></a> is coming to launch the 3-volume Drift Crashers Adventure Path. Drift Crashers is part of the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/driftcrisis">Drift Crisis</a>, an event taking place across the entire Starfinder game line, in which faster-than-light travel breaks down and the galaxy is thrown into chaos! Inside the free Starfinder Drift Crashers Players Guide, you will find information about the Marata, your new home away from home—and your only one for a while. </p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/173d15b7-eeb4-42d6-96d1-4d643051b2e7/Starfinder_DriftCrashers_KeyArt_1920.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/173d15b7-eeb4-42d6-96d1-4d643051b2e7/Starfinder_DriftCrashers_KeyArt_1920.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A ship flying out of a dark gate lit up in red light floating in space"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Before your group starts to make characters, work together to choose communal backgrounds based on being prominent members of the crew, like pleasure cruisers, reunited family, scientific researchers, or traveling entertainers. </p> 
                   <p>Then flesh out the crew. As you make your character, create and name a prominent NPC aboard the <em>Marata</em> with whom your character has a personal connection (hereafter referred to as a Key NPC). The Players Guide suggests from which you can select. Your bond with them can take any form you and your GM agree on: close pals, partners, friendly rivals, and so on. No matter what, you can depend on them. Key NPCs are also excellent opportunities for backup characters if a PC suffers an unfortunate fate.</p> 
                   <p>Now, focus on the ship. Each player can choose a custom modification to the <em>Marata.</em> They each provide different benefits and bonuses. Examples include a chapel, exercise stations, a manufacturer-grade crafting station, and a portable virtual entertainment system! </p> 
                   <p>Select the gear you might have brought with you on the trip, specialized gear you might want to craft to weather the storms ahead, and a new creature companion you might attract along the way. Consider armor upgrades like a Medical Analysis Kit, a companion like the rift remora, or a weapon like the destroyer shillelagh! </p> 
                   <p>Don’t miss the new PLANAR TRAVELER theme!</p>

                   <p>Whether you are or aren’t a native of the Material Plane, it certainly holds little sway over you. Why go to the vidgame arcade when you could sample the endless delights of Elysium? Why settle your disputes at the local courthouse when you could get the opinion of the perfect arbiters of Axis? Why simply kill your enemies when you could annihilate their souls with the help of Abaddon? Regardless of your tendencies, focus (or lack of focus) on particular planes, or motivation for traveling, your knowledge of realities beyond your own is unmatched. </p> 
                   <p>Be sure to read wisdom and guidance about the journey ahead. You aren’t experienced, battle-hardened warriors—at least, you aren’t yet. Don’t be afraid to be afraid!</p>

                   <p>When a stuffy noblewoman decides leshys make for pretty centerpieces for her fancy tea party, she has no idea what sort of trouble she’s stirring up. Not every plant in the forest wants to be put on display and some of them are more than well-equipped to fight for those who are plucked from their homes!</p> 
                   <p>In <em>A Fistful of Flowers</em>, you take on the role of one of four unique leshys—plants who have been granted sapience and wills of their own. When new sproutlings are snatched out of the woods and taken away to civilization, it’s up to your band of furious flowers and pugilistic plants to set things right!</p> 
                   <p><em>A Fistful of Flowers</em> is a short adventure for 3rd-level characters that takes a band of leshy heroes out of the forest and into the most dangerous of locations—an aristocrat’s fancy tea party. In addition, the four pregenerated characters provide a quick way to jump into the adventure right away in this exciting offering for Free RPG Day! Grab some dice and friends and play the role of the forest’s newest heroes!</p>

                   <p>In addition to a rollicking adventure, this book includes four pregenerated characters that are ready to play, with full stat blocks and backstories. The inside front cover includes all the maps needed for this adventure.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Late last year, in my new role as the creative lead for Pathfinder Society Organized Play, I sat down to plan the plots and themes for Year 4. One of my first experiences on the Organized Play team back in January 2021 was to sit in on the pitch meeting for Pathfinder Society Year 3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It was thrilling to see what Thursty had planned for the year, and I couldn’t wait to see how it turned out.</p> 
                   <p>A few months later, I learned that “how it turned out” was going to be my job! I knew that I wanted Year 3’s plot to lead naturally to Year 4, and that Year 4 should continue to solidify the role of the Pathfinder Society in Golarion. I also knew that I wanted Year 4 to “feel” different from the seasons that had come before. So, what to do?</p> 
                   <p>At some point—I can’t quite remember when—I began to think of each “season” of Pathfinder Society as one of the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. (Living in the Pacific Northwest, I might describe our seasons as “wet,” “more wet,” “spiders,” and “wildfires,” but I digress.) Perhaps it was the fact that I am often introspective as fall turns to winter (when I happened to be brainstorming the Year 4 themes), or perhaps it was the simple fact that we’ve often described a year’s worth of content as a “season” of Organized Play. Whatever the reason, it was easy to decide which seasons corresponded with the three current seasons of Pathfinder Society.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bf86373b-579d-4bed-881b-5e8e97b6364d/YearoftheOpenRoad_Logo.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bf86373b-579d-4bed-881b-5e8e97b6364d/YearoftheOpenRoad_Logo.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Year of the Open Road"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>The Year of the Open Road was spring. It was a season of new beginnings, new relationships, allies, and adventures. Doors (and magical mazes) opening up to exciting places. A fresh start. A new edition! Brand new characters! </p> 
                   <p>That meant Year of Corruption’s Reach was summer, a season of grand adventure, epic tales, and exploration of the distant land of Iobaria. There were several transitions on the Pathfinder Society development team during this time—quite appropriate for the transition to our current plot, the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e57bccf0-e9e2-4591-b065-9c1e06569d66/PFSCorruptionsReach_1500.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e57bccf0-e9e2-4591-b065-9c1e06569d66/PFSCorruptionsReach_1500.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Year of Corruption's Reach"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>To me, this season represents autumn, a season of change, reflection on the past, and preparation for the future. Appropriately, during the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries, the Pathfinder Society’s past looms large. We saw the campaign’s focus shift to the Inner Sea lodges of years past. In a way, the Society has spent Year 3 hunkering down, cleaning house, reflecting on the past, and preparing to deal with whoever has been behind all of the problems arising at these Inner Sea lodges.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ce22669-6db3-4db3-861e-454d71b30330/YearofShatteredSanctuaries_Title.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ce22669-6db3-4db3-861e-454d71b30330/YearofShatteredSanctuaries_Title.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Year of Shattered Sanctuaries"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>So, I knew Year 4 needed to be winter. Often, winter represents sorrowful things. Loss. Isolation. Despair. Darkness. For a long time, I considered taking the campaign in a grim direction in Year 4. However, for many reasons, I decided that a year of darkness and despair is not what the campaign needs at this time. </p> 
                   <p>Winter is dark, but it is also a season which many people endure with light, hope, comradery, and gifts. And so the Year of Boundless Wonder came to be.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Yes, there is a powerful evil enemy who has been lurking behind the scenes and causing problems throughout the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. Yes, her identity will soon be revealed. Yes, she has a major part to play in the Year of Boundless Wonder. But, in the face of such wickedness, the Pathfinder Society won’t fall to despair. It won’t dwell on the darkness. It will continue to walk new roads, fight against corruption, bolster its sanctuaries, and see the world’s wonders.</p> 
                   <p>The whole team has worked hard to ensure this next year of Pathfinder Society brings wonder and excitement to new players and veterans alike. I can’t wait for you to experience the adventures for yourself!</p> 
                   <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! Wonder abounds!</p>

The thing I'm most proud of this year is finally allowing myself to be proud of what I've accomplished and endured.

                   <p>Hello, I’m Alexander Augunas (Asexual/Biromantic/Male)! I’m Know Direction’s Everyman Gamer and the Master of Ceremonies of Know Direction Beyond, as well as the publisher of Everybody Games. I also write for Paizo and Pathfinder 2E / Starfinder when I’m not working my day job. This year, I’m proud of the work that my team and I did on Kitsune of Golarion, a Pathfinder Infinite product that details kitsune ethnic groups from across Golarion. I’m also thrilled that my first Adventure Path volume, <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #51: Into the Dataverse</em>, was announced a few weeks ago at PaizoCon. Finally, I’m proud to be celebrating my first Pride as biromantic and of my new partner, who’s been amazingly patient with me as he and I work to figure out my feelings. If you are questioning or ever start to question yourself, please give yourself the time and kindness to figure it out in whatever capacity you need. Sometimes the answer is simply acknowledging the feelings you had at the start, and that can be scary. Take a step back. Breath. It’s okay. We’ve all been there, and many of us still are. You’ve got this</p>

                   <p>Community is what will save us, and I've seen my community come together over the past several years. Whether it's been mutual aid programs, labor solidarity, or activist communities, I've seen those around me step up and mobilize to protect each other. I've also worked to be someone my community would be proud of, especially when it comes to ensuring I don’t leave vulnerable members behind.</p> 
                   <p>As I look to the future and continue to see a cycle of advances in rights and then backlash, standing together is vital. While living under cissexist oppression has been hard and there are never any guarantees of what the future holds, it is always worthwhile to put in the effort. I owe so much to those that organize movements. I can never repay that debt; I can only try.</p> 
                   <p>I guess this is where I talk about my own work, and how much I’ve done this past year or what my upcoming releases are. If you’re interested in that, you can find my work in the recently released <em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em> and in the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Travel Guide</em>, <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Society Special #3-98: Expedition into Pallid Peril</em>.</p> 
                   <p>I also run a free newsletter about LGBTQIA+ speculative fiction (mostly sci-fi and fantasy). If you want to hear my thoughts on queer literature, you can subscribe (or read the archive) at <a href="https://transgenre-books.ghost.io/">Transgenre Reads</a>.

                   <p>This past year I’m proud to count myself among the many who’ve realized their worth. I mustered up the courage to tell my boss, “Treat me fairly, or I’m going elsewhere.” Here I am now, living my best life in a new job, recording a stand-up comedy special, my first Organized Play Scenario coming out this month (PFS: #3-16: Escape From Oppara), and an editor of The <a href="https://jod4hap.com/">Journal of Dungeoneering For Hip and Attractive Professionals</a>. From Starbucks and Amazon to every individual altering their situation, I’m proud of us collectively striving to make life better for ourselves, and each other.</p>

                   <p>Hi, my name is Carlos Cabrera and I identify as bisexual. I have written for Pathfinder in both first and second editions and have done some additional voice acting work. My latest credit to date is the voice of Ashasar for the <em>Pathfinder Society Special #3-99: Fate of the Future</em>, which played at GenCon last year!</p> 
                   <p>The thing I am proud of most in the last year is my willingness to diversify my career and follow my freelancing work wherever it takes me. Not only did I decide to start pursuing voice acting after stumbling upon it in the Seattle indie video game scene, I have two board game projects currently in the works and one has been picked up by a publisher!</p> 
                   <p>I look forward to wherever my career takes me next and should be returning to writing more content for Pathfinder soon as well.

                   <p>Hi, still James here, still gay. I worked on a lot of Paizo stuff I’m proud of this year, but instead of those, something else I’m proud of is making my first forays into professional media translation and translating some anime, including both an episode with a ton of puns and an episode that made my roommate go “wait why hasn’t that character stopped talking yet it’s been like a minute and I don’t think she’d breathed.” Between this and the RPG thing, middle school James would be proud. I also (with my stepmother’s help) figured out how to stop messing up a few recipes that had been giving me trouble this year, which I’m proud of too!

                   <p>Hi! I'm Caryn (she/they). I write marketing content as my day job, but the much cooler answer to "what do you do" is my recent experience freelancing for Paizo! I wrote Bounty 14 (The Blackwood Truce) and PFS scenario 3-10 (Delve the Pallid Depths)... and hopefully more fun things in the future. You can (sometimes) find me on Twitter talking about my work: <a href="https://twitter.com/caryndi">@caryndi</a></p> 
                   <p>My proudest moment in the past year was, in fact, seeing something with my name on it published! It was the culmination of a lot of effort I've put in over the years, and also a new opportunity to learn and grow as a writer. On a more serious and somber note, I'm also proud of the resilience and resistance of the LGBTQ+ community recently. I wish it wasn't necessary. But speaking truth to power, doing what you can to make your community better, and even just living your truth even though others are hostile to it are all accomplishments. I'm simultaneously proud to be fighting the good fight where I can and grateful/humbled to be part of a community that has given me wonderful examples of how to do so. </p>

Last year has been yet another rough year, and looking back on it all it’s difficult for me to isolate anything in particular I’m proud of myself other than just making it to this point, so instead I’ll say I’m proud of all the amazing freelancers who work for Paizo and have been so supportive of us—not just in the past year, but for the past 19 years I’ve been working at Paizo. I’ve come close to quitting the job or moving on several times—many of them in the past year—and the kind words and support of freelancers is one of the things that’s kept me here. I’m proud of you all, but more to the point I’m thankful for you all.</p>

I’m the host of <a href="http://twitch.infiknight.net/"><em>Infiknight Reviews</em></a> on Twitch, producer of Know Direction: Beyond, author of the Fox’s Cunning blog series on Know Direction, and a Venture-Lieutenant for the Pathfinder Society! I'm very proud of the successful creator space and community that developed on the <em>Infiknight Reviews</em> <a href="http://www.infiknight.net/">Discord channel</a>. And this year I’m proud of all the work I’ve done with Pathfinder &amp; Starfinder Infinite, developing my own work like <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/374966/Infiknight-Archetypes-Spell-Trickster?affiliate_id=150473"><em>Infiknight Archetypes: Spell Trickster</em></a> and writing with other incredible authors in collaborations like <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/381454/Kitsune-of-Golarion?affiliate_id=150473"><em>Kitsune of Golarion</em></a>. Of course, I’m super excited to see how people react to my work in <em>Lost Omens: Travel Guide</em>, and I’m extremely grateful for the overwhelming positive response I got for Nouru/“Tattletail” in <em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>. And, to save the best for last, I’m immensely proud of my incredible new partner whose kindness, sweetness, and endless thoughtfulness have helped me learn to love myself and open my heart to share my love with another. Over the years this blog has been such a source of inspiration, learning, and opportunity for me, and I hope I can help pay it forward by offering my fellow creatives a helping hand and safe creative space where they can be free to express and learn who they are with open minds and open hearts.

In a year full of accomplishments and personal growth, there is clearly one thing I am proud of most of all. I am proud to be a part of the freelance community that took collective action last fall to fight for Paizo staff. I remain proud that I took a stand for others and honored to be in the company of those that did the same.</p>

You might remember me from essential PF2 content like the APG’s dandy archetype, <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar’s wig of holding</em>, and the upcoming fashion section of <em>Lost Omens Travel Guide</em>. I'm one of several asexual Paizo contributors, and I couldn't be prouder of the community of talented and diverse professionals I get to work with. Paizo freelancers achieved a lot in the last year, and the collective action we took last year to improve working conditions for Paizo staff and ultimately demand recognition for the United Paizo Workers union ranks high among my proudest moments. It is my privilege to continue working alongside this incredible, kind, and fierce group of creators I get to call my peers.</p>

                   <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">Contract Editor</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hey, I'm Simone (she/they), a queer editor, writer, and general language enthusiast. Among other things, I wrote the primal magic treatise and witch journal entries for Secrets of Magic, and as a contractor I've been a contributing editor on numerous Paizo publications! I'm delighted and honored to work alongside so many phenomenal creators in this community who do such great work on the games we love.</p> 
                   <p>It's hard for me to celebrate my achievements, but after many years of freelancing on the side, I'm proud of taking the leap to self-employment and making Wildwood Editing my full-time job. I love running my own solo business and continuing to learn more about myself, my craft, my community, and how to build better worlds, both in games and in real life. If you’d like to follow along, I have a monthly newsletter about games, language, advocacy, and more that you can sign up for here: <a href="https://www.subscribepage.com/wildwoodediting">https://www.subscribepage.com/wildwoodediting</a>.</p> 
                   <p>There’s a lot to celebrate during Pride Month, but don’t forget that queer history is important, queer folks are everywhere, and we need your support all year long. (And if you’re newly exploring your identity and wondering if you’re queer enough to belong, the answer is YES. Welcome!)</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">Freelance Contributor</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hi all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, a freelancer for Pathfinder/Starfinder, and I’m bi and demisexual. Most recently, I’ve worked on Book of the Dead and Guns &amp; Gears on the Pathfinder side, and Drift Crisis and the one-shot System Takedown on the Starfinder side. This year, I’m proud of tackling two big projects back to back, which was a big challenge! One of these was <em>To Defy the Dragon</em>, a Starfinder adventure module out this fall. I had a great time working on it, and I hope people enjoy not only getting to take down a dragon tyrant from the seats of mechs, but also discovering the other things the ruins hold—some of which might tug at their heartstrings. (I’m not sure how much I can say about Project #2 yet, so…I’ll leave it at that!)</p> 
                   <p>More broadly, I’m proud of those in the Paizo community—staff, freelancers, and fans alike—who have united to push for positive change over the past year. This is a rough time for a lot of people—especially queer people—but knowing there are so many doing their best to make gaming more inclusive and welcoming gives me hope. Stay awesome, everyone.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Isabelle Thorne<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">Freelance Contributor</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hallo! I’m Isabelle Thorne, long-time Paizo contributor (most recently to <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>) and proud trans girl. ^_^</p> 
                   <p>This year is a pretty big deal for me. In addition to contributing lots of content to the aforementioned <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>, I’ve gotten started as a freelance editor for works like Queerfinder on Pathfinder Infinite, among several others, and I’m pushing myself to make editing a full-time gig. In addition, after many long years and struggles, I’m finally making an effort to leave my hometown and move somewhere more affirming and supportive, where I can have a real community and my own life. It’s going to be tough, but I’m hoping it will really pay off in the end!</p>

                   <p>Hi y’all! I’m Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher). I’m a queer/bisexual, genderfluid, disabled creator and game designer.</p> 
                   <p>My biggest point of pride in the last year is finishing my graduate degree, where among other things I studied tabletop as a form of ritual and meaning-making. Right now, I’m extremely proud of designing my first game, Front Porch. It’s a worldbuilding game about gossip and gossip’s power to create and unravel social bonds and social worlds, and it will hopefully drop in July 2022. </p> 
                   <p>I’m also the GM of Chromythica, a trans and queer-led Pathfinder 2E actual play. Our story focuses on two gnomes, a tief-elf, and a talking dog who stumble on a vast plot of Draconic intrigue and Infernal meddling, learning in the process that they’re fated to shape the destinies of dragons and the course of history. I’m immensely proud of everything we have accomplished as a trans and queer cast! Together, we imagine a story where trans and queer people not only survive, but thrive. I’m proud of us for telling the stories that we most want to encounter in this world. We’d be delighted for you to join us in our story if you’re just finding out about us!</p> 
                   <p>Finally, I’m proud to have created #tabletopaccess, a hashtag for disabled gamers to share our experiences in the tabletop community. </p> 
                   <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dungeonminister">@dungeonminister</a> (or <a href="https://twitter.com/chromythica">@chromythica</a>) and on the web at oakgrove.games, <a href="http://chromythica.com/">chromythica.com</a>, and <a href="https://hallowedbe.org/">hallowedbe.org</a>.</p>

                   <p>Grady Wang (he/him) and Theo Thourson (he/him) are life partners who cofounded and run <a href="http://youtube.com/thegallantgoblin">The Gallant Goblin</a>, a TTRPG publishing company and product review channel on YouTube. We are proud of everything we have accomplished in the last year to become a self-sustaining LGBTQ+-owned small business as well as promote queer-identifying creators in the tabletop space.</p> 
                   <p>We launched <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/384255/Queerfinder-Issue-1-Bars-of-Absalom">Queerfinder</a> on Pathfinder Infinite in January 2022 as an in-world travel magazine featuring queer-friendly stories, NPCs, locations, and plot hooks as imagined by queer creators. The magazine celebrates existing industry talents, such as Paizo contributors, as well as up-and-coming designers and artists trying to break into the industry. We're so proud of our passionate and talented team, who not only strive to elevate each other but to improve industry conditions through advocacy for wage transparency, better contracts, and higher pay. Together we're developing many more exciting stories to share with you in upcoming issues!</p> 
                   <p>We were also thrilled that our band of rainbow kobold adventurers, originally conceived as a Pride Month fundraiser for GLSEN in 2020, are making the leap into the real world as huggable plushies. After over a year of development, we launched our new <a href="https://kobold-plushies.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders">Hero Plush</a> brand on Kickstarter and are so proud it became one of the top 40 plush Kickstarters of all time!

                   <p><b>Kickstarter Fulfillment Starts Now</b><br> Archon Studio is prepared to start fulfillment operations, but Ninja Division has informed Paizo that it does not have the money to fulfill their part of the obligation of shipping Group 1 miniatures to backers. Unfortunately, this will require additional shipping to be paid by each non-EU backer that was originally scheduled to receive their miniatures directly from Ninja Division.</p> 
                   <p><b>North America and Rest of World</b>: You will receive an email from Paizo containing a voucher code that must be redeemed on paizo.com to pay for shipping and provide your current shipping address. Archon will be fulfilling Group 1 at a cost of $13 per code received to these regions.</p> 
                   <p><b>European Backers</b>: A simple survey has been created for you to easily update your current postal address. <a href="https://archon-studio.com/content/starfinder-address-confirmation"><b>Click here</b></a> to fill out the survey.</p> 
                   <p><b>What's Next?</b><br> Archon is already preparing the 7th wave of Starfinder Masterclass miniatures, and we will coordinate shipping Group 2 to backers as soon as Wave 12 is completed. </p> 
                   <p>Thanks again for backing Starfinder Masterclass Miniatures. We know this process has taken longer than planned, and we thank you for your support as we work through the remaining waves of miniatures. </p> 
                   <p>If you did not participate in the original Kickstarter, limited quantities of the miniatures will be available through paizo.com and archon-studio.com.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Paizo is pleased to announce that Maggie Gallagher and Rai Kong have been promoted to the Leadership Team. Both have also received promotions in-line with that responsibility. Rai Kong is now Vice President of Technology, and Maggie Gallagher is now Vice President of People &amp; Culture, both reporting directly to Paizo’s President.</p> 
                   <p>“I’ve worked closely with Maggie and Rai during their time here at Paizo, and I’m excited to add their expertise and vision as we lead Paizo into its third decade of gaming,” said Jim Butler, Paizo President.</p> 
                   <p>Maggie Gallagher joined Paizo in January 2022 with over 20 years of HR experience and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion expertise. She has served as an instructor, volunteer, and presenter for several LGBTQ+ organizations. Most recently, she has focused on groups and organizations that actively advocate for the rights of transgender individuals. </p> 
                   <p>“I'm excited to join the Leadership Team and to participate in the strategic direction of the company,” said Maggie Gallagher.</p> 
                   <p>Maggie can be reached at <a href="mailto:maggie.gallagher@paizo.com">maggie.gallagher@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Rai Kong started her career in web design/UX and web development in the computer gaming industry, working for both computer software companies and gaming review websites before continuing her career in other sectors. She joined Paizo in 2018, bringing extensive e-commerce, web development, and management experience from over a decade of working in technology at Nordstrom.com, where she used her skills to help lead cross-company efforts in Modernization and Agile transformation initiatives.</p> 
                   <p>She loves games of all kinds and is just as likely to be found playing board games—her current favorite is Terraforming Mars—and pinochle as she is tabletop RPGs or video games.</p> 
                   <p>"I'm pleased to participate in shaping the future of Paizo and lending my voice to meet the needs of our customers,” said Rai Kong.</p> 
                   <p>Rai can be reached at <a href="mailto:rai.kong@paizo.com">rai.kong@paizo.com</a>.</p>

                   <h2>Year of Boundless Wonder</h2> 
                   <p>At our PaizoCon panel, Pathfinder Society developer Mike Kimmel announced the title for Year 4: Year of Boundless Wonder! We’re very excited for this new metaplot, featuring a treasure hoard full of wondrous items and treacherous secrets. More information about the year’s stories, as well as any rule changes, will be forthcoming between now and the year’s launch at Gen Con Indy and Gen Con Online. For now, be sure to check out our panel on YouTube and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si20">the announcement blog</a>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Achievement Points Update</h2> 
                   <p>I have good news and bad news!</p> 
                   <p>The good news: last week, tech rolled a code update that, among other things, should start every new player with 80 Achievement Points for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society and retroactively grant those points to current players as well. One of the most consistent complaints about the program at large is that new players can’t play weird characters from the jump. This 80 AcP grant is enough to purchase an uncommon ancestry, some new character options, or just resurrect your character a couple of times after making… <em>interesting</em> choices. We hope that this will ease a new player’s introduction to the system and benefit those of you who have been working diligently to save up for something shiny as well!</p> 
                   <p>The bad news: doing so apparently broke AcP entirely in new and exciting ways. We’ve had reports of some people not seeing the grant yet, and other reports of events not awarding AcP for sessions anymore. Obviously, this is a problem, and tech is actively working on fixing it. Please know that fixing this is my highest priority, and I hope to see the issues resolved soon. Thank you all so much for your patience!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>PFS Faction Pins</h2> 
                   <p>A couple of months ago on Paizo Live!, I announced that we’d be getting new faction pins in the store for PaizoCon. Unfortunately, thanks to shipping chaos, they missed it by <em>one day</em> and arrived just after the show closed. Luckily, they’re now available in the Paizo store!</p>

                   <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/perks">Accessory Perks</a> page has had an update in the works for some time. Now that these pins have arrived, that will hopefully be the motivation I need to put the final touches on the page and get it live so that these pins provide an in-game benefit. Until then, enjoy the bling!</p>

                   <p>We’re currently recruiting GMs for Gen Con Online as well as PaizoCon Online Europe! Earlier today we posted a blog with more information on both, so for the sake of brevity here I will <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si2e?PaizoCon-Europe-and-Gen-Con-Online-Call-for">link you over there for more information</a>.</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>We released a <em>ton</em> of products, and sanctioning for other products, in May. So many that I don’t have time for fun commentary and I’m just going to list them all out!</p> 
                   <br>

                   <h3>Upcoming</h3> 
                   <p>Next on our sanctioning radar, in no particular order, are:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><em>Dark Archive</em></li> 
                    <li><em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path</em></li>

                   <br> 
                   <h2>New FAQ Answers</h2> 
                   <p>Prior to PaizoCon, we posted a couple of new answers to crafting-related questions on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">PFS FAQ page</a>. I will reproduce the text here, but the most current version can always be found on that page.</p> 
                   <p><b>Can I upgrade permanent items?</b><br> Yes, players may upgrade permanent magical items or items made from special materials using the Crafting rules on page 535 of the Core Rulebook. Players may not upgrade adventuring gear or consumable items in this manner.</p> 
                   <p><b>Can I pay the cost difference to upgrade a permanent item instead of using Craft to do it myself?</b><vr /> Yes. The Pathfinder Society has numerous crafters that assist their fellow agents. Use the rules for upgrading magic items on page 535 of the Core Rulebook.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <h3>Campaign Coins</h3> 
                   <p>At PaizoCon, we awarded six new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to: David Peever, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#852</b><br> Jocelyn Hamilton, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#853</b><br> Preston Hudson, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#854</b><br> Dennis Muldoon, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#855</b><br> Glen Parnell, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#856</b><br> Nicole Heits, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID <b>#857</b></p> 
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Star for PFS1 and one GM earn their 5th Nova for SFS.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: LeRoy Byrd</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Nova</b>: Nikolaus Beattie</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you’ve achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>In addition to our major shows, convention season is in full swing! We have tons of events around the world scheduled for this summer, and we encourage you to support your local shows! Any convention that has filed for event support can be found on our <a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">conventions calendar</a>.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Growing up in Caliphas, in the haunted nation of Ustalav, Mios Uriev learned that monsters can look like anyone, but they normally look like the rich.</p> 
                   <p>Mios was born poor in the city of dark excess. In a place where disappearances were the norm, their parents raised them with a strict but protective hand, shutting the door to their meager home firmly at night. Mios took solace from this grim upbringing in knowledge, diving into whatever books they could get their hands on and seeking tales wherever they could find them, resulting in an eclectic education. One month, they memorized religious hymns from Andoran; another, they’d rush to finish their errands so they could see a presentation on medical practices from Qadira. It didn’t matter the subject, so long as they could dig into the knowledge the world of books presented to them. They had few friends, but that mattered little in the face of the company their learning provided.</p> 
                   <p>Grown into a young adult full of studied confidence, Mios found work as a night coach driver—though they aspired to something loftier, opportunities were limited for a young worker of their means. Night after night, through pounding rain and choking fog, they drove their charges from grand homes to lavish parties and more often than not, their patrons gave Mios the chills. Perhaps it was the unnatural pallor of their faces or the glint of too-sharp teeth, but Mios became increasingly convinced that a number of Caliphas’s elite were monsters. And one night, their fears were proven true.</p>

                   </table> 
                   <p>That night, under the light of the full moon, Mios drove a young noble to a banquet at a secluded mansion. The man seemed agitated, restless, fidgeting and twitching and pulling the blinds tight. A shiver laced through Mios’s stomach as the carriage began to shake. An enormous roar split through the night as the foolish noble tore through his finery, the transformation taking him. Scrambling, Mios pulled the cart to the side of the darkened road, grabbing their lantern.</p> 
                   <p>The wolf leaped forward with dripping maw, tearing at Mios’s leg with yellowed canines and letting out a sickening crunch as tooth hit bone. With a swing of their arm, Mios shone their lantern in the creature’s face, shouting to drive him off. The beast recoiled, almost seeming to remember himself for a moment, the lantern’s light illuminating his feral form. The creature dove from the carriage and scrambled into the night, leaving Mios bleeding... but alive.</p> 
                   <p>A werewolf bite, they thought grimly as they drove home, barely hanging onto consciousness. Countless cures written in dusty tomes or purported by local folk healers, but none proven, none reliable. No hope, most might think. But Mios believed in knowledge, believed in the power of the written word and the passed-down tale. Over the next month, they nursed their near-shattered leg, which would heal but never be quite the same, always requiring a brace to hold it steady. While their body recovered, they stretched their mind, reading every text they could get their hands on, apocryphal or not, and trying every reported cure. Herbal remedies, blood sacrifices of small animals, and stranger, they tried method after method, hoping one would stick. When the full moon next came, they drove into the woods and waited in terror for what all said was inevitable. The moon rose painfully slow, each moment an agonizing wait for the pain to begin, for the cracking of bones and sprouting of fur and claw. But the night waxed on, and the moon reached its anticlimactic zenith. Mios sat in silence. Could it be possible? Had they found a cure among the dozens of methods they tried? It appeared so. Which cure had actually worked, they’d never know, but their dedication and desperation had paid off. They had fought off the bite.</p> 
                   <p>After their miraculous escape from this dark fate, Mios’s everyday life, ferrying others back and forth along the same wagon tracks, seemed devoid of meaning. They had discovered an incredible truth: fates weren’t sealed. Their learning, their dedication, it made them more than just a driver. To continue with their previous life felt like a waste of the gift they were just beginning to realize they possessed. Because the world was full of dark things, the powerful preying on the weak. Their lantern, which once shone the way through darkened streets, could shine a light on creatures of the night and bring hope to those in need.</p> 
                   <p>And so, Mios set forth on a life of adventure, knowledge as their weapon. The unknown, the dark, all could be illuminated by the right source: their wit, their determination, and their lantern’s unfailing light.</p>

                   <p><b>Name: Dan Thompson<br> Pronouns: (he/him)<br> Role (if not staff): GM of The Danger Club Podcast<br> Social Media Handles: <a href="https://twitter.com/danthompson2099">@danthompson2099</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DangerClubPod">@DangerClubPod</a></b></p> 
                   <h3>Tell us about yourself. What is your bio? What's your story behind the bio? Why do you do what you do?</h3> 
                   <p>I’m the GM for The Danger Club Podcast. We’re a bunch of actors from the UK who have been making a Pathfinder show for nearly four years now! I’ve been playing roleplaying games since I was a kid, and when I quit my job to move to London and be an actor, I didn’t really know anyone. So one day I invited a few of the cast from my show to play a game after we got out. We had a great time and started playing every week. Then people started asking to come watch us, and one of them suggested we try podcasting. Back when we started there were already lots of great shows, and I often felt intimidated by how good they seemed to be at playing the game and remembering rules. That’s impressive, but it’s not how my friends and I game at all. We just grab dice, make some jokes, and try to tell a story. People sometimes say that Pathfinder is a complicated game and you have to learn a ton of rules to enjoy it, so we wanted to show that you don’t need that at all. We’ve gotten good at recording and editing, but when it comes down to it, the podcast isn’t any different from those early days. It’s the feeling of sitting in the pub with your mates, making up characters, and having a good time.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Tell us about a project you are particularly proud of?</h3> 
                   <p>The thing I’m really proud of is the work we did during lockdown. We’re all performers, so when the pandemic hit, we literally lost our careers overnight—just years of work gone in an instant. My mental health was pretty bad at the time, and it would have been really easy to just call it a day and focus on getting through. But then we saw members of our community struggling the same way, and we just made a snap decision that we couldn’t bail on them. We learned how to record from home, we learned how to use Twitch, and we invited people from Paizo to come on and talk about their work. We put out two or three shows a week for two years, and we never missed a week. At the same time we got to know the Dangerling community in a way we hadn’t before and came away much closer.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What do you do as your day job?</h3> 
                   <p>All the DCP are actors/performers of one kind or another. In the “before times,” I worked as a comedian and was part of the acting team for a lot of London’s historic sites. I’d spend the day running around in armor and spend the evening pretending to be a character in armor around a gaming table. Since the pandemic killed off a lot of those companies, I’ve moved more into production, and now I stage manage a cabaret club and develop scripts for online games. I won’t lie, I miss the armor a little bit.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Where do you draw your inspiration?</h3> 
                   <p>As a neurodivergent person, my brain is quite a frantic place. Letting a part of it sit in Golarion and make up stories is a way for the rest of me to stay grounded. Part of my brain is pretty much always devouring things I see and turning them into Danger Club stories, which leaves the rest of my brain free to remember to eat lunch or leave the house on time. I’m not focused enough to be one of these GMs who knows every shop and NPC in their world, so I prefer to focus on key moments that I want to happen and cling for dear life, laying down track in front of the train until we get there.</p>' 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What piece of advice that you have been given as a creator that is either so great that you have to tell us about it or so awful that you have to warn us?</h3> 
                   <p>There are no competitors here, only potential collaborators. It’s easy to feel like other creators are so far ahead, but they probably have days where they feel the same about you. Some of my favorite projects are where we reached out to people we admired and asked if we could make something together. The more we lift each other up, the better we all do.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>How did you get started writing/producing/creating content?</h3> 
                   <p>I’ve been writing my whole life. I’ve been a comedian, actor, comic book writer, and I’ve been making up roleplaying games since I was 12. In terms of podcasting, we used to play Pathfinder at a London pub every Monday, and over the years people started coming to watch, so we decided to record some and see what would happen. Now, here we are!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What are your goals or dreams as a creator?</h3> 
                   <p>I want to grow the DCP community to be absolutely gigantic. They’re such an awesome group of people, and every time somebody new joins the Discord, it’s like getting a new friend. We’ve been through a lot, and the way they’ve supported each other and us through it all just fills me with joy. I want everyone to get to share in that…but in a nice way, not a Borg way.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>How have you seen immersive fantasy worlds and cooperative strategic play bring people together and create lifelong friendships?</h3> 
                   <p>Well, back in 2011 I suggested to a group of actors that we go play a roleplaying game after the show and we’ve played every week since then and now make a podcast together! That’s definitely got to count for something, right? You see it in our community as well. A lot of our listeners are new to Pathfinder so some of the more experienced GMs set up a channel on our Discord where they could form gaming groups. I got a message the other day that one of them is closing in on the end of Agents of Edgewatch, and I couldn’t be prouder.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Please tell us about your pet!</h3> 
                   <p>Sadly my apartment isn’t big enough to keep a happy pet, but I do have a unicorn who keeps me company while I write! </p>

                   <h3>If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live and why?</h3> 
                   <p>I’m a Londoner until the end. Every street here has a thousand stories to uncover, and no matter how much you learn, there’ll always be more. I’ve played Pathfinder in the Tower of London and in the foundations of London Bridge. I’ve not managed to play in an actual palace yet, but there’s still time.</p>

                   <p>Dear PaizoCon attendees,</p> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Thank you for attending PaizoCon 2022! We hope you had as wonderful a time playing games and participating in events as we did putting on the show. It was a much-needed return to PaizoCons of yore, and we can’t wait to continue offering in-person convention experiences in the years to come.</p> 
                   <p>This year’s in-person PaizoCon wasn’t without its challenges, however, including several reports of COVID-19 infections among attendees. Paizo considers the health and well-being of all community members a priority, and we want to take this opportunity to inform you that individuals you may have had close contact with at PaizoCon 2022 have tested positive for, and/or shown symptoms consistent with, COVID-19. Close contact is defined as having shared a game table, panel space, or similar, to the best of our knowledge. </p> 
                   <p>The following are all reported cases we’re aware of at the time of this post. For more up-to-date contact tracing information, please see the <a href="https://discord.gg/WSdXx7mr">#contact-tracing</a> channel of the PaizoCon Discord server located at <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ZGTEqnemFx">https://paizo.events</a>.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 1:</b> An attendee started experiencing cold-like symptoms Monday, May 30, while traveling and tested positive later that evening. Their last negative test prior to the convention was before their flight to Seattle on Thursday, May 26.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 2:</b> A Paizo staff member reported a positive test on Monday, May 30, after taking the test the previous evening. They had tested negative the previous Friday morning and had arrived at the show on Saturday. They were masked while wandering the show (they had no assigned tasks that day) and ate dinner at a nearby restaurant alone. On Sunday morning, they felt ill so went home without visiting the show. They tested positive later that evening.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 3:</b> Two attendees who traveled to the show together and were in each other’s company the entire convention reported positive tests on Tuesday afternoon, May 31. They were masked most of the time, but not while outdoors or at meals. They were at the hotel bar hangout mostly maskless on Saturday night. Both began experiencing symptoms Monday afternoon/evening.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 4:</b> An attendee reported testing positive on Tuesday, May 31. They flew into the convention the previous Thursday, ate at the hotel bar Thursday night and Friday afternoon, attended panels in the streaming room Friday through Sunday, and attended the Find the Path and Hideous Laughter podcast meetups. They flew back Monday morning and were wearing a mask consistently when not eating or drinking.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 5:</b> An attendee reported a positive test on Thursday, June 2. They were in the Organized Play room all weekend and were masked consistently all weekend except when they ate alone at the hotel bar on Friday, and around the lobby cafe at other times.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 6:</b> A Paizo staff member reported a positive test on Friday, June 3, after a few days of feeling bad. They spent most of their time in the Organized Play ballroom. They ate lunch in the hotel restaurant on Friday and Sunday but otherwise engaged in no other maskless activities at the convention.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 7:</b> A Paizo staff member started experiencing symptoms Friday, June 3 and reported a positive test later that morning. The staff member spent most of their time at or near registration, did not participate in any panels or gaming events, and shared meals mostly with other Paizo staff members.</p> 
                   <p><b>Report 8:</b> An attendee working the Syrinscape booth in the lobby reported a positive test on Friday, June 3.</p> 
                   <p>Paizo has reported these cases to the convention venue and King County Public Health, and will continue to work in concert with them as we monitor the situation.</p> 
                   <p>We encourage all PaizoCon attendees to test for COVID-19 as soon as possible. Washington state residents can get free kits by mail <a href="https://sayyescovidhometest.org/">at this site</a>, all US residents can get tests <a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">at this site</a>, and further guidance is available <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/index.html">at the CDC’s website</a>.</p> 
                   <p> If you do test positive or exhibit symptoms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:paizocon@paizo.com">paizocon@paizo.com</a> so we can inform others you may have been in close contact with. Your information will never be shared publicly without your consent. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us.</p>

                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c26e209c-d53d-42ed-956b-add24c180a6f/PZO2033_AbominationVaults5E_1200x675.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c26e209c-d53d-42ed-956b-add24c180a6f/PZO2033_AbominationVaults5E_1200x675.png" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Abomination Vaults Fifth Edition Hard Cover: A bearded sorrowful man stands in the foreground with a demon, a large worm, and a ghostly woman in the background behind him "></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Once we realized what a hit we had in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path, we started a Pathfinder Second Edition compilation and a 5E conversion at roughly the same time. James Jacobs, Vanessa Hoskins, and Stephen Radney-MacFarland had done phenomenal work creating the three individual Adventure Path volumes. The story, maps, and art were already in place. So while I was compiling the Pathfinder Second Edition version, I brought in David N. Ross, a 5E expert, to convert the entire campaign from its 1st-level beginning all the way to its 11th-level conclusion. This conversion is a rules overhaul from the ground up. We streamlined all the combat encounters, adjusted all the treasure, adjusted all the XP awards, and loaded the book with tons of 5E stat blocks. </p> 
                   <p>This isn’t the first time we’ve adapted one of our adventures to a different game’s rules. It’s not even the first time we’ve adapted one of our campaigns to the 5E rules: that would be the Kingmaker Adventure Path. But while the Kingmaker 5E rules cover an extensive bestiary of monsters and NPCs, the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path gives you a complete 5E campaign in a single book! This hardcover is the only thing you need to run this campaign at your gaming table—from a complete gazetteer of the town of Otari to every one of the ten dungeon levels beneath the eerie Gauntlight lighthouse. There are doors to be kicked down, loot to be plundered, side quests to fulfill, people to help, and even a few dragons to fight.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>One of the things I loved about putting this book together was all the extra art we could include. Pathfinder Second Edition players already know what grothluts, gogiteths, and shulns are. We have those monsters illustrated in our <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em>. But 5E players don’t know what they are, so I packed in a lot of our art to show them off.</p> 
                   <p>Of course, all these new critters need 5E stats, and the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path provides them. This hardcover is a great 5E resource, even if only as a great big book of new monster and NPC stats. Shulns for everyone!</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>But the key, as always, is the story. Despite the differences in rules, the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path is still the tale of the sleepy coastal town of Otari, the Gauntlight’s dread light, and the spiteful ghost who lurks deep underground. Heroes must explore the dungeon, solve its mysteries, and help the helpless. That’s a story I love telling in any rules system. </p>

                   <p><b>FEAR THE SETTING OF THE SUN!</b><br> It has been well over a decade since Queen Ileosa was defeated, but the city of Korvosa still fears the evil tyrant’s legacy. And so when ghosts of the sinister queen manifest on the streets after dark, the need for new heroes arises! Pathfinder Adventure: Shadows at Sundown is an adventure for 11th-level characters written by Landon Winkler. While a standalone story, it builds upon themes and plots from years of adventures set in the Varisian city of Korvosa, and includes new monsters and new challenges to test the mightiest heroes. Who will save the city of Korvosa from the dangers that hide in the Shadows at Sundown?</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Last year, we at Game to Grow were featured on Paizo’s blog as part of Autism Awareness Month. Some autistic members of our community shared their own experiences learning and growing while playing RPGs. This May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and we’re happy to be back with more from the frontiers of gaming therapy. </p> 
                   <p>In the past year, Game to Grow has continued to rise to meet the emerging needs of individuals worldwide. We’ve broadened our RPG-based services to serve a wider group of individuals and address a new range of challenges. Specifically, we’ve expanded our youth program to serve youth in the foster care system and youth in hospitals, and we have new groups specifically for LGBTQ+ youth. We’ve also expanded our adult programming to provide RPG groups focused on empathy, empowerment, and personal exploration. Our individual counseling program now has even more geek-friendly therapists steeped in the language of game lovers to facilitate personal growth. Game to Grow’s training program has had over 1,000 professionals trained in the Game to Grow Method, multiplying the number of people around the world who can continue to grow with games. </p> 
                   <p>So how does it work? How are RPGs such a powerful tool for insight, growth, and change for so many people?</p> 
                   <p>When using RPGs as a tool for growth, Game to Grow and our trainees leverage some of the built-in benefits of playing RPGs to help players gain new insights, build new skills, and develop social confidence. Below are <em>some</em> of the benefits you might consider the next time you play. In our training program we call these the “Core Capacities.” The next time you play, we encourage you to think about each of these as a muscle. The more you work and flex the muscle, the more you can build strength! </p>

                   <p><b>Regulation</b><br> When playing games like Pathfinder, there’s a 5% chance a player will roll a 1 any time they roll their d20. As all players know, this can be <em>incredibly frustrating</em>! Because RPGs are so unpredictable, they’re wonderful opportunities to build the skill of regulation: the ability to handle both unpleasant and pleasant stress. Playing RPGs helps to build the ability to stay regulated, even to <em>enjoy</em> the peaks and valleys of triumph and disaster.</p> 
                   <p><b>Collaboration</b><br> RPGs like Pathfinder are games of fellowship. No one character—no matter how meticulously a player has created them—is capable of handling every obstacle alone. RPGs remind us that we are stronger when we work with others and build on each other’s ideas. This is true on and off the RPG table!</p> 
                   <p><b>Planning</b><br> When players are given an opportunity to solve problems together, they can plot, plan, and scheme. This is more than just looking before leaping, this is using logical sequencing and critical reasoning to construct plans based on facts and evidence. (Plans, of course, never go as planned. See why regulation is such an important skill!?)</p> 
                   <p><b>Perspective-Taking</b><br> Though our characters might be, none of us are mind-readers. We have to actively work to communicate and understand the thoughts, feelings, and desires of others. In RPGs, this is built into the game! We are, but also aren’t, our characters. We’re constantly navigating player knowledge and character knowledge and communicating about both with our fellow players. Communicating clearly about our internal state, and confirming our assumptions of others’, is an incredibly valuable skill!</p> 
                   <p><b>Pretend Play</b><br> Something often overlooked, especially for adults, is the life-enriching magic of play. Play is when our imaginations come to life, when we lose track of being perfect rule-followers, and when we become fully-engaged agents of change in our own lives. Play isn’t just important, it’s essential, and RPGs provide such a bounty of opportunities for true play! </p>

                   <p>We also always like to ask players themselves: What have you learned about yourself through playing RPGs? How have they helped you learn, grow, and change? Let us know in the comments!</p>

                   <p><b>Name:</b> Vanessa Hoskins<br> <b>Pronouns:</b> she/her<br> <b>Role (if not staff):</b> Freelance Author, PaizoCon 2022 Guest of Honor<br> <b>Social Media Handles:</b> Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NinjaCatVanessa">@NinjaCatVanessa</a></p> 
                   <h3>Tell us about yourself. What is your bio? What's your story behind the bio? Why do you do what you do?</h3> 
                   <p>A few weeks ago folks got my dry, more business-y bio in the PaizoCon 2022 announcement blog. While it’s true that I started writing for Pathfinder in 2013, it’s difficult to get to know a person through a formal bio. So let’s get informal.</p> 
                   <p>I’m a queer transgender woman, though I only discovered this about 5 years ago. I literally discovered this about myself through playing and writing for Pathfinder. While I was writing <em>Pathfinder Society Special 8–99: The Solstice Scar</em>, I devised the character of Medda Spiritbearer, a central NPC to the adventure. While writing it, a trans friend of mine was talking about how there could be more trans representation in Pathfinder Society (there’s loads now, but back then we just had one character and she was… played for laughs. It wasn’t good.) I thought, “I can make Medda trans, sure!” I started researching transgender women, what it means to be trans, and even got a popular trans consultant to assist with writing the character. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the way trans women experienced the world, the feelings they had about themselves, were startlingly relatable. I came out about a year later. You can read more about <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2018/07/inspire-confidence-know-thyself/"><b>that here.</b></a></p> 
                   <p>I’m a non-athletic video-game nerd at heart. I love playing on PC and consoles, you name it. I find gaming in all forms to be an engaging form of puzzle solving, storytelling, and dopamine production all rolled into one. Some of my favorites are the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, <em>Super Metroid</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, and <em>Street Fighter II</em>.</p> 
                   <p>I have a film degree! …but I’ve never used it professionally. Even though I’ve been trained as a writer and director, by the time I graduated I had a steady job in Information Technology and the film industry was in a bit of a slump, so entry level jobs were difficult to find. However, I do find use of my degree constantly while working on creative projects. The axiom “Always preserve your options,” has resonated with me throughout my careers. Essentially, “don’t limit yourself to a decision before you have to.” In film this meant shooting in color, even if you wanted black &amp; white as an end result. By shooting in color, you have more “channels” of light to adjust before desaturating everything. And if you want to keep that red umbrella red? You can isolate it from the filters instead of having to colorize it later.</p> 
                   <p>My passion for TTRPGs is greater than just about any other form of entertainment. I’d rather be rolling dice with friends than watching a movie, going to the park, or just about anything. It’s my #1 thing I’d want to do with my spare time, given the option. Dice and characters and settings! Oh my!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Tell us about a project you are particularly proud of!</h3> 
                   <p>I’m extremely proud of <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em>. It was the first evergreen PFS scenario to start above 1st level, and it’s essentially a build-a-dungeon. When I was asked to write it, I remember thinking about how so many evergreens at the time were the same story and maps over and over, but with slightly different foes. I wanted something that really felt unique at the table, and gave GMs the creative control to homebrew their own dungeon crawl (within a limited number of pre-approved options). There’s even a way to roll up a random set of challenges, which is how I always run it. I allow the players to roll on the tables just before running the adventure, so I don’t even know what I’m running until we get started.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Where do you draw your inspiration?</h3> 
                   <p>Pop culture mostly? But not just what’s popular now; I draw from the cartoons I watched as a kid and books I read as a teen. I also play the “what if” game a lot where I take a set of given circumstances and ask myself “what if ___ is really happening?” or “what if the NPC is really a ____?” These brainstorms usually land a few chunks of gold (or at least silver) that I can then build into a fun adventure!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What are your goals or dreams as a creator?</h3> 
                   <p>I’d LOVE to open my own video game studio and make the kinds of games I loved as a kid. So… that’s just what I’m doing with Ninja Cat Games. It’s a little start-up studio I’m still trying to get off the ground, but so far it looks like it might just be a rocket ride!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>How have you seen immersive fantasy worlds and cooperative strategic play bring people together and create lifelong friendships?</h3> 
                   <p>Through the Organized Play system, mostly. After having volunteered as a Venture–Captain for years, and gone to Gen Con for even longer, I’ve meet people from all over the country—all over the world! It’s really amazing, and I feel really lucky to have met so many awesome people in all different places around the world. Sometimes my wife will mention a city or European country and I interject, “—Oh, I have some friends who live there!”</p> 
                   <p>Sitting and a table and sharing an experience with other people, and working together towards a common goal, is a way to open lines of communication and friendship like nothing else. And because the players are all working together rather than against each other, there’s no animosity like in… say… competitive professional sports.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What piece of advice that you have been given as a creator that is either so great that you have to tell us about it, or so awful that you have to warn us?</h3> 
                   <p>I have two good pieces of advice, and they go hand in hand:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li><b>Everyone is late at some point.</b> I rallied against this for a while early in my career. I’d say “Not me! I’ve never been late and I don’t intend to start now.” Then… then I had some really challenging months and fell far behind several projects. I even had to “give back” some assignments or parts of assignments so that I could take care of the things going on in my life. I was devastated. I’d never been late before. I was so PROUD of that… but that’s just what it was: pride. It’s ok to be late, and it’s ok if you fall behind sometimes. You just need to…</li> 
                    <br> 
                    <li><b>Communicate with your Developer.</b> Let them know about issues you’re having, parts of the plot that aren’t jelling, or a monster ability that you can envision conceptually but just can’t get in words. And if you’re overwhelmed and not be able to turn your words in on time (and within 5% of the word count), then just talk with them. They might be able to buy you more time. They might want to re-assign some words. That’s ok. Just communicate with them and be clear and honest about the expectations of getting something done, and with good enough quality to print.</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Please tell us about your pet!</h3> 
                   <p>My cat, Bella, is a black American shorthair. She is a cuddle MONSTER. That’s all she ever wants is to cuddle (or to be left alone to sleep). Recently she’s decided that “tent time” is the best time: that’s when we lay in bed and lift our knees up to create a “tent” under the covers. She likes to sleep down there.,/p&gt; </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p> 
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>If you could be any iconic, who would you be?</h3> 
                   <p>If I could be any iconic I’d be Seoni. She’s hot, she has powerful magic, and these awesome magic tattoos. Plus she’s really smart and a good leader.</p> 
                   <p>However… I’m probably most like Merisiel. I’m kind of a disaster, but well intentioned. I saw the wrong thing at the wrong time, much to my wife’s dismay, and when I get angered, I get can get stabby (verbally, of course).</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live and why?</h3> 
                   <p>New York City. It’s the greatest city in the world, and when I’m there I feel like I’m in the right place. The first time I visited is when I was about 25 and I brought my little brother along. We walked all around the city, slept on a bench, visited museums, and just hung out in Central Park. From that moment I knew that I wanted to live there someday.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p>Hello, Starfinders!</p> 
                   <p itemprop="description">This month we officially launch the Year of Redemption’s Rise with not one, not two, but three new Starfinder Society Scenarios! Let’s dive right in!</p> 
                   <p>The Data Scourge is over and Absalom Station is saved! Yet, trouble continues to brew within the Starfinder Society. As suspicion and paranoia cause agents to isolate and the Society to fracture along faction lines, First Seeker Ehu Hadif embarks on a year of change. He opens the floor to all agents, giving them a platform to voice their concerns, plans, and ambitions, and to lobby for change. From these discussions, new factions are founded, reforms are enacted, and relationships begin to mend. Our first scenario </p> 
                   <p>Take on the role of Starfinders tasked with assisting three minor factions integral to the future of the Starfinder Society: the longstanding <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0k">Manifold Host</a> and the newly formed <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shzj?Starfinder-Society-Faction-Preview-The-Advocates">Advocates</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0a">Cognates</a> factions. Soothe the tempers of clashing agents, welcome new members to the Starfinder Society, track down and destroy lingering fragments of the Data Scourge, and help Ziggy secure a new base of operations! Wait, that last one sounds familiar… </p> 
                   <p>Take the first steps toward a brighter future in the Year of Redemption’s Rise! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c6r?Starfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Redemptions-Rise"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-01: Intro: Year of Redemption’s Rise</em></a> is a repeatable scenario for levels 1–4 written by Alex Speidel. This is the first scenario in the ongoing Year of Redemption's Rise metaplot. While it is recommended you begin with <em>Intro: Year of Redemption's Rise</em>, the remaining metaplot scenarios in the Year of Redemption's Rise can be played in any order.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1153f05c-916a-4824-8e3d-9536eebc3f92/Pahtra_final.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1153f05c-916a-4824-8e3d-9536eebc3f92/Pahtra_final.png" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A pahtra Starfinder wearing earbuds"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>In our second scenario of the month, the Starfinders have discovered a relic of dubious providence in their collection, which further investigation reveals to have been stolen by a famous, long deceased Starfinder. Rather than bury the truth, Celita and Fitch dispatch a team of Starfinders to Qidel to return the relic to the strix from whom it was stolen and to offer the Society’s heartfelt apologies. But earning the acknowledgement of those we’ve wronged takes more than pretty words, and forgiveness is far harder to come by. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c6s?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-502-Road-to-Reconciliation"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-02: Road to Reconciliation</em></a> is a scenario for levels 3–6 written by Shay Snow.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/948f84fc-3adc-4aad-a4b5-4eabf0237a07/PZOSFS05_Nights_Call.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/948f84fc-3adc-4aad-a4b5-4eabf0237a07/PZOSFS05_Nights_Call.png" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A stone whistle carved from sunstone into the shape of a nesting bird."></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Finally, the Starfinder Society travels to Vesk-6 to meet with Miiyu, pahtra pop star and leader of the Pulonis Liberation Front. Miiyu asks the Starfinders to help her identify a murderous double-agent she suspects to be hiding among her inner circle. To get the Starfinders close without tipping off the traitor, Miiyu has planned this mission to coincide with another: securing an old military bunker as a base of operations for the PLF. Unfortunately, helping rebels isn’t exactly a Veskarium approved mission. To avoid the attention of the Veskarium, the Starfinders need to juggle their true mission with their public mission to investigate the mysterious Shriek. Keep a sharp eye out! Vesk-6 is dangerous enough, without having to worry that one of your traveling companions is a traitor! Oh, and did I mention this adventure has… <b>mechs</b>? Yes, this is our first Starfinder Society Scenario to feature mech combat! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c6t?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-503-Combatants-Concerto-Fugue-of-the-Traitor"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-03: Combatant’s Concerto: Fugue of the Traitor</em></a> is a scenario for levels 7–10 written by Alison Cybe. </p> 
                   <p>This scenario continues the ongoing Combatant's Concerto storyline, which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0251a"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #3-11: Into the Veskarium</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027tt"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Combatant's Concerto: Prelude to Revolution</em></a>. While playing these previous scenarios enriches the experience of this adventure, it’s not required, so play away!</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Gather ‘round, Pathfinders! We have one Pathfinder Society scenario releasing this month, and it’s an exciting one. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3m?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Cavern-of-the-Sundered-Song"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-15: Cavern of the Sundered Song</em></a> is our very first 2nd Edition Pathfinder Society scenario for level 9–12 characters! Many players have been eagerly awaiting an opportunity to play in this level range, and veteran adventure author Kate Baker has crafted something both challenging and exciting for them.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4777eaa9-ea7d-4a34-a198-812cb12b51b7/PZOPFS0315E_IrlahKestiwhitt.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/4777eaa9-ea7d-4a34-a198-812cb12b51b7/PZOPFS0315E_IrlahKestiwhitt.png" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A pink haired gnome cleric"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>This is a non-metaplot scenario, so if you don’t quite have a character in this level range yet, the standalone nature of the adventure means that it’ll still be relevant when you’re ready. Speaking of the story, <em>Cavern of the Sundered Song</em> has plenty of opportunities for role-playing with some fun characters, including one you may recognize from your character’s earliest days in the Pathfinder Society: Kreighton Shaine, the Master of Scrolls! Why has he been avoiding the enigmatic scrollmaster Effeflinn Whyst for so many years, and why have the two of them suddenly disappeared into a portal leading to a dangerous, isolated cavern? It’s up to you to find out!</p> 
                   <p>This adventure also includes a side mission for the Grand Archive faction. I’d love to say more about some of the wonderful places you’ll visit in <em>Cavern of the Sundered Song</em>, but I don’t want to spoil anything. You’ll just have to roll the dice and see for yourselves!</p>

                   <p>This is perhaps the most approachable Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Path that we’ve made.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>It features a more focused scope, taking characters from 1st level to 11th level (instead of all the way to 20th level, as all our previous Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Paths have done). </li> 
                    <li>It offers the heroes a clear “home base” in the town of Otari that could be dropped into just about any campaign setting, Age of Lost Omens or otherwise. </li> 
                    <li>It extends the locale of the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a>, which has already attracted lots of eager new players to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>With the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path, experienced GMs have enough content to make their campaign really shine, and newer GMs can trust us to give them something they can handle that will amaze their players. </p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>When we saw how much people loved the Abomination Vaults campaign—I was thrilled to see so many people saying it was the best megadungeon they’d ever seen—we knew it was destined for something special. The work to convert the campaign into a hardcover was already going on when the first subscribers were still playing it. I watched the Paizo forums I set up for each of the adventures, making notes about errors to be corrected and rough spots that people found difficult to understand. I filled my three volumes of the Adventure Path with dozens and dozens of sticky notes, each one marking a place we could make the campaign better—such as by fixing a reference to a room that didn’t exist, ordering some art that players felt necessary, smoothing out the treasure progression, or replacing a certain foe’s 3rd-level spell with one a little less (ahem) deadly.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/391db5b6-a051-4e18-8797-a33b47d0721d/PZO90163%20_MISTERBEAK_ArturNakhodkin_1500.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/391db5b6-a051-4e18-8797-a33b47d0721d/PZO90163%20_MISTERBEAK_ArturNakhodkin_1500.png" width="40%" style="padding: 10px;" alt=" A ball jointed doll with with the head carved like a bird, wearing pants and boots, with fabric wings attached to its arms"></a>

                   <br> 
                   <p>As it turns out, no drastic overhauls of the campaign were necessary. That meant I could really focus on how to make the campaign easier to run. This isn’t just a reprint of the three adventures bound within a hard cover. It’s been reorganized to make it even more usable and fun. As an overview, here’s what you’ll find inside: </p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>We open with a synopsis of the whole campaign, including the primary villain’s background, a timeline, and an easy leveling guideline: “the dungeon level your heroes are on is the character level they should be.”</li> 
                    <li>Next, you’ll find a chapter detailing the town of Otari. As the heroes’ home base and the source of numerous rumors and side missions, it’s presented right up front. We included the new backgrounds and other rules from the standalone <em>Pathfinder Abomination Vaults Player’s Guide</em> here, to put everything in one place.</li> 
                    <li>The bulk of the hardcover includes the next 10 chapters, each detailing one of the 10 dungeon levels. </li> 
                    <li>We included an article about the evil god lurking behind the events of the campaign.</li> 
                    <li>Near the end, an enormous Adventure Toolbox presents all the new items, spells, artifacts, archetypes, and more. This toolbox also contains nearly 30 new monsters featured in the campaign!</li> 
                    <li>I’m particularly happy with the adventure’s final page, a Glossary that gives a short summary and location for dozens of NPCs, groups, unique items, and more. This will help GMs keep details regarding NPCs with similar names in mind, such as Vandy, Volluk, and Vethris. </li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Picking up the entire Abomination Vaults Adventure Path in a single book is a fantastic way to bring this campaign to your table. There’s a ton of support for it, too, from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4z/discuss?Pathfinder-Abomination-Vaults-Battle-Cards"><em>Abomination Vaults Battle Cards</em></a> to licensed products like <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0y?Enter-the-Pathfinder-Terrain-Abomination">Pathfinder Terrain</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0e?Paizo-And-Foundry-Virtual-Tabletop-Content">Foundry Virtual Tabletop</a>.</p> 
                   <p>I hope you have as much fun enjoying this megadungeon as we did building it!</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>“I have had the pleasure of working closely with Jim from his days at TSR through his time working on Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition at Wizards of the Coast, and now working with me at Paizo,” Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens said. Jim is a hardworking visionary whose almost three decades of game experience makes him the perfect person to guide Paizo into its third decade.”</p> 
                   <p>“I’m grateful for the trust that Lisa and the Leadership Team have placed in me to lead Paizo,” Jim Butler said. “I look forward to working with my fellow employees to lead the company into the next era of tabletop excellence.”</p> 
                   <p>Jim brings decades of gaming experience to his new role, including serving as Paizo’s vice president of marketing and licensing over the last five years. Before Paizo, he has worked at TSR, Wizards of the Coast, Warner Bros./Turbine, and Trion Worlds.</p> 
                   <p>“I started my gaming career as an editor and game designer, switching over to marketing and brand management when Peter Adkison wanted ‘gamers with business degrees’ running Dungeons &amp; Dragons,” Jim said. “It’s been an epic adventure so far, and I’m excited that a new chapter has begun.”</p> 
                   <p>Jim lives in Redmond, WA with his husband, Matthew, and their fur-kids: Toker, Stella, and Skylar. He’s currently playing through volume 5 of the Pathfinder Return of the Runelords Adventure Path as a kobold druid and GMing the Extinction Curse Adventure Path for Pathfinder Second Edition.</p>

                   <p><b>The Glass Cannon Network</b>: Join the miscreants from the Glass Cannon Network for tabletop and board gaming in the Glass Cannon Network Room all weekend. And don’t miss Pathfinder Live! on Saturday at 12 p.m. when the GCN brings its trademark brand of nonsense to Pathfinder Second Edition!</p> 
                   <p><b>Safety Precautions</b>: Covid-19 remains an ongoing consideration, and Paizo is committed to the safety of the Paizo staff and attendees. We intend to take the following precautions to better protect attendees.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>In-person attendees must show proof of vaccination (including booster shots, if eligible) and wear masks in all Paizo-controlled spaces such as ballrooms, seminar rooms, gaming spaces, and the PaizoCon store.</li> 
                    <li>Our annual banquet has been cancelled.</li> 
                    <li>Hand sanitizer will be available in public spaces.</li> 
                    <li>We have reduced the number of in-person tickets and have capped physical attendance to the show at 500 attendees.</li> 
                    <li>We have allocated more open space in common areas to allow for better separation between attendees in the seminar rooms, OP hall (between players and between tables), and in the PaizoCon store.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>We look forward to seeing you at the show whether you attend online or in person!</p>

                   <p>Paizo won’t have any staff in attendance but have partnered with the convention to debut Pathfinder Dinky Dungeon, a lighthearted adventure in which players navigate a floor full of tiles and face off against everything from deadly traps and monsters to being cursed to wear a silly hat for the rest of the game. We were very excited to work with the folks behind the show to develop this family-friendly sorta-LARP and hope attendees have as much fun playing it as we did working on it. Be sure to post pictures of yourselves playing Pathfinder Dinky Dungeon and tag Paizo’s social media accounts, and we’ll make sure to amplify the <strike>most embarrassing</strike> best ones!</p>

                   <p>For those Pathfinder and Starfinder fans looking for something a bit more traditional, we’ll also have a large organized play presence at the show. Here’s more information from Regional Venture-Coordinator Ian Hawthorne of the Isles Region:</p> 
                   <p>UK Games Expo has long held a place in the UK Pathfinder Society’s heart. From its humble beginnings in the Clarendon Suites back in 2007, we have seen it grow until now it occupies three exhibition halls and several function rooms at the National Exhibition Centre, as well as spilling over into the board game and RPG haven that is the nearby Hilton Hotel. </p> 
                   <p>Yes, it’s a big event! It's also the perfect place to play Pathfinder and Starfinder. Terry Thambipillai, VC for the Midlands Region, has coordinated a wonderful mix of PFS1, PFS2, and Starfinder games available over eight different gaming slots. This gives you plenty of time to enjoy a game or three and still be able to watch seminars, play boardgames, or shop until you drop. We have a mixture of games suited both to invested and new players—UKGE is a great place to play for the first time in a relaxed, supportive, and fun environment! </p> 
                   <p>All the details on how to buy tickets and find us can be found on the <a href="https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/">UK Games Expo website</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>

                   <p>In <em>Shardfall</em>, the player will explore a rich audio environment, immersing themselves in the pirate-ridden Shackles, the heart of the Lost Omens setting’s high seas. Setting sail from a base of operations in the dangerous archipelago, they’ll survey the many uncharted islands in the region while investigating a strange magical phenomenon that could shift the balance of power in the Shackles and beyond. Will you eradicate this rising threat before it falls into the wrong hands, or are those wrong hands your own? </p> 
                   <p>Prepare to raise anchor, assemble a motley crew of new and familiar faces, navigate contentious waters between opposing factions, and explore long-forgotten islands in search of treasure and unlimited power! This engaging interactive audio adventure is coming this summer–with more information to be revealed soon!</p>

                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available June 1, 2022:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3m?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Cavern-of-the-Sundered-Song"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-15: Cavern of the Sundered Song</em>*</a><br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3n?Pathfinder-Bounty-19-Grim-Tidings"><em>Pathfinder Bounty #19: Grim Tidings</em></a></p>

                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>Even in the height of convention season, sanctioning continues apace! Last week we posted sanctioning for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a>, including character options and the included adventure, “March of the Dead.” We also had <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0t?Organized-Play-Sanctioning-Update-April-2022">a blog</a> that talked about our sanctioning process regarding <em>Book of the Dead</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Coming up soon, we have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3a"><em>Knights of Lastwall</em></a> for PFS2 and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly"><em>Drift Crisis</em></a> for SFS. Both release at the end of May, and we’re hoping to have sanctioning ready for both on their street date. The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/horizonsOfTheVast"><em>Horizons of the Vast</em></a> Adventure Path documents are in their final stages, and we hope to have those out to you soon as well. After all that, we’ll start to get weird with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02arq?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive"><em>Dark Archive</em></a>!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Boon Updates</h2> 
                   <p>After a discussion with some of our volunteers, we’re making a minor change to the boons which unlock versatile heritages. Each boon will have one or more languages added; characters with that heritage also have access to the language(s), as listed, though they still must take them when they would take any other language. If you previously had a character with these heritages and would like to swap one of their languages for a newly-accessible language, you may do so for free at this time. The languages added are:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Aphorite: Utopian</li> 
                    <li>Aasimar: Celestial</li> 
                    <li>Changeling: Aklo</li> 
                    <li>Dhampir: Necril</li> 
                    <li>Duskwalker: Requian</li> 
                    <li>Ganzi: Protean</li> 
                    <li>Ifrit: Ignan</li> 
                    <li>Oread: Terran</li>

                    <li>Sylph: Auran</li> 
                    <li>Tiefling: choose one of Abyssal, Daemonic, or Infernal</li>

                   <br> 
                   <h2>Guide Updates</h2> 
                   <p>In advance of the new seasons, we have some updates to the PFS and SFS Guides to Organized Play! Here are some highlights:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>In PFS2, having access to a character option (such as an item) does not make that option common in any way. This had a strange interaction with things like crafting DCs, so we’re clarifying that point to bring the rules in line with the default from the <em>Gamemastery Guide</em>. Having access means you can take/purchase that option, but that’s it.</li> 
                    <li>Relatedly, having access to a scroll does not inherently grant access to the spell on that scroll, but spellcasters can still purchase that scroll and then Learn a Spell to learn it.</li> 
                    <li>Also in PFS2, the rules about how to handle errata have been updated to bring them in line with the rules from SFS. If a feat’s prerequisites change, or it’s removed from the campaign, you may freely swap out the feat and any subsequent feats that depend on it. There were a couple of feats that changed with the recent APG errata, and this should cover the free swaps for affected players.</li> 
                    <li>For both programs, we have updated the requirements for 5-rank GMs regarding who can conduct evaluations. To better serve those GMs who live in remote areas or otherwise find it difficult to get evaluators at their tables, RVCs can now appoint qualified individuals to conduct evaluations.</li> 
                    <li>Finally, PVP combat is not permitted in Paizo Organized Play. Previously, engaging in PVP combat would earn Infamy, but Infamy is not meant to be a consequence for out-of-game behavior. You may not fight other players’ characters unless the scenario calls for it for some extremely specific reason.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Full details on all these changes, as well as some other minor changes, can be found in the relevant changelogs.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>We don’t have any new 5-rank GMs this month, so I wanted to take a moment to talk about the Campaign Service Coins! These awards are given to exceptional volunteers who go above and beyond the call of duty in service to the program. The award is a physical metal coin, stamped with the user’s brand-new three-digit Organized Play ID. If someone at your table has an Organized Play ID in the 700s or 800s, they’ve received one of these coins.</p> 
                   <p>Nominations for this award are accepted anytime. If you wish to nominate an individual, please email organizedplay@paizo.com with the recipient’s name and the ways they have gone above and beyond. As we return to physical events, I’m hoping to be able to travel more and hand some of these out, so knowing what events the nominee is traveling to helps as well. Anybody can make a nomination, and recipients are not limited to Venture Officers.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And we’ll see you at PaizoCon!</p>

Nearly every Monday, we’ll focus on a different wonderful industry creator, as an individual, including Paizo staff, freelancers, contractors, podcast players, streamers, YouTubers, licensed partners, and more. The format is a list of standardized questions from which interviewees can choose. Let’s get started!</p> 
                   <p><b>Name:</b> Patrick Renie<br> <b>Pronouns:</b> he/him<br> <b>Title (if staff):</b> Senior Developer<br> <b>Department (if staff):</b> Editorial</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What are your goals or dreams as a creator?</h3> 
                   <p>I was a very shy, quiet kid. When my nose wasn’t buried in a book or my eyes glued to a video game, my head was often simply lost in the clouds. I invented all sorts of make-believe games and had multiple imaginary friends. One of my favorite books was an illustrated children’s dictionary. My teachers wrote things like “daydreamer” and “easily distracted” on my report cards.</p> 
                   <p>Though I was a gifted writer, I struggled to compose anything longer than one or two pages. I didn’t like sports or group activities, but I knew how to give engaging presentations and I reveled in making the other kids laugh. I liked to doodle symbols and draw treasure maps in the margins of my homework. I loved to read books about sword-swinging knights and fireball-flinging wizards. Arithmetic and algebra came to me easily, but somewhere around geometry I hit a wall and basically gave up on math.</p> 
                   <p>When I discovered tabletop RPGs, it was like opening a secret door to the clockwork of my mind. These games were full of all the things I liked: stories of fantasy adventure, sketches of crazy monsters, weird dice to fiddle with. The idea of creating my own adventures—something these books not only encouraged but gave me the tools to do—felt insane and electrifying. It was like for my whole life my brain had been this strange, almost alien machine that came without any instructions, and with roleplaying games I’d finally found the missing user manual.</p> 
                   <p>Making adventures felt like a natural way to express myself. I could write stories with interesting scenery and cool villains without having to worry about protagonists’ specific motivations or settling on one ending. When I got bored with one idea, I could write about something else and come back to the first thing later. Eventually, to my astonishment, this mishmash of thoughts coalesced into something amazing—an entire world, a cohesive <em>thing</em>. It was like alchemy, or witchcraft. Once I got going, I couldn’t stop. I never stopped.</p> 
                   <p>Today, I write Pathfinder adventures for young people who don’t fit the mold: oddballs who have weird, terrific ideas and great senses of humor. I want to inspire kids who love books but maybe struggle to focus—youngsters who might not have a lot of friends but love to make people smile, or those who burst with creative energy but whose talents don’t necessarily align with one particular discipline or trade.</p> 
                   <p>If this sounds like you, then I at least hope you know you’re not alone. I know how it feels to live in a world that wasn’t designed for folks like you and me. It’s okay. We can make up our own little world instead. And in our world, everybody’s invited, no matter how much they fidget or how good they are at math or whatever it says on their report card. Anyone who wants to play is welcome.</p> 
                   <p>In our world we can say, Come on in, everybody. We’ve got sword-swinging knights and fireball-flinging wizards and all sorts of other stuff too, like clockwork brains and goblin alchemists and winter witches. We’ve got all kinds of things, so come on in, everyone. Come on in and get ready, because we’re going on an adventure.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>What’s the best creative advice you’ve ever gotten?</h3> 
                   <p>Write fearlessly. Whatever your burning idea, whatever it is you want to put into this world, it <em>will</em> resonate with someone else—that’s a statistical fact. Have you seen the stuff that’s out there? However silly you fear your idea might be, I guarantee there’s something far sillier already out there which is resonating with millions of people. There’s a guy on YouTube who makes sausages out of bubble gum, water, dirt, etc, then tastes and ranks them. It’s utterly ridiculous. I love it!</p> 
                   <p>The best thing to do as a creator, whether you’re a writer, photographer, or sausage maker, is to work on the things that excite <em>you</em>. But what is that, exactly? How do you separate what you’ve been <em>taught</em> you should want from what you <em>really</em> want? You have to find that "flow state," your personal Nirvana. Here’s how: throw your phone in a lake, bury your computer in the desert, and lock yourself in a room with just a pencil and some paper. Only when you’ve totally lost your mind in your work can you catch a glimpse of the thing at the core of it all—that dynamo hidden under your flesh and bone, the self-experiencing universe inside you, transcendence, enlightenment, the Cosmic Sausage.</p> 
                   <p>What I’m saying is: Get in the zone! Don’t think about recognition or what comes next, and definitely don’t listen to self-help gurus or motivational podcasts or wild-eyed windbags like me! It’s just you and the craft, buddy!</p> 
                   <p>If there’s any actual wisdom at all buried in my mound of prolix drivel, then here’s the <b>tl;dr</b>: when you have fun writing it, readers will have fun reading it.</p> 
                   <p>Make what you want. Forget the rest. That’s the only advice I can offer.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Please tell us about your pet!</h3> 
                   <p>My wife and I have two cats. We call them Coco and Patches. They’re the best.</p>

Can you escape Skydock aboard the vessel, or will you be caught red-handed?</p> 
                   <p>Starfinder: Pirates of Skydock places players in the roles of adventurers attempting to seize a secret vessel located on Verces. To steal the starship, players must risk it all to complete dangerous tasks before they raise suspicion. Rising to these challenges requires earning glory through heroic deeds, asking for help from your friends, and perhaps obtaining a little support from external patrons who may or may not want to remain anonymous. Adventurers can work together to accomplish their goals, but only the character who has earned the most glory at the end of the game proves they have what it takes to be captain. </p>

                   <p>During the game, adventurers scavenge for loot and mastermind cunning schemes to complete objectives—all while making sure the alarm doesn’t get raised. Should it trigger, the starship launches before the adventurers are ready to escape, stranding them aboard the vessel! By equipping gear found aboard the ship—such as stun gauntlets and auto injectors, players can upgrade their character and seize control of the ATech Immortal before it’s too late. </p>

                   <br> 
                   <h3>New Species</h3> 
                   <p>With the advent of our new year, we have five species moving to the Always Available list! As of May 27, players may create as many <b>dragonkin</b>, <b>pahtra</b>, <b>sarcesian</b>, <b>shobhad</b>, and <b>vlaka</b> characters as they like. As outlined in the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq#admittance-boon-always-available">Starfinder Society FAQ</a>, any admittance boon for these species can then be used as “Existing Character” boons to gain a boost to certain stats. The boons in the Achievement Points system have been updated to reflect this option, and you can download an updated copy now. These boons cannot be purchased after May 27.</p> 
                   <p>Dragonkin characters have the following additional rule:<br> When you create a dragonkin character, you must select another player’s character to form your partner bond with. Mark down that character’s Organized Play number on your character sheet. If that character is permanently slain, then you can select a new partner bond by marking a new Organized Play number on your character sheet between sessions.</p> 
                   <h3>New Factions</h3> 
                   <p>Three new factions have risen to prominence this year as well. The <b>Advocates</b>, <b>Cognates</b> and <b>Manifold Host</b> factions can be selected by all characters once Year 5 launches. No further boon purchases are required to champion any of these factions. Previous members of the Manifold Host faction now enjoy an expanded slate of boons and have early access to higher-tier boons by virtue of their time spent bringing the faction to prominence.</p> 
                   <h3>Raise Dead</h3> 
                   <p>This update isn’t tied to Year 5 specifically, but I figured this was as good a place as any to mention it. Recently, some of our volunteers pointed out that in the move to Achievement Points, the Raise Dead boon for the Starfinder Society required players to pay both AcP and credits to resurrect their character. As the Fame boon never required the extra credit expenditure, this was clearly an error somewhere along the line, and we apologize for it. The boon has been updated to remove this clause, and if anybody did spend credits on the boon, you may restore those credits on your next Chronicle Sheet. Thanks to those who pointed out this error!</p> 
                   <p>Now, I’ll turn it over to Jessica for some more previews of upcoming boons for Year 5. Take it away!</p>

                   <h3>New Boons</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, fellow Starfinders!  </p>
                   <p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve shared previews of our three minor factions: the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shzj?Starfinder-Society-Faction-Preview-The-Advocates">Advocates</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0a">Cognates</a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0k">Manifold Host</a>. While the Advocates and Cognates are launching with a complete slate of boons, the Manifold Host is receiving a few new boons to round out their already existing boon selection. However, our minor factions aren’t the only factions receiving new boons this coming year! All three of our Second Seekers factions are receiving two new boons, and today we’re revealing three of them! This increase brings them in line with our other major factions. Note that these boons aren’t final yet and may change slightly before release.</p> 
                   <h3>Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif)</h3> 
                   <p><b>Expert Scanner (Starship Boon):</b><br> You believe information and preparation are integral to a Starfinder’s success and have learned a few tricks to get the most out of your starship’s sensors. When you utilize a starship’s sensors, you increase the modifier granted by those sensors by 2. This doesn’t increase the range of those sensors. For example, if you’re on a starship with basic short-range sensors, you treat the sensors as having a +4 modifier, rather than a +2 modifier.</p> 
                   <p><b>Special</b>: A starship can benefit from only one copy of this Starship boon at a time.<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 15+ Reputation with Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif)<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <h3>Second Seekers (Jadnura)</h3> 
                   <p><b>Reflective Meditation (Slotless Boon):</b><br> You’ve taken Jadnura’s lessons to heart and have spent a great deal of time contemplating your place in the universe and within the Starfinder Society. Once per scenario, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to meditate on your current course for 10 minutes. When you do so, select mind or matter. If you select mind, for the duration of the next combat encounter, you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. If you select matter, for the duration of the next combat encounter, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p> 
                   <p><b>Other Notes</b>: 5+ Reputation with Second Seekers (Jadnura)<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <h3>Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo)</h3> 
                   <p><b>Experienced Diplomat (Slotless Boon):</b><br> Your time with Luwazi Elsebo has taught you how to juggle the needs of disparate parties and smooth over diplomatic missteps. Once per adventure, when you would fail at a Diplomacy check that’s written into the adventure, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll that Diplomacy check. You must use the second result.</p> 
                   <p><b>Other Notes</b>: 15+ Reputation with Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo)<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p>That’s all for now, Starfinders! I hope you join us as we launch into the Year of Redemption’s Rise!</p>

You’ll also find new haunts, as well as information about the undead-plagued lands within the Lost Omens campaign setting, perfect for adding undead to your next adventure! A massive bestiary section full of undead creatures brings more threats for GMs and summonable creatures for players, including more versions of classic undead like vampires, skeletons, and zombies.

                   <p>LIGHT THE FUSE<br> Ragtag outlaws get their hands dirty in the oil-slicked alleyways and whisky-soaked saloons of Alkenstar, the City of Smog. To enact revenge on the mogul who ruined them, these renegades must steal from the rich, take down crooked shieldmarshals, and aid a mysterious, gunslinging patron. In a city where the clockwork guards are literally as tough as brass, antiheroes will need true grit to dole out overdue justice. The Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path begins with “Punks in a Powder Keg,” a complete adventure for 1st- to 3rd-level characters.</p>

                   <p>Excerpt from the Introduction of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l/discuss&amp;page=2?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis#tabs"><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a>, continued from the excerpt in the blog, “<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0q">On the Next Paizo LIVE: Slayers and more!</a>”</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>“INFORMATION FOR EVERYONE</b><br> Whether you’re eager to play in a Drift Crisis campaign, itching to run an adventure as the game master, seeking options for other campaigns, or just delighted by Starfinder lore, Drift Crisis offers a wealth of content well-suited for everybody. </p> 
                    <p>“Chapter 1 is suitable for all readers, constructed in many ways like a traditional setting supplement with details about factions, regions, and thematic character options. This chapter introduces you to the Drift and how it works before exploring what the Drift Crisis entails—all presented as possibilities, not irrefutable facts. What exactly caused the Drift Crisis and what might resolve it can vary based on the campaign’s needs, so the information here can fuel character motivations, questions, and conspiracy theories. </p> 
                    <p>“You likely already know about Starfinder’s campaign setting (such as through Chapter 12 of the Core Rulebook), and while much of that information remains relevant, most worlds now experience new difficulties. How does Drift disruption impact the Azlanti Star Empire, whose far-flung territories are connected only by faster-than-light starships? What comes of Akiton’s failing thasteron starship fuel industry once the predominant faster-than-light travel technology becomes less attractive? How does the Veskarium respond when extraplanar material bleeds into its core star system and envelops several planets, cutting those worlds off from the empire? Articles ahead have the answers while also posing just as many new questions and adventure hooks to inspire your group. </p> 
                    <p>“Grand organizations familiar and new are also working on how to best resolve or exploit the Drift Crisis chaos. These could be key allies in your upcoming adventures, or they could be adversaries seeking an underhanded advantage at others’ expense. What do they want? And how might your characters get involved? With Drift technologies disrupted, how do starship manufacturers respond? How does the church of Triune respond when its deity isn’t answering prayers and the galaxy demands answers that Triunites should have? Why is this calamity simultaneously profitable and infuriating for the Free Captains? </p> 
                    <p>“And of course, there’s loads of what every player enjoys: exciting new character options! While these new options all tie into the Drift, catastrophes, or extraplanar power in some way, they’re well-suited for any campaign, not just for those set during the Drift Crisis. Awaken your divinatory might with the new Drift Crisis precog anchor, or start channeling extraplanar influences with new solarian revelations. Bend space with new vanguard disciplines, or alter the planar properties of your own world with the witchwarper’s plunderer of worlds alternate class features. New themes provide four great origins for your character, and new gear ensures you’re properly equipped for whatever extradimensional challenges lie ahead. Want more character content? The last page of each adventure seed in Chapter 2 includes thematic new options for PCs; if your GM is using that adventure seed to craft a campaign, though, it might be reserved as special treasure, so check with your GM about these Chapter 2 options.</p> 
                    <p>“The wonderful part about the Drift Crisis is that, because there’s no one storyline, the event caters well to a group running several campaigns simultaneously, with each story run by a different GM. Once you know which adventure hook from Chapter 2 one GM is using, you can enjoy reading the other 19 virtually spoiler-free. To help with navigating all the options, check out the player option index and general index on pages 187–188.”</p>

                   <h3>The New Era of Dungeons &amp; Lasers Begins Now</h3> 
                   <p>Our goblins are happy to announce a new product line, Pathfinder Terrain. These sets feature the most iconic places from the Pathfinder universe, starting this month with the dark and grim Abomination Vaults and traveling to farther lands in future releases. These new dungeons are also our first retail release of half-height walls which retaining full backward compatibility with our classic full-height walled sets. </p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8e315c09-8f57-420c-ae07-7a4670d8ff33/Archon_PFTerrain_01.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8e315c09-8f57-420c-ae07-7a4670d8ff33/Archon_PFTerrain_01.jpg" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Pathfinder Dungeon Terrain Piece "></a>

                   <h3>Abomination Vaults Pathfinder Terrain Design</h3> 
                   <p>Abomination Vaults is one of the most popular Pathfinder Adventures Paths ever, with a hardcover edition coming this May. The famed megadungeon is split into 3 parts, chronicling the tale of the evil sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex, her revenge and the bold heroes who venture forth to oppose her. </p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>We’ve approached this challenge open-minded, yet focused on the lore and story. Our Art Director, Tomasz Badalski, says:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>“First thing that came to my mind was the abomination angle of the design. How to make a dungeon that clearly says, “We reject all that’s natural and give ourselves to all kinds of heresy and evil rituals?” That’s why you’ll notice good-ol’ tentacles on the walls and evil-eyes overseeing the adventuring party. Even the metal door ornaments are looking more like veins on living, cursed organisms than a piece of engineering. How cool is that?”</p> 
                   </blockquote>

                   </div> 
                   <h3>Half-height Walls Enter the Game</h3> 
                   <p>The most noticeable feature of Abomination Vaults Pathfinder Terrains are the new half-height walls, designed to make it even easier to handle miniatures inside of the dungeon. These half-height walls stand roughly 25 millimeters, or 1 inch, tall. They are also much thicker than in previous packs. Doorways are kept at 50 millimeters/2-inch height to make it easier to locate them during the game.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/11be1496-3d0e-4e45-8831-c4fff2891c4c/Archon_PFTerrain_04.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/11be1496-3d0e-4e45-8831-c4fff2891c4c/Archon_PFTerrain_04.jpg" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Pathfinder Dungeon Terrain Piece"></a>

                   <h3>Open Functional Doors!</h3> 
                   <p>What do both Game Masters and mimics love? Yes, that’s right—doors. For the first time, we’ve implemented a functional door in the Dungeons &amp; Lasers line. It works using a push and fit system, allowing you to open and rotate the door or remove it from the doorway altogether if you don’t need it. Also, doorways are aligned with the grid, for all you tactic-loving fighters!</p>

                   <h3>All the Extra Bits Included</h3> 
                   <p>Abomination Vaults Pathfinder Terrains come with extra set pieces that will help you customize your dungeon. Columns are a perfect all-rounder when it comes to removing a single tile from the map and blocking a line of sight at the same time if you need that. A small pile of rubble works great as a blockade. Some walls also include special holes to place torchlights you will find in your set.</p>

                   <h3>Dwarven Mine</h3> 
                   <p>Our second release this month is Dwarven Mine, terrain set in the wet and dark depths of mountains, where Dwarves used to have a lot of fun. Now the place is abandoned - or is it? </p> 
                   <p>Dwarven Mine also features half-height walls, functional and grid-aligned doors, and extra customization bits. Fully compatible with Abomination Vaults and with the classic full-height walled Dungeons &amp; Lasers sets.</p> 
                   <h3>Next Pathfinder Terrain Pack?</h3> 
                   <p>What awaits those who manage to survive the adventures in Abomination Vaults? Our Dungeon Lords are keeping the secrets for themselves, but they gave us a hint - can you guess the next Pathfinder Terrain release?</p>

                   <p><b>Bigby</b><br> Bigby is some kind of mysterious chihuahua mix—he has yet to inform us of his exact origin. We adopted Bigby shortly after I started working at Paizo, right around the first PaizoCon I was slated to attend. And he’s been my constant companion ever since. Thanks to all my colleagues who helped get him a little more accustomed to people over these years… though the Prozac didn’t hurt. He still doesn’t trust strangers, so if you see us walking around Redmond, give us a wave from a distance!</p>

                   <p>Hilda is most likely a Turkish Angora, though you wouldn’t have thought so when we rescued her, underweight with short hair we had no idea how much floof we were in for. She’s about four years old now, slightly overweight, and is as sweet as can be but makes the most adorable grumpy noises. Jura is an American Shorthair kitten we rescued a few months back, he’s about seven months old and is firmly in the ‘terrorizing everyone and everything’ phase. His energy has been a wonderful addition, he’s helping Hilda get more exercise, and keeping us entertained with his antics. Hilda has been skeptical of the little ball of energy but if you can wear him out so he’s not trying to play fight they will lay together, and even clean each other.</p>

                   <p>I adopted Jude in 2010 and he met his furry brother Dino when they moved in together in 2012. They’re both considered senior cats these days; Dino—pronounced like “dinosaur”—will be 15 next month and Jude will be 13 in August. Jude started out as a terribly shy and quiet cat but has come out of his shell and learned how to yell for food and attention from his brother. Dino likes to chase shadows and sometimes his own tail. He’s greedy for attention and scritches, but beware of his soft, fuzzy belly—we call it the bear trap!</p>

                   <p>This is Nova! She’s been a cranky old lady since she was one and is now pushing the ripe old age of five. She’s a sweetie who loves cuddling on your lap on cold days (mostly to steal your warmth) and chasing after toys. She also tries to get outside all the time and needs to stop meowing at me because it’s not going to happen.</p>

As the Starfinders bemoan being left behind, a massive, monstrous starship attacks Absalom Station, destroying parts of the Armada and reigning destruction down on the Station. Helmed by Historia-Prime and featuring some familiar foes, it’s up to the Starfinders to enter the nanite starship, confront Historia-Prime, and put an end to the Data Scourge!

                   <p>Hail, Pathfinders! Port Valen requires a steady supply of heroes! Who better to provide them than the Pathfinder Society?</p> 
                   <p>In the far northern reaches of Arcadia, the Pathfinder Society has come to an agreement with a fey guardian from the Forest of Trials. This guardian agrees to allow the Pathfinders to maintain a mystical portal connecting to their other lodges via the Maze of the Open Road. The guardian has one condition: to earn their favor, the Pathfinder Society must regularly send agents to perform heroic deeds!</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0n?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-313-Guardians-Covenant"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-13: Guardian’s Covenant</em></a> is a repeatable adventure for levels 3–6, written by veteran author Christopher Wasko. You can earn full credit for playing this repeatable adventure with as many different characters as you like. The adventure includes a variety of missions, as well as guidance for GMs to select the missions suitable for their group. Some of the missions have multiple variations, allowing for continued enjoyment (and some surprises!) on subsequent play-throughs.</p> 
                   <p>Our second Pathfinder Society scenario in April continues the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0o?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-314-The-Tomb-Between-Worlds"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-14: The Tomb Between Worlds</em></a> is an adventure for levels 5–8 written by Jacob W. Michaels, another veteran freelancer. In this adventure, we return to Sothis, the capital of Osirion, where undead have been surging up from the basement of a Pathfinder Society lodge! Once again, the Society calls on some of its most experienced agents to fight back against this threat. This time, their adventure takes them to the mysterious Tomb Between Worlds. The stakes are high, and leaders from the Horizon Hunters and Vigilant Seal factions have traveled to Sothis to advise the Pathfinders on their expedition.</p> 
                   <p>Will our intrepid explorers return from the strange tomb? I hope so, because the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries isn’t over yet, and we’ll be needing them again soon!</p> 
                   <p>As always: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, players! With the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a> release coming next week, we wanted to take a moment to talk about sanctioning content. The rulebook resulted in a fair amount of discussion internally, and we thought it was a good idea to take a step back and look at how our sanctioning works.</p> 
                   <h2>Why We Sanction Content</h2> 
                   <p>Regularly, the OP team is asked (directly or indirectly) why we sanction content. After all, other campaigns just let people play whatever they want whenever they want, so why don’t we? While that would be a lot less work, it’s important to us that the campaign remains as balanced and fair as possible. One of the hallmarks of Paizo Organized Play is that no matter what table you’re playing at worldwide, the players at the table are all playing with the same general rules and power level.</p> 
                   <p>To that end, there are three main reasons why we might ban or restrict an option in the campaign these days:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li><b>It’s evil</b>. Evil options are banned by default in the campaign, so any evil deities are right out. This extends to options that have evil or unsavory flavor to them; in Book of the Dead, for example, there’s a familiar that’s made with the blood of a murder victim. That’s a little beyond the pale for us, so it’s not likely to be allowed.</li> 
                    <li><b>It’s unbalanced</b>. This one is pretty rare in Pathfinder Society these days and is much more likely to come up in Starfinder Society. Still, occasionally options sneak through that skew the power balance and require us to bring down the metaphorical banhammer.</li> 
                    <li><b>There’s too much GM adjudication</b>. These sorts of options are great for home campaigns where you can work with your GM to either determine their ruling for an unclear rule, or set up a legendary quest to obtain your one-of-a-kind soulforged armor. However, in a global campaign where the Organized Play staff is the GM, some of these options require too much adjudication to ensure a uniform table experience.</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p>There are other reasons why an option might be removed, of course, but these are the three major ones. To that end, let’s talk about <em>Book of the Dead</em>.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/29ae4d63-fcbf-4d12-9158-afc19dda8c4b/PZO2110_OrdelliaWhilwren.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/29ae4d63-fcbf-4d12-9158-afc19dda8c4b/PZO2110_OrdelliaWhilwren.jpg" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A ghostly female cleric of Desna"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Book of the Dead</h2> 
                   <p>Let’s start with the bad news: the playable undead options won’t be available in the campaign when the book is released next week. We discussed them extensively during our sanctioning review, and ultimately we decided that, for now, they aren’t going to be accessible. This is due to a combo of some of the reasons we discussed above: there are balance concerns with some of them, but all of them come with a little bit more evil than we’re comfortable with. </p> 
                   <p>Consider the zombie archetype, which requires a zombie to consume the brain of one sentient creature per day. This has a little too much potential to disrupt scenarios in our view; we certainly don’t want to incentivize players to attack otherwise friendly NPCs just to get their daily serving of brains, and not all players will be comfortable with the idea of a fellow PC chowing down on a recently-defeated enemy spellcaster.</p> 
                   <p>Despite the existence of playable undead options, the design team has confirmed that undead are still pretty uniformly evil, and universally still abhorrent to the natural cycle of life in Golarion. Certainly there are options for PCs that are both undead and neutral, but with this guidance from the design team, we felt it was best to keep the undead in the ground for the moment. All that being said, we’ve got a plan to integrate the skeleton ancestry early in PFS Year 4, so start saving your Achievement Points and stay tuned for that information. It’s also possible that some of the less-problematic undead archetypes might see play as the result of actions in a scenario, or as a charity boon sent out to conventions.</p> 
                   <p>As a point of good news, we’ll be sanctioning the adventure contained within the book, “March of the Dead,” for Pathfinder Society credit in adventure mode! We’re trying something a little new with this one; we felt the adventure was longer than one session of play, but shorter than a full adventure, so this adventure will provide credit for two sessions worth of XP, treasure and Reputation. The chronicle can be applied to any of your Pathfinder Society characters. Let us know how it goes and if this level of credit is useful or if it just causes you problems.</p> 
                   <h2>Closing Reminders &amp; Updates</h2> 
                   <p>During our discussions on the undead-related options as a whole, a couple of recurring topics came up that we wanted to remind players of or clarify.</p> 
                   <p>First of all, evil characters are prohibited in the campaign. This extends beyond alignment; your characters should be willing and capable of working together with a group to complete your mission. Your characters should not disrupt play by randomly attacking other characters or NPCs, performing evil actions, or otherwise causing chaos unless such chaos is both warranted within the scenario and enjoyed by all at the table, including the GM. As options with eviler flavor come into the campaign, such as undead companions and eidolons, players should maintain the same level of respect and decorum. “But it’s what my character would do!” is not justification for mayhem and disrespect.</p> 
                   <p>Second of all, a character <b>never</b> violates their anathema simply by joining a mission. This has come up before with superstition instinct barbarians, but once again, the undead threaten to disrupt this. Characters that follow Pharasma or other deities that abhor undead are not obligated to immediately smite a skeleton PC or a ghostly animal companion. The gods will not bring down righteous fury simply because you were unlucky enough to sit at the wrong table. (Now, if you encounter different skeletons in a tomb and don’t smite them, <em>then</em> Pharasma will be very displeased.)</p> 
                   <p>We hope you enjoy playing with the options in <em>Book of the Dead</em> that are sanctioned when it’s released next week. There are still plenty of legal options for those players who want to more effectively fight against undead as well as those who want to give their characters a bit more undead flavor. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And don’t forget to check under your bed!</p>

                    <p><b>Running a Knights of Lastwall Campaign</b><br> Campaigns that centrally feature the Knights of Lastwall can take many forms. The most obvious is a clash with the Whispering Way—necromancers who believe undeath is the apex of existence, from whose ranks the Whispering Tyrant arose—or other undead powers, from local malefactors to vampire barons or mummy pharaohs. This could be a glorious crusade or a desperate guerrilla war.</p> 
                    <p>While the knights are a focused group with a specific goal, this doesn’t mean they’re suited only for campaigns involving undead powers. The order’s mission is to promote good, stop evil, and gather allies, and this is conducive to many urban-focused games. Knights in a city might navigate the web of local politics to stop a tyrant’s rise or a secret cult, all while recruiting squires and securing noble support for the cause.</p> 
                    <p>Knights can appear in other campaigns as well. Many knight recruiters travel alone or with a retainer and might join other heroes to aid in their noble goals. Likewise, the organization and its members are far-ranging enough they might offer aid where player characters are members of an allied or sympathetic organization, like the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse">Magaambya</a>, or simply good folk doing good deeds.</p> 
                    <p>The Knights of Lastwall are a friendly and accepting lot, but players might face them as foes. Particularly chaos-prone or destructive Firebrands, Gorumites, or Calistrians—or, conversely, particularly stringent or oppressive Hellknights or Abadarans— might come into conflict with the knights until they repent their ways and repair their harms. If the player characters are outright villains, the knights will be even more intent on stopping them. Woe betides a party of Whispering Way adherents should the knights catch them</p>

                    <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> 
                    <p>Over 300 years ago, the machine god Triune revealed itself to the galaxy and granted all who would listen a priceless gift: faster-than-light technology using the hyperspace realm now known as the Drift. Within decades, Drift travel had opened the galaxy to exploration, trade, and conquest on a previously unfathomable scale. Empires span multiple star systems. Companies ship essential products to countless worlds. Explorers cast off into the unknown to meet unfamiliar species and uncover wonders. Vacationers eagerly embark to reach distant attractions. And overall the galaxy has achieved prosperity and possibility, all thanks to the Drift.</p> 
                    <p>So, what if, for reasons few could predict, the Drift just... broke?</p> 
                    <p>In that instant, starships traveling the Drift are hurled about, landing in random and often perilous destinations (even on different planes altogether). Drift travel becomes more difficult, with each voyage taking longer, encountering frequent dangers, and sometimes failing altogether. Even long-range communication, which relied on the Drift to span the galaxy, fails, leaving worlds isolated in ways they haven’t experienced in centuries. Governments, civilians, scientists, and faiths all clamor for answers, yet Triune seems mysteriously absent.</p> 
                    <p>Welcome to the Drift Crisis, a galaxy-wide calamity instigated when the Drift experiences a catastrophic failure. Unlike most Starfinder adventures published to date, <em>Drift Crisis</em> isn’t a single story told through a single group of heroes; it’s an event that spans countless worlds as the galaxy scrambles to make sense of the crisis, restore order, and repair the damage to an essential plane. Simultaneously, it’s a time of chaos as opportunists prey upon vulnerable neighbors, oppressed worlds overthrow their compromised tyrants, and zealots preach the downfall of technology to frightened masses.</p> 
                    <p>Indeed, <em>Drift Crisis</em> isn’t a single story—it’s a framework for telling innumerable stories. In this book, you’ll find 20 exciting adventure seeds that explore different angles of the Drift Crisis, letting player characters aid victims, rebuild damaged worlds, take down once-untouchable villains, travel to exciting realms, and even reshape the galaxy. And this book isn’t alone. Drift Crisis forms the core of a larger narrative event presented by Paizo, including <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath">Adventure Paths</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/standaloneAdventures/starfinderAdventures">Starfinder Adventures</a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/standaloneAdventures/starfinderOneShots">Starfinder One-Shots</a> that all present different angles of the Drift Crisis. Enjoy these on their own or use them to springboard your own Drift Crisis campaign!</p>

                    <p><b><em>BOOK OF THE DEAD</em> IN YOUR GAME</b><br> You can incorporate <em>Book of the Dead</em> into a campaign to give it a strong undead theme, using the options from Chapter 1 for a group that wants to slay undead or those from Chapter 2 to play undead, get undead animal companions, or otherwise access the tools of undeath for players. Many of these options aren’t suitable for all games, making them uncommon or rare accordingly.</p> 
                    <p>The creatures in Chapter 3 can be adversaries in all kinds of games. Many of them have additional options for expansion or adjustments to make them more versatile, and you’ll also find undead adjustments to quickly make zombie ogres, vampiric monkeys, ghost hobgoblins, or any other kinds of undead creatures you might need for your game!</p> 
                    <p>The sections of world lore in this book can be interesting whether you’re a player, Game Master, or reader. Chapter 4 contains the highest concentration of lore, but there’s some in other chapters, including details from Geb’s notes on some iconic undead creatures in Chapter 3.</p>

                      <p><b>Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon</b><br> Down a minor side street in the grimy, smog-clogged Ferrous Quarter of Alkenstar lies a squat, nondescript, two-story building whose weathered sign reads “The Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon. Drinks—Meals—Fireproof Rooms.” Its dingy white plaster and off-center porch encourage the refined guest to look elsewhere. Indeed, the cosmopolitan traveler who does venture inside is likely to be greeted with derogatory comments from a goggle-clad goblin inventor or by rude stares from a hard-drinking patron long since mutated by the wild magic of the Mana Wastes. To mitigate this reception the dwarven gunslinger behind the bar, Foebe Dunsmith, is always ready to share a welcoming word and drink on the house. Even so, this is the kind of bar where an introduction—or a good deal of diplomatic hard work—is necessary to navigate the dwarven desperados, goblin grenadiers, irascible inventors, and hard-drinking hoodlums who make up the unruly crowd of regulars. Jumping into a high-stakes game of bootbeer (an unexplainably popular guessing game in which players try to hide as much beer on their person as possible) or wagering on a hand of cards can win friends, but it can just as easily make enemies. And no night at the Barrel &amp; Bullet seems complete without at least one knock-down, drag-out barfight!</p>

                   <h2>Joining the Manifold Host</h2> 
                   <p>The Manifold Host is a minor faction established in 2019 which required a specific boon to join. This boon was rather hard to come by, which kept the reach of the Manifold Host small. Thanks to First Seeker Ehu Hadif’s efforts to amplify the voices of those normally ignored or overlooked within the Starfinder Society, the Manifold Host has seen an increase in enrollment. Beginning in the Year of Redemption’s Rise, the Manifold Host is available to all players. Any Starfinder Society character can represent the Manifold Host, just as they would any other faction.</p>

                   <h2>The Manifold Host</h2> 
                   <p>The Starfinder Society’s reputation for multiculturalism is due in no small part to the Manifold Host, who’ve long made it their mission to welcome all people, no matter their species or origin, into the Society. Members of the Manifold Host champion strength in diversity and the unique talents, interests, and outlooks of the Society’s agents. Believing differences should be celebrated and embraced, the Manifold Host works to recruit agents from all alien species into the Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>Faction Leader</b>: Harmony of Many (NG barathu mechanic). Harmony of Many is a collective of six component barathus (all Starfinders) who merged into one being nearly fifty years ago. Shortly after their merging, Harmony of Many took over leadership of the Manifold Host faction. Very rarely, one of Harmony of Many’s barathu components splits from the group, usually to meet off-station with an alien community, though they reintegrate with Harmony of Many at the first opportunity. This traveling diplomat is usually Lilting Song (NG barathu envoy), a linguist and historian fluent in dozens of languages.</p> 
                   <p><b>Motto</b>: We who welcome all.</p> 
                   <p><b>Objectives</b>: Functioning as recruitment officers and an enthusiastic welcoming committee, members of the Manifold Host are dedicated to inducting new species into the Starfinder Society in the belief that each alien species can contribute their own new and unique skills to the benefit of all. Additionally, they welcome new agents of all kinds, and aid them in acclimating to the Society’s operations.</p> 
                   <p><b>Year 5 Goal</b>: The Manifold Host endeavors to shield new agents from the recent upheaval and infighting within the Starfinder Society, ensuring they feel welcome and safe, and are set up for success.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Boons</b>: Like all our factions, the Manifold Host has a slate of boons available for purchase with Achievement Points by members of the Manifold Host faction with the appropriate amount of Reputation. At present, the Manifold Host has fewer boons than our other Starfinder Society factions. With the launch of Year 5, additional boons will be added to the Manifold Host, rounding out and completing their boon options. Today, we reveal one of these new boons! Note that this boon is not yet final, and may change slightly before release.</p> 
                   <p><b>Linguistic Decoder (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You have friends from all over the galaxy and have been exposed to countless languages. This linguistic exposure has made you adept at decoding messages. You reduce the DC of Culture checks to decipher writing by 5.<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 25+ Reputation with Manifold Host<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p>I hope you enjoyed this sneak peek at the Manifold Host minor faction!</p> 
                   <p>Take care, Starfinders!</p>

                   <h3>Guest of Honor</h3> 
                   <p>We are very pleased to announce longtime Paizo freelancer Vanessa Hoskins as our Guest of Honor for this PaizoCon. She will be appearing on several livestreams and events. Keep an eye on our schedule for more information. If you haven’t gotten a chance to meet Vanessa, here’s a bit about her:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p>Vanessa Hoskins got her start in the RPG industry in 2013 by writing monster blogs and other 3rd party work for 2 years. Her first Paizo release was 2015's "From Under Ice," a Pathfinder Society scenario. Since then, she’s written several small-form adventures for Pathfinder and Starfinder Society, including the groundbreaking evergreen adventure "From the Tome of Righteous Repose." She's authored numerous adventure paths including Starfinder's <em>The Cradle Infestation</em> (#29), Pathfinder's <em>Hand of the Devil</em> (#164), and <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar</em> (#178). Vanessa has contributed to numerous rules systems, player options, and other game mechanics for Paizo across the Pathfinder and Starfinder systems. In addition to serving on the board of directors at the Know Direction Network, she is a host of the Know Direction podcast and stars in their <em>Adventurous!</em> actual play. She is a cast member for the <em>Fall of Plaguestone</em> and <em>Three Ring Adventure</em> actual plays on Roll for Combat. Vanessa co-authors Vellum &amp; Lace, the first piece of serialized Pathfinder fiction on Pathfinder Infinite, with Helen Savore. Finally, she's recently started Ninja Cat Games, an indie video game studio. She does all of this while living in upstate New York with her brilliant wife and their adorable cat.</p>

                   <h3>Hotel Block</h3> 
                   <p>The physical convention is being held at the<a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/ctac-dt-doubletree-seattle-airport/?SEO_id=GMB-AMER-DT-CTACDT&amp;y_source=1_MTM3Mjc4Ni03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24ud2Vic2l0ZQ%3D%3D]DoubleTree Sea-Tac">DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Seattle Airport</a>. To book a room in the Paizo block, follow <a href="https://book.passkey.com/go/PZC22"> this link</a> or call their toll-free reservation number at (800) 222-TREE (that is, (800) 222-8733) and reference the group code <b>PZC</b> or group name <b>PaizoCon</b>. Be sure to book your room soon, as spaces are limited.</p> 
                   <h3>Tickets</h3> 
                   <p>When we decided to do a physical PaizoCon, we knew it needed to be a smaller show than in prior years. We set the number of attendees at 500, not including staff, organized play GMs, and partner guests. We hoped this would balance safety concerns with our ability to deliver a great show. Unfortunately, with our reduced cap for the physical show, we have no tickets available at this time. We continue to reach out to ticketholders and process refunds and will update if we do get inventory to sell, but at this time it looks unlikely.</p> 
                   <p>The good news is that there are plenty of tickets for PaizoCon Online and they are available now! You can purchase them <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d6d?PaizoCon-2022-Online-Badge">by clicking here</a> and add them to your cart.</p> 
                   <h3>Schedule</h3> 
                   <p>We’re currently putting the final touches on our streaming schedule and will be posting it to the <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-2022">PaizoCon Warhorn event listing</a> as well as putting an image up on the <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon website</a> once available. With the streaming schedule finalized, we will shift our focus onto polishing up the physical show schedule so it can be uploaded as well. It is our goal to have all these schedules put in-place well before event registration occurs.</p> 
                   <h3>Event Registration</h3> 
                   <p>Thank you all so much for your patience. The signup dates for games have been revised as follows:</p> 
                   <p><b>Wednesday, May 4, 2022 9:00 AM</b>: Early GM signups open to qualifying GMs<br> <b>Friday, May 6, 2022 9:00 AM</b>: Player signups open to Warhorn VIP members<br> <b>Saturday, May 7, 2022 9:00 AM</b>: Player signups open to all players, including Author tables<br> <b>Monday, May 9, 2022 9:00 AM</b>: Seats at in-person VIP tables open to all</p> 
                   <p>Let us know in the comments what other questions, if any, we can answer for you. Looking forward to seeing everyone online or at the physical show!</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>I had so much to tell you about <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shza?For-My-Best-Customer#discuss"></a>, I know you can’t have not forgotten the marvels that await you, like the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0j?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead"><em>Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a>. But I heard through the leshy-vine that you wanted to know about those <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3a/discuss&amp;page=last?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Knights-of-Lastwall">Knights of Lastwall</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Well, actually it was from fungus leshys, not the vine leshys. You know they may not be the brightest, but my fungi friends know the all the best sources for hard-to-acquire ingredients. And they help me around those inflationary black-market prices? Black market? More like blackmail-market! That’s why it is so important to have alternate sources.</p> 
                   <p>But where was I? Oh, yes! I shudder to think why anyone would enjoy learning about those Knights of Lastwall do-gooders. If you ask me, they’re a bunch of losers who don’t know when to quit. Why do you want to know about them when you could be making <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/outlawsOfAlkenstar">inroads with Alkenstar</a> or, even better, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/bloodLords">boning up on the Blood Lords</a>. (Get it? Boning up on the… oh, never mind.) Maybe you want to know more about your enemies and their weaknesses? You’ve always been so shrewd, that must be the reason!</p> 
                   <p>So, let’s sit and take a closer look, shall we, dearie? </p> 
                   <p>Here we have cover art of Kalabrynne Iomedar, advisor to the Knights of Lastwall and paladin of Iomedae by Ekaterina Burmak. So, right away you know this will be written from a very different perspective than say, Geb’s latest, the Book of the Dead. The style is very “pro-living,” rather than “not-yet-dead.” But given the way they live, what’s the difference?</p> 
                   <p>Meh. The follies of youth, right, dearie?</p>

                   <p>We’re told Kalabrynne Iomedar “doesn’t live on the battlefield like most knights. Instead, her home is among the training grounds and war rooms of the knights, fostering the skills of new knights and veterans alike while offering her wisdom in the ongoing campaign against the Whispering Tyrant.” </p> 
                   <p>Bless her heart, and good luck with that. That’s what I say, dearie.</p> 
                   <p>Moving on. I managed to smuggle, er, acquire excerpts from the Introduction. Don’t ask how.</p> 
                   <p>“Welcome to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3a"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Knights of Lastwall</em></a>! This book takes an in-depth look at one of the newest organizations to arise in the Age of Lost Omens, the stalwart and virtuous Knights of Lastwall. These knights in shining armor dedicate their lives to protecting the innocent, defeating evil, and bringing light to the darkest corners of their world. The Knights of Lastwall help those in need and inspire hope across the Inner Sea, championing good wherever they go.”</p>

This chapter includes in-depth information on life as a knight and how the order relates to other groups in the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/setting">Lost Omens setting</a>, such as the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society</a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse">Magaambya academy</a>.</p>

                   <p> “Chapter 2 discusses individual knights, how they organize themselves, and whose example each knight seeks to follow. Details include the major and minor factions a knight might belong to within the order, such as the forward-thinking and inspiring Shining Sentinels and the cunning and passionate Crimson Reclaimers. Entries list faiths common among the knights and provide a deeper look at the reclaimers’ enigmatic Crimson Oath, the source from which knights reclaimant draw their mystical powers. The section concludes with information about particularly notable Knights of Lastwall: heroic leaders, wandering recruiters, enigmatic wizards, and more.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“Chapter 3 showcases the mechanical side of the order. Here you will find new feats for your favorite classes and archetypes, including expansions on the knight reclaimant, knight vigilant, and Lastwall sentry archetypes presented in previous publications. This section also includes new magic items and mundane equipment for your characters to use against the forces of evil. A selection of new spells discovered, devised, or distributed by the knights concludes this section. </p>

                   <p>“Chapter 4 looks at the Knights of Lastwall in the context of the Lost Omens setting, focusing on relevant regions of Golarion and the knights’ endeavors there. From undead-plagued ruins of Lastwall, now called the Gravelands, to the demon-scarred wastes of Sarkoris, where a previous knightly crusade drove out an incursion from the Abyss, the Knights of Lastwall can be found all over the Inner Sea.”</p> 
                   <p>Now, let me point out that the chapter art depicts the rescue of an orphan, then their indoctrination into knighthood over many years. Subtle propaganda at its finest, dearie, don’t you think? </p> 
                   <p>Well, all this must convince you that <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3a/discuss&amp;page=2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Knights-of-Lastwall#tabs"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Knights of Lastwall</em></a> is a must-have. But just in case, I’ve heard rumors that exclusive author interviews and previews are in the works.</p> 
                   <p>Until then, how about a bottle of Tomb Juice™? It only costs a copper, guaranteed. A toast to a very long existence and to my best customer!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">It’s no secret that the past two years have been hard on the program. One w¬ay we’ve seen this most clearly is in convention support. Prior to the pandemic, we would send out support to hundreds of events worldwide; obviously, mass gatherings have been in short supply since then. Last year was our smallest year since we started keeping records in 2016.</p> 
                   <p>However, I can see the ecosystem starting to return. As of this week, I have nearly all the events through May submitted, and we’ll be sending out support to <em>double</em> the number of events I had at this time last year. Summer is typically our busiest time, and I can’t wait to see how many more I get. It’s a positive sign in a time when we could all use some good news!</p> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available April 27, 2022:</p>

                   <h2>Major Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>Volunteer applications are now open for both PaizoCon and Gen Con Indy! GMs are accepted on a rolling basis for both, so if you’re interested in GMing or volunteering, make sure to head over to their respective blogs and fill out the forms.</p> 
                   <p>PaizoCon GM selections will close <b>this Saturday, April 9</b>; after this point, GM schedules can only be changed with the organizing committee’s approval. Player signups will open to GMs on Wednesday, April 13th; to Warhorn VIPs on April 15; and to all players on April 16. Unfortunately I have no new information to share on badge sales; please <a href="mailto:paizocon@paizo.com" target="_blank">email paizocon@paizo.com</a> with any such questions.</p> 
                   <p>For Gen Con Indy, our soft cutoff for GMs is <b>April 30</b>. GMs may sign up after this date, but there’s no guarantee you’ll be considered for a room or be able to sign up for more than a backup GM slot. We have no information on Gen Con Online at this time; once we hear more from the Gen Con staff, we’ll be sure to let you know.</p> 
                   <p>We can’t wait to see you all at PaizoCon and Gen Con this year!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>We’ve been hard at work in the sanctioning mines this month! First up, we sanctioned the <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Sanctioning/Tyrant's+Grasp+Sanctioning.pdf"><em>Tyrant’s Grasp</em> Adventure Path</a> for Pathfinder Society (first edition). This will be the final content sanctioned for First Edition; while we intend to leave reporting open indefinitely, we won’t be providing any new content for the campaign at this stage. Thank you all for your patience as we got through the final pieces!</p> 
                   <p>For Pathfinder Society (second edition), we sanctioned the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/questForTheFrozenFlame"><em>Quest for the Frozen Flame</em> Adventure Path</a>. There are also two boons for the Pine Leshy Heritage in the Achievement Points store: one for all players, and a discounted version for those who play through the AP. Quit needling us about it!</p> 
                   <p>Starfinder Society got sanctioning for the third one-shot, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c33?Starfinder-OneShot-3-System-Takedown"><em>System Takedown</em></a>, which can be applied to a character of any level.</p> 
                   <p>Looking ahead, we have sanctioning for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0j?Pathfinder-Book-of-the-Dead"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a> ready to go for its street date, and we’ll have a blog on the topic later in the month. We’re also working on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3a?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Knights-of-Lastwall"><em>Lost Omens: Knights of Lastwall</em></a>, as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/horizonsOfTheVast"><em>Horizons of the Vast</em></a> Adventure Path and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c7l?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Drift Crisis</em></a> for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we completed our second hat trick, with one new 5-rank GM in each program!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Steven Crow<br> <b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Jocelyn Hamilton<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Nicholas Ruchlewicz</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <h2>Conventions</h2> 
                   <p>As I mentioned above, we have a ton of events planned in the next few months! Check out our conventions calendar and see if there’s an event near you. There are some great events happening around Memorial Day weekend, so if you can’t make it out to PaizoCon, you might find a local group near you!</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the spring sunshine!</p>

                   <h2>HOME, SWEET HOME</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“Droven?”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> 
                   <p>“Home’s good, Droven.”</p> 
                   <p>Droven was taking time to reacquaint himself with the city that had been home for most of his life. Today, as most days since his return, the inventor made his way along the streets of Absalom, a covered wicker basket held in his right hand. As expected, no sooner had Droven’s metal-shod feet hit the cobblestones then Fumbus materialized alongside him, the quiet patter of the goblin’s wide feet slapping counterpoint to Droven’s own clanking footsteps.</p> 
                   <p>Today, Fumbus wore a suspiciously guilty look on his face, and Droven had chosen to alter his normal route, which typically brought him down to the Puddles where he delivered muffins and stories to some of the local children. Instead, the half-orc inventor led his mechanical companion Whirp and Fumbus through the markets of the Coins district, waiting for Fumbus to own up to whatever had the goblin so worked up.</p> 
                   <p>Droven suspected that Fumbus had borrowed or accidentally destroyed something valuable in the Pathfinder Society’s Grand Lodge and was worried that the lodge’s steward, Ambrus Valsin, would punish him for it. Fumbus had an excessive reverence for the Pathfinder Society, and the mutton-chopped old venture-captain had a particular talent for inspiring fear in the goblin without actually doing anything to him at all.</p> 
                   <p>Upon realizing that Fumbus was unlikely to broach the subject of his distress without prompting, Droven finally asked, “So what happened this time?”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus sheepishly explained that a piece had come off an astrolabe in one of the Grand Lodge’s smaller libraries, completely by accident of course! Before Fumbus could fix it, he’d heard the voice of an irate Valsin echoing down the halls and had fled in search of a certain inventor who the goblin assumed could set everything right.</p> 
                   <p>Droven suppressed a smile and was about to tell Fumbus he could indeed fix the astrolabe when he realized he’d lost track of Whirp. Turning, he the mechanical “goblin” dashing down the street, chasing a bouncing metal gear. Droven didn’t need to see Fumbus worriedly poking a finger through the hole in his jacket pocket to realize where the gear had come from. Nor did he need to dwell on the chaos a goblin-sized construct might cause barreling through a crowded marketplace.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/04de3681-a125-4f90-ac84-8677944354fc/GnGFiction-2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/04de3681-a125-4f90-ac84-8677944354fc/GnGFiction-2.jpg" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A small mechanical goblin runs through a crowded city street chasing a gear as it rolls along the gutter. The goblin alchemist Fumbus and half-orc inventor Droven are chatting in the background."></a> 
                    <p>Whirp lets a gear get away from him in this illustration by Roberto Pitturru from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a></p> 
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“Whirp, wait!”</p>
                   <p> </p>
                   <p>Droven’s command was swallowed by the bustle of the streets, and neither he nor Fumbus stopped to see if the construct heard him. Nodding to Fumbus, Droven dashed to get between a trundling cart loaded with what looked to be expensive pottery and the single-minded construct chasing a shiny new “toy.” Fumbus yanked out a new bomb he’d been formulating following his time in Arcadia, this one loaded with black flecks of magnetic stone. With a slightly belated call to “look up,” Fumbus heaved the bomb between Whirp and the bouncing gear, the magnetic burst from the bomb halting Whirp in its tracks and pulling the gear to a stop right in front of the construct. After Whirp calmly sat down and picked up the now-immobile gear, Droven quickly retrieved the part and slid it into a sturdy pocket of his leather bandolier, reassuring Fumbus that all would be set right when they returned to the lodge.</p> 
                   <p>“Now that that’s… sorted, I believe we have some friends wondering where we are.” </p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <p>“Fumbus! Droven! WHIRP!” The cries came from a bevy of young children who called the alleys and gutters of Absalom their home. Droven had made a habit of visiting these urchins between Absalom’s Puddles district and the nearby bustling docks. They were mostly young humans left to run wild while their parents focused on putting food on the table, though a halfling girl was their apparent leader and a goblin boy was, Droven suspected, the culprit who kept turning various bits of castoff garbage into decidedly unsafe toys.</p> 
                   <p>Three of the little waifs clambered up Droven’s side, and the half-orc smilingly obliged them by holding his prosthetic limb straight out so they could hang from it like grubby, adorable fruit. Another goblin child took Whirp by the hand and began showing the inquisitive construct her collection of shiny rocks. As Droven calmly took back several of his tools that had somehow found their way into the pockets of the children hanging from his mechanical arm, he listened to Fumbus tell everyone the story of their voyage across the Arcadian Ocean, as he had several times over the last few weeks.</p> 
                   <p>“Fumbus and Droven make powerful engine. WHOOSH! We fly across the waves! A huge serpent, bigger than ten ships, rises up out of the water. RAARGH! Ezren magics up a blast of wind and WHIPPOW! We zip past it…”</p> 
                   <p>As much as Droven hated to interrupt his friend’s story, the inventor noticed that several of the children were growing increasingly more interested in the covered basket Droven held.</p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps a snack for our friends and a drink to keep our storyteller’s voice from going hoarse, eh?”</p> 
                   <p>The children squealed with glee and quickly gathered in a semi-circle around Droven as he removed the cloth covering from the top of his wicker basket. Inside was a bottle of chilled juice and a pile of delicious, bright yellow muffins, courtesy of a kindly Vudran baker who supplied the Grand Lodge. Fumbus filled small vials with a sip of juice for each child while Droven handed out the muffins, after which the children snacked and drank happily as Fumbus finished his story. </p> 
                   <p>“When’s Whirp gonna tell us a story?” A little gnome boy’s eyes shone with genuine curiosity even as he gently polished Whirp’s metal arm with the edge of his filthy shirt. “I bet Whirp beat up a whole bunch of bad guys!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus nodded in agreement and immediately launched into the story of Whirp leaping across the trees of Arcadia with a pair of rocket-powered blast boots. The goblin exaggerated slightly, but not so much so that Droven felt a need to interject.</p> 
                   <p>“Then, BAMMO! Whirp comes fallin’ outta the sky and SHWOOP stops the fire from the baddy!” As the children cheered at the end of the story, Droven explained that Whirp needed Fumbus to tell his stories because the construct was too shy, and also Droven had forgotten to give him a mouth (which the inventor promised he’d look into fixing just as soon as he had the chance.)</p> 
                   <p>Once the tale was done, Droven and Fumbus excused themselves from their youthful friends’ company, promising to return the next day with more muffins and stories. As the unlikely pair of adventurers made their way back to the Grand Lodge, Droven glanced fondly at the goblin who had somehow become his most loyal and steadfast friend.</p> 
                   <p>“Fumbus?”</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah, Droven?”</p> 
                   <p>“Home’s good, Fumbus.”</p>

                   <p>The first premium product to release as part of this partnership is the second edition <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>, coming April 16. The release of the <em>Beginner Box</em> on Foundry VTT has been specifically timed to precede the community driven <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rpathfinder2e/home">Beginner Box Day</a> event occurring the weekend of April 23–24, 2022. Fans won’t have to wait long for more content as the debut volume of the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path, <em>Punks in a Powder Keg</em>, will be available simultaneously with the book’s retail release on April 27. Volumes two and three will follow as they hit store shelves in upcoming months.</p> 
                   <p>Next month, the truly massive <em>Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</em> arrives as an all-inclusive deluxe module, coinciding with the release of the hardcover adventure compilation.</p>

                   <p>We’re incredibly excited for the Pathfinder community to check this premier slate of products out on FoundryVTT and look forward to expanding our offerings as time goes on. We’d like to thank the passionate volunteers who laid the groundwork for Pathfinder Second Edition content on Foundry, without whom we’d have had a much steeper climb to bring these projects to fruition. Special thanks are due to developer FryGuy, whose PF2e PDF to Foundry module has provided countless GMs with adventure importing and formatting services in the absence of official FoundryVTT support before now. Internally, this partnership has had no greater champion than Andrew White, who was among the first in the company to point out FoundryVTT’s meteoric rise in the virtual tabletop landscape and has spearheaded coordination between Paizo and the various teams working on these releases. Thank you all!</p>

                   <h3>Head Cannon — System: Brain and Throat</h3> 
                   <p><b>Augmentation</b> Magitech<br> <b>Level</b> 10<br> <b>Price</b> 18,000<br> This tasteful adamantine armature installed within your throat and mouth and linked to your brain hides a collapsible cannon capable of firing powerful reality-altering shells. When installed, a <em>head cannon</em> grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the Fortitude save against a wound critical hit effect that targets the brain (provided your species’ brain is in your head [provided your species thinks with its brain]). As a standard action, you can open your mouth wide to use the <em>head cannon</em> to make a ranged attack against a single creature’s KAC within 60 feet. This cannon counts as a heavy weapon for proficiency purposes and deals 2d12 piercing damage. Upon rolling the damage, you can attempt a DC 16 Will saving throw to exert your belief over how badly your target was damaged; if you succeed, you can roll an additional d12 of damage. After you fire the head cannon, you take a –2 penalty to the DCs and skill checks for language-dependent effects for 1d4 rounds as your mouth returns to normal size and the gun cools down. Once you have fired the <em>head cannon</em>, you can’t shoot it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge the gun immediately.</p>

                   <h3>Robe of Feathers Fall — Item 8</h3> 
                   <p>This dashing travel- (and beer-) stained feathered robe is the result of magic experimentation gone awry. Dared to create a robe that would continually cast <em>feather fall</em> during a brainstorming session at a local pub, a young wizard got the enchantment wrong. Instead of a robe that would let its wearer float through the air, they got….this:</p> 
                   <p>When you first invest the robe, and whenever you make your daily preparations, roll 1d6 and consult the following list to determine the type of feathers. 1: crow; 2: duck; 3: ostrich; 4: chicken; 5: goose; 6: peacock. With each step taken, huge amounts of feathers sprout forth from the robe with great force. The feathers make you concealed from all other creatures, but also conceal all other creatures from you. Of course, you cannot use this concealed condition to Hide. </p>

                   <p><b>Abjuration, Invested, Chaotic</b><br> <b>Price</b> An indeterminate amount of one’s lifespan, spent driving to the magic item warehouse, navigating its labyrinthine corridors, and consuming meatballs. Also some gold.<br> <b>Usage</b> Worn armor; <b>Bulk</b> 4</p> 
                   <p>This classic, timeless suit of <em>+1 resilient full plate</em> is personally assembled from modular pieces of flat-packed darkwood, doubling as furniture and personal protective gear. To wear or remove the <em>suit of armoire</em>, you must succeed at a DC 41 Crafting check (yes, this includes the +10 modifier for an “Incredibly Difficult” challenge); on a failure, you and all creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 31 Will save or be overcome with frustration at how you can’t follow the simple, easy-to-understand diagrams for assembling the armoire, imposing a –1 status penalty to Will saves for 1 hour.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <frequency>

                      <em>suit of armoire</em> today; 
                      <b>Effect</b> You open a set of doors on the armoire’s front, producing one fancy suit of clothes of your choosing.

                      <b>Effect</b> You forgot a peg or bolt when you were assembling the 
                      <em>suit of armoire</em>, causing it to collapse to pieces around you, though this shields you from harm. The triggering attack is a failure, or you succeed at your Reflex save. The 
                      <em>suit of armoire</em> falls apart around you into its constituent panels, leaving you unarmored.

                   <p><b>Uncommon, Divination, Invested, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 10 Treasure Bundles<br> <b>Usage</b> worn; <b>Bulk</b> –</p> 
                   <p>This extremely fetching oversized compass has numerous extraneous gears, levers, doodads, and buttons. It does not function as a compass. Instead, it always points to the nearest <em>wayfinder</em>. An indentation in the middle of the <em>wayfinderfinder</em> can hold a single <em>wayfinder</em>. A <em>wayfinder</em> stored in this manner—and any <em>aeon stone</em> it may contain—provides no benefits, but the <em>wayfinderfinder</em> points to the nearest <em>wayfinder</em> of the type stored within, instead of any <em>wayfinder</em>. If you have more than one <em>wayfinderfinder</em> holding a <em>wayfinder</em> on your person at a given time, the <em>wayfinderfinders</em> point to each other instead, and any <em>aeon stones</em> in your possession begin annoyingly bouncing off your head instead of rotating around it.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] command; <b>Effect</b> The <em>wayfinderfinder</em> shouts “Explore! Report! Cooperate!” then rapidly explains that certain uses of the <em>wayfinderfinder</em> may void its warranty.</p>

                   <h2>The Cognates</h2> 
                   <p>In the aftermath of the Data Scourge, a growing number of Starfinders lost their faith in technology and Guidance, sparking an anti-technological movement that swept through the Starfinder ranks. Led by Royo, and joined by the countless agents whose lives have been altered for the worse by technology, the movement caused heated debate between agents. After First Seeker Ehu Hadif opened a dialogue with Royo and his fellows, the movement solidified into a new minor faction, the Cognates. While some Cognates still aim to eschew technology completely, the faction now focuses on a multi-disciplinary methodology.</p>

                   <p><b>Faction Leader</b>: Royo (LN male ysoki). A well-respected member of the Forum, the elected ruling body of the Starfinder Society, Royo is a scholar who believes information and a thorough education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of status, wealth, or connections. Denouncing the impermanence and mutability of digital data, he maintains a massive archive of physical manuscripts and tomes spread across facilities in countless star systems. Royo’s beliefs often lead him into disagreements with the Dataphiles.</p> 
                   <p><b>Motto</b>: Diversity in knowledge, unity in purpose.</p> 
                   <p><b>Objectives</b>: Cognates believe technology is but a single tool in a well-stocked toolkit, and that over-reliance on any one discipline, such as the Starfinder Society’s current over-reliance on technology, is close-minded, dangerous, and ineffective. Instead, Cognates focus on a multi-disciplinary approach to innovation, operations, and problem-solving, including natural, magical, and low-tech analog methodologies, to form a balanced and secure foundation for the Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>Year 5 Goal</b>: The Cognates aim to reduce the Starfinder Society’s dangerous over-reliance on technology, including Guidance, and refocus instead on magical and natural innovations, along with analog and other low-tech solutions.</p>

                   <p><b>Multidisciplinary Approach (Social Boon)</b>:<br> The Cognates believe that a multidisciplinary approach to knowledge is fundamental to the future stability of the Starfinder Society, and you have cultivated contacts in a variety of fields of study. When slotting this boon, select either Life Science, Mysticism, or Physical Science. You gain a circumstance bonus to that skill check equal to half your current Cognates Reputation Tier (rounding up).<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 5+ Reputation with Cognates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p><b>Prudent Technophobe (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You know well the dangers of technology and have trained to protect yourself from technological foes. You gain a +1 insight bonus to AC against attacks from a creature with the technological subtype.<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 15+ Reputation with Cognates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p><b>Portable Archive (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You maintain a detailed, well-indexed physical archive, such as a book or collection of essays, which you always keep with you and can reference on the fly. During an adventure, when you attempt a skill check to recall knowledge, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reference your portable archive. If you do so, you roll the skill check twice and keep the higher result. Referencing your portable archive takes 10 minutes.<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 25+ Reputation with Cognates<br> AcP Cost: 4</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">International Transgender Day of Visibility (TDoV) is once again upon us! TDoV is an annual day (March 31) to celebrate and show support for our transgender and gender-expansive communities. It’s a day of empowerment, celebrating the lives and accomplishments of these communities while raising awareness of the work that is still needed to combat discrimination.</p> 
                   <p>So let’s start with the good news, rare as it might seem sometimes: the last couple of years have shown us that the needle is moving in the right direction. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/27/rising-shares-of-u-s-adults-know-someone-who-is-transgender-or-goes-by-gender-neutral-pronouns/">Pew Research Center</a>, more than 42% of US adults in 2021 said they know or are friends with a transgender and/or gender-expansive person, an increase from 37% in 2017. Authentic portrayals of transgender and gender-expansive people are increasing in popular culture, and we’re finally starting to see more transgender and gender-expansive politicians elected. There are so many reasons to celebrate our community’s growth and acceptance. </p> 
                   <p>But this newfound visibility has brought ever greater and more serious costs. Being transgender or gender-expansive in 2022 also comes with fear, anger, and uncertainty, as the validity of our existence is under an unprecedented assault. 2022 has already seen <a href="https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/">over 240 anti-LGBTQI+ bills filed with 34 states</a>, with the overwhelming majority specifically targeting transgender people; this is roughly the same number of anti-LGBTQI+ bills filed over the <em>entirety</em> of 2021. Over the past few years, these bills have mostly focused on limiting discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in schools, limiting or preventing transgender athletes’ participation in sports, limiting bathroom access, and preventing the changing or elimination of gender markers on licenses and birth certificates. </p> 
                   <p>Though the sheer number of these bills is already cause for concern, they’re also getting more aggressive. The authors of these bills now seek to completely cut off access to life-saving gender affirming care and criminalize the parents of transgender and gender-expansive youth and the providers of their medical care. Two of the most egregious recent examples of this have been in Texas and Idaho. In February, Texas Governor Greg Abbott directed the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who provide gender-affirming medical care to their transgender children for potential child abuse. Not to be outdone, a bill passed by the Idaho House of Representatives (HB 675) would make it a felony, punishable by life in prison, not only to provide gender-affirming treatment, but to provide permission for a minor to receive it, or to permit a minor to travel out of state to receive it.</p> 
                   <p>Clearly, the transgender and gender-expansive community is quite visible right now—to the extent that one might ask why we need a specific day for visibility. The answer is simple: people who are questioning their identity or working towards coming out publicly need to see transgender and gender-expansive people who are happy, thriving, and living their best lives. The more we are seen and accepted, the louder our voices can become.</p> 
                   <p>I’m proud to be a visible and publicly transgender person. This month will mark 9 years since I came out as transgender. I was lucky to have a caring family that helped me at each stage of my transition, but even with their unwavering support, I would very likely not have been able to come out and find acceptance with myself if it wasn’t for the courage of other transgender and gender-expansive people showing me that it was OK to be me. I’m alive today because of those people being very loud and very proud about who they are.</p> 
                   <p>So how do we keep transgender and gender-expansive people visible, and how do we counter this recent wave of hate directed at people who only want to live a fulfilling life? To my transgender and gender-expansive friends and colleagues: continue to have the courage to make yourselves as visible as possible. Continue to live your best lives and serve as inspiration for others who are about to embark on that journey, who are struggling in their transitions, or who just need to see someone rocking it to help them find inspiration to get through a tough day. Keep your heads up, be loud and proud of who you are, and keep fighting like hell. </p> 
                   <p>To our allies: don’t get complacent. For those of you who don’t know, aside from TDoV, the other main date the transgender and gender-expansive community observes is November 20: Transgender Day of Remembrance, memorializing those we’ve lost. Before the recent wave of legislation targeting transgender and gender-expansive people, the attempted suicide rate among people who identified as such was around 50%. Unfortunately, with the current attempts to deny gender-affirming care, this number will likely only go up. </p> 
                   <p>So I say this: to hell with keeping us in your thoughts and prayers. Don’t wait until you lose a friend or colleague forever before deciding to act. Transgender and gender-expansive people alone can’t win this fight. We need your help in amplifying our voices, educating yourself and others, donating to supportive groups, volunteering, voting out politicians driven by hate and ignorance, and listening and providing love and support to the transgender and gender-expansive people in your lives.</p> 
                   <p>Each of the amazing gains our community has made has been opposed by people who would rather we stay hidden and excluded from society, or increasingly, would simply prefer us dead. These are, and have always been, the stakes. We celebrate (and fight for) Transgender Day of Visibility so there are fewer lives to mourn on Transgender Day of Remembrance. </p>

                   <p>Fresh off uncovering the identity of the mysterious architect behind the Data Scourge, the Starfinder Society turns its attention to pinpointing the original source of the Data Scourge virus. Guided by Celita and with the aid of the infamous hacker Noname, the PCs join the Dataphiles in tracing the digital trail. When the team hits a setback, Celita dispatches the PCs to an interfaith religious summit to connect with the representatives of the Church of Triune in attendance. It’s time to network, party, and of course: save the day! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02asa?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-415-Feuding-Faiths"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-15: Feuding Faiths</em></a> is a scenario for levels 5–8 written by Scott D. Young.</p> 
                   <p>Take care!</p>

                   <p>Pathfinders! Are you between the levels of 1 and 4? Are you interested in the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot? Want to celebrate the grand opening of the Pathfinder Society’s newest lodge? Want to visit the city of Sedeq in Qadira? You’re invited to a party!</p> 
                   <p>This month, in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02as9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-312-Furys-Toll"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-12: Fury’s Toll</em></a>, a group of Pathfinder agents are dispatched to Sedeq Lodge to participate in the festivities, make new allies, and help the event go smoothly. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries adventure without someone showing up to cause trouble. Who is this enemy, and what do they want? As always, you’ll have to play to find out!</p> 
                   <p>This scenario continues the story of the prior adventure in this metaplot arc, <a href=""><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation’s Price</em></a>. You aren’t required to play the scenarios in order, but it’ll enhance the narrative if you do. You can learn more about our adventure offerings for the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries in the recent <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shy6?Pathfinder-Society-Year-3-Metaplot-Arcs">Pathfinder Society Year 3 Metaplot Arcs</a> blog.</p> 
                   <p><em>Fury’s Toll</em> is an adventure for levels 1–4 written by Paizo’s talented editor Solomon St. John. It is part of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot and includes an additional faction mission for the Envoy’s Alliance faction.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Today we’re going to pull back the curtain on our two upcoming multi-table interactive events for the 2022 Paizo Organized Play season. If you’re not familiar, Pathfinder and Starfinder Organized Play release yearly multi-table events that can be played with as few as three tables and well over 150+ tables at the world’s largest events.

                   <p>Some of you may notice that the level ranges have dipped down a bit from what we’ve previously offered. There are a few reasons for this. We wanted to make sure these events offered a select level range to make it easier for event organizers to run and to ensure that these can be offered easily as walk-up events for new players at events around the world. Secondly, we’re trying to bridge some of the cognitive load that is required to run these events. As of right now there are effectively four scenarios worth of content in one of these interactives. Adding on additional level ranges makes them exceptionally tricky to slot for events and for GMs to prepare for properly. But worry not, we’ll have more high-level content coming in the future (in addition to the always growing repertoire of sanctioned content). Finally,because the workload on interactives is immense, it takes a lot of time and effort for Paizo’s extremely talented staff of developers, editors, and artists to complete. We want to make sure that these events can still continue without adding undue stress or delays on other projects for our staff, so this change is an important step in achieving that goal.</p>

                   <p><em>Starfinder Society #4–99: A Time of Crisis</em> debuts at PaizoCon 2022 and is Organized Play’s first foray into the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Drift Crisis</em></a> event. In this adventure, a large group of Starfinders heads out on a routine archaeological mission, only to find themselves caught in the first event of the Drift Crisis. To survive the challenges to come, groups of characters from local communities or around the world need to come together and work as a team. In this exciting event, we’ll be giving characters the opportunity to answer, “Where were you during the Drift Crash?”—an event that kicks off the Drift Crisis and can be followed-up in all aspects of the Starfinder setting. Written by veteran author Dennis Muldoon, this interactive is intended for 1st to 6th level characters and is split into level range 1–4 and 3–6 to better help event organizers.</p> 
                   <p><em>Pathfinder Society #3–98: Expedition into Pallid Peril</em> is set to release in early August with a GenCon 2022 debut. In this multi-table event, the PCs head into the mountain region of Droskar’s Crag in search of the entrance to a fabled lost dwarven city. Prior expeditions involved lone groups of Pathfinders, such as <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ni?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Enter-the-Pallid-Peak"><em>Pathfinder Society #2–19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em></a> and more recently <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths"><em>Pathfinder Society #3–10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a>. This expedition is the largest yet, with several Pathfinder groups set to explore the mountain ruins in hopes of finding the entrance to the lost dwarven city of Raseri Kanton, which is believed to be lost somewhere within the so-called Pallid Peak. The amazingly talented Rigby Bendele has put together a masterpiece adventure for multiple players. This event is intended for 1st to 6th level characters and is split into level range 1–4 and 3–6 to better help event organizers.</p> 
                   <p>That’s all for today’s blog! Look forward to more information on these interactives as we get closer to the big conventions of the year.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">The crowd in front of the vast chasm surrounding the Starstone Cathedral was slightly larger today than most days. Visitors from all over Golarion stopped by the great pit every day to marvel at the ancient edifice at its center, to dream of the stone hidden away behind its massive walls, lethal traps, and immortal guardians. It was said that the <em>Starstone</em> granted immeasurable power to any who could touch its crystalline surface and pass the final test of spirit. Those who succeeded became gods. Most simply fell to their deaths in the chasm outside and the rare few who made it in the cathedral were usually never heard from again.</p> 
                   <p>Normally, an attempt by one of the “hopeful” would draw a huge crowd of locals and visitors alike, all interested to see if the would-be god could even make it across the chasm. The celebration was usually all in good fun, if you could call someone risking their life for immortality fun, but it could turn unruly in an instant, the mob demanding the poor soul fling themselves into danger. In either case, it was good business for those of us who ran shops in the Ascendant Court, selling sweet treats and chilled wine. </p> 
                   <p>But not today. </p> 
                   <p>Today was the fourth supposedly prophesized moment of ascension for Dyrani, and business was terrible.</p> 
                   <p>Her first attempt was almost a year ago. The Osiriani woman had only been on the Avenue of the Hopeful for a few weeks at that time, and although she didn’t have a large throng of supporters, she still drew a good crowd to hear her tale and see her make the attempt. For over an hour she spoke of her accomplishments, from the moment of her birth under an auspicious sign, to the tremendous thunderstorm that bore down upon her parent’s small home giving her a connection to the rains and floods, the crops, and the land. The people listened to her claims of connection to the harvest and how she could be counted on to bring rain to struggling farmers and ensure a season of plenty for all upon her ascension. They even saw her plant a simple seed into the ground and encourage it to grow, yet when it came time for her to leap, something changed. She looked out at the chasm and declared that it was not the right time.</p> 
                   <p>“The seed was not yet ready to sprout,” she said, adding that once the plant has matured, she would take the test.</p> 
                   <p>Suffice to say, there were more than a few jeers and cries. But for all the disappointment, Dyrani benefitted quite a bit from the show. For the next few months farmers, gardeners, and food merchants began to stop by her rustic stall on the Avenue and pay their respects to her and the growing plant. They say it never hurts to get in early with new gods. Even if only one in a thousand passed the test, those who do are sure to remember any who believed in them from the start. For my part, I sold a lot of harvest breads and orange tea to her faithful.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Dyrani even gathered a few devotees to aid in her preparations. She anointed each in a grand ceremony, dubbing them the High Priest of Rains, the High Priestess of Sowing, and the High Priest of Harvest, respectively. They were mostly harmless, wearing ridiculous hats and making pronouncements about the weather. Most would-be-gods attracted a few desperate fools, even when they had nothing to give other than vague promises about the future. The feeling of importance, of belonging was often enough. The avenue was usually cluttered with these supplicants, shouting edicts and making the case for their still-mortal deity. It wasn’t bad for business, really. Most visitors came just to see this spectacle, even if there was no attempt that day. Some of my best days selling sweet pastries have been after a good brawl between the high priests of various would-be faiths. No one wins... except us.</p> 
                   <p>The second attempt was scheduled for later that summer. By this time, Dyrani had amassed a vast crowd of followers, and there was a festival happening in the Grand Bazaar, so the city was swollen with visitors. The Avenue and the Court were packed with people, many of whom began drinking and chanting for Dyrani just after dawn. Her High Priests were there of course, collecting tithes in vast cornucopias made from straw. From the moment I saw them, I knew it was not going to be the day. These hopeful never go through with the test when the coin is flowing freely. There’s still too much to be gained. Later that day, the High Priestess of Sowing pronounced that Dyrani had read the tea leaves (from my stall no less!) and decided that the most auspicious time to take the test would be at the end of the harvest, so that she could prove her worth to all the other gods and make this year a harvest like no other. Fortunately for the harvest deity, another hopeful made the attempt later that afternoon, screaming as he plummeted into the void. I think he wanted to be the god of fish or some such nonsense. </p> 
                   <p>Over the next few months, Dyrani’s appearance changed significantly. Gone were her woolen dresses—now she wore elegant silk embroidered with golden wheat. Her simple grapevine crown was replaced with a wreath of bejeweled golden leaves, and now she carried a massive silver scythe, so that all might know that the goddess of the harvest was near. It had been a good few months for her and her faithful, as the donations came flooding in from visitors and locals alike. But as the end of the harvest drew close, there were signs of stress. </p>
                   <p>The High Priest of Rains quit one afternoon after a heated debate about the upcoming attempt. I think I saw him making poses at the end of the avenue, worshipping another perpetual hopeful. The High Priestess of Sowing stopped working the street for donations after a local gang stole her cornucopia. Only the High Priest of Harvest remained loyal, doing whatever was asked, but he was a zealot, having lost his entire family to famine some years back. I wouldn’t be surprised if he leapt into the pit after Dyrani on her day.</p> 
                   <p>When harvest finally came, the crowd was sizable, but it was clear most didn’t think Dyrani would actually go through with it. All were disappointed when the sacred plant was revealed. It was withered and brown. Defeated, Dyrani called off the attempt, claiming she had been sabotaged by agents of Urgathoa, who wouldn’t dare let such a powerful deity ascend. The boos were some of the loudest I’ve ever heard. Nearly all her supplicants quit in the following days, stealing her finery and looting her treasury.</p> 
                   <p>It was a hard winter for the would-be goddess. By the spring, it was just her and the High Priest of the Harvest. Their clothes were stained, and the silver scythe had been tarnished.</p> 
                   <p>And that brings us to today. My shop is toward the end of the Avenue, right across from the vast chasm surrounding the Cathedral. The spectacle is all but gone. Dyrani has drawn right up to the edge. There’s no cheering, no chants, just silence and the sound of the wind. As the clouds break, a shaft of sunlight illuminates the young woman. She looks exhausted, as most do after their long journey down the Avenue, but as she looks up into the sun, its warmth shining upon her, she steps out, over nothing…</p>

                   <p>In <em>Pathfinder Goblin Firework Fight</em>, you are a goblin rampaging through the small town of Sandpoint, stealing the fireworks from their upcoming festival and using them to cause all sorts of mayhem and panic. At the end of the game, the goblin with the most fireworks will be crowned winner and the “bestest goblin of the raid!” </p> 
                   <p>The game is played over a number of rounds. Each round, every goblin gets to take one loot token from the town’s treasure pile. These tokens might represent useful tools or valuable treasure, like fireworks, dogslicers (goblin knives), or shields. Unfortunately, the tribe’s most fearsome beast, a pig called Squealy Nord, is also hiding in the treasure, bringing mayhem and chaos to any who draw his token from the pile. You never know what you might get!</p> 
                   <p>The game continues until the town’s pile of loot tokens is empty and the goblin with the most fireworks is declared the winner! </p> 
                   <p>Available for preorder now in the webstore, <em>Pathfinder Goblin Firework Fight</em> is the first stand-alone game from Paizo in years, and is slated for a March 30, 2022 release.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello Starfinders!<br> Earlier this month, we announced Starfinder Society Year 5: <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz7?Starfinder-Society-Year-5-Announcement#25">Year of Redemption’s Rise</a>. While the previous blog post is packed full of information on the year itself, today we’re focusing on one of the two new factions you can expect to see in the Year of Redemption’s Rise: the Advocates!</p> 
                   <h2>The Advocates</h2> 
                   <p>When Zigvigix, former leader of the Exo-Guardians, emerged from their recent convalescence to find the Starfinder Society splitting apart at the seams, their heart broke. They had suffered more than most during the Data Scourge, but they still sympathized with those around them: the citizens whose lives were upended or cut short and the Starfinders who felt shame and suspicion. Determined to mend the widening rifts between agents and offer them the support they needed to recover, Ziggy founded a new faction: the Advocates. </p> 
                   <table class="image" align="left"> 
                    <caption align="bottom" style="font-size: 13px;">

                     </tr> 
                    </tbody>
                   </table> 
                   <p>Ziggy’s passion, heart, and understanding caused the faction’s ranks to quickly swell. Members of the Advocates are sometimes referred to as “Heartloves” as a nod to both their mission and Ziggy’s favorite band (Strawberry Machine Cake).</p> 
                   <p><b>Faction Leader</b>: Zigvigix (LG host shirren soldier) was a long-standing member of the Exo-Guardians. They suffered severe injuries prior to the Scoured Stars, which prevented them from taking part in that ill-fated expedition. Despite being overwhelmed with survivor’s guilt, Zigvigix took up leadership of the remaining Exo-Guardians. During the Data Scourge, they were taken prisoner by the Scourge’s perpetrator, who later used the shirren’s cybernetics to infect Guidance with a corrupting virus. Zigvigix tore out their own cybernetic implants to prevent the digital infection from spreading and has only recently recovered from the ordeal. Though Zigvigix admits they have much healing to do, they take comfort in their relationship with Celita, their favorite sugar-pop music, and the support of their colleagues and community.</p> 
                   <p><b>Motto</b>: We’re here for you!</p> 
                   <p><b>Year 5 Goal</b>: The Advocates aim to heal the widening rifts between factions, unite the squabbling Starfinder agents into an accepting, loving, and supportive community, and encourage the Starfinder Society to do good throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Boons</b>: Like all our factions, the Advocates have a slate of unique boons available for purchase with Achievement Points by members of the Advocates faction with the appropriate amount of Reputation. Today we’re revealing three of these boons! Note that these boons are not yet final and may change slightly before release.</p> 
                   <p><b>Loyal Friend (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> Your strong bonds of friendship help center your thoughts. You gain a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against the confused condition. When you have the confused condition and would be forced to attack an ally, you instead do nothing but babble incoherently.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 5+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 2</p> 
                   <p><b>Protector’s Offense (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You’ve trained to protect your allies from harm as often as you protect yourself. When you successfully strike a target with a melee attack using a weapon with the block special property and increase your AC against that target, your adjacent allies gain a +1 enhancement bonus to their AC for 1 round against melee attacks from that same target. This bonus only applies as long as they remain adjacent to you.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 15+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p><b>Determined Medic (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You’ve trained for innumerable emergency situations and are a capable combat medic in a pinch. Once per adventure as a standard action, you can treat a willing, adjacent creature to remove one of the following conditions: frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, or staggered. This doesn’t end the effect that caused the condition, and the target can regain the condition from any source as normal.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 25+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this sneak peek at the upcoming Advocates faction! Come back at the end of the month when we reveal information on the Cognates!</p> 
                   <p>Wishing you all the best, Starfinders! Take care of each other out there.</p>

                    <li>Volunteers will be accepted on a rolling basis and schedules should be assigned within a week of your application. Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered to be committed to attending the event.</li> 
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out the volunteer form and then follow up by emailing genconleads@gmail.com. Please note we have a limited number of tables and the schedule is fairly locked-in at this stage, but we’ll do our best to get you slotted into your scenario if it’s on the schedule.</li> 
                    <li>In-person attendees and guests will be required to show proof of vaccination and wear masks. Other venues in the area (such as the hotels) may have less stringent requirements in common areas. Therefore, we will enforce our requirements in Paizo-controlled spaces such as the Sagamore ballroom. Failure to comply may result in your expulsion and a potential ban from future major conventions.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at genconleads@gmail.com.</li>

                   <h2>Advice For Publishers</h2> 
                   <p>Over the 5+ months Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite have been live, I’ve noticed some trends in what seems to resonate with the audience, what sells well, and what makes the content creators the most money for their effort and passion. I thought I’d take this opportunity to pass on some advice for the benefit of the entire Infinite community, but specifically for the benefit of those of you who are putting time and efforts into making products for the platforms.</p> 
                   <p>First, a good cover goes a long way. I can’t stress how important even a single image and readable text are on your cover. Even using one of the many monster or NPC illustrations that have been made available on the Paizo Blog over the years, or in the Pathfinder/Starfinder Infinite art packs, seems to have a noticeable effect on sales. If you’re having trouble deciding what image to use, or can’t figure out how to use the templates provided on the Infinite platform, consider reaching out to other community creators for help and advice. Everyone can remember their first attempt, and most folks are happy to pay their knowledge and experience forward (as long as you aren’t expecting them to lay out your entire book.)</p> 
                   <p>Second, proofread your product description! While a picture is worth a thousand words, if one of the few dozen words someone can see before deciding to buy a product is misspelled, that word is an outlier and certainly worth an entire picture unto itself. Run any text the public is going to see by a second set of eyes, even if it’s a significant other, member of your gaming group, or a friend online. It’s easy to overlook our own mistakes, and often something we’ve overlooked a dozen times will be immediately caught by someone on their first readthrough. How you describe your product is as important as the product itself, so give that sales copy one extra read before you post it.</p> 
                   <p>Next, consider making content that specifically supports or builds on new or popular releases, be it additional NPCs or encounters for an Adventure Path, shops and plot hooks for a region or settlement, or a short story set in the leadup to or aftermath of a major event in the setting. It’s been a few months since folks got their hands on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>, and we’re going to start promoting Absalom-based content with a special banner and other marketing pushes. Expect similar support for the forthcoming Starfinder Drift Crisis meta-event and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis">hardcover</a>. And eventually, we’d love to have enough content tied to specific APs to break those out into their own content hubs. Such publications have a built-in audience of GMs and players who are already invested in the associated campaigns and can increase your products’ reach and sales.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, don’t undervalue your work. While the options to make your product free or pay what you want exist, far too often publishers fall back on these due to a lack of confidence in their work’s ability to sell at higher prices. Don’t do that! You worked hard on your product and people will give you money for it. My experience has shown that they’ll usually give you another 20-50% more than you think it’s worth. So, if you’re stuck at pricing your product, have some faith in yourself and the quality of your work and set it for $2, $5, whatever, instead of setting that same amount as a suggested price. Products offered for free (or free transactions of pay-what-you-want products) also don’t get counted by the site’s algorithms when determining bestsellers or best-seller badges, so even something getting a lot of downloads isn’t necessarily going to get more attention after if falls off the new releases list.</p> 
                   <h2>Other DriveThruRPG News</h2> 
                   <p>While not directly Infinite-related, I wanted to also draw attention to other offerings on the DriveThruRPG storefront.

                   <p>The Inevitable Excess DLC will take players on new adventures set just before the moment of their greatest triumph: victory over the Worldwound. The new story will require all the hero's high-level abilities and mythic powers to battle with near invincible opponents.</p> 
                   <p>Areelu Vorlesh's experiment was about more than just Golarion and the Abyss. Many powerful entities could not stay away from the war between mortals and demons. Some participated personally, while others observed from afar, asking questions – is this experiment too dangerous for Golarion, for the planes, for the universe? And as the hero of the Fifth Crusade strode toward the inevitable battle with Areelu Vorlesh, the primordial inevitable Valmallos, the keeper of magic, sensed an impending threat to the universe, and turned to the Commander.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Play a new story that complements the main campaign storyline. Import your character from the main campaign with all their companions, or create a new one to find out what exactly has troubled the keeper of magic.</li> 
                    <li>At the beginning of the adventure, the character will be high level – with both standard and mythic options available. Fight new mythic opponents who threaten the peace of the planes. Use your entire arsenal of mythic abilities!</li> 
                    <li>Visit Axis – the birthplace and home of the inevitables, the machine aeons, exploring every corner of this plane and finding a way through a dungeon full of dangers.</li> 
                    <li>Export achievements to the main campaign. After completing this DLC, new powers will become available to the character in the main campaign right before the official start of the Fifth Crusade.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The DLC is available as a part of the Season Pass, as well as via a standalone purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/pathfinder_wrath_of_the_righteous">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Epic Games Store</a> for $12.99.</p> 
                   <p>A new patch (1.2) is now available and features over 500 tweaks and fixes for the crusade, various mythic paths, and other aspects of the game. The full list of updates can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSyKg5gyNmZvnDgCWkexGufi1Sh4s-qkBVATeN-zRgFQL-m2CiCJjdkqquepApKGvaK0m5cOOBr-XPB/pub">here</a>.</p>

                   <p>For those waiting patiently for Gen Con volunteer information, I’m meeting with the Gen Con committee this week to work on putting the final pieces into place. I’m hoping to have volunteer signups open in the next couple of weeks.</p>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz7?Starfinder-Society-Year-5-Announcement">As we announced last week</a>, Year 5 of Starfinder Society is titled “Year of Redemption’s Rise!” We’ll be launching this year’s storyline at PaizoCon 2022, both online and at the physical show, with three brand-new scenarios. Strap in, Starfinders, and get ready for a year like you’ve never seen!</p> 
                   <p>It was also announced that five new species will be made always-available, and three new factions will be opened up to all Starfinders. Information on these changes, as well as any other new rule changes, will be discussed further in a blog prior to PaizoCon focused specifically on these changes. We don’t have any other major program changes planned at this time, but if we change course, we’ll be sure to let you know well before PaizoCon.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>We didn’t have any new material sanctioned this month, mostly because there wasn’t much more material to sanction yet! Behind the scenes, we’re starting to work on <em>Book of the Dead</em>, which I anticipate we’ll have ready for its street date. We’re also working on polishing off sanctioning for the <em>Tyrant’s Grasp</em> AP, the last of our PF1 Adventure Paths to be sanctioned, and we’re looking ahead to <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, the <em>Quest for the Frozen Flame</em> and <em>Horizons of the Vast</em> APs, and even the <em>Drift Crisis</em> rulebook. </p> 
                   <p>While I have you all here, there were a couple other topics I wanted to touch on.</p> 
                   <p><b>Retroactive Sanctioning:</b> In the past, there have been questions about how to handle chronicle sheets for adventures that have been sanctioned after a group completes the adventure. Previously the guidance has been that while this is technically illegal, there were ways to skirt the system by having a fake wrap-up session, which is silly and weird, so I’m doing away with that loophole.</p> 
                   <p>Going forward, if an adventure is sanctioned after your group completes it, your GM is <b>absolutely permitted</b>. (and encouraged!) to issue chronicles for all interested players. These chronicles should be applied as if your group had finished the session on the day you receive the chronicle. You couldn’t, for example, retroactively apply it to a character at an earlier date and bump all their future chronicles up in level; this breaks the timestream and makes the Hounds of Tindalos mad.</p> 
                   <p><b>Updated Sanctioning Documents:</b> Wayyyyy back in August we <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shrt?Organized-Play-Update-Increased-Rewards-for">announced an update to our sanctioning documents</a> and the increase in Reputation that would come along with it. And then, y’know, we had a busy few months. However, I am now pleased to announce that the project has been finished! All sanctioning documents have been fully updated and should reflect the most recent version of the rules. Please let me know if you encounter any issues!</p> 
                   <p>Normally this would be where I’d put GM Recognition, but this month I don’t have any new 5-rank GMs to announce. Instead, I’ll just thank all our GMs, especially those who have volunteered already for PaizoCon and Gen Con. You’re all fantastic and we literally wouldn’t be able to do this without you!</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And don’t forget to sign up for PaizoCon!</p>

                   <h2>SUPPLY RUN</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Droven could hardly believe the twists and turns the last few days had taken. Month after month, season after season, he’d traveled the continent of Arcadia, searching for passage back to Absalom, an ocean away in the region known as the Inner Sea. He had spent more than a few days in the last weeks carefully examining the soles of his metal-reinforced boots. Long ago, he’d promised one of the first friends he’d made in Arcadia, an old half-orc named Darv, that if he still hadn’t found a way back to Absalom by the time the soles of wore thin, he’d return to Darv’s workshop to begin a new life.</p> 
                   <p>Instead, Droven had inadvertently aided one of his closest friends from the Inner Sea, the goblin alchemist Fumbus, in a daring rescue against a gang of smugglers, the Wreckers. Fumbus’s rescued friends were a powerful old wizard named Ezren, a wise young cleric named Kyra, a cunning elf named Merisiel, and a valiant warrior called Valeros.</p> 
                   <p>Droven had at first been afraid to tell the others they were as stranded as he was, but after some discussion the group realized that they had almost everything they needed to make the journey back to Absalom. Ezren and Kyra’s magic could calm the worst of the storms and turn the currents in their favor, while Valeros’s strength and Merisiel’s cunning, combined with Droven’s and Fumbus’s ingenuity, would allow them to build a sturdy enough sea craft from the salvage of the Wreckers’ victims. </p> 
                   <p>The biggest problem was the lack of any known eastward currents bridging the Arcadian Ocean to the continents of Avistan and Garund. Droven had heard tales of the legendary current carrying Ulfen vikings to Port Valen in northern Arcadia and had even seen the maps of the sea routes between Arcadia and Tian Xia, which shared a northern land bridge with Avistan. Frustratingly, the northern route was only one way and the western route presented unique geographic barriers Droven had never been able to surmount. Making the trek in either direction, even accompanied by a group of stalwart adventurers, was a fraught journey that would take months at least.</p> 
                   <p>Instead, Droven had a plan that this group’s unique talents were particularly suited for. While Valeros and company assembled a ship based on Droven’s blueprints, the half-orc, his construct companion Whirp, and Fumbus would venture into the abandoned lair of a reckless alchemist in the nearby jungles to retrieve the materials necessary to assemble an alchemical engine capable of propelling their craft across the Arcadian Ocean, regardless of winds or currents.</p> 
                   <p>Droven had marked the laboratory the first time he’d passed along this stretch of coast over a year ago, though he’d been unwilling to delve too deep after encountering various alchemical traps. But now, with the possibility of home so close and a trusted companion at his side, Droven felt it worth the risk.</p>

                   <p>“Droven!”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> 
                   <p>“Ice?”</p> 
                   <p>“I’m sorry my friend, I’m afraid I don’t take your meanin–GAAH!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven and Fumbus had bypassed a variety of traps and strange monsters to the facility’s primary laboratory. Things had been going remarkably well, with inventor, construct, and alchemist each uniquely suited to disable the dangers laid by the paranoid alchemist who’d built the place. Droven blamed himself for their current predicament, trapped in a sealed room with an angry ooze climbing out of a broken glass tank.</p> 
                   <p>Shaking the sting of an acidic tendril from his non-mechanical arm, Droven yelled for Whirp. “Defensive formation zero zero three: barricade!”</p> 
                   <p>Responding to his maker’s command, Whirp leapt between his allies and the approaching ooze, deploying thin, folded metal sheets within his chassis to create a temporary barricade. As Droven ducked behind it, Fumbus cleared his throat.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“Miss you, Droven” Fumbus said, ducking an acidic pseudopod and swirling a blue cannister around in his hand. “Ice?”</p> 
                   <p>Droven’s good eye widened in surprise as he finally realized what the goblin was asking. “Yes, Fumbus! As much as you’ve got!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus hurled the cannister at the ooze, freezing a portion of its body but barely slowing its advance. As Droven fired a crossbow bolt into the ooze’s mass only to watch it dissolve, he realized Fumbus’s concoctions might be their only salvation. “More ice, Fumbus, quickly!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus’s right hand snatched an empty glass vial from one of his pouches while his left darted from his tiled necklace to his pouches, and up… into his mouth. Furiously chewing each component before spewing the macerated remains into his vial, Fumbus quickly created a second vial of liquid ice and launched it at the encroaching ooze before repeating the process.</p> 
                   <p>Droven took careful aim at a frozen section of ooze before firing his crossbow. As the icy chunk shattered into pieces, Droven was relieved to see that the ooze seemed to shrink, its regeneration stymied by the freezing cold. As Fumbus threw yet another liquid ice bomb, Droven glanced at his friend and suppressed a worried frown. Fumbus smiled at Droven, but the goblin’s saliva was frozen to his chin in icicles of drool, and his green skin had taken on a distinctly bluish hue. Worse, the goblin’s teeth chattered furiously, slowing down the liquid ice process. Seeing Fumbus’s predicament, Droven quickly removed a few mechanical components from his backpack. He’d been working on something the local Arcadians called a “cryomister,” a device intended to release a controlled stream of freezing liquid. Droven had been struggling to complete it due to his lack of familiarity with Arcadian alchemy, but Fumbus possessed exactly what Droven lacked.</p> 
                   <p>“Fumbus! Pour everything you’ve got into this!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus snatched up the proffered device and spewed all the components in his mouth directly into its ammunition cartridge. Trying hard not to think about what had just happened, Droven took the device back, activated it, and tossed it at the broken glass tank from which the ooze poured. As the cryomister sank into the acidic flow, chilling fog poured forth, solidifying the ooze until only a blue-green statue remained.</p> 
                   <p>Wiping shards of frozen drool from his chin, Fumbus wasted no time in sacking the lab, quickly identifying a variety of ingredients and reagents capable of fueling the alchemical engine Droven intended to build. Struggling to his feet, Droven leaned on Whirp’s body. His good arm was burned by acid, and he felt the weight of his prosthetic limb keenly as he struggled to stand. The two friends and friendly construct quickly gathered the materials they would need to assemble their engine.</p> 
                   <p>“Droven?”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> 
                   <p>“Oozes terrible.”</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah, Fumbus. They’re pretty bad.”</p>

                   <h2>BEACH PARTY</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“Whirp–click?” the tiny construct asked of Droven, who rotated the lenses of a pair of clockwork glasses he’d been tinkering with.</p> 
                   <p>“Hush now, little Whirp.” The half-orc placed a hand on the construct’s metal head. Farther down the beach—just within range of what the inventor could see through the darkness of early evening—a noisome band of pirates and smugglers gathered around a cooking fire obstructed by enough foliage to remain hidden from passing ships. The flames made it hard for Droven to calibrate his goggles as he looked on from the northern flank.</p> 
                   <p>“Wreckers," Droven said quietly. The nomads had warned him about them—and for good reason. Just beyond the campfire, a half dozen captives remained locked inside a stockade. The structure looked sturdy, despite being crafted from driftwood and detritus collected from the beach. Many of the prisoners had been hog-tied. Others were yoked in makeshift stocks.</p> 
                   <p>“I believe the Wreckers caught bigger fish than they meant to fry,” Droven said, adjusting his position. “Someone must have stripped and dumped the bodies we found near the tree line. I bet the smugglers ambushed the prisoners and overpowered them, but not before several were lost in the fray.” He exhaled. “Which would mean they desecrated the bodies of their own compatriots. Not much of a retirement plan if you ask me.”</p> 
                   <p>“Bzzzzt–click” Whirp said, tugging desperately at the inventor’s arm. Droven didn’t need months exploring the Arcadian coastline with the construct to know what that meant. He dropped his goggles and spun to draw his hammer as Whirp gestured frantically toward the small hillock’s only safe pathway. Someone had snuck near their position, leaving obvious tracks behind. Droven glanced over his shoulder. The drop was too far to know whether he could leap down to the sands below and keep his footing.</p> 
                   <p>“Ho there! I warn you; I am armed and no easy prey. Allow me to negotiate for the release of your prisoners and the cessation of attacks against the ships passing by this shoreline. Otherwise, prepare for battle!”</p> 
                   <p>A pair of Wrecker scouts stepped out from the underbrush. A woman outstretched her arm to reveal a spider with barbed fur clamped around her wrist like a living gauntlet. The puckering spinneret twitched toward Droven, causing the inventor to tighten his grip on the hammer. The weapon was almost certainly a beast gun. He’d seen enough of them to know it possessed the abilities of the spider whose body it was constructed from. If he didn’t act first, he and Whirp would be enveloped in spiderweb and rolled down the embankment. Some heroes they would be—wrapped up like two helpless caterpillars in silk cocoons.</p> 
                   <p>Droven whistled sharply and dropped to his stomach. Whirp planted its spindly arms in the dirt and somersaulted toward the Wreckers, just before detonating in a roiling ball of flame. The inventor had rigged the little construct to explode on command, knowing it would survive the blast largely unharmed. The same could not be said of the two smugglers who rolled on the ground to extinguish their burning clothes. Droven rushed forward and struck each of their skulls with the hammer, holding back just enough of his strength to leave them alive. At least, he hoped. Neither strike had drawn much blood.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>It was only a matter of time before the explosion attracted other Wreckers, though with any luck the crest of the hillock obscured most of the remaining flames. Droven kicked sand over the parts of the smugglers that still smoldered and bound them with lengths of spare wire. He and Whirp had better move fast. But not before he snatched the spidery beast gun which had been so kindly gifted to them.</p> 
                   <p>“Point and click, right, Whirp?” Droven snapped the weapon in place atop his forearm, suppressing a grimace as its tiny hairs pricked his skin.</p> 
                   <p>The sounds of shouting in the distance grew louder. The inventor tapped Whirp on the shoulder, signaling the construct to collapse into a light carrying case. Droven scooped up his companion by its clockwork arm-turned-handle and dashed into the trees. </p> 
                   <p>Sliding behind some foliage, Droven steadied his stolen weapon on top of the little construct’s condensed body. Two triggers protruded from the abdomen of the taxidermic spider. He was reasonably confident that depressing the first would fire a net of silk webbing. He had no inkling about the second. There was only one way to find out. </p> 
                   <p>As the first Wrecker came into sight, Droven pulled the first trigger—only to discover the absurdity of his assumption. A barbed hair launched from the spider and stabbed the pirate in the neck. The smuggler collapsed to the ground in spastic convulsions just before growing still. Droven moved to the body, placing his hand on the Wrecker’s neck. No pulse. Droven struggled against the dread coalescing in the pit of his stomach. As much as the inventor detested unnecessary violence, his foe had undoubtedly met the same fate as the many innocent victims who crossed the pirates’ path. Perhaps he could find some solace in that.</p> 
                   <p>When the next smuggler came into sight, Droven pulled the second trigger. The beast gun fired the webbing he’d expected before, provoking a sigh of relief. The web spiraled outward from the beast gun, pinning the Wrecker to a nearby tree as it wrapped circles around the trunk. As the pirate pleaded for someone to cut him free, Droven realized he and his companion could soon find themselves outnumbered. He tapped Whirp once more and the tiny construct unfolded into its bipedal form. Pulling a pair of boots sized for the construct out of his backpack, Droven quickly fitted them onto Whirp’s stubby legs.</p> 
                   <p>“Lead them on a merry chase and then meet me at their bonfire. Understood?”</p> 
                   <p>“Whirrrrrrrpup–click–whirrrrrr!” the construct said in response, slamming its tiny heels together to activate the blast boots. Whirp rocketed skyward through the trees; its path lit by twin tails of flame. </p> 
                   <p>Droven moved quickly through the woods, heading toward the Wreckers’ bonfire and, most importantly, the stockade. When he arrived at camp, he slowed to sneak carefully behind the pair of guards who remained. As he moved, he pictured the rest of the Wreckers struggling to keep up as they chased the flash of Whirp’s fiery trail through the darkness. He smiled and shifted his hammer to his prosthetic hand. Droven rapped both pirates with a single flourish that would have been all but impossible with a limb comprised of flesh and blood. His last remaining enemies slumped to the ground unceremoniously, knocked cold.</p> 
                   <p>Droven dashed toward the prison. After releasing a small blade integrated into his metal arm, he slashed through the ropes that tied the door shut. He moved toward the nearest prisoner: a cleric bearing a silver symbol of Sarenrae who had been muffled with a cloth gag. Droven slid his blade softly under the fabric, gently enough to avoid piercing the prisoner’s cheek, and pulled. He cut her free just in time to make out, “–hind you!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven turned to behold his grave mistake. Three Wreckers remained behind, not two. The pirate Droven failed to spot had her own beast gun, this one made from the neck and maw of a fire-breathing drake.</p> 
                   <p>“Oi! Drop the gun!” the woman shouted.</p> 
                   <p>Hoping not to alarm her, Droven disconnected the spider gun from his arm and let it fall to the ground.</p> 
                   <p>“Thought you could steal from the Wreckers, eh? ‘Fraid we’re going to have to make an example out of you! Any last words?” She leveled the drake gun at Droven. </p> 
                   <p>Droven couldn’t help but glance toward the sky. Some twenty feet above the Wrecker, two thin lines of fire bisected the night sky. </p> 
                   <p>“Last words? Why, yes, I do have some.” Droven stifled a grin. “I’m afraid that you failed to account… for the powerful bond of friendship!” As the inventor yelled, he activated a large magnet attached to a disposable electric reservoir in his prosthetic arm. The magnetic force drew Whirp—who hovered above he and the Wrecker thanks to the blast boots Droven had fitted the construct with—down toward the inventor’s arm.</p> 
                   <p>The smuggler fired, unleashing a blast of flame from her drake gun. But it was too late. The little construct twisted its metallic body and absorbed the brunt of the explosion, shielding Droven from harm.</p> 
                   <p>Droven remembered the blade on his prosthetic hand. Just before he moved to strike, a thunderous explosion forced him to duck behind Whirp. When he peaked back over the construct’s shoulder, the Wrecker lie prone, screaming, and thrashing—totally enveloped in flame. Despite burning alive, she staggered to her feet and pointed the drake gun once more—first at Whirp, then at Droven.</p> 
                   <p>A small figure stepped out of the shadows behind her, holding a vial of alchemist’s fire in hand. Droven’s jaw dropped in disbelief.</p> 
                   <p>"Fumbus?" he coughed. “Where did you come from?” But Droven heard no words in response.</p> 
                   <p>Just another boom. </p>

                   <p>There are six Starfinder Society Scenarios that directly influence the Year of Redemption's Rise metaplot. Like last year, each will be marked with a special metaplot icon on the cover. Scenarios without this icon are adventures that don't directly tie into the events of Year of Redemption's Rise. However, these adventures still touch on this year's themes: reconciliation, redemption, heroism, and doing good in a galaxy that's got some tough times on the horizon.</p> 
                   <p>The Year of Redemption's Rise metaplot kicks off with <em>Starfinder Society Intro: Year of Redemption's Rise</em>, an adventure for levels 1–4 written by our very own Alex Speidel! This scenario marks Alex's first foray into writing Starfinder Society scenarios, and I promise he did not disappoint! This scenario debuts at PaizoCon 2022, alongside two other Starfinder Society Scenarios. While I recommend you begin your journey into this Year's metaplot with the <em>Year of Redemption's Rise</em>, the remaining scenarios in this year's metaplot can be played in any order.</p> 
                   <p>A new Year isn't the only exciting news I've got up my sleeve! I'm pleased to announce that the following five races are being moved to always available as of the beginning of Year 5: dragonkin, pahtra, sarcesian, shobhad, and vlaka. Additionally, the Year of Redemption's Rise shines a spotlight on some of the Starfinder Society's minor factions: the already established Manifold Host, and the brand-new Advocates and Cognates factions! More information on these three factions will be released right here, on the Paizo blog, in a few weeks.</p> 
                   <p>Want to learn more about the Year of Redemption's Rise or the Advocates? Check out the following interviews!</p>

                   <h2>GM/HQ Signups</h2> 
                   <p>GM and HQ signups for PaizoCon 2022 are now open! The form is linked below; before you fill it out, there are some important pieces of information you should know.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PaizoCon Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <b>does not guarantee acceptance</b>; you will receive an email with further information from the PaizoCon committee.</li> 
                    <li>Reward information is listed <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/communities/paizo/popvo/">on the Organized Play Foundation website</a>. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one; no hotel rooms are offered for PaizoCon, so volunteers will need to arrange their own accommodations.</li> 
                    <li>Applications submitted before <b>March 17</b> will be guaranteed to be cleared in time for priority GM signups. Volunteers will be accepted as space and time permit on a rolling basis after this date.</li> 
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out this form and then follow up by emailing paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. Anybody interested in running games outside of the Organized Play offerings (such as Infinite content, homebrew content, or games from other publishers) should email paizocon@paizo.com for more information about scheduling your offerings.</li> 
                    <li>In-person attendees and guests will be required to show proof of vaccination (including booster shots) and wear masks. The hotel may have less stringent requirements in common areas. Therefore, we will enforce our requirements in Paizo-controlled spaces such as the ballrooms, seminar rooms, gaming rooms, and the Paizo store. Failure to comply may result in your expulsion and a potential ban from future major conventions.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. </li>

                   <p>For purchasers of PaizoCon 2020 tickets who rolled them over to our next physical show, we will be updating your tickets to ones for PaizoCon 2022. Anyone who wishes for a refund can do so by contacting customer.service@paizo.com. Please use the subject line “PaizoCon 2020 Refund” to expedite your request. The deadline for refund requests will be March 11, 2022, after which we will open up PaizoCon 2022 tickets for general purchase and put PaizoCon Online tickets on sale. </p> 
                   <p>One change from prior in-person PaizoCons is that we are using Warhorn for all our event scheduling. We will have an initial schedule posted by March 21st and will update it as we add more events. If you are an author, third-party publisher, or Pathfinder Infinite content producer interested in running events, please stay tuned to the Paizo blog for more information about how to add your events to our online or physical schedule!</p> 
                   <p>Covid-19 remains an ongoing consideration, and Paizo is committed to the safety of the Paizo staff and attendees. The precautions we are taking include: </p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>In-person attendees are required to show proof of vaccination (including booster shots) and wear masks in all Paizo-controlled spaces such as ballrooms, seminar rooms, gaming spaces, and the Paizo store.</li> 
                    <li>No banquet event</li> 
                    <li>Hand sanitizer available in public spaces</li> 
                    <li>Reduced number of physical show tickets with a capped attendance of 500. </li> 
                    <li>More space between attendees in the seminar rooms, OP hall (between players and between tables), and in the Paizo store</li> 
                    <li>Paizo will pivot to an online-only event should conditions take a turn for the worse.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Look for more communication over the next few months as we finalize more details, including event registration dates. We look forward to seeing you either in person or online!</p>

                   <p><em>Pathfinder One-Shot: Mark of the Mantis</em> is a short Pathfinder Second Edition adventure, designed to be played in a single session lasting 3 to 4 hours. However, with opportunities for roleplaying and plenty of combat, the adventure could easily make for two exciting evenings of play. <em>Mark of the Manti</em>s includes pregenerated characters (found in a separate downloadable PDF) with interwoven backstories that contextualize their relationships and further enrich the adventure itself. This adventure should be played with all four characters. If only three players are available, the GM should bring in the fourth character as an NPC. This adventure can be easily adjusted to suit any party of four themed around the Red Mantis assassin organization. </p>

Now, contracted by an interested party, a group of adventurers must head into the ruins of Bulviss to find a missing deed and any other surviving treasures. Have the demons truly been removed, or are there other, darker secrets waiting in the ruins?</p>

                   <p>Dan 'Pan' Grossett started the Cosmopunk (<a href="https://twitter.com/cosmopunkpod">@Cosmopunk twitter</a>) podcast a year ago with 3 friends and quickly found himself charmed with the Paizo AP community. Since then, he can be found on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Stellarencore">@Stellarencore</a>) taking part in several other Starfinder shows, helping set up crossover events and dipping their toe into the world of Pathfinder 2E with the Manapot EU happy hour. (Twitch.tv/manapotstudios)</p> 
                   <p>“Coming to the hobby only recently, I was kicking myself for not taking up TTRPGs sooner. It's been a great source of new adventures and new friends. If you're even halfway curious but worried about what others may think, or sticking out at the table, I promise you if you find a good group and jump straight in, you won't regret it!” </p>

                   <h3>Navaar Jackson (He/Him)</h3> 
                   <p>Navaar is the creator and host of the Secret Nerd Podcast, a TTRPG Talk Show that features guests from across the spectrum talking about how they got into TTRPG’s and why the games are for everyone. Creating a show that is very diverse and inclusive is very important to Navaar, because it helps add to the space in a positive way. Along with these episodes, he’s also done two bonus episodes (so far) playing one-shots of Pathfinder 2e with other creators. This has been a great way to introduce new folks to the system, as well as expose listeners to a game he is fond of, with interesting stories. Along with the podcast, Navaar is also an aspiring writer and game designer, so keep an eye out for future projects!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">This month we’re back on the trail of legendary explorer Jelev Rasheen! Well known for her voyages at the dawn of Drift travel, Jelev made regular trips into the Drift, returning every few years with holds full of treasures and relics from distant worlds. After her mysterious disappearance, dozens of alleged children, partners, and adventuring companions spread one final tale about Rasheen: that she was last seen commanding a fleet of ships laden with treasure. Over the years, the Starfinder Society has investigated two of Jelev Rasheen’s treasure beacons, and now they’ve discovered a third. So buckle up and blast off, Starfinders! There’s treasure out there! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-414-Rasheens-Remembrance"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-14: Rasheen’s Riches</em></a> is a scenario for levels 7–10 written by Mara Lynn Butler.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Starfinders!</p> 
                   <p itemprop="description">This month we’re back on the trail of legendary explorer Jelev Rasheen! Well known for her voyages at the dawn of Drift travel, Jelev made regular trips into the Drift, returning every few years with holds full of treasures and relics from distant worlds. After her mysterious disappearance, dozens of alleged children, partners, and adventuring companions spread one final tale about Rasheen: that she was last seen commanding a fleet of ships laden with treasure. Over the years, the Starfinder Society has investigated two of Jelev Rasheen’s treasure beacons, and now they’ve discovered a third. So buckle up and blast off, Starfinders! There’s treasure out there! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-414-Rasheens-Remembrance"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-14: Rasheen’s Riches</em></a> is a scenario for levels 7–10 written by Mara Lynn Butler.</p> 
                   <p>Best of luck!</p>

                   <p>Pathfinders! You’re needed! We’ve got another sanctuary to shatter this month, and some ancient ruins that could use a bit more exploring, reporting, and cooperating.</p> 
                   <p>First, to the ruins! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a> takes us back to Darkmoon Vale, where Venture-Captain Luna Aldred needs some Pathfinders to further explore the dwarven ruins buried beneath the volcano known as Droskar’s Crag. She wants the agents to scout the area and find out what happened to a duergar raiding party that seems to have vanished! Sound familiar? Think you’ve seen these ruins before? That’s because this scenario takes us deeper into the site we initially explored in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ni/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Enter-the-Pallid-Peak"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em></a>! You don’t need to play <em>Enter the Pallid Peak</em> before you enjoy this new adventure, but it may enhance your experience if you do.</p> 
                   <p>I don’t want to spoil anything, but there is a lot going on beneath Droskar’s Crag. <em>Delve the Pallid Depths</em> presents the player characters with an important decision about future expeditions in the ruins, so if you want to weigh in, be sure to play the adventure! <em>Delve the Pallid Depths</em> is a creepy dungeon exploration adventure for levels 1–4, and it’s Caryn DiMarco’s first full-length Pathfinder Society adventure. Enjoy!</p>

                   <p>Next up, we have a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenario. If you’ve been paying attention, you know that this year’s metaplot is broken up into <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shy6">multiple arcs</a>, each focused on a particular nation in the Inner Sea. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-311-No-Time-for-Treason"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason</em></a> takes us to Oppara, the capital of Taldor! Lady Gloriana Morilla, a long-time ally of the Society, has requested aid in following a series of strange crimes across the city. The crimes target assets and allies of Grand Princess Eutropia, and the perpetrators are using custom <em>wayfinders</em> to aid their foul deeds. The Society’s own venture-captain, the mage-machinist Muesello, is an expert in such customizations, and Gloriana hasn’t been able to track him down. Is he somehow involved in the crimes? She can’t bring herself to believe that her old friend has turned traitor—it’s up to you, Pathfinders, to learn the truth!</p> 
                   <p><em>No Time for Treason</em> is an urban investigation adventure for levels 3–6, written by veteran organized play author Rigby Bendele. Watch your backs!</p> 
                   <p>That’s all for now. It’s a good day to explore, report, and cooperate!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>ON KILLING KIN</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Amiri's arms burned as she hauled herself upward. Her hands cramped from finding tenuous grips on small extrusions of stone, and one particularly vicious bit of rock had sliced open a good gash below her knee out of what she assumed was sheer spite. She unspooled her rope as she went, securing it whenever she found an anchor point she was sure could bear Branum and Oska's weight.</p> 
                   <p>Below her, the siblings moved slowly. They'd lashed themselves together and to the rope, and Oska helped haul her brother upward, pointing out easy hand- and footholds wherever she could. Oska looked up, the light from above casting a narrow band across her face. "Getting tired yet?" she called up. "You're slowing down."</p> 
                   <p>"How about you don't insult the woman with the rope," Amiri replied, scowling down at her.</p> 
                   <p>"How about… we all… just try… not to plunge to our deaths," Branum panted.</p> 
                   <p>"From that height, you probably wouldn't die from the fall. You'd shatter your legs and starve to death," Amiri said.</p> 
                   <p>"You'd die of thirst way before starving to death," Oska countered.</p> 
                   <p>"Is this… supposed to be making me feel better?" Branum asked. He paused, clinging to the rope as he struggled to catch his breath.</p> 
                   <p>"I'm not going to let you fall," Oska said seriously.</p> 
                   <p>"I know. Besides, I could… always give us… a soft landing. I'm not… completely useless," Branum reminded her. He waggled his fingers, and a few anemic sparks of light danced around them.</p> 
                   <p>"Stop showing off and save your strength. Come on. Halfway there," she said, fondness in her voice.</p> 
                   <p>He nodded, steeled himself, and began to climb again. He was an odd one to find among the Six Bears, Amiri thought. He trusted his sister—and more than that, he readily accepted her aid and comfort. Not once had he objected to her taking the lead on physical tasks. It truly didn't seem to bother him that a woman was stronger than he was. That wasn't a trait she'd encountered from her kinsmen often. Or ever.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri pulled herself up to a new handhold, then paused. It wasn't far to the top, now—she was close enough to see beyond the slim opening to a ceiling of stone. The top of the shaft led to another sheltered area, but given the light coming down through it, it wasn't entirely covered.</p> 
                   <p>From above came a series of yips and snarls, then the scrambling of claws. Amiri gestured sharply for the others to halt and be silent as the growling intensified. Something clattered, and then a few bones—gristle still clinging to them—toppled over the side of the shaft. Amiri clung tight to the wall to avoid the debris. Branum stifled a startled sound as a femur smacked his shoulder.</p> 
                   <p><em>Wait</em>, Amiri motioned. The snarling and yipping and scrabbling continued. The cubs were playing.</p> 
                   <p>The sounds went on for several minutes before falling into abrupt silence. Amiri waited another few moments, then began to climb again. They moved without speaking now, slow but steady.</p> 
                   <p>Before long, Amiri was at the top of the shaft. She pushed her head and shoulders out of the opening, scanning for the peryton and its cubs.</p> 
                   <p>The cubs lay curled up together on the far side of a large rock overhang, its floor littered with bones, offal, and half-eaten carcasses. One of the cubs had fallen asleep gnawing on a skull that might have belonged to a halfling; the other had a hand, half stripped of flesh, tucked between its paws. Beyond the overhang was a small plateau with slopes dropping off precipitously to all sides. There was no sign of the larger creature.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri climbed out as silently as she could, then turned to help the others. Oska moved off to the side to push as Amiri pulled, and they got Branum up onto level ground, where he half-crouched and half-collapsed, wheezing as quietly as he could. Oska scrambled up, quick as a squirrel, but her arms were shaking, and she flexed her hands like they were cramped.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's limbs weren't thanking her, either. "Best go before the mother comes back," she whispered.</p> 
                   <p>Oska nodded and tapped Branum's shoulder. He suppressed a groan as he staggered up to his feet, and they edged along the side of the sheltered area, Oska leading and Amiri taking up the rear to keep an eye on the cubs.</p> 
                   <p>One moment, Oska was stepping out into the open, looking behind her with a frown to track her brother's progress. The next moment she was gone, snatched into the air with a scream.</p> 
                   <p>"Oska!" Branum yelled. Amiri shoved past him. The peryton's wingbeats scattered dust and debris as the creature climbed, the grip of its hind talons piercing the flesh of Oska's shoulders. The girl screamed in pain and twisted—not to get free, but to throw her bow and quiver as hard as she could. They clattered to the ground 20 feet away. Amiri dove for them, snatched them up.</p> 
                   <p>She sighted along the arrow. Waiting. The peryton circled around, moving awkwardly due to Oska's thrashing weight beneath it. </p> 
                   <p>"Damn it, hold still or it'll drop you off the cliff!" Amiri shouted. "Wait!"</p> 
                   <p>The creature banked, passing high overhead. Oska, miraculously, went still in its grip.</p> 
                   <p>"Hope you weren't lying about that soft landing," Amiri said to Branum, not waiting for him to answer. The peryton's shadow darkened the edge of the plateau.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri loosed the arrow. It struck the beast's left hind talon. The creature let out a strangled yelp of pain and lost its grip on the struggling huntress. She plunged downward. Branum reached out a hand and cried out a single word. Oska landed in a light crouch as the peryton tumbled in the air, righted, and wheeled away.</p> 
                   <p>"Can we drive it off?" Branum asked. "Run?"</p> 
                   <p>"We were in its nest. Its cubs are in there. It isn't going to leave us alone now," Amiri said. She tossed the bow and quiver back to Oska, who winced as she worked her punctured shoulders. Amiri unstrapped the unwieldy, broken base of her sword from her back, gripping the hilt in both hands.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton's shadow glided over the plateau once more. Only its shape was wrong.</p> 
                   <p>"It took your shadow," Oska said, seeing the same. She gave Amiri a considering look. "It's coming for you."</p> 
                   <p>"Which means you could run," Amiri replied. "It won't chase you while I'm still standing."</p> 
                   <p>The beast howled. It folded its wings in a dive, eyes fixed on Amiri. Oska and Branum fell back. And Amiri leapt to meet the creature's charge.</p> 
                   <p>They met in the air—blade and beast, fang and fury. The peryton's eyes blazed with the fire of a mother whose cubs had been threatened. Amiri's blood sang with rage of her own. Anger for the beast, yes—but her old anger burned far brighter as she tumbled to the stony ground with the monster.</p> 
                   <p>She chanced a quick glance: the siblings were gone. <em>Good</em>, she thought. They'd be safe. They'd live. Maruk wouldn't have any more reason to haunt her.</p> 
                   <p>Her jagged blade slashed across the beast's chest, and the mountains rang with her brothers' mocking laughter. Teeth snapped in the air an inch from her throat, and the air slithered with whispers. <em>It isn't right. She brings shame to all of us. Something must be done.</em></p> 
                   <p>They had betrayed her. Made a fool of her. Humiliated her and tried to lead her to her death. But they had failed. She had showed them her true strength.</p> 
                   <p>She struck at the peryton again and again in a storm of steel and claw. It darted in for quick attacks, retreating before she could get a proper strike in. Any time she closed, it used a few quick wingbeats to reposition, sending her scrambling around the plateau, wary of the sheer cliffs to every side. The broken blade was unbalanced and unwieldy. Fury collapsed into frustration, and she stood panting, both her and the beast bleeding from a half dozen minor wounds.</p> 
                   <p>She'd put her back to the sheltered overhang, steering clear of the precipitous drop-offs—all too aware of how easy it would be for the peryton to fling her over the edge with a toss of its gore-rimed antlers.</p> 
                   <p>A sharp pain shot through Amiri's calf. She let out a cry of pain, twisting and striking out. The broken blade swung, cleaving in half the peryton cub that had sunk its teeth into her leg. The other sprang up, needle teeth clamping around her wrist, as its mother let out a howl and charged.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri flung the cub away as the larger beast's antlers caught her up and threw her back against the far wall of the cave. Her head hit stone with a crack. Stars burst in her vision, and she collapsed to the ground in a stunned crouch. The peryton paced forward, opening its jaws to bare its yellowed teeth.</p> 
                   <p>There was a crackling sound, and lightning arced, blasting into the peryton's side. Two arrows followed in quick succession, and the peryton screamed, rearing away. Amiri launched herself forward, stars still dancing in her eyes, and dashed past the beast.</p> 
                   <p>Oska and Branum stood at the edge of the plateau. Branum raised his hands, light dancing at his fingertips. Oska set another arrow to her bow. Amiri skidded to a stop in front of them.</p> 
                   <p>"What do you think you're doing?" she demanded. "I told you to run."</p> 
                   <p>"Talked it over. Decided not to listen to you," Branum said cheerfully.</p> 
                   <p>"We don't leave kin to fight alone," Oska said firmly.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri stared. It had been a long time—a very long time—since anyone had claimed her as kin. "I killed your father," she said hollowly. "He was a good man. More or less."</p> 
                   <p>"You killed your kin," Oska agreed. Her eyes were bright. "But you know what, Amiri? I'm better than you."</p> 
                   <p>The peryton staggered into the light. It reared up on its hind legs, bellowing out a call to shake the mountains.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri and her kin turned to face it.</p>

                   <p>Amiri dumped the waterskin over her head, rinsing some of the blood out of her hair. The sun was going down. The cold air would keep the peryton's corpse, laid out on the plateau behind her, from rotting. But there were other scavengers in these mountains, and they'd be along soon to take their portion of the kill.</p> 
                   <p>Oska had already carved the antlers from its head and bound them together to carry over her shoulder, as a trophy.</p> 
                   <p>"You know you won't be able to claim that as your kill," Amiri said. She flicked her wet hair back from her face.</p> 
                   <p>Oska didn't meet her eyes. "I'll say Branum killed it."</p> 
                   <p>Branum laughed aloud. "Yeah, they'll certainly believe that."</p> 
                   <p>"We'll figure it out," Oska said, securing her makeshift straps.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri just shook her head. She'd never have let someone else claim one of her deeds at that age. She'd have shouted it to the whole clan at every opportunity.</p> 
                   <p><em>And look how that turned out</em>, she thought. She spat.</p> 
                   <p>"Can I have that?" Branum asked. Amiri gave him a questioning look. He gestured at the two halves of her blade that rested on the ground beside her.</p> 
                   <p>"You couldn't even lift the thing," she told him, amused.</p> 
                   <p>"I mean I can fix it for you," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>Oska straightened up. A frown creased her lips. "That's the sword that—"</p> 
                   <p>"It's a sword," Branum said. "Just a tool. What matters is who wields it, not what it's done."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri gave him a level look. "The woman who wields this sword is the one that killed your father," she reminded him. "You really want to give me my blade back?"</p> 
                   <p>Branum looked over at the dead peryton. "Honestly? I want you to die a slow and painful death," he said, his cheerful tone unwavering. "But that wouldn't do anybody any good, would it? You took my father from me. I've got no interest in forgiving you. And I've got no interest in being a kinslayer. So now I get to choose how I carry that—how I bear my choices without breaking. This is how I'm going to do it."</p> 
                   <p>He stepped forward and reached for the sword. Neither Amiri nor Oska said anything to stop him as he dragged the pieces over to a clear patch of ground. He stood with an expression of deep concentration, his hands held over the blade.</p> 
                   <p>Slowly, the segments shivered toward one another. The metal gleamed. The seam lit with a soft, silver light—and then the light faded, and the blade was whole once more.</p> 
                   <p>Branum stepped away, not touching it again. He bent to pick up his pack and settled it on his shoulder. "That's done, then," he said simply.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri hefted the blade. The familiar pull at her muscles was welcome. The guilt needling through her was not.</p> 
                   <p>"Let's go," Oska said, touching her brother's arm. They turned away.</p> 
                   <p>"Don't go back," Amiri said, staring at the sword. Behind her, their footsteps halted.</p> 
                   <p>"What else are we supposed to do?" Oska asked.</p> 
                   <p>"Just leave." Amiri lowered the sword and turned toward them. "Leave before they find a way to kill you, or kill everything you are."</p> 
                   <p>"It's not that easy," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's lips twisted. "If it was, maybe I could've done it, before it was too late. But you're smarter than I ever was. Or your brother is, at least."</p> 
                   <p>Oska and Branum glanced at each other. "We don't hate the Six Bears," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>"Neither did I. I loved my brothers," Amiri said. "Didn't stop them trying to kill me. Didn't stop me killing them."</p> 
                   <p>"Where are we supposed to go, then? With you?" Oska asked scornfully.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri snorted. "None of us would survive that," she said, and Oska chuckled in reluctant agreement. "The world's bigger than you think. Go see what it holds. Leave—while you still have the option of coming home, if you decide that's what you want."</p> 
                   <p>Oska didn't answer. Neither did Branum. They turned away, setting out without another word. But Branum looked at Oska, and Oska looked at Branum, and Amiri could tell that each was thinking of the other. Of the things they could achieve, if they found the place where they belonged. </p> 
                   <p>They'd leave, she thought. Not for themselves, but each for the other. Maybe someday they would even return—as she never could.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri made her way down the opposite flank of the mountain, away from the siblings. Away from the Six Bears.</p> 
                   <p>The wind howled between the peaks. She listened long and hard, but there were no words within. It was only the wind.</p>

                   <p>Paizo will be attending the Gen Con 2022 game convention from August 4–7 in Indianapolis. You’ll see the Paizo booth in the exhibit hall and the return of Organized Play to the Sagamore Ballroom. Organized Play will have a slightly smaller number of tables than in prior years, so we encourage you to sign up for events early to claim your spot.</p> 
                   <p>For those unable to make the trek to Gen Con, Paizo will also host a suite of online events and seminars. This year’s Pathfinder interactive special will premiere simultaneously at the physical event and Gen Con Online. </p> 
                   <p>We’ll release additional details in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>THE SPLINTERING OF BONE</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Branum and Oska muttered to each other as Amiri prepared. She did her best to ignore them. She couldn't understand them, anyway—they were talking in an odd, garbled tongue, and suddenly she remembered that, too. The twins with their private language, infuriating Maruk because he thought his children were making fun of him. He'd always been going on about how his son was going to be as mighty a warrior as Maruk himself.</p> 
                   <p>She glanced sidelong at Branum. He was shivering in the cool air of the cave, and his sister tossed her own cloak over his shoulders without comment. So much for Maruk's ambitions. He hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed in the boy.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri turned on her heel, leaving the thought behind, and made her way to the back of the cave. A squeeze indeed. She <em>hmmed</em>, hand against the rock.</p> 
                   <p>"Something wrong?" Branum asked.</p> 
                   <p>"Just wondering how many ways to die there are, shoving yourself into a crack like that," Amiri mused.</p> 
                   <p>"I could list them, if it helps," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>She gave him a flat look. "It really doesn't," she said. She turned sideways and slid into the gap.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri wasn't afraid of tight spaces, as a rule, but a space this tight, it worked its way into the back of your brain, where all the deepest, most primal instincts hung around to tell you what was going to kill you. This was a killing space. A grasping, crushing, suffocating space. There wasn't even room to set her feet flat on the floor—she had to brace her legs at odd angles, push her way through with her calves and shoulders and by pulling with the tips of one outstretched hand. Behind her, Branum was praying. Behind him, Oska muttered to him or to herself, Amiri couldn't tell. She couldn't turn her head to look. It was like having ghosts at her back, whispering unseen.</p> 
                   <p>Then, suddenly, she was free. The walls of the squeeze released her, and she stepped easily out into a wider tunnel. She worked her limbs, flexing to bring some feeling back into them.</p> 
                   <p>"Made it through," she called back. Branum thanked a half-dozen gods and other entities, and the sounds of scraping and huffing intensified as the twins hurried to join her. From there, the trek was easier, though hardly swift going. Without the sun to track time, it was hard to tell how long they traveled, clambering over shelves of rock and backtracking when they hit dead ends. They hadn't found an exit yet, but they hadn't run out of cave, either.</p> 
                   <p>"I can smell fresh air," Branum said at last, sniffing theatrically.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri stood next to him and tested the air. "This way," she said, setting off down a side tunnel. She only made it a few steps before the tunnel abruptly ended in a small, round chamber.</p> 
                   <p>The floor was scattered with bones.</p> 
                   <p>She reached for her dagger, cautioning the others back. The bones looked animal—mostly. Half a deer lay in the middle of the floor, blood dried black but flesh not yet rotted away. Its blood had spattered half the chamber.</p> 
                   <p>But it wasn’t the deer that held her gaze. Amiri’s eyes were fixed on a human skeleton sprawled across an outcrop of rock toward the back of the room. Bits of desiccated flesh and moldering clothes clung to the bones. A few scraps of leather armor still adorned its hips and chest, stamped with a pattern of paw prints and swirling lines, almost impossible to make out after so many years. But Amiri remembered them perfectly.</p> 
                   <p>"Who do you think they were?" Branum asked, moving cautiously into the chamber. "What were they doing down here?"</p> 
                   <p>"Does it matter?" Oska asked. "Something's been eating things in here. We shouldn't stick around."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri tightened her jaw. "It matters," she said. "That's Erskar. He was wearing that armor the day I killed him."</p> 
                   <p>Oska hissed between her teeth. Branum looked alarmed, straightening up. "I knew he was with Father that day, but his body wasn't found. Some people thought you'd run off together."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri snorted. "With Erskar? Not on your life."</p> 
                   <p>"So he survived? Snuck off on his own for some reason?" Branum mused.</p> 
                   <p>"None of those men would have abandoned their clan," Oska spat.</p> 
                   <p>"Certainly not without most of his guts. Erskar was dead. They were all dead," Amiri said, and as always, the image was as fresh and real in her mind as the day it happened. <em>They brought it on themselves</em>, she thought. They'd meant her to die. They'd weaseled their way out of calling it murder, but they'd brought her there to meet her end.</p> 
                   <p>"Then how is he <em>here</em>?" Branum asked. Then, "Oh!" He pointed to Erskar's chest, and Amiri saw at once what he'd spotted. She'd left Erskar gutted on the ground. But the skeleton's legs were splintered, one arm broken clean through. And his ribs had been shattered, pried apart.</p>

                   <p>Perytons preferred live prey, but in lean times they scavenged, just like everything else. So the peryton—or its parent, maybe—had taken the corpse for a snack, flying up into the peaks with it. It had eaten its favorite part of the body, and apparently not gotten around to the rest. But no peryton would roost in these caves, even if it could fit.</p> 
                   <p>"No tunnels <em>out</em>. But what about <em>up</em>?” Amiri mused.</p> 
                   <p>Branum nodded and lifted his crystal, peering up toward the ceiling. And there it was. A chimney leading up out of the tunnel. Wider than the squeeze, at least. Wide enough for the corpse of a large man to tumble through and be forgotten, rotting away year after year.</p> 
                   <p>“That’s our way out,” Amiri said.</p> 
                   <p>“Looks like it,” Branum concurred.</p> 
                   <p>“You know, if the peryton’s meals are falling down here this frequently…” Oska began.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri nodded. “It’s eating up there. Which means that’s probably its nest.”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh. Lovely,” Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>“It’s our only option,” Amiri said. “So we’d better get climbing.” She’d take fighting the peryton over sticking around here with these cubs, that was certain.</p> 
                   <p>“Not yet,” Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>“You getting fond of the place?” Amiri asked her, but Oska glanced sidelong at Branum—who was trying to hide the fact that he was limping and out of breath, and pale as the belly of a fish.</p> 
                   <p>“We should rest a while,” Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>“I won’t make it up with or without rest,” Branum said, grimacing. “If you can get up and secure a rope or something…”</p> 
                   <p>“We all go up,” Amiri said. She wasn’t going to leave the boy behind. And she certainly wasn’t going anywhere alone with his sister. Keeping Branum around was the only way to be sure one of them wasn’t going to end up dead.</p> 
                   <p>“We’ve got rope. We can secure it as we go, help you up,” Oska said. “But I’d rather do that with some rest and some food in my belly.”</p> 
                   <p>Amiri’s stomach rumbled on cue. “I hope you brought something to eat, because that deer’s long past being appetizing,” she said.</p> 
                   <p>Oska gave a curt nod, and against their united front, Branum gave in. Oska set down her pack and pulled out salted fish, mashed and dried berries formed into a leather, and a handful of nuts. She broke the fish into three shares. Amiri expected to be handed a smaller one, but Oska had portioned them evenly. Even if she did drop it into Amiri’s hand like she was afraid of touching her.</p> 
                   <p>“That’s all you brought?” Amiri asked.</p> 
                   <p>Oska shrugged as she handed her brother his share. “It’s all we had. Like I said, game has been scarce.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re young yet. The clan shouldn’t be letting you go hungry,” Amiri said, troubled. “Not Maruk’s kids.”</p> 
                   <p>She’d spent her years of exile thinking often enough of that last day—and less often of the day before. It was painful, remembering the way her clan had jeered and mocked her behind her back, had discussed her death with gleeful anticipation. But that pain was twinned with anger, and anger was an ally.</p> 
                   <p>It was the earlier memories that were harder. Remembering not how Maruk had laughed at her, but the times they’d laughed together. Remembering not the way he’d died, cleaved limb from limb in the face of her rage, but the times they’d raced and wrestled and bickered. She’d made Maruk laugh a lot, she remembered. His wife had always thought her a bad influence. She’d thought he was one of the few that truly didn’t see her as a woman who ought to know her place, but as a warrior who’d earned it.</p> 
                   <p>“It was like that a while,” Branum said. He sat with his legs splayed before him, picking at his food. “We had everything we could ask for. Everyone was always telling me how I was going to carry on Father’s legacy. Be a great warrior, like he was. And then I wasn’t, and they lost interest.”</p> 
                   <p>“Someone had to provide for us,” Oska said. She hunched over her food, not meeting Amiri’s eyes. “But that only made it worse. Turned near everyone against us.”</p> 
                   <p>“For feeding yourselves? I know it’s not common for a woman, but—"</p> 
                   <p>Oska looked up, eyes alight with hatred. “It’s not just <em>not common</em> anymore. Not for the Six Bears. After what you did? ‘Look what happens when you let a woman think she’s a warrior,’ they said.”</p> 
                   <p>“You think I didn’t hear that, too? ‘Watch out, or you’ll end up like Amiri,’ they’d tell the other girls. I never let it stop me,” Amiri said. She’d always taken it as a point of pride. <em>Like Amiri</em> meant strong, capable, unstoppable. She didn't want the things it denied her—the husband, the children, the days spent tending the fire and tanning another hunter's hides.</p> 
                   <p>"And look what happened," Oska said dully. "You think that any girl in the Six Bears is allowed to even <em>look</em> at a sword, after you proved what a curse it is, to let a woman fight? I can't even feed myself and my brother without skulking around in secret. Maybe you should have let it stop you. Slow you down. Maybe the next girl would've had an easier time of it."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri grunted. "I won't make myself less than I am. Not for anyone. Being what the clan wanted me to be would have killed me."</p> 
                   <p>"Then leave," Branum whispered. They looked at him, surprised. He hadn't spoken this whole time, just stared off into the distance, but now his gaze was intense. "You could have just left."</p> 
                   <p>"My <em>kin</em>, your <em>father</em>, arranged to have me killed," Amiri growled.</p> 
                   <p>"They never did anything to you. Just let you do it to yourself," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri shook her head. "They wanted me dead. They betrayed me. And I—"</p> 
                   <p>"Could have left," Branum repeated. "You weren't in danger. They were no threat to you. You could have walked away and lived a life to prove them wrong."</p> 
                   <p>He was wrong. Someone else could have walked away, but Amiri couldn't. She was going to die that day, or they were. There was never going to be another path.</p> 
                   <p>"We should go," Oska said roughly. She brushed crumbs from her fingers and stood. She put out her hand to help her brother up.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri didn't know how she could explain what had happened in a way that the two would understand. It wasn't that Branum was wrong. She hadn't been defending herself. And it had been her own foolish pride and boastfulness that had made any of it possible. </p> 
                   <p>For her kin to betray her. Humiliate her. Take her home from her—for how could she return, no matter the outcome, once she knew what they had intended? They wanted her dead or broken.</p> 
                   <p>And she couldn't walk away. <em>She</em> couldn't. Someone else might have. Would have. There was nothing to stop her except herself. Her rage. Her grief at everything that had been torn so brutally from her in those horrible moments.</p> 
                   <p>She should have walked away. But Amiri of the Six Bears couldn't.</p> 
                   <p>Maybe she could, now. But Amiri of no clan was not the woman who had been lured into those mountains. She was not the woman who had left. And she could not go back to that moment, and stand in the place Amiri of the Six Bears stood, and make her choices for her.</p> 
                   <p>She could only move on.</p> 
                   <p>Only move up.</p> 
                   <p>She could only keep climbing.</p>

                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available February 23, 2022:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-311-No-Time-for-Treason"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason</em></a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02arg?Pathfinder-Bounty-18-From-Family-Lost"><em>Pathfinder Bounty #18: From Family Lost</em></a><br> <em>Pathfinder One-Shot #4: Mark of the Mantis</em></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-414-Rasheens-Remembrance"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-14: Rasheen's Remembrance</em></a>*</p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Pathfinder Society-Specific Rule Updates</h2> 
                   <p>This month, we published several rule clarifications &amp; updates that apply specifically to the Pathfinder Society campaign. These clarifications are always available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/faq">Organized Play FAQ pages</a> or in the appropriate <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/Homepage"><em>Guide to Organized Play</em></a>, but we wanted to make sure we highlighted them here.</p> 
                   <h3>Massive Damage</h3> 
                   <p>When considering if a character would be killed outright by Massive Damage, you should treat their maximum Hit Points as 20 if they have fewer than 20 maximum Hit Points. This clarification is to attempt to avoid killing first-level characters outright. If a new player is about to do something reckless that will almost certainly result in their death (such as their character leaping off a cliff), ensure that they understand the potential consequences first.</p> 
                   <h3>Similar Lore</h3> 
                   <p>If a scenario calls for a specific Lore and a player has an extremely similar Lore (such as Pathfinder Lore in place of Pathfinder Society Lore), the GM should permit the use of that Lore. If a Lore is adjacent (e.g. Academia Lore in place of Library Lore), the GM can permit its use if they feel the two overlap enough. Ultimately, the GM is empowered to use their best judgment in such situations. This guidance has been floating around for a while, so we wanted to codify it in the FAQ page.</p> 
                   <h3>Additional Languages</h3> 
                   <p>The Character Creation section of the <em>Guide to Organized Play</em> has been updated to grant all Pathfinder Society characters an additional regional language at character creation. It’s important to us that the characters in the campaign represent the diversity of the world of Golarion, and this small change ensures that characters from a region outside the Inner Sea can more accurately represent their home and know their home region’s language. Most characters will gain an additional language as a result of this update.</p> 
                   <h3>Bequeathal Boons</h3> 
                   <p>The section of the Bequeathal boons that required a character receiving access to wait until their level matched the level of the originating chronicle sheet has been removed. This created unintentional tangles with sanctioned material that could be applied to a character of any level and was unnecessary with the way the game system gives most options a level anyway. The boons have been updated in the Achievement Points store; any previously-downloaded versions can be downloaded again to update the language, but doing so is not required.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Errata</h2> 
                   <p>Last week, the Starfinder team <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/faq">released some errata</a>, including updates for the newly-released <em>Galactic Magic</em>. In particular, this errata changed the text of the Genetics Field of Study for biohackers.</p> 
                   <p>Any character who finds that this change materially affects their character is free to choose a different field of study for their biohacker with no required time or credit investment. We are updating the language around similar rules updates in the <em>Guide to Organized Play</em> to ensure that future changes of the same type will be handled similarly.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>This month was a busy month for sanctioning! We released sanctioning for <em>Starfinder Galactic Magic</em> on release date, and then updated it a few hours later to allow another option through (you’re welcome, vanguard fans)! We also updated the sanctioning for the <em>Character Operations Manual</em> to finally permit Qi Adept through for soldiers. For Pathfinder Society (First Edition), the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path is sanctioned for play and available for reporting.</p> 
                   <p>February is a fairly quiet month on the product release front, so it’s possible that there won’t be any new content next time I talk to you. I’m working with our art team to get the final updates of the older sanctioned content completed so as to ensure that all sanctioned material is consistent and awards the correct rewards. Generally speaking, the next material to be newly sanctioned will be Book of the Dead and the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society (Second Edition); the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path for Starfinder Society; and the Tyrant’s Grasp Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society (First Edition), which should close the book on new material for that campaign.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours! </p>
                   <p>This month, we completed a hat trick for the first time, with one new 5-rank GM in each program!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Wally Waltner<br> <b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Landon Hatfield<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Jimmy Dick</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>That’s quite enough from me, so I’ll sign off now. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stay tuned for news about SFS Year 5, coming soon!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>STRAY CUBS</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description"></p>
                   <p>Sometimes, when Amiri was bored, she considered all the ways she could have died over the years. Not that she had any desire to analyze them strategically, as one companion had suggested. Nor to contemplate the inevitability of death and its philosophical implications, as another had asked.</p> 
                   <p>Mostly, she found it oddly soothing to know that death lurked so near, waiting for a step to the right instead of left, an undercooked bit of meat, a tent pitched under the wrong overhang. Death could come because of a mistake, a miscalculation, a failure—but it could come as easily from fortune's slightest whim.</p> 
                   <p>She couldn't decide which sort of death this one was—error or chance. She debated it groggily in her mind for a few seconds before realizing that the fact that she was thinking about it at all probably meant she wasn’t actually dead.</p> 
                   <p>The cold and all-too-familiar kiss of a blade at her throat, though, suggested that such luck might not last long.</p> 
                   <p>She blinked grit from her eyes, but it didn't help much with the view. She lay on her side, her lower body half-buried under rocks and dirt, facing a rough stone wall a foot from her nose. One arm was pinned awkwardly under her. A hand held her by the hair, and another held a knife to her neck. </p> 
                   <p>"Oska, what do you think you're doing?" a low voice asked. The boy.</p> 
                   <p>"Don't you know who this is?" his sister replied.</p> 
                   <p>"You're not going to slit the throat of an unconscious woman," he said, sounding much surer about it than Amiri was.</p> 
                   <p>"I'm not unconscious, if it helps," Amiri grated out. The girl let out a startled oath, scrambling back. Amiri's mouth felt like it had been packed solid with dust. She coughed and tasted blood—hopefully from biting her tongue, not anything internal and annoyingly dire.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri twisted onto her back, bringing herself around as best she could. Her legs remained trapped in place, but at least now she could look over at the two young hunters. The girl clutched a dagger like a claw, teeth bared and eyes wild. The boy hovered nearby, expression nervous. It was thanks to him she could see anything at all—the weak, steady light filling the cavern emanated from a small crystal held in his hand.</p> 
                   <p>Up close, she guessed the two of them were maybe 15 or 16, but theirs was the battered kind of youth that came of dangerous places like this. The girl might have been pretty in a dull kind of way, but the scars on her cheek and arms rescued her, made her interesting. The boy had a lean, half-starved look, with hollow eyes and a frail energy around him.</p> 
                   <p> “Well?” Amiri said, breaking the silence. “If you’re going to kill me, now’s the time. It’d spare us all the trouble of digging me out, at least.”</p> 
                   <p> “I have to say, I’ve been called lazy more times than I can count, but I've never murdered anyone to avoid work," the boy said with nervous humor. "Oska. Come on, drop the knife."</p> 
                   <p>The girl—Oska—stared at Amiri, unmoving. Her chest heaved with labored breaths. Amiri flexed her legs, shifting them a fraction, trying to loosen the earth that held her lower body trapped. </p> 
                   <p>"You're Amiri," Oska said through gritted teeth. "Of the Six Bears."</p> 
                   <p>"I am Amiri," she replied, low and steady. “I have no clan.”</p> 
                   <p>A brother and sister with red-gold hair. That dimple in the girl's chin that made her border on adorable, and that she probably hated. Didn't Amiri remember a pair like that? A girl who crouched and watched Amiri train, a boy always huddled close to the fire or in his sister's shadow? </p> 
                   <p>"Oska," she said, repeating the name, trying to place it. Her eyes flicked to the boy. "And you're Branum, is that right?"</p> 
                   <p>He gave a quick, convulsive nod. Oska and Branum. Their mother was Kina, with the copper hair and sweet voice, dead years before Amiri left. And their father—their father was Maruk. Champion wrestler, champion drinker. He was dead, too.</p> 
                   <p>He died the day Amiri left.</p> 
                   <p>She glanced around, casual as she could, searching for her sword. She spotted it, half-wrapped in Branum’s cloak, well out of reach.</p> 
                   <p> “You killed our father,” Oska said, all bile and hatred. Ready to strike.</p>

                   <p>Amiri had never denied the things she’d done. Not to herself or anyone else. “That’s right,” she said, voice steady. Oska let out a strangled sound of fury and grief and surged forward a step—just one.</p> 
                   <p>Even pinned, Amiri knew she wouldn’t lose that fight. But it wasn’t one she much liked the thought of winning, either.</p> 
                   <p>She pushed herself up on one elbow, glaring at Oska. “I killed your father,” she said. “But whatever I’ve done, girl, your father was my grandmother’s favorite nephew. We’re cousins, you and I. Kin. And that’d make you a kinslayer, just like me."</p> 
                   <p>"Can the kinslayer's kin kill the kinslayer? Or will the kinslayer kill the kinslayer's slain kin's kin?" Branum rattled off. Amiri stared at him. He offered a crooked smile, spread his hands. "Sorry. I can't help it."</p> 
                   <p>Oska snorted. She held still, every muscle tense, for several long seconds. Then, at last, she lowered her dagger. "I'm no kinslayer," she declared, backing away. Amiri let out a breath through her teeth as the tension left her.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri levered herself up higher, still trying to work her legs. The rocks blocking the entrance shifted at her movement, and she froze. There was enough stone blocking the entrance that bringing it down on herself would be very stupid indeed.</p> 
                   <p>"I think we can get you out clean if we move a couple of these rocks and pull you straight out," Branum said, as if following her train of thought.</p> 
                   <p>Oska looked at him askance. "What are you talking about? I'm not helping her."</p> 
                   <p>Branum shrugged. "If you aren't going to kill her, seems like helping her is the other option."</p> 
                   <p>"We could just leave her here."</p> 
                   <p>"She's in the way of the exit," Branum replied. "And I'm not sure we can dig our way out without squishing her, which we've just agreed not to do."</p> 
                   <p>"I wouldn't be killing her, the rocks would be killing her," Oska said sweetly. Amiri glared at her. She glared back.</p> 
                   <p>Had Amiri been this infuriating at this age? Surely not. It had taken at least a little while longer before her clan tried to arrange her death, and surely if she was <em>this</em> annoying they wouldn't have waited.</p> 
                   <p>Oska sighed, surrendering. "Fine. We'll move her out of the way first. Which rocks?"</p> 
                   <p>Branum pointed confidently, and Oska moved without questioning him. Amiri helped as best she could from her awkward angle, obeying Branum's strict instructions not to move her legs at all, lest she disrupt the pile and bring it down on all of them. Well, both of them, since Branum was staying well back for a "better vantage point."</p> 
                   <p>Bit by bit, they eased her out, until finally she was able to clamber to her feet. Her legs were all pins and needles, her feet half-numb, but there was little pain. Nothing broken or too badly bruised, she thought. She'd been lucky. For certain definitions of the word.</p> 
                   <p>"Now, let's get this cleared and get out of here," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>Branum put a palm to the rocks. Frowned. Got that distant look in his eye of people seeing something they had no natural business seeing. Then he shook his head. "No good. There's a solid few feet of stone in the way. Too much for even you ladies to budge."</p> 
                   <p>"What's the alternative? Die gasping down here?" Oska asked.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri stared at the two of them. Youths of the Six Bears clan. <em>Two stray cubs</em>. So this was what the witch had wanted her to find, then. Maruk's children—who didn't have any better sense than he once had, if they were hunting that peryton on their own. Then again, if Maruk had hared off on a hunt like this, she would have been right on his heels. Or sprinting past him, never mind the risk.</p> 
                   <p>"What were you thinking?" she said, and realized as the words left her mouth that she wasn't sure who she was talking to. These cubs? Maruk's ghost? Or maybe she meant herself.</p> 
                   <p>Oska turned on her. "That beast has been driving out anything bigger than a rabbit, and its fledglings eat all the rabbits. As long as it's here, hunting is scarce."v </p>
                   <p>"So go hunt the lowlands," Amiri said dismissively.</p> 
                   <p>Oska's jaw flared. Branum shifted uncomfortably.</p> 
                   <p>"She's not—" Branum started.</p> 
                   <p>"Branum—" Oska warned.</p> 
                   <p>"—supposed to be hunting," he finished. His sister looked ready to throw him in a lake. He was lucky there weren't any nearby. Branum sighed. "We're on our own these days, and the only thing I know how to catch is a cold. But Oska's not meant to be hunting, so we have to go where the others won't see us. With everyone in the lowlands it's harder."</p> 
                   <p>"Why aren't you allowed to hunt?" Amiri asked, baffled.</p> 
                   <p>"You might have noticed we share a gender," Oska said, one hand planted on her hip.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri shrugged. "Never stopped me. Never stopped anyone I knew from taking a hare or a doe when they needed meat."</p> 
                   <p>"Things are different now," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's brow furrowed, but before she could ask what Oska meant, she felt something—the whisper of a breeze against the back of her neck. "There's fresh air coming from somewhere," she said, stalking toward the back of the cave. There, a narrow crack ran from floor to ceiling. Amiri waved Branum closer and borrowed his light, but the retreating shadows only revealed more stone. The passageway turned. No way to say how far it went or how narrow it got.</p> 
                   <p>"That's quite a squeeze," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>"Shouldn't bother you, though," Amiri noted.</p> 
                   <p>"Benefits of being a twig," he agreed, shrugging.</p> 
                   <p>"It's not like we have another option. We'll have to see where it goes," Oska said. "But the kinslayer goes in front."</p> 
                   <p>"Think I'm going to stab you in the back, do you?" Amiri asked, chuckling darkly. "Trust me, if I kill you, you'll know it's coming."</p> 
                   <p>"Is it supposed to be a comfort to imagine that my father knew he was betrayed, the moment before you murdered him?" Oska snapped.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's anger was a lash of fire through her veins. "<em>They</em> were the traitors," she snarled.</p> 
                   <p>Oska's hand wrapped around her dagger's hilt. Her lips skinned back from her teeth. "Liar. Killer. You—"</p> 
                   <p>Branum stepped between them. He put a hand to Oska's shoulder and lifted the other toward Amiri—holding it close to his body, as though he thought she might bite him if he brought it any closer.</p> 
                   <p>"Close quarters make for quick tempers," he said. "We can fight under clear skies. For now, keep focused."</p> 
                   <p>"I've got no quarrel with that," Amiri said. "If your sister keeps her blade pointed elsewhere."</p> 
                   <p>Oska spat at her and wheeled around. She stalked as far away as she could get, which was all of a spear's length, and made a show of checking her gear. Amiri shook her head. "All right. Let me get my sword, and let's get this over with."</p> 
                   <p>"About that," Branum said, and Amiri's heart sank. He bent, lifting aside the fold of his cloak, which had concealed the blade of the massive bastard sword—and hidden where it had broken, snapped to a jagged end halfway down its length.</p> 
                   <p>"What did you do?" Amiri demanded, crossing the distance in two steps and shoving Branum aside.</p> 
                   <p>"We didn't do anything. It broke in the rockslide," Branum said. "Saved your life, though. You were shielding your head with it, didn't get caught by that one." He pointed to a large boulder, wedged inside the entrance. It had taken out a solid chunk of the cave wall on its way in.</p> 
                   <p>"It's just a sword," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>"Why is it that people think that word has so much power?" Amiri asked.</p> 
                   <p>"What word?" Oska asked, puzzled.</p> 
                   <p>"'Just.' It's just a cut. Just a prank. Just an arrow in your belly. Just a dragon. Who needs magic and weapons when you have 'just' to solve all the world's ills?" </p> 
                   <p><em>Just a sword</em>. Except it wasn't. It was everything she'd done to get it, and everything that had happened after. A friend had once pointed out to her it was a bit literal, carrying the weight of her sins on her back. She'd shoved him into a bog for it. It wasn't about the weight. It was about the purpose. Each time she used this blade, it was one more thing she'd done with it that wasn't the <em>first</em> thing.</p> 
                   <p>Her deeds were not a drop of blood in water, to dissolve and vanish. It wasn't about making the past disappear. It was about being <em>more</em> than that one moment.</p> 
                   <p>That's what she told herself, at least.</p> 
                   <p>She wrapped the blade carefully in Branum's cloak, minding its edges, and bound it with twine. Her pack had been lost somewhere in the rockfall, but she made a bundle she could carry one-handed.</p> 
                   <p>She'd get out. Find someone to mend it.</p> 
                   <p>Keep adding to its list of deeds.</p>

                   <h3>James Case</h3> 
                   <p>My howmi (I couldn’t properly pronounce halmeoni when I was a toddler, abbreviations were made) is a great cook, but growing up, she made Korean food very rarely (Too much chopping! Just chop chop chop! Howmi don’t wanna chop so much!). New years was always the big exception, where she’d make enough food to feed everyone for... honestly, several days. We always had to have our tteokguk first to make sure we’d have good luck for the next year, and it was always the right way to start things off. Happy new year!</p> 
                   <h4>Tteokguk of Time Advancement — Item 5</h4> 
                   <p><b>Consumable, Magical, Transmutation, Polymorph</b><br> <b>Usage</b> Held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>Dumplings and rice cakes float invitingly between seaweed and egg in this comforting soup. While normal tteokguk helps you gain an extra year of age when you eat it, the magic in tteokguk of time advancement takes this a step further.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <b>Effect</b> Upon eating the tteokguk, you gain several years of age, morphing into an older version of yourself. Your physical appearance and personality change to those you would have at any age older than your current one. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you're untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn't get a chance to notice that you aren't at your true age. This lasts until morning of the next day, at which point you are temporarily immune until the next lunar new year.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Eleanor Ferron</h3> 
                   <p>Every new year, my dad's side of the family would gather at my grandma and grandpa's house for a large family reunion. There weren't enough rooms or beds for all the cousins, us kids would fight with one another, and of course after a few days we were all sick of being there. But they're some of my fondest memories. On New Year's Day we would make sushi and lotus root, serve kuromame and the horrible lucky fish cake (which I would begrudgingly choke down a single slice of), but my favorite was my grandpa's inarizushi—tangy sushi rice inside sweet fried tofu pockets. I struggled for ages to be able to split open the delicate fried tofu without ripping the pockets open, and was so proud of myself when I got good at it. In Japan, they are said to be favored by the rice goddess Inari and her fox servants. I didn't know anything about the myths associated with them until later; my brother must have told me when he got interested in studying Japanese culture. Grandpa probably would have gotten grumpy if we'd brought it up, but he might not have minded giving one to a hungry fox. He loved nature and animals, and would go out in the morning to garden and feed the flock of California quail who hid in the tiny bamboo thicket on the edge of his yard. They came so often we used to call them his little chickens.</p> 
                   <p>You really shouldn't feed wild animals, but in a fantasy game it's harmless fun.</p> 
                   <h4>Shrine Inarizushi — Level 1</h4> 
                   <p><b>Divination, Consumable, Divine</b><br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> one minute (Interact)<br> A splash of sacred sake in the rice vinegar used to prepare this sushi makes it a suitable offering to the goddess Daikitsu and her favored fox servants. You place the sushi before a shrine of the goddess Daikitsu or in a wilderness area that naturally harbors foxes. For the next hour, whenever you are in exploration mode, roll a separate Search activity check with a +1 status bonus; this does not affect your Speed. If the check succeeds, a fox appears to inform you of this discovery as best as it can, although it cannot speak.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Sen.H.H.S.</h3> 
                   <p>In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, my family and I often visit Songshan Ciyou Temple for our annual prayers to the gods there. Like many other temples here, Ciyou Temple hosts a multitude of Taoist-Buddhist gods under one roof. Other than just for convenience, I think it is also a testimony of variety and complexity within a culture, something I do my best to reflect in my writing.</p> 
                   <p>Last year has been a full-on bumpy ride, but it was consequently highly rewarding. I learned a lot, tried a lot, and flailed a lot in the process. I’m grateful to be a member of the greater Paizo creative community as their support means the world to me. There is a lot to look forward to, and since I can’t talk about many of them right now, follow me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a>) for when those announcements drop!</p> 
                   <p>Wishing everyone a happy Year of the Tiger! *Roar*</p> 
                   <h4>Incense Bundle of Annual Blessings — Item 8</h4> 
                   <p><b>Consumable, Magical</b><br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>The twelve incense sticks wrapped in this bundle vary in shade and color, reflecting the deities the months are named after. Offering all incense sticks to their respective deities within a week is said to bring unparalleled luck, though gaining entry to all the necessary shrines and temples can pose quite a challenge. Those that complete the challenge gain can, when affected by a misfortune effect, automatically disrupt it as the incense wards off the bad luck. This ability can be used once a month for the next 12 months.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Jessie Lo</h3> 
                   <p>Hi I’m Jessie, you can find me on my Pathfinder 2e podcast <a rhef="https://twitter.com/GobletsandGays">@GobletsandGays</a> and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akinomii_art">@akinomii_art</a>. During Chinese New Year, it is very common to give out hongbao, red packets/envelopes, to your loved ones. Usually, they contain money, which is used to wish good luck, health, and wealth for the new year. It's also common to give out red packets as gifts, which often means a red packet is reused by several people until it wears out. It has also become common to get red packets from malls, which usually have a piece of chocolate, candy or special coupons.</p> 
                   <h4>Hongbao of Many Things — Item 5</h4>

                   <p>This enchanted long, red envelope is decorated with beautiful illustrations in gold ink. The hongbao holds twelve slips safely within.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <b>Effect</b> You draw a randomly selected slip from the hongbao, which transforms permanently into a useful item. Until you draw another item, the illustration on the outside of the hongbao changes to one of twelve animals, matching the item pulled. Each slip can be drawn only once; after the last slip is gone, the hongbao becomes a non-magical red envelope that retains the illustration of the final slip drawn. The effects of each slip are as follows:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>3d4 small firecracker pellets that let out a loud squeak when thrown against a hard surface. </li>
                    <li>Embroidered leather armor made from oxhide.</li> 
                    <li>A <em>lesser healing potion</em>, except it is applied as a balm instead of drunk.</li> 
                    <li>A stuffed bunny dressed in red robes.</li> 
                    <li>50 feet of coiled silk rope.</li>

                    <li>A wooden, horse-drawn wagon.</li> 
                    <li>A musical instrument made out of a ram’s horn.</li> 
                    <li>A collapsible metal-banded bo staff.</li> 
                    <li>An ornate jeweled egg.</li> 
                    <li>A small, jade, statuette of a guardian lion dog.</li>

                   <h3>Tan Shao Han</h3> 
                   <p>Happy Lunar New Year! May you all enjoy roaring good fortune in the year of the tiger! Based in Singapore, Shao Han (<a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/">https://www.curiouschimeras.com/</a>) is a member of the #RPGSEA movement who has created content for various RPGs, including Pathfinder 2, Blades in the Dark, and ARC. Fun fact: Due to Shao Han being taller than most of his family, he enjoys a +1 to his Cooking Lore checks when eating yusheng, and adds the reach trait and gains the critical specialization effects on his chopsticks attacks.</p> 
                   <h4>Seven-Color Raw Fish Salad — Item 8</h4> 
                   <p><b>Consumable, Divination, Fortune, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 88 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> Prepared with 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> 1</p> 
                   <p>An appetizer popularized in Goka, seven-color raw fish salad (qicai yusheng) is both fun and tasty to eat. This large platter of salad of raw fish, seafood, fruits, and vegetables of various hues is dressed in generous drizzlings of crushed peanuts, plum sauce, and sesame oil. During the Lunar New Year, consuming the seven-color raw fish salad (as 'seven colors' sounds similar to 'seven riches') is a grand, often messy, affair of spectacle and skill. Diners gather around the platter with long chopsticks to toss the salad, lifting the assorted ingredients as high as possible without dropping them off the table; erudite diners lead the table in uttering auspicious sayings to wish good fortune for the new year.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> 1 minute (command, Interact); <b>Effect</b> You toss the ingredients of the seven-color raw fish salad into the air to prepare the dish. You must attempt a DC 20 Cooking Lore check, with the following results.</p> 
                   <p><b>Critical Success</b> You manage to toss the ingredients deftly without wasting food, and your enthusiastic recitation of auspicious sayings is well received—a sign of impending good fortune! For the first month of the coming year, you enjoy a +2 bonus to skill checks to Earn Income and Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information about job opportunities.</p> 
                   <p><b>Success</b> You toss the ingredients adroitly, wasting a minimum of seafood, and your delivery of auspicious sayings is respectable. For the first month of the coming year, you gain a +1 bonus to skill checks to Earn Income and Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information about job opportunities.</p> 
                   <p><b>Failure</b> You fumble too many of the ingredients to have enough left to eat.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Paizo and Gale Force Nine have agreed on a multi-game partnership to publish original Pathfinder and Starfinder board games.</p> 
                   <p>Gale Force Nine (GF9), known for producing games such as “Firefly: The Game” and “Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy”, have teamed up with Paizo to publish original board and card games drawing from the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder. The multi-year partnership will see GF9 exploring the rich settings of Golarion, the Pact Worlds, and beyond to bring the heroes, villains, locations, and monsters from the roleplaying systems into several new boardgames. </p> 
                   <p>Starting in Q2 2022, Gale Force Nine will release two board games and one card game over the first year of the partnership, with more following over the course of the relationship. The first three titles are:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><em>Pathfinder: Level 20</em> (Q2 2022)</li> 
                    <li><em>Starfinder: Pirates of Skydock</em> (Q3 2022)</li> 
                    <li><em>Pathfinder: Tall Tales</em> (Q4 2022)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>“The worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder are fun, diverse, and full of character,” says John-Paul Brisigotti, CEO of GF9. “We are excited to explore them further and offer fans of these games an opportunity to interact with the worlds in a new way.” </p> 
                   <p>We look forward to partnering with Gale Force Nine in bringing the Pathfinder and Starfinder worlds to life as board games,” says Paizo President, Jeff Alvarez. </p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder: Level 20</h3> 
                   <p>The first game of this partnership, releasing in Q2 2022, is <em>Pathfinder: Level 20</em>, a game where players take on the role of kobolds in their warren, scampering away from a 19th-level fighter who only needs five XP to hit level 20.</p> 
                   <p>Will you make the heroes scamper away in embarrassment, thus being crowned the kobold champion? Or will you be the last survivor among your friends, a victory in its own right!</p> 
                   <p>Pathfinder: Level 20 is a game for 2–6 players and will be available in April with an MSRP of $30. Visit <a href="http://www.gf9games.com/pathfinder">www.gf9games.com/pathfinder</a> for more information.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello, Pathfinders! With the release of two more Year 3 metaplot scenarios yesterday, the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries is in full swing. This blog introduces the concept of the “metaplot” for those who may not be familiar. I’ll also be providing a rundown of the Year 3 metaplot stories so you have all the information in one place. Let’s get to it!</p> 
                   <p>Each year of Pathfinder Society adventures includes “metaplot scenarios,” which tell a linked story. You can think of the metaplot like the “main plot” of a TV series. There are non-metaplot scenarios as well, which typically have fewer connections to the major plot events.</p> 
                   <h3>Year 3 Metaplot</h3> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ce22669-6db3-4db3-861e-454d71b30330/YearofShatteredSanctuaries_Title.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ce22669-6db3-4db3-861e-454d71b30330/YearofShatteredSanctuaries_Title.png" width="50%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Year of Shattered Sanctuaries"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <p>The Year 3 metaplot includes 14 adventures. One of the challenges of creating a metaplot is that many players will play the adventures in a different order, sometimes based on which characters they have at different levels, or which adventures are being offered at their preferred venues. Asking everyone to play 14 adventures in the same order wouldn’t work too well! So, we broke Year 3 up into six “metaplot arcs.” Each arc tells a small part of the overall Year 3 story. You can play some of the arcs, or all of them, as you like. Each arc tells a contained story which fits into a broader narrative. In the case of Year 3, each of these arcs tells the story of a strange disaster befalling a Pathfinder Society lodge in one of six nations in the Inner Sea: Absalom, Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira, and Taldor.</p> 
                   <p>Within the Year 3 metaplot, you can think of the Absalom storyline as the “A plot,” and the other storylines as side plots. The Absalom arc contains both the introduction and conclusion of the metaplot as a whole.</p>

                   <h3>Enjoy the arcs in any order!</h3> 
                   <p>You can play these metaplot arcs in any order. For example, you could start with the Qadira arc (the first scenario came out yesterday!) and then go back to the Andoran arc, the Cheliax arc, or even the intro scenario. This means there are several possible entry points into the Year 3 story. Every single scenario in the metaplot is playable with our Pathfinder Society pregenerated characters (available at levels 1, 3, and 5), with one exception: the final scenario in the Absalom arc is level 7–10, so you’ll need your own character in that level range if you’re playing for Pathfinder Society credit.</p> 
                   <h3>Final Recommendations</h3> 
                   <p>Though you can play the arcs in any order (Qadira before Andoran, or the other way around), when you’re looking at the individual adventures within a given arc, I recommend that you play them in the order they were released. The above list shows the intended order within each arc. There is no “rule” which requires you to play Part 1 before Part 2, but the story within each arc is going to make more sense if you do.</p> 
                   <p>There is no “right” or “wrong” approach to the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. Pick an arc, or any scenario that sounds fun, and dive into the story!</p> 
                   <p>As always, please keep your hands and arms inside the sanctuaries while you explore, report, and cooperate your way through Year 3!</p>

                   <p>I’ve had the good fortune to write a lot for Pathfinder and helped to invent a fair portion of its deities, but always in the context of the fantasy genre. The chance to revisit some of these elements in a different genre is exciting and liberating. after spending decades with deities like Desna and Sarenrae flitting around in my head as divinities first in my homebrew game and then more recently in Golarion. Alas, there was only so much room to talk about Desnan dream stations or to explore the implications of what worshiping the goddess of the sun might entail when you’re in outer space, but hopefully the entries in this book will help spark new ideas for how to use these deities in your game! And of course, on the opposite side of the “friendliness scale,” being able to lean into the science-fiction tropes of the classic pulps and explore how Nyarlathotep and the Elder Mythos functions in Starfinder was equally delightful. But the thing I’m most excited to see once this book’s out is all the amazing content created by all the other authors in this book!</p>

                   <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">Starfinder Society Developer</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer. I’m also a mother, gamer, blogger, and freelance author who primarily writes for Paizo’s Starfinder and Pathfinder RPGs. You can find a list of my currently announced writing credits on my Paizo profile (meloriel). Some recently released highlights include <em>Secrets of Magic, Guns &amp; Gears, Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, Galaxy Exploration Manual,</em> and <em>Tech Revolution</em>.</p> 
                   <p>For <em>Galactic Magic</em>, I wrote the mystic and witchwarper class options, twenty spells, and numerous deities, including Kadrical, Lamashtu, and all the ancestral deities. <em>Galactic Magic</em> also marks two big firsts for me. This is the first time I was hired to create entirely new deities of my own design (Dagosarn, Flux, Isvith, Jalvari, Meyel, Romgul, Uvonn, and the Vesk Saints). <em>Galactic Magic</em> is also the first time I was hired for freelance development work, making this my very first developer credit.</p> 
                   <p>I’m beyond thrilled to have been a part of this book and I look forward to seeing it hit gaming tables! Enjoy!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them or xe/xem)</h3> 
                   <p>I'm a sometimes-poet, sometimes-game designer doing my best to make engaging, inclusive tabletop games. In <em>Galactic Magic</em>, you'll find my work in the technomancer and Oras section. When I was writing the Oras section, I thought quite a bit about Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" and the way in which cyborgs offer a rejection of the separations between animal, human and machine. This should probably tell you that I'm a queer theory nerd (which is the crux of my academic background) and that I love thinking about alternative ways of being through TTRPGs. While <em>Galactic Magic</em> is my first hardcover with Paizo, you'll find my name on more books soon and can enjoy more of my Starfinder work with <em>SFS #3-07: Strike at Zone 78</em> and <em>SFS #4-04: Mission Not Found</em>.</p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I’ve been freelancing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for about six years. You might remember me from this year’s Starfinder GenCon special, <em>#3-99: Perils of the Past</em>. I’m delighted to have been a part of <em>Galactic Magic</em>, helping give the “fantasy” side of “science-fantasy” some love. I did several sections for the book, including the faith introduction, the Besmara and Weydan entries, the Parallel Truths, and the new operative class options. I’ve always been fond of exploring how magic and faith interact with a highly technologically advanced setting, so this assignment was a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed crafting the operative options, which hopefully add a little magical flair to your operative of choice!</p> 
                   <p>I’ve got a few more Pathfinder and Starfinder projects in the works currently, though most of them are still Forbidden Knowledge at this point. I can confirm, though, that I got my grabby hands involved in Pathfinder’s upcoming <em>Book of the Dead</em>! In my non-freelancing downtime, I can be found hanging out with a book or video game—usually Animal Crossing these days—or pretending I know how to bake. You can find a full list of my writing credits at klspeedling.com and I’m on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a>, where I sporadically post cat pictures.</p>

                   <h3>Sen.H.H.S. (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, readers! Sen.H.H.S. here. You might have seen my name before in some Pathfinder Second Edition products such as <em>Bestiary 3, Secrets of Magic</em>, and many others. (See my carrd for the full list: <a href="https://senhhs.carrd.co/#portfolio">https://senhhs.carrd.co/#portfolio</a>) With <em>Galactic Magic</em>, it looks like I've made the jump over to write even more magic in a different(?) universe. This book has been a long time coming, and I hope you'll get to experience the magic (pun intended) within its pages soon. You can always find out what I'm up to on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a>. If my calculations are correct, you might get to witness me tweeting about "trace analysis in Golarion" in the next little while, for every reason whatsoever.</p>

                   <h3>Shay Snow (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow, I'm an editor at Paizo, and I wrote up a bunch of species-specific spells and the entry on Zon-Kuthon, surprising exactly... no one! As my mutuals on Twitter know I'm a pretty big Zon-Kuthon fan so I joyfully jumped when offered the chance to give the pain man a new write up for <em>Galactic Magic</em>. You may have seen me in a few Starfinder scenarios, Pathfinder’s <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Tech Revolution</em> and I have a few things coming out in <em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth.</em> Additionally, you can find my name on a few <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em> projects!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SpellsInSugar">@SpellsInSuga</a>r, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You can keep up with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href="https://shayjay.carrd.co/">https://shayjay.carrd.co/</a>! <br> </p>
                   <h3>Jessica Redekop (she/they/he)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi! I'm Jess, and I wrote about some fabulous outsider deities in <em>Galactic Magic</em> ! Even though it's a smaller section, I'm particularly proud of my work in this book. It gave me an opportunity to introduce a lot of cool content into Starfinder, and there are some lines scattered through the section that are quite personal to me. I won't spoil which gods are included, but if you're familiar with my past work for PF and SF, some of them are very "me." :) I hope you like Starfinder's new and returning outsider deities as much as I do!</p> 
                   <p>For more of my content check out Valiant, an actual play Pathfinder podcast on the Know Direction network, where I play Xiadani the aasimar druid. You can also find me <a href="https://twitter.com/tectonomancer">@tectonomancer</a> on Twitter.</p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>дравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may recognize me from previous Starfinder products such as the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (where I wrote about Accord and created the Starship Toolbox) and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #31: Waking the Worldseed</em> (where I wrote the Hibb article), along with plenty of Pathfinder stuff. In my more mundane life, I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p> 
                   <p><em>Galactic Magic</em> was a bit of a weird project for me. John Compton contacted me and said ‘we need magical nanomachines and we need them as soon as humanly possible.’ Well, I’m never one to shirk from a challenge, and produced the magical options for the nanocyte in basically a weekend. I’m reasonably pleased with the results, especially the ability to make fancy nano-runes and sigils like a proper anime protagonist. (That was what John wanted, right?)</p> 
                   <p>Nanites are also of some interest to me for other reasons, as when not writing for Paizo, I’m working on <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> alongside the inimitable Andrew Mullen and Isabelle Thorne (follow us at https://twitter.com/LuminantA). I shan’t share too much in the way of details, but let’s just say that fans of microscopic shenanigans may find our upcoming release, <em>Armaments of the Luminant Age</em>, of some interest to them.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone! My name is John Godek and I am an avid Starfinder GM, player, freelance author, and podcaster. I had the opportunity to write several sections of <em>Galactic Magic</em> and I can’t wait for you to see them! I created two brand new soldier fighting styles—the spellbrawler and the archer—along with new weapons, gear boosts, fusions, and armor upgrades that synergize with these styles as well as offer cool options for other styles and classes. In addition, I formulated nearly three dozen new magic spells, including spells that provide basic utility, create different types of barriers, and are related to or originated in the Vast. Finally, I crafted three new legendary artifacts of tremendous power, each steeped in ancient lore. Other Paizo projects I have forthcoming include work on the Drift Crisis hardcover, backmatter in <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #44</em>, and my very first adventure—<em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em>!</p> 
                   <p>You can find me playing with the Emerald City Lodge in Seattle, or you can listen to my podcasts on the Know Direction Network, including: Digital Divination with Ron Lundeen, Intrepid Heroes, a Stafinder actual play, and Presenting, a podcast where I interview game designers, developers, artists, and writers.</p>

                   <p>Evening, everyone. I’m Nate Wright, a blogger on the Know Direction Network and a freelancer who has contributed to multiple works from Paizo. Some of my favorites include the anadi ancestry from <em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em> and the memetic zenith from <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #24: The God-Host Ascends</em>. The best part about writing for this book has been visualizing the awesome abilities I’ve always wished my character could have and getting the opportunity to share that vision with the rest of the community.</p>

                   <p>Hi folks! My name is Dennis Muldoon, and I've been freelancing for Paizo for a few years now. I've contributed to almost every line Paizo publishes, now, most recently <em>SFS #4-10: The Way In</em>, the Azlanti Space Age material in the toolbox of <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #42: Whispers of the Eclipse</em>, and the ssumzili and golgopo monsters in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #171: Hurricane's Howl</em>. For Galactic Magic, I wrote the experimental apparatus mechanic alternate class feature for all your magically inclined mechanic needs, along with magic-themed mechanic tricks for mechanics of all types. I'm also extremely excited to bring the Lucky Drunk himself into Starfinder with a section on Cayden Cailean! My full list of credits is on my Paizo profile, and you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dkmuldoon">@dkmuldoon</a>.</p>

                   <p>Hey, Starfinder fans! I’m Kate, and I’ve been writing for Starfinder and Pathfinder for about five years. I was delighted to get to write the sections on Hylax and Talavet for this book. Hylax is near and dear to my heart after writing one of the Attack of the Swarm volumes, and I even have a tattoo of the <em>Crown of Hylax</em>! Talavet speaks to me equally, with such a strong focus on the importance of stories, something I’ve never appreciated more than in the last year and a half. I hope you enjoy reading about their role in the galaxy, along with the many other deities featured in this book.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>THE WIND BENEATH THE PEAKS</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">The sky was scabbed over with ominous looking clouds, but Amiri refused to take them as an ill omen. Just being back here in these mountains was all the bad luck she needed.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri hadn’t yet decided just how much of a fool she was for coming back to the lands of her birth. Just on the other side of these peaks lay the place where she’d stood drenched in the blood of her kin: the finest warriors of the Six Bears. Men she had called her brothers. Her friends. She had felt the heat of their blood fading from her skin and known she could never go home again.</p> 
                   <p>She’d told herself she never wanted to.</p> 
                   <p>And in the time since, she never had. Until now. Following a witch-woman’s words of warning and promise. Because though in all that time she’d never wanted to return these lands had never fully loosed their hold on her.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri gritted her teeth as she hauled herself over the sheer flank of a boulder. From here she could see down the slope toward the overgrown valley below and peer up toward the snow-crusted peaks. Not a single crow cawed. No mice scuttled among the rocks and scree.</p> 
                   <p>More bad omens, maybe. Or they’d been scared off by a lumbering warrior who’d forgotten the way of navigating easily through this landscape, she thought, and spat.</p> 
                   <p>“Told you it was a bad idea.” she muttered, though there was no one else to hear. She’d told herself it was a bad idea just about every step of the way, but she couldn’t get the witch-woman’s words out of her head.</p> 
                   <p>The town was nothing special. Just a cluster of unremarkable houses, preyed on by unremarkable bandits who were foolish enough to mistake Amiri for an easy target. She hadn’t even known the town was there until the residents greeted her cheering, at the gates. They’d insisted on a feast, and who was Amiri to turn down free food?</p> 
                   <p>The witch-woman’s gift had been less welcome.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t have any gold to offer, but I have a fortune,” she'd said.</p> 
                   <p>“Knowing the future only ever causes trouble.” Amiri replied with a grunt, starting to turn away, but the woman had held on with a surprisingly firm grip.</p> 
                   <p>“You hear the whispers. The wind among the peaks. When you wake, when you sleep. You hear their voices. The men you killed. You hear them mocking you. You hear them cursing you.”</p> 
                   <p>“Leave me be.” Amiri had growled, but the woman was relentless.</p> 
                   <p>“I see you returning to the land of your birth. I see two stray cubs, a broken blade. I see your heart torn from your chest,” the woman intoned.</p> 
                   <p>“My heart torn from my chest?” Amiri echoed, skeptical. “Doesn’t sound like something I ought to go looking for.”</p> 
                   <p>The old woman shrugged. “Could be a metaphor. Can’t always tell with these things. But I hear the splintering of bones.” The smoke from the cookfire twined around them, strangely thick.</p> 
                   <p>“You’re telling me if I go back there... what? I find some kind of peace?” Amiri had asked, voice sharp with scorn. She was a creature of battle and bloodshed, not peace.</p> 
                   <p>Though maybe sometimes she did hear the wind howling in the peaks. Maybe sometimes she even thought she imagined voices in that wind, and felt—what? Not guilt or regret, exactly.</p> 
                   <p>More the sense of something unfinished.</p> 
                   <p>“Peace? No. A kind of silence, maybe.” the witch said.</p> 
                   <p>That night Amiri dreamed of howling wind and when she set out in the morning, her path bent northward.</p> 
                   <p>Part of her had almost expected spirits of vengeance to come screaming out of the sky the moment she entered the Six Bears’ territory but so far, her journey had been uneventful. She was skirting the edge of it now, just at the border of her old clan’s hunting grounds. If everything was as barren as this, it must have been a lean winter.</p> 
                   <p>A skittering of rock drew her attention up the slope. She almost missed it—a flash of gray against gray, something ducking behind a stone. Then came a tiny yip and a growl. She wasn’t entirely alone here, then.</p> 
                   <p><em>Two stray cubs</em>, she thought.</p> 
                   <p>“Bad idea.” She reminded herself. But, shaking her head, she started up the slope. The footing was unstable and twice she slid back down a foot or two, almost losing her grip on the mountainside. But finally, she hauled herself up to where the small form had vanished. There was a cleft in the rock—a cave, too small for a human, but large enough for an animal’s den, perhaps. Amiri crouched, peering into the darkness.</p> 
                   <p>In her experience, fortune telling and prophecy were infuriatingly vague or uselessly symbolic. Irony and prophecy were for bards as far as she was concerned. Just tell her what a thing was plainly—and how to kill it. So she wasn’t really expecting to find two stray cubs in this den. That would be too easy. Too <em>literal</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri took a strip of jerky from her pack and held it out. “Come on. Be simple for once,” she muttered, and tossed it on the ground just outside the den.</p> 
                   <p>Two glowing eyes appeared in the darkness. A second set blinked just behind. Wolves’ eyes, Amiri thought, and for one bright moment let herself believe that she might find her “stray cubs” and be done with this whole business.</p> 
                   <p>The nearer beast sprang forward. Amiri leapt back with a wordless sound of surprise. She’d been mistaken—that hadn’t been the click of claws she heard, but of hooves and talons.</p> 
                   <p>The cub was a hideously proportioned thing—a fawn’s spindly front legs, an oversized wolf cub’s head, the nubs of antlers pushing up from its blunt and blood-speckled brow. Ragged wings, pinfeathers not yet grown in, sprouted from its back, and its hind end sported the wicked talons of a bird of prey at the end of each scaly foot.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton cub snarled at her, hunching over the piece of jerky. The second cub scrambled out, diving for the meat, and the two snapped and tore at each other, their antics almost sending them rolling down the side of the mountain.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri grimaced, putting a hand to the dagger at her belt. The beasts were the size of small dogs now—not much of a threat. But they’d grow fast, and perytons were vicious, evil things. Fully grown, they delighted in tearing the hearts from men’s chests. Just like the witch had seen.</p> 
                   <p>Was this all the witch wanted from her? Come here, kill a couple of perytons before they could grow up and threaten the Six Bears? Penance for her crimes.</p> 
                   <p>As if that would wipe away the past.</p> 
                   <p>She drew the dagger. The witch said find the cubs. She’d found them. She’d put them down and leave and forget she was ever foolish enough to listen to an old woman’s rambling fortunes.</p> 
                   <p>The cubs seemed to notice her at last. They looked up, their muzzles and faces plastered with blood. No wonder the slopes were so quiet. Even fledglings would go after anything with a heart they could pry from its chest. The two growled at her, advancing. Utterly fearless. Like they completely believed the combined fifty pounds of them could take out a full-grown warrior.</p> 
                   <p>Wind stirred Amiri’s hair.</p> 
                   <p>Or maybe they were fearless for another reason.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri threw herself to the side the second before a massive beast slammed into the rock where she’d been standing. It whirled in a storm of fur and feathers and flashing claws, a howl of rage in its throat.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>She let out an oath. The thing was <em>massive</em>, bigger than any peryton she'd seen—or heard of. Its ragged gray fur was striped with scars and liberally stained with blood. Bits of dried gore hung like macabre ornaments from its broad antlers, and when it spread its wings, they blocked out the sky, casting Amiri in shadow.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri grinned. This was more like it. She sheathed her dagger. Planted her feet. And gripped the hilt of her massive sword. Its weight strained her shoulders, pulled at her arms. But she could feel the familiar, welcome heat uncoiling through her veins. That bitter taste was on her tongue and her heart raced with that mix of danger and eagerness and fury—fury that this creature would dare to face her. Fury it would think it could stand against her strength and blade. That it would think her <em>prey</em>.</p> 
                   <p>“Come on, then!” she screamed at the beast. It rose on its hind legs, beating its great wings and sending blasts of wind that tore the loose rocks and pebbles from the hillside, sending them tumbling.</p> 
                   <p>An arrow hissed through the air. It struck the peryton’s flank with a dull, meaty thud. It howled in rage and pain, its attention twisting away from Amiri. Toward the young woman standing a hundred feet away, feet braced, setting another arrow to her quiver. A young man crouched next to her. They wore hunters’ leathers, and by the matching red-gold shade of their hair and their angular features, they looked to be brother and sister.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton leapt for the young woman. Amiri screamed out a curse and threw herself after. The girl loosed another arrow, but the peryton’s leap had startled her, and it went wide.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri knew she wouldn’t make it to the pair in time. Knew the girl’s hands, quick and sure as they were, weren’t quick enough to nock another arrow. Nothing would stop the creature’s murderous dive. Unless—</p> 
                   <p>The man lifted his hands. The air seemed to bend and fold in front of his palms and a crack like thunder boomed out. The peryton’s charge broke. It slewed away in the air, snarling in pain and shock. The edge of the blast of sound tore past Amiri, slamming into her shoulder, leaving her ears ringing.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton climbed into the air with powerful beats of its wings. Amiri leapt the last few feet to the rock where the two youths stood.</p> 
                   <p>“It’s coming back around,” she warned.</p> 
                   <p>“I can see that.” the young woman snapped, her gaze tracking the beast as it rose, as it turned.</p> 
                   <p>It seemed to hesitate. Its gaze shifted away from the trio, tracking higher up the mountain slope.</p> 
                   <p>Then Amiri heard it. Not the scrape and skitter of a few dislodged stones, but a deep, desultory rumbling. She looked up just as, high above, the mountainside gave way.</p> 
                   <p>“Rockslide!” the young man cried. The peryton let out a warbling howl and dove, but not at the three of them this time—toward its cubs, their half-feathered wings useless to take them out of the path of the rapidly growing avalanche of stone. It swept them up in its hind talons and angled away in seconds as Amiri and the other two sprinted down the slope.</p> 
                   <p>“Don’t suppose that magic of yours can stop a rockslide?” Amiri shouted over the growing din.</p> 
                   <p>“Just start them, apparently.” he tossed back with a reckless grin, and Amiri couldn’t help but answer it.</p> 
                   <p>Over his shoulder she spotted it: a blot of darkness—a cave entrance.</p> 
                   <p>“There.” she said, pointing. The two didn’t need her to explain. The sister got there first but she stopped, waited as her brother reached her and dove past before she flitted in after him.</p> 
                   <p>The dust cloud riding the front edge of the avalanche swept over Amiri, blotting out her vision and swallowing the light. She threw herself toward the cave opening just as the rockslide hit.</p> 
                   <p>There was no light, only darkness and furious sound, as if the whole mountain was coming apart overhead. Amiri scrambled back from the entrance. Stones rained down. Above her sounded a horrible grinding and groaning—then a crack. The cave entrance was giving way. Amiri roared, bracing herself beneath her sword, as if she could hold the whole mountain up.</p> 
                   <p>The roof of the cave collapsed over her.</p>

                   <h4>CHAPTER 1: CLASSES</h4> 
                   <p>PRECOG<br> Through some cosmic event, you have come to understand the ebb and flow of time to a degree that only a select few can. You manipulate time dexterously—accelerating, slowing, or even reshaping chronologies to suit your needs. The skeins of time are yours to see, and you know how to apply enough pressure to adjust their threads ever so subtly. Your ability to understand the infinite possibilities of time also shaped you into someone capable of altering the material universe through powerful spellcasting, and you can harness temporal paradoxes to foresee the future—and dictate the present—in powerful ways. </p> 
                   <p>And new options for every class!</p>

                   <h4>CHAPTER 2: GEAR </h4> 
                   <p>HYBRID ITEMS <br> Blends of magic and technology achieve results that neither alone could ever imagine, creating the likes of null-space storage, miniaturized vehicles, subwoofers able to inspire supernatural fear, artificial lifeforms that require virtually no sustenance, and more. These devices often resist strictly antimagical or anti-technological countermeasures.</p> 
                   <p>MAGIC ITEMS<br> Traditional magic items translate mystical energies into a portable format that nearly anyone can use. Part of the appeal comes from unshakable nostalgia, yet far more often it’s magic items’ total disregard for scientific principles—their ability to translate their maker’s will into reality—that makes them so unique and valuable. </p> 
                   <p>WEAPON FUSIONS AND ARMOR UPGRADES<br> Survival often means eking out maximum performance from an adventurer’s gear, and a magical upgrade provides an easy edge. These weapon fusions and armor upgrades concentrate eldritch energy into functional, long-lasting forms, and these latest models lend even the most technologically outfitted explorer an arcane advantage.</p> 
                   <p>ARTIFACTS<br> Artifacts are exceedingly rare—often unique—items beyond the ability of any but the most accomplished artisans to create, and they’re almost as difficult to destroy. These legendary items combine tremendous power with the intrinsic lore that shapes their abilities. Adventurers might dedicate their entire lives to finding a specific artifact, and recovering an artifact might spur countless high-stakes exploits.</p>

Although deities almost never intervene directly in mortal affairs, their influence is very present in lay worshippers and devoted priests alike.

                   <h4>CHAPTER 5: THE MAGICAL GALAXY </h4> 
                   <p>OVERVIEW<br> Magic can be measured, manipulated, and predicted, or else it never could’ve been integrated with technology. Even so, cultures perceive magic in wildly different ways, and a lot of magical phenomena remains associated with myth, antiquity, physical impossibilities, and secrets perhaps better left alone. In short, despite being integrated into everyday society, magic remains... magical</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1-4.</p> 
                   <p>Following their recent successes in aiding the government of Qadira with apprehending an errant genie-binder, the Pathfinder Society earned the right to establish a new lodge in the port city of Sedeq! With the construction of the site complete, the Society sent a group to formally begin operations from the new edifice.</p> 
                   <p>They never arrived.</p> 
                   <p>With city officials threatening to auction off the new building should the Pathfinder Society neglect to occupy it, the Society sends another group of Pathfinders to investigate the lodge. Finding the brand new structure in a state of alarming disrepair, the Pathfinders have little time to search for answers before a booming voice greets them. If they wish to occupy the lodge, they’ll have to complete three tasks... </p> 
                   <p>“Foundation’s Price” is part of the ongoing story of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It’s the first scenario in a two-part arc detailing the events befalling a Pathfinder Society lodge in the nation of Qadira. Other arcs explore other locations across the Inner Sea. While these arcs can be played in any order, it’s recommended that players experience the scenarios within each individual arc in order.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society has had a tenuous relationship with the government of the ancient nation of Osirion ever since the Ruby Prince increased restrictions on the activities of foreign-based explorers. Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir has worked hard to restore the Society’s reputation in the nation, and to guide the Sandswept Hall, the Pathfinder lodge in Osirion’s capital, away from its dark past.</p> 
                   <p>Recently, hordes of undead have been surging up from the depths of the Sandswept Hall. Norden Balentiir fears that should this threat become widely known, it would compel the Ruby Prince to permanently shut down Pathfinder operations in Osirion. The lodge’s forces are locked in constant battle with the undead, and they need an experienced strike team to descend into the Hall’s lower levels and find the source of the undead menace!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">I remember the years of struggle. Long, stretching seasons where sunlight was sparse, and the hungry night arrived all too quickly. I remember the rites and songs as we laid follower after follower to rest, forced to move ever onward. Parent and child, animals, friends: none were safe as we carved our new paths and founded our new lives.</p> 
                   <p>Tonight, in the shadow of these great mountains, I share with you a story from another time. In this time, your grandparents were small, squalling babes—some of whom I sang lullabies to, heh!—and instead of a seer’s sharp mind, I had the strength and skill of a hunter.</p> 
                   <p>I was a young man back then, instead of Grandfather Eiwa. Oh yes, and I was a skilled archer! With the silence of a great cat I stalked prey. With the sharpness of eye to rival a falcon’s, I watched over our following. With the patience of a mammoth, I knew when to lay still and when to strike with all the strength I had. </p> 
                   <p>What I did not know was <em>when</em> to use each. Sometimes, a well-meaning action creates more trouble than anything.</p> 
                   <p>Take this journey with me, and see things as they were. The time of the year was close to the very season we enjoy now, when daylight just begins to stretch further than the darkness, and the snow finally begins to melt. Around our feet, the trails grew slushy and difficult to traverse, but the days began to grow brighter, and with them came hope. </p> 
                   <p>These were my favorite times of the year. The crispness of the blue sky was a welcome friend. Have you noticed that the sky never seems so bright, so vivid, as during the melts? Perhaps these days I am more comfortable in the warmer seasons, but I will always love the newness of the daylight, reborn and glorious, as it chases the hard winter away.</p> 
                   <p>During this time, we were only a few years into establishing the routes we now use every year. Both our herd and our numbers were still small; we had only recently started recruiting others into our following and teaching them the ways of the Broken Tusk. I was a young man, perhaps only a little older than some of you are now. Still an adult in the eyes of the following, but young enough to be over-eager to prove myself. </p> 
                   <p>My day’s task was to scout ahead. I was to learn which creatures had awakened from slumber, which patches of grass had revealed themselves from beneath the snow, and to ensure the herd’s next resting spot would be free of predators and other dangers.</p> 
                   <p>I took no partner with me save for Isul, my beloved friend, my air-rider. Such a magnificent falcon. He, too, was eager to explore the way ahead, and so I encouraged him to go. It was exhilarating to be exploring by myself, knowing Isul was not too far away. </p> 
                   <p>Stepping carefully along the sprouting grasses and dotted pools of melted snow, I came upon a spot that led to a shallow riverbed. I was stirred by its beauty and felt a swell of pride; this would be a fantastic resting spot for the herd. </p> 
                   <p>In my excitement, I did not pay close enough attention. For by the time I had approached, too late did I see the giant creature already exploring the waters.</p> 
                   <p>I froze in place, watching and waiting. Hoping the massive bear would be more interested in the potential fishing spot than in me. For now, it seemed oblivious to my presence. </p> 
                   <p>I should have let it be and reported back to the others. But a thought crossed my mind: how fantastic would it be, not just to return to the following with news of this beautiful resting site, but to crown that achievement with another: a grizzled bear already brought down to feed our people?</p> 
                   <p>I see some of you already shaking your heads at the thought. And you are right to do so. Well you know by now that you should never hunt bear by yourself. </p> 
                   <p>Only, I was convinced I was not alone. I could call for Isul, and together we could handle anything. And the longer I thought about it, the more I persuaded myself it was the best choice. Food was in short supply, after all, and the great creature could provide much. </p> 
                   <p>I crouched low in the muddy bank and began readying my bow. But when I looked up, I was not ready to see the great beast charging me! </p> 
                   <p>It had seen me; my presence startled it, and I suddenly understood how alone I really was. In the space of a few seconds, many thoughts ran through my mind: <em>where is Isul? I cannot outrun the bear. I don’t have time to make more than one shot. I should have waited. Ancestors, let me live through this and I shall not make this mistake again!</em></p> 
                   <p>The brown bear bounded toward me, then stopped short with a mighty thump of its front paws. It growled at me, teeth clacking. I began backing away from it slowly, hoping this was the only charge the creature would make.</p> 
                   <p>It was not. It surged forward again with similar body language, only this time it connected, knocking me back into the mud. Panic surging, I knew my greatest chance of living right now was to feign death. I rolled instantly to my stomach and cradled my head and neck with my arms. Already my hip was stinging from where the bear had made contact, but at least my instinct was correct. With a mighty thump that shook the mud, he stomped once more, but not on me.</p> 
                   <p>I could not see him, but in my mind’s eye, he was only a few scant feet away. <em>Let him be content, I prayed. Let him go away…</em></p> 
                   <p>He was not content. He did not go away. </p> 
                   <p>I felt the air leave my lungs as his snout dug under my side, trying to flip me over. Every last bit of me wanted to yelp, to flee. <em>No, do not flee, for you will make him chase you!</em> It took all my strength to keep my stomach to the ground, keep my arms shielding my head and neck.</p> 
                   <p>He must have been as frustrated as I, for the next thing I knew, I felt his snout at my hip again, strong claws burning into my leg. I felt a moment of weightlessness, soon followed by flattening, encompassing pain along the front of my body and an icy splash of water above my shoulders. I barely had enough time to lift my head and take a breath before continuing to feign death. <em>He tossed me into the water!</em></p> 
                   <p>Through the panic and the loud rush of water over my ears, it took me a moment before I realized two important things: first, despite the pain, I was still alive, and second: my hips were still connected to solid ground. I was not too far under the water.</p> 
                   <p>But there was still the bear! I held my breath, feeling another tap, this time at my ankle. <em>Leave me be</em>, I begged, remaining still as possible, half in the water and my lungs burning with need. <em>Go find something else, before playing dead becomes being dead!</em></p> 
                   <p>I felt nothing else. I knew I shouldn’t move until the bear was long gone. But my lungs were done recycling my one breath; I had no more. My body ached from claw and earth. Moving was my only chance at life, and yet if I moved while the bear was still near, it was certain death. </p> 
                   <p>I waited. And waited.</p> 
                   <p>I felt no more contact. </p> 
                   <p><em>Must…wait. </em></p> 
                   <p><em>Wait.</em></p> 
                   <p><em>Wait.</em></p> 
                   <p><em>I NEED AIR.</em></p> 
                   <p>I turned my head just enough to take in a breath and open one eye and was rewarded. For the bear had reared up, swiping at a blur of speed, dark feathers surrounding sharp eyes. Isul had returned! My beloved friend dove at the bear, distracting him, leading him away from me!</p> 
                   <p>I sat up gasping and, in frenzied haste, looked around for my bow. There! At the water’s edge! I dove for it despite my pain and saw more than felt my hand close around its haft. My other hand fumbled to draw an arrow from my quiver, and with horror, I realized only one remained! The others had tumbled out as the bear tossed me around.</p> 
                   <p>I had to make my shot count. I whistled sharply—a signal to Isul. My falcon friend responded immediately, as I knew he would. He circled up around the bear’s head once, leading the great creature just far enough away. In a moment, he would circle again and expose the bear’s chest and shoulder to me.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>It is very hard to get an exact shot at a bear’s heart, especially when it’s already aggravated. But Isul was well-practiced, and we had hunted together many times. This, at least, was a perfect moment in an otherwise-messy situation. Isul wheeled. The bear turned. For one frozen moment, our eyes met, the bear and me. And then, with more precision than I’d ever had, I loosed the arrow. </p> 
                   <p>The missile flew true, and I was rewarded with the telltale spray of blood, the muscular spasm as the animal decided whether to flee or fight . . . and then it slumped over.</p> 
                   <p>It took me a long moment to work up the nerve to ensure the bear was finished. But finished it was. I sent Isul back to the following with a message asking for assistance. It wasn’t precisely as I’d imagined; the following had to help me as much as help with the bear.</p> 
                   <p>And truly, my following, this is the most important lesson I can give from the tale tonight: we are best when we work together. We must learn to ask for—and accept!—help when needed. My intentions were good, but it was a foolish choice that nearly cost me my life, and nearly cost the following one of its hunters. We are made weaker with each loss of life, just as we are made stronger with each new addition to the following. </p> 
                   <p>This night, I see you all here with me, listening and learning our ways, honoring each other and those who came before. I see you gathered, people of all shapes, all sizes, and my heart is happy. We are stronger for having you. </p> 
                   <p>I celebrate you this night, Broken Tusks. And I know you will face bravely whatever challenges come your way.</p>

                   <p>When a simulated training mission becomes infected by the Data Scourge, the PCs are trapped in Guidance’s corrupted, rapidly deteriorating systems.

                   <p>This month is quite a perilous one for Pathfinder Society’s Inner Sea lodges! You might say we’re looking to shatter a sanctuary or two. In other words, both of our new Pathfinder Society scenarios this month are part of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot!</p> 
                   <p>Our first adventure takes the PCs to the port city of Sedeq in southern Qadira. The Pathfinder Society had previously sent a group of agents to take up residence in their brand new Sedeq lodge, but the agents never arrived!</p> 
                   <p>I’m extremely excited for you to learn what awaits the PCs when they go to investigate the lodge. I think GMs and players alike are going to enjoy the excellent mix of roleplaying, combat, puzzles, and memorable characters in this adventure.</p> 
                   <p>I hope you enjoy <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Foundations-Price"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation’s Price</em></a>, written by Letterio Mammoliti.

                   <p>In our second adventure for January, the PCs are part of an elite task force sent to the beleaguered and besieged Pathfinder lodge in Sothis, Osirion, known as the Sandswept Hall. Undead have been surging up from somewhere in the lodge’s basement, and it’s up to the PCs to undertake dangerous missions and strike back at the army of the dead. Seriously, if you asked me how many undead are in this adventure, I’d be hard pressed to come up with an answer. I lost count.</p> 
                   <p>There are <em>so many undead</em> in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02api?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-309-The-Secluded-Siege"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></a>, written by Lysle Kapp. This adventure for levels 5–8 is the first scenario in a two-part metaplot arc taking place in Osirion.</p> 
                   <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! Have fun stopping the castle from being stormed!</p>

                   <p>This episode, the three questions I will ask are:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>What story does this product help tell?</li> 
                    <li>What rules does this product use most or what innovations does it bring to Pathfinder or Starfinder?</li> 
                    <li>Is there an insider or behind-the-scenes story of the product’s creation you would like to share? A challenge or joy you found?</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p>And then the conversation will unfold from there. In terms of images, we will showcase the final covers, tables of contents, and chapter header art. Finally, when signing off, I will ask each guest for a Paizo LIVE Spoiler. This can be about any announced future product!</p> 
                   <p>Have questions for the guests? Ask them here! Then we’ll see you on Friday, January 21, for Paizo LIVE at <a href="">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a>!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">For the second time today, Ciravel found herself exceedingly grateful for seatbelts and stabilizers.</p> 
                   <p>The first moment of gratitude was during Iseph's dizzying, looping, headlong dash toward Daimalko's surface—a flight where they showed both their skill at threading the space between the enormous meteoroids that surrounded the planet and their delight at making Ciravel shut her eyes despite herself. Ciravel ran and reran the possibilities in her mind, certain that this was the course that resulted in a safe arrival to a canyon on the planet's surface, and yet she still found herself clutching her armrests and putting <em>just enough</em> tension against the straps holding her in to make sure that they would, in fact, hold. </p> 
                   <p>The second moment came thanks to the radiation drake who clamped its crystalline jaws around her hoverchair and shook its head back and forth as if in virulent disagreement with Ciravel's very existence—an action which, without the negation of the stabilizers, would be excruciating, since the surface of this portion of Daimalko unexpectedly lacked many things, including plant life, water, and, much to the chagrin of Ciravel's various joints, consistent gravity. Iseph had anchored themself to one of the rocks which floated above the planet's surface and was locked in combat with a second drake.</p> 
                   <p>"You could have warned me—"</p> 
                   <p>"—about the radiation? The drakes? The battlefield ruins? The asteroids? Did you—oof!—notice the radiation buffers that you were so reluctant to—ow!—pick up this morning? 'But I don't breathe!' Honestly—your head would fall off if I didn't remind you to bring a wrench! YOU could have warned me that you fly like a drunken moldstorm!"</p> 
                   <p>"Can we discuss this when we're not—" Iseph ducked as their drake snapped its jaws shut, barely missing the android and a sending a soft crystalline ring echoing through the canyon, "—about to be turned into scrapyard bits?"</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel closed her eyes and focused her power, channeling it through her extended hand. The possibilities for the drake's next action unfolded before her like cards laid out on a table. She knew what she had to do.</p> 
                   <p>"Iseph, count to ten."</p> 
                   <p><em>Wait for it…</em></p> 
                   <p>"Ciravel, this hardly seems the ideal time for numerical calculation—"</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel shifted her weight, angling her chair slightly as the drake clamped its jaws higher, sending the pistol in her side holster careening toward the rocky ruins below. One more good bite and it would have her.</p> 
                   <p>…Wait…</p> 
                   <p>"…Make that seven."</p>

                    <h3>Illustration by Michele Giorgi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aow?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic">Starfinder Galactic Magic</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <p>The drake's jaws opened momentarily as it repositioned its bite once more. In the precise moment where the drake's gullet was perfectly aligned, Ciravel turned her thrusters on full-force—right down the drake's throat. Its spine glowed with the intense blue flame before it gasped in pain and tumbled to the ground, releasing Ciravel's chair. Moments later, a rocky thud echoed through the canyon. </p> 
                   <p><em>Thank goodness for seat belts</em>, Ciravel thought once again as her chair careened wildly until the thrusters reoriented it. </p> 
                   <p>"Three…two…"</p> 
                   <p>She could see the drake's spine begin to glow again as it readied another beam. She was too far away. She needed more time.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel blinked her eyes, holding the battlefield in stasis as she bolted toward Iseph. </p> 
                   <p>"…one."</p> 
                   <p>Iseph startled slightly at the voice that was suddenly right next to them. Ciravel grabbed the blaster pistol from Iseph's belt and winked. She lifted her chair up and away from Iseph, aiming the pistol directly at the drake, trying to catch its attention and spin it away from Iseph, exposing a heavily wounded flank to their blade. The drake turned, lifting its wing, preparing to follow Ciravel. This time, she looped time into a knot, immediately making the drake forget her presence and leaving it distracted long enough for Iseph to drive their searing blade directly into its wounded gut.</p> 
                   <p>She knew it would cost her later—the exhaustion from this last effort would be brutal—but Ciravel dug deep and twisted time once more, calibrating the trajectory and moment that Iseph's blade entered the drake's thorax, ensuring that it hit every vital organ it could on the way in. The drake collapsed and tumbled to the ground below.</p> 
                   <p>"My pistol?" Iseph outstretched their arm.</p> 
                   <p>"Ah, the 'thanks for saving my circuits, Ciravel' must be a different time thread…" Ciravel maneuvered back toward the rock where Iseph had themselves anchored and winced slightly in pain as she handed back the weapon, stretching her neck. "I think maybe <em>I'll</em> drive home? But let's get our repairs done quickly…I'm sure the Recollectors aren't too far behind us, if they aren't already here." </p> 
                   <p>"Ciravel, perhaps we have sailed the canal that was left."</p> 
                   <p>"The <em>left</em> canal, Iseph. The saying is that you've sailed down the <em>right</em> canal when things go to plan, or the <em>left</em> canal when you cannot locate what you need. But yes, it certainly looks like we might have sailed quite far down the left canal, unfortunately."</p>

                   </center> 
                   <p>She reached into one of the bags attached to the side of her hoverchair and pulled out a handle—which extended into a cane with a press of a button—and a tool kit, then released the safety belts attaching her to the chair. Activating the grav anchors on her boots and retracting the stabilizers, Ciravel stepped onto the hovering rock, and, leaning heavily on her cane, surveyed the damage to the chair. <em>Not too bad, considering the jaws</em>… </p> 
                   <p>Iseph pulled a medical kit from a belt pouch and began doing their own repairs to patch up their wounds—a cut here, a re-soldered circuit there. As Ciravel tightened bolts and reattached anything that had come loose from her chair in the fight, something gnawed at the back of her mind, but she brushed it away. The Recollectors were on their trail and they hadn't found any real clues to the cause of The Awakening, the cataclysm that decimated life on Daimalko. No hint to whether it was a natural event or an apocalyptic weapon used in the bitter war that used to rage on the planet. All Ciravel knew was that when she last held a fragment of rock that originated here, a specimen back in the xenobiology lab in Sovyrian, she tasted time—the only way she could describe the strange way that she suddenly smelled salt and citrus and tasted spiced honey whenever she encountered items from far in the past—a strange sensory activation that tied to her only childhood memory. A memory from the Gap. </p> 
                   <p>There hadn't been a whiff of anything other than sulfur and ozone since they arrived on Daimalko. But the way that rock had hummed in her ears…the song she had heard…what she'd heard…<em>what didn't I hear?</em></p> 
                   <p>"…Iseph, did you hear the impact of the second drake landing in the canyon?"</p> 
                   <p>"An impact? No…I heard an echo of jaws clashing and ringing, your weapon falling, the flames of your chair, the pistol firing, the screams…everything echoed back. But I did not hear a second impact of a drake on the canyon floor."</p> 
                   <p>In that moment, time unfolded for Ciravel as she registered three things. First: the air, which had reeked only of sulfur and centuries of decay, suddenly smelled of salt and citrus. The smell of Time, of the Gap. Second: the sudden darkness that fell when it had, only moments before, been glaringly bright. Night should have been nearly 30 hours away. And finally: the meaning of the absent sound of the drake's impact. Ciravel ran through the possibilities in a split second, and realization made her eyes go wide. </p> 
                   <p>"Um…Iseph?"</p> 
                   <p>"When I have finished repairing, Ciravel, I will assist you. It is already nightfall? We cannot waste our time tonight."</p> 
                   <p>"Iseph…look up. We'll make some extra time."</p> 
                   <p>The android glanced up from the wire they were reconnecting and then continued looking up, and up, and up the exoskeleton, watching in near-wonder as tendrils passed the drake corpse up…and up…and up…far higher than Ciravel's chair could reach on a day when it <em>hadn't</em> been rattled around in the jaws of a drake, past gargantuan claws and tusks.</p> 
                   <p>As her own eyes met the four beady ones of the Kyokor, Ciravel tasted spiced honey.</p> 
                   <p>She stared at the colossus, steadied herself back into her hoverchair, and activated the thrusters. She glided next to Iseph and looked over at them from beneath the creature's shadow, smiling.</p> 
                   <p>"Well, what do you know? Perhaps we sailed the right canal after all."</p>

The <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq">Starfinder Society FAQ</a> has been updated with the information on converting certain boons to Fame; please refer players to that page if they have questions.</p> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p>Last month, we announced that we would be adding <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></a> to the Nova qualification list; however, a paragraph was inadvertently omitted from the blog post. Rather than sneak it in, I decided to save it for this post and announce that <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4z"><em>SFS #1-39: The Herald’s War</em></a> will be retired from Nova qualification. As of <b>March 1, 2022</b>, any future runs of that scenario will not count as Specials for the purpose of Nova qualification. This grace period is intended to allow any GMs who had already been planning to run the scenario for credit to do so before we close the door. We don’t intend to retire any future scenarios from Nova qualification—this scenario was always a stopgap until we had enough scenarios in the requisite level ranges.</p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>With the office quiet for the holidays, we were able to take advantage of our lighter workloads and really blast through the outstanding sanctioning tasks! The following rulebooks and adventures have been <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">sanctioned for play</a> since last month: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2"><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em></a> Adventure Path, and rules options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/agentsOfEdgewatch"><em>Agents of Edgewatch</em> Adventure Path</a> (via the Achievement Points system). For Starfinder, we harnessed the power of the precog, and can announce that we have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aow?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a> ready to go for its street date!</p> 
                   <p>We’ve also got some sanctioning in the pipeline that’s not quite ready yet, but watch the @PaizoOrgPlay Twitter feed for sanctioning announcements, or check back here next month.</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Glyph for Pathfinder Society (second edition)!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Glyph</b> - Tim Ayers</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GM, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you’ve achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the new year!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“You stand defeated, Voradni Voon!” Melika shouted, brandishing her tin sword at Elophos. The older actor bellowed, throwing his hands up in a defiant gesture meant to cover a quick tightening of the straps holding on his minotaur horns, which had begun to slide dangerously sideways.</p> 
                   <p>“Never!” Elophos cried, trotting back a few showy steps as he finished steadying his headgear. Horns secured, he charged forward again, thrusting his sword at Melika. “So long as he stands, Voradni Voon is not defeated!”</p> 
                   <p>“The earth has swallowed your army. Your centaurs are dead, your harpies scattered like frightened pigeons. Surrender!” Melika jabbed at Elophos’s midsection. The thrust was absurdly slow and clumsy—old Halvorash would have boxed her ears for signaling the lunge with her eyes and feet so long before she struck—but the flaws that would have doomed her in an alley fight were virtues on the stage. An audience wasn’t a footpad with a shank; you were <em>supposed</em> to help them see what was coming.</p> 
                   <p>“Voradni Voon will devour your heart and claim your godhood, puny human!” Elophos roared, swinging his stubby sword in broad arcs. Both actors’ weapons were shortened, letting them maximize the number of swings they could make before reaching each other onstage. Melika was impressed that Elophos managed to fit six full arcs in before he closed on her. He must have tweaked his pacing; he’d only ever managed five before.</p> 
                   <p>She dropped to one knee, exaggerating the height difference between them, and thrust upward, gripping her abbreviated sword’s hilt with both hands like a spear. Another absurdity for the stage, but it roused an anticipatory cheer from the audience, and then an expectant hush.</p> 
                   <p>Elophos didn’t disappoint them. Menacingly he stalked forward, having backed away in mock apprehension as Melika crouched. He charged straight onto the up-thrust point, then staggered back with a thunderous gasp, his sword arm pinwheeling in feigned death agonies. “Nooo!”</p> 
                   <p>“You would not stand defeated, Voradni Voon, so you must fall,” Melika intoned, striking a heroic pose, as Elophos crumpled slowly to the stage boards, clutching the blade “impaled” into his chest to keep it from falling.</p>

                    <h3>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The audience burst into cheers. Elophos skipped back to his feet, handed Melika her sword, and shared a bow as the curtains came down. No sooner had the gold-fringed cloth dropped over them than they hopped down the back stairs, moving aside so the stage crew could clear their painted scenery and set up the next troupe’s props.</p> 
                   <p>Already, the painted wooden harpies and centaurs from <em>The Defeat of Voradni Voon</em> were being loaded onto wagons to be carted away for storage. They’d performed the act six times today, moving from stage to stage across Absalom, and now they were done. The sun was sinking westward, and night was soon to drop a final curtain on Foundation Day.</p> 
                   <p>It had been glorious—but now, already, Melika felt the warmth of the crowds and her own joy stealing away from her as swiftly as the fading light.</p> 
                   <p>Melika sighed. She pulled off the papier-mache crown and false mustache she’d worn as Aroden, unhooked the gaudy, gold-lined cape that she’d swirled through six victories over Voradni Voon, and folded them up, along with her dreams, inside the box that Elophos’s troupe would soon pack away.</p> 
                   <p>She wasn’t an actor, not really, not like the rest of them. Melika was just a serving girl. That morning, she’d been carrying a pitcher of wash water through the commons, just as the visiting troupe learned that their original Aroden was chained to her chamber pot following an encounter with a bad eel pie.</p> 
                   <p>As the actors were absorbing the bad news, one of the inn’s cats ran under Melika’s feet. She’d jumped, side-stepped, and recovered without spilling a drop. This impromptu demonstration led Elophos to conclude that she was strong and nimble enough to handle the fight choreography, about the right size to fit into Aroden’s costume, and therefore an adequate substitute for the show that they were contractually obligated to put onstage in two hours.</p> 
                   <p>“You’ll have ten lines,” he’d told her as he buckled the green-gold cape around her shoulders and pasted the horsehair mustache onto her face. “You can do it. Ten lines, and it doesn’t even matter if you get them wrong.”</p> 
                   <p>She hadn’t gotten them wrong. Six times she’d performed, each better than the last, as she learned to draw out the crowd and channel its energy into joy.</p> 
                   <p>And now it was over. Playing at the actor’s life had been fun, but Melika had siblings to feed and a sickly mother to tend. That painted crown wasn’t real gold, and it wouldn’t keep her family clothed.</p> 
                   <p>Heroism seemed so simple on stage. Maybe that was what people really liked to cheer, more than Aroden: the uncomplicated surety of right and wrong. The odds were stacked, the lines were scripted, and the heroes of legend never had anyone but themselves to think about. Their families were always conveniently faraway or dead—or at the very least, dependent on the same dramatic acts that the hero was already poised to commit.</p> 
                   <p>Heroes on a stage didn’t have to be quietly reliable for those they loved. Their bravado was just like their fighting: showy and false, with none of the dirt or desperation that grimed real struggle.</p> 
                   <p>Melika sighed. Though false, the dream was tempting. It surely was a pretty crown. And she’d probably never again touch cloth as fine as that cloak’s, stained and threadbare though it was.</p> 
                   <p>“You alright?” Elophos asked, vigorously toweling his sweat-matted hair. Six mock fights under the heavy, horned pelt of Voradni Voon had left him soaked.</p> 
                   <p>“I need to get back to work,” Melika told him.</p> 
                   <p>He counted out the money, then paused. “It’s Foundation Day. You don’t have the day off to celebrate?”</p> 
                   <p>“Someone has to work for other people to celebrate,” Melika pointed out, dryly, but only after she’d pocketed the coin. You didn’t talk back before you got their money. “You didn’t think all those mugs of beer poured or washed themselves, did you?” It occurred to her that maybe he <em>did</em> think that. Nobody had ever said that actors were overburdened with good sense.</p> 
                   <p>Elophos just shrugged. “But it’s Foundation Day.”</p> 
                   <p>“It is. So I should get back. They’ll need me.”</p> 
                   <p>“You could stay with us. Be an actor. You’re a natural on stage.”</p> 
                   <p>“For less than what I earn now?” Melika snorted. She’d worked hard for that inn job. Decent pay, extra food, sometimes clothes or even boots that drunk patrons left behind. If Elophos had ever been half as cold and hungry as she’d been before the inn, he would know what it meant to give that up.</p> 
                   <p>“It might not be less. Not for long.” His speculative look was greedy enough that she almost believed him. “You’ve got talent.”</p> 
                   <p>“Talent and a houseful of hungry siblings. Guess which one yells louder.”</p> 
                   <p>“Well, think about it.” Elophos tossed the towel over his shoulder. “A lot of us will be headed to the Wounded Wisp after sundown, if you think you can get away from washing those beer mugs for a bit. Talk to some people. Make some friends. Perhaps you’ll see that the stage pays well enough to keep a houseful of hungry siblings fed.”</p> 
                   <p>“Maybe.” Melika walked away, through the thronging crowds of revelers, other people’s joy and laughter scattered around her like flower petals. She didn’t begrudge their happiness. It meant good tips.</p> 
                   <p>And as she walked, she turned Elophos’s suggestion around and around, like a coin in her pocket she was debating how to spend. Maybe she did have talent. Maybe she could feed her family that way. Maybe it wasn’t stupid to spend an hour finding out.</p> 
                   <p>The Wounded Wisp...</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">They’d landed on a port moon to rehaul their ship before rendezvousing with the rest of the Pact World diplomatic team on a newly discovered world called Sigerro. A routine enough stop, but then, even in Near Space, the routine could quickly turn to excitement.</p> 
                   <p>Zemir and Raia, part of the command team, were sent to find upgraded Drift drives for their ship. The thought was that Raia’s eye for tech would aid in finding the best equipment and Zemir’s tendency to bend chance might allow them to purchase it at a low price. </p> 
                   <p>The technomancer and witchwarper debated the differences between their respective talents while perusing the port’s open-air markets. </p> 
                   <p>“Our methods differ only in scope. You use your gifts to push technology,” said Zemir, tossing another faulty circuit board into a display case, “whereas I use mine to push reality.”</p> 
                   <p>“Your scope may be wider,” said Raia, examining some drive schematics absently. “But my tech produces more reliable results.”</p> 
                   <p>“Reliability is irrelevant. In the end, we seek the same thing—the new, impossible, the interesting. Is how we do it so important?”</p> 
                   <p>“Some would say the ‘how’ is the most important part of all,” Raia answered, smiling. It was an old debate between friends, one they’d cheerfully had over drinks in many a space port. </p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps you’re right,” said Zemir quietly. Raia recognized that faraway look. One day she’d learn the cause of Zemir’s periodic melancholy. </p> 
                   <p>Before Zemir could say more, the market fell eerily silent. Everyone around them stared upward. Zemir and Raia joined them, and watched as the moon eclipsed the sun, and all went dark.</p> 
                   <p>Soon after, the chittering squeaks and clicks began.</p> 
                   <p>“I recognize those sounds,” said Raia. “Grioths.”</p> 
                   <p>“What, this far in Near Space?” asked Zemir. </p> 
                   <p>“They get closer every year,” said Raia sadly. She found grioths a fascinating formation of life. It’s too bad so many of them were in the monstrous grip of Nyarlathotep, for their voidglass technology and biology was quite interesting and could be put to great use in the Pact Worlds.</p> 
                   <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by holes opening in the moon-eclipsed sky. From these shadowy portals descended a wave of winged terrors. The grioths’ silhouettes looked like thousands of bats with arms and legs—all of which held glittering weaponry.</p> 
                   <p>The technomancer and the witchwarper watched the marketgoers flee. In silent agreement, both stood still amid the chaos, knowing they could hold off the grioths and allow these citizens to get to safety. </p> 
                   <p>Several grioth raiders noticed the two holding their ground and broke off to attack them. Raia picked off one with a single blaster pulse while Zemir stared at another and muttered. Suddenly, the grioth’s wing seized and it plummeted to the ground. That left three more, who charged in a whirl of chittering squeaks and gleaming, deadly glass. </p> 
                   <p>A fourth landed in front of Raia and swiped at her with its giant, clawed hand.</p> 
                   <p>“No,” said Raia calmly, stepping back and raising her hands. She felt composed, as though in a simulation. She had spent the better part of the afternoon familiarizing herself with the tech around her, and now she simply had to put it to work, albeit for a new purpose.</p> 
                   <p>As the grioth tried to grasp her again, she cast a spell with a word and a gesture. Behind her, the vast engine powering the veranda block rumbled and cracked. Suddenly, as though it were a puppet pulled by the technomancer’s strings, it unleashed from its casing and wrapped the grioth in an unbreakable embrace of steel and coiled wire.</p> 
                   <p>Zemir watched his friend fight and wondered how best to aid her in the dance. He was no slouch with a blade, but with so many opponents, more help was needed. </p> 
                   <p>What if, perhaps, another portal opened? One to a world filled with bright sunlight? Zemir pondered the possibilities and adjusted probabilities as though inputting calculations into the ultimately unknowable machine that was the universe. Calculations that, due to his training at the institute, he sometimes knew the outcomes for.</p> 
                   <p>A bright portal to a sun-filled world opened, a world with—yes, perfect—a swarm of apari constituents, who poured from the portal, angry and hungry. The grioths shrieked at the light, some clutching their faces as its very photons pierced their psychic defenses. At Zemir’s direction, the apari swarm crashed against the grioths like a wave, instinctively trying to strike back against invaders who would darken a world. </p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“You will all perish for the glory of our dark master,” whispered one of grioth invaders with a harsh rasp. Before he could say more, he was overwhelmed by the swarm of apari.</p> 
                   <p>He could have run—but he wouldn’t. Helping Raia made it worth it; knowing that, in some small way, Zemir had adjusted his account, paying back what he’d done wrong. He might never be able to atone for leaving his friends in that other reality, might never be able to get them back (though another part of him still wondered about this) but here, now, at least he and his friend Raia could save each other. </p> 
                   <p>Together, weaving reality and technology with threads of magic, the technomancer and witchwarper beat back the remaining two grioth attackers, their martial prowess no match for the pair’s magical mastery. </p> 
                   <p>“We have to get to the ship,” said Zemir once they had a moment to catch their breath. “I can open a gateway there, but I’ve expended a lot of power and can only take myself.”</p> 
                   <p>“Go. I know you won’t leave me behind,” said Raia. For some reason, Zemir looked inexplicably sad at that.</p> 
                   <p>“I will come back for you,” Zemir promised gravely. He stepped through the portal and was gone. </p> 
                   <p>Raia waited, holding glowing sigils and technical weapons in the dark marketplace. From the chittering and squeaks, she knew another squad of grioths was inbound. With all the tech around her, Raia knew she could hold them off, but not indefinitely. She just hoped that Zemir would get back with the ship in time. </p>

                   <p>It will probably come as a surprise to no one that my biggest sci-fi influences are largely comedic. I mean, when faced with yawning infinite void of space, you just have to laugh, right? For me, it probably started with <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> in all its forms: books, radio play, text adventure, BBC series, and eventually, major motion picture. There’s something so relatable about a hapless Earthling being thrust into a galactic adventure of stolen spaceships, time travel, and bureaucracy. From there, I would find Space Quest (featuring the first space janitor?), <em>Red Dwarf </em>(“Everybody’s. Dead. Dave.”), <em>Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon</em> (though that series is more a vehicle for puns than anything else), and Futurama (best math jokes in the biz!). The goofier episodes of <em>The X-Files</em> and <em>Farscape</em> are among my favorite. More recently, <em>Galaxy Quest</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> have taken their shots at that most venerable of sci-fi institutions, Star Trek. Much of comedic sci-fi lovingly pokes fun at its own genre or points at the foibles of the present through a sci-fi lens. And that’s the kind of influence I try to bring to Starfinder when appropriate. Our iconic biohacker hosts a family-friendly science-oriented vidshow that often leads to more danger than it should. A group of skittermanders rescue their vesk boss from a dangerous massage machine. I love adding those sorts of touches, and I hope you enjoy them too! I can’t wait for you to see what’s next!</p>

                   <p>My dad got me into science fiction at an early age, with Heinlein’s <em>Rocket Ship Galileo</em>. Heinlein wrote a YA science fiction novel every year, just in time for Christmas. It was a smart strategy. I don’t know how many of those books I read: <em>Have Spacesuit Will Travel</em>, <em>The Star Beast</em>, <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em>. In high school, I had my first actual class on science fiction, which introduced me to everything from Asimov and John Carter to <em>Riverworld</em> and Chalker’s <em>Well of Souls</em>; predictably, my final project was a Well of Souls wargame I designed myself. In fact, by this point, my science fiction intake was starting to be determined as much by games as by novels; I spent my rainy days pouring over <em>Traveler’s Imperium</em>, rolling random mutations in <em>Gamma World</em>, and playing <em>Star Fleet Battles</em>. When I got to college, I wandered the campus bookstore looking for stuff I’d never heard of before, and that got me to Phil Dick’s <em>Man in the High Castle</em> and the <em>Mirrorshades</em> anthology, which broke open the cyberpunk genre. It took me a couple of tries to figure out Dune. As a graduate student, I studied science fiction under the great and much-missed Dr. George Slusser, curator of the University of California Riverside’s Eaton Collection, one of the largest collections of SF in the world. One day, on my way out of class, I told Slusser, “You know, I want your job.” He said to me, “Stick around here long enough, you might get it.” When he passed in 2014, I applied for that gig. I didn’t get it, but no regrets. Now, I get to make science fiction instead of curate it, and some of the things I’ve made are on the shelves of the Eaton Collection. I’ll take that deal.</p>

                   <p>We’re standing next to each other at a convention. It’s loud and crowded here in the dealer hall, but we’ve identified one another as fellow sci-fi nerds; the awkward serendipity when two weirdos recognize each other in the wild. We’ve been existing in a pandemic for two years at this point so we desperately want to chat with someone new, so we’re eager to start a conversation. Our hobby is our common ground, so we start talking about favorite works of sci-fi. You list the various novels, video games, and films that first connected you to a network of other minds imagining extraordinary realities. I tell you I’m inspired by the works of Yoko Taro, Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Tade Thompson, and the Strugatsky brothers. Then you ask one of those classic icebreaker questions: Which Star Trek is your favorite?</p>

                   <p>I shrug. I’m not really into Star Trek, but I watched some with my parents growing up. (Star Wars’ western vibe was always more my jam, but my dad’s a certified trekkie.) So I tell you that my favorite is Voyager. Why? You ask. You’re correctly assuming Captain Janeway has something to do with it. We rewind to my childhood. When my parents began watching Voyager, I was an awkward girl with scabbed knees and an unflattering bowl cut. During the show’s run, I transformed from invisible tomboy to sullen preteen. I hated my body and wasn’t comfortable with the changes puberty was enforcing on it. I didn’t agree with everything I saw in the world around me. I was powerless to change anything and waiting for my real life to begin. Enter Seven of Nine, a badass with a crisp Federation uniform and stylish pixie cut. She was everything I dreamed of becoming. In her, I saw the future.</p> 
                   <p>But she was more than a childhood role model for me. Even though I never watched the entire series, Seven’s narrative first sparked my interest in telling stories that explore the definition of humanity and the nature of the soul. She was concrete evidence of a feminine person driving her own narrative. And there were others like her. Ripley, Sarah Connor, General Leia, and (much later) Furiosa became favorite characters and visions of powerful femininity, canonized as goddesses in a new pantheon. I expect that of all my space heroines, Seven of Nine had the deepest influence on me. </p> 
                   <p>Now, imagine yourself back in the convention hall. You listen politely to my explanation and we gush about our favorite sci-fi characters for few more minutes. I ask you another question, maybe about video games, and the ice is broken. We chat for a while. We say goodbye and head off to our next destinations, happy to have met and befriended a fellow nerd.</p> 
                   <p>But, I digress. This is a blog about sci-fi in general, not “POV: you meet me at a convention.” Sci-fi works have had such an influence on my life, and it’s pretty amazing to be able to call myself a sci-fi creator now. When experiencing sci-fi, we can dream of other worlds near and far. We can hope for a bright solarpunk future and try to write it into being, or examine the great conflicts of our own lives, our fears, our struggles, through a lens that allows others to understand us better. Thanks to all of you for your interest in other worlds, and expect the aliens, philosophical machines, mechs, and space shenanigans to continue. </p>

                   <p>When I look back at this year, I think the theme is resilience through uncertainty. Between shipping crises (remember when the boat was stuck? good times!), the ongoing pandemic, and shakeups at Paizo, this year has been tumultuous, to say the least. But this is the best community out there, and you all have rolled with the punches, adapted to the new terrain, and kept playing with us. I can’t thank you all enough for everything, and I can’t wait to see you all in 2022.</p> 
                   <p>Before I leave you, I have a message from Mike Kimmel to share.</p> 
                   <hr width="50%"> 
                   <p>Hey everyone! The end of the calendar year also marks the end of my first year on the Organized Play team. It’s been a year filled with challenges, rewards, and adventures. One of my fondest memories of the year was being able to write my first adventure outline for Paizo, which led to a little bounty called Hillcross Roundup. I’m looking forward to outlining and developing more adventures and tackling more challenges in the months ahead. Later this year, we’ll be wrapping up the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries and jumping into Year 4. I can’t wait to share these exciting adventures with you! I hope I’ll have opportunities to meet and interact with more members of the community in 2022, whether that’s online, in person, or both. I want to hear all about your adventures!</p> 
                   <hr width="50%"> 
                   <p>Stay safe and warm, and until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And we’ll see you in 2022!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“A new game?” Kesara asked, her old Vudrani hands already sweeping the drouge pieces off the embroidered cloth, milk-pale jade and black onyx figurines vanishing like magician’s coins between her bony fingers.</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai shrugged, smiling, and uncapped his flask of blackdream liqueur. He waved it at Kesara, chuckling when she wrinkled her nose in disgust at the offer, as she always did. Unoffended, Guan Kai sipped the murky, anise-scented drink. “What choice do I have? You’ve cleared the board. Just when I was winning, too.”</p> 
                   <p>“There was no winning that game.” Kesara dealt new pieces onto the cloth with the swift flourishes of a professional gambler, which Guan Kai supposed she was, after a fashion. “This one will be better. New pieces, new board. Very friendly.” With a motion, Kesara substituted the black jackals from the original set with a pair of lions from her near-inexhaustible supply of alternate pieces. Playfully, she set two pennies carefully on the lions’ heads like little copper crowns, then spun them with a flick of her fingertips. The metal disks twirled momentarily atop the figures before clattering dully onto the cloth.</p> 
                   <p><em>So</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>she wants to bargain a secret about some instability in Taldor.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Speaking of friends,” Kesara asked casually, “do you still have yours in the Chrysanthemum Court?”</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai took another pull from his flask. “Naturally. A man as old as I either has no friends, or too many to count. One’s habits add up to the sum of one’s life, as the sages say.”</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                    <h3>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens.</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“Do they? I wouldn’t know. I’m a dewy spring blossom, myself.” Kesara’s eyes vanished into her wrinkles when she laughed. She plucked the white jade elephants from the board and made a show of hesitating before she replaced them. “Now which of my little pieces would best serve your side? I presume, after a lifetime’s likeability, you could name 16 close friends in the Court?”</p> 
                   <p>She was feeling him out, trying to see which of the Successor States of Lung Wa might offer the best price for her information. Guan Kai pretended to ignore the bait. It was ridiculous for him to offer anything; Kesara hadn’t even hinted what secret she was trying to sell. How could he know who wanted it? “I’m an easy man to like. Even in Shenmen, I might find a few friends.”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh, no, not Shenmen. Just the name of that haunted place gives me chills.”</p> 
                   <p>“No need to worry. It’s very far from here.” Information about the Imperial Court of Taldor was unlikely to be of value to the Successor States, he meant.</p> 
                   <p>“The Court isn’t far at all.” Kesara lifted her chin, nodding to the high white tower of the Starstone Cathedral behind them. “Just on the other side of that great gaudy sundial.”</p> 
                   <p>Ah, so her secret wasn’t being dangled for the Successor States themselves, but for their envoys. The Chrysanthemum Court was the unofficial embassy for dignitaries from all the many kingdoms of Tian Xia. Business that was too risky or sordid to pass through diplomatic channels often wound up there.</p> 
                   <p>This game had suddenly become more interesting. Guan Kai took another sip from his flask, then capped it with a flourish and set it aside. His blood was warm enough without the liquor. “I can hardly choose a piece without seeing the sample available for selection.”</p> 
                   <p>“I suppose that’s fair.” Rather than offering him a choice of white pieces, however, Kesara plucked an onyx boar from her case and set it between the lions. It was an ugly, pugnacious thing, its glittering tusks thrust out in belligerent menace.</p> 
                   <p>Baronet Ghazolain. His family crest carried a boar against crossed spears, and he’d recently arrived in Absalom as part of the Taldan diplomatic delegation. Scarcely a month had passed since the baronet arrived in the City at the Center of the World, yet already foul rumors followed him. Tales abounded of stained altars covered in clandestine artifacts, inhuman chants and cries from his quarters at night, and grim-faced servants who nursed unexplained wounds and then disappeared altogether.</p> 
                   <p>Or so people said. Guan Kai had learned to dismiss most such rumors—they were true only rarely, and useful even less. But now, it made sense why Kesara was angling for a buyer from the Successor States: the baronet was also said to be urgently litigating some kind of family claim in Amanadar, a former Taldan colony now counted among the 16 Successor States of Lung Wa.</p> 
                   <p>“Interesting,” Guan Kai said. “I would have thought the boar should go on my side.”</p> 
                   <p>“I assure you, the boar is opposed to any piece you might choose,” Kesara said. Her rheumy eyes were sharp and intense beneath their clouds of age as she split her fingers into a triangle around the boar’s head. An old sign, from when they’d first played at spycraft, as children.</p> 
                   <p><em>Danger</em>. Danger that would seize your throat and twist your head off without trying.</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai smiled. “Really? Fascinating. Then I shall choose a devil, for a beast so fearsome deserves an equally formidable foe.” He’d kept his answer malleable on purpose. The devil could certainly represent Chu Ye, ruled by oni, but it could just as easily mean Cheliax. The Western devil-binders were always willing to pay for dangerous secrets, even those that didn’t concern them.</p> 
                   <p>Kesara shook her head. Her gaze lingered on a pair of dogs pulling a wagon in the street. The animals greeted one another cheerfully, interrupting their own work to wag tails and exchange sniffs. “Look there, behind you. Some creatures understand the value of loyalty. Some people, too. I said this should be a friendly game—you’d be well advised to keep only true friends on your board, and fiends are never that. But, of course, you’re free to choose the pieces that suit your strategy. I can only make suggestions.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Ah, so</em>. Guan Kai felt peculiarly warmed by Kesara’s warning. Seventy years they’d played the game together, though she owed him no favors. They’d been rivals as often as allies, and each had betrayed the other far too many times for any attempt at tallying to be worthwhile.</p> 
                   <p>Still, in this, she warned him. This information was too explosive to be entrusted to treacherous hands.</p> 
                   <p>And now he understood. Kesara didn’t want to sell her secret after all. She wanted help. Baronet Ghazolain was involved in something so terrible that the 10,000 whisperers of Jalmeray were reaching out to Guan Kai, and his friends, for aid. And they were sending that request as secretly as they knew how, lest the baronet’s spies catch a whisper of their plea.</p> 
                   <p>“Very well,” Guan Kai said. “I choose the dragon and the rat.”</p> 
                   <p>Kesara nodded. A tiny knot of tension softened in her shoulders. <em>She must be terrified</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>if her worry shows so plainly</em>.</p> 
                   <p>But Kesara had spent 70 years learning to control such fear, and her voice was calm as aloe. “Let our game begin.”</p>

                   <h3>Dana Ebert</h3> 
                   <p>Hi there! It's Dana Ebert (she/her), and I'm so excited to be back so soon! In <em>Monsters of Myth</em>, I took on Desert's Howl, which first appeared in <em>Mythical Monsters Revisited</em> almost ten years ago. This version expands on Jalari's story, while reimagining Desert's Howl as a unique monster with brand new lore and abilities for Second Edition.</p> 
                   <p>I honestly adore the final stat block for Desert's Howl. I conceptualized its abilities with the intent of using mechanics to convey the feeling of being hunted and toyed with, and this version is simply vicious at denying the player characters rest and recovery in between encounters with the creature. With the release of this book, I hope that there'll be a few more Desert's Howl fans in the future!</p> 
                   <p>As always, thank you so much for reading and making this community such a wonderful place! If you use Desert's Howl or any of its lore in your campaign (I'm very fond of Jalari's treasure coins, myself), I would love to hear about it on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG">https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG</a>). And if you ever want to know more about what I'm currently working on, you can find that information on my Linktree (<a href="https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG">https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG</a>).</p>

                   <h3>Sen.H.H.S</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, readers and greetings from Sen.H.H.S., your freelancer who lives across the Pacific Ocean from North America. You may have seen me around in projects such as Bestiary 3, Ruby Phoenix's Goka Gazetteer, <em>Secret of Magic</em>, and many other publications. For <em>Monsters of Myth</em>, I wrote the kaijus. When this assignment first came down, I was internally screaming because my gods, the pressure to deliver! Just how am I going to do these gigantic walking natural or supernatural disasters justice? After copious amounts of kaiju wikia consumption and kaiju movie clips (Pacific Rim is the best movie ever!) I hope the end result is as awe-inspiring (or horror-inspiring) as intended. If you’re interested in knowing what I'm up to recently in the TTRPG sphere, follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a> where I bemoan how my current reading list of forensic textbooks is raising eyebrows. </p>

                   <h3>Aaron Lascano</h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Aaron, and I wrote and designed rules for two sections in <em>Monsters of Myth</em>: Kuworsys and Somnalu. I had an absolute blast working on both of them, as I did a bit of research and reading of epic myth to prepare (a quick recommendation: <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is a genuinely incredible read). I’m fascinated by how myths are remembered, and how interpretations and treatments of myth change over time. I hope my sections even encourage players to do a bit of that themselves.</p> 
                   <p>With Kuworsys, I had the opportunity to craft a new story around a pre-existing location, and with Somnalu, I got to contribute to the story of a legendary figure from Pathfinder’s past. I’m very excited for players to explore the ever-shifting ruins of Kuworsys’s labyrinth and to descend into the depths to confront slithering Somnalu.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested, you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/devlascano">@devlascano</a>. I make narrative-focused TTRPGs on Itch and I do freelance work on games whenever an opportunity arises. Cheers! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                   <p>Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, writer of xulgaths and quite a few other monsters at this point. For this project, I worked alongside Josh Kim and Liane Merciel. Josh wrote Kothogaz’s lore, and turning that into rules was an exciting challenge. I wanted a big, campaign-ending abomination to have more ‘breadth’ in the story than just the confrontation where you hope to kill it. For the Melfesh Monster, I just got to read through Liane’s fantastic work and pluck out tidbits to turn into monster abilities—she gave me a ton to work with!</p> 
                   <p>Beyond my co-authors, I want to give a special thanks to my cousin Sameer Gupta. He’s a talented musician who focuses on American jazz and Indian classical music. Given Kothogaz’s ties to Vudra, it was important that I do right by any real-world Indian cultural aspects I used for inspiration. Without Sameer, the Craft Disharmonic Instrument and Raga of Remembrance sections wouldn’t be nearly as flavorful, interesting, or accurate. You can check him out <a href="https://sameergupta.com/press-quotes-artist-bio/">on his website</a>, and across social media as <a href="https://twitter.com/tablajazz">@tablajazz</a>. I also highly recommend his album “A Circle Has No Beginning”—it’s gotten me through a lot of late night deadline pushes!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Shay Snow</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow (they/them), I'm an editor at Paizo, and I wrote up the Kallas Devil and partnered with the extremely talented Liane Merciel to stat up Ulgrem-Axaan! I hope my skipping rhyme and lovely letters bring you lots of shivers, and I hope you enjoy all of the neat things that both the Kallas Devil and Ulgrem-Axaan can do for your games! You may have seen me in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, and I have a few things coming out in <em>Galactic Magic</em>. Additionally, you can find my name on a few Coyote &amp; Crow projects!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You can keep up with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href="https://shayjay.carrd.co/">https://shayjay.carrd.co/</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Soup</h3> 
                   <p>"Heya, I’m Soup! I’m a nonbinary Korean-American freelance writer/game designer/podcaster/streamer. I love nothing more than cool new angles on classic fantasy tropes. I’m really excited for this book because I got to draw from Korean mythology and tradition to bring you the Taljjae, a creature inspired by the real-life mask dancing of Korea, and hopefully a cool addition to your games. You can find me streaming video games here (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup">https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup</a>), my work here (<a href="https://literalsoup.com/">https://literalsoup.com/</a>), listen to my podcast here (<a href="http://absoluteterritorycast.com/">http://absoluteterritorycast.com/</a>), or contact me about business inquiries at literalsoup@gmail.com." </p>

                   <p>From a tall tower of ivory Tondro arose,<br> Where tales of Tolkien and Arthur he’d told.<br> But he exited, hexed, a man in exile,<br> To get a gamer’s refuge working for golems.<br> Then in plague, a plentiful pestilence,<br> Luis and Eleanor, developers at large,<br> Boldly offered a boon to the bairn.<br> “Fafnheir,” they said first, “of linnorms the father<br> “And Grogrisant, greedy for imperial guts<br> “Belong in this book, do not betray us!”<br> This task Tondro gladly took up<br> And laboring long in darkness and light<br> He sang the six-eyed lion’s song<br> And wove a wyrm from stubborn words.</p>

                   <p>For the last three holiday seasons, VC Nicholas Ruchlewicz has organized charity events for his local lodge to help others. The Toys for Tots program is a wonderful way to get into the holiday spirit and help those in need! </p> 
                   <p>This year, the charity event expanded from a single local lodge in Fairfax to multiple REGIONS! Obviously, during covid time, everyone has become more flexible with hybrid events—so this event had a physical presence organized by Northern Virginia Venture Captain Nicholas and Baltimore Venture Lieutenant Nathan, plus online offerings including VOs from other lodges a bit further from the DC area. This year, the VOs directly engaged our Friendly Local Game Stores (FLGS). We have all been through difficult times with the pandemic, including many of the small businesses that support our players in a safe, welcoming environment. The community was able to support the amazing charity by purchasing toys and books at the FLGS and immediately donating them to the onsite Toys for Tots boxes.</p> 
                   <p>On 12/11/2021, Pathfinders participated in interactive special PF2 #3-99 Fate in the Future at the Cayden’s Keg convention. This charity event added 7 physical tables to the 19 online tables! In addition to the physical toy donations, the raffle ticket sales provided an additional $1320+ donation to the cause. </p> 
                   <p>Below are the locations and Venture officers in each FLGS! If you are ever near one of our lodges, please visit their business—we can’t thank our community enough! </p>

The older man didn’t seem aware of the dark shapes stalking him, first from a distance, then closer, along his path. Nor did he show surprise when the ruffians stepped out of the shadows, blades glinting. The tallest of the black-clad figures spoke with a low growl.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">As the white-bearded man casually strolled across the rainy courtyard, shadowy figures kept pace with him atop the buildings surrounding the square. The older man didn’t seem aware of the dark shapes stalking him, first from a distance, then closer, along his path. Nor did he show surprise when the ruffians stepped out of the shadows, blades glinting. The tallest of the black-clad figures spoke with a low growl.</p> 
                   <p>“Shouldn’t have gotten involved in War Hounder business, old man. We don’t like folks asking questions about our dealings!”</p> 
                   <p><em>“Well,</em>” Ezren thought to himself, “<em>it’s about time</em>.”</p> 
                   <p>Though confident in his preparations, the wizard still summoned some basic defenses as the War Hounders cautiously approached. A mage’s armor was, in his opinion, properly made of magic. He layered a <em>shield</em> spell atop it for good measure.</p> 
                   <p>One of the ruffians flung a dagger at Ezren as the rest moved to cut off his escape routes… which he had no intention of taking.</p> 
                   <p>“I’ve been trying to get your attention for some time,” Ezren said calmly as the knife bounced off his arcane shield. Unsurprisingly, the War Hounders ignored him. Ezren knew they were aware of his wizardly training and understood their desire to take him out quickly. If this had been a remotely fair fight, they’d be doing the right thing. </p> 
                   <p>Ezren did his best to avoid “fair” fights, though. A fair fight was the result of poor research, and he prided himself on his scholarship.</p> 
                   <p>His two fastest attackers were a scarred human and a dwarf; each wielding sword and dagger. Ezren reviewed a range of possible replies before settling on a simple lightning cantrip. Not fully powered, something in the mid-range he knew they’d survive. He wanted to deliver a message and getting the dead to deliver messages was more… problematic.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren concentrated on the essence of lightning as he performed word and gesture to express that essence. Electricity jolted from his open hand, arcing first to the human and then the dwarf. Neither was quick enough to avoid his spell. The dwarf fell to the ground, flopping about like a fish trapped in a tide pool. The human grunted and raised his sword… as Merisiel’s thrown dagger buried itself in the back of his skull.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren was not so foolish as to provoke a guild of thieves without backup, and it was gratifying to see the remaining War Hounders look stunned at Merisiel’s dramatic entrance. A moment later, it was Ezren’s turn to be surprised as a fifth War Hounder, a cloaked woman with two long daggers, launched herself between Merisiel and the fallen dwarf.</p> 
                   <p>The situation was still in hand… for now.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“I know you can’t answer my questions.” Ezren’s sounded calm as he turned in place, his cane held high to ward off the two-handed sword blow from the War Hounder who’d been trying to sneak up behind him. “But when you flee back to the Pyramid of the Dog, I want you to deliver your master a message.”</p> 
                   <p>The cloaked woman began dragging the dwarf’s twitching body back into the shadows, tiny sparks of electricity continuing to bound off him across the worn road’s shallow puddles. The attacker with the greatsword swung it again, trying to cut Ezren in half with an attack powerful enough to force the wizard to expend his arcane shield to counter it. Merisiel threw another dagger into an apparently empty space… and the empty space grunted and spattered blood on the street.</p> 
                   <p>“I’d have sent a courier requesting an audience, but none seemed willing to deliver my message, and I haven’t had any luck with public notices.”</p> 
                   <p>Ezren formed a new eldritch concept in his mind, and colors sprayed out from his cane, hitting the greatsword-wielder full in the face. The attacker’s eyes took on the same rainbow colors, and the scoundrel dropped his sword as he staggered away unsteadily. The cloaked woman finished dragging her fallen comrade out of sight, and Merisiel positioned herself to watch his back.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren turned slowly, scanning the open square. The blinded War Hounder was wandering aimlessly but could become a threat again within a minute or so. The woman and dwarf were out of sight but could potentially be maneuvering to make another assault. Merisiel would warn him if that were to happen. There was another man…</p> 
                   <p>At the edge of the square, a man clad in brown and green lurked in the shadows. His drab clothing actually blended into the backdrop of Absalom’s Puddles District better than the pure black of his compatriots. He was bald with a full beard. He studied Ezren with a stern expression, single dagger in hand, though he was well out of stabbing range. The War Hounder could, of course, throw his blade. Or perhaps he knew some occult secret with which to blast Ezren’s mind. </p> 
                   <p>Trusting Merisiel to handle any other unforeseen threats from behind, Ezren turned to face the bald man.</p> 
                   <p>“You are, I take it, in charge?”</p> 
                   <p>The bald man waved a hand in casual denial. “I wouldn’t say that. We aren’t strict in terms of rank or command, you see? More accurate to say I’m wise enough not to be on the front line when confronting a wizard of your… reputation.”</p> 
                   <p>Ezren nodded in acknowledgment, though he suspected the bald man had no idea who he was or what reputation he might possess. </p> 
                   <p>“May I assume,” asked Ezren, eyes still scanning for the missing dwarf, “that if I were to ask you to carry a message to the oldest and wisest of the War Hounders, you could see that it was received?”</p> 
                   <p>“I’d be delighted.” The bald man looked anything but delighted, but Ezren believed his message would be delivered.</p> 
                   <p>As Ezren was about to reply, the War Hounder who’d dropped the greatsword snapped out of his befuddlement. He looked back and forth between the wizard and the bald man. Merisiel was nowhere to be seen, but Ezren knew she was nearby. He kicked the dropped greatsword toward his assailant who, upon receiving a nod from the bald man, picked up his weapon and rushed to stand beside his ally.</p> 
                   <p>“I would <em>very</em> much like to know,” said Ezren with as much iron as he could put in his voice, “what became of the papers and effects of Nessian. Further, I represent a buyer who would pay well for them, if they remain in War Hounder possession.”</p> 
                   <p>The bald man tried to look impassive, but his eyes showed a hint of surprise. Then he nodded again, and gestured for the larger warrior to head out of the courtyard.</p> 
                   <p>“I assure you, that message shall be delivered.” </p> 
                   <p>And with that he followed after the taller man, both of whom were quickly enveloped by shadows.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren smiled as he headed back toward the inn he was staying at in the Foreign Quarter. He made sure to walk slowly so he could easily be followed, trusting Merisiel to prevent further assaults. He suspected when the War Hounders attacked him again tonight, they’d bring someone who could answer his questions.</p> 
                   <p>And tonight at the inn, he and Merisiel wouldn’t be alone to receive them.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Ciravel’s first—and only—childhood memory is of tasting the stars. Peering through a window into the depths of space, innumerable galaxies stare back at her and glitter their welcome. She remembers that moment, possibilities and potential branching like fractals, infinite possibilities for infinite stars; and yet, six stars shine brightest of all. Someone hands her something sweet that tastes of honey and spices, and the world smells of citrus and the sea. Fragrance embraces her, the sweetness lingering upon her tongue—the past and the present dancing together in a shared instant.</p> 
                   <p>But before and after… Nothing. </p> 
                   <p>And then, in some time or none at all: heat, and the rain on Sovyrian’s canals.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel’s young adulthood was spent at the university, where she earned impeccably high marks studying xenobotany, while also attending martial arts and combat training. Time rarely seemed to be the issue for Ciravel “But how do you manage it all?” her classmates asked. Ciravel shrugged. “I plan well. I have to.”</p> 
                   <p>And she did need to plan. Multitudes of worlds and peoples mean multitudes of different shapes, sizes, limb configurations, and body structures. For Ciravel, it meant a body which, since birth, has been particularly responsive to varying gravities, atmospheric pressures, and other planetary properties. Some days, and in some places, Ciravel has little-to-no pain and walking isn’t a problem. Other times or places, she manages exhaustion and pain. Like many others across the Pact Worlds and beyond, using a hoverchair, or a cane for shorter distances, helps Ciravel reduce fatigue and makes moving around less difficult and painful. She trained to fight while using her chair, harnessing the thrusters and momentum to dodge and attack, conserving energy, to use her cane to counterbalance and anchor herself. Ways to minimize a bad day amongst the good and maximize a good day amidst the bad. But never knowing what sort of day was ahead meant Ciravel had to learn early how to plan for each possibility. So, she’d examine each potential outcome and prepare for each iteration until it became instinctual.</p> 
                   <p>After graduation, Ciravel’s academic success in xenobotany caught the Sovyrian leadership’s attention, and in time, she was trusted with occasional official journeys to Absalom Station. Each time she boarded a starship, it felt more like home than Sovyrian ever had. It was the end of one of these trips, heading back through the station towards her waiting ship, that she was stopped in her tracks by the smell of crisp citrus in the sea air. </p> 
                   <p>It was a scent she had all but forgotten, and in an instant, she was back in the memory of a window and stars and spiced honey. And in that moment, existing in two times, simultaneously, she understood. She could bend this moment to her needs. She could stretch time—delay her departure long enough to find the source of the fragrance. It wouldn’t last long, and it’d be exhausting, but it would be enough.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>She stretched time at the docks and compressed it nearby. Following the fragrance, or perhaps led by it, she found the source—a young woman with golden eyes and swirling tattoos that almost seemed to dance, carrying a bundle under her arm and walking quickly into a small temple with a shattered mirror on the door—the sign of the Gap Recollective. Ciravel peered in, and when the woman drew back the cloth of the bundle, it revealed a truly ancient warhammer engraved with glowing Dwarven runes. Ciravel tasted spiced honey on her tongue. The young woman looked at her. Smiled. </p> 
                   <p>And Ciravel was suddenly back on the ship home.</p> 
                   <p>Years went by, and Ciravel became the default representative for most off-planet xenobotany meetings. Her excursions were always on time, dodged inclement weather, and when her insular life among the elves caused a diplomatic faux pas, it was somehow forgotten by the next meeting. With the arrival of the <em>Idari</em>, Ciravel was invited as part of the elven delegation to the kasathan worldship. She observed adat and was awed to note that after death the kasatha, like she, exist in two aligned points in time. She befriended one of the adata, who wore a pin engraved with a circle and arrow containing a six-star constellation.</p> 
                   <p>The six stars from her memory.</p> 
                   <p>The adata explained it as the symbol of Ibra, The Inscrutable. Guardian of mysteries and miracles, of exploration and discovery and the cosmos. They spoke at length of Ibra and cosmic enigmas swirling like nebulas and questions, but eventually, Ciravel bid the adata farewell and boarded the ship to Castrovel.</p> 
                   <p>Another young woman boards Ciravel’s ship. She smiles at Ciravel with golden eyes as an unfamiliar object peeks out from the bundle tucked under a tattoo-adorned arm.</p> 
                   <p>Citrus and spiced honey and salt flood Ciravel’s senses. Time stops.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel tastes the stars a third time. And this time, she understands.</p> 
                   <p>Her memory is of the Gap. And either this woman with the golden eyes or this strange object is a link to it.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel untangles the possibilities—the present and the future, selecting a strand, tracing it forward. She knows this woman, Prindra, will lead Ciravel to the Gap Recollective on Castrovel. That Ciravel will peer into the maelstrom of the Recollective’s esoteric secrets, and someone, or something, will peer back. That they will hunt her, thinking three moves and four dimensions ahead. Ciravel unknots another time-thread and finds people who can help her, who she will help, who will become trusted companions. Ciravel knows she will become Forlorn, but feels no despair, for she will bend time itself for the friends she will make, keeping them safe on new worlds as they explore the mysteries of the stars together. Invigorated, Ciravel takes these strands and twists them together, weaving them into a new, stronger thread. Possibility.</p> 
                   <p>She peers out the window, smiling at galaxies glittering with infinite potential and adventure and possibility, for Ciravel has time.</p> 
                   <p>Despite understanding and manipulating the mechanisms of time, Ciravel is by no means omniscient. She selects the best plan based on the information she has on a given topic, and even when she knows an outcome, she still gets nervous from time to time. She also recognizes that someone may have information that informs a different option than the one she has chosen, so, while she will defend her statements, Ciravel is willing to follow another’s suggested plan. Her humor tends to be dry and occasionally dark, but she is playful and loyal with people she trusts. </p> 
                   <p>Ciravel’s insular upbringing can manifest both as ignorance, condescension, and elitism—she corrects inaccuracies, but lacks firsthand knowledge about much of the galaxy, its peoples, their worlds, and their cultures, not for want of curiosity, but simply from a lack of exposure—more than once, cultural ignorance has put Ciravel into a sticky situation. She can be impatient and often will finish others’ sentences, assuming she knows what they were going to say, and she’s usually right. When all is said and done, there is nothing that thrills Ciravel more than exploring the galaxy, putting together a puzzle, and staring out at the stars with her friends.</p>

The Broken Tusk following has survived another winter, but a new year just began, and signs of danger foretell a year unlike any before.</p> 
                   <p>Unless their newest party of scouts can secure a safe route through the wilds, saber-toothed beasts, warmongering rivals, and the ever-looming possibility of natural disaster all threaten to end an ancient people’s legacy. Will the Broken Tusks succumb to the elements and surrender to their rivals? Or will you guide your following to glory and reclaim a stolen birthright?</p>

                   <p>Hello, everyone! </p> 
                   <p itemprop="description">As 2021 draws to a close and we prepare to launch our 2022 programs, we're shaking up our popular Bounties line!</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/bounties">Pathfinder Bounties</a> are PDF adventure products that launched in 2020. They're designed to fill about an hour of play and act as an easy introduction to Pathfinder Second Edition. They can be used as standalone adventures, strung together in any order as a series, or used as transitions and side quests in between longer adventures and campaigns. While Bounties take place in specific areas, they can be used in any campaign setting. Each bounty is also sanctioned for play in our Pathfinder Society Organized Play program and is repeatable.</p> 
                   <p>So, what's changing? I'm so glad you asked!</p> 
                   <p>Up until now, all of our Bounties have been level 1 Pathfinder adventures. Beginning in 2022, our Pathfinder Bounties are leveling up! You can expect four Pathfinder Bounties in 2022, all for Level 3! The first of these level 3 bounties is scheduled to release in February. Our final level 1 bounty, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories"><em>Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</em></a>, by Michael Bramnik, is scheduled to release this month. </p> 
                   <p>Additionally, in January of 2022, we're launching Starfinder Bounties! You can expect six Starfinder Bounties in 2022, all for level 1. Our Starfinder Bounties are sanctioned for play in the Starfinder Society Organized Play program and are repeatable. Starfinder Bounties grant 1/4 of an XP and 200 credits. While they don't grant Downtime rewards or Reputation, they do offer generous credits for their length. The first of these Starfinder Bounties is already announced: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apn?Starfinder-Bounty-1-The-Cantina-Job"><em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em></a> by John Godek III.</p> 
                   <p>I hope you're as excited for the future of Pathfinder and Starfinder Bounties as I am!</p> 
                   <p>Take care, and happy gaming!</p>

                   <p>Hey there, Allie here! I’m a freelance game designer and writer with indie projects of my own but also work on games like the <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em> expansion<em> Advanced Lovers and Lesbians</em> (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: The Final Engagement — Revolution”), Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene”), and <em>Into the Mother Lands</em>. Sealord Amodjun and Iolanthe were among the first NPCs I ever wrote for Paizo. Looking back, I think I’ve grown a lot since, but they’re NPCs I’ve still got some fondness for.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me around the internet on Twitter talking about my cat (<a href="http://twitter.com/madpierrot">http://twitter.com/madpierrot</a>), Twitch playing and making games (<a href="http://twitch.tv/madpierrottv">http://twitch.tv/madpierrottv</a>), TikTok serving up GMing and game design advice (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lemadpierrot">https://www.tiktok.com/@lemadpierrot</a>), and Patreon also making games (<a href="http://patreon.com/madpierrot">http://patreon.com/madpierrot</a>). You can also check out my itch.io page (<a href="https://madpierrot.itch.io/">(https://madpierrot.itch.io/</a>) for my games like <em>HEIST</em> and <em>The Way You Make Me Feel</em>. </p>

                   <h3>Jeremy Corff </h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy, and I was thrilled to write Haigen Topkick for the <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> book. The Puddles has always been a great adventure location in Absalom, and I couldn’t pass up a chance to contribute to that dangerous local. I hope ol’ Haigen has a chance to make things more complicated for anybody who ventures into the water-logged district he calls home.</p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to find out more about other projects I’ve worked on, you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Belabras">@Belabras</a> or at my Starfinder blog <a href="https://solorunstudio.com/">https://solorunstudio.com/</a> where I post weekly homebrew Starfinder content. You can also find my work in my Starfinder adventure “Added Value,” in several Legendary Games publications, <em>Wayfinders</em> #16 through #21, on Starfinder Infinite, and in the upcoming <em>Kingmaker Anniversary Edition Companion Guide</em>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Vanessa Hoskins (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello everyone! I had the pleasure of writing The Docks and the Wise Quarter sections. The Docks is the perfect place to go to wish loved ones a "bon voyage" or check on the latest imported wares from Arcadia. There’s also Besmara’s Boardwalk for some carnival games and deep-fried foods, or The Mithril Chef for a fine dining experience where Chef Claudette Butterfoot creates masterpieces out of rare, and sometimes dangerous, ingredients. <br> If you want to get cozy with a book at a tea house, or study for your Conjuration final, or engage in book-smuggling, then the Wise Quarter is the place for you. As one of the sleepier parts of Absalom, it’s perfect for students, scholars, and library enthusiasts. Just watch your coin purse, because the Learned Guard cares more if you paid your silver letters than if someone took your coin purse. What are "silver letters" you ask? Read the book!</p> 
                   <p>Once you’ve done that, read <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/373835/Vellum--Lace-Ep-00-Moving-Day?affiliate_id=3272729"><em>Vellum &amp; Lace</em></a>, a work of serialized fiction on Pathfinder Infinite that takes place in the City at the Center of the World and explores all sorts of exciting locales.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>James Jacobs</h3> 
                   <p>A book about Absalom was one of the first things we published ages ago, and since then most of the development for the city has happened organically across all sorts of products—but mostly through Organized Play. A big part of what I worked on in this book gets categorized under the “Help Erik create text for the connective tissue” once we got started with the first (and smaller) incarnation of this book. There was a lot of connective tissue to create, but my focus was mostly on NPCs and additional locations and sidebar content. Looking back on it all, though, I think the part I enjoyed the most (and I hope folks like it as well!) was writing the various songs that you’ll see in some of the sidebars. It was tough to not go on for pages once I got going on one of them! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Virginia Jordan</h3> 
                   <p>Virginia is a life-long PNW resident who loves nothing more than beekeeping, memes about dogs, and completely useless facts about Medieval history. Having worked at Paizo for two years, their time there only fostered their love of fantasy roleplaying games. Their favorite Pathfinder subjects to write about are diseases and fae creatures, and the weirder the subject matter, the better. In their free time, they enjoy LARPing and creating props and costumes. They are also a professional photographer with a focus on non-traditional portraiture. You can find their work at <a href="https://jordanimages.com/">JordanImages.com</a></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href="http://everybodygames.net/">Everybody Games</a> and <a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> 
                   <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Legends</em>, and <em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>. Now I’m excited to be contributing to the description of the Coins, Absalom’s bustling commercial district.</p> 
                   <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to <a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a> if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                   <p>Уважаемые читатели, дожили! I’m Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may recall me from past Lost Omens such as <em>Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia) and <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> (Mbe’ke, gnolls, Mwangi Jungle, Terwa Uplands). When not writing for Paizo, I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p> 
                   <p>I wrote for Absalom fairly early in my freelancing career, and it was until very recently my largest project by far. I wrote the Shadow War section, the Petal District, and several of the NPCs, including Dyrianna, Lady Adrielle, Lord Kerkis, Lord Avid, and my personal favorite, Samel Maleagant of the Court of Black Paper (last seen snooping around Eutropia in <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>). Looking back, I’m still quite proud of the things that I wrote, particularly the Court of Black Paper (an exceedingly heterodox Norgorberite cult) and the contours of the Shadow War at large (a political struggle with genuine issues that make for some very strange bedfellows).</p> 
                   <p>I should mention that I am also working these days on a different sort of city book, <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, a rather stranger sort of city spread across seven ancient derricks in a world recovering from the Cold Darkness. Check it out at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>David N. Ross</h3> 
                   <p>I'm delighted to bring you much of the chapters on Absalom’s ancient and magical keeps and the military organizations that run them. I have a special place in my heart for the Starwatch and all sorts of spycraft. Since I can never get enough politics and intrigue, my next big project is a Pathfinder first edition sourcebook with rules supporting that kind of play. It’s called <em>Spheres of Guile</em> from Drop Dead Studios, and it's now <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adammeyers/spheres-of-guile-and-ultimate-engineering">live on Kickstarter</a>! You can also find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds">@DavidRossWorlds</a></p>

                   <h3>Shahreena Shahrani</h3> 
                   <p>Marhaba! I’m Shahreena Shahrani, a Malaysian-American educator, writer, and researcher. I’ve been contributing to the expanding worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years. I can’t tell you how happy I am that this book is finally out! </p> 
                   <p>My contribution to the licit and illicit! markets and drugs, trademasters, and guilds in the Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has been inspired by the peoples and cultures of the Middle East. From the stimulating qat cultivated on the terraced mountains of Sana’a (Yemen); to the historic Khan el-Khalili souq in Cairo (Egypt), where merchants and artisans enjoy the thrill of haggling and bartering with customers; to the night market at Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakesh (Morocco), where vendors and their wares appear almost magically with the setting of the sun; and the incredible warmth, generosity, and strength of diverse peoples. I also named one of the NPCs, Namira, after my cat! </p> 
                   <p>When not gaming, I teach Arabic and Persian culture courses, and deliver lectures/presentations on hot topics to government agencies and personnel. Additionally, I create storytelling adapted from world folklore on my YouTube channel. </p> 
                   <p>I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to email me at shahreena_s@yahoo.com. </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, friends! It's that time of year again where we begin to assemble our organizing committees for our major conventions!</p> 
                   <p>Now, we haven't done this in at least a year, if not longer, so let's talk about what that means. For our major shows (such as PaizoCon and Gen Con), we have a volunteer organizing committee that runs our organized play space. This group works closely with me, as the Organized Play Coordinator, to determine the schedule, recruit GMs, and get them everything they need to make the show a success!</p> 
                   <p>Obviously, there's a <em>lot</em> about 2022 that's up in the air. If we've learned anything from the past two years, it's that we can't predict the future. However, I want to share what our current plans are, with the understanding that they may change significantly.</p> 
                   <p>We are currently investigating running our major shows as <b>hybrid shows</b>. This would mean that we would have both a physical presence at the event as well as online offerings, featuring the same scenarios that are premiering at the physical shows. As a result, we're looking for applicants who have the ability to assist with both physical and online events. Safety requirements and all those sorts of things will be announced well in advance of physical shows, we're not ready to talk about those yet, but rest assured that Organized Play will be following the latest CDC Guidelines as well as the show's safety policies to keep attendees safe.</p> 
                   <p>Below is some specific information about the shows we're currently looking to form committees for: <b>PaizoCon 2022</b>, <b>Gen Con 2022</b> and <b>PaizoCon Europe 2022</b>. There may be additional shows added to the major convention schedule next year (such as PAX Unplugged), and if we add more, we'll do a similar call for committee members. There are some positions we know we're looking for, but we're also seeking general interest for all our shows; let us know if you're interested and what skills you bring to the table!</p> 
                   <p>Please note that joining a committee is a significant commitment; there is a lot of preparation work to do to get ready for a show, and especially coming out of two years of not having physical shows, we'll be doing a lot of rebuilding to figure out our new processes. Committee members are compensated with convention rewards as if they had GMed the maximum number of slots at the convention. Additionally, committee members who are not already Venture Officers are granted benefits for the year at the VL or VC level, depending on their position. Note that anybody is free to apply for a committee; we welcome those who are not already Venture Officers!</p>

               <h1>The Windsong Testaments: Fafnheir's Lament</h1> 
               <p class="date"><time datetime="2021-12-15T21:30:00Z"></time></p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The manuscript that follows is taken from but a single source, stored at Windsong Abbey. It is impossible to verify the authorship of “Fafnheir’s Lament”; the book in which it is contained also includes a bestiary and various tales of monster-hunting. If authentic, the lament—written in Skald—must have been copied and recopied many times over its ten-thousand-year history, potentially introducing scribal errors. Translation was further complicated when a fire broke out at the abbey centuries ago; an anonymous librarian saved the book, but not before the manuscript was singed along one edge. The damage was not extensive, but enough to make many passages difficult to read and some phrases entirely indecipherable. The edition presented here represents the best efforts of the abbey’s staff.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">The manuscript that follows is taken from but a single source, stored at Windsong Abbey. It is impossible to verify the authorship of “Fafnheir’s Lament”; the book in which it is contained also includes a bestiary and various tales of monster-hunting. If authentic, the lament—written in Skald—must have been copied and recopied many times over its ten-thousand-year history, potentially introducing scribal errors. Translation was further complicated when a fire broke out at the abbey centuries ago; an anonymous librarian saved the book, but not before the manuscript was singed along one edge. The damage was not extensive, but enough to make many passages difficult to read and some phrases entirely indecipherable. The edition presented here represents the best efforts of the abbey’s staff.</p>

                    <p>So, fresh from the First World I came, Fafnheir,<br> Burdened and brandishing the eggs of my brood.<br> Boldly I’d taken the blood of my brother<br> And the price, my penance, was the exile’s path.<br> Now on Golarion I gazed, greedily,<br> For glory and gold was mine to gather.<br> From mountains where men rode upon mammoths <br> To the Obari Ocean, none could oppose me.<br> Warriors and would-be kings both went<br> Groaning with grief into my gullet.<br> I felt certain Fafnheir was fiercest,<br> First among foes, now and forever.<br> That was good killing.</p> 
                    <p>But fat on the fear of fools, I forgot<br> The fickle future of fortune’s wheel.<br> For although the life of a linnorm is long,<br> And time toughens us like an oaken tree,<br> No royal or regent is allowed to rule<br> Longer than the law of cruel fate allows.<br> Your might won’t matter, is what I am meaning,<br> When you gaze upon a god and grasp<br> The golden age of your glory is gone.<br> Heed my history, and hew<br> To the wisdom which I have won.<br> Listen to the lament of the first linnorm.</p> 
                    <p>Millennia ago by mortal measure,<br> Veiled villains seeking vengeance<br> Summoned the Starstone from the depths of space.<br> But Acavna of Azlant, bride of Amaznen<br> Made a magnificent shield of the moon.<br> She shattered the Starstone into shards<br> And some souls were spared.<br> But gone was the glory of ancient Golarion,<br> And men became cowards crouching in caves.</p> 
                    <p>Into this apocalyptic air I ascended<br> To witness what wonder remained in the world.<br> I sojourned south, taking the swan’s road,<br> And all that my eye encompassed was empty.<br> Fewer folk than you have fingers<br> Lived in that lonely desolate land.<br> But as I approached the antipodes by air<br> Stalwart survivors began to be seen,<br> Sheltering in the shade of Mwangi’s shield.<br> Here were heroes a linnorm could hunt,<br> So down I descended, hungry for dinner.</p> 
                    <p>The trees were towering torches<br> Blazing below me, their light blinding.<br> Under that kindling canopy were helpless kin-folk,<br> Mortal men and elves, Mualijae<br> Caught in a barbarous burning. <br> Time had taught them the meaning of terror,<br> For a dreadful dragon had chosen today<br> To descend and deal devastation.<br> But the fear that filled them wasn’t for Fafnheir,<br> And my blood boiled as I wondered what bastard<br> Had the craft and the courage to steal my kill.<br> Then I drew near to dread Dahak,<br> Dealer of death and desolation.<br> Then the father of linnorms felt fear<br> For the Age of Ashes had arrived.</p>

                    <p>Dark is the day I first saw Dahak<br> Feasting on fools who howled as they fled.<br> Spells and spears he shattered for sport,<br> Shields splintered, they perished in shame.<br> Blades that breached him were, by his blood,<br> Melted to mist like ice in a meadow.<br> A Mualijae maid raised her voice in mourning<br> And the greedy one paused, engrossed by her grief.<br> She sang of centuries filled with sorrow<br> How Starstone survivors became food for the slaughter.<br> But the monster was unmoved by her music;<br> Sky swallowed the smoke.</p> 
                    <p>Many are the deaths that delvers discover<br> When they dare their descent into the depths:<br> A poisonous point in the depths of a pit,<br> Or their corpse consumed by gelatinous cube,<br> Or reduced to dust, disintegrated,<br> Or by the relentless reach of a mummy’s rot,<br> Their strength sapped as they’re turned to stone<br> By the sudden stare of a medusa’s snakes,<br> Or mauled by a minotaur lost in a maze,<br> Or by a bear with the brow of an owl disemboweled.</p> 
                    <p>But lo, this litany now must be lengthened,<br> Expanding the examples of exsanguination,<br> For dungeon delvers have new ways to die:<br> Caught and cut by the dragon god’s claws<br> Or by his bite sent to the Great Beyond.<br> A swipe of his tail scatters them stumbling,<br> Beaten by the buffet of his batlike wings.<br> And finally flames hot as a furnace<br> Brightly furious forth from him fly.<br> The fearful fools caught in that fire<br> Are fried in a flash by that perilous flood.</p> 
                    <p>Lament for the linnorm who has boasted his last.<br> Long is his life, but brief is his legacy.<br> Shunted and shamed, by Dahak overshadowed,<br> To caves in the crags Fafnheir will crawl.<br> From that darkness I’ll dare not emerge. Day’s<br> Luminous light on the father of linnorms<br> Shall not shine. And my shimmering scales<br> Will henceforth be hidden, this for my hubris.<br> Wanderers into my web will be welcomed,<br> As I break my fast on their brittle bone-house.<br> But never again by noon or night<br> Will I hunt heroes, as was my habit.</p>

                  <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Leandra slapped the screaming alarm cube and rubbed her eyes before burying her head in the pillow again. <em>Ugh, too early…</em></p> 
                   <p>A few minutes later she groaned and rolled out of her bunk, stretching as she padded her way into the communal area.</p> 
                   <p>"Oh, morning, Lea. I just drank the last of the instant. Sorry." Her overly chipper, and well caffeinated roommate held up the empty pot apologetically. </p> 
                   <p>“Nok! How could you? You knew I was pulling a double today!” The scowl she leveled at the curvy ysoki would send most others hurrying out of her way, but Nok just grinned and stretched up to kiss her on the cheek. </p> 
                   <p>“I'll pick up more on the way home tonight, promise!" She rushed out the door in a swirl of activity and perfume, leaving Leandra to put the coffee pot in the sink.</p> 
                   <p>Thirty minutes and a disappointingly lukewarm shower later (<em>thanks again, Nok</em>) Leandra stood in line at the popular coffee cart just outside Ixomander’s Throne, the Azlanti-themed casino where she was currently late for her job. She hopped from foot to foot, willing the line to move faster before Mo-var, the meticulous android running the cart, closed for their mid-morning break. Suddenly, an enormous vesk came hurtling out of nowhere and plowed into her. She was knocked onto the ground, while the vesk continued running. A willowy shirren helped her back on her feet before bolting after the vesk, shouting “Sorry!” over their shoulder.</p> 
                   <p>Leandra dusted off her dark green pants and turned to see Mo-var pulling down their cart’s shudder. <em>Damned tourists! Don’t they know how hard it is to keep this faux Azlanti crap clean?</em> She threw her hands up in despair, yelling, “Come on! I was in line and everything before those junk jockeys pushed me over!” Mo-var ignored her, and she went to give the cart a swift kick but stopped when a glint from the ground caught her eye. A misshapen piece of metal and plastic laid on the sidewalk, most likely dropped by the fleeing vesk. </p> 
                   <p>Leandra picked it up and shouted in the direction the two had ran. “Just because we live near a junkyard doesn’t mean you can litter!” She grumbled to herself about inconsiderate off-worlders and inflexible androids, absent-mindedly slipped the piece of trash into her pocket, and stepped into the casino.</p>

                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Leandra stretched she trudged out of the casino, her back aching after a grueling double shift on her feet serving drinks to increasingly inebriated gamblers. Spying Mo-var’s coffee cart—now open for the evening rush—and knowing that Nok probably forgot to get more instant, she started to wander over. Her way was blocked by a pair of local gang members (<em>True Warriors by the look of them—bunch of lowlifes</em>) diving out of the way of the wide swing of a doshko, wielded by the same vesk from earlier in the day. This time, a lashunta woman followed, her hands glowing with magic.</p> 
                   <p>“Really?” Leandra said out loud, too tired to properly process how much danger she was currently in. Mo-var, however, seemed to understand, quickly closing their cart window. Leandra was startled into action when a stray bullet from one of the True Warriors’ pistols struck the casino wall just a few feet from her. She scurried home, locked the deadbolts, and enabled the security system even though she knew it didn’t work properly. Nok had promised to get it fixed months ago.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Nok stumbled in, giggling and slightly tipsy. The security system let out a pair of weak, unconvincing beeps and gave up, but it was loud enough to startle Leandra awake from where she’d dozed off on the couch. </p> 
                   <p>“Someone had a good night.” </p> 
                   <p>Nok plopped onto the couch next to her. “Hot date with Rush! Oh, so much fun. You should come out with us one of these days! She even has a cute brother...” She chuckled, draping herself over Leandra.</p> 
                   <p>“No time. We’re short-staffed at work. Maybe next week.” She pushed her friend off her lap with a laugh. Nok was always trying to set her up on dates—when she wasn’t on the prowl for her own that is. She’d gone on more than a few disastrous outings at the younger girl’s urging but hadn't clicked with any of her suitors. “Tell you what, I’ll make us both something to eat. You need something in your stomach.” She ruffled the hair beneath Nok’s ear on her way to the kitchenette.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The next day, Leandra had another double. Midway through, her feet and back were already aching and her ears were sweltering in her fake helmet, but she kept a smile firmly plastered on her face as she bustled between tables and the bar. Needing a break from fending off the advances of the junk jockeys who had hit a prize and enduring the glowering looks from the locals determined to lose all their cash, she gestured to her manager that she was going to briefly step outside.</p> 
                   <p>She ordered a cup of her usual from Mo-var to boost her flagging energy and had barely taken a sip when her arm was jostled from behind, sending the drink flying. </p> 
                   <p>“Oh. Come. On!” She was nearly in tears as she turned to see the shirren from the previous day. A ysoki stood next to them, looking sheepish, and the vesk and lashunta were over by the casino entrance. </p> 
                   <p>“YOU!” Leandra gasped. “You owe me at least 3 cups of coffee!” She poked the shirren in the chest, whose antennae twitched in confusion. “First, you knocked me out of line, then you started that brawl in the street, and now you made me spill this one because you can’t bother to watch where you’re going!”</p> 
                   <p>The big vesk lumbered up to them. “Is there a problem?” she rumbled.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah! You and your buddies keep making me lose my coffee and I’m getting sick of it!” Leandra’s shouting was beginning to draw a few gawkers, but she didn't care. “And another thing! You can’t just leave trash wherever you want!” She retrieved the piece of metal and plastic from her pocket and flung it at the vesk’s chest. The vesk fumbled with it for a moment but didn’t drop it. Her eyes widened as she took a better look at the scrap.</p> 
                   <p>“Quig,” the vesk said, turning to the ysoki. “This is the other half of the keycard.”</p> 
                   <p>“You dropped it?!” the ysoki asked incredulously.</p> 
                   <p>“Uh, I guess so.” The vesk looked uncomfortable. She looked back at Leandra. “Hey, sorry about all this. Let me make it up to you. After all, I think you just saved us a lot of trouble.” She ordered an extra-large from Mo-var, handing over enough credits to cover the price a few times over. The android filled up a sizable travel mug with a secured lid and placed it in the cart’s window. Leandra scooped up the coffee and chugged half of it as if she were afraid it would get away.</p> 
                   <p>“Thank you,” Leandra said. “I have to get back to work now.” She turned on her heel to re-enter the casino, hearing the other four begin to chatter excitedly with each other.</p> 
                   <p>Later, she had quite the story to tell her roommate. Nok suspected the four were treasure hunters looking for a big score out in the junk, and they must have crossed the True Warriors in the process. Both of them speculated wildly as to what their “keycard” unlocked well into the night.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>The following evening, the four approached Leandra on the casino floor. “There she is!” the vesk bellowed with a grin on her face. “My favorite Aeon Guard! We’ve got something for you!” She dropped a credstick onto Leandra’s tray.</p> 
                   <p>A little wary, Leandra picked up the credstick, peeked at the display, and nearly fainted at the amount printed there. She wrapped her arm around the vesk’s waist in gratitude.</p> 
                   <p>“Should be enough to keep you in coffee for a while,” the ysoki smirked. “And when you’re done squeezing Obo to death, we’ll have a round of your most expensive booze. In fact, make ‘em doubles. We’re celebrating another successful mission!” </p> 
                   <p>The group cheered.</p>

                   <p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Jasper's Game Day's mission is to raise funds for suicide prevention and awareness. Through this, they strive to reduce the stigma around talking about mental health so the world can start treating it just like physical health. But they’re so much more than that: they’re building a community of unique individuals with a love for all things RPG. They combine the fun of tabletop roleplay with the quest toward suicide awareness and prevention, and it’s nothing short of amazing.</p> 
                   <p>One way to support them is the auction for seats to play LIVE with:</p> 
                   <ul>

                   <p>Demiplane brings roleplaying fans together to make games better, providing high-quality tools to form groups and enhance the ways games can be played, shared, and explored. Launched in 2020 by Peter Romenesko and Travis Frederick, lifelong friends and die-hard RPG players, Demiplane looks to revolutionize how people engage with and enjoy roleplaying games.

                   <p>In reducing the stigma around mental health, we want to be able to help prevent suicide, and not just respond to the aftermath. We want to bring the community together and show everyone that they are not alone!</p>

                   <p>These three holidays were first introduced by our own Jenny Jarzabski in a heartwarming short story released in last year’s <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shhy?Starfinder-Society-December-Previews"><em>Starfinder Society December Previews</em></a> blog post.

                   <p>We’ve got some great scenarios in store for Pathfinders this month as well! And, you might say, they start off with a bang.</p> 
                   <p>With Pathfinder agents spread across the Inner Sea to handle urgent problems at the Society’s lodges, shadowy enemies have decided to take advantage of the Grand Lodge’s apparent lack of defenders to infiltrate the vaults. Fortunately for the Society, it has made some new allies in recent years, and they’ve lent their cunning and expertise to bolster the Grand Lodge’s defenses. While a group of agents is preparing to embark on a mission in Osirion, the infiltrators make their move—and their leader is coming with them.</p> 
                   <p>I wonder if the new defenses are going to help repel the—<em>KRAKOOOOOOM!</em></p> 
                   <p>You’ll have to play to find out. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</em></a>, by Paizo’s own Luis Loza, is a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the four-part “Absalom arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Shattered-Sanctuaries"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</em></a> and will continue with two other scenarios in the coming months.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Meanwhile, another group of agents has learned that Venture-Captain Varian Jeggare, still a captive of nefarious enemies in Cheliax, has been taken to a secure location the Pathfinder Society has long thought to be abandoned. The site is brimming with guards and infernal dangers, and it won’t be easy for the agents to make their way in, locate the missing venture-captain, defeat his captors, and make it out alive.</p> 
                   <p>But an unexpected guest shows up as they’re preparing for their mission. A sinister guest, with a sinister offer. With so much at stake, perhaps the agents would be foolish to refuse…</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</em></a>, by veteran Pathfinder Society author Kalervo Oikarinen, is another Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the two-part “Cheliax arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-DevilWrought-Disappearance"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance</em></a>. </p>
                   <p>As a reminder, all of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenarios are part of small arcs taking place in various Inner Sea regions. The arcs can be played in any order, with any character of the appropriate level. While we recommend that you play the scenarios within a given arc in order—to better enjoy the narrative—it is not a requirement.</p> 
                   <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! Happy holidays!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Do you remember sleep?</p> 
                   <p>It is one of the few clear memories I have from before the transplant. Falling into bed after a day of dedicated study. Waking, many hours later, to Sarenrae’s gentle wingbeats stirring the sky into morning splendor. That curious gulf between night and dawn and, after its crossing, how the voyage leaves one with only faint impressions of the journey. The remnants of dreams. Not fragments, exactly, but tiles without a mosaic.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep. But when I try to assemble those memories into a feeling, I cannot. I lack some essential component. Like forgetting the melody of your wedding song or straining to see through heat shimmer. There are ancient moments that I <em>can</em> feel, of course. The blood of the Pharaoh’s oathsworn on my muzzle. The uncertainty of moving on four limbs for the first time. The strange sensation of an arcane core—<em>my</em> core—thrumming where once a heart beat, and the dried blossom sorrow of seeing myself still and quiet in the sling of an artificer’s lattice. Caressing that castoff self’s face with newly forged digits.</p> 
                   <p>I have seen so many castoffs in this place; surely one of them was you. And maybe it is you who brought me here. As I picked my way through the dusty brass halls, past conduits thrumming with arcane vitality, it all felt so familiar. Not merely because of the similarity to my own second birthplace, but because the faint reflections of this creche have haunted me all these thousands of years.</p> 
                   <p>We do not sleep, you and I, but we do something like it. And so many times, upon exiting that pale facsimile of slumber, I would grasp at shards of foreign dreams. Visions like snowflakes—have you seen snow?—melting even as I touch them. Muted cataracts plummeting through crystalline bends, thaumaturgic rivers rushing toward unseen reservoirs. Rivulets of sand falling through a vault of brass and mithral and stone, down into a craftwork cathedral whose catacombs the dream fragments would not touch.</p> 
                   <p>I know that the Automaton Council left their names within our cores. Perhaps the masters somehow carved others’ memories inside my being. Gadflies in the mind, grit in a mouthful of water—and there! Drink, another thing remembered but not felt.</p> 
                   <p>One grows bored over the millennia. What does a soldier do when they find themself without a war? With need for neither sword nor plowshares? I was not built for peace. So I sought conflict. A wasted century spent stalking our first enemies from the east. Many years more chasing the thrill of the hunt, following the moonlit metal gleam of pack leaders. I clawed crimson paths up the heaving flanks of rough beasts. I even sunk my fangs into one of the architects of Jistka’s downfall; he thought himself safe in his sarcophagus. But the empire is no more, and even when I can find others like myself, those brief reunions cannot fully replace the pride of <em>belonging</em> to a thing. Of serving something greater and knowing that that service <em>matters</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Can you turn your head? Yes, the racks there—the weapons of an ancient an irrelevant war. And ourselves, of course.</p> 
                   <p>…I am sorry, truly, that you must emerge into this world. Ah, and for my rambling. I’ve been lonely, of late.</p> 
                   <p>In any case. Yes, the visions. All around me there is evidence that those visions were indeed more than spheresong footprints. After seven thousand years, I finally ceased grasping at snowflakes and simply let them fall, observing the pattern. In the shallow waterways of my dormant periods, I sieved stranger’s gold from dreamsand, reassembling the path to this place. Across tundra and lake, through the dead god’s favored city and banished gods’ ports, and into the deserts of my two births. Over the peaks—were these peaks not taller, once?—and up to the ragged edges of a basin.</p> 
                   <p>There are peculiarities to our artificed bodies; perhaps I can show you the trick of venting life force from your limbs. Trailing arcana, I descended toward the basin floor, a vulture circling the past, the heat shimmer below a mirror held up to my aimless aeons. When I touched the sands, they were familiar. Soft and quiet as a burial shroud.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>That shroud stirred. Ghosts rose around me. A convergence of minds and memories, as something in my core resonated with the emotions permeating this subterranean complex. It must be the hopes and sorrows of all those who set aside their flesh that fixed those visions to this place. I saw dozens of figures pull themselves from the sands, amber grit sloughing off gleaming brass shoulders. I padded through the arcade of long-gone servants as they set their phantasmal eyegems on the east. Plodded toward dissolution.</p> 
                   <p>Tail trailing in sorrow, I reached the basin’s center. Something glinted beneath the sand; a garnet eye set into a dais. Carved script radiating from the gem bore the Conclave’s ancient words:</p> 
                   <p><em>We leap from flesh to crafted hope<br> To safeguard nation, family, friend<br> We shuck ourselves and start again<br> We rise anew and know no end</em></p> 
                   <p>“Know no end”—foolish and prideful! One cannot live from Age to Age without experiencing endings beyond comprehension. No, the Imperium merely filled the deathless millennia with a thousand lesser endings.</p> 
                   <p>Those fools’ words, the ghosts of my fellows. I admit, I was overcome, crushed by reminders of long-mourned purpose. I sat on my haunches and wept.</p> 
                   <p>Did they give you the ocular fire? I barely notice it, now, but that is another half-remembered echo of my second dawn, that first fulminant beam scorching its way out of my head. Like screaming until your throat is raw, but strangely distant, and channeled so <em>tightly</em> through your sight. Channel your conviction and burn away the Imperium’s enemies. Crumpled in the basin, I had no conviction, and my fire merely trickled out as molten tears.</p> 
                   <p>They splashed against the gem, and the earth also wept and moaned. Sand hissed through widening cracks and, just as your eye did, this place irised open for the first time in ages. Below was the towering vault and crystal-banked streams of liquid arcana from those fragmented memory-dreams. Vindication and wonder soothed my soul. Stairs spiraled down from the dais, and I descended.</p> 
                   <p>Down to the sanctum. No signs of battle, as might be expected given the dreaming ghosts above. An entry hall, and a pristine mosaic of the Conclave breathing life into the first core. I loped through halls of the not-dead, their superfluous forms stacked in memorial niches while their spirits slumber here in the lattices. Slowed to peer into glowing cisterns of swirling arcane energy, still ready to quicken the remnants of the Imperium’s crowning achievement. Followed the burnished ribbon of names that marked the path to this creche.</p> 
                   <p>Why did they abandon this place? No matter—we are here now, together. Memories, both mine and others, lead me to you, and to your dormant siblings. We must wake them.</p> 
                   <p>…I am afraid. Of aimlessness. Of what I bartered with my death.</p> 
                   <p>Of rejection.</p> 
                   <p>I am no Conclave. I am no pack leader. I am merely one lost child of Jistka, one aimless wanderer who followed ancient memories to an ancient vault. But I am here, surrounded by an entire tapestry of lattices, and the joy of dozens of siblings opening bejeweled eyes.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep, but I do not remember how it felt. Perhaps you can tell me? And perhaps I, in turn can help you—us—forge a new purpose. One divorced from a Conclave that dissolved before they could lead you out of the space between sleep and death.</p> 
                   <p>The Song of the Spheres fades. The Dawnflower blooms. She reaches even here, below the earth, in this cradle tomb. And for a moment, in her light preserves glimmering dreams, perfect and within our grasp.</p> 
                   <p>Take my hand.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">It’s strange how quickly a life-changing period spanning years can be replaced by what was once normal. Droven was certainly happy to be back in the field undertaking a Pathfinder mission again, and even happier to have an opportunity to deploy some of the gadgets and weaponry he’d created during his long exodus in Arcadia. He’d even lent his latest weapon, a gun that could create portals, to his partner for the exercise, a clever halfling freelancer from Cheliax who’d come highly recommended by a fellow Pathfinder.</p> 
                   <p>The mission itself was fairly simple. There were reports of a large wolf or canine monster attacking travelers and caravans on the road between Absalom and Otari, a small port town on the western half of the Isle of Kortos. It was almost too simple, and in another place and time, the Pathfinder Society likely wouldn’t have sent a veteran agent still settling in after a long and dangerous journey abroad, but Otari was home to several friends of the Society, and perhaps just as relevant, it often served as a secondary destination for shipments too valuable to the wrong people to bring in through Absalom’s more closely watched ports.</p> 
                   <p>So here Droven found himself, his entertaining companion playing a tune as they walked the forested highway on their way to Otari. As always, Whirp accompanied him, the quirky construct mostly doing what it was designed to do, staying by Droven’s side so the half-orc could readily access the tools it carried, but occasionally wandering off to examine a flower or dew drop on a leaf. Droven had disassembled, reassembled, and repaired the goblin-shaped construct countless times over the years, and he still had no explanation for Whirp’s strange moments of seeming sapience, curiosity, and self-direction. There was some magic interwoven with the clockwork devices that powered Whirp. Perhaps over the years of journeying through Arcadia, Droven’s one-sided conversations with the construct had made some impact on these arcane forces, granting Whirp a tiny spark of personality. Droven still carried on these conversations. While they drew the occasional odd look (once convincing a passing goblin to join in and look to their mechanical counterpart for a response that came in the form of an awkward hug and offered crowbar) most of Droven’s friends and peers had grown used to them and occasionally spoke to Whirp themselves.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>On the evening of their second day out from Absalom, they finally encountered the creature they’d been sent to deal with. Droven was dozing by the fire, Whirp standing at his side and staring intently at an owl perched in the branches above, when their halfling companion whispered magically into his ear from his own hiding spot. “Barghest!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven snapped awake; those years traveling on his own had sharpened his mind and reflexes. Drawing his hammer and putting his back against a nearby tree, he whispered back. “So not a wolf? Unfortunate.”</p> 
                   <p>The same calm that always accompanied moments of stress descended once more over Droven. Later, when the fighting was done, his knees would shake and his eyes would water, but for now he was fully in the moment, the fire of his orcish blood fueling his analytical mind and sharpening his thoughts for the task at hand.</p> 
                   <p>The barghest lurked just beyond the range of the firelight, its batlike ears and hunched shoulders faintly backlit by the leaf-shrouded moon. Droven made a mental note to recommend the halfling for future work; even his own eyes, capable of navigating lightless tunnels and moonless nights with relative ease, could barely make out the creature. Droven doubted he would have noticed the monster had he been on watch, let alone correctly identified it under these conditions. </p> 
                   <p>He hoped their plan worked. Whirp was to leap in front of the threat, then scurry through a portal created by the experimental gun he’d given the halfling. Hopefully, the beast would follow Whirp through the portal, putting itself right in line for a thunderous blow from Droven’s hammer. Of course, they’d made the plan expecting a creature of animal intelligence, not a deadly fiend capable of critical thought with its own repertoire of magic.</p> 
                   <p>Before Droven could propose a new tactic, Whirp began acting on the original plan Droven had modified the little construct to perform.</p> 
                   <p>“Whirrrrrp!”</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Whether it was an intentional battle cry or merely the sound of the clockwork gears rattling throughout his small frame, it nonetheless signaled the start of the fight. Whirp’s body sparked for a moment before an explosive gout of flame vented from his chassis, launching the construct directly in front of the barghest. For Droven, an eternity seemed to pass as construct and barghest stared at one another, though it was likely no more than a few seconds. With a second “Whirrrrrp,” Droven’s clockwork companion lurched away, dashing through the woods as tools clattered out of the compartment on its back. Droven made a mental note to add a leather flap to the top of Whirp’s built-in toolbox even as he pressed tighter against the tree, hoping the barghest had failed to notice him or had forgotten him chasing after Whirp.</p> 
                   <p>The plan worked to perfection. The halfling opened a portal next to Droven’s hiding spot before opening another in front of Whirp. As Whirp dashed through the eldritch opening, the barghest sped right behind it. As Whirp exited, Droven swung, his hammer whistling above the construct’s head even as the barghest’s snout cleared the portal. With a thunderous crunch, the barghest popped back out of the entry portal, its head lolling weirdly on a broken neck. Droven looked away from the barghest’s death throes, uninterested in exposing himself to another creature’s agonized final moments, and nodded to his halfling companion. A good plan, or at least an effective one, cleanly executed without injury. As much as Droven would have liked to say, “without negative consequences,” he realized that would be an inaccurate assessment. Somewhere scattered among the leaves and roots of the roadside forest, Whirp had lost an expensive and worrisome number of the inventor’s favorite tools.</p>

                   <h3>GM Numbat (they/she)</h3> 
                   <p>I started playing RPGs in the mid-late ‘70s, enjoying the original D&amp;D with its flimsy booklets and fun dice. Within a year, I was running games at my all-girls high school. I’ve played many systems over the years, though usually only briefly and with long breaks between. Partly this was because of a complex interaction of several chronic mental and physical conditions which can limit my abilities. I am grateful for the Paizo Organized Play community, where I found an accepting and welcoming home. </p> 
                   <p>None of my health concerns are obvious by looking at me. The major advantage to this is that when I have a good day, no one prejudges me simply based on appearance. The major disadvantage is that when I am having a bad day, it is difficult for some to understand, as I look “normal.” Over time, I have become better at learning my limits and predicting some of those times that I need to cut back on commitments. Still, I can be caught out with an unexpected flare and have to pull out of playing, or worse, running a game. I always feel terrible when I do, even though most of our community has been wonderfully supportive. Dietary restrictions are a challenge, especially when traveling or wanting to socialize. I catch myself annoyed by someone’s fidgeting or apparent distraction at the table and remind myself that this may be their coping mechanism, just as I have mine. We are each so individual, with our own needs and concerns, often not obvious to others. Let us celebrate those differences and the unique perspective they bring.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Ivis K. Flanagan (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Disabilities come in many forms. There are disabilities that the world can observe and recognize. There are others, though, that people fight in the dark, because the social stigma of them can be a <em>silence</em> spell, where the anxiety of the possible response is more encompassing than the darkness of suffering alone. PTSD is one of those.</p> 
                   <p>PTSD is the demon that I fight. While many often associate this fight with former soldiers or others who have been in warzones, those are not the only demons at hand. Any traumatic event can be a catalyst. This is my fight—utilizing weapons of words, medications, and therapy in the ongoing battle. I now add to these this transparency in the hopes that someone else will see that they aren’t alone. You have allies who know these battlefields well.</p> 
                   <p>Another weapon against it is finding safe spaces and friends who care. I have been able to do that through this community—the players, volunteers, freelancers, and staff who I am lucky to call colleagues and friends. This community is ever growing, and its values of inclusion, diversity, and honesty are why it is a safe space, a space I am grateful to help create, and a place where no one has to fight alone. </p>

                   <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi all! I’m senior editor at Paizo (on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/legalizegoblins">@legalizegoblins</a>) and multiply disabled, both physically and mentally. Due to hypermobility and congenital muscle issues, I have numerous joint conditions and when walking for more than a few minutes, I have to wear braces on my knees to reduce pain. This can lead to awkward questions, uncomfortable assumptions, and a sense of self-consciousness. Sticking out in public is challenging, whether it’s the braces themselves or the need to use the elevator when all my friends automatically go for the stairs. Additionally, I have a whole cocktail of mental and learning disabilities. This isn’t uncommon; comorbidity is the norm for mental illness and learning disabilities, which is why you often see people listing out a number of disorders. Here’s my list: bipolar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and dyscalculia. I struggle with feeling self-conscious about the number of health problems I face, but there’s no need to be ashamed. Disability is actually extremely common, though we don’t talk about it like it is, and many people with disabilities have more than one. </p> 
                   <p>It’s been a huge pleasure to see disability become more prominent in our games. I feel so lucky to have worked on books like <em>Grand Bazaar</em>, where I gave my NPC, Arhan Benimaya, a service dog. Disability *is* normal, and we should treat it as such. </p>

                   <h3>Dave Nelson (he/they)</h3> 
                   <p>Hey everybody! I'm Dave Nelson and I live with a handful of disabilities, mainly autism, dyslexia/dysgraphia, and anxiety. Often these "invisible" disabilities get either swept under the rug or have their legitimacy questioned. It makes it quite the uphill battle to get recognized and taken seriously. I feel very strongly that more exposure to what folks with these disabilities are actually like and what they go through will help combat these issues. So from the very start of my writing career I have tried to champion neurodiverse causes and representation as best I can. You can find examples of my neurodiverse characters both in <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> in the form of Erikanesh, or the upcoming <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> with Chun Hye-Seung. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/davicthegrey">@davicthegrey</a>, talking about my experiences, games, and all other manner of things.</p>

                   <p>Hello, I am Stefan, better known in the TTRPG sphere as Waffles from WafflesMapleSyrup LLC. I am a disabled US Navy veteran with major depressive disorder, tinnitus, as well as other depressive contributing factors such as insomnia and chronic pain. I have battled with suicide in my life and strive to have nobody need to fight that battle alone.</p> 
                   <p>I am one of the two CEOs of WafflesMapleSyrup, who run two separate streams and podcasts. I am the GM of our Starfinder show Journeys Adrift, and I play an android magus (Arc II) in our <em>Strength of Thousands</em> show, Outcast &amp; Outclassed. TTRPGs have given me a close-knit group of friends and a significant other that keep my head up and let me strive to do better in life.</p> 
                   <p>WafflesMapleSyrup strives to reduce the stigma against mental health with our platform in TTRPGs, and because of their similar standards, love to do so with Paizo. We've participated in PaizoCon streams, Jasper's Game Day, and Paizo events, among other events with various creators since we began.</p> 
                   <p>We aim to build our platform into something large enough to have the reach necessary to reduce the stigma against mental health and show that it is okay to be different, it's okay to be disabled, and there should always be a place for everyone at the table.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi y’all, I’m Esther Wallace. I GM Chromythica, a Pathfinder 2E actual play, and I’m multiply disabled. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), two types of OI (osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare bone disease, and orthostatic intolerance, which mostly means I get really dizzy when I stand up), and other as-yet-undiagnosed chronic illnesses. </p> 
                   <p>My disabilities come with frequent symptoms of brain fog, intense pain, and exhaustion. I’m still learning how to navigate as a disabled person in the tabletop community. Gaming spaces are so often not constructed with disabled people in mind; for me, it makes all the difference in the world if a GM and fellow players ask me about my access needs and work with me to implement accessibility practices. As a player, this can take the shape of GMs building in time for me to move my body or encouraging me to play online games from bed or a couch. As a GM, this frequently takes the form of my players helping me recall rules on particularly bad brain fog days! </p> 
                   <p>I created the hashtags #tabletopaccess and #ttrpgaccess as a way for disabled people to discuss our experiences in tabletop, and I host periodic Twitter chats about disability and tabletop RPGs using these hashtags.

                   <h3>Owen K.C. Stephens (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Owen K.C. Stephens. I’ve been playing and homebrewing for TTRPGs for 39 years, been a professional game writer for 25 years, a developer for 21, and a publisher and consultant for 9. My involvement with Paizo goes back to the early days of the company putting out DragonMagazine. I wrote the original <em>Guide to Absalom</em> as a freelancer, was a Paizo developer on-staff from 2014 to 2019, am a co-creator of Starfinder, and have done regular freelance work for Paizo since I left. I am also the publisher and co-owner for Rogue Genius Games, and the <a href="https://greenroninstore.com/collections/fantasy-age">Fantasy AGE developer for Green Ronin</a>.</p> 
                   <p><b>Content Warning: Trauma, abuse, and suicidal thoughts discussed in the rest of this bio.</b></p> 
                   <p>I’m a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I have Civilian Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (also known as Non-Combat PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder. I must be medicated and undergo psychotherapy in order to remain functional. This is much like having a broken leg and needing crutches—the crutches don’t let you act normally, but they do make it possible to get more done than you possibly could without them.</p> 
                   <p>Gaming, both game-writing and game-playing, have been a major source of therapy and the ability to build a social safety net for myself. Before I was diagnosed, without RPGs, I would not have survived high school. I know games are important—they saved my life—and believe representation is a crucial part of that.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me and links to my social media at owenkcstephens.com.</p>

                   <p>One certainty for me in all of this is the community. No matter what, you're all out there playing games, having a good time and enjoying our stories, I've got the table data to prove it. It's exciting to know that the work we're doing is bringing some joy to your lives. I hope that this holiday season (for those of you who celebrate), you're able to get together with your biological and chosen families, as appropriate, and throw some dice together. You never know, Grandma might get really into playing Kyra from the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! If you're looking for some festive cheer this season, definitely check out this month's new Starfinder Society release, A <em>Festive Operation</em>; I think it'll be a staple of December schedules for the next few years.</p>

                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month's digital releases, available December 15, 2021:</p>

                   <p>For those of you who have not already noticed, the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page contains sanctioning for both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>! These two books had a lot of tricky elements, especially <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and we're thankful for your patience while we sorted through them. I'd especially like to thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Mark Seifter for spending a <em>lot</em> of time with me in the week before Thanksgiving working to get them out before the holiday, Pathfinders, go forth and enjoy your new content!</p> 
                   <p>For my fellow Starfinders, we've also sanctioned the most recent standalone adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xs?Starfinder-Adventure-The-Liberation-of-Locus1"><em>The Liberation of Locus-1</em></a>, for credit, and its rules options are also available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. We hope you enjoy this new adventure!</p> 
                   <p>Looking forward, there are two Pathfinder rulebooks coming out in December: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aoy?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens: Monsters of Myth</em></a> and the long-awaited <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>. We hope to have the sanctioning for both of these ready for street date; they're a pretty light lift, so I'm very hopeful. On the Adventures front, we're also starting to work through the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</em></a>, and hope to have more to share on that soon.</p> 
                   <h2>Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfs?Nova-Qualifications-Update">Last year, we announced</a> that we’d be adding one high-level scenario per year to the qualifying scenarios for Nova credit. We intended for this to be our end-of-year scenario each year; however, in looking at the plan for this year, the final scenario of the Data Scourge metaplot is (spoilers!) a 5-8, which is not quite high enough level to qualify for our requirements. As a result, we are adding the Nova tag to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><b><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></b></a>. All previous and future runs (up to three) of this scenario will count towards the 10-scenario requirement for Nova qualification. Thanks to the VOs who pointed out this potential snag to me!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p></p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <h4>Campaign Service Coins</h4> 
                   <p>At SkålCon at the end of October, we awarded two new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #850<br> <b>Sean Pearson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #851</p> 
                   <p>It also came to my attention that we never formally announced the two recipients from last year’s SkålCon Online, so I would like to formally recognize:<br> <b>James Anderson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #840<br> <b>Tineke Bolleman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #841</p> 
                   <h4>GM Ranks</h4> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition), and one GM earned their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Idaho, Joshua Blazej<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Hilary Moon Murphy</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com .</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the holiday season!</p>

                   <p>You can also try the game directly on Tabletop Simulator on Steam. You need to have Tabletop installed, then <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663893091">go to download the Pathfinder Arena demo</a> to add it to your games. Then run Tabletop Simulator and start fighting with your friends in the Arena! You can find a fast guide to the main Tabletop Simulator <a href="https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/basic-controls/">features here</a>. We have uploaded the rulebook, plus the summary cards. You will also find the ability tokens already in the bag, according to the number of players at the table. Mind that you will need to add the extra strength tokens according to the number of players.</p> 
                   <p><b>Backers who now join the campaign</b> already get Amiri, the barbarian, as an extra hero to play with, plus four extra monsters: the hobgoblin general (level 3), the ghoul (level 1), the young red dragon (level 4), and the onidoshi (level 4). </p> 
                   <p>The onidoshi can increase its total life points by 2 (as does the troll), and <b>it deals a strong damage output in both range and melee.</b> It’s also able to attack heroes twice if they’re in the range of both attacks (as does the ettin).</p> 
                   <p>The young red dragon is a fearsome opponent that can <b>attack at 360 degrees and ignore heroes’ defenses!</b> Players would be wise to plan very carefully when to strike against it!</p> 
                   <p>The hobgoblin general brings a new special ability to the game: when it deals critical damage, <b>the targeted hero is pushed up to two tiles away</b>. This effect can lead the opponents into other monsters' range to trigger even more attacks and score more glory points!</p> 
                   <p><b>The ghoul’s only attack is a melee attack, but it has the special ability to lower the number of your action points</b> and defense through negative tokens. This is particularly effective at the beginning of the game, when every hero has only 4 actions per turn.</p> 
                   <p>A custom 8-face die has also been unlocked, along with three extra cards per each hero’s deck, including expansions and unlocked stretch goals!</p> 
                   <p><b>Seelah is also waiting in the next stretch goal</b>. As soon as she’s unlocked, she will immediately get 3 extra cards too!</p> 
                   <p>We are also releasing three social stretch goals: like and follow the game on Board Game Geek to get new Shrine Tiles dedicated to Brigh, Nethys, Calistria, and Pharasma. Brigh allows you to rotate other tiles than the one your hero stands on; Nethys enhances your magic abilities, giving you an extra spell; Calistria rewards monster-hunter heroes with ability tokens; and Pharasma adds glory points if the hero has defeated a certain number of monsters at the end of the game.</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/326030/pathfinder-arena">Like and follow Pathfinder Arena on Board Game Geek to unlock them now!</a></p> 
                   <p>The other two social stretch goals concern our Facebook group. Invite new members or join it now to unlock another extra card for each hero and the miniature of the harpy, a new level-2 monster!</p>

                   <p>These print-on-demand versions differ from the originals only in that the inside covers have been printed as additional pages in the books’ interiors (and that some are now available as softcovers for the first time), and they will easily fill out gaps in any collector’s bookshelf.</p> 
                   <p>We have more titles in the works and will keep adding more as long as folks keep buying the ones we’ve got. Make sure to let us know in the comments what out-of-print titles you most want to see available as print-on-demand offerings, and we’ll set our priorities accordingly.</p>

                   <p>Every year we have several dozen events which support charities. We developed the charity boon programs to support these efforts. We’d like to recognize a few of the events who conducted charitable activities and supported the charities’ good works!</p>

                   <p><b>Defenders of the Healing Flame, August 21 &amp; November 6</b><br> With two charity streams and many shenanigans, the team raised $6,420 and threw one glitterbomb at the OPC.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gen Con Online, September 16-19</b><br> Gen Con auctioned off boons, signed books and embroidered items to support Take This and Trinity House, raising a total of $5,886!</p> 
                   <p><b>SkålCon 2021, October 29-31, Plymouth MN</b><br> In celebration of their first physical con since the pandemic began, the community raised $4,750 for Tubman, a local shelter, and collected physical goods to donate as well.</p> 
                   <p><b>PF2e Foundry Community for Extra Life 2021, November 6th</b><br> The Foundry developers’ streamed game on their platform raised $3,567 for Extra Life.</p> 
                   <p><b>Mace 2021, November 12-14, Charlotte NC</b><br> The North Carolina community came out and raised $2,800 for the North Carolina Zoo and $3,000 for Veteran’s Bridge Home.</p> 
                   <p>If we missed your event or you want to promote an upcoming charity event, please let us know in the comments! We know there are charity events year-round that deserve the attention.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“I don’t like the look of that <em>sloop</em>,” said Daker, punctuating the last word with his ever-present sneer.</p> 
                   <p>Callum extended his spyglass and directed it at the little vessel, a little less than two hundred feet to port. Its crew scurried about their duties as the sun reached for the golden edge of the western horizon.</p> 
                   <p>“A fisherman,” said Callum, still scanning the deck of the other vessel, “returning home. Not everyone’s a pirate, Gaius.”</p> 
                   <p>“We’re in the Shackles, Orrin,” answered Daker, still sneering at the smaller ship. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re all pirates, ‘til they prove otherwise.”</p> 
                   <p>They had the poopdeck of the <em>Madam Diabola</em> to themselves, a sleek Chelish warship armed with the latest in cannon technology, each devil-mouthed barrel etched with a magic sigil which promised every shot they fired would fly deadly and true. The <em>Madam</em> was given the honor of watching this insignificant settlement’s harbor while Admiral Lecarnas and the rest of the punitive fleet sailed off to lay siege to Drenchport that very morning. Callum didn’t even know the town’s name, but he also didn’t care.</p> 
                   <p>“I grant you, she’s a bold one,” Callum answered, watching as the sloop slowly moved in their direction. “Must’ve sailed out early morning, before we sealed the harbor. We could just warn her off with a hazard flag.”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius Daker was too bloodthirsty in Callum’s opinion, even if he was his oldest friend from his Fort Gorthoklek days. Too enthusiastic with the sap when leading a press gang, too ready to—</p> 
                   <p>“Fire a bit of iron across her bow with that pretty new swivel gun,” said Daker, eyeing the polished little cannon mounted on the port rail. “And beat to quarters. Lads and ladies need a bit of exercise, to keep ‘em on their toes.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Madam Diabola</em> was one of three vessels in the fleet outfitted with the new weapons, swivel guns similar to smaller versions of the black iron cannons on the decks below, tended by scurrying halfling prisoners the crew had taken to calling “powder rats.” Gaius Daker wanted to hear the cannon roar. Callum thought such impulse foolish. Would the captain approve of such actions?</p> 
                   <p>“Gaius,” began Callum, but swallowed the rest of his words when he caught Daker’s glare. He knew that look well. Daker was senior midshipman of the watch, and his words were no mere suggestion. That dark look made it an order.</p> 
                   <p>“Beat to quarters!” Callum shouted, turning to the swivel gun.</p> 
                   <p>Sailors across the vessel leapt into action and the sound of martial drums filled the air. Callum couldn’t help but admire the artistry of the little bronze cannon, mounted on the gunwale, its mouth fashioned like a dragon’s maw, fangs bent outward. He checked the breech, pleased to find it properly loaded and ready. Captain Hecata was fond of the lash, and her newly trained gun crews knew this better than most. They tended Madam’s newfangled weapons of war well, out of fear if not pride.</p> 
                   <p>The sloop was much closer now, turning to port so that it showed Madam her broad side. Callum, ready at the gunwale, turned to look at Gaius Daker, who he caught tugging at his officer’s jacket to sharpen the lines of his uniform.</p> 
                   <p>“They’re giving us a fat target, Gaius,” Callum said, a bit of pleading in his voice. “Maybe a signal flag’ll do the trick.”</p> 
                   <p>“A signal flag, Mister Callum?” came the lilting alto of Captain Hecata as she climbed up onto the poopdeck. “Perhaps I should prepare tea for these Shackles scum while you wave silk at them? What have we here, Mister Daker?”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius, eyes alight with bloodlust and just plan lust, grinned at the captain and saluted. </p> 
                   <p>“Suspicious vessel off the port, Captain! I ordered Midshipman Callum to fire a warning shot across her bow!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum grimaced. Just like Gaius to throw him overboard if it made him shine a bit brighter in Hecata’s emerald eyes. Daker offered the captain his spyglass and she took it, rewarding him with one of her unreadable smiles that could as easily portend divine preferment as utter doom. She looked through Daker’s brass device and within a heartbeat repeated the midshipman’s order.</p> 
                   <p>“Mister Callum, fire that shot. And I wouldn’t be cross with you if that shot puts a crimson part in someone’s hair.”</p> 
                   <p>Callum nodded and turned the swivel gun in the direction the sloop’s starboard bow. He angled the shot as low as he dared—Hecata might not care if he took off some poor bastard’s head, but he did. He asked a blessing from Abadar and fired the cannon. The shot ripped a hole low in the sloop’s staysail and a cry of fear washed across the space between the vessels, announcing the sloop crew’s shock.</p> 
                   <p>A woman in a long coat came to the starboard rail of the sloop, waving both arms frantically.</p> 
                   <p>“Ahoy, Chelish warship!” the woman cried, long brown locks freed as she added her hat to her call for mercy. “We’re honest fishermen, bringing a bellyful to our little island! See how low we ride?”</p> 
                   <p>Callum noted the ship was indeed running awfully low in the water.</p> 
                   <p>“You feed pirates then?” shouted Captain Hecata with a contemptuous air, hands on her hips.</p> 
                   <p>“Nay! Settlers, eking out a life in these hard islands! Shelly is a free port, and we give no allegiance to any pirate lord!”</p> 
                   <p>“Our intelligence says otherwise,” said the captain, and Callum saw she wore that same smile she had given to Gaius. Those fishermen had best say their prayers. It was clear now where this encounter was headed.</p> 
                   <p>Callum joined the naval academy in Hinji when it became clear his mercurial father would favor his younger brother when the inheritance was doled out. He had been fed tales of high adventure on the open seas, contending with the elements and wild creatures, bloodthirsty pirates and rebels intent on bringing Cheliax to its knees. Instead, he found himself part of an instrument of intimidation. Well-armed nautical bullies.</p> 
                   <p>“There are a dozen innocent souls on this ship, captain!” the brown-haired mariner in the sloop called out across the water. “We bring back the bounty of the sea to feed hungry bellies. Men, women, and children. No more, no less. I beg you let us pass!”</p> 
                   <p>The woman’s last words were made with hands clasped together, as if offering up a prayer.</p> 
                   <p>“Prepare to be boarded,” sang Captain Hecata, drawing her cutlass and nodding to Midshipman Daker, who wore a giddy grin on his face.</p> 
                   <p>Callum looked back at the sloop, the long-haired fisherwoman, hands still clasped like a supplicant…and then his eyes caught a shimmer, as though he looked at a painting behind glass, tilted to catch the sun’s rays. A warning tingled at the base of his spine. He turned to share his misgivings with the captain, when the unmistakable sound of a cannon report, several in fact, sent him instinctively to the deck, prostrate with his arms cradling his head. The first ball struck the portside railing on the quarterdeck below, obliterating wood and sending deadly splinters in all directions. The second tore through Gaius Daker, reducing him to an ugly spray of red.</p> 
                   <p>In the next moment Callum was helping the captain up from the deck, one side of her smart Chelish uniform painted with Daker’s blood. </p> 
                   <p>“Return fire!” she roared, shaking off Callum’s assistance. “By all the tines in Hell, that’s no bloody fisherman!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum glanced to his left—the sloop was gone. In its place was a black-sailed brigantine, the iron mouths of cannon protruding from open gun ports, its main deck alive with surly-looking sailors brandishing weapons.</p>

                   <p><em>Pirates!</em> he thought as <em>Madam Diabola’s</em> new guns answered the brigantine’s attack. But it was as if the wind took the iron hurled at their enemy away like fallen leaves. Of its sixteen guns, only a single cannonball connected with their chameleon foe. What sorcery did these brigands have at their disposal? Illusion to disguise a warship? Elemental servants to carry away iron shot? </p> 
                   <p>It was then that Callum caught sight of the brown-haired woman again. He could swear she was smiling at him directly, and as if to confirm it, she gave him a jovial wave and held her hands up to her mouth to trumpet her words across the now-smoky distance.</p> 
                   <p>“Welcome to the Shackles!” she cried.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Moderator: I understand Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse is releasing its first ever premium Box edition of a Pathfinder Release. Why <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens?</em></b></p> 
                   <p>Donk: Absalom is THE iconic city in Golarion. Plus there’s danger lurking around every corner, so lots of opportunity to make the characters’ lives miserable.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Pre-sales of the Gold Edition begin on Black Friday, with 10% off to anyone who orders by Nov 28th. Did you have any say in that?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Product doesn’t really talk to marketing. There’s a high wall, three moats, and pit traps filled with trolls between us and the marketing department. Our intradepartmental memos are stuffed in the mouths of junior VPs who are exchanged via catapult nightly. That said, I don’t disapprove. </p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’ve heard the Gold Edition comes with NPC cards that can hang on the GM screen, with artwork on the front for players and roleplaying info on the back for the GM. What kinds of NPCs might we expect?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: You’ll see all the most interesting denizens of Absalom: noble goblins, brave goblins, handsome goblins and brilliant goblins. Probably some other things, too, but I really haven’t checked.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg"><img style="max-width:70%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg" alt="Absalom building mock up cards with art on one side and information on the other"></a>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><b>M: It also comes with location cards. Artwork of the building or location on front, background information on the back. We’ve never seen that before from the Warehouse. Why now?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Locations cards really help you understand where you are at all times. If you’re a member of the Pathfinder Society, that’s great for their motto of “Explore, Report, Cooperate”. And if you’re a member of the Bloody Barbers, it’s perfect for their motto of, “Bury the bodies further from the house.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’m surprised a goblin would come up with wearable faction jewelry for players. What was your inspiration?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: We take special pride in our jewelry pieces. They’re designed by our crack jewelry designers, and lovingly crafted from the fillings ripped out of the teeth of marketing goblin project coordinators. Reduce, reuse, recycle, but without the reduce part—we call that “maximizing operational efficiency.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I see. So, you included several short bonus adventures in this Gold Edition. How do you expect GMs to use these?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Our original design mandate for the bonus encounters was that they would be a short, sharp way to terrorize an adventuring party, complete with large battle maps to mark where the characters fell.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Oh, so you also include large battle maps? </b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Battles are more fun if you know where you are and what’s around you. After all, the difference in a five foot square is sometimes the difference between living to fight another day and your fellow party members looting your corpse.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: There’s quite a bit more that will come in the box that I saw on <a href="https://www.beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom">beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom</a>. How would you rate your website goblins?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: In general, our website goblins aren’t worth the cost of the oil to boil them. On the rare occasion that they actually manage to make the website work properly, we hold a party with floats and cake.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Any last quote you’d like to leave our readers with? Words of wisdom?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: If you open your windows after sundown, and if the wind is blowing just right, you can hear the screams of the mighty warehouse engines coming to life. They’re ready—nay, eager—to build something great for the Pathfinder audience, and I think the product department has really knocked it out of the park. Assuming the website goblins can keep the site up and the marketing department doesn’t go berserk and start handing the boxes out with happy meals, we should be in for a good ride.</p>

                   <p>In Pathfinder Arena you will take the role of one of the iconic heroes of Pathfinder, trapped in a magical entity, calling itself “Arena”.

                   <p>Players can modify the Arena structure by spending action points to push or rotate the tiles. By doing so, players can move opponents into a monster’s range and trigger an attack to score as many points as the damage the monsters inflict.</p>

                   </table> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b>We tried something a little different from the conventional spellcaster model with the psychic’s lower number of spell slots and strong focus on …focus... cantrips, amps, and other special powers, with conventional slotted spells filling a more supplemental role. The overwhelming majority of you responded that you preferred this approach over a conventional spellcaster approach; however, much of the feedback also indicated that while what the psychic got in exchange for this reduced spell loadout was very interesting, it didn’t feel powerful or useful enough to make up for the difference in lost spell slots. So, a major direction of change for the psychic will be to retain the “fewer spell slots” and “cantrip/amp focus” class role, but adjust the power level of the supplemental pieces so that you can truly feel like you’ve unleashed the awesome power of your mind. I’ll get into some of the approaches we’re taking in each point below.</p> 
                   <p>We also wanted to get a sense in the playtest of what you all thought of the general tone and genre of the class. This was pretty conclusive—over two-thirds of respondents said the more magical cast was working for them, so we’ll be staying the course here as well!</p> 
                   <p><b>Spells and Spellcasting:</b> A strong majority of respondents stated that they preferred the playtest arrangement of the psychic’s spellcasting and key ability scores, so we’ll be sticking to those and keeping the psychic as a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose subconscious mind gives them a thematic choice of key ability score between Intelligence and Charisma.</p> 
                   <p>I also want to call out that, as with past spellcaster playtests, the specific spells granted on the conscious minds drew only on spells we had already published, so some needed to be chosen for role (“a damaging spell here” or “a scouting spell here”) and easy understandability even if they were a little outside the theme—for instance, <em>magic missile</em> was a stand-in for a more on-theme damaging level 1 spell on the distant grasp psychic. The final <em>Dark Archive</em> book will introduce several new spells with the psychic in mind for thematically tighter granted spells!</p> 
                   <p><b>Psyche:</b> The ability to unleash your psyche to amp spells for free was originally intended to let psychics really feel like they got to be masters of focus by cheating the Focus Point caps. However, the fact that psychics had almost unlimited Focus Points took up a lot of the power budget for the class, rippling into the psyches needing to come online later and have both benefits and drawbacks, as well as affecting the power of amps (which I'll touch on next). Therefore, one of the biggest changes we’ll be making to psychic is to remove this aspect of Unleash Psyche, and then redistribute that power through the rest of the class for a more consistent play experience. </p> 
                   <p>Consistent feedback also showed that while psyches were interesting when unleashed, most combats didn’t last long enough after the third turn to make getting into the psyche feel worthwhile (meaning that much of the psychic’s power was tied up in a feature they had inconsistent access to). While we don’t want to make Unleash Psyche an “assumed first-turn action” in the vein of Rage, Hunt Prey, or similar, we do want to make it easier to do. Thankfully, with the removal of psyche’s role as a source of unlimited Focus Points, we have a lot of options for making it more accessible, as well as for adding more punch, such as effects that happen when your first Unleash your Psyche, more special abilities that happen automatically when you are unleashed, or the ability to end your psyche earlier for a single big benefit.</p> 
                   <p><b>Amps:</b> Amps are one of the major parts of the psychic, and most respondents stated that they found these options very interesting—Mark tells me that amps scored among the highest for “interesting” of any class we’ve playtested—but also that they felt weak in comparison to normal focus spells. They were! Since Unleash Psyche meant that you could amp your focus cantrips 5 or more times in a single combat, as opposed to a hard maximum of 3, those amps needed to be a little under the balance point of spells like <em>fire ray</em>. While psychics will retain their focus on amps, they likely won’t have such an outsized number of them, so we have plenty of room to now bring the power scale of amps back up.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Stuff!:</b> Of course, we always increase the number of options between the playtest and the final class! In addition to the new spells that will be added in Dark Archive, the psychic will of course be gaining new feats and choices of both conscious and subconscious minds. In honor of our new iconic psychic, Thaleon, I’ll share his conscious mind, which is called the tangible dream. This path focuses on materializing and projecting the user’s thoughts into the physical world, allowing you to conjure walls, blades, and other constructs of force (or astral thread, or ectoplasm, as your character concept fits) around the battlefield!</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the thaumaturge class. I first want to thank you all for participating in the playtest by running and playing games, posting your playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and having good discussions! In particular, the playtest was happening during a pretty challenging period for us at Paizo, and I appreciate how all of you in the playtest stepped up your game compared to earlier playtests with extremely civil discourse, keeping repetitive points to a minimum so I could keep up with all the new ideas, and just really engaging with each other’s ideas and feelings in good faith to talk about different directions. </p> 
                   <p>Overall, people really liked the thaumaturge, with a strong good feeling from the majority of players, but there were definitely some areas where it needed tweaking or rethinking, usually in a way that didn’t detract much for most playtesters but did in a big way for a small number of them. This left the thaumaturge in an interesting situation, with about as many people who were about as many huge fans of the class as the highest-ranking class we’ve ever playtested, but then that small number with especially low rankings. The great news about that is that it left a clear path forward. </p> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether playtesters would like our new vision of the thaumaturge or would prefer something more similar to the first edition occultist. What I discovered is that you really like the martial thaumaturge concept, by an overwhelming majority, and want it to remain a magpie picking up from all four traditions. However, there was a desire to make it clearer how the class fantasy works with respect to exerting your force of personality to convince the universe, as well as to add more capacity to the class’s skills so that Charisma-based skills are front and center to match the intro lore about being persuasive. The changes to Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws (see below) may help with this as well to allow better advantage of your Charisma key ability score, while freeing up a broader variety of character concepts—this will let players freely choose whether to lean more heavily on magical learning or more on making things up as you go along as best fits the character. We’ll also be making a variety of quality-of-life changes based on other playtester proposals.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Implements:</b> As the playtest mentioned, we’ll be adding up to nine implements (three each granting active, reactive, and passive abilities). Of the four new implements, one of them will be the tome (or a ledger, notebook, or similar object), a passive implement that mysteriously writes down information about everything around you to assist you. The other implements are one to let you inspire and lead your allies, one to debuff your enemies, and one that misleads your enemies’ attacks, but I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what implements those might be!</p> 
                   <p><b>Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws:</b> One thing I’ve learned from these playtests is that our playtesters tend to be our most dedicated and experienced players (and even if you’re new to Pathfinder, you are very experienced with tabletop RPGs in general). So, whenever even our most experienced playtesters think a mechanic is complicated, I think I should take another look at that. People loved the benefits for these abilities but thought they were complex, and that they sometimes had issues being tied directly to Recall Knowledge. Our plan is to disentangle Esoteric Antithesis from Recall Knowledge (with a feat, like investigators’, to pick up a free Recall Knowledge if you want that), instead just flat-out forcing your will on the universe with a check to establish a connection (I’m thinking a name like “Forge Connection”). One consequence of this is that even on a failure, you can forge a connection, but a success or critical success will give you more. Additionally, while a high majority of players really liked the playtest benefit from Esoteric Antithesis, there were some good ideas about how to open up to allow a variety of benefits to allow for more playstyles. So, we’re looking at offering multiple benefits a thaumaturge can pick from when you successfully forge a connection. This separates out the benefit where you apply a creature’s highest weakness and the benefit where you create a new weakness as two options, to handle the feedback people gave about situations where they were already applying a creature’s highest weakness due to preparation for the encounter. It also allows you to gain new benefits, for instance, when you might prefer a special buff or debuff instead of simply more damage. Right now, we’re toying with the idea of having a different connection for each implement, as some folks also thought implements could use one more unique power, and then have more connections available through feats</p> 
                   <p><b>Pacts:</b> People loved the story of the pacts—in fact, they wanted them to have stronger effects, and many wanted the option for any character, even non-thaumaturges, to gain them. We had actually planned on including similar pacts in a yet-unannounced part of the book, but based on your feedback, we also expanded the pacts into a full-on pact binder archetype for anyone to take! Opinions were pretty varied about their rarity, perhaps the most mixed we’ve ever gotten in a multiple choice question for paths moving forward, so we’ll take that into account moving forward.</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <h2>A Glimpse, A Hunch, A Flicker of the Future:</h2> 
                   <p>Hey, thanks for sticking around! Here’s something coming up in <em>Dark Archive</em>—while the book is still in development and various things might change a little, I wanted to give a sneak peek into a new type of player option coming up in the cryptids file, one of the eight casefiles of the <em>Dark ArchiveM</em>.</p> 
                   <h3>Creature Echo Feats</h3> 
                   <p>Creature echoes are a new type of feat that grant you special powers based on exposure to an unusual creature. These are rare and usually only occur after a significant event involving the creature. Imagine a town where people have, one by one, begun to turn to stone. You might spend many months tracking down the cause of the phenomena, only to eventually find it was an ancient creature with a petrifying gaze living deep under the town. However your encounter with the creature goes, the following feat might echo with you if you survive:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Stone Skin — Feat 12</b><br> Rare, Transmutation<br> <b>Prerequisites</b> You have been petrified.</p> 
                    <p>It might have been a medusa, dracolisk, or even a fossil golem; regardless of the source, you were the target of some petrifying effect, and an element of that stony gaze has remained with you, both protecting and slowly consuming you. Your limbs are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin. You gain a stone fist unarmed attack which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has the shove trait, and is in the brawling weapon group; unlike a normal fist, it does not have the agile or finesse traits. As your life force ebbs, this petrification spreads over more of your body to form a stony armor. When you have fewer than half your maximum Hit Points, your stone fist unarmed attack increases its weapon damage die from 1d8 to 1d10 and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to your Constitution modifier. </p> 
                    <p>If you would gain the dying condition, you can choose to instead be permanently petrified to avoid the risk of death. Counteracting this petrification requires a casting of <em>stone to flesh</em> of a spell level equal to at least half your level, as well as a counteract check against the hard DC for your level. Each time you recover from petrification caused in this way, you gain a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">In early 2021, Toy Vault debuted two 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle products featuring licensed art from Pathfinder. The initial two designs both featured the work of legendary fantasy artist Wayne Reynolds, who has produced breathtaking scenes of adventure and intrigue for Pathfinder since its inception nearly 20 years ago.</p> 
                   <p>The <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jq?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Core-Rulebook">Core Rulebook</a></em> design features iconic characters from the RPG, including Harsk the dwarven ranger, Merisiel the elven rogue, and Kyra the human cleric, all doing battle with a massive, fire-breathing dragon.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/edfbb4a5-f29e-4f89-85a7-2681220a0b20/WayneRSketch_CoreRulebook.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/edfbb4a5-f29e-4f89-85a7-2681220a0b20/WayneRSketch_CoreRulebook.jpg" width="80%" alt="Sketch of the Pathifnder iconics battling a red dragon breathing fire through a crumbling stone wall"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Meanwhile, <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jr?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Bestiary">Bestiary</a></em> features some more of the fantasy world’s monstrous inhabitants, including three mischievous kobolds; an enraged ogre; and a giant, menacing hydra.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/88860248-6ce1-4680-b2b7-34169ccd10dc/WayneRSketch_Bestiary.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/88860248-6ce1-4680-b2b7-34169ccd10dc/WayneRSketch_Bestiary.jpg" width="80%" alt="A sketch of a number of kobolds to the left of a large ogre with a hydra lurking in the background"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <p>When asked about his history with producing fantasy art like the imagery featured in these two puzzles, Reynolds said, “I have been working in the RPG industry for almost 30 years, with my first piece of art being featured in 1993.</p> 
                   <p>“I was working with Paizo when they took over Dragon and Dungeon Magazines,” Reynolds explained. “I was doing some cover art for them, so when they started Pathfinder, I was one of the first people they approached about providing art for the game.</p> 
                   <p>“It is exciting to be able to work on something from the ground level. My experience with Pathfinder has been massively enjoyable. I just love everything about that sort of world.”</p> 
                   <p>When asked about what pieces of art his personal favorites are to create, Reynolds said, “Mainly the iconic characters, as my specialty is in character design. I love being able to tie history to fantasy, and I always do a lot of historical research before beginning work on that type of a project.”</p> 
                   <p>Speaking specifically about his art being used to create jigsaw puzzle products, as well as how he thinks he’d fare putting them together himself, Reynolds said, “I like doing jigsaw puzzles. They are relaxing, and I think they also make for a good exercise as an artist. I am probably the wrong person to do a puzzle featuring my own artwork, though, because I already know the image so well.</p> 
                   <p>“I imagine it would be sort of like a musician dancing to their own music,” Reynolds added.</p> 
                   <p>Fans of Pathfinder, Wayne Reynolds, and fantasy art in general have made these jigsaw puzzle items two of Toy Vault’s most popular new offerings this year, and it is with great excitement that we announce two more brand new puzzles featuring Pathfinder imagery—<em>Gamemastery Guide and Gods &amp; Magic.</em></p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0294z?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gamemastery-Guide">Gamemastery Guide</a></em> once again showcases a wonderful piece of Reynolds art, this time depicting Alaznist, one of the game’s villains, ascending a staircase while holding onto an impressive-looking spear-type weapon in one hand. Towering above her is a large black dragon with giant horns, red eyes, and wings extended.</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02950?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gods-Magic">Gods &amp; Magic</a></em> features work by the talented Russian artist Ekaterina Burmak. The scene depicts the Starstone near the top, with three characters below. These three characters are Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, and Norgorber, all of whom ascended to godhood after touching the Starstone, according to official Pathfinder lore.</p> 
                   <p>These two all-new Pathfinder puzzles are available now, just in time for the 2021 holiday season. For more information on Toy Vault, please visit <a href="http://www.toyvault.com/" target="_blank">www.toyvault.com</a>.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">“Please, Dhareen, must we go through with this? A bit of rock climbing is hardly a challenge for the Castrovel Kid!” Dhareen imagined her mentee thrusting his chest out proudly, thumb pressed triumphantly above his heart as he blustered several feet below her. She smiled to herself and pushed her piston-puncher into the mountain’s side, activating the gadget with a press of her lowleft thumb.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps, but it is custom among the tribes for a Yavnii to administer a test to every hopeful Brekai wanting to undergo the Test of the Mountain, and I am afraid that not even I have the authority to make exceptions to shobhad tradition. Not even for the ‘Castrovel Kid.’”</p> 
                   <p>“See, you say that, but I can hear your grin,” Vellero replied sullenly.</p> 
                   <p>“I know not what you mean.” Dhareen grinned again.</p> 
                   <p>Both gladiators fell silent as they climbed, Dhareen pausing her ascent long enough for Vellero to scale up alongside her.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>He had taken to her tutelage well. Ka’s cliffside was grueling even for an expert; twenty-two miles long and comprised of thin basalt overtop stronger metamorphic stone, careless climbers often plummeted to their deaths after relying on pistons pounded into brittle basalt. One of the many roles of a yavnii was to ensure their breknai did not succumb to such a fate. Vellero had learned Dhareen’s lessons well thus far, scaling around several patches of basalt she had left in his path as a test.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s concentration reminded Dhareen of when she first met the headstrong lashunta in the ring at Arl’s VitariTech Coliseum. They were competing in the Icons Grand Brawl, and he was favored to win. The young man was a crowd pleaser on a seven-match winning streak. He was good, but not good enough; Dhareen scrubbed the floor with her future friend’s face. Literally. Nevertheless, there had been a spark within Vellero, a spark that intrigued her. The second time she knocked him down—or perhaps the third—he clamored to his feet with a bruised antenna and a few chipped teeth, wiped fresh blood from his lip, and grinned.</p> 
                   <p>“Why do you persist?” Dhareen had asked, scarcely winded. “You cannot win. You bring yourself only pain. Throw your towel; others have when facing me. There is no shame in surrendering to your better.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re right,” he’d replied. “But that wouldn’t be fair for the folks who came here to see me fight, and I don’t want to let a single person in this ring who believed that I could win down.” He raised his fists into a boxer’s stance, a pointless gesture against an opponent twice his size with twice as many fists. “When I go down, I want them to know I gave it my all!”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“I don’t mean to sound indignant,” Vellero interrupted Dhareen’s thoughts. “I know that the Test of the Mountain is sacred to your people, and that it is an honor to be allowed to undergo it as an outsider.” </p> 
                   <p>Dhareen raised an eyebrow. “But?”</p> 
                   <p>“But,” Vellero took a breath. “Is the reason we’re doing this,” Vellero gestured out behind them, over red dunes and rolling clouds of dust. “Because you don’t think I can?”</p> 
                   <p>“If I didn’t think you could pass the Test of the Mountain, I wouldn’t have begun the climb with you, nor permitted you to undertake it.” Dhareen’s voice was gentle but her statement absolute. “The mountain is sacred to my people. We do not tolerate bloodshed on Ka. To send one who is unprepared up the Mountain is as shameful as slaying one’s enemies at its base.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s expression softened slightly. “Thanks.”</p> 
                   <p>“Do not speak of it. You don’t want your throat to dry from the ascent.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero blinked, then burst out laughing.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. You’ll have twenty miles left when we’ve reached the end of our shared path.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero kept laughing for a minute, wiping tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Dhareen.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re—”</p>

                    <h3>Dhareen reaches for a falling Vellero in this illustration by Victor Manuel Leza Moreno from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder: Galaxy Exploration Manual.</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Dhareen gave herself no time for thinking. Before the sound of shattering basalt reached her ears, before Ka itself folded like a withered tumblefern in a windstorm, she whipped around to where Vellero was climbing even as his cliffside shifted downward, a cascade of metamorphic stone tearing free from Ka and tumbling towards the ground below. Vellero screamed as he fell, but Dhareen plucked him from the air like a corpseheron snatching a leaping spookfish out from the Irkonian Sea. Dhareen didn’t speak Ysoki, but she had spent enough time around ratfolk gladiators at VitariTech to recognize the lashunta lambasting the situation with at least six of the fourteen different Ysoki swears that she knew.</p> 
                   <p>“Hold on, Vellero!” Climbing down wasn’t an option; a rockslide was eminent, and the best place to be during a rockslide was above it. Vellero was much smaller than she and less experienced at climbing, he would only slow them down. She could climbe faster with all four of her muscled arms free, anyway. There was only one option remaining. </p> 
                   <p>Hoisting the Castrovel Kid onto her shoulders like a mother giving a youngling a backride, she placed the much smaller lashunta onto her shoulders and started climbing as fast as she could, giving only the barest of warnings. “Hold tight!”</p> 
                   <p>Though Dhareen could hear Vellero shouting, her intense focus and the earsplitting sounds of portions of the rock wall sloughing off afforded her no opportunity to comprehend him. She climbed as quick as her body would allow, muscles aching and flaring as she abandoned her piston-punch and climbed barehanded. She knew full-well that the smallest mistake would send both she and her friend to their doom.</p> 
                   <p>Ten yards from the top.</p> 
                   <p>Five.</p> 
                   <p>She was going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>She and Vellero were going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>Then her world shook as shadow overtook her vision. A boulder dislodged from above, tumbling towards her, threatening to crack her skull and send Dhareen and her breknai tumbling miles to their death. She refused to close her eyes; she would greet the Lady of Graves with firsthand tales of how she died. She was not alone; at the peak of her vision, she saw a small lashunta arm, no bigger than that of a shobhad child’s, reach out as if to catch the boulder. Dhareen admired Vellero’s bravery one last time.</p> 
                   <p>The boulder collided with Vellero, and for a moment it was like watching a diver plunge into a serene pool. Vellero’s hand, then his arm, and then both their bodies plunged into the boulder. </p> 
                   <p><em>Was it just an illusion?</em></p> 
                   <p>Fine dust covered Dhareen as the boulder passed through her. From within, she watched the metamorphic rock splinter and crack in flight, first into smaller boulders, then into stone and pebbles, and finally into dust. The boulder never touched them; it dissolved before it even struck the Castrovel Kid’s hand.</p> 
                   <p>Dhareen was stunned at first. But with safety just a few yards above and Ka continuing to shake and splinter, the feeling passed quickly as she bellowed at her peculiar friend.</p> 
                   <p>“That, Vellero! Keep doing that!”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">On the occasion of Transgender Awareness Week, we at Paizo want to reaffirm our support for our transgender colleagues, creators, and community members. We recognize that we've not always been there for our trans community members. While things are rough now, we as a company are dedicated to improving and providing a safe space for all gamers—especially trans gamers—to play, create, and be part of a thriving community where they are not only welcomed but celebrated.</p> 
                   <p>We felt that this year, we shouldn’t place additional emotional labor upon our trans staff, creators, and community to contribute to a blog for Trangender Awareness Week. Rather, we wanted to address the issue of transphobia on our forums.</p> 
                   <p>Many members of the community have noted a high amount of homophobic and transphobic posts recently. Let us be clear: these hateful posts are not okay under any circumstances, and those who make them will be faced with <b>permanent suspension</b> from the forums. Though our customer service department is doing their best to keep watch and address moderation flags, it’s clear that the volume of moderation needed on the forums in the last few months has meant that the team sometimes takes more time than usual to moderate a thread. </p> 
                   <p>Transphobia is serious and removing it from the forums should take precedence over other more routine moderation tasks. Therefore, if you need to report transphobia on the forums, please don’t hesitate to contact customer service directly by email at customer.service@paizo.com with INTOLERANCE in the subject line. Any such hate will be dealt with swiftly and incur a permanent suspension.</p> 
                   <p>While we realize that combatting discrimination is an ongoing process and this is only a small step, we hope that it can begin to make our community forums a place where all members of our community feel welcome, and more importantly, safe.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you to our trans community members and other allies who have pushed us to be better recently. We hear you, we value you, and we will continue to improve ourselves, our games, and our community to earn back the trust we’ve lost. It’s hard to admit that we haven’t been living up to our values, but it’s the right thing to do, and we can’t move forward without doing so.</p> 
                   <p>Please also consider donating to nonprofits benefiting and supporting the trans community—members of our staff recommend <a href="http://www.tgijp.org/" target="_blank">TGI Justice Project</a> and <a href="https://ingersollgendercenter.org/">Ingersoll Gender Center</a>, though there are many great organizations doing the work that would value your contribution.</p>
