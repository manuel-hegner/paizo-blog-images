  \ Come From?</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, September 24, 2008</p> \n  \
  \ <p>In the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\">Second Darkness\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, we knew we wanted to use the drow as the primary antagonists.\
  \ And of course, where there's drow, there's driders. Yet with the changes to drow\
  \ society in Golarion (and in particular who and what they worship) versus their\
  \ classic representation in the game, the genesis story for driders had to change.\
  \ This gave us a pretty interesting bit of new flavor for both driders and drow.</p>\n\
  \   <p> </p>\n   <p>In (under?) Golarion, driders are not punishments meted out\
  \ by the gods. They are punishments meted out by the drow themselves. One noble\
  \ family of drow, House Parastric, has maintained their power due to their possession\
  \ of a powerful secret—the art of fleshcrafting. On one level, this art lets a drow\
  \ use various poisons to reshape parts of the body, granting a soldier large claws\
  \ or a poisonous bite, for example, or a scout antennae so he can navigate even\
  \ more easily in the dark. Yet this is just the beginning, for the drow of House\
  \ Parastric also developed a method to reshape an entire creature—this is known\
  \ as fleshwarping, and those that survive the painful and humiliating process are\
  \ known as fleshwarps. Every race put through the process emerges as something different—\
  all troglodytes come out as hulking behemoths; all surface elves emerge as twisted\
  \ deformed monsters; all halfings come out as skittering quadrapedal beasts, and\
  \ so on. But it was the drow themselves who proved the most impressive subjects\
  \ for fleshwarping, for all drow that undergo the process emerge as driders.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In drow society, driders are seen as freaks and mutants. Becoming a drider\
  \ is not prestigious—it's physical proof of punishment and a brand of shame. Yet\
  \ driders are not frail or helpless fleshwarps; they're powerful creatures in their\
  \ own regard. As a result, in drow society driders are often kept as guardians,\
  \ soldiers, or bodyguards. Retaining little of their previous life's memories, most\
  \ driders serve their drow lords and ladies without question. But not all of them.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Female driders in particular are more headstrong and aggressive, just\
  \ as with the drow themselves. Most drider rebellions are instigated by a female,\
  \ and today there are numerous small tribes of driders dwelling in the remote corners\
  \ of the Darklands, free from drow rule. The majority of driders one sees in drow\
  \ cities are male, as a result. And fortunately for those drow, it's real easy to\
  \ tell them apart. Female driders retain their sleek, beautiful, and elven shapes\
  \ above the waist; below, their spider bodies are similarly sleek and smooth. Males,\
  \ though, are much more bestial. Their faces are a horrific blend of drow and spider,\
  \ and their bodies are spiny and rough. Pictured here are examples of the sexual\
  \ dimorphism driders present, a female illustrated by Ben Wootten and a male illustrated\
  \ by Concept Art House.</p> \n   <p>In <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tq\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #16</a>, we present \"Abominations of the Drow,\" an article that discusses both\
  \ fleshcrafting and fleshwarping so that if your PCs stumble into the hands of the\
  \ drow of House Parastric, you'll know what kinds of things they'll have to look\
  \ forward to.</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
