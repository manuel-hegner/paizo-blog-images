  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 26, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Today is a crazy busy day at Paizo, as\
  \ the entire staff works to finalize the last little details of nearly a dozen books,\
  \ all within a week of being shipped off to the printer so that we can get them\
  \ to you in time for Gen Con Indy in August. It's our last chance to make sure these\
  \ books are absolutely perfect in every detail. As a celebration of our meticulous,\
  \ lawful activities, I've decided to dedicate today's Pathfinder Battles preview\
  \ blog to devils.</span></p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a> includes plenty of lawful evil fiends,\
  \ especially in the later installments when the devil-binding nation of Cheliax\
  \ enters the fray to do battle with the player characters. As such, the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder Battles figures\
  \ contains a nice handful of devils ready for use on your tabletop.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-SentinelDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-SentinelDevil_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is the hated Sentinel Devil, a\
  \ barbed inhabitant of the Nine Hells tasked with guarding the plane's most deadly\
  \ prisoners. From time to time, wicked spellcasters summon Sentinel Devils to the\
  \ Material Plane, where they make great adversaries (and effective guardians). The\
  \ Sentinel Devil is a common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \  <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-GreaterHostDevil.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-GreaterHostDevil_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Greater Host Devil, first introduced\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy8a6f\">Book of the Damned Volume 1: Princes of Darkness</a>.\
  \ These warlike devils are tasked with retrieving souls for their infernal masters\
  \ in the court of Hell, and when they venture into the Material Plane, they generally\
  \ do so in large numbers. Accordingly, we've slated the Greater Host Devil in the\
  \ common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-DrowningDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-DrowningDevil_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>What is there to say about the Drowning Devil, first\
  \ introduced in <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmg\">Pathfinder 60: From Hell's Heart</a>,\
  \ the stunning conclusion to the Skull&amp; Shackles campaign? Weighing in at 600\
  \ pounds, this CR 8 fiend freely travels the waterways of Hell, spreading infernal\
  \ designs as far as Golarion and beyond. A truly stunning figure in one of the most\
  \ garish paint schemes imaginable, this guy definitely calls attention to himself\
  \ as a fearful foe. Just like bees and venomous snakes, you've got to watch out\
  \ for the bright-colored ones. The Drowning Devil is on the Large side of Large,\
  \ and he's slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <p>And with that, I've got to\
  \ get back to work on our Gen Con releases before the project management devils\
  \ here at Paizo pull me away into a lake of fire!</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted plastic figures releases\
  \ this summer. <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Set up an ongoing subscription</a>\
  \ today to make sure you don't miss a single figure!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
