  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“To the left!”\
  </p>\n      <p>“His stomach’s open!”</p>\n      <p>“Pin him down, pin him down!”\
  </p>\n      <p>The basher arcade was filled with battle cries and frenzied advice\
  \ from spectators as servers smoothly weaved between groups with cheap drinks for\
  \ their patrons. Students from all over the city crowded every corner, cheering\
  \ and booing each game’s combatants. Soo-jin took a long sip of tea, wincing at\
  \ the strong aftertaste as onlookers shouted at the small figures projected in the\
  \ middle of their table.</p>\n      <p>“Get him!” one of the boys from Sage Plum\
  \ Academy cried as an alley basher kicked her opponent in the head. “To the right,\
  \ to the right!”</p>\n      <p>The tiny figures clashed again, fists flying as their\
  \ players maneuvered them to victory. Nga’s eyes were locked onto the projections\
  \ as she rolled her fighter into a defensive position, raising his arms to shield\
  \ his chest. Her opponent grinned, his hands deftly moving levers while his fighter\
  \ pressed in with punches and kicks.</p>\n      <p>Soo-jin watched the brawl with\
  \ gritted teeth, waggling her fingers nervously. One boy’s eyes met hers and he\
  \ pointed a finger at the <em>SPELLS ARE CHEATING </em>sign; irritated, Soo-jin\
  \ raised her hands and pointedly showed they were free of magic auras before setting\
  \ them on the table.</p>\n      <p>The opposing fighter grabbed Nga’s by the waist.\
  \ Soo-jin’s nails now clacked against the table in a nervous drum beneath the frenzied\
  \ shouts for a finishing blow. With a smirk, Nga flipped a lever, and her fighter’\
  s elbow smashed downward, his leg swooping up into a powerful kick. There was a\
  \ shout—a blare of music—and Soo-jin jumped so fast her chair fell over.</p>\n \
  \     <p>Nga beamed triumphantly as the Sage Plum boy groaned, his friends laughing\
  \ and sighing at his loss. Nga’s tiny fighter raised his fist, roaring silently\
  \ in victory, and illusory fireworks exploded across the table to illuminate expressions\
  \ of both dismay and glee around the table.</p>\n      <p>“Pay up, all!” Soo-jin\
  \ laughed. Groans echoed above the victory music, followed by the clink of coins\
  \ falling into her purse as she collected her friend’s winnings. Another round was\
  \ suggested and a new challenger was already settling into the open seat, cracking\
  \ their knuckles dramatically as the battle music started back up. Soo-jin cast\
  \ a quick cantrip over the purse, checking the total, before nodding a quick farewell\
  \ to the other students and following Nga toward the exit.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ heavy scent of cheap tea and fried snacks gave way to the aroma of hot buns and\
  \ saucy chicken. The sun was bright outside the basher arcade, the shouts of stall\
  \ vendors replacing the cheers of students. Tired laborers grumbled about the lack\
  \ of progress on the Surepath highway while young children ran past, yelling about\
  \ spotting a sundaflora in the gardens. A girl from Soo-jin’s cram school waved\
  \ politely from a shop known for its buns; Soo-jin awkwardly waved back, trying\
  \ and failing to remember anything except that the girl had a duck as a familiar.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Nga and Soo-jin walked leisurely to their usual kopi-tiam, greeting Uncle\
  \ Moon as the smell of coffee wafted toward them. Uncle Moon shouted a greeting\
  \ back, merrily flipping hot taiyaki from a pan into a wax paper bag. Momo slept\
  \ peacefully on the counter, purring with one small paw curled protectively over\
  \ a copper piece.</p>\n      <p>“May I take your order?” a short tengu server asked\
  \ as they sat down.</p>\n      <p>“Two taiyaki, one Xa Hoi coffee, and—” Soo-jin\
  \ looked over the menu, and something newly added distracted her from her usual\
  \ order “—one sparkle tea, please.” The server nodded and shuffled off, stopping\
  \ to check on another customer. Soo-jin added the day’s total to a column in her\
  \ notebook. “We’re so close, Nga. Just a few more silver pieces and we’re set!”\
  </p>\n      <p>“I’m getting paid for tutoring on Moonday, so you can add that to\
  \ our current amount.” Nga accepted the arriving tray from the server and took a\
  \ leisurely sip of coffee. “You know, if <em>you </em>would take up tutoring—”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“I would rather let Mogaru eat me.” Soo-jin looked out the window. It\
  \ hadn’t been that long since the giant monster’s attack, but she could scarcely\
  \ see the water for all the bamboo scaffolding that had sprouted up in the aftermath.\
  \ The city would be back, bigger than ever, in no time.</p>\n      <p>“Come on!\
  \ Everyone wants a Willow Branch student to teach their kids, you’d make enough\
  \ money for a concert ticket after a week.”</p>\n      <p>“You’re just as good as\
  \ any twig,” Soo-jin scoffed, biting into her taiyaki and regretting it immediately\
  \ as piping hot red bean paste scalded her mouth. She gasped, huffing desperately\
  \ to try and cool down. Momo opened a judgmental eye from the counter. “You should\
  \ try to test into another school.”</p>\n      <p>“As much as my parents would love\
  \ for me to become a ‘twig,’ I’d rather be the best where I am than become average\
  \ at a fancy academy.” Nga took a smug sip. “Unlike you, I’m in the top ten in my\
  \ class.”</p>\n      <p>“Well, Miss Top Ten, keep up the good work and we’ll get\
  \ our concert tickets in no time.”</p>\n      <p>Soo-jin’s eyes swept past Nga’\
  s head to the wall of advertisements behind her, lingering on a poster announcing\
  \ the upcoming Shining Crystal Muses concert in celebration of Harmonious Spring.\
  \ Vivid ink paintings of the four Muses reached out to a prism floating above them,\
  \ enchanted pigments creating tiny flecks of rainbow light that danced across the\
  \ poster. Even in an ink portrait, Haru’s handsome face stood out, smiling coyly.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Goka had everything—peoples and food and buildings and magic from everywhere\
  \ on the continent—but the one thing it had that Soo-jin cared about more than all\
  \ of that was the Shining Crystal Muses. In only two weeks, she was going to meet\
  \ Haru in person. It was a shame the concert hall wasn’t in its full splendor, as\
  \ the authorities had foolishly deemed it lower priority for reconstruction.</p>\n\
  \      <p><em>What if that kaiju comes back? </em>Soo-jin’s mother had fretted,\
  \ but if Mogaru inconvenienced the city at the most important moment of her life,\
  \ Soo-jin would personally put the kaiju down and no one could stop her. She smiled\
  \ back at the poster, sipping her sparkle tea as worries of exams slipped out of\
  \ her mind, and she focused on what really mattered: supporting her favorite band.</p>\n\
