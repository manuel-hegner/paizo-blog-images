  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>The Perfumer's Apprentice</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Kevin Andrew Murphy</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: The Scent of Honeysuckle</h2> \n\
  \   <p>The hag or ogre wife or whatever she was stepped into the room, still looking\
  \ like a sweet grandmother with her knitting bag and little spectacles. Then she\
  \ saw the dead spider lying on the hearthrug.</p> \n   <p>She screamed in horror,\
  \ rushing over. “You fiendish little pig! What have you done?” She picked up the\
  \ corpse. “My baby! My poor precious one! Speak to me!”</p> \n   <p>Her knitting\
  \ bag fell to the floor, Norret’s glove on top. While I was frozen with fear, my\
  \ spirit wasn’t. It grabbed the glove and pulled it on.</p> \n   <p>The unicorn’\
  s jewel shone on the back, glowing with ruby light.</p> \n   <p>But I wasn’t the\
  \ only one using more hands than he rightfully should. “Oh no, none of that,” snapped\
  \ Madame Eglantine. Just like she sometimes seemed to have more eyes, she now definitely\
  \ had more arms. While two were cradling the dead spider, two more appeared and\
  \ wove a magic pattern in the air. Then I was looking at not one Madame Eglantine\
  \ but five, each as monstrous as the last.</p> \n   <p>I swung the poker at the\
  \ nearest one and she shattered like a soap bubble. The rest laughed mockingly like\
  \ a chorus of schoolgirls. My spirit swung at another. The glove’s jewel blazed\
  \ with light as that illusion vanished as well.</p> \n   <p>“What are you, you horrid\
  \ brat?” snarled the three remaining Eglantines. “A sorcerer? An oracle? Some halfling\
  \ wizard masquerading as a child?”</p> \n   <p>I swung again, but missed. “I’m the\
  \ one who’s going to stop you, you cannibal witch!”</p> \n   <p>A ghostly wind began\
  \ to blow. The cobwebs fluttered and another bell jar toppled from the mantel, its\
  \ head bowling across the floor.</p> \n   <p>“Oh, I’m not the cannibal,” laughed\
  \ Madame Eglantine. “I have never eaten my own kind. All my husbands were human,\
  \ and while I ate every last one after he violated my private sanctum, the only\
  \ true cannibal here is you...”</p> \n   <p>As she said this, she became fatter\
  \ and squatter, her body becoming more hunched and spidery, until all that was left\
  \ was a garden spider the size of a woman, a cross-shaped marking on her back big\
  \ enough to protect a wedding cake from a whole troop of dancing pixies. It was\
  \ the mother of the horrible little spider I’d killed, mirrored three times, moving\
  \ around one another like walnut shells shuffled by a charlatan hiding a pea.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I screamed and ran at them, hitting one with the poker while my spirit\
  \ swung at another. The illusion before me popped on contact with the iron bar,\
  \ but my spirit felt the glove slap the spider’s flesh, burning it, antitoxin meeting\
  \ toxin.</p> \n   <p>Madame Eglantine hissed and reared. Then the sound of ladylike\
  \ laughter issued from her horrible spidery maw and webbing shot from her abdomen,\
  \ a great net like you’d throw to snare songbirds for a pie, thick and sticky as\
  \ bird lime.</p> \n   <p>It covered me and I was stuck fast, both me and the fireplace\
  \ poker, her web pulling taut against the walls as it dried. But my spirit’s hand\
  \ was still free and I slapped at her again with the glove.</p> \n   <p>The last\
  \ illusion vanished with a flare of ruby light. Then the spider shifted back to\
  \ the form of the spider-armed woman. She reached into her bag and drew forth one\
  \ of her knitting needles, ebony capped with silver. She waved it about like a wand,\
  \ weaving magical patterns in the air and clicking her tongue like a Mwangi witch\
  \ out of a story. A gray ray shot from the tip, hitting the glove.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ light of the unicorn’s jewel died, the spider woman smothering its good Galtan\
  \ magic with her evil foreign spell. I felt my soul’s hand slapped back as the glove\
  \ fell to the floor.</p> \n   <p>She picked the glove up with the tip of her knitting\
  \ needle as if it were a dead rat. “Just what are you?” She flipped the glove into\
  \ her knitting bag, stuffing it down to the bottom with the wand. “I’m curious to\
  \ find out...”</p> \n   <p>She shifted back to the form of the giant spider. Then\
  \ she crawled over me, her huge bloated mass avoiding the sticky strands the web.\
  \ She leaned close, her horrible fangs dripping venom, and bit me.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ felt pain, and then nothing, the poison numbing, putting my limbs to sleep and\
  \ freezing them, like when you wake from a nightmare but still can’t move.</p> \n\
  \   <p>But the nightmare was not over. The spider woman tenderly, carefully, bit\
  \ through the strands holding me on the left and the right. She freed the fireplace\
  \ poker and threw it to the floor. Then she put her claws on me and began to spin\
  \ me, like a woman twirls a drop spindle. Webbing flew from her abdomen, smooth\
  \ and soft as silk, wrapping around me, cocooning me as she had Norret.</p> \n \
  \  <p>At last she stopped spinning me. I was terribly dizzy, but my eyes focused\
  \ as she turned back into a woman. But not all the way. She still had eight eyes\
  \ and six arms. Then the most horrible thing—her bottommost pair of arms reached\
  \ into her bag, pulled out a half-finished stocking, and began to knit as if nothing\
  \ were odd at all.</p> \n   <p>“Now what are we going to do with you, Orlin?” she\
  \ mused. “You’re a bit young for husband material, though your brother’s comely\
  \ enough, if a trifle thin.” She poked Norret’s middle with one long-fingered hand.\
  \ “Yes, too thin for my tastes. But I’ll plump him up once I have the right charms\
  \ brewed...”</p> \n   <p>She picked up the two heads tumbled on the floor, placing\
  \ them back on the mantel. Norret moaned. Madame Eglantine paid no mind. She looked\
  \ into her bag and selected a different knitting needle. She mumbled a charm and\
  \ waved it over a pile of broken glass. Half the pieces flew up and reformed into\
  \ a bell jar. She repeated the charm and the other was restored as well.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Norret opened his eyes halfway and saw me. “Orlin...” he whispered. “Her\
  \ bag... bottle... spiderbane...”</p> \n   <p>He was delirious, but my body was\
  \ paralyzed by poison, and my spirit as well. A fine time for it to be properly\
  \ tethered to my body.</p> \n   <p>But I was not the only spirit about. While I\
  \ couldn’t feel my jaw, I could sense it opening. “Rhodel...” I croaked.</p> \n\

  \   </div> \n   <p>Madame Eglantine fussed with her dead husbands’ hair and so didn’\
  t see the knitting bag behind her tip on its side. One by one the balls of yarn\
  \ rolled out, as if an invisible kitten were investigating them. She replaced one\
  \ of the jars as Norret’s glove appeared, the unicorn’s jewel still dead from the\
  \ spell. Then as the second jar was being replaced, a crystal flask rolled free.\
  \ Pretty and faceted, it was a treasure that once belonged to the duchess of Dabril.\
  \ It was filled with a golden liquid.</p> \n   <p>“There, much better.” Madame Eglantine\
  \ looked at her husbands’ heads, now back in their places. Then she looked mournfully\
  \ at the dead spider. “Poor little dear. I’ll have to put her in the garden and\
  \ plant a fruit tree. Maybe a sour cherry.” She turned. “That would be nice, wouldn’\
  t it?”</p> \n   <p>Then she saw the bottle floating up.</p> \n   <p>She dropped\
  \ both the dead spider and the half-finished sock as she sprang forward, grabbing\
  \ the flask with all her hands before Rhodel could work the stopper free.</p> \n\
  \   <p>“Oh, tricky,” she said admiringly. “Very tricky. But not tricky enough. Your\
  \ brother said this held my doom, but he talks too much. I got the jump on him,\
  \ and the same with you, Orlin. But I do wonder what it is. A poison for spiders,\
  \ perhaps? Maybe some grand mithridate like the glove, or an antivenin to sour my\
  \ venom in its sacks? I suppose I—”</p> \n   <p>A girl appeared next to her, a beautiful\
  \ young woman dressed in the livery of a page of House Devore.</p> \n   <p>“Who\
  \ are you?” asked Madame Eglantine, shocked.</p> \n   <p>“Death,” replied Rhodel.\
  \ She ripped the bottle from the spider woman’s hands with the strength only the\
  \ dead could possess and pulled the stopper free. “Never trouble a child of Dabril!”\
  \ She threw the contents into the witch’s face.</p> \n   <p>Rhodel disappeared,\
  \ the empty bottle and stopper clattering to the floor as Madame Eglantine screamed,\
  \ clawing her eight eyes with all six hands. Then she stopped screaming as the room\
  \ became filled with the overwhelming scent of honeysuckle.</p> \n   <p>“Perfume?”\
  \ Madame Eglantine gasped. “<i>Perfume?</i> That’s all you have?” She exploded into\
  \ gales of laughter. “Oh, that’s rich! That’s the cream of the jest! Two riddles\
  \ solved for the price of one! You, my child, are nothing more than a baby bone\
  \ oracle! And your brother? Not even an alchemist! A mere puffer who thought to\
  \ bluff me with a bottle of perfume!”</p> \n   <p>With that, the windows began to\
  \ spring open, one by one, the cobwebs ripping free as Rhodel let in the fresh air\
  \ of the garden outside.</p> \n   <p>The fresh air—and the wasps and bees from the\
  \ garlands of eglantine that hung about the house.</p> \n   <p>Madame Eglantine\
  \ screamed as the insects swarmed her, stinging her as she shifted into her monstrous\
  \ spider form. She sprayed webbing as quickly as a magician conjures scarves, but\
  \ still more came, drawn by the pure scent of honeysuckle absolute.</p> \n   <p>Then\
  \ came a droning buzz loud enough to be a roar. Bumblebees the size of lapdogs and\
  \ wasps the size of small ponies came through the windows, the pets of Calistria,\
  \ goddess of trickery and vengeance.</p> \n   <p>The spider woman played her own\
  \ tricks, multiplying her form with one illusion, turning herself invisible with\
  \ another. But the swarm was too great for the decoys to last, and the scent of\
  \ Norret’s perfume unerringly guided the wasps to their prey. Madame Eglantine was\
  \ stung again and again, until at last she was as paralyzed as Norret and I, trapped\
  \ as a bloated spider with a woman’s head.</p> \n   <p>It was then that the wasps\
  \ did as they always do when they win a battle: They returned to their nest with\
  \ their prey, as well as the bodies of their fallen comrades—for to a wasp, meat\
  \ is meat—and any other meat they can find.</p> \n   <p>The corpse on the table\
  \ was carried off. The heads of Madame Eglantine’s husbands as well. Even the slab\
  \ of half-smoked man-bacon from the hook at the back of the hob.</p> \n   <p>Lastly,\
  \ the wasps looked at Norret and myself, still paralyzed and caught in the spider’\
  s webs. They bit us free, picked us up in their claws, and carried us back to the\
  \ nest as well.</p> \n   <p>Meat is meat, after all.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p> Fortunately for us, their nest was the\
  \ temple of Calistria, and Mistress Philomela knew us.</p> \n   <p>We were cut free\
  \ from the webs with Calistrian daggers, had the poison neutralized with one spell\
  \ and our wounds healed with another.</p> \n   <p>There was no balm for the horrors\
  \ I’d seen save holding my brother’s hand. I knew he must have seen worse during\
  \ the wars, and I understood why he had to bring me back.</p> \n   <p>Family is\
  \ worth more than any gold, even if you come back wrong.</p> \n   <p>“Gingerbread?”\
  \ offered Mistress Philomela. We were back on her balcony, sitting beside each other\
  \ on the yellow divan. She held out a plate. On it were three gilded figures: a\
  \ wasp, a dagger, and a beautiful elven woman.</p> \n   <p>I took the dagger. I\
  \ didn’t want to have anything to do with cannibalism, even in the form of gingerbread.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Norret must have felt the same, since he took the wasp.</p> \n   <p>Mistress\
  \ Philomela took the one in the shape of her goddess and delicately nibbled her\
  \ ear. “The only thing sweeter than the cakes of Calistria is the taste of revenge.”\
  </p> \n   <p>A great cry of exultation came up from the crowd. Rather than a load\
  \ of fresh prisoners being delivered by tumbrel cart, there was only one late arrival,\
  \ but arriving in style: a gilded, magical chariot borne by giant wasps hove into\
  \ view, driven by one of the priests of Calistria, dressed in a golden loincloth\
  \ that left little to the imagination, especially when it flapped aside. But hanging\
  \ from the back of the chariot was what truly captured the interest of the crowd:\
  \ a horrible monster, half woman, half spider, paralyzed by wasp venom, a look of\
  \ terror on her eight-eyed face because she knew what her fate would be.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The priest did three laps of the street, to greater cries of bloodlust each\
  \ time, until at last the Gray Gardener on the guillotine’s platform signaled for\
  \ him to land. He did.</p> \n   <p>There was then the usual dry speech about the\
  \ values of Liberty and the enemies of the people, as well as the thanks of the\
  \ people for those who’d apprehended the enemies of the Revolution, especially fiends\
  \ and monsters. It was then that I realized I was supposed to stand.</p> \n   <p>Norret\
  \ squeezed my hand and I stood next to him. Mistress Philomela stepped aside and\
  \ applauded us and the rest of the crowd below followed suit. I also realized I\
  \ was still holding the barely nibbled gingerbread dagger. I raised it over my head.\
  \ “Victory!” I cried.</p> \n   <p>“<i>Liberty! Equality! Fraternity!</i>” responded\
  \ the crowd.</p> \n   <p>“Vengeance,” added Mistress Philomela with an amused smile.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The execution of Madame Eglantine was very much like any other. Madame\
  \ Margaery’s blade was hoisted up. Madame Margaery’s blade came down. A woman’s\
  \ head bounced into the basket. A giant spider’s body lay on the stage. The crowd\
  \ cheered, all except a group of women in the front row who for once stopped their\
  \ knitting, looking at the head in the basket, then at each other with expressions\
  \ of mute horror. The Gray Gardener standing on the stage looked down at them with\
  \ his gray mask.</p> \n   <p>You know he was thinking exactly what they were thinking.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>There would be questions for Madame Eglantine’s head. Questions for the\
  \ heads of her husbands. Questions for myself and Norret.</p> \n   <p>I already\
  \ knew my answers. We had rehearsed them before.</p> \n   <p>We were two brothers\
  \ from Dabril. My brother was a veteran who had returned from the war. My father\
  \ and brother had died, so my mother remarried, and my brother had taken me with\
  \ him to be his apprentice when he returned to the capital. Any peculiarities about\
  \ me were likely just a bit of sorcery unlocked when I was ill. Nothing more.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Norret squeezed my hand. I looked at him. He smiled and bit off the wings\
  \ of his gingerbread wasp. I smiled back.</p> \n   <p>Mistress Philomela was wrong.\
  \ Revenge was sweet, but the sweetest thing was fraternity—having a brother there\
  \ for you.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A sample chapter from Hugh Matthews’\
