                <p>As we approach the end of the first year of Pathfinder second edition, we are excited to showcase some of our upcoming Pathfinder rulebooks, adventure paths, and world guides, while also announcing where the game is headed in 2021.</p> 
                <p>The panel that just concluded offers a lot of great previews of the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, coming out at the end of July. If you missed it live, you can check it out as a video-on-demand on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank"><b>twitch.tv/officialpaizo</b></a> and archived on our YouTube channel in the near future. We’ll also be presenting the usual series of preview blogs and media partner appearances in the coming months, but if you just can’t wait, here’s a glimpse at a few pieces of art from the book:</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_AdvancedPlayersGuide.jpg"><img style="max-width:45%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_AdvancedPlayersGuide.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">The book’s gorgeous cover by Wayne Reynolds, depicting Feiya, the iconic witch, and Jirelle, the iconic swashbuckler, fighting (or fleeing from?) a colossal sea serpent</p>
                </div> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_TIEFLING-ACOLYTE.jpg"><img style="max-width:45%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_TIEFLING-ACOLYTE.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">A tiefling, just one of options for characters with the planar scion versatile heritage presented in the book, by Pedro Kruger Garcia</p>
                </div> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_OracleFireFighter.jpg"><img style="max-width:75%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_OracleFireFighter.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">An exciting scene of an oracle fighting some hell hounds by Valeriya Lutfullina, featuring a brand new tengu iconic (you’ll get a chance to meet him soon!) Other classes included in the book are the investigator, swashbuckler, and witch.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>“But what,” you may ask, “do I do if I’m not an ‘advanced player?’” Have no fear, neophyte Pathfinder, because we have you covered this fall with the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! Completely compatible with the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, this all-in-one box pares down the options available to players to make their first steps into the exciting world of Pathfinder as straightforward as possible. With 4 pregenerated characters, a series of character and monster pawns, a 1st-level intro adventure, and more, this is the perfect starting point for new players of any age.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_BeginnerBoxContent.jpg"><img style="max-width:75%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_BeginnerBoxContent.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>The Beginner Box’s adventure takes place in the sleepy town of Otari just a few days’ travel from Absalom, but your troubles in Otari are just beginning! Picking up at 2nd level—right where the Beginner Box’s adventure leaves off—and taking your player characters to 5th level, <em>Pathfinder Adventure: Troubles in Otari</em> is an anthology adventure designed to introduce new players to a variety of playstyles and ease their transition into the world of character options presented in the full Pathfinder game.</p> 
                <p>For groups looking for a longer campaign, we are proud to announce the first 3-part Pathfinder Adventure Path, The Abomination Vaults! This dungeon-based campaign, also set in Otari, takes a group of 1st-level adventurers to 10th level, and tells a parallel story to that in the Beginner Box and <em>Troubles in Otari</em>. The first chapter of Abomation Vaults, <em>Ruins of Gauntlight</em> by James Jacobs, will be available in January, 2021.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_AbominatinVaultsLogo.jpg"><img style="max-width:75%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_AbominatinVaultsLogo.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>I can hear you now: “But, Paizo, you can’t do just one 3-part adventure path without throwing off your entire release schedule!” You’re right! That’s why we’re following Abomination Vaults up with a second 3-chapter adventure path: Fists of the Ruby Phoenix! This campaign starts at 10th level, allowing your Abomination Vault PCs to pick it up after that campaign concludes, or it can stand alone as its own story. We first saw the Ruby Phoenix Tournament—a worldwide test of martial arts and magic held every 10 years—in 2011, so it’s fitting that we’d check back in and see what’s happening with it on the next go-around. Look for more information on this adventure path later in the year.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>A few months ago, we released the <em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em>, and just this week the <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</em> hit shelves and online retailers worldwide. Now, we’re thrilled to announce the <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em> for a March, 2021 release to fill in the gaps of any iconic Pathfinder monsters that didn’t make the cut for the first two bestiaries. Let us know what you’d like to see included after checking out the newly released <em>Bestiary 2</em>.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</p>
                </div> 
                <p>Lastly, we take a look at the future of the Lost Omens line of world guides, detailing the tumultuous Age of Lost Omens in which the Pathfinder world finds itself now. Following the release of <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</em> in September, we’ll next delve deep into the uncommon and rare ancestries of the setting with the Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide. This indispensable sourcebook for players and GMs presents new character options for the many ancestries that have appeared in rulebooks other than the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, provides everything a player needs to play a member of such fan-favorite returning ancestries as android, geniekin, and kitsune, as well as a few ancestries that have never been available to player characters in the past!</p>

                <p>And that wraps up our week of announcements and previews from PaizoCon Online. Thanks for tuning in to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank"><b>twitch.tv/officialpaizo</b></a> for our livestreamed panels and Pathfinder and Starfinder games, and stay tuned through the weekend with even more games. PaizoCon Online is the largest convention we’ve ever put on, and so we must send a special thanks to our many volunteer Game Masters offering adventures for players around the world, around the clock. We couldn’t have done it without you. We’ll formally close out the show on Sunday, but until then, stay safe and roll high.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Starfinder Society’s Year of Exploration’s Edge kicks off in just three weeks at <a href="https://www.originsgamefair.com/origins-online" target="_blank">Origins Online</a> (June 19–21)! The new season takes place in the first period of real stability that the Starfinder Society has enjoyed since the campaign began. Of course, that doesn’t mean things will be easy for Starfinders. Emphasizing shorter bouts of exploration instead of a single, overarching metaplot, the upcoming season offers exciting new ventures into unexplored locales in the Pact Worlds, Near Space, and even far into the Vast, taking us farther afield and exploring more of the setting than we’ve ever seen before!</p> 
                <p>Looking to explore the uncharted regions of the Vast with a fancy starship (maybe with some accompanying content from the <em>Starfinder Starship Operations Manual</em>)? How about seeing those places recently detailed in <em>Starfinder Near Space</em> up close with some new characters? Or perhaps you’d fancy a mind-altering visit to the one Pact World we’ve not yet seen in a Starfinder adventure? (Hint: it’s Aucturn—the planet that might be a Great Old One.)</p> 
                <p>Year of Exploration’s Edge is the perfect opportunity to start enjoying Starfinder Society, or even to pick up as bonus content for your already ongoing Starfinder campaigns when you need that fun “planet of the week” diversion. While we’re not as focused on a major overarching metaplot, there are three unique multi-part stories that PCs of all level ranges can still enjoy and should scratch that ongoing story arc itch.</p> 
                <p>All this content (and more!) is just around the corner, with the Year of Exploration’s Edge releasing two new scenarios every month starting in June. Finally, dedicated Starfinder Society fans across the world can look forward to the upcoming multi-table interactive, Starfinder Society #3-00: The Last Bite, arriving in the coming months. This big-ticket event is set to bring a climactic conclusion to last season’s Year of a Thousand Bites storyline and provide an unforgettable experience to gaming events across the world! We look forward to sharing all this great content with you in the coming months.</p>

                <p>We’ll be wrapping up the current season, Year of the Open Road, with an awesome special in the form of Pathfinder Society Special #2-00: The King in Thorns, by authors Kate Baker and Dennis Muldoon. An ancient fey monster, a long-sealed demiplane, and a hero from the past will all take the stage as the Pathfinders fight their way through a horde of deadly plants and First World assailants in the first interactive special of Pathfinder Second Edition!</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder Society’s first Second Edition season, the Year of the Open Road, focused on rebuilding and rediscovering the Pathfinder Society in the wake of the world-shattering events that heralded the end of the first edition storyline. Now, with the Society rebuilt and refocused on their principles of exploration and discovery, the Pathfinders are set to embark on a new mission: creating a new Pathfinder lodge in Iobaria and delving into the ancient secrets that have lain dormant on the Inner Sea’s northeastern border for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.</p> 
                <p>Iobaria is home to ancient cyclopean ruins, deadly dragons, and mysterious monstrous denizens seldom recorded in the annals of the Inner Sea. As a centuries-old ritual unfolds, a looming presence stalks the abandoned cities and forlorn forests of the haunted northland, threating to ignite the wilderness into a conflagration of devastation and otherworldly evil. Agents of the Pathfinder Society are going to need to come prepared, as even the mightiest adventurers will find themselves pushed to the brink of certain doom on the desolate frontier.</p> 
                <p>This season we’ll also be rolling out some innovations to scenario format, taking the feedback we’ve received over the last year and assembling it into an improved template we think is the best yet for our program. We’ll also be swapping out our traditional Pathfinder Society Quest short scenario format for a new approach we’re calling Pathfinder Bounties. These 1-hour adventures answer the question “What does a Pathfinder do when the Society doesn’t have a job for them?” Unlike our quests and scenarios, bounties don’t assume that the players are members of the Pathfinder Society, and the adventures presented therein might be anything from a dragon hunt on the Crown of the World to saving a Druman farmer’s prized alpaca herds from predacious chupacabras. Bounties are designed to provide exciting entry points for any adventurer looking to start their career, and they’ll all be repeatable, making them a perfect option for game store owners and volunteer coordinators looking to introduce their community to Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> 
                <p>The Year of Corruption’s Reach kicks off at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/online" target="_blank">Gen Con Online Online</a> (July 30–August 2)!</p>

                <h3>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society: Year of Reborn Strife</h3> 
                <p>PaizoCon Online sees the launch of the first ever interactive developed specifically for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, adventure #6-99: Tyrant of the Harrow. An ill-fated fortune telling pulls the heroes into the Harrowed Realm, a mystical realm populated by a host of storybook characters. They must find a way back home before being sacrificed to fuel the plans of an evil mastermind!</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder Adventure Card Society’s new season, Year of Reborn Strife, starts in just a few months! The first half of the new season runs from August to December, with a new storybook releasing every month. The season’s early action takes the PCs to a swarming ancient metropolis filled with mysteries and intrigue. Kaer Maga, City of Strangers, is a haven for outcasts, misfits, rebels, and wayfarers from across the dangerous land of Varisia. Anyone is welcome on its shrouded streets, so long as they don’t ask too many questions or interfere with the freedom of their neighbors. </p> 
                <p>But a new threat rises to upset this delicate balance. Among the city’s more unusual denizens are zombie servants, kept in check by control amulets that prevent them from rampaging through the streets. A group of Pathfinder agents is on the scene when these amulets begin to fail, creating an undead menace. It falls to these Pathfinders to root out the source of the disruption. Along the way, they’ll meet several representatives of Kaer Maga’s iconic and eclectic factions, delve dangerous caverns, and uncover ancient secrets at nearly every turn!</p> 
                <p>The Year of Reborn Strife launches at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/online" target="_blank">Gen Con Online Online</a> (July 30–August 2)!</p>

                <h3><em>Starship Operations Manual</em></h3> 
                <p>This summer’s big Starfinder release is the <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>, a 160-page sourcebook for all things starship related, from custom upgrades and expansion modules, to advice on running starship-based campaigns, new starship monsters to challenge parties of all levels, to details on the galaxy’s most prominent manufacturers!</p>

                <h3><em>Devastation Ark Adventure Path</em></h3> 
                <p>We don’t just publish rules supplements, though! Starfinder is all about galaxy-spanning adventure, which we provide in the pages of the monthly <em>Starfinder Adventure Path</em>. In August, we’ll launch the first sequel AP in the line with the 3-chapter high-level Devastation Arc Adventure Path. This campaign begins at 13th level, making it the perfect sequel to nearly all of our previous APs, and characters should reach 20th level by the story’s conclusion! </p>

                <h3><em>Fly Free or Die Adventure Path</em></h3> 
                <p>In November, we’ll mix things up and return to our normal 6-chapter campaign format with the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path. In this exciting story, the player characters aren’t necessarily heroes—at least not intentionally. A crew of scoundrels, rogues, and misfits, they find it hard to survive in a galaxy where everyone has a price. Targeted by a crime boss and his army of enforcers, preyed upon by faceless mega-corporations, and hounded by rivals, the crew of the Free Trader <em>Oliphaunt</em> line up the big score that will at last make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. But when their many enemies join forces and the crew loses it all, they find out there are two things in the galaxy that can't be bought: freedom... and revenge.</p>

                <h3><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></h3> 
                <p>Fans wondering what our next hardcover rules supplement will be need look no further, because we’re happy to announce the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> for release in April of next year. This book will provide players and GMs alike with rules for hailing from or exploring the myriad worlds found in the Starfinder galaxy, covering a variety of biomes and planetary concepts, allowing for nearly endless possibility every time a starship drops out of the Drift into uncharted space. It’s still nearly a year out, so we don’t have a lot to show you now, but we’ll have a lot more on this book as its release approaches.</p>

                <p>Last year, we ran a crowdfunding campaign for a second edition version of one of our most popular Pathfinder Adventure Paths: Kingmaker. For several months, the task of gathering the text, generating new text, and tackling the initial conversions from first to second edition Pathfinder (and fifth edition!) were in the hands of our partners over at Legendary Games, but now the entire project is in our hands and we’re finalizing the updates, developing and editing the text, and building up what’s going to be one of the largest projects we’ve ever attempted at Paizo. The adventure path compilation itself is the size of the second edition <em>Core Rulebook</em>`, and it’s only one of the books and support products we’ll be creating in the months to come!</p> 
                <p>Currently, we’re finalizing the map turnovers we’ll be sending to the cartographer for the campaign’s various Flip-Mat Multi-Packs, fine-tuning the updated and expanded kingdom building and mass combat rules, and ordering new art for characters, creatures, and scenes both new and old. Because the book and accessories are still very much in process, we don’t have a lot to show you now, but we’ll keep the community updated as we reach more and more production milestones over the next few months.</p> 
                <p>Stay tuned for more news as it develops, but in the meantime, feast your eyes on the brand-new cover for the Kingmaker Adventure Path, created by the one and only Wayne Reynolds and featuring four of the campaign’s most memorable antagonists!</p>

                <p>PS—Fans of the <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> CRPG adaptation from our friends at Owlcat Games should make sure to follow the game’s publisher, Deep Silver, on social media for some exciting upcoming announcements about the future of the game, especially around IGN’s Summer of Gaming show in early June. That’s all we’re allowed to say at this point, but we’ll have more to report soon!</p>

Unlike a normal set, which comes with a single premium figure (or scene set) that’s directly tied to the purchase of an entire case of minis, this set features not one, but two different premium products.</p> 
                <p>First we have a double offering of Huge dragons in the form of an Adult Black and Adult Red Dragon. These figures are massive for their bases and really push the limits of what a Huge miniature (what a glorious oxymoron) can be. Check these puppies out!</p>

                </div> 
                <p>They’re not even the only dragons in the set! We couldn’t stop with just these two Huges, so we threw in a Large Green Dragon as well, in the rare category.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052220_Large_GreenDragon.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="400" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052220_Large_GreenDragon.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div> 
                <p>The second premium offering coming with this set is the Thieves’ Guild Premium Set, a standalone premium set that was originally supposed to be the sole premium this summer. We’ve heard fans’ feedback that some prefer scenery over monsters as well as the folks who said the opposite. The only way, it seemed, to make everyone happy was to do both. So we did.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The Thieves’ Guild is full of dungeon dressing befitting any secret guildhall of a city’s most notorious criminals. The set includes such pieces as a trapdoor with removable ladder; a weapon rack; two training dummies (one for picking pockets covered in tiny bells and the other a more traditional sparring dummy); a door and chest both covered in various types of locks to perfect one’s lockpicking skills; a satchel of thieves’ tools to lay on any table or floor where a rogue is hard at work; a loot sorting table and loot sack’ a card table with chairs (note the Harrow suits on the cards!); and a corpse-covered shrine to Father Skinsaw, the aspect of Norgorber focused on murder. My favorite part of the altar setpiece isn’t the eerie, translucent purple flames rising from the braziers but rather the fact that the wall behind the altar is removable, allowing for it to hide a secret passage or cache filled with even more gruesome and terrible things!</p>

                <p>Because we couldn’t release a thieves’ guild without putting at least one thief out to populate it, we also included the Thief Guildmaster in the City of Lost Omens set as a rare Medium figure.</p>

                <p>Even the most secure and secret thieves guild needs someone or something to guard it, though. And for that, we present the Skinstitch, a Large rare figure based on the creature from the <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em>!</p>

                <p>That’s it for this week’s previews, folks! I’ll be participating in PaizoCon Online beginning tomorrow morning, so if you’ve got additional questions feel free to stop by the convention’s Discord server and seek out my AMA thread. I’ll do my best to address mini-related queries there. Also, make sure to catch a few seminars or live-play streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a> or get a “seat” at one of the hundreds of virtual tables running Pathfinder and Starfinder games through Sunday. </p> 
                <p>Until next week—when I’ll show off the many potential player character figures in the set (one for every ancestry in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>!)—stay safe, enjoy PaizoCon Online, and roll high.</p>

                <br> 
                <h3>James Case (he/him), Organized Play Developer</h3> 
                <p>I think I have a pretty typical background for many people from Hawaii. One of my grandfathers was Native Hawaiian, one of my grandmothers is a Korean immigrant, and my other two grandparents are white—one from the neighbor islands of Hawaii, one from Missouri (definitely pronounced with a -ruh). Growing up in an environment where (checks wiki) 25% of the people were hapa, or mixed race, I never thought much of it, but after leaving the island, I realized how much I took growing up in a multicultural environment for granted, with a diverse set of influence both within my own family and in the ones around me to draw on. In my work now, I’m happy to be able to help push towards a broader view of what fantasy can be. It’s no secret that fantasy games especially have often skewed to a predominantly European setting, and while I love my knights and dragons, don’t get me wrong, I also know that that’s just one mythology among many that each have their legendary heroes to embody and monsters to slay (or beseech, or fight alongside!). I’m happy to see more and more stories coming out of games lately, and to be in a place where I can contribute to them by pitching creatures from stories that my grandfather first told me around a campfire on the beach.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Eleanor Ferron (she/her), Pathfinder Developer</h3> 
                <p>My grandfather was Nisei—a Japanese American son born to first generation Japanese immigrants to America. He was one of the most interesting people I ever knew, serving in American military intelligence even during a war when Japanese American citizens, including his family, were unjustly forced into internment camps with only the things they could carry. He inspired in me both a fascination for East Asian culture, but also in the Asian immigrant communities that helped build the American West Coast. My work at Paizo has allowed me to work with peoples and myths inspired from East Asia, and in our own Golarion setting, with Avistani immigrants who draw from those same people and myths, such as the Tian communities in Varisia or the well-known tengu jinx-eaters who sail the Shackles.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Joan Hong (she/her), Customer Service Representative</h3> 
                <p>I’m the daughter of two Korean immigrants who left everything behind to chase their American Dream. I grew up learning Korean traditional instruments, eating rice at every meal, and thinking that the dishwasher was just an oversized drying rack. If I’m being honest, I spent a lot of my childhood resenting my Korean heritage because I felt like an outsider. What I wish I knew back then is that the culture and traditions my parents passed along to me don’t make me an outsider, they provide me with a rich background and history that broaden my perspective. Recently, seeing greater Asian representation in media has touched me in ways that I can’t express well in words. It makes me realize how important representation is, and how much I missed out on because I felt like I wouldn’t fit in with people I couldn’t see myself reflected in. As an Asian staff member and freelance writer for Paizo, I feel empowered to share my perspective thanks in part to the support of wonderful colleagues. The TTRPG industry is changing for the better every day, and look forward to more content from diverse writers and streamers.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Ianara Natividad (she/her), Editor</h3> 
                <p>I come from a family of immigrants, myself included, who moved from the Philippines and settled in the United States. I grew up surrounded by the most hardworking people I’d ever known. There was always that sense I had to work just as hard. Sometimes, I felt the pressure of what it means to have to succeed, knowing that many of the people around me—my mom and dad especially—endured and sacrificed so much to build my life in America. </p> 
                <p>For most of my schooling, I was set for a STEM career. All of my extended family’s children, in my generation, were pursuing similar opportunities: STEM, medicine, law, and business. My exposure to gaming all came from external sources, such as school and friends, so it wasn’t something I openly shared with my family. Eventually, I realized STEM careers weren’t for me. My parents felt confused and disappointed at first, but they understood that I wanted to do something that kept me happy. They supported me as I studied history, worked at a nonprofit, and pursued my editing and writing work. It felt like my family knew I would work hard regardless of what field I chose, an ethic that I witnessed and learned from them. So I did. I went into my gaming interests hard, and all that ultimately led me down the path that got me working at Paizo. Just one of the many reasons I love and appreciate my family.</p> 
                <br> 
                <h3>Lu Pellazar (he/they), Editor </h3> 
                <p>Ohai! I’m Lu, an editor (and occasional contributor) at Paizo. Most of my experience with being API in the gaming industry is not just about incorporating my roots in the products I work on. For me personally, it’s a lot of learning from other API gamers, writers, designers etc. As a mixed-race diaspora kid who was raised by my Black dad and Filipino/German mom (who was herself raised by my 100% Bavarian oma), it’s hard to feel like I fully “fit in” with ANY of my cultures, let alone my Filipino side. I never really embraced my Filipino culture until my mid-20s, when I started looking into it more myself. I’m in my 30s now, but I’m still learning new things about my culture every day; yes, even “basic” things that “every” Filipino person knows. AND THAT’S FINE!! For anyone reading who might relate (my friends have to remind me of this): Just know that being a diaspora kid is a cultural experience in and of itself, and none of us are any less valid for it. There are a ton of amazing creators and gamers in our community that we can learn from if we want to.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Zellara sat at the table in her small house, her Harrow deck centered on the red tablecloth. The lantern light cloaked as much as it illuminated, leaving deep shadows to gather in the corners of the room, in the spaces behind furniture and under cupboards.</p> 
                <p>Fatigue made her eyelids heavy and blurred her thoughts. Zellara knew she should go into a Harrow reading well rested. She likewise knew that rest would not come. Ever since Eran died, sleep eluded her. The toll of daily living—waking, eating, breathing—exhausted her. Her work tracking down her son’s killer added to the burden.</p> 
                <p>She passed a hand over the deck. Today had been spent at the local guardhouse, presenting her case to an indifferent Korvosan captain. She laid out her evidence like it was a Harrow spread, setting each piece in its place to show the pattern. His eyes remained closed, and this latest defeat on top of a year of defeats wearied Zellara further.</p> 
                <p>She picked up the deck and shuffled. The cards felt strange, as if she were a novice again, training at her grandmother’s knee. She shuffled until she felt an energy awaken in her fingertips.</p> 
                <p>There were many spreads available to her. The Tapestry, showing the nuances and influences in past, present, and future. The Bridge, providing guidance and insight toward her chosen plan—if she had one. But her meeting today had been the last resort. All doors seemed closed to her now. All avenues exhausted.</p> 
                <p>The past would not help her. She needed to look to the future. To leap ahead into the unknown.</p> 
                <p>Zellara set the deck back on the red tablecloth and drew the first card.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052020_MKTCotCT.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052020_MKTCotCT.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Zellara’s Reading, illustration by Mark Molnar.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>She had learned long ago to respect the cards, not fear them. All the same, she recoiled at the image of the bound man hanging above a bubbling cauldron. The Waxworks. A card of great distress, of helplessness and torment.</p> 
                <p>Was the man in the image hanging helplessly? Did unseen hands lower him into the wax? Or was he on the verge of escape? Zellara instinctively found an interpretation.</p> 
                <p>At the most basic level, this card represented her life. She was the one in torment, suffering every day as she hunted her son’s killer. Every night when she closed her eyes, the last image she saw before sleep was the memory of her son’s severed head and hands. A message from his killer.</p> 
                <p>On a deeper level, the Waxworks encompassed all the humble streets under Gaedren Lamm’s influence. Zellara’s neighbors struggled to get through each day while the petty crime lord wreaked havoc. He stole, extorted, and slaughtered his way through the district, and none seemed able to stop him. The people were trapped, dangling over the boiling cauldron of Lamm’s evil.</p> 
                <p>“I know this,” Zellara whispered. She knew to be patient during a reading. The Waxworks could be necessary to properly interpret the rest of the cards.</p> 
                <p>She still hadn’t decided what spread she was using. It was dangerous to read a Harrow without a clear framework in mind, but caution had taken her as far as it could. She was leaving the shore, swimming into deep waters.</p> 
                <p>Zellara frowned. Water… there was something there. The hanging figure above the cauldron looked shadowed in the faint light, dusky of hair and skin as Eran had been. Was it wax he descended toward, or murky water?</p> 
                <p>Leaving the image of water to linger in her mind, she drew the next card.</p> 
                <p>The colorful image showed a man with the head of a crow, staring at a table covered in wealth. Two masked figures sat to either side. The Crows.</p> 
                <p>Another seemingly obvious card. The Crows signified murder and loss, especially of that which was loved. Zellara tried to stay patient, but a bubble of frustration rose within her. Why were the cards showing her what she already knew? Gaedren Lamm, the crime lord who used murder and theft to acquire his wealth. What was she missing?</p> 
                <p>She went back to the Waxworks. The victim, Eran, descending toward death. Wax—or water? The bubbles of boiling wax could be the froth on the waves. Water and crows. She’d seen flocks of black-winged scavengers clustering by the docks last week. A lead drew her to the water’s edge, a rumor that Lamm worked out of a shabby tavern catering to fisherfolk. Zellara’s inquiries turned up no sign of the crime lord.</p> 
                <p>As she stepped out of the tavern, she startled a flock of crows. They rose from a pile of fish guts and discarded bones, their rough cries cutting through the still morning air.</p> 
                <p>“Loss of something loved.” Zellara spoke the words aloud, trying to fit them into the pattern. The loss of her son, yes, but beyond that? </p> 
                <p>She’d discovered several of Lamm’s previous lairs during her investigation. Always too late. Destitute businesses or abandoned buildings where Lamm had run his operations and terrorized his crew of street urchins. Buildings that had once been the hope of their owners, locals who had poured all their money and hard work into their craft. Now sad and empty, the gold that should have filled their coffers instead spilling over Lamm’s table.</p> 
                <p>Water. The crows at the docks. A place that once held industry and hope, now full of broken dreams.</p> 
                <p>Zellara reached for the deck, but hesitated. She’d laid the first two cards side by side. Their faces showed Eran’s death in the past, her search for Lamm in the present. The pattern implied the next card would show the future.</p> 
                <p>The first rule of Harrowing was to always spread a branching path. To cast a single future card was not only foolish, it was dangerous. It left no recourse for turning aside or following a different current of fate. To lay a third card now would be to end the spread and commit herself to this path.</p> 
                <p>Perhaps that was the price the cards required. To avenge Eran, she would make any sacrifice.</p> 
                <p>Zellara turned the third card up. Her eyes widened.</p> 
                <p>A stout woman held a screaming devil-child by the leg. Her other hand pointed up, two fingers extended and bathed in a blue flame. Behind her, a transparent figure hid his face.</p> 
                <p>Zellara had not been expecting the Midwife.</p> 
                <p>A disturbing card, but also an optimistic one. The Midwife heralded arrivals and indicated the discovery of new information. The ghostly figure could be Eran, mourning his own fate—or a fate yet to come. Zellara herself was the midwife, channeling her discoveries into the world. But who was the child?</p> 
                <p>A new companion, perhaps. A stranger instrumental to her quest for vengeance. Possibly a literal child. Lamm was well known for using orphans and street children in his organization. “Lamm’s Lambs” the locals termed them.</p> 
                <p>Zellara had seen such a child not long ago. A starved, sickly-looking imp with a mop of dark hair that reminded her of Eran. The boy had offered dock-dumplings for sale, lumpy and smelling of fish and decay. Zellara had bought one out of charity and tossed it to a street cat on her way home.</p> 
                <p>She traced the image of the child on the card with one finger. Water. The docks. The crows feasting on fish guts. A dead business, a place of broken dreams. Lamm’s Lambs. A thin child selling dumplings made of old fish.</p> 
                <p>A thrill of excitement rippled through Zellara. The Harrowing had been a risk, but it had been worth it. She had what she needed.</p> 
                <p>She picked up the cards and returned them to the deck, hesitating only for a moment over the Midwife. New arrivals. She felt with a Harrower’s instinct that a stranger or strangers awaited in her future. Ones with an important role to play. She would remain alert for those who could offer aid.</p> 
                <p>Zellara wrapped the cards in her kapenia and put them away. She donned her cloak and took up her walking stick. It was a dark night, perfect for exploring the docks under cover of shadow.</p> 
                <p>The cards had guided her true. Now she took the final steps on her path to revenge.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>For those that didn’t see today’s earlier blog, check out our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh8g">Pathfinder Society releases for May</a>.</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo examined the datapad with a jubilant smile.</p> 
                <p>“It gives me great honor to confirm Zafeldrin’s appointment to the role of venture-captain.” Luwazi spoke aloud to the crew members diligently working their stations. “He’s worked hard on Triaxus, and there were no voices on the Forum opposing this appointment. Besides, it should be interesting to have a full-blooded dragon venture-captain in our ranks!”</p> 
                <p>A flash of holographic data stole Luwazi’s attention, bringing her back to the moment. She examined the data with a raised eyebrow before directly questioning the crew, “Still no signal or report from the asteroid?”</p> 
                <p>One of the science officers responded, “No, ma’am. The entire site seems eerily quiet. Should we send in the first wave of ships?”</p> 
                <p>Luwazi pondered the dangerous question as she reviewed one final addendum to the datapad. It appeared that Zafeldrin was already hoping to employ several groups of Starfinder field agents for a mission into the abandoned Triaxian region of Cadascon, a region known for its strange crystalline growths. A bold endeavor, and one that could surely expand the Society’s influence on Triaxus and perhaps skyrocket Zafeldrin’s influence.</p> 
                <p>“Good luck then...” Luwazi mused while approving the mission and stowing the datapad.</p> 
                <p>“Ma’am?” the science officer queried, unsure if Luwazi’s statement was a reply to his question.</p> 
                <p>Straightening in her command chair, Luwazi Elsebo directed her full attention to the officer, “Not yet. We’ll divide the ships into tactical assault groups and make sure that we go in together. This mission could put an end to Datch and her campaign against the Society, so I want it done correctly.”</p> 
                <p>“Understood!” the officer half-shouted a response, “I’ll get to re-organizing our ships immediately. Also, the senior field agents are on standby for their briefing in the requested meeting chamber.”</p> 
                <p>Almost leaping from her seat, Luwazi looked around the command deck of the ship, “Then I’ll leave the rest to all of you. I’ll go brief our premiere agents on this mission. When I return, we’ll begin the first phases of the operation.”</p> 
                <p>Taking a single step away from the command chair, Luwazi paused. With a smile, she half-turned and reached to a wooden container she had kept just under her console. Plucking one of many similar objects from the container, Luwazi strode to the nearest bridge exit.</p> 
                <p>Staring at the shiny red apple she had withdrawn from the basket, Luwazi flashed a devil’s smile.</p> 
                <p>“We’ve got you now, Datch.”</p> 
                <p>She took a bite.</p>

                <hr> 
                <p>We’ve got two new scenarios coming out in May, wrapping up the main arc of Starfinder Society’s Year of a Thousand Bites. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023cw?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-223-The-Edge-of-Cadascon"><em>Starting with Starfinder Society #2-23: Edge of Cadascon</em></a> by Emily Parks, the PCs travel to the Pact World of Triaxus and take part in a major expedition to a mysterious region of the planet. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023cx?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-224-Cornered-Rat"><em>Starfinder Society #2-24: Cornered Rat</em></a> by Mikko Kallio, the PCs take charge of an all-out assault on a hidden installation used by the nefarious ysoki mastermind, Datch. This important mission could put an end to the multimedia smear campaign used to besmirch the Starfinder Society throughout the Pact worlds!</p> 
                <p>Until next time,</p> 
                <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Thurston Hillman<br> <em>Starfinder Society Developer</em></p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“You’ll not believe it, my friend,” Gorm says, scratching his nose with one calloused finger. “The world is spinning faster than I’ve ever seen it, and I’ve lived through three wars! Or is it four? What’s a siege count as?”</p> 
                <p>Gorm’s mule, Muttonchop, gives the same exasperated snort that’s been his only response to Gorm’s inquiries over the last few weeks.</p> 
                <p>“Stubborn as your namesake and half as handsome!” Gorm declares with a smile. “What do you care about the fact that Eliza is reopening the Maze of the Open Road not even half a year after becoming the unmasked representative of the Decemvirate? Nothing, I suppose.”</p> 
                <p>Gorm tightens his knees slightly around Muttonchop’s flanks and swings his lute down off his back, casually plucking a jaunty tune with fingers that that quickly prove much defter than their blunt shape would imply. “A lady fair with scarlet hair, walked through a winding maze / and though her mind was sharp and fine, darkness plagued her ways. What do you think, Muttonchop, too trite? I don’t think so either.” Slinging the lute back over his shoulder, Gorm quickly retrieves a notepad and ink pen from the voluminous pockets of his magical vest, sketching down the lyrics. “I suppose the rest shall have to wait until she makes it to Woodsedge and files her report. Hope it goes well; she brought some of our finest agents, but the Maze of the Open Road isn’t what it used to be. Dark things lurk in the passages and the walls between planes are exceptionally thin. Hah! I suppose I don’t need to tell the first mule to ever walk on Akiton about the dangers of the maze!”</p> 
                <p>The duo rides in comfortable silence for a few more miles, Gorm occasionally humming to himself in cheerful composition, Muttonchop displaying the same stalwart silence his dwarven partner had come to expect.</p> 
                <p>“Now, you know what’s going to really need a song, don’t you, Muttonchop?” Gorm asks with a wide smile. “That expedition down in the Mwangi! On the trail of a founding member of the Pathfinder Society, seeking out secrets lost to the mists of time! B’ah, we should have gone with, my friend! What legends might we find ourselves excluded from?” Clearing his throat, Gorm begins to sing a new song, slinging his lute back to hand and rapping out a percussive rhythm against its wooden face between strummed notes.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>"Across the ocean dark and fierce, a legend for to find<br> A trail gone cold, a challenge old, a story lost to time<br> Lo the legend marks his steps through swamp and tree and vine.<br> Heed this story! Listen well, I’ll tell you something true<br> A legend lost’s a legend still, when found it’s something new."</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>Gorm hums a few more bars while idly strumming the lute before slinging it once more across his back and jotting down the new lyrics. As he does so, Muttonchop crests a rise in the trail and the sprawling scape of Absalom comes into view. “The City at the Center of the World, my friend! Home from Otari at last. With any luck, Dreng will be back from his trip down to the sewers and we can swap a few drinks and few stories, old and new alike. Assuming I can get that cagey scoundrel to talk. Did you know he’s got medals from both the Eagle Knights and the Lion Blades? That one has more secrets than any other ten members of the Society rolled together!” The dwarf bard and his stoic mule continue along their way, following the road to Absalom.</p>

                <p><b>What is Tales from Darkmoon Vale?</b></p> 
                <p>For our first foray into recorded second edition, we’ll be playing through a converted version of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy82r0"><em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em></a>. This GameMastery adventure was written by Jason Bulmahn and F. Wesley Schneider and released by Paizo in 2007 as part of Free RPG Day, which means the adventure is available for free on Paizo’s website! Hollow’s Last Hope also happens to be the first ever adventure set in the world of Pathfinder. It is part of a series of adventures all set in the town of Falcon’s Hollow.</p> 
                <p>To quote from the back of the adventure: </p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p>The plague has come to the town of Falcon's Hollow, and not even the town's priest can abate its wretched course. With the coughs of the sick and the wails of the dying echoing through town, the local herbalist uncovers a cure, but she needs some brave heroes to retrieve the ingredients. Finding the cure means risking the dangerous Darkmoon Vale.</p> 
                 <p>[...] Do the heroes have the skill and courage to find the cure in time?</p> 
                </blockquote> 
                <p>Ross Scoggin has lovingly converted <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em> from 3.5 to Pathfinder Second Edition, and will be gamemastering this mini-series. Ross has many years of experience GMing, and will bring a fresh take on masterful storytelling to the Find the Path Ventures lineup. </p> 
                <br> 
                <p><b>Who is playing in Tales from Darkmoon Vale?</b></p> 
                <p>We will have five players on the show: Heather Allen, Jessica Peters, Jordan Jenkins, Rachel Sandidge, and Rick Sandidge. Yes, you read that right! Rick will be making his debut as a <em>player</em> on Find the Path in this series.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Heather is playing Celestine, a half-elf street urchin rogue who was raised on the streets of Falcon’s Hollow. </p> 
                <p>Jessica is playing Clove, a human herbalist barbarian who is trying to navigate being an adult for the first time while working to find a cure for the people in the town.</p> 
                <p>Jordan is playing Amaranthe, an elf scholar wizard who has come to Falcon’s Hollow to pay his respects at the funeral of an old friend.</p> 
                <p>Rachel is playing Astrea, a halfling laborer fighter who works as a forge worker while secretly working against the Lumber Consortium. </p> 
                <p>Rick is playing Grim, a dwarf scout champion who tends an apple orchard on the outskirts of town while caring for his daughter-in-law and granddaughter.</p> 
                <br> 
                <p><b>Why YouTube?</b></p> 
                <p>Tales from Darkmoon Vale will be our first mini-series adventure, and we feel it is a prime opportunity to try something new and different. Giving this series a home on our YouTube channel ensures it won't get lost in the Find the Path Podcast feed and gives us the chance to experiment with a new format.</p> 
                <p>As an added bonus, we will be hosting a Live Premiere of the first episode on May 27th at 7pm CDT so that listeners can join in for live commentary from the cast! This lines up with PaizoCon Online, which felt like a perfect time to get together with fellow fans of Pathfinder to celebrate a new entry into the Pathfinder Second Edition podcast world.</p>

                <p>Those familiar with the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse">Extinction Curse Adventure Path</a> know that it features a few reptilian foes from the deep Darklands, and we made sure to include a number of figures to help GMs of the campaign build out their warbands. Below are the Xulgath Skulker and Xulgath Warrior, both Medium common figures, and the Xulgath Chief, a Medium rare figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Xulgath_skulker.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Xulgath_skulker.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Xulgath_warrior.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Xulgath_warrior.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Xulgath_-chief.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Xulgath_-chief.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>The xulgaths don’t fight alone, however. No, we didn’t name one of the volumes of the adventure path <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0233c?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-154-Siege-of-the-Dinosaurs">Siege of the Dinosaurs</a> for nothing! I knew we couldn’t do the set without at least one thunder lizard included, but it turns out those are some big mothers, so I had to work closely with AP developer Ron Lundeen to find one from the adventure that we could make in a non-Huge set. Enter the Pinacosaurus, a Large uncommon figure that could easily stand in for a young ankylosaurus.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Pinacosaurus.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="500" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Pinacosaurus.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>The inhabitants of the Darklands aren’t restricted to just the Starstone Isle, though, and we made sure to include another potential warband’s worth of figures found not far below the city of Absalom itself. Here are the Duergar Bombardier, Duergar Sharpshooter, and Duergar Taskmaster. All Medium figures at the common, common, and uncommon rarity, respectively.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Duergar_bombardier.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Duergar_bombardier.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Duergar_sharpshooter.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Duergar_sharpshooter.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Duergar_taskmaster.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Duergar_taskmaster.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>One of the key abilities that marks duergar from their dwarven kin is their ability to magically double in size. We’d hardly be doing these gray dwarves any favors to include them in the set and <em>not</em> include a large version of them as well. A Large uncommon figure, the Enlarged Duergar is sure to make a big scene when she hits the table.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Enlarged_duergar.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="500" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Enlarged_duergar.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>Much nearer the surface, in the sewers of Absalom, dwell even more awful beasts that I can’t wait to show you! Here’s the Offalth, a new monster created for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary">Pathfinder Bestiary</a> and appearing in plastic for the first time. This Large rare miniature can also stand in for any number of sewer monsters or mounds of shambling refuse.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Offalth.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="500" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Offalth.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>Another new addition to the game in the Bestiary was the nightmare-inspiring Gogiteth, a spidery abomination with multiple heads and too-human teeth is pretty squicky, so it’ll make a great encounter for your unsuspecting players!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Gogiteth.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="500" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Gogiteth.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>While you’re exploring the depths beneath Absalom, it’s not just creatures you need to look out for. There are countless traps and other hazards present throughout, and four of the set’s six pieces of dungeon dressing represent those same traps! These bonus figures are distributed in random booster boxes and don’t take up one of their four figure slots, and don’t have bases so they incorporate seamlessly into any number of 3D terrain options. Taking our art inspiration from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook">Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a>, we included the following traps in City of Lost Omens: armageddon orb, darkside mirror, swinging scythe blades, and wheel of misery (with functionally spinning wheel!)</p>
                <p> </p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Armageddon_orb.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Armageddon_orb.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Darkside_mirror.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Darkside_mirror.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Wheel_of_misery.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="30%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/051820_Wheel_of_misery.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div> 
                <p>That’s it for this week’s previews. Next week, we’ll look at upcoming premium figures, including the two included in City of Lost Omens and the thieves’ guild releasing alongside them, plus a few other figures for good measure. Until then, stay safe, Pathfinders.</p>

                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                <p>Onto the news…</p> 
                <p>We made lots of announcements the past month regarding the upcoming PaizoCon Online. For more information on events, check out the blogs we posted on <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh82">Wednesday</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh85">Thursday</a> of this week. Though we still have a few weeks to go before PaizoCon and are putting final touches on that event, we are also looking beyond to Origins Online. If you are interested in GMing at Origins Online, email <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for more information.</p> 
                <p>We also have seen movement on the Achievement Point program and many players and GMs note their totals are closer to expected totals. We are actively working on resolving the issues and we hope to have more to announce soon.</p> 
                <p>Our friends at Know Direction advised they received 84 entries in the Battle of the Pantheon contest. They are reviewing the entries and will pass on their top choices to our team for us to pick our top selections. From there, we will preview all of them in a blog on <b>June 4th, 2020</b> and open voting shortly after. </p> 
                <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                <p>The team’s worked hard this month on getting caught up and we hope to finalize sanctioning on the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes"><em>Age of Ashes Adventure Path</em></a> before the end of May. Stay tuned for more information. </p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>With the lack of travel due to Covid-19, we awarded no coins during the past month.</p> 
                <h2>Stars</h2> 
                <p>We don’t have any new 5 stars this month. For those waiting on displays of 5 stars behind your name, we hope to have them appear soon as part of the Achievement Point resolution.</p> 
                <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>The online nova evaluation tool is still undergoing work, but you can submit any evaluations via an online form. Venture-Captains, please use <a href="https://forms.gle/Etf1v87LjM6pCA748" target="_blank">this form</a> to submit evaluations.</p> 
                <p>As part of the Achievement Point fixes, we are also resolving the issues with GM rankings and table counts displaying properly. You should see Starfinder Society table counts show something other than 0 and a space to count Glyphs appearing soon.</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>Many of the conventions planned for the upcoming months have needed to cancel or postpone due to shelter in place orders, but several others moved their events online. We’ve listed the status for each event, but please check their websites or notices for any last minute changes. </p>

Where there is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.</p> 
                 <h4>GRENDEL’S MOTHER</h4> 
                 <p>At the bottom of a remote mountain lake filled with sea serpents is a magical house—the lair of Grendel’s mother. Among her many treasures is a sword so big and heavy that only a supernaturally strong individual can wield it. When Grendel is injured, he retreats here to heal.</p>

                 <h3>Morlock</h3> 
                 <p>Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands. Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four-limbed shuffle for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.</p> 
                 <h4>MORLOCK MACHINERY</h4> 
                 <p>Morlocks tend toward brutish actions and violent traditions and have little interest in bettering their societies or creating art. However, they have a strange obsession with ancient machinery and magical items, particularly clockwork constructions. Their knack for tinkering helps keep ancient guardians and traps functional, even if their work backfires now and then</p>

                 <h3>Ravener</h3> 
                 <p>Though their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually perish. While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners.</p> 
                 <h4>RAVENER LAIRS</h4> 
                 <p>Cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as teleport or gaseous form. Of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist, so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they’ll starve.</p>

                 <h3>Serpentfolk</h3> 
                 <p>Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos made flesh.”</p> 
                 <h4>THE HEADLESS KING</h4> 
                 <p>Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King’s body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands. That the decapitated god’s clerics still gain power from worship points to Ydersius’s tenacity and continued existence, after a fashion. Those who seek to recover his skull and return it to his body hope that doing so will restore both him and the sekmin civilization to their full power.</p>

                <p>Sandpoint. An ordinary town on the Lost Coast of Varisia. When Ezren, Merisiel, Valeros and Harsk arrive, seeking rest from their adventures, it seems the town's annual Swallowtail Festival will give them what they need—until goblins attack during a ceremony to consecrate the town's rebuilt church.</p> 
                <p>After defending Sandpoint, the adventurers discover a sinister plot to return an ancient evil to Varisia. Can they discover the connection between the goblin attack and the removal of mortal remains from a crypt in the town's graveyard?</p> 
                <p>This is just the beginning of a new quest for the iconic Pathfinder characters Ezren, Merisiel, Valeros and Harsk. The Rise of the Runelords begins with burnt offerings—and only four heroes stand against it.</p>

Guaril has been charging refugees to sneak them out of Xin Edasseril, a city ruled by the Runelord of Envy, and now it looks like Guaril won't be able to fulfill his contracts. Society agents are charged with sneaking into the dangerous city and sneaking out with a handful of its citizens before their absence is noticed so that the Radiant Oath can help them find new lives beyond their current ruler's tyrannical reach.<br> <b>Sessions</b>: Tuesday, May 26: 12pm (noon), Friday, May 29: 6am, Saturday, May 30: 6pm</p>

The family's patriarch, the warrior Hlavard Grenskuldr, appears to have perished in a shipwreck while wearing the family's heirloom, the gorget of the Linnorm King Grehunde the Sunchaser. For one hundred generations the family has passed this heirloom down from parent to child, until Hlavard sought to wear it on a journey to Valenhall as Grehunde herself had intended to do before perishing with the task unfinished. Unwilling to leave the relic to rust away in a watery grave, Hlavard's family has requested the Pathfinder Society's assistance in locating the shipwreck and retrieving the family treasure.<br> <b>Sessions</b>: Friday, May 29: 6pm</p>

                 <p><b>SFS 2-03: The Withering World (level 1-4)</b><br> <em>Rigby Bendele</em><br> The Starfinder Society has dispatched an investigation fleet to a seemingly impossible world: a planet located between a nurturing sun and a voracious black hole.

Recently, a group of radical morlamaws was discovered to have been working with an individual opposed to the Society's interests. The PCs travel to Arniselle to follow-up on this group's activities and link it back to the mysterious ysoki known as Datch. The truth behind these morlamaws is beyond comprehension, and threatens all life on Arniselle and beyond!<br> <b>Scenario tags</b>: Faction (Exo-Guardians)<br> <b>Sessions</b>: Saturday, May 30: 12pm (noon)</p>

Bringing these creatures to Absalom Station as part of a clandestine trade, events go awry and the trader’s preserved wildlife escape into the station. In order to prevent station-wide panic, the Starfinder Society sends its best agents to find out what happened, track down the escaped Swarm lifeforms, and stop a full-scale infestation at the heart of the Pact Worlds!<br> <b>Sessions</b>: Saturday, May 30: 6pm</p>

Her ship, The Wandering Waterbear, is a submersible that travels between settlements on the River Between; it's also the smelly and nigh-indestructible shrunken corpse of a Giant Tardegrade. Captain Cora likes to pilot her ship down the river and ram wyrms. The party's job is simple; get on Cora's crew, find the scientist and save Vaando dome.

                <p>In July, we’ll be launching our third Pathfinder Adventure Path for Pathfinder second edition, the fantasy cops-and-robbers <a href="“/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/agentsOfEdgewatch”">Agents of Edgewatch</a>, in which the players all take on the roles of members of Absalom’s city watch coming together to address a city-wide threat. It is fitting, then, that we include some members of said watch in this set. We put as many of these figures in the set’s variable slots as we could, allowing the same sculpts to be altered slightly to increase the total number of players who might find just the right one to represent their character. We had our concept artists design a series of uniforms for the watch so that we could maintain visual consistency between the forthcoming books set in Absalom and these minis, so be sure to let us know what you think of the new watch uniforms! Here we have two versions of the Absalom Watch Cadet, two Medium figures at the common and uncommon rarity, respectively.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p>We don’t yet know when or how we’ll be distributing it, but we’ve also got a promo repaint of the human version of this figure coming later, with a darker skin tone (perhaps of Keleshite ancestry).</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p>Slightly higher in rank, the Absalom Watch Officer comes in two varieties at the uncommon rarity, both Medium (human) figures.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>Rounding out this series of city watch members, we have the Absalom Watch Captain, a Medium rare figure.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_AbsalomWatchCaptain.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="45%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_AbsalomWatchCaptain.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div> 
                <p>While city watch members can really bring any campaign world to life, we didn’t just infuse Pathfinder Battles: City of Lost Omens with one flavor of Absalom. After all, it’s the world’s largest city. We pulled out all the stops to ensure the setting’s cosmopolitan nature was reflected in this set.</p> 
                <p>Take Chief Zusgut, for example. This Small rare figure represents the most influential goblin in Absalom, whose dominion over the Puddles is (mostly) absolute.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_ChiefZusgut.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="45%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_ChiefZusgut.jpg" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <p>Absalom’s naval supremacy in the Inner Sea is undisputed, in large part due to two forces working to protect the city’s harbor and nearby waters. The first are the hippocampus-riding Wave Riders, while the second are the amphibious humanoids known as the Low Azlanti. Depicted here are the Large uncommon and Medium common figures for each of these two iconic Absalom natives.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_WaveRider.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="45%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_WaveRider.jpg" alt=""></a><a href="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_LowAlanti.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="45%" src="https://paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050820_LowAlanti.jpg" alt=""></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Finally, in keeping with our tradition of including relevant deities from the Pathfinder pantheon in Pathfinder Battles sets, we knew we couldn’t do a set based on Absalom without including the remaining ascended gods. Thus, we have Aroden, founder of Absalom and currently very dead, and Norgorber. Check back over the next few weeks to see a few figures themed to the faiths of both of these gods! Both rare Medium figures, Aroden and Norgorber are sure to add a touch of the divine to any campaign. </p>

                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                <p itemprop="description">Hello, all! It’s your friendly neighborhood Pathfinder Adventure Card Game venture-captain again! Today, I want to tell you about an exciting new development for PACG online play: we can now play in two different “virtual tabletop” formats: Tabletop Simulator (a paid app for playing a variety of card and board games online) and a free-to-use, custom-built interface at <a href="http://acg.orgplayonline.com" target="_blank">acg.orgplayonline.com</a>!</p> 
                <p>Paizo does not receive any revenue from these options, so we’re asking that at least one person at the virtual table own physical copies of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set</em></a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a>.</p> 
                <h3>Tabletop Simulator</h3> 
                <p>First, let’s discuss Tabletop Simulator. I’d like to start by noting that Paizo has not made any agreements with Berserk Games, the creators of Tabletop Simulator. What they HAVE done is given the online VO corps permission to direct players to Tabletop Simulator as a viable social distancing-approved alternative to playing the card game in person. In order to play, you’ll need to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/">download Tabletop Simulator</a> from the Steam games library—a license for Tabletop Simulator goes for about $20 USD—then visit <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=286160">the Workshop page</a>. </p> 
                <p>There have been other implementations of the PACG posted on the Workshop in the past, such as the highly scripted version created by Steam user waterfoul, and I would recommend you check out several to determine which you prefer. However, the one I’m going to point you to today is one that I have built out over the past few months, appropriately titled <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2068179987" target="_blank">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society (Sanctioned Implementation)</a>. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InitialLoad.png" target="_blank"><img width="60%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InitialLoad.png" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">The table is neat and tidy, for the moment…</p>
                </div> 
                <p>This implementation has very little scripted functionality built in. The functions it has are meant to make it easier to deal with things like building decks and cleaning up the game at the end of a scenario. It includes all the cards from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7"><em>Core Set</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a>, the standalone adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor"><em>A Night at Bloodthorne Manor</em></a>, and the Adventurer’s Packs that were described on a <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3k&amp;page=2?Introducing-Adventurer-s-Packs-for-the">blog a few months ago</a> with which to build out your character’s deck.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_AdventurersPack.png" target="_blank"><img width="60%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_AdventurersPack.png" alt="Adventurers packs"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">So many choices! How can I choose just three packs?</p>
                </div> 
                <p>I have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1xr4oY_OtJInFi2GLuOuzDnXlkzEubU9ggd9TjAZVA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google doc with lots of instructions</a> on how to get started, so I won’t get into all that here. Instead, I’ll show a few screenshots of what you’ll see in-game, and discuss a few useful features—as well as a few important limitations—of playing in this format.</p> 
                <p><b>Useful Features:</b></p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Location setup is quick.</b> Once you place your locations on the board, just click the Build Locations button, and the game will pull random cards from the vault (the piles on the left of the game board) in the right numbers based on the location size you specify.</li> 
                 <li><b>Rolling dice is intuitive.</b> No need to write up macros or learn some complicated dice-rolling language. There are infinite bags of each type of standard dice along the top of the table. Grab a set for yourself. When you’re ready to roll them, I recommend highlighting all the dice before you toss them (by clicking and dragging a box around them). Pick them all up and toss them (lightly) across the table, and let the game’s physics engine do the work for you! If you highlighted the dice, after the roll, you can just mouse over any of the dice and the game will tell you the total! You can also just highlight dice and hit the ‘r’ button, but I’ll admit it’s not quite as satisfying as tossing the dice a bit.</li> 
                 <li><b>It’s easy to upgrade and save your character.</b> When you finish a scenario and are ready to use one of your hero points for a feat on your character card, all you have to do is open the Decals menu (it’s a button along the left side of the screen that looks like a square stamper with a handle), choose the checkmark stamp, and drop it right onto your character card. If you make a mistake, just click the stamp you placed again with the Decal tool, and it will disappear and you can try again.</li> 
                 <li><b>Cleanup at the end of the scenario is quick.</b> Once players have chosen any deck upgrades they want, just drop any unused cards onto the game board and click Clean Up Board. The game will sort all the cards back into the correct decks in the vault.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_ThreeButtons.png" target="_blank"><img width="60%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_ThreeButtons.png" alt="Three Buttons"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">The three colored buttons (Build Hourglass, Build Locations, and Clean Up Board) make life so much easier.</p>
                </div> 
                <p><b>Challenges:</b></p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Only the newest cards are available.</b> At the moment, we haven’t imported any of the older Adventure Path boxes (such as Rise of the Runelords or Skull and Shackles), so you’re limited to scenarios that use the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> cards. However, there are a lot of scenarios for just those sets, including the storybooks that come with those boxes, <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pacg/pacs/year6">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society season 6</a>, the standalone adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor"><em>A Night at Bloodthorne Manor</em></a>, and the short goblin-themed adventure <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes"><em>We Be Heroes</em></a>? So don’t worry about running out of options too quickly!</li> 
                 <li><b>Finding a game can be difficult.</b> There are a few different ways for players to join a game that you’re hosting, but sometimes they’re not incredibly intuitive. When you create a multiplayer table, make sure to give it a descriptive name AND a password. Players can use the Join button to find your game and join it. You can also invite players to your game’s lobby through the Steam Friends interface, but they will still need to know the password for your game.</li> 
                 <li><b>You can’t easily import an existing character</b>. At the moment, there’s no easy way to pull in an existing character deck, so if you’re playing with a new box runner, be sure to have your full deck list ready before the game starts so that you can quickly build your deck from the cards in the supply (along the left side of the table). You’ll also need to check off any feats that your character already possesses.</li> 
                 <li><b>It’s easy to mess things up</b>. Because the scripting that I’ve built is so light, it also means there is very little error checking. For example, if you click Build Locations twice, the game doesn’t know that you already built the locations, so you get double the number of cards you’re supposed to have in each location. Please be cautious when using features like these.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>Please try out the Tabletop Simulator implementation if it interests you. You can email suggestions, bug reports, or other feedback to me at <a href="mailto:cartmanbeck@orgplayonline.com">cartmanbeck@orgplayonline.com</a>.</p> 
                <h3><a href="http://acg.orgplayonline.com" target="_blank">acg.orgplayonline.com</a></h3> 
                <p>Next up is a free interface that was originally built to play using play-by-post on the forums; it has recently been upgraded to be more useful for real-time gaming. If you’re not yet familiar with <a href="http://acg.orgplayonline.com">acg.orgplayonline.com</a>, go check it out, make yourself an account, and create a character profile. </p> 
                <p>This interface is less of a virtual tabletop in that it doesn’t use any visual representations of cards. Instead, sections of the webpage provide all the needed information for a scenario, and then information on each location that’s been added to the table. In order for a player to explore the next card in a location for their character, they would click on the little “binoculars” button on that location to bring up a modal box showing the text of the top card. There are options to acquire, banish, or move cards. The best thing about this interface is that it costs players and box runners nothing to use (though we still expect at least one person at the table to own the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>)!</p>

                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InfoScreen.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="60%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InfoScreen.jpg" alt="Main info screen"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">This is where the magic happens.</p>
                </div> 
                <p><b>Useful Features: </b></p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Automatic location building</b>. Like the Tabletop Simulator implementation, once you’ve set up the game and added the needed locations, it’s a single click to build them all out: just go to Game Setup → Build Locations, and the site will find the correct cards from our database and add them to the locations.</li> 
                 <li><b>Access to any card</b>. Unlike Tabletop Simulator, the database that this site was built around includes essentially every card ever created for PACG. This means you can run games from <em>any</em> Adventure Path box and <em>any</em> PACS season!</li> 
                 <li><b>Realtime and asynchronous play options</b>. In Tabletop Simulator, the box runner is hosting the game’s table in real time, so if the host isn’t present, the game isn’t either. Here, everything happening is held in a dedicated database, so players can jump in and take a turn whenever it’s convenient for them. If your group has trouble finding a single multi-hour stretch to all be online, you can run your game over multiple days, using a text-based messaging system like Discord or Slack to let players know when it’s their turn. </li> 
                </ul> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_Locations.png" target="_blank"><img width="60%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_Locations.png" alt=""></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">This is from a play-by-post game I’ve been running for about a month. Great players!</p>
                </div> 
                <p><b>Challenges:</b></p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Clunky interface</b>. As the person who wrote most of the code for this site, I am the first to admit that I am not a professional software engineer. (We do now have one working on the site, and he has made <em>incredible</em> improvements to it in just a few months!) The site isn’t well-suited to a phone-size screen, and hitting the wrong button can cause major problems. For these reasons, I recommend that you leave any functions other than examining and exploring cards on your own turn to the box runner. Bug reports can be submitted to <a href="mailto:acgbugs@orgplayonline.com">acgbugs@orgplayonline.com</a>. </li> 
                 <li><b>No character deck tracking</b>. Though we hope to add it eventually, at the moment players must keep track of their character decks through some other method. (Using your own physical cards are an option, of course; you can also try a community-built Google Sheets character tracker built by several community members—<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7xuo7gfAtykLJSI1jDsFi86Y1DiiOSOafZrvJWX560/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here’s one of the most recent versions</a>; many players have made their own <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arWgvvnnRztmPqSwtYGpIcnMwgy5gF0ARY2ggR7qIpU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">modifications/versions of it</a>. There are detailed instructions on how to use sheets like this on the <a href="https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge">Flaxseed On Deck Play-by-Post Lodge page</a>.)</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>That’s a lot of information for one blog. PaizoCon Online is going to test these systems in ways that they’ve never been tested before, so there will be some growing pains. I hope you can see, however, the hard work and love that the VO corps have put into making this game as enjoyable an experience online as it is in real life, and I look forward to seeing all of you signed up for games at <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online, May 26–31</a>!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">I hope everyone’s staying safe as it starts to be spring here in Seattle. In case you missed it, GM registrations have recently opened for <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh77?PaizoCon-Online-Will-Be-Scheduled-For-May-2631">PaizoCon Online</a>, and we’ve already seen a ton of people signing up to run Organized Play adventures online. If you’re curious about trying out a Pathfinder Society (second edition) scenario at PaizoCon but aren’t sure what to expect, we’ve put together a sample encounter to give you a taste of a typical encounter found in organized play (and a preview of a few creatures from the upcoming Bestiary 2!). Everything you need to play is linked below!</p>

                <p>“Lately, a series of mysterious fires have plagued towns across the Varisian coast. Valais Durant, leader of the Radiant Oath faction of the Pathfinder Society, suspects the fires to be deliberately set, and she dispatched a team of Pathfinders to investigate the situation and offer aid. After some investigation in town, the PCs discovered signs of a mysterious accelerant and tracked it to a clearing in the woods, where they hope to confront those responsible.”</p> 
                <p>This encounter would appear in an adventure for 3rd-level Pathfinder characters. If you don’t have a 3rd-level character, remember you can always use an iconic pregenerated character in Society play! You can download the pregen file <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">here</a>.</p>

To create the map, lay out each flip tile so that the label in the lower-left corner matches the location on the map below—for example, rotate the piece marked 42A clockwise so that the label is in the upper left.</p>

                <p>Some ifrit pyrochemists and their mephit familiars have been using this clearing as a base of operations as they set fires from town to town. When the PCs enter, one pyrochemist is standing at the spot marked with a <b>P</b>, observing a magical array that imprisons an ember fox—a usually benevolent fire spirit—that the pyrochemists have been draining of elemental essence to empower their reagents. The pyrochemist attacks as soon as he notices the PCs. The sounds of combat alert the other enemies in the storehouse, who emerge at the beginning of the next turn. The pyrochemists attempt to use their alchemist’s fire and smokesticks to bombard the PCs from a distance and drink their elixirs of life if they are too injured, while the mephits engage in melee, unaffected by the smoke and flame. The mephits fight until destroyed, but the pyrochemists attempt to surrender if reduced to 5 HP or less. </p>

                 <p style="color:white;"><b><u>Scaling the Encounter</u></b><br> This encounter is written for four 3rd-level PCs, but if you have more PCs, you can adjust the encounter with Challenge Points. Challenge Points are used by the Pathfinder Society to scale encounters for parties with up to six members or whose members are of different levels, allowing a greater variety of tables. For this encounter, use the following adjustments:</p> 
                 <p style="color:white;"><b>10–11 Challenge Points (5 PCs): Add one pyrochemist to the encounter.<br> 12–13 Challenge Points (6 PCs): Add one pyrochemist and one fire mephit to the encounter.</b></p>
                </div> 
                <p><b>The Trapped Elemental:</b> As the ember fox lashes out against the walls of its prison, flames siphon from its body into various glowing vials and reagents. The array can be Disabled with two successful checks, using Thievery to scratch out the runes on the stones (DC 19) or using Arcana (DC 19), Nature, Occultism, or Religion (all DC 21) to disrupt the magic; as usual, this takes two actions, has the manipulate trait, and a critical success counts as two successes. Once the array has been Disabled, the grateful ember fox aids the party in combat against the arsonists—though it is weakened by its imprisonment and cannot fight directly, it stays near PCs and protects them with its Cloak in Embers reaction when they are targeted by fire attacks.</p> 
                <p><b>Treasure:</b> The storehouse contains four flasks of lesser alchemist’s fire. This represents 1 Treasure Bundle. Treasure Bundles are used by the Pathfinder Society to easily track how much treasure the party has accumulated and ensure that all adventurers walk away with the same amount of gold—most scenarios have 10 Treasure Bundles to find! </p>

                <blockquote>
                 <p>The Banshee FA (fast attack) frigate is a well-known Steward vessel produced under contract with ATech, manufacturers of the Immortal. Although on the small side, this starship is designed to be fast, stealthy, and hard hitting. The standard crew comprises a half-dozen well-trained Stewards, but Banshees have seen field duty with as few as two people—an arrangement made easier by the fact that the ship’s weapons are concentrated in a turret and one forward mount. The typical Banshee can also carry a small contingent of marines for boarding actions and airborne assaults.</p>

                 <p><em>“You find scars and bruises on your body but don’t recall an injury, enter a room and forget why you’re there, surf holovids for what feels like only five minutes but an hour has passed, or are quite certain you completed a task only to find it unfinished. These are symptoms of an encounter with the grays. They involve themselves in every aspect of your life, but you’ve never heard of them. They watch you constantly, but you’ve never seen them. They’re the nightmare of an intruder that you can’t recall. They prod and probe, but you forget. Remember! Make yourself REMEMBER!<br> —From the personal journal of Steward Reyard Maldun</em></p> 
                 <p>The following are excerpts from the personal journal of Steward Reyard Maldun, discovered in a locked box behind a false panel in an apartment leased to “K. Carlock” almost 2 years after Reyard’s disappearance on 2 Rova, 317 ag.</p> 
                 <p>WHO ARE THE GRAYS?<br> That’s the first question most people ask: Who are they? Let’s start with what we know. Grays are named for their gray‐skinned bodies because no one knows what else to call them. They have a basic humanoid shape with a symmetrical body, a single pair of arms, and a single pair of legs. Their hands and feet are strikingly similar to those of humans, though generally smaller and more delicate, with elongated fingers. Their stature is like that of a ysoki or a human child, but each has a bulbous head on a small, wiry frame. A gray’s face is a stoic mask with two relatively large, black, emotionless eyes and an almost nonexistent nose with two nostrils no larger than a data port. Their mouths are tiny and slit‐like, which makes one wonder what they eat.</p> 
                 <p>Grays have no trouble maintaining balance with precise grace, despite their over‐large heads. Reports say they sometimes stand in perfect stillness for several moments before acting all at once, each movement perfect as if choreographed and well rehearsed. The movement of a gray is so deliberate and agile, it would rival that of a finely tuned robot, yet their flesh is certainly organic.”</p>

                 <p>“Look, no one cares what happened to the researchers who previously owned this engine. Y’know why? Because this thing stops freakin’ time, that’s why! Picture this. You’re cruisin’ through the Diaspora in your Vagabond, just mindin’ your own business, when your sensors ping a gunship filled with pirates screamin’ in at full burn, gyrolasers hot. But you got this, because you made a savvy purchase from ol’ Pogo before you left this station. Your engineer turns one lousy knob, and boom! That enemy ship locks in place like it’s caught in a tractor beam! Meanwhile, your crew’s buzzin’ around the deck as if you spiked their morning coffee with liquid thasteron!

                 <p>While modern scientific and engineering knowledge might appear to cover nearly all aspects of life, hundreds of intellectual questions remain unanswered. Though Triune granted access to the blueprints of Drift technology, no one has yet ascertained why using this technology rends a portion of a random plane into the Drift. The union of magic and technology has solved many modern problems, but travelers continue to experience dilemmas related to perfecting interspecies communication, understanding astronomical phenomena, overcoming biological diseases that may accompany first contact with alien creatures, and myriad other obstacles.</p> 
                 <p>When mainstream science is unable to explain the origins of mysterious phenomena, the curious open their minds to more radical explanations, hoping to find even a trace of plausible explanation in an expanse of doubt. These practitioners often participate in what some call “fringe science,” a generic term for fields of study that diverge from the theories generally considered to be rudimentary by experts within a specific discipline. To traditional scientists, fringe science is a fool’s errand, as it usually relies on premises that may have been previously refuted and can often be performed by someone with no academic background. While this is true in some cases, some fringe scientists use methods that are just as statistically significant and reproducible as their more traditional counterparts. Fringe scientists often remind others that many disciplines, such as interplanetary communication or cybernetic and biological augmentation, were once considered little more than fantasies before true genius unlocked the power behind their mysteries.</p> 
                 <p>The following disciplines represent fringe science practiced within the Pact Worlds and systems beyond, as well as some equipment associated with these fields.”</p>

                 <p><em>Local superstitions on the frozen world of Mobulen tell of a three-hooved “devil” that appears in the night and moves inexorably in a single direction, charging over rocky terrain and walking straight up the sides of buildings. Bad luck and worse fall upon those who stand in the creature’s way, especially those who wear heavy metal armor. Records show that multiple Mobulen devil sightings have occurred simultaneously across the planet, with each creature moving toward magnetic north. Unfortunately scholars have yet to determine the true nature of these migrations.<br> —Excerpt from Galactic Tales and Legends by Dr. Borogrand Traceter</em></p>

                 <p>Stopgap is a dwarf planet in orbit around Foergrim, a yellow star in Near Space. The Foergrim system has no full planets, only several clouds of planetoids and asteroid belts that form rings and vague orbital clouds around the star. Stopgap is the largest object in the system—it’s just barely big enough to round itself out through gravitational forces. It has no atmosphere or native life of its own, but it does contain the manufactured corridors and chambers of a small base.</p>

                <p>The Crew:<br> Established in August 2018, the Fantastic Worlds crew includes Game Dad (GM) Dustin Alexander who harries the team via the machinations of the Witch-Queens of Irrisen in Reign of Winter, Jess Negin takes the reigns as the nefarious Ring Master (GM) in Extinction Curse, Abbie Lammel, Angel Espinoza, and Logan Mayne-Rizzi—who just try to keep their characters alive.</p> 
                <p>Story First, Math Second:<br> Fantastic Worlds Productions is composed of five friends who every other week unleash their overactive imaginations for the benefit of all. They strive to create both an intricate and personal experience in the Lost Omens setting via nuanced characters with complex motivations and even more complex interpersonal relationships. Drama runs high with this group whether the dice fall in their favor or not!</p> 
                <p>Diversity In Front &amp; Behind The Mic:<br> One of the pillars of Fantastic Worlds Productions is their dedication to inclusivity. Women, People of Color, and members of the LGBT+ community are found in the characters played and the players themselves.</p> 
                <p>Fantastic Worlds Productions invites you to join them in this next step of their journey. Engage with them on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/fantasticpods?lang=en" target="_blank"> @fantasticpods</a>, Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fantasticworldspod/?hl=en" target="_blank">@fantasticworldspod</a>, on their dedicated Discord server, and in their subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticWorldsPod/hot/" target="_blank">r/FantasticWorldsPod</a>.

                <p>We know many Pathfinder players are roleplaying game enthusiasts and many play multiple games—regardless of the edition. And it is always more impactful to see or hear people having fun with your product than to tell people it’s fun; show, don’t tell. So Paizo welcomes the experienced, diverse voices of Fantastic Worlds Productions and we can’t wait to see what stories they tell next!</p>

                <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p> 
                <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p> 
                <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> 
                 <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> 
                 <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li> 
                 <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">The original, excellent, and slightly too wordy PACG cleric.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>Because it was our first Adventure Path, <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> was establishing baselines both for iconic characters and also for character classes. Anyone who’s played the Pathfinder RPG for a while knows that the cleric is a very versatile class; to translate to the PACG, that meant giving Kyra both a d12 Wisdom and a good Divine bonus, making her a very competent spellcaster. To distinguish her from other primary spellcasters like Ezren, her cards list is more varied. In practice, Kyra’s d12+2 can cast and recharge spells as effectively as Ezren, but with 3 to 5 spells in her deck, she’s going to use a variety of methods to solve problems, including skills, powers, and cards of all types.</p> 
                <p>We also give her the original built-in healing power (thankfully, we were eventually able to clarify the wording). In this case Kyra can spend her explorations to heal someone (including herself) at her location. This became the fundamental cleric-healing power, later used by several characters. While keeping healing “local” seems obvious to people familiar with Pathfinder, in PACG it adds a subtle, important effect: when people get low on “health” (cards in their deck), on their turns, they come to Kyra for help. In practice, this often means negotiating where they want to take their turns so that they can be in the right place—i.e. Kyra’s—on her turn. Since Kyra has a large number of blessings in her deck, she can choose when to use them to help herself, to help others, and also when they can allow her to both heal vulnerable party members and still make progress exploring the scenario. As players gain mastery with the game, they learn that it’s important to figure out when to ask for help, and also how to not waste Kyra’s entire turn keeping them alive—classic shorter-term to longer-term systems mastery.</p> 
                <p>Kyra is also especially good against Undead, as you might expect from a devotee of the sun god. Her second power makes her better at defeating Undead (with weapon, spell, or raw skill), and also helps her avoid nasty effects from before- and after-acting powers. Adding the Magic trait is important for dealing with Incorporeal Undead. Early in her adventuring career, this can be especially helpful when big weapons fail to get rid of pernicious undead such as Ghosts and Shadows. When she gets a role card, Kyra could choose to focus on various aspects of Sarenrae as either a Healer, focusing on keeping everyone (including herself) going, or an Exorcist, leaning more into the smashy-smitey side of things.</p> 
                <p>During <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we rested Kyra (be honest, if you had to choose a character to “go piratical” for a bit, would you pick Kyra over <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lg6s?Meet-the-Iconics-Oloch">Oloch</a> or <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lcs8?Meet-the-Iconics-Feiya">Feiya</a>? Neither did we.) The next version of Kyra was in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy97ia"><em>Cleric Class Deck</em></a>, where she strikes a strong balance between martial and magical. As such, her skills and powers are quite different.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Same great cards list, brand new sword flex.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>Class Deck Kyra is notably better with weapons, especially Swords, while she’s still able to marshal some potent divine impact. If you wanted to bring her into Skull &amp; Shackles, she’s also pretty capable with navigation and swimming via her Survival skill. Her healing power takes a small hit in flexibility, but clever players can usually work around it. When she gains a role card, she can choose between Fireflower and Wastelander. The former focuses on the more aggressive aspects of the Church of the Dawnflower, while the latter helps Kyra and her companions get around in the world.</p> 
                <p>When it came time to put together a group of characters for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9a46"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>, we (okay, I) wanted Kyra to be involved in the adventure into the Worldwound for two big reasons: one, I thought it was an excellent fit for the character; and two, I wanted to try a new approach to healing. For facing off against lots of demons, we built a Kyra who is expert at dealing with Undead and Demons, and a master at wielding the Healing Flame. She’s still capable of wading into melee with sword and armor, but she has a larger selection of spells than previous versions. </p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Bringing the Everlight into the demonic darkness.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>In this incarnation, rather than spending her explorations healing people, Kyra instead adds a small bit of healing to her divine channeling. This changes up the play dynamics of groups facing a significant challenge, which is something that Wrath of the Righteous <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhm4?How-Hard-Should-it-Be-Adventure-Card-Game">definitely can bring to the table</a>. People who were big fans of Kyra gave me a pretty wide array of reactions at first, but as they gained more experience with her, they usually found her to be effective and fun. When she gains a role card, you can choose between Dawnflower’s Flare, which focuses on the offensive power of divine fire, and Everlight’s Grace, which focuses on the healing and protective elements of Sarenrae’s church.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>For the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7"><em>PACG Core Set</em></a>, we wanted to return to the “core” expression of the cleric. We adjusted to some of the changes from the Second Edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, but also brought the things we’d learned from publishing roughly a dozen different clerics for PACG (and at least twice that many “healer type” characters). We struck a middle ground between her strongest and weakest melee prowess, alongside a very strong divine spellcasting ability and a strong personality. Her built-in healing power still requires that you be in the same place, for a small healing effect that doesn’t consume your ability to progress through the scenario. If your situation requires bigger healing effects, you can invest in boons that provide them. </p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">These two images need to be remade, as the set icon in the placed images above is messed up.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>She retains a version of her offensive channeling power against Outsiders and Undead, but this version can be used to help herself and others, again reflecting a change in approach from Pathfinder. The other skills that seemed especially appropriate were moved to a power feat, making them a player choice. Her deck list is adjusted slightly, but still represents a fairly even spread across all card types—Kyra has weapons and armor, spells and blessings, and items and allies. (And introducing the terms “heal” and “local” let us slash the word count of her second power.)</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Friendly friend, or fighter of foes.</p>
                </div> 
                <p>When she gains a role card (level 3 in the Core Set), she can choose between Dawnseeker and Smiter, effectively gaining a greater specialization in either the helpful or aggressive aspects of her faith. As a Dawnseeker, Kyra helps everyone local (including herself) with desirable boons, and is effective against more kinds of harm. Kyra the Smiter instead is helpful and effective against a larger variety of foes, including using Core’s new avenge mechanic and helping make sure that Kyra is nearly always ready for battle.</p> 
                <p>That’s it for Kyra today. This post is longer and more detailed than some of the others I’ve done lately. I’m curious if people are interested in the extra depth, if there are other topics they’d like to see (either in addition or instead), and if, like me, you all correctly believe that clerics are the best. :-)</p>
