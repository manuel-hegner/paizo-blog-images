  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>For a moment, everyone fell quiet at once,\
  \ and Kagur heard the wind howling outside the Blacklions' meeting tent, a long,\
  \ peak-roofed shelter pieced together from the tanned hides of mammoths, giant sloths,\
  \ and other enormous beasts. Then the wood burning in one of the fire pits <i>cracked.</i>\
  \ Yellow flame leaped, sparks flew upward, and as if that had broken a spell, the\
  \ whole tribe resumed its clamor.</p> \n    <p>Annik struck up a fresh tune on a\
  \ harp shaped from caribou antler and strung with reindeer gut.</p> \n    <p>Grinning\
  \ like one of the snow foxes that had given its fur to make his tunic, Roga told\
  \ a joke. Kagur couldn't catch it all, but like most of Roga's pun-laden humor,\
  \ it must have been awful. It elicited groans and prompted Taresk to peg a well-gnawed\
  \ elk bone across the trestle table at him.</p> \n    <p>Zonug held up his silver-chased\
  \ drinking horn, and eight-year-old Dron came scurrying. When the boy failed to\
  \ fill the vessel all the way to the brim, Zonug made a show of peering inside it,\
  \ mock scowled, and bellowed, \"By Gorum's blood-red eyes! Who's pouring here, Ganef\
  \ of the Fivespears?\"</p> \n    <p>That sally <i>did</i> make people laugh. The\
  \ chieftain of the Fivespears tribe was much disliked for his stingy, conniving\
  \ ways.</p> \n    <p>In fact, Kagur reflected, Ganef was the antithesis of all that\
  \ a proper Kellid chieftain should be—which was to say, the antithesis of her father.\
  \ Sitting straight and tall, the gray eyes of a Blacklion keen and his mane of hair\
  \ raven-dark despite his advancing years, Jorn turned and told Eovath to tap another\
  \ cask of Tian brandy.</p> \n    <p> Even more than their generous, valorous leader,\
  \ or the preserved skull of the gigantic man-eating cave lion their first chieftain\
  \ had slain generations before, Eovath was the emblem of Blacklion pride, for only\
  \ the bravest tribes captured and adopted frost giants. Twice as tall as a man but\
  \ with a build so thick and muscular he nonetheless looked squat, Eovath had long,\
  \ straw-colored hair, eyes to match, and skin the blue of the sky at dusk. To Kagur,\
  \ his features looked less brutish and more intelligent than those of other frost\
  \ giants, and she sometimes wondered if the love and care of humans had so improved\
  \ him that the benefit even showed in his face.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \  <br> How could Eovath do such a thing?\n    </div> \n    <p>For much of his life,\
  \ Eovath had sat by Jorn at the head of the table. He needed to be where the ceiling\
  \ was highest to keep his head from bumping against it. Still, when he rose in response\
  \ to his foster father's command, it did anyway, even though he didn't straighten\
  \ up all the way. Moving with care so as not to jostle anyone or anything, he picked\
  \ up the brandy cask. His prodigious strength and enormous hands managed it easily.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Kagur considered staying and sharing the brandy. After all, the liquor\
  \ and wine that came over the Crown of the World were rare treats. If the tribe\
  \ hadn't fared exceptionally well hunting this past season, amassing fine wolf and\
  \ bear pelts and caribou hides in abundance, her father couldn't have afforded to\
  \ trade for it. It would certainly warm the blood on a frigid winter night.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But she didn't actually need drink to warm her, or the flames in the\
  \ fire pits, either. Stroking her thigh beneath the table, Dolok's hand was more\
  \ than sufficient.</p> \n    <p>She liked Dolok. He had a quick, crooked smile,\
  \ and was nimble and clever enough to make her work at sword practice. He obviously\
  \ saw something to like in her as well, and they'd grown amorous in recent weeks,\
  \ kissing and fondling until she made him stop.</p> \n    <p>She'd already decided\
  \ that tonight would be the night they wouldn't stop. Once the feast was in full\
  \ swing and everyone was tipsy, they'd slip away unnoticed.</p> \n    <p>She'd just\
  \ as soon avoid the bawdy jokes of the rest of the tribe, good-natured though they\
  \ would be. And as for her father, well, it was one of the great mysteries of life\
  \ how he knew perfectly well that she was a grown woman—indeed, one of his ablest\
  \ warriors and hunters—yet could only see her as a fragile little girl whenever\
  \ lovemaking was in the offing.</p> \n    <p>She nodded toward the nearest exit.\
  \ Dolok grinned in response. They rose and made their way toward the end of the\
  \ tent.</p> \n    <p>As Dolok untied the rawhide knots that secured the flap, Kagur\
  \ glanced around to see if their departure really was going unremarked. Pouring\
  \ brandy into the leather wineskins in the hands of Dron and the other child servers,\
  \ Eovath looked back at her.</p> \n    <p>She might have expected a smirk, a wink,\
  \ or even a reflection of their father's characteristic frown of disapproval. Instead,\
  \ he looked ...relieved? About what?</p> \n    <p>Dolok pulled back the flap, and\
  \ a blast of cold wind and swirling snowflakes blew the question out of her mind.\
  \ She hastily followed him out into the night.</p> \n    <p>The snowdrifts were\
  \ halfway to her knees and crunched as she waded through them. Clouds covered the\
  \ moon and stars, and the other tents were merely shadows in the dark. So were the\
  \ mammoths standing shaggy and stolid, impervious to the worst the blizzard could\
  \ do.</p> \n    <p>Kagur took Dolok's hand and drew him into a supply tent. \"Whew!\"\
  \ he said, smiling. \"It's not much warmer in here!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know what\
  \ to do about that,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>They clung together and kissed for\
  \ a while. His mouth tasted of the bison he'd eaten and the ale he'd drunk.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She started unlacing and unbuckling his clothing of fur, hide, and leather,\
  \ and he did the same for her. When their garments were open, and they could touch\
  \ in ways they hadn't before, they lay down together.</p> \n    <p>At that point,\
  \ he took the lead, kissing and caressing. Content for the moment to be passive,\
  \ she closed her eyes and enjoyed it. </p> \n    <p>Someone screamed.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"What was that?\" Kagur gasped.</p> \n    <p>Dolok lifted his head. \"What?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Someone cried out.\"</p> \n    <p>He grinned. \"That was you, honeycomb.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Someone <i>else</i> cried out.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then it was the\
  \ wind. It's howling like a pack of wolves.\"</p> \n    <p>He was right. Perhaps\
  \ her imagination was playing tricks on her. Surely no enemy would come raiding\
  \ on a night like this, and if one did, the mammoths would trumpet a warning.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She smiled. \"The wind. Yes. Sorry.\" She settled back, inviting him\
  \ to resume his attentions. But as soon as he obliged, she heard another shriek.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When she tensed, Dolok frowned. \"What now?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You must have heard it that time.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then my\
  \ ears are sharper than yours. Get up!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Curse it, Kagur!\" But he\
  \ did as instructed.</p> \n    <p>When they mostly had their garments refastened\
  \ against the cold, she hurried back out into the night, and he followed. On first\
  \ inspection, the meeting tent looked no different than before.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  See?\" Dolok said. \"Everything's fine.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Maybe.\" But she led him\
  \ onward anyway.</p> \n    <p>Another scream shrilled, louder and unmistakable now\
  \ that they were closer.</p> \n    <p>\"Lord in Iron!\" Dolok said.</p> \n    <p>Floundering\
  \ in the snow, they ran to the tent flap. Kagur tugged the edge back, and they peered\
  \ through the crack.</p> \n    <p>Every human in the tent was down, either slumped\
  \ across one of the tables or sprawled on the ground. Some moaned or stirred, barely,\
  \ like swatted flies still clinging to a trace of life. Some were utterly still,\
  \ and a number of the latter group lay hacked and dismembered in pools of blood.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Grinning, his yellow eyes shining like molten gold in his blue face,\
  \ Eovath was doing the chopping with a huge axe the Blacklions had taken as a trophy\
  \ on the same day they'd seized the giant himself. Gore dripped from the weapon's\
  \ edge and stained his arms all the way to the elbows.</p> \n    <p>This is a dream,\
  \ Kagur thought. He <i>couldn't </i>do this. He's my brother.</p> \n    <p>Then\
  \ Eovath turned toward Annik, who lay on her side with her fingers still tangled\
  \ in her harp strings, and raised the axe. Kagur's incredulity shattered. This horrible\
  \ thing <i>was</i> happening, and if she didn't intervene immediately, Eovath would\
  \ murder Annik and then move on to another victim, and another after that, until\
  \ no human in the tent was left alive.</p> \n    <p>But what could Kagur do? Kellids\
  \ were a warrior race, and none more than the Blacklion tribe, but even so, neither\
  \ she nor Dolok had carried weapons to the feast.</p> \n    <p>The only option was\
  \ to <i>talk</i> to Eovath. Talk, stall him, and hope that, as she'd always believed,\
  \ he loved his foster sister.</p> \n    <p>\"Arm yourself,\" she whispered to Dolok.\
  \ \"Take him from behind.\" She gave him a shove to start him moving.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Then she yanked the gap between the flap and the rest of the tent wider and\
  \ squirmed through. \"Wait!\" she shouted.</p> \n    <p>Eovath pivoted and looked\
  \ her over. Then he sighed and lowered the axe slightly. \"When you left without\
  \ drinking the poison, I thought you were out of it,\" he rumbled in a voice deeper\
  \ than any human's. \"I thought the Rough Beast had granted me a favor.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"'The Rough Beast?'\" That made no sense, either. The Blacklions had raised\
  \ Eovath to revere Gorum and, to a lesser extent, Desna, the same as they did. Only\
  \ the worst and maddest people worshiped Rovagug, god of annihilation and wrath—\
  a being so mighty and infinitely malevolent that, at the dawn of time, both good\
  \ and evil deities had combined forces to imprison him, lest he destroy the world.\
  \ Even that hadn't rendered him entirely powerless, and from time to time he still\
  \ created earthquakes and terrible beasts to ravage the lands of men.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The frost giant nodded. \"He talks to me. In my dreams, mostly, but sometimes\
  \ I hear him even when I'm awake.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How could that be?\" Kagur asked.\
  \ Blood dripped from the edge of a table. Across the tent, someone retched. \"You're\
  \ not a shaman.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Eovath said, \"but I will be. It's part of\
  \ his plan for me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Listen,\" Kagur said. \"You're confused, and\
  \ it's making you do bad things. You're killing your own tribe. Your family.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Eovath spat. \"My family died a long time ago.\"</p> \n    <p>It took\
  \ her a moment to guess what he meant. \"The other giants? Your blood kin?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Who else? You've heard the story often enough. How your father and\
  \ the rest of the Blacklions slaughtered my tribe and carried me off into slavery.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You're not a sla—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't lie to me!\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>She took a breath. \"All right. It's true, that's what they call it. But Father\
  \ raised you like his own son.\"</p> \n    <p>\"To make me forget my real father\
  \ and turn me into a traitor to my own kind.\"</p> \n    <p>Kagur felt like she\
  \ was saying all the wrong things. What did she know about reasoning with lunatics?\
  \ Where in the name of keen iron was Dolok?</p> \n    <p>\"Eovath,\" she said, \"\
  brother ...humans raid giants, but giants raid humans, too. It's just the way things\
  \ are.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But not the way they have to be.\"</p> \n    <p>She hesitated.\
  \ \"I don't understand.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Down in the depths, a sun shines in the\
  \ darkness, and a pyramid rises under the sun. That's where I'll find what I need\
  \ to do my work.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What does that mean?\"</p> \n    <p>He grinned.\
  \ \"I don't know. But the Rough Beast will guide me, through the Earthnavel and\
  \ beyond.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Can't you hear how crazy you sound? But if you want to\
  \ go on a journey, just do it. You don't need to kill all the people who love you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Yes, I do. Rovagug wouldn't help me if I didn't sacrifice to him,\
  \ and even if he would, the spirits of my <i>real</i> tribe are calling out for\
  \ vengeance. They won't be satisfied until every human is driven from the tundra.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She stared into his yellow eyes. \"Even me?\"</p> \n    <p>He winced.\
  \ \"I told you I wanted to spare you. I still do. Just go to one of the other tents\
  \ and don't come out till morning.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You know I can't do that.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I suppose I knew you wouldn't.\" He lifted the axe and advanced\
  \ on her, stepping over the dead and the helpless, leaving footprints in the pools\
  \ of blood.</p> \n    <p>Kagur reached past a corpse with a smashed skull for a\
  \ wooden platter. The grilled ribs of an aurochs tumbled off as she grabbed it up\
  \ and skimmed it at Eovath's head. Not even breaking stride, he knocked it aside\
  \ with a flick of the axe.</p> \n    <p>She grabbed a stool and flung that. He chopped\
  \ and again prevented the blow, but he ended up with the stool stuck on the blade\
  \ of the axe. With a scowl, he started to shake it loose.</p> \n    <p>At that instant,\
  \ when he was at least partly distracted, Kagur grabbed a knife smeared with grease\
  \ and flecks of bear meat. It wasn't a proper weapon, just the kind of tool every\
  \ Kellid carried for eating, mending harness, and whittling tent pegs. But it was\
  \ a length of steel with a point, and she hurled it at Eovath's heart.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>It only had a short distance to travel, but even so, he jerked to the side,\
  \ and the spinning knife only pierced his left biceps. He bellowed, shook the remains\
  \ of the stool off the axe, and charged.</p> \n    <p>With the walls of the tent\
  \ hemming her in, Kagur only had one place to go. She sprang and rolled over the\
  \ tabletop, upsetting trays and dishes in the process. For an instant, she found\
  \ herself gazing into the glazed gray eyes of Roga's severed head, and then momentum\
  \ carried her onward. She tumbled off the other edge of the table into someone's\
  \ lap—she didn't see whose, or if he was alive or dead. He toppled backward, and\
  \ they crashed to the ground together.</p> \n    <p>It knocked the wind out of her,\
  \ but she didn't dare let it slow her down. She scrambled to her feet just as Eovath\
  \ grabbed the long, heavy tabletop between them. With a grunt, he flipped it up\
  \ off the trestles and sent it spinning at her.</p> \n    <p>She flung herself backward,\
  \ and the makeshift weapon just missed her. Unfortunately, it couldn't miss all\
  \ the incapacitated Blacklions sprawled on the ground. A woman cried out as the\
  \ weight smashed down on her.</p> \n    <p>Kagur resisted the urge to look down\
  \ and find out who it was. She kept her eyes on her foe.</p> \n    <p>Who, intentionally\
  \ or not, had just cleared a larger space for the two of them to fight in. With\
  \ bodies, severed limbs, benches, trays, drinking horns, and chunks of roast meat\
  \ strewn about, the footing would be treacherous. But that was true of the rest\
  \ of the tent as well, and maybe with a little more room to maneuver, Kagur could\
  \ use her speed and agility to at least hold out until Dolok returned.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>She glanced at a table next to the open space. She grabbed a long carving\
  \ knife—it verged on being a proper weapon, even though it seemed like a bad joke\
  \ compared to Eovath's axe—for her right hand and somebody else's eating knife for\
  \ her left. Then she edged forward.</p> \n    <p>Her foster brother snorted. \"\
  Truly?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p>She didn't bother to answer with words. She simply\
  \ rushed in, and the axe whirled to meet her. She ducked the horizontal stroke and\
  \ kept coming.</p> \n    <p>The low ceiling was already awkward for Eovath, and\
  \ getting in close seemed the best way to further turn his size into a handicap.\
  \ At that distance, big warriors had difficulty hitting smaller ones.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Or at least that was how it was supposed to work. But Eovath was an expert\
  \ combatant, and after the hundreds of times they'd practiced together, he understood\
  \ exactly what she was doing and why. He strove to keep his distance and, when she\
  \ got close anyway, met her with elbow strikes and jabs with the butt of the axe.\
  \ Meanwhile, his vest of boiled leather stopped her stabs and slashes from reaching\
  \ his vitals. As often as not, the attacks failed to penetrate at all.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Eovath chopped at her head. She stepped back out of range, caught her ankle\
  \ on something, and staggered, struggling not to fall.</p> \n    <p>The giant charged.\
  \ The axe flashed at her, she twisted, and the weapon passed so near that it snagged\
  \ in her mantle and ripped free.</p> \n    <p>Eovath hesitated, as if he imagined\
  \ he'd actually struck her. Kagur recovered her balance and darted in. She stabbed\
  \ his hip where the vest didn't cover and lunged on by.</p> \n    <p>He roared and\
  \ whirled with blood already welling from the puncture. They glared at one another,\
  \ circled, and then he let go of the axe with his left hand and gripped it with\
  \ the right alone.</p> \n    <p>Evidently, Kagur decided, the knife still jutting\
  \ from his left forearm was bothering him. At first, he'd scarcely seemed to notice\
  \ the wound, but now it must be painful enough that he needed to let the damaged\
  \ limb dangle.</p> \n    <p>Which meant Kagur should attack his left side. It would\
  \ be harder for him to swing the axe across his body to hit or block her there.\
  \ Only a little bit harder, but little advantages were all she had.</p> \n    <p>Pivoting,\
  \ fixing her gaze on the crook of his right arm, she raised the carving knife as\
  \ if for a throw. He sneered but also poised himself to bat the blade out of the\
  \ air.</p> \n    <p>Instantly, she charged at his left flank. She'd cut even lower\
  \ this time, hamstring him and dump him on the ground, then slash his throat as\
  \ it came within reach.</p> \n    <p>She could see the sequence of events so vividly\
  \ it was like it was already happening. Perhaps that was why it caught her so completely\
  \ by surprise when Eovath's left arm, the one she'd thought useless, snapped into\
  \ motion.</p> \n    <p>She tried to stop short, but it was too late. Looking like\
  \ a sliver in his enormous hand, Eovath's dagger drove into her midsection. It didn't\
  \ exactly hurt, but she felt a kind of shock all through her body, like she was\
  \ made of shattering ceramic. She stumbled back and fell with the blade still buried\
  \ inside her.</p> \n    <p>She struggled to understand what was happening, but it\
  \ didn't make any sense. She was supposed to outwit and outfight Eovath, and he\
  \ was supposed to fall down. Everything was the wrong way around.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ looked at the hilt of the dagger and realized she knew it well. Her father had\
  \ fashioned it himself, carving it to look like a crouching cave lion and staining\
  \ the pale bone dark. Then he'd presented it to Kagur to give to Eovath as a token\
  \ indicating that the tribe now trusted him with weapons.</p> \n    <p>The giant\
  \ gazed down at her with tears running down his cheeks, washing away the specks\
  \ of gore that had splashed that high. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ could see he meant it, that he truly did love her. Insane though it might be,\
  \ she felt a surge of love in return. Somehow the emotion managed to well up inside\
  \ her without in any way diminishing her horror, grief, and rage. She'd never known\
  \ it was possible to feel so many different things at the same time.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ was still marveling at it when she glimpsed Dolok creeping up behind Eovath. Her\
  \ lover had armed himself with a longsword and a round shield of wood covered in\
  \ leather.</p> \n    <p>The sight of him cut through the daze her injury had engendered.\
  \ She struggled to control her expression lest it change and so warn Eovath of the\
  \ peril at his back.</p> \n    <p>Apparently, she managed it. Her foster brother\
  \ just kept looking down at her and weeping. She felt a kind of vicious eagerness—\
  another emotion to add to the stew—to see Dolok cut him down.</p> \n    <p>But the\
  \ toe of Dolok's boot bumped a wooden cup lying amid the gory litter on the floor.\
  \ The cup rolled and clicked against a platter.</p> \n    <p>It was a tiny sound,\
  \ and Kagur insisted to herself that Eovath wouldn't hear it over the wail of the\
  \ wind outside the tent. But he plainly did, for he started to pivot.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Dolok charged, and his sword flashed yellow in the firelight. Eovath finished\
  \ turning just in time to parry the cut with his axe.</p> \n    <p>The giant struck\
  \ back, and Dolok blocked with his shield. He had it angled to make the axe glance\
  \ off, yet even so, Eovath's strength knocked him backward.</p> \n    <p>Eovath\
  \ advanced and struck again immediately. Step by step, he pushed his opponent back.\
  \ The relentless pressure kept Dolok from making many attacks of his own, and when\
  \ he did, the axe deflected the sword with a clang of steel on steel.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I have to help, Kagur thought. I have to! But when she tried to stand, agony\
  \ ripped through her middle and paralyzed her.</p> \n    <p>With his back nearly\
  \ against the wall of the tent, Dolok finally landed a cut to Eovath's wrist. Then,\
  \ at last, the frost giant faltered. At once, Dolok bellowed, feinted to the knee,\
  \ then spun his sword up for a slash to the torso.</p> \n    <p>Undeceived, Eovath\
  \ stepped in and brushed aside the true attack. Then, not even bothering to chop\
  \ with the edge, he simply rammed the top of the axe into Dolok's face. Bone crunched,\
  \ and the human flew backward into the wall of the tent, bounced back, and collapsed.\
  \ Blood flowed out around his head.</p> \n    <p>When Eovath turned back around,\
  \ his face was once again a mask of malice, without a trace of the love, regret,\
  \ and perhaps even guilt Kagur had seen there previously. He was ready to finish\
  \ off the rest of the tribe, and she was helpless to prevent it.</p> \n    <p>Or\
  \ nearly helpless. She couldn't save anyone else, but if she played dead, perhaps\
  \ he wouldn't feel the need to hack her to pieces.</p> \n    <p>She tried it, and\
  \ rather to her surprise, it worked. Eovath didn't hurt her any further. But she\
  \ still had to endure the thuds of the axe striking home, to listen to the occasional\
  \ truncated cry or whimper without crying out and giving herself away.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>She felt like the slaughter would never end. And in fact, she passed out before\
  \ it did.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want more? Check out <i>Called to Darkness</i>\
