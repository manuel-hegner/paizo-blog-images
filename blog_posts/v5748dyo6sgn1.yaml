  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">From the early Shadow War for Absalom\
  \ to the introduction of factions in Season 3 to the transition to non-national\
  \ factions in Season 6 to the removal of faction missions to Faction Journal Cards\
  \ and Season 9's many storylines, we've seen factions grow and change so much over\
  \ the years. And that's with good reason—factions are one of the unique elements\
  \ that distinguish the Pathfinder Society campaign from the core rules, and they're\
  \ consistently a big part of what inspires and shapes character concepts. There\
  \ was no doubt in our mind that Pathfinder Society's second edition campaign would\
  \ include factions, too.</p> \n    <p>And we've had a lot of inspiration to draw\
  \ from. Not only have we learned a lot of lessons from past Pathfinder Society seasons,\
  \ but we also had the benefit of seeing how Starfinder Society's different approach\
  \ to factions fared. The latter's worked out really well. Not only does it give\
  \ PCs the opportunity represent multiple factions (earning Reputation that determines\
  \ your status within the faction and Fame that lets you buy perks), but it also\
  \ presents factions as interest groups <em>within</em> the Society rather than ambitious\
  \ power brokers <em>beyond</em> the Society, boosting the sense of camaraderie rather\
  \ than highlighting irreconcilable differences.</p> \n    <p>Yet there's one big\
  \ factor that Starfinder Society had that Pathfinder Society doesn't: a clean slate.\
  \ When Thurston Hillman was taking point on Starfinder Society's foundational lore,\
  \ we were inventing new factions from the ground up (and created some pretty great\
  \ characters). For those of us handling Pathfinder Society's transition, we have\
  \ roughly 11 years of history, experience, and emotional connection to consider.\
  \ How do we balance old loyalties with new possibilities?</p> \n    <p>The short\
  \ answer? Through many passionate discussions.</p> \n    <p>The longer answer? We\
  \ sussed out that although there were some first edition factions whose stories\
  \ were wrapping up and others that seem to have many years of fresh stories to tell,\
  \ the notion of transferring only some of the factions or faction leaders into the\
  \ second edition campaign would give a sense of winners and losers. What's more,\
  \ the current factions are very much the products of a decade-long campaign in which\
  \ they've evolved rather organically—trying to fill particular niches so as not\
  \ to overlap too heavily with other factions' goals or pivot too strongly from those\
  \ factions' original goals and character types. So even those factions we thought\
  \ could do well in the new campaign received closer scrutiny and a verdict of \"\
  Good, but not quite what we need.\"</p> \n    <p>The end result? The second edition\
  \ Pathfinder Society campaign features six factions, most of which have familiar\
  \ faces leading them. These factions are all new and include four major factions\
  \ and two minor factions.</p> \n    <p>Nice! Six factions! That should... uh...\
  \ wait, what? Major and minor factions? (Okay, some of you who have followed a little\
  \ experiment in Starfinder Society might know where this is going.)</p> \n    <h2>Major\
  \ and Minor Factions</h2> \n    <p>Narrative, stability, and options. We're going\
  \ to come back to those words.</p> \n    <p>Let's start with a bit of history. In\
  \ Season 3, the org play team doubled the number of playable factions from 5 to\
  \ 10. It was kinda nice. There were tons of options, there was, at last, a \"good\
  \ guys\" faction that didn't occasionally send assassins after people, the Shadow\
  \ Lodge developed an early following and more. But within a year, the opportunity\
  \ cost of maintaining all of these factions was already taking its toll (those faction\
  \ missions didn't write themselves). There were already plans to trim the factions\
  \ down to 8 by the time I joined in Season 4, and later to 7 factions. Ambitious\
  \ storyteller that I was, I wanted to tell more faction-facing stories, and the\
  \ more factions there were to juggle, the more scenarios they needed to tell their\
  \ stories and the fewer non-faction scenarios we saw. As an added complication,\
  \ some season storylines were ideal fits for any given faction's main story, whereas\
  \ others struggled at times to be relevant.</p> \n    <p>In short, the more factions\
  \ we had, the harder it was to give each of them the screen time we felt they deserved.\
  \ And as I mentioned earlier, factions had gone through a lot of changes over the\
  \ years, and stories sometimes had to focus on how a faction had changed rather\
  \ than fulfilling that faction's goals. In many cases, it worked out nicely, and\
  \ at other times, it didn't meet our lofty expectations. Basically, we were having\
  \ to balance narrative and stability with numerous other factors.</p> \n    <p>To\
  \ address these issues, we created major and minor factions. At their core, major\
  \ and minor factions are about narrative, stability, and options. They aim to give\
  \ players lots of options while maximizing our storytelling possibilities and affording\
  \ us the flexibility to present a wide range of adventures.</p> \n    <p>A <strong>major\
  \ faction</strong> is one of the Pathfinder Society's philosophical pillars, promoting\
  \ values that are central to what the organization's about. When we create each\
  \ year's storyline and scenario list, we endeavor to include several scenarios that\
  \ play to each major faction's strengths or advance their own narratives. And because\
  \ the major factions are fundamentally tied to the Society's goals in different\
  \ ways, these factions are very unlikely to change.</p> \n    <p>A <strong>minor\
  \ faction</strong> represents a group of like-minded individuals within the Society\
  \ that's recognized as a significant force and commands its own substantial resources.\
  \ The faction's goals are not part of the Society's charter, per se, yet the objectives\
  \ are ones that commonly appeal to Pathfinders or are an excellent fit for adventurers\
  \ already traveling the world. Minor factions are also an excellent fit for region-based\
  \ factions that would feature heavily for a specific year's storyline before stepping\
  \ back from the spotlight, much as the Lantern Lodge was central to Season 3'story.\
  \ Likewise, although we'll certainly feature stories tied to minor factions every\
  \ so often, a minor faction isn't guaranteed a particular amount of story content\
  \ each season. In terms of stability, we're unlikely to remove a minor faction from\
  \ play (such as when the Shadow Lodge retired), and we'll likely introduce more\
  \ minor factions slowly throughout the campaign.</p> \n    <p>If you participate\
  \ in Starfinder Society, you might have seen one of these minor factions in action:\
  \ the Manifold Host. The Starfinder Society isn't strictly about recruiting as many\
  \ strange aliens agents as possible, but it sure is something that tends to happen\
  \ when you send explorers out to inspect unfamiliar worlds. The Manifold Host delights\
  \ in expanding the Society's diversity in this way. The minor faction offers a mix\
  \ of boons, including some borrowed from existing factions and a few that are entirely\
  \ unique. The \"Faction (Manifold Host)\" tag hasn't appeared on any scenarios,\
  \ yet it's nonetheless just the right fit in terms of flavor and rewards for many\
  \ characters. It's doing what we'd hope a minor faction would do.</p> \n    <p>Okay,\
  \ we're already 1,100 or so words in, and I haven't even introduced any of our factions\
  \ yet! Let's correct that by showing off two of the six new factions, including\
  \ both a major faction and a minor faction.</p> \n    <h2>Horizon Hunters (Major\
  \ Faction)</h2> \n    <p>Since its first day when adventurers gathered in Absalom\
  \ to share drinks and swap stories, the Pathfinder Society has been an organization\
  \ of explorers. The Horizon Hunters is home to those who carry on the proud tradition\
  \ of ascending the highest peaks, plumbing the darkest depths, and seeing what lies\
  \ over the next hill. And as sweet as it is to discover a lost ruin or unknown vista,\
  \ it's all the better to tell wild tales about the experience and revel in the admiration\
  \ of peers—particularly if an agent's deeds might be immortalized in the Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles, a widely distributed record of the greatest Pathfinders' achievements\
  \ and discoveries.</p> \n    <p><strong>Faction Leader</strong>: Hailing from the\
  \ Sodden Lands, <strong>Calisro Benarry</strong> (N female half-orc) is a pirate-turned-Pathfinder\
  \ who made her name as venture-captain of the Arcadian Mariner's Lodge, a ship-borne\
  \ Pathfinder lodge aboard the Grinning Pixie passed between venture-captains every\
  \ few years. Bucking tradition, Benarry commanded the wheel for a decade, oversaw\
  \ exploration of the dreaded Gloomspires, and traveled widely before recently being\
  \ ordered to surrender the ship. That's no excuse for her to settle down, and she's\
  \ poured her energy into inspiring curiosity, tenacity, and wanderlust in the Society\
  \ as a whole, spearheading the Horizon Hunters faction.</p> \n    <p><strong>Objectives</strong>:\
  \ The more untouched, unfamiliar, or unknown a site or treasure, the more exhilarating\
  \ it is to reach it. The Horizon Hunters encourage exploration for its own sake,\
  \ yet it's also dedicated to enhancing the reputation of its members—anything from\
  \ publication in the Pathfinder Chronicles to being the subject of the latest tall\
  \ tale to circulate the taverns. Iconic objectives include uncovering mythical lost\
  \ cities, blazing the trail through uncharted territory, and reaching foreboding\
  \ realms. And if the PCs can look good while doing so, that's all the better.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Radiant Oath (Minor Faction)</h2> \n    <p>The Society's mission doesn't\
  \ intrinsically involve acts of altruism, heroism, and sacrifice, yet the Pathfinders\
  \ have a track record for thwarting evil, lending a helping hand, and presenting\
  \ the Pathfinders as upstanding folk wherever they go. For the Radiant Oath, this\
  \ benevolence extends beyond incidental assistance. Instead, the faction sees the\
  \ Society's broad reach as an excellent vector for assisting others the world over.\
  \ Those who join the Radiant Oath swear simple vows to assist others, expanding\
  \ on these promises the more they serve the faction.</p> \n    <p><strong>Faction\
  \ Leader</strong>: No stranger to peril, <strong>Valais Durant</strong> (LG female\
  \ aasimar) set out for Numeria after earning her wayfinder and distinguished herself\
  \ in covert operations there and in Ustalav. When the Society needed agents to investigate\
  \ the possible misdeeds of Venture-Captain Thurl, she volunteered, directing her\
  \ practiced senses to uncover his crimes. Unfortunately, she fell prey to his guardians\
  \ and magic, ultimately being transformed into an amalgam of demonflesh. She fought\
  \ off her new form's abyssal influence long enough to return to the Society, and\
  \ there she sought to restore her mortal form. Her journey took her as far away\
  \ as Heaven, where with other Pathfinders, she uncovered a ritual to remove the\
  \ demonic corruption safely. The ritual exceeded her greatest expectations. Rather\
  \ than be restored to her human body, Heaven itself granted her a celestial form.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Even though she's still adjusting to her new body and celestial connection,\
  \ Valais is committed to helping others as the Society helped her. Rather than crushing\
  \ her spirit, her exposure to dark rituals and demonic whispers has taught her what's\
  \ at stake if evil prevails, granting her the strength to defeat fiends and assist\
  \ the vulnerable in equal measure. Her supernatural powers don't blind her to her\
  \ own biases, though. Valais knows that her own perspective of justice and benevolence\
  \ is but one of many the world over, so she recruits faction members of diverse\
  \ backgrounds to spread good in their own ways while respecting the desires of unfamiliar\
  \ cultures.</p> \n    <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Unlike its spiritual predecessor,\
  \ the Silver Crusade, which threw itself forcefully at the most significant threats\
  \ and villains, the Radiant Oath emphasizes acts of kindness, compassion, and redemption.\
  \ However, when dire evils threaten the world, the oathsworn are ready to combat\
  \ it. By consistently promoting the cause of good and building the faction's reputation,\
  \ the Radiant Oath strives for greater influence in the Society to direct its resources\
  \ toward just causes.</p> \n    <p>Did you catch <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgn0?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\"\
