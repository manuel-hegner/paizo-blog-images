  \ June 5, 2008 </p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>No barfly at the local tavern who\
  \ blusters on about his \"adventures\" shall ever know the heart-pounding rush of\
  \ facing down the winds of Abendego on the prow of a pirate king's ship, or the\
  \ majesty of the dawning sun cresting the Sphinx's brow at Sothis. <br> —Venture\
  \ Captain Alissa Moldreserva</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>In Part 1, we unveiled\
  \ our first faction, Andoran, and spoke a little about the factions system we'll\
  \ use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. In this segment, we'll talk briefly\
  \ about faction prestige, how it's earned, and what it means for the world of Golarion\
  \ as well as what it means for you as a member of the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Missions and Prestige</b></p> \n   <p>You gain faction prestige by succeeding\
  \ in specific missions. In a single scenario there will be one to three missions\
  \ dedicated to your specific faction, all tasks that if completed give your faction\
  \ an advantage in Absalom's shadow war. You might need to make sure a crime lord\
  \ dies, protect an innocent merchant, save a kidnapped child, hand off an important\
  \ missive, foil an assassination, or steal an important communiqué. Whatever the\
  \ mission, a positive outcome earns you and your faction anywhere from one to three\
  \ points of Faction Prestige. Every Pathfinder Society Scenario offers the same\
  \ potential amount of Faction Prestige to each faction. It's up to you to make sure\
  \ your faction scores higher than its competitors. </p> \n   <p>As you advance in\
  \ Faction Prestige your faction rewards your excellent service. At the same time,\
  \ the factions with greater prestige gain power and their star rises in the ongoing\
  \ storyline of the season. Every month a Pathfinder Missive (our monthly newsletter)\
  \ will let everyone know which factions are increasing in dominance over the city\
  \ of Absalom and which factions are being nudged ever closer to ignominy and ineffectualness.\
  \ At the season's conclusion, the faction scoring the most Faction Prestige rules\
  \ Absalom from behind the scenes, while its enemies gnash their teeth and their\
  \ kingdoms suffer the consequences. Having a Pathfinder in the winning faction gains\
  \ that character access to rewards you wouldn't otherwise be able to obtain. (More\
  \ on rewards later.) Every season ends in June at the Origins Game Fair in Columbus,\
  \ OH. July is a \"bridge\" month between seasons during which the loosely connected\
  \ storyline of the previous season comes to a close while foreshadowing the new\
  \ season to come. Faction Prestige is reset in July, so that when the next season\
  \ of Pathfinder Society Organized Play kicks off at Gen Con, every faction once\
  \ again has the possibility to rule Absalom from the shadows.</p> \n   <p>And now\
  \ a sneak peek at Cheliax, the Infernal Empire, and the second unveiled faction\
  \ for Pathfinder Society Organized Play.</p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <a\

  0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p><b>CHELIAX</b><br> Infernal Empire</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Asmodeus himself smiles upon our endeavor and we shall not rest until\
  \ the entire world trembles before Him.<br> —Paracountess Zarta Dralneen</p> \n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p>When Aroden died, some say the soul of Cheliax perished\
  \ with him. The once mighty empire tore itself apart, and only through the power\
  \ of three noble Houses, each steeped in deviltry, was order restored. The empire\
  \ runs on the backs of fiends now, a perfect machine of hellfire and blood, where\
  \ morality surrenders to the needs of law and order. It's easy to curse Cheliax\
  \ as a nation of devil-lovers, but few can argue with the results of their fiend-binding\
  \ craft. House Thrune, the greatest of its diabolic noble families, has brought\
  \ the empire under control once more. Cheliax rises like a dark star, as strong\
  \ as ever, despite the recent losses of Galt and Andoran to rebellious forces. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Asmodeus proves as powerful a divine patron as Aroden ever did, shepherding\
  \ his people toward glory and dominance of the Inner Sea. His plans reach eons into\
  \ the future, and the minor setbacks of yesterday are all factored into the cost\
  \ of doing a devil's business. The Chelish always plan for a long campaign, and\
  \ never trifle over today's skirmishes. In the end all will burn in hellfire. It\
  \ is only a matter of time and calculated conquest. </p> \n   <p>The pale-skinned\
  \ Chelish believe themelves superior to all other peoples. Their compact with great\
  \ devils gives them power beyond measure, and no other nation of the Inner Sea can\
  \ compete with their summoners and warlocks when it comes to trafficking with dark\
  \ forces. These devils require payment for their service, often offered up in the\
  \ form of tender flesh and boiled blood. Slaves are an important resource of the\
  \ Chelish as are artifacts of ancient power whose secrets are revealed to them by\
  \ their timeless patrons. Even as Andoran revels in its newfound freedom, the tendrils\
  \ of Cheliax's empire continue to expand. Arcadia lays open before them and Sargava\
  \ is ready to fall under their hellish sway. The Inner Sea will fall with the rest\
  \ as soon as Absalom rests firmly in the bloodied hands of House Thrune.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Goals: Hell on Golarion</b></p> \n   <p>The Chelish plan to spread the\
  \ dark influence of Asmodeus across the face of Golarion. They bring order to chaos,\
  \ quell the troublesome concepts of freedom and self-determination, and leave broken\
  \ souls eager to accept the bondage of slavery in their wake. The world must come\
  \ to terms with the order of things. Mortals serve at the knee of greater powers.\
  \ The devils of the Nine Hells are Golarion's natural overlords and if the rabble\
  \ gathered along the coast of the Inner Sea can't be made to understand this simple\
  \ fact, then they will be purged in a torrent of fire. </p> \n   <p><b>Methodology:\
  \ The Kiss and the Lash</b></p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>A true corrupter can\
  \ convince a man to hand over his soul, a blissful smile on his face. <br> —Paracountess\
  \ Zarta Dralneen</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>The Chelish are masters of seduction\
  \ as well as pain. They bring their enemies to heel with promises of aid, riches,\
  \ and glory, but keep them in line with cruel lashes and hellfire. The Chelish faction\
  \ wins others to its dark cause with temptation. Lust, power, riches, vanity, the\
  \ Chelish offer all, and cater to the sinful nature in every man to bring him low.\
  \ If a foe cannot be seduced, he must instead be scourged. Many missions of the\
  \ Chelish faction involve tempting upright people into darkness and vice, and then\
  \ threatening to expose their sins unless they aid the empire as dutiful agents.\
  \ The tricks of devils have claimed men's souls since time immemorial and they serve\
  \ the Chelish well in their quest for control of Absalom. </p> \n   <p> Check the\
  \ blog again on Thursday for more information on Pathfinder Society Organized Play!\
