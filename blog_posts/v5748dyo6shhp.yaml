  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This week on our series\
  \ of Otari-themed blogs, we’re looking at Otari’s primary industry: logging. While\
  \ none of the pre-written Otari campaigns (the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023dy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure: Troubles in Otari</em></a>, or the forthcoming <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults\"\
  >Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a>) assume the player characters are loggers,\
  \ the industry’s impact on the region is unmistakable. While exploring the woodlands\
  \ around the town, player characters or GMs may wish to add a bit of local flair\
  \ with the following rules for logger marks. Readers of the ongoing novella, <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfz?Pathfinder-Tales-The-Shroud-of-Four-Silences\"\
  ><em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em></a>, will recognize these marks when they\
  \ get to this week’s chapter, entitled “The Redpitch Grove.” What signs will Eleukas,\
  \ Wendlyn, and Lisavet find, and what dangers will they help the party avoid (or\
  \ lead the party toward, instead)?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  \ by Will O’Brien</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3 style=\"color:Brown\">Otari Logger\
  \ Marks</h3> \n     <p>Like much of the Isle of Kortos, Otari is located in a heavily\
  \ forested region. Three of the town’s oldest and most respected families log the\
  \ forest, operating out of several lumber camps and bringing felled trees to Otari\
  \ for milling. These influential families have long demonstrated a respect for the\
  \ forest, understanding that later generations must rely upon the trees as well.\
  \ Replanting is common, as is leaving markings upon trees to pass important messages\
  \ (or warnings!) to other loggers who come by.</p> \n     <p>The logger marks around\
  \ Otari are simple shapes scratched into tree bark. They are similar to marks made\
  \ by vagabonds or drifters, in that they consist of only a few lines or curves,\
  \ and interpreting their meaning relies as much on context as it does symbolic literacy.\
  \ Marks sometimes appear close together or intertwined to create compound symbols\
  \ with deeper meaning, such as “Danger” and “Grave” to warn of undead. Common marks\
  \ include the following:</p> \n     <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n    \
  \  <li><b>Arrows Back and Forth</b>: Hunters are common here.</li> \n      <li><b>Arrow\
  \ to Star</b>: That way is north.</li> \n      <li><b>Boot</b>: Walk carefully around\
  \ here; treacherous footing.</li> \n      <li><b>Crossed Axes</b>: Cut this tree\
  \ first in this area.</li> \n      <li><b>Crossed Circle</b>: Danger.</li> \n  \
  \    <li><b>Hash Marks under Horizontal Line</b>: This area is someone’s property\
  \ (the image resembles a fence).</li> \n      <li><b>Hook</b>: Ogres (the image\
  \ is a dreaded ogre hook).</li> \n      <li><b>Open Stick-Figure Hand</b>: People\
  \ nearby will help you.</li> \n      <li><b>Oval with Slashes on Each Side</b>:\
  \ Goblins (the image is a shape of a goblin head, with the slashes being ears).</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Plus: Something good</b>; sometimes, a benevolent magical phenomenon.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Row of Teeth</b>: Predator.</li> \n      <li><b>Spiral</b>: Trees\
  \ or branches fall irregularly here.</li> \n      <li><b>Three Arcs Atop Each Other</b>:\
  \ This tree deserves respect (usually, because of its age) and should not be cut.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Two Xs in a Circl</b>e: Grave.</li> \n      <li><b>Two Upside-Down\
  \ Vs</b>: Look up, something noteworthy is above.</li> \n      <li><b>Wave</b>:\
  \ Water, usually a spring.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h3 style=\"color:Orange\">Using\
  \ Marks</h3> \n     <p>To place or interpret logger marks, use the following exploration\
  \ activities of the Survival skill.</p> \n     <h4 style=\"color:purple\">Carve\
  \ Logger Mark</h4> \n     <p> <span style=\"color:plum\"><b>Concentrate, Exploration,\
  \ Secret</b></span></p> \n     <p>You carefully place a mark upon a tree or other\
  \ wilderness surface to leave a message for others. Attempt a Survival check, which\
  \ involves at least 10 minutes of evaluating the local terrain, which the mark will\
  \ reference. The GM determines the DC for this check, depending on the obscurity\
  \ of the logger mark and the complexity of the message you intend to impart.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Critical Success</b> You place a mark so clearly that future checks\
  \ to interpret it have the level of success improved by one step beyond the result\
  \ rolled. </p> \n     <p><b>Success</b> You place a mark that others will be able\
  \ to read.</p> \n     <p><b>Failure</b> You’re unable to impart any meaning into\
  \ your mark, but you can try again in a different location.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical\
  \ Failure</b> You leave an inadvertently misleading mark. This generally imparts\
  \ the opposite meaning (for example, safety rather than danger) or provides an incorrect\
  \ direction if the marking is navigational in nature (such as to direct someone\
  \ to a particular stand of trees).</p> \n     <br> \n     <h4 style=\"color:purple\"\
  >Read Logger Mark</h4> \n     <p> <span style=\"color:plum\"><b>Concentrate, Exploration,\
  \ Secret</b></span></p> \n     <p>You interpret the meaning in a logger mark you’\
  ve found (usually, by Investigating or Searching). Attempt a Survival check, which\
  \ involves a few minutes of evaluating the terrain around the mark. The GM determines\
  \ the DC for this check, depending on the age, complexity, and obscurity of the\
  \ logger mark. If you’re attempting to identify something that isn’t a logger mark—\
  such as natural cracks in a rock or whorls in tree bark—you can’t achieve a result\
  \ better than a failure.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical Success</b> You understand the\
  \ mark so completely that you can identify its approximate age, basic meaning, and\
  \ another significant clue (for example, if the mark would point toward a logging\
  \ camp, you know the camp’s distance as well as its direction). </p> \n     <p><b>Success</b>\
  \ You determine the basic meaning of the mark you’ve found.</p> \n     <p><b>Failure</b>\
  \ You can’t glean information from the mark you’ve found.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n \
  \    <p><b>Critical Failure</b> You incorrectly interpret a mark you’ve found and\
  \ gain an opposite meaning (for example, to cut a tree rather than preserve it).</p>\
