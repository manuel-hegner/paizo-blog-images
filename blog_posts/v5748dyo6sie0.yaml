  \ completed their Quest for Sky, a legendary migration from their subterranean homeland\
  \ to the surface. Their exodus nearly failed, but during the journey a hero arose\
  \ to lead them—a young dwarf named Taargick. Time and again Taargick proved his\
  \ bravery, resourcefulness, and political skill, inspiring his people to endure\
  \ when all seemed lost. In honor of his great leadership, his followers named him\
  \ ruler of the new kingdom they would found in his name: Tar Taargadth. </em></p>\

  \ the surface and raised citadels and toasts to his legacy, Taargick felt as much\
  \ remorse in his heart as he felt pride. His people had reached the surface as Torag\
  \ commanded, but at what cost? Their road had been paved with the corpses of orcs,\
  \ xulgaths, and more, slain by dwarven steel. Their unjustly shed blood had festered\
  \ into a thousand vendettas, justifiably earning dwarves the hatred of many. Was\
  \ Torag’s will worth so much death? </em></p> \n     <p><em>Taargick didn’t think\
  \ so. Toward the end of his life, he politely declined the magnificent tomb his\
  \ people had built for him. He departed alone to carve his own tomb, hidden in the\
  \ depths, where the steady strikes of his tools drew the attention of one of the\
  \ Darklands’ mightiest predators: a crimson worm. The two clashed for days before\
  \ Taargick narrowly prevailed. To his surprise, the beast spoke, praising the king’\
  s strength and skill. Taargick, realizing he had subdued an intelligent creature\
  \ and not a mindless worm, remembered the countless orcs, xulgaths, and other creatures\
  \ devastated by the Quest for Sky, and cast aside his weapons and shattered armor,\
  \ refusing to end another Darklands life. Taargick and the cave worm spoke at length\
  \ as he finished his tomb, developing a deep respect for each other. </em></p> \n\
