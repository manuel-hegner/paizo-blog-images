  alt: "A dark landscape, cloudy and tinged in reds and dark purples. Through light\
    \ mist, low stairs lead up to an imposing gothic cathedral with ornate towers\
    \ peaking in pointed spires. It dominates the city skyline, with prominent iconography\
    \ of Asmodeus, including his pentagram religious symbol, displayed in its architecture."

  alt: "A grey-skinned humanoid female with long, thin ridged horns, arms up and one\
    \ knee raised in a battle stance. Long dark hair is pilled back from the face\
    \ in a braid past their waist. They are clothed in red monk robes and pants, with\
    \ white lower leg coverings bound by criss-crossing straps from their leather\
    \ shoes. A simple bangle bracelet adorns each wrist."

  alt: A flag with the top half colored blue and the bottom half colored silver. The
    center of the flag has a shield emblem that is pointed at the bottom. Two vertical
    blue stripes run vertically down each side of this shield and one down the center.
    A set of black and white laurel branches are set at the bottom of the shield and
    rest of each side. Above the shield is a silver diamond-shaped symbol incorporating
    wings for the three lower points.

  alt: "A slim stone tower with many windows sits in the background, but more alarming\
    \ are the large zig-zagging chasms opened in the ground leading to to it, breaking\
    \ up grass and path. Huge tendrils of wispy black shadow extend from the depths."

  alt: "A path through deep, old woods. It appears to be night time. In the foreground\
    \ right, a pair of females in cloaks are tucked away behind large tree roots,\
    \ staring in horror at the path where a string of undead with arrows in their\
    \ abdomens, are being attacked by torch-wielding goblins. The undead in the foreground\
    \ has a gleeful goblin sitting on its shoulders, legs wrapped around the undeadâ€™\
    s neck as it tries to light fire to its head."

  alt: "A formidable dark skinned woman with no hair stands sideways to the viewer,\
    \ her head tilted as she measures them silently. She has the outline of a sun\
    \ with a dot in the center in the middle of her forehead. She wears dark fitted\
    \ armor with spikes on the elbows and shoulders. Her left hand wrists on the scabbard\
    \ of a long sword with a crescent moon on the pommel of the hilt. She wears a\
    \ red cape across her right shoulder."
