  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">Earlier this week, Logan gave you the skinny on\
  \ Resonance and how it interacts with some iconic and all-new magic items. If you\
  \ missed out on Logan's explanation of Resonance, you might want to take a look\
  \ <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkvl?Trinkets-and-Treasures\"><b>here</b></a>\
  \ before reading on, because we're going to come back to it at the end of the blog.\
  \ You got how Resonance works? Good. Now forget about it, we're going to talk about\
  \ weapons instead.</p> \n    <h2>Potency and Properties</h2> \n    <p>Unlike items\
  \ with the invested trait or ones that you activate, weapons typically require no\
  \ Resonance to use. You just pick one up and swing (or shoot, or sling, or thrust,\
  \ or throw), and the magic weapon unleashes its punch, often with potency. Think\
  \ as a weapon's potency as its \"plus\" and more. Potency still grants an item bonus\
  \ to your attack rolls with the weapon, but now it also increases the damage dealt\
  \ by an additional weapon die for each point of potency bonus. For example, let's\
  \ say you find a <i>+1 longsword</i> buried in an otyugh's dung heap. Regardless\
  \ of its current soiling, that weapon grants not only a +1 item bonus to attack\
  \ rolls, but on a successful hit it deals 2d8 + Strength modifier damage, instead\
  \ of the standard 1d8 + Strength modifier. A <i>+2 longsword</i> would instead grant\
  \ a +2 item bonus to attacks and deal 3d8 + Strength modifier damage, and so on.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, potency is only a part of the story. Magic weapons can also\
  \ have properties. The maximum potency and the number of properties a weapon can\
  \ have are based on that weapon's quality. Standard weapons can't have potency or\
  \ properties, while expert-quality weapons can have up to <i>+2 potency</i> and\
  \ one property. Master-quality weapons can have up to <i>+4 potency</i> and two\
  \ properties, and legendary weapons can be <i>+5 </i>weapons and have three properties.\
  \ Sometimes, special materials can affect the number of properties a magic weapon\
  \ can possess. Since cold iron resists magic, weapons made of cold iron have one\
  \ fewer property. Conversely, weapons made of highly magical orichalcum can have\
  \ one additional property, but because the metal is so rare and difficult to work,\
  \ these weapons must be legendary.</p> \n    <p>Both potency and property are imbued\
  \ within a suitable weapon by etching magical runes upon it. Runes can be fairly\
  \ easily removed or added (assuming the quality of the weapon allows it), and can\
  \ even be found etched on a <i>runestone</i>, allowing them to be transferred separately\
  \ from a weapon. Say you just found a handful of weapon property <i>runestones</i>\
  \ in your adventure. What properties might they be? Well, let's take a look at one\
  \ of the favorites of good and undead-hating clerics.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Disrupting <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Rune\
  \ 5+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, melee\
  \ weapon</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >A disrupting weapon deals extra damage to undead. Undead hit by an attack with\
  \ a disrupting weapon takes extra positive damage and additional effects on a critical\
  \ hit.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 5;\
  \ <b>Price</b> 150 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The weapon deals 1d6\
  \ extra positive damage. On a critical hit, the undead is enfeebled 1 until the\
  \ end of your next turn.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater;\
  \ <b>Level</b> 15 (Uncommon), <b>Price</b> 6,200 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >The weapon deals 2d6 extra positive damage. On a critical hit, the undead creature\
  \ must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save with the following effects.</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Success</b> The target is enfeebled 2 until the end\
  \ of your next turn.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Success</b>\
  \ The target is enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Failure</b> The target is enfeebled 3 until the end of your next\
  \ turn.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Failure</b> The target\
  \ is destroyed.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The <i>disrupting</i> property\
  \ comes in two varieties. The standard disrupting property deals some positive damage\
  \ and can enfeeble undead. The greater version deals more positive damage, and can\
  \ force undead to attempt a save—if they critically fail that save, they're destroyed\
  \ outright!</p> \n    <p>Of course, other types of properties can do even more incredible\
  \ things. Sometimes, these properties can require an expenditure of resonance.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Vorpal <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">Rune 17</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Evocation, Magical</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 15,000 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, melee weapon that deals slashing damage</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[R]] Focus Activation; <b>Trigger</b>\
  \ You roll a natural 20 and critically succeed at a Strike with the weapon targeting\
  \ a creature with at least one head.</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"\
  > \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">When you activate a <i>vorpal weapon</i>, the\
  \ triggering creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save, or it is decapitated.\
  \ This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live (such as\
  \ constructs, oozes, and some aberrations and undead). For creatures with multiple\
  \ heads (such as ettins or hydras), this usually kills the creature only if you\
  \ sever its lasthead.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If, like the <i>vorpal</i>\
  \ property, a weapon property has an activation, you have to spend Resonance to\
  \ activate it; however, unlike worn items, you don't have to already be attuned\
  \ to a weapon to activate it. So roll those 20s and snicker-snack your opponents\
  \ for as long as you've got the resonance to spare.</p> \n    <h2>Armor Potency\
  \ and Properties</h2> \n    <p>Magic armor also features potency and may have properties.\
  \ Like weapons, armor can hold a maximum amount of potency and properties based\
  \ on its quality and special materials, and you can add, remove, or transfer potency\
  \ and properties between armor via runes. The maximum potency and number of properties\
  \ for armor is the same as for weapons, though it's worth noting that rather than\
  \ granting an additional property, orichalcum armor instead grants a +1 circumstance\
  \ bonus to initiative rolls and automatically repairs itself over time.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Armor potency grants an item bonus to AC (including Touch Armor Class) and\
  \ to your saving throws. Magic and high-quality armors are also easier to use. Armors\
  \ of expert quality have their armor check penalty reduced by one, while master-quality\
  \ armors have their penalty reduced by two, and legendary armor by three.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Like other worn items, you must invest armor; that is, you have to spend\
  \ resonance to gain its magical effects. If your armor has an activated property,\
  \ you must have invested the armor before you can use that ability. Let's look at\
  \ an example of such a property.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Invisibility <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Rune 8+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Illusion, Magical</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method\
  \ of Use</b> etched, light armor</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b>\
  \ [[A]] Command Activation</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">Once per day, you can whisper the command word to become\
  \ invisible for 1 minute, gaining the effects of a 2nd-level <i>invisibility</i>spell.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 8; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 500 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b>\
  \ 10; <b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can activate\
  \ the armor up to 3 times per day.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Craft\
  \ Requirements</b> You must supply a casting of invisibility.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>This favored property of many rangers and rogues (and maybe a sneaky\
  \ alchemist or two) allows the attuned creature to gain the benefit of an <i>invisibility</i>\
  \ spell at the cost of an action and 1 RP. The greater version enables you to activate\
  \ the armor three times a day instead of just once.</p> \n    <p>But not all properties\
  \ feature activations or require expending Resonance beyond that spent for initial\
  \ attunement. Here's a classic example of one—<i>fortification</i>.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Fortification <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Rune 12+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Abjuration, Magical</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, medium or heavy armor</p>\
  \ \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Each\
  \ time you're hit by a critical hit while wearing fortification armor, attempt a\
  \ flat check with the listed DC. If you succeed, that critical hit becomes a normal\
  \ hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1.</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 12; <b>Price</b> 2,000\
  \ gp; <b>DC</b> 17</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b>\
  \ 18; <b>Price</b> 24,000 gp; <b>DC</b> 14</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Granting medium and heavy armor users the possibility to transform a critical hit\
  \ to a normal hit, <i>fortification</i> provides an excellent constant effect for\
  \ fighters, paladins, and more martial-focused clerics.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <h2>Potions</h2> \n    <p>Now that you know how magic weapons and armor\
  \ work, let's talk a look at something much less permanent, but often useful in\
  \ a pinch—potions! While in First Edition, potions were spells of 3rd level or lower\
  \ in a bottle; we wanted to go a slightly different route this time. Potions not\
  \ only can have effects that reach into higher levels, but they also don't need\
  \ to be tied to particular spell effects. All of that said, there are just some\
  \ potions that are so iconic and necessary, you can't mess with them too much. Who\
  \ doesn't need a <i>healing potion</i> every now and then?</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Healing Potion <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Item 1+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Consumable, Healing, Magical,\
  \ Necromancy, Potion</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> held,\
  \ 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Operate Activation</p>\
  \ \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">When\
  \ you drink a healing potion, you regain the listed number of Hit Points.</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> minor; <b>Level</b> 1; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 3 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The potion restores 1d8 Hit Points.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> lesser; <b>Level</b> 3; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 8 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The potion restores 2d8+4 Hit Points.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> moderate; <b>Level</b> 5; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 20 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The potion restores 3d8+8 Hit Points.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b> 8; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 60 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The potion restores 5d8+12 Hit Points.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> major; <b>Level</b> 12; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 250 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The potion restores 7d8+20 Hit Points.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> true; <b>Level</b> 16; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 1,200 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The potion restores 9d8+30 Hit Points.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The first thing you'll notice is that there are six\
  \ varieties of this point, ranging from level 1 (restoring 1d8 Hit Points) to level\
  \ 16 (restoring 9d8+20 Hit Points) You'll also notice that this potion (and all\
  \ potions) has an activation. Which, you guessed it, means you have to spend Resonance\
  \ to gain its effect.</p> \n    <p>Of course, sometimes a <i>healing potion</i>\
  \ does its best work when you're down for the punch and can't activate it yourself.\
  \ No worries. The time-honored tradition of pouring a potion down your wounded friend's\
  \ gullet is still in the game. Your companion spends an Interact basic action to\
  \ administer the potion to you, but you still need to spend Resonance to gain the\
  \ potion's effect (thankfully, you don't have to be conscious to do so).</p> \n\
  \    <p>Of course, this new flexibility for potions allows us to keep some items\
  \ that in First Edition were called elixirs (a term that in the Playtest, we now\
  \ use for alchemical concoctions). Here's one of my favorites:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Dragon's Breath Potion <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Item 7+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Consumable, Evocation, Magical,\
  \ Potion</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand;\
  \ <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Operate\
  \ Activation</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >This liquid contains blood from a certain breed of dragon. For 1 hour after you\
  \ imbibe the acrid concoction, you can unleash a breath weapon used by that breed\
  \ of dragon. The potion's level and Price, as well as the amount of damage and the\
  \ DC of the saving throw, all depend on the age of the dragon whose blood you used.\
  \ This item has the trait matching the damage type of the breath weapon.</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can spend another Operate Activation action\
  \ with no RP cost immediately after drinking the potion to exhale dragon breath.\
  \ At any point during the potion's duration, you can use the breath weapon by spending\
  \ 1 RP and 2 Operate Activation actions (one to inhale the necessary air and the\
  \ other to breathe out). After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again\
  \ for 1d4 rounds.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Each creature in the area\
  \ of the breath weapon attempts a save against your breath weapon.</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Success</b> Half damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Critical Success</b> No damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Failure</b>\
  \ Full damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Failure</b> Double\
  \ damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> young; <b>Level</b> 7;\
  \ <b>Price</b> 45 gp; <b>Damage</b> 4d6; DC 21</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Type</b> adult; <b>Level</b> 12; </p>\n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Price\
  \ 250 gp; <b>Damage</b> 7d6; DC 28</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b>\
  \ wyrm; <b>Level</b> 17; <b>Price</b> 2,000 gp; <b>Damage</b> 10d6; DC 35</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Dragon\
  \ Breath Weapon (Save)</p> Black or copper 30-foot line of acid (Reflex)\n     <br>\
  \ Blue or bronze 30-foot line of electricity (Reflex)\n     <br> Brass 30-foot line\
  \ of fire (Reflex)\n     <br> Green 15-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)\n     <br>\
  \ Gold or red 15-foot cone of fire (Reflex)\n     <br> Silver or white 15-foot cone\
  \ of cold (Reflex)\n     <p></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>This one is interesting\
  \ because you spend Resonance when you first drink the potion and spew some draconic\
  \ hate on your foes, and can then continue to do so for an hour after imbibing whenever\
  \ you spend actions and RP. Pick the right kind of dragon, and you'll be the life\
  \ of whatever party you join.</p> \n    <p>Very closely related to potions are oils.\
  \ Like potions, you activate these consumable items, but you do so by applying the\
  \ oil to an object or person. While it usually takes one hand to drink or administer\
  \ a potion, applying oil takes two hands. This particular oil may be of interest\
  \ to shield users.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Oil\
  \ of Mending <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item 3</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Consumable, Magical, Oil, Transmutation</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Price</b> 6 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> held,\
  \ 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b>\
  \ [[A]] Operate Activation</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">Applying this oil to an item casts a 2nd-level <i>mending</i>\
  \ spell that repairs the item. If the item was broken, it is no longer broken. If\
  \ the item has Dents, it loses those Dents. This restoration doesn't restore lost\
  \ pieces. For instance, if used on a text with missing pages, it wouldn't recreate\
  \ the lost pages.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>A perfect backup when you fail\
  \ your Crafting check to Repair an Item, or when you need to repair that dented\
  \ shield in a hurry, the oil of mending has plenty of other uses.</p> \n    <p>Well,\
  \ that's it for this week! Join us next week as we take a little walk in the woods.</p>\
