  \ red to green.</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Okay, you’re in.” Even though\
  \ she was holed up in the data center, hacking the locks remotely, tension made\
  \ Raia whisper. “The tracker chip I planted says Averly is in there. We need to\
  \ get to him before they do... whatever it is they do to people.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Understood.” Keskodai stood from his place in the shadows. “I’m headed in.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Good hunting, Keskodai.”</p> \n     <p>Keskodai reached down to the\
  \ child at his belt. “Ready, Chk Chk?”</p> \n     <p>Safe inside his canister, Chk\
  \ Chk tapped his larval beak-tooth against the transparent polycarbon, treating\
  \ Keskodai to a blast of confidence and enthusiasm.</p> \n     <p>Of course Chk\
  \ Chk was confident. As far as he knew, his father was invincible. As was Chk Chk\
  \ himself, for that matter. After all, hadn’t they survived one hundred percent\
  \ of their adventures so far?</p> \n     <p>Keskodai knew better, yet some part\
  \ of him still stood a little straighter at his child’s vision of him. Wasn’t that\
  \ what drove every parent? A desire to be the person their child imagined them to\
  \ be?</p> \n     <p>He stepped forward and keyed the door.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>It swept aside, revealing a room full of strange equipment.\
  \ Pumps whirred and hissed, spotlights stabbing down through the gloom to illuminate\
  \ a shaved human lying nude on the central table. That was their contact, all right.\
  \ Robotic arms like something out of Keskodai’s medical bay prodded at the inert\
  \ body, injecting fluids or implanting subdermal machinery. And standing over it\
  \ all—</p> \n     <p>The gray jerked upright, its movements an eerie, strobe-light\
  \ stutter. It stretched a hand toward Keskodai, and he felt the sudden press of\
  \ its mind—an overwhelming impulse to freeze, to sleep. It tugged at his synapses,\
  \ seeking to reshape them with the force of its will.</p> \n     <p>But shirren\
  \ already escaped such slavery once. Keskodai raised his pistol and fired.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The shot was dead-on: straight to the heart, the sort of merciful deathblow\
  \ Keskodai thought of as the Lady’s Grace. Yet it passed through the gray like it\
  \ was a hologram, the creature’s flesh seeming to ripple out of phase with reality.\
  \ For a nanosecond, it was gone, and then it was there again, the bullet ricocheting\
  \ harmlessly off the wall behind it.</p> \n     <p>Keskodai, on the other hand,\
  \ had no such protections. He dove sideways behind a bank of machinery as the thing\
  \ sighted its own weapon and fired, needles driving deep into the doorjamb.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So be it, Keskodai thought. If mercy wasn’t an option...</p> \n    \
  \ <p>He stood, one hand out for focus, and shoved his way inside the gray’s head.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The creature’s mind was truly alien. In some ways, the neural pathways\
  \ were structurally similar to Keskodai’s own, but without shared context or a known\
  \ starting point, the thought processes that ran along them were nearly impossible\
  \ to decipher. He’d heard Raia speak of different types of computer encryption,\
  \ and this was like that—he could see the <i>shapes</i> of ideas, gliding past him\
  \ like leviathans in a darkened sea, without having any idea what they <i>meant</i>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But you didn’t need to know how something worked to smash it. Keskodai\
  \ focused his magic and <i>pushed</i>.</p> \n     <p>The gray doubled over, screaming\
  \ soundlessly as Keskodai’s spell surged through its neurons, scrambling synapses.\
  \ Keskodai felt a momentary pang of regret—then plastered over it with the memory\
  \ of what these creatures had done on Thersius 4. He pushed again, expanding his\
  \ mental presence inside the creature’s skull, inflating until there was no room\
  \ for anything else.</p> \n     <p>The creature gave a final twitch and collapsed\
  \ to the ground.</p> \n     <p>Keskodai gasped and let the magic drop, grabbing\
  \ the console for support as his mind dizzily readjusted to being back in his own\
  \ body. He put one hand to Chk Chk’s canister—safely intact.</p> \n     <p>“I’m\
  \ sorry you had to see that,” Keskodai said. </p> \n     <p>Chk Chk responded with\
  \ a wave of fierce pride. </p> \n     <p>Keskodai tapped the canister in negation.\
  \ “No, Chk Chk. That wasn’t good. Necessary, perhaps, but never good. Minds are\
  \ sacred—they’re what make each of us unique. To shatter one like that, even in\
  \ self-defense, is to take a sledgehammer to a cathedral.”</p> \n     <p>Chk Chk’\
  s response was dubious, the telepathic sentiment accompanied by a rare image flash:\
  \ Pharasma’s spiral, glowing in the air above Keskodai’s head.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ message was clear: if the Lady of Graves was content to let Keskodai take lives,\
  \ then so was Chk Chk.</p> \n     <p>Keskodai’s antennae drooped in a sigh. He’\
  d been worrying about this more and more, lately. Had his faith in Pharasma made\
  \ Chk Chk too cavalier about death? Of course he couldn’t expect a larva to understand\
  \ when it was acceptable to cut short a life, the differences between a death that\
  \ furthered Pharasma’s plan and one that furthered your own. All the child saw was\
  \ a father grown comfortable with killing. </p> \n     <p>Keskodai had never wanted\
  \ to indoctrinate the child. Show him the galaxy, yes, and teach him as best he\
  \ could, but it was crucial that Chk Chk feel free to walk his own path. </p> \n\
  \     <p>And one day, no doubt, he would. He’d leave Keskodai behind, the same way\
  \ Keskodai had left his own parents. After years of constant company, Keskodai would\
  \ be truly alone once more.</p> \n     <p>But there was no time to worry about that\
  \ now. Keskodai hurried to the operating table. With the gray’s death, the robotic\
  \ arms had gone limp—psychically driven, perhaps? That could be useful in Keskodai’\
  s own medical bay. But he yanked them free, casting his senses down into the man’\
  s flesh and letting the healing magic flow.</p> \n     <p>Except that it wasn’t\
  \ needed. The man—their contact, who had called himself Averly—seemed perfectly\
  \ healthy. Whatever the gray had implanted in him, it didn’t seem to be harming\
  \ him. He didn’t even seem to be sedated, by any conventional or magical means.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Yet he didn’t wake at Keskodai’s touch. Keskodai shook him harder,\
  \ slapping him gently on the cheeks, then less gently. He even spat on a battery\
  \ and pressed its contact points to the man’s skin, shocking him. Yet still the\
  \ man slept.</p> \n     <p>And now, Keskodai thought to himself, we set another\
  \ bad example...</p> \n     <p>“Chk Chk,” he said. “Remember what I said about minds\
  \ being sacred? That’s why you should normally never invade a friend’s without their\
  \ consent. But sometimes, we must hurt to heal.”</p> \n     <p>And with that, he\
  \ dove once again into the mind of another.</p> \n     <p>This intrusion was gentler—\
  an attempt to read a book, not tear out its pages. The comatose man’s thoughts were\
  \ a familiar human structure, yet in some ways that made the content stranger. The\
  \ man wasn’t quite asleep, but neither was he awake. His thoughts routed around\
  \ the edges of strange, artificial holes. Yet certain images recurred. A face...\
  \ a ship...</p> \n     <p>A warning. Keskodai broke contact and cued his coms. “\
  Raia?”</p> \n     <p>“Keskodai! Did it work? Is our contact okay?”</p> \n     <p>Keskodai\
  \ looked down at the comatose man, locked inside his alien dreams.</p> \n     <p>“\
  After a fashion,” he said. “But listen—we need to get back to Navasi and the others.\
  \ Immediately.”</p> \n     <p>He could feel her come alert. “Why?” </p> \n     <p>Keskodai\
  \ lifted the unconscious man in his arms and turned toward the door.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Because I know who they’re going after next.”</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight:\
