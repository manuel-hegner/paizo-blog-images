  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n      <p>The\
  \ Deep Levels!<br>\n        We’ve delved a lot of dungeons throughout Order of the\
  \ Amber Die’s history. We’ve delved a few megadungeons too. There is this cool thing\
  \ that happens when you pass the two-thirds mark of a megadungeon; in 2014, it happened\
  \ when we reached the eleventh level of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy8yqx?Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon\"\
  >The Emerald Spire</a>. In our earlier years, it happened when we reached the third\
  \ poster map of the <em>Ruins of Undermountain</em>. It happened again during this\
  \ marathon, when we landed on the eighth level of the Abomination Vaults. You’re\
  \ close to the end. You can feel the immensity of the megadungeon above you, instead\
  \ of below you. Barring teleportation, it takes longer and longer each time you\
  \ trek back up to the surface. Everything is a bit more serious—the pressure to\
  \ succeed is greater. You’re in what we call “the deep levels” of a megadungeon.\
  \ Just reaching the deep levels is enough for hand-slaps and hugs around the table,\
  \ but in the back of your mind is what awaits at the bottom.</p>\n      <p>To reach\
  \ the deep levels of the Vaults, we first had to get past some devils who ran the\
  \ prison level. Quite a few of them actually, but as devils go, one was more important\
  \ than the rest. Determined to reach the bottom of this megadungeon and stop Belcorra,\
  \ we cut a deal…with the devil. This is Order of the Amber Die and we’re playing\
  \ the Black Powder Cadre, so one deal wasn’t nearly enough. We cut DEALS with devils.\
  \ You can’t hand our GM a whole section of the Adventure Toolbox titled “Infernal\
  \ Contracts,” without expecting him to entice us into nearly every contract available.\
  \ Yet, when Adam asked our party of gunslingers if we had Legal Lore, you’d think\
  \ the answer would be nothing short of silence and smirks. Instead, our Player Captain\
  \ argued two marathons ago that every human gunslinger in the group should take\
  \ Clever Improviser, which Matt said was one of the best feats in Pathfinder 2E.\
  \ Legal Lore, you say? Why, we seem to have a party of outlaws and aspiring attorneys\
  \ here!</p>\n      <p>If you need to get caught up, here is our story from the other\
  \ levels of the <em>Abomination Vaults</em>:</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><a href=\"\

  >Part 4</a></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>This marathon saw a couple of gunslinger\
  \ cameos as additions to the Black Powder Cadre. Grundak, “son of Bashdak,” is an\
  \ orc gunfighter who joined us with his Barricade Buster from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault</em></a>. It’s worth adding that the clip on the\
  \ Barricade Buster was impressive; the rest of us were busy reloading while the\
  \ rookie was plugging away. We were also accompanied by a new companion from <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d52?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Impossible-Lands\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em></a>, following the Way of the Triggerbrand\
  \ and offering some potential melee backup. Our final cameo was from Auralee, playing\
  \ the cocky yet enigmatic “Lady Sniper,” who likes to wait a while before unslinging\
  \ her arquebus and quick-scoping a kill.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Adventure</strong>:\

  \   <p>Every marathon feels different, and for this one we played our hours on level\
  \ seven under the red light, which made for some serious immersion. We spent most\
  \ of our three-day weekend trying to locate fragments of a pentagram that would\
  \ allow us access to the levels below—along with permission from Urevian, a phistophilus.\
  \ Tess Rajani, wife of Carman Rajani (the future mayor of Otari), signed away her\
  \ firstborn in what she swore was a deal that outwitted even a contract devil. To\
  \ make this moment even more intense, Adam laid an actual contract in front of Theodora\
  \ to sign!</p>\n      <h3>Highlights from Marathon 5:</h3>\n      <p>□ Some of the\
  \ devils in this megadungeon wield wicked Hellforged weapons. On level seven we\
  \ found the Hellforge itself, then riddled its smith with bullets. Did you think\
  \ we’d pass up a new forge, when one of us is married to the most famous blacksmith\
  \ on this side of Kortos? “The Rajani Hellforge” is now operational, and ready to\
  \ give Carman the boost to his reputation he’ll need in the next run for mayor!\
  \ Should we mention our ownership of the Hellforge was part of the deal we signed?</p>\n\
  \      <p>□ Just like the levels above, we encountered more bearded devils on level\
  \ seven. It could be something that every group experiences while playing the Abomination\
  \ Vaults Adventure Path, but sustaining an infernal wound from a barbazu is definitely\
  \ a rite of passage in the Black Powder Cadre. Thanks to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026mw\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder</em><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a><em>, </em>Cauterize effectively\
  \ shuts down the worry of dying from one of these wounds, and it leaves a nice scar\
  \ – we like to show them off.</p>\n      <p>□ We came across a gug that wanted nothing\
  \ to do with us. Out-of-game, our vets have something personal against gugs. We\
  \ faced them in The Emerald Spire Project, The Giantslayer Endeavor, and The Strange\
  \ Aeons Experiment. Now one was right in front of us, sitting quietly in some kind\
  \ of prison cell. We made a firing line and let the powder fly— only to be served\
  \ once again by the power of a gug, regardless of what Pathfinder edition we’re\
  \ in! Across the team, its Furious Claws ability spread out 207 damage in a single\
  \ round with a few critical hits in there. The ground was littered with facedown\
  \ gunslingers, and it’s the closest we’ve been to TPK.</p>\n      <p>□ We stumbled\
  \ across one of the most memorable chambers of the entire Abomination Vaults so\
  \ far: a stasis prison, holding an array of nasty creatures that formed a threat\
  \ level high enough to cause the Core Rulebook to combust. Luckily, it wasn’t the\
  \ prison that opposed us, but its witchfire warden. Our guns have names, and it\
  \ was Vlai’s scattergun called “Collateral” that lit up the air like flak. Keep\
  \ flying lady, you’re easier to hit.</p>\n      <p>□ One of the things we love about\
  \ delving a megadungeon is how you get to make a different entrance onto each level,\
  \ and level eight was hard to beat. We descended on an elevator into a large cavern\
  \ filled with water, docks, and a few boats. Cypress Hill prepped the scene with\
  \ “Cock the Hammer” as we spotted forms moving below – undead forms to be precise.\
  \ One ran for a door and only made it to the handle. Another tried to launch a skiff\
  \ and never had a chance. We dumped lead on them until the shouts of “cease fire!”\
  \ echoed off the walls.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \   <h3>Character Deaths</h3>\n      <p>□ With the assistance of devils, kind of\
  \ dying doesn’t count. It’s all in the fine print.</p>\n      <h3>The Arsenal</h3>\n\
  \      <p>There were the occasional doubters when we started this all-gunslingers\
  \ project. After reaching level eight of the Abomination Vaults, it’s about time\
  \ to take some credit for just how well this party has handled the majority of what\
  \ this megadungeon has presented. Let’s be clearer: we’ve just downright trashed\
  \ a lot of encounters. First off, each gunslinger’s Initial Deed means that many\
  \ of us start combat with hands free, which means on round one we can draw <em>silversheen</em>,\
  \ a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shhv?Redpitch-Alchemy\"\
  >redpitch bomb</a>, or even grab an edge if we need to. Do you think it’s a ghost?\
  \ Have our Way of the Drifter draw her <em>ghost touch</em> shortsword. Oh, it a\
  \ levitating seugathi? Pull! A hulking bone gladiator with resistance? Rocked it\
  \ with concussive weapon traits. Creatures that climb walls? Just lead them a bit.\
  \ Fearsome gibbering mouthers? Here’s some extra bludgeoning damage from the harmona\
  \ gun. Mobs that rush you? That’s what hip-firing with Risky Reload is for. Just\
  \ make sure to act out blowing on the tip of your barrel after the last shot is\
  \ fired.</p>\n      <h3>Best Quote from Marathon 5</h3>\n      <p>(staring down\
  \ a denizen of Leng and his companion—a giant crawling hand)<br>\n       Zoric:\
  \ “We should try talking to this guy.”<br>\n       Tess: “Can’t talk to the hand…\

  \ Situation</h3>\n      <p>We disembarked from the elevator down to level eight,\
  \ then Vlai gave the order: search and destroy. After cleaning out a couple of rooms\
  \ containing bog-soaked undead, we debated whether or not we wanted to use one of\
  \ the skiffs to explore the waterways down here. Water and firearms don’t mix, so\
  \ we’ll likely keep scanning for another path around the level.</p>\n      <h3>More\
