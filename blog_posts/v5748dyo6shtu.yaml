  \ </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“No no no no <em>nononoooo</em>!”\
  </p> \n      <p>Trying frantically to keep his load of boxes and bushels more or\
  \ less balanced, Hanish kicked at the grinning dog that was… well, that was dogging\
  \ his path through the crowded Grand Bazaar. The big white mutt wagged its tail\
  \ happily at the game, dodged his foot effortlessly, and darted back in for another\
  \ try at the sausages spilling from an overstuffed hamper on Hanish’s hip.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Hanish swore, but he couldn’t pause to fix the hamper or shoo the dog\
  \ away. He was running late, and his customers were never patient. A double-humped\
  \ camel, bent under its own mountain of chests and caskets, met his gaze with a\
  \ long-lashed eye, and Hanish felt a profound understanding pass between them. Two\
  \ beasts of burden, vital to the lifeblood of the city, but forever unappreciated.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>All around them, merchants and buyers haggled under a dizzying array\
  \ of flags, banners, wicker arbors, and sun-bleached, dusty tents. Dried fruits\
  \ and ribbed purple seedpods from the forests of Kyonin dangled from poles next\
  \ to tables displaying thick white pelts from the halls of the Linnorm Kings, Qadiran\
  \ brass pots that shone like gold, and spiked Nidalese shadowglass sculptures. Ink-painted\
  \ scrolls advertised family businesses that had held the same market stalls for\
  \ centuries, while a steel-feathered parrot perched on a passing woman’s shoulder\
  \ screeched “Scales and teeth! Scales and teeth! Metal skymetal scales and teeth!\
  \ From star-dead wastes of Numeria to you! Two days only! Scales and teeth!”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Off to the right, a troupe of puppeteers was putting on a bedraggled\
  \ but enthusiastic performance of “Iomedae’s Griffon” for an audience of enraptured\
  \ youngsters and heckling drunks. Just as Hanish hustled by, the puppet-stage’s\
  \ curtains blew open around a bellowing, steam-snorting contraption that was probably\
  \ supposed to be Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle. The troupe’s musician banged her drums,\
  \ the puppeteers shouted in rehearsed dismay, and a nearby packhorse reared and\
  \ shrieked in panic, terrified by the clanking menace and its clamor.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Hanish ducked around the animal’s flying hooves, congratulated himself for\
  \ the quick save, and then promptly tripped over a boy wearing a gaudy sandwich\
  \ board touting Gerig’s Liquid Courage, the drink of (mostly deceased) champions.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“No no no no <em>nononoooo</em>!”</p> \n      <p>Scarves and grapes\
  \ and apples flying in his wake, Hanish windmilled his arms in a panicked jig under\
  \ the swinging balance of his load. Finally he stumbled to a stop, panting and sweating\
  \ but basically upright. A nearby street beggar applauded briefly. Hanish sketched\
  \ a bow, or as much of one as he dared, and hurried onward. That dog was, somehow,\
  \ still at his heels.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  ><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>.</h3>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n  \
  \    <p>Hanish spotted a break in the crowds and hurried through to a storefront\
  \ festooned with bits of punched metal hung from silken strings. The chimes sparkled\
  \ and sang against his load of packages as he knocked on the glass-gemmed door.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“You’re late,” snapped the rotund half-orc who opened the door for\
  \ him. Her tusks were painted with fanciful Osiriani hieroglyphs, and a jade Tien\
  \ ornament hung from her earlobe, but her accent was as all Absalom. “I’ll wager\
  \ you’ve stained and wrinkled my wares, too.”</p> \n      <p>Hanish tapped the glowing\
  \ bauble on his wrist. The bobbing crystal still shone blue: he’d made the delivery\
  \ window. “Not late, and your scarves are pristine, Mistress Verity.” <em>Unlike\
  \ poor Ghemel’s lunch</em>, he almost added, but then decided not to badmouth his\
  \ own services. It was hard enough prying tips out of Mistress Verity already.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The half-orc grunted, taking the heavy brown chest from Hanish’s aching\
  \ arm and unlatching it with two quick flips. She ruffled through the fine embroidered\
  \ silks and gossamer scarves, holding this one or that up to the light until she\
  \ was satisfied that, indeed, Hanish had delivered the full load safely.</p> \n\
  \      <p>She hauled the chest inside and tossed Hanish a pair of copper pennies.\
  \ “Commemorative,” she said, and slammed her door.</p> \n      <p>Hanish looked\
  \ at the pitiful coins in his palm. They were commemorative, all right, but one\
  \ celebrated the elevation of a new trademaster and the other was about some giant\
  \ fish getting hauled out of the harbor, so neither was worth more than the copper\
  \ it was stamped on. Mistress Verity’s generosity had struck again.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The bauble on his wrist was starting to pulse violet. Hanish grimaced, rebalanced\
  \ his remaining packages, and ran.</p> \n      <p>He dropped the fruit and sausages\
  \ at Ghemel’s — there was a decent tip, even though half the apples were bruised\
  \ and the dog had managed to steal two sausages — and went on, faster now that the\
  \ heaviest packages were gone. At Chivvi’s Apothecary, he dropped off a box of stonestalk\
  \ eggs; the stiff-armored, distinctively shaped caterpillars had developed a predictable\
  \ reputation as aphrodisiacs. At the Wandlin steam baths, he delivered frost teas\
  \ and ice wines harvested from the Crown of the World and prized by heat-bathers\
  \ in need of quick cooling.</p> \n      <p>The last stop on his route was the best:\
  \ Felifer’s Bibliovary, where priceless texts were framed like gems on bronze and\
  \ silver shelves, and the air carried a deep, calming perfume of ancient wood and\
  \ yellowing paper. Walking into Felifer’s was like stepping into a timeless, never-hurried\
  \ world of learning, and it always made Hanish wistful for the life he’d never lead.\
  \ Maybe if his parents had been richer, if they’d been able to afford more schooling…\
  \ well, it was no use dreaming about all that.</p> \n      <p>But for a few precious\
  \ minutes, whenever he had a delivery at Felifer’s, he could breathe in that sepia-scented\
  \ tranquility and pretend.</p> \n      <p>The door was already ajar when Hanish\
  \ arrived. “Hello?”</p> \n      <p>There was no answer. Hanish stepped inside and\
  \ set down his delivery box. The dog came with him, even though he’d already dropped\
  \ off the sausages. The smell of blood was retch-thick in the shop, and the dog\
  \ whined softly, lashing its tail.</p> \n      <p>“Hello?”</p> \n      <p>Nothing.\
  \ Gulping, Hanish picked his way through the glowing bookshelves to Felifer’s back\
  \ office. Shadows bobbed and spun away from him across the gleaming metal, teasing\
  \ his eyes with premonitions of doom. The dog came with him, and though Hanish couldn’\
  t help worrying that the old bookseller would scold him for bringing an animal into\
  \ the shop, he was glad for its company. He didn’t want to be alone here.</p> \n\
  \      <p>The back office was empty. Quiet. Nothing out of place except a paper-wrapped\
  \ parcel on Felifer’s desk, a note written in the bookseller’s crabbed blue pen,\
  \ and the sigil-stamped luminous tag that meant Hanish was meant to take it for\
  \ delivery.</p> \n      <p>Hanish bent closer to read the note. “To Pathfinder Agent\
  \ Berovic, Skywatch. All speed.” That meant a breakneck run to deliver the parcel\
  \ at any hour of the day or night, and triple pay if he made it within the hour.\
  \ Right now, with the lull between Absalom’s daytime commerce and when the nightlife\
  \ really lit up, the target should be easy to hit. Good money.</p> \n      <p>But\
  \ maybe dangerous. The last two words of the message were shaky and dribbled downward,\
  \ as if Felifer were losing the strength to write. Bloody fingerprints marred the\
  \ paper wrapping, which bulged and sagged in its strings with uncharacteristic sloppiness.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The dog whined again. Hanish patted its head, then reached for the\
  \ parcel. It was light and fragile-feeling, as though whatever was in there were\
  \ dried, or hollow. Something rattled softly inside.</p> \n      <p>Already the\
  \ luminous tag was starting to lose its pearly pallor. If Hanish made to Skywatch\
  \ while the light was still blue, he’d get triple pay.</p> \n      <p>If he didn’\
  t, he might land in something worse than he’d ever imagined.</p> \n      <p>Well,\
  \ it wouldn’t be the first time his job had careened him into trouble, and if Desna\
  \ smiled on him, it wouldn’t be the last. The City at the Center of the World never\
  \ slept, never stopped, and held uncountable adventures. Hanish had taken this job\
  \ because he wanted to grab his share of those adventures, and so far, he’d gotten\
  \ all that he could handle.</p> \n      <p>Hanish tucked the parcel into his satchel,\
  \ snapped its tag onto his bracelet, and ran.</p> \n      <p>One more delivery today.</p>\
