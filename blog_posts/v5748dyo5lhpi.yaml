  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige<em></em></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>What\
  \ does this mean for the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</a> campaign? Most importantly, the linked blog has a Chronicle sheet that\
  \ rewards campaign participants for helping in the playtest during RPG organized\
  \ play events. The sheet works in many ways like the one released during the <em>Occult\
  \ Adventures</em> playtest, granting scaling rewards based on how many times you\
  \ playtest a vigilante character and at what levels. However, the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> team also learned from previous playtests and incorporated\
  \ a few additional features to improve the experience.</p> \n    <p>First, very\
  \ early in discussing the playtest process, we inquired about ways to expand the\
  \ playtest window. The result the two-stage playtest with the traditional playtest\
  \ running through July 20th and a second “final thoughts” opportunity to comment\
  \ extending another month after that. For Pathfinder Society, that’s exactly what\
  \ we needed to support your accruing playtest credit over two months instead of\
  \ just one.</p> \n    <p>Second, we heard that there were too many lines that one\
  \ needed to fill out to earn the top rewards. We haven’t changed the numbers much,\
  \ but we have provided a way to earn double credit during the first playtest window.\
  \ For those wondering whether to risk a new character built using GM credit, note\
  \ that we’re explicitly allowing rebuilding once the hardcover book hits the shelves.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, GMs were concerned because they felt they could contribute valuable\
  \ playtest feedback despite not playing a vigilante character themselves. We agreed,\
  \ and a GM is now able to accrue credit on her own vigilante character so long as\
  \ someone at the table is using the new class.</p> \n    <p>Because there was a\
  \ delay in getting out the Chronicle sheet, you’ll notice that it allows for retroactive\
  \ credit for those who have already started playtesting during organized play events.\
  \ Perhaps most importantly, if you already have a vigilante playtest character,\
  \ it is important that you update your character to use the most recent version\
  \ of the class. We have updated the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources page</a> to reflect this.</p> \n    <p>Linda and I—as well\
  \ as many members of the editorial and art staff—are back to working on the many\
  \ new adventures set to debut at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Gen Con</a>. It’s going to be a great show and a great opportunity to showcase\
  \ your assistance in playtesting <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\"\
