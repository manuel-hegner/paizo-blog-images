  \ say that the team was astounded when you helped us raise over $2000 in a single\
  \ day for <a href=\"http://www.thegauntlet.me\">The Gauntlet charity tournament\
  \ event</a> coming up on May 18th. With that, we have earned a number of \"power\
  \ ups\" that are going to help us in the tournament to claim The Gauntlet. Alas,\
  \ the fight is not over yet!</span></p> \n    <p>In the past few days, we've seen\
  \ our competition enter the fray, getting a mountain of donations. One in particular,\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.thegauntlet.me/#!progress/cgb6\">has surged past us</a>!\
  \ While we commend them for helping to raise money for Child's Play, we still want\
  \ to beat them and show that Paizo fans are some of the most awesome and charitable\
  \ fans in the world!</p> \n    <p>To that end, we've decided to announce some special\
  \ goals, to help raise some more money for this event! If we raise the following\
  \ totals, we will unlock the goals and give everyone some awesome rewards! Check\
  \ out these exciting funding goals!</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <ul> \n     <li><b>$3,000—\
  Caveman Reward</b>: In honor of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8sbu?UggTect\"\
  >Ugg-tect</a>, one of the games we will be playing in which the participants are\
  \ caveman architects, we will put together a free PDF of a \"caveman\" humanoid\
  \ race for use in your Pathfinder games.</li> \n     <li><b>$4,000—Card Game Reward</b>:\
  \ We will release a PDF featuring the Gauntlet team members as new Ally cards compatible\
  \ with the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</a>. </li> \n     <li><b>$5,000—Audio Reward</b>: We will\
  \ put together a \"dramatic reading\" of a chapter from one of our <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/fiction\"\
  >Pathfinder Tales novels</a>, featuring members of the Paizo staff as the characters.</li>\
  \ \n    </ul>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>In addition to these great rewards, at $2,500,\
  \ $3,500 and every $1,000 dollars thereafter I will post up some tantalizing spoilers\
  \ from the upcoming <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy95d1?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide-Hardcover\"\
  ><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a> right here in the thread associated with this\
  \ blog post! Expect to see those shortly after we reach each goal. The bigger rewards\
  \ will take a little bit of time for us to put together (especially the Audio Reward),\
  \ but you should expect them in the coming weeks.</p> \n    <p>The Gauntlet event\
  \ is this Sunday, May 18th, starting at around 3pm PST. We've learned you will be\
  \ able to watch the event live on Twitch.tv and take part in some truly awesome\
  \ auctions during the event. We hope that you tune in and cheer us on through the\
  \ chat and social media. Thanks again for donating and proving that Paizo has some\
  \ of the best fans in the world!</p> \n    <p><b><a href=\"https://donate.childsplaycharity.org/2d54acfe5e30598c974ea908a18126c9/\"\
