  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 1, 2011</p> \n   <p>Welcome to the final\
  \ installment of a three-part series of Design Tuesday blogs exploring Intelligent\
  \ Magic Items. Part 1 of this series can be found <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/designTuesdays/v5748dyo5lbrd\"\
  >here</a>. Part 2 can be found <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/designTuesdays/v5748dyo5lbsa\"\
  >here</a>. </p> \n   <p><b>Intelligent Magic Items: Part 3</b></p> \n   <p>We've\
  \ looked at how you design the history and the mechanics behind intelligent magic\
  \ items, but now its time to put this information to use and look at some sample\
  \ intelligent magic items. Using some art from the upcoming <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n\"\
  >Carrion Crown Item Card Deck</a>, we've created a pair of interesting intelligent\
  \ items, ready to drop right into your game. These items vary wildly in cost, power,\
  \ and personality, exploring the various concepts and rules that make intelligent\
  \ magic items fun.</p> \n   <p>Each item starts off with a physical description,\
  \ a history, notes on its personality and goals, as well as a complete write-up\
  \ on its powers, cost, and ego.</p> <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n\"\

  \ <i>Made from a regal purple cloth with a red lining, with golden trim, this cloak\
  \ gives of an aura of majesty</i></p> \n    <p><b>History</b>: Crafted by the vizier\
  \ of a decadent kingdom for a wealthy nobleman, this cloak was imbued with sentience\
  \ so that it might spy on the nobleman's business dealings and report to the vizier.\
  \ As the months went by, however, the cloak realized it was meant for greatness\
  \ and that neither man was worthy of its power. Calling itself Darnisan, it revealed\
  \ itself to the nobleman, pretending to be an agent of his god, and told him of\
  \ his vizier's treachery. Enraged, the nobleman confronted his vizier, and in the\
  \ ensuing battle, both were slain. Unfortunately for Darnisan, it was buried with\
  \ its master, and has been waiting in his tomb ever since for the right individual\
  \ to claim it and its power.<br> <b>Personality</b>: Darnisan is slow to reveal\
  \ its true nature to anyone with the arrogance to don it. It usually takes a bit\
  \ of time to determine if the wearer is worthy and how best to shape him into a\
  \ true and noble leader before making itself known. Darnisan is haughty and thinks\
  \ very highly of itself. It seeks to be the mantle of a great ruler and will encourage\
  \ its wearer in whatever way it can to lead him into greatness, even if that means\
  \ mortal danger. If Darnisan finds its wearer to be unworthy, it might eventually\
  \ form a plan to be rid of him and to end up in the hands of a more worthy individual.\
  \ Should Darnisan gain control of a character, it immediately attempts to take control\
  \ of the situation or find a more worthy host.<br> <b>Powers</b>: Darnisan is a\
  \ <i>cloak of minor displacement</i> that also grants its wearer a +2 resistance\
  \ bonus on saving throws. It also has the hiding special ability, described in the\
  \ previous article, which it uses to make itself invisible if someone truly unworthy\
  \ finds it. It has a special purpose, to be worn by and defend a ruling monarch\
  \ or leader of a large city. If it finds its wearer promising, it can cast <i>resist\
  \ energy</i> and <i>stoneskin</i> on its wearer each once per day (caster level\
  \ 7th). Finally, the cloak has the uncaring drawback, as it truly does not care\
  \ about its wearer, only the greatness that such a wearer might bestow on the cloak.\
  \ This only applies if the cloak does not think the wearer could be great, and as\
  \ such, the ego reduction is only a â€“1. Darnisan has the following statistics.<br>\
  \ <b>Alignment</b> Lawful neutral. <b>Int</b> 14 <b>Wis</b> 12 <b>Cha</b> 16 <b>Abilities</b>\

  \ hspace=\"9\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Thirst, the Vampire\
  \ Blade</b><br> <i>Forged in ages past, this worn, wicked sword is stained with\
  \ the blood of its victims and marred by the countless battles it has fought</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>History</b>: Back in a more barbaric age, this sword was made for\
  \ the sole purpose of taking life. Given to a powerful warrior, Thirst, as it would\
  \ later be known, was used to carve a swath of death and destruction across the\
  \ land, changing hands sometimes more than once in a single day. As the years passed,\
  \ all of the souls that were claimed by the blade began to coalesce into a single\
  \ consciousness, one that desired only more life. It hungers for blood and for the\
  \ life of living creatures. Those who wield the blade for long periods of time find\
  \ that it draws in their life force, causing them to hunger for life at the same\
  \ time. This can turn the wielder into a vampire. Its current wielder is one such\
  \ individual, a powerful vampire that uses Thirst to slay countless innocent creatures\
  \ every night. It remains at its side to this day, consuming just as much life as\
  \ its master. <br> <b>Personality</b>: Thirst knows nothing of pity or remorse.\
  \ It seeks only to kill and consume. It grows angry and restless when not in use,\
  \ and should it go more than a few days without killing, it grows hostile to its\
  \ wielder and attempts to control him to go on a murderous rampage. Thirst is very\
  \ powerful, making it worth keeping, but should it gain control of its wielder,\
  \ it becomes a serious danger to all those around it.<br> <b>Powers</b>: Thirst\
  \ is a <i>+2 keen vicious wounding longsword</i>. When Thirst is used to perform\
  \ a coup de grace, the DC to avoid death is increased by +4. Thirst can cast <i>vampiric\
  \ touch</i> three times per day (caster level 18th). Slaying all creatures is its\
  \ special purpose, and it can cast <i>enervation</i> at will, but only when targeting\
  \ a living creature. Finally, whenever the blade is used to coup de grace a creature,\
  \ its wielder gains a permanent negative level. If the wielder dies due to negative\
  \ levels in this way, he rises as a vampire 24 hours later.<br> <b>Alignment</b>\
  \ Chaotic Evil <b>Int</b> 10 <b>Wis</b> 14 <b>Cha</b> 20 <b>Abilities</b> telepathy,\
  \ darkvision 120 ft. <b>Cost</b> 191,815 gp <b>Ego</b> 21</p> \n   </blockquote>\
