  description\"><i>True to their history, Acquisitives are the most mercenary of the\
  \ Starfinder Society factions. Their goals often involve promoting the Starfinder\
  \ Society to the extent that it will increase the personal reputation of all members.\
  \ They stockpile funds and resources, believing that by maintaining such a treasury,\
  \ the faction can make itself indispensable to other factions within the Society.\
  \ Indeed, many Starfinders pledge themselves, to varying degrees, to the Acquisitives\
  \ faction for access to these assets. This influx of recruits is the direct byproduct\
  \ of the Acquisitives' existing cache of resources, not to mention their preference\
  \ of sending Starfinders on missions leading to personal glory and monetary enrichment.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>All right. It is time to start dropping some major bombs in these blogs—\
  oddly fitting, because at their core, the Acquisitives are mercenaries who have\
  \ probably dropped a lot of bombs in their time.</p> \n    <p>When the Organized\
  \ Play team started assembling our all-star faction team, we wanted to make sure\
  \ that the factions catered to a variety of character builds. We wanted to avoid\
  \ a situation where a player who made a \"lawful good paladin\" felt compelled to\
  \ pick one faction over another because that faction was the only right choice.\
  \ (Note: there are no lawful good paladins in Starfinder). The character themes\
  \ present in Starfinder lined up perfectly with our intent, and many of our internal\
  \ talks revolved around asking questions like, \"Ok, so this faction is going to\
  \ be something interesting to Ace Pilots and Priests?\" It was an iterative process\
  \ between all members of the team and helped us create factions where every character\
  \ should have a place. Perhaps none of our factions better exemplify this design\
  \ style than our final announced faction: the Acquisitives.</p> \n    <p>The Acquisitives\
  \ faction is a direct result of mercenaries and other externally hired operatives\
  \ recognizing the gains made from an alliance with the Starfinder Society. Several\
  \ of these \"hired hands\" came to realize that there were plenty of credits and\
  \ fame to be had from forming a more permanent contract with the Starfinder Society.\
  \ So, rather than wait for their contracts to run out once the Society's latest\
  \ recruitment drive concluded, the Acquisitives faction formed to give any outside\
  \ contractor a fast track into the Starfinder Society. Basically, the Acquisitives\
  \ are like a \"union\" (but NOT of the shadow variety) that promotes Starfinders,\
  \ effectively creating intergalactic celebrities within the Society. Acquisitives\
  \ characters are all about gaining personal fame and wealth, while working within\
  \ the strictures of the Starfinder Society.</p> \n    <p>Players are going to get\
  \ a chance to feel what the Acquisitives are about in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  ><em>Starfinder #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a>, written by Pathfinder Society\
  \ and Pathfinder Adventure Path veteran (as well as notorious knife-fighter—ask\
  \ me sometime), Larry Wilhelm. This is because <em>Claim to Salvation</em> is a\
  \ prequel to the events of the Year of Scoured Stars. In this adventure, the players\
  \ take on the roles of the iconic Starfinder characters, employed as mercenaries\
  \ by the Starfinder Society. Wait… why does the Starfinder Society need mercenaries?\
  \ Oh, that's right! Something went terribly wrong in the Scoured Stars system. In\
  \ order to keep the Starfinder Society together, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljyy?Faction-Overview-Second-Seekers\"\
  >First Seeker (Luwazi Elsebo)</a> went to some radical lengths to keep things going\
  \ until a new generation of Starfinders could finish training.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \  <p><i>Illustration by Sebastian Rodriguez</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Radaszam\
  \ \"The Dealmaker\"</b> (N male vesk operative) is the official Acquisitives liaison\
  \ to the Starfinder Society. He spends equal time managing the Acquisitives as he\
  \ does operating his own independent mercenary outfit, the Obsidian Spiders. Most\
  \ of Radaszam's administration focuses on helping Acquisitives become celebrities,\
  \ both within the Starfinder Society and without. He recognizes the importance of\
  \ creating modern Starfinder icons for the public to recognize, and knows that such\
  \ celebrities will only encourage further generations of Starfinders to step forward.\
  \ Similarly, he recognizes the need for cutting any loss-leads, giving him a somewhat\
  \ vicious edge when it comes to his administrative decisions. I'm really looking\
  \ forward to exploring Radaszam, as well as the Obsidian Spiders, in some of our\
  \ earliest scenarios following the Gen Con release!</p> \n    <p>Now it's time to\
  \ talk about some boons (and if you're forgetting the boon types, be sure to look\
  \ back at <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljxe?A-Game-of-Boons\">our blog about Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild's boon system</a>). One boon type we've yet to highlight\
  \ is the Starship boon, so how about we show one off?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Abundant Ammunition (Starship Boon)</p> \n \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block\">Your faction provides you with ample starship ammo\
  \ for important missions.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Acquisitives: Tier 1</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b>: 1 Fame</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: When this boon is slotted, select\
  \ one starship weapon with the limited fire special property on the group's starship.\
  \ The selected weapon increases the value of the limited fire value by half (rounded\
  \ down). For example, a limited fire 5 weapon would become limited fire 7. This\
  \ boon can be used to improve weapons gained as a result of other Starship boons.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b>: Multiple copies of this boon\
  \ can be used on a starship, but each copy must affect a different weapon.</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>I understand that it's hard to recognize the significance\
  \ of this boon without seeing the full starship rules. But from the playtests John\
  \ and I have run, I think it's safe to say that any starship with missiles… well,\
  \ that starship really likes having more missiles! Also, the Abundant Ammunition\
  \ boon serves as an appealing low-cost boon for starship customization. Given how\
  \ many starship boons can only be applied to a starship once, having this boon around\
  \ is an excellent backup to ensure you can maximize the number of starship boons\
  \ your ship can bring into battle!</p> \n    <p>We really wanted to showcase a Starship\
  \ boon, just to give an example of what players can do to further modify their starship.\
  \ But why stop there? So, for this final pre-Gen Con faction blog, how about I show\
  \ off another boon?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Sponsorship (Social Boon)</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">The Acquisitives have\
  \ connected you with an organization interested in using you to promote its brand\
  \ and merchandise.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Acquisitives:\
  \ Tier 2</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Cost</b>: 2 Fame</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: By slotting this boon, you gain an additional\
  \ Promotional boon slot. This allows you to slot up to two Promotional boons as\
  \ long as you meet all the prerequisites for those boons, such as possessing the\
  \ appropriate product or having the necessary volunteer recognition. You cannot\
  \ slot the same Promotional boon multiple times, nor can you slot two Promotional\
  \ boons that offer the same effect (such as two boons that both provide rerolls).</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Normal</b>: You can normally only ever have\
  \ one promotional boon slot.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Ok, so this boon is\
  \ just fun. The Organized Play team got a good chuckle when we brainstormed several\
  \ of the boons listed in the guide, but this one was one of our favorites. The immediate\
  \ thought that comes to mind when a character takes this boon is that of a NASCAR\
  \ race driver, bedecked in \"flair\" from corporate sponsors. Another example, closer\
  \ to my interests, would be something like Captain Amazing from the movie Mystery\
  \ Men (also bedecked with appropriate \"flair\"). I bet that some players out there\
  \ are going to have a ton of fun with the themes behind this boon.</p> \n    <p>By\
  \ taking this boon, a character can benefit from multiple Promotional boons by sacrificing\
  \ his or her Social boon slot. This means that a player coming to the table with\
  \ a Paizo T-shirt and a Starfinder Character Folio could benefit from both the Promotional\
  \ boons associated with those items. We're planning on including several different\
  \ Promotional boons for the launch, including service coins, pins, and even something\
  \ for the convention crowd. Expect to see a bit more on this when the Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild Guide officially releases.</p> \n    <p>And that's a\
  \ wrap on our factions' reveals, but not a wrap on Starfinder Society blogs. Stay\
  \ tuned for next week, where we provide some more information on two of our exciting\
  \ Gen Con releases, <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Quest-Into-the-Unknown\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Quest: Into the Unknown</em></a> and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
