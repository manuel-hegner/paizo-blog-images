  \ Erasmus</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 9, 2018</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>We continue our series of Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game fans telling us who the best character ever is. One of our\
  \ playtesters, Eliandra Giltessan, gives us a sneak peak at the iconic medium from\
  \ <a href=\"//products/btpy9u08?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Occult-Adventures-Character-Deck-2\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures Character Deck 2</em></a> that has her over the moon.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>People who know me may be saying, \"What?! I thought you said <i>Alahazra</i>\
  \ was the best character!\" A year ago, that was true. Alahazra <i>was</i> the best\
  \ character everâ€”in a world without Triggers. I recall when Skull &amp; Shackles'\
  \ version of Alahazra hung out at the Wishing Well and took all the boons from locations\
  \ decks. Or <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2\">Season of the\
  \ Runelords</a>, where the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ezo?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Oracle-Class-Deck\"\
  ><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>'s Alahazra examined nigh on entire location decks\
  \ with a Scrying and a Headdress. Sigh. Good times.</p> \n    <p>But, my friends,\
  \ we live in a world of Triggers. Gone are the days of \"I only need one attack\
  \ spell in my deck, right?\" Now when Alahazra scouts, sometimes the cards bite\
  \ back. She's still great, but there's room for the new best character ever: Erasmus.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Erasmus.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Erasmus_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>At first look, Erasmus may not look like much. All d8s\
  \ and d6s, with Arcane just d8+1 and Perception (of all things!) at d6+3. Well,\
  \ let me tell you, Occult characters can do more with Perception than just defeat\
  \ Camouflaged Pit Traps without rolling. They can fight and recharge and tell their\
  \ Dwarf Mindblade friend to go kill things for them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-KineticBlast.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-KineticBlast_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Mindblade.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Mindblade_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Let's move onto powers, cuz Erasmus has got some great\
  \ ones! I'm developing an appreciation for characters who give you something to\
  \ do with the junk cards you pick up, and Erasmus can bury his to change his results\
  \ <i>after</i> the roll. No missed-by-1's with Erasmus, and when he overkills that\
  \ Pit Trap with his massive Perception, he can coax away the consequences. His next\
  \ power is the one I love oh-so-much: recharging boons at the start of your turn\
  \ to add to all checks that turn. Not only does this make for great deck cycling,\
  \ but it really takes the sting out of those early scenarios when you have no skill\
  \ feats. That last power mentions something called \"Spirit Relatives,\" and you\
  \ may ask, \"What does that mean?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-SpiritRelativesBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ah, well, you see, Erasmus can channel the spirits of\
  \ his dead relatives, and at the beginning of each scenario, he can pick one to\
  \ give him some new skills and an extra d4 plus the adventure deck number. So when\
  \ Grimslakes are threatening to eat your deck if you don't make a Fortitude check,\
  \ you can pick Nissa. When you need to make an Acrobatics check, or when the villain\
  \ makes you cry in a corner with no cards in your hand, you can ask for Baylock's\
  \ help. After a power feat, you can even help other characters at your location.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But Eliandra,\" you may say. \"I'm stuck with one of these spirits\
  \ for an entire scenario. That's not very versatile.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Relax,\" I\
  \ say to you. \"We need to save something for roles.\" You see, Erasmus's roles\
  \ allow you to put more than one marker on the card. Personally, I'm a fan of the\
  \ Storyteller. Bury a card for a second token? Yes, please!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Storyteller.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6827-Storyteller_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>After all this gushing, you may still have your doubts\
  \ as to whether this all <i>works</i>. Can Erasmus have one deck of cards and still\
  \ be effective at all his roles? <i>Yes</i>. His powers more than make up for the\
  \ small dice size, and the cards he doesn't otherwise need at the moment become\
  \ the fuel to charge them. Erasmus is the first character where I put my skill feats\
  \ in different skills every time, and I love it. He's the most versatile character\
  \ I've seen, and he once closed two locations in his first turn armed only with\
  \ a Force Missile and a Light Crossbow.</p> \n    <p>Vote Erasmus: Best Character\
  \ EVER!</p> \n    <p>Elizabeth Corrigan aka Eliandra Giltessan<br> <i>Adventure\
