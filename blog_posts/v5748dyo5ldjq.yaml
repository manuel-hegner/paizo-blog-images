  \ team is juggling a lot of projects as of late. We're winding our way toward completion\
  \ of the <i>NPC Codex</i>, and I have a bunch of Map Pack and Flip-Mat projects\
  \ in various stages of development. I've also been thinking a great deal about helpful\
  \ Pathfinder apps. While we have a couple that are reaching exciting milestones,\
  \ I'm not ready to talk about those yet. </p> \n    <p>But to help us serve you\
  \ better on the app front, I'm on the hunt for information. Toward that end, this\
  \ week's design blog is a poll. What kind of mobile device do you use? Or, more\
  \ importantly, what mobile device do you use or want to use when running Pathfinder\
  \ mobile apps?</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/forums/dmtz5xv1\"><b>Take the survey here,\
  \ and help us make sure that we give you tools on the devices that best reach our\
  \ audience.</b></a></p> \n    <p>Lastly, for those of you who do not know, we already\
  \ have two Pathfinder apps available for iPhones, iPads, and tablets. You can find\
  \ iCrit and iFumble in the App Store (for Apple devices) and Google Play (for Android\
  \ devices). If you have these and use these apps, feel free to tell us in the comment\
  \ field below about your experiences with those apps and how you would like to see\
  \ them improve. The more information we can get on these apps and how you use them\
  \ the better! </p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Designer</i></p> <!--\
