  \ href=\"/products/btpy9ckd\">Liar's Island<i></i></a><i>, when Rodrick and his\
  \ talking sword Hrym are summoned to the royal court of Jalmeray, the con men—well,\
  \ con man and con sword—sense the opportunity for easy money. Yet while the legendary\
  \ island is as fantastic as the stories tell, and the thakur's treasury as full\
  \ as either man or sword could hope, there's more to this summons than a simple\
  \ social visit. As intrigue mounts and the island's deadlier residents begin revealing\
  \ themselves, Rodrick and Hrym quickly realize that the most important treasure\
  \ they can escape with may be their own lives...</i></p> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <h2>Chapter One: Cornered</h2> \n      <p>Kresley was head of the little\
  \ lord's household guard, a position that seldom required more than standing around\
  \ looking good in a polished breastplate at interminable balls and occasionally\
  \ kicking priests, beggars, or solicitors who somehow made it past the lord's gates\
  \ back out into the streets of Absalom. Today, unfortunately, he'd been sent on\
  \ an errand that was really more the province of the city guards... but the little\
  \ lord wanted it handled personally, because the city guards were interested more\
  \ in the law than in allowing the lord to exact a terrible revenge.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Kresley cleared his throat and tried once more to do it the easy way. \"Rodrick!\
  \ Come out! None of us want to see blood spilled.\" This gray street in a rough\
  \ part of the city had probably seen plenty of blood spilled, though the predominant\
  \ scent was actually urine.</p> \n      <p>\"Especially our blood,\" muttered Haverford,\
  \ a grizzled veteran with a long scar down one cheek who'd been hired onto the household\
  \ guard because he'd once saved the little lord's cousin from getting a crossbow\
  \ bolt in the face on one battlefield or another. Haverford was fond of wine and\
  \ didn't respect Kresley's authority at all, even though Kresley's breastplate always\
  \ <i>far</i> outshone Haverford's own. </p> \n      <p>Kresley, Haverford, and three\
  \ other men—and the wizard, but Kresley didn't want to think about the wizard; they\
  \ weren't the sort of people you wanted standing <i>behind</i> you, because what\
  \ if one of their spells went off by accident?—were arrayed in a loose semicircle\
  \ before an abandoned storehouse in the Coins. The wizard had tracked their quarry\
  \ this far, through the winding streets of Absalom, and there was no doubt they'd\
  \ found their prey, and that he was trapped. Kresley had scouted for other exits,\
  \ and this door was the only way out, since the storehouse was built right up against\
  \ the similarly dilapidated buildings around it on all sides. </p> \n      <p>But\
  \ the thief, Rodrick, wasn't acting like he was trapped, and showed no interest\
  \ at all in giving himself up. Kresley wasn't keen to bash his way into a building\
  \ full of who knew what, through a door only large enough to admit one man at a\
  \ time, against an enemy who'd had time to set traps or an ambush. </p> \n     \
  \ <p>Especially <i>this</i> enemy. Kresley had seen the damage done by Rodrick's\
  \ sword, the holes blasted in the little lord's wall, ragged gaps still rimed with\
  \ frost. He knew the wizard was here to take that icy advantage away, but what if\
  \ the man's magic <i>missed</i>?</p> \n      <p>The front door of the storehouse\
  \ was even hanging askew, practically an invitation to enter, which surely meant\
  \ some terrible preparations had been made beyond. Kresley had never served in any\
  \ organized military force, but he knew attacking an enemy on prepared ground was\
  \ harder than kicking a beggar down the little lord's front steps.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Why don't you come in?\" Rodrick called, voice muffled. \"It's nice in here. Plenty\
  \ of room. We can sit and chat.\"</p> \n      <p>\"If we have to come in after you,\
  \ there will be violence!\" Kresley said. \"Give yourself up, and it will go easier\
  \ on you!\"</p> \n      <p>\"I see,\" Rodrick called, but his voice seemed to come\
  \ from farther away. What was he <i>doing</i> in there? \"So, if I come out, you\
  \ won't harm me?\"</p> \n      <p>\"That's right!\"</p> \n      <p>\"But you'll\
  \ take me back to the little lord, who will harm me?\"</p> \n      <p>\"He... hasn't\
  \ told me his plans for you... \"</p> \n      <p>\"Oh?\" Rodrick's voice was bright,\
  \ and now sounded closer. \"He could want me for anything, then. Perhaps I'm to\
  \ be guest of honor at a feast, or he wants to play a game of towers. Sit with me\
  \ and sip brandy by the fire and discuss the peculiarities of Osirian funeral rites\
  \ or the philosophies of the Mammoth Lords, just us, two men of the world. I suppose\
  \ that's the sort of hospitality he offers thieves? Though to be <i>accurate</i>\
  \ I'm not a thief at all, because I was discovered before I had a chance to steal\
  \ anything. The indignity of fleeing the palace—of running from <i>you</i>—isn't\
  \ that punishment enough, especially considering I made no profit off this endeavor\
  \ at all?\"</p> \n      <p>\"You did get your wages for serving as security at the\
  \ ball,\" Kresley said. \"Those are ill-gotten gains.\" Why was he arguing with\
  \ the man? Oh, yes: Because it was better than rushing someone who had a magical\
  \ sword. Or indeed any kind of sword. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurb360\">\n  \

  ></a>\n       <br><i>Rodrick and Hrym are always up for a job, provided it doesn't\
  \ involve any actual </i>work.\n       <br> Illustration by Eric Belisle\n     \
  \ </div> \n      <p>\"Are you claiming I didn't provide adequate security?\" Rodrick\
  \ sounded outraged. \"Was the dance floor attacked by hordes of ravening demons?\
  \ Did ogres overturn the punch bowls? Did a bugbear eat the goose liver off a rich\
  \ man's plate? Were the musicians torn apart by werewolves? They were not, and I'm\
  \ sure my presence made all the difference. I gave good value for those meager coins.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Haverford spat and, to Kresley's surprise, spoke up loudly enough\
  \ for Rodrick to hear: \"The little lord paid you for your loyalty, thief. Just\
  \ for one night, but you took the coin, and you made the deal, and so were bound\
  \ by it. You betrayed him, and a man who'd betray another is no man at all. Treachery's\
  \ a worse crime than theft.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Oh, in <i>that</i> case, I'll be\
  \ right out,\" Rodrick said. Something clattered, and someone else inside the warehouse\
  \ swore.</p> \n      <p>Kresley frowned and leaned over to Haverford. \"Is that...\
  \ is there someone else in there? Does he have an accomplice?\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  It's the <i>sword</i>.\" The wizard rolled his eyes. He was fat and robed, but he\
  \ wasn't old, and didn't look like a proper wizard at all, being entirely beardless.\
  \ \"You know, the whole reason I'm here? The reason this Rodrick was hired to provide\
  \ security at the ball in the first place? He's just a man, but that Hrym is a wonder.\
  \ A talking sword of living ice.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I knew about the ice,\" Kresley\
  \ muttered. There'd been something about the sword talking, too, but he'd dismissed\
  \ it as exaggeration. The sword certainly hadn't said anything back at the little\
  \ lord's manor house.</p> \n      <p>\"I can also sing!\" the second voice called.\
  \ He—it?—sounded jovial and curmudgeonly all at once, like a drunken grandfather\
  \ at the wedding of a relative he didn't like much. </p> \n      <p>\"No, Hrym,\
  \ don't sing!\" Rodrick cried. \"We want them to <i>leave</i>, not die!\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>Kresley pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger.\
  \ He was getting a headache, and this street really did smell like every cat, dog,\
  \ and vagrant in the Coins used it as a latrine. \"All right. This is nonsense.\
  \ We're going in. Rodrick, this is your last chance—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Oh, well,\
  \ if you really want to die, I can't be blamed,\" Rodrick interrupted. \"But I have\
  \ to wonder if you've thought this through. Say one of your men manages to get a\
  \ sword into my neck before Hrym freezes him solid. What have you accomplished,\
  \ really? You can kill me, but you can't kill <i>Hrym</i>. He's a sword. And a magical\
  \ one, at that—you can't even melt him down. Believe me, many have tried.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"I daresay the lord would be pleased to have a... a talking sword...\
  \ to add to his collection.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Ha! You don't want <i>this</i> sword.\"\
  \ Rodrick's laugh was booming and hearty. \"He's cursed, you know.\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Kresley blinked. \"I... what?\"</p> \n      <p>\"My sword. Ooh, look, a magical\
  \ sentient sword of living ice, everyone's always so impressed. But, yes: he's cursed.\
  \ Cursedly cursed.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You have, by all accounts, traveled with this\
  \ blade for many years,\" Kresley said. \"In what way is it <i>cursed</i>?\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"What? Look where I am <i>now</i>,\" Rodrick said. \"I'm about to\
  \ be murdered by a bunch of household guards, of all things! Hrym's <i>obviously</i>\
  \ cursed. It's just a slow-acting curse.\" </p> \n      <p>The wizard sighed. \"\
  The sword isn't cursed. Are we going to stand around here much longer? It's only,\
  \ I've got plans.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Cursed or not, the very idea of Hrym languishing\
  \ in your master's collection disgusts me!\" Rodrick said. \"Hrym thrives on open\
  \ air, long roads leading to nowhere in particular, and a general life of adventure!\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"I wouldn't mind resting on a pile of gold coins somewhere cool\
  \ and dry, actually,\" Hrym said. \"If anyone's asking me. Which no one ever does.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Honestly!\" Rodrick said more loudly. \"Doesn't the thought of\
  \ such waste, of turning a majestic creature like Hrym into an ornament—doesn't\
  \ it sicken you, Kelso?\"</p> \n      <p>\"It's Kresley,\" Kresley said automatically.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>A long pause. \"If you say so. I'm sure you know best. But your confusion\
  \ about your own name aside, doesn't it trouble you? The way your lord and master\
  \ keeps such wonders—none as wondrous as Hrym, but still, quite wondrous—locked\
  \ up, out of sight in a vault, made useless? Is it any wonder I wanted to take a\
  \ few of them away with me? Those relics deserve to be appreciated, not kept sealed\
  \ away for one rich man's pleasure.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You were just going to sell\
  \ them,\" Hrym said. \"And for sums only another rich man could afford.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Yes, true, but I was going to sell them to <i>several</i> rich men,\
  \ to sort of spread the joy around, you see.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I get the sense\
  \ that Rodrick isn't taking us very seriously.\" Haverford looked Kresley up and\
  \ down. \"I can't imagine why.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Fine,\" Kresley snapped. \"Men,\
  \ let's go in.\"</p> \n      <p>\"The first man who comes through that door,\" Rodrick\
  \ called, \"will be frozen into an ice sculpture of himself. The process is <i>generally</i>\
  \ fatal, but at least you'll make a beautiful decoration at your own funeral.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Don't worry about it,\" the wizard said. He muttered something\
  \ and made a series of complex gestures. He stepped forward, tapping each man briefly\
  \ on the back of the neck. \"There,\" he said. \"Protection from ice, cast on all\
  \ of you. Go forth and do whatever it is people like you do. As you should have\
  \ ten minutes ago.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Protection from ice won't help if they've\
  \ got traps set up in there,\" Haverford muttered.</p> \n      <p>The wizard rolled\
  \ his eyes again. \"I wouldn't worry about it. This Rodrick probably hasn't had\
  \ to think his way out of a problem since he first got his hands on that sword.\
  \ This building, it's just an old storehouse, not an armory. They might try to push\
  \ a pile of crates on top of you, but otherwise I wouldn't fret.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Did someone out there say 'protection from ice'?\" Hrym said.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  You're still a <i>sword</i>,\" Rodrick said. \"We can, you know... cut them. Stab.\
  \ What have you.\"</p> \n      <p>\"But you're no swordsman,\" Hrym said. \"No offense,\
  \ but if it's just you against, what, three of them?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Four!\"\
  \ Haverford called, and drew his blade. \"Five, counting our illustrious leader.\"\
  \ Now he was smiling. \"Things are looking up. These are the sort of odds you like,\
  \ eh, Kelso?\"</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8528-Cover.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8528-Cover_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n       <br>Illustration by Michal Ivan\n      </div> \n      <p>\"Kresley,\"\
  \ Kresley muttered. But, yes—he did like these odds. He considered sending Haverford\
  \ in first, in case there <i>were</i> traps, but the man would look at him with\
  \ even more scorn than usual if he did that. Kresley strode forward and kicked the\
  \ door off its hinges. The interior of the storehouse was visible in light streaming\
  \ through the dusty skylights, and the space was almost entirely barren, apart from\
  \ a few cobwebbed shelves near the back. </p> \n      <p>Rodrick stood in the center\
  \ of the space, sipping from a flask and holding a crystalline longsword that shimmered\
  \ like diamonds and sent up faint curls of icy vapor all along its length. Rodrick\
  \ lifted the sword, and a blast of white wind spiraled toward the door. Kresley\
  \ winced and closed his eyes, but apart from a cool, damp breeze, he felt nothing,\
  \ and when he opened his eyes, Rodrick was making a face like he'd bitten a lemon.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Haverford shouldered in, followed by the other men. The wizard\
  \ seemed content to wait outside. \"How bad of a beating do we put on him before\
  \ we drag him back to the little lord?\" Haverford asked.</p> \n      <p>\"Medium\
  \ bad,\" Kresley said. \"Feel free to break his arms and hands, but leave the legs\
  \ and feet—otherwise we'll have to carry him the whole way back.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  You <i>are</i> cursed, Hrym,\" Rodrick said.</p> \n      <p>\"<i>You're</i> cursed,\"\
  \ the sword replied, voice emerging from the empty air in the vicinity of the blade.\
  \ \"Oh well. It's been a while since I was owned by a nobleman. As I recall, they\
  \ hardly ever sleep in ditches or haystacks.\"</p> \n      <p>The guards advanced.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>They were quite surprised when a djinni appeared before them in a swirl\
  \ of mist and wind, rising nearly eleven feet tall, its lower body a swirling funnel\
  \ of air, its upper body that of a muscular dark-skinned man, with a very solid-looking\
  \ scimitar gripped in each hand. </p> \n      <p>\"You will not harm this man,\"\
  \ the djinni intoned, dust and filth swirling around in its whirlwind. Kresley stepped\
  \ back, and even Haverford retreated a few steps. Kresley looked at the sword in\
  \ his hand. He considered dropping it so the creature wouldn't mistake it for a\
  \ threat. </p> \n      <p>\"Ha,\" Rodrick said from behind the genie. \"You didn't\
  \ expect that, did you, Kelso? I can summon djinns. Djinn. Djinnis? One of my many\
  \ skills.\"</p> \n      <p>\"No it's not,\" Hrym said. \"You've never even <i>seen</i>\
  \ a djinni before. The plural is djinn, by the way.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Shh,\" Rodrick\
  \ said. \"This is a marvelous opportunity to embellish my already considerable legend.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Kresley swallowed. \"Ah... wizard? Do you... is there such a thing\
  \ as... protection from... djinn?\" He stole a glance through the open door and\
  \ saw the wizard running away as fast as his sandaled feet could take him.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"Guess not,\" Haverford said, and ran away too, followed by the other\
  \ guards.</p> \n      <p>Kresley waited a moment longer, as befitted his position\
  \ as head of the household guard, and then he ran away as well.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
