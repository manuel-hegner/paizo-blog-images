  \  </div> \n    <p>Everyone knows goblins have an unnatural love of fire. They love\
  \ to see it flicker and burn to the sounds of their enemies' screams. While goblin\
  \ adventurers, in an effort to get along with other more squeamish races, may control\
  \ their pyromaniac urgings, others learn to harness that power and focus it into\
  \ devastating force. </p> \n    <p>Of course, since the goblin section of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a> has plenty of options\
  \ for fiery destruction, an alchemist archetype focusing on fire seemed like a good\
  \ fit, so this week we present you with the fire bomber. As you'll notice from this\
  \ archetype, there are many more options for goblin mayhem in this book, from a\
  \ host of feats to some new discoveries, but you will just have to wait until the\
  \ book comes out to check those out. </p> \n    <h2>Fire Bomber (Alchemist)</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Fire bombers are exceptionally good at using bombs to burn creatures\
  \ and blow things up, but are not quite as good at creating other types of bombs\
  \ or extracts. A fire bomber has the following class features.</p> \n    <p><b>Weapon\
  \ and Armor Proficiency:</b> A fire bomber treats torches as a simple weapon.</p>\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Andrew Hou\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Fire Bombardier\
  \ (Su or Ex):</b> At 1st level, when a fire bomber throws a bomb that deals fire\
  \ damage, all creatures in the splash radius take an additional point of damage\
  \ per die of fire damage dealt. Fire bombers only add their Intelligence bonus to\
  \ damage from bombs or alchemical substances that deal fire damage. This otherwise\
  \ works like the alchemist's bomb and throw anything abilities. This ability alters\
  \ bomb and throw anything.</p> \n    <p><b>Bonus Feats:</b> A fire bomber can select\
  \ the Burn! Burn! Burn!, Fire Tamer, or Flame Heart feat in place of a discovery.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Fiery Cocktail (Su):</b> At 4th level, whenever a fire bomber uses\
  \ a discovery that deals damage other than fire damage, he can split the damage\
  \ dice evenly between the bomb's primary damage type and 1d6 points of fire damage;\
  \ when there is an odd number of damage dice, the odd die of damage comes from the\
  \ primary damage type. For example, an 8th-level fire bomber could throw a concussive\
  \ bomb that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 3d4 points of sonic damage. Additional\
  \ effects from the bomb still apply, but the save DC for admixture bombs is reduced\
  \ by 2. This replaces the alchemist's 4th-level discovery.</p> \n    <p><b>Fire\
  \ Body (Ex):</b> At 8th level, a fire bomber adds <i>elemental body I</i> to his\
  \ extract list as a 3rd-level extract. Elemental body extracts prepared using fire\
  \ body are limited to fire elementals only. This ability replaces poison resistance\
  \ +6. </p> \n    <p><b>Improved Fire Body (Ex):</b> At 10th level, fire bombers\
  \ add <i>elemental body II</i> to their spell list as a 4th-level extract. Elemental\
  \ body extracts prepared using improved fire body are limited to fire elementals\
  \ only. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p> \n    <p><b>Greater Fire Body\
  \ (Ex):</b> At 14th level, fire bombers add <i>elemental body IV</i> to their spell\
  \ list as a 5th-level extract. Elemental body extracts prepared using greater fire\
  \ body are limited to fire elementals only. This ability replaces persistent mutagen.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Discoveries:</b> The following discoveries complement the fire bomber\
  \ archetype: fire brand, rocket bomb (see sidebar); explosive bombs, fast bombs,\
  \ inferno bomb, precise bombs (<a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i></a>); breath weapon bomb, explosive missile, immolation bomb (<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mcz\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>); bottled ooze, confusion bomb,\
  \ strafe bomb (<a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>).</p> \n\
  \    <p>Next week, WARK!</p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
