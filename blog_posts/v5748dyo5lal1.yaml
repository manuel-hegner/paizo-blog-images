  date\">Friday, October 23, 2009</p> \n   <p>It's no secret that sometimes when we\
  \ build an Adventure Path key bits of information slip through the cracks. For example,\
  \ Council of Thieves takes place entirely within and near the city of Westcrown,\
  \ and to support these adventures we're printing a nifty map of Westcrown on the\
  \ inside front covers for the duration of this campaign. That map was always intended\
  \ to be more of an art piece and a representational map that gives folks a basic\
  \ idea of the shape and layout of the city, as well as a spatial aid to keep track\
  \ of where the various adventure locations take place. But for much of the Adventure\
  \ Path, the exact distances between those various locations hasn't really mattered.\
  \ That changes with the final adventure, though, where the PCs are going to be moving\
  \ all over Westcrown to handle a lot of different situations in a relatively short\
  \ period of time.</p> \n   <p>And so I needed to figure out what the scale was for\
  \ the map of Westcrown.</p> \n   <p>As with so many other Adventure Path-related\
  \ tasks, this rapidly exploded into a pretty complex problem. While on the one hand\
  \ the map implies a specific scale (there are houses on the map, after all, and\
  \ we all have a pretty good idea of how big a normal building should be), the map\
  \ was never created with a scale in mind and thus, those buildings and streets are\
  \ not accurately sized. So that's a deceptive measurement to base a map's scale\
  \ on—initially, I used this to estimate a scale of 1 inch = 600 feet, which as it\
  \ turned out, was really a rather poor estimation.</p> \n   <p>You see, for better\
  \ or worse, the only actual unit of measurement we have nailed down in print that\
  \ helps us to measure Westcrown's size is its population—114,700 people. Having\
  \ no frame of reference as to what population density numbers were realistic or\
  \ not, I went to the Internet to do some research. And as it turned out, one of\
  \ the real world's most densely populated cities, Paris, has a population density\
  \ of something like 66,000 people per square mile, so that should probably represent\
  \ the uppermost end of the scale. And more to the point—Westcrown, for all its importance\
  \ in Golarion, is no Paris. I looked around a little bit more. Rome's is 5,495 people/square\
  \ mile. Seattle's is 7,179/square mile. New York City's is 27,440/square mile. Mexico\
  \ City's is 15,410/square mile. Venice's is 1,705/square mile. Los Angeles's is\
  \ 8,205/square mile. San Francisco's is 17,323/square mile. London's is 12,331/square\
  \ mile. Renton's is 4,625/square mile. Point Arena's is 348/square mile. And all\
  \ of these were numbers for modern cities—what would benchmark numbers from a fantasy\
  \ world like Golarion look like? Even worse... I'd gathered these numbers off the\
  \ Internet from Wikipedia... who knows how accurate the numbers really are?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>It was about this time that I started stressing out, realizing that I\
  \ was perched at the edge of a bottomless pit of statistics and urban planning and\
  \ history from which I could well fall into forever, and since I had to get back\
  \ on target and finish developing the latest adventure, I didn't really have the\
  \ luxury of such an oblivion</p> \n   <p>So I made a few assumptions. I assumed\
  \ that Wikipedia's numbers were accurate. I assumed that Golarion's baseline levels\
  \ of urban density are comparable to the modern world, and given the fact that magic\
  \ can more or less replace technological advancement and that the Inner Sea region's\
  \ been civilized for far longer than any current real world civilization, I'm not\
  \ worried that anyone can prove me wrong on this assumption.</p> \n   <p>Armed with\
  \ these assumptions, I started assigning scales. At a scale of 1 inch = 600 feet\
  \ (my original assumption), we'd have a Westcrown that covered an area of only about\
  \ 0.26 square miles for a ridiculous population density of 441,153 people per square\
  \ mile. Obviously this is way out of bounds. My desire to have numbers that fell\
  \ into something closer to the range of real world numbers, combined with my desire\
  \ to have a scale on that map that's easy to summarize, ended up with me settling\
  \ at a scale of 1 inch = 4,000 feet (just over 3/4 of a mile). At this scale, Westcrown\
  \ covers an area of just over 20 square miles, for a population density of about\
  \ 10,000 people per square mile. Kind of at the low end for modern-day numbers,\
  \ but given Westcrown's lack of skyscrapers and its relatively empty ruined quarter...\
  \ I'm actually pretty content with that figure.</p> \n   <p>We're still a few weeks\
  \ away from me having to nail down the city's scale in print, and I'm still not\
  \ convinced the complex and confusing thought process I've gone through to reach\
  \ the three scales I list above are 100% solid. So I decided to make this long-winded\
  \ blog post, and to put the numbers up for everyone to look over and pick apart\
  \ and challenge! Hopefully if there's some sort of critical flaw in my theories,\
  \ someone will point them out on the messageboards in time for me to not make a\
  \ fool of myself in print with a ridiculously unrealistic scale for the city of\
  \ Westcrown in <a href=\" http://paizo.com/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy88w6\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #30</a>!</p> \n   <p>So, unless I get proven\
  \ wrong by the end of the month or so, the scale of the map of Westcrown on the\
  \ inside covers of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/pathfinderRPG\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volumes #25–#30</a> is... 1 inch = 1 mile. Kind\
  \ of a complicated post to arrive at such a simple number, but that's sometimes\
  \ how it goes in the wild and crazy world of game design, I suppose!</p> \n   <p>James\
