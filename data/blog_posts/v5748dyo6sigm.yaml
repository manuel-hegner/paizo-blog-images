  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“So the shiny\
  \ runes are… the reflection on the water?”</p>\n      <p>“Precisely! But there are\
  \ many <em>varieties </em>and <em>states </em>of water, yes? How to maintain a reflection\
  \ upon the frothing waves, or to split one across all the drops in a storm so that\
  \ they fall in unison? What if one could calm and freeze the sea, carve off a piece\
  \ of that reflection, and deposit it in another, <em>still liquid</em> sea—and have\
  \ it <em>continue reflecting that original sea? </em>With a more <em>expansive </em>view\
  \ of magic, one not held captive by axioms or collecting dust in a university library,\
  \ one begins to see the hidden world truly unfold.\"</p>\n      <p>“Ez, I don’t\
  \ wanna be in this chair all day.”</p>\n      <p>“Yes, yes.” Ezren scowled at his\
  \ subject. “‘You can talk and tattoo at the same time,’ I believe were the exact\
  \ words. Very well.”</p>\n      <p><em>Tak</em>.</p>\n      <p>A precise blow, and\
  \ Ezren’s needle once more pierced Valeros’s skin to deposit a drop of ink. Ezren\
  \ placed the instrument on the work table, lifted another from a pot of sparking\
  \ red liquid, muttered over it, and then the stuff turned just as black as any other\
  \ ink. Valeros had asked about this about half an hour ago, which had earned him\
  \ the lecture on magical theory.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ he still had hours of pontification to sit through before the tattoo was done.<br>\n\

  \      <p><em>Tak.</em></p>\n      <p><em>Tak.</em></p>\n      <p>Ezren lifted the\
  \ striking rod, sighed brusquely, and set aside his tools. “Valeros, this patronage\
  \ lasts for weeks. Can you at least <em>try </em>to be a good conversation partner?”\
  </p>\n      <p>Valeros went to massage his temples, remembered he couldn’t move\
  \ his right arm, and growled in frustration. “That’s rich. I <em>tried</em> with\
  \ your big wet mirror analogy, you know! Hard to stay engaged when I can’t get a\
  \ word in edgewise. Plus what do I know about magic theory? You want to have a proper\
  \ conversation, you need to—\"</p>\n      <p>The workshop’s southern face exploded\
  \ inward in a storm of wood and dust. A ceiling joist smashed onto one end of Valeros’\
  s chair, knocking it over and sending him rolling across the floor. Ezren hit the\
  \ far wall, followed by several pots of ink—one of which hit the man square in the\
  \ head. He folded like an anemic bird.</p>\n      <p>Valeros, dazed, opened an eye.\
  \ No sign of sword: bad. Shield nearby: good. Shield slightly bent: standard.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Nothing broken, good. Lotta shallow stinging cuts, fair enough, not great.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Heavy, gurgling breathing, and what sounded like tightening rope.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Valeros rolled. A gnarled and glowing fist smashed through a fallen bookshelf\
  \ and practically disintegrated the floor where his torso had been. He kneeled,\
  \ lifted his shield, and turned to face his opponent.</p>\n      <p>Then swore.\
  \ “Oh, <em>give me a break</em>.”<br><br>\n       The person in front of him—he\
  \ was almost certain it was a person—needed to crouch to fit in the cramped workshop.\
  \ Which they were <em>not </em>doing, having instead used their neck and head as\
  \ a battering ram. They had ploughed through roof and wreckage in their attempt\
  \ to crush Valeros. Human-shaped, their body was covered in thick, obsidian scabs,\
  \ viscous blood pouring from fissures like molten steel into a mold. They radiated\
  \ heat like a furnace.</p>\n      <p>“Ez,” he called. “<em>Ez!</em>”</p>\n     \
  \ <p>No sound but the hot roar of the giant’s breathing—and another tightening rope.\
  \ He whipped his shield up, caught part of the blow, spun, and let the monstrosity\
  \ stagger past him.</p>\n      <p>Fast not nimble. Probably too big to take out\
  \ himself? Outmaneuver it, check on Ezren. Yeah.</p>\n      <p>Deep breath. Shield\
  \ set. Knife out. Keep moving. In, sting. Out, shield up, make space. He was the\
  \ horsefly, the heaving thing was the horse. Each bite of the blade loosed a cascade\
  \ of blazing sludge that burned its way through the floor.</p>\n      <p>Sting,\
  \ make space. Stay hard to see. Avoid the—</p>\n      <p>Valeros’s bones rattled\
  \ inside his flesh and his vision exploded with hot, angry light.</p>\n      <p>“\
  Back!”</p>\n      <p>Ezren’s voice rose over the assailant’s furnace rage. Valeros\
  \ dipped in and out of consciousness, the ringing in his ears sometimes giving way\
  \ to the <em>whoosh </em>of fire magic. He caught glimpses of Ezren wreathed in\
  \ blue-white symbols, launching gouts of flame from one hand. His other held the\
  \ snake-head staff, its eyes sapphire coals, surrounded in a blazing corona that\
  \ flared every time the creature swung at Ezren. The fists seemed to hit an invisible\
  \ barrier, and light erupted in a crackling flash.</p>\n      <p>It was pretty impressive,\
  \ honestly. But Ezren was going to run out of steam soon.</p>\n      <p>The broken\
  \ armor stand was leaning against the wall nearby, Valeros’s breastplate wrapped\
  \ around it by the force of the giant’s initial entry. He lifted it, tested its\
  \ weight. It was no sword, but it would do.</p>\n      <p>Valeros charged, makeshift\
  \ weapon high, and brought it down on the thing’s spine. It screamed in a blast\
  \ of sparks and spun toward him. Ezren continued raining flame into it. With each\
  \ one, those internal fires grew hotter, and Valeros hoped that Ezren knew what\
  \ the hell he was doing.</p>\n      <p>Then the tattoo started moving. Almost tickled,\
  \ at first. It pulsed in time with Ezren’s magic, flared when those blue-white runes\
  \ did. The tiger stripes slithered down his arm and up the erstwhile mace, and now\
  \ each blow brought its own arcane heat. In, body blow, out. In, pull attention,\
  \ out.</p>\n      <p>Then he raised the makeshift weapon high and brought it down\
  \ on the creature’s leg. It stumbled forward and fell, now almost too bright to\
  \ look at, its fissures incandescent, limbs churning on the splintered floor, little\
  \ fires beginning to sprout around it.</p>\n      <p>It howled and launched its\
  \ entire body at Valeros. At the same time, those tiger stripes leapt onto the shield\
  \ Valeros was already raising. Monster met metal, and there was a deafening thunderclap.</p>\n\
  \      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n      <p>Ezren said\
  \ it was like a kettle with no lid. Too much steam, boom. Valeros didn’t know why\
  \ you’d make a furnace-thing weak to fire, but hey, spell people were weird.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“So then what was the twisty tattoo thing?”</p>\n      <p>Valeros was\
  \ mopping up ink, again. The last mop had melted after he’d tried to use it on the\
  \ purple stuff.</p>\n      <p>Ezren looked up from the singed diagrams he was attempting\
  \ to reconstruct. “I… honestly don’t know, which is very exciting! I think the tattoo\
  \ was mimicking the ablative properties of my spellshaping. Which <em>shouldn’t</em>\
  \ have been possible, given the crystallization matrix I established, but it was\
  \ a tattoo, and blood, flesh, and hair are all traditionally puissant.\"\L\L</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Huh, I s’pose I could see that. So you moved the wet reflection to my\
  \ big red mirror?”</p>\n      <p>“…so, my friend, you <em>were</em> paying attention!”\
  </p>\n      <p>“I mean, kinda. Just… next time make it interesting, y’know? Say\
  \ what the magic <em>does</em>, not just how it works in the fantastical and esoteric\
  \ realms of the mind or whatever. You’re attaching it to <em>my</em> body, so tell\
  \ me what it does, how I can use it. That’s the interesting stuff. Sorta like learning\
  \ how someone fights.”</p>\n      <p>Ezren smiled and tapped the head of his staff\
  \ on the pewter mug hanging from Valeros’s belt.</p>\n      <p>“Well, then. What\
  \ say we talk the finer points of steel and ritual over a drink?”</p>\n      <p>Valeros\
  \ held out a hand, offering to carry Ezren’s pack on the rough road into town.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Maybe touch on who wants us dead so bad, too. Since we’ll be here for\
  \ weeks and all. But, yeah,” he said, smiling, “that sounds good.”</p>\n     </blockquote>\n\
