  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Leandra slapped\
  \ the screaming alarm cube and rubbed her eyes before burying her head in the pillow\
  \ again. <em>Ugh, too early…</em></p> \n     <p>A few minutes later she groaned\
  \ and rolled out of her bunk, stretching as she padded her way into the communal\
  \ area.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, morning, Lea. I just drank the last of the instant.\
  \ Sorry.\" Her overly chipper, and well caffeinated roommate held up the empty pot\
  \ apologetically. </p> \n     <p>“Nok! How could you? You knew I was pulling a double\
  \ today!” The scowl she leveled at the curvy ysoki would send most others hurrying\
  \ out of her way, but Nok just grinned and stretched up to kiss her on the cheek.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“I'll pick up more on the way home tonight, promise!\" She rushed\
  \ out the door in a swirl of activity and perfume, leaving Leandra to put the coffee\
  \ pot in the sink.</p> \n     <p>Thirty minutes and a disappointingly lukewarm shower\
  \ later (<em>thanks again, Nok</em>) Leandra stood in line at the popular coffee\
  \ cart just outside Ixomander’s Throne, the Azlanti-themed casino where she was\
  \ currently late for her job. She hopped from foot to foot, willing the line to\
  \ move faster before Mo-var, the meticulous android running the cart, closed for\
  \ their mid-morning break. Suddenly, an enormous vesk came hurtling out of nowhere\
  \ and plowed into her. She was knocked onto the ground, while the vesk continued\
  \ running. A willowy shirren helped her back on her feet before bolting after the\
  \ vesk, shouting “Sorry!” over their shoulder.</p> \n     <p>Leandra dusted off\
  \ her dark green pants and turned to see Mo-var pulling down their cart’s shudder.\
  \ <em>Damned tourists! Don’t they know how hard it is to keep this faux Azlanti\
  \ crap clean?</em> She threw her hands up in despair, yelling, “Come on! I was in\
  \ line and everything before those junk jockeys pushed me over!” Mo-var ignored\
  \ her, and she went to give the cart a swift kick but stopped when a glint from\
  \ the ground caught her eye. A misshapen piece of metal and plastic laid on the\
  \ sidewalk, most likely dropped by the fleeing vesk. </p> \n     <p>Leandra picked\
  \ it up and shouted in the direction the two had ran. “Just because we live near\
  \ a junkyard doesn’t mean you can litter!” She grumbled to herself about inconsiderate\
  \ off-worlders and inflexible androids, absent-mindedly slipped the piece of trash\
  \ into her pocket, and stepped into the casino.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"\
  50%\">\n     </center> \n     <br> \n     <p>Leandra stretched she trudged out of\
  \ the casino, her back aching after a grueling double shift on her feet serving\
  \ drinks to increasingly inebriated gamblers. Spying Mo-var’s coffee cart—now open\
  \ for the evening rush—and knowing that Nok probably forgot to get more instant,\
  \ she started to wander over. Her way was blocked by a pair of local gang members\
  \ (<em>True Warriors by the look of them—bunch of lowlifes</em>) diving out of the\
  \ way of the wide swing of a doshko, wielded by the same vesk from earlier in the\
  \ day. This time, a lashunta woman followed, her hands glowing with magic.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Really?” Leandra said out loud, too tired to properly process how much\
  \ danger she was currently in. Mo-var, however, seemed to understand, quickly closing\
  \ their cart window. Leandra was startled into action when a stray bullet from one\
  \ of the True Warriors’ pistols struck the casino wall just a few feet from her.\
  \ She scurried home, locked the deadbolts, and enabled the security system even\
  \ though she knew it didn’t work properly. Nok had promised to get it fixed months\
  \ ago.</p> \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <p>Nok stumbled in, giggling and slightly tipsy. The security system let\
  \ out a pair of weak, unconvincing beeps and gave up, but it was loud enough to\
  \ startle Leandra awake from where she’d dozed off on the couch. </p> \n     <p>“\
  Someone had a good night.” </p> \n     <p>Nok plopped onto the couch next to her.\
  \ “Hot date with Rush! Oh, so much fun. You should come out with us one of these\
  \ days! She even has a cute brother...” She chuckled, draping herself over Leandra.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“No time. We’re short-staffed at work. Maybe next week.” She pushed\
  \ her friend off her lap with a laugh. Nok was always trying to set her up on dates—\
  when she wasn’t on the prowl for her own that is. She’d gone on more than a few\
  \ disastrous outings at the younger girl’s urging but hadn't clicked with any of\
  \ her suitors. “Tell you what, I’ll make us both something to eat. You need something\
  \ in your stomach.” She ruffled the hair beneath Nok’s ear on her way to the kitchenette.</p>\
  \ \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <br> \n     <p>The\
  \ next day, Leandra had another double. Midway through, her feet and back were already\
  \ aching and her ears were sweltering in her fake helmet, but she kept a smile firmly\
  \ plastered on her face as she bustled between tables and the bar. Needing a break\
  \ from fending off the advances of the junk jockeys who had hit a prize and enduring\
  \ the glowering looks from the locals determined to lose all their cash, she gestured\
  \ to her manager that she was going to briefly step outside.</p> \n     <p>She ordered\
  \ a cup of her usual from Mo-var to boost her flagging energy and had barely taken\
  \ a sip when her arm was jostled from behind, sending the drink flying. </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Oh. Come. On!” She was nearly in tears as she turned to see the shirren\
  \ from the previous day. A ysoki stood next to them, looking sheepish, and the vesk\
  \ and lashunta were over by the casino entrance. </p> \n     <p>“YOU!” Leandra gasped.\
  \ “You owe me at least 3 cups of coffee!” She poked the shirren in the chest, whose\
  \ antennae twitched in confusion. “First, you knocked me out of line, then you started\
  \ that brawl in the street, and now you made me spill this one because you can’\
  t bother to watch where you’re going!”</p> \n     <p>The big vesk lumbered up to\
  \ them. “Is there a problem?” she rumbled.</p> \n     <p>“Yeah! You and your buddies\
  \ keep making me lose my coffee and I’m getting sick of it!” Leandra’s shouting\
  \ was beginning to draw a few gawkers, but she didn't care. “And another thing!\
  \ You can’t just leave trash wherever you want!” She retrieved the piece of metal\
  \ and plastic from her pocket and flung it at the vesk’s chest. The vesk fumbled\
  \ with it for a moment but didn’t drop it. Her eyes widened as she took a better\
  \ look at the scrap.</p> \n     <p>“Quig,” the vesk said, turning to the ysoki.\
  \ “This is the other half of the keycard.”</p> \n     <p>“You dropped it?!” the\
  \ ysoki asked incredulously.</p> \n     <p>“Uh, I guess so.” The vesk looked uncomfortable.\
  \ She looked back at Leandra. “Hey, sorry about all this. Let me make it up to you.\
  \ After all, I think you just saved us a lot of trouble.” She ordered an extra-large\
  \ from Mo-var, handing over enough credits to cover the price a few times over.\
  \ The android filled up a sizable travel mug with a secured lid and placed it in\
  \ the cart’s window. Leandra scooped up the coffee and chugged half of it as if\
  \ she were afraid it would get away.</p> \n     <p>“Thank you,” Leandra said. “\
  I have to get back to work now.” She turned on her heel to re-enter the casino,\
  \ hearing the other four begin to chatter excitedly with each other.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Later, she had quite the story to tell her roommate. Nok suspected the four\
  \ were treasure hunters looking for a big score out in the junk, and they must have\
  \ crossed the True Warriors in the process. Both of them speculated wildly as to\
  \ what their “keycard” unlocked well into the night.</p> \n     <center>\n     \
  \ <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <br> \n     <p>The following evening,\
  \ the four approached Leandra on the casino floor. “There she is!” the vesk bellowed\
  \ with a grin on her face. “My favorite Aeon Guard! We’ve got something for you!”\
  \ She dropped a credstick onto Leandra’s tray.</p> \n     <p>A little wary, Leandra\
  \ picked up the credstick, peeked at the display, and nearly fainted at the amount\
  \ printed there. She wrapped her arm around the vesk’s waist in gratitude.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Should be enough to keep you in coffee for a while,” the ysoki smirked.\
  \ “And when you’re done squeezing Obo to death, we’ll have a round of your most\
  \ expensive booze. In fact, make ‘em doubles. We’re celebrating another successful\
  \ mission!” </p> \n     <p>The group cheered.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
