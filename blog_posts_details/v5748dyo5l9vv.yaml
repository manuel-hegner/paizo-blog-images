  artist: "James Ryman: Victims customarily went smiling to their deaths. Only at\
    \ the very end, when they had been cast into the sea and the Children had begun\
    \ to share them, were there cries amid the blood and the floating garlands; and\
    \ both cries and blood were pleasing to the Mother. The monks sang in their growling\
    \ voices and did not notice that Stark had ceased to smile. He was still beyond\
    \ any rational thought. He only knew the death was coming swiftly through the\
    \ silken water to claim him. The life within him stirredâ€”a simple, uncomplicated\
    \ force that rose of itself to fight against extinction. Ashton was at his right\
    \ hand. At his left was a monk, and then a second monk, and then the unguarded\
    \ edge of the steps. Stark swung his left arm viciously. The blow took the nearer\
    \ monk across the throat and swept him back into those who climbed behind him.\
    \ In falling, he clutched at the second monk and cost him his balance. Blue-robes\
    \ tumbled and fell, splashing into the shallow water. Stark rushed up out of the\
    \ space he had opened, clearing more space ahead of him by knocking other monks\
    \ into the water. Hands caught at him, tearing away the garlands but slipping\
    \ on his naked, oiled body. Some of the fingers had talons that drew blood, but\
    \ they could not stop him. He gained the platform with a wild bull's rush. The\
    \ blue-robe with the horn turned about, startled. He had an especially brutish\
    \ face. Stark took the horn"
