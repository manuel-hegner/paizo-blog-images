  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Pathfinders! As\
  \ we come to the end of January, we wanted to provide an update on the status of\
  \ our digitization efforts. There’s some exciting news below, in addition to some\
  \ general information, so read on!</p> \n     <h4>Bequeathal Boons</h4> \n     <p>As\
  \ of today, there are Bequeathal boons available in the AcP store! They will allow\
  \ you to transfer access to a character option from one character to another, whether\
  \ that option is access to an item, feat, background, or another option. The price\
  \ varies based on the rarity of the option in question, and the boon should be purchased\
  \ on the character <b>giving up access</b> to that option. </p> \n     <p>For recordkeeping\
  \ (either digital or analog), write “Bequeathed” and the gaining character number\
  \ on the chronicle/boon. Make a copy of the original chronicle/boon sheet and include\
  \ it with the gaining character, leaving the original, along with the bequeathal\
  \ boon, on the character which earned the chronicle/boon.</p> \n     <p>This is\
  \ one of our most-requested options and should complete the transfer of existing\
  \ Fame boons into the AcP store. The text of the boon is below for your reference.</p>\
  \ \n     <p></p>\n     <details> <summary><b>Bequeathal Boon Text</b></summary>\
  \ \n      <p>When you acquire this boon, select one [Uncommon/Rare/Unique] character\
  \ option to which you’ve gained access through an adventure’s Chronicle Sheet or\
  \ via a no-cost boon from the online boon store (e.g., a listed magic item or a\
  \ boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion).</p> \n      <p>Choose\
  \ another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option\
  \ instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds\
  \ the lowest level able to play the Chronicle Sheet’s adventure (e.g., 5th level\
  \ for Levels 5–8). The receiving PC must also meet any prerequisites for the boon\
  \ (e.g. they must be Liked by a particular faction to access that faction’s unique\
  \ gear from <em>Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em>). On the Chronicle Sheet,\
  \ write “Bequeathed” and the recipient character’s number next to the option. You\
  \ no longer have access to that option (and must retrain the character option or\
  \ sell an item back for full cost if you acquired the option and would no longer\
  \ qualify for it). </p>\n     </details>\n     <p></p> \n     <h4>New Character\

  \ happy to announce the launch of our brand new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options</a> page for Pathfinder Society! This page, in addition to looking\
  \ fantastic, will allow us to get sanctioning out to you faster than before.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Big thanks to our tech team and art department who have worked with us\
  \ over the past couple of months to get this online; we’re very excited about it,\
  \ and we hope you find it more useful than its predecessor. Once we know we’re happy\
  \ with this page, we’ll be doing the same for Starfinder Society. This isn’t the\
  \ only page revamp we have in the works; expect more news soon!</p> \n   <h4>Status\
  \ of Known Bugs</h4> \n   <p>Last week, we met with the tech team to check in on\
  \ the status of some of the known bugs with the AcP &amp; reporting system. We identified\
  \ four major issues that we believe should be fixed with rollouts in the next couple\
  \ of months. Those bugs are:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Capping Reputation for a table\
  \ at 8, when Adventures award 12</li> \n    <li>The boon store rearranges the order\
  \ of boons, so sometimes incorrect boons are purchased</li> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Related\
  \ to this, we currently have no way to sort the boons within the store, this is\
  \ also on the fix list</li> \n    </ul> \n    <li>And finally, GMs cannot currently\
  \ download chronicle boons for scenarios they run</li> \n   </ul> \n   <br clear=\"\
  all\"> \n   <p>As these bugs are fixed, we’ll notify you via blog posts. If we don’\
  t believe they will be fixed by the deadlines we’ve set internally, we’ll provide\
  \ workarounds until they are. We thank you for your patience! If you’ve noticed\
  \ any bugs with reporting or the boon store that don’t fall under any of these umbrellas,\
  \ let us know on the forums or by emailing pfsreportingerrors[at]paizo[dot]com.</p>\
  \ \n   <h4>End of Fame Purchases</h4> \n   <p>As we announced last month, <b>January\
  \ 31</b> is the last day to use Fame to purchase boons. As of that date, any remaining\
  \ Fame will have no value and cannot be used. The “Retired Rewards” section will\
  \ remain in the Guide for reference, but Fame will no longer be earned or spent\
  \ in any way. Boons purchased with Fame can still be used, and progression boons\
  \ such as Eager Protégé can be fulfilled.</p> \n   <p>We thank you all for your\
  \ patience as we transition our programs. We know there are bumps any time we make\
  \ program changes, but once these final pieces settle into place, we believe the\
  \ program will be better for it.</p> \n   <p>A gentle reminder that the <em>Guns\
  \ and Gears</em> playtest ends on February 5th, so you are in the last week for\
  \ running games and taking the survey. Please check back next Thursday for our February\
  \ program updates. </p> \n   <p>As always, stay healthy and safe, and don’t forget\
  \ to Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p> \n   <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
