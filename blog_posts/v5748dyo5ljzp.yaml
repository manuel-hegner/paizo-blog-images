  \ the old me, baby. March those eyes over this fresh new look.</p> \n    <p>Hmmm?\
  \ Oh, I'm not the only magus in this game? Well, I declare. Still, they don't look\
  \ like the kind of magi that'd show you the things you deserve in life. Such a serious\
  \ look. They're just a bit too goody-two-shoes for my taste. Maybe we should take\
  \ a walk to another location?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ of fighters in here. Let's pick up the pace.</p> \n    <p>Wanna see a magic trick?\
  \ I take this little dagger here, and... voila! It grew up and is now my best friend.\

  \ You say you've seen wizards and sorcerers before? Well, you haven't seen anything\
  \ like this.</p> \n    <p>Now, I'm going to tell you something I don't tell everyone:\
  \ I don't like to dance around. When I want something, I get it. Even if I have\
  \ to make the earth move first. But I can do so much more than that. Anywhere you\
  \ want to go, I can take you. That guy who was bothering you before? I can drop\
  \ him into the mouth of an active volcano, and you can come along for the ride just\
  \ to enjoy the view. You like tropical sunsets, yes?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ <p>Say, take a look at that view. We just can't be caught in this heavenly glow\
  \ without the best clothes. You see that warpriest down there covered in ill-fitting,\
  \ rusted-out shingles? It's like those half-orcs don't even <i>have</i> haberdashers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That coat might be a bit warm, up there on the volcano. My jerkin? Well,\
  \ yes. It's more than just buttery soft and fashionable leather. Not only does it\
  \ match the gloves, but together, they keep me and Gallivance going all night. Like\
  \ my glasses? They're very special. Maybe I'll show you what they do later.</p>\

  \ things, humans. They may be short-lived, but they do have their uses.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Her? She's from the House of Thrune. Important? Not really. Sometimes she\
  \ holds Gallivance while I'm otherwise occupied. She can hold your coat, too, while\
  \ we're at the volcano. It's a beautiful place, really. Like a forge made for the\
  \ gods themselves. I feel like I can do anything when I'm there. Ready to go?</p>\
