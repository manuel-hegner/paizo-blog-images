  description\">Nixret looked over the sides of the rickety fishing boat and sighed\
  \ before quickly remembering how much she hated ocean voyages, quickly bringing\
  \ her gaze down to the wooden deck before another wave of nausea could overwhelm\
  \ her. The captain of the small boat, Masuhei Okonase, was deftly navigating the\
  \ relatively calm seas on the way to Kayajima from Sakakabe in Minkai. Despite this,\
  \ even the slight motion of the <em>Auspicious Pearl</em> on the waves left Nixret\
  \ reeling. “Kobolds were not meant for sea travel,” she opined miserably in her\
  \ head. Of course she wouldn’t voice any such complaints. That’s not what heroes\
  \ did.</p>\n      <p>Last year she was saved by the real deal, when that weird planar\
  \ nexus had trapped the Tskikha iruxi enclave along with some Pathfinder initiates–\
  herself included. It was all she could do to keep her wits about her in that crisis,\
  \ but the agents sent to rescue them did more than that–they got everyone home.\
  \ After that she had redoubled her efforts, achieved her confirmation, and was even\
  \ recognized by Kreighton Shaine for her part in helping those Pathfinder agents\
  \ resolve the Blackwood Crisis. She nervously grasped the wayfinder he’d gifted\
  \ her, feeling its weight. “And now I’m the hero,” she thought to herself.</p>\n\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Giorgio Falconi</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Of\
  \ course, heroism would have to wait. Newly confirmed agents were rarely sent on\
  \ the most dangerous of missions and this was no different: routine maintenance\
  \ on the leylines of Kayajima to keep the Three Gates Lodge properly protected.\
  \ Still, she could hope. She risked another bout of nausea as she glanced around\
  \ at her fellow Pathfinders. A few—like Kisuke, a kitsune sorcerer, and Tara, a\
  \ human with aspirations to be a swordlord—were well known to her. Their goading\
  \ was at the root of most of her misadventures resulting in angry lectures or extra\
  \ chores during her time as an initiate. The tanuki sitting with them, Mochi, was\
  \ apparently field commissioned after some incident in the Maze of the Open Road.\
  \ Nixret didn’t really know the details, but wilder rumors spoke of a dance-off,\
  \ and that couldn’t be right.</p>\n      <p>Noting her gaze Kisuke gave a grin,\
  \ “Didn’t think kobold scales changed color, but I swear yours are looking even\
  \ greener.” Nixret shot the kitsune a withering look, but the sight of the horizon\
  \ bobbing up and down behind him sent her stomach reeling. Though her friend meant\
  \ well, she was not enjoying this part of adventuring. Where were the dragons? The\
  \ beasts barring her path? The artifacts of power they all would need to race to\
  \ collect? She sighed and gave voice to her thoughts. “Weren’t we supposed to be\
  \ adventuring, not doing cleaning and maintenance over some leylines that our predecessors\
  \ already made safe?”</p>\n      <p>Her three companions nodded in understanding,\
  \ but Tara calmly noted, “we can hardly be expected to be handed responsibility\
  \ right after our Confirmations. I’m sure greater challenges will come. Besides,\
  \ the task is important or else Venture-Captain Mukai wouldn’t have requested our\
  \ help.” Nixret envied her friend’s ability to remain calm and composed–even when\
  \ egging Nixret on to break curfew–but had to admit that she had a point. Besides,\
  \ who knows when a routine mission could turn into a crisis? If nothing else, the\
  \ events back in the Blackwood Swamp proved that without a shadow of a doubt. “\
  Sometimes I just wish these routine tasks could turn into something much more epic,”\
  \ she said with a sigh.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\
