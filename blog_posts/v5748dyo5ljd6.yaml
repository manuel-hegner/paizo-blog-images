  \ a few Venture-Lieutenant to Venture-Captain promotions, as well as some shifts\
  \ in geographical location. In some cases, we created new regions, in others just\
  \ changed titles to better reflect the region each volunteer covered. One Venture-Captain\
  \ is currently listed \"At Large\" as he is in the middle of moving to the United\
  \ States and we didn't want to ask him to step down before we knew where he was\
  \ landing. As so many shifts occurred, I thought I would take a moment and post\
  \ them here.</p> \n    <p>Moves in the VC team...</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <blockquote>\

  \ \n    <p>With 2016 coming to a close, we would like to say thank you to all the\
  \ volunteers that helped organize games, plan conventions, and spread the love of\
  \ the Pathfinder Society and games in general. Without you, we would not have such\
  \ a thriving community. To those continuing to volunteer, I look forward to working\
  \ with you. For those that stepped back from their positions during 2016, we appreciate\
  \ your efforts and energies. May you find some time to roll dice and play as the\
  \ new year turns.</p> \n    <h2>5 Star GMs</h2> \n    <p>Fortunately for players\
  \ across the world, our GM team keeps busy running games in venues everywhere. This\
  \ month, five more individuals achieved their fifth star by running 150 games, including\
  \ 10 special events, and running an observation game for a Venture-Captain. Thank\
  \ you to these individuals for donating such a large amount of time to our hobby.\
  \ We are much richer for all the gifts you bring to the table!</p> \n    <blockquote>\

  \ we haven't wrapped 2016, we've already started working on the 2017 conventions.\
  \ Heck, we started working on some aspects before the conventions completely wrapped,\
  \ but now preparation speed moves up a notch. The PFS team submitted a tentative\
  \ travel schedule and now must wait for it to work through the approval process.\
  \ We've looked at the scenario schedule and started thinking about our special events.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One of the most important parts of convention planning is getting a team\
  \ of leads and sub-leads in place that work well together, as we will spend quite\
  \ a bit of time working together to make the convention a success. I've reached\
  \ out to prior year leads for Gen Con, PaizoCon, and PAX West to confirm who is\
  \ returning, but I am also looking to add to the teams for each of the convention.\
  \ There is at least one lead position available at each convention, as well as a\
  \ few sub-leads.</p> \n    <p>So, if you are interested in being a lead or sub-lead\
  \ for Gen Con, PaizoCon, or PAX Prime, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:tonya.woldridge@paizo.com\"\
  >tonya.woldridge@paizo.com</a> with the subject line \"Application—Convention Name.\"\
  \ I've included questions in the spoiler. All emails need to be received by <b>December\
  \ 31, 2016 at 8:00 PM Pacific time</b>. All emails will get an email acknowledging\
  \ receipt. Potential lead/sub-lead candidates will be contacted the first week of\
  \ January to arrange a group call with the leads of the convention they applied\
  \ for. Decisions on who gets the positions will be made and announced by mid-January.</p>\
