  \ Peak</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 7, 2008</p> \n   <p>Though we're\
  \ working hard to get the Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play PDF released\
  \ on Friday, we thought we'd take a small break from the action and show you a few\
  \ of the faction feats that'll be available in our organized play system. During\
  \ character creation, after you've chosen your faction, you'll get to choose one\
  \ free bonus feat from your faction's unique feat list. There are six available\
  \ feats per faction to choose fromâ€”here's a sample feat from each faction:</p>\n\
  \   <p> </p>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>FREEDOM FIGHTER</b><br> Your family has\
  \ long battled the foes of freedom and you are skilled in waging guerilla campaigns\
  \ against oppressors. <br> Prerequisite: Andoran Faction<br> Benefit: You get a\
  \ +2 bonus on Hide skill checks. In addition, you receive a +1 circumstance bonus\
  \ on attack rolls when you attack a flat-footed foe during the surprise round.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>SCION OF THE NINE HELLS</b><br> Your bloodline is mingled with powerful\
  \ fiends and you rarely fear their fire. <br> Prerequisite: Cheliax Faction<br>\
  \ Benefit: You gain fire resistance 2. This resistance increases by +1 for every\
  \ six levels you possess, to a maximum of 5 at 18th level.</p> \n    <p><b>STAY\
  \ DEATH'S EMBRACE</b><br> Your studies of death and your devout worship of Pharasma\
  \ have unlocked many secrets of the great beyond. As a result, it is harder to send\
  \ you there. <br> Prerequisite: Osirion Faction, worshipper of Pharasma<br> Benefit:\
  \ You have a 25% chance to stabilize each round when below 0 hit points. Once stable,\
  \ you become conscious one round later, although you are still disabled.<br> Normal:\
  \ You have a 10% chance to stabilize each round when below 0 hit points.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>HORSE LORD</b><br> Your people are masters of battling on horseback and\
  \ you have mastered their rare skill. <br> Prerequisite: Qadira Faction<br> Benefit:\
  \ You get a +2 bonus on Ride skill checks. While mounted, you also receive a +1\
  \ dodge bonus to your Armor Class.</p> \n    <p><b>VINDICTIVE</b><br> Prone to endless\
  \ fueds, your people simply do not forgive a slight easily.<br> Prerequisite: Taldor\
  \ Faction<br> Benefit: You receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls made against creatures\
  \ that damaged you in the previous round with a ranged or melee attack.</p> \n \
