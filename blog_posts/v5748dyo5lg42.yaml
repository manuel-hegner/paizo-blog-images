  description\">A contingent of horse warriors escorted Roshad back to the city, following\
  \ at a respectful distance but doing nothing to disguise their presence. At the\
  \ Gate of Winds, they finally closed and encircled him, not moving until he dismounted\
  \ and handed back the reins of the horse he'd stolen in his flight. Then they turned\
  \ and rode back north without saying a word.</span></p> \n    <p>Which was just\
  \ fine with Roshad. He had the feeling that if they'd said anything, he would have\
  \ burned them all where they sat, and promises to Bors be damned.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ then, did a promise to Bors mean anything anymore? It certainly didn't seem that\
  \ the horse prince had much regard for the words they'd whispered in beds and barrooms,\
  \ on rooftops under the moon.</p> \n    <p><i>And should I be surprised?</i> After\
  \ all, who was Roshad to lay claim to the heir to the Horse Throne?</p> \n    <p>Roshad\
  \ passed through the city gates without incident, though without Bors at his side\
  \ the gray wrappings and loose chain around his waist drew stares. After a moment\
  \ he removed the chain from his collar and coiled it over his shoulder.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Before him, Ular Kel, greatest city of Karazh, rolled out its majesty. The\
  \ slope from north to south lent him a god's-eye view of the sea of rooftops. From\
  \ here, he could see the grand crossroads that gave the Caravan City its life, each\
  \ of the four great gates birthing roads that would take him places he knew only\
  \ from stories: Avistan. Garund. The great Castrovin Sea. All his life, he had longed\
  \ to set foot on those roads, to follow them to the mysteries at their ends. Yet\
  \ the knowledge of what he was—a citified street-rat with an inconveniently sharp\
  \ tongue and only half a knack for magic—had always kept him here.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ Bors. Bors, who hadn't laughed at his dreams but shared them. Who had followed\
  \ him into his filthy haunts and hidey-holes, stolen with him, learned the language\
  \ of the streets. And who had told him all about life on the steppe, the sunsets\
  \ over fields of grass stretching on without end, where a man could ride for days\
  \ and never see another soul. Bors, who had dreamed them a life beyond Ular Kel.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And now he was gone.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-RedemptionEngine-Bors.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Bors isn't one to mince words.\n    </div> \n   \
  \ <p>Roshad screamed, startling a procession of shaven-headed priests. He ignored\
  \ them and sprinted flat-out at a cart filled with dawn melons. One foot caught\
  \ the wheel, the other the cart's side, and then he was airborne and pulling himself\
  \ up onto a stone-carver's awning. He made a short jump to a window, startling the\
  \ woman cooking flatbread inside, then swung up onto the roof.</p> \n    <p>He ran,\
  \ not caring where he went, just needing to move. He hurtled over gaps that would\
  \ normally have given him pause, sometimes dropping half a story to lower roofs,\
  \ tucking into a roll to distribute the impact. He didn't bother with magic, free\
  \ climbing up the mud-brick walls with only his hands and feet.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ was nearing the center of the city, the grand market where the caravan routes\
  \ met. Above him rose the city's great landmarks, guiding him in. There were the\
  \ Water Houses, the fortress-cisterns of the Water Lords who owned the city, their\
  \ life-giving aqueducts stretching out like spiderwebs. And there was the Spire\
  \ of Azi, a thin needle of gold stabbing into the sky, where mystics blinded themselves\
  \ staring at the sun in an effort to understand Sarenrae's divine will. </p> \n\
  \    <p>And then he saw where his path had led him. Roshad didn't fight it, just\
  \ let the momentum carry him across the ledge and down through the window.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Into stillness. Silence. Sunbeams caught motes of dust, yet nothing else\
  \ moved in the little apartment.</p> \n    <p>Apartment, hell—it was nothing but\
  \ a squat, and Roshad knew he shouldn't kid himself. A pallet on the floor. A lantern.\
  \ A few buckets and a screen for privacy. Most importantly, a door that had been\
  \ boarded up by its landlord after the Ghost Plague and never unsealed. </p> \n\
  \    <p>And just like that, the frantic energy left him. Roshad ripped the veil\
  \ from his face—what was the point, now?—and collapsed onto the pallet. He pulled\
  \ the ragged blanket into a puddle and buried his face in it, shutting out the light.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>No relief there. The cloth was heady with the smell of Bors, the sweet\
  \ stink of man and horse. It invaded Roshad's silence, until finally he cast it\
  \ away and rolled onto his back, staring at the cracked ceiling.</p> \n    <p>Why?\
  \ How, after all this time—after so many stolen afternoons, the constant game of\
  \ excuses and evasions—how could Bors look at him and say it was over?</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Roshad understood, of course. It was to protect Roshad. Bors wasn't one for\
  \ idle threats, and Roshad doubted very much that the hakan of the horse tribes\
  \ was any better. No, Bors knew that if he didn't accede to his father's demands,\
  \ the hakan would simply have Roshad killed.</p> \n    <p>If that was it, they could\
  \ have worked with that—played along until the hakan let his guard down, then made\
  \ one last escape. But that wasn't what Roshad had seen in Bors's eyes. In that\
  \ canvas-topped throne room, Bors had understood that they had never really fooled\
  \ his father, and that any attempt at subterfuge would just result in Roshad's death.\
  \ If he wanted to save Roshad's life, he had to say goodbye.</p> \n    <p>And he\
  \ had to mean it.</p> \n    <p>Roshad reached up to wipe the tears from his eyes,\
  \ and the coiled chain dug painfully into his shoulder. He pulled it off and let\
  \ it run through his fingers, clicking off links like prayer beads.</p> \n    <p>Tomorrow\
  \ at dawn, Bors would be married. Roshad could close his eyes and picture it: The\
  \ open tent, the slit palms mingling blood. The tying of the cloth. And as soon\
  \ as it was done, Bors's father would push him into the challenge, making him draw\
  \ the wooden Succession Sword and fight for leadership of the tribe. The older man\
  \ was eager to pass his burden and secure the tribe's future, and that meant Bors.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>The future. Did Roshad even <i>have</i> a future, without Bors?\
  \ He could ride out with the next caravan, but what was the point? In his heart,\
  \ he'd still be here. Chain links bit into his palm as his fists clenched.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Be the chain</i>. That's what they'd sworn, watching the Iridian Fold\
  \ men in the darkness. To be one mind, one spirit. Without Bors, Roshad might as\
  \ well be dead.</p> \n    <p>Slowly, damp cheeks twisted into a smile. </p> \n \
  \   <p>If he was already dead, then what did he have to lose?</p> \n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The sun was still below the horizon, but already the\
  \ grasses of the steppe were lightening, waving in the breeze. Ahead, the nomad\
  \ camp was just beginning to stir, the silence of sleep broken by the snort of horses,\
  \ the flap of canvas, and the small sounds of cookfires being kindled. </p> \n \
  \   <p>There was little cover out here, save for the long grass. Roshad crouched\
  \ low and moved as quickly as he could. Once in the shadows of the first few tents,\
  \ he straightened and began walking normally. A half-repaired saddle sitting unattended\
  \ near one of the tents caught his eye, and he hoisted it onto his shoulder. Better\
  \ and better.</p> \n    <p>He felt naked, walking with his face exposed like this,\
  \ but the veil and grays would have been an instant giveaway. Instead, he wore one\
  \ of the long caftans the nomads called <i>deels</i>, a patchy fur jacket, and a\
  \ small satchel—all dull, threadbare, and purchased for three times their value\
  \ from an ex-nomad back in the city. Roshad's blue eyes might still give him away\
  \ if anyone looked closely—such things were rare among the horse tribes—but he hoped\
  \ the predawn shadows would hide them for now.</p> \n    <p>Long before Roshad had\
  \ begun to discover sorcery, life on the streets had taught him an even more fundamental\
  \ magic trick: walk with purpose—preferably with a uniform or artisan's tools—and\
  \ you can go anywhere. A tradesman at work is invisible, beneath the notice of all\
  \ but children.</p> \n    <p>So he walked, carrying his broken saddle, past old\
  \ women boiling water and the tent-muffled sounds of waking. In moments, he was\
  \ standing before the curtain wall ringing the Trade Palace.</p> \n    <p>Here the\
  \ easy part ended. At the break in the wall stood an armed guard. Beyond him, the\
  \ grounds were busier than the rest of the camp, with workers passing to and fro.\
  \ On the right side of the palace, Roshad could see people constructing a large\
  \ tent over a raised platform and altar.</p> \n    <p><i>The wedding pavilion</i>.\
  \ Roshad ground his teeth, but there was no time to think about that now. He could\
  \ haul himself up and over the wall in an eyeblink—no doubt the horse tribes considered\
  \ any wall tall enough to stop cavalry sufficient defense—but that would attract\
  \ too much attention. Instead, he approached the guard. \"You! Can you return this\
  \ saddle for me?\"</p> \n    <p>The guard eyed him suspiciously. \"What?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"This saddle.\" Roshad tossed the thing on the ground at the man's feet.\
  \ As the guard's gaze followed it, Roshad quickly twisted his hand into the correct\
  \ gesture and coughed to cover the final words of the incantation.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ man's face changed. Suspicion drained away like water, replaced by a round-cheeked\
  \ smile. \"I know you, don't I?\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad smiled back. \"Of course you\
  \ do. We rode down those horse thieves two years back.\" He took in the bags under\
  \ the man's eyes, the flushed skin. \"Don't tell me you drank so much at the celebration\
  \ that you forgot me?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Me? Drink too much? You sound like my wife!\"\
  \ The man laughed, then looked down at the saddle. His smile turned to a look of\
  \ genuine apology. \"I'm sorry, though—I can't leave my post.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Still as lazy as ever, I see. Fair enough—just let me past, then, hey?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The guard looked uncertain. \"I don't know if—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Damn it,\
  \ man!\" Roshad jabbed a finger at the saddle. \"If I don't return this to the prince\
  \ before the wedding, who knows when he'll find time to pay me? I'll be eating grass\
  \ with the horses.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Besides, we're all\
  \ going to be in here once the sun rises anyway. The only difference is that other\
  \ people will have had time to dress properly, while I'll look like a half-plucked\
  \ chicken.\"</p> \n    <p>The guard made up his mind. \"Fine, but be quick about\
  \ it. And you owe me a drink.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Done.\" Roshad picked up the saddle\
  \ and slapped the man on the back. \"Where are the prince's quarters?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>The guard pointed to the side of the palace opposite the wedding construction.\
  \ \"Around the back there. Second story, I think.\"</p> \n    <p>Roshad grunted\
  \ appreciatively and took up the saddle again, then walked quickly through the bustle.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>No point trying for the main doors—inside the fortress there'd be too\
  \ many people for a simple charm spell to be effective, and the servants in charge\
  \ of the wedding preparations would be too likely to know who was supposed to be\
  \ where. That left the direct approach.</p> \n    <p>Roshad reached the indicated\
  \ spot. Here on the western side of the palace, the shadows were still long. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Perfect. Roshad dropped the saddle, glanced around to make sure no one\
  \ was watching, then cast the spell. There was no outward effect, but as he touched\
  \ the stone he felt the effortless security of his hold. Reaching up, he began to\
  \ climb.</p> \n    <p>This part of the palace was fully stone, with no canvas anywhere.\
  \ At the first set of windows, arched and glassless, Roshad paused and peeked through,\
  \ moving his head slowly so as not to attract attention. Below him, men and women\
  \ bustled about kneading dough and using paddles to move pastries in and out of\
  \ a great stone oven. Roshad's spirits rose—royal quarters would of course be near\
  \ the kitchen chimneys for easy heating on cold nights.</p> \n    <p>He kept climbing.\
  \ The second set of windows was almost at the top of the wall. Once more, he peeked\
  \ through.</p> \n    <p>Bors stood in an opulent bedchamber, its stone hung with\
  \ tapestries depicting herds of horses and branching royal lineages. He was dressed\
  \ in his usual armor, but it had been polished to a mirror shine and augmented with\
  \ a bright red sash. A brilliant yellow armband embroidered with a horse sigil wrapped\
  \ around his right bicep, and his huge two-handed sword stood scabbarded against\
  \ the wall, a smaller but intricately carved wooden practice sword thrust through\
  \ his sash instead. His helmet was off, and he was leaning on a table with both\
  \ hands, staring into a large oval mirror.</p> \n    <p>Roshad slipped silently\
  \ through the window, then stopped, uncertain. Up until this moment, he'd been filled\
  \ with purpose, but now, seeing Bors...</p> \n    <p>Bors turned slowly, casually,\
  \ and gave Roshad a sad smile.</p> \n    <p>\"What took you so long?\"</p> \n  \
