  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Wayfinder. Bag of holding. Ring of the ram.\
  \ Staff of power. Holy avenger</i>.</p> \n    <p>The magic items you find during\
  \ your adventures become a part of your story and let you do things beyond the techniques\
  \ you've mastered and the spells you know. So how do these essentials of the game\
  \ work in the Pathfinder Playtest?</p> \n    <p>Magic items are used in three major\
  \ ways: by investing them, by activating them, or automatically. Invested items\
  \ are ones you wear that you have to prepare as you don them, after which they work\
  \ continuously. Activating items follows a system similar to that used for spells.\
  \ Just as casting a spell requires you to spend actions to supply the somatic, verbal,\
  \ and material components of the spell, activated items require you to use the Command\
  \ Activation, Focus Activation, or Operate Activation action, or a combination of\
  \ multiple actions. A potion requires you to spend an Operate Activation action\
  \ to drink it. A <i>necklace of fireballs</i> requires you to spend 2 Operate Activation\
  \ actions to unbind a bead and throw it. Activating a <i>luck blade</i> to reroll\
  \ an attack just takes a mental nudge with a Focus Activation reaction (though you\
  \ get to do that only once per day). Automatic activation happens with a small category\
  \ of items that give their benefit whenever they're used for their normal purpose.\
  \ A prime example is a sword with the <i>frost</i> property rune, which is always\
  \ coated with frost and needs only hit a foe to deal extra cold damage.</p> \n \

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Resonance</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Activating or investing an item costs 1 Resonance Point (RP). You might\
  \ have heard a bit about this on the Glass Cannon podcast! Resonance is a new resource\
  \ all characters have that can be used to activate items. Your innate magic item\
  \ resonance is represented by a number of Resonance Points equal to your level plus\
  \ your Charisma modifier. This ties back to the Pathfinder First Edition concept\
  \ of Charisma as the main ability score tied to innate magic, as seen in the Use\
  \ Magic Device skill and the fact that Charisma is used for spell-like abilities,\
  \ oracles, sorcerers, and so forth. However, in Pathfinder Second Edition, true\
  \ scholars of itemcraft *cough*alchemists*cough* might get to use their Intelligence\
  \ instead.</p> \n    <p>The idea of resonance stems from the Pathfinder First Edition\
  \ occultist, who was able to tap into the magical potential of items, and even before\
  \ that to the idea of resonance between creatures and various magic items, as seen\
  \ with the resonant powers of <i>wayfinders</i>. We've expanded that concept to\
  \ apply to everyone. In practical terms, you're really unlikely to run out of Resonance\
  \ Points unless you're using an absurd number of items, and you're at the greatest\
  \ risk at low levels. You still have a chance even if your pool is empty, though.\
  \ You can overspend Resonance Points! If you're at 0 RP, you can attempt to activate\
  \ or invest an item anyway. You need to attempt a flat check (a d20 roll with no\
  \ modifiers) against a DC equal to 10 + the number of points you've overspent today.\
  \ So the first item has a 50% chance of working, and it gets more risky from there.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We expect Resonance Points to be a contentious topic, and we're really\
  \ curious to see how it plays at your tables. It's one of the more experimental\
  \ changes to the game, and the playtest process gives us a chance to see it in the\
  \ wild before committing to it. Here are the advantages we see from a design perspective:</p>\
  \ \n    <ol> \n     <li>Using items is clear and consistent. Spend the required\
  \ actions and 1 RP, and you activate or invest your item. If someone else wants\
  \ to use the same item, you can remove it and let them put it on and invest it themselves.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>You have less to track. We get to remove some of the sub-pools that\
  \ individual items have (such as \"10 rounds per day which need not be consecutive\"\
  \ or \"5 charges\") because we know you have an overall limited resource. There\
  \ are still some items that can't be used without limit, but they get to be special\
  \ exceptions rather than being common out of necessity.</li> \n     <li>It puts\
  \ the focus on the strongest items. Because you can't activate items indefinitely,\
  \ your best bet is to use the most RP-efficient item, not the most gp-efficient\
  \ item. You want a high-level healing wand because you get more healing for your\
  \ Resonance Point rather than getting a bunch of low-level wands because they're\
  \ cheap.</li> \n     <li>Investiture limits what you can wear. That means we don't\
  \ need to rely heavily on an item slot system, creating more flexibility in what\
  \ kind of worn items are useful. You'll read more about this on the blog on Friday,\
  \ when we talk about removing the magic item Christmas tree!</li> \n    </ol> \n\
  \    <p>Will those benefits be compelling? Will people prefer this system over the\
  \ Pathfinder First Edition system? We look forward to finding out!</p> \n    <p>Want\
  \ to look at an item to see how this works in practice?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Cloak of Elvenkind <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Item 10+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Illusion, Invested, Magical</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use </b>worn, cloak; <b>Bulk</b>\
  \ L</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Focus Activation,\
  \ [[A]] Operate Activation</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, and is\
  \ embroidered with gold trim and symbols of significance to the elves. The cloak\
  \ allows you to cast the <i>ghost sound</i> cantrip as an innate arcane spell. When\
  \ you draw the hood up over your head (an Interact action), the cloak transforms\
  \ to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, giving you an item\
  \ bonus to Stealth checks. If you activate the cloak, you pull the hood up and are\
  \ affected by <i>invisibility </i>for 1 minute or until you pull the hood back down,\
  \ whichever comes first.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type </b>standard;\
  \ <b>Level</b> 10; <b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The\
  \ cloak grants a +3 bonus.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type </b>greater;\
  \ <b>Level</b> 18; <b>Price</b> 24,000 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The\
  \ cloak grants a +5 bonus, and <i>invisibility</i> is 4th level. If you're also\
  \ wearing <i>greater boots of elvenkind</i>, the <i>greater cloak of elvenkind</i>\
  \ allows you to Sneak in forest environments even when creatures are currently observing\
  \ you.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Here's a fairly complex item to show multiple\
  \ parts of the system at once. The <i>cloak of elvenkind</i> is level 10, and there's\
  \ also a <i>greater cloak of elvenkind</i> with an item level of 18. In case you\
  \ missed it in the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq6?Secrets-of-Alchemy\"\
  ><b>crafting blog</b></a>, items have levels now, which indicate the point at which\
  \ you can craft them (as well as being handy for the GM when making treasure hoards).\
  \ Method of use indicates that this item is worn and that it's a cloak. A few items\
  \ have this two-part listing because they're hard to wear multiples of. Multiple\
  \ cloaks, multiple boots... not practical. Multiple rings or amulets? No problem.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This item is both invested (note the invested trait) and activated (as\
  \ you can see by the activation entry). Investing the cloak lets you cast <i>ghost\
  \ sound</i>. You get this benefit as long as the cloak is invested, which means\
  \ you can cast the spell whenever you want without activating the cloak and therefore\
  \ without spending more Resonance Points. You can also get an item bonus to Stealth\
  \ checks from the cloak (+3 or +5 for a greater cloak). Finally, you can activate\
  \ the cloak as you raise the hood, spending 1 Resonance Point to turn invisible!\
  \ Certainly not every item has as much going on as a <i>cloak of elvenkind</i>,\
  \ but several classic items seemed like they needed a little extra special treatment!\
  \ What do you think? Too much?</p> \n    <p>How about something simpler?</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Floating Shield <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">Item 13</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Magical</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 2,800 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use </b>held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Operate Activation</p> \n     <hr style=\"\
  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">This master-quality light\
  \ wooden shield (Hardness 6) protects you without requiring you to spend actions\
  \ each round. When you activate this shield, you can release it from your grip as\
  \ a part of that action. The shield floats in the air next to you, granting you\
  \ its bonus automatically, as if you Raised the Shield. Because you're not wielding\
  \ the shield, you can't use reactions such as Shield Block with the shield.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground,\
  \ ending its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can grasp\
  \ it with an Interact action, ending its floating effect.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>You can hold this and use it just like any other shield. Activating it\
  \ lets you free up a hand to cause the shield to float, where it protects you without\
  \ you spending an action! While the <i>floating shield </i>offers far less Hardness\
  \ than many magic shields of a similar level (some have Hardness up to 18!), it's\
  \ not meant for Shield Block, and its abilities allow you to use it even with a\
  \ character who needs both hands for other things.</p> \n    <p>Now let's look at\
  \ two special types of items: one revamped classic and one brand-new category!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Staves</h2> \n    <p>We went through several different iterations of\
  \ staves. They needed to remain a powerful tool for spellcasters, but we also wanted\
  \ them to appear earlier in the game so you didn't have to wait for most staves\
  \ to appear at higher levels. Let's see the <i>staff of healing</i>!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Staff of Healing <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Item 3+</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Invested, Magical, Necromancy,\
  \ Staff</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand;\
  \ <b>Bulk</b> 1</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> Cast a Spell\
  \ (1 RP)</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Made of smooth white wood, this staff is capped at each end with a golden cross\
  \ adorned with a multitude of ruby cabochons. A <i>staff of healing</i> adds an\
  \ item bonus to the Hit Points you restore any time you cast the <i>heal </i>spell\
  \ using your own spell slots, using charges from the staff, or from channel energy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> minor; <b>Level</b> 3; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 60 gp; <b>Maximum Charges</b> 3</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The item\
  \ bonus to <i>heal</i> spells is +1.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><i> stabilize</i>\
  \ (cantrip)</li> \n      <li><i>heal</i> (level 1)</li> \n     </ul> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>I've included only the level 3 <i>minor staff of healing</i> here. There\
  \ are also versions at levels 7, 11, and 15, and they add higher-level <i>heal</i>\
  \ spells, plus <i>restoration</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>restore senses</i>,\
  \ and more! A staff is tied to you, which means you have to invest it, unlike most\
  \ held items. This investiture has two extra benefits. First off, it links the staff\
  \ to you, preventing anyone else from investing the staff for 24 hours. More importantly,\
  \ it restores charges to the staff equal to the highest level of spell you can cast.\
  \ You don't have to expend any spells to do this; it's all part of using your Resonance\
  \ Points. You'll notice this also means that if you find one of these as a 1st-level\
  \ character, it will take you longer to recharge it than if you're a higher-level\
  \ spellcaster. You also get the item bonus to healing as long as you hold the invested\
  \ staff.</p> \n    <p>Now how do you cast these spells? Well, you activate the staff\
  \ as part of casting one of the spells in it (spending 1 RP as usual). Then you\
  \ have two options: You can either expend charges from the staff equal to the spell's\
  \ level (1 charge for <i>heal</i> here) or expend one of your own spells of that\
  \ level or higher. Yeah, your staff essentially lets you spontaneously cast the\
  \ spells in it!</p> \n    <h2>Trinkets</h2> \n    <p>How about something completely\
  \ different? One thing we wanted to add was a type of item that was like scrolls\
  \ for martial characters. Spellcasters use scrolls and everyone uses potions, but\
  \ how about something special that relies on nonmagical skills? Trinkets were the\
  \ answer! Our first example was designed specifically for fighters.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Fear Gem <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item\
  \ 4</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Consumable, Enchantment, Fear, Magical,\
  \ Mental, Trinket</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 11 gp</p> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use </b>affixed, weapon;<b> Bulk</b>\
  \ —</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[F]] Focus Activation;\
  \ <b>Trigger</b> You use Intimidating Strike, but haven't rolled for the attack\
  \ yet.</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem,\
  \ if your Intimidating Strike hits, the target is frightened 2 and flat-footed against\
  \ your attacks until the end of your next turn. If the attack roll is a critical\
  \ success, the target is flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.</p> \n \
  \   </blockquote> \n    <p>Trinkets all have the consumable trait, meaning they're\
  \ used up after being activated once. They have the \"affixed\" method of use, and\
  \ as this one indicates, it has to be affixed to a weapon. You can activate it with\
  \ a Focus Activation as a free action when you use the Intimidating Strike action\
  \ from the fighter feat of the same name. This makes the Intimidating Strike more\
  \ severe, increasing its effect to frightened 2 instead of frightened 1 and making\
  \ it especially strong on a critical success.</p> \n    <p>Now how about a trinket\
  \ that's less specific?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Vanishing Coin <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item 9</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Consumable, Illusion, Magical, Trinket</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Price</b> 85 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> affixed,\
  \ armor; <b>Bulk </b>—</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[F]]\
  \ Focus Activation; <b>Trigger</b> You attempt a Stealth check for initiative, but\
  \ haven't rolled yet.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Requirements</b> You\
  \ are a master in Stealth.</p> \n     <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">This copper coin dangles from a leather strip strung through\
  \ a hole drilled into the coin's center. It's usually tied just below the throat\
  \ on a suit of armor. Until it is activated, the coin becomes invisible for a few\
  \ seconds every few minutes, but always at random intervals. When you activate the\
  \ coin, you gain the benefits of a 2nd-level <i>invisibility</i> spell until the\
  \ end of your next turn.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Anyone with master proficiency\
  \ in Stealth can use this trinket by affixing it to her armor. She can turn invisible\
  \ by activating the coin when she rolls a Stealth check for initiative. Pretty useful\
  \ in the first round of a fight!</p> \n    <p>Well, there's a lot to say about magic\
  \ items, and we'll have more to say on Friday. For now, I'm going to leave you with\
  \ a short list of some of the new items appearing in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ Rulebook</i> in addition to the classics.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><i>Anklets\
  \ of alacrity</i></li> \n     <li><i>Feather step stone</i></li> \n     <li><i>Forge\
