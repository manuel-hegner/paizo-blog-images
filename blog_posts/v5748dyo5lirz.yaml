  >I'm back with a peek at the May <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\"\
  >Class Deck</a> release, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9gdq/\"><em>Inquisitor Class\
  \ Deck</em></a>. The iconic inquisitor, Imrijka, is a bad-ass half-orc with a heart\
  \ of gold who debuted in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Base Set</em></a>. She's lethal with a bow and, as a melange of ranger and cleric,\
  \ Imrijka takes pleasure in smiting the unfaithful from a distance.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ImrijkaFront.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>She really can attack the darkness.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>As\
  \ you can see, Wrath Imrijka was about the monster vending, while Class Deck Imrijka\
  \ is all about those ranged weapons. She fuels her engine by defeating monsters,\
  \ sure, but she can also use her weapons for their powerful discard/bury effects\
  \ without losing them to the discard pile. The last power on her character card\
  \ is an adaptation of the RPG inquisitor's <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/baseClasses/inquisitor.html#judgment\"\
  >judgement class feature</a>. It's initially usable only on combat at another location.\
  \ Never has a bad first impression mattered so much.</p> \n    <p>I've chosen to\
  \ preview her Fate's Shepherd role because it features an unusual way to cheat death.\
  \ The final power allows Imrijka to drastically mitigate danger for characters whose\
  \ decks are low on cards. With feat investment, she can even make the cost to herself\
  \ minimal! Then, with the last feat on the first power, she can defeat an Undead\
  \ monster to heal that cost right back into her deck.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9gdq/\"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a> deck also has a treat for\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder Tales</a> fans: Salim Ghadafar, the protagonist\
  \ of James Sutter's <a href=\"/products/btpy8oda\"><em>Death's Heretic</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy94r3\"><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a>, makes his\
  \ PACG debut in this deck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>A mysterious weapon for a mysterious man.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Salim focuses on Finesse weapons, which are a staple of this deck. He's\
  \ a reluctant servant of Pharasma, but he will call upon her power when he really\
  \ needs it. As you can see from his sweet sword, we enjoyed playing with mechanics\
  \ for signature weapons, and this one has a potent scaling bonus. His roles, Death's\
  \ Heretic and Reluctant Priest, explore facets of his connections to swordplay and\
  \ the Lady of Graves.</p> \n    <p>The third and final character in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9gdq/\"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a> is an inquisitor of Shelyn,\
  \ the goddess of love and beauty. After tossing around ideas about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?vqwCrlMb4vno\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">game show hosts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzPCfT80u3M\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">hotness judges</a>, I eventually came around to the idea of\
  \ Sherlock Holmes for the lovelorn, and Varril was born.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Why, yes, Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch </i>were<i>\
  \ reference art for this character. Can you tell?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>He's\
  \ got the limited heals. He's got the power of Shelyn backing him up when he attempts\
  \ a check. He's even got that looking-for-love explore-again power. (In case you\
  \ can't tell, I have a bit of a thing for our boy Varril.)</p> \n    <p>His Knight\
  \ of the Rose role is all about making people feel good about themselves. He doesn't\
  \ like to be lonely, and he's eager to spread Shelyn's message when it's her turn\
  \ on the blessings deck. Note that this inquisitor has no Melee or Ranged skill;\
  \ he's a lover, not a fighter. <i>(I promised myself I wouldn't make that joke.\
  \ Oh well.)</i> His other role, Incorruptible, is about rewarding devotion to faith.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The new cards in this deck run the gamut. New weapons, new spells, new\
  \ allies, and even a new blessing. Here's a sampling.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
