  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Dave Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: The First Duel</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Several\
  \ onlookers cursed the driver as he forced the Red Carriage into their midst, but\
  \ the crowd parted. My footman opened the door, and I stepped out.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>The common folk lowered their heads. They muttered \"My lord\" with varying\
  \ degrees of resentment. Fortunately, none required the intercession of my footman,\
  \ whose slight frame and timid demeanor made him a poor substitute for my recently\
  \ deceased bodyguard.</p> \n    <p>I moved forward for a better view of the duel.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Within the crowd stood a circle of eight swordsmen, all but one pressing\
  \ kerchiefs to fresh wounds. The uninjured man appeared three decades older than\
  \ the others, a swatch of gray at either brow. The fencing master was of a height\
  \ with me, placing him a few inches above the younger men. Unlike his curious pupils,\
  \ he did not turn at my arrival. His gaze was locked upon the duelists inside the\
  \ ring.</p> \n    <p>One was a Varisian, native to the region, the other Chelaxian,\
  \ like my mother. Neither had yet seen twenty years.</p> \n    <p>A week's stubble\
  \ obscured a fresh snake tattoo wreathing the Varisian's head. Its design marked\
  \ him as Sczarni, one of his people's criminal class. He glanced at me, and the\
  \ tip of his small sword drooped. The trident dagger in his other hand wavered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>His opponent beat his blade out of line, lunged, and pricked the man's\
  \ scalp before he could retreat. The wound left a red tear beneath the serpent's\
  \ eye.</p> \n    <p>The Sczarni retreated, hissing as he restored his guard.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yield?\" The young Chelaxian smiled with such insolence that only a\
  \ craven could accept. He raised his chin, whipping his bravo's topknot like a flag.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Sczarni danced to the left, circling in the fashion of a knife-fighter.\
  \ The flashy maneuver had several weaknesses, I noted, not the least of which was\
  \ that the quick steps made him vulnerable to a sudden rush.</p> \n    <p>The Chelaxian\
  \ also saw the error.</p> \n    <p>With startling swiftness, he advanced and feinted\
  \ a lunge. Caught mid-step, the Varisian faltered, but a wild parry saved him from\
  \ the true attack. Before he could close his dagger to capture his opponent's blade,\
  \ the Chelaxian had already sidestepped to attack the Sczarni's exposed right. The\
  \ Sczarni tumbled across the cobblestones. He rolled and came up on both feet, gasping\
  \ at a wound where had rolled over his own trident dagger.</p> \n    <p>\"Is that\
  \ two for me or one touch for both of us?\" The Chelaxian laughed. \"I can never\
  \ keep track of your Sczarni rules.\"</p> \n    <p>Anger twisted the Sczarni's features.\
  \ He assumed a knifeman's stance, presenting his chest to the foe, bringing his\
  \ dagger hand forward. It was the worst possible posture for a sword duel, especially\
  \ when facing an opponent with greater reach.</p> \n    <p>The Chelaxian knew it,\
  \ but he also saw murder in the Sczarni's eyes. His mirth vanished as he assumed\
  \ the classic guard position. From that instant, the outcome was obvious even to\
  \ the untrained eye.</p> \n    <p>\"Enough,\" said the fencing master. He raised\
  \ a hand to indicate the victor.</p> \n    <p>As the Chelaxian turned to salute\
  \ his fencing master, the Sczarni began to do the same. Then the trembling of his\
  \ lips spread rage across his face. He lunged.</p> \n    <p>The Chelaxian reacted\
  \ before I could shout a warning, but his master moved first. In a single swift\
  \ motion he drew his blade and leaped. The point of his rapier pierced the Sczarni's\
  \ wrist and thrust his attack out of line. An instant later, the Chelaxian struck\
  \ the sword out of his weakened grip. Before the Sczarni could raise his trident\
  \ dagger, the master struck it from his hand and slapped his face.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Leave us,\" said the master.</p> \n    <p>\"But master—\" Tears glistened in the\
  \ Sczarni's eyes.</p> \n    <p>Before the offending student could utter his protest,\
  \ the instructor raised his left hand, palm outward, fingers to the right, hiding\
  \ the Sczarni's face from his view.</p> \n    <p>The Sczarni paled at the gesture.\
  \ Like the sign of the evil eye, it was as familiar to the Chelish citizens of Korvosa\
  \ as it was to all Varisian people. Such a banishment was as irrefutable as it was\
  \ irrevocable.</p> \n    <p>Leaving his weapons on the street, the defeated student\
  \ turned away. At first he walked with slow pride, but as his shame consumed him,\
  \ his pace quickened until he ran through the crowd, shoving aside those who moved\
  \ too slowly.</p> \n    <p>The Chelaxian student's gaze sank to the street, his\
  \ posture of triumph dissolving into an embarrassed slump. I recalculated my estimation\
  \ of his age. He had yet to fill out his adult weight, and whiskers had not yet\
  \ darkened his cheeks. While he carried himself like a man during a duel, he was\
  \ perhaps closer to fifteen than twenty. He turned toward his master, but the man\
  \ ignored him and approached me.</p> \n    <p>\"Your Excellency, I beg you to pardon\
  \ us for this disgraceful display.\" He bowed with the Korvosan flourish in vogue\
  \ when we had first met, twenty years earlier. </p> \n    <p>I returned the courtesy,\
  \ despite the disparity of our ranks. \"No fault of yours, Master Raneiro. Not all\
  \ students are worthy of their teachers.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" he agreed, with\
  \ a glance at the victorious bravo. \"This one's own father cast him out of his\
  \ fencing school. He has some talent, but he cannot still his tongue.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>The younger man had enough shame to blush, but he covered it with a deep\
  \ bow toward me. \"Your Excellency.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You quarreled with your father?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>When the young man hesitated to answer, Master Raneiro said, \"A political\
  \ disagreement.\"</p> \n    <p>Thinking of the father I had never met and the mother\
  \ I had lost far too soon, I fixed my eye upon the boy. \"You should make peace\
  \ with your father. One day your quarrels will weigh lightly against his absence.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He frowned, but before he answered, Raneiro caught his eye. Whatever\
  \ else had been upon his tongue, what he said was, \"Yes, Your Excellency.\" Despite\
  \ the bravado he showed his opponent, he knew his place before a lord of Cheliax.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For his deference, I decided to reward him with an anecdote. \"When I\
  \ first studied under Master Raneiro, there was another student who quarreled with—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>An eagle's screech scattered the crowd. The buffeting wind from\
  \ a pair of enormous wings lifted the awning of a nearby shop. A shadow passed over\
  \ us an instant before the hippogriff landed upon the nearest roof. The impact startled\
  \ a trio of imps out of the chimney. They trailed a few hectic circles of yellow\
  \ smoke before correcting course and fleeing back toward the Acadamae.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The hippogriff's wings beat to steady its talons on the slope. Dislodged tiles\
  \ slid off the eaves and shattered on the street. Despite the tumult, a practiced\
  \ rider sat easily in the winged mount's saddle. He favored me with a jaunty salute.\
  \ \"Count Jeggare!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Captain Ornelos, have you been reduced to patrolling\
  \ the streets of Korvosa?\"</p> \n    <p>Laughing, the captain guided his mount\
  \ to drop off of the roof. \"Only at the behest of Lady Seraphina,\" he laughed.\
  \ \"After the unfortunate incident with your bodyguard—what was his name? Rad— Ru—\
  ?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Rudolfo.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's it. Poor fellow just couldn't\
  \ hold his wine. Pity he chose the wrong wine house. Anyway, Lady Seraphina commanded\
  \ me to ensure your safe arrival at tonight's ceremony.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Commanded\
  \ you?\" A captain of the Sable Company answered only to his commandant, and the\
  \ commandant only to the Seneschal of Castle Korvosa. Not even Queen Domina could\
  \ interject herself into the chain of command.</p> \n    <p>\"Commands me, most\
  \ surely,\" said Ornelos. \"In the manner of all beautiful women.\"</p> \n    <p>Beside\
  \ me, where he had no right to stand, the young bravo chuckled. \"It's a truth universally\
  \ recognized that a beautiful woman commands all men.\" </p> \n    <p>Ornelos smiled\
  \ upon the man, but the interjection annoyed me. There was no sign of nobility in\
  \ the bravo's clothing. His speech was fair enough, but it could not conceal his\
  \ common origins. A man of his station had no right to intrude upon an exchange\
  \ between a captain of the Sable Company and a count of Cheliax. </p> \n    <p>To\
  \ Ornelos I replied, \"Please reassure Lady Seraphina that I have visited this district\
  \ both to pay my respects to my old fencing master and to employ a new bodyguard.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The bravo cocked his head, considering the implications. In truth,\
  \ despite my initially favorable impression of his swordplay, my hopes of finding\
  \ a suitable man had sunk since he spoke out of turn.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br>Vencarlo has the worst kind of arrogance—the kind backed up with\
  \ real skill.\n    </div> \n    <p>Reading my expression, Ornelos said, \"I could\
  \ recommend a dozen better candidates. Former Sable men, handy with a sword.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Before I could reply, the bravo spoke. \"I beg you to send them here,\"\
  \ he said. \"I have damaged all my fellows and could use fresh sport.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Ornelos scoffed. \"My men don't brawl with street ruffians.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ bravo grinned at the implied challenge, but before he could speak, Master Raneiro\
  \ stepped toward Captain Ornelos. \"Do you suggest that I train brawlers, sir?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Doubt clouded Orenlos's face as he recognized Raneiro's tone. The\
  \ fencing master was a proud man. He had trained a generation of the city's finest\
  \ duelists, albeit in the streets rather than in a school. While it might prove\
  \ instructional for all present to see him duel Captain Ornelos, such an altercation\
  \ would ultimately harm both men.</p> \n    <p>\"Master Raneiro, please disregard\
  \ my friend Fedele's unfortunate choice of words.\"</p> \n    <p>Raneiro glanced\
  \ at me, noting my own careful phrasing. He could not challenge a friend of mine\
  \ without offering offense to me. I harbored no illusion that he feared either my\
  \ station or my skill at the blade. I set my hope for peace upon our friendship.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For an airless moment, neither man spoke. Captain Fedele Ornelos shifted\
  \ atop his hippogriff, his legs uncomfortable at rest in the aerial saddle. I raised\
  \ my eyebrow to prompt him.</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, yes, of course I meant no offense\
  \ to the estimable fencing master.\" He hesitated, and for a moment I feared his\
  \ pride would outweigh his diplomacy. \"Please forgive me, Master Raneiro.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With a nod, Raneiro accepted the apology.</p> \n    <p>With the silent\
  \ invisibility of superb servants, my footman had erected a small folding table.\
  \ Upon it rested an opened bottle from one of my western estates, along with two\
  \ goblets. Anticipating my unspoken desire, the footman produced a third vessel\
  \ by the prestidigitation unique to his class. When he felt my approving eyes upon\
  \ him, he almost succeeded in concealing his hope. He knew he could not rise to\
  \ the position of butler in my household, where I employed only halflings, but he\
  \ also knew that the butlers of four noble houses had been hired upon my recommendation.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>At my nod, the footman poured the wine. It was a deep purple vintage\
  \ Raneiro favored, a blend of several grapes and, frankly, not one of my finest.\
  \ Yet he so enjoyed this particular wine that I paid the proprietors of several\
  \ Korvosan wine houses to keep it in stock for the master's exclusive consumption,\
  \ always free of charge. No matter the street or plaza on which the wandering master\
  \ found himself teaching, he would find a drink at the end of the day.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Ornelos disengaged himself from his hippogriff's saddle and joined us. I raised\
  \ my cup and uttered Korvosa's motto: \"Fidelity and strength.\"</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ we three drank the toast, the bravo lingered, eyeing the rapier at my side. He\
  \ noted the calluses on my hand and studied my posture. He recognized a fellow duelist,\
  \ and in the furrow of his brow I saw his questions.</p> \n    <p>\"I need a man\
  \ to watch my back, to mingle with the other servants and report their gossip. And,\
  \ if it comes to it, a man who can hold his own in a fight.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But\
  \ you can fight,\" said the bravo. It was not quite a question. \"Even with its\
  \ jeweled guard, that blade is no mere ornament.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Would you care\
  \ for a demonstration?\" I turned to Raneiro. \"With your permission, Master?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"By all means, Excellency.\" He stepped back, signaling his other\
  \ students to re-form the dueling circle. In seconds, the onlookers returned in\
  \ even greater numbers than before.</p> \n    <p>The bravo hesitated. \"Do I have\
  \ Your Excellency's word that I shall not be arrested for wounding you?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"We shall not fence to first blood.\" I showed my footman the sign. He\
  \ had prepared this demonstration before.</p> \n    <p>Removing my sword belt, I\
  \ drew the blade and handed the scabbard to Ornelos. </p> \n    <p>\"You can't seriously\
  \ mean to fence in the street with this...\" With a glance at Master Raneiro, Ornelos\
  \ he chose his next word with care. \"...youth.\"</p> \n    <p> \"If not to first\
  \ blood...\" The bravo trailed off as the footman handed him a goblet full to the\
  \ brim.</p> \n    <p>Accepting my own goblet from the footman, I assumed a guard\
  \ stance. \"The first to spill a drop must concede defeat. If you prevail, I shall\
  \ give you this blade. And if I triumph, you must serve as my bodyguard for the\
  \ next three days.\"</p> \n    <p>The bravo's smile widened as he found a balance\
  \ between sheltering the goblet and holding his guard. \"An excellent test. I accept!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Before we begin, tell me your name.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course,\
  \ Your Excellency.\" He cradled the goblet in two fingers as he bowed. \"Vencarlo\
  \ Orisini, at your service.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
