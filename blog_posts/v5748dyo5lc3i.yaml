  \ Play, Part V: The Quest</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, April 18, 2011</p>\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n   <p>The hardest part of organizing\
  \ and running Pathfinder Society events is selecting what adventures to offer on\
  \ a given day. A coordinator needs to have an idea of how many players will show\
  \ up, how many GMs will volunteer, what level range all participants will want and\
  \ be able to play in, and most importantly, what people have and haven't played\
  \ before. The sanctioning of Pathfinder Modules for Society credit was the first\
  \ step in adding to coordinators' arsenals of available adventures, and last week\
  \ we unveiled yet another set of material for Pathfinder Society play: Pathfinder\
  \ Society Quests.</p> \n   <p>Pathfinder Society Quests are two- to three-encounter\
  \ mini-adventures covering two subtiers designed to be run in under two hours. Whether\
  \ you need to run them when a party moves like a greased snake through a Teflon\
  \ pipe through an adventure and has a few hours to kill before the end of their\
  \ scheduled slot, after poor dice rolls result in a TPK in the first half of an\
  \ adventure, or as a short demo or delve event at a game store or convention, Pathfinder\
  \ Society Quests scratch many itches. These short missions don't include faction\
  \ missions, and provide no XP or gold, but they do come with unique item access\
  \ or specialized boons. And as if that weren't enough, they can be replayed as often\
  \ as you want, even with the same character. </p> \n   <p>The first Quest in the\
  \ line is the Tier 1â€“5 adventure \"Ambush in Absalom,\" by yours truly, which can\
  \ be found in the spring issue of <i>Kobold Quarterly</i> (available in print or\
  \ PDF <a href=\"/store/magazines/koboldQuarterly/v5748btpy8jvn\">here</a>). The\
  \ adventure's Chronicle can be found on the <i>KQ</i> #17 product page or at the\
  \ bottom of the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/resources/\">Pathfinder Society Additional\
  \ Resources page</a>. Over time, we'll release more Quests, both in other venues\
  \ and on paizo.com. Eventually, Pathfinder Society Quests released elsewhere will\
  \ make their way to paizo.com for all members to access. Stay tuned for more information\
  \ about how you can submit your own Pathfinder Quests for inclusion in this exciting\
  \ new program!</p> \n   <p>Next Monday we'll continue examining the existing five\
  \ factions and what changes might be in store for them next season with a look at\
  \ Cheliax, whose members are very vocal, but aren't so great at recruiting others\
  \ to their cause.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
