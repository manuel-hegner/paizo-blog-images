  > \n    <p>We're tying up all the final loose ends before heading to Indianapolis\
  \ for Gen Con next week, so because I'm so busy, I'm going to let my favorite freelancer\
  \ write a fun description of the creature depicted in today's blog:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>\"It was a paw, fully two feet and a half across, and equipped with\
  \ formidable talons. After it came another paw, and after that a great black-furred\
  \ arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms. Then two pink eyes\
  \ shone, and the head of the awakened gug sentry, large as a barrel, wabbled into\
  \ view. The eyes jutted two inches from each side, shaded by bony protuberances\
  \ overgrown with coarse hairs. But the head was chiefly terrible because of the\
  \ mouth. That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of\
  \ the head, opening vertically instead of horizontally.\L\"</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€”\
  H. P. Lovecraft, \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120810-Gug.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120810-Gug_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Yes, today's featured\
  \ miniature is the Gug, subterranean terror of Lovecraft's Dreamlands. This horrific\
  \ monstrosity is the centerpiece of an epic encounter in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>. That campaign kicks off this month, with the\
  \ new Shattered Star Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures set currently slated\
  \ for January.</span></p> \n    <p>That's a pretty sweet looking monster, eh? It\
  \ has cleaner teeth than Lovecraft's version, and yellower eyes, but this miniature\
  \ captures the essence of the description that inspired it, and it's sure to strike\
  \ terror into the hearts of your player characters. The quality of the sculpt and\
  \ paint job have a lot to do with that, but to me the most impressive thing about\
  \ this figure is its size.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ pushing the very limits of the Large size category. </p> \n    <p>And the blood\
  \ in his mouth is shiny.</p> \n    <p>He's great, and I can't wait to build a little\
  \ shrine in my office with like eight of this guy.</p> \n    <p>Next week we're\
  \ at Gen Con for the official release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise\
