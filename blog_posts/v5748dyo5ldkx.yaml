  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: The (Goblin) Dog Days of Summer</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, June 29, 2012</p> \n   <p>It's 2:25 PM and I still\
  \ haven't written today's Pathfinder Battles preview blog.</p> \n   <p>MUST BE SUMMER!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I love the arrival of summer here in the Pacific Northwest, which for\
  \ the other 9 months of the year likes to keep itself cloaked in a mantle of soggy\
  \ gray misery. Finally, the sun peeks over the mountains and through the otherwise\
  \ ever-present clouds, and a bit of happiness returns to the world.</p> \n   <p>Unfortunately,\
  \ I'm always too damn busy to appreciate it, because summer also means the arrival\
  \ of the most hectic season for Paizo, with prep for major conventions like Gen\
  \ Con and PAX eating up virtually every minute of the day. Right now we're working\
  \ liked geased tinker-gnomes trying to get all our tasks accomplished for PaizoCon,\
  \ which happens NEXT WEEK!</p> \n   <p>Oh. My. God. </p> \n   <p>So yeah, sorry\
  \ it's taken a few extra hours of waiting for today's Pathfinder Battles goodness.\
  \ I assure you (especially those of you coming to PaizoCon) that the wait will be\
  \ very much worth it.</p> \n   <p>Speaking of PaizoCon, I'm pleased to announce\
  \ that it's our intention to have EVERY SINGLE figure in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures set on display\
  \ at the convention store, so I encourage minis fanatics attending the show to bring\
  \ cameras, because you're going to see some stuff there you've never seen before,\
  \ even on this very blog! (The set will also be on full display at Gen Con, where\
  \ we'll actually have the product for sale in line with its August release.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Next week's blog will feature the set's final \"mystery figure,\" the\
  \ creature so challenging to sculpt and paint that it took us something like eleven\
  \ tries to get it right. Can you guess what figure that might be?</p> \n   <p>In\
  \ the meantime, here are two remaining stragglers who we haven't managed to show\
  \ off yet, mostly due to bad camera angles on our original paint master shots. Somehow,\
  \ our over-worked art team managed to snap a few better images of these shy characters\
  \ (in their final production-run incarnations, no less), and now we're ready to\
  \ reveal them to the world.</p> \n   <p>First up is the Goblin Dog, a common figure\
  \ that you'll definitely want by the handful if you're running the first chapter\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</a>\
  \ (now also available as an ultra-sweet <a href=\"/products/btpy8tg1\">Deluxe Collector's\
  \ Edition</a>). </p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120629-GoblinDog.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120629-GoblinDog_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>As you can see by this critter's gross skin and gnarly teeth,\
  \ \"Goblin Dogs\" aren't really dogs at all, but nasty rodents trained by goblins\
  \ as repulsive mounts. Goblins hate real dogs, of course, but everyone needs a best\
  \ friend, and these gross creatures fill the role admirably. </p> \n   <p>Next up\
  \ we have Viorian Dekanti, a rare villain from the final chapter of the Rise of\
  \ the Runelords Adventure Path, Greg A. Vaughan's \"Spires of Xin-Shalast\". Viorian\
  \ wields <i>Chellan</i>, one of the legendary <a href=\"/products/btpy7zke\">Seven\
  \ Swords of Sin</a>. A champion of the campaign's final \"end boss,\" Viorian is\
  \ not one to be trifled with (though her golden armor is certainly worth a pretty\
  \ penny).</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120629-Viorian.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120629-Viorian_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Of course, if you like the looks of her, Viorian can easily double\
  \ as a martial player character or any important NPC armed with a sword and wearing\
  \ fancy armor. </p> \n   <p>That's it for this week. ONLY ONE MORE MINI TO GO!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Then, I suppose it'll be time to start revealing figures from the <i>next</i>\
  \ set.... which we plan to reveal at PaizoCon!</p> \n   <p>See you there (or see\
  \ you here, in upcoming weeks)!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n\
