  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">Lem is always going to be my character in PACG.\
  \ That’s because I played him through the entirety of my first Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game journey in <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>. When we finished that up,\
  \ we followed <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhxk?Wrath-of-the-Righteous-The-LongAwaited\"\
  >Mike Selinker’s recommendation</a> for using Wrath of the Righteous as a continuation\
  \ of Rise, and so I played Lem for another three boxes of adventures! So, I’ve gotten\
  \ pretty used to fighting with a d4 and constantly emptying my hand to help my fellows.\
  \ It’s a pleasure to finally write about it!</p> \n     <p>And as usual, I suggest\
  \ reading the matching <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh5s?Core-Design-Lem\"\

  ></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> Core Set Character Lem, front and back</p>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <h3>Core Set Lem</h3> \n     <p><b>Best Skill</b>: Charisma\
  \ (d10)<br> <b>Character Type</b>: Healer, Arcane, Divine</p> \n     <p><b>Skills</b>.\
  \ What does one do with a d10 Charisma? In Lem’s case, he uses it to cast his spells,\
  \ whether they be Arcane or Divine... and it’s this access to both magic types that\
  \ makes Lem the most versatile character in the <em>Core Set</em>. Beyond that,\
  \ in a world with lots of Charisma characters, Lem’s d10+3 stands out. His Dexterity\
  \ of d8 is also notable, as it lets him use Ranged weapons, sort of, and his Acrobatics\
  \ of d8+1 is a nice fourth skill—mainly for its rarity, as it’s shared only with\
  \ Merisiel and Sajan.</p> \n     <p><em>Weaknesses</em>. Lem is really not good\
  \ at combat, and that flaw will come up more often than most any other character\
  \ weakness in the game. He gets to roll just a d4 if he gets caught weaponless,\
  \ and even if he has a missile weapon, he’s still rolling only a d8 (plus the weapon)\
  \ because he doesn’t have the Ranged skill. The answer is obviously to use combat\
  \ spells, which at least gives him a d10+1, but you’re going to want utility and\
  \ healing spells too, so you won’t have too many Attacks. Worst of all, Lem’s helper\
  \ feat doesn’t help his own combat! Overall, Lem needs to be careful to always have\
  \ a combat card in hand, and even then he’ll do better if he can avoid fighting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Cards</b>. Lem’s strength is obviously his selection of spells (4),\
  \ which he can use to fill any gaps in a party’s niches. Beyond that he’s got a\
  \ pretty average sampling of cards, other than the fact that he’s very low on both\
  \ weapons (1) and armors (0), pointing straight back to his weakness in combat.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Allies</em>: As a Diplomacy-oriented character who starts with 4\
  \ allies, Lem is well positioned to take advantage of the new Core Set baseline\
  \ of allies boosting local checks. This gives him another option for helping out\
  \ his friends as well as himself. He can feed these boons to his character power,\
  \ use them instead of his power, and when really needed, he can use both. Which\
  \ specific ally cards you’ll want for Lem will depend on your particular group makeup;\
  \ they can fill in gaps and/or enhance party strengths in equal measure.</p> \n\
  \     <p><em>Armor.</em> Though Lem doesn’t have armor at start, it’s sort of important,\
  \ because he needs to hold onto his cards to help people. Any armor that doesn’\
  t depend on proficiencies, and that can be recharged to help a little or buried\
  \ to help a lot is a great choice, with Leather Armor being an example.</p> \n \

  \     </div> \n     <p><em>Blessings</em>. Shelyn should be Lem’s god of choice,\
  \ because her blessings can boost Dexterity and Charisma. However, as a generalist,\
  \ Lem can get benefit from almost anyone, with Pharasma being a nice choice if Lem\
  \ focuses on Attack spells, and Sarenrae if he focuses on healing.</p> \n     <p><em>Items</em>.\
  \ Unfortunately, the Core Set has no cards that take advantage of Lem’s Instrument\
  \ proficiency. (There <em>are</em> a few such cards in <em>Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</em>.) There aren’t many wands either, which should be a go-to item for\
  \ his Arcane proficiency. Still, Lem can pick up Core Set items like the Wand of\
  \ Flame and the ever-popular Token of Remembrance. Because of his cycling powers,\
  \ he might also choose items that discard when played.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     <p><em>Spells</em>. Lem can use any spell in the game, so he’ll tend toward\
  \ whatever your party needs (or what they’re not using). It’s usually good for him\
  \ to have at least one healing spell, making it even easier to cycle his deck. And\
  \ since his combat is so weak, he’ll probably want an Attack spell or two. But his\
  \ bread and butter will always be utility spells. These might be generic help spells\
  \ such as Aid; they might be Attack cards designed to also help others such as Acid\
  \ Arrow; or they might be disabler spells such as Heat Metal. Aspect of the Monkey\
  \ is also a great choice (and a lot of fun) because it improves Lem’s most important\
  \ skills.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061120_CorespellAid.jpg\"\

  \ So what do you fight with when you just have one weapon slot? Obviously, something\
  \ that you’re not going to need to discard. or even recharge, and something Dexterity-based\
  \ so you can roll a d8 rather than a measly d4. Crossbows are the most likely choice.\
  \ Light Crossbow and Deathbane Light Crossbow are both good options because they\
  \ can be used without having to get rid of the card. Though the Heavy Crossbow is\
  \ tempting, if you reload it you can’t fight with it a second time in the same round,\
  \ which is a problem while you have only one weapon slot.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     </div> \n     <h3>The Power of Helping</h3> \n     <p>Lem’s main powers focus\
  \ on helping other people.</p> \n     <p><b>Help, Help, Help Your Friends</b>. Like\
  \ Valeros, Lem is a social animal. He should hang out with his fellows so he can\
  \ continually aid their non-combat tasks. The only caveat is that Lem should make\
  \ sure that the game remains fun for him: he shouldn’t empty his hand helping others—\
  he needs to make sure that he still has some cards for his own turn. (A power feat\
  \ in the Poet Laureate role can help.)</p> \n     <p><b>Close, Close, Close the\
  \ Locations</b>. Lem’s local non-combat bonus is particularly useful for closing\
  \ locations. In many games, you seem to get stuck with a location whose closing\
  \ requirement just isn’t suited to your party. Send in the most suitable character\
  \ you have, then have Lem tag along to throw in a +1d4.</p> \n     <p><b>Take +1d6\
  \ Help as Your First Power Feat</b>. Since Lem’s focus is on helping other people,\
  \ you really want to improve that ability, so taking the power feat that increases\
  \ his help to +1d6 is an obvious first choice.</p> \n     <p><b>Choose Support Spells,\
  \ Allies, and Items</b>. Because Lem will constantly be around other people, he\
  \ should pick allies, items, and spells that can help other local characters. (And\
  \ as noted before, these can even be more powerful if they’re discarded, because\
  \ Lem can get them back.)</p> \n     <p><b>Avoid, Avoid, Avoid the Combat!</b> While\
  \ he’s doing all of this helping, Lem should also do his best to avoid combat unless\
  \ he’s got his weapon and/or Attack spells in his hand. OK, that’s easier said than\
  \ done in PACG, but he can certainly work toward a combat-light strategy. To start\
  \ with, he should always explore the locations with the fewest monsters first. Meanwhile,\
  \ he should stock up on cards that can allow him to avoid monsters that are too\
  \ tough. Sleep is a nice evasion spell, but Confusion and Twisted Space are even\
  \ better because they can hand off Lem’s combat to other local characters. Down\
  \ the road, if Lem is still having problems with combat, take a look at the Busker\
  \ role, which has a power feat that allows him to give his combat bonus to others.\
  \ (Given all of this, Valeros is an obvious companion for Lem: he can give Lem bonuses\
  \ in combat and in the worst case, he can avenge Lem if the bard fails.)</p> \n\

  \ Space </p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>The Power of Cycling</h3> \n     <p>Lem is\
  \ one of the best cyclers in the <em>Core Set</em>, able to quickly and easily move\
  \ through his deck, primarily by recharging cards to give bonuses, but also by cycling\
  \ what’s in his discards.</p> \n     <p><b>Choose Your Recharges Well</b>. Think\
  \ carefully about what cards Lem recharges. They should typically be those rarely\
  \ used items that give a bonus for a specific situation. Maybe he’ll get lucky and\
  \ have a use for them while they’re in his hand, but otherwise, they can go to the\
  \ bottom of his deck, hopefully giving him something more immediately useful. But\
  \ if Lem ends up with too much of anything, he might cycle that instead, especially\
  \ if he ends up with his weapon and all of his Attack spells in his hand.</p> \n\

  \ <p><b>Busker</b>. This role simultaneously empowers Lem personally and lets him\
  \ work better in concert with others. He gets a lot better in Urban locations, adding\
  \ dice, blessing rolls, and avoiding damage. He also can pass off his banes to other\
  \ local characters, while in turn he gets to make the ally acquisition rolls they\
  \ failed. If your adventure path is Urban-focused, this is the obvious choice. </p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Poet Laureate</b>. This role also makes Lem more of a team player,\
  \ but it does so by focusing on card cycling. Lem can draw cards at the start of\
  \ his turn, bury discards for bonuses after the fact, and even heal characters by\
  \ discarding. If you particularly like Lem’s cycling powers, or if he’s always a\
  \ team player, this is the role to choose.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
