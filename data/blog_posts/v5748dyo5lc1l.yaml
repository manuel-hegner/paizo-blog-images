  \ Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Part II: Where Once There Were Five...</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 28, 2011</p> \n    <p>Since Hyrum and I\
  \ first joined the Pathfinder Society Organized Play team last fall, we've had huge\
  \ goals for what we wanted the campaign to be. Hyrum has coordinated organized play\
  \ for huge networks of people in the past while working for Upper Deck Entertainment\
  \ and had hopes of seeing Pathfinder Society reach the same number of players. Meanwhile,\
  \ I began my foray into Pathfinder Society as a player and GM and wanted to see\
  \ the concerns of the average participant addressed and the overall quality of the\
  \ campaign continue to increase, and to explore the setting I loved to a whole new\
  \ degree.</p> \n    <p>So we started plotting.</p> \n    <p>And after months of\
  \ subtle hints and minor alterations to the status quo, we're ready to start announcing\
  \ the larger changes that are on the horizon with Season 3. We started <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lc0z\">last week</a> with announcements of\
  \ the conclusion of the Year of the Shadow Lodge metaplot and the <i>First Steps</i>\
  \ intro adventure arc to be released in July. Every Monday between now and August\
  \ 8 (the day after Gen Con ends), we'll have a new Pathfinder Society-related blog\
  \ about some of the new or changing rules elements of the campaign.</p> \n    <p>First\
  \ up: Factions!</p> \n    <p>When Pathfinder Society was announced roughly three\
  \ years ago, players were promised in-world consequences for their actions within\
  \ their factions. This competitive aspect of the campaign was abandoned at the end\
  \ of Season 0, but we're bringing it back... sort of. Factions will matter more\
  \ in the overall metaplot of the season, and successes reported in certain scenarios\
  \ within a small window of time after release will influence future scenario development.\
  \ Each faction will have its own storyline over the course of the season involving\
  \ specific NPCs, locations, and events. If you want cool stuff to happen to or within\
  \ a particular faction that season, complete your missions and report the results;\
  \ if some factions have less than stellar performances, their stories may be less\
  \ positive, but players' actions will still influence what does occur.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Also, there will be ten factions next season to expand the options available\
  \ to players. The five existing factions aren't going anywhere (though those that\
  \ didn't perform as well in the last three seasons may see some shakeups) and mechanics\
  \ for existing members to change factions will be outlined. We'll be dedicating\
  \ a blog post to each of the ten factions in the coming monthsâ€”beginning in two\
  \ weeks with the most successful faction to date.</p> \n    <p>Be sure to check\
  \ back here next Monday for another big announcement about the future of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play campaign involving the official campaign rules documents.</p>\
