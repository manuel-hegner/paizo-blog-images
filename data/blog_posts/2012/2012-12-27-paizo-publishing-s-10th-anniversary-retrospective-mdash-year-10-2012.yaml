  Year 10 (2012)</h1>\n            <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n             <h2>Laying\
  \ Groundwork for the Future</h2>\n             <p class=\"date\">Thursday, December\
  \ 27, 2012</p>\n             <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><em>This blog entry\
  \ is the elventh in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</em></p>\n             <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As I\
  \ sit down to write my last retrospective blog, I find myself in a bit of a quandry.\
  \ This is about stuff that happened this year, sometimes mere weeks ago. It's not\
  \ ancient history—it's what I'm living through right now! That makes writing it\
  \ up as a restrospective a little weird. Instead of providing the perspective of\
  \ hindsight, I'm hoping that this blog will give you some insight into why we did\
  \ what we did this year, why we're doing the things we've already announced for\
  \ next year, and perhaps a little strategic thought about where Paizo will go in\
  \ the future. Plans could change radically as the future becomes the present, but\
  \ at least you can see some of what I'm thinking about right now.</span></p>\n \
  \            <p>Our first big rulebook of the year was the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"\
  ><em>Advanced Race Guide</em></a>. This book came about due to requests for us to\
  \ do something similar to the \"Savage Species\" book that Wizards of the Coast\
  \ did for Third Edition. Now, I have to let you in on a little secret: Erik has\
  \ this thing about not wanting to replicate books from D&amp;D's past. When you're\
  \ brainstorming new books to do, it's really easy to fall back on ideas like \"\
  our take on Deities &amp; Demigods\" or \"our version of the Psionics Handbook.\"\
  \ More than once, Erik has said in these brainstorm sessions, \"If, at the end of\
  \ the Pathfinder first edition run, I look back and see a bunch of reimaginings\
  \ of books that TSR and WotC did in the past, then I'm going to be very disappointed\
  \ in us.\" Erik is constantly pushing the staff to come up with innovative ideas,\
  \ no matter how nostalgic we all are for past books.</p>\n             <p>So when\
  \ it came to the <em>Advanced Race Guide</em>, we had a quandry. D&amp;D has always\
  \ had race books. It makes sense, because everybody has to play a race. But we wanted\
  \ this to be a bit different. We decided that the first third of the book would\
  \ have lots of cool stuff for the core races from the <em>Core Rulebook</em>—things\
  \ that would make you look at each race in a new light. The second half of the book\
  \ would provide you with playable classes for every zero-hit-die monster out of\
  \ the first three Bestiaries—every single one. And the last section of the book\
  \ would give you a rules system to create your own playable races out of pretty\
  \ much any monster. With all of these things done, <em>Advanced Race Guide</em>\
  \ turned into a book that I am very proud of, and that's more than just \"our version\
  \ of Savage Species.\"</p>\n             <p>For the summer hardcover, we wanted\
  \ something super crunchy for Pathfinder Society players, so we came up with <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8tmc\"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a>. Packed from cover\
  \ to cover with nearly every piece of equipment we'd printed to date, plus so much\
  \ additional material that more than half of the book is brand new, there's literally\
  \ something in here for everyone. We were even able to sneak in some of the best\
  \ wondrous items from the previous four years of <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a>.\
  \ It's lavishly illustrated with artwork drawn from the decks upon decks of <a href=\"\
  \">Item Cards</a> we've released over the years; of course, there were quite a few\
  \ pieces that haven't been in Item Card sets (yet), so there's plenty of new art\
  \ too!</p>\n             <div class=\"blurb120\">\n              <a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/PaizoCon/PaizoCon2012-9059GI.jpg\"\

  \ the printer sample of the <span class=\"blurbi\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary\
  \ Deluxe Edition</span>.\n             </div>\n             <p>In the end-of-year\
  \ spot where we've previously scheduled new bestiaries, we decided to try something\
  \ different this year. Inspired by Gary Gygax's vintage Rogues Gallery product,\
  \ we decided to come up with a big book of NPCs, which we dubbed the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>. Our goal was to help GMs who need NPCs\
  \ on the fly, providing them with a character for every <em>Core Rulebook</em> class\
  \ at all 20 levels. Add in prestige classes, NPC classes, and our iconic characters\
  \ at multiple levels, and the result is a ton of very useful characters. This is\
  \ a book that's going to get a lot of use at my table!</p>\n             <p>As this\
  \ year was both the 10th anniversary of Paizo and the 5th anniversary of Pathfinder,\
  \ we had to do something cool to commemorate it! Our first Pathfinder products ever—\
  and still among our most popular—were the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path volumes,\
  \ which were originally written for the 3.5 rules system. The original books from\
  \ that 6-volume arc are either sold out or almost sold out, so reprinting the AP\
  \ as a single collection—something we do not and will not regularly do—was a viable\
  \ option. James Jacobs combed through pages upon pages of posts in the Rise of the\
  \ Runelords forums on paizo.com, reaping the benefit of five years worth of our\
  \ customers' actual play experiences, and he spent months updating and fine-tuning\
  \ the book. Then he turned it over to me, and I spent two weeks doing a development\
  \ pass of my own. Sarah Robinson and her art team made it look super sweet, and\
  \ Wayne Reynolds provided an awesome new cover. The large hardcover has sold very\
  \ well and received lots of critical acclaim. We celebrated the release at PaizoCon\
  \ with all six of the Runelords authors present as guests of honor!</p>\n      \
  \       <p>Of course, we couldn't just stop there! We've always wanted to do a superdeluxe\
  \ game product and the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\"><em>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Anniversary Edition</em></a> gave us the excuse to pull out all the stops and\
  \ really make something special. If you haven't seen the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwwIzLxyD0\"\
  >video of Erik Mona</a> unveiling the <a href=\"/products/btpy8vre\"><em>Deluxe\
  \ Collector's Edition</em></a>, you really need to check it out! Words do not adequately\
  \ convey how cool this product ended up! (We had to make it a paizo.com exclusive\
  \ because if it went through the usual distributor and retailer markups, the price\
  \ would approach $1000!)</p>\n             <p>For our regular Adventure Paths in\
  \ 2012, we did two very different things. James Jacobs keeps a long list of potential\
  \ themes for upcoming Adventure Paths, and we delve into its depths a couple times\
  \ per year as we discuss what to do next. This time, I really wanted to return to\
  \ more of a sandbox AP, since <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\"><em>Kingmaker</em></a>\
  \ had been so popular. After looking through the ideas in James' list, we figured\
  \ that pirates looting ships, establishing a secret base, finding lost treasure\
  \ and thwarting an invasion would be the perfect backdrop for a sandbox game, and\
  \ thus was <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"><em>Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</em></a> born.</p>\n             <p>The second AP was all James' idea.\
  \ He'd been wanting to return to Varisia for a while, and the details of what would\
  \ become <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"><em>Shattered Star</em></a>\
  \ had been percolating in his brain. With the release of the <em>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Anniversary Edition</em>, the time was right to write our first \"sequel\" adventure\
  \ path. <em>Shattered Star</em> was written as if the events of the previous Varisia\
  \ APs (<em><a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a>,</em> and <em><a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\"\
  >Second Darkness</a></em>) had already happened. Of course, you don't need to have\
  \ played through those to play <em>Shattered Star</em>, but if you did, you'll find\
  \ little easter eggs throughout the text.</p>\n             <p>The Pathfinder Companion\
  \ line had a revamp this past year. When we launched the line a couple of years\
  \ ago, we wanted to provide players with a regular supplement that would not only\
  \ give them some insight into the world of Golarion, but also give them some crunchy\
  \ rules stuff that they could use with their characters. Wes Schneider and James\
  \ Sutter had taken ownership of the line, and they had some ideas on how to make\
  \ it better for players. They began by going to our messageboards and asking what\
  \ kinds of things you'd like to see in the Player Companion line—what you liked\
  \ and what you didn't like—then they rolled it into a new format and pitched it\
  \ to the admin team here at Paizo. The result arrived this year starting with <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8tim\"><em>Varisia: Birthplace of Legends</em></a>. It seems\
  \ to have been received as a change for the better, garnering many very positive\
  \ comments on the new look!</p>\n             <p>For years, we've been contemplating\
  \ Pathfinder card games and board games, and 2012 saw the beginning of the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game. In April, we were approached by an old friend of the company,\
  \ Mike Selinker, with the genesis of the idea that would become the Pathfinder ACG.\
  \ He had a mechanic that he had been working on with another company which he thought\
  \ could bring the feel of Pathfinder to a card game format. You'd have a character,\
  \ form an adventuring party, visit adventure sites, defeat monsters and villains,\
  \ and find treasure. As you explore, you'd make changes to the deck of cards representing\
  \ your character, and those adjustments would carry over to the next time you played\
  \ the game, essentially \"leveling up\" your character.</p>\n             <div class=\"\

  \ at \"Project Swallowtail\", aka the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game!\n        \
  \     </div>\n             <p>We decided that we'd base the challenges in the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game around our Adventure Paths, starting with <em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</em>. (We code-named the game \"Project Swallowtail\" after the goblin\
  \ fight in the beginning of <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>.) The first release will\
  \ be a big box of cards representing monsters, items, spells, weapons, and more,\
  \ including adventure scenarios to play through \"Burnt Offerings\", the first chapter\
  \ of <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>; we plan to release subsequent decks for the\
  \ other five volumes of the AP in a series of bimonthly releases, allowing us to\
  \ produce a full Adventure Path in card form every year! The Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game is currently in playtesting, where more than 300 players are helping\
  \ us make the game the best it can be. In the next few months, the game will be\
  \ finished, and we hope to release it at Gen Con 2013.</p>\n             <p>I've\
  \ personally been spending a lot of time working with Paizo's new sister company,\
  \ <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Goblinworks</a>, and the\
  \ Pathfinder Online MMO. At the beginning of the year, it was pretty much just Ryan\
  \ Dancey, myself, and a plan. As the year progressed, we've assembled an amazing\
  \ team and started building Pathfinder Online. Instead of putting together another\
  \ World of Warcraft \"MMO theme park\" clone, we're taking inspiration from the\
  \ <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> and are creating a sandbox in the River Kingdoms\
  \ that will allow players to seek out fame and fortune, and maybe even one day,\
  \ own part of the world! This scope allows us to make an MMO with a team and a budget\
  \ that are much smaller than those used to make most MMOs. Pathfinder Online is\
  \ a different animal—it's going to be driven by the players in a process we call\
  \ crowdforging, which is modeled to some extent on the community-driven process\
  \ we use to make new products at Paizo. The end result is going to be an MMO that\
  \ I am confident will not only break new ground, but will provide players with a\
  \ Pathfinder experience that will be one-of-a-kind!</p>\n             <p>Building\
  \ Pathfinder Online won't take the tens of millions of dollars that most theme park\
  \ MMOs require, but it is still a pricey venture. We launched a Kickstarter in May\
  \ that helped us to build a technology demo—a proof of concept that tests internal\
  \ systems and demonstrates to potential investors that you can do what you say you\
  \ can do. Our Kickstarter was a huge success, raising over $300,000 in 30 days and\
  \ allowing us to start hiring staff to make the game. In the course of three months,\
  \ a staff of fewer than 10 people put together an entire dungeon level, built a\
  \ section of wilderness, created a tower and catapults, and three of our iconic\
  \ characters, Valeros, Seoni, and Merisiel. Oh, and goblins. Lots and lots of goblins.\
  \ With the Technology Demo complete, we were able to ensure enough funding to make\
  \ Pathfinder Online possible.</p>\n             <p>A by-product of this Kickstarter\
  \ was a product called <a href=\"/products/btpy8tb0\"><em>Thornkeep</em></a>. It\
  \ started off as a simple project, with veteran designer Rich Baker creating the\
  \ town of <em>Thornkeep</em>, a chaotic hive of scum and villainy which is going\
  \ to be one of the starter towns in Pathfinder Online. He also created a small dungeon\
  \ beneath Thornkeep and populated the wilderness surrounding the town. The book\
  \ would also include a behind-the-scenes look at the building of our Tech Demo.\
  \ As the Kickstarter progressed, we added stretch goals that resulted in new dungeon\
  \ levels beneath Rich's original one. By the end of the Kickstarter, Jason Bulmahn,\
  \ James Jacobs, Erik Mona and Ed Greenwood were each supplying their own dungeon\
  \ level for the book, which had swelled to a full 96 pages! We also created <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8tbi\">Flip-Mats</a> for the latter four dungeon levels.</p>\n   \
  \          <p>The funding that we received after completing the Tech Demo will ensure\
  \ that Pathfinder Online is going to happen, but to create the game as big and as\
  \ fast as we all really want to, we need to hire about three times as many employees\
  \ as our current funding allows. Rather than seek out a venture capitalist that\
  \ cares more about profit margins and having a short-term exit strategy than about\
  \ creating an awesome game that people will play for years, we decided to enlist\
  \ the support of our community, so that we can keep making the decisions that the\
  \ community wants us to make. So we recently kicked off <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">another Kickstarter effort</a>, this time seeking the funding\
  \ we need to make the game bigger, better, and faster! As I type this, the Kickstarter\
  \ is reaching the halfway point in both time and money, which means that we're likely\
  \ to get the capital we need!</p>\n             <p>In conjunction with this Kickstarter,\
  \ we announced another Pathfinder RPG product similar to <em>Thornkeep</em>; this\
  \ one is called the <em>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em>, and it's going to be Paizo's\
  \ biggest dungeon ever. We've enlisted top Paizo staff members as well as many of\
  \ our famous designer friends to help out. As of right now, we have dungeon levels\
  \ coming from Rich Baker, Wolfgang Baur, Wes Schneider, James Sutter, Keith Baker,\
  \ Ed Greenwood, Erik Mona, Mark Rein•Hagen, Jason Bulmahn, Frank Mentzer, James\
  \ Jacobs and myself! And if we surpass our funding goal—which is very possible,\
  \ as Kickstarters usually have a big surge in the last few days—more and more dungeon\
  \ levels from other amazing designers will be added. This baby could get crazy.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Of course, the Kickstarter rewards include some cool things for\
  \ the Pathfinder Online game itself, including giving away a new in-game item every\
  \ day. At the higher reward levels, you can own a tavern in the game, name a spell\
  \ or magic item after your character, or even have your character drawn by Wayne\
  \ Reynolds and turned into a prepainted plastic Pathfinder Battles miniature for\
  \ a future set! And there are more and more things coming down the turnpike. By\
  \ the time this Kickstarter is done, we'll be offering one of the sweetest deals\
  \ in gaming history! And most importantly, it will help us to make sure Pathfinder\
  \ Online is done right, with input from the most important people: you!</p>\n  \
  \           <p>2012 has also been a banner year for Paizo's licensing efforts. Our\
  \ friends at <a href=\"http://www.reapermini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Reaper</a>\
  \ continued to release two or more new unpainted metal miniatures each month; we\
  \ now have a very impressive array of over 160 different miniatures to choose from.\
  \ And Reaper's extremely successful Kickstarter for their Bones line of unpainted\
  \ plastic miniatures managed to add several miniatures from the Pathfinder line\
  \ into the Bones line, which means that in 2013, there are going to be some very\
  \ affordable Pathfinder minis coming in the Bones line!</p>\n             <p>In\
  \ last month's retrospective, I talked about how our partnership with WizKids, to\
  \ make <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures, came about. Well, 2012 saw the release of the first\
  \ two full sets of miniatures in the line. One thing that most people don't know\
  \ is that WizKids was planning to enter the fantasy prepainted plastic miniatures\
  \ market on their own when talks with us started. They had a number of miniatures\
  \ in various stages of completion that we adopted—and in many cases, greatly modified—\
  and that helped us get <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>\
  \ out as quickly as we did. For the second set, based on <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a>, we were able to work with WizKids from start to finish,\
  \ creating one of the most breathtaking sets of prepainted plastic miniatures ever!\
  \ Our third set of minis, based on the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered\
  \ Star</a>, is set to release in January, and there's a <em>lot</em> more on the\
  \ way for 2013.</p>\n             <p>Our friends at Lone Wolf have been doing a\
  \ great job making <a href=\"http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Hero Lab</a> the go-to program for creating Pathfinder characters.\
  \ They make a great effort to get new rules elements into the program at superhuman\
  \ speeds. We've seen more and more of our customers using Hero Lab to make character\
  \ creation a breeze, and their release of a Mac version this year was very welcome.\
  \ We also saw two new Pathfinder dice sets from Q-workshop with the release of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8sry\"><em>Carrion Crown</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8u2i\"\
  ><em>Serpent's Skull</em></a> sets. Our friends at Diamond Select Toys created the\
  \ much-requested <a href=\"/products/btpy8t2m\">Pathfinder Goblin plush</a>, which\
  \ has been selling off the hooks since its introduction at Gen Con this year! Also\
  \ at Gen Con, we announced a deal with <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Steve Jackson Games</a> to create a Pathfinder version of Munchkin for\
  \ release in 2013. Drawn by John Kovalic and designed by Steve Jackson himself,\
  \ this promises to be a hilarious look at the Pathfinder game!</p>\n           \
  \  <p>On the language translation front, we already have strong licensees for French\
  \ (Black Book Editions), German (Ulisses Spiele) and Italian (Giochi Uniti). We\
  \ also have a few other languages in the works, including Spanish and Portuguese,\
  \ that will likely be announced in 2013. These translation partners around the world,\
  \ coupled with the ceaseless work done by our international Pathfinder Society Venture\
  \ Captains and Lieutenants, have helped Pathfinder find a strong international audience.\
  \ Pathfinder is now a global brand, and we are looking forward to continuing our\
  \ expansion!</p>\n             <p>The last big licensing news of 2012 was line of\
  \ <a href=\"/store/comics/pathfinderComics\">Pathfinder comics</a> from Dynamite\
  \ Comics. We'd always wanted to do comic books, but we needed a great partner. When\
  \ Dynamite approached Erik with an offer to chronicle the adventures of our iconic\
  \ heroes, it didn't take too long to say yes! The first issue was released at Gen\
  \ Con with a convention-exclusive cover. Author Jim Zub really captures the essence\
  \ of our iconics and is helping us to fill in their backstories. James Jacobs is\
  \ writing small Golarion-specific background articles in each issue, giving these\
  \ comics a shelf life beyond your first read-through. We're halfway through the\
  \ first six-issue story arc, and they're already working on the story that will\
  \ begin in issue 7. I can't wait to see where Jim and the team at Dynamite take\
  \ these comics next!</p>\n             <center>\n              <table>\n       \

  \             </ul>\n             <p>At the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le3w\"\
  >end of the 2011 blog</a>, I mentioned the impending announcement of 5th edition\
  \ that had us wondering what Wizards had up their sleeve, and what it would mean\
  \ for Paizo and Pathfinder. Wizards made their announcement in January, and released\
  \ the first playtest materials in May. At Gen Con, Wizards announced that 2014 was\
  \ a likely release date for their new edition.</p>\n             <p>So what does\
  \ this mean for Paizo? We've decided to stay the course. Pathfinder is doing amazingly\
  \ well, with our products selling better and better each year, and our licensing\
  \ partners are helping us make it the top RPG worldwide. We have a lot more that\
  \ we want to explore with Pathfinder and we know that we have devoted fans and customers\
  \ like you that want to go exploring with us. Paizo is good at making tabletop RPG\
  \ products and we aren't deviating from that. We wish Wizards well with their edition\
  \ launch; we will be creating cool Pathfinder adventures, expanding our Pathfinder\
  \ campaign setting, and exploring new Pathfinder RPG rules while they do that. We\
  \ will keep making Pathfinder until you tell us to stop.</p>\n             <p>We\
  \ have already announced two rulebooks for 2013 that have me excited. The first,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"><em>Ultimate Campaign</em></a>, is one that I have\
  \ been pushing for for years. It's the book that gives you rules for everything\
  \ you do OUTSIDE of the adventuring in your campaign. It will have a robust character\
  \ background generation system, \"downtime\" rules that help you keep track of what\
  \ your characters are doing between adventures, an expansion of the kingdom-building\
  \ system from <em>Kingmaker</em>, and much, much more! This is a rulebook that I've\
  \ wanted since I first started gaming in 1981, and I'm thrilled that I'm finally\
  \ going to get it!</p>\n             <p>The other book that has me jazzed is <em>Mythic\
  \ Adventures</em>. One of the earliest RPG products I had a hand in was The Primal\
  \ Order, the very first book from Wizards of the Coast, which presented a model\
  \ for divine influence in fantasy settings. Now Paizo's own Jason Bulmahn has crafted\
  \ his own system for divinity-touched characters that I think is really elegant.\
  \ You can have your high-level characters work their way towards godhood, or you\
  \ can introduce the rules earlier in a campaign to simulate a mythic hero like Hercules.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8voq\">We've been playtesting this product</a> for about\
  \ a month now, and the feedback has been great! Wayne Reynolds' cover for the book\
  \ just showed up in house, and it is epic—or rather, mythic!</p>\n             <p>We're\
  \ also planning a big change in our Pathfinder Module line for 2013. Pathfinder\
  \ Modules—then under the name GameMastery Modules—were among Paizo's first RPG products\
  \ to come out after the announcement of the cancellation of the magazines. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7yqz\"><em>Crown of the Kobold King</em></a> kicked them off and since\
  \ then, 62 modules have been published. At 32 pages, these adventures were great\
  \ for short campaigns, or to insert into adventure paths. But in recent years, they\
  \ seemed to get lost in the shuffle, so we've decided to make these adventures into\
  \ individual events, starting by making them larger and packaging them with a poster\
  \ map. The first, <a href=\"/products/btpy8vsw\"><em>The Dragon's Demand</em></a>,\
  \ is a 64-page module by Mike Shel, due out in May. Expect us to push the boundaries\
  \ a bit with these modules and make each one of them something that everyone is\
  \ looking forward to!</p>\n             <p>One more change that you will see in\
  \ 2013 is the retirement of the GameMastery brand. GameMastery predates every other\
  \ Paizo RPG product, appearing on our first non-D&amp;D product, <a href=\"/products/btpy7ux6\"\
  ><em>Dark Elf Sanctum</em></a>. Since those early <a href=\"/gameMastery/compleatEncounters\"\
  >Compleat Encounters</a>, the GameMastery brand has adorned Flip-Mats, Map Packs,\
  \ Item Cards, the Combat Pad, and a host of other gaming accessories. But we've\
  \ decided that we should really brand them with the #1 RPG brand in the world, Pathfinder,\
  \ since most of our customers are going to use them with our game. The name Pathfinder\
  \ has much more cachet with retailers, so this should help us get our accessories\
  \ into more stores. In preparation for this change, we decided to buy all of the\
  \ rights to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8bkr\">Combat Pad</a> and the Flip-Mat brand,\
  \ which were previously produced under license from our friends at Open Mind Games\
  \ and Steel Sqwire respectively. New Pathfinder-branded versions of these products\
  \ will be hitting stores in 2013.</p>\n             <p>There's another major effort\
  \ that has seen a lot of work in 2012, but that most people won't see until 2013:\
  \ Paizo Game Space. For years, I've wanted to provide you with a means to play games\
  \ with each other through paizo.com. There are a number of great virtual tabletops\
  \ (VTTs) out there, but most of them require you to run a program on your computer.\
  \ We wanted you to be able to play through your browser, anywhere and anytime. Earlier\
  \ this year, Gary Teter finally had the time to focus on Game Space, and we <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldn1\">announced it at PaizoCon</a>. Since then, his team has\
  \ been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work to get it ready for launch. We had\
  \ hoped to release it in the later part of 2012, but it wasn't ready, and I don't\
  \ like to release products before they are ready, even if that makes them late.\
  \ Gary and his team are currently doing small-scale testing with outside participants,\
  \ and all indicators are that this will open up to everyone early in 2013. We have\
  \ big plans for Game Space, but like most things in the future, it will take time\
  \ for those plans to be revealed. We are going to launch with a simple VTT and iteratively\
  \ work on it in conjunction with you, our fans, to give you more options and a better\
  \ and better experience over time. Just as the paizo.com website has evolved over\
  \ time, Game Space will do the same. I can't wait to fire up my first game on it,\
  \ or use it with a big monitor in my home game.</p>\n             <div class=\"\

  \ Kenway!\n             </div>\n             <p>I have mentioned in the past that\
  \ Paizo is a lot like an extended family. We had our first intracompany marriage\
  \ a few years back when Gary Teter married Sara Marie Rip. Earlier this year, they\
  \ had what I like to think of as the first Paizo baby. Former employees Lisa Chido,\
  \ Stacey Fiorito, Theresa Cummins, Josh Frost, and James Davis all had babies while\
  \ they were employed at Paizo, but Mikey Teter is the first child of two Paizo parents.\
  \ We all take great pride in Mikey. We also had our second intracompany marriage\
  \ this year; longtime partners Crystal Frasier and Lissa Guillet were among the\
  \ first in the state to be married after Washington voted to allow same-sex couples\
  \ to wed. And Paizo's extended family grew by one just a few days ago when warehouse\
  \ worker Mike Kenway and his wife brought Morgan Nicole Kenway into the world. We\
  \ look forward to meeting her!</p>\n             <p>One other very cool thing happened\
  \ at the end of 2012 that for me encompasses the adventure we have been on here\
  \ at Paizo. In 2004, I had to lay off a number of employees to save a struggling\
  \ Paizo, and one of the casualties was Jenny Bendel, our Director of Marketing.\
  \ Jenny wasn't let go because of performance; she was amazing, but Paizo didn't\
  \ have any money to spend on marketing. And if we didn't have money for marketing,\
  \ we didn't have money for a Director of Marketing. So I had to lay Jenny off in\
  \ a tearful meeting. She went on to do amazing things for computer game companies.\
  \ We reconnected last year on Facebook, and when I saw that she was looking for\
  \ a job earlier this year, I saw a way to correct an ancient wrong. I am really\
  \ happy to say that Jenny rejoined Paizo a few months ago, and is already making\
  \ a huge difference in our company. It gives me great pride that a friend whom I\
  \ had to lay off can work with me again in a company that is growing and thriving.\
  \ In many ways, the story of Jenny Bendel is the story of the old Paizo and the\
  \ new Paizo. And that is very, very cool.</p>\n             <p>So where will Paizo\
  \ go as we look into the next 10 years of our existence? We have a lot of cool things\
  \ to do with Pathfinder, and I'm excited to see them come to fruition. There will\
  \ be more licenses with companies that will allow us to expand the Pathfinder brand\
  \ into different media—some are already in the works! I expect Pathfinder Society\
  \ to grow even larger and better, becoming one of the main ways that Pathfinder\
  \ fans can find and play with each other. Initiatives like Paizo Game Space will\
  \ launch and continually improve, providing players with a new way to connect with\
  \ their fellow gamers and play the game they love. And I expect that there will\
  \ be more weddings and more babies. There will be triumphs and defeats. There will\
  \ be life. And we will be living it together, with a sense of adventure and determination.\
  \ I hope you will be there to live it with us. Here's to another ten years! I look\
  \ forward to telling you the tales in 2022 as I write the blogs for Paizo's 20th\
  \ anniversary. Thank you for indulging me in this trip down memory lane, and most\
  \ of all, thanks for supporting Paizo and allowing us to do what we do!</p>\n  \

  \ through <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> magazines. I was just buying them\
  \ off the rack, and after a while I figured it was time to get a subscription, so\
  \ I headed over to the website and set that up. Shortly after I renewed for the\
  \ next year, I heard the dreaded news that the magazines were going away. It was\
  \ a particularly painful thing to read considering that very day I was ready to\
  \ send in my very first pitch for an article.</p>\n             <p>Well, there went\
  \ that idea—time to look elsewhere to pitch and keep trying to break into the freelance\
  \ gig. I knew that being an unknown in this competitive world of freelance game\
  \ writing there wasn't a place for me in Paizo's new endeavors, but maybe if I reached\
  \ out to other game companies and built up a list of credits, hopefully good credits,\
  \ I could get my chance. I transferred my leftover subscription credit to check\
  \ out Pathfinder, knowing it would be great stuff. If I liked what that group was\

  \ two without an assignment. It wasn't too long after that that Liz Courts reached\
  \ out to a few of us with a task Wes asked her if we could help with. The task was\
  \ to reformat all the spells and magic items from the SRD to the new format that\
  \ was going to be used for Pathfinder Beta. I jumped at the chance, did my part\
  \ of the work, and turned my section in well before deadline. Wes's response was,\
  \ \"You're a rockstar! What can I get you working on now?\" I was elated. I let\
  \ him know that I liked monsters and worldbuilding, and from that point on I was\
  \ almost constantly writing for Paizo and for Pathfinder.</p>\n             <p>A\
  \ little later down the line, I saw that Paizo was hiring, so I sent my resume.\
  \ I didn't get the job then—the opening was filled by the ever-awesome Rob McCreary—\
  but I was touched that Wes called me at home to let me know that they were going\
  \ with Rob. That meant a lot. Despite being bummed that I didn't get the gig, it\
  \ reaffirmed the awesomeness of the company, and of Wes. So, I kept writing, kept\
  \ going to conventions and hanging out with the crew, and kept my eye on one day\
  \ sitting here writing a blog about how I got started working for Paizo. (Whoa,\
  \ that got a little meta.)</p>\n             <p>There was one other time that Wes\
  \ called me to see if I was interested in a job, but the timing wasn't right to\
  \ uproot myself from Texas and move halfway across the country. I hated to say no,\
  \ but it was the right decision at the time. However, as time went on, I realized\
  \ I should have taken the job. My day job, while it paid well, didn't really have\
  \ much of a chance of giving me what I needed other than a big paycheck. I'd go\
  \ to work, set up networks, cable offices, then come home and write all night before\
  \ sleeping for a few hours and doing it all over again. So, when a little less than\
  \ a year ago, Wes called me asking if now was a good time, I had no other response\
  \ than, \"Yeah. Now is a good time.\" I spent a few weeks tying up loose ends and\
  \ packing my life into a truck before driving across the country to my new apartment\
  \ (that I had never seen).</p>\n             <p>It was great getting here and having\
  \ Wes, Sutter, Patrick, and Mark slip out of work to help me and my wife unload\
  \ the moving truck. That showed great character for the company and the people I\
  \ had regarded as friends even before working here.</p>\n             <p>The best\
  \ thing about being part of the staff (instead of just a contributing freelancer)\
  \ is that I already felt like part of the family. When I got here, other people\
  \ kept asking me things assuming I had been here for much longer than I actually\
  \ had. I was getting questions like, \"This isn't your first PaizoCon with us, is\
  \ it?\" or \"Were you at the last company party?\" So it was good to know that the\
  \ fact that I was finally here felt as normal to the rest of the crew as it did\
  \ for me.</p>\n             <p>Adam Daigle<br><em>Developer</em></p>\n         \
  \    <h2>From Playing to Making Pathfinder</h2>\n             <p>RPGs are something\
  \ I should have gotten into early: throw collective storytelling, world-building,\
  \ social gaming, miniatures and systems for doing all this into a beaker together\
  \ and stir, and you've tailor-made a drug guaranteed to hook me immediately.</p>\n\
  \             <p>But for some reason, I didn't try it for most of my life. It wasn't\
  \ until I moved out to Seattle and was working in the game industry that my boyfriend\
  \ floated the idea of his returning to the Pathfinder campaign that our friends\
  \ Lisa and Vic hosted, and he mentioned that they'd invited me, too. Flattered that\
  \ this group of industry veterans was willing to let a newbie join them, I said\
  \ yes.</p>\n             <p>My first act in the game was to offer to pay off a bunch\
  \ of thugs who attacked us in an alley so we wouldn't have to fight them. A few\
  \ of my fellow players were horrified (\"Do you understand how much gold that is?\"\
  \ one of them asked incredulously. \"You just paid for their retirement, a new wardrobe\
  \ for each of their wives, their children's college educations\"). Four years later,\
  \ I like to think I've gotten a bit more savvy, but I'm still learning from them.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Meanwhile, however, I fell in love with Golarion. I also came to\
  \ admire Paizo, a company, I felt, that was doing it right: forming a mutually beneficial\
  \ and respectful relationship with their player base, building a well-thought-out\
  \ game world, treating their employees well, portraying a diverse and balanced slate\
  \ of characters, and having fun doing it.</p>\n             <p>There came a point\
  \ when I was ready to leave Microsoft and Paizo needed a project manager, so I came\
  \ on board. During my first few days here, as I geeked out over favorite books and\
  \ movies with my new coworkers, I felt like I'd come home. I'm now GMing my own\
  \ Pathfinder game, and playing in a campaign with another first-time GM, and am\
  \ grateful on a near-daily basis that my coworkers are kind enough to answer my\
  \ questions and help me pretend I know what I'm doing. The most uneventful day here\
  \ is still better than the best days at most of my other jobs. It's amazing how\
  \ the most Sisyphean task seems possible when you're surrounded by brilliantly talented\
  \ and genuinely good people. I'm thrilled to be in a position to contribute to my\
  \ favorite RPG, and can't wait to see what we do with the next ten years.</p>\n\
