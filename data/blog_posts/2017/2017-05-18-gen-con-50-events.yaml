              <p class="date">Wednesday, May 17, 2017</p>
              <div itemprop="articlebody">
               <p itemprop="description">Last week, I previewed some of the offerings in store for <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon 2017</a> attendees. The lottery ran and we are in the open event selection period until next Monday. If you have May 26-29 free and want to travel to beautiful Seattle, you can still pick up a badge in-person at the PaizoCon Convention store.</p>
               <p>While most of our focus is on PaizoCon, the Gen Con catalog of events went live on their website last Sunday. Attendees may browse the offerings and compile wish lists in preparation for ticket sales starting May 28. With so many games and events, I wanted to highlight some of the key Paizo offerings.</p>
               <h2>Starfinder Society</h2>
               <p><a href="/starfinder">Starfinder</a> is the buzzword for Gen Con, and the Sagamore Ballroom will buzz with sounds of the future all weekend. Events kick off with the <em>Starfinder Quest: Into the Unknown</em>. While we are running free quests throughout the convention, both in the Exhibition Hall and the Sagamore Ballroom, participation entails waiting in line, playing one of the six offerings, then returning to the line. During the first two slots of the convention, Thursday 8:00 AM-1:00 PM and 2:00 PM-7:00 PM, we offer a ticket version of the Quests, which eliminates the waiting in line and gives attendees the chance to finish the entire quest series in one sitting. These quests utilize 1st level pregenerated characters available onsite.</p>
               <p>Thursday evening is the premier of the <em>Starfinder Society Special #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em>. This event uses 4th level versions of the Starfinder iconic characters, which James Sutter and the Starfinder team is currently previewing Friday's on this blog. The in-world Starfinder Society needs firepower to complete a mission and turn to the iconics to provide assistance. After Thursday evening's launch, the Gen Con schedule includes tables of this event most slots.</p>
               <p>The schedule is set up so that an attendee may play Starfinder all Thursday with pregenerated characters, pick up a copy of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> from the Paizo booth in the Exhibition Hall, then make their own character and return Friday ready to play Starfinder Society Scenarios <em>#1-01: The Commencement, #1-02: Fugitive on the Red Planet</em>, and <em>#1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em>. Of these offerings, #1-01 is a replayable scenario and #1-02 and #1-03 are for 1st to 4th level characters. Product pages are not yet available on paizo.com, but will be posted soon.</p>
               <h2>Pathfinder Society</h2>
               <p>If Starfinder isn't your focus, there are plenty of Pathfinder Society offerings. Starting with <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em>, we offer every subsequent Season 8 scenario, including one table most sessions of <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em> a scenario for level 12-15 characters. We also have a few older scenarios, such as <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #01: Silent Tide</em> and <em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></p>
               <p>Friday night is the debut of the Season 9 multi-table interactive special, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em>. This event takes over the Sagamore, with 160 tables of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and 20 tables of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild playing the same scenario simultaneously. The Gen Con event system lists tickets for this event by sub-tier, so there are five different roleplaying event entries for the same event. We will monitor ticket sales and adjust the number of tables in each sub-tier as necessary, but at the event players will be required to play a character in the sub-tier for which they hold a ticket. As a note, 9th level is not listed for sale. This is the gap level and players of 9th level characters may purchase tickets for tier 7-8 or tier 10-11. We will have copies of the pregenerated iconic characters available for player use. The pregenerated characters only go to level 7, so there are no iconic pregenerated characters available for subtier 10-11. The Season 9 scenario offerings start Saturday morning at 8:00 AM. As with prior years, the first three scenarios of the season are on offer. We round out our special event offerings with the new multi-table modular special, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99: The Solstice Scar</em>, scheduled for Saturday evening from 8:00 PM-1:00 AM.</p>
               <p>The Adventure Card Guild has a full stock of events spanning all seasons of organized play, including Season of the Shackles, Season of the Righteous, and Season of the Runelords, Season of Plundered Tombs. We are putting final touches on the next season and hope to announce more information soon. As well as seasonal play and participating in the aforementioned <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em>, Gen Con sees a return of the Open Tournament. Starting Thursday with qualifying rounds, the tournament event spans the entire convention, with finals on Sunday at noon. Gather your teammates and come reign victorious!</p>
               <p>Pathfinder Society Academy is back this year, bigger and better than ever. Aimed at providing youth ages 6-17 a positive gaming experience, we set aside space specifically for them and their families. Programming includes the three modules of lessons: Beginner, Advanced, and Transitions, which introduce the game from the ground up and prepare the players for running characters in the Pathfinder Society, as well as Pathfinder Society Scenarios selected from prior season's catalogs. Adults are welcome at Pathfinder Society Academy tables as long as they accompany a youth. For their safety and enjoyment, children ages 6-12 must have a parent who remains at the Pathfinder Society Academy area. Youth ages 13-15 must have a parent in the Sagamore Ballroom and youth aged 16-17 need a way to contact a parent onsite in case of emergency.</p>
               <p>If playing games doesn't pique your interest, consider attending one of the Paizo panels. The first seminar starts Thursday at 11:00 AM and run through Sunday at noon. Topics include returning favorites like Ask the Paizo GMs, Writing for Paizo, Pathfinder Rules Q&amp;A, and Aunty Lisa's Story Hour. New offerings this year include Making your First Starfinder Character, Starfinder Rules Design Workshop, Secrets of the Pact Worlds, and Starfinder Adventure Path Q&amp;A. Come learn all the secrets of your favorite games!</p>
               <p>Whew! I knew we offered quite a few activities at Gen Con, but it wasn't until I was trying to select which to highlight in this blog that I realized how great programming is available. I couldn't touch on everything, so I urge you to check out <a href="https://www.gencon.com/event_finder" target="_blank">the Gen Con catalog</a> and search keyword Paizo.</p>
               <p>Over the past couple of weeks, we had some changes in Sagamore Ballroom leadership. Jon Cary, a stalwart presence for many years, stepped back from the role and Bob Jonquet is spearheading efforts. We added Walter Sheppard to the team to make up for Jon's departure. Rounding out the executive team is Lucas Servideo and Todd Morgan. Thank you to Jon for his many years spent planning and executing Pathfinder Society events at Gen Con. Enjoy seeing the show this year!</p>
               <p>For those whose travel plans are undecided, we still need GM assistance, including a handful of Tier 1 positions. The team and I spent the past weeks contacting those that already signed up and are working on scheduling those individuals for events. You should have schedule information before ticket sales go live on the 28th. Watch your inbox for correspondence. If you are interested in GMing at the event, complete the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/nChfPO5oTNesZf422" target="_blank">questionnaire</a> and we will be in contact shortly.</p>
               <p>Also for GMs, Origins Game Fair is also still looking for individuals to fill some slots at the convention held June 14 to 19 in Columbus, Ohio. Interested volunteers should sign up by sending Venture-Captain Michael McNerney an email at ohiopfs@gmail.com.</p>
               <p>I look forward to seeing many of you at PaizoCon in just over a week. If you're attending, please stop by the Grand Ballroom and say hi! Just remember, there are few strangers in gaming, but many friends you haven't met yet!</p>
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>
