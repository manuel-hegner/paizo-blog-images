  \ 10th Anniversary Retrospective—Year 10 (2012)</h1> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <h2>Laying Groundwork for the Future</h2> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ December 27, 2012</p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><i>This blog entry\
  \ is the elventh in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</i></p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As I sit down\
  \ to write my last retrospective blog, I find myself in a bit of a quandry. This\
  \ is about stuff that happened this year, sometimes mere weeks ago. It's not ancient\
  \ history—it's what I'm living through right now! That makes writing it up as a\
  \ restrospective a little weird. Instead of providing the perspective of hindsight,\
  \ I'm hoping that this blog will give you some insight into why we did what we did\
  \ this year, why we're doing the things we've already announced for next year, and\
  \ perhaps a little strategic thought about where Paizo will go in the future. Plans\
  \ could change radically as the future becomes the present, but at least you can\
  \ see some of what I'm thinking about right now.</span></p> \n    <p>Our first big\
  \ rulebook of the year was the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a>.\
  \ This book came about due to requests for us to do something similar to the \"\
  Savage Species\" book that Wizards of the Coast did for Third Edition. Now, I have\
  \ to let you in on a little secret: Erik has this thing about not wanting to replicate\
  \ books from D&amp;D's past. When you're brainstorming new books to do, it's really\
  \ easy to fall back on ideas like \"our take on Deities &amp; Demigods\" or \"our\
  \ version of the Psionics Handbook.\" More than once, Erik has said in these brainstorm\
  \ sessions, \"If, at the end of the Pathfinder first edition run, I look back and\
  \ see a bunch of reimaginings of books that TSR and WotC did in the past, then I'm\
  \ going to be very disappointed in us.\" Erik is constantly pushing the staff to\
  \ come up with innovative ideas, no matter how nostalgic we all are for past books.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So when it came to the <i>Advanced Race Guide</i>, we had a quandry.\
  \ D&amp;D has always had race books. It makes sense, because everybody has to play\
  \ a race. But we wanted this to be a bit different. We decided that the first third\
  \ of the book would have lots of cool stuff for the core races from the <i>Core\
  \ Rulebook</i>—things that would make you look at each race in a new light. The\
  \ second half of the book would provide you with playable classes for every zero-hit-die\
  \ monster out of the first three Bestiaries—every single one. And the last section\
  \ of the book would give you a rules system to create your own playable races out\
  \ of pretty much any monster. With all of these things done, <i>Advanced Race Guide</i>\
  \ turned into a book that I am very proud of, and that's more than just \"our version\
  \ of Savage Species.\"</p> \n    <p>For the summer hardcover, we wanted something\
  \ super crunchy for Pathfinder Society players, so we came up with <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a>. Packed from cover to cover with nearly every piece\
  \ of equipment we'd printed to date, plus so much additional material that more\
  \ than half of the book is brand new, there's literally something in here for everyone.\
  \ We were even able to sneak in some of the best wondrous items from the previous\
  \ four years of <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a>. It's lavishly illustrated\
  \ with artwork drawn from the decks upon decks of <a href=\"\">Item Cards</a> we've\
  \ released over the years; of course, there were quite a few pieces that haven't\
  \ been in Item Card sets (yet), so there's plenty of new art too!</p> \n    <div\

  blurbi\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Deluxe Edition</span>.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>In the end-of-year spot where we've previously scheduled new bestiaries,\
  \ we decided to try something different this year. Inspired by Gary Gygax's vintage\
  \ Rogues Gallery product, we decided to come up with a big book of NPCs, which we\
  \ dubbed the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><i>NPC Codex</i></a>. Our goal was to\
  \ help GMs who need NPCs on the fly, providing them with a character for every <i>Core\
  \ Rulebook</i> class at all 20 levels. Add in prestige classes, NPC classes, and\
  \ our iconic characters at multiple levels, and the result is a ton of very useful\
  \ characters. This is a book that's going to get a lot of use at my table!</p> \n\
  \    <p>As this year was both the 10th anniversary of Paizo and the 5th anniversary\
  \ of Pathfinder, we had to do something cool to commemorate it! Our first Pathfinder\
  \ products ever—and still among our most popular—were the Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path volumes, which were originally written for the 3.5 rules system.\
  \ The original books from that 6-volume arc are either sold out or almost sold out,\
  \ so reprinting the AP as a single collection—something we do not and will not regularly\
  \ do—was a viable option. James Jacobs combed through pages upon pages of posts\
  \ in the Rise of the Runelords forums on paizo.com, reaping the benefit of five\
  \ years worth of our customers' actual play experiences, and he spent months updating\
  \ and fine-tuning the book. Then he turned it over to me, and I spent two weeks\
  \ doing a development pass of my own. Sarah Robinson and her art team made it look\
  \ super sweet, and Wayne Reynolds provided an awesome new cover. The large hardcover\
  \ has sold very well and received lots of critical acclaim. We celebrated the release\
  \ at PaizoCon with all six of the Runelords authors present as guests of honor!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, we couldn't just stop there! We've always wanted to do a superdeluxe\
  \ game product and the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0\"><i>Rise of the Runelords Anniversary\
  \ Edition</i></a> gave us the excuse to pull out all the stops and really make something\
  \ special. If you haven't seen the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwwIzLxyD0\"\
  >video of Erik Mona</a> unveiling the <a href=\"/products/btpy8vre\"><i>Deluxe Collector's\
  \ Edition</i></a>, you really need to check it out! Words do not adequately convey\
  \ how cool this product ended up! (We had to make it a paizo.com exclusive because\
  \ if it went through the usual distributor and retailer markups, the price would\
  \ approach $1000!)</p> \n    <p>For our regular Adventure Paths in 2012, we did\
  \ two very different things. James Jacobs keeps a long list of potential themes\
  \ for upcoming Adventure Paths, and we delve into its depths a couple times per\
  \ year as we discuss what to do next. This time, I really wanted to return to more\
  \ of a sandbox AP, since <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\"><i>Kingmaker</i></a>\
  \ had been so popular. After looking through the ideas in James' list, we figured\
  \ that pirates looting ships, establishing a secret base, finding lost treasure\
  \ and thwarting an invasion would be the perfect backdrop for a sandbox game, and\
  \ thus was <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"><i>Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</i></a> born.</p> \n    <p>The second AP was all James' idea. He'd been\
  \ wanting to return to Varisia for a while, and the details of what would become\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"><i>Shattered Star</i></a>\
  \ had been percolating in his brain. With the release of the <i>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Anniversary Edition</i>, the time was right to write our first \"sequel\" adventure\
  \ path. <i>Shattered Star</i> was written as if the events of the previous Varisia\
  \ APs (<i><a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</a>,</i> and <i><a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\">Second\
  \ Darkness</a></i>) had already happened. Of course, you don't need to have played\
  \ through those to play <i>Shattered Star</i>, but if you did, you'll find little\
  \ easter eggs throughout the text.</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder Companion line had\
  \ a revamp this past year. When we launched the line a couple of years ago, we wanted\
  \ to provide players with a regular supplement that would not only give them some\
  \ insight into the world of Golarion, but also give them some crunchy rules stuff\
  \ that they could use with their characters. Wes Schneider and James Sutter had\
  \ taken ownership of the line, and they had some ideas on how to make it better\
  \ for players. They began by going to our messageboards and asking what kinds of\
  \ things you'd like to see in the Player Companion line—what you liked and what\
  \ you didn't like—then they rolled it into a new format and pitched it to the admin\
  \ team here at Paizo. The result arrived this year starting with <a href=\"/products/btpy8tim\"\
  ><i>Varisia: Birthplace of Legends</i></a>. It seems to have been received as a\
  \ change for the better, garnering many very positive comments on the new look!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For years, we've been contemplating Pathfinder card games and board games,\
  \ and 2012 saw the beginning of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. In April, we\
  \ were approached by an old friend of the company, Mike Selinker, with the genesis\
  \ of the idea that would become the Pathfinder ACG. He had a mechanic that he had\
  \ been working on with another company which he thought could bring the feel of\
  \ Pathfinder to a card game format. You'd have a character, form an adventuring\
  \ party, visit adventure sites, defeat monsters and villains, and find treasure.\
  \ As you explore, you'd make changes to the deck of cards representing your character,\
  \ and those adjustments would carry over to the next time you played the game, essentially\
  \ \"leveling up\" your character.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Conventions/PaizoCon/PaizoCon2012-9PPDDN.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/PaizoCon/PaizoCon2012-9PPDDN_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Fans at PaizoCon get the first look at \"Project Swallowtail\"\
  , aka the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game!\n    </div> \n    <p>We decided that we'd\
  \ base the challenges in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game around our Adventure\
  \ Paths, starting with <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>. (We code-named the game \"\
  Project Swallowtail\" after the goblin fight in the beginning of <i>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</i>.) The first release will be a big box of cards representing monsters,\
  \ items, spells, weapons, and more, including adventure scenarios to play through\
  \ \"Burnt Offerings\", the first chapter of <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>; we plan\
  \ to release subsequent decks for the other five volumes of the AP in a series of\
  \ bimonthly releases, allowing us to produce a full Adventure Path in card form\
  \ every year! The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is currently in playtesting, where\
  \ more than 300 players are helping us make the game the best it can be. In the\
  \ next few months, the game will be finished, and we hope to release it at Gen Con\
  \ 2013.</p> \n    <p>I've personally been spending a lot of time working with Paizo's\
  \ new sister company, <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Goblinworks</a>,\
  \ and the Pathfinder Online MMO. At the beginning of the year, it was pretty much\
  \ just Ryan Dancey, myself, and a plan. As the year progressed, we've assembled\
  \ an amazing team and started building Pathfinder Online. Instead of putting together\
  \ another World of Warcraft \"MMO theme park\" clone, we're taking inspiration from\
  \ the <i>Kingmaker Adventure Path</i> and are creating a sandbox in the River Kingdoms\
  \ that will allow players to seek out fame and fortune, and maybe even one day,\
  \ own part of the world! This scope allows us to make an MMO with a team and a budget\
  \ that are much smaller than those used to make most MMOs. Pathfinder Online is\
  \ a different animal—it's going to be driven by the players in a process we call\
  \ crowdforging, which is modeled to some extent on the community-driven process\
  \ we use to make new products at Paizo. The end result is going to be an MMO that\
  \ I am confident will not only break new ground, but will provide players with a\
  \ Pathfinder experience that will be one-of-a-kind! </p> \n    <p>Building Pathfinder\
  \ Online won't take the tens of millions of dollars that most theme park MMOs require,\
  \ but it is still a pricey venture. We launched a Kickstarter in May that helped\
  \ us to build a technology demo—a proof of concept that tests internal systems and\
  \ demonstrates to potential investors that you can do what you say you can do. Our\
  \ Kickstarter was a huge success, raising over $300,000 in 30 days and allowing\
  \ us to start hiring staff to make the game. In the course of three months, a staff\
  \ of fewer than 10 people put together an entire dungeon level, built a section\
  \ of wilderness, created a tower and catapults, and three of our iconic characters,\
  \ Valeros, Seoni, and Merisiel. Oh, and goblins. Lots and lots of goblins. With\
  \ the Technology Demo complete, we were able to ensure enough funding to make Pathfinder\
  \ Online possible. </p> \n    <p>A by-product of this Kickstarter was a product\
  \ called <a href=\"/products/btpy8tb0\"><i>Thornkeep</i></a>. It started off as\
  \ a simple project, with veteran designer Rich Baker creating the town of <i>Thornkeep</i>,\
  \ a chaotic hive of scum and villainy which is going to be one of the starter towns\
  \ in Pathfinder Online. He also created a small dungeon beneath Thornkeep and populated\
  \ the wilderness surrounding the town. The book would also include a behind-the-scenes\
  \ look at the building of our Tech Demo. As the Kickstarter progressed, we added\
  \ stretch goals that resulted in new dungeon levels beneath Rich's original one.\
  \ By the end of the Kickstarter, Jason Bulmahn, James Jacobs, Erik Mona and Ed Greenwood\
  \ were each supplying their own dungeon level for the book, which had swelled to\
  \ a full 96 pages! We also created <a href=\"/products/btpy8tbi\">Flip-Mats</a>\
  \ for the latter four dungeon levels.</p> \n    <p>The funding that we received\
  \ after completing the Tech Demo will ensure that Pathfinder Online is going to\
  \ happen, but to create the game as big and as fast as we all really want to, we\
  \ need to hire about three times as many employees as our current funding allows.\
  \ Rather than seek out a venture capitalist that cares more about profit margins\
  \ and having a short-term exit strategy than about creating an awesome game that\
  \ people will play for years, we decided to enlist the support of our community,\
  \ so that we can keep making the decisions that the community wants us to make.\
  \ So we recently kicked off <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">another Kickstarter effort</a>, this time seeking the funding\
  \ we need to make the game bigger, better, and faster! As I type this, the Kickstarter\
  \ is reaching the halfway point in both time and money, which means that we're likely\
  \ to get the capital we need!</p> \n    <p>In conjunction with this Kickstarter,\
  \ we announced another Pathfinder RPG product similar to <i>Thornkeep</i>; this\
  \ one is called the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i>, and it's going to be Paizo's\
  \ biggest dungeon ever. We've enlisted top Paizo staff members as well as many of\
  \ our famous designer friends to help out. As of right now, we have dungeon levels\
  \ coming from Rich Baker, Wolfgang Baur, Wes Schneider, James Sutter, Keith Baker,\
  \ Ed Greenwood, Erik Mona, Mark Rein•Hagen, Jason Bulmahn, Frank Mentzer, James\
  \ Jacobs and myself! And if we surpass our funding goal—which is very possible,\
  \ as Kickstarters usually have a big surge in the last few days—more and more dungeon\
  \ levels from other amazing designers will be added. This baby could get crazy.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, the Kickstarter rewards include some cool things for the Pathfinder\
  \ Online game itself, including giving away a new in-game item every day. At the\
  \ higher reward levels, you can own a tavern in the game, name a spell or magic\
  \ item after your character, or even have your character drawn by Wayne Reynolds\
  \ and turned into a prepainted plastic Pathfinder Battles miniature for a future\
  \ set! And there are more and more things coming down the turnpike. By the time\
  \ this Kickstarter is done, we'll be offering one of the sweetest deals in gaming\
  \ history! And most importantly, it will help us to make sure Pathfinder Online\
  \ is done right, with input from the most important people: you!</p> \n    <p>2012\
  \ has also been a banner year for Paizo's licensing efforts. Our friends at <a href=\"\
  http://www.reapermini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Reaper</a> continued to release two\
  \ or more new unpainted metal miniatures each month; we now have a very impressive\
  \ array of over 160 different miniatures to choose from. And Reaper's extremely\
  \ successful Kickstarter for their Bones line of unpainted plastic miniatures managed\
  \ to add several miniatures from the Pathfinder line into the Bones line, which\
  \ means that in 2013, there are going to be some very affordable Pathfinder minis\
  \ coming in the Bones line! </p> \n    <p>In last month's retrospective, I talked\
  \ about how our partnership with WizKids, to make <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures, came about. Well, 2012 saw\
  \ the release of the first two full sets of miniatures in the line. One thing that\
  \ most people don't know is that WizKids was planning to enter the fantasy prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures market on their own when talks with us started. They had a\
  \ number of miniatures in various stages of completion that we adopted—and in many\
  \ cases, greatly modified—and that helped us get <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> out as quickly as we did. For the second set, based on\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>, we were able to work\
  \ with WizKids from start to finish, creating one of the most breathtaking sets\
  \ of prepainted plastic miniatures ever! Our third set of minis, based on the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a>, is set to release in January,\
  \ and there's a <i>lot</i> more on the way for 2013.</p> \n    <p>Our friends at\
  \ Lone Wolf have been doing a great job making <a href=\"http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Hero Lab</a> the go-to program for creating Pathfinder characters.\
  \ They make a great effort to get new rules elements into the program at superhuman\
  \ speeds. We've seen more and more of our customers using Hero Lab to make character\
  \ creation a breeze, and their release of a Mac version this year was very welcome.\
  \ We also saw two new Pathfinder dice sets from Q-workshop with the release of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8sry\"><i>Carrion Crown</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8u2i\"\
  ><i>Serpent's Skull</i></a> sets. Our friends at Diamond Select Toys created the\
  \ much-requested <a href=\"/products/btpy8t2m\">Pathfinder Goblin plush</a>, which\
  \ has been selling off the hooks since its introduction at Gen Con this year! Also\
  \ at Gen Con, we announced a deal with <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Steve Jackson Games</a> to create a Pathfinder version of Munchkin for\
  \ release in 2013. Drawn by John Kovalic and designed by Steve Jackson himself,\
  \ this promises to be a hilarious look at the Pathfinder game!</p> \n    <p>On the\
  \ language translation front, we already have strong licensees for French (Black\
  \ Book Editions), German (Ulisses Spiele) and Italian (Giochi Uniti). We also have\
  \ a few other languages in the works, including Spanish and Portuguese, that will\
  \ likely be announced in 2013. These translation partners around the world, coupled\
  \ with the ceaseless work done by our international Pathfinder Society Venture Captains\
  \ and Lieutenants, have helped Pathfinder find a strong international audience.\
  \ Pathfinder is now a global brand, and we are looking forward to continuing our\
  \ expansion!</p> \n    <p>The last big licensing news of 2012 was line of <a href=\"\
  /store/comics/pathfinderComics\">Pathfinder comics</a> from Dynamite Comics. We'd\
  \ always wanted to do comic books, but we needed a great partner. When Dynamite\
  \ approached Erik with an offer to chronicle the adventures of our iconic heroes,\
  \ it didn't take too long to say yes! The first issue was released at Gen Con with\
  \ a convention-exclusive cover. Author Jim Zub really captures the essence of our\
  \ iconics and is helping us to fill in their backstories. James Jacobs is writing\
  \ small Golarion-specific background articles in each issue, giving these comics\
  \ a shelf life beyond your first read-through. We're halfway through the first six-issue\
  \ story arc, and they're already working on the story that will begin in issue 7.\
  \ I can't wait to see where Jim and the team at Dynamite take these comics next!</p>\

  \    <p>At the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le3w\">end of the 2011 blog</a>, I\
  \ mentioned the impending announcement of 5th edition that had us wondering what\
  \ Wizards had up their sleeve, and what it would mean for Paizo and Pathfinder.\
  \ Wizards made their announcement in January, and released the first playtest materials\
  \ in May. At Gen Con, Wizards announced that 2014 was a likely release date for\
  \ their new edition. </p> \n    <p>So what does this mean for Paizo? We've decided\
  \ to stay the course. Pathfinder is doing amazingly well, with our products selling\
  \ better and better each year, and our licensing partners are helping us make it\
  \ the top RPG worldwide. We have a lot more that we want to explore with Pathfinder\
  \ and we know that we have devoted fans and customers like you that want to go exploring\
  \ with us. Paizo is good at making tabletop RPG products and we aren't deviating\
  \ from that. We wish Wizards well with their edition launch; we will be creating\
  \ cool Pathfinder adventures, expanding our Pathfinder campaign setting, and exploring\
  \ new Pathfinder RPG rules while they do that. We will keep making Pathfinder until\
  \ you tell us to stop.</p> \n    <p>We have already announced two rulebooks for\
  \ 2013 that have me excited. The first, <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Campaign</i></a>, is one that I have been pushing for for years. It's the book\
  \ that gives you rules for everything you do OUTSIDE of the adventuring in your\
  \ campaign. It will have a robust character background generation system, \"downtime\"\
  \ rules that help you keep track of what your characters are doing between adventures,\
  \ an expansion of the kingdom-building system from <i>Kingmaker</i>, and much, much\
  \ more! This is a rulebook that I've wanted since I first started gaming in 1981,\
  \ and I'm thrilled that I'm finally going to get it!</p> \n    <p>The other book\
  \ that has me jazzed is <i>Mythic Adventures</i>. One of the earliest RPG products\
  \ I had a hand in was The Primal Order, the very first book from Wizards of the\
  \ Coast, which presented a model for divine influence in fantasy settings. Now Paizo's\
  \ own Jason Bulmahn has crafted his own system for divinity-touched characters that\
  \ I think is really elegant. You can have your high-level characters work their\
  \ way towards godhood, or you can introduce the rules earlier in a campaign to simulate\
  \ a mythic hero like Hercules. <a href=\"/products/btpy8voq\">We've been playtesting\
  \ this product</a> for about a month now, and the feedback has been great! Wayne\
  \ Reynolds' cover for the book just showed up in house, and it is epic—or rather,\
  \ mythic!</p> \n    <p>We're also planning a big change in our Pathfinder Module\
  \ line for 2013. Pathfinder Modules—then under the name GameMastery Modules—were\
  \ among Paizo's first RPG products to come out after the announcement of the cancellation\
  \ of the magazines. <a href=\"/products/btpy7yqz\"><i>Crown of the Kobold King</i></a>\
  \ kicked them off and since then, 62 modules have been published. At 32 pages, these\
  \ adventures were great for short campaigns, or to insert into adventure paths.\
  \ But in recent years, they seemed to get lost in the shuffle, so we've decided\
  \ to make these adventures into individual events, starting by making them larger\
  \ and packaging them with a poster map. The first, <a href=\"/products/btpy8vsw\"\
  ><i>The Dragon's Demand</i></a>, is a 64-page module by Mike Shel, due out in May.\
  \ Expect us to push the boundaries a bit with these modules and make each one of\
  \ them something that everyone is looking forward to!</p> \n    <p>One more change\
  \ that you will see in 2013 is the retirement of the GameMastery brand. GameMastery\
  \ predates every other Paizo RPG product, appearing on our first non-D&amp;D product,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy7ux6\"><i>Dark Elf Sanctum</i></a>. Since those early\
  \ <a href=\"/gameMastery/compleatEncounters\">Compleat Encounters</a>, the GameMastery\
  \ brand has adorned Flip-Mats, Map Packs, Item Cards, the Combat Pad, and a host\
  \ of other gaming accessories. But we've decided that we should really brand them\
  \ with the #1 RPG brand in the world, Pathfinder, since most of our customers are\
  \ going to use them with our game. The name Pathfinder has much more cachet with\
  \ retailers, so this should help us get our accessories into more stores. In preparation\
  \ for this change, we decided to buy all of the rights to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8bkr\"\
  >Combat Pad</a> and the Flip-Mat brand, which were previously produced under license\
  \ from our friends at Open Mind Games and Steel Sqwire respectively. New Pathfinder-branded\
  \ versions of these products will be hitting stores in 2013.</p> \n    <p>There's\
  \ another major effort that has seen a lot of work in 2012, but that most people\
  \ won't see until 2013: Paizo Game Space. For years, I've wanted to provide you\
  \ with a means to play games with each other through paizo.com. There are a number\
  \ of great virtual tabletops (VTTs) out there, but most of them require you to run\
  \ a program on your computer. We wanted you to be able to play through your browser,\
  \ anywhere and anytime. Earlier this year, Gary Teter finally had the time to focus\
  \ on Game Space, and we <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldn1\">announced it at PaizoCon</a>.\
  \ Since then, his team has been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work to get it\
  \ ready for launch. We had hoped to release it in the later part of 2012, but it\
  \ wasn't ready, and I don't like to release products before they are ready, even\
  \ if that makes them late. Gary and his team are currently doing small-scale testing\
  \ with outside participants, and all indicators are that this will open up to everyone\
  \ early in 2013. We have big plans for Game Space, but like most things in the future,\
  \ it will take time for those plans to be revealed. We are going to launch with\
  \ a simple VTT and iteratively work on it in conjunction with you, our fans, to\
  \ give you more options and a better and better experience over time. Just as the\
  \ paizo.com website has evolved over time, Game Space will do the same. I can't\
  \ wait to fire up my first game on it, or use it with a big monitor in my home game.</p>\

  \     <br> The newest Paizo family member, Morgan Nicole Kenway!\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>I have mentioned in the past that Paizo is a lot like an extended family.\
  \ We had our first intracompany marriage a few years back when Gary Teter married\
  \ Sara Marie Rip. Earlier this year, they had what I like to think of as the first\
  \ Paizo baby. Former employees Lisa Chido, Stacey Fiorito, Theresa Cummins, Josh\
  \ Frost, and James Davis all had babies while they were employed at Paizo, but Mikey\
  \ Teter is the first child of two Paizo parents. We all take great pride in Mikey.\
  \ We also had our second intracompany marriage this year; longtime partners Crystal\
  \ Frasier and Lissa Guillet were among the first in the state to be married after\
  \ Washington voted to allow same-sex couples to wed. And Paizo's extended family\
  \ grew by one just a few days ago when warehouse worker Mike Kenway and his wife\
  \ brought Morgan Nicole Kenway into the world. We look forward to meeting her!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One other very cool thing happened at the end of 2012 that for me encompasses\
  \ the adventure we have been on here at Paizo. In 2004, I had to lay off a number\
  \ of employees to save a struggling Paizo, and one of the casualties was Jenny Bendel,\
  \ our Director of Marketing. Jenny wasn't let go because of performance; she was\
  \ amazing, but Paizo didn't have any money to spend on marketing. And if we didn't\
  \ have money for marketing, we didn't have money for a Director of Marketing. So\
  \ I had to lay Jenny off in a tearful meeting. She went on to do amazing things\
  \ for computer game companies. We reconnected last year on Facebook, and when I\
  \ saw that she was looking for a job earlier this year, I saw a way to correct an\
  \ ancient wrong. I am really happy to say that Jenny rejoined Paizo a few months\
  \ ago, and is already making a huge difference in our company. It gives me great\
  \ pride that a friend whom I had to lay off can work with me again in a company\
  \ that is growing and thriving. In many ways, the story of Jenny Bendel is the story\
  \ of the old Paizo and the new Paizo. And that is very, very cool.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ where will Paizo go as we look into the next 10 years of our existence? We have\
  \ a lot of cool things to do with Pathfinder, and I'm excited to see them come to\
  \ fruition. There will be more licenses with companies that will allow us to expand\
  \ the Pathfinder brand into different media—some are already in the works! I expect\
  \ Pathfinder Society to grow even larger and better, becoming one of the main ways\
  \ that Pathfinder fans can find and play with each other. Initiatives like Paizo\
  \ Game Space will launch and continually improve, providing players with a new way\
  \ to connect with their fellow gamers and play the game they love. And I expect\
  \ that there will be more weddings and more babies. There will be triumphs and defeats.\
  \ There will be life. And we will be living it together, with a sense of adventure\
  \ and determination. I hope you will be there to live it with us. Here's to another\
  \ ten years! I look forward to telling you the tales in 2022 as I write the blogs\
  \ for Paizo's 20th anniversary. Thank you for indulging me in this trip down memory\
  \ lane, and most of all, thanks for supporting Paizo and allowing us to do what\
  \ we do!</p> \n    <p><b>Employees who started in 2012 (in order of hiring date):</b><br>\

  \ <i>CEO</i></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <h2>From Freelancer to Family</h2> \n    <p>I\
  \ first found my way to Paizo, like many of you, through <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ magazines. I was just buying them off the rack, and after a while I figured it\
  \ was time to get a subscription, so I headed over to the website and set that up.\
  \ Shortly after I renewed for the next year, I heard the dreaded news that the magazines\
  \ were going away. It was a particularly painful thing to read considering that\
  \ very day I was ready to send in my very first pitch for an article.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Well, there went that idea—time to look elsewhere to pitch and keep trying\
  \ to break into the freelance gig. I knew that being an unknown in this competitive\
  \ world of freelance game writing there wasn't a place for me in Paizo's new endeavors,\
  \ but maybe if I reached out to other game companies and built up a list of credits,\
  \ hopefully good credits, I could get my chance. I transferred my leftover subscription\
  \ credit to check out Pathfinder, knowing it would be great stuff. If I liked what\
  \ that group was doing with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, just imagine what cool things\
  \ would come from having the freedom to do whatever they wanted!</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb120\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120319-Photo1.jpg\"\

  \    <br>Adam Daigle arrives at Paizo in style!\n    </div> \n    <p>I knew some\
  \ of the freelancers that Paizo used for <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>, made\
  \ friends with them online, and ended up getting invited into the WereCabbages,\
  \ a guild of freelance writers and game designers. From connections within the group—\
  which I learned a ton from—I got my first paid gig. After that, I kept working,\
  \ never going more than a week or two without an assignment. It wasn't too long\
  \ after that that Liz Courts reached out to a few of us with a task Wes asked her\
  \ if we could help with. The task was to reformat all the spells and magic items\
  \ from the SRD to the new format that was going to be used for Pathfinder Beta.\
  \ I jumped at the chance, did my part of the work, and turned my section in well\
  \ before deadline. Wes's response was, \"You're a rockstar! What can I get you working\
  \ on now?\" I was elated. I let him know that I liked monsters and worldbuilding,\
  \ and from that point on I was almost constantly writing for Paizo and for Pathfinder.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A little later down the line, I saw that Paizo was hiring, so I sent\
  \ my resume. I didn't get the job then—the opening was filled by the ever-awesome\
  \ Rob McCreary—but I was touched that Wes called me at home to let me know that\
  \ they were going with Rob. That meant a lot. Despite being bummed that I didn't\
  \ get the gig, it reaffirmed the awesomeness of the company, and of Wes. So, I kept\
  \ writing, kept going to conventions and hanging out with the crew, and kept my\
  \ eye on one day sitting here writing a blog about how I got started working for\
  \ Paizo. (Whoa, that got a little meta.)</p> \n    <p>There was one other time that\
  \ Wes called me to see if I was interested in a job, but the timing wasn't right\
  \ to uproot myself from Texas and move halfway across the country. I hated to say\
  \ no, but it was the right decision at the time. However, as time went on, I realized\
  \ I should have taken the job. My day job, while it paid well, didn't really have\
  \ much of a chance of giving me what I needed other than a big paycheck. I'd go\
  \ to work, set up networks, cable offices, then come home and write all night before\
  \ sleeping for a few hours and doing it all over again. So, when a little less than\
  \ a year ago, Wes called me asking if now was a good time, I had no other response\
  \ than, \"Yeah. Now is a good time.\" I spent a few weeks tying up loose ends and\
  \ packing my life into a truck before driving across the country to my new apartment\
  \ (that I had never seen).</p> \n    <p>It was great getting here and having Wes,\
  \ Sutter, Patrick, and Mark slip out of work to help me and my wife unload the moving\
  \ truck. That showed great character for the company and the people I had regarded\
  \ as friends even before working here.</p> \n    <p>The best thing about being part\
  \ of the staff (instead of just a contributing freelancer) is that I already felt\
  \ like part of the family. When I got here, other people kept asking me things assuming\
  \ I had been here for much longer than I actually had. I was getting questions like,\
  \ \"This isn't your first PaizoCon with us, is it?\" or \"Were you at the last company\
  \ party?\" So it was good to know that the fact that I was finally here felt as\
  \ normal to the rest of the crew as it did for me.</p> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br>\
  \ <i>Developer</i></p> \n    <h2>From Playing to Making Pathfinder</h2> \n    <p>RPGs\
  \ are something I should have gotten into early: throw collective storytelling,\
  \ world-building, social gaming, miniatures and systems for doing all this into\
  \ a beaker together and stir, and you've tailor-made a drug guaranteed to hook me\
  \ immediately.</p> \n    <p>But for some reason, I didn't try it for most of my\
  \ life. It wasn't until I moved out to Seattle and was working in the game industry\
  \ that my boyfriend floated the idea of his returning to the Pathfinder campaign\
  \ that our friends Lisa and Vic hosted, and he mentioned that they'd invited me,\
  \ too. Flattered that this group of industry veterans was willing to let a newbie\
  \ join them, I said yes.</p> \n    <p>My first act in the game was to offer to pay\
  \ off a bunch of thugs who attacked us in an alley so we wouldn't have to fight\
  \ them. A few of my fellow players were horrified (\"Do you understand how much\
  \ gold that is?\" one of them asked incredulously. \"You just paid for their retirement,\
  \ a new wardrobe for each of their wives, their children's college educations\"\
  ). Four years later, I like to think I've gotten a bit more savvy, but I'm still\
  \ learning from them.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, however, I fell in love with Golarion.\
  \ I also came to admire Paizo, a company, I felt, that was doing it right: forming\
  \ a mutually beneficial and respectful relationship with their player base, building\
  \ a well-thought-out game world, treating their employees well, portraying a diverse\
  \ and balanced slate of characters, and having fun doing it.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ came a point when I was ready to leave Microsoft and Paizo needed a project manager,\
  \ so I came on board. During my first few days here, as I geeked out over favorite\
  \ books and movies with my new coworkers, I felt like I'd come home. I'm now GMing\
  \ my own Pathfinder game, and playing in a campaign with another first-time GM,\
  \ and am grateful on a near-daily basis that my coworkers are kind enough to answer\
  \ my questions and help me pretend I know what I'm doing. The most uneventful day\
  \ here is still better than the best days at most of my other jobs. It's amazing\
  \ how the most Sisyphean task seems possible when you're surrounded by brilliantly\
  \ talented and genuinely good people. I'm thrilled to be in a position to contribute\
  \ to my favorite RPG, and can't wait to see what we do with the next ten years.</p>\
