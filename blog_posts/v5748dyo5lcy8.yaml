  \   <p>Not all of Golarion’s holidays and festivals are times of rejoicing and delight.\
  \ Holidays worshiped by dark and sinister cults and religions tend to be hidden\
  \ affairs, their rituals and ceremonies involving cruelties and vile practices that\
  \ send shivers of fear through gentler society. Scholars suspect that the Night\
  \ of the Pale—a holiday that traditionally takes place on the last day of the year,\
  \ the 31st of Kuthona—has links to several sinister religions, but today no one\
  \ church has specific association with the event. Nonetheless, the Night of the\
  \ Pale is an event that many look forward to all year, whether in fear or excitement.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>On the Night of the Pale, it is said that the ghosts of those who died\
  \ during the previous year manifest upon the world and come to visit the homes they\
  \ lived in during life. Although some might think that the chance of seeing even\
  \ the shade of a dearly departed one might be a blessing, the Night of the Pale\
  \ is not a time for tearful reunions, for these ghosts, tradition says, do not return\
  \ out of love for those they left behind but out of darker compulsions. Lingering\
  \ jealousy, unfinished arguments, or the simmering need for revenge are said to\
  \ be what compels the dead to return to torment the living on the Night of the Pale.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The evening of this night in many communities is celebrated by a morbid\
  \ feast, the food prepared with themes revolving around graveyards, the dead, and\
  \ other spooky traditions. This feast, on one level, helps the celebrants to make\
  \ light of their fears while sharing good company with similarly nervous neighbors,\
  \ but at another level is believed to placate vengeful spirits as toasts are raised\
  \ to the memories of the recently departed. These feasts include retellings of favorite\
  \ memories of the departed, in hopes of reminding the approaching ghosts of brighter\
  \ and kinder memories than those that compel them to return. The feast always ends\
  \ at least an hour before midnight in order to give participants time to return\
  \ home, decorate doors and windows with salt and other trinkets taken from the feasting\
  \ table (salted bread baked into crook-like shapes are a favorite, as these can\
  \ be hung from doorknobs and eaves) to ward off evil spirits, and hide in their\
  \ bedrooms until dawn. Brave youths and adventurers often deliberately stay out\
  \ after midnight, either to dare the ghosts to challenge them or simply for the\
  \ thrill of bucking tradition. Every Night of the Pale, it seems, there are disappearances\
  \ among those who stay out after midnight, although whether these vanishings are\
  \ the result of dissatisfied locals taking the opportunity to run away from home,\
  \ murderers or wild animals or other mundane dangers, or the vengeful spirits carrying\
  \ off their victims depends upon the circumstances.</p> \n    <p>The morning after\
  \ a Night of the Pale is also the first day of the new year—a time that many celebrate\
  \ more as a relief for surviving the night before than in anticipation of what the\
  \ new year might bring, although regional preferences for how this day is celebrated\
  \ vary enough that no single tradition holds over the other. Save, of course, the\
  \ lingering fears of what dread spirits might come knocking upon warded doors one\
  \ year away...</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>As always, I am interested in reading\
  \ your thoughts on future holiday write-ups and boons. This is especially true in\
  \ regard to the various equinoxes and solstices.</p> \n   <p><s>Download the Night\
