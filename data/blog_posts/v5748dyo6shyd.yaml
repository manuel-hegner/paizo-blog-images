  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>STRAY CUBS</h2> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  ></p>\n      <p>Sometimes, when Amiri was bored, she considered all the ways she\
  \ could have died over the years. Not that she had any desire to analyze them strategically,\
  \ as one companion had suggested. Nor to contemplate the inevitability of death\
  \ and its philosophical implications, as another had asked.</p> \n      <p>Mostly,\
  \ she found it oddly soothing to know that death lurked so near, waiting for a step\
  \ to the right instead of left, an undercooked bit of meat, a tent pitched under\
  \ the wrong overhang. Death could come because of a mistake, a miscalculation, a\
  \ failure—but it could come as easily from fortune's slightest whim.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>She couldn't decide which sort of death this one was—error or chance. She\
  \ debated it groggily in her mind for a few seconds before realizing that the fact\
  \ that she was thinking about it at all probably meant she wasn’t actually dead.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The cold and all-too-familiar kiss of a blade at her throat, though,\
  \ suggested that such luck might not last long.</p> \n      <p>She blinked grit\
  \ from her eyes, but it didn't help much with the view. She lay on her side, her\
  \ lower body half-buried under rocks and dirt, facing a rough stone wall a foot\
  \ from her nose. One arm was pinned awkwardly under her. A hand held her by the\
  \ hair, and another held a knife to her neck. </p> \n      <p>\"Oska, what do you\
  \ think you're doing?\" a low voice asked. The boy.</p> \n      <p>\"Don't you know\
  \ who this is?\" his sister replied.</p> \n      <p>\"You're not going to slit the\
  \ throat of an unconscious woman,\" he said, sounding much surer about it than Amiri\
  \ was.</p> \n      <p>\"I'm not unconscious, if it helps,\" Amiri grated out. The\
  \ girl let out a startled oath, scrambling back. Amiri's mouth felt like it had\
  \ been packed solid with dust. She coughed and tasted blood—hopefully from biting\
  \ her tongue, not anything internal and annoyingly dire.</p> \n      <p>Amiri twisted\
  \ onto her back, bringing herself around as best she could. Her legs remained trapped\
  \ in place, but at least now she could look over at the two young hunters. The girl\
  \ clutched a dagger like a claw, teeth bared and eyes wild. The boy hovered nearby,\
  \ expression nervous. It was thanks to him she could see anything at all—the weak,\
  \ steady light filling the cavern emanated from a small crystal held in his hand.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Up close, she guessed the two of them were maybe 15 or 16, but theirs\
  \ was the battered kind of youth that came of dangerous places like this. The girl\
  \ might have been pretty in a dull kind of way, but the scars on her cheek and arms\
  \ rescued her, made her interesting. The boy had a lean, half-starved look, with\
  \ hollow eyes and a frail energy around him.</p> \n      <p> “Well?” Amiri said,\
  \ breaking the silence. “If you’re going to kill me, now’s the time. It’d spare\
  \ us all the trouble of digging me out, at least.”</p> \n      <p> “I have to say,\
  \ I’ve been called lazy more times than I can count, but I've never murdered anyone\
  \ to avoid work,\" the boy said with nervous humor. \"Oska. Come on, drop the knife.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>The girl—Oska—stared at Amiri, unmoving. Her chest heaved with labored\
  \ breaths. Amiri flexed her legs, shifting them a fraction, trying to loosen the\
  \ earth that held her lower body trapped. </p> \n      <p>\"You're Amiri,\" Oska\
  \ said through gritted teeth. \"Of the Six Bears.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I am Amiri,\"\
  \ she replied, low and steady. “I have no clan.”</p> \n      <p>A brother and sister\
  \ with red-gold hair. That dimple in the girl's chin that made her border on adorable,\
  \ and that she probably hated. Didn't Amiri remember a pair like that? A girl who\
  \ crouched and watched Amiri train, a boy always huddled close to the fire or in\
  \ his sister's shadow? </p> \n      <p>\"Oska,\" she said, repeating the name, trying\
  \ to place it. Her eyes flicked to the boy. \"And you're Branum, is that right?\"\
  </p> \n      <p>He gave a quick, convulsive nod. Oska and Branum. Their mother was\
  \ Kina, with the copper hair and sweet voice, dead years before Amiri left. And\
  \ their father—their father was Maruk. Champion wrestler, champion drinker. He was\
  \ dead, too.</p> \n      <p>He died the day Amiri left.</p> \n      <p>She glanced\
  \ around, casual as she could, searching for her sword. She spotted it, half-wrapped\
  \ in Branum’s cloak, well out of reach.</p> \n      <p> “You killed our father,”\
  \ Oska said, all bile and hatred. Ready to strike.</p> \n      <table class=\"image\"\

  \    </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n      <br> \n      <p>Amiri had never\
  \ denied the things she’d done. Not to herself or anyone else. “That’s right,” she\
  \ said, voice steady. Oska let out a strangled sound of fury and grief and surged\
  \ forward a step—just one.</p> \n      <p>Even pinned, Amiri knew she wouldn’t lose\
  \ that fight. But it wasn’t one she much liked the thought of winning, either.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>She pushed herself up on one elbow, glaring at Oska. “I killed your\
  \ father,” she said. “But whatever I’ve done, girl, your father was my grandmother’\
  s favorite nephew. We’re cousins, you and I. Kin. And that’d make you a kinslayer,\
  \ just like me.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Can the kinslayer's kin kill the kinslayer? Or\
  \ will the kinslayer kill the kinslayer's slain kin's kin?\" Branum rattled off.\
  \ Amiri stared at him. He offered a crooked smile, spread his hands. \"Sorry. I\
  \ can't help it.\"</p> \n      <p>Oska snorted. She held still, every muscle tense,\
  \ for several long seconds. Then, at last, she lowered her dagger. \"I'm no kinslayer,\"\
  \ she declared, backing away. Amiri let out a breath through her teeth as the tension\
  \ left her.</p> \n      <p>Amiri levered herself up higher, still trying to work\
  \ her legs. The rocks blocking the entrance shifted at her movement, and she froze.\
  \ There was enough stone blocking the entrance that bringing it down on herself\
  \ would be very stupid indeed.</p> \n      <p>\"I think we can get you out clean\
  \ if we move a couple of these rocks and pull you straight out,\" Branum said, as\
  \ if following her train of thought.</p> \n      <p>Oska looked at him askance.\
  \ \"What are you talking about? I'm not helping her.\"</p> \n      <p>Branum shrugged.\
  \ \"If you aren't going to kill her, seems like helping her is the other option.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"We could just leave her here.\"</p> \n      <p>\"She's in the\
  \ way of the exit,\" Branum replied. \"And I'm not sure we can dig our way out without\
  \ squishing her, which we've just agreed not to do.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I wouldn't\
  \ be killing her, the rocks would be killing her,\" Oska said sweetly. Amiri glared\
  \ at her. She glared back.</p> \n      <p>Had Amiri been this infuriating at this\
  \ age? Surely not. It had taken at least a little while longer before her clan tried\
  \ to arrange her death, and surely if she was <em>this</em> annoying they wouldn't\
  \ have waited.</p> \n      <p>Oska sighed, surrendering. \"Fine. We'll move her\
  \ out of the way first. Which rocks?\"</p> \n      <p>Branum pointed confidently,\
  \ and Oska moved without questioning him. Amiri helped as best she could from her\
  \ awkward angle, obeying Branum's strict instructions not to move her legs at all,\
  \ lest she disrupt the pile and bring it down on all of them. Well, both of them,\
  \ since Branum was staying well back for a \"better vantage point.\"</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Bit by bit, they eased her out, until finally she was able to clamber to her\
  \ feet. Her legs were all pins and needles, her feet half-numb, but there was little\
  \ pain. Nothing broken or too badly bruised, she thought. She'd been lucky. For\
  \ certain definitions of the word.</p> \n      <p>\"Now, let's get this cleared\
  \ and get out of here,\" Oska said.</p> \n      <p>Branum put a palm to the rocks.\
  \ Frowned. Got that distant look in his eye of people seeing something they had\
  \ no natural business seeing. Then he shook his head. \"No good. There's a solid\
  \ few feet of stone in the way. Too much for even you ladies to budge.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"What's the alternative? Die gasping down here?\" Oska asked.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Amiri stared at the two of them. Youths of the Six Bears clan. <em>Two\
  \ stray cubs</em>. So this was what the witch had wanted her to find, then. Maruk's\
  \ children—who didn't have any better sense than he once had, if they were hunting\
  \ that peryton on their own. Then again, if Maruk had hared off on a hunt like this,\
  \ she would have been right on his heels. Or sprinting past him, never mind the\
  \ risk.</p> \n      <p>\"What were you thinking?\" she said, and realized as the\
  \ words left her mouth that she wasn't sure who she was talking to. These cubs?\
  \ Maruk's ghost? Or maybe she meant herself.</p> \n      <p>Oska turned on her.\
  \ \"That beast has been driving out anything bigger than a rabbit, and its fledglings\
  \ eat all the rabbits. As long as it's here, hunting is scarce.\"v </p>\n      <p>\"\
  So go hunt the lowlands,\" Amiri said dismissively.</p> \n      <p>Oska's jaw flared.\
  \ Branum shifted uncomfortably.</p> \n      <p>\"She's not—\" Branum started.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"Branum—\" Oska warned.</p> \n      <p>\"—supposed to be hunting,\"\
  \ he finished. His sister looked ready to throw him in a lake. He was lucky there\
  \ weren't any nearby. Branum sighed. \"We're on our own these days, and the only\
  \ thing I know how to catch is a cold. But Oska's not meant to be hunting, so we\
  \ have to go where the others won't see us. With everyone in the lowlands it's harder.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Why aren't you allowed to hunt?\" Amiri asked, baffled.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"You might have noticed we share a gender,\" Oska said, one hand planted\
  \ on her hip.</p> \n      <p>Amiri shrugged. \"Never stopped me. Never stopped anyone\
  \ I knew from taking a hare or a doe when they needed meat.\"</p> \n      <p>\"\
  Things are different now,\" Oska said.</p> \n      <p>Amiri's brow furrowed, but\
  \ before she could ask what Oska meant, she felt something—the whisper of a breeze\
  \ against the back of her neck. \"There's fresh air coming from somewhere,\" she\
  \ said, stalking toward the back of the cave. There, a narrow crack ran from floor\
  \ to ceiling. Amiri waved Branum closer and borrowed his light, but the retreating\
  \ shadows only revealed more stone. The passageway turned. No way to say how far\
  \ it went or how narrow it got.</p> \n      <p>\"That's quite a squeeze,\" Branum\
  \ said.</p> \n      <p>\"Shouldn't bother you, though,\" Amiri noted.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>\"Benefits of being a twig,\" he agreed, shrugging.</p> \n      <p>\"It's\
  \ not like we have another option. We'll have to see where it goes,\" Oska said.\
  \ \"But the kinslayer goes in front.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Think I'm going to stab\
  \ you in the back, do you?\" Amiri asked, chuckling darkly. \"Trust me, if I kill\
  \ you, you'll know it's coming.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Is it supposed to be a comfort\
  \ to imagine that my father knew he was betrayed, the moment before you murdered\
  \ him?\" Oska snapped.</p> \n      <p>Amiri's anger was a lash of fire through her\
  \ veins. \"<em>They</em> were the traitors,\" she snarled.</p> \n      <p>Oska's\
  \ hand wrapped around her dagger's hilt. Her lips skinned back from her teeth. \"\
  Liar. Killer. You—\"</p> \n      <p>Branum stepped between them. He put a hand to\
  \ Oska's shoulder and lifted the other toward Amiri—holding it close to his body,\
  \ as though he thought she might bite him if he brought it any closer.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>\"Close quarters make for quick tempers,\" he said. \"We can fight under\
  \ clear skies. For now, keep focused.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I've got no quarrel with\
  \ that,\" Amiri said. \"If your sister keeps her blade pointed elsewhere.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Oska spat at her and wheeled around. She stalked as far away as she\
  \ could get, which was all of a spear's length, and made a show of checking her\
  \ gear. Amiri shook her head. \"All right. Let me get my sword, and let's get this\
  \ over with.\"</p> \n      <p>\"About that,\" Branum said, and Amiri's heart sank.\
  \ He bent, lifting aside the fold of his cloak, which had concealed the blade of\
  \ the massive bastard sword—and hidden where it had broken, snapped to a jagged\
  \ end halfway down its length.</p> \n      <p>\"What did you do?\" Amiri demanded,\
  \ crossing the distance in two steps and shoving Branum aside.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  We didn't do anything. It broke in the rockslide,\" Branum said. \"Saved your life,\
  \ though. You were shielding your head with it, didn't get caught by that one.\"\
  \ He pointed to a large boulder, wedged inside the entrance. It had taken out a\
  \ solid chunk of the cave wall on its way in.</p> \n      <p>\"It's just a sword,\"\
  \ Oska said.</p> \n      <p>\"Why is it that people think that word has so much\
  \ power?\" Amiri asked.</p> \n      <p>\"What word?\" Oska asked, puzzled.</p> \n\
  \      <p>\"'Just.' It's just a cut. Just a prank. Just an arrow in your belly.\
  \ Just a dragon. Who needs magic and weapons when you have 'just' to solve all the\
  \ world's ills?\" </p> \n      <p><em>Just a sword</em>. Except it wasn't. It was\
  \ everything she'd done to get it, and everything that had happened after. A friend\
  \ had once pointed out to her it was a bit literal, carrying the weight of her sins\
  \ on her back. She'd shoved him into a bog for it. It wasn't about the weight. It\
  \ was about the purpose. Each time she used this blade, it was one more thing she'd\
  \ done with it that wasn't the <em>first</em> thing.</p> \n      <p>Her deeds were\
  \ not a drop of blood in water, to dissolve and vanish. It wasn't about making the\
  \ past disappear. It was about being <em>more</em> than that one moment.</p> \n\
  \      <p>That's what she told herself, at least.</p> \n      <p>She wrapped the\
  \ blade carefully in Branum's cloak, minding its edges, and bound it with twine.\
  \ Her pack had been lost somewhere in the rockfall, but she made a bundle she could\
  \ carry one-handed.</p> \n      <p>She'd get out. Find someone to mend it.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Keep adding to its list of deeds.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"\
