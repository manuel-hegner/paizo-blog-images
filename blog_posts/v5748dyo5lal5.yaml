  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, October 26, 2009</p> \n   <p>Questions are springing\
  \ to your mind just about now, I suppose. Synapses are firing, tickling with neuron\
  \ transfers. Questions like \"Who is this fellow? What is he doing here? What is\
  \ his favorite flavor of ice cream?\"</p> \n   <p>These questions are to be answered\
  \ in due time, of course, and to facilitate these ends, I must insist that you take\
  \ a seat around the Campfire of Good Times while I spin some lore.</p> \n   <p>In\
  \ a dark time not so long ago, there was a young English Major at the University\
  \ of Washington. His days were filled with classes, homework, and more horribly,\
  \ lots and lots of retail work. One can only take so much retail work, but this\
  \ young adventurer had need to pay the bills.</p> \n   <p>Nevertheless he applied\
  \ for an unpaid publishing internship and now only works retail on the weekends,\
  \ which, though undeniably a poor economic decision, is one more <i>spiritually</i>\
  \ rewarding, as it allows him to do Awesome Stuff and be surrounded by Awesome People.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This includes but is not limited to: seeing products before they make\
  \ their way to the press, copyediting said documents, and more generally, watching\
  \ the creative process as it happens.</p> \n   <p>I can tell already that my time\
  \ here at Paizo will be uniquely rewarding in these things alone, and it is my pleasure\
  \ to be among these great people and to serve you great fans. If you want to see\
  \ the first fruits of my labor, pick up <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/v5748btpy8arc\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #35: <i>Voice in the Void</i></a> by Rob McCreary,\
  \ due out October 28th. And if you find any proofreading errors, uhâ€¦ blame someone\
  \ else. What do you expect to come out of a desk like this?</p> \n  </blockquote>\n\
