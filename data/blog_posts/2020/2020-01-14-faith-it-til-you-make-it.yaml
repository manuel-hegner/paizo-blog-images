  >Characters living in the Age of Lost Omens have the unique benefit of being able\

  \ around them. This is especially true of player characters, who typically have\
  \ a direct line to their given gods, particularly in the case of faithful classes\
  \ like champions and clerics. You can think of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em></a> as a catalog to help you decide not only\
  \ what faith your character can follow, but also what benefits you gain for said\

  \          </div>\n              <p>The most obvious benefit is new options for\
  \ your character. Gods &amp; Magic has new domains, equipment, feats, and spells\
  \ for all faithful types, but we wanted to make sure that these options were not\
  \ simply limited to characters who were champions and clerics. Faith is important\
  \ to all manner of character in Golarion, whether you are a barbarian praying to\
  \ Gorum for strength or an investigator praying to Zohls for guidance on the latest\
  \ case. As a result, many of the options contained in the book are available to\
  \ all classes and are meant to encourage players to play up the faithful sides of\
  \ their characters. A great starting point for these options is with the new background\
  \ featured in the book.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       \

  \ As a note, some of these feats are restricted to particular faiths, such as the\
  \ Sanctify Water feat that only functions for followers of a good or evil deity\
  \ as it allows you to create <em>holy water</em> or <em>unholy water</em> respectively.\
  \ Other feats are tied to specific classes, like Sacred Ki which allows monks to\
  \ convert the damage from their ki blast into an alignment that matches that of\
  \ their deity. One particular favorite of mine is Battle Prayer, which allows you\
  \ to blast a foe with the power of scripture!</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \              <p>Now, as this book is titled <em>Gods &amp; Magic</em>, one would\
  \ assume that there is plenty of magic. Oh, boy, is there! This book features 14\
  \ pages of new spells and focus spells. Again, as we didn’t want to lock these spells\
  \ to only characters with domains, a large portion of these spells are part of the\
  \ arcane, occult, or primal traditions, making them perfect additions to your bard’\
  s repertoire or your wizard’s spell book. Some of these spells include old classics\
  \ that have been updated for Second Edition like <em>anticipate peril, ill omen,\

  \     </div>\n              <p>Magic takes many forms. For clerics, a significant\
  \ portion of their magic is in the form of domains. Gods &amp; Magic features 18\
  \ new domains that run the gamut of different concepts and themes. The Dust domain,\
  \ for example, calls upon the power of the gods to dry and crumble what opposes\
  \ you, allowing you call swirling dust with the dust storm spell. The void domain,\
  \ on the other hand, lets you rend reality and create a rift that pulls creatures\
  \ toward it with door to beyond. These new domains also cover general concepts that\

  \ cool equipment featured in this book. Most of the deities featured in <em>Gods\
  \ &amp; Magic</em> are ones that are being updated to Pathfinder Second Edition.\
  \ Where we could, we tried to make sure these deities are exactly the same as they\
  \ were originally, only swapping out things like the strength domain for the might\
  \ domain where necessary. As a result, we needed to update a good number of favored\
  \ weapons or even create brand new favored weapons for the new deities premiering\

  \ gp\r\nUsage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1\r\nAccess You are a follower of Urgathoa\r\
  \nThis black-and-gray thurible is decorated with a skeleton motif; the jaw of one\
  \ of the decorative skulls unhinges, allowing you to load it with incense as an\
  \ action. A long, thin chain is connected to the top of the thurible.\r\nActivate\
  \ [two-actions] Interact; Cost incense worth at least 5 gp; Effect You swing the\
  \ thurible around you, spreading inky black smoke in a 20-foot emanation that has\
  \ the effect of obscuring mist. Undead creatures can see through the smoke as if\
  \ it didn’t exist. Negative energy also disrupts the magic of the smoke; anyone\
  \ who uses a negative effect, along with creatures affected by a negative effect,\
  \ can see through the smoke for 1 round.\r\n\" width=\"50%/\"></a>\n           \
