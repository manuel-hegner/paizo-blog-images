  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 8, 2011</p> \n   <p>We're just about\
  \ ready to send <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8g7s\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>\
  \ off to the printer! The last chapter is a big collection of spells, and Chapter\
  \ 2 includes a 12-page section about spell design, complete with an analysis of\
  \ what goes in the spell stat block and benchmarks of good, typical, and poor spells\
  \ for each spell level. One of the topics discussed in that section is the idea\
  \ of \"depletable statistics\"—numbers in a creature's stat block that kill or incapacitate\
  \ the creature when the number reaches 0. Examples of depletable statistics are\
  \ hit points, ability scores, or even levels or Hit Dice—knock those down to 0,\
  \ such as with <i>fireball</i>, <i>poison</i>, or <i>enervation</i>, and the creature\
  \ is out of the fight. The primary depletable statistic is hit points, of course,\
  \ and the advantage of attacking hit points is all characters are able to deal hit\
  \ point damage, so blasting an opponent with a direct damage spell allows the party\
  \ fighter and rogue to work toward eliminating that opponent.</p> \n   <p>By comparison,\
  \ a creature's stat block has many numbers that are not depletable statistics—not\
  \ that you can't penalize those numbers, but reducing them may not have an adverse\
  \ effect on the target and won't eventually kill them. For example, a spell that\
  \ gives a target a –10 attack penalty has little effect on a sorcerer casting <i>fireball</i>,\
  \ as would a spell that gave her a –10 penalty on her Will saving throw; despite\
  \ her poor attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable of\
  \ blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties are –10 or –100. Similarly,\
  \ a fighter with a –10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword,\
  \ as can one with a –10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite\
  \ these penalties. These enemies may be vulnerable to other attacks because of these\
  \ penalties (the sorcerer with a –10 Will save is a sucker for <i>charm person</i>,\
  \ and the fighter with a –10 penalty on Fort saves is wary of poisons) but the penalties\
  \ themselves won't kill them. Attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor Class,\
  \ CMD, CMB, initiative, speed, skill modifiers, and most other game statistics aren't\
  \ depletable statistics. This is not to say that targeting these numbers is a bad\
  \ idea—a brute monster with a –20 penalty on its attack roll is no longer a threat\
  \ and easy to dispatch—but doing so doesn't have a reachable goal of disabling that\
  \ opponent <b>with</b> these penalties. Furthermore, spells that penalize these\
  \ statistics generally don't stack with themselves; multiple castings of <i>bane</i>\
  \ don't result in greater attack penalties, multiple castings of <i>slow</i> don't\
  \ make enemies immobile or unable to take actions, and so on.</p> \n   <p>The idea\
  \ of a game stat being a depletable statistic or not is a helpful concept when you're\
  \ comparing the power levels of two spells. Because balancing spells lacks the formulae\
  \ of pricing magic items, comparison is the only way to judge whether or not a new\
  \ spell is at the appropriate spell level, and in most cases it comes down to which\
  \ spell is more effective at disabling an opponent, often by targeting depletable\
  \ statistics.</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
