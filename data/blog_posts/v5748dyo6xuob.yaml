  \        Thank you all so much for your participation in the Starfinder Second Edition\
  \ playtest. We’ve had an immense number of downloads, which has led to some great\
  \ commentary and feedback from our community. The entire Starfinder team has been\
  \ carefully sifting through mountains of invaluable survey data (which you can still\
  \ submit until <strong>December 31</strong> at <a href=\"http://starfinderplaytest.com/\"\
  >starfinderplaytest.com</a>!). Whether you were a GM, player, or a passionate fan\
  \ dissecting our playtest rulebook, every Starfinder should be proud of their contributions\
  \ as they disembark this incredibly successful playtest!</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \      <p>While the entire team is heads down analyzing your contributions and reactions,\
  \ we wanted to share some of the changes we’re currently implementing to help give\
  \ you a sample of the comprehensive improvements you’ll find in <em>Starfinder Player\
  \ Core </em>(coming this summer). These notes assume you have been following our\
  \ errata, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest/faq\">all of which can\
  \ be found on our FAQ page</a> and the latest of which are <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6xq1l\"\
  >summarized here</a>.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Adventures!</h2>\n      <p>We’\
  ve learned a lot about how certain effects work in our adventures. One thing you’\
  ll see is that the team will be judicious in the use of creature resistances and\
  \ Hardness in adventures. We’ve also seen some good feedback on shorter adventures\
  \ for Organized Play and are excited to explore the 2–3 hour time slot more. Expect\
  \ to hear more on the adventure front in the months to come.</p>\n      <br>\n \
  \     <h2>Ancestries</h2>\n      <p>Good news for skittermanders who want to jump\
  \ rope and wield a flamethrower at the same time: you are now going to be able to\
  \ perform actions and use items with your other hands, but you can only <em>wield</em>\
  \ items (such as shields and weapons) with your active hands.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>Traversal</h2>\n      <p>One new element we'll be introducing is the\
  \ traversal trait. This new trait mostly applies to player-facing rules that reference\
  \ Stride. When it applies, traversal allows the use of alternative movement types\
  \ (burrow, fly, and swim) to be used in place of land Speed, akin to how Sneak works.\
  \ Expect to see this greatly impact some abilities used by the envoy and solarian\
  \ (to name a few).</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Weapons</h2>\n      <p>Most weapons\
  \ have been… upgraded *puts on shades*. These include bigger magazines and damage,\
  \ along with lower prices, bulk, and expend values. Some weapons have adjusted functions,\
  \ including using modular as a way to switch traits on the fly, and a modular weapon\
  \ with a nonlethal configuration.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Envoy</h2>\n      <p>Envoys\
  \ are becoming even more tactically diverse, with bespoke directives for each leadership\
  \ style. Oh, and after analyzing the reaction to our bold experiment, we’ve decided\
  \ that Get ’em! should be a bonus instead of a penalty—flanking’s back on the menu!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Mystic</h2>\n      <p>We have streamlined the mystic experience\
  \ by removing the transfer cost from most feats, and introduced a scaling cap to\
  \ Transfer Vitality that helps balance the amount of healing you can provide. We’\
  ve heard your requests and are also switching out some connection-granted spells!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Operative</h2>\n      <p>Operative is a solid class, but\
  \ we've made a few changes and buffed many specializations. We also took away Hair\
  \ Trigger's ability to disrupt actions, and it's now a 6th-level feat. But operatives\
  \ will be happy to see we’ve also buffed many specializations!</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>Solarian</h2>\n      <p>Solar Flare is now a martial ranged weapon in\
  \ the brawling weapon group that doesn’t take up a hand and will scale with solarian\
  \ weapon crystals instead of by level. We’re also going to shift the solar nimbus\
  \ into something that helps take the place of the very enticing Reactive Strike.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Soldier</h2>\n      <p>We are exploring new ways to allow\
  \ close quarters combat soldiers to use all those nifty area fire feats with their\
  \ melee weapons. The changes we mentioned about weapons are going to have a big\
  \ impact here, and we’re excited about where soldiers are headed.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h2>Witchwarper</h2>\n      <p>Quantum fields are now bigger, and all witchwarpers\
  \ get Quantum Pulse at level 1, allowing them to Warp Reality as a free action when\
  \ they roll initiative. We’re also building Quantum Transposition into the early\
  \ level class abilities instead of as a feat you need to select. Instead of anchoring\
  \ actions, anchors now provide automatic benefits when you Sustain your quantum\
  \ field. Overall, the changes make quantum fields more effective and easier to use.</p>\n\

  \      <p>There are so many other exciting changes in our final edition of the game,\
  \ both detailed and broad! Be sure to stay alert so you aren’t caught off guard!\
  \ The new edition of the game launches this summer at Gen Con 2025, and our first\
  \ Second Edition book, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq07vsk?Starfinder-Galaxy-Guide\"\
