  ><em>“Lights! Camera! Extreme Adventure!!!”</em></p> \n       <p>The flashing header\
  \ of the incoming message stole whatever attention Venture-Captain Naiaj had for\
  \ her other daily reports. The holographic message hung in the air and demanded\
  \ attention through its gaudiness and a constant audible jingle that repeated every\
  \ few seconds. It even had a repeating three-frame animation of the undead mogul,\
  \ Zo!, rocking back and forth with his microphone. Naiaj was not impressed.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Ignoring the spectacular message for just a while longer, Naiaj returned\
  \ to her investigation of the request from a retired Starfinder. Colrid was a dromada\
  \ that Naiaj had the pleasure of serving alongside on missions in years long past.\
  \ She briefly allowed herself a smile, though it quickly faded as she realized the\
  \ dire nature of the message; it was clear that Colrid and his fellow herdmates\
  \ were in trouble. </p> \n       <p>Checking through several files, Naiaj had already\
  \ begun formulating her response to this crisis when an incoming communication overrode\
  \ her console.</p> \n       <p>“Naiaj, I’ll handle the Colrid situation. It ties\
  \ in with some of my current agenda, and I’ll be in Near Space with some agents\
  \ anyways.”</p> \n       <p>First Seeker Ehu Hadif, the elected leader of the Starfinder\
  \ Society, appeared in a new holographic window that overtook all others near Naiaj’\
  s desk. The kasatha’s clearly controlled demeanor seemed to diminish the tension\
  \ of Colrid’s situation.</p> \n       <p>Naiaj responded, “It’s urgent. I can have\
  \ everything prepared within...”</p> \n       <p>Ehu raised one hand to interject,\
  \ “Your compassion for your fellow agent is exemplary. I’m simply being pragmatic.\
  \ I’m closest and have a group of appropriately skilled agents to handle this task.\
  \ I assure you, whatever happened with Colrid and his herd will be investigated\
  \ by us far quicker than by any group you can assemble from the Lorespire. Don’\
  t worry, Naiaj. Besides, you don’t want other agents to know just how much of a\
  \ soft spot you have for old Starfinders, do you?”</p> \n       <p>Grinding her\
  \ teeth in secret, Naiaj only gave a slight nod in response.</p> \n       <p>Ehu\
  \ continued, “Good! Well then, I know you have an especially important mission assignment\
  \ that you’ve been putting off. The Trillidiem contract with Zo!. I’ll trust you\
  \ to handle it.”</p> \n       <p>The message flickered off and Naiaj immediately\
  \ closed her eyes. “He’s sometimes more direct than I am...” she spoke as she re-opened\
  \ her eyes. There it was again: the moving animated undead accompanied by his annoying\
  \ jingle.</p> \n       <p>Naiaj sighed and finally opened the message.</p> \n  \
