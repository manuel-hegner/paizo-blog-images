  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Illustration by Igor Grechanyi\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ class was my favorite from the start. I love detective stories and have been a\
  \ fan of Doyle's work since first reading <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> all\
  \ those years ago. I've also been delighted by the numerous reinterpretations of\
  \ Sherlock Holmes popping up over the decades. For a long time now, I've wanted\
  \ to cast the shadow of that brilliant investigator and chemist in the light of\
  \ Pathfinder by fusing the rogue and the alchemist. I knew it wouldn't be easy,\
  \ but there were fears that the task might be nearly impossible or the class would\
  \ not find traction with the players.</p> \n    <p>To our relief, those fears were\
  \ unjustified.</p> \n    <p>From the start, a sizable group of players grokked the\
  \ class. Pathfinder is a combat game, to be sure, but it's also a game of exploration,\
  \ where players uncover the secrets of their GM's campaign. While some classes are\
  \ pretty good at exploring story and secrets, their true potential often doesn't\
  \ ramp up until higher levels. The investigator, through the inspiration mechanic,\
  \ gives players a leg up from the start.</p> \n    <p>While the concept of the investigator\
  \ was well received, that didn't mean the playtest and further development were\
  \ a walk in the park. The early iteration of the investigator relied on a later-level\
  \ progression of the rogue's sneak attack to ramp up its combat effectiveness (he\
  \ can't uncover secrets all the time). Playtests showed us that wasn't good enough.\
  \ The investigator's ability to increase his combat potential needed something new\
  \ to highlight his unique take on adventuring. We went back to the drawing board\
  \ and created studied combat and studied strike. These new mechanics allows the\
  \ investigator to study his opponent and gain bonuses in combat, until he has studied\
  \ his foe enough to unleash a damaging, maybe even debilitating, strike. This mechanic\
  \ kept the investigator true to his theme in and out of combat. The early versions\
  \ of those abilities were unleashed during the second round of playtesting, and\
  \ through the great feedback we were able to refine these mechanics into their final\
  \ form. </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Studied Combat (Ex)</b>: With a keen\
  \ eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent\
  \ to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator\
  \ can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so,\
  \ he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and\
  \ as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number\
  \ of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage\
  \ with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision\
  \ damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p> \n     <p>An investigator\
  \ can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has\
  \ become the target of an investigator's studied combat, he cannot become the target\
  \ of the same investigator's studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator\
  \ expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Studied Strike (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, an investigator can choose\
  \ to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action,\
  \ upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional\
  \ damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels\
  \ thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is\
  \ precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune\
  \ to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike. If the investigator's attack\
  \ used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike),\
  \ he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage\
  \ instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal\
  \ weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual â€“4 penalty), the studied\
  \ strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p> \n     <p>The investigator must\
  \ be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able\
  \ to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature\
  \ with concealment.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Furthermore, investigator talents\
  \ allow this class to increase the effectiveness of these two abilities, some of\
  \ which allow you add debilitating conditions to the studied strike.</p> \n    <p>Lastly,\
  \ while the various incarnations of Sherlock Holmes were the inspiration for the\
  \ investigator, there are many types of investigators floating around the creative\
  \ consciousness. When designing archetypes, we wanted to cover as many of those\
  \ bases as space allowed. In the book you'll find the mastermind (an investigator\
  \ that manipulates via a group of minions), the sleuth (a gumshoe who uses luck\
  \ instead of inspiration), the spiritualist (a detective who gains insight from\
  \ the world beyond), and much, much more.</p> \n    <p>In short, if you have a hankering\
  \ for playing the smartest guy in the group, we think you'll dig the investigator.\
