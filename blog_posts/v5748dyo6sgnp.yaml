  \ \n    <p>Hi! I'm Liz Spain, the designer at Lone Shark Games best known for not\
  \ so much pushing the envelope for what we do in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game,\
  \ but ripping that envelope open and refolding it into a stylish hat. If you liked\
  \ the added wackiness of products like <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Base-Set\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask</em></a> and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9fqi?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Alchemist-Class-Deck\"\
  ><em>Alchemist Class Deck</em></a> that tread weird territory, that was probably\
  \ my fault.</p> \n    <p>One of my favorite things about designing for PACG is getting\
  \ to see it played in the wilds of game stores and conventions. It's fun people-watching,\
  \ but I also get to hear about how you want to play the game. Some folks asked that\
  \ the game play in less than an hour, while others spend all day engaging an epic\
  \ campaign. Families play PACG in a laid-back manner with kids, and dedicated competitive\
  \ card players crave the brutality of an experience that can seem unwinnable except\
  \ by perfectly harmonized strategy. We got asked a lot to make the story of the\
  \ adventure more relevant and descriptive, and others asked for scenarios that can\
  \ be played repeatedly. So, of course, we set out to do all those things at the\
  \ same time.</p> \n    <p>We cut ties with the idea that every PACG story needed\
  \ to be an epic. Treating the <em>Core Set</em> as a toolkit for grafting on adventures\
  \ of every size really unleashes our ability to make things interesting. If you're\
  \ looking for the sultry burn of a long intrigue adventure, <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> is a 26-course meal with all the bells\
  \ and whistles, going from adventure 1 (\"B\" is gone forever) to adventure 7. (You\
  \ read that right.) For the impatient (and perhaps a little unhinged) among us,\
  \ the upcoming <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgki?PACG-Starring-Not-Your-Typical-Goblins\"\
  ><em>We Be Heroes</em></a> packs a goblin-sized adventure into two scenarios of\
  \ wackadoo fun. You can even use the tools of the <em>Core Set</em> to craft roguelike\
  \ scenarios, with six random scenario types in <em>Core</em> and two more in <em>Curse</em>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But especially important is that the <em>Core Set</em> itself is a satisfying\
  \ survey of things that PACG scenarios can do. We aimed to provide an Adventure\
  \ Path of a size we'd never made before: a three-adventure campaign you could blast\
  \ through in a weekend marathon if you wanted. At Lone Shark, we called this a \"\
  mini-Path,\" but really, \"Adventure Path\" is the official term for a connected\
  \ set of any number of adventures greater than 1.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     <p>We cannot guarantee there's a dragon in <em>The Dragon's\
  \ Demand</em>.</p> \n    </div> \n    <p>We found the perfect adventure that could\
  \ strike the middle ground between one-shot and epic in a little green book by Mike\
  \ Shel called <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvy\"><em>The Dragon's Demand</em></a>. In\
  \ it, a wizard obsessed with a zoning issue dies, and dealing with his legacy goes...\
  \ awry.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-StorybookSpread.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-StorybookSpread_500.jpeg\"\
  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     <p>Check out the danger entry and henchman list for how strange\
  \ things get.</p> \n    </div> \n    <p>You wanted more story? Have an illustrated\
  \ 2-page spread of story for every scenario, including denouement if you succeed.\
  \ Fans of the PACG Organized Play might recognize this kind of scenario layout.\
  \ The extra room really lets us designers stretch our imaginations, finding new\
  \ way to pull the levers of how PACG functions. Also, we compartmentalized the setup\
  \ instructions and the rules you need during a scenario, so you can find the important\
  \ stuff for the moment at a glance.</p> \n    <p>But what makes <em>The Dragon's\
  \ Demand</em> the perfect story for the <em>Core Set</em> (which we expect you'll\
  \ play a lot) is that it packs a lot of different beats into a compact narrative:\
  \ Begin with the classic ride into town as a brief intro scenario to quickly teach\
  \ how the game works, then explore a trapped magical estate, delve into ancient\
  \ tombs, negotiate with sinister minions, rescue stolen townsfolk, and maybe even\
  \ face a dragon at the end. The variety of situations in <em>The Dragon's Demand</em>\
  \ allows us to parade a variety of our favorite scenario mechanics.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ <em>PACG Core Set</em> and the elements of this Adventure Path are designed as\
  \ a toolkit. While remaining true to the story notes of <em>The Dragon's Demand</em>,\
  \ we tried to capture elements you'd expect to build an engaging tale in the tabletop\
  \ RPG.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-CrypticMessage.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     <p>Lots of utility here.</p> \n    </div> \n    <p>The barriers\
  \ and story banes in particular stray further than ever from direct mortal dangers\
  \ and include the sorts of things that might stymie hero investigators hunting a\
  \ mystery. Globally useful concepts like a witness to a disaster or a person needing\
  \ rescuing are introduced here and then used whenever the story dictates.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-KoboldChampion.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     <p>Good for all your reptilian needs.</p> \n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>But we haven't neglected to pack the box full of monsters. With the concept\
  \ of story banes, a challenging Kobold Champion villain for heroes fresh off the\
  \ hay wagon can become a masterful manipulator's loyal lieutenant in later chapters.\
  \ Underappreciated stars of <em>The Dragon's Demand</em> story (they do die a lot\
  \ in the tale), the clever little dragonlings lay all kinds of traps for our heroes.\
  \ Though goblins get much love, kobolds are so hot right now with a sleek updated\
  \ look. (And check out the homebrew AP <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk9g?Homebrew-Special-The-Little-Dragons-That-Could\"\
  >\"We Be Kobolds\"</a> by Tyler Beck and David Jacobson, which inspired us to look\
  \ deeper into the scaly rotters.) And when it comes to changing up flavor for future\
  \ stories, variability on the similarly scaly Drake and Dragon throw new flavor\
  \ onto reusing story banes for new tales.</p> \n    <p>I'm not ashamed to admit:\
  \ I want you to get hooked on the new PACG. Whether you're playing your first scenario\
  \ ever or playing your favorite scenario of Core for the umpteenth time, our hope\
  \ (and hopefully clever design) is that you'll find something new to explore.</p>\
