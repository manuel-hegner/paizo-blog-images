  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Saturday, July 4, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When we began designing Pathfinder Online, one\
  \ of the first issues we needed to tackle was making our fantasy sandbox MMORPG\
  \ <em>feel</em> like Pathfinder. The terms of the Open Game License make a straight\
  \ port of the Pathfinder RPG rules a challenge—and a lot of RPG mechanics just don't\
  \ work very well as MMO mechanics anyway—so we would be focusing on the Pathfinder\
  \ world of Golarion as our touchstone. </p> \n    <p>Choosing the Echo Wood portion\
  \ of the River Kingdoms as our starting location made it easy for us to mix in a\
  \ lot of Golarion color in a sensible way. The crusades against the Worldwound have\
  \ brought combatants from all over the Inner Sea region and thus the River Kingdoms\
  \ have become a melting pot of races and nationalities. The Sellen River system\
  \ is one of the most traversed in Avistan, and the surrounding nations of Ustalav,\
  \ Numeria, Brevoy, Galt, Kyonin, and Razmiran give us many options for storylines\
  \ and villains.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/PFO-20150704-Pharasma.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>This statue of Pharasma graces a player settlement.</i>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <h2>Marked of Pharasma</h2> \n    <p>In the Pathfinder RPG, overcoming\
  \ death is something that requires a higher level spell such as <i>raise dead</i>\
  \ or <i>resurrection</i>. But in <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Pathfinder Online</a>, player death can't be permanent, so we needed a story reason\
  \ for the discrepancy. Enter Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, who holds sway over birth\
  \ and death. For a reason we have yet to reveal, Pharasma has taken a special interest\
  \ in the Echo Wood. Pathfinder Online characters have died elsewhere on Golarion\
  \ and have returned to life near Thornkeep with only a vague memory of their former\
  \ lives. Very soon, these characters realize that they are trapped in this part\
  \ of the world. Giant barriers of force keep in the Marked of Pharasma—the name\
  \ given to those who cannot die here in the Echo Wood. Other creatures can come\
  \ and go as they please, but unlike the Marked, those creatures can die permanently.\
  \ What plans Pharasma has for the residents of the Echo Wood are shrouded in mist,\
  \ much like the Lady of Graves herself. Will she expand the region under her control?\
  \ And what's the story with those who are \"twice-marked\" by her? Only time will\
  \ tell.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/PFO-20150704-Emerald_Spire.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>An elven wizard spies the Emerald Spire in the distance.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <h2>The Emerald Spire</h2> \n    <p>In order to obtain part of\
  \ the funding for Pathfinder Online, we ran two Kickstarter campaigns. Each of those\
  \ Kickstarters featured a Pathfinder RPG sourcebook detailing a part of the Echowood.\
  \ The <a href=\"/products/btpy8tb0\">Thornkeep</a> sourcebook was the first, and\
  \ author Rich Baker peppered the Echo Woods with many mysterious sites. The Dismal\
  \ Caverns are home to the Bonedancer goblin tribe, who make an appearance in-game\
  \ as the Bonedancer escalation. Their home hex is in the mountain to the north of\
  \ Thornkeep in the game. To the northwest of Thornkeep on Rich's map, you will see\
  \ Oreena's Cottage. This is the site of the Nature's Wrath home hex and the mysterious\
  \ Warden of the Wood. Perusing the map, you can see that places like Toad Hollow\
  \ and the Skullbasher's Den can easily be found in-game using the RPG sourcebook\
  \ map. All the little tidbits of lore in the game are culled from various sourcebooks,\
  \ brought together in Pathfinder Online. </p> \n    <p>When we decided to create\
  \ a super dungeon for the Pathfinder RPG, Rich's paragraph on the Emerald Spire\
  \ intrigued all of us and we decided to expand the idea into the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"\
  >Emerald Spire Superdungeon</a> for the second Kickstarter. Once again, pieces of\
  \ information from that book have made it into the game, and when Fort Inevitable\
  \ is built sometime in the future, it will draw heavily from that book.</p> \n \
  \   <p>But for the moment, the most important thing Pathfinder Online has brought\
  \ into the game from these books is the lich Nhur Athemon, whom Erik Mona created\
  \ for his dungeon level in the Emerald Spire. Nhur Athemon is responsible for creating\
  \ the mysterious towers with large floating gems that dot the landscape of the Echo\
  \ Wood. These towers have served an important role in Pathfinder Online since the\
  \ launch of Early Enrollment in January, as they have been the source of power for\
  \ each settlement, and controlling those towers affects a settlement's ability to\
  \ offer training. </p> \n    <p>All that is coming to an end on July 10 with the\
  \ start of the Wrath of Nhur Athemon server-wide event. The Spire's resident lich\
  \ has had enough of the puny surface dwellers leeching off his emerald power and\
  \ he's out to put a stop to it! In the end, the towers will be destroyed and the\
  \ players will have to fend for their settlement's training in new ways.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>The Wrath of Nhur Athemon server-wide event starts Friday, July\
  \ 10 at 10 am PST.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Goblinworks designers have pulled\
  \ out all the stops with the Wrath of Nhur Athemon, serving up the most challenging\
  \ fight the game has seen to date. Old tried-and-true tactics will more than likely\
  \ fail against the ruler of the Spire, and players are going to have to come up\
  \ with clever strategies to defeat the lich and his allies. The rewards are going\
  \ to be sweet, with the new Azlanti Stones being given out to all participants in\
  \ the event. This event will also mark the first time that settlements will be able\
  \ to put a claim on a hex that previously had a tower in it, so there will be new\
  \ land up for grabs to those who can defeat Nhur Athemon's plans!</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ will take a large group of persistent heroes to defeat the Azlanti lord and push\
  \ him back to his subterranean lair. Will you take up the fight? Be there at server\
  \ up (around 10 am PST) for Pathfinder Online's first big server-wide event, the\
  \ Wrath of Nhur Athemon!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <iframe width=\"\

  \ Dean of Pathfinder University</h2> \n    <p>One of the cool things about Pathfinder\
  \ Online is that the players can create things that the designers never imagined.\
  \ It never crossed our minds that a group of players would devote their time to\
  \ helping new players integrate into the game by creating an in-game university.\
  \ The sheer dedication to man the chat channels and provide in-game support nearly\
  \ 'round the clock is staggering. But Hoffman and his faculty do this and they do\
  \ it well! They have touched the careers of many of the players in the game, and\
  \ PFU alumni are now scattered throughout the Echo Wood. Focusing on helping players\
  \ for their first 90 days while they get their feet wet and figure the game out,\
  \ Pathfinder University is a shining example of players creating their own stories\
  \ in the sandbox of the Echo Wood. And Hoffman is a great example of the player\
  \ whose dedication and drive makes it happen. </p> \n    <p>In the words of Hoffman:</p>\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>You want a piece about me? Bleh.\
  \ My job is easy. My faculty does all of the work and deserves the credit. But if\
  \ I must, I will share the story of how Pathfinder University came around to share\
  \ my minor role in it. </p> \n     <p>It started around a bit too much ale and complaining\
  \ about these young adventurers that can't even seem to find their way out of Marchmont.\
  \ Then Foxglove and I were chatting about the abandoned Southwest and how it would\
  \ be great if we could get people skilled enough to keep RiverBank alive... After\
  \ some help from people across the area, we put two and two together and realized\
  \ if we could make an Academy or University at RiverBank then we could kill two\
  \ birds with one stone. </p> \n     <p>I wandered down to RiverBank (which was semi-abandoned\
  \ by its original occupants) and found ogres and bandits everywhere. I started to\
  \ set up shop and found a vagabond (I mean wanderer) named Nactillius hanging around.\
  \ He became our first student, back when we first called ourselves River Academy.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>It wasn't long before people across the map had an opinion about\
  \ the River Academy. The most common themes: We should exist; we shouldn't exist;\
  \ we are just a shill for the big groups. Our biggest problem was that we only had\
  \ Foxglove and myself, and people were dying before they could ever get to us and\
  \ leaving the River Kingdoms forever. </p> \n     <p>So we reached out to other\
  \ settlements to \"borrow\" teachers. We were able to get people like Vorsk, Sspitfire,\
  \ Thannon Forsworn, and Duffy to \"volunteer\" in addition to rotating guest speakers.\
  \ Thannon and Duffy continue teaching weekly today. </p> \n     <p>Am I going on\
  \ too long? That's the bonus of being the dean: I get to ramble and you have to\
  \ pretend to listen. Back to the history of PFU. </p> \n     <p>When we had nobles\
  \ like Lisa Stevens join us for Keepside chats, they were so popular that we had\
  \ to hold them in Thornkeep just for space reasons. </p> \n     <p>As our students\
  \ grew, we needed more faculty. We found an interesting pair in Aurora and Auriga.\
  \ They wandered the map together, but there are those who still think they are the\
  \ same person. </p> \n     <p>About that time, our students started graduating and\
  \ spreading out across the map. We picked the best and kept them as faculty. That\
  \ is how we got to keep Nactillius, Garrick Orcsbane, Dylan Hunt, Dawley, and Kleptus.\
  \ (Kleptus is one to watch. Sticky fingers, that one, but usually he leaves me a\
  \ few \"gifts\" and I never ask where they come from.)</p> \n     <p>RiverBank was\
  \ eventually overrun by Ogg and we had to move. It was okay because Thornkeep started\
  \ to attract more adventurers and we were able to move to University Commons and\
  \ change our name to Pathfinder University. </p> \n     <p>Luckily, Garric has been\
  \ able to keep this new area ogre-free (though Drothar has to make armor for us\
  \ nonstop). </p> \n     <p>Was this story supposed to be about me? I just get to\
  \ sit in this comfy chair and pretend I know what I talk about. Our Chair of Students\
  \ Nactillius (how much he has grown since his first days) tells me we have enrolled\
  \ over 270 students. Wow. Foxglove as our Chair of Classes keeps a class going every\
  \ night with volunteer help from across the map. </p> \n     <p>I've got the best\
  \ job and the best faculty. I show up to work for an hour or so each day to prove\
  \ I'm still alive (the perks of tenure).</p> \n     <p>If you are new to the River\
  \ Kingdoms, come join us for your first few months. I may see you, wish you well\
  \ and put you to work. Maybe that is why my faculty all run when they see me coming?</p>\
