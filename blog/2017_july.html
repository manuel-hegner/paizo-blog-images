               <p>For Dead Suns specifically, we wanted to show off the scope of the Starfinder setting. As a result, the Adventure Path starts off on Absalom Station, but the PCs soon leave the station to visit some other locations in the Pact Worlds, including Castrovel, Eox, and the Diaspora. But there's a whole galaxy to explore in Starfinder, so the PCs will also head into the Vast to visit some new, unexplored alien worlds. Before the campaign is finished, the heroes of Dead Suns will have visited space stations, asteroids, jungle planets, dead worlds, gas giants, derelict ships and not-so-derelict ships, and even vast megastructures.</p> 
               <p>What else can you expect in Dead Suns? The Starfinder Society is a major faction in the Starfinder setting, and it plays a central role in the Adventure Path as the PCs are working for the Society during the campaign. Two groups who make their debut in the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>—the Corpse Fleet and the Cult of the Devourer—are the main antagonists of Dead Suns, and the Adventure Path will feature expanded descriptions of both factions, as well as new rules elements thematically tied to these groups. In addition, there will be some ancient alien technology to examine, horrors from outer space to contend with, and of course, starship combat against a host of enemy vessels!</p> 
               <p>The first Dead Suns adventure, <a href="/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station"><em>Incident at Absalom Station</em></a>, hits store shelves and paizo.com in August, followed by a new volume every other month, so get ready. Adventure among the stars awaits!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">To understand the technomancer class, it is necessary to remember that Starfinder is set in a universe where magic is a real, known, fundamental force of the universe. Just as some scientists study physics, and some study chemistry, in Starfinder it is possible to apply the scientific method to the understanding and manipulation of magic itself. With that context set, let's see how the Starfinder Core Rulebook defines the class:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>To the uninitiated, magic and technology are completely unrelated, but you know there are more correlations between the two than most suspect. Magic and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy, they can be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your technomancy— which is gained from scientific study and experimentation—manipulates the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space, and if necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.</i></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>The technomancer has Intelligence as its key ability score, as this modifies its spells per day, many of its core skills, and the save DCs of its spells and class features. The class has an average attack bonus, poor Fortitude and Reflex saves, good Will saves, four skill points per level, and eight class skills. The class grants proficiency with light armor and proficiency (and eventually specialization) with basic melee weapons and small arms. Like the mystic, the game's other core spellcasting class, the technomancer is a spontaneous spellcasting class. It gains access to technomancer spells, ranging from 0-level to 6th level, which represent a significant part of their power.</p> 
               <p>Technomancer spells are more likely to focus on modifying, emulating, or interacting with technologic devices, evoking or manipulating core energy types (especially fire and electricity), and manipulating or altering raw magical forces. How a technomancer operates can be strongly influenced by their choice of spells known—<i>caustic conversion</i>, <i>logic bomb</i>, and <i>microbot assault</i> are all useful 2nd-level offensive technomancer spells, but each comes with its own advantages and limitations.</p> 
               <p>Technomancers also receive numerous class features to represent their use of technology and scientific principles in the manipulation of magic. Beginning at 1st level, technomancers gain access to a spell cache, which initially allows you to once per day cast any one spell you know without expending a spell slot. In time, you add a cache capacitor, which allows you to store specific spell effects in your spell cache, giving them 24-hour durations. At very high level, technomancers even gain the ability to regain Resolve Points when they cast their most powerful spells, and can fuse lower-level spell slots together to cast higher-level spells (or, if you combine two 6th-level spell slots and spend two Resolve Points, even cast <i>wish</i>).</p> 
               <p>Technomancers also select from a list of magic hacks, at 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, which are special abilities focused on manipulating magic, technology, or both. Magic hacks are often fueled by spell slots, giving technomancers a new (often very flexible) way to use that resource, but can also modify spells as you cast them, channel battery power into a spell a limited number of times per day, expend (in rare cases) Resolve to create impressive effects, or even simply let you use computers to set up magical surveillance or give you additional spells known. Aside from spell selection, magic hacks are the major customizable element of the technomancer class.</p> 
               <p>Here's a sample magic hack, this one available at 5th level.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Fabricate Arms (Su)</b><br> As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily construct a technological weapon or suit of armor out of raw magic. You can create one suit of armor or weapon with a level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot × 3, to a maximum of your caster level. The item appears in your hands, on your person, or in an adjacent square. You can use fuse spells with this magic hack. A weapon can't be larger than two-handed, and the size of the item can't exceed 10 bulk. The quality of the item is average for its type. Treat this as a spell of the same level as the expended spell slot. For example, at 10th level, you could expend a 3rd-level spell slot to fabricate a weapon of 9th level or lower, or expend a 4th- level spell slot to fabricate a suit of armor of 10th level or lower. The armor or weapon persists for a number of rounds equal to your technomancer level. At the end of this duration, the item disappears. You are proficient with (but not specialized in) any weapons you create with this ability. You can't create magic items, weapons made from a special material, or weapons that are expended with use (such as arrows, grenades, or missiles) with this magic hack.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Today on the blog I want to talk about Starfinder. Just kidding, I'm here to talk about a Golarion that's still around and some of the things that shaped it thousands of years in its past. I'm here to talk about Azlanti long before they had a star empire. More specifically, I'm here to talk about the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant">Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path</a> that drops this August at GenCon.</p> 
               <p>The <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant">Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path</a> takes place in the Arcadian Ocean in a small cluster of islands hundreds of miles west of the Inner Sea region where the continent of Azlant once stood over 10,000 years ago—before the alghollthu drew meteors from the vacuum of space in an attempt to wipe humanity from the face of Golarion. While most of what was Azlant was shattered and sunk beneath the waves, scattered islands poke above the surface, and some ruins of the ancient civilization remain nearly as they were thousands of years ago. Some islands host an abundance of life that has reclaimed the surviving pieces of the broken continent.</p> 
               <p>In this Adventure Path, the PCs are part of an expedition to establish a colony called Talmandor's Bounty on an island named Ancorato. This endeavor is a partnership between the nation of Andoran and the Bountiful Venture Company, an Andoren finance company based out of Almas. The company spread the word of the expedition far and wide looking for the best of what the Inner Sea could offer to take part in this groundbreaking venture. Those who answered the call sat for interviews where they explained what they could bring to a fledgling colony to help it not only survive but thrive. Among these hopefuls are the heroes of this tale—your characters. Leadership in the Bountiful Venture Company found something special about the skills and talents of each of the PCs in their vetting process, and selected them to join the second wave of colonists headed for Talmandor's Bounty to bring more supplies and double the population of the colony.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>The campaign begins with the PCs, and other eager colonists, standing on the deck of the Peregrine, the ship that brought them from the port in Almas to their new home. As the ship enters a wide bay and tacks toward the nascent Talmandor's Bounty, something doesn't seem right. The chimneys of the buildings tucked behind a partially built palisade give off no smoke. Peering through a spyglass reveals that no one walks among the wood and stone houses, and as the ship draws closer, the settlement is utterly silent. Something has happened to the first group of colonists.</p> 
               <p>If you want to find out what happened to the colonists and explore the lore of ancient Azlant, apply now* to the Bountiful Venture Company and see the wonders of a new world reclaimed from cataclysm!</p> 
               <p>During the course of this Adventure Path you get a glimpse into how some people dealt with the final days of the Azlanti Empire and a chance to see how some parts of Azlanti society worked. Just some of the articles in this Adventure Path include an ecology of the Azlanti's greatest enemy, a look at the gods that the Azlanti worshiped, a gazetteer of the region as it stands today, information on the Mordant Spire, other secrets of Azlant, and much more. The Adventure Path bestiary includes monsters native to the region, weird animals and plants you could find there, and a few newly discovered additions to the alghollthu family.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Oh, I know you think you've seen a guy like me before, hanging out on the bow of a pirate ship with the evening sun on my glistening abs. Maybe you think you have some idea of how I play. That's the old me, baby. March those eyes over this fresh new look.</p> 
               <p>Hmmm? Oh, I'm not the only magus in this game? Well, I declare. Still, they don't look like the kind of magi that'd show you the things you deserve in life. Such a serious look. They're just a bit too goody-two-shoes for my taste. Maybe we should take a walk to another location?</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Feel that? That's arcana energy. Makes me stronger, faster, smarter than that idiot that calls himself a fighter over there. Uh, hey, my staff is telling me there do seem to be a <i>lot</i> of fighters in here. Let's pick up the pace.</p> 
               <p>Wanna see a magic trick? I take this little dagger here, and... voila! It grew up and is now my best friend. His name is Gallivance.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p>These weapons. Oh my.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>But I'm not just about showing off my impressive possessions. These hands, they crackle with energy. You say you've seen wizards and sorcerers before? Well, you haven't seen anything like this.</p> 
               <p>Now, I'm going to tell you something I don't tell everyone: I don't like to dance around. When I want something, I get it. Even if I have to make the earth move first. But I can do so much more than that. Anywhere you want to go, I can take you. That guy who was bothering you before? I can drop him into the mouth of an active volcano, and you can come along for the ride just to enjoy the view. You like tropical sunsets, yes?</p>

                <p>And look. They all feature me in the art.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>Say, take a look at that view. We just can't be caught in this heavenly glow without the best clothes. You see that warpriest down there covered in ill-fitting, rusted-out shingles? It's like those half-orcs don't even <i>have</i> haberdashers.</p> 
               <p>That coat might be a bit warm, up there on the volcano. My jerkin? Well, yes. It's more than just buttery soft and fashionable leather. Not only does it match the gloves, but together, they keep me and Gallivance going all night. Like my glasses? They're very special. Maybe I'll show you what they do later.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>So nice to be out of that dive. Ah, there's my manservant with my spare staff. Such lovely things, humans. They may be short-lived, but they do have their uses.</p> 
               <p>Her? She's from the House of Thrune. Important? Not really. Sometimes she holds Gallivance while I'm otherwise occupied. She can hold your coat, too, while we're at the volcano. It's a beautiful place, really. Like a forge made for the gods themselves. I feel like I can do anything when I'm there. Ready to go?</p>

               <p itemprop="description">While we're excited for the launch of so many new adventures at Gen Con in a few more weeks, Season 8 cannot be overshadowed with its last two scenarios. Just as the Society has gathered extraordinary tools with which to crack the Untouchable Opal, so too has Season 8 brought together exciting scenarios to explore the elemental planes. Both of these adventures are fitting capstones.</p> 
               <p>If you haven't heard, in Season 8 we've been preparing to destroy a major artifact, in the process unleashing a long-imprisoned demigod. That demigod's enemies are equally immortal, and they've been none too pleased to learn about the Society's intentions. Fortunately, the Pathfinders have teamed up with an extraplanar operation known as the Concordance of Elements, and together in <a href="/products/btpy9tl8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-824-Raid-on-the-Cloudborne-Keep"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-24: Raid on the Cloudborne Keep</em></a> they're poised to neutralize one of these enemies before they can become an insurmountable threat. This Tier 5-9 scenario by Sean McGowan takes the PCs on a dangerous mission of infiltration, airships, and skullduggery deep within the Plane of Air, where a recklessly ambitious elemental is assembling an army. Defy the Duchess of All Winds and bring light back to the Elemental Planes in this scenario with a special opportunity for the Silver Crusade faction.</p>

               <p>Last year we launched our first exclusively seeker-level content in years with the <a href="/products/btpy9k93?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-20-All-for-Immortality-Part-1-First-Taste-of-Eternity">All for Immortality series</a>, and ever since it's been our aim to continue releasing seeker content—not necessarily in extensive series but rather as stand-alone features. For something as monumental as unleashing a demigod on where the Planes of Earth and Fire meet with tectonically unbearable heat, we knew that level 12+ adventurers would be the right choice. Season finales are difficult, and high-level content is difficult. Fortunately, we also had Robert Brookes (caught him between <a href="/products/btpy9sgs?Aethera-Campaign-Setting">Aethera</a> projects, which you should also check out) ready to tackle this challenge. He delivered. <a href="/products/btpy9tl9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-825-Unleashing-the-Untouchable"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em></a> is a Tier 12-15 adventure that showcases both your powerful PCs' strengths as well as the serious ramifications that accompany any mortals' efforts to revise the setting's extended pantheon. You won't want to miss it.</p> 
               <p>As a production update for Gen Con adventures, we're making great progress. As I write this, we're running our final passes on most of the Starfinder Society adventures, which should be ready to distribute to Gen Con's Starfinder Society GMs at the end of the week. Likewise, most of our Pathfinder Society adventures are nearing completion, and we'll be delivering those to the convention's GMs next week.</p>

               <p>If you have been following Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild news from the start, you have probably heard about the Dataphiles. They are the first faction we announced almost four months ago over on the <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2017/03/know-direction-153-starfinder-pathfinder-society-interview/" target="_blank">Know Direction Podcast</a>. It is quite appropriate if you've listened to entire that podcast and are still ravenous for more information on the Dataphiles; after all, the Dataphiles are all about getting as much information as they can!</p> 
               <p>You can't have a futuristic setting without addressing important things like computers, corporate espionage, the flow of information, and hackers. The Dataphiles specialize in researching, finding, codifying, and controlling any information they can get their hands on (or other suitable appendage... yes that's an ongoing theme in Starfinder descriptions). The organized play team really wanted to have an organization that would appeal to not only computer specialists, but to those characters interested in accumulating vast amounts of key information. We see the Dataphiles as letting us explore some themes from modern organizations, like Anonymous or Wikileaks, while also letting us throw in a scenario or two where the PCs can "Hack the Gibson."</p> 
               <p>This brings us to the leader of the Dataphiles, the android, <b>Historia-7</b> (LN female android mechanic). In keeping with the Dataphiles theme, rather than give all the details on Historia-7 and history with the Starfinder Society, I think it's appropriate to present some tidbits of information that might be important to Historia-7. I'll leave it to all you intrepid data seekers out there to figure out what you can from these details.</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>You'll have a chance to meet Historia-7 in <a href="/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>. (Ok, easy start)</li> 
                <li>Historia-4 compiled a significant record on the divergence of Corpse Fleet construction practices from those of their Eoxian counterparts, submitting the details for publication in the Starfinder Chronicles.</li> 
                <li>Historia-6 strongly supported the election of First Seeker Jadnura, and was subsequently lost during the Scoured Stars incident.</li> 
                <li>Kuthona.</li>
               </ul>

               <p>I hope you will all have some fun scrutinizing these tidbits.</p> 
               <p>Now, it's time for our regularly scheduled boon reveal! This week's boon is something very different from what you've seen with our previous previews. Much like the capstone boon we showcased last week, this week's boon is another informal category of boon that John and I concocted after several cackle-filled meetings. To set the mood, "It was a vibrant and joy-filled PaizoCon when Thurston and John first conjured the idea for the meta boons..."</p> 
               <p>So here it is!</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Digital Presence (Slotless* Boon)</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-">You work to propagate a thriving digital community.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dataphiles: Tier 1</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Cost</b>: 0 Fame (see below)</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: If you complete a scenario that you played online, such as by using a virtual tabletop or a play-by-post format, you earn 1 additional Fame and 1 additional Reputation with the Dataphiles faction.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Special</b>: You can only benefit from this boon a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Dataphiles faction (maximum four total times at Reputation Tier 4). Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.</p> 
                <p class="tiny">*After receiving some editorial and community feedback, we're moving away from the term "Untyped Boon" and are now using "Slotless Boon" instead. This should be a clearer title for how these boons work, and avoid any confusion about how many boons of this type you can slot.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Story time! Each faction will have a boon like the Digital Presence boon. These unique "meta boons" operate outside of regular play conditions, often requiring player-initiated actions to achieve. As you can see with the Dataphiles' boon, we're trying to encourage online play—after all, it seems pretty appropriate for a faction that's all about information and technology. Because we wanted these to be bonuses, rather than things you had to buy to take advantage of, the meta boons are all about giving characters a small Fame and Reputation bump for completing certain out-of-game objectives. But to make it more than a one-time objective, we opened it up so that a character can benefit from these bonuses up to once per Reputation Tier (so, up to 4 times on a high-level character).</p> 
               <p>Ok, so that's it for our latest faction reveal. Come back next week when we talk about our final Starfinder Society faction: the Acquisitives.</p>

They taught their daughter the value of all sentient life, for even among creatures like the insectile formians, who were so unlike lashuntas and had been enemies for so long, one can find similarities like culture, society, and civilization. But even more important are the differences. The details that separate one species from another are not only what make them interesting, but also teach one new things, and inspire one to question and re-examine one's own assumptions and beliefs.</p> 
                <p>The fact that Raia's parents actually succeeded in helping to negotiate peace with the Colonies only reinforced their teachings in the young lashunta's mind. Raia became almost obsessed with alien life forms. She devoured any texts she could find that described the myriad species that inhabited the worlds beyond Castrovel, and dreamed of someday traveling among the stars and meeting new species. When she reached puberty, Raia chose to develop into the tall, intellectual damaya subspecies, following the example of her parents, both of whom are damaya.</p> 
                <p>When she was old enough, Raia applied to and was accepted into one of Qabarat's famed universities. Her aptitude exams showed a talent for both technology and spellcasting, so she studied the discipline of technomancy, using experimentation to blend science and magic together. At the same time, however, she also excelled in xenobiology and xenoanthropology, applying academic rigor to her childhood passion. During this time, Raia discovered Yaraesa, the lashunta goddess of knowledge and wisdom, whose faith was more akin to the scientific method. Raia wholeheartedly embraced Yaraesa's teachings, seeking self-perfection through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of one's mind and intellect.</p> 
                <p>It was also at university that Raia met Danese, an exchange student from Triaxus. Raia was immediately enthralled with the exotic ryphorian and his silky white fur, but it was Danese's quick wit and keen intellect that turned the initial attraction into something more. Danese was the first real "alien” that Raia befriended, and their friendship eventually blossomed into love. Raia and Danese were inseparable during their time at university, but knew they would need to reassess their relationship when their studies were complete. Danese had already accepted a commission in the Skyfire Legion and had to return to Triaxus after graduation, while Raia had been accepted into a graduate program on Absalom Station. Danese offered to resign his commission, but Raia refused. In her opinion, neither of them should have to sacrifice their own advancement and improvement for the sake of the other; instead, each of them should follow Yaraesa's example and figure things out for themselves—intellectually and spiritually, as well as romantically. They bid each other a tearful farewell, and promised to reunite whenever circumstances allowed.</p> 
                <p>After completing her studies, Raia realized that her passion for studying alien life-forms was actually a calling, and her technomantic abilities were the currency she could use to fund her life's work, exchanging her skills as a scientist and technomancer for berths on ships heading out to undiscovered regions of the Vast. Raia believes there is a certain nobility in contacting an alien species for the first time and working to ensure that both they and the peoples of the Pact Worlds advance and improve from the relationship. She seeks out new technology and alternative magical techniques from the aliens she encounters, trading her own knowledge in exchange. Raia doesn't hold to any unrealistic expectation of non-interference in alien cultures, but believes strongly in doing the right thing, and in always striving for honor, compassion, and justice.</p> 
                <p>Despite her love of exploration, Raia remains firmly tied to the Pact Worlds. Besides her parents and friends on Castrovel, Raia still loves Danese, and the two remain committed to one another, even across the vast distances involved in interstellar travel. They stay in regular communication, and treasure the infrequent times when their paths bring them physically close to one another. Some day, they might choose to settle down and build a life together, but for now Raia is content. She knows love, her life has purpose and meaning, and the galaxy is filled with an endless number of aliens to discover, befriend, and study—one species at a time.</p>

               <p>We could just make one up for ourselves, but where's the fun in that? Instead, we thought we'd ask you for your suggestions. Post your best mnemonic in the comments below, and we'll pick some favorites to share in a future blog. The order of Pact Worlds is, starting closest to the sun:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Aballon<br> Castrovel<br> Absalom Station<br> Akiton<br> Verces<br> Idari<br> Diaspora<br> Eox<br> Triaxus<br> Liavara<br> Bretheda<br> Apostae<br> Aucturn</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Whether you throw an S on the front for the sun is up to you. (And yes, I realize now that way too many planets start with A. If only someone had pointed that out back in 2011!)</p> 
               <p>To help inspire you, we're including this amazing map of the Pact Worlds, which appears in the <a href="/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> setting chapter as well as on the book's endsheets!</p>

               <p>So what've you got? Abadarans Can Always Arbitrate Very Important Decisions, Especially Those Licensed By Approved Agencies? Always Count Absalom As Vital In Deals, Even Those Legislated By Allied Aliens? Only you can prevent us from staring at each other in shame when we realize we can't remember whether Liavara or Bretheda is closer!</p>

Hopefully you all have as much fun killing everything as the authors and I had breathing life into them.</p> 
               <p>Developing this AP was a hell of a journey that helped my skills travel almost as far as your PCs will. I learned that sometimes you need to make a giant mess on an office wall with sticky notes before you can make a complex system work, and that greater barghests are a lot bigger than I realized. I also learned that my fellow developer, Amanda Hamon Kuntz is a sick little monkey. Traditionally, the AP developer uses this blog to mention their favorite thing from the six volumes, but my authors did some amazing work all around, and I don't think I have a favorite. There are too many weird characters and bizarre encounters, and my brain is too leaky from years of drinking and traumatic head injury to really have a favorite thing for more than five minutes. I will say that I'm pretty happy with the art; we gave the art team some really strange requests—from balding bugbears to morlock matriarchs—and their artists delivered.</p> 
               <p>I also learned in this six-month process that I am not—counter to what the internet tells me—infallible. I have in fact fallibled. I fallibled so hard, you guys. Sometimes it was little things, like not remembering when I swapped a character's name out or whether they were called "onyx towers" or "obsidian towers." Thank the dark gods for editors or else it would have been a lot worse. But there's one glaring omission: The <i>onyx key</i> itself. I never included a statblock for the macguffin that powers the entire campaign! In early volumes, I decided that since it largely acted as a plot device that the PCs wouldn't interact with, we could leave off a statblock until later volumes. But by the time we reached said later volumes, I knew that surely I'd included the statblock in the first adventure (it was would be asinine not to, I think you'll agree).</p> 
               <p>Now that your players are ready to kick General Azaersi's butt and take her stuff, here at last is the statblock for the <i>onyx key</i>:</p>

                <h2>The Onyx Key</h2> 
                <p class="stat-block"><i>This jagged growth of crystal pulses with warm pink and range hues. Carvings of spires and crenellated walls transform the top into a model fortress or palace. Nine uncarved spikes grow from the citadel's base—eight jet-black and the ninth a brilliant red.</i></p>

                 <p><i>Illustration by Miguel Regodón Harkness</i></p>
                </div> 
                <p class="stat-block">Though deceptively small, the <i>onyx key</i> is a powerful artifact that serves as the focus and control mechanism for the vast dimensional energies collected by the xiomorn facility called the Onyx Citadel. The citadel itself maintains a complex network of extradimensional tunnels known as the Stone Roads—once used by the xiomorns to travel across the Plane of Earth—and allows this network to bridge into other planes, granting its user the power to move resources or entire armies. Eight shards of black crystal grow from the <i>onyx key</i>'s base, and may be broken off as a standard action. If an onyx shard is plunged into natural earth or stone as a full-round action, it begins rumbling and grows into a thirty-foot spire of translucent black stone with an archway in its base. The tower's archways can be commanded to open an extradimensional tunnel to the archway of any other onyx tower no the same plane. The tower requires a full thirty seconds to grow. A Stone Road opened between two towers is typically a 100-foot stone tunnel, but as with many elements of xiomorn magic this is far from certain, and gates may occasionally run far longer, with smaller side passageways leading off into the unknown.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">A crystalline matrix—a network of circles and imbedded stones—embedded in each spire may be manipulated to open and close the tower's connection to other towers, destroying it, or restructure the tower's design. Linking to another tower requires a successful DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check, reshaping the tower requires a successful Knowledge (engineering) or Use Magic Device skill check, with the DC ranging from 20 for simple additions, such as stairways or a single room—to 35 or higher for sophisticated layouts or defenses. Open or closing the tower's connection to the Stone Roads takes a standard action, while inputting changes requires one minute of work and 1d4 weeks for the tower to slowly make the appropriate alterations to itself. Destroying the tower requires a successful DC 35 Knowledge (engineering) or Use Magic Device check and a full 36 rounds to activate. A tower's footprint cannot exceed 120 feet on a side, and cannot grow taller than 80 feet.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">In addition to the nine black shards, a single <i>sardonyx shard</i> grows from the <i>onyx key</i>'s base. This shard cannot be used to grow a tower, but instead may be installed in an existing tower to augment its power, allowing it to open a Stone Road to the Onyx Citadel itself, or connect to onyx towers on other planes.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">Whoever possesses the <i>onyx key</i> itself may mentally destroy an existing onyx tower as a full-round action, but cannot destroy a shard that hasn't yet been transformed into a tower, nor the sardonyx shard if it hasn't been installed in a tower. Once a tower is destroyed, its corresponding onyx shard regrows from the <i>onyx key</i> over the next month.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-breaker">Destruction</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">The eight onyx shards of the <i>onyx key</i> must be planted in the eight ends of the Stone Road, stretching itself magic thin, while the <i>onyx key</i> itself is cast into the Storm of Fangs on the Plane of Air.</p> 
                <h3 class="spaced-header-small">History</h3> 
                <p class="stat-block">While the Stone Road predates the <i>onyx key</i>—the Onyx Citadel and other hubs of xiomorn science already capable to opening gates to this network—the artifact gave its ancient creators the gift of mobility and the power to leap the dimensional barrier with ease, expanding their experimentation to new worlds. As the xiomorn withdrew from Golarion, they left the <i>onyx key</i>, alongside many other treasures, in a sacred stronghold in the Darklands layer of Orv.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">The artifact entered the modern history of Golarion when it was discovered by the dwarven explorer Kraggodan, who followed strange whispers in the earth to the vast treasures the xiomorn left behind. Using the onyx towers as a series of ever-advancing strongholds, Kraggodan and his clan completed their Quest for Sky swiftly and with minimum casualties—most notable Kraggodan himself, who died defending his people from the orcish hordes—and the clan named the city they founded in honor of their late savior. Once settled in, the dwarves began to experiment with the <i>onyx key</i> in hopes of understanding its powerful magic, and instead opened a Stone Road to the Vault of the Onyx Citadel, allowing all manner of outsiders to flood through and devastate their population. Wary of a similar tragic mistake, they sealed the artifact in a sacred vault dedicated to their people's history, safely locked away from curious hands.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">And there the <i>onyx key</i> stayed for thousands of years, largely forgotten by all but a few, until it was stolen by the hobgoblin warlord Azaersi, beginning the events of the Ironfang Invasion.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">In next week's blog, we'll preview the <a href="/products/btpy9qy9"><em>Magus Class Deck</em></a>, the first new character deck for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game since the <a href="/products/btpy9qy9"><em>Summoner Class Deck</em></a> last September. During the break, we reevaluated what we wanted to do with the line, and came up with wild ideas like <a href="/products/btpy9s2e"><em>Pathfinder Tales</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9s2o"><em>Hell's Vengeance 1</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9sjy"><em>Hell's Vengeance 2</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9teh"><em>Occult Adventures 1</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9u08"><em>Occult Adventures 2</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>The other thing we wanted to do is to supplement our extant class decks, especially the first seven (<a href="/products/btpy97i9"><em>Bard</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy97ia"><em>Cleric</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy97ib"><em>Fighter</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy97ic"><em>Ranger</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy97id"><em>Rogue</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy97ie"><em>Sorcerer</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy97if"><em>Wizard</em></a>). We like those decks, but we want to see what they'd be like if they had the benefit of some of the concepts we've come up with since Skull &amp; Shackles.</p> 
               <p>We also wanted to beef up some of our favorite characters. For example, Tarlin, from the <em>Cleric Class Deck</em>, likes 2-Handed weapons, and we want to give him more of those. In the same deck, Zarlova's Theurge role expands her Divine Attack spells power to include Arcane Attack spells, which she could use more of.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Tarlin.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Tarlin_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-ZarlovaFront.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-ZarlovaFront_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Theurge.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Theurge_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Tarlin and Zarlova, cheering from the gallery.</p>
               </div> 
               <p>We'd been thinking about this for a few years, and really started to talk about it heading into PaizoCon, where we discussed the issue with some of our fans. Turns out they'd been thinking about it too. Two of them—Tyler Beck and David Jacobson, who did the initial design for <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2b">Season of the Goblins</a>—proposed the concept of tying some sort of upgrade pack to reporting organized play sessions, which was the last hook we needed to greenlight the idea. So here it is.</p> 
               <p>Starting in March 2018, we will release four special character decks: the <em>Ultimate Combat Add-On Deck</em>, the <em>Ultimate Magic Add-On Deck</em>, the <em>Ultimate Intrigue Add-On Deck</em>, and the <em>Ultimate Equipment Add-On Deck</em>. We want to pack these things as full of great cards as we can manage, so each will come with just one character specifically tied to the cards therein. In Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild play, you'll be able to use these decks with their respective characters right away, and you'll be able to earn the ability to add them to other character decks! (I'll come back to that in a bit.)</p> 
               <p>Each deck will contain cards of all six boon types, but each will focus strongly in specific areas. Any character can use any of these decks, but some will fit more naturally with certain classes than others.</p> 
               <p><em>Ultimate Combat</em>, the March deck, is bristling with weapons, armors, and Mount allies that any fighter or barbarian would want. Clerics, rangers, and paladins are also going to like this deck. The iconic samurai, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lc22?Meet-the-Iconics-Hayato">Hayato</a>, will make his first PACG appearance here, so expect to see some cards from the Dragon Empires in this deck.</p> 
               <p><em>Ultimate Magic</em>, the April deck, is loaded with spells and items targeted at clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. Pretty much any slinger of spells will want the bounty found herein. Included in the deck will be a new version of the iconic arcanist, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg97?Meet-the-Iconics-Enora">Enora</a>. She likes to read, so expect lots of cards that have the Book trait.</p> 
               <p><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>, the May deck, focuses on weapons, allies, and items that are great for bards, rogues, and mind-bending sorcerers like Qualzar. This deck will introduce the iconic vigilante, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lik2?Meet-the-IconicsAric">Aric</a>—he who is (spoilers!) known by night as <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijc?Meet-the-IconicsThe-Red-Raven">the Red Raven</a>. Quite frankly, we have no idea how the vigilante is going to work yet; for all we know, he might have two character cards! Which is why he's soloing here in this deck, because lord knows what cards he'll need.</p> 
               <p><em>Ultimate Equipment</em>, the June deck, has lots of weapons, armors, and items that are great for rogues, wizards, and—well, pretty much anybody. Debuting in the deck will be the iconic ninja, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcfw?Meet-the-Iconics-Reiko">Reiko</a>. You never know what a ninja has up her billowing sleeves.</p> 
               <p>Because the Ultimate Add-On Decks are designed to be useful to a broader range of characters than a typical class deck, we'll be releasing them as part of the main <a href="/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Subscription</a> rather than the <a href="/products/btpy9ewj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Class-Deck-Subscription">Class Deck Subscription</a>.</p> 
               <p>Now, I mentioned that PFSACG players could play the characters I named right away, but you'd have to earn the ability to add the Ultimate Add-On Decks to your other character decks. We're going to do a new series of unlocks in Season of Factions' Favor, which starts at Gen Con this August. I have to keep some of the details secret for now, but by reporting your play sessions, you'll be able to add one of the Ultimate Add-On Decks into the class deck of another character (either a new one for you or one you've been playing for a while). Details are still being worked out, so don't hold us to anything just yet.</p> 
               <p>Regardless, we think you'll like it. Especially if you're currently playing Tarlin or Zarlova.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Last week we shared how Season 9 of the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>—<a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljyb?Exploring-Factions-Favor">the Year of Factions' Favor</a>—is poised to deliver exciting stories to <a href="/pathfinderSociety/rpg/factions">the campaign's factions</a>. The organized play campaigns wouldn't be possible without the efforts of our four-person team, so it makes sense that our faction leaders would also appreciate advancing their respective goals with the help of elite specialists. In fact, several factions already have such a setup, such as how Tahonikepsu leads the Scarab Sages with the assistance of Amenopheus and how Aaqir al'Hakam directs the Exchange with the help of Guaril Karela's rather underhanded expertise.

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Last week we shared how Season 9 of the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>—<a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljyb?Exploring-Factions-Favor">the Year of Factions' Favor</a>—is poised to deliver exciting stories to <a href="/pathfinderSociety/rpg/factions">the campaign's factions</a>. The organized play campaigns wouldn't be possible without the efforts of our four-person team, so it makes sense that our faction leaders would also appreciate advancing their respective goals with the help of elite specialists. In fact, several factions already have such a setup, such as how Tahonikepsu leads the Scarab Sages with the assistance of Amenopheus and how Aaqir al'Hakam directs the Exchange with the help of Guaril Karela's rather underhanded expertise. There are some big events in the works for the Liberty's Edge faction, and we want to introduce someone who can play a part in upcoming events and share in the spotlight.</p> 
               <div class="blurb120">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0825E-Bonuwat.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0825E-Bonuwat_120.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>To this end, we've ordered art of this awesome person, illustrated by Tom Ventre and modeled on the physical description of the Bonuwat people along Garund's west coast. Just as we're looking to give Major Colson Maldris some help, we're looking to you for assistance in introducing this new character. That's right—we're hosting a contest.</p> 
               <p>Include a backstory of between 250 and 300 words that provides insight into the character and their motivations. Submit your entry as email text (no attachments!) to pathfindersociety@paizo.com (Subject: Leaders in Liberty Contest) along with your Pathfinder Society number. Entries must be received by <b>August 30, 2017</b> for consideration for the contest.</p> 
               <p>After the deadline, the Organized Play team (and maybe a few other staffers) will narrow down the options and then post a new blog with our top choices for the community to vote on. The winning story will define the character's canon. The winning author will receive $20 paizo.com store credit and a custom avatar on paizo.com. What's more, those who participate in the contest—either by submitting an entry or participating in the voting process—will contribute to the Liberty's Edge faction's goals for the upcoming Season 9 <a href="/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards">Faction Journal Cards</a> update.</p> 
               <h2>Criteria</h2> 
               <ul>
                <li>The character's name must appear clearly in the backstory.</li> 
                <li>The character must be sympathetic to the Liberty's Edge faction</li> 
                <li>The character does not need to be part of the Pathfinder Society organization, but the character could be.</li> 
                <li>The character is not evil-aligned, and the backstory should reflect this.</li> 
                <li>The character should not have an extraordinarily tragic backstory. Both adventurers and the Liberty's Edge faction tend to attract people who have suffered injustices and are amenable to a little gritty heroism, and this character can certainly have survived misfortune. However, please avoid having this character be the subject of a crushing catastrophe, unbroken sequence of tragedies, or pattern of dehumanizing experiences. That's just not the direction we want to take this person.</li> 
                <li>The character should be capable. In game terms, we're looking at someone around level 5-10.</li> 
                <li>You don't need to define the class or level of the character. In fact, leaving a little flexibility on that front is appreciated (but not necessary)</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>We look forward to reading your stories and making this next part of the campaign your creation!</p>

               <p>Before I start this blog, I want to congratulate some of you on being excellent detectives. The Organized Play team worked diligently in putting together a release schedule for our Starfinder Society factions, which we're now in the process of unveiling. At PaizoCon, several of you approached me and mentioned something about "the Wayfinders" and I feigned ignorance and made jokes about magical compasses. It appears that one of our scenarios let this secret out way earlier than anticipated... so, it's about time to dish out some facts.</p> 
               <p>With the Wayfinders faction, we have a group of like-minded Starfinders with a common interest: exploration. Starfinders working with the Wayfinders specialize in going beyond the Pact Worlds and into the star systems beyond. They eagerly travel into the Vast to seek out new life and new civiliz... they eagerly explore the Vast and engage with alien species, learning about foreign cultures and crafting strong alliances between the Starfinder Society and alien organizations. Many outsiders consider the Wayfinders' boundless enthusiasm for exploration as reckless; some even cite the recent Scoured Stars incident as a reason for the Starfinder Society—particularly the Wayfinders—to take a more cautious approach to exploring the Vast.</p> 
               <p>A faction as dedicated as the Wayfinders deserves a dedicated leader. Fitch (CN female ysoki technomancer), not only provides active support to fellow Wayfinders, she also goes out of her way to help Starfinders without ties to her faction. <a href="/products/btpy9tt0?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-103-Yesteryears-Truth"><em>Starfinder Society #1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em></a>, by Paizo's own Jason Keeley, is a fine example of Fitch stepping in to energetically support fellow Starfinders going on missions into the Vast. I suspect many players will enjoy interacting with Fitch, especially after getting a chance to meet the faction leader onboard the Wayfinders' flagship: the Master of Stars.</p>

               <p>Now, I've backed myself into a corner when it comes to showcasing these factions. In the last two blog posts, I've shown off some boons related to the factions. So, I suppose it makes sense to showcase something specific to the Wayfinders. Like I did with the last two previewed boons, I'm going to showcase a different category of boon for the Wayfinders. Allow me to introduce something we've been calling a capstone boon.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Alien Allies (Untyped Boon)</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">Your tireless contributions to the Wayfinders' cause has not only uncovered unknown worlds; you've also introduced a new species into the Society.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Wayfinders: Tier 4</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Cost</b>: 4 Fame</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: When you select this boon, it does not apply to your current character. Instead, select one of your Starfinder Society characters with 0 XP. That character can select a new playable race without expending the personal boon slot. That character cannot slot a different race boon into the personal boon slot, but can slot another type of personal boon. The rules on this new race will be made available in a future update—and may vary by season.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Special</b>: A new character can only benefit from this boon once. You can only purchase this boon once per character.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Ok, I guess I can't just smoke bomb out after dropping something like that, can I?</p> 
               <p>Each of our factions will have a capstone boon. These boons are all untyped boons that apply to a new character in the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. The Wayfinders' boon is something that the organized play team knows is popular: access to new races. As the boon says, the specifics of the new race aren't yet detailed, which is quite intentional (I swear, I'm not skimping out on work). John and I have schemed together and already have potential candidates for this new race, but the result will come down to player choice. Hint: Just like in Pathfinder Society, the reporting conditions will be very important to the continued narrative of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild campaign.</p> 
               <p>Alrighty, another week, another faction complete! Check back soon, when I present details on the Dataphiles—a faction we've talked about before, but have some new ‘data' to share (*badumtish*). Ok, that joke was bad and I'm sorry... but believe me when I say, you'll want to come back to read about the Dataphiles and a new subset of boon that's sure to shake up how people think about gaming in the organized play format!</p>

Unlike other factions, the goals of the Second Seekers vary over time, adapting to each new leader's mission.</i></p> 
               <p>Even before the Organized Play team started work on the factions for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, we had the opportunity to work with the Starfinder team to create the in-game Starfinder Society organization. One thing the Organized Play team agreed on from the beginning was changing up some of the leadership structure for the new Society. We'll be going into further detail on differences between the Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society in a future blog post, but for purposes of today's blog, I wanted to briefly talk about one new role: the First Seeker.</p> 
               <p>The First Seeker is an elected Starfinder who takes on a senior leadership role within the Starfinder Society, directing the organization for a brief period. Each First Seeker is elected based on a platform: a defined goal for the Starfinder Society to pursue. As an example, the Society's previous First Seeker, a kasathan solarian named Jadnura, petitioned to explore a corner of the galaxy known as the Scoured Stars. That particular mission didn't go so well for the Society...</p> 
               <p>The Second Seekers are a faction dedicated to furthering the agenda of the current First Seeker. Their dedication extends only to a specific First Seeker, not necessarily to any First Seekers who came before or after. When characters gain Reputation with the Second Seekers, they only gain Reputation with the specific First Seeker who they champion. This means that the Second Seekers will evolve as we continue telling stories through the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild campaign, with each newly elected First Seeker acting as an entirely new faction. Once a First Seeker's term ends—such as at the end of a season storyline—that doesn't mean your characters stop championing that First Seeker. In fact, any character with an appropriate faction boon for that specific First Seeker can continue to champion that individual for the rest of her career—just don't expect a lot of new scenarios involving that First Seeker!</p> 
               <p>Because of the First Seeker's importance to the Second Seekers faction, you'll see the Second Seekers presented in text with the associated First Seeker listed in parenthesis. The first iteration of the Second Seekers faction shows up as "Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo)."</p> 
               <div class="blurb180" style="background-color: #fff;">
                <a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7201-Luwazi.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7201-Luwazi_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustration by Miroslav Petrov</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>This brings us to our first faction leader for the Second Seekers: <b>Luwazi Elsebo</b> (NG female human envoy). Luwazi was responsible for keeping the Starfinder Society together in the aftermath of the previous First Seeker's expedition to the Scoured Stars. Her goals include rebuilding the damaged Society while investigating what happened in the Scoured Stars. If any of the Starfinders lost in the Scoured Stars can be saved, Luwazi intends to find a way to make that happen.</p> 
               <p>Players get their first chance to interact with Luwazi Elsebo in <a href="/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement"><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a>, the pregenerated character special debuting at Gen Con 2017, written by Pathfinder Society and Adventure Path veteran, Larry Wilhelm. This scenario acts as a prequel to the start of the Year of Scoured Stars, and showcases some of Luwazi's more unorthodox methods for keeping the Starfinder Society intact, along with the first seeds of a faction we'll be spotlighting in a future blog.</p> 
               <p>Now, I don't want the Exo-Guardians to get away with having more information than our recently spotlighted faction, so I figure I can share one more thing. Characters gaining Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) Reputation can access some pretty exceptional boons, many of them themed around the idea of preserving and rebuilding the wounded Starfinder Society. Here's one boon I think a lot of Second Seekers are going to pick up.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Team Spirit (Untyped Boon)</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">You are an expert at using your resources to help other Stafinders.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo): Tier 2</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Cost</b>: 1 Fame</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: When you or another character is killed during an adventure in which your participated, reduce the Fame cost of the raise dead spellcasting service by 2. This boon is not expended when used.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Special</b>: A character can only benefit from one copy of this book at a time, to a maximum discount of 2 Fame.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>As you can see, a character purchasing this boon reduces the cost of raise dead by a noticeable amount of Fame. Even if just one character in a group has this boon, every character at the table benefits from the discount. I suspect we'll see a lot of characters gaining Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) Reputation picking this boon up. I also suspect we'll see groups looking to muster for higher difficulty content going out of their way to make sure a Second Seeker is on the team!</p> 
               <p>Ok, that's it for today's post; I need to get back to finishing up the last Gen Con scenarios. Stay tuned for our next blog, when we talk about Wayfinders—and I don't mean the magical compasses!</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>Few appendices have made as big a splash in gaming history as Gary Gygax's Appendix N. (<i>I thought Cosmo's appendix bursting at Gen Con that one year might have it beat, but he reminded me that was technically a gallbladder removal, so it's OUT OF THE RUNNING!</i>) That formative list of novels hit in 1979, in the <em>AD&amp;D Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. In it, Gygax laid out some of the works that had made the largest impact on him in the creation of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, from Leigh Brackett and Robert E. Howard to Jack Vance and Andre Norton. In doing so, he created a reading list for an entire generation of gamers and fantasy fans, and had a tremendous impact on the genre as a whole.</p> 
               <p>When we created the <a href="/products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook"><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a> in 2009, we gleefully took the opportunity to publish our own version of Appendix N, keen to introduce fans to our new favorites like Clive Barker and China Miéville, along with grand masters like C. L. Moore. Yet it was ultimately still a fairly small list—just a single column of text—and cribbed heavily from Gygax, focusing solely on novels.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">When I first sat down to paginate the <a href="/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, I knew that space was going to be at a premium.

               <p>So here, in its entirety, is the Inspirational Media list from the back of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>. These are just a few of the science fiction and science fantasy works that most influenced us in our creation of Starfinder's rules and setting. Staff members from many different departments contributed their nominations, and believe me, cutting the list down to just two pages was brutal. I also want to give a particular shout-out to the folks in the Tabletop RPG section. It was really important to us to include not just the games we grew up playing, but also our favorite modern games like Numenera and Eclipse Phase. There's no question that there are some brilliant SF games out there at the moment, and we're excited to be joining their party.</p> 
               <p>So what are you waiting for? From <em>Illuminae</em> to <em>Hyperion</em>, <em>Saga</em> to <em>Serenity</em>, there's a world of amazing speculative fiction waiting for you—and hey, you've still got a month to kill until Starfinder launches!</p>

It is a new class, and a new concept, unique to Starfinder though clearly inspired by various iconic science-fantasy tropes. It can be described as a kind of supernatural philosopher-warrior, with a focus on the stellar powers of light and gravity, but that doesn't give a very good idea of what the class can actually do. For starters, let's take a look at what the <a href="/products/btpy9tqw?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Subscription"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> has to say about the solarian.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>The stars guide the planets with gravity, create life with light and heat, and utterly consume worlds in supernovas and black holes. You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.</i></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>The cycle that empowers and guides solarians is a philosophy that came to the Pact Worlds on the <i>Idari</i>, along with the tradition of the solarians themselves. Even now, nearly a century after the kasatha worldship's arrival in system, solarians are more commonly kasatha than any other race (though certainly there are other solarian traditions, as they can even be found in systems with no contact with Kasath).</p> 
               <p>The solarian has a full base attack bonus, good Fortitude and Will saves bonuses, 4 skill points per level, and 10 fixed class skills. At 1st level, a solarian gains the skill adept ability, which represents training gained in the process that led to a character becoming a solarian and which grants two more class skills of the player's choice. A solarian has proficiency with light armor, and proficiency and eventually specialization with small arms and basic and advanced melee weapons.</p> 
               <p>Also at 1st level, a solarian gains a solar manifestation, and access to stellar modes. The solar manifestation is a physical representation of the solarian's stellar powers. When not in use, it is a mote of energy slightly smaller than a fist that glows with light (or is the black of perfect darkness) and hovers near the solarian's head. When activated, the mote becomes either a solar weapon (which is treated as an advanced melee weapon, deals damage that increases as the solarian gains levels, and can be further augmented through the addition of solarian weapon crystals), or solar armor (which enwraps and protects the solarian, augmenting the AC bonus of any light armor the solarian wears and at higher levels giving cold or fire resistance).</p> 
               <p>Stellar modes are forms of attunement the solarian can focus on in combat. Each round in a fight, the solarian can remain unattuned, or increase either photon attunement or graviton attunement, depending on whether the solarian wishes to draw on the stellar powers of light and heat and life-giving energy, or darkness and gravity and all things being bound together. Every solarian has access to both photon and graviton powers (and gains more via stellar revelations as he gains levels), and can use either even regardless of attunement—though many powers gain additional effects if the solarian is attuned to their power source. For example, a solarian with the 6th-level corona photon power gains cold resistance, and deals fire damage to any adjacent foe that strikes the solarian with a melee weapon. However, if the solarian is photon attuned, the corona also causes any creature that begins its turn adjacent to the solarian to automatically take some fire damage. While some stellar revelations can only target creatures once a day, or only under specific situations, in general there's no limit to how often a solarian can use the powers tied to their stellar modes.</p> 
               <p>After 3 rounds of attunement to exclusively photon or graviton powers, a solarian can reach full attunement, which grants access to zenith powers. Each solarian begins play with two zenith powers: black hole, which draws a foe closer to you, and supernova, which does fire damage to everyone within 10 feet of you. Using a zenith power causes you to be unattuned afterwards, so zenith powers can be used at most once every few rounds. However, in general there's no other limitation to how often a solarian can use these powers in combat—if a fight lasts long enough to keep cycling through zenith powers, the solarian is free to do so.</p> 
               <p>While the choice of solar armor or solar weapon and selection of different stellar revelations are the primary customization options for a solarian, they have a few other minor abilities at well. At 3rd level a solarian gains sidereal influence, which allows the solarian to meditate to gain bonuses to photon- and graviton-related skills. At 7th level, a solarian gains flashing strikes, which allows them to make a full attack entirely with melee weapons at a reduced attack penalty, and at 13th level a solarian's onslaught allows their full attack to be three attacks rather than the normal two (though all three attacks are at a slightly higher penalty). At 20th level, a solarian gains full attunement in a stellar mode more quickly, can switch from one full attunement to another, and even spend 1 Resolve to immediately become fully attuned.</p> 
               <p>Given the importance of stellar modes and stellar revelations, here are two sample revelations.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Blazing Orbit (Su) [6th level photon revelation]</b> As a move action, you can move up to your speed, gaining concealment against any attack made against you during the move, and you can leave a trail of flames in every square you pass through. The flames last for 1 round and deal 2d6 fire damage to anyone who moves into them. You can't move through another creature's space during this movement. If you use blazing orbit again, any flames you previously created with it go out. The damage from the flames increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p> 
                <p>When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature damaged by the flames also gains the burning condition (1d6 fire damage; see page 273).</p> 
                <p><b>Crush (Su) [6th level graviton revelation]</b> As a standard action, you can increase the effects of gravity on the internal organs or workings of a target within 30 feet, causing it to have difficulty maintaining its normal functionality. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. This revelation also affects constructs. You can maintain this effect as a move action each round, but the target can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect. Once a creature succeeds at this save or the effect ends, you can't target that creature with crush again for 24 hours.</p> 
                <p>When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to also stun the target for 1 round. Maintaining crush on subsequent rounds extends the staggered effect, but not the stunned effect.</p>

               <p><i>This is the eleventh installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy">here</a>.</i></p>

However, the metagame of PACG is quite important too—and it's much of what makes the game unique. That metagame begins with the construction of a party, which depends on understanding the types of characters you're using.</p>
               <p> </p>
               <h2>Warriors are the most important characters</h2> 
               <p>The two main goals in most scenarios are to defeat henchmen so that you can close locations and to defeat villains so that you can win the game. This means that warriors are the most important type of character in the game. However, don't take this to mean just weapon users; warriors include any character who can generate high results on combat checks. Amiri is a warrior, obviously, but so is Ezren, since he can reliably draw spells and use them to generate high combat values.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-AmiriFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-AmiriFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-EzrenFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-EzrenFront_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Wars not make one great. <i>Warriors</i> make one great.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>Whatever their precise class, you should have lots of warriors.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Be very careful of characters with weak skill/card combos.</i> If a character doesn't have either the Ranged or Melee skill, he's more likely to end up in a bad situation, rolling small, unmodified dice in combat. But you need to be especially careful if these characters also have few weapons or few combat spells. Lini may be the weakest warrior in Rise of the Runelords because she has no Ranged skill, no Melee skill, starts out rolling a d4 in combat, has to pay a card to get that to a reasonable number, has no weapons, and will likely use some of her spell slots for healing or support.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Be somewhat careful of characters with low fighting stats.</i> It may be less obvious that you should be wary of characters who have a low die associated with their Ranged or Melee skill. Kyra from Rise of the Runelords is the prime example here, since she uses a lowly d6 for her Melee skill. This is fine for fighting most low-level monsters, but it's awful when you're fighting powerful monsters, henchmen, or villains, because in those situations you often want to lay down the blessings… and they'll be worth just 1d6 each!</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #3: Be aware of your weak warriors.</i> Just because warriors are important doesn't mean you should ignore characters who are weak at fighting, because everyone has their own advantages: Kyra is crucial for healing and Lini is perhaps the best character in the game because she's strong at <i>everything</i> other than combat if she has an animal present. The trick is to know who your strong warriors are and who your weak warriors are, and use them appropriately. Send the strong warriors after villains and monster-heavy locations and send the weak warriors after boon-filled locations and use them to temporarily close locations while the villain is being fought.</p> 
               <h2>Healers are the second most important characters</h2> 
               <p>Because cards are a limited resource in PACG, a party without a healer is at a grave disadvantage. Characters will usually only be able to use their cards once, and every one that slips out of a deck due to play or to damage puts that character one inevitable step closer to both death and loss. One healer in a party is practically required, so healers are the second most important character type in PACG.</p> 
               <p>Healers typically include any character with the Divine skill and spell card slots (and, obviously, some healing spells in those slots). A few characters like Kyra and Seelah can heal without specific spells, but spells are generally better, so those powers should be considered backups.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-KyraFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-KyraFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SeelahFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SeelahFront_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>To err is human; to heal, Divine.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p>If you have no healers, then you're likely to spend a lot of your time and effort figuring out how to overcome that deficiency, perhaps with one-use healing spells for Merisiel, perhaps with healing objects and healing allies. You'll be able to make a go of it, but it'll hurt your efficiency.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: It's good to have a backup healer.</i> One healer is good, but having at least one and a half is better. It might be another major healer or it might be someone like Lem (or even an advanced Merisiel) who can mix a Cure spell into his deck. The object is to have healing available if your main healer is tied down, if her deck is clogged, or even if she's not available for a play session. But don't go overboard: healing is vitally important, but you'll pay for it with lost efficiency in other areas (like fighting!), so only include the healers you need, which is probably somewhere between one and two.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Make sure your main healer can recycle cards.</i> You should make sure that your main healer has some way to get expended healing back into her deck. For example, Kyra and Seelah can both do so with their special healing abilities, while Lem can exchange other spells for his healing if it ends up in his discard pile. Another easy method to keep a healer cycling is to make sure she has at least two healing spells: if she fails to recharge the first, she can heal herself with the second.</p> 
               <h2>Disablers are the third most important characters</h2> 
               <p>Banes fall into two categories: monsters and barriers. Thanks to your focus on warriors, you've already taken care of the monsters, but you still need to worry about barriers. If you continually fail to defeat them, they can dramatically slow down your gameplay. If they get stuck on top of a location deck, they can prevent exploration. And if they do lots of damage, they can even kill your characters.</p> 
               <p>They're a lot more varied than monsters, so how do you defeat them? Make sure that your party has at least some disabler support with a character strong in Dexterity (possibly with the Acrobatics or Disable skills) and/or Wisdom (possibly with the Perception skill).</p> 
               <p>Merisiel is usually an optimal character to fill the disabler niche. In Rise of the Runelords, she has all three skills, with Acrobatics and Disable at d12+2. Rise of the Runelords Sajan is almost as good, with Acrobatics at d10+2 and Wisdom at d8. In Skull &amp; Shackles, Damiel and Jirelle are good choices; in Wrath of the Righteous, Arueshalae and Ekkie are strong at Dexterity but weak at Wisdom. Mummy's Mask offers quite a few possibilities, of which Damiel and Mavaro are the most well-rounded.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Be aware of your deficiency.</i> Since they're your third priority, disablers are the character type that you're most likely to neglect in your PACG party. If so, be aware of this deficiency. Save the barrier-heavy locations for last, or be sure you have extra blessings when you visit them. Alternatively, build your decks and take feats to help you better deal with barriers: Masterwork Tools can be a pretty good solution until late in an adventure path.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MerisielFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MerisielFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MasterworkTools.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MasterworkTools_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005-DisjunctionPulse.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005-DisjunctionPulse_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p>Sometimes you need skills, and sometimes you need cards. And sometimes you need both.</p> 
               </div> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Be aware of your adventure.</i> Also be aware that there's quite a bit of variability for barriers between the different adventure paths. Rise of the Runelords has the most traditional traps. Skull &amp; Shackles has quite a few Task barriers that require a wider variety of skills. Wrath of the Righteous has a lot of Temptations that can (perhaps) be easily overcome without skill rolls.</p> 
               <p>Of course, knowing the types of characters to include in your group is just the first step; there's a lot more to building a good party, as will be discussed in the next two articles.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">In the pursuit of ancient secrets and unclaimed treasures, the Pathfinder Society doesn't just make discoveries; it also makes enemies. A cast of the campaign's greatest villains has conspired to take their revenge against the Pathfinder, bringing war to the footstep of the great city Absalom and chaos to the Inner Sea region. For years, factions within the Society have championed their own agendas, fought for recognition, and accumulated resources. At last they have a chance to prove themselves—an experience that could leave these organizations changed forever in Season 9 of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: the Year of Factions' Favor.</p>

               <p>PaizoCon wrapped up about a month ago, and although we announced the next season of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild at the preview banquet, we're overdue for a proper introduction on paizo.com.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description"><i>In the pursuit of ancient secrets and unclaimed treasures, the Pathfinder Society doesn't just make discoveries; it also makes enemies. A cast of the campaign's greatest villains has conspired to take their revenge against the Pathfinder, bringing war to the footstep of the great city Absalom and chaos to the Inner Sea region. For years, factions within the Society have championed their own agendas, fought for recognition, and accumulated resources. At last they have a chance to prove themselves—an experience that could leave these organizations changed forever in Season 9 of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: the Year of Factions' Favor.</i></p> 
                <p><i>In the coming year, Pathfinders have an opportunity to redeem souls, avert an invasion, uncover hidden secrets below an infamous museum, and vanquish an ageless evil poised to take control of the region's greatest minds. At the same time, players can use faction resources to shut down an exploitative consortium, thwart a league of dangerous villains, oust an infamous tyrant, and decide whether the ends justify the means in the pursuit of justice. On top of this there are tombs to unseal, artifacts to recover, and countless other adventures that await in this exciting season that debuts at Gen Con 2017!</i></p>

               </div> 
               <p>One of the big questions I've heard over the past several years is "Our factions keep building connections and accumulating resources, but for what?" For some factions it's been pretty clear, such as the then-Taldor building up steam to launch its own Army of Exploration during Season 5. For others, the payoffs have been less obvious. For others still, it's been less a question of payoff and more a matter of self-reflection; some of the factions have found themselves pulled in multiple directions, whether that's multiple leaders vying for ideological dominance or a leader and a faction growing steadily less suited for each other. With Season 9, we're examining a bunch of these questions by giving many factions a big events in which to flex their muscles, prove their worth (in-game and out), and trigger some substantial changes on the world. Some factions are performing some house cleaning, such as rooting out corruption or thwarting a growing menace within their ranks. Others still are receiving smaller-scale stories tied to recurring characters whose narratives spin into a much larger event. All in all, each of the factions is getting something exciting to pursue over the course of Season 9.</p> 
               <p>Although Season 9 had a placeholder name of "Year of the Factions" for many months, the adventures are far from faction-exclusive. Characters of all factions should be able to enjoy these scenarios, and Society leadership will oversee the vast majority of these adventures—particularly ensuring that the Society's interests aren't lost in the shuffle. Many of these adventures also involve the same elements that we've come to expect from Pathfinder Society scenarios, such as exploring ancient sites, uncovering hidden secrets, discovering rarely-traveled lands, and dishing out a generous helping of RPG action. All the while, the factions are jostling for the opportunity to lend their support and be awesome. For example, if a noteworthy port is giving the Society trouble and keeping the PCs from going on an adventure, you can bet the Exchange is chomping at the bit and saying, "Is this municipality using economic warfare to block you? Two can play at that game. Hold my beer."</p> 
               <p>On top of that, we'll have a helping of unaffiliated adventures, including a new higher-than-1st-level replayable adventure.</p> 
               <h2>The Adventure Path</h2> 
               <p>From Season 3 to Season 6 of Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, the campaign's overarching theme connected to one of two Adventure Paths that would release that year. While this allowed the developers to promote and borrow from the supporting literature released around that same time for the Adventure Path, it also meant the organized play program was telling less of its own story. Beginning in Season 7, we broke from that mold. While the freedom to craft our own narrative is delightful, I've been missing the sense of cross-product collaboration. The difference is that rather than wait for the Adventure Path line to set the direction, I went straight to Crystal Frasier to start planning things from the ground up.</p> 
               <p>Crystal's a delightful co-conspirator, and I've known for a while that her desire to shake up Taldor is even stronger than my own. When we put our heads together, we realized just how well our two stories could work together, rather than one being subservient to the other. After all, the Sovereign Court's been building up to something big for quite some time, and overthrowing an irresponsible monarch in order to revitalize one of our central nations sounds like just the right thing.</p> 
               <p>Is the entirety of Season 9 about Taldor and the upcoming <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown">War for the Crown</a>? Far from it, but we will have several scenarios that tell a big Sovereign Court faction story and contribute to this Adventure Path.</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</h2> 
               <p>There are more stories we have in reserve than we have scenario slots to give them, and last year we tried something a little new with the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/acg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>: we began tying its story into that of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and cementing the PCs' role as Pathfinders. For those of you interested in the ongoing Scarab Sages narrative and drama with the Aspis Consortium, I encourage you to play <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season3">Season 3: Season of Plundered Tombs</a>.</p> 
               <p>For the first time, we have a shared season name between these two campaigns, so Season 4 is the Season of Factions' Favor. Here we'll show another side of one of the ongoing plot threads, giving players an opportunity to travel to rarely visited regions in order to thwart an infamous, recurring villain who threatens to cast the Inner Sea region into chaos. So when several upcoming Roleplaying Guild scenarios reference the behind-the-scenes efforts of another group of Pathfinders, remember that you can experience those stories with the Adventure Card Guild.</p> 
               <p>We're launching the Season of Factions' Favor at Gen Con in August!</p>

               <p>One thing was clear when developing factions for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild: some players just want to shoot bug-like aliens. The Exo-Guardians were one of the earliest factions we developed because we wanted players to have a faction with a clear goal that fit into a science fantasy universe. In the case of the Exo-Guardians, that goal is "make sure bad aliens don't punch us in the face, possibly by punching those aliens in the face (or other appropriate body part, in the case of aliens without faces) first." This is the faction that you can regularly expect to see going on a "bug hunt."</p> 
               <p>The Exo-Guardians have some recognizable elements of the highly successful Silver Crusade faction from Pathfinder Society, but there are several key differences. The Exo-Guardians are also a faction with a long history within the in-game Starfinder Society organization, but recent events have not been kind to them. In a setting without paladins as a core class, the Exo-Guardians are somewhat more flexible in terms of what they are willing to do to protect the Pact Worlds from external threats. The Exo-Guardians let us explore some tough questions, like how far would you go to protect your home from external threats?</p>

               <p>Luckily, if you're worried about this faction quickly becoming a faction of bloodthirsty evil characters, the Exo-Guardians faction leader has your back. Zigvigix (LG host shirren soldier) is a shirren with a plan—specifically a plan that aims to have the Exo-Guardians restored to their pre-Scoured Stars incident grandeur. I am already excited at how Zigvigix has turned out in print, and pretty soon you'll be able to meet them in <a href="/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement"><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>. (And if you're worried about pronouncing Zigvigix's name all the time, don't fret. The Commencement's author, Eleanor Ferron, already coined a nickname I think will catch on...)</p> 
               <p>Before I go, here's a look at one of the faction-specific boons that members of the Exo-Guardians can purchase with their Fame. If you haven't already checked, I highly recommend giving that a read over <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljxe?A-Game-of-Boons">last week's blog on Starfinder Society Boons</a>.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">Collector and Examiner (Ally Boon)</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">The Exo-Guardians host a variety of professionals interested in researching alien life from the Vast. You've become associated with one such researcher.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Exo-Guardians: Tier 1</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Cost</b>: 2 Fame</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: This ally boon represents a growing relationship between you and a researcher among the Exo-Guardians. At the end of a scenario in which you've slotted this boon, you can return one, and only one, "mostly intact" cadaver of a defeated significant enemy (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 242) that your ally can study. Mark the creature type (such as aberration, fey, or ooze) of the collected cadaver on your Chronicle sheet. While this boon is slotted, you gain an insight bonus to Engineering, Life Science and Mysticism skill checks to identify creatures of the same creature type as previously collected corpses. The bonus is equal to the number of corpses of that creature type collected, up to a maximum of 3. The bonus represents your access to correspondences between you and your examiner ally; it does not mean the examiner is physically present during the adventure.</p>

               <p>I'm really excited to see exactly what sort of wacky concepts players come up with for their "Examiner" allies!</p> 
               <p>That's all for this week. Stay tuned for next week's blog, where we provide an overview and some details for our next faction: the Second Seekers!</p>

               <p>First, the book was penned by Amber Scott, a long-time contributor for Paizo who devotes as much attention to flavor as rules. Amber's text was a delight to develop. She took a close look at several aquatic races and added innumerable roleplaying touches; for example, the notoriously lawful tritons are often asked to serve as mediators by other aquatic races, many aquatic elves are incorrigible treasure-seekers, and quite a few locathahs like potatoes. She also provided cool race-specific mechanical options for each, including archetypes, feats, and gear. For example, merfolk are deeply connected to musical expression and therefore have new bardic masterpieces and the song-bound oracle curse.</p> 
               <p>In addition, <em>Blood of the Sea</em> provides racial trait lists for races that didn't have them—such as locathahs, sahuagin, tritons, and more. These traits span a wide range to suit many campaign types: locathahs and tritons have the same power level as existing PC races (10 RP and 11 RP, respectively), while other races are slightly more powerful but fit perfectly into an underwater campaign. Like an octopus-person? Yes!</p>

                <h2>Cecaelia Racial Traits (23 RP)</h2> 
                <p>As cecaelias are unusual and powerful monstrous creatures, you should play one only with your GM's permission. Cecaelias normally have racial Hit Dice, skills, and other abilities. PC cecaelias, however, calculate these benefits based solely on their class. Note that these abilities are only an approximation of the cecaelia monster from <a href="/products/btpy8odu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-3"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</em></a> and may not match exactly. PC cecaelias have the following racial traits.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, –2 Intelligence</b>: Cecaelias are nimble and have a canny insight, but they tend to be flighty.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Monstrous Humanoid</b>: Cecaelias are monstrous humanoids with the aquatic subtype.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Medium</b>: Cecaelias are Medium creatures, and they have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Darkvision</b>: Cecaelias have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Tentacle Sense (1 RP)</b>: While swimming and not grappled or grappling, a cecaelia can spread her tentacles wide to form a sensory net around herself as a swift action. This grants blindsight to a range of 10 feet and lasts as long as the cecaelia concentrates or until the cecaelia attacks with a tentacle or moves.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Natural Armor</b>: Cecaelias have a +2 natural armor bonus.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Normal Speed</b>: Cecaelias have no trouble moving about on land using their tentacles and have a base speed of 30 feet.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Swim Speed</b>: Cecaelias have a swim speed of 40 feet.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Jet (1 RP)</b>: Cecaelias can swim 200 feet backward as a full-round action. A cecaelia must move in a straight line when jetting and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she uses jet.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Tentacle Attacks (3 RP)</b>: Cecaelias have two tentacle attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage. These attacks are primary natural attacks and have a reach of 10 feet. This extended reach only applies to the cecaelia's tentacle attacks and not to any other attacks she makes.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Amphibious</b>: Cecaelias are amphibious and can breathe both air and water.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Ink Cloud (3 RP)</b>: Once per hour as a standard action, a cecaelia can emit a 10-foot-radius sphere of ink while underwater. This ink cloud provides total concealment and persists for 1 minute.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Stable Tentacles (4 RP)</b>: Cecaelias cannot be tripped.</p> 
                 <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Languages</b>: Cecaelias begin play speaking Aquan and Common. Cecaelias with a high Intelligence score can choose from the following: Aklo, Celestial, Draconic, Elven, Giant, Gnome, and Halfling.</p>

               <p><em>Blood of the Sea</em> isn't just about aquatic races; it's also extremely useful for land-bound races venturing beneath the waves. You'll find several archetypes, magic items, and spells useful for undersea exploration, such as the tempest tamer archetype (a druid that transforms into air or water elementals rather than animals or plants) and the <i>suspend drowning</i> spell. A useful magic item for PCs with little critters is the <i>familiar bubble</i>. Useful how? Take a look!</p>

                <p class="stat-block">A <i>familiar bubble</i> looks like nothing more than a pair of reinforced leather straps designed to fit over the shoulders—until it is worn. Once the straps are donned, a bubble of force forms on the wearer's back, large enough to hold a Tiny or smaller creature and 1 pound of items (usually food for the creature). The bubble is transparent and continuously generates fresh, breathable air within. While the bubble keeps air in and water out, it is permeable to other objects. Spells and weapons can target the creature in the <i>familiar bubble</i> normally.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">As a standard action, the <i>familiar bubble</i>'s user can designate a specific creature within 30 feet that can pass freely in and out of the bubble. All other living creatures find the bubble impenetrable. This selection remains until the wearer chooses a different creature or removes the <i>familiar bubble</i> (which causes the bubble to disappear). Normally, the user selects a creature in order to get it into the bubble and then selects himself so he can retrieve the creature, if needed.</p>

               <p><em>Blood of the Sea</em> also discusses the roleplaying elements that can confront landwalker PCs, such as why aquatic disguises can be difficult to pull off and why Common is hard to speak underwater. It also discusses the most useful and relevant magic items and spells that already exist. I'll conclude with a personal story: in an adventure path I'm playing, our group needed to embark on a lengthy underwater excursion. While the other players scoured the <a href="/products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a> to see how best to pull it off, I just consulted page 29 of Blood of the Sea and noted that cloaks of the manta ray were probably our cheapest effective option, and that we should carry back-up potions of water breathing as well. Useful advice! The journey went well, although my hobgoblin druid was slain by our party's oread monk who had been dominated by—whoops, spoilers. But any way you look at it, <a href="/products/btpy9trg?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Sea"><em>Blood of the Sea</em></a> brings new depths to underwater adventuring!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Altronus Barasul Dovenayan was born into House Holdare, a traditional and respected family on the kasatha generation-ship-turned-homeland <i>Idari</i>. The Holdare trace their lineage to Great Families already well respected when the <i>Idari</i> left Kasath for their centuries-long trip to the Pact Worlds, and have maintained strong connections with both the houses that rose to prominence on the ship while crew functions were paramount, and younger houses risen to prominence since the <i>Idari</i> became an enormous space station. Much of the influence of House Holdare comes from their renown for producing skilled adata—scholar-priests who oversee the removal and preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasatha in technomagical temples called <i>adats</i>. Even in times when ships officers, pilots, and navigators find their social relevance waning, the adata remain highly respected in kasatha society. </p> 
                <p>The eldest living member of House Holdare, Barasul Naedarin Allar of Clan Allar, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts and doyen of the ship's adata, took a special interest in Altronus shortly after his birth, though he was but a distant nephew to her. Of course the attention of so great a clan elder comes with more responsibility and expectation than comfort, and though Altronus was raised with significant prestige and resources as a youth, he was also pushed to begin adata training very early, his family even going so far as to name him after famous adata doyens.</p> 
                <p>While Altronus did not excel at his studies the way his family had hoped, neither did he do poorly, and most people chalked his merely adequate results up to his relative youth. In truth, Altronus was indeed an excellent scholar, simply one who had trouble focusing on a single topic for long. Inevitably, some interesting fact in his studies would pique his interest and draw his research off into unrelated sidetracks. This broad, self-directed education made him adept at making connections between disparate fields, yet earned him little love from traditionalist teachers who saw his scattered studies as a failure to focus and a deliberate rejection of tried-and-true scholarly practices.</p> 
                <p>Though his close family were dedicated worshipers of Talavet, the Storyteller deity, one of Altronus's more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could be better brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, which teaches that existence is an endless, connected series of events as stars are born, die, and born again. Though the Cycle is the guiding philosophy of the solarians, contemplative warriors with a tradition stretching far back into the history of Kasath, it's also seen as a useful tool for training body and mind in preparation for the rigors of other vocations. </p> 
                <p>Altronus was accepted as a student into a prestigious cosmonastery on the <i>Idari</i>, and taught to focus his thoughts on the forces of the universe around him, to draw strength and guidance from the endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training immediately, and soon was among the most advanced students, most of whom sought not just to understand the lessons of the Cycle, but to embody them in the path of the solarian. Altronus, however, was still slated for a career as an adata. This preordained path didn't bother him—as he approached adulthood and the yearlong ritual walkabout of the Tempering, he was allowed to take on guard shifts at the ship's famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms of stasis pods where adata connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of memories from archived kasatha brains could be experienced, sorted, and analyzed. On rare occasions, he was even allowed to experience ancient Sensorium memories himself, and it was these glimpses of lives and secrets long lost that most drove Altronus to complete his studies and become a full adata.</p> 
                <p>During one of his last scheduled shifts as an adata student, Altronus was assigned to an inactive Sensorium access node—one rarely used, but like all Sensorium access points still important enough to be protected by force fields and a round-the-clock guard. Though most such shifts were uneventful, on that night Altronus was surprised by the appearance of a fully cloaked and apparently rushed senior adata, Remura Esolla Kaiban of Clan Senthen, flashing a warrant to allow unscheduled access to the memory of a recently deceased citizen. Thanks to his tendency to collect trivia, Altronus knew Remura was scheduled to be giving a lecture at the far end of the <i>Idari</i>. What, he wondered, could be of such great importance that the revered adat would end the lecture early, not to mention need an emergency Sensorium warrant? </p> 
                <p>Altronus knew he should mind his own business, but again curiosity overrode his training. Altronus contacted a friend at the far end of the ship, who informed him that not only had Adata Kaiban not left the lecture early—she was still on the stage.</p> 
                <p>Immediately Altronus sounded an intruder alert, and rushed into the Sensorium access node to confront the false adata. To his surprise, Altronus discovered not a kasatha, but a small, sickly gray humanoid standing in a pile of robes and strange machinery, with long wires and humming crystals latched onto the Sensorium feed and hundreds of images flashing from the access node to the gray creature's alien devices. Altronus leapt to activate the Sensorium emergency disconnect, but the bulbous creature struck him with a taclash, ripping the pulsecaster from his grip, then shot him with a pistol that fired a searing green ray. Through the resulting haze of pain, Altronus managed to seal the access node's security force fields, trapping himself and the gray intruder inside.</p> 
                <p>With a shock, Altronus realized the severity of the situation. Any response to his alarm would take precious moments to arrive, and still more to disable the force field. Unarmed, Altronus had little chance of holding the intruder at bay. He had no way of healing the wound from the creature's pistol. For the first time in his life, Altronus truly confronted the fact that he was going to die. Like the stars themselves, he too would be extinguished, his body breaking down and eventually being reincorporated over millennia into new entities, new worlds, new stars. At last, he truly understood the Cycle. With his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it.</p> 
                <p>And the universe answered.</p> 
                <p>Altronus was as surprised as the strange gray alien to find a long, shining golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower right forearm. Yet he had seen enough of solarian training to recognize the blade of stellar energy for what it was, and leapt to put it to use, placing himself between the creature and the node's access panels. The two fought in grim silence, and though it was clear the gray invader was the more skilled, Altronus stood his ground, putting to use every scrap of training he'd gained. He didn't need to win—only buy time, keeping the creature from finishing its infiltration of the Sensorium until help arrived.</p> 
                <p>Blow after blow fell upon Altronus, and the pistol's strange green rays continued to singe and scale his flesh, but Altronus would not fall. His blade scored many fewer hits, and at times seemed to pass cleanly through his foe to no effect, but he pressed the attack as best he could. As he did, a fierce joy welled up in him, a sense of the rightness of the path that had led him to this moment. This cosmic contentment continued to expand until he had no choice but to release it, unleashing a burst of searing stellar flame in all direction.</p> 
                <p>At last, ship security arrived, using their command bypasses to deactivate the access node's force fields and dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Yet upon seeing that it was outnumbered, the bulbous-headed alien didn't continue to fight, or attempt to escape. Rather, it paused to take stock of the situation, toggled a device on its arm—and detonated its own head like a bomb.</p> 
                <p>The security team secured the body and questioned Altronus. When several true adata arrived, they immediately attempted to preserve part of the horrid gray thing's exploded brain. While their efforts to pull meaning from the splatter were greatly hindered, two ideas were recovered. The first was that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds. The second was that the time of something important called "Phase Three" was coming soon.</p> 
                <p>The Doyenate of the Idari was informed, and additional security added to Sensorium access nodes. While the matter of gray infiltrators was officially left open to investigation, with no more solid leads and no further incidents, official attention quickly turned elsewhere.</p> 
                <p>But Altronus couldn't let the issue lie.</p> 
                <p>Questions filled his mind. How thoroughly had grays infiltrated the Pact Worlds? Had they successfully infiltrated the <i>Idari</i>? What did this gray seek to learn from the Sensorium? Why had it sought to destroy its own brain when capture became inevitable? And, most importantly, what was Phase Three, and how soon would it arrive? Altronus tried to quiet his mind with further solarian training, but while his powers grew, his sense of calm did not.</p> 
                <p>As it came time for Altronus to begin his Tempering, he realized he could never accept a role as an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung over him. He sought, and received, approval from his house doyen to abandon the path he had long trod, and informed his family that he was leaving the <i>Idari</i>. He had no firm idea of where he would go, nor how his investigation would advance, only a vow to chase down every strange occurrence that might mark a potential gray incursion within the Pact Worlds. While many of these events had other—sometimes equally strange—explanations, he found enough potential connections to the grays to support his growing suspicion that secret conspiracies indeed existed just out of sight. Still a rigorous scholar, he began to accept that he'd need to give more credence to outrageous claims and unlikely stories if he ever wanted to uncover the truth.</p> 
                <p>Now inarguably an adult, Altronus has nevertheless remained on his Tempering for much longer than the traditional year, and still sees himself as working to form the traditions that will guide him through his later life. He often signs on with freelancers and adventuring companies as a guard, scout, or researcher in order to support himself—especially if their activities align with his obsession—yet his primary goal always remains researching the shadowy web of plots he first glimpsed that night in the access node. Ironically, while he comes across to many kasatha as overly impetuous and offbeat, his natural kasatha love of traditions, his devotion to the Cycle, and his scholar's desire to monologue about admittedly unconventional research often causes members of other races to see him as an eccentric professor or addled conspiracy theorist. Any skepticism as to his usefulness, however, disappears in the first firefight, as Altronus launches himself into the fray and "lets the cosmos take control," slicing through hordes of enemies with terrifying calm.</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Gods are undeniable entities of immense power and in Starfinder, religion provides a measure of assurance that one will be taken care of in the afterlife. The people of the Pact Worlds venerate a multitude of gods and goddesses, but there are 20 deities who are widely worshiped throughout the system—the "core deities" of the Starfinder setting. We've revealed details on 13 of Starfinder's "core 20" gods so far (check the links at the bottom of this post if you missed one of the earlier previews)—now it's time to show off the rest!</p> 
               <p>First, let's look at some more deities who were worshiped on lost Golarion, and who remain popular in the Pact Worlds millennia later.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <div class="blurb180">
                 <a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Desna.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Desna_180.jpeg"></a>
                </div> 
                <h3>Abadar</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>LN god of civilization, commerce, law, and wealth</i></p> 
                <p>The Master of the First Vault is dedicated to spreading civilization, free trade, and the rule of law across the Material Plane, and his church, AbadarCorp, is one of the most powerful corporations in the Pact Worlds.</p> 
                <h3>Besmara</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>CN goddess of piracy, space monsters, and strife</i></p> 
                <p>Once a minor nautical deity, Besmara seized her current power and position as her prize when she deposed another deity in a daring raid during the Gap.</p> 
                <h3>Desna</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>CG goddess of dreams, luck, stars, and travelers</i></p> 
                <p>Desna and her faith have changed little since the pre-Gap era. The Song of the Spheres encourages her followers to believe in themselves, indulge their desires, experience all they can, express their inner strengths, and trust their instincts.</p> 
                <h3>Urgathoa</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>NE goddess of disease, gluttony, and undeath</i></p> 
                <p>Urgathoa's faith is shunned, if not outright banned, on most civilized worlds, but the undead inhabitants of Eox openly worship the Pallid Princess, who is said to be the universe's first undead creature.</p> 
                <h3>Nyarlathotep</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>CE Outer God of conspiracies, dangerous secrets, and forbidden magic</i></p> 
                <p>Said to possess a thousand different forms, the Crawling Chaos is an Outer God and the prime mover in preparing countless worlds for the devastating return of the Great Old Ones.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Finally, let's look at two more of Starfinder's new gods, also widely worshiped throughout the Pact Worlds: Damoritosh the Conqueror and Ibra the Inscrutable.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <div class="blurb360" style="width: 220px;">
                 <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Damoritosh.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Damoritosh_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Ibra.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Ibra_360.jpeg" style="width: 220px; height: 177px;"></a> 
                </div> 
                <h3>Damoritosh, The Conqueror</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>LE god of conquest, duty, and war</i></p> 
                <p>Damoritosh is the primary patron god of the vesk, but the Conqueror's faith has spread throughout the Pact Worlds to mercenaries, soldiers, and warriors of all species. The vesk have always been a race of warriors and conquerors, and Damoritosh remains a pillar of vesk society. To them, war and conquest are woven into the fabric of the universe. One can choose to embrace this truth and secure a place in history with one's triumphs, or one can deny it and die a coward's death, scorned and forgotten. War requires sacrifice, however, and it is the duty of everyone in society to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to propel one's species—or culture, empire, kingdom, or world—to victory.</p> 
                <p>Damoritosh is a harsh deity, with no concern for freedom or comfort. The Conqueror demands soldier-like obedience from all who seek his blessing and pushes his followers to strive for victory at all costs. Courage is an admirable trait, as is a militaristic sense of honor and oath keeping, but the will to fight and the drive to win are far more important than such noble ideals as bravery or heroism. Damoritosh is uninterested in diplomacy, as force and military prowess can win far greater rewards in a shorter amount of time, but he also encourages the acceptance of a foe's honorable surrender to avoid wasting lives for no additional gain.</p> 
                <h3>Ibra, The Inscrutable</h3> 
                <p class="collapse"><i>N god of celestial bodies, the cosmos, and mysteries of the universe</i></p> 
                <p>The universe is a vast expanse of wonders. Ibra is a god of these marvels—distant galaxies, misty nebulae, all the spinning worlds that orbit countless suns, and the empty void that stretches between them. Science can explain all of these and more, but the magnificence of the cosmos knows no bounds, and there are always new miracles and mysteries waiting to be discovered, explored, and explained. Ibra itself is one of these cosmic enigmas. No one in the Pact Worlds knows what species first venerated Ibra as a god. It has no gender or defined physical form, and it's unclear whether Ibra is a deity who sprang into being when the universe as born, some alien paragon who ascended to godhood, or a personification of the cosmos itself.</p> 
                <p>Ibra's followers believe that one can find truth, serenity, and meaning in the beauty of the cosmos, but it is up to the individual to decipher the universe's secrets to discover these rewards. It is not Ibra's place to reveal the answers to creation's great questions, and the Inscrutable rewards those who push the boundaries of knowledge and science to explore the universe and bring its wonders to light. To Ibra, there is no law or chaos, no good or evil: only the questions raised by the shining light of a newborn star, the beautiful dance of heavenly bodies, and the perfect solitude of the comet as it hurtles through the dark, regardless of whether the answers to those questions are ever found.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>And that wraps up the 20 core gods of Starfinder. But while these deities may be the most ubiquitous in the Pact Worlds, every culture has its own gods, traditions, and philosophies, each with their own widespread followings.

              <p class="date">Friday, July 7, 2017</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>So let's just put it out there: Like many RPGs set in a universe with advanced technology, Starfinder has rules for computers, and hacking computers. And, like nearly all RPGs that do so, these rules aren't grounded in reality.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">There are lots of good reasons for this, ranging from no one working on the game being an accredited IT security expert, to real-world computer issues often being slow, boring, and not the sort of thing we particularly want to have Starfinder stories focus on.

               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Laptop.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Laptop_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>So, here are there basics. There is a Computers skill, which at its most basic is defined as the ability to operate, manipulate, and hack into computer systems. It's Intelligence based, cannot be used untrained (though there is an exception), and is a class skill for envoys, mechanics, operatives and technomancers. If you have access to a computer system's physical interface, you don't need any other tools, but if not you need a hacking kit to attempt to interact with a system.</p> 
               <p>If a computer is unsecured, a DC 10 Computers check allows you to use its most basic functions, and unlike other Computers skill tasks this can be done untrained if you take 20, so normally it isn't an issue unless you're in a hurry. If a computer is secured, there are tasks you can perform with the skill, all of which are built around defining computers with tiers, modules, and systems.</p> 
               <p>Computers themselves are defined in their own section in the equipment chapter. In general, a computer has an item level equal to double its tier. A tier 1 computer might be something as simple as a common datapad, while a tier 10 computer may be running an entire space station or handling major systems for a large company. Beyond its tier, a computer is defined by its size, user interface, access and authorization, basic function, modules (which define what the computer can do or control beyond its basic functions, and may include controlling other devices or computers), and countermeasures.</p> 
               <p>Computers skill checks have DCs based on the tier and countermeasures of the computer they are applied to, and generally take one round per tier of the computer. If you hack a computer and beat the DC to do so by 20, you gain root access, and can use the computer with no further checks. (And if you buy or build a computer, it comes with root access for you.) Otherwise, each module or system you attempt to manipulate requires its own check. As might be expected, there are various modifiers, special abilities, and tool kits that can affect this base system, but at its core the Computers skill allows a character to at least attempt anything software- or hardware-related that an adventuring character is likely to need to deal with.</p> 
               <p>The rules for computers also allow players to design and buy or build their own. Most starships are also assumed to have a computer with a tier equal to half the starship's tier, which can also be upgraded to help operate various ship systems. A computer can have upgrades or countermeasures installed to grant it new capabilities, make it more resistant to hacking, increase its battery life, and so on. Below is a preview of part of one common upgrade, the artificial personality.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h3>Artificial Personality</h3> 
                <p><i>An artificial personality is a program designed to allow a computer to hold conversations in plain language with both users and creatures that lack access. Such computers are often given a name and are capable of parsing expressions, slang, social cues, tone of voice, and similar elements beyond a literal understanding of spoken or written words. They can respond appropriately through algorithms and lists of billions of known phrases and expressions, developed by programmers over centuries to allow for extremely natural-sounding conversations. Such computers can even display what appear to be emotions and insights. However, unlike androids, computers with artificial personalities have not attained true consciousness. The ability of an artificial personality to hold a conversation, learn names and habits, and even give advice is based purely on its complex code and extensive lexicons.</i></p>

               <p>What kind of fantasy maze would it be, if it didn't have minotaurs? We have three of them in <em>Maze of Death</em>. First, is the large uncommon minotaur artillery, because if you get hit by a large heavy crossbow bolt, it doesn't feel like a bolt, it feels like a ballista.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Next, we have the minotaur cleric, hail Baphomet! 'Cause what is worse than a Minotaur with a crossbow? One that can cast <i>flame strike</i>, or <i>bestow curse</i> with reach. Just sayin'. This minotaur cleric is also a large uncommon.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>To wrap us up this week, we have one of my favorite miniatures in the set, the minotaur labyrinth guardian. Thats right folks: we made a miniature of a minotaur "graveknight." This imposing (and incredibly metal) foe is a large rare.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>All three of the minotaur figures in <em>Maze of Death</em> are based off of artwork found in <a href="/products/btpy8v2x?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Bestiary"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary</em></a>, and are stated up inside.</p> 
               <p>Next week we take a quick side-trek to look at <a href="/products/btpy9u0z?Pathfinder-Battles-Iconic-Heroes-Set-7"><em>Iconic Heroes Set #7</em></a>, featuring occult iconic characters, and also releasing this fall. We'll then resume our journey through the <a href="/products/btpy9u16?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death"><em>Maze of Death</em></a> with imposing plantlife and aquatic foes!</p>

               <p>Haven't heard of Owlcat Games? Lisa took to email just a couple weeks ago to talk about our new partnership and the current Kickstarter project.</p>

                <div style="float: right; padding: 0 0 0 15px;"> <a href="http://kck.st/2sOJBBx"> <img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Marketing/20170608-PFKTroll.jpg" style="border: 0;"></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Since we launched the world of Golarion and the Pathfinder RPG, I have eagerly awaited the day when I could announce a single-player computer RPG based on our game and world. Many companies have approached me over the years, but the fit was never quite right.</p> 
                <p>Last year, our friends at Obsidian connected us to the folks at Owlcat Games, who had some interesting ideas for a Kingmaker CRPG. Owlcat wanted to meet us at Gen Con and show us what they had in mind. I was expecting maybe a Powerpoint presentation, but they brought a work in progress. To say I was blown away was an understatement. They had clearly put a lot of time, effort, and thought into everything—and we hadn't even signed a deal yet! I ran around the convention finding various Paizo employees to look at it, and everyone got super excited. We started work on a licensing deal right away.</p> 
                <p>A couple months ago, Owlcat came to the Paizo offices to show us a vertical slice of <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>. A vertical slice is a small segment of how the finished game is going to look and play. We were all mesmerized playing the game, which was filled with a ton of familiar Golarion hooks in the artwork and mechanics. A lucky few of you at PaizoCon 2017 had the opportunity to play through a similar vertical slice, and all the feedback we received was super positive.</p> 
                <p>I need to tell you a little bit about Owlcat Games. They're a new development studio, but don't take that to mean they're inexperienced! Some of them have been together for more than a decade, and the list of games they've helped create is strong. They have the backing of one of the largest game companies around, so you don't need to worry about their stability. And you definitely don't need to worry about their enthusiasm for Pathfinder—they're longtime gamers, and have several different tabletop Pathfinder campaigns running in their office. They know the setting, the story, and the rules as well as anyone. And they've been joined by CRPG legend Chris Avellone, who is infusing his touch of story genius into our now-classic Adventure Path.</p> 
                <p>Owlcat Games has the full backing of their parent company to make the game to the specifications that we had approved, but they have a lot of great ideas beyond that spec, so they decided to launch a Kickstarter that's all about making it bigger and more awesome—more sidequests, more companions, more options, more <i>depth</i>.</p> 
                <p>A great Pathfinder computer RPG is something that I have personally waited a decade for, and I couldn't be more excited to see it come to fruition.</p>

               <p>The kickstarter is headed towards it's next stretch goal at $700K, where a new chapter to reveal hidden secrets of original Kingmaker story will be added, as well as support for <b><i>both Mac and Linux</i></b>.

               <p class="tiny">*Paizo staff attending this convention.</p> 
               <p>On the topic of conventions; if you missed PaizoCon 2017, the awesome folks at Know Direction recorded the panels and banquet and made them available for download. <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/convention-podcasts/" target="_blank">Check here for all available topics!</a></p> 
               <p>Also convention related—we are still looking for volunteers for Gen Con 50! Most of our vacancies are for GMs to run games (Starfinder and Pathfinder), but we may have other places open up before the event starts on August 17th. A summary of the Gen Con volunteer experience is January 30th's <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljif?A-Call-to-VolHow-to-Volunteer-for-Organized">"A Call to Vol" blog</a>. Directions for volunteering are at the bottom of the blog.</p> 
               <p>The Gen Con leads and I working to open more Starfinder Society tables at Gen Con and hope to coordinate our efforts with the Gen Con events staff early next week. Keep an eye on the Gen Con catalog for more information.</p> 
               <p>Check back to the blog often, as we have lots of information to impart before the launch of the next organized play seasons at Gen Con 50. The team is pulling together to complete all the tasks needed to run our portion of the Best 4 Days in Gaming! 38 days and counting, which means I need to get back to work.</p> 
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>
