  \ Society, Paizo's Newest Organized Play Program</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\
  \ March 8, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Immediately after the announcement of the <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game</a> last <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>, our community started speculating\
  \ about an organized play program to support the new game. We spent the ensuing\
  \ months looking at workflow and charting out a course that would enable us to have\
  \ both Starfinder and Pathfinder organized play programs. It delights me to end\
  \ speculation and announce the launch of <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder\
  \ Society</a> at Gen Con 50!</p> \n    <p>Introducing the Starfinder Society logo,\
  \ designed by the talented Sarah Robinson! </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/starfindersociety\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/StarfinderSociety_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Before the questions flood in, I want to note that we\
  \ are still in the active planning phase, and may not have answers to everything\
  \ yet. Over the next few months, the team will release more information via blog,\
  \ podcast, and forum posts. If you have questions, please put yours in the comments\
  \ section, and we will work to get them answered.</p> \n    <h3>Who is working on\
  \ Starfinder Society?</h3> \n    <p>The structure is very similar to the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild. Tonya Woldridge will oversee the program, with John\
  \ Compton taking on the role of lead developer of both the Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ organized play campaigns. Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer will continue to focus\
  \ on Pathfinder Society. We've added Thurston Hillman to the team as the dedicated\
  \ developer for Starfinder Society. Thurston has been a part of Pathfinder Society\
  \ since Season 1, when he authored <a href=\"/products/btpy8g53?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-55-The-Infernal-Vault\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #55:The Infernal Vault</em></a>. Since then, he's\
  \ both contributed many scenarios (and special events) to the Pathfinder Society\
  \ as well as writing regularly for various other Pathfinder RPG lines. Thurston\
  \ brings his depth of experience to the team, along with a bit of zany humor.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Is it going to be called \"Starfinder Society?\"</h3> \n    <p>The official\
  \ name is Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, or SFSRPG for short. The Starfinder\
  \ game takes place in the distant future of the Pathfinder world, and while much\
  \ has changed (or been forgotten), the Starfinder Society traces its mysterious\
  \ history back to the Pathfinder Society of present day. The campaign's official\
  \ name reflects this connection.</p> \n    <h3>Are you making two separate organized\
  \ play programs?</h3> \n    <p>Yes. Although many similarities exist in structure\
  \ and format, including a shared volunteer team, they are two separate campaigns\
  \ with different rules, documentation, and characters.</p> \n    <h3>Do I get to\
  \ keep my same Pathfinder Society number?</h3> \n    <p>Yes. What was your Pathfinder\
  \ Society number will now be your number for all three of the Paizo-operated organized\
  \ play programs: Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild, and Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. Starfinder character numbers\
  \ will have a unique starting number, most likely 700, making your first Starfinder\
  \ character XXX-701. The number 700 works really well for this, not only because\
  \ it leaves space for plenty of Pathfinder Society roleplaying characters, but also\
  \ because the PZO number (the number we assign to each of our products) begins with\
  \ 7. Who knows, this bit of trivia may make it in to the PaizoCon quiz.</p> \n \
  \   <h3>How much is staying the same from Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild?</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>We still have quests and scenarios with Chronicle sheets. Adventures\
  \ will be broken into tiers, grant XP, and provide other rewards. Three experience\
  \ points (XP) grant a level. There are fairly cooperative factions within the Starfinder\
  \ Society, based on their worldview and goals. We will reveal more information about\
  \ the campaign as we get closer to its launch in August 2017.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ all that is the same, what is different?</h3> \n    <p>Starship combat!</p> \n\
  \    <p>On a more serious note, we made a couple major changes for Starfinder Society.\
  \ The first is the tier system. We are closing the gap between subtiers that resulted\
  \ in so much confusion and consternation with calculating average party level (APL).\
  \ Starfinder scenarios will include the following tiers: Tier 1-2, Tier 1-4, Tier\
  \ 3-6, Tier 5-8, Tier 7-10, and Tier 9-12—perhaps more as higher-level play grows\
  \ in popularity.</p> \n    <p>The second most noticeable change is that characters\
  \ have a means of belonging to more than one faction at a time. Unlike the current\
  \ Pathfinder Society faction rules, Starfinder Society characters will be able to\
  \ gain favor with multiple groups, choosing which they want to champion on a scenario-by-scenario\
  \ basis. But just like multiclassing, focusing on several groups won't see the same\
  \ benefits as focusing on a primary faction. These changes to the faction system\
  \ tie in with another issue that we are addressing: the handling of boons. One of\
  \ our goals is developing a way to make the boons on Chronicles more relevant, and\
  \ not just a stack of paper player's stick in the back of their folder. We'll reveal\
  \ more about these changes in... the future (see what I did there?)</p> \n    <h3>What\
  \ is the release schedule?</h3> \n    <p>The Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild\
  \ launches with 3 scenarios, 1 pre-generated character special, and 1 quest pack\
  \ at Gen Con. From there, we will publish one scenario a month. Moving to a slower\
  \ release schedule allows us to spin up the program and settle into the groove of\
  \ running three organized play programs. During this time, we will solicit feedback\
  \ and assess the rate of publication for 2018 and beyond.</p> \n    <h3>When can\
  \ I start playing Starfinder Society?</h3> \n    <p>The fun begins Thursday, August\
  \ 17th, at 8:00 AM Pacific time in the Sagamore Ballroom at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a>. After Thursday morning, anyone, anytime, anywhere,\
  \ may schedule Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild events.</p> \n    <p>Next week\
  \ sees John holding down the fort while I travel to the GAMA Trade Show in Las Vegas\
  \ to chat with retailers about our organized play programs. The following Wednesday,\
  \ March 22, at 7 pm PDT, John, Thurston, and I join the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction</a> crew for a Question and Answer session about\
  \ all things organized play related. If you have topics you wish us to cover, feel\
  \ free to drop me an email at <a href=\"mailto:tonya.woldridge@paizo.com\">tonya.woldridge@paizo.com</a>\
  \ and we will fit as many answers on the show as possible.</p> \n    <p>Check out\
  \ the blog next Monday for more exciting organized play news!</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized\
