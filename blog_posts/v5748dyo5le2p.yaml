  date\">Thursday, November 22, 2012</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: NPC Codex</i></a> is a first for Paizo—a 320-page\
  \ Bestiary-style book full of NPC stat blocks instead of monsters. We’ve asked designer/developer\
  \ Sean K Reynolds to answer some questions about this latest release for the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG, and why <i>NPC Codex</i> is a must for your Pathfinder game.</p> \n   <p><b>Why\
  \ should I get <i>NPC Codex</i>?</b></p> \n   <p>The <i>NPC Codex</i> can save you\
  \ time. If you're a GM, prepping stat blocks for a game takes a lot of work, and\
  \ <i>NPC Codex</i> has full stat blocks for over 300 NPCs. That's 20 of each of\
  \ the core character classes (cleric, fighter, and so on), 4 of each of the prestige\
  \ classes, and 10 of each of the NPC classes (adept, commoner, and so on), all ready\
  \ to drop into your game with no prep required. Appendix 1 has 45 animal companion\
  \ stat blocks for various companions at different druid levels. Appendix 2 has 7\
  \ pages of themed encounter groups (such as \"barbarian warband\" and \"pirate crew\"\
  ) at low, medium, and high levels, telling you exactly which NPC stat blocks you\
  \ should use to build that encounter.</p> \n   <p>If you're a player, you can use\
  \ those NPC stat blocks for cohorts or followers. If you're playing a druid or a\
  \ ranger, you can use the animal companion stat blocks from Appendix 2 for your\
  \ animal companion. If you need a character for a pick-up game, <i>NPC Codex</i>\
  \ includes three stat blocks for each of Paizo's iconic characters (at level 1,\
  \ 7, and 13).</p> \n   <p><b>What books does <i>NPC Codex</i> use?</b></p> \n  \
  \ <p>The <i>NPC Codex</i> uses classes, races, feats, spells, and magic items from\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i></a>. A\
  \ few of the animal companion stat blocks use monster feats from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>, such as Improved Natural\
  \ Attack or Multiattack.</p> \n   <p><b>Why doesn't it use options from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> and other Paizo sourcebooks?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>The Core Rulebook gives you many options, and we wanted to demonstrate\
  \ that you can use those options to create hundreds of unique, interesting characters.\
  \ By just using the Core Rulebook, <i>NPC Codex</i> allows players who don't own\
  \ any other books to get full use out of it, and players who do use the APG and\
  \ so on are still able to swap in feats, spells, and items from those other books.\
  \ We are looking forward to the opportunity to publish a similar book using the\
  \ APG character classes, archetypes from <a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i></a>, and so on.</p> \n   <p><b>Are these NPCs generic, or are they unique\
  \ characters?</b></p> \n   <p>There is a mix of both. Each NPC is presented with\
  \ a generic role, such as \"fire cleric.\" As each page has a stat block, full-body\
  \ illustration, and tactics for the character, some NPCs (especially spellcasters\
  \ with long stat blocks) only have a few lines left for personal information. Whenever\
  \ there was room, we gave the NPC a specific name, background, goals, and suggestions\
  \ for using the NPC in a combat encounter and roleplaying encounter. For example,\
  \ after the \"fire cleric\" stat block is information about Aleksion Coric, who\
  \ uses the flame of truth to burn away impurity and rebellion.</p> \n   <p>Of course,\
  \ if you just need a stat block and not a character concept, you can replace that\
  \ descriptive text with something more appropriate to your campaign.</p> \n   <p><b>How\
  \ easily can I fit these NPCs into my game?</b></p> \n   <p>We wanted to give you\
  \ many standard options for each character class, but also to give you some unusual\
  \ characters that may have a unique role in your campaign. In general, every other\
  \ character for each of the base classes is a typical representative of that class.\
  \ For example, the 1st-level wizard is a typical adventuring mage and the 3rd-level\
  \ wizard is a mercenary universalist, but the 2nd-level wizard is a street magician\
  \ enchanter and the 4th-level wizard is a diviner working as a private investigator.\
  \ By giving you a \"normal\" member of that class at every other level, at most\
  \ you're only one CR away from what you need for an encounter.</p> \n   <p>Chapter\
  \ 3 presents characters of levels 1–10 for each of the five NPC classes. If you\
  \ need a stat block for a simple beggar, pig farmer, shopkeeper, sailor, carpenter,\
  \ guard, squire, or similar non-adventuring characters, this chapter has it covered.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Are the stat blocks customizable?</b></p> \n   <p>Completely! If you\
  \ want the dwarf mountaineer (ranger 7) to use a battleaxe instead of a warhammer,\
  \ just swap the weapon and keep playing. If you want the sylvan protector (druid\
  \ 3) to have an animal companion instead of the Air domain, grab an animal companion\
  \ stat block from Appendix 2 and you're good to go. If you're willing to do a little\
  \ more leg work, you can even change the NPC's race or add an archetype. The purpose\
  \ of <i>NPC Codex</i> is to give you complete stat blocks you can use right out\
  \ of the book, but if you like to tinker, go for it.</p> \n   <p><b>Is there new\
  \ art?</b></p> \n   <p>Of course! Just like the Bestiary, every page of NPCs has\
  \ a full-body illustration from Paizo artist favorites such as Chris Seaman, Tyler\
  \ Walpole, Scott Purdy, and Roberto Pitturu.</p> \n   <p align=\"center\"><b>The\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: NPC Codex</i></a>\
  \ is now available<br>for purchase at paizo.com, and at your local game store!</b></p>\
