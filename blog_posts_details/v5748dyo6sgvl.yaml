  alt: "Elfbane Hobgoblin. Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable\
    \ and fecund goblins, to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves\
    \ ultimately freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral\
    \ resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist\
    \ Elf Magic reaction. RESIST ELF MAGIC (reaction). Trigger: You attempt a saving\
    \ throw against a magical effect but haven’t rolled yet. Your ancestral resistance\
    \ to magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving\
    \ throw. If the triggering effect is arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus\
    \ instead."
