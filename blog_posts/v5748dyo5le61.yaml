  \ Around</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 4, 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Late last week, we posted\
  \ up a few quick FAQ issues to resolve some problems involving the monk. There has\
  \ been a lot of discussion on the monk on the boards, and while it has taken us\
  \ a while to come up with some solutions, we have made a few simple changes to address\
  \ these concerns. I wanted to take this blog post to review these changes and to\
  \ announce a few more.</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/CrimsonThrone/PZO9009-Monk_500.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/CrimsonThrone/PZO9009-Monk_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Flurry of Blows:</i>\
  \ We have decided to reverse a previous ruling (that came from this very blog) that\
  \ stated you needed to use two weapons when using flurry of blows (or a combination\
  \ of weapon attacks and unarmed strikes). You can now make all of your attacks with\
  \ just one weapon, or substitute any number of these attacks with an unarmed strike.\
  \ Of course, if you have a pair of weapons and want to keep using both of them,\
  \ that still works as well.</p> \n     <p><i>Ki Pool:</i> Monks typically have problems\
  \ bypassing DR with their unarmed strikes, forcing them to rely on weapons to deal\
  \ with many forms of DR. We have decided to add a new ability to the <i>Ki Pool</i>\
  \ monk class feature. At 7th level, a monk's unarmed strikes count as cold iron\
  \ and silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, so long as he has\
  \ at least 1 point remaining in his <i>ki pool</i>.</p> \n     <p><i>Amulet of Mighty\
  \ Fists:</i> On Friday, we posted up a FAQ that stated that the enhancement bonus\
  \ from an amulet of mighty fists does allow natural attacks and unarmed strikes\
  \ to bypass damage reduction if the enhancement bonus is at least +3 (as with other\
  \ weapons, see page 562 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). In addition, we have decided\
  \ to adjust the price of the <i>amulet of mighty fists</i>. The new prices are as\
  \ follows: 4,000 gp (+1), 16,000 gp (+2), 36,000 gp (+3), 64,000 gp (+4), 100,000\
  \ gp (+5). Accordingly, the costs to create these amulets are also reduced to the\
  \ following: 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), 50,000\
  \ gp (+5). This makes this item priced a bit more competitively for monks and creatures\
  \ that rely on natural attacks. I should note that this change will be reflected\
  \ in future printings of the <i>Core Rulebook, Ultimate Equipment</i>, and the <i>NPC\
  \ Codex</i>.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Well, that about wraps up our current\
  \ thoughts on the monk. Thanks to all the folks on the boards that provided us with\
  \ feedback on this class.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p>\
