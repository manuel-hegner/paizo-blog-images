  artist: "his work. In addition, while roleplaying games have frequently spawned\
    \ successful fiction in the past, Jordan was one of the few authors to go the\
    \ other direction, and whose private world went on to become a game in and of\
    \ itself, with a full-on Wheel of Time d20 book (the first adventure for which\
    \ can be found here). His work even made its way into Dragon, with articles in\
    \ our d20 special issue detailing new hero templates and 26 new d20 monsters"
