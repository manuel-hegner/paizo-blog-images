  \ in the United States, and all of us here at Paizo want to take time to uplift\
  \ and appreciate some of the women who bring our games to your tables!</p>\n   \
  \   <p>It’d be silly not to mention that our CEO and Founder, Lisa Stevens, is a\
  \ prominent woman in the TTRPG community and has been a cornerstone of Paizo since\
  \ the beginning. You can enjoy some of her stories about her time working in games\

  \ some more of the phenomenal women who make Paizo’s worlds better and brighter!\
  \ As the theme of this year’s Women’s History Month is “Advocating for Diversity,\
  \ Equity, and Inclusion”, we’re also celebrating the work these people do in those\

  \   <h3>Caryn DiMarco, she/they</h3>\n      <p>You may have seen my name on PFS\
  \ scenarios or in Lost Omens Highhelm—or on some soon-to-be-released products! I\
  \ am so proud of this achievement, but when I'm not writing for Pathfinder, I obviously\
  \ do play a lot of Pathfinder. This includes Pathfinder Society (forever GMs unite)\
  \ and one question that's always on my mind is how to make sure every player feels\
  \ welcome at our games.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><br>\n       I've been at a lot of tables\
  \ where I'm the only member of a certain group, and that's never a fun situation\
  \ to be in. But often it's the only way to get more people to show up. I want to\
  \ thank everyone who's signed up for a table or showed up to GM despite being a\
  \ minority in their community; it's always a risk, but it's work that makes this\
  \ community more welcoming for the rest of us. If this doesn't apply to you, I hope\
  \ you walk up to each table with the goal of getting to know all the players and\
  \ doing your part to create a safe and welcoming environment for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p><br>\n       Pathfinder is a game for everyone, but it takes everyone's\
  \ effort to make that true.&nbsp;</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Solatra Lilac Harvinkai,\
  \ credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving (nov/nov and dune/dune)</h3>\n      <p>To advocate\
  \ for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the world of women is a difficult topic\
  \ to broach. I am, personally, as a tall butch nonbinary lesbian who underwent estrogenizing\
  \ hormone treatments for several years, and who has felt like a boy and a girl and\
  \ a woman and am none now... am not often advocated for in the inclusion of.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I feel like when people aim to include women, they want to say that anyone\
  \ who considers themself a woman is welcome. Often, I’ve seen them explicitly turn\
  \ away trans women who are not able to safely come out for having some facial hair,\
  \ or implicitly for not speaking the same language as the majority at the function\
  \ by not having interpreters, or for being disabled by being in a venue with three\
  \ steps up.</p>\n      <p>This is me saying to include them. Include everyone affected\
  \ by misogyny. Fight the venue to get a ramp put in. Yell when they don’t want to\
  \ spend money for an interpreter. If you have any form of privilege, weaponize it\
  \ for those without.</p>\n      <p>We do not win alone. And there will come a day\
  \ when our voices demand more attention than their silence.</p>\n      <br>\n  \
  \    <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they)</h3>\n      <p>Sara Jeffers (she/they) is an Indigenous\
  \ Two Spirit game designer and graphic designer who utilizes traditional Salish\
  \ art and storytelling structures to help de-colonize game design and add to the\
  \ growing representation of First Nations and Indigenous North Americans in the\
  \ industry. They also professionally GM a number of systems and games, focusing\
  \ on combining horror with wholesome. When not writing or playing TTRPGs, Sara can\
  \ be found hanging out with the coolest kids on the planet (theirs) and watching\
  \ Bluey.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>Their previous published work includes Starfinder Bounty\
  \ #10 and several solo TTRPGs available on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://itch.io/\">itch.io</a>.\
  \ She is currently writing a full level 1-20 campaign for Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ and starting production on a murder mystery Actual Play set in the world of Thedas.\
  \ Her most recent graphic and motion design work can be seen on an upcoming Thirsty\
  \ Sword Lesbians Actual Play on Enchanting Sorcery Productions on Twitch and YouTube.</p>\n\
  \      <p>In the future, Sara wants to be part of the movement in the TTRPG industry\
  \ that leads towards something more exciting and less problematic than 4X play.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>\n      <p>Hello! I’m Lynne,\
  \ one of Paizo’s editors. I’m a queer femme and an advocate for inclusive games.\
  \ For over a decade, I worked in higher education as an interfaith and DEI educator—\
  a role that included developing and implementing training programs for students\
  \ and staff, and directly supporting students of all genders and sexual orientations.</p>\n\
  \      <p>This background now informs what I do in the gaming industry.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>I'd been a player for many years, but it was a 2018 call for contributors\
  \ to what would become&nbsp;<em>Uncaged Anthology</em>&nbsp;that inspired me to\
  \ start writing for TTRPGs. An anthology of one-shots, each centered on a feminist\
  \ reimagining of a traditionally female mythological archetype and its origins?\
  \ I had to do it! I battled my fear and pitched an adventure. Almost everyone on\
  \ the team was of a marginalized gender, and the support we gave (and still give)\
  \ each other was life changing. For most of us, it was the first time we’d experienced\
  \ anything like that.</p>\n      <p>I then helped edit all the subsequent&nbsp;<em>Uncaged</em>&nbsp;books.\
  \ That work led to more projects, and more opportunities to grow my skills. Eventually,\
  \ that led me to Paizo!</p>\n      <p>Find me on Bluesky (@lynnemeyer.bsky.social)\
  \ and Twitter (@Lynne_M_Meyer).</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Elizabeth V Nold (she/her)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hello! My name is Betsy (she/her) and I am a player, GM, and freelance\
  \ writer of TTRPGs. I most recently got to work on [redacted], but, in the meantime,\
  \ you can check out my work on the <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-05: Inheritor's\
  \ Rite</em> or <em>Pathfinder Bounty 7: Cleanup Duty</em>. I have also written for\
  \ the Shadowrun system and contributed to the <em>Attitude</em> sourcebook.</p>\n\
  \      <p>&nbsp;I began my TTRPG adventure when my friend bought an AD&amp;D book\
  \ for $1.00 at a yard sale. I did not realize until years later how rare my all-girl\
  \ group was at the time. In my 30+ years playing, GMing, and writing for games,\
  \ I have seen women go from being a minority to being a common sight. Gaming has\
  \ given me many opportunities. I have learned that I can write. Through GMing, volunteering\
  \ as a Venture Officer, and helping to organize Paizo Organized Play Games Conventions\
  \ (come say hi at Origins), I have learned to be confident in my abilities and how\
  \ to convey that confidence.</p>\n      <p>Thanks to all the strong women and allies\
  \ who have come before that made this possible for me. I hope that I can help keep\
  \ the progress moving forward.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Jessica Redekop (she/they/he)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Redekop (she/they/he), and I was one of two\
  \ women with a cover credit on <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>. Women play\
  \ games and belong in the gaming industry.</p>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n   \
  \    <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n      <p>This month and every month, we\
