  \ \n    <p>It's almost here! In less than a week, the <a href=\"/starfinder/beginnerbox\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a> will roam the wilds of outer space—and retail\
  \ stores across the globe—bringing a unique and introductory brand of Starfinder\
  \ to players everywhere.</p> \n    <p>Here at Paizo HQ, we couldn't be more excited.\
  \ The <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em> represents countless hours of passionate\
  \ game design and development, layout and artwork, editing, playtesting, and much\
  \ more. With the <em>Beginner Box</em>, we've put our hearts and souls into creating\
  \ a great experience to introduce brand-new roleplayers into the hobby that we all\
  \ love, and to create first impressions of the Starfinder RPG that players of all\
  \ experience levels will never forget.</p> \n    <p>For certain, the project was\
  \ a monumental undertaking. But knowing that our product might create deeply formative\
  \ experiences for new players—in the same way that our early experiences with roleplaying\
  \ changed our lives forever for the better—kept us all going the entire time. Now,\
  \ we can't wait to share this game and this beginner's product with the world.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em> hits stores on April 24, and to\
  \ help promote it, our partners at Two Kings Entertainment helped us put together\
  \ the ad you see on this page.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, the Starfinder team members\
  \ who helped bring this product to life have some thoughts to share about the process.</p>\

  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Creating the </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i> was\
  \ an extremely challenging and rewarding project that took dozens of people to execute.\
  \ For my part as one of its designers, I did everything I could to pack as much\
  \ of the Starfinder core experience into a package that's accessible to anyone with\
  \ an itch to explore our weird and wild science-fantasy galaxy. I'm proud of the\
  \ character sheet and especially happy about the player-aid cards. I hope they help\
  \ give novice players a sense of agency and serve as a handy reminder for those\
  \ with more experience.</i></p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: right;\">—Joe Pasini,\
  \ Starfinder Beginner Box Design Lead</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>I'm really excited to share the world of Starfinder with so many\
  \ more people—from those who want a handy way to check out what Starfinder has to\
  \ offer, to those who have never tried a roleplaying game before. I look forward\
  \ to hearing everyone's epic tales of galactic adventure!</i></p> \n     <p><i>Early\
  \ on in my RPG-playing hobby, I often had no one to play with. I ended up spending\
  \ a lot of time with solo adventures, which helped me learn the rules at my own\
  \ pace and without the pressure of making mistakes in front of more experienced\
  \ players. That kind of solo-introductory experience isn't a thing most tabletop\
  \ RPGs do much anymore. So even though this game supports group play and learning\
  \ how to GM, I was also super excited to see the solo portion of the game.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>I hope it lets someone else who doesn't want to try to learn a game\
  \ with a group, for whatever reason, figure out the basics at their own pace.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p style=\"text-align: right;\">—Owen K.C. Stephens, Starfinder Beginner\
  \ Box Design Lead</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>A boxed\
  \ set of basic rules was my first introduction to RPGs, so I've been looking forward\
  \ to doing a </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i> since we first started working on the\
  \ Starfinder RPG. There is so much in that box that I'm excited about, but I'm particularly\
  \ proud of the adventure I wrote for the </i>Starfinder Beginner Box<i>: “Steel\
  \ Talon's Lair.” It was a fun challenge to write an introductory adventure for Starfinder\
  \ that also would help GMs and players navigate through what could be their first\
  \ roleplaying game experience ever! I don't want to spoil the adventure here for\
  \ those who might play it, but one encounter features a strange effigy of an alien\
  \ quadruped, and I wanted to share a little bit of flavor about the relationship\
  \ between space goblins and horses that unfortunately had to be cut from the adventure\
  \ for space: “Horses have long been an object of fear and hatred to goblins, and\
  \ they hope that an image of such a fearsome creature will scare away intruders.\
  \ Of course, these space goblins have never seen a real horse, so the effigy is\
  \ more a representation of what they think a terrifying horse would look like.”\
  \ Suffice to say, the sculpture looks nothing like a real horse—but it's still terrifying\
  \ to space goblins!</i></p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: right;\">—Robert G. McCreary,\
  \ Starfinder Creative Director</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p><i>I had the privilege of designing most of the creatures for the </i>Starfinder\
  \ Beginner Box<i>. (Rob McCreary created the adventure's villain.) The primary point\
  \ was usability. It was fun to pare the monsters down to their essentials, and to\
  \ rework the language and format with that goal in mind. The creature section also\
  \ has plenty of evil NPCs, so GMs have scoundrels to use right out of the box. I'd\
  \ be remiss if I didn't point out that other members of the team, especially Joe\
  \ Pasini, made sure my work meshed with the overall system. The results take me\
  \ back to when I started with RPGs nearly 25 years ago with another beginner's box.\
  \ I hope the Starfinder Beginner Box does the same for a new generation of roleplayers!</i></p>\
