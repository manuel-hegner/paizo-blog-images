  artist: "the dashed promise of a male heir, nearly drove Lord Ghran Bhrostra mad,\
    \ and only his daughter's sobs stayed the lord's blade. For the next 12 years,\
    \ a continuing river of tears ensured the young bastard's life. Raised by his\
    \ sister Sioria, young Seltyiel lived a humiliating fiction. In words, he was\
    \ Lirt, an adopted waif who lived in the light of the Bhrostras' boundless charity.\
    \ In the truths whispered"
