  \ to understand, run, and play. I’ve been at Paizo for a long while now, with my\
  \ first big book (as an editor) being Ultimate Equipment. Designing Second Edition\
  \ with Jason, Mark Seifter, and Stephen Radney-MacFarland was the biggest job in\
  \ my time here, and the new places we can take the game are really exciting! We\
