  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Dave Gross</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Two: The First Trap</h2>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>\"We are most grateful, Count Jeggare.\"\
  \ In the reflected light of the glass cases, Queen Domina smiled down at me from\
  \ the dais. Its position in the grand foyer leant her the aspect of an ancient caryatid\
  \ guarding a collection of rare Azlanti jewels. \"The first of the saplings you\
  \ have brought us shall be planted here, outside the Jeggare Museum.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">A Chelaxian by birth and breeding, Domina\
  \ had come to Korvosa to rule. Her earliest proclamations had halved both the city's\
  \ bureaucracy and its coffers. As part of her civic improvement efforts, she had\
  \ reversed the ban on trees planted within the city walls—the result of a predecessor's\
  \ shortsighted reaction to the destruction wrought by windstorms over a century\
  \ earlier.</span></p> \n     <p>Beside Domina stood her adult son, Eodred. He had\
  \ made some effort to pay attention to the honor Her Majesty bestowed upon me, but\
  \ his gaze kept slipping back to our audience, particularly the young women.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>For that I could hardly fault him. To garnish their beauty, the ladies\
  \ of Korvosa had adorned themselves with exotic flowers instead of gems and gold.\
  \ Among them, only the queen wore jewels. I inferred from her curious glances that\
  \ she had not expected the change in fashion.</p> \n     <p>The queen offered a\
  \ few more words of gratitude for my gift of two hundred saplings and a thousand\
  \ seeds obtained from lands as distant as the Mwangi Expanse, Vudra, and Arcadia.\
  \ Her duty discharged, Domina took her son's arm and departed, accompanied by the\
  \ royal guard.</p> \n     <p>The Korvosan nobles rose in her wake, casting discreet\
  \ glances at each other and at me. In the queen's absence, I became the center of\
  \ attention.</p> \n     <p>Across the room, Fedele Ornelos caught my eye. He cut\
  \ a splendid figure in his dress armor, black and red leather trimmed in silver.\
  \ With a conspirator's wink, he drifted away from the crowd to join the soldiers\
  \ who waited with their hippogriffs outside the museum. There they would take flight\
  \ in the most conspicuous manner possible.</p> \n     <p>Restraining a smile at\
  \ my knowledge of his mission, I turned to see Vencarlo Orisini fixing an inquisitive\
  \ gaze upon me. He stood against the wall, where the other servants strove to make\
  \ themselves invisible while awaiting a signal from their masters. Vencarlo had\
  \ noticed my wordless exchange with the Sable Company captain.</p> \n     <p>Like\
  \ a younger Fedele Ornelos, Vencarlo also appeared dashing in his new attire, acquired\
  \ after our duel that morning. He took a step forward, but I shook my head. It was\
  \ not his place to address me among my peers. He frowned in disappointment and began\
  \ to step back when a woman crossed the floor between us.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Seraphina.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Seraphina_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n      <br>Seraphina is difficult to impress\n     </div> \n     <p>At\
  \ rest, Seraphina Leroung was not the most beautiful woman in Korvosa, but in motion\
  \ she was the epitome of grace. Men had fallen in love after seeing her walk only\
  \ a few steps, and the current flattery was that none dare watch her dance for fear\
  \ that they would take their own lives afterward in despair.</p> \n     <p>She wore\
  \ a garland of panther lilies around her neck, with a bloom secured behind one delicate\
  \ ear. The dusky flowers were subtler than those worn by the other ladies, but they\
  \ were by far the rarest.</p> \n     <p>One flaw marred Seraphina's face: a neat\
  \ scar directly beneath her left eye. Rumor abounded as to the cause of the injury,\
  \ but I suspected it was a fencing scar.</p> \n     <p>Seraphina smiled at me. If\
  \ I went to her, the eye of the city would follow—and perhaps that was her purpose,\
  \ to supplant me as the object of attention. I preferred she come to me.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Before either of us yielded to the other, Vencarlo leaped forward and performed\
  \ a sweeping bow before Seraphina. He reached for her right hand, but she withdrew\
  \ it. He spoke quickly, and her lips parted in surprise. Whatever he said caused\
  \ her to reconsider. She allowed him to kiss her left hand.</p> \n     <p>Furious,\
  \ I moved toward him, prepared to discharge him on the spot, but another guest intercepted\
  \ me.</p> \n     <p>\"My most estimable Count Jeggare!\"</p> \n     <p>Gaspare Orkatto\
  \ approached with a nervous wave of his fingers beside his cheek. Lowering his voice,\
  \ he concluded his conversation with the man at his side, oblivious to the fact\
  \ that my half-elven hearing perceived every word.</p> \n     <p>\"So you can see\
  \ my concern. No matter how often I increase the rent, they somehow manage to pay.\
  \ It can only be with the help of that scoundrel!\"</p> \n     <p>Orkatto was a\
  \ minor lord, one of the newly elevated merchants who had made himself valuable\
  \ to the crown by dint of his ability to create wealth. Of late he used that wealth\
  \ to acquire properties all over the city, with no discrimination as to the quality\
  \ of the district. When last we had met, he tested my patience with complaints about\
  \ the municipal red tape preventing him from buying whole neighborhoods in South\
  \ Shore. So long as the tenants continued to pay their rent, he could not take their\
  \ houses from them.</p> \n     <p>I nodded to acknowledge him. He beamed as if I'd\
  \ bestowed a great compliment.</p> \n     <p>\"Your Excellency, allow me to introduce\
  \ Piero Cucuteni. My lord Cucuteni has a keen interest in the matter you and I discussed\
  \ so recent—\"</p> \n     <p>\"I want that damned villain caught and punished, by\
  \ Asmodeus!\" snapped Cucuteni. He turned to look over his shoulder, gazing across\
  \ the room to where a hard-faced woman crowned in yellow roses peered into the jewelry\
  \ display. As if feeling his eyes upon her, she looked up and cast a basilisk's\
  \ stare back at him. Even I felt the hair on my neck rise at her reptilian disapproval.\
  \ Cucuteni gulped. \"She won't let me rest until I replace her jewelry—every piece!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Piero Cucuteni and I required no introduction. We had met at previous\
  \ social affairs, where I found his conversation limited to complaints about taxation\
  \ and the \"wretched\" Shoanti and Varisians.</p> \n     <p>\"That's what I was\
  \ telling you, my lord,\" said Orkatto. His obsequious tone would do little to ingratiate\
  \ him to the older families. \"Count Jeggare is well known in Cheliax for his ability\
  \ to aid... our sort of people.\"</p> \n     <p>Cucuteni rose to his full if modest\
  \ height. He had to tilt his head to look down his nose at the upstart Orkatto.\
  \ Old money never loves the new.</p> \n     <p>\"Very well,\" said Cucuteni. \"\
  Nothing else has stopped this rash of burglaries. Perhaps Count Jeggare can do the\
  \ trick.\"</p> \n     <p>With an effort to appear interested in their exchange,\
  \ I could not help but look back at Seraphina. Vencarlo stood indecently close to\
  \ her, smiling as he spoke into her ear. Whatever he said caused her to cover a\
  \ giggle.</p> \n     <p>I left a note in my Memory Library to never again hire such\
  \ a womanizer.</p> \n     <p>Before I realized it, I was striding toward them. \"\
  Stop disturbing the lady, Vencarlo. You are here as my bodyguard, not a jester.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"But Your Excellency, I was simply ensuring the lady posed no threat\
  \ to you.\"</p> \n     <p>My hot blood turned cold with true fury.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Your man is quite amusing,\" Lady Seraphina said before I could speak. \"This Vencarlo\
  \ is a marked improvement on that brute you had before. Do let him stay.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Vencarlo offered me a conciliatory shrug and smiled. \"A beautiful woman\
  \ commands all men. Is it not so, Excellency?\"</p> \n     <p>I stepped between\
  \ him and the lady to shelter her from his coarse behavior. Recalling a previous\
  \ visit to her father's estate and its extensive gardens, I ventured a guess. \"\
  Am I correct to surmise that you are the one responsible for the floral décor, Lady\
  \ Seraphina?\"</p> \n     <p>\"My secret is discovered!\" she said. \"It seemed\
  \ a pity to inflict the envy of those who have fallen victim to this villain Blackjack\
  \ on those who haven't.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You are the soul of diplomacy, my lady.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"And you are a flatterer,\" she said. \"Although not quite as vivid\
  \ in your compliments as your man has been.\" </p> \n     <p>During our exchange,\
  \ Vencarlo's demeanor transformed. His back grew as stiff as Cucuteni's. \"Blackjack\
  \ is no villain, Lady Seraphina.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Do you suggest he is not the\
  \ perpetrator of the burglaries?\"</p> \n     <p>\"On the contrary,\" Vencarlo replied.\
  \ \"Who else could perform such daring acts? Who else could elude the Sable Company\
  \ and make fools of the Korvosan Guard? But only the wealthy call him a villain.\
  \ To the common people of Korvosa, he is a great hero.\"</p> \n     <p>\"To the\
  \ common people?\" cried Lord Cucuteni, who along with Orkatto had followed me across\
  \ the foyer. \"Do you speak of the Shoanti who befoul our streets with their native\
  \ stinks and rituals? Or do you mean the Varisians, each born with his hand in another's\
  \ pocket?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not all Varisians are Sczarni,\" said Vencarlo. \"Most\
  \ are perfectly—\"</p> \n     <p>\"Still your tongue,\" I said. \"You have no right\
  \ to contradict a lord of Korvosa.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I want the blackguard found\
  \ and punished,\" puffed Cucuteni, forgetting Vencarlo's presence. \"He must suffer\
  \ as I have suffered every day since he stole into my wife's chambers and took her\
  \ jewels.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo's face reddened with the effort of stifling a\
  \ humorous retort to Cucuteni's ill-chosen words. This time it was I who utilized\
  \ the gaze of the basilisk, turning it upon my upstart bodyguard. Fortunately, for\
  \ both his sake and mine, it turned at least his tongue to stone.</p> \n     <p>Seraphina\
  \ lay a hand on Cucuteni's arm. \"Until they are recovered, I promise to send Agnese\
  \ a different breed of fresh flowers every day. Aren't those roses lovely in her\
  \ hair?\"</p> \n     <p>Cucuteni's jowls worked without producing any words, until\
  \ finally he murmured, \"Very kind of you, dear lady. Very kind indeed.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"You must have an expansive garden,\" I said in an attempt to guide the\
  \ conversation away. \"When next you visit Egorian, perhaps you would allow me to\
  \ show you my hothouse at Greensteeples. Among other rare species, I have cultivated\
  \ a weed symbiotic to your panther lilies, a specimen that produces a deadly toxin\
  \ used by the Zenj people of central Mwangi.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How fascinating.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I think the lady would prefer to witness a fencing demonstration,\"\
  \ said Vencarlo. He, too, had identified her as a swordswoman.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  The lady can decide for herself,\" said Seraphina, frowning at Vencarlo. \"And now\
  \ I decide you have become tiresome after all.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What?\" Vencarlo\
  \ could not have looked more surprised.</p> \n     <p>\"You heard her,\" I said,\
  \ trying without great success to avoid gloating. \"Return to your station.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Raising his proud chin as though he had just been slapped, Vencarlo\
  \ bowed, spun on his heel, and returned to his place among the servants. Unlike\
  \ the rest, who stood at attention, he lounged against the wall, striking a pose\
  \ he must have thought made him appear like a swashbuckler.</p> \n     <p>Seeing\
  \ Seraphina's gaze flick back to him, I had to admit, if only to myself, that it\
  \ succeeded.</p> \n     <p>\"There,\" said Orkatto. \"Now that we are no longer\
  \ overheard by the help, Your Excellency, perhaps you would unfold your plan to\
  \ Lord Cucuteni?\"</p> \n     <p>\"A plan? Do you mean something like a business\
  \ transaction?\" Seraphina scrunched her nose in distaste. \"Or do you mean something\
  \ thrilling? A scheme, or a plot, or—better still—a stratagem? Oh, let it be a stratagem!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Mocking though it was, her enthusiasm enchanted me. I looked to see\
  \ that the museum staff had begun ushering the guests outside to their carriages.\
  \ Servants began extinguishing the lights and barring the windows. Soon it would\
  \ be time to set my trap.</p> \n     <p>I signaled my agents among the servants.\
  \ The one beside Vencarlo tapped him on the shoulder and gestured for him to remove\
  \ his new jacket.</p> \n     <p>Inhaling, I savored the perfume of Seraphina's flowers.\
  \ \"I suppose there is no harm in sharing the details now, so close to the appointed\
  \ hour.\"</p> \n     <p>Seraphina leaned close and gave me her rapt attention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You may have noticed that the officers of the Sable Company left soon\
  \ after the queen's departure.\"</p> \n     <p>Orkatto, already aware of the details,\
  \ nodded at an accelerating rate, eager for me to share the rest.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  And the city guard,\" said Seraphina. \"I saw two squadrons marching quickly through\
  \ the streets as our carriage approached the museum.\"</p> \n     <p>\"They will\
  \ provide a conspicuous presence at all of the most likely targets of Blackjack's\
  \ larceny.\"</p> \n     <p>\"All but one!\" blurted Orkatto.</p> \n     <p>\"The\
  \ jewels here,\" said Seraphina. \"You've set them as bait.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You\
  \ are as astute as you are observant.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And as beautiful as you\
  \ are astute,\" said Vencarlo, materializing at my elbow like a dog who cannot be\
  \ kept from the supper. He beamed at Seraphina. \"To praise a woman, a man must\
  \ not overlook her beauty.\"</p> \n     <p>Behind him, the agent who bore a passing\
  \ resemblance to Vencarlo shrugged on his jacket and went to the entrance. I doffed\
  \ my own coat and handed it to the hireling who resembled me. Together, they would\
  \ enter my Red Carriage and depart the museum, leaving us inside with the twenty\
  \ guards who had gradually secreted themselves throughout the museum during the\
  \ day. Several other servants had also donned finery to depart, presenting the illusion\
  \ that as many nobles who had entered for the gala reception were now returning\
  \ home.</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo turned to me. \"Your scheme will never succeed, Excellency.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Pray enlighten us why.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Blackjack will detect\
  \ your trap.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How?\"</p> \n     <p>\"It is clever to show as many\
  \ people departing as remaining, but Blackjack is also clever. He will sense a trap\
  \ when he sees you have dismissed the guards.\"</p> \n     <p>\"But I have not dismissed\
  \ them. They remain at their stations, with the exception of two absences, allowing\
  \ the thief a choice of entrances.\"</p> \n     <p>A crash and a shout alerted us\
  \ to activity toward the rear of the museum.</p> \n     <p>\"And there you have\
  \ it. The trap is sprung.\"</p> \n     <p>Vencarlo's insouciant air evaporated.\
  \ \"You mustn't do this, Count! Blackjack is not some common thief. The jewels he\
  \ steals feed the poor. He is a champion of the people!\"</p> \n     <p>\"That is\
  \ for a magistrate to decide. Unlike your scofflaw idol, I do not take the law into\
  \ my own hands. I simply introduce it to those who have strayed beyond its grasp.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I cannot allow you do this, Your Excellency.\" Vencarlo bowed and\
  \ reached for his weapon. </p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
