  \   </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The final volume of the Iron Gods Adventure\
  \ Path, <a href=\"/products/btpy9au9\">Pathfinder #90: The Divinity Drive</a>, is\
  \ soon to depart the spaceport... I mean, our warehouse. In this volume, the adventure\
  \ reaches its exciting conclusion, and it also marks the finale of Amber E. Scott's\
  \ excellent story in the Pathfinder's Journal.</p> \n    <p>Not too long after working\
  \ up the initial general plot for the Pathfinder's Journal with Amber, I got her\
  \ first chapter in my email. I really enjoyed the two protagonists and how they\
  \ worked together and wanted to see how she'd go on to develop their relationship.\
  \ Then after the second chapter showed up in my inbox, I met a new favorite character—\
  Tryg, the little robot that Eirian and Sidek rescue.</p> \n    <p>I liked Amber's\
  \ description of the robot and I couldn't wait to see how Rodrigo Vega would draw\
  \ it. When the first sketch came back I was delighted. He looked weird and cute\
  \ at the same time, which is always a win for me. When the final art for that first\
  \ illustration of Tryg came in I printed it out and pinned it to the wall of my\
  \ cube. Like the protagonists in the story, I ended up falling in love with that\
  \ little guy, so I figured I'd go ahead and stat him up since he's one of the few\
  \ robots that we've illustrated in Iron Gods that doesn't have stats.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>While I was working on the robot's stats, I took the chance to get Amber to\
  \ talk a bit about her adorable robotic creation. She had this to say:</p> \n  \
  \  <blockquote> \n     <p>\"What was most important to me was for Tryg to be more\
  \ than just a mindless automaton. He had to have a personality and some free will;\
  \ otherwise there would be no reason to care about his eventual fate. To me, Tryg\
  \ was clever and curious and playful, too. He learns eventually that he's gonna\
  \ get grabbed and tied up every night and first he tries to outsmart Sidek and later\
  \ he's resigned to it.\" (My intent, even though I never said so explicitly, is\
  \ because Tryg has a sense of what awaits him at the signal's source and he knows\
  \ Sidek is trying to help him get there).</p> \n     <p>I also selected the name\
  \ 'Tryg' as an alternate spelling of the Norwegian name ‘Trygg/Tryggr,' which means\
  \ faithful/trusty, to reinforce the image of Tryg the robot as a loyal canine companion.”\
  </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Here's what this a lovable robot companion looks\
  \ like in Pathfinder stats.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  >Special Abilities</p> \n     <p><b>Integrated Laser Torch (Ex)</b> As part of its\
  \ built-in toolkit, Tryg is outfitted with an integrated laser torch it can use\
  \ to cut through minor barriers. When activated, the torch emits a beam of highly\
  \ focused light, cutting and burning through surfaces up to 6 inches away. Attacks\
  \ from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d4 points of fire damage.\
  \ This damage is not modified further by Strength. Tryg's integrated laser torch\
  \ is mounted inside one of its appendages. When the laser torch is used as a tool\
  \ or as a weapon to sunder, its damage bypasses hardness up to 20 points, and damage\
  \ is not halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless\
  \ the object is particularly fire-resistant. A laser torch's cutting beam passes\
  \ through force fields and force effects without damaging the field. Invisible objects\
  \ and creatures can't be harmed by a laser torch.</p> \n     <p><b>Tools (Ex)</b>\
  \ Tyrg has tools built into its body that can reconfigure themselves into nearly\
  \ any cutting, grasping, or drilling device. Tryg is always considered to be using\
  \ masterwork tools for any Craft or Disable Device checks.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
