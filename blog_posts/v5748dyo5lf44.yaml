  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Touch of the Grave</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>Larem hissed\
  \ and dropped the silver piece, yet his fingertips burned from the frigid contact.</p></span>\
  \ \n    <p>The person remained before him, and Larem could sense its silent mockery.\
  \ He reached for his dagger.</p> \n    <p>\"Who are you?\"</p> \n    <p>His tormenter\
  \ shifted with a creak of leather. Its every movement groaned and crackled with\
  \ age.</p> \n    <p>No, not age, Larem realized as he caught another whiff of grave\
  \ dust. Death. An undead creature leered at him, having concealed its nature until\
  \ now through some magic. The knowledge wrapped his heart in thorns and stopped\
  \ him from drawing the blade. </p> \n    <p>The thing's voice held all the black\
  \ promise of a bottomless pit. \"Wise. Now, where are the other two? Those thieves\
  \ you call brothers.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem fought down shivers. \"Dead. They're beyond\
  \ your grasp, whatever you wished to accomplish here. I'm just a blind beggar. Leave\
  \ me be.\"</p> \n    <p>A long sniff tickled his hair. \"Not dead. I smell them\
  \ on you.\" Bony fingers wrapped about his throat, carrying the same sapping chill\
  \ as the coin. Strength fled Larem's limbs, and he gagged at the carrion reek and\
  \ clammy touch. \"I've been searching for you since I woke. You've something of\
  \ mine.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing. Nothing.\"</p> \n    <p>The dead creature's hand\
  \ tightened. \"At first, when I detected you hiding among the rat rabble of this\
  \ city, I thought it a ploy. An attempt to throw me off track. With each one I killed,\
  \ I expected you to rise up in righteous fury and revenge, as you were once famed\
  \ to do. Yet with each, you disappointed. Have the Bloody Blade Brothers truly fallen\
  \ so low? What do you hide behind these rags?\"</p> \n    <p>Fingertips hooked the\
  \ leather strap and yanked. The worn cord securing it snapped, and Larem rocked\
  \ back. </p> \n    <p>A laugh like skulls knocking together. \"How tragic. Larem\
  \ the Long-Sighted now unable to spy a fly buzzing about his nose.\" </p> \n   \
  \ <p>Larem swallowed. \"Who are you?\" </p> \n    <p>\"You know who I am. I've forgotten\
  \ my living name, but I remember you three sneaking through the tomb, pilfering\
  \ without regard for the dead. Well, the dead have no regard for you, except for\
  \ what you've taken from us.\"</p> \n    <p>It creaked again, withered flesh shifting\
  \ around dry joints. \"I know you still have it. The Weeping Blade. I feel it within\
  \ the city bounds. One of you keeps it hidden. I'll have it back or I'll have your\
  \ souls.\" Rotting fingers stroked his cheek. \"For every day that you refuse further,\
  \ I will claim another life. And not just scraggly beggars. Women. Children.\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We don't... we can't...\"</p> \n    <p>\"When you change your mind,\
  \ find me in the graveyard behind the shrine of Sarenrae in Underbridge under moonlight.\
  \ Until then, enjoy knowing you're the reason for this bloodshed. I'll be watching.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>After a final chilling caress, the creature shuffled off. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Larem didn't know how long he sat there, sweating and shivering. Samphy's\
  \ threats paled compared to this. Could it be possible? Were they the unwitting\
  \ cause of the death plaguing the city's poor and destitute? </p> \n    <p>He lurched\
  \ to his feet. By the time he reached Seerspring Garden, he'd collected further\
  \ aches and bruises by running into building corners, crate stacks, and pedestrians\
  \ who thrust him back out of the way with well-aimed elbows and knees. He used the\
  \ gurgling of the fountain to get his bearings and then staggered east until he\
  \ reached the gates of the Merchants' Guildhall, lurching through the throng of\
  \ laborers and traders who milled about.</p> \n    <p>\"Dargley,\" he cried. \"\
  Where are you? Dargley!\"</p> \n    <p>He misjudged the distance to the Guildhall's\
  \ wall and cracked his head against it. He reeled, spun about, and fell.</p> \n\
  \    <p>A hand grabbed his and hauled him upright. Sticky fingers patted his face\
  \ as he panted.</p> \n    <p>\"Nocky opate?\"</p> \n    <p>Larem clung to the other\
  \ man's bulk. </p> \n    <p>\"Take me to Beetle.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Beetle.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br>Beetle may be shorter than most men, but he's twice as ornery.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Beetle's voice slurred loudly as they entered the tavern. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Matsy, darling. Get over 'ere and gimme a sight worth seeing.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Burn you, Beetle,\" came a gruff male voice. \"Watch the door, not\
  \ the staff.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bah! 'S too early for any troublemakers. I'll toss\
  \ any out on their arses, dontcha worry.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem navigated the maze\
  \ of tables with Dargley's help. When they reached Beetle, he didn't notice their\
  \ arrival until Larem nudged him.</p> \n    <p>\"Boys! Pull up a stool. Piss-poor\
  \ slop, but it's on me tonight. \"</p> \n    <p>He slurped from what Larem guessed\
  \ to be a tankard—a guess he confirmed by slapping it away.</p> \n    <p>\"'Ey!\
  \ What'ser problem? I said I's paying, didn't I?\"</p> \n    <p>Larem tried to glare\
  \ through the reaffixed leather strap. \"How can you afford this?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Got me a job, didn't I tell yeh? I's...\" Beetle hiccupped. \"I's a bouncer. I bounce\
  \ 'em in. I bounce 'em out. Never ain't nobody think they gonna get walloped by\
  \ a man who don't come up to their balls. But when I bite, they all holler the same.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Larem gritted his teeth. Bouncer? More likely a spectacle the tavern\
  \ owner figured would draw in extra business. </p> \n    <p>\"Listen to me. I know\
  \ who's been causing the beggar deaths.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ain't you the clever bastard.\"\
  \ Beetle burped. \"Whosa fiend?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are. We're the reason these\
  \ people have been dying.\"</p> \n    <p>By Beetle's prolonged silence, Larem wagered\
  \ the news had brought him at least halfway around to sobriety. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Whatchu mean?\"</p> \n    <p>Larem turned them away from the growing crowd. \"You\
  \ kept the Weeping Blade, didn't you? After we agreed it was too dangerous, you've\
  \ kept it stashed all these years.\"</p> \n    <p>Beetle's words hung heavy with\
  \ a drunken pout. \"Dunno whatcher talking 'bout.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem reached out\
  \ and, by luck, caught the collar of Beetle's shirt, crusted with dribble and drink.\
  \ \"The Weeping Blade! From the Tomb of Annuram, the one we broke into a few years\
  \ before... before the accident. The tomb's guardian is here. It believes we still\
  \ have the blade, and it's going to keep killing innocents until we return it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Beetle tore Larem's hand away. \"We stole a hunnerd cursed bits of\
  \ metal o'er the years. You think I'm gonna remember one shiny chit from all the\
  \ rest? And if I had that sorta treasure, I'da sold it quick as hot piss.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You swear on your mother's bones you don't have it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I'll swear on your bones if you don't stop with this. Ain't got it and never did.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Larem slumped on the bench. Beetle wouldn't lie straight out like\
  \ this, no matter how deep in the slop. Which meant the creature concealed a deeper\
  \ agenda or had errantly tracked them down. </p> \n    <p>\"Weeping Blade, eh? What\
  \ made it so special?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Cursed dagger,\" Larem said. \"Stories said\
  \ it helped you win fights by overwhelming your enemy with despair, but any wielder\
  \ eventually wound up going insane. Which is why we agreed to leave the dagger in\
  \ the gravedust.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Did we?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We did. I recall that\
  \ conversation clearly because Dargley and I had to physically restrain you from\
  \ taking it until you saw sense.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What sorta fiend was it that spoke\
  \ to you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Undead of some kind. Intelligent. Able to work some magic,\
  \ as it disguised its true nature until it confronted me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Would\
  \ 'splain why no one's caught the bastard yet. Notta ghoul though.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Nor a lich. I doubt anything that powerful would've gone undetected for so long.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"S'more than your average wraith too. Maybe a wight of some sort?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Larem bit his tongue. A wight. Far beyond just an animated corpse—\
  a creature deliberately raised by foul magic to guard a burial site and any treasure\
  \ stashed there. Relentless, powerful, and intelligent. This one must've been a\
  \ spellcaster in its previous existence, or else had some other sort of magic that\
  \ let it track them and conceal itself in the city.</p> \n    <p>Still didn't explain\
  \ why it believed they had the dagger. Had another band of adventurers—or opportunists,\
  \ as they once called themselves—taken it after them and somehow set the creature\
  \ on their scent?</p> \n    <p>He scrubbed his forehead. \"What are we going to\
  \ do?\"</p> \n    <p>Beetle clamped a hand on his shoulder. \"Do? What'd we always\
  \ do with any unholy beastie? We kill the damn thing.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The church to Sarenrae stood desolate under the enormous pilings\
  \ of the Irespan, the ancient, shattered monument that kept the district called\
  \ Underbridge tucked into eternal shadow. The church had been built during Magnimar's\
  \ founding years by a Sarenite cleric named Vosten in an attempt to bring a guiding\
  \ light to the city... until Sczarni thugs beat him and his acolytes to death when\
  \ he refused to pay into their protection racket. Since then, the church had languished\
  \ untended. Like most landmarks in Underbridge, it had become an unspoken center\
  \ of black-market commerce where foul deeds went unnoticed and fouler packages were\
  \ swapped in the dark.</p> \n    <p>Larem tried not to breathe in the stink of rot\
  \ that stained the area. Would the three of them add to those buried there alongside\
  \ Vosten, their names long forgotten?</p> \n    <p>He stood twenty paces before\
  \ Vosten's grave, marked by a tilted gray pillar overgrown with thorny weeds. Beetle\
  \ had described it and the surrounding layout when they arrived. Rows of salt-stained\
  \ pillars lined either side of him, foundations cracked, any inscriptions worn away\
  \ by a century of sea winds and vandalism. </p> \n    <p>After scouting to ensure\
  \ the wight hadn't preceded them, Dargley and Beetle had slipped off to their hiding\
  \ spot. </p> \n    <p>As he waited, Larem fiddled with the dagger tucked into his\
  \ waistband. The moon hung low enough to gleam across the ruins—Beetle had scoffed\
  \ when Larem claimed moonlight possessed a different texture on the skin than sunlight.\
  \ Like a candle beaming through a sheet of ice.</p> \n    <p>Or perhaps the feeling\
  \ came from the cold sweat that slicked his neck and chest. </p> \n    <p>A salty\
  \ breeze whispered past, and dead vines and leaves crackled under his feet whenever\
  \ he shifted his weight. A creature rustled in a far corner of the yard. Larem stiffened,\
  \ but whatever it was pattered off on four paws. If any vermin of the two-legged\
  \ variety lurked about, they wisely kept their presence concealed, perhaps put off\
  \ by a blind man standing sentry in the middle of a graveyard. </p> \n    <p>He\
  \ imagined himself a statue set in place to watch over the spirits of the dead and\
  \ ensure their safe passage into the afterlife. If they survived this night, he\
  \ considered visiting one of Pharasma's temples and paying a copper to polish an\
  \ hourglass in gratitude to the Lady of Graves.</p> \n    <p>\"Do you have it?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>One instant he stood alone; the next, the wight filled the space before\
  \ him, a sucking presence that made his throat tighten. How? Larem hadn't heard\
  \ a thing until it spoke and its putrid aura enveloped him.</p> \n    <p>Quelling\
  \ a shudder, he forced himself to stand tall. There'd been a time when he'd faced\
  \ far deadlier creatures than this—though then he'd had his sight and held a length\
  \ of sharp steel. Or better yet, a bow.</p> \n    <p>\"I spoke with the others,\"\
  \ he said, proud that his voice held firm. \"One revealed that he did indeed keep\
  \ the Weeping Blade, and I humbly ask forgiveness for the desecration.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The air temperature dropped several degrees. \"Then where is it? Why haven't\
  \ you brought it as required?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Unfortunately, my companion buried\
  \ it outside the city. I can tell you exactly where to find it if you'll give me\
  \ but a few minutes.\"</p> \n    <p>Again that long snuffling. \"Liar. I smell the\
  \ blade's stink on you. You've been near it recently. What trickery are you and\
  \ the two beating hearts in the shadows planning?\"</p> \n    <p>Larem frowned.\
  \ On him? How? Before he could give this revelation further thought, a skeletal\
  \ fist gripped his tunic and held him in place. Once more, vitality seeped out of\
  \ him, leaving his limbs trembling.</p> \n    <p>\"I despise thieves and I abide\
  \ a lying tongue even less. Shall I tear yours out?\"</p> \n    <p>Summoning a last\
  \ scrap of strength, Larem drew his dagger and slashed upward—not at the wight,\
  \ but at the length of fabric it held. The well-honed edge sliced through the rotten\
  \ cloth, and he threw himself backward, shouting, \"Now!\"</p> \n    <p>A roar echoed\
  \ through the graveyard as Beetle and Dargley threw themselves against the pillar\
  \ they'd crouched behind. There was a grinding noise, and then a greater crack as\
  \ it toppled toward the wight.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
