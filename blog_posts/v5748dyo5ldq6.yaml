  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">The Twelve-Hour Statue</h1>\
  \ \n    <p>by Michael Kortes</p> \n    <p>It was quite certain. Xaven's next step\
  \ would kill him.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The halfling tomb\
  \ raider had been doing this long enough to know that he was standing on a pressure\
  \ plate. In fact, Xaven had known of his predicament for over eleven hours now,\
  \ a fact carefully measured by the notched candle to his left, now slowly burning\
  \ down to a stump. During that time, he had been left to stand in as near perfect\
  \ stillness as he could manage. A stretch, a sneeze, a momentary lapse of concentration—\
  one of these things would eventually kill him. Judging by the fatigue of his aching\
  \ muscles, it would be sooner rather than later. Xaven had had plenty of time to\
  \ contemplate the trap's mechanism. Indeed, he had experimented with a disarmed\
  \ deathplate once before, a year prior. As soon as any portion of his weight came\
  \ off the plate, the ceiling arches would collapse. And judging by the placement\
  \ of those arches, a hundred feet of stone corridor would come down on top of him,\
  \ cascading all the way back to the entrance.</span></p> \n    <p>Xaven blamed himself.\
  \ If he had been a split-second sharper, he wouldn't be standing in the exact spot\
  \ his long-dead killer had anticipated. Admittedly, he noted with twisted pride,\
  \ a split second slower and he would already be dead. Yet that particular achievement\
  \ was soon to be regrettably academic.</p> \n    <p>The issue now was what would\
  \ happen when he finally hit the twelve-hour mark and the candle went out, plunging\
  \ him into darkness. At that point, keeping his center of balance would become exponentially\
  \ harder. The candle had been left by his fellow tomb raider, Hrokon—a half-orc\
  \ who should have been back seven hours ago. The reality of the situation was quickly\
  \ becoming clear: that either Hrokon wasn't coming back in time, or he wasn't coming\
  \ back at all. Technically, it wouldn't really matter which was the case, but the\
  \ former pointed to incompetence, while the later was betrayal. Xaven had already\
  \ decided that if it was a betrayal, he owed the half-orc a serious pummeling in\
  \ the afterlife.</p> \n    <p>And vengeance in the afterlife would be his only option\
  \ for revenge. As a successful tomb robber, Xaven had enough gold stashed away to\
  \ be revived. But with his body buried under a thousand tons of rubble, his corpse\
  \ would never be retrieved. This life, his first, was going to be his last on Golarion\
  \ after all. Perhaps Hrokon was off somewhere spending their revival funds right\
  \ now. The damned half-orc was a lot smarter than he like to let on. Admittedly,\
  \ if their situations were reversed, Xaven would also have given desertion some\
  \ serious thought.</p> \n    <p>In any event, Xaven estimated he had less than a\
  \ half-hour to go before the candle burned its last, at which point he would have\
  \ a decision to make. He could either play it out until he inevitably slipped or\
  \ fainted from exhaustion, or he could pick his moment, step off the plate, and\
  \ welcome the rock shower in the last of the dying light. Presently, Xaven was leaning\
  \ towards controlling his destiny and stepping off, but he still hadn't come up\
  \ with a sufficiently clever line for his final words. </p> \n    <p>The fact that\
  \ an appropriate zinger eluded him was, for Xaven, a strong argument that he wasn't\
  \ meant to let things end just yet. The halfling considered whether the ordeal was\
  \ driving him crazy. Then again, debatably Xaven had lost his sanity a long time\
  \ ago. Anyone who robs the dead, fully knowing they leave traps of this nature,\
  \ couldn't be quite right in the head.</p> \n    <p>Yet here he was. Forgotten temples\
  \ had always been one of the halfling's most cherished targets, both for their relics\
  \ and for their inevitable death traps—two items that, until about eleven and a\
  \ half hours ago, had been among Xaven's favorite things. </p> \n    <p>A voice\
  \ came from above: \"Well, the ceiling is still here. Are you down there, little\
  \ buddy?\" </p> \n    <p>It was Hrokon, calling from above and ahead, near the temple's\
  \ entrance. Xaven stilled himself, fighting the sudden rush of excitement. Every\
  \ movement had to stay under control.</p> \n    <p>The powerful half-orc slid down\
  \ the carved stone ladder from the temple's foyer to the arched corridor below.\
  \ He loped toward Xaven, covering the hall's hundred-foot length with remarkable\
  \ casualness. But then, he knew that Xaven had disabled all the traps in that section.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Of course I'm still here, you idiot! What took you so long?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Aroden's nostrils! Your shopping list was long.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Start\
  \ by bringing the water! And hurry, I'm losing my light here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Coming up.\" Hrokon dug out a tiny folded-paper cup and filled it with water from\
  \ his canteen. He moved slowly now, taking care to avoid coming close enough to\
  \ touch the pressure plate. Xaven had made Hroken draw a wide circle around the\
  \ plate with chalk before he left. \"And I got more candles too.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Good. Light 'em up.\" The halfling slowly accepted the cup and brought it to his\
  \ lips to drink. Sensation began to return, first to his tongue and then to his\
  \ throat. \"We've gotta get you building the sled right away.\" </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Already done, Xaven. I had a smith put it together for us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\
  \ You brought someone in?\" Xaven almost snorted his precious water out of his nose.\
  \ \"What if he starts asking questions?!\"</p> \n    <p>Hroken made that strange\
  \ crackling sound that passed for his laugh. \"You really want to concern yourself\
  \ with that kind of detail right now?\" He grinned and began lighting candles, waiting\
  \ for them to heat up so he could drip their wax and secure them to the floor.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No, I guess not,\" Xaven admitted after some thought. \"But cut me\
  \ some slack here. I've been playing statue for twelve hours!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Easy, little buddy. We'll get you out of here shortly.\" Hrokon cast his gaze up\
  \ at the ceiling 20 feet above. \"Now stay focused. You've come this far, I don't\
  \ want you bringing the temple down on both of us.</p> \n    <p>Xaven steadied himself\
  \ once more. \"Right. Then go get the sled and lay out the rope. Are you sure you\
  \ understand the layout?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Stop worrying about me for once. Just\
  \ focus on your part.\" Hrokon lit the last of the candles. \"I'll be right back.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Xaven concentrated on his breathing while he waited. With four new\
  \ candles, both his world and his outlook were already brighter. Minutes later he\
  \ could hear Hrokon steadily working away, uncoiling a pair of thin but hopefully\
  \ sturdy ropes. Once Hrokon lit a dozen more candles to line the corridor's length,\
  \ Xaven could see the ropes dangling from the top of the ladder at the mouth of\
  \ the temple foyer down to the flagstones of the corridor he was trapped in. From\
  \ there, Hrokon carefully laid rope all the way back to the edge of the chalk line.\
  \ The half-orc then made a further trip topside, returning with his final item,\
  \ a flat rectangular board with four wheels and a handle.</p> \n    <p>As he returned\
  \ he asked, \"I still don't see why the better plan isn't to just substitute a big\
  \ rock for your weight on the deathplate.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Believe me, I thought\
  \ about it,\" answered Xaven, \"But it won't work—that split second of too much\
  \ or too little weight will set the scale off. It's a crazy risk.\"</p> \n    <p>Hrokon\
  \ rolled his eyes. \"And this plan of yours is much more sane.\"</p> \n    <p>Xaven\
  \ ignored him, squinting his eyes as he appraised the sled. \"Have the wheels been\
  \ oiled like we talked about?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Spin\
  \ 'em. Let me see.\"</p> \n    <p>Hrokon patiently spun each wheel for Xaven, one\
  \ at a time. Xaven had to admit they looked pretty damned good—especially for a\
  \ custom job made in the middle of the night. If this worked, Xaven would have to\
  \ give a sizable tip to Hrokon's smith, and not just to shut him up.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Nice work, Hrokon.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thanks.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You know, for a minute\
  \ or two there, I kinda thought maybe you weren't coming back for me. Maybe you\
  \ just grabbed the altar chest and left.\"</p> \n    <p>Hrokon let loose with his\
  \ crackle laugh once more. \"Really? I'm hurt.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Never crossed your\
  \ mind?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course it did, but then I thought to myself: ‘how will\
  \ I get to see if Xaven's idea might actually work?'\" </p> \n    <p>\"So you did\
  \ think about deserting!\" </p> \n    <p>\"Xaven, do you think maybe we can tend\
  \ to your insecurities after we get us out of this deathtrap?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Okay, okay. Let's go over the timing once more.\" </p> \n    <p>Hrokon repeated\
  \ the final steps once more for Xaven as he pulled out a pair of manacles from his\
  \ pack. He knew by now that the halfling trusted no one, even at the best of times.\
  \ \"When I hear the ‘ready,' I count to three. On three exactly, I whip the horse\
  \ team and we race as fast as we possibly can. There's a bit of a downward slope\
  \ from the entrance, actually, so we'll get a good start. You ready?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I've been ready for twelve hours,\" Xaven said, slowly holding out his left\
  \ arm for the manacle.</p> \n    <p>\"Good,\" said Hrokon, snapping one clasp around\
  \ Xaven's wrist and then the other to the sled's metal handle. The key was left\
  \ in the lock. \"Now don't miss the sled with your jump off the plate or you'll\
  \ lose your arm.\"</p> \n    <p>\"My arm?\" Xaven snorted. \"Hrokon, if I miss the\
  \ sled, the Pathfinders will be digging up my pulverized skeleton a hundred years\
  \ from now.\"</p> \n    <p>The half-orc grinned. \"Then don't miss it.\" He paused.\
  \ \"You've been still an awful long while, Xaven. Your muscles won't react quite\
  \ like they should.\"</p> \n    <p>Xaven grit his teeth. \"I won't miss. You just\
  \ make sure the horses accelerate to a gallop right out of the gate. How many did\
  \ you get?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Eight. I already told you, I got everything on the list.\
  \ They're good ones too—Andoren breeds, mostly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Alright then, let's\
  \ do this. Head topside and call me for the countdown when you're in position.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>And then Xaven was alone again. He breathed and sweated in the newly\
  \ bright corridor. That's all he had done for the last twelve hours, but apparently\
  \ he still had more sweat to give. He hadn't told the half-orc how poor the odds\
  \ were that his plan would actually work. If the ceiling came down all at once,\
  \ it wouldn't matter how fast the horses were.</p> \n    <p>But if there was anything\
  \ Xaven knew, it was how trapsmiths worked, and temple engineers always had a flair\
  \ for the dramatic. The ceiling would come down in sections. If he could just stay\
  \ ahead of each chunk, it was possible he could make it to the bottom of the ladder\
  \ in time. </p> \n    <p>The half-orc's shout reverberated down the hall. \"I'm\
  \ in position. The horses are ready to run!\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Xaven_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    \
  \ <br> Xaven used to really enjoy working with traps...\n    </div> \n    <p>Xaven\
  \ closed his eyes, then slowly opened them again. This was it. He sucked in a breath\
  \ to respond, hoping his throat was up to it.</p> \n    <p>\"Ready!\" he called.\
  \ \"Go!\"</p> \n    <p>At first he wasn't sure the half-orc heard him. Then he heard\
  \ the count. </p> \n    <p>Xaven dove for the sled. If he was too early, he was\
  \ dead. If he missed it, he was dead. </p> \n    <p>The sled shot forward as soon\
  \ as Xaven crashed down on its wooden bed. He clawed for the handle with both hands\
  \ and felt a tear in the sockets of his arms.</p> \n    <p>Pulled by the horse team\
  \ above, the ropes connected to the sled had gone taut instantly, and the sled was\
  \ now flying down the corridor. Rather than rolling across the ground as planned,\
  \ it bounced off the flagstones. A half-moment later, Xaven's world became infinitely\
  \ smaller as a cascade of granite blocks suddenly fell from the ceiling in massive\
  \ chunks. The deadfalls exploded right behind him with a shock wave of deafening\
  \ force.</p> \n    <p>Xaven's sled flipped over. The halfling hung on for his life.\
  \ He was still flying forward, the stone floor scraping his back raw as he slid.\
  \ As best he could determine, he was fractionally ahead of the falling rock. A split-second\
  \ later he was enveloped by a cloud of dust, and could see nothing.</p> \n    <p>There\
  \ was a huge crash as the sled smashed into the end of the hall, slamming straight\
  \ into the ladder. At the same instant, the ceiling directly above Xaven came loose\
  \ and began to fall apart above him. Even the walls gave way.</p> \n    <p>Still\
  \ dragged by the unseen horse team, the battered sled shot upward toward the hole\
  \ in the ceiling. The sudden torque wrenched Xaven's hands free from the handle,\
  \ but the heavy manacles dragged him behind the sled like a rag doll. He flew up\
  \ the shaft through a hail of falling rock.</p> \n    <p>Once the sled reached the\
  \ now-disintegrating foyer, it changed direction for the second time, this time\
  \ shooting out the temple entrance. With his right hand, Xaven flailed at his shackled\
  \ wrist, catching the key in its lock long enough to turn it and release himself\
  \ from the sled. He was vaguely aware that his left shoulder had dislocated and\
  \ his muscle had torn. Worse, now free from the flying sled, Xaven came crashing\
  \ down on the temple's outer steps, breaking what felt like every remaining bone\
  \ in his body. Behind him, a geyser of dust exploded outward as the temple entrance\
  \ collapsed into rubble. The dust enveloped him once more, filling his lungs and\
  \ sending him into a fit of spasmodic coughing. </p> \n    <p>Somehow, Xaven didn't\
  \ seem to mind. His inability to breathe was a testament to the fact that his lungs\
  \ had not been crushed in the rockfall. He would hurt—for a very long time—but he\
  \ would live. His coughs were part laughter.</p> \n    <p>Hrokon arrived a few minutes\
  \ later, racing up the hill on foot.</p> \n    <p>\"You alive, little buddy?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Xaven's head was the only thing he could manage to turn toward the half-orc.\
  \ \"Where are the horses?\" </p> \n    <p>\"I'd say lost forever. Once we got a\
  \ good clip, I jumped off of the wagon and let 'em go—didn't want my weight to slow\
  \ it down.\"</p> \n    <p>Xaven smiled. \"You jumped off a wagon pulled by galloping\
  \ horses going down a hill? Not bad.\"</p> \n    <p>There was an awkward silence\
  \ as Hrokon dug through his pack for his healer's kit. He wasn't much of a doctor.\
  \ \"You know, Xaven, one of these days you'll decide you can trust me.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Xaven lay on his back, looking up at the rising sun while his pain washed\
  \ over him. </p> \n    <p>Hrokon had a point. If not for the big half-orc, Xaven\
  \ would be dead. Since he wasn't, perhaps this was a fine time to start reevaluating\
  \ some things. Sensing awkwardness, Hrokon changed the subject. He rummaged through\
  \ his kit, producing the emergency potion. \"Here, drink this. It should get you\
  \ well enough for us to get back to Yanmass and find a decent healer. We just made\
  \ a lot of noise—could be there's somebody around to hear it, in which case we'll\
  \ want to be well away by the time they arrive. Tell me where you stashed that chest\
  \ from that altar in the first room, and I'll get it loaded up. You work on getting\
  \ that mud out of your lungs.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Right.\" Xaven coughed, suddenly\
  \ appreciating that their job was still far from over. \"I hid it for us just over\
  \ there before we went back inside.\" He motioned to a copse of pine and eucalyptus\
  \ further down the slope, away from the shattered temple. \"Under the blackened\
  \ boulder.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Good.\" Hrokon clapped Xaven on the shoulder and headed\
  \ off to collect the spoils, leaving his kit with the halfling. Xaven, for his part,\
  \ lay still, slowly flexing fingers and toes as the potion gradually brought feeling\
  \ back to the numb and buzzing digits. He closed his eyes. </p> \n    <p>He was\
  \ going to be okay. More than okay, in fact—he was going to be rich. From behind\
  \ the trees, he could hear Hrokon loading the altar chest onto a horse. It was forward\
  \ thinking on the half-orc's part to have brought an extra steed beyond the team\
  \ Xaven requested. The half-orc really was smarter than anyone gave him credit for—\
  including Xaven. He would make a worthy partner. And maybe, in time, a friend.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Xaven heard hoofbeats and rolled onto his side. Farther down the slope,\
  \ Hrokon was riding away at full gallop, the altar chest strapped securely behind\
  \ him on the saddle.</p> \n    <p>Xaven gave a choking laugh. \"Smarter than anyone\
  \ gave him credit for,\" indeed. Xaven had clearly taught the half-orc better than\
  \ he'd thought. Yet thanks to Hrokon, Xaven was still alive. He'd even left the\
  \ halfling his kit, which looked to have just enough food and water for him to make\
  \ it back to civilization. Perhaps, all things considered, it was a fair trade.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Xaven lay his head back, closed his eyes, and listened to the retreating\
  \ sounds of his partner.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A dapper gnome and\
