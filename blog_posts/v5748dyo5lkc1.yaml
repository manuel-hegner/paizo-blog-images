  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The Order of the Amber Die is back\
  \ with another marathon run through an Adventure Path, and this time they've picked\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\">Ruins of Azlant Adventure\
  \ Path</a>. I'm not going to spend too much time introducing this blog, but I do\
  \ want to warn readers that there are some spoilers in here. If you're a player\
  \ or just want to be surprised when you read <a href=\"/products/btpy9qya\"><em>The\
  \ Lost Outpost</em></a>, read at your own risk!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>In\
  \ case you're new to our projects or what Order of the Amber Die is all about, here's\
  \ a quick summary: We play the longest sessions in the industry, we've been through\
  \ a couple of lifetime's worth of published adventures, and we like to push the\
  \ envelope of gaming as far as it can go—and then some.</p> \n     <p>During the\
  \ Adventure Path seminar at Gen Con 50, Managing Developer Adam Daigle said Paizo\
  \ had waited ten long years to release an Azlant-themed AP, and despite not having\
  \ much of a break after <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk5x?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >The Strange Aeons Experiment</a>, we couldn't resist the call to play it. Further,\
  \ if Paizo waited this long to unveil Azlant, we needed to match the significance\
  \ with something equally monumental: We would take our game on-location. Just as\
  \ we started off “The Lost Outpost” with our characters approaching a beach, we\
  \ put nine members of the Order from different parts of the country into a New Jersey\
  \ beach house for many days of straight gaming. With this much immersion, the long\
  \ weekend was bound to end up like an episode of Survivor or Jersey Shore-gone-Pathfinder,\
  \ so we filmed portions of the escapade—and yes, we even did confessionals.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Session Stats</h2> \n     <ul>\n      <li><b>Adventure</b>: <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #121: The Lost Outpost</em></li> \n      <li><b>Marathon Length</b>:\
  \ 113 hours</li> \n      <li><b>Session Hours</b>: 51hrs, 15min</li>\n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <p>We like to give each of our projects a spin or focus, and for The Azlant\
  \ Odyssey we'll be highlighting the setting and atmosphere throughout. Submerged\
  \ ruins, forgotten islands, lore lost for millennia—it's too exciting not to detail\
  \ it as we explore. To prepare for the launch of this project, the four core players\
  \ were assigned homework: to study the Pathfinder comics and master their iconic\
  \ characters. Finally, with such a large number of colonists available for role-playing\
  \ opportunities, our GM tapped four additional members of the Order for live-NPC\
  \ roles throughout the marathon.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Highlights From The Lost Outpost</h2> \n     <ul>\n\
  \      <li>Our characters arrived on the beach to find the colony of Talmandor's\
  \ Bounty deserted and the first wave of colonists missing. During our subsequent\
  \ search, a distressed poltergeist sent our characters sprinting for the water quite\
  \ a few times. Our GM ruled that since our characters were running from the grass\
  \ to the waterline, we should leave our dice and make the mad dash across the sand\
  \ ourselves. Harder than it seemed!</li> \n      <li>Intermingling with the colonists\
  \ and their elaborate backgrounds kept us right on track with reality TV, as we\
  \ had two separate love triangles running: Anya Sandstrider the stoic Shoanti ranger\
  \ with a crush on Harcourt Carrolby, the arrogant well-to-do, who was in turn the\
  \ enemy of Leutin Calewick, the hefty blacksmith with a thing for Anya. That's all\
  \ aside from the usual Kyra and Merisiel flame, where Ramona Avandth, the expedition's\
  \ capable facilitator, added in some tension with Kyra while refuting the advances\
  \ of Antona Sedgewick—one of the colony's most prominent soldiers. Can you follow\
  \ all that drama?</li> \n      <li>A self-controlled defense mechanism of ancient\
  \ Azlant stalked the island, leaving ominous tracks that built fear in us until\
  \ the confrontation finally occurred. It consisted of thousands of tiny spheres\
  \ that could emit spikes and even knock you to the ground. Merisiel, our relic raider,\
  \ had studied its path on the island carefully, and enabled us to exploit its weakness:\
  \ it couldn't climb most objects.</li> \n      <li>During an incident involving\
  \ quicksand, Valeros the aquanaut pulled off his best rendition of Baywatch as he\
  \ ran to the rescue and dove in with his swim speed, while we sweated round-by-round\
  \ watching the drowning colonist. Even Merisiel was impressed.</li> \n      <li>Author\
  \ Jim Groves never let us get comfortable with the island or our mission, as this\
  \ adventure tested a wide array of tabletop RPG skills: social combat from Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue, roleplaying, investigation, traditional combat, underwater combat, linguistics,\
  \ and even a player's ability to adapt to a new mechanic: \"soft initiative.\" If\
  \ the rest of the Adventure Path is anything like The Lost Outpost in this regard,\
  \ we're going to find out what we're made of.</li> \n      <li>Class was in session\
  \ when we came across two celedons who wanted nothing more than to teach us about\
  \ their goddess, Acavna. The academics in our group grabbed a bench and started\
  \ taking notes, until our teachers casually mentioned that instruction would take\
  \ years to complete—and that we couldn't leave until it was over. We brainstormed\
  \ ways to cut class, but we were terrified about getting disciplined by the eternal\
  \ guardians.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ smell of salt water completely immersed us in even the most nominal role-playing\
  \ encounters. We also wanted to emphasize the role of sunlight in island survival,\
  \ so as a group we decided to get up before dawn every day and begin playing with\
  \ the sun's rays streaming in. So far, Ruins of Azlant is clearly more than just\
  \ \"the underwater AP.\" Survival has been the most important skill—used more often\
  \ than swim—and both the exploration and discovery aspects of our Odyssey left our\
  \ lore-delvers with plenty of knowledge checks throughout.</p> \n     <h2>Character\
  \ Deaths</h2> \n     <p>None! We'll leave the credit to the preparatory underwater\
  \ grid-training sessions run by our Player Captain.</p> \n     <h2>Best Quote From\
  \ Marathon 1</h2> \n     <p>Valeros (needlessly shouting): Madam, your colony is\
  \ clear!<br> Ramona Avandth: How much has this man had to drink?<br> Valeros: I've\
  \ been drinking all day.<br> Ramona (to the party): Is this true?<br> Ezren: Yes,\
  \ he has been drinking all day, but he can be trusted.</p> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>We managed to scout some of the island, but many questions remain about\
  \ why the former colonists disappeared. We did rescue and return the original expedition\
  \ leader, Rayland Arkley, and another colonist that we hope can provide more answers\
  \ in the coming days. Between adventures, we'll be taking the author's suggestion\
  \ of utilizing the downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign as we attempt to rebuild\
  \ the colony of Talmandor's Bounty.</p> \n     <h2>More Content</h2> \n     <p>For\
  \ character builds, questions about The Azlant Odyssey, additional content and more,\
