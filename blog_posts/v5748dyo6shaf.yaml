  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Pethjun tightens the bandage around her left bicep,\
  \ wincing just a bit as the fibers of the cloth meet the open wound. “So, you want\
  \ more Sewer Dragons in your Society, huh? How we gonna protect ourselves from things\
  \ like this,” Pethjun kicks the slain body of a nearby otyugh, “if you take all\
  \ our best warriors and explorers?” Trapmaster Tok and Chief Yiddlepode, standing\
  \ nearby, nod their heads and turn to their Pathfinder friend Drandle Dreng, waiting\
  \ for an answer.</p> \n     <p>“Well,” Dreng begins, “didn’t we come down here and\
  \ help you put these things down before too many kobolds got hurt? And just think\
  \ of how much stronger your tribe might become when veteran Pathfinders retire back\
  \ here, bringing their magic weapons, arcane secrets, and experience with them?\
  \ The Society and the Sewer Dragons have been allies for a long time; let’s make\
  \ it official. I’ve already convinced Valsin that we need you all now more than\
  \ ever, and you need us. Who warned you about that merchant who was giving you a\
  \ bad deal on the maps and relics you were looking to trade, eh?”</p> <a href=\"\

  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>Yiddlepode steps forward before\
  \ Pethjun can respond, drawing herself up to her full height and managing to make\
  \ it seem much more impressive than the three feet she actually stands. “You’re\
  \ a good friend, Dreng. And the Pathfinders have treated us fairly for all the years\
  \ we’ve known each other.” Yiddlepode turns to the kobolds standing nearby, many\
  \ wounded from the recent fight, but all focused intently on the current conversation.\
  \ “Spread the word! From this day forward, any Sewer Dragon who wishes to join the\
  \ Pathfinder Society may do so with my blessing. It is a large world, with much\
  \ change and much opportunity swirling around us. Let us take this opportunity to\
  \ spread our influence and gain new knowledge. Let the world to come be shaped by\
  \ dragons!”</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>As Dreng watches the cheering kobolds pump\
  \ their scaled fists into the air, a broad guffaw cracks his face in two, his head\
  \ rolling back in unrestrained mirth. “Let the world to come be shaped by dragons,\
  \ indeed” the venture-captain laughs, before a dark cloud passes across his features.\
  \ “I expect we will need nothing less than dragons on our side in the days to come.”\

  >The Pathfinder Society organized play campaign has been, since its inception, a\
  \ game where the community of players across the world can shape the stories we\
  \ tell and play a hand in determining the course of Golarion. Over the years, the\
  \ Society has completed many adventures alongside kobold allies, including both\
  \ the Sewer Dragons and other kobold tribes across the Inner Sea and beyond. It\
  \ is my pleasure to announce that, when the Advanced Player’s Guide releases in\
  \ August, kobolds will be joining the ranks of always-available ancestries for Pathfinder\
  \ Society players. We’re excited to meet the new kobold recruits in just a few short\
  \ weeks! Until then…</p> \n     <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! (And maybe set a\
  \ few traps for unwary enemies!)</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
