  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/store/v5748btpy804h\"><i>U1: Gallery of Evil</i></a> takes\
  \ place against the backdrop of the largest city in Golarion: Absalom. This burgeoning\
  \ metropolis is filled to the brim with people from all walks of life across three\
  \ continents. Easily the most cosmopolitan city in the world, Absalom must expect\
  \ the unexpected. In the jaded manner common to many large cities, nothing really\
  \ surprises them.</p> \n   <p>While we intend to unveil more about our iconic major\
  \ city over the course of the next several months, for now we are going to limit\
  \ ourselves to one district at a time. The idea is to enable the readers to drop\
  \ these districts into whatever major city they use in their own campaigns, while\
  \ slowly building up Absalom's identity, history, and culture. In time, this metropolis\
  \ will become one of the major centerpieces of our entire campaign setting, and\
  \ in <i>Gallery of Evil</i>, we give you the first of Absalom's districts to be\
  \ revealed: the Ivy District. </p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/content/GameMasteryModules/7.-DariusFinch.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>As one of the oldest\
  \ districts in the city, the Ivy District sits a good distance from Absalom's outer\
  \ walls. Its tranquil parks, flowering, ivy-lined streets, industrious mercantile\
  \ and artisan zones, and upper-class homes have been blessed with relatively little\
  \ disruption from the countless sieges that have shattered against the city walls\
  \ and seaside cliffs surrounding the Isle of Kortos. The Ivy District is the hub\
  \ of culture and art within Absalom and, some might venture, the greatest influence\
  \ on the styles and trends of its neighboring kingdoms. </p> \n   <p>Winding cobbled\
  \ stone streets and hard-packed dirt roads, separated by narrow drainage canals\
  \ that eventually empty into the sea, wend their way through the district. Decorative\
  \ bridges connect numerous streets with one another, each one decorated somewhat\
  \ differently from the next, with bas relief sculptures, murals, or even tiled mosaics\
  \ appearing seemingly at random. Its streets are among the busiest in the city,\
  \ save only the market and dock districts. </p> \n   <p>The Ivy District is the\
  \ most popular location in Absalom among those who appreciate the arts and the finest\
  \ products and entertainment gold can buy. Because of the Ivy District's reputation\
  \ for beauty, fine art, and masterwork trade goods (fine blades, stylish and top-quality\
  \ armor, renowned gem cutters and jewelers, exquisite clothing, carpentry products,\
  \ and so on), it is also very tempting for thieves. The district has a surprisingly\
  \ low theft rate, however, thanks to the efforts of a well-paid District Watch and\
  \ the Brotherhood of Abadar, which patrols the streets looking for signs of unlawful\
  \ activities and disturbances. </p> \n   <p>One of the most significant areas of\
  \ the Ivy District is The Ivy District Park and Topiary Menagerie. This public park\
  \ is filled with beautiful oak groves, pines, beech trees, weeping willows, cedars,\
  \ and a wide variety of more exotic flora. Flower gardens and fruit-bearing trees\
  \ line the neat dirt paths that wind through the park, and a large pond dominates\
  \ its center. At places where the water is narrow enough, gorgeous bridges arch\
  \ across its placid surface. Ducks, geese, colorful fish, and frogs live in the\
  \ pond. Other wildlife lives here too, such as squirrels, owls, foxes, and hares.\
  \ The druidic members of the Perfumers' Conglomerate tend all the life here. Through\
  \ continual effort they manage to keep the trees, grass, and flowers pruned and\
  \ blooming all year round. The sparkling clean water and happy and healthy wildlife\
  \ are a testament to their hard work. </p> \n   <p>One of the park's main attractions\
  \ is located at the center of a tall hedge maze: the topiary menagerie. Shrubs and\
  \ bushes have been expertly pruned and trained into shapes of animals, people, and\
  \ even rare and magical beasts. Although this wonderful horticultural menagerie\
  \ seems innocent enough, the park's attendant druids recently discovered a group\
  \ of teenage kids dead in the surrounding maze and a topiary unicorn missing from\
  \ the menagerie. The stab wounds on the bodies were enough to confirm their suspicions\
  \ of the missing unicorn's involvement, but they haven't determined how it happened\
  \ or what happened to the missing topiary killer. </p> \n   <p>Jeremy Walker <br>Assistant\
