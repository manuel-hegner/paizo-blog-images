  artist: "some sort of fear effect/spell and running terrified into the dark; one\
    \ of the villains, down to about 1 hit point, turning to the main antagonist and\
    \ pleading for help, only to have the villain reply, \"Your sacrifice will be\
    \ remembered!\" and then torching him—along with us—with burning hands; our dwarf\
    \ fighter running after said antagonist while he fled, pulling out his throwing\
    \ axe and ending his movement just in range, and then hurling it into the back\
    \ of his skull, just as he was about to vanish out the door, slaying him and thus\
    \ concluding the adventure. All in all, a fun adventure. It was also a lot of\
    \ fun playtesting the latest version of the Pathfinder rules, which I really enjoyed.\
    \ I'm not sure if we'll get to participate in the playtests for the rest of the\
    \ AP, but I can say I'm really excited to find out what happens next... ♪We are\
    \ the champions, my friends...♪ Hank Woon Editorial Intern"
