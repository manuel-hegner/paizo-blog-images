  articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the final blog of Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles! Yay! You did it! You made it to the final adventure, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy98af\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Deck 6: From Hell's Heart</em></a>,\
  \ and it's basically the best thing since sliced bread. Scratch that, I don't really\
  \ like bread... it's the best thing since Grumpy Cat. Yeah, it's really that good.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Anyway, I'm really excited for you to play these scenarios and I'm really\
  \ excited to be done writing blogs for a while. Like, so glad that I don't remember\
  \ that there's a blog to write until the night before I have to hand it over. Zomg,\
  \ editors who deal with me are the best people ever. EVER. Anyway, this is my last\
  \ chance to make you all read about a bunch of nonsense mixed in with some useful\
  \ info about Skull &amp; Shackles. These are the things you need to know about RIGHT\
  \ MEOW that may or may not be related to the game in any way.</p> \n     <ol>\n\
  \      <li>Mangroves: These are the most amazing and remarkable plants. They do\
  \ so much for our world and have been getting destroyed at an alarming rate. Seriously,\
  \ learn about them and help protect them.</li> \n      <li><a href=\"http://FunnyOrDie.com/m/9i20\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">This video</a> of Billy Eichner, Michelle Obama, and Big Bird.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><a href=\"http://gamestorm.org\" target=\"_blank\">GameStorm</a>:\
  \ Some number of us (including me) will be at this convention in the middle of March.\
  \ Come see us and play games!</li>\n     </ol> \n     <p>All right, now that that's\
  \ out of my system, let's get into the part where I talk about the game.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>OSS (Obligatory Shark Section)</h2> \n     <p>We now live in a post-Left\
  \ Shark world. If you didn't watch the Superb Owl (bwahahaha, I'm such a hoot!)\
  \ and also didn't watch the halftime show (which was a hoot-and-a-half!) and somehow\
  \ you live under a gigantic rock and missed out on the whole Left Shark phenomenon,\
  \ let me teach you about that.</p> \n     <p>This is the video of <a href=\"http://dailymotion.com/video/x2g6jpw\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the whole show</a>. Now, if you're smart, you'll just watch\
  \ the whole thing. But if you're pressed for time you can skip ahead to 4:23. And\
  \ bask in the glory of the sharks. BASK, I SAY! Anyway, this caused me to purchase\
  \ some cookie cutters and learn that I am as bad at frosting cookies as Left Shark\
  \ is at memorizing dance sequences.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \   <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150303-Cookies.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150303-Cookies_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>After I made three abominations, I decided an eye and a frown\
  \ were enough frosting.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>But anyway, we now live in a\
  \ world that has seen the glory of the Left Shark and because of that (and because\
  \ last time you didn't get a shark in the shark section) consider this an Obligatory\
  \ Super Sized Shark Section! OSSSS!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \   <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-WeresharkPirate.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Is it a man? Is it a shark? EVEN BETTER, IT'S BOTH!</i>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>It's a Wereshark Pirate. Is this not the best? Well, I guess\
  \ it's not the best if you aren't ready for a fight. You can't evade Wereshark Pirates,\
  \ and if the top card of the blessings discard pile <i>isn't</i> a Blessing of the\
  \ Gods, well, you can kiss that 26 goodbye because now it's a 32. Whoa. You also\
  \ better have your buckles swashed because if your check to defeat doesn't have\
  \ the Swashbuckling trait, the Wereshark Pirate won't be impressed with you and\
  \ he'll knock the top card off the blessings deck. Not cool, brah.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ if that wasn't enough shark for you... here's another!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-HorrusRiptooth.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>RWARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRCHOMP</i>\n   \
  \  </div> \n     <p>I could hear you guys through the Internet before I even finished\
  \ writing this and I know half of you were like, \"Bawbawbaw, the Wereshark Pirate\
  \ is too easy\" and so I got you this. Good old Cap'n Riptooth. Like the normal\
  \ Wereshark Pirate, he cannot be evaded and if the top card of the blessings discard\
  \ pile is not a Blessing of the Gods, the difficulty is increased by 6. So, that\
  \ could bump him from a 28 then 32, to a 34 then 38. THEN. Did you see that \"then\"\
  ?! DID YOU? Well, it's there. Anyway, there's that. And then there's also that last\
  \ power. \"Before attempting each check, randomly choose another character at your\
  \ location\" is almost never the start of something good. Maybe this time you'll\
  \ be lucky and that will end with \"to recharge a card from their discard pile.\"\
  \ Except you aren't lucky and that doesn't happen. What actually happens is that\
  \ the chosen character recharges a card and their Strength die is the amount by\
  \ which you increase the difficulty of the first check against ol' Rippy—pardon\
  \ me, Cap'n Rippy—as he picks up that character and bashes him into you. And then\
  \ you do that again for the second check. Best case scenario, nobody is there and\
  \ nothing happens. Worst case scenario, you're standing next to Oloch and the difficulty\
  \ is increased by d12. Oofda. Of course, maybe Oloch is standing next to you and\
  \ you're Lem and Oloch can take on one of these checks and only add d4 points of\
  \ Lem-bashing. Still, that's a whole lotta nonsense, isn't it? Good luck!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Ok, for the two of you out there who still feel like this shark section\
  \ isn't super sized enough, maybe this will convince you.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>YOU get a shark head, and YOU get a shark head, and YOU GET\
  \ A SHARK HEAD!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>It's less scary if it feels like Oprah\
  \ is giving you the shark heads, right? I don't think she can do anything about\
  \ the tentacles, though. Anyway, this is a Lusca. It comes with three checks. THREE.\
  \ And boy is it a real jerk if it is undefeated. Everybody at your location gets\
  \ damage and then (there's that pesky \"then\" again!) everybody better make a Constitution\
  \ or Fortitude 11 check, which should totally be easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy because\
  \ this is Adventure 6, or bury 1d4 cards from the top of his or her deck. Yipes.\
  \ I hope you put your shark-beating pants on this morning.</p> \n     <h2>Other\
  \ Sweet Stuff</h2> \n     <p>This set has more ridiculous things than a Lusca has\
  \ heads and tentacles. Seriously, trying to narrow down cards to show you is harder\
  \ here than it has ever been before. So I'm going to show you one scary thing and\
  \ one happy thing. Scary first.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Dear reader, meet Brinebones. Brinebones, meet your snack.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>I love Brinebones. I don't think he counts as a scary thing\
  \ to show you but that's because he and I are pals. And I'm totally sane. At any\
  \ rate, he's kind of terrifying. 32 then 32 is no joke. And neither are those immunities.\
  \ Least jokey of all is the damage he is going to deal to characters at the randomly\
  \ occupied location that get chosen. You want to know the real reason Brinebones\
  \ zaps you? He just wants to give you a little jolt that makes you all jittery.\
  \ That way, when he actually gets around to eating you, you're all spazzy in his\
  \ mouth like Pop Rocks. True story.</p> \n     <p>And now for the happy!</p> \n\

  \ Triceratops, who I have named Clompykins, just galumphs around giving you 3d6\
  \ to combat checks during an exploration. And then everybody at your location buries\
  \ a card because THEY CAN'T HANDLE THE GALUMPH! Anyway, if you can't figure out\
  \ that Clompykins is crazy useful when you know that a multi-check monster is ahead,\
  \ then you don't deserve him. He'll stay with me. Clompykins likes me best anyway.</p>\

  \ Shackles. You have no idea how much I wanted to show you what was in store for\
  \ you in \"Last Stand of the Hurricane King\" but I really think it's important\
  \ for you to be scared and excited and all the emotions when you open the box at\
  \ home. So, again, penultimate scenario. This is a good one to show you though.\
  \ You've already met Brinebones who plays an exciting role here. Before we get back\
  \ to him, let's introduce you to my favorite lounge band, Tsadok Goldtooth and the\
  \ Draugr Captains!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-Goldtooth.jpg\"\

  \ one!</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Mr. Goldtooth is not here to make friends or help\
  \ people. In fact, before anything else happens, two of the characters at your location\
  \ are going to be dealt 1d4+1 Ranged Combat damage. This is a lot more fun if there's\
  \ a group of you and you're all bunched together because let's face it, when there\
  \ are two or fewer of you, \"two random characters\" becomes a whole lot less random.\
  \ And don't even think about using your spells on him, as that Arcane and Divine\
  \ stuff is just a nuisance to him and makes everything more difficult. And of course,\
  \ whether not you succeed at those two checks to defeat, he's going to pick two\
  \ more random people to deal some Ranged Combat damage to.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6016-DraugrCaptain.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>At least this guy only has one check to defeat?</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Remember how you're really good at this game and you got yourself a\
  \ perfect hand for dealing with big fights? Well, the Draugr Captain doesn't. You\
  \ can just go ahead and recharge all but one of those perfect cards and draw as\
  \ many as you recharged. Now, instead of that hand that you knew exactly how to\
  \ use, you've got a bunch of cards you didn't plan on having. Unless of course you\
  \ didn't have any cards left in your deck. Then you'll just draw all the cards you\
  \ recharged. That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for you. (Pro-tip:\
  \ It probably doesn't, but good for you with that high-risk, high-reward craziness!)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now, I know you're thinking that dealing with Tsadok Goldtooth and the\
  \ Draugr Captains seems pretty straightforward. And some of you probably thought,\
  \ \"That sounds easy\" which is why we are BRINGING THE WRATH OF BRINEBONES DOWN\
  \ UPON YOU. You won't know when and you won't know where.</p> \n     <p>That's right,\
  \ while you're busy trying to close locations and corner the villain, Brinebones\
  \ is lurking inside the blessings deck. He could show up at any time and there's\
  \ no limit to how many times he might show up. Brinebones has an all-access pass\
  \ to watching you fumble around trying to shank Tsadok Goldtooth. Isn't it terrifying\
  \ to know that on any turn it doesn't matter where you are or what you have in your\
  \ hand because Brinebones might show up and turn you into his latest round of Pop\
  \ Rocks? I think it's glorious.</p> \n     <p>I think this is a good place to end\
  \ this blog. It's been a pleasure writing for all of you and I hope that the end\
  \ of Skull &amp; Shackles is as fun for you to play as it was for us to write!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>May the winds blow favorably upon you!</p> \n     <p>Gaby Weidling<br>\
