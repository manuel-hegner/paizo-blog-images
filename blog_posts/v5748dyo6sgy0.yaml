  \ a great guy and amazing designer, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li9y?Pauls-Best-Character-Ever-Lini\"\
  >once wrote all about how Rise of the Runelords Lini was the best character ever</a>.\
  \ A secret I did not reveal when I wrote <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhf9?Keiths-Best-Character-Ever-Enora\"\
  >my best character blog</a> is that I agreed with him, but it would have been a\
  \ lot less interesting if we both wrote a blog about Lini. The next dirty little\
  \ secret [note: not really a secret] is that Paul and I could both be called power\
  \ gamers.</p> \n     <p>I once handed a high-level Rise of the Runelords Lini to\
  \ a friend to play for a session and she asked what her character was good at, to\
  \ which I replied, “everything.” She could recharge animals to explore, reveal animals\
  \ for 1d4+4 to all checks, and carry some of the best spells in the game like Augury\
  \ and Cure. Hard to beat.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_LiniSSCharacterFront.jpg\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Skull &amp; Shackles Lini gives up her bonus to every check\
  \ in the world for even more amazing mastery of all Animal allies. She’s also better\
  \ at using her version of the RPG’s wild shape ability to use a d12 for her Strength\
  \ or Dexterity. With the right support, she can be an exploration machine, and she’\
  s got two of the most important skills for <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i>: Fortitude\

  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Oddly, the Lini with the most animals is also\
  \ the only one pictured without Droogami.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Druid Class\
  \ Deck</i> Lini explored a pretty different direction from the previous two Linis.\
  \ No longer attempting to emulate wild shape, she went all in on wielding her animals\
  \ as her weapons. Her skills got a bit of a bump, making her pretty reliable at\
  \ recharging spells and combat. If you go with her Pack Lord role and fill her deck\
  \ with animals, you really do feel that “Everything is cool when you’re part of\
  \ a team.”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreLiniFront.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Lini, Character 0. Lini is a friend to all the savage beasts of the forest,\
  \ soothing their hungers and redirecting their baser instincts. With her snow leopard\
  \ Droogami nearby, she collects sticks from every forest she has visited, a wooden\
  \ road map of her travels; should she settle down, they may become a house.\"></a>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Lini’s new portrait really lets you see\
  \ the details in her hair and face.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>One of the first\
  \ changes I made to <i>Core Set</i> Lini was to replace her Knowledge skill with\
  \ Perception. It fit better for how I’ve seen every druid in the RPG, as well as\
  \ the ways we tend to use Perception and Knowledge in the ACG. I knew that I wanted\
  \ to give her a power like Class Deck Lini, because in play it feels so much more\
  \ like you are actually using your menagerie of friends. I also knew that I wanted\
  \ to stop worrying about armor and weapon proficiency with her.</p> \n     <div\

  \ 13px;\">Animals help with all kinds of checks. A fair number involve mauling your\
  \ enemies, but not all!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Lini benefited a lot from Core’\
  s focus on local teamwork. Her allies in Core and Curse are far more likely to be\
  \ able to benefit her friends, and her power lets her cycle them more quickly back\
  \ to her hand. She can also add a d4 to every Animal check at her location, helping\
  \ everyone gather animal friends and defeat Animal banes, and also helping Lini’\
  s own combat checks.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreAllyDroogami.jpg\"\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Droogami is a great reason to be Lini. Aspect of the\
  \ Monkey just makes me smile every time I see it.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>She\
  \ also gets to start with a level 1 card, the only named ally in Core: Droogami.\
  \ Droogami helps out some of Lini’s favorite kinds of checks. She also gets to recharge\
  \ or shuffle Droogami back into her deck for mobile explores, so you’re likely to\
  \ want to keep Droogami forever. Convenient, since Droogami is an important part\
  \ of her backstory and artwork.</p> \n     <p>Because she doesn’t need to worry\
  \ too much about Attack spells or weapons, Lini can focus on utility spells like\
  \ Aspect of the Monkey. In addition to bearing a truly excellent piece of artwork\
  \ by Vicky Yarova, it’s a solid bonus for Lini to display for the entire turn, and\
  \ her extra die for Animal checks applies to its recharge check (as well as any\
  \ other Animal spells you might pull from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdn\"\
  >Ultimate Wilderness</a> and/or the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sxh\"\

  ></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Her art’s got armor and a weapon, so\
  \ Core Lini does too. You can learn to love them, though.</p> \n     </div> \n \
  \    <p>I wanted to stick with a more balanced spread of boons than RotR Lini had,\
  \ at least in part because I knew we were going to make weapons and armors better\
  \ cards for her. Now she can display armor and take a sling or knife to assist with\
  \ combat checks, or a quarterstaff or bolas to avoid some banes. Hide Armor really\
  \ shines in Lini’s hands as a great proactive choice, adding a big bonus to her\
  \ check. It won’t absorb a sudden big hit as well as Chain Mail, but if instead\
  \ you need to turn into a bear and tear an enemy apart, it’s got (or at least is\
  \ on) your back.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092719_CoreRoleWildWhisperer.jpg\"\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\">I assume all Lini roles from now on need to start with\
  \ double W’s. Suggestions welcome!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>As a Wild Whisperer,\
  \ Lini focuses on her Animal companions, improving all Animal checks at her location,\
  \ especially her combat checks using them. She also has a few powers (themed around\
  \ using wild shape) to improve her physical skills or gain Acrobatics and Fortitude.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Her World Walker role instead focuses on her surroundings, adding to\
  \ all checks at Wild locations (a common location trait in Core and Curse) and moving\
  \ more easily. Along with her wider travels, she also becomes resistant to poison\
  \ and elemental damage (useful for survival in some of the more extreme corners\
  \ of Golarion and beyond) and learns to use herbalism to remove scourges from her\
  \ party.</p> \n     <p>That’s our new Lini! She’s self-reliant and versatile and\
  \ feels like a great druid in play. </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
