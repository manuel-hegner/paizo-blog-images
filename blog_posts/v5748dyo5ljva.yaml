  ><a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a> is a complete roleplaying game, and can\
  \ be played on its own without ever referring to the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. It is based on Pathfinder, of course, and shares\
  \ many similarities with its older cousin, but in many cases Starfinder handles\
  \ specific issues differently than Pathfinder. We've mentioned several times that\
  \ Pathfinder is easily integrated into Starfinder, and that there's some level of\
  \ compatibility between the two games, but we haven't been very specific on exactly\
  \ how easy it'll be to add Starfinder cybernetics to Pathfinder fire giants, or\
  \ port Pathfinder character classes and races into a Starfinder campaign. Those\
  \ questions are likely to take more than one blog post to cover, but we wanted to\
  \ at least begin going into greater detail about how we envision these two games\
  \ working together.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Dwarf.jpg\"\

  \ by Hugh Pindur</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Starfinder should feel very familiar\
  \ to experienced Pathfinder players, and much of the overall play experience is\
  \ similar. Despite changes like iterative attacks for high base attack bonuses being\
  \ replaced by universal full attacks allowing two attacks both at -4, or breaking\
  \ hit points into two pools of Stamina Points and Hit Points, most of the general\
  \ rules of the game are close enough to make it easy to see how to convert a specific\
  \ option from one class to another. The most common specific tweaks to combat are\
  \ covered in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, specifically Chapter 13: Pathfinder Legacy.\
  \ This chapter presents the information a GM needs to convert between the two games\
  \ when dealing with questions of bonus types, actions in combat, CMB/CMD vs EAC/KAC,\
  \ damage, ability scores, and so on. A GM wishing to take griefgalls from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9g9x?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-5\"><em>Bestiary 5</em></a>\
  \ and use them for an invasion of Absalom Station should have no trouble adapting\
  \ the monster to Starfinder use. In fact, given that both Starfinder and Pathfinder\
  \ inhabit the same fictional universe, we specifically designed the game so that\
  \ you could use monsters from one in the other on the fly, with little conversion—\
  after all, a keketar protean is a keketar protean regardless of system, and this\
  \ way we can focus on creating cool new creatures for Starfinder rather than just\
  \ converting all the old standards.</p> \n    <p>For things like magic items, spells,\
  \ feats, equipment, and other player-facing options, conversion can be more difficult\
  \ and have more hidden pitfalls. One of the hardest questions a GM will need to\
  \ answer is if something from one game system even <i>should</i> be introduced to\
  \ the other. For instance, Starfinder and Pathfinder make different assumptions\
  \ about when in a campaign various options first appear, and when they become commonplace.\
  \ This means that introducing a new options from one of the games into a campaign\
  \ using the other set of rules can have consequences well beyond how well the two\
  \ sets of game rules interact mechanically.</p> \n    <p>For example, every first-level\
  \ Starfinder character is likely to have armor that protects against extremes of\
  \ temperature and pressure, and provides breathable air, thus protecting them from\
  \ gaseous poisons or even complete vacuum for up to 24 hours. In Pathfinder, that\
  \ level of protection isn't available until much higher level, and many characters\
  \ never acquire it. While the rules for extreme environments are similar enough\
  \ that a character from either game can make the appropriate saving throws (and\
  \ understand how to apply the effects of failing those saves), a Pathfinder game\
  \ that introduces items and abilities designed for Starfinder is going to bypass\
  \ or neutralize a lot of common Pathfinder threats and encounters. Similar issues\
  \ arise when discussing movement, flight, senses, ranged attacks, access to energy\
  \ damage, and even the ease with which non-spellcasters can access magic abilities.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Those differences in assumptions alter how items and options from one\
  \ game will impact campaigns using the other game's base rules. Even with the differences\
  \ between Armor Class rules in the two games, it's not hard to figure out how a\
  \ suit of ceremonial vesk overplate with a jet pack and infrared sensors would operate\
  \ in Pathfinder—but the impact it would have on a typical Pathfinder game is much\
  \ higher than the low level of those options in Starfinder would suggest.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Similarly, the two games also use different methods to produce the numerical\
  \ values characters and monsters use to interact with one another. This often includes\
  \ math that is (quite intentionally) behind the scenes, and thus not particularly\
  \ obvious. For example, Starfinder does its best to not require characters to constantly\
  \ get higher and higher enhancement bonuses to attack rolls, damage, and armor class,\
  \ or resistance bonuses to saving throws. As a result, there's no option to create\
  \ a <i>+1 plasma cannon</i> in Starfinder, since the additional math isn't needed.\
  \ Thus adding magic to Starfinder gear is always about gaining some cool new option\
  \ or ability rather than just numbers. It would be easy to determine how to port\
  \ such rules over from Pathfinder, but doing so would create imbalances, since the\
  \ new game is designed to function without most pure bonus-boosters.</p> \n    <p>For\
  \ races, these issues are much less likely to cause significant issues. We already\
  \ provide full Starfinder write-ups for dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, half-elves\
  \ and half-orcs in the Pathfinder Legacy chapter of Starfinder. Those races still\
  \ exist in the Pact Worlds, they just aren't as common as they were in Golarion-focused\
  \ games using Pathfinder. Converting other Pathfinder races should be straightforward,\
  \ and unlikely to cause major problems. In fact, some races that don't fit well\
  \ in most Pathfinder games may be less disruptive to a Starfinder campaign!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Pathfinder classes are going to be the element it is most difficult to\
  \ move to a Starfinder campaign, and require some work on the part of a GM, both\
  \ in understanding how Starfinder handles various kinds of abilities and in looking\
  \ for places where problems might crop up from unbalanced bonuses that Starfinder\
  \ doesn't need or abilities that lack the support in one game system or the other.\
  \ Of course, we tried to make sure common character tropes could be created in Starfinder,\
  \ even if they're built differently than their Pathfinder equivalents. While there's\
  \ no straight-up paladin analogue in Starfinder, a soldier with the priest theme,\
  \ phrenic adept archetype, and various psychic power feats can certainly take the\
  \ role of a religious champion with access to both martial skills and magic powers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If nothing but the original Pathfinder classes will satisfy, however,\
  \ the Pathfinder Legacy section gives what guidance we could manage for GMs wanting\
  \ to port Pathfinder classes directly over. Questions of key ability scores, stamina\
  \ points, skill points, weapon and armor proficiency and specialization, and other\
  \ common core game mechanics are easy, and we mostly spell them out. When it comes\
  \ to tougher questions like class features, eidolons, animal companions, familiars,\
  \ class spell lists and 7th-9th level spells, bardic performance, and even flurry\
  \ of blows we give advice, but it'll be up to each GM to decide exactly how to implement\
  \ that advice.</p> \n    <p>In many ways, all of Pathfinder is like a series of\
  \ \"Starfinder Unchained\" books—optional rules and subsystems a GM can adapt or\
  \ not as appropriate for their game and their own desire to tinker. Our first priority\
  \ was always to make Starfinder the best game it could be on its own, with as many\
  \ robust options as we could make fit without overcomplicating it. Yet its underlying\
  \ game engine remains close enough to Pathfinder that anyone who wants to adopt\
  \ or convert materials from those sources to Starfinder should be able to do so\
  \ with a minimum of effort.</p> \n    <p>Owen KC Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
