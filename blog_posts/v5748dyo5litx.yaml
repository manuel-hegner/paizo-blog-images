  PaizoCon 2016 Announcements!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Sunday, May 29, 2016</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last night's\
  \ PaizoCon Preview Banquet was an amazing event, full of exciting new reveals and\
  \ announcements, including the unveiling of Paizo's next roleplaying game project,\
  \ <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a>, the next hardcover volumes of the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game, and where Pathfinders will be headed next in Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path and Pathfinder Society organized play. I cannot stress enough how fun and\
  \ palpable the excitement is during the Banquet, and how cool it is to see folks\
  \ react in person. But, if you didn't make it out to the show, read on!</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Dark <em>Things</em> in the Deep, and Shadows Around the Corner</h2> \n\
  \    <p>While we're a couple weeks out from showing off the thrilling contents of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcx\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em></a>,\
  \ rest assured, the forces of darkness and a tenuous grasp of sanity are abound\
  \ for your game!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/PZO1135-Ghost.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>We also announced the next <i>*two*</i> Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game volumes at one time! Look out for the <em>Pathfinder RPG Villain Codex</em>,\
  \ full of villainous gangs, demon knights, merry outlaws, sinister cults, new rules\
  \ for each organization, and tips for using these foes in your own game later this\
  \ year! And in Spring 2017, you'll have no problem pulling together an encounter\
  \ on the fly with the <em>Pathfinder RPG Encounter Codex</em>, which will contain\
  \ encounters from levels 1-20, with more details to come.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ his <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5litw\">announcement blog</a> for more details\
  \ about Starfinder, which will release in August 2017.</p> \n    <h2>A Return to\
  \ Korvosa, and a Journey to Dungeons Yet to be Found</h2> \n    <p>Fans of the classic\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne Adventure Path</a> may recognize a few familiar faces in the lineup below,\
  \ found in the new <a href=\"/products/btpy9kg6\"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne\

  \    </div> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange\
  \ Aeons Adventure Path</a> launches in just a couple months at Gen Con 2016. In\
  \ Strange Aeons, heroes will be up against cosmic horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos,\
  \ new monsters, mind-shattering terrors, and explore far beyond the known lands\
  \ of Golarion. More information and previews will be available on the Paizo blog\
  \ as we get closer!</p> \n    <p>We also announced the Adventure Path that will\
  \ be following Strange Aeons at the Banquet, and I got some help from star story-teller\
  \ and Developer Crystal Fraiser to give you an introduction to The Ironfang Invasion:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>When the PCs witness their hometown of Phaendar destroyed\
  \ in the first steps of an all-out war of conquest, they begin a quest that leads\
  \ them from desperate survival to heroes of legend as they push back against the\
  \ monstrous Ironfang Legion. This ruthless army—helmed by the hobgoblin General\
  \ Azaersi and empowered by an ancient artifact known as the Onyx Key—intend to claim\
  \ both Nirmathas and Molthune while the isolated nations bicker with one another.\
  \ The heroes' quest will take them deep into the fey-haunted Fangwood Forest, to\
  \ the craggy bluffs of western Nirmathas, and delve deep into the earth to explore\
  \ the Darklands. Can a small band of refugees grow into champions and push back\
  \ against Azaersi's horde, or will the Ironfang Invasion give way to and Ironfang\
  \ nation?</p> \n     <p>The Ironfang Invasion calls back to classic adventures,\
  \ focusing on exploring the unknown and confronting the fantastic, all to stop a\
  \ monstrous enemy from wiping out the good people of Nirmathas and Molthune. The\
  \ PCs will delve into dungeons, siege well-guarded keeps, explore the wilderness,\
  \ and battle some of the most iconic creatures from the 40-year history of fantasy\
  \ RPGs.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <h2>Society Happenings</h2> \n    <p>Organized Play Coordinator\
  \ Tonya Woldridge proudly announced Season 8 of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild: The Year of the Stolen Storm. Beginning at Gen Con 2016, Pathfinders of\
  \ all levels will be able to travel to the Elemental Planes, clash with extraplanar\
  \ rivals, and harness the raw energies of the Inner Sphere. Joining the Society\
  \ in this endeavor will be a host of genie-kin as ifrits, oreads, sylphs, and undines\
  \ become always available for play in the organized play campaign. To help kick\
  \ off Season 8, the team will also release a complete set of updated Faction Journal\
  \ Cards. Also look for new Pathfinder Academy—an updated and expanded Kids' Track\
  \ program for young gamers—debuting at Gen Con!</p> \n    <p>The Adventure Card\
  \ Guild's Season of the Runelords is in full swing, including a host of new rewards\
  \ to distribute at upcoming conventions. Once we've defeated the Runelords, we're\
  \ launching a new mini-season, Season of the Goblin, that follows the events of\
  \ the <em>We Be Goblins</em> adventures. The much-anticipated <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> hits stores\
  \ shortly after that, and the team has announced that the Season of the Mummy will\
  \ be quick to follow. Several new authors are lending their talents to the upcoming\
  \ Adventure Card Guild scenarios, including Amanda Hamon Kunz, Jason Keeley, Tonya\
  \ Woldridge, and Linda Zayas-Palmer.</p> \n    <p>Pathfinder Society agents, stay\
  \ tuned for a more detailed update from the PFS team about these announcements on\
  \ Tuesday, June 1st!</p> \n    <h2>Publisher Previews</h2> \n    <p>During the Banquet,\
  \ Erik unveiled a number of new sculpts for the line of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles miniatures</a>. However, folks are going to have to sit tight\
  \ for his preview blog this upcoming Friday for images of the just-announced sculpts\
  \ from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> release.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We've still got another day of PaizoCon 2016! Until we meet again!</p>\
