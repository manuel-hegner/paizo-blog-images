  \ <p class=\"date\">by Gary Kloster</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Gods and Crocodiles</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Outside,\
  \ the children of Thirty Trees laughed and their parents talked, monkeys chattered\
  \ in the canopy and birds sang to the morning sun. But inside the little house that\
  \ Jiri shared with Oza, the only sound that mattered was the muted clicks of the\
  \ clay pots her teacher was packing into his bag.</p> \n    <p>\"They think I'll\
  \ burn the village down.\" Jiri swung her feet and her hammock stirred beneath her,\
  \ an unsteady motion that matched her mood. </p> \n    <p>\"They don't think that.\"\
  \ Oza, shaman of Thirty Trees, pulled the ties of his bag tight. \"Well, not all\
  \ of them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Most of them.\" Jiri's feet kicked too hard, and her\
  \ hammock tipped. Used to its treachery, she dropped out before it could dump her.\
  \ \"They don't trust me. They only made me a Mosa because you wanted them to, and\
  \ they love you. But I'm not you, Oza.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thank the spirits.\" Oza\
  \ stood, the short braids of his graying hair brushing against the baskets of dried\
  \ herbs and roots that hung overhead. \"If there were two of me, we'd need a bigger\
  \ house.\"`</p> \n    <p>Jiri frowned up at her teacher. She didn't like being reminded\
  \ that her growth had stopped well before she had wanted it to, leaving her shorter\
  \ than any other adult in Thirty Trees. \"You'd have to make it bigger, or you'd\
  \ choke on all the old-man farts,\" she grumbled.</p> \n    <p>Oza laughed, and\
  \ Jiri smiled a little at the sound, but inside...</p> \n    <p><i>They don't trust\
  \ me.</i> Her eyes rose to the cone of their roof. They had replaced the thatch\
  \ that had burned, but she could still see the charred beams from that night. <i>One\
  \ nightmare, and I almost killed us.</i></p> \n    <p>Oza's laughter faded when\
  \ he saw her gaze shift, and his face grew serious. \"It's been almost a year, Jiri,\
  \ and that was the last time.\"</p> \n    <p>Oza was right. Almost a year had passed\
  \ since that night Jiri had woken in terror from her dream of being trapped somewhere\
  \ dark, somewhere deep, and seen the flames birthed by her anger and fear dancing\
  \ overhead. But she still remembered that surge of joy, of triumph, that had flooded\
  \ through her at the sight of the fire twisting like red and yellow vines through\
  \ the thatch. She also remembered how that triumph and joy had crumbled into horror\
  \ when she realized what she had done. </p> \n    <p><i>If it hadn't been raining,\
  \ if Oza hadn't been ready with his magic, the whole house would have burned. Maybe\
  \ the whole village.</i></p> \n    <p>Jiri had worked so hard since then. Practicing\
  \ the meditations that Oza had taught her, walking the spirit world with him, learning\
  \ to control her magic and her ability to call the spirits to her, to bargain with\
  \ them for their power. She had learned control. The water bucket no longer sat\
  \ full beside Oza's hammock. But...</p> \n    <p><i>The spirit of fire is always\
  \ there, waiting, so eager for me to call it, so eager to serve. To burn, and destroy.</i>\
  \ Jiri rubbed her hands together, hands that should have been marked with scars\
  \ from all the times she had burned herself with her magic as a child. Oza had always\
  \ been there to heal her, though, to fix the damage that she had caused. And now\
  \ he was going, leaving her alone for the first time that she could remember. Jiri\
  \ realized heat was gathering in the fists her hands had made, and the feel of it\
  \ was comforting and terrifying all at once.</p> \n    <p>She breathed, in and out,\
  \ focusing on herself, separating her spirit from the fire, putting its bright magic\
  \ to the side. When she had control again, she looked up and found Oza's eyes on\
  \ her, serious and patient.</p> \n    <p>\"Mosa Jiri Maju,\" he said. \"There will\
  \ always be those who don't trust you. What matters is that you trust yourself.\
  \ Like I trust you.\" Oza brushed back Jiri's long braids with a calloused hand.\
  \ \"You are strong in magic. You may be stronger than me someday. That's a dangerous\
  \ blessing, and there will be times it feels like a curse. But your spirit is good.\
  \ You will be a great shaman for your people.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Even if they're not\
  \ sure they want to be <i>my</i> people?\" Jiri asked.</p> \n    <p>\"They may not\
  \ have that choice,\" Oza said. He smiled again, though his eyes stayed serious.\
  \ \"You may be shaman to more than this one village, this one tribe, someday. But\
  \ for the next two days, you are the shaman of Thirty Trees. Which I'm sure will\
  \ still be standing when I come back from Kibwe.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Unless that giant\
  \ crocodile we had three years ago comes back. Or that band of charau-ka that tried\
  \ to raid us last harvest.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Why worry small?\" Oza said. \"Why not\
  \ both at once?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Because then we'd just feed the charau-ka to the\
  \ crocodile and poison it.\" Jiri frowned at her teacher. \"But what if—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"What if dragons, or kongamato, or inkanyamba, or any other of the great\
  \ beasts I've taught you about? What if demons or the Gorilla King himself? Then\
  \ you can send someone to fetch me. Kibwe's less than a day away. But I think what\
  \ you need to be ready for is spider-bites, fireweed itch, and arguments over how\
  \ often you should bless the mango trees. Those are things I know you can handle.\"\
  \ Oza hoisted his bag to his shoulder and reached out his hand. Jiri touched his\
  \ palm with hers, and they gripped fingers for a long moment. Then Jiri let go with\
  \ a sigh.</p> \n    <p>\"Gods, spirits, and ancestors, may they watch, protect,\
  \ and guide,\" Oza said in farewell. But he had barely stepped out the door before\
  \ a thickset older man stopped him. It was Mazi, the wara of Thirty Trees. </p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Everyone in Thirty Trees respects Oza's wisdom.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Shaman! Thank all my ancestors that you have not left yet. I need to\
  \ speak to you about something urgent.\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri twitched, fear flooding\
  \ into her, and relief that Oza was still there.</p> \n    <p>\"What is it?\" Oza\
  \ asked.</p> \n    <p>\"It is a matter that is best kept quiet,\" Mazi said. The\
  \ village's leader stepped close to Oza, and Jiri had to strain to hear him. \"\
  Something bit me. In a very, ah, <i>tender</i> place. The itch is unbearable.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Ah.\" Oza turned back toward his house, catching Jiri's eye. His\
  \ face was serious, but his eyes weren't. \"Jiri will be able to help with that.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Yes. Jiri. Well.\" Mazi shifted uncomfortably, and Jiri noticed\
  \ how the wara was carefully holding the loose cotton of his mud cloth away from\
  \ his skin. \"Couldn't you—\"</p> \n    <p>\"I follow the spirits, Wara,\" Oza said\
  \ solemnly. \"And they say I must be off. Jiri will heal you.\" Oza looked once\
  \ more at Jiri, the corner of his mouth barely crooked into a smile. She frowned\
  \ back at him, but smoothed her face carefully as she stepped out into the morning\
  \ sun.</p> \n    <p>\"Wara. Please, let me help. Or would you rather wait until\
  \ Oza returns?\"</p> \n    <p>Mazi watched the older shaman stride away and sighed.\
  \ \"No. Just... no fire,\" he said as he shuffled past her, into her house.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jiri turned her back on all the other villagers who happened to be standing\
  \ around outside, hiding their smiles with varying degrees of success.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"No fire,\" she said. </p> \n    <p><i>Maybe the giant crocodile wouldn't\
  \ have been so bad.</i></p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Jiri said. \"She's dead.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ancestors cry.\"\
  \ Dama shifted her baby on her hip and sighed. \"White Ear was my best milker, but\
  \ she was never the smartest goat. Drowning in a puddle, though? I didn't think\
  \ she was that stupid.\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri pulled her feet with some difficulty\
  \ out of the deep mud and splashed out of the pool that her neighbor had found White\
  \ Ear bobbing in. \"It's surprisingly deep,\" she said, wringing out the bottom\
  \ of her shirt. Yesterday, after Oza had left, it had started raining. This was\
  \ not unusual in the Mwangi, where rained most days this time of year. But this\
  \ rain had been heavy, and had lasted through the night, only clearing after dawn.\
  \ Now the jungle steamed and dripped in the morning sun, and the children were sliding\
  \ through the red mud and playing in the little streams that ran between, and sometimes\
  \ through, Thirty Trees' houses.</p> \n    <p>Their parents seemed less amused.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Neh.\" Dama shook her head. \"Mud everywhere, and now I have to butcher\
  \ a goat. At least we'll eat well tonight. Join us?\"</p> \n    <p> \"Thank you.\
  \ I—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Jiri! Where's Oza?\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri spun when she heard\
  \ her name and saw the young man running up. Hadzi. The boy that Oza had been teasing\
  \ her about for the past year, the boy that she had such trouble looking at when\
  \ he was looking at her, but whom she could stare at quite happily when he was doing\
  \ anything else. For a moment Jiri was acutely aware that she was covered in mud\
  \ and goat hair, her braids an unruly tangle around her face. That feeling flashed\
  \ away, though, when Hadzi splashed to a stop in front of her. He was breathing\
  \ hard, covered in mud and soaked in water and sweat, and his eyes were wide in\
  \ his handsome face.</p> \n    <p>\"Oza's still in Kibwe. What's happened?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"Boro.\" Hadzi gasped his brother's name. \"In trouble. At the river.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Take me,\" Jiri said, and she followed when he turned and started\
  \ to run again.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>They\
  \ reached the river too early.</p> \n    <p>Rain-swollen, the dirt-red water had\
  \ spread far beyond its usual banks. Jiri splashed through it behind Hadzi, stumbling\
  \ over hidden brush, hoping not to fall into a hole, eyes searching for crocodiles.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Here,\" Hadzi said, rounding the big gaboon tree that marked where\
  \ the trail they were trying to follow turned toward the river's usual banks. \"\
  Oza's gone! I brought Jiri!\" he shouted as he disappeared behind the tree's buttress\
  \ roots.</p> \n    <p>Jiri thought she might have heard a curse answer Hadzi's shout,\
  \ but she was too distracted to worry about it when she came around the tree. Below\
  \ her, the jungle opened up and she could see the river proper. Normally narrow\
  \ and placid, it had become a red-brown monster, its center churning with foam and\
  \ drifting debris as it rushed by. Close to them, a great pile of branches and small\
  \ trees had caught against the massive, moss-covered stone that normally stood at\
  \ the river's edge. Tangled in that wrack of limbs and roots was a boat, one of\
  \ the big river ships that ran cargo between Kibwe and the outer villages. Clustered\
  \ on the stone over the wreck was a group from the village, young men and women\
  \ mostly. Out on the snag, Jiri spotted Fumo, Hadzi's father, balanced on a tree\
  \ trunk beside the boat, holding something that lay half in the water. </p> \n \
  \   <p>Boro.</p> \n    <p>Jiri splashed her way down toward the stone. The water\
  \ rose rapidly, over her knees, to her waist, almost up to her arms, and she cursed\
  \ her shortness as the current shoved at her and she had to half-swim to reach the\
  \ outcrop. Hands grabbed her when she got close, yanking her out of the dangerous\
  \ water, but she didn't feel much safer perched on the moss-covered rock. Still,\
  \ the stone was much more certain than the unsteady wrack of logs. Carefully, Jiri\
  \ stepped out onto a broken tree trunk. Then she dropped to her hands and knees\
  \ and crawled forward, moving from trunk to branch to trunk toward Fumo, ignoring\
  \ the constant shaking of the brush beneath her.</p> \n    <p>The man clung to a\
  \ thick log, arms wrapped around Boro, holding him up. Boro's teeth were locked\
  \ in pain, and he was twisted at a strange angle, his right leg under the water.\
  \ Caught, Jiri realized, trapped by some shifting branch. Without his father's hold,\
  \ he would be jerked down and crushed between the logs or drowned. </p> \n    <p>Fumo\
  \ looked at her, his arms shaking. \"I can't hold him like this much longer.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Gods and crocodiles, Jiri thought, staring at Boro. <i>What would Oza\
  \ do?</i></p> \n    <p><i>What can I do?</i></p> \n    <p>Then one of the women\
  \ crouching on the stone behind them shouted.</p> \n    <p>\"Look out!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Jiri looked up and saw it, a black-green shape being swept along by the\
  \ river's current, but angling toward them. It could have been a fallen tree—it\
  \ was big enough—but she knew what it was immediately.</p> \n    <p>\"Gods and crocodiles,\"\
  \ she swore again, watching the massive reptile swim toward them.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
