  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Faithful Servants</h1> \n   <p>by James L.\
  \ Sutter</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: A Walk in the Park</h2> \n   <p>\"So talk.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>The two men—for Salim had returned the eidolon's amulet, and the snake-man\
  \ once more looked like an axiomite—walked shoulder to shoulder through one of Axis's\
  \ many parks. To either side of the cobblestone path, trees and bushes of a hundred\
  \ different varieties stood in a riot of color, each with a neat little placard\
  \ giving its name and world of origin. Several were surrounded by decorative fences,\
  \ and one of these quarantined plants shook and hooted as the pair passed by, its\
  \ spherical fruit opening to reveal sucking lamprey mouths.</p> \n   <p>\"My name\
  \ is Connell,\" the eidolon said. \"My master is Gatis Mirosoy, of the nation of\
  \ Ustalav. More than thirty years ago, he called me forth from the aether of the\
  \ Cerulean Void and gave me form, shaping me into his constant companion.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Salim nodded. He didn't know much about the practices of the so-called\
  \ summoners, but he knew that the spirits they used in their magical creations were\
  \ drawn from the Outer Planes. They weren't true souls—otherwise his own master,\
  \ Pharasma the death goddess, would have something to say about the poaching—but\
  \ they were close enough to provide the necessary animus. If Connell were a product\
  \ of the chaotic Maelstrom, then it explained his appearance—and the disguising\
  \ amulet. The serpentine proteans native to that plane were despised everywhere,\
  \ but Axis had been at war with them since the universe began.</p> \n   <p>All of\
  \ these thoughts passed by in the time it took Connell to draw breath and continue.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"For three decades, I served my master faithfully, protecting him from\
  \ enemies, researching incantations, and managing his household affairs. He made\
  \ this amulet specifically for me, so that I might treat with the local villagers\
  \ on his behalf without unduly alarming them.\" One slender axiomite hand came up\
  \ to caress the object, where it hung on its repaired leather thong. </p> \n   <p>\"\
  Sometimes, perhaps once every few years, his research would take us beyond the manor,\
  \ to some forgotten library or dusty tomb where valuable knowledge lay languishing,\
  \ waiting for the master to rescue it. It was on one of these excursions that he\
  \ found the—the crown.\" The eidolon's voice caught, and for a moment he was silent.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Crown?\" Salim prompted.</p> \n   <p>\"It's terrible!\" the eidolon\
  \ wailed, then reined himself back to a more reasonable volume. \"We found it in\
  \ the burial chamber of Arachyx the Ghoul-Handed. The master had brought us there\
  \ in search of an ancient tapestry, but as soon as he saw the crown, all thought\
  \ of the original mission went out the window, and he had to have it. It's a sick\
  \ thing, an evil thing—a twisted band of iron with thorns that jut out in all directions,\
  \ even back into the wearer's scalp. The whole thing has a weird, slick feeling\
  \ to it, not like iron at all, but like oiled or decomposing flesh. And when the\
  \ thorns prick you, the blood never drips—the thorns suck it up. I <i>hate</i> it.\"\
  \ With this last pronouncement, a single tear welled up and rolled down the eidolon's\
  \ disguised nose, dropping to the dirt.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Salim.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Salim_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> <span class=\"blurbi\">\"Missionary work is hardly\
  \ Salim's forte.\"</span>\n   </div> \n   <p>\"After the master put it on, he...changed.\
  \ Before, he'd been a quiet man, and stern as any good master, but not without a\
  \ sense of humor. After that, he became something else. He lost all interest in\
  \ summoning lesser servants from the distant planes, which before had been his greatest\
  \ joy, and even quit experimenting with my form. Instead, all he wanted to do was\
  \ research death. He became obsessed with creating undead things, from rat skeletons\
  \ and dog zombies to more... substantial works.\" Connell paused, embarrassed. \"\
  I dug up graves and brought him the remains of the townsfolk. He said we were just\
  \ borrowing them.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Right.\"</p> \n   <p>Connell shrugged, helpless.\
  \ \"He was my master. If he wanted to study necromancy, that was his prerogative.\
  \ An eidolon doesn't question.\"</p> \n   <p>Salim nodded, but trained ears had\
  \ caught the verb tense. \"Was?\"</p> \n   <p>All at once, the eidolon's composure\
  \ broke, and the face he turned to Salim was a caricature of anguish.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  He sent me <i>away</i>,\" Connell whispered. His tone made it sound like a death\
  \ sentence. \"In all my life, I had never been more than a mile from his side. But\
  \ he had changed so much. He had never been over fond of travel, but now he never\
  \ left the manor. He quit eating hardly at all, and would go for days without sleep.\
  \ He ignored the clean clothes I left out for him. He tore down the shrine to the\
  \ magic god Nethys, and built a new one to Urgathoa, the Pallid Princess. The old\
  \ one was wood and paper, beautifully made. This one was made of parts from his—\
  experiments.\"</p> \n   <p>Salim had seen plenty of such shrines, and could well\
  \ imagine the decomposing limbs and reanimating scramblings it entailed. The Pallid\
  \ Princess was a sick bitch, and made Salim's own goddess look downright warm in\
  \ comparison. Where Pharasma was, for all her faults, at least even-handed and devoted\
  \ to perpetuating natural cycles, Urgathoa was devoted to undeath and gluttony,\
  \ her necromancers filling the world with perverse beings that refused to die. Needless\
  \ to say, the two ladies didn't get along.</p> \n   <p>\"You said he sent you away.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Connell wrapped thin arms around himself. \"It was that stupid crown—\
  I know it was. After a while, he didn't even take it off to sleep, and didn't notice\
  \ when the wounds from the thorns got infected. I tried to take it off him once—\
  just for a minute, to clean them out!—and he threw me halfway across the room. And\
  \ that was when he said he didn't need me anymore.\" Another slow tear. \"That—\
  that he had plenty of new servants. Better ones. And then he cast a spell, and I\
  \ was somewhere else.\"</p> \n   <p>The eidolon went silent, and Salim gave him\
  \ his space, recognizing in the set of his shoulders how hard this must be for him.\
  \ After a moment, Connell continued.</p> \n   <p>\"He'd sent me back to the Maelstrom,\
  \ the chaos plane he'd drawn me from. Except it didn't feel like home anymore. I\
  \ was awkward, and lonely, and everything I met was either terrified of me or trying\
  \ to eat me. But worse—I could still feel him. My master. The thread was faint—\
  so faint—but I could still feel him.\" The eidolon pointed to the rune on his forehead.\
  \ \"I'm still my master's creature.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That's when I realized how much\
  \ danger he was in. He had his undead things, but they were still weak, and sooner\
  \ or later someone was going to get fed up with the grave robbing and try to do\
  \ something about it. And I wouldn't be there to protect him.\"</p> \n   <p>Salim\
  \ was starting to get tired of the eidolon's puppylike devotion. He attempted to\
  \ hurry the story along. \"And so?\"</p> \n   <p>\"So I went to see Pharasma.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Salim stopped walking so abruptly that Connell almost tripped and fell\
  \ over onto a flower whose blossoms were shaped like tethered hummingbirds, petal-wings\
  \ buzzing frantically to pull them away from the clumsy eidolon.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You went to the Boneyard?\" Perhaps Salim had underestimated the creature. Though\
  \ the goddess of death wasn't the sort to slay anyone out of hand—quite the opposite,\
  \ in fact—there were plenty of other beings around the Gray Lady's realm who were\
  \ less discriminating, and the journey there was hardly easy.</p> \n   <p>\"It took\
  \ a while,\" the eidolon agreed, \"but I got there eventually. Some nice crow-vulture-things\
  \ in masks led me in and showed me to one of her servants, a black-winged angel\
  \ called Ceyanan. I think you know him?\"</p> \n   <p>\"You could say that,\" Salim\
  \ said wryly. In the same sense that you know your master, he thought, just without\
  \ the hopeless love. But he didn't bother confusing the eidolon with his own problems.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"He was very nice,\" Connell said. \"I simply explained the situation\
  \ as best I could, and he agreed that it would be in Pharasma's interest to help\
  \ me.\" Here the eidolon grinned, and despite the amulet's illusion, Salim could\
  \ easily imagine the serpentine smile beneath it. \"See, it's not just the necromancy—\
  I know the goddess hates undead, but that problem will take care of itself when\
  \ someone eventually comes along and kills him. The real issue is the crown. It's\
  \ what's changed him and made him do all these evil things—I'm positive. And if\
  \ it's the crown, that means it's not his fault. And if it's not his <i>fault</i>\"\
  —here the eidolon raised a triumphant finger—\"then it shouldn't affect the final\
  \ judgment of his soul. It's a tricky situation. If my master dies while the crown's\
  \ magic is making him do bad things, does that count against him? Does his soul\
  \ go to Urgathoa, or to Nethys? At the very least, it seems like a long and complicated\
  \ judgment is in order.\"</p> \n   <p>Now Salim understood. \"And Ceyanan sent you\
  \ to me.\"</p> \n   <p>Connell nodded enthusiastically. \"He agreed that such a\
  \ judgment would be needlessly complicated and take up the goddess's valuable time,\
  \ and that the best thing to do was remove the cursed crown and let my master's\
  \ soul cleanse itself. Then he gave me your description, and the name of a bar,\
  \ and transported me to Axis.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Of course he did.\" Salim had to admit,\
  \ the eidolon's logic was sound. And it would be just like Ceyanan to send Salim\
  \ on a job that was, in essence, missionary work. Soul saving. That would tickle\
  \ the angel's sense of irony.</p> \n   <p>\"So will you do it?\" the eidolon asked\
  \ eagerly. \"Will you help me help my master?\"</p> \n   <p>As if he had a choice.\
  \ \"Ustalav, you said?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Aton's Field, a village near Kavapesta.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Salim reached into his robes and produced an amulet of his own. The\
  \ size of his thumb, the stone was a perfect, lightless black, save for an iridescent\
  \ spiral that seemed to shimmer and move of its own accord. Cupping the stone in\
  \ one hand, he offered the other to Connell. \"Let's go, then.\"</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ eidolon took it.</p> \n   <p>The world twisted.</p> \n   <p><b>Note:</b> This\
