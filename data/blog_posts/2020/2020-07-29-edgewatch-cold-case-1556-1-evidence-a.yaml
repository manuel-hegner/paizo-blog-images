  \ bluff looked like an ugly duckling with its two-toned fortifications, like mismatched\
  \ building blocks set together by a titan’s toddler. I also couldn’t help but notice\
  \ the floating prison—the so-called Black Whale—half a dozen grounded ships all\
  \ lashed together. It seems the city reminds me at every opportunity to watch myself,\

  \  <p>I’ve been parked at a tavern here in the Precipice Quarter for the past hour,\
  \ and you’ll love the name: the “Tipsy Tengu”. The halfling owner has opened the\
  \ place up to adventuring parties, and the ruckus, storytelling, and drinking has\
  \ me tempted to ask if any are in need of a well-trained lockpick and confidence\
  \ woman. All of those adventurers are here for a reason: Absalom has abandoned,\
  \ treasure-filled siege castles dating back thousands of years spread all around\
  \ its as-yet-impenetrable walls! How amazing is that?! Just outside the city walls\
  \ and even running beneath it in Desna-only-known how many unmapped and abandoned\
  \ tunnels, there’s a veritable adventurers’ playground!</p>\n              <p>Adventuring\
  \ wouldn’t have me clapped in chains like crime within the city walls would, and\
  \ I’ve had my ears chattered off by a bird—Runkles the Raven, the self-proclaimed\
  \ flashiest familiar in the city—for the past twenty minutes trying to convince\
  \ me of the benefits of joining an adventuring group. His mistress’s party is looking\
  \ for a rogue to raid a particular siege castle, and I’m genuinely tempted to take\
  \ them up on the offer. But first I need to get a better feel for this city and\
  \ weigh my options. I don't know if treasure hunting on the city’s outskirts is\
  \ any more or less safe than my usual work among the tourist crowds milling about,\
  \ awestruck and not paying attention to their purse strings.</p>\n             \
  \ <p>I spent most of the day walking through the city, its wide streets crowded\
  \ past what I thought possible: every flavor of ancestry and culture from across\
  \ the Inner Sea and beyond, all simmering in this great big stew of a divinely reclaimed\
  \ island. I let my ears soak everything in, picking out anything on the locals’\
  \ tongues to guide my feet. I overheard a pair of street vendors talking about how\
  \ they’d managed to raise prices due to the Radiant Festival. Now I’m well versed\
  \ in history, but I’d never heard of this festival before, so I purchased a meat\
  \ pie from one flashy cart called Mamma Middlepidge’s Delights and asked about it.\
  \ I had planned to take advantage of the influx of potential marks in the wake of\
  \ Absalom’s victory over the Whispering Tyrant’s failed siege, but what I’ve learned\
  \ of the Radiant Festival has me giddy as a werebear in a trough of honey.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Apparently, thousands of years ago an evil wizard called Kharnas\
  \ the Angel-Binder (pleasant sounding fellow, I know!) laid siege to Absalom. Since\
  \ his defeat, they’ve celebrated each centennial with this grand festival. And oh\
  \ my, do they go all out! They took the formerly abandoned, monster-haunted Precipice\
  \ Quarter and remade it as the grounds for the Radiant Festival itself. All new\
  \ buildings, pavilion grounds, exhibits, merchants, and crowds, crowds, crowds!\
  \ It was all designed by a famed Absalomian architect by the name of Blune Bandersworth.\
  \ Here’s the rub though: the entire district was literally a ruin-strewn waste filled\
  \ with ravenous undead and monsters wandering up from who knows where beneath the\
  \ city and here in less than a year it’s the newest, grandest part of the city and\
  \ it’s hosting a massive festival! I don’t know how he did it. Neither does anyone\
  \ else. It’s as if he conjured it from the ether by magic!</p>\n              <p>I’\
  ve seen almost too much today to describe it all. The crowds were thick and at first\
  \ I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see much, but I wasn’t prepared for the sheer\
  \ size of some of the exhibits! The ground trembled and I looked up as I entered\
  \ the festival grounds and beheld a gigantic walking castle. Can you believe it?\
  \ A Keleshite palace on great mechanical legs with people on the ramparts waving\
  \ down at me, colorful banners fluttering in the breeze high overhead. That was\
  \ just the first of the wonders I saw, and it wasn’t even the largest of them!</p>\n\
  \              <p>A block away, surrounded by an even larger crowd, was a gigantic\
  \ beast of a machine called Graveraker. Set up on giant metal treads with a huge\
  \ drill and whirling scoops, it’s the largest construct that I’ve ever seen! The\
  \ festival is here to display marvels of ingenuity, art, and craftsmanship, and\
  \ I wonder what this one will be used for. Perhaps it was used in the remodeling\
  \ of the district from its previously ruined state? Based on the name itself, I\
  \ figure that maybe they intend to use it to excavate and loot the treasures buried\
  \ within the ruin and rubble of the Cairnlands, or even Tyrant’s Grasp? I’ve no\
  \ idea, but the longer I looked at the menacing contraption, the more I couldn’\
  t help thinking that should it ever be turned to war it could surely eat any random\
  \ building and still be hungry, or feast upon the walls of any city—Absalom included!</p>\n\
  \              <p>What caught my eye most though was a building still being completed:\
  \ a massive Minkaian pagoda fashioned like a great dragonfly. And the construction\
  \ workers: a gang of kobolds! Absalom attracts all types, and as an outsider it\
  \ makes me feel all the more welcome to see them skittering about, employed and\
  \ accepted like anyone else!</p>\n              <p>The Precipice Quarter would seem\
  \ reborn, though not completely. Not to one with as discerning a gaze as me. It’\
  s a fresh coat of paint over a mostly rebuilt fence, but if you look hard you can\
  \ spot the rotten posts. The local Edgewatch has done a good job of making sure\
  \ that folks are safe, and <em>feel</em> safe, even if certain areas are blocked\
  \ off and still ruined out of sight of the general public. Those blocked off areas?\
  \ They’ve posted guards and I’d swear that they’re there not to prevent anyone from\
  \ outside sneaking in but to keep something inside from getting out… It’s a grim\
  \ thought to be certain, but even if the threat of hungry undead seems mostly reduced\
  \ to ghost stories, the crowds here have absolutely attracted an altogether mundane\
  \ threat, but one I’m much more familiar with: thieves and confidence artists.</p>\n\
  \              <p>All this time I’d been on the watch over my own purse because\
  \ the crowd attracts that element. I mean, I’m that element myself! So it was just\
  \ by happenstance that this plump, bearded banker of Abadar walks past, all sure\
  \ of himself and the security of the city. In the space of a heartbeat some large\
  \ bird I couldn’t see through the throng let out a squawk, distracting the gilded\
  \ cleric, and I see a devilspawn woman walking the other way lift his coin purse\
  \ with the tip of her tail, real smooth-like. In a city of strangers, she was a\
  \ strange one: horns, goat legs, tail, all that racket. Well that priest, he didn’\
  t notice a thing, just kept walking. For her part, she walked straight up to a stall\
  \ selling strange figurines that could have been shrunken corpses for how real they\
  \ looked and bent over the wares. Some Gebbite selling stuff to Urgathoans or somesuch.\
  \ But I digress.</p>\n              <p>So, of course I walked over and introduced\
  \ myself just as she slid the pilfered purse into the pocket of her cloak with the\
  \ tip of her tail. I didn’t directly mention the theft, but asked about “career\
  \ opportunities” in the area and she caught my meaning. Nisha Starweather was her\
  \ name. She snagged us drinks and snacks from Pelmo’s Pickle Hut, likely with the\
  \ very money she’d taken off the Abadaran just moments before. We talked for a bit\
  \ and watched a number of other pickpockets ply their trade—and watched nearly as\
  \ many busted by the Edgewatch. They were doing a genuinely good job of it. Sadly,\
  \ I figured pretty quickly that Nisha wasn’t the foot in the door I’d hoped for.\
  \ She was recently arrived herself, visiting from what she described as “nowhere\
  \ remotely close to this place.” I think she might have slipped a bit and started\
  \ to say “plane”, not “place”, but I could have just misheard her among the din\
  \ of the crowd. Anyway, she said she was in town hoping to meet up with an old friend\
  \ who might be showing up herself in the next while.</p>\n              <p>While\
  \ she wasn’t going to be the in I needed to set up a burgeoning career in the city’\
  s criminal underworld, she was the one who suggested the Tipsy Tengu, since the\
  \ place catered to adventurers at night. She said I might make friends and ask around\
  \ for a place to stay. A lot of the inns I’ve passed today have hung a no-vacancy\
  \ sign, with the city packed to the brim with visitors, and it’s dangerous to wander\
  \ about any city at night, especially as a visitor, so it’s a genuine concern and\
  \ that has occupied my mind for much of the evening.</p>\n              <p>Desna\
  \ smiled on me, though!</p>\n              <p>In the midst of my first drink, wondering\
  \ if I’d spend the night sleeping on a roof or in an alleyway, a bar fight broke\
  \ out! This drunken halfling insulted this one hammered Chelaxian, calling her a\
  \ “devil licker” and she retorted with a local slur against halflings, and that\
  \ started it. She got clocked, he got kicked in the face, and their respective companions\
  \ launched into the fray. It would have gotten worse if not for the Edgewatch showing\
  \ up and intervening with magic to hold the combatants in place and a smooth bit\
  \ of diplomacy to calm everyone down. That would have been the end of it, until\
  \ that Chelaxian woman shrugged off the spell. She would’ve stabbed the watch sergeant\
  \ if not for quick thinking by this half-orc next to me at the bar who stood up\
  \ and, cool as could be, crashed her stool over the “devil licker’s” head.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Things calmed down after that, and I paid the chair-wielding hero’\
  s tab. Ralso, her name was, and before she left for the evening, she gave me a business\
  \ card with the address of a hotel called the Dreaming Palace. She said it had empty\
  \ rooms if I were in need. The place looks fancy—sounds fancy, too, like maybe Desna’\
  s blessed it or something. In any case, it should solve my housing problem, if only\
  \ for the moment, before I figure out what to do next. Do I lapse back into the\
  \ life of crime that saw me exiled from all of you in the first place, or instead\
  \ turn to the life of heroic sanctioned robbery and murder of an adventurer? A good\
  \ night’s rest in my new palace of dreams and I’ll figure that out while I explore\
  \ the wonders of the Radiant Festival over the course of the next few days. I’ll\
  \ be sure to keep you all apprised of my decision (and other craziness of the big,\
  \ scary city). Until then, there are wonders to see and I’ve eyes to gander with!</p>\n\
