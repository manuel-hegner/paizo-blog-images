  description\">Lisette followed Karag into the bosom of Oregent's underworld, such\
  \ as it was. The folk of Andoran were different from those of Cheliax, addled perhaps\
  \ by their own slogans about liberty. Their enterprises were not especially well\
  \ interwoven with that of the city government, and required more furtive activity.\
  \ Or so she had deduced. As evening came on, Karag led her via a circuitous route\
  \ to a tavern in the warehouse district, then through a small crowd of incurious\
  \ drinkers to a large back storage room. Somewhere, more bells were signaling. All\
  \ was dark but for a lantern near the door and another over a card table occupied\
  \ by four thick-necked bruisers. Crates and barrels were stacked more or less neatly\
  \ upon shelves, amid bits of discarded junk and rusted winches.</span></p> \n  \
  \   <p>At sight of Karag, one of the card players, a big balding Keleshite with\
  \ a nose ring, got up.</p> \n     <p>\"I've got the delivery,\" the dwarf announced.\
  \ \"And some news.\" </p> \n     <p>\"And a visitor.\" The thug gave Lisette a once-over.\
  \ He stepped back to knock on a paneled door and announce: \"Karag's back, with\
  \ some woman.\" The others kept their seats, appraising the newcomer.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>After only a brief delay, a fifth man stepped out from a shadowy office. He\
  \ was of a different cut than the thugs: aquiline nose, firm chin, high cheekbones.\
  \ He was well dressed, gone a little to fat, but handsome save for lips that seemed\
  \ small for his face, and somewhat petulant. </p> \n     <p>This, then, was Belvar.\
  \ If she managed things right, he could get her past all the obstacles this ill-fated\
  \ mission had thrown into her path. Belvar had the Keleshite take Karag's satchel,\
  \ then his dark eyes raked Lisette thoroughly. He made sure she knew that he liked\
  \ what he saw, as powerful men so often did. She had even, regular features, and\
  \ her chosen occupation kept her fit, even if it also led to the acquisition of\
  \ scars and bruises. As yet, none had permanently marred her face. So much the better\
  \ for playing these kinds of games.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Belvar's a small-town crook with a big-city ego.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>\"Who's this, Karag?\" Belvar's voice was thin, a little\
  \ oily. He gave her a half-smile as Karag explained how he'd been ambushed, his\
  \ partner killed. Then Belvar's eyes slipped to the butts of the rifles poking over\
  \ Lisette's shoulders. They flicked to the blue feather in her brimmed hat, and\
  \ his expression froze. </p> \n     <p>She kept her smile fixed in place, pretending\
  \ that she felt no alarm. He'd recognized her. How had he recognized her?</p> \n\
  \     <p>Karag was in the midst of his report about Lisette dropping into the alley.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What did you say?\" Belvar asked him. </p> \n     <p>Karag summed\
  \ up flatly, as if familiar with such interruptions, \"Vermet's men jumped us after\
  \ we'd collected most of the protection money.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And her?\" Belvar\
  \ snarled.</p> \n     <p>\"She killed two. I got the other one.\" </p> \n     <p>Belvar\
  \ demanded a few more details, then spun and barked orders to one of the muscle\
  \ boys about arranging a proper \"thank you\" for Vermet and his crew. The man departed\
  \ swiftly with an eager, self-satisfied air.</p> \n     <p>Only then did Belvar\
  \ step a little closer. \"So,\" he said to Lisette. \"It seems I'm about to become\
  \ involved in a business dispute with a competitor.\"</p> \n     <p>\"A turf war,\"\
  \ she said, picking up on Karag's lead.</p> \n     <p>\"And here you are, dropped\
  \ right into the middle of things, guns, plume, and all. Coincidence?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>He seemed to have recognized her specifically, not just the fact that she\
  \ carried guns. She'd have to play things very carefully. She adopted a softer,\
  \ more feminine tone. \"I have to find the man that killed my friend,\" Lisette\
  \ told him. \"A bowman. And I've learned this bowman is now after a banker you may\
  \ know. I can see you have more important matters to attend to, but if you could\
  \ just—\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm afraid your reputation precedes you, my dear.\" Belvar\
  \ snapped the fingers of his right hand. \"I think I'd be more comfortable discussing\
  \ your little problem with you unarmed.\" Instantly he had the attention of the\
  \ remaining muscle, who rose, grinning with menace, to take up positions—two in\
  \ front of Belvar, and another who circled behind Lisette. Karag was at her side,\
  \ though he seemed a little puzzled by his boss's action. </p> \n     <p>\"Hold\
  \ on,\" Lisette snapped. Like hell he was going to get her guns. Good thing she'd\
  \ taken the time to reload. Too bad she only had three shots. There just hadn't\
  \ been time to repair that broken hammer yet.</p> \n     <p>\"Belvar, she's here\
  \ to make a deal,\" Karag told his boss. \"She can pay well for basic information.\"\
  \ He was trying to prevent a fight, bless him.</p> \n     <p>\"Can she.\" Belvar\
  \ sneered, but he held up a hand to his men, who didn't advance. \"Did she tell\
  \ you who she was, Karag?\"</p> \n     <p>The dwarf's gaze shifted doubtfully between\
  \ the two of them.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm Lisette Demonde,\" she announced.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Which she volunteers now,\" Belvar said with a smirk. \"After I've already\
  \ worked it out.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm not keeping any secrets.\" Lisette strove\
  \ to sound as reasonable as possible. \"I'm after a bowman, and there's money in\
  \ it for you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe,\" Belvar said, small lips curling, \"and\
  \ maybe you're really after one of us.\"</p> \n     <p>Karag's expression foundered.\
  \ \"What's going on?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You ever hear of Kerrigan Sure-Shot? The\
  \ bounty hunter?\"</p> \n     <p>Apparently Karag hadn't. One of the enforcers,\
  \ a good-looking Ulfen, muttered under his breath. The other, the big Keleshite,\
  \ growled.</p> \n     <p>\"She's his.\" Belvar turned to the Keleshite. \"You've\
  \ heard the stories, right? How many pretty, gun-toting bounty hunters do you think\
  \ there are? Let alone one wandering around in a feathered hat.\"</p> \n     <p>Lisette\
  \ forced a wider smile. Things were going south. She heard the thug behind her shift.\
  \ Someone thought he was quieter than he truly was. \"I'm a business woman,\" she\
  \ tried. \"Just like you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Bounty hunters killed my brother,\"\
  \ Belvar spat.</p> \n     <p>\"Other bounty hunters,\" she emphasized. \"Not me.\
  \ There's money in this for us both. I hear this banker has some business interests\
  \ on the shady side, and I figured someone you know has dealings with him.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Belvar snorted in disbelief. \"You want to pump <i>me</i> for information?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Pay,\" she repeated. She sensed now that if the window remained\
  \ open at all, it was closing fast. Now she understood the dwarf's hasty speech.\
  \ Belvar had a short attention span. \"The bowman will be where the banker is. Dronsbech\
  \ doesn't know the bowman's after him, so I need someone to intro—\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Dronsbech? Jhon Dronsbech?\" Belvar's eyes fairly bulged. \"You think I know\
  \ him?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I came here betting you know someone who does. And I'll\
  \ bet the rich banker will be grateful to whoever helps him out. I just want the\
  \ bowman. You collect the gratitude.\" </p> \n     <p>\"Maybe I'll see about talking\
  \ to Dronsbech myself.\" Belvar flashed an oily grin \"I don't like bounty hunters.\
  \ Even pretty ones.\" He snapped the fingers of his other hand. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ man behind her sprang.</p> \n     <p>Well, so much for the diplomatic approach.\
  \ Lisette whipped about, fired from the hip, and took the shirtless thug through\
  \ his sagging belly. He dropped with a scream. She spun back and, with her second\
  \ pistol, shot the lantern above the card table. It shattered in a spray of glass,\
  \ plunging the area into darkness. She ducked the knife swipe of the Keleshite,\
  \ clubbed him in the side of the head with her pistol butt. As he staggered, she\
  \ swung the rifle around her shoulder so that the barrel pointed forward and triggered\
  \ it upside down.</p> \n     <p>The Ulfen had thrown himself flat; he learned fast,\
  \ though he hadn't been the target. Lisette's third shot blasted the second lantern,\
  \ plunging the storeroom into darkness. Now the only light source was the dim evening\
  \ sun filtering through the shuttered back door window.</p> \n     <p>\"She'll rush\
  \ the door!\" Belvar shouted. \"Stop her!\"</p> \n     <p>But that wasn't her intention\
  \ at all. She holstered the pistol, then drew her sword with her off hand. The guy\
  \ she'd pistol-whipped was groaning on the floor, but the handsome Ulfen was climbing\
  \ to his feet. And there was Belvar. And Karag, a squat figure who had unlimbered\
  \ his axe, but stood uncertain.</p> \n     <p>The Ulfen got his blade up and out\
  \ as she charged. She deflected his strike and took him down with a precise kick.\
  \ He groaned and crumpled. So there was only Belvar, and Karag. Neither was likely\
  \ to know enough about guns to tell that Kerrigan's was broken, and it was too dark\
  \ to see detail in any case.</p> \n     <p>To Belvar she presented the bore of Kerrigan's\
  \ rifle, her curved short sword in her other hand. The crime boss held only a knife.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I'd drop that, if I were you,\" she instructed.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ couldn't make out Belvar's expression, but she saw the glint of his blade reflecting\
  \ the window light behind her, and it quivered.</p> \n     <p>\"Karag?\" he said.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"She came for business,\" Karag replied stubbornly.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Damn straight,\" she agreed, then addressed Belvar again. \"Drop the knife.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Belvar's oily self-assurance cracked, and he cursed at Karag in a\
  \ high-pitched tirade. Lisette risked another step towards him. The boss's weapon\
  \ thudded against the floor planks.</p> \n     <p>Belvar's voice shook as he screeched.\
  \ \"You ever come near me again, Karag, and you're dead.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I think\
  \ you have more pressing worries,\" Lisette told him smoothly. She slipped in beside\
  \ him and put the blade of her sword to his throat. She heard the intake of his\
  \ breath, and let the rifle hang back over her shoulder as she grasped the back\
  \ of his shirt with one hand and tugged him toward the door. \"I wasn't after you\
  \ at all. I want the bowman. But I bet there's a bounty on your head, somewhere.\
  \ Maybe I'll take it anyway. To keep in my hope chest.\"</p> \n     <p>\"This is\
  \ a misunderstanding.\" Belvar's voice had risen another half an octave in fear.\
  \ Lisette looked past him to the shapes gathering in the doorway to the storeroom.\
  \ The Ulfen had climbed stiffly to his feet and looked like he might still be able\
  \ to try something. Karag followed her, warily, on a course parallel to her own,\
  \ axe at the ready.</p> \n     <p>She heard Belvar lick his lips. The others drew\
  \ closer.</p> \n     <p>\"Call them off.\" </p> \n     <p>He gasped as she pressed\
  \ the sword edge to his neck. \"Get back! All of you! I'm serious.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The Ulfen pulled back, though he watched alertly.</p> \n     <p>\"You're making\
  \ things a lot more difficult for me, Belvar.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just a misunderstanding.\
  \ We can still talk.\"</p> \n     <p>There was nothing more to talk about. She'd\
  \ be a fool to trust him for an introduction now, and she didn't think there was\
  \ anything more than her own skin that could be gotten out of the situation. But\
  \ she had to play things cool. \"Alright, but I'll do the talking. Karag\"—she had\
  \ almost called him dwarf—\"seems like your name's mud around here now. Earn some\
  \ coin and show me out of here.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't owe you anything. I had\
  \ a good thing here.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe. I think you're probably smarter than\
  \ Belvar, who's going to end up in a noose before long. Show me around. I'll make\
  \ it worth your while.\"</p> \n     <p>The dwarf only grunted. Well, he'd help or\
  \ he wouldn't, but if he was as smart as she thought, he'd be out the door right\
  \ after her. She resisted the impulse to slit Belvar's throat—that could make things\
  \ even more complicated than they already were. Instead, she sent him careening\
  \ forward before she turned and bolted for the exit. Immediately, Belvar began shouting\
  \ for someone to get her.</p> \n     <p>The door was unlocked. She was through in\
  \ an instant, and quickly put distance between her and the inevitable pursuit. As\
  \ she predicted, Karag came out alone a moment later. Three thugs ran after him:\
  \ one the handsome Ulfen, limping a bit; the other two presumably from the tavern's\
  \ main room. All were threatening shapes in the twilight. The dwarf jogged along\
  \ ahead of them, solid, determined. </p> \n     <p>And dead pretty soon. They were\
  \ catching up. </p> \n     <p>She didn't owe the dwarf. Belvar hadn't proven useful.\
  \ But she might still get some use out of Karag, who at least knew a little more\
  \ about the city than she. </p> \n     <p>She dashed behind crates piled by a darkened\
  \ warehouse door, then unslung the rifle and powder bag. Over the last few years\
  \ she'd drilled in twilight, darkness, and glaring light, high on rooftops and on\
  \ rocking boats, and even in the pouring rain. Kerrigan had told her she was faster\
  \ now than all but the best gunmen of Alkenstar. All her skills were honed so that\
  \ she might load and reload and keep Kerrigan always supplied with a ready weapon.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>She would give much, now to have someone like that herself. Or\
  \ better yet, to still be offering a loaded weapon to the dark-skinned bounty hunter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The dwarf was ten feet off, the nearest thug fifteen. There was no time\
  \ to waste. She cocked the hammer, raised the rifle to her shoulder, and fired,\
  \ deciding at the last second to shoot one of the others instead of the good-looking\
  \ Ulfen. Life and death, she thought, aren't always fair.</p> \n     <p>She absorbed\
  \ the weapon's kick, felt the familiar smell of the gunpowder wash over her as the\
  \ pursuing guard's face dissolved into red ruin. The Ulfen and his comrade dove\
  \ for cover.</p> \n     <p>\"Come on, dwarf!\" Lisette called, and ran on. Another\
  \ twenty feet led them out to what seemed a main thoroughfare, judging by the carriages\
  \ and the lights. Puffing, Karag joined her. She was about to ask him the best way\
  \ to go when Karag pointed and they jogged off, stopping only when Lisette flagged\
  \ down a closed black carriage.</p> \n     <p>The driver leaned down, the tip of\
  \ his conical black service cap sagging. She showed him a gold sail, the then glanced\
  \ to Karag, who seemed uncertain as to her aim. \"Give him a destination.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>After a moment, the dwarf said, \"The Golden Ox.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  No other passengers,\" Lisette said as she passed up the coin.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  As you wish, madame. My pleasure.\"</p> \n     <p>They scrambled into the carriage,\
  \ and Lisette closed the door, though she held the dark curtain to one side to consider\
  \ the street. There was no obvious sign of pursuit. \"What's at the Ox?\" she asked\
  \ Karag.</p> \n     <p>\"A friend,\" the dwarf grunted coarsely. \"You cost me a\
  \ lot, woman. I had a decent thing going back there.\"</p> \n     <p>She considered\
  \ the squat, broad shape hunched on the bench across from her. He smelled of sweat\
  \ and ale and blood. </p> \n     <p>\"I'll probably have to leave the city now,\"\
  \ the dwarf muttered.</p> \n     <p>\"You could work for the mine gangs, or Vermet.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He grunted. \"Vermet's an ass. And I'm done with mining.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Well. I didn't expect Belvar to recognize me.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You'd\
  \ be hard to forget,\" the dwarf said. \"Don't the guns give you away?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Kerrigan usually does the talking.\" The moment she said as much, she\
  \ chided herself.</p> \n     <p>For a long time, she thought the dwarf hadn't understood,\
  \ but he deduced more than she'd hoped.</p> \n     <p>\"So it's Kerrigan who's dead,\
  \ is it? What was he, your lover?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes,\" she answered, as though\
  \ the matter was of little import. </p> \n     <p>\"So who's this bowman guy?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"An elite assassin. There's a contract on him.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  See, you should have told me you were a bounty hunter.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's not\
  \ about the bounty. Not now. I told you that.\"</p> \n     <p>Karag seemed to consider\
  \ that, for he was quiet for a time. \"If I help you find him, will you cut me in\
  \ for half?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Help me how?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I can get <i>good</i>\
  \ help. You want to get in to see the banker? I can manage it. And I can back you\
  \ up so we can collect.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What kind of help?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Let's talk money first. It'll be help that will cut through about anything, though.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She was intrigued despite herself. \"A fifth,\" she offered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"A fifth of what?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You'd get a hundred Sails.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Karag remained silent. The cart turned, and they bounced through some\
  \ deep ruts. Somewhere far away, another set of bells began their ringing. \"Two\
  \ fifths. Two hundred sails,\" the dwarf said at last. </p> \n     <p>\"That's a\
  \ lot of money. Who're these friends of yours?\"</p> \n     <p>Karag grinned. \"\
  You wouldn't believe me.\"</p> \n     <p></p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming\
