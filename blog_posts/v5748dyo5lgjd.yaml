  \ sounds and words! Yarrr! Dear readers, before we start looking at cards from <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy95dj\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Gameâ€”Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Adventure Deck 2: Raiders of the Fever Sea</i></a>, I want to take a couple of\
  \ moments to share some thoughts about the comments on <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgbp\"\
  >my last blog</a>. I'm sort of curmudgeonly for a woman in her twenties, so some\
  \ of these thoughts may seem a bit harsh, but deep down, I'm actually a marshmallow.\
  \ If I had more coffee in my system, all my thoughts would be rainbows and kittens,\
  \ but alas, I'm out of java.</span></p> \n    <h2>Curmudgeonly Thoughts</h2> \n\
  \    <ol>\n     <li><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgbp\">My name isn't Gary</a>,\
  \ it's Gaby. I commend you for fixing your error and for making a mistake that didn't\
  \ result in my name being spelled Gabby or Gabbie. That's just the worst. Gary is\
  \ a much better error. <span class=\"tiny\"><i>[Editor's note: We all call her Gary\
  \ now.]</i></span></li> \n     <li>For those of you that thought <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Hirgenzosk.jpg\"\
  >Hirgy</a> was <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgbp&amp;page=2?Skull-Shackles-All-Aboard-for-Adventure#54\"\
  >not in the spirit of the game</a>...I see that there are words written there but\
  \ all I can read is \"baw baw baw.\" The Hirgzster is great. Just give him a chance.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>For those of you who figured out that the <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-GoblinWeilding1.jpg\"\
  >Goblin Weidling</a> is my favorite card because its name is my last name, congratulations!\
  \ You've scored a gazillion bonus points, which are redeemable for absolutely nothing!!!\
  \ But you're smart, so, you've got that going for you.</li> \n     <li>A lot of\
  \ you said really nice things about my blog and now the pressure is on to keep you\
  \ entertained and happy. YIPES. This is a way scarier than fighting Hirgenzosk,\
  \ but I'm going to try.</li>\n    </ol> \n    <p>And now, back to our regularly\
  \ scheduled programming.</p> \n    <h2>OSS (Obligatory Shark Section)</h2> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6012-BullShark.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6012-BullShark_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <b><i>BONK!</i></b>\n    </div> \n    <p>Fun fact: That's what\
  \ bull sharks actually do. They swim around waiting for some unsuspecting pirate\
  \ to decide it's a nice day for a dip, and then the bull shark just goes BONK with\
  \ its nose, like some sort of toothy battering ram. And after it goes bonk, then\
  \ it goes chomp and that's the end of that.</p> \n    <p>This shark, like all our\
  \ other sharks, can't be evaded. Of course, you have to make a check to find out\
  \ if you're a decent and alert swimmer, or you'll get bull sharked.</p> \n    <p>Bonus\
  \ fun fact: Bull sharks can live in either salt water or fresh water. You aren't\
  \ safe anywhere. Then again, neither are bull sharks. That's because Mike forced\
  \ upon the game a really bad, really awesome pun, and then we turned it into one\
  \ of the scariest promo cards ever. Witness the Owlbeartross.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Owlbeartross.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-Owlbeartross_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Oh, come on. That's the funniest thing you've heard today.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>That poor little Riptide Grindylow. He's just derping along,\
  \ minding his business and then for basically no reason, you come along and whack\
  \ him. Now you've done it. This makes the Owlbeartross pretty cross, since Grindylow\
  \ is his favorite snack food. It's likely that Mr. Tross will now fly off and shuffle\
  \ himself into a deck you really don't want to see him in, and also likely that\
  \ he'll go find another monster to beak-chomp. See, he's a big ball of cuddles.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Things that Actually Matter</h2> \n    <p>We've got some wacky stuff\
  \ going on in our scenarios. One of them has two different ships bopping around.\
  \ And if you're lucky, you'll end that scenario with a *ton* of plunder.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6012-GiveTheDevilHisDue.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Devilish due-giving abounds. Rickety Hake abides.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>You'll also have the opportunity to help out Rickety Hake, our first\
  \ ever loot ally. He's this totally nice dude with terrible teeth who fixes up ships\
  \ in his ship chop shop (say that three times fast!). He's a helpful guy to have\
  \ around.</p> \n    <p>In <i>The Secret of Mancatcher Cove</i>, there's sort of\
  \ a lot going on. It seems pretty normal at first, though. You build out your locations\
  \ like normal. There's a villain, who I call Inky Izzy, and a named henchman and\
  \ then some generic Buccaneers. It's sort of weird that there's one less location\
  \ than normal though. That probably won't be part of some horrible surprise.</p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It's part of some horrible surprise.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>You're\
  \ playing along and things are groovy gravy. You've closed some locations, and somehow,\
  \ luck's going your way. You've encountered Inky Izzy and you're even in a position\
  \ to banish her if your fights go well. And because I'm feeling reasonably nice\
  \ as I type this, let's say they do. You summon and encounter the ship <i>Thresher</i>.\
  \ It's not the nicest ship in the world, but again, your fight goes well, and you\
  \ defeat it. Huzzah for you! Now it's time to fight Inky Izzy. And yet again, in\
  \ a display of stunningly good luck, you beat her. You take your 1 Acid damage,\
  \ but that's OK because you've just won. Right? RIGHT?!</p> \n    <p>Wrong. Hold\
  \ on to your eye patches, kids, it's about to get crazy.</p> \n    <p>Remember that\
  \ scenario card that I showed you a picture of but just sort of glossed over? Turns\
  \ out that when Inky Izzy goes away you get to build a new location. It's called\
  \ Mancatcher Cove. It's not the nicest place in the Shackles, but it is by no means\
  \ the worst. So, what happens when this place gets built? Oh, that's right. You\
  \ add a villain to it. The Matron is not your friend.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It's not like you didn't see this coming.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Turns out that when you eventually get around to fighting her, she summons\
  \ a Sea Devil. And if you're lucky enough to beat her, then you get to add the villain\
  \ Krelloort to that location. Krelloort may have a funny name, but he's not a funny\
  \ guy. He's kind of a jerk. And he summons somebody to fight if there are cards\
  \ left in the location deck! Like I said, kind of a jerk. The good news is, if you\
  \ can get past Krelloort, you're done! You've won!</p> \n    <p>If you can handle\
  \ at least three villain fights, countless ship fights, and countless henchmen fights,\
  \ you've definitely earned the loot for this scenario.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
