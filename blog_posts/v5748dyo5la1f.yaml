  \   <blockquote> \n    <h1><br>Paizo Publishing® Announces the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>™\
  </h1> \n    <h3>Pathfinder™ to continue under the 3.5 rules.</h3> \n    <p class=\"\
  date\">Tuesday, March 18th, 2008</p> \n    <p>Paizo Publishing today unveiled the\
  \ <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i>, a tabletop fantasy roleplaying game that will\
  \ serve as the anchor for the company's popular line of <i>Pathfinder</i> adventures,\
  \ sourcebooks, and campaigns. Today marks the beginning of a year-long Open Playtest\
  \ of the new rules, which are based upon the popular 3.5 rules available under the\
  \ Open Game License. The <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> is designed with backward compatibility\
  \ as one of its primary goals, so players will continue to enjoy their lifelong\
  \ fantasy gaming hobby without invalidating their entire game library. The first\
  \ <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Alpha release is available now as a free 65-page PDF download\
  \ at <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG\">paizo.com/pathfinderRPG</a>. Until\
  \ the finished <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>'s release as a hardcover rulebook in August\
  \ 2009, all of Paizo's popular <i>Pathfinder</i>-brand products will continue under\
  \ the current 3.5 rules set.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm really excited to work with the\
  \ playtesters to make this the best game possible,\" said Jason Bulmahn, Paizo's\
  \ Lead Designer. \"In the spirit of the Open Game movement, the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>\
  \ is really <i>your</i> roleplaying game. It's a huge thrill to get to lead the\
  \ design process.\"</p> \n    <p>Paizo will issue additional <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>\
  \ Alpha releases in the coming months, covering new changes and additions to the\
  \ 3.5 rules. Gamers can download, read, and participate in the free open playtest\
  \ by setting up a paizo.com account and joining the discussion with Paizo's design\
  \ staff at <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG\">paizo.com/pathfinderRPG</a>.\
  \ The <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> will be backward-compatible with the 3.5 rules, and\
  \ the staff has kept this goal as a primary focus since design began in 2007. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>This coming August, Paizo will release a massive, full-color, softcover\
  \ <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Beta release for $24.99. This book will be available on\
  \ paizo.com, at Gen Con, as well as through hobby distribution at local game stores.\
  \ Just like the Alpha releases, the Beta release will be available as a free PDF\
  \ download on paizo.com. As Wizards of the Coast's core 3.5 rulebooks are expected\
  \ to go out of print with the release of 4th Edition, Paizo will use the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG</i> as a replacement for the 3.5 core rules. The Pathfinder RPG Beta release\
  \ will represent Paizo's first published take on an updated 3.5 system, and playtesting\
  \ will continue through spring 2009, when Paizo will incorporate the open playtest\
  \ feedback and create a hardcover <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> for release in the hobby\
  \ trade, bookstores, and paizo.com in August 2009.</p> \n    <p>Paizo hopes to support\
  \ 4th Edition with fan-created online conversions of its <i>Pathfinder</i> products\
  \ and a complete line from its partner company, Necromancer Games, a trend-setter\
  \ in the original Open Gaming movement. Necromancer has already announced a new\
  \ 4th Edition version of their award-winning <i>Tome of Horrors</i> monster encyclopedia,\
  \ and has plans for additional player and GM support products. </p> \n    <p>Today,\
  \ Paizo also announced the hiring of Nicolas Logue to run the Pathfinder Society\
  \ organized play campaign, a massive mega-campaign to launch at this year's Gen\
  \ Con. The Pathfinder Society will feature events at major conventions, retail stores,\
  \ and home play as a way to involve thousands of players in a constantly evolving\
  \ campaign environment fueled by downloadable scenarios released by Paizo. Nicolas\
  \ Logue is a long-time Paizo contributor to the print versions of <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> as well as the <i>Pathfinder</i> Adventure Paths and <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Modules</i> line. He also co-runs an annual competition at Gen Con called Iron\
  \ DM that will continue to be co-run by Nicolas Logue and his Iron DM compatriots.\
  \ Nick begins working at Paizo in April.</p> \n    <p>\"Nicolas Logue is one of\
  \ the most energetic, personable gamers I have ever met,\" said Erik Mona, Paizo's\
  \ Publisher and the co-founder during his tenure at Wizards of the Coast of Living\
  \ Greyhawk, the largest organized play RPG campaign in history. \"Running a successful\
  \ organized play campaign involves a magical combination of cool ideas, organizational\
  \ skills, and enthusiasm. Nick is absolutely the perfect man for the job, and I'm\
  \ thrilled that he will be joining us here at Paizo.\"</p> \n    <p>Additional information\
