  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Something besides the Krampus stalks the snowy,\
  \ holiday streets this year. Just in time for the longest nights of the year comes\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v33\"><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of the Night</i></a>,\
  \ a guide to playing vampires, dhampirs, and vampire hunters. Always wanted to play\
  \ a character with a true bloodlust? <i>Blood of the Night</i> gives you a variety\
  \ of gory options, from playing fantastically powerful actual vampires (and detailing\
  \ what that means for a game) to slipping in more subtle bloodsuckers like dhampirs.\
  \ But how do you know what type of bloodsucker is best for you and your game? <i>Blood\
  \ of the Night</i> can help you answer that question.</span></p> \n    <h2>Start\
  \ with the For Your Character section</h2> \n    <p>The first section of every Player\
  \ Companion is the For Your Character spread, two pages dedicated to answering your\
  \ questions, highlighting focus classes and topics, and helping you find the perfect\
  \ options for you character. This is the place to start, particularly with the Questions\
  \ to Ask Your GM section.</p> \n    <p>The biggest question here: Will we be allowed\
  \ to play any monstrous characters in this campaign, including vampires?</p> \n\
  \    <p>Remember, the GM is the arbiter of what works in her game and what doesn’\
  t, so if you want to play a character tainted by vampirism, talk to her and find\
  \ out what works in her game. If the answer’s no vampires (or other powerful races),\
  \ that’s still okay! There are still plenty of ways to play a bloodsucker. In fact,\
  \ that’s what dhampirs were made for. See if your GM is okay with you playing one\
  \ of these creatures, which are more evenly matched to the core races. If the answer\
  \ to the vampire question is yes, though, that’s great too, and opens the door for\
  \ not just significant options, but also new ways to play and things to consider\
  \ regarding your character.</p> \n    <h2>So You’re Playing a Vampire...</h2> \n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Illustration by Denman Rooke\n    </div> \n    <p>If\
  \ your GM is allowing vampires in her game, the first thing to decide is what type\
  \ of vampire is right for you.</p> \n    <ol>\n     <li><b>Choose Your Bloodline:</b>\
  \ Start on the inside front cover and get an overview of the four major types of\
  \ vampires that haunt the Inner Sea Region. Choose which one seems most appealing\
  \ to you. Each of these sections has tons of details on what distinguishes these\
  \ undead hunters, along with how they come into being, their desires, secrets, roles,\
  \ racial traits, and more.</li> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Want to know more about the\
  \ mystical jiang-shi? Check them out on page 6.</li> \n      <li>Want to play to\
  \ tradition with the Dracula-like moroi? Flip to page 8.</li> \n      <li>Looking\
  \ for something more ancient and mysterious? Consider the nosferatu on page 10.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Ready for the exotic, body-possessing vetala? Head to page 12.<br><br></li>\n\
  \     </ul> \n     <li><b>Create Your Character:</b> Once you’ve selected the type\
  \ of vampire you want to play, you’ll want to follow a few steps.</li> \n     <ul>\n\
  \      <li>Build your character as normal, probably starting as a 1st-level core\
  \ race, but talk to your GM about specifics.</li> \n      <li>Apply the relevant\
  \ vampire template (jiang-shi, <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>;\
  \ moroi, <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><i>Bestiary 1</i></a> [normal vampires];\
  \ nosferatu, <a href=\"/products/btpy82qy\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #8</i></a>;\
  \ vetala, <a href=\"/products/btpy8v2x\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea\
  \ Bestiary</i></a>).</li> \n      <li>Refine your powers: From traits specific to\
  \ each vampire breed (pages, 7, 9, 11, 13) to specialized feats (pages 16, 17, 28,\
  \ 29), no two vampires ever need be alike.<br><br></li>\n     </ul> \n     <li><b>Consider\
  \ Hunger:</b> Page 22 presents a new subsystem for hunger, whether it be the bloodlust\
  \ of vampires, the carrion hunger of ghouls, the life envy of ghosts, or otherwise.\
  \ Hunger brings the endless desires of the damned to the forefront of a game as\
  \ never before, with penalties for fasting but also new benefits for the well fed.<br><br></li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>Add Campaign Details:</b> The Inner Sea Region is full of places\
  \ vampires thrive, famous vampires you might somehow be tied to, and religions willing\
  \ to help you indulge your desires. Learn about them on pages 24 and 25.<br><br></li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>Learn How to Play Well with Others:</b> Now that you’ve decided\
  \ to play a sinister, lonely creature of the night, you’re likely headed into a\
  \ game about cooperation and heroics. Pages 14 and 15 presents a primer on what\
  \ it means to play a vampire in a Pathfinder campaign, with suggestions on handling\
  \ alignment, how you might interact with other players, and things both you and\
  \ the GM should keep in mind throughout the campaign to make sure that not just\
  \ you, but all the players, have many unforgettable adventures.<br><br></li> \n\
  \     <li><b>Be Flexible:</b> The base assumptions of the Pathfinder RPG were obviously\
  \ not designed to support vampiric characters, but with the tools presented in <i>Blood\
  \ of the Night</i> and a willingness to cooperate with your GM and other players,\
  \ you’ll be set for a Pathfinder experience like no other.</li>\n    </ol> \n  \
