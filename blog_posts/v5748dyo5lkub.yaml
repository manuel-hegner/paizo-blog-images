  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Last Friday, our team turned over to project lead\
  \ Vic Wertz the first draft of the upcoming <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core\
  \ Set</i>. This is a new type of box set, about which I'll go into detail below\
  \ and in later articles in this series, which will run for the next year. Sometimes\
  \ I'll write it, and sometimes you'll see the musings of the other members of our\
  \ highly talented design team.</p> \n    <p>It is not coincidental that this turnover\
  \ came at the end of a highly eventful week for the Pathfinder ACG design team.\
  \ As we began shipping our upcoming games <i>The Ninth World</i> and <a href=\"\
  http://lonesharkgames.com/games/thornwatch/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Thornwatch</i></a>,\
  \ the Lone Shark designers took the so-called \"final\" version (SPOILER: it wasn't)\
  \ of the Core Set to <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>, our favorite convention\
  \ to run PACG at. At Saturday night's Preview Banquet, I revealed the not-at-all-surprising\
  \ fact that we were making a new Core Set, as well the slightly bigger surprise\
  \ that the next Adventure Path is based on the beloved <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180607-CorePaizoCon_360.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n     <br><i>Showtime.</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Core Set can\
  \ be played by itself, if that's all you want—its story content is based on the\
  \ Pathfinder Module <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvy?Pathfinder-Module-The-Dragons-Demand\"\
  ><i>The Dragon's Demand</i></a>—and we're increasing the replayability even over\
  \ previous sets. But when you combine it with Curse, you'll have something about\
  \ the same size as previous Adventure Paths. Importantly, you need Core for Curse,\
  \ because the latter needs the former as a foundation to function. That's true for\
  \ <i>every</i> adventure we want to make going forward. So when we produce another\
  \ Adventure Path, or even perhaps a smaller adventure, you'll combine it with the\
  \ Core Set and get an experience similar to Rise of the Runelords or Mummy's Mask.\
  \ I described at the banquet how Core was basically done in design, and Curse was\
  \ well underway.</p> \n    <p>I described how both would release just before PaizoCon\
  \ 2019, which made a lot of people there very happy. Me, for example.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>And then I went into why we were making it now, and really what we were and\
  \ weren't making. Some of it supplemented <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljus\"\
  >this blog</a>, but since it's a year later, I actually knew what I was talking\
  \ about this time. So now I'll tell you.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  ></a> \n     <br><i>I would like to officially note that we are fully capable of\
  \ making a Top 5 list that stops at five.</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>This\
  \ graphic has been on our design team's whiteboard for several months. Its goal\
  \ is to remind us what we're doing and why.</p> \n    <h2>What's Staying the Same</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The most important element of this project is perhaps the least obvious:\
  \ We want to keep making the game we've been making. Throughout my career, I've\
  \ helped lead many reboots and expansions—D&amp;D 3rd Edition, Axis &amp; Allies,\
  \ Attack!, and Betrayal at House on the Hill, to name a few. Each time I've started\
  \ by spelling out how much we wanted to move the goalposts. That has typically defined\
  \ whether we're making a new <i>set</i> or a new <i>edition</i>.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ I've said for a while, we're not making this a \"second edition.\" Our goal isn't\
  \ to invalidate anything you have currently; everything you own for PACG is still\
  \ good and will continue to be. What we are creating now will interlock nicely with\
  \ Skull &amp; Shackles, Wrath of the Righteous, Class Decks, and everything else\
  \ that has come before. Some things are changing around the edges, including some\
  \ important terminology. but as we saw in our PaizoCon playtests, people got those\
  \ changes within minutes and were off playing without hesitation.</p> \n    <p>At\
  \ the heart, the PACG experience involves five cornerstone principles:</p> \n  \
  \  <ul> \n     <li>Improving your character by acquiring better boons for your deck.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Increasing your character's power along a linear arc, corresponding\
  \ to an increase in the difficulty of challenges.</li> \n     <li>Giving you a variety\
  \ of ways to grow your character over time and make it your own.</li> \n     <li>Letting\
  \ you explore the world by encountering cards and dealing with their challenges.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Doing so as a part of a cooperative team in an involving story.</li>\
  \ \n    </ul> \n    <p>None of this is going to change. We're not adding a PvP option,\
  \ dynamiting your role cards, or flattening out the power curve. These cornerstone\
  \ principles had to be observed when considering any change we wanted to make. Fortunately,\
  \ a whole lot of changes still fit under that tent.</p> \n    <h2>What's Changing</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Over the last five years, we've heard a lot of the same complaints. (We've\
  \ especially heard them from inside our office.) We figured we could use that experience\
  \ to spruce up PACG to be a better, faster, smarter game. We looked hard at these\
  \ challenges:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>The game is <b>a bit too slow</b> in all\
  \ phases: how long it took to set up, how long it took to take a turn, how long\
  \ it took to tear down. We looked for solutions that sped up everything, even if\
  \ we gained just a few seconds here or there.</li> \n     <li>For a game set in\
  \ one of the most expansive fantasy worlds ever made, we gave you <b>too little\
  \ story</b>. The opportunity we had to tell stories was mostly limited to tiny boxes\
  \ on the backs of cards, and conveyed very little of the depth the orignal storytellers\
  \ had given us.</li> \n     <li>Though we tell many different stories, the game\
  \ often gives off a <b>feeling of sameness</b>. We did morph from only having a\
  \ few different scenario types in Rise of the Runelords to having only a few \"\
  standard\" scenarios in Mummy's Mask. But more can be done.</li> \n     <li>Groups\
  \ of players get <b>varying experiences by group size</b>. A solo character is less\
  \ likely to run out of time and more likely to die; the reverse is true for large\
  \ groups. While that's fine, giving people the ability to toggle those variables\
  \ seemed smart.</li> \n     <li>Many cards have <b>complicated text</b>. We've piled\
  \ template upon template, sometimes requiring three or four powers on a card <i>before</i>\
  \ we started making it interesting. Certain card types like armors and spells got\
  \ burdened in ways we never envisioned.</li> \n     <li>Some sets were easy and\
  \ some were hard, but regardless there was <b>no way to control difficulty</b>.\
  \ If you wanted to make the game harder, you were on your own. We will benefit from\
  \ giving players controls for this.</li> \n     <li>For a cooperative card game,\
  \ the game is often <b>not interactive enough</b>. When you want to help your friend,\
  \ the game generally tells you that you can't unless you have a card that does so.\
  \ It's a co-op game, so it should feel more cooperative.</li> \n    </ul> \n   \
  \ <p>In addition to a design team that has grown and learned from all our iterations\
  \ of the game, we had three other resources to use to achieve some of these goals.\
  \ None of them existed when we made Rise of the Runelords, but all had been successful\
  \ in its wake. The first was the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/acg\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Adventure Card Guild</a>, which showed us new ways to tell and organize stories.\
  \ The second was Obsidian's <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures</a> app, which showed us ways to make the game sleeker and faster.\
  \ The third was Lone Shark's second ACG, <a href=\"/products/btpy9sct\">Apocrypha</a>,\
  \ in which we addressed a lot of these concerns.</p> \n    <p>In the next installment\
  \ of this design diary, I'll talk about how we used those tools to address one of\
  \ those big challenges: injecting more story. Thanks for reading!</p> \n    <p>Mike\
