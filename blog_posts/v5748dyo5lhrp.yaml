  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're just a few days away from\
  \ the start of Season 7: Year of the Serpent! That means it's time for an updated\
  \ Guide! The first big change you'll see is that we've changed the title to: <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><em>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a>.\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play has referred to two branches of organized play\
  \ for the past year, which we have distinguished with the terms Roleplaying Guild\
  \ and Adventure Card Guild. You'll be seeing more of this term as time goes on.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There are also a few other key changes to note for this revised version\
  \ of the Guide:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Added a new Step 1 to character creation\
  \ that involves choosing between Core and Standard Mode</li> \n     <li>Updated\
  \ some of the class-specific replacements and nuances, such as the exclusive use\
  \ of the summoner class that appears in <a href=\"/products/btpy9c25\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Unchained</em></a></li> \n     <li>Updated the faction symbols to use the new\
  \ art we released earlier this year</li> \n     <li>Updated Season 7 goals</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Added a Faction Journal Card section</li> \n     <li>Added a new Core\
  \ Mode section in Chapter 5</li> \n     <li>Added to the Playtest and Errata section,\
  \ providing additional ways in which a character can retrain features and resell\
  \ equipment following a rules update</li> \n     <li>Revised the Slow progression\
  \ so that one opts to use the slow progression at the very beginning of an adventure,\
  \ not at the very beginning of a level</li> \n     <li>Presented a concept of Downtime,\
  \ which is just the Day Job “slot.” This reinforces that everyone has Downtime,\
  \ even if they don't have a Day Job skill</li> \n     <li>Removed technology and\
  \ glitch information (now available on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/prd/\">Pathfinder\
  \ Reference Document</a>)</li> \n     <li>Removed the list of venture-officers,\
  \ which changes far too frequently these days to update the list only once or twice\
  \ a year; this information is <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >available online</a></li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>In addition to the new <em>Roleplaying\
  \ Guild Guide</em>, we've released new versions of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9dgw\"\
  >Faction Journal Cards</a> for you to download. If you're heading out to Gen Con\
  \ this weekend to play any of the new Season 7 scenarios, you'll want to grab this\
  \ updated document for your character! We hope they continue to add flavor to the\
  \ campaign and help you add additional roleplaying elements to your PFS experience.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Thank you to the Pathfinder Society venture-captains, venture-lieutenants,\
  \ and Jonathan Choy for helping us compile a list of necessary changes!</p> \n \
