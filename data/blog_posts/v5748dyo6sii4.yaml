  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>As I continue\
  \ my reading of the </em>Godsrain Prophecies’<em> dire predictions of the deaths\
  \ of various gods, it should be noted (and will be, in the compiled report for my\
  \ Lady), that their existence as a collection brings into question the validity\
  \ of each one. I believe that a corollary of the Windsong Paradox explains this\
  \ best (as unsettling as this discovery of “prophecy” has been, I relish the opportunity\
  \ to apply one of my favorites!): each individual prophecy exists independent of\
  \ the others, as if they each occur in their own solitary void (note, for example,\
  \ the mention here of a living Pharasma).This means they cannot all be true and,\
  \ per the corollary, the chance of any of them being true is lessened¹. A reassuring\
  \ thought that I am happy to consider!</em></p>\n      <p><em>¹In all fairness,\
  \ a counter-argument could be made that one of the </em>Godsrain Prophecies<em>\
  \ is correct in full, with all others either invalidated by its truth or purposefully\
  \ created to mislead, but I tend to believe my initial theory (perhaps, if nothing\
  \ else, because it is a bit more comforting).</em></p>\n      <p><strong>—</strong><em>Yivali,\
  \ Apprentice Researcher for the Lady of Graves</em></p>\n      <center>\n      \
  \ <br>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n       <br>\n      </center>\n      <p>The wound\
  \ that kills Asmodeus has ached for countless eons, and still he has no memory of\
  \ how Ihys drew blood. He knows the war between them, can hear the ringing battle\
  \ cries as he fought hard for order, and Ihys, sympathetic fool, set chaos in his\
  \ sights. He sees his brother’s hand outstretched, can feel the arm against his\
  \ back, remembers what it tasted like to plunge his sword into his kin, but never\
  \ feels the moment that some blade or nail sliced at his leg, has only blood upon\
  \ his hands to prove that he was hit.</p>\n      <p>Some days the cut is barely\
  \ there, a scratch upon his surface, a moment’s irritation as he moves from place\
  \ to place. But other days, it festers into leaking, pulsing wetness, a shooting\
  \ pain that drips and strikes and stops him where he stands. He spends those days\
  \ in agony, sealed deep within the Catafalque, encouraging the rumors of his secret\
  \ chamber of delights, returning only when the wound has calmed itself again.</p>\n\
  \      <p>He’s known, somewhere inside himself, that this would be what felled him,\
  \ but somehow, in his final steps, he still feels disbelief. How can one cut unravel\
  \ everything that he has been and done, the worlds that he has built and wrecked,\
  \ the Hell he has created? He stumbles through the empty hall, his body crashing\
  \ to the ground, a rictus of shocked agony carved deep into his face. Perhaps it\
  \ is a mercy that he cannot see what happens next, does not perceive the brother\
  \ who emerges in his place. Ihys, summoned by the force that kept the gash forever\
  \ open. Ihys, who, with sorrowed glance, replaces him upon his throne. Ihys, who\
  \ believed in taking mercy on the mortals, giving them their freedom even when they\
  \ broke and twisted things, seeing good inside their souls as something worth the\
  \ sacrifice. Ihys, now the Prince of Darkness. Ihys, Lord of Hell.</p>\n      <p>Deep\
  \ inside the Catafalque, the new god works deliberately, taking time to understand\
  \ the Hell his brother wrought. He finds a few things to preserve—the contract of\
  \ creation and its binding power on the gods, the prison that holds Rovagug, whose\
  \ key he’s now charged with keeping—and vows he will uphold them in Asmodeus’s name.\
  \ The rest he’s ready to unmake, but slowly, with the greatest care. This time he\
  \ will not act in haste. This time Hell works <em>his </em>way.</p>\n      <p>He\
  \ first visits the archdevils, his enemies of ages past, who greet him with their\
  \ surface smiles and offer false obeisance—some dripping poison-syruped words, some\
  \ sharpening their blades and fangs, some gathering a mass of shades to wait for\
  \ new wartime demands. But Ihys understands their ways and flaunts his new divinity,\
  \ his scepter <em>Archstar </em>swinging in a show of all his power, and while the\
  \ peace he gains from them may be a prelude to a war, he makes each of Hell’s denizens\
  \ sign contracts to a new decree—a kinder, gentler punishment for those whose souls\
  \ have damned them there, a way for those to free themselves who want to choose\
  \ another path, a safe route as they journey back up from the depths of Hell.</p>\n\
  \      <p>He's visited by deities—some curious, some threatening—who see the shifting\
  \ way of things and wish to understand. And while Pharasma alters how her psychopomps\
  \ send souls to him and Sarenrae applauds an ancient ally on his newfound life,\
  \ the Four Horsemen of Abaddon begin to seek advantages, to plan some future action\
  \ they may one day undertake.</p>\n      <p>With Hell remade to suit his likings,\
  \ Ihys settles on his throne, turns the power of his gaze to fixing mortal things.\
  \ He pores through every contract that he must now enforce, underlining loopholes\
  \ that invalidate the cruelest clauses, marking for destruction those he cannot\
  \ bend or change. With every small relinquishing, the power in some region shifts,\
  \ as those who felt their contract as a prison or a heavy weight now have the chance\
  \ to change the old direction of their lives. But none change more than Cheliax,\
  \ where House Thrune used the power gifted by the Lord of Hell himself to make the\
  \ many contracts that have kept them on the throne. Ihys rescinds this favor and\
  \ refuses to grant any more, leaves the realm of Abrogail to manage on its own.</p>\n\
  \      <p>As Ihys rests then, satisfied. He does not hear the whispers, as close\
  \ as Mephistopheles and far off as Egorian, of bitterness and revolution, hanging\
  \ in the air. Or if he does, he honors them as choices made of mortal will—whatever\
  \ comes, he lives and breathes, and he can always start anew. If devils come to\
  \ challenge him, if Cheliax is torn to shreds, he’s happy to rend everything (with\
  \ Rovagug set free to feed) and make the world again.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ (at least according to this still unproven and unidentified source) might not\
  \ mean the release of the Rough Beast, only for the prophecy to suggest that Rovagug\
  \ might still be unleashed? Those who claim that research has no excitement are\
  \ simply in the wrong field of study. I also must confess that this prophecy has\
  \ piqued my interest in learning more of the fallen god Ihys—a topic I might not\
  \ otherwise have considered! It will, though, have to wait. I must reach some conclusion,\
  \ and still have much to read through, before I can present this to my Lady.</em></p>\n\
