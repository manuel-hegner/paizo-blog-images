  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">We’ve been\
  \ taking a look at the various organizations featured in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a> over the past few weeks. (Hop over <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/lostOmensCharacterGuide\"\
  >here</a> if you’ve missed these!) While all of these are great in their own right,\
  \ there’s one organization that was an immediate shoo-in when we started early discussions\
  \ for this book: the Pathfinder Society! The Pathfinders are probably one of the\
  \ most well-known and most widespread organizations in our Age of Lost Omens setting.\
  \ Heck, they have the name of our game in the name of the organization! There was\
  \ no way we could ignore them!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ van de Beek</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>The Pathfinder Society is a globe-trotting\
  \ organization whose agents are dedicated to exploring the world, finding lost knowledge\
  \ and relics, and reporting their findings both to the Society itself and to the\
  \ rest of Golarion via the Pathfinder Chronicles, a publication released by the\
  \ Society that is essentially a “greatest hits” of reports from Pathfinders. (For\
  \ a taste of the kind of missions Pathfinders go on, check out Howard Andrew Jones’\
  s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwr?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-The-Idol-and-the-Scythe\"\
  >fiction</a> from a few weeks ago!) People join up with the Society for a number\
  \ of reasons. Some want to seek knowledge, others prefer the glory that comes with\
  \ their findings, others still join up for the fun and thrills involved with their\
  \ missions, and some just want to help the Society and further its causes.</p> \n\

  \ by Bryan Sola</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>The Society contains a few broad factions\
  \ that cover most of these general aspects and most Pathfinders typically associate\
  \ with one or two of these factions during their career, though such association\
  \ isn’t compulsory. These factions are the Envoy’s Alliance—a group dedicated to\
  \ the well-being of the Society and its members, the Grand Archive whose members\
  \ are devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, the Horizon Hunters who prefer to just\
  \ travel for the sake of exploration and locating new and forgotten sites, and the\
  \ Vigilant Seal which includes those Pathfinders who rise up to contain the threats\
  \ the Society encounters on its missions.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Pathfinders make use of lots of different types of equipment. These vary from\
  \ common adventuring gear to more specialized tools like <i>wayfinders</i>. These\
  \ magical compasses serve both as a badge of membership for Pathfinders and also\
  \ as a useful tool for their travels. The typical <i>wayfinder</i>, which is located\
  \ in the Core Rulebook, allows its user to create magical light and tap into the\
  \ power of the magical gemstones known as <i>aeon stones</i>. The common <i>wayfinder</i>\
  \ isn’t the only one in use by the Pathfinders, however. This book provides a few\
  \ new <i>wayfinder</i> types along with other magical items like the <i>fortifying\
  \ pebble</i>, a talisman that reduces the damage dealt to the item to which it is\
  \ affixed.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191011-shiningwayfinder.png\"\

  \ alt=\"Shining Wayfinder, Item 4. Uncommon, Abjuration, Divination, Evocation,\
  \ Invested, Magical. A shining wayfinder is a polished silver compass blessed by\
  \ the power of benevolent deities. It has the usual functions of a wayfinder, except\
  \ instead of an activation to cast light, the shining wayfinder has the following\
  \ two activations. Activate: command, interact; Effect: You hold the wayfinder and\
  \ ask for guidance. The wayfinder casts guidance on you. Activate: command, interact;\
  \ Frequency: once per day; Effect: You call upon the wayfinder’s divine blessings\
  \ for yourself and your allies. The wayfinder casts bless, with an emanation centered\
  \ on itself. Once per turn, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate\
  \ trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet.\"></a> \n      </div> \n\
  \      <p>Players looking to play a character who is a member of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society can do so pretty easily. The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens World Guide</a> featured the Pathfinder Agent, an archetype representing\
  \ a more generic member of the Society. That archetype covers the general abilities\
  \ one comes to expect as a member of the Society. Namely, it gives you means of\
  \ helping you search around on your travels, gain more knowledge, and help out your\
  \ allies. (Explore, report, cooperate!) Characters who took this archetype will\
  \ find a few more feats to help expand their different skills. These include the\
  \ Everybody Duck! feat which helps out when you accidentally set off a trap you’\
  re trying to disarm and the Recognize Threat feat to better help you recognize the\
  \ monsters you fight.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191011-recognizethreat.png\"\
  ><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191011-recognizethreat.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Recognize Threat, Feat 8. Uncommon, Archetype, Skill. Prerequisites: master\
  \ in a Recall Knowledge skill, Pathfinder Agent Dedication. Trigger: Your first\
  \ turn of an encounter begins, and you can see a creature. Requirements: You have\
  \ master proficiency in a skill to identify the triggering creature. You quickly\
  \ assess the threat so you can relay the information to your team. Attempt a Recall\
  \ Knowledge check against the triggering creature.\"></a> \n      </div> \n    \
  \  <p>Not all Pathfinder choose to be jacks of all trades, however. Part of a Pathfinder’\
  s training requires that they gain the approval of the three deans of the Grand\
  \ Lodge before they are considered full-fledged agents. These deans are known as\
  \ the Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and Swords and each specialize in a different\
  \ skill to train up and coming agents. The Scrolls train in history, knowledge,\
  \ and observation; the Spells focus on magical lore and theory; and the Swords teach\
  \ recruits combat and survival techniques. Once they become proper Pathfinders,\
  \ many agents continue to associate with their peers from either the Scrolls, Spells,\
  \ or Swords and undertake missions that favor a particular branch.</p> \n      <div\

  \ want to represent this affinity can do so with the three new archetypes in this\
  \ book. The Scrollmaster, Spellmaster, and Swordmaster archetypes all follow in\
  \ the vein of the Society branches themselves. The Scrollmaster, for example, is\
  \ all about researching and being prepared and gains abilities to both further and\
  \ make use of their extensive knowledge. On the other hand, the Spellmaster focuses\
  \ on magic and using said magic for things like creating protective wards and even\
  \ absorbing the spells of your foes to fire the spells back at them!</p> \n    \

  \ from making further attempts to get to the bottom of things. When you Decipher\
  \ Writing, you need only half as long as usual (reducing the time from about 1 minute\

  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>If you prefer your survival and that of your companions\
  \ over anything else, you might consider taking the Swordmaster archetype. The archetype\
  \ provides new options for both survival and faring well in combat. Some of these\
  \ options are designed to help you prevent damage to yourself, while others are\
  \ here to help you defend your allies. Regardless of which branch you associate\
  \ with, your character can take these archetypes right away or in addition to the\
  \ Pathfinder Agent archetype. Much like with the Hellknights and Knights of Lastwall,\
  \ these new archetypes dovetail perfectly from the Pathfinder Agent, allowing you\
  \ to mix and match the skills and abilities to your liking.</p> \n      <div class=\"\
