  \   </div> \n   <p>Cave raptors are sated; it's time to blog!</p> \n   <p>So far,\
  \ we've uncovered the shocking details of raising an innocent idea into a rebellious\
  \ roleplaying product, but if your beloved book never moves out of the house, then\
  \ it will never really make anything of itself. Now is the time when a PDF, so self-important,\
  \ must go out into the world by itself. And sure, it may come back wrinkled or torn,\
  \ or even upside down, but without that life experience, it will never truly be\
  \ its own book. It's time to talk about the physical, blue-collar side of game design:\
  \ printing, warehousing, and distribution.</p> \n   <p>For all intents and purposes,\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"> <i>Dwarves</i></a>\
  \ is ready to pack up and head off to college. Out of sight of its overprotective\
  \ developers and even its best friend, the art director, it will grow into a bearded\
  \ adult of glossy pages and the comforting scent of ink. Then it comes home, where\
  \ its loving parents criticize its dress, notices it's gained weight, and implies\
  \ that it should cut its hair because it looks like a hippy. Then it leaves again.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Printing of RPG products is arranged through horrible, arcane methods,\
  \ often via deals with unseen and unknowable supernatural powers. Paizo prefers\
  \ to deal through the fey, who are both adept at weaving physical products from\
  \ ideas and accept readily available sandwiches as payment (in truth, lead developer\
  \ Jason Buhlman's most important contribution to the company is his astounding egg\
  \ salad, which pleases the fey queen Titania and ensures a lasting business relationship\
  \ and a minimum of ironic curses). Once the electronic layout of a book is finished,\
  \ it is transferred through a series of tubes to the distant faerie courts. The\
  \ attending pixies immediately spin it into gold, and then press the gold itself\
  \ into physical books and arrange for its return. Total elapsed time to print a\
  \ Paizo product: 14 minutes. Sadly, due to the unstable chronological connection\
  \ between the First World and our own mortal realm, upwards of two months may pass\
  \ in our world during that 14 minutes.</p> \n   <p>Eventually, sprite couriers,\
  \ glamered as UPS drivers, drop off multiple tons of product at the Paizo warehouse.\
  \ This fabulous structure, adjacent to the production offices, is the realm of warehouse\
  \ manager and 10th-level monk Jeff Strand. The warehouse stores not only Paizo's\
  \ catalog of products, but also much of the stock for the online store, and so organization\
  \ is vital. Inhuman physical strength is also important, as every pallet of products\
  \ can weigh up to an Imperial ton (which is to say, it weighs as much as 2,000 pounds\
  \ worth of emperors). Jeff and his able-bodied assistants work tirelessly to ship\
  \ orders out as soon new product arrives, focusing first on Paizo's thousands of\
  \ loyal subscribers. During these rushes, Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens and Vice President\
  \ Jeff Alvarez can even be found braving the warehouse's icy trenches and lurking\
  \ glabrezu in order to send books far and wide.</p> \n   <p>The enormity of Paizo's\
  \ distribution efforts is staggering, especially to a little goblin. In addition\
  \ to sending out literally tons of product at a time to subscribers and fans, pallets\
  \ of each and every product to come through the door immediately goes back out to\
  \ retail distributors like Alliance and Diamond. Like NBA scouts, these distributors\
  \ then ship our MVPs all across the U.S. of A. and beyond, across the ocean to Europe\
  \ and even north into the fabled Canada. And this volume doesn't even include our\
  \ licensees who translate Paizo products for non-English-speaking fans.</p> \n \
  \  <p>Printing and distribution are vital to the lifecycle of a gaming product.\
  \ Without that final kick out of the nest, to plummet or soar, pages would be doomed\
  \ to constant revision. Roleplaying is built on a spine of pulp and glue, and losing\
  \ the physical quality of the game book means losing an important piece of our heritage.\
  \ Without that healthy respect for the past, the next generation will grow up cold\
  \ and mechanical, controlled as they are by the fluoride in their computer screens.\
  \ By the end, we'll bow before our PDF overlords, and soylent green will be people!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Plus, if you drop your latest <i>Pathfinder</i> in the bathtub, you can\
  \ fix it with a hairdryerâ€”try doing that with an e-reader!</p> \n   <p>This wraps\
  \ up our quick review of the Paizo publishing process; you now understand as much\
  \ about creating new products as I do. Starting next week, we'll take a look at\
  \ existing Paizo products with our new feature, Sci-Fried.</p> \n   <p>Crystal Frasier\
