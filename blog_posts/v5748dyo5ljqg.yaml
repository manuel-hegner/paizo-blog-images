  ><em>Bestiary 6</em></a> is slithering out into the world, but even though the book\
  \ is out there, I've still got a few more things to chat about the contents. Going\
  \ forward, we'll continue to sow off some art from the book but these posts will\
  \ be more \"behind the scenes\" than \"monster previews.\"</p> \n     <p>Which brings\
  \ us to today's theme—powerful monsters. For some time now I've wanted us to produce\
  \ a Bestiary whose challenges skew higher than traditional. While it's true that\
  \ more games are run at lower level, and thus there's a need for a lot of low and\
  \ mid tier monsters, we've published a lot of those already in prior Bestiaries.\
  \ One of the problems facing GMs and adventure writers of high-level content is\
  \ a lack of monsters to fill the role of threat. As a result, high-level adventures\
  \ tend to have lots of creatures with class levels, templates, advanced Hit Dice,\
  \ or sometimes two or even three of these categories in play.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ <em>Bestiary 6</em>, I wanted to give us all more toys to play with for adventures\
  \ that take place above 10th level, be they powerful creatures to fight again and\
  \ again or unique foes to serve as a long quest's final boss or as the theme for\
  \ an entire campaign. I also wanted to populate some niches of monsters that have\
  \ long been denied higher CR representation—usually, the high CR monsters are outsiders\
  \ or dragons or giants. In preparing for <em>Bestiary 6</em>, I realized that we'd\
  \ done a shockingly few number of monstrous humanoids and plants above CR 10, for\
  \ example, so those two categories were ones I immediately looked to address. I\
  \ spoke about oozes a few weeks back with the blights, of course, but when you get\
  \ your copy of <em>Bestiary 6</em>, I think you'll be delighted by the number of\
  \ new options of monsters to throw at your players, particularly powerful monsters\
  \ that aren't overly huge and can fit into areas as small as the player characters\
  \ themselves!</p> \n     <p>Three of my favorite high CR additions to the game include\
  \ the kaiju (including the most powerful one of them all—Lord Varklops), the apocalypse\
  \ horse (which came about as a natural result of the decision to include the Horsemen\
  \ of the Apocalypse and then realizing these high CR demigods needed something more\
  \ significant than an advanced nightmare to ride around on), and the ouroboros (a\
  \ monster I've wanted to get into an RPG for well over a decade). Ranging from CR\
  \ 21 (the ouroboros) to CR 25 (the apocalypse horses) to CR 30 (Lord Varklops),\
  \ these three make a perfect cross-section of the variety of powerful foes in <a\
