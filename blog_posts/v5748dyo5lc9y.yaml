  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 16, 2011</p> \n   <p>So sometimes, we're\
  \ so eager to get new player options into print we kind of get ahead of ourselves\
  \ and stumble over our own feet in our haste. This happened, alas, with the just-released\
  \ <i>Pathfinder Companion: Humans of Golarion</i>, in which we present something\
  \ called \"totem domains\" for the Shoanti but then forgot to quantify exactly how\
  \ anyone can get access to these domains! Oops!</p> \n   <p>There are seven totem\
  \ domains in all—one each for the seven Shoanti quahs (clans). Each quah's totem\
  \ actually consists of several different related animals or objects. For example,\
  \ the Lyrune-Quah (the Moon Clan) venerates the following totems: bats, cave bears,\
  \ field mice, the moon, mountain lions, owls, rainstorms, stars, and wolves. Although\
  \ clerics and druids who become Shoanti shamans venerate their totem, they do not\
  \ abandon their actual religion. Instead, these totems are simply assimilated into\
  \ the traditions of whatever deity (for clerics) or perhaps philosophy (for druids)\
  \ the character follows. A full list of Shoanti totems, including the domains these\
  \ totems grant, appears on page 16 of <i>Humans of Golarion</i>.</p> \n   <h1>Shoanti\
  \ Shaman (Cleric and Druid Archetype)</h1> \n   <p>The Shoanti shaman is a very\
  \ simple archetype that either clerics or druids can take (with GM permission, you\
  \ can certainly adjust the archetype a bit so that other classes with access to\
  \ domains can be a Shoanti shaman, but keep in mind that the Shoanti have a very\
  \ specific flavor, and something like a Shoanti inquisitor is kind of weird...)—\
  doing so allows the character to gain access to his clan's totem domain. A Shoanti\
  \ shaman has the following class feature.</p> \n   <p><b>Totem Domain</b>: At 1st\
  \ level (for clerics) or upon gaining a domain as part of Nature Bond at 1st level\
  \ (for druids—a druid who instead opts to take an animal companion cannot use the\
  \ Shoanti shaman archetype), pick one of your Shoanti quah's totems. You can use\
  \ an image of this totem you carry or wield as your divine focus in addition to\
  \ using the normal divine focus you might utilize (such as a holy symbol). In addition,\
  \ you add that totem's domain choices to the list of domains you may choose from\
  \ when picking a domain. If you are a cleric, you must still choose one of your\
  \ domains from those normally granted by your deity. If you are a druid, your totem\
  \ domain options replace the standard domain options granted by nature bond.</p>\
