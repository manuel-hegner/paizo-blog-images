  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>“Give it your allsix.\
  \ Give it your allsix.</em>” The chipper voice sang out in the spacious green and\
  \ yellow interior cockpit of the Veskarium Vanquisher mech. The sound of responding\
  \ digital displays and humming power fields harmonized with the cheerful voice.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>“Time to face the morning and make some nufriends!</em>” A second,\
  \ equally energetic voice joined in to complete the ditty and punctuated the song’\
  s end with a series of additional digital keystrokes on floating vidscreens.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Sarotska watched with interest as the data appeared in front of her.\
  \ The holographic light shined off her bright red scales, giving her a momentary\
  \ violet complexion as she took in the display. Swiping the holographic data away\
  \ with her claw, the vesk commander of the mech briefly closed her eyes.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Quiet on deck. Bunkle, ready the plasma rifles. Jiji, I want to make sure\
  \ the weapons core is ready to swap our output over at a moment’s notice.” Sarotska\
  \ spoke the commands as her eyes re-opened and fixed on the alien landscape now\
  \ visible through the small view slit that was only accessible from her position\
  \ in the mech’s chest cavity cockpit.</p> \n     <p>The stone forests of Elytrio’\
  s southern hemisphere were some of the most unnerving terrains that Sarotska had\
  \ seen in her long time with Obsidian Spiders mercenary company. She’d battled the\
  \ Azlanti Star Empire, the Swarm, and at least a half-dozen different types of outsiders\
  \ who’d breached the Material Plane for one reason or another. She’d taken part\
  \ in the second Scoured Stars invasion and inserted onto jungles where colossi walked\
  \ like modern gods. Still, Elytrio had a feel completely unlike that of any world\
  \ she’d walked on. It was a planet that appeared dead, yet wasn’t entirely done\
  \ with the world of the living.</p> \n     <p>“Sorry about the singing, boss. It’\
  s just, this place doesn’t seem right, ‘gree?” The statement and question came from\
  \ Bunkle, one of two other operators onboard the mech with Sarotska. The electric\
  \ blue skittermander turned around and looked up to Sarotska’s elevated position\
  \ in the cockpit, his six arms continuing to manipulate controls around him as he\
  \ scrunched his face.</p> \n     <p>“Yeah boss. I thought this place was supposed\
  \ to be an irradiated wasteland, but there’s no sign of radiation. It’s just a bunch\
  \ of weird, petrified trees.” The follow-up came from the other skittermander crewmember,\
  \ the cherry-red Jiji, who kept her eyes forward, looking out from sensors and moving\
  \ the mech’s twin plasma rifles at the smallest disturbance in the terrain.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Sarotska waved a dismissive claw while peering out the viewscreen. “\
  Look. We’re here to find some missing Starfinders. Or, at the very least, their\
  \ bodies. The Society paid for us because their team that went missing was pretty\
  \ capable and it’s likely whatever took them down ambushed them in this area. So\
  \ yes, I think something isn’t right here, but I think the only way we’re going\
  \ to figure it out is if you keep you eyes on your screens, Bunkle.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The blue skittermander crunched his face in a sour expression and stuck out\
  \ his tongue before swiveling around to stare back at the mountain of data feeds\
  \ that accumulated in front of him. Jiji chuckled from her position, though her\
  \ wide eyes never left the constant flow of data.</p> \n     <p>“Got something,\
  \ boss! Looks like a signal up ahead behind those rocks.” Jiji chirped from her\
  \ station. The data quickly moved up to Sarotska’s station with a visual swish as\
  \ it loaded onto her console.</p> \n     <p>“Hmmm...” Sarotska mused as she took\
  \ in the data. “It looks like a blip of radiation from behind the rocks. Could be\
  \ some leftover irradiated debris. Probably something the Starfinders would have\
  \ investigated on their mission here.</p> \n     <p>“Bunkle, I’m going to move us\
  \ closer. Keep the plasma rifles ready, just in case.” The commands emerged from\
  \ Sarotska’s mouth, but she’d already put the mech in motion. One plodding step\
  \ after another, the Vanquisher continued moving on its path. The roughly humanoid\
  \ bulk of it crushed the cracked gray terrain around it, as the bulky chassis of\
  \ the Vanquisher navigated through trees and debris.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>The\
  \ Vanquisher mech was something of an oddity of Veskarium-crafted mechs. It lacked\
  \ the armor upgrades common on mechs like the Ripclaw or Warmander, and instead\
  \ had been designed by Veskarium engineers for maximum destructive ranged combat.\
  \ A Vanquisher boasted a pair of heavy plasma rifles, capable of devastating the\
  \ land around it for a hundred feet. To mount such brazen weapons on its hull, the\
  \ Vanquisher not only sacrificed heavy Veskarium armor, but it also lacked any sort\
  \ of dedicated melee weapon beyond its ponderous legs.</p> \n     <p>“I’m getting\
  \ something, boss... more radiation. It looks like... OH NO!” Jiji updated just\
  \ in time for the crew to spot two things in their sensor displays.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ first was a gruesome cluster of bodies. Six skeletal figures, each with radically\
  \ different equipment, were scattered at the base of the rock. The emblem of the\
  \ Starfinder Society caught in a slight updraft off the tattered backpack of one\
  \ of the unfortunate souls, letting the crew of the Vanquisher know that they’d\
  \ found their targets.</p> \n     <p>The second sight was a sudden movement in the\
  \ rocks. In an instant, the top rock seemed to ripple in the breeze, and then a\
  \ moment later, it spouted thousands of cracks. As the crew tried to comprehend\
  \ what they were seeing, the cracked rock burst into thousands of tiny forms that\
  \ formed a swarming cloud.</p> \n     <p>“Jiji! What are we looking at here?” Sarotska\
  \ demanded as she backed the Vanquisher off from the agitated lifeforms.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“High radiation, boss. Looks like it’s a colony of insects that fed off\
  \ the radiation. Their wings are some kind of shielding material, so that’s why\
  \ we couldn’t scan them earlier.” Jiji blathered as she scanned streams of incoming\
  \ data and manipulated the information with her arms, sending necessary data to\
  \ both Sarotska and Bunkle.</p> \n     <p>Outside the Vanquisher, the swarm continued\
  \ to grow as more of the nearby “rocks” sluffed away to unleash droning insects\
  \ that joined their kin in a growing ball. Instinctively reacting to the mounting\
  \ threat, Sarotska moved the Vanquisher back several paces, with each step causing\
  \ the swarm to reflexively discorporate or extend in random directions. Then, an\
  \ instant after the mech came to a plodding stop, the swarm engulfed the mech and\
  \ alert sirens blared.</p> \n     <p>“Radiation increasing! The outer shields have\
  \ burst. The outer hull is melting!” Jiji continued to deliver verbal updates, despite\
  \ the information displays Sarotska had in front of her to confirm the damage.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Bunkle, I think it’s time that we give our new <em>friends</em> a show\
  \ of force.” Sarotska put distinct emphasis on the word “friends,” employing the\
  \ tonal meanings of the Vesk language to let her crewmember know that these insects\
  \ were to be immediately recognized as hostiles and targeted immediately.</p> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p>A moment later, two beams of bright white and blue plasma\
  \ streamed out from the twin rifles mounted on the Vanquisher’s upper limbs. The\
  \ swarm danced around the beams, and while some of the insects fell into electrified\
  \ husks, others in the swarm seemed to bloat and expand off some of the energy weapons\
  \ fire that poured into them.</p> \n     <p>“Looks like they’re eating most of the\
  \ plasma, boss. It’s just like how they eat radiation here.” Jiji reported as the\
  \ cockpit shook with another violent impact from the swarm. “Outer hull integrity\
  \ is down fifty percent. Ammo reserve number one is jammed!”</p> \n     <p>Sarotska\
  \ took a moment. She closed her eyes again, and breathed as time slowed around her.\
  \ She assimilated the verbal updates from Jiji, the scores of tactical data that\
  \ flooded her vision, and then saw the swarm through the viewport in her station.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>With a flash of white teeth, Sarotska opened her eyes and she fell\
  \ back into the moment.</p> \n     <p>“Jiji, shift the weapons core energy to siphon\
  \ high-frequencies into the rifles. Override the fire mixture since they’re feeding\
  \ on that. Bunkle, get ready to make the next two shots count.” As the commands\
  \ issued from her, Sarotska took control of the Vanquisher’s movement systems and\
  \ siphoned from the power core to initiate a stomping trample maneuver—the only\
  \ reliable melee option available to the mech. The stomping behemoth moved through\
  \ the swarm, which parted at its sudden burst of speed.</p> \n     <p>Shifting on\
  \ its ponderous legs, the Vanquisher made a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn as Sarotska\
  \ steadied the moving mech with manual controls from her station. Jiji continued\
  \ adjusting screens as she desperately sent energy streaming from the rear-mounted\
  \ weapon core into the twin plasma rifles. Finally, Bunkle rested his upper arms\
  \ behind his head, while his remaining two sets of arms both went to work lining\
  \ up shots through the Vanquisher’s autotargeting system.</p> \n     <p>“Guess today’\
  s not the day for nufriends, ‘gree?”</p> \n     <p>A stream of electrified air blasted\
  \ out from the rifle arms, momentarily deafening the cockpit’s occupants. Instead\
  \ of the fiery plasma that previously emerged, waves of sonic resonance accented\
  \ by arcs of lighting flew out in a straight line toward the swarm of insects. The\
  \ twin lines pulverized the swarm together, where arcs of electricity shot between\
  \ the insects, baking their bodies to dust in an instant.</p> \n     <p>“We did\
  \ it!” Jiji shouted, leaping atop her piloting chair.</p> \n     <p>“Was there ever\
  \ a doubt?” Bunkle followed-up, cracking the fingers of his lower arms while his\
  \ upper arms continued to support the back of his head.</p> \n     <p>Sarotska’\
  s smile vanished as stillness overcame the former battlefield. Nothing remained\
  \ of the targets.</p> \n     <p>“Bunkle.” the vesk pilot began, her tone immediately\
  \ conveying a mounting sense of anger and worry.</p> \n     <p>“You didn’t hit those\
  \ Starfinders’ remains, did you?”</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>VESKARIUM VANQUISHER\
