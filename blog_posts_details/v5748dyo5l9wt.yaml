  artist: "a long and tangled path, editing. Above all, Burroughs is an incomparable\
    \ Storyteller, capital S, and his works have never gone out of print in the 97\
    \ years since he published the serialization of his first novel, Under the Moons\
    \ of Mars (later retitled A Princess of Mars), in All-Story Magazine—the same\
    \ novel that introduced me to ERB and got me permanently hooked. When I was in\
    \ my teens, I devoured ERB's works—systematically, ruthlessly, obsessively—racing\
    \ first across the dead sea bottoms of Barsoom with John Carter, then on to the\
    \ lands that time forgot of Caspak and Pellucidar, touring savage jungles and\
    \ lost cities with Lord Greystoke, flying through the shrouded skies of Amtor\
    \ (Venus) with Carson Napier, and reveling in the adventure and romance of every\
    \ one of Burroughs's many standalone novels. How could Kline possibly measure\
    \ up to that? It was such a game of expectations that kept me"
