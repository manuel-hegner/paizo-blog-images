  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The bulk of the convention season is behind\
  \ us, and it's time to jump back aboard the weekly <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> preview train! And I've got to say, Gen Con was just the\
  \ thing to re-ignite my excitement about the product line and all of the amazing\
  \ stuff we have coming out in the next year or so! Before we get into this week's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> preview, please allow\
  \ me to list a few items that are stirring my excitement, including some behind-the-scenes\
  \ stuff you might not be aware of!</p> \n     <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, now scheduled for a November release, is shaping up to\
  \ be one of our best sets yet. We've approved ALL of the paint masters for the set,\
  \ the packaging is finished, and we're into production as I write this. While I\
  \ have not yet seen final production figures from the run, everything I've seen\
  \ for <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> makes me even more\
  \ excited about the set than I've previously been, which is really saying something.\
  \ From the digital sculpts to figure selection to the paint masters, everything\
  \ has gone \"right\" with this set, and I can't wait to see the final product in\
  \ hand.</li> \n      <li>While waiting at the Indianapolis airport upon my attempted\
  \ escape from Indiana on the ill-fated day of the Deltapocalypse, our friends at\
  \ WizKids provided about two-thirds of the digital sculpts from the next set, entitled\
  \ I CAN'T TELL YOU YET, and holy moley, there was so much coolness packed into that\
  \ set that I didn't even mind being delayed by seven hours, so fueled was I with\
  \ overwhelming awesomeness. I barely had any corrections or comments for this batch,\
  \ and all of the fellow Paizonians I fanatically showed the images to while they\
  \ also waited to board their planes agreed with my assessment. Some of the very\
  \ best <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures are yet to\
  \ come. The multi-figure \"themes\" in the next set are REALLY strong, and I think\
  \ folks are really going to dig them.</li> \n      <li>Speaking of the next (secret)\
  \ set, I can confirm that the case incentive is EXTREMELY SPECIAL, and unlike anything\
  \ we've done previously. Not totally unlike what we've done before, but definitely\
  \ bigger and better. There will be more value packed into this incentive than in\
  \ any of our previous sets, and now that I've seen some of the sculpts associated\
  \ with it... man. So, so cool.</li> \n      <li>While at Gen Con, I had a chance\
  \ to meet with WizKids, and I'm happy to report that based on that discussion I'm\
  \ now at work building the NEXT setlist, which should cover us through all of 2017\
  \ insofar as big sets are concerned. This set, too, will have an unprecedented and\
  \ completely awesome Case Incentive featuring something people have been asking\
  \ for for a long time. The line is healthy and we're moving forward full steam ahead!</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Lastly, I'm super excited to welcome back to the Paizo family Mr.\
  \ Mike Kenway, our former Licensing Coordinator, who returns to Paizo after a year\
  \ in the wilderness as our Director of Licensing. Mike will return to helping me\
  \ out on setlists, approvals, and reference coordination, which will be an enormous\
  \ boon. Mike has worked on nearly every <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> set, and bringing him back onto the team frees me up to push the envelope\
  \ conceptually even further. A team of two is much, much better (and much more efficient)\
  \ than just little old me doing nearly everything (on the Paizo side, anyway) by\
  \ myself, and I speak for the entire Paizo team when I say: \"Welcome back, Mike!\"\
  </li>\n     </ol> \n     <p>So with all of that great news out of the way, let's\
  \ take a look at three figures from November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly\
  \ Foes</em></a> set!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveCatcher.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveCatcher_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>First up this week is the nasty Cave Catcher, a sneaky subterranean\
  \ hunter who ensnares adventurers with its sticky tongue. This Medium, uncommon\
  \ figure is sure to menace your player characters, and at the uncommon rarity, why\
  \ not pit your heroes against a small clutch of the creatures?</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveGiant.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveGiant_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Want something larger for your cavern adventures? How\
  \ about <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>'s Cave Giant? These\
  \ monstrous brutes dwell in caves, where they make slaves of lesser creatures like\
  \ dwarves, orcs, troglodytes, and player characters. Wielding a massive bone battleaxe\
  \ and clad in filthy hide, the Cave Giant makes a perfect addition to the ranks\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> giants we've produced\
  \ to date. The Cave Giant is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-HouseDrake.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-HouseDrake_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is the delightful little House Drake,\
  \ which appears under a different name on page 229 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>. This deadly creature packs impressive power\
  \ into its small (actually Tiny) frame. Perfect as either an improved familiar,\
  \ a mischievous opponent, or even the child of a larger dragon figure, the House\
  \ Drake is a rare figure on a Small base.</p> \n     <p>And that's it for this week!\
  \ It was great to chat minis with a few of you at Gen Con, and I look forward to\
  \ our paths crossing again!</p> \n     <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n     <p>Erik\
