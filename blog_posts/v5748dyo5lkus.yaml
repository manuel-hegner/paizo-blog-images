  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game fans! If you're\
  \ going to be in the Columbus area over the next four days, please come visit us\
  \ at the <a href=\"http://originsgamefair.com\" target _blank>Origins Game Fair</a>—\
  there will be lots of PACG to play!</p> \n    <p>We have lots of tables of Season\
  \ of Factions' Favor running in the Hyatt's Franklin Ballroom. You can play them\
  \ at these times:</p> \n    <table class=\"table-spacing-large\"> \n     <tbody>\n\
  \      <tr>\n       <td><b>Thursday</b></td>\n       <td>8:00 AM</td>\n       <td>10:00\
  \ AM</td>\n       <td>1:00 PM</td>\n       <td>3:00 PM</td>\n       <td>5:00 PM</td>\n\
  \       <td>7:00 PM</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><b>Friday</b></td>\n\

  \  </table> \n    <p>You can find me hanging out with PACG developers Keith Richmond\
  \ and Paul Peterson at the Lone Shark Games booth, #235. Paul and I will also join\
  \ James Ernest for our annual Origins by Night podcast every night of the show from\
  \ the Big Bar on 2, just a few feet from the Pathfinder games. Come say hi!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We'll also be bringing a copy of the playtest set for next year's PACG\
  \ Core Set. I don't know how many games we'll be able to get in while we're there—\
  there's a lot going on at the show—but whenever we have time, we'll bring it over\
  \ to the PACG area and playtest with you.</p> \n    <p>We'll have promo cards to\
  \ sign and a first look at our Free RPG Day promo character...</p> \n    <h2>Nok-Nok…\
  \ He's Here</h2> \n    <p>A while back we revealed Nok-Nok, our fifth goblin promo\
  \ character for <a href=\"http://freerpgday.com\" target=\"_blank\">Free RPG Day</a>.\
  \ That's an annual event where gamers around the world play hobby games all day\
  \ long. More than a dozen companies provide free products for participating retailers\
  \ to give out, and Paizo is no exception. In addition to the modules <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1au?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-5uper-Goblins\"><em>We Be 5uper Goblins!</em></a>\
  \ for the Pathfinder RPG and <a href=\"/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot\"\
  ><em>Skitter Shot</em></a> for Starfinder, we've got <a href=\"/products/btpya1be?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-NokNok\"\
  >Nok-Nok</a> for PACG.</p> \n    <p>Nok-Nok is from the upcoming <a href=\"https://owlcatgames.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em></a> CRPG. My birthday-twin Chris\
  \ Avellone wrote a bunch of stuff for that game, and so we wanted to honor him by\
  \ including Nok-Nok in our world. Here's Nok-Nok in all his glory.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-NokNok.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-NokNok_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>When someone asks you if you're a god, you say yes.</i></p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>We especially like the central mechanic on Nok-Nok: that he\
  \ cares how many of what are in his location deck. Sure, every character does. But\
  \ Nok-Nok is especially good at gaining value from cards that aren't even flipped\
  \ over from the location deck yet. It's kind of awesome to watch.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-HeadDrum.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-HeadDrum_360.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-FifthGawd_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Also, Nok-Nok may not be every goblin's goblin. The\
  \ other goblins use his head as a drum, which does not endear them to Nok-Nok. If\
  \ you want a goblin to solo through the first adventures in Rise of the Runelords\
  \ or Season of the Runelords, Nok-Nok's your man. Er, goblin. If you can't get your\
  \ hands on Nok-Nok on Free RPG Day, don't fear! We'll be sending him out for free\
  \ along with <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription\"\
  >PACG subscription shipments</a> of <a href=\"/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck\"\
  >Ultimate Wilderness</a> in July; non-subscribers will be able to purchase him from\
  \ paizo.com starting August 2.</p> \n    <p>We're hoping to see you at Origins and\
  \ on Free RPG Day! Thanks for playing!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure\
