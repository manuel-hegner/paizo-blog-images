  >Faction Talk</a> section of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play messageboard.\
  \ We'll also be sending out the email update to registered Pathfinder Society players\
  \ as an additional heads-up, and we're frequently exploring other ways to get the\
  \ word out.</span></p> \n    <p>Over the past three seasons, the Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign has published special scenarios that are exclusive to 4-star GMs, 5-star\
  \ GMs, Venture Captains, and Venture Lieutenants—both to reward our top judges and\
  \ to incentivize others to GM more and earn those stars. When <i>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #2–EX: The Midnight Mauler</i> first came out in early 2011, the campaign\
  \ had one 5-star GM, about half a dozen 4-star GMs, and 18 newly minted Venture\
  \ Captains. We've since grown to over 50 5-star GMs, more than 150 4-star GMs, and\
  \ 345 Venture Captains and Venture Lieutenants! Rather impressive!</p> \n    <p>Since\
  \ then, we've introduced quite a few new GM rewards that continue to reward and\
  \ incentivize the campaign's excellent volunteers to keep sharing their hobby with\
  \ others: limited replay and the star bonus on \"shirt re-rolls.\" Today we're announcing\
  \ both a new reward and a change to how we're handling the exclusive scenario this\
  \ year.</p> \n    <h2>The Exclusive</h2> \n    <p>This year we're releasing <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8wrx\"><i>The Ruins of Bonekeep, Part 1: The Silent Grave</i></a>\
  \ as an exclusive scenario for qualifying GMs, who can now run the adventure anywhere.\
  \ These GMs should see the scenario in their downloads early this week. Keep in\
  \ mind that when qualifying for one's fifth star, all Ruins of Bonekeep adventures\
  \ contribute to a GM's 10 required Exclusive or Special events.</p> \n    <h2>GM\
  \ Star Chronicle</h2> \n    <p>Back when Mike first became Campaign Coordinator,\
  \ I remember sending him an elaborate proposal for a GM reward system. Back then\
  \ it was clunky, required heavy IT support, and accurately reflected how new I was\
  \ to booncraft, so the idea faded from memory. We recently rediscovered those old\
  \ plans, blew off the dust, and (with the help of some clever Venture Captains and\
  \ Venture Lieutenants) revised the concept for distribution. In addition to being\
  \ available for download from this blog, we will add these to the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/pfsFreeProducts\"\
  >Free Products page</a> in the next day or so.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ provides benefits that scale with a player's stars and a character's level. Each\
  \ represents a character's tutelage and special training with one of the three Masters:\
  \ Aram Zey, Kreighton Shaine, or Marcos Farabellus. When you meet both criteria\
  \ for a boon (such as the GM having 3 stars and the character being level 5+), you\
  \ can skip a Day Job roll or spend 1 Prestige Point to train with your patron and\
  \ gain that boon's benefits. At this time, each GM can only select and assign one\
  \ such Chronicle sheet. The exception to this limit is a 5-star GM, who can select\
  \ and assign an additional Chronicle sheet to a different character for each additional\
  \ 50 tables of GM credit he or she earns (two sheets at 200 games, three sheets\
  \ at 250, et cetera).</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/download/pathfinder/GMStarChronicle.zip\"\
