  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">So here's a secret about the text\
  \ we create for the back cover of our books and the blurbs that go on our website\
  \ and catalogs. They're usually done at the last minute by a developer who's been\
  \ working on the product possibly for many months. In my case, that means I get\
  \ a chance, finally, to play around with some writing of my own, even if it's only\
  \ for a few paragraphs. When I wrote the blurb for <a href=\"/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 6</em></a>, I mentioned something called \"strangely sentient oozes,\"\
  \ because of the new category of ooze I came up with to include in the book. I didn't\
  \ want to reveal their name or theme yet (that's for this blog post... read on for\
  \ more!), but I did want to mention them in some way that felt nice to read and\
  \ fun to write. And so I came up with the phrase \"strangely sentient oozes,\" because\
  \ I enjoyed the sound of the phrase; its consonance makes you hiss when you read\
  \ it, which evokes in the mind (in theory) imagery of something slithering and sliding\
  \ sloppily in subterranean sloughs or sepulchral sewers. See? I wasn't trying to\
  \ give folks hints as to a new system of calculating intelligence for ooze monsters\
  \ or trying to make folks deduce the nature of how a primordial ooze might become\
  \ self-aware. It wasn't a clue as much as it was an attempt at lyricism.</p> \n\
  \    <p>But it was certainly a blast seeing folks try to figure out clues anyway!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So, the time is here to reveal a little more about these strangely sentient\
  \ oozes. They comprise a new category of ooze called a blight. This is a subtype\
  \ of ooze, all of which are very intelligent (the dumbest one in the group has an\
  \ Int of 15), all of which are quite powerful (the CR scores range from CR 13 to\
  \ CR 19â€”I can't see any blights coming in future products that are CR 12 or lower,\
  \ but there's absolutely room for blights above CR 19!), and all of which are linked\
  \ to a remote, wilderness terrain.</p> \n    <p>Blights themselves were created\
  \ eons ago by serpentfolk druids who worshiped the raw savagery of nature, and when\
  \ they discovered a way to infuse the terrain itself with malevolence and sentience\
  \ to recruit the land as yet another minion against their enemies, the first blights\
  \ were born. But when they performed the ritual, it backfired... not only did the\
  \ land liquefy and awaken, but so did their culture and the druids themselves. These\
  \ druids, their sacred grounds, and the surrounding terrain transformed into a protoplasmic\
  \ monstrosity that viewed all civilization (yes, including serpentfolk civilization)\
  \ as the enemy. The first blight split itself apart into countless blots of slimy\
  \ hatred and infested several different regions. The nature of those regions further\
  \ shaped and forged these first blights' powers. The least powerful of them settled\
  \ in the relatively lifeless deserts, where they developed powers of drawing moisture\
  \ out of surrounding life and cursing their domains with extreme temperatures. The\
  \ most powerful seeped into the deep caverns in the heart of the serpentfolk domain,\
  \ absorbing radioactive ores and developing the power to petrify at a touch. Others\
  \ settled in forests or mountains, sewers or swamps, and even in the frozen tundra.\
  \ All possess spell-like abilities, a favored terrain, the ability to curse that\
  \ terrain, and a tendency to rejuvenate if you don't uncurse their realm after defeating\
  \ them. Blights are also tailor-made to serve as \"boss\" monsters for wilderness-themed\
  \ adventures, for while they detest other creatures that have intellects, they understand\
  \ that such creatures make great agents and soldiers in their campaigns against\
  \ civilization. That they save their agents for last in their murderous plans is\
  \ an uncomfortable truth that all who serve blights eventually learn.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Although there's seven blights in all, I'm only gonna show off three of them,\
  \ but that should be enough to get an idea of their shared physical traits and themes!</p>\
