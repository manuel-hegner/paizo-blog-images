  \ on February 22, 2023.</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"\

  ><em>Starfinder Bounty #7: Voyage on the River Between</em></a></p> \n     <p>*part\
  \ of a subscription </p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>The Replacement of Ehu Hadif</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Two weeks ago, the deadline for First Seeker Candidates officially passed!\
  \ Our submissions for this event are now closed.</p> \n     <p>We had a total of\
  \ 95 candidates submitted to be the new First Seeker, which is incredible! The most\
  \ represented species were androids, vesk, humans, halflings and skittermanders.\
  \ At press time, we’re still selecting the final candidates for the election. Once\
  \ we’ve made our choices and contacted the winners, we’ll be sure to email everybody\
  \ who submitted to inform them. I can’t wait to announce the candidates!</p> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <h2>Rules Updates</h2> \n     <h3>Orcs in Organized Play</h3>\
  \ \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7z\">As we announced\
  \ two weeks ago</a>, in honor of the upcoming ORC License, orcs are now a freely\
  \ available player ancestry in Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! For Pathfinder\
  \ (second edition), the boon has been retired, and a free resurrection has been\
  \ added to previously-purchased boons. We did the same thing when we made leshys\
  \ freely available in 2021, so we’re delighted to provide this benefit now. In Starfinder\
  \ Society, previously-created orcs may use the boon to take a +2 bonus to any one\
  \ stat, as described in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq#admittance-boon-always-available\"\
  >Starfinder Society FAQ</a>.</p> \n     <p>Any players who purchased these boons\
  \ in January of 2023, prior to this change, may request a refund of their Achievement\
  \ Points by emailing orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com. Boons purchased before January\
  \ 1 will not be refunded.</p> \n     <p>Finally, despite the ambiguity in the initial\
  \ announcement, orcs will <b>not</b> be a playable race in Pathfinder Society (first\
  \ edition). While we appreciate the community’s enthusiasm, the depiction of orcs\
  \ in first edition content does not reflect our current values. Our portrayal of\
  \ this ancestry has evolved over the years, and their initial presentation as aggressive,\
  \ callous, and domineering isn’t something we want to encourage in our Organized\
  \ Play programs. I offer my personal apologies for the lack of clarity in the first\
  \ announcement; I wrote it very quickly during a very busy time without fully considering\
  \ the implications, and I won’t make that mistake again.</p> \n     <h3>Dragonkin\
  \ in Starfinder Society</h3> \n     <p>Recently, we were made aware that while most\
  \ dragonkin choose to form a partner bond, canonically it’s not required. Additionally,\
  \ asking players to choose their dragonkin’s partner from character creation presents\
  \ a burden to newer players, or those who want to tell the story of forming that\
  \ bond with a fellow adventurer.</p> \n     <p>As a result, we’re updating the SFS\
  \ rules on dragonkin to read as follows, effective immediately:</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>When you create a dragonkin character, you may select another player’\
  s character to form your partner bond with. Mark down that character’s Organized\
  \ Play number on your character sheet. If that character is permanently slain, then\
  \ you can select a new partner bond by marking a new Organized Play number on your\
  \ character sheet between sessions.</p> \n      <p>A dragonkin adventurer may choose\
  \ not to form a partner bond, or they may choose to form one later in their adventuring\
  \ career. Once a partner is selected, they may not be replaced unless they are permanently\
  \ slain.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <h3>Starfinder Society 1-99: The Scoured\
  \ Stars Invasion</h3> \n     <p>One last treat for the Starfinder community! Our\
  \ multi-table interactive specials are some of the most sought-after scenarios,\
  \ and they often serve as a draw for conventions around the world. Recently we’\
  ve been allowing the special to be replayed a limited number of times, but when\
  \ our first Starfinder interactive was released, this was not the case. Based on\
  \ community feedback, we’re happy to correct this.</p> \n     <p><em><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  >Starfinder Society Special 1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</a></em> may now be\
  \ played or GMed <b>twice</b>, one in each level range (1-4 and 5-8). This means\
  \ you can earn a total of four Chronicle Sheets if you play and GM the special twice\
  \ at different tiers. As always, a character may not have multiple chronicle sheets\
  \ from the same adventure. This text will be added to the product page immediately;\
  \ due to production timelines, it is unlikely to be added to the PDF anytime soon,\
  \ but it is on our list to update.</p> \n     <p>If you’re interested in taking\
  \ advantage of this immediately, the play-by-post community will be offering the\
  \ special at their upcoming convention, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43qhj?ANNOUNCING-PlaybyPostDiscord-Outpost-VI\"\
  >Outpost VI</a>!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> \n     <h3>New\
  \ Content</h3> \n     <p>This month saw the release of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dsn\"\
  ><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em></a> Adventure Path compilation, and with it,\
  \ the sanctioning for the adventure! Much like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Abomination-Vaults\"\
  ><em>Abomination Vaults</em></a>, the chronicle sheets and boons are nearly identical\
  \ to those published with the first printings. Otherwise, it’s been a quiet month\
  \ for new content! Work is underway on sanctioning <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eav?Pathfinder-Treasure-Vault\"\
  ><em>Treasure Vault</em></a>, which should be ready for street date next month.\
  \ After that we’re hoping to get starting on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Firebrands\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Firebrands</em></a>, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy2?Starfinder-Adventure-Drift-Crisis-Case-Files\"\
  ><em>Drift Crisis Case Files</em></a> for Starfinder, and are starting to eye up\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftHackers\"\
  ><em>Drift Hackers</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/gatewalkers\"\
  ><em>Gatewalkers</em></a> Adventure Paths.</p> \n     <h3>Age of Ashes</h3> \n \
  \    <p>Three years ago, we posted our sanctioning documents for the first Adventure\
  \ Path for Pathfinder second edition: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes\"\
  >Age of Ashes</a>. Completing this document was actually one of my first tasks as\
  \ a brand-new Paizo employee! As a reward for completing the various volumes of\
  \ this adventure, players were granted new boons which unlocked various character\
  \ options.</p> \n     <p>As it’s been three years, we thought it was time to open\
  \ these up a little further. Players may now spend their Achievement Points on brand-new\
  \ boons to unlock certain options from the Age of Ashes Adventure Path! These boons\
  \ unlock the uncommon character options that haven’t already been printed in other\
  \ rulebooks. The full text of the boons is available on the Pathfinder FAQ page.\
  \ Enjoy the new content!</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Beginner Box</h3> \n     <p>When\
  \ the <a href=\"\">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> was released, our hope was that it\
  \ would be used as-is to introduce players to both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\
  \ and Pathfinder Society. As such, we sanctioned it with specific rules regarding\
  \ character creation, and we provided an extra Achievement Point incentive to run\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p>Now that it’s out of its initial release, it’s clear that while\
  \ it’s great for introducing players to Pathfinder, the players who come to us for\
  \ Pathfinder Society are more interested in exploring other options. As such, we’\
  re updating the sanctioning rules. The Beginner Box is now sanctioned <b>fully in\
  \ campaign mode</b>, meaning that players may bring any characters the GM permits\
  \ to play the adventure. These can be characters built using the Beginner Box rules,\
  \ but do not have to be. Additionally, while it will remain repeatable, we’ll be\
  \ reducing the Achievement Point reward to the normal value: 4 for players and 8\
  \ for GMs. We hope this better serves the community’s needs!</p> \n     <p>To anticipate\
  \ the question, we won’t be making the same change for the Starfinder Beginner Box.\
  \ Due to the significantly altered ruleset in this product, it wouldn’t be feasible\
  \ to expect a standard Starfinder character to be any easier to use in the Beginner\
  \ Box.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <h3>GM Ranks</h3> \n\
  \     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves\
  \ a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent).\
  \ A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Nova for SFS.</p> \n     <p><b>5th\
  \ Nova (SFS)</b>: Marcel de Groot</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Conventions</h2> \n\
  \     <p>This month we began recruiting volunteers for major conventions! Applications\
  \ are now open for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7u?Call-to-Volunteer-PaizoCon-Online-2023\"\
  >PaizoCon Online</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7x?Call-to-Volunteer-Gen-Con-Indy-2023\"\
  >Gen Con Indianapolis</a>. If you’re interested in GMing at either of these shows,\
  \ we’d love to have you!</p> \n     <p>We’ve also got a calendar full of <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/conventions\">local conventions</a> around the world, which you\
  \ should check out to see what’s happening in your area! This month I’m excited\
  \ to attend <a href=\"https://www.dundracon.com/\"><b>DunDraCon</b></a> in Santa\
  \ Clara, California and <a href=\"https://gamergirlgames.com/\"><b>GenghisCon</b></a>\
  \ in Denver, Colorado. Getting to meet the local communities is one of the best\
  \ parts of my job, so if you’re near either of those shows, come out and say hi!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Okay, that’s quite enough from me. Until next time - Explore! Report!\
  \ Cooperate! and go play some orcs!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
