  date\">Monday, October 25, 2010</p> \n    <p>With the culmination of the first Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicler fanfiction contest earlier this month, and the imminent arrival of\
  \ the new Pathfinder Tales novel <i><a href=\" /pathfinder/tales/v5748btpy8h6j\"\
  >Winter Witch</a></i>, there's been a huge surge of interest in Pathfinder fiction,\
  \ especially fanfiction. After all, when you spend a bunch of time with your head\
  \ buried in a world like Golarion, it's only natural that a lot of folks are going\
  \ to have stories they want to tell. Unfortunately, with the exception of established\
  \ authors like Dave Gross and Elaine Cunningham, most people have a lot of work\
  \ cut out for them if they want to write official Pathfinder Tales.</p> \n    <p>Fortunately,\
  \ thanks to the community use policy, you don't have to! It seems like every week,\
  \ there's a new venue popping up for folks who want to read and write Golarion fanfiction.\
  \ This week, that's Paizo fan Tokoz and his new project <i>Absalom Archives</i>,\
  \ an online fanfic magazine that's currently putting out the call for submissions.\
  \ If you're interested in helping create a new fanfiction community, the submission\
  \ guidelines are posted <a href=\" /paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/campaignSetting/general/communityProjectAbsalomArchivesMagazine\"\
  >over here</a>.</p> \n    <p>Of course, this new project is just one of several\
  \ ways you can bring Golarion stories from your head (or gaming table!) to the public\
  \ eye. Whether you want to be part of the continually growing crowd over at <a href=\"\
  http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Chronicler</a>,\
  \ or join in on <i>Wayfinder</i>—one of the most professional-looking fan products\
  \ in the industry—there's plenty of space for you. And that doesn't even consider\
  \ all the folks doing art inspired by Pathfinder characters. I wouldn't be surprised\
  \ if there's some music out there, too. (And if so, I want to know about it!)</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So what are you working on?</p> \n    <p>James Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p>\
