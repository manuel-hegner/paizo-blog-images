  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 15, 2010</p> \n    <p>With PaizoCon just\
  \ a few days away, some of you reading this blog may be thinking, \"Man, I can't\
  \ believe I can't make it to Gen Con <i>and</i> PaizoCon this year. The world is\
  \ so unfair!\"</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <div align=\"right\">\n    <table border=\"\
  0\" align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n\
  \       <td><a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenCon2010JennySeoni.jpg\" target=\"\

  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"3\"></a></td>\n      </tr>\n     </tbody>\n    </table>\n\
  \   </div>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p>While that is undoubtedly true, never fear,\
  \ gentle GenConian! Because this is your official reminder that the <b>Third Annual\
  \ Pathfinder Gen Con Cosplay Contest</b> is less than 2 months away at this point!\
  \ (Shock! Gasp!)</p> \n    <p>Here's the deal: At some point during Gen Con, you\
  \ show up to the Paizo booth dressed in your best Pathfinder costume. (That means\
  \ monsters and characters with obvious ties to Golarion itself, not generic cosplay—\
  that wizard hat could be from anywhere.) In addition to drawing a crowd of happy\
  \ gawkers, the contestants will have their pictures taken by whatever staff members\
  \ are handy. Those folks with the best costumes, as decided by us, will end up on\
  \ the Paizo blog once we return from Gen Con, at which point we'll allow the posters\
  \ on the messageboards to pick their favorite. What criteria that mad and merry\
  \ crew will use is anybody's guess—creativity? recognizability? skin-to-clothing\
  \ ratio?—but whoever they select as the best Pathfinder cosplayer will walk away\
  \ with 50 dollars in store credit! But more importantly, the winner will go home\
  \ knowing that he or she (or they, if folks want to team up to make a life-sized\
  \ linnorm) have entered the exclusive cadre of the Paizo Cosplay Winner's Circle.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And now ('cause you knew it was coming), a note for PaizoCon attendees:\
  \ While there's no official costume contest at PaizoCon this year, folks attending\
  \ both cons are encouraged to bust out their costumes early and show the colors\
  \ this weekend, to give the competition a taste of what they're up against. (And,\
  \ of course, to get as much fun as possible out of that Hellknight armor you spent\
  \ all winter forging.)</p> \n    <p>So what are you waiting for? Fire up that old\
  \ sewing machine and see if you have what it takes to compete with folks like the\
  \ already announced model-and-designer team of Jenny Poussin and Laithoron from\
  \ the Paizo messageboards, whose amazing realization of Seoni (pictured above) is\
  \ bound to set the bar high this year. But forewarned is also forearmed, and there's\
  \ still time to get in on the game...</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p>James\
  \ L. Sutter <br>Fiction Editor and General Rabble-Rouser</p> \n   </blockquote>\
