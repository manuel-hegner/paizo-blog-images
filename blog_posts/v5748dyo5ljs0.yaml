  \ the Gauntlet Infinity!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, May 4, 2017</p> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When last we\
  \ left our heroes, they were locked in a fight with a cunning and powerful warlord\
  \ from the depths of space who had claimed the all-powerful Gauntlet: Infinity and\
  \ was planning to use it to rule the universe! Can our heroes triumph to reclaim\
  \ the gauntlet? Will they survive the daylong battle, subsisting only on snacks\
  \ and caffeine? Will you help them achieve victory?</p> \n    <p>Every year, Paizo\
  \ puts together a team to do battle with others from the greater game community\
  \ around Seattle for a board game tournament at the Mox Boarding House. This year's\
  \ Gauntlet: Infinity tournament is set to go down on May 21!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ metal trophy. We've had the honor of wearing it in the past, and this is our chance\
  \ to take it back! You can help by <a href=\"http://thegauntlet2017.causevox.com/team/Paizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">donating to our team</a>. Every donation goes toward earning\
  \ us a number of \"power-ups\" or special advantages that help us during the games.\
  \ Better still, all of your donations go to support Treehouse, a local charity organization\
  \ dedicated to helping foster kids graduate high school!</p> \n    <p>Let me introduce\
  \ you to this year's Paizo team:</p> \n    <table class=\"table-spacing-large\"\
